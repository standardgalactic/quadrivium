Not everything that counts can be counted and not everything
that can be counted counts.
—Albert Einstein
As the late management guru Peter Drucker once said,“Plans are only good
intentions unless they immediately degenerate into hard work.”The intent of
this book is not to lead you through long, arduous planning processes while
hackers are stealing your network out from under you.The intent is to provide
you with effective network security planning tools so that you can “degenerate
into hard work” as quickly as possible to keep your network secure with the
least amount of effort.
Rather than losing sleep at night wondering who’s wandering around your
network in the dark, you can create a comprehensive security solution for your
company that will meet your security needs today and will allow you to address
new security requirements in the future.This book is designed to help you do
exactly that.

Introduction
Let’s start by stating two assumptions we’re making in this book. First,
we’re assuming you have a solid understanding of IT project management.
If not, we have provided you with a free download of the book How to
Cheat at IT Project Management (visit www.syngress.com/solutions to reg-
ister this book and download the PDF) so you can ﬁll in any gaps you
may have. Second, we’ll assume that you have a fairly good understanding
of network security.This book is not intended to teach you basic IT pro-
ject management nor is it intended to teach you how to implement spe-
ciﬁc network security solutions for your particular situation. What this
book will do is provide an operational framework for you to use in
designing your own IT security project plan.
Now that we’ve gotten those details out of the way, let’s talk about
network security. It’s a massive subject and an enormous undertaking for
any network administrator out there in the real world right now. By cre-
ating a project plan for addressing network security, you can approach this
sometimes onerous task with a well thought-out plan. By creating a com-
prehensive plan for network security, you can be conﬁdent your network
is as secure as humanly possible.There is no magic bullet and network
security is a never-ending task, but using a consistent methodology will
reduce your errors and omissions. In network security, it’s often what you
overlook that intruders exploit.
In this chapter, we’re going to look at project management from a
security planning perspective. We’re not going to speciﬁcally cover IT pro-
ject management, but we will use that framework to develop our IT secu-
rity project plan.This will help reinforce your IT project management
skills while providing you with a roadmap for implementing IT security
in your organization.

Corporate Security 
Project Plan Components
Before discussing the specifics of IT security project planning, let’s set
the stage. Every company has a wide variety of diverse network com-
ponents that have an effect on security (e.g., users, firewalls, and net-
work topologies).As such, every company usually ends up with one
overarching corporate security project plan, and many individual secu-
rity project plans, each covering a specific area (see Figure 1.1). In
formal project management language, the corporate security project
plan is considered a “program,” which by definition is a related set of
project plans that are managed across the enterprise to enable optimal
use of resources and to reduce project conflict (i.e., time, cost,
resources).To keep it simple, we refer to the “corporate IT security
project plan” as the “master plan” and to the sub-level plans as “indi-
vidual focus areas” or “individual security area project plans.”The larger
the project, the more difficult it is to manage successfully; therefore,
you are more likely to be successful if your corporate security is broken
down into small project areas. We’ll refer back to this model
throughout the book as we explore how to create successful IT secu-
rity project plans.
One important note at this juncture is that the topic areas included
in Figure 1.1 may not be the topic areas you need for your corporate
security project plan.You may not need all of these or there may be one
or more additional security areas you need to include.The areas listed in
Figure 1.1 are commonly used in many organizations but this is not con-
sidered an exhaustive list by any means.

Figure 1.1 Corporate Security Project Plan Components
The True Cost of Security
Let’s begin with a brief overview of why we even care about network
security. If our networks and data didn’t need to be secured, we could just
leave the gates open and allow anyone in.The reality is obviously far from
that. Data needs to be secured because it provides your company with a
competitive edge or because it’s conﬁdential personal information such as
credit card data or social security numbers.There are thousands of reasons
why networks and data need to be secured and the unfortunate truth is
that there is always someone out there looking for a new way in.That
said, it’s also true that the majority of security breaches are internal.
Whether permissions are incorrectly set allowing a user to access an
important ﬁle or whether a sophisticated user manages to get a hold of his
boss’s password in order to look at pay rates or performance reviews; mali-
cious or inadvertent security breaches are most often an inside job.

According to the FBI, nearly 80 percent of security violations are
caused by authorized users with legitimate access (i.e.,“insiders”). Security
threats include disgruntled employees, unsuspecting users, and outside
contractors with insider access. U.S. companies spend over $6 billion
annually on computer security hardware and software, but the best ﬁre-
walls and security tools cannot prevent internal security breaches caused
by internal issues (e.g., poor end-user security practices, inadvertent mis-
takes, lax attitudes, employee exploitation of security holes and intentional
attacks or hacks).
How much is security worth? Network administrators are constantly
under pressure to reduce costs and expand services.A recent study shows
that as a percentage of revenues, IT budgets have gone down over the
past few years. So, while the actual dollar amount of the corporate
budget has risen, the percentage allocated to IT from corporate revenues
has dropped (i.e., your company is growing but is not giving you the
financial resources you need to do your job). For the sake of argument,
let’s assume that you have trimmed all the fat from your budget.You are
running lean and mean and have no more “give” in your budget. What
do you do when push comes to shove? Whatever your answer, it prob-
ably directly or indirectly impacts network security (e.g., not having
enough IT staff to maintain systems; fewer upgrades to secure operating
systems; fewer purchases or upgrades of intrusion detection systems; less
time to plan and implement a comprehensive security solution).
So, rather than fall victim to decreasing IT budgets, let’s discuss a
proactive stance.As discussed in How to Cheat at IT Project Management ,
one of the keys to success in the IT world is understanding the company’s
business plan. No one is going to hand you a blank check; you have to be
savvy.To that end, we look at some quantiﬁable and veriﬁable numbers
that can be used to develop a strategy for getting your IT security budget
approved.

Business Intelligence…
How IT Budgets Are Actually Spent
The February 2006 issue of “CIO Insight Magazine” discusses a research
study on IT spending. The conclusions? Many IT professionals agree that
their companies do not spend enough on IT (i.e., IT departments are han-
dling an ever-increasing number of projects while IT spending is moving
away from hardware and software to stafﬁng and services). The study
also surveyed how IT budgets are spent. Interestingly, security software
was eighth on the list of technology spending. Disaster recovery and
business continuity was ﬁrst on the list of initiatives. According to Ken
Goldstein, an economist with the Conference Board (a business research
organization), part of the reason companies are reluctant to spend more
on IT is that businesses “haven’t gotten full utilization out of what
they’ve already spent, and they need to. They will not necessarily cut back
their spending, but what we will get is this cautious, conservative
spending.” (CIO Insight, February 2006, p. 69.) Making the effort to align
IT projects with corporate strategies and to develop and present a busi-
ness case for key IT projects, continues to be one of the best ways to
ensure that your IT department has the tools and resources it needs.
Security spending should be a discrete line item in your IT budget. You
should prepare the business case for security separately (though in an
integrated manner), otherwise it may get lost in the larger IT budget.
Prevention vs. Remediation
One of the best ways to support an increase in IT spending for security, is
to clearly delineate the cost of preventing a security breach versus the cost
of ﬁxing a security breach. Most corporate executives appreciate a rational
approach to the business end of IT, and ﬁnd a risk analysis and ﬁnancial
overview helpful tools in justifying additional expenditures.A recent study
by Computer Economics shows that spending on security is approxi-
mately 3 percent of all IT expenditures, which has remained fairly con-
stant for the past three years. Most telling is that security spending has
www.syngress.com
6
Chapter 1 • IT Security Project Management Building Blocks

remained constant while other areas of IT spending have fallen over the
same period of time. In addition, spending on security has shifted. Many
of the efforts made in the past several years to harden networks against
attack are paying off in lower remediation efforts.
This is the key take away for IT professionals today in making the busi-
ness case for security. Security spending in the past has reduced the cost of
remediation efforts today. Sometimes it’s hard to make the case for some-
thing that’s absent, but this is an opportunity to tout how successful past
efforts have been. If you don’t have speciﬁc data you can point to, you can
generate some realistic estimates. Determine how much you’ve spent on
hardening the network and calculate about how much time that has saved
in both IT staff time and in productivity on the network.When the net-
work is attacked, you have three expenses: the IT staff time, the produc-
tivity of people trying to use the network and the often more intangible
cost to the company’s reputation (which sometimes becomes a legal issue
with ﬁnancial implications). If you’re hard pressed to ﬁgure out how much
your company has saved by not having security breaches, do some research
and ﬁnd industry averages applicable to your industry or company size.To
assist in that, we’ve provided a few numbers, courtesy of research by the
Computer Economics group.While this data may be generic, it’s a good
starting point to help you make the business case for the return on invest-
ment for past security spending and why it’s a good idea to keep spending
that money. Here’s another hint: Sit down with your company’s ﬁnancial
expert and have a few ﬁnancial metrics generated based on your ﬁndings. If
you can show a positive return on investment (ROI) or an internal rate of
return (IRR), your company’s management will have to sit up and pay
attention.Along the way, you’ll help secure your reputation as someone
who understands the business of IT.
The independent research ﬁrm, Computer Economics, suggests using
the following four steps to create a generic ROI for computer security:
1. Analyze the potential economic impact of a security breach (you
may want to delineate the potential impact of several different cate-
gories of security issues such as virus, phishing, DoS, etc.).
www.syngress.com
IT Security Project Management Building Blocks • Chapter 1
7

2. Determine the business exposure (network, Internet connectivity, e-
commerce intensity, and so on).
3. Examine and delineate the cost of security.
4. Calculate the ROI of security.
For example, if a virus invades your network, you can track how many
IT staff hours were required to remediate the situation, by calculating how
long you spent ﬁxing the problem (e.g., 60 minutes × 48 users × an
average hourly rate based on overall salary levels in the organization).
Sometimes, you can determine how much revenue was lost during that
time (e.g., if you had to shut down an e-commerce server for four hours,
what were the average hourly sales for that particular day and time?) Can
you calculate how many of those customers will not return or will spend
less in the future? Probably not, but you know the four-hour outage will
have a ripple effect that is larger than the calculated hourly loss. In gen-
eral, some quantiﬁable data is better than none, and you can use it to
begin tracking and analyzing the true cost of security breaches. Some
executives only understand the value of security spending when they
understand the actual cost of such a breach to the organization.
Potential Economic Impact
In order to understand the potential economic impact of a security breach,
you have to look at the cost of remediation and the short- and long-term
impact to the organization.The immediate impact of remediation includes
the cost of labor and parts to repair damaged systems, the loss of organiza-
tional productivity during the repair phase, and the impact these repairs
have on the cash ﬂow and ﬁnancial transactions of the company. If your
company is e-commerce-intensive, this impact will likely be even more sig-
niﬁcant.The loss of security around credit card data or the destruction of a
month’s worth of e-commerce transaction data clearly has an economic
impact beyond the cost of repairing the security breach. Look at all areas of
your business where the network and the Internet are factors. (A speciﬁc
plan to assess the risk to your network is discussed later in this book.) At
this point, your goal is to look at the cost of security so that you can make
www.syngress.com

Chapter 1 • IT Security Project Management Building Blocks

a business case to corporate to gain the necessary organizational, political,
and ﬁnancial support you need for your security projects.
The short-term impact of a security breach (e.g., if your e-commerce
site experiences a DOS attack) includes the potential loss of sales and the
potential loss of contracts and relationships with suppliers, vendors, and
key customers. If your organization has suffered a serious and very public
security breach, your sales team might have more difﬁculty closing a big
deal. Clearly, the reputation of the organization suffers and, while it might
be difﬁcult to quantify, it reduces the company’s reputation and associated
“goodwill.”
The long-term impact of a security breach includes the loss of key
customers, the loss of market conﬁdence, and the erosion of share price if
the company is publicly held.The public perception of a company in the
marketplace is not built overnight, but it can be destroyed overnight by an
avoidable security breach.The news is full of recent examples of compa-
nies that inappropriately managed data security and ultimately paid the
price. It is hard to recover from that kind of major security lapse, both in
the real terms of remediation and in the less tangible terms in the minds
of suppliers, customers, shareholders, and the community.
The bottom line is: the more devices attached to your network and
the more reliant your company is on the Internet for doing business, the
more a security breach will cost.The Computer Economics group esti-
mates that if you are highly reliant on the network and the Internet for
your business activities and you have 100 attached devices, the cost of a
security breach is approximately $250,000. If you have 250 devices, the
cost is approximately $500,000.These costs include cleaning infected sys-
tems, recovery from hacks and intrusions, a loss of revenue, and a loss of
employee productivity.As you can see, it becomes much easier to justify
security-related spending when you clearly delineate the cost of not 
doing so.

Business Intelligence…
The Real Cost of Remediation
A quick scan of the headlines will tell you that security breaches are on
the rise. It takes time and effort to stay one step ahead of hackers.
However, a recent report reveals that many companies would rather
spend money cleaning up the aftermath of an attack on their network
security, than deal with it proactively. Security spending is still seen by
some as a giant black hole where money goes in and nothing comes out.
However, a glance at the headlines shows that companies that experience
massive public security breaches end up in trouble with their customers,
their employees, their shareholders, and often the government.
A well-publicized incident in June 2005, involved a serious security
breach by CardSystems, a credit card processing company. The company
was holding on to credit card data it was not supposed to have in order to
“analyze” it. However, the data was not properly secured and 40 million
credit card holders’ personal data was compromised. Credit card compa-
nies had to re-issue millions of credit cards. (MasterCard alone had to re-
issue 13.9 million cards.) CardSystems was sold to another company in
what appeared to be a “ﬁre sale” in September 2005. After reviewing the
incident, the Federal Trade Commission determined there were clear secu-
rity problems and required the company to have an independent security
audit every other year for the next 20 years. This is a classic example of a
security breach that could have been avoided. It started on the inside from
apparently “benign” behavior (i.e., no one initially attempted to hack the
data). The data was stolen because internal procedures violated two areas:
their agreement with credit card companies on how they would handle
customer data, and their decision not to follow appropriate protocols for
monitoring and managing data to ensure its security. (For additional 
information, go to www.consumeraffairs.com/news04/2006/02/ftc_
cardsystems.html.)
A Vermont college system employee on vacation in Canada, had her
laptop stolen from a locked car. The laptop contained personal and ﬁnan-
cial data for over 20,000 Vermont college system employees and stu-
dents. The data was not encrypted. Details about the theft were not

disclosed for three weeks, even though the data at risk included people’s
social security numbers, birth dates, bank account numbers, and payroll
information. A second security breach involved a hacker using an IT staff
person’s e-mail address to send a system-wide message regarding the
stolen laptop. (For additional information, go to http://www.burlington-
freepress.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060409/NEWS01/60409031

A security breach in Spokane, Washington left hundreds of bank and
credit union debit card customers in a tight spot when they were
informed their debit cards had been compromised. New cards and PIN
numbers were issued. The breach cost banks, credit unions, and cus-
tomers thousands of hours for canceling and re-issuing debit cards. The
cost to banks, credit unions, and customers ran into the hundreds of
thousands 
of 
dollars.

Security spending is time and money well spent. Your job as the net-
work administrator is to make the business case for security spending.
One way is to align security goals with business goals. When you tie secu-
rity to business objectives, senior executives are more likely to under-
stand, value, support, and fund security initiatives.
Business Exposure
This section discusses the relative exposure of your business, which will
help you present your business case for security-related spending, and help
you gain critical support for your IT security project. Some business
exposure can be assessed by looking at the following categories and deter-
mining what percentage of your business they comprise:
1. E-commerce Retail Sales If your company sells product via the
Internet, there are numerous security issues that must be addressed.
From Web site security to transaction security, and from credit card
processing to identiﬁable user information, your company has a legal
and ethical obligation to maintain a certain level of security.
2. Business-to-business (B2B) Transactions Some companies only
deal with other businesses (i.e., not the general public).These B2B
transactions are vulnerable to outside and inside attacks. Disruption
of this revenue stream can be devastating, because it can damage a
www.syngress.com
IT Security Project Management Building Blocks • Chapter 1

company’s cash ﬂow and its relationship with key business partners
(i.e., eroding trust and conﬁdence reduces the value of the business 
transaction).
3. Internet Connectivity and Reliance Some companies rely heavily
on the Internet. If your company uses the Internet to connect with
customers, vendors, regulatory authorities, employees, or shareholders,
you must assess the risk of loss or disruption in each of those cate-
gories.The more you rely on the Internet as a business tool, the
greater your need for tight security and additional security funds.
4. Dispersed Workforce. If your company’s employees work from
home, work on the road, connect from airports, coffee shops or
vendor’s locations, your network security needs to take this work-
force model into account.The risks to the network obviously
increase when users are roaming around out in the wild unsecured
world of coffee shop (or hotel) wireless networks and your network
security plan has to account for these types of arrangements.
5. Electronic Data Interchange with Businesses and Consumers
You risk a security breach whenever you exchange data directly
across the Internet.There are numerous technologies that will secure
those exchanges.
6. Data Sensitivity Legislation regarding the privacy of medical his-
tory and other personal data (e.g., social security numbers, credit card
numbers, household income, credit scores, and so on) has expanded.
Any company dealing with conﬁdential personal information must
have strong security processes in place to ensure that the data is han-
dled properly at all stages (i.e., from collection to storage, retrieval,
and analysis). Disruptions in this area can result in serious ﬁnancial
and legal consequences.
Cost of Security
The amount of money spent on security should match the risks associated
with a potential breach of security (e.g., a ﬁnancial ﬁrm has a higher risk
proﬁle than a paper supply company). However, both companies must
www.syngress.com
12
Chapter 1 • IT Security Project Management Building Blocks

assess their risk and decide on a reasonable level of protection.You can
spend a lot of money on security, but at some point your ROI diminishes
because you are outspending your risk.
When planning for the cost of security, evaluate the following:
■
Company size
■
Nature of company business
■
Government regulations
■
Reliance on e-commerce, Internet, and network connectivity
■
Nature of business transactions
■
Business structure (centralized, multiple locations, mobile workforce,
and so on)
■
The tangible and intangible value of the information and

The potential impact of a security breach on the company’s reputa-
tion and bottom line
One point that can be easy to miss in all of this is that your security
really should be calibrated to the value of your company’s data.To use an
analogy, there’s no point on putting a $5,000 alarm system on a 1979
Chevrolet Cavalier that has a rusted out frame and 150,000 miles on it. It’s
probably pretty low on the list of cars that get stolen (no offense intended
toward anyone who owns such a vehicle, but chances are you don’t worry
about it getting hot wired in your driveway). On the other hand, if you
own a $250,000 custom sports car, a $5,000 alarm system might not be
enough.You might also add a low-jack system that disables the engine
when the car is reported stolen and you might also install a GPS tracking
device so you can locate the vehicle if it is stolen.The point is that your
security measures need to really take into account the value of the data
and the potential impact if that data (or network services) are disrupted.
However, since you will have defend your budget, you also need to make
sure your security solution is commensurate with the value of the data
and network services and the relative cost of business disruption.

ROI of Security
Once you have delineated the cost of security threats and security
spending, you can calculate a ROI or do a break-even analysis.The
Computer Economics group determined that for a company with high
exposure to risk factors (e.g., e-commerce companies), the break-even
point for security per device is approximately $375 for a company with
100 devices.The per-device cost is approximately $400 for a company with
500 devices, or about $250,000. For the following example, we use a 100-
device network.The cost for security hardware, software, implementation,
management, and personnel is estimated to be $196,000 for a high risk
company.The cost of a single security breach is estimated at $233,000.
While this appears to be a $37,000 savings, it may not adequately address
the loss of productivity, opportunity costs (e.g.,What else could we have
done with our time if we were not remediating a security breach?) and the
cost of the black mark on your business’s reputation.The numbers show
that the cost of avoiding a problem is less than the cost of ﬁxing a problem.
Put some numbers together for your organization that show the net posi-
tive result of problem avoidance. (For more information on the economics
of computer security, go to www.computereconomics.com.)
Business Intelligence…
The Ultimate Cost of Security
A recently released survey by CompTIA sheds light on the cost of security.
(See The Channel Insider, “Poll: IT Security Training Not a Priority” by
Pedro Periera at http://www.thechannelinsider.com/article2/0,1895,
1934496,00.asp).
According to CompTIA Chief Operating Ofﬁcer (COO) Brian McCarthy,
employers do not invest in enough training; fewer than 25 percent of
employees receive any type of security training. While the investment in
security hardware and software has increased in recent years, the invest-
ment in training has not kept pace, which is alarming when you consider
www.syngress.com

Chapter 1 • IT Security Project Management Building Blocks
Continued

that 80 percent of all security breaches are caused internally, many due to
simple human error. Much of that error can be directly attributed to a lack
of security training. Companies have a false sense of security when they
look at the capital investments they make in hardware and software solu-
tions, but without adequate training on the proper conﬁguration, use,
and maintenance of the security solutions, those capital investments are
wasted. The survey also found that, on average, IT departments spend 2
percent of their time and 5 percent of their budgets on security. That is
pretty low when you consider that the average security breach typically
costs a company approximately 1.5×
what they spend on security 
solutions.
Now for the cold hard truth. According to the Gartner Group, 50
percent of all businesses that suffer a data loss due to an attack or system
failure, go out of business within three years of the attack if they fail to
restore the lost data within 24 hours.
Project Success Factors
In ITPM, we discussed the factors that contribute to project success.These
factors bear repeating because they are signiﬁcant when it comes to IT
security.As we step through these success factors, we will look at them
with an eye toward IT security.As you are reading, you may ﬁnd there are
additional nuances to these elements that are unique to your company or
organization. If so, make a note for future reference. Understanding project
success factors will make your job easier as you plan and implement your
project.
Success Factor 1: Executive Support
The number one success factor of any project is executive support. If
company executives do not understand or care about a project, they will
not allocate the time, money, or resources needed to make it successful.
Most corporate executives are aware of the need for IT security; however,
if management is still not taking IT security seriously enough, you will
have to embark on an education campaign to help them understand the
importance of sound IT security planning. Like an insurance policy, the

cost of having a sound IT security plan it is almost always less than the
cost of not having one.
IT security is not inexpensive.The cost of labor to assess, plan, imple-
ment, manage, monitor, and respond is expensive.Add to that the layers of
hardware and software components needed to keep IT secure, and you
start seeing IT dollars disappear. Without executive support for IT security
planning and implementation, it will be hard to get IT security budgets
approved.
Business Intelligence…
Executive Support 101
In most companies, the easiest way to gain executive support for IT secu-
rity spending is to make the business case for the expenditures. Tying IT
security in with the corporate strategy, mission, values, and goals can help
executives understand and approve needed expenditures. A little aversive
therapy also goes a long way (e.g., get examples of companies, ideally in
your industry or segment, that have had security breaches. Highlight not
only what the ultimate cost of remediation was, but also how embar-
rassing it was to the company. It only takes one or two good examples to
help executives understand that they do not want to pay the clean up cost
when the prevention cost is lower.
Without executive support, IT security initiatives will ultimately fail
because the organization will allocate time and resources to other projects.
There are numerous competing demands and priorities in every company.
If your executive team does not understand or value security initiatives,
you will have an uphill battle. Organizations need to develop a corporate
culture that supports security from the ground up; however, this can only
be created when there is support and active involvement at the top. Most
security breaches happen inside the organization; therefore, developing a
security culture is critical to maintaining IT security. Do your homework,
www.syngress.com
16
Chapter 1 • IT Security Project Management Building Blocks

make the business case, and give your corporate leaders the tools they
need to make informed decisions that support IT security.
Success Factor 2: User Involvement
Most security breaches occur from inside an organization. Some breaches
are intentional and some are completely innocent, but the net result is the
same—security is compromised and the company is put at risk. Users
often view security differently than IT employees, which is why there is
poor communication between the two groups.The user’s view is,“I need
to access everything at the same time.”The IT perspective is,“You need as
little access to as few resources as possible.” Neither perspective in the
extreme is useful; there has to be a balance between the two. By involving
key users in your security planning process, you will have the “real world”
perspective at the table. Hearing user’s objections to security measures will
allow you to modify them accordingly.
A good example of that balance is password policies. If you require a 10-
digit minimum length password that must be changed every two days,
there is a high likelihood that users will write the passwords down at their
desks so that they do not forget them.This type of security circumvention
occurs because the users were not consulted when the security policies
were created. In most cases, however, if you can ﬁnd a balance between
the user’s needs and the security needs of the organization, you are more
likely to see higher user compliance. When you involve key users in the
process, you avoid having them circumvent policies that are too stringent
and you avoid having to revise your policy after it fails.
Success Factor 3: Experienced Project Manager
In the case of IT security, it is critical that the project manager have expe-
rience successfully managing projects, since any errors or omissions in a
security plan can have serious consequences.A project manager using a
proven, consistent project management methodology is more likely to
generate a solid IT security project plan than one who has no consistent
method for approaching an IT project. If you are the project manager for
www.syngress.com
IT Security Project Management Building Blocks • Chapter 1
17

your company’s IT security project and you are not an experienced pro-
ject manager, look within your organization or your professional associa-
tions for a mentor to assist you in developing your plan. Depending on
the size and scope of your project, you may choose to hire an experienced
consultant to work side-by-side with, so that you can avoid some of the
common pitfalls inexperienced IT project managers face.
Success Factor 4: 
Clearly Deﬁned Project Objectives
Successful projects begin with clear deﬁnitions of what the project entails.
More often than not, an unsuccessful project lacks a clear, concise deﬁni-
tion.You typically begin by identifying the problem and then identifying
the desired outcome (or mission) of the project. By identifying the
problem that is driving the need for this project along with the desired (or
required) outcome, you will identify the gap between what is and what
needs to be. From there, you are in a better position to clearly deﬁne pro-
ject objectives.The key is that the objectives be clear and unambiguous.
You should ideally develop three to ﬁve major objectives for your security
project. (Deﬁning project objectives is discussed in more detail later in this
book.)
Business Intelligence…
The Power of Clarity
In my consulting work, I often see people launch into projects without a
clear sense of direction, whether the project is self-initiated or handed to
them by a client, boss, or co-worker. Stepping back and asking what out-
come you are trying to achieve and what the major objectives are will
bring clarity to your project. When deﬁning your IT security project, you
want to deﬁne three to ﬁve major objectives that will drive IT security for
your ﬁrm. Be very clear about what you are trying to achieve and you will
have a much better chance of achieving it.

Chapter 1 • IT Security Project Management Building Blocks

Success Factor 5: 
Clearly Deﬁned (and Smaller) Scope
Studies consistently show that projects that are clearly deﬁned and smaller
in scope are more successful than those that are not. Whenever you start a
project, you should always begin with the project objectives.The planning
process should develop your top three to ﬁve high-level objectives into
smaller tasks that eventually deﬁne your entire project from start to ﬁnish.
When a project is clearly deﬁned, it is easier to see if it is missing any ele-
ments or if it is hitting the mark.
Another success element is having a smaller scope.A scope is deﬁned
as the total amount of work to be accomplished for a project.The smaller
the scope, the more likely that the project will be successful.The bigger
the project, the more elements there are, resulting in the likelihood that
one or more of them will be overlooked. In recognition of this important
success factor, this book approaches IT security as a series of project plans,
not one big plan.The overarching IT security plan includes sub-plans for
each IT security area.To some extent, each of those sub-plans can be
managed as separate plans. By deﬁning sub-plans for each individual secu-
rity area, you can accomplish two important goals: 1) you can assign the
right people to the project based on their areas of expertise, and 2) you
can focus intently on that aspect of security so that all of the key elements
are addressed.
Success Factor 6: 
Shorter Schedules, Multiple Milestones
With a smaller scope come shorter schedules.Again, this is fairly intuitive.
It is hard to plan far into the future because so many intervening factors
can arise over the course of 6, 9, or 12 months. Keeping shorter schedules
means reducing project scope. One of the ways to do this with IT security
is to divide your security planning into segments (as we have done for 
this book.)
www.syngress.com
IT Security Project Management Building Blocks • Chapter 1
19

Another interesting statistic is that projects with multiple milestones
are far more successful than those with few milestones. By deﬁnition, a
milestone is a marker in a project plan that indicates a signiﬁcant event. It
can be a checkpoint to ensure everything is on track, or it can be a check-
point that indicates that some external event must be completed before
the project can proceed. It is like directions to a location you have never
been to before. If you read them once before heading out, you are likely
to get lost along the way. On the other hand, if you read the directions
along the way, you are more likely to turn left when you should turn left
and right when you should turn right. Multiple milestones help you navi-
gate time and schedules more effectively.
Success Factor 7: Clearly 
Deﬁned Project Management Process
If you use a consistent process for deﬁning, implementing, and managing
projects, you are more likely to produce successful projects.Again, it is a
process that should be implemented to help ensure that you include key
elements in the right order at the right time. If you do not have a consis-
tent project management process, you should develop one. (ITPM pro-
vides a methodology that you can use to cover the key elements of project
planning.)
Success Factor 8: Standard Infrastructure
When developing your IT security project plan, look for opportunities to
use standardized components, from software and hardware infrastructure
elements to templates and off-the-shelf solutions. Carefully analyze the cost
of purchasing infrastructure versus creating your own. Small- and medium-
sized companies often fall victim to the “it costs too much” mentality
when looking at off-the-shelf solutions to incorporate into their products
or projects. However, if you add in the cost of errors, omissions, re-work,
and cost and schedule overruns, you will probably ﬁnd that purchasing
these components or elements is a better business decision, even if it costs
more than you expected. In addition, re-using standard templates and sec-

tions of IT project plans for your IT security plan enables you to avoid
reinventing the wheel and will yield more consistent results over time.
Project Constraints
This section covers project constraints as they pertain to IT security pro-
ject planning. If this is not a concept you are familiar with, refer to
Chapter 1 in ITPM for a more detailed explanation.
Every project has four constraints: scope, time, cost, and quality.The
relationship between these elements is described by different people in
different ways, but the essential understanding is that there is a relationship
between these elements.The total amount of work that can be accom-
plished (scope) is determined by how much time you have, how much
you are willing to spend, and what level of quality is required. Conversely,
the amount of time you need to complete a project is related to what you
are willing to spend, what level of quality is required, and how much work
you need to accomplish.The relationship is often shown in this manner:
Scope = Time x Cost x Quality
Let’s look at the reverse of this. If you deﬁne a project and your divi-
sion manager says that it is ﬁne except you have to reduce the cost by 30
percent, you are forced to make some hard decisions.You can reduce the
scope of work to reduce the cost, or you can reduce the quality to reduce
the cost. If you change one of the constraints you also have to change
another one. Changing one constraint without revisiting the others sets
the project up for failure.
The scope of an IT security project can be deﬁned by the IT security
master plan or sub-plans. Reducing the scope allows you to reduce the
time and cost of the project while still delivering high quality. Ideally, you
should create an IT security project plan overview and then create sepa-
rate sub-plans, which will allow you to manage the scope, time, cost, and
quality more effectively.
www.syngress.com
IT Security Project Management Building Blocks • Chapter 1
21

In addition to understanding the interaction of the four constraints
in a project, it is also important to understand how to prioritize those
constraints. In every project, one constraint is typically “etched in stone”
(e.g., the executive team tells you that your project cannot exceed
$100,000 or that it must be completed within 6 months maximum).
When you have this type of constraint, you have to make the other con-
straints more flexible. For example, suppose that in 12 months your
company is going public through an Initial Public Offering (IPO).As
part of the rigorous process, your company wants to make sure its net-
work security is firmly in place at least 6 months prior to the IPO.
Therefore, you are given 6 months to put your network security plan in
place. Depending on a number of factors (e.g., how large your network
is, what security is already in place), you may determine that 6 months is
manageable only if you hire outside security consultants for assistance.
That means that because time is the top priority and least flexible con-
straint in this project, you have to be more flexible with the other con-
straints. In this case, the cost will probably increase to accommodate the
constraint. If the company executives are inflexible on all four con-
straints, the project will probably fail.
There is a saying in project management that states,“Things are more
likely to go wrong than they are to go right.” If the four project con-
straints are etched in stone, you have little chance for success. Increase
your odds by negotiating with the executive team for one or more ﬂexible
constraints.That doesn’t mean they open the checkbook and let you
spend without limit. It does mean that they will need to understand that
with a hard deadline that is fairly aggressive, they will have to give on the
cost or the scope. If they refuse, the result will be what typically happens
in many organizations.The team agrees to unrealistic targets because it
really has no choice and then it fails to meet those targets because they
were unrealistic.The plan changes in the middle of the project because
something has to give way. Saying that it’s not allowed to happen doesn’t
prevent it from happening. Negotiate up front for realistic parameters and
priorities so that everyone beneﬁts.

Chapter 1 • IT Security Project Management Building Blocks

Corporate Strategy and IT Security
What does corporate strategy have to do with IT security? Suppose that
over the next three to ﬁve years, your ﬁrm’s strategy is to gain market
share through the strategic acquisition of targeted companies in select
geographic regions of the U.S.As network administrator, you must ensure
that your corporate IT assets are protected today, while also making sure
that new locations can be incorporated in the future. Each company
acquired has its own network infrastructure, security policies, and tools for
managing security. How you seamlessly integrate these acquisitions into
your company and still keep all IT assets secure should be part of your IT
security project plan.
Let’s look at another example.Your company manufactures several
products that are sold by mass merchandisers around the world.To remain
competitive against the inﬂux of low-cost alternatives to your products,
your company decides it needs to improve its supply chain and distribu-
tion channel management. Part of that initiative involves providing sup-
pliers and customers with real-time access to production and shipping
data.This initiative would impact IT security by opening your network to
vendors on one side and customers on the other, thereby exposing your
network to a host of new, potential security problems.
It is critical that you are intimately aware of your company’s short-
and long-term strategies in order to effectively plan, implement, and
manage IT security. If you do not understand how IT resources are used
today and how they will be used tomorrow, you will not be able to
create and manage a successful IT security project. Reworking a plan is
expensive and results in a lot of wasted time and effort. Rework can be
reduced by looking ahead at corporate strategies, at where your company
is headed. If you align your IT security project with corporate goals at
the project outset, you avoid some rework.That said, the business world is
a dynamic environment and it is guaranteed that plans will change. If you
start out closely aligned, you may be able to make minor modiﬁcations
rather than wholesale changes to your security plan.

How Corporate Culture 
and Policies Impact IT Security
In addition to clearly understanding and aligning with your company’s
strategies, you also need to understand its culture and policies. Every com-
pany has a unique culture. Some companies have a very lax “we are all
friends here” culture, where rules are few and seldom enforced. Others
have very formal “buttoned down” cultures, where managers are addressed
as “Mr. Brown” or “Ms. Black,” and where rules are many and conscien-
tiously enforced and obeyed. If your IT security policy does not address
the reality of your corporate culture, it will not be effective. If you estab-
lish 52 rules of network security in a company where things run rather
fast and loose, 51 of those rules will be disregarded whenever possible.You
cannot single-handedly change your corporate culture, but you can inﬂu-
ence it greatly when it comes to IT security. If you educate executives and
users about the importance of IT security and how it affects them, you are
more likely to gain their support and compliance.The reverse is also true.
If you work in an environment where rules and regulations sometimes
overwhelm even the simplest business process, you may need to make a
case for having a more relaxed environment.Again, the complex password
scenario is the one that consistently comes to mind. If you require pass-
words that look like x%v93P!2m5>6, users are going to write them down
even if it is against the rules.
Company policies also come into play when creating an IT security
plan. Does your company require a background check on employees who
handle money, manage conﬁdential personnel ﬁles, or who have full
administrative rights on the network? Does your company have policies in
place that address current regulatory requirements such as Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) or Sarbanes-Oxley
(SOX)? If so, your IT security plans should also address these policies.
Reviewing corporate policies will help you align your IT security with
the requirements and realities of your company. Make sure you include
legal, ﬁnancial, and human resources representatives on the IT security

24
Chapter 1 • IT Security Project Management Building Blocks

project team, which will help ensure policies related to network security
are properly addressed.
And ﬁnally, if you include users (Success Factor #2) in your security
planning project, you are much more likely to strike a balance between
the need for tight network security and the need for users to easily access
the necessary resources. If you neglect to bring users into the mix until
you are ready to implement the security solution, you will probably ﬁnd
that users are more resistant because you are simply “laying down the law.”
A collaborative approach, while taking more time in the planning stages,
generates a better result and reduces problems in the implementation
stage.The cost of making changes to a project in the planning stage is sig-
niﬁcantly less than making changes in the implementation stage; therefore,
including users early in the process will save you time and money in the
long run.

Summary
In this chapter, we looked at the underlying rationale for why it is impor-
tant to have a sound IT security project plan prior to implementing IT
security solutions. Every IT initiative must be funded, and IT security is
no exception. While most executives understand the risks in today’s con-
nected world, many are still reluctant to authorize IT budget increases or
to wholeheartedly support security initiatives.Your job is to make a busi-
ness case for IT security spending through developing a sound analysis of
the economic impact of a potential security breach, the risk proﬁle of
your company, and the cost of prevention. With this data, you can develop
an approximate ROI calculation that will make sense to any corporate
executive.
We also looked at the success factors of security projects. Executive
support is key for two primary reasons. First, they have to authorize the
ﬁnancial expenditures. Second, without their support, the project is likely
to fall off the list of key initiatives or corporate priorities, which means
you will eventually be scrambling to ﬁnd the time and resources needed
to complete the project. User involvement is the second success factor.
Involving users early in the planning process may seem like a major
inconvenience; however, their involvement will help ensure that the
implementation phase of your project goes more smoothly. Ultimately,
user involvement will help you create a better project plan. Other success
factors include having an experienced project manager who can ensure
that the project scope, time, and processes are well-managed.
Each project has four constraints, which must be balanced and priori-
tized. It is important to understand that if you increase the scope, you also
have to change one or more of the project’s other constraints. Conversely,
if you reduce the budget, you also have to change one or more of the
project’s constraints. It is also helpful to understand the priorities of these
constraints. If there is a hard budget or a hard deadline, the other project
constraints must be ﬂexible to accommodate the inevitable problems and
changes that occur during the implementation phase of the project.
www.syngress.com
26
Chapter 1 • IT Security Project Management Building Blocks

Mandating all four constraints results in project failure on one or more
fronts.
Another critical element to the success of your IT security project is
understanding where your company is headed to in the future. If you craft
an IT security plan that fails to account for possible future activities of
your company, you will have to continually change your plan or you will
have gaping security holes. Rather than continually reworking your plan,
try to determine where your company is headed in the next three years
and then plan accordingly. While this will not eliminate change to your IT
security plan, it should help reduce it to a minimum.
As you develop your IT security policy, look at your company’s cul-
ture. While you may have to implement new rules and regulations where
none exist, you should try to align your security planning with the corpo-
rate culture to the greatest degree possible. When you do, you increase the
likelihood that users will comply with IT security requirements.You may
also need to work collaboratively with various stakeholders within the
organization (e.g., Human Resources, Finance, Legal and so on) to ensure
that the IT security policies match the corporate culture and the existing
company rules, regulations, policies, and legal requirements. Creating an IT
security policy in a vacuum will yield less than optimal results, if not out-
right failure.

The True Cost of IT Security
 According to FBI statistics, 80 percent of corporate security breaches
occur from within the organization.
 Despite the initial cost of security hardware, software, and planning,
prevention is usually less expensive than remediation.
 Many ﬁrms fail to take into account the “soft” costs of security
breaches, including opportunity costs, cost to the reputation of the
ﬁrm, and residual costs in the marketplace.

 When making a business case for IT security spending, assess the
economic impact of a security breach, determine your company’s
level of risk, determine the cost of prevention and the value of the
data, and calculate the ROI.
 Many companies fail to provide adequate training; errors account for
a majority of security breaches.Training is key to the successful
implementation of a security plan.
 Fifty percent of all businesses that suffer an attack or data loss go out
of business within three years if they fail to recover from the data
loss within 24 hours.
IT Security Project Success Factors
 Executive support is key to the success of all projects, but even more
so to IT projects that require capital expenditures and cultural and
political support.
 If users are not involved with the decisions regarding security
implementation, there is a high likelihood that they will fail to
comply or will actively seek ways to circumvent security.
 An experienced project manager contributes to IT security project
success in many ways.Among them, he or she helps to clearly deﬁne
project objectives, manage the scope of the project, create
meaningful milestones, and develop project processes that foster
success.
 Whenever possible, standardizing project infrastructure reduces the
cost and time of the project. If you can reuse tools, processes, or
methods from other projects, or if you can implement standardized
tools or equipment, your projects will typically generate better results
by reducing the learning curve and ramp-up time (which often leads
to errors and omissions).

Chapter 1 • IT Security Project Management Building Blocks

Project Constraints
 All projects have four constraints that must be balanced throughout
the project.The scope (total amount of work to be done), the cost
(budget), the time (schedule), and the quality.
 If you increase or reduce any element, one or more of the other
constraints must change. If you reduce the cost of the project, you
must increase the time or reduce the scope or quality of the project.
 Studies have consistently shown that projects that are shorter in
length and smaller in scope tend to be more successful. One useful
strategy is dividing your total IT security plan into multiple sub-
plans.You can keep an eye on the overall IT security picture through
a master IT security plan with multiple sub-plans incorporated.
 Gain agreement as to project priorities prior to the start of the
project. Negotiate for one or more ﬂexible constraints, since
mandating all four constraints almost always results in the project
failing to meet those parameters.
Corporate Strategy and IT Security
 While developing your IT security plan, you must take into account
your company’s strategy.
 Understanding where your company is headed and how it plans on
getting there will enable you to develop an IT security plan that will
meet the current and future needs of the organization.
 Developing an IT security plan that addresses the company’s short-
and long-term goals is important, but keep in mind that companies
have to remain ﬂexible and nimble to survive in today’s global
economy.Your IT security plans should be equally nimble to address
the constant change your ﬁrm is experiencing.

disregard the corporate culture when developing an IT security

Introduction
This chapter discusses the initial steps for creating an Information
Technology (IT) security project plan using standard project management
methods.This chapter introduces the concepts you need to create both
the  overall corporate IT security project plan and the individual plans
(ISAPs) that you’ll ﬁnd toward the end of this book beginning in
Chapter 9. As we step through the project management elements in this
chapter, we’re going to keep it short and sweet because each of these ele-
ments will be repeated again in each of the security project plans
included starting in Chapter 9.
Deﬁning the Security Problem
The ﬁrst step in developing a solid IT security project plan is to deﬁne
the problem. We can easily state that the problem is that “our networks
are not secure or that there are assets in the organization that need to be
protected from intentional and unintentional attack.”Those statements are
true on the macro level, meaning that these general statements apply to
almost every organization (and computer) in the world. However, every
company is different and every organization has its own unique set of
security vulnerabilities to consider.Applying a one-size-ﬁts-all approach
to network security will simply not work.
As discussed in Chapter 1, an effective way to approach IT security is
to create a corporate security plan that includes the individual focus areas
of security (e.g., infrastructure, wireless). Breaking down each of the seg-
ments into smaller, individual focus areas allows you to better manage
each aspect of security.Another challenge you will encounter is that there
are many areas that overlap (i.e., does physical access fall under opera-
tional security, infrastructure security, or general security?) Creating a cor-
porate IT security plan and individual plans gives you the opportunity to
review your overall security project plan to ensure that all critical security
elements are addressed.

Chapter 2 • Deﬁning the Security Project

Let’s begin with a review of some of the industry’s standard deﬁni-
tions and focus areas of security that you can use to create your security
project plan.
Network Security and the CIA 
An easy way to begin looking at network security is via the well-known
acronym “CIA” which stands for conﬁdentiality, integrity and availability.
These are the three overarching areas of network security that touch
upon every network component from ﬁrewalls to user passwords. Let’s
look at these in detail so you can begin formulating your network secu-
rity problem statement.
Conﬁdentiality
Conﬁdentiality refers to preventing the unauthorized access, disclosure, and
use of information, and is part of the broader concept of privacy. Every
company has different conﬁdentiality needs (e.g., a hotel must keep guest
room and credit card numbers and home addresses private; a beverage
company must keep its product formula secret; an online retailer must
keep customers’ shopping data private; and an online search company
must keep the user search data private).
Conﬁdentiality is maintained through user authentication and access
control. User authentication ensures that the person trying to access the
data is authorized.Access control is the process of deﬁning which users
and groups should have access to the data. In combination, these mecha-
nisms help ensure the conﬁdentiality of data; however, there is little you
can do to guarantee conﬁdentiality without the users’ participation,
agreement, and compliance. User awareness, training, and education are
vital components of any security solution, and typically part of a com-
pany-wide awareness, training, and education initiative. In the larger
scheme of things, conﬁdentiality has to do with how users handle and
www.syngress.com
Deﬁning the Security Project • Chapter 2
33

utilize conﬁdential data and these are often elements of regulatory issues
such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996
(HIPAA).These are typically part of a company-wide awareness, training
and education initiative in which the IT department should participate.
Integrity
In the IT world, integrity refers to the reliability and trustworthiness of the
information. Data integrity refers to the need to retain or preserve the
information (without alteration or corruption) from source to destina-
tion. Source integrity refers to the veriﬁcation process that is involved in
ensuring that the data came from the correct source rather than from an
imposter or a “man-in-the-middle (MITM).” Finally, integrity also refers
to whether or not the correct data was initially entered, and whether the
calculation or action will yield the same result each time.
While there is a “user” component to integrity, securing the network
so that data and the sources of data cannot be altered is an IT function.
Availability
Most companies rely heavily on computers and networks, and the data
that resides there. Availability is a critical function for companies that rely
on electronic data and communications. Like data and network integrity,
availability is an IT function (e.g., making sure the network is up and
running, the data is available to the right users at the right time, the Web
sites and Internet resources are available to the appropriate parties).Your
IT security plan must also account for when users inadvertently lock up
records in a database, server hard drives crash, routers fail, or hackers hack.
CIA in Context
How much security is enough to ensure CIA? To answer this question,
we use this analogy:“How much security do you need in your personal
life?”A lot of people that live in the country know their neighbors and
do not lock their cars or homes. Contrast that with people who live in
www.syngress.com
34
Chapter 2 • Deﬁning the Security Project

urban settings where cars are stolen and homes are burglarized.The
amount of security the city dweller needs is different than what the
country resident needs.The point is, you cannot decide how much secu-
rity is enough without ﬁrst putting everything in context.The same holds
true for companies. We all expect our bank to have extremely tight secu-
rity not only because of the risk of ﬁnancial loss but the potential for
identity theft as well.A manufacturer of screen doors may have a fairly
low need for security because they may not handle data much more
complex and conﬁdential than last year’s sales numbers. Granted, you may
not want these publicly divulged (if you’re a privately held ﬁrm), but you
wouldn’t implement the same types of security systems your bank should.
In Chapter 3, we’ll discuss developing project objectives and we’ll speciﬁ-
cally talk about the security assessment.A security assessment (or audit)
will help clarify the speciﬁc problem areas in your organization so that
you can ﬁne-tune your security project plan to address any shortfalls.
Business Intelligence…
One Size Fits None
It is very important that you to take the time to clearly deﬁne your orga-
nization’s unique security proﬁle before implementing any plans or solu-
tions. There are thousands of companies selling all kinds of security
solutions. Clearly, some are better than others, but more importantly,
some are more appropriate for your company than others. You need to
determine how much time, money, and effort should be expended to
develop the appropriate security solution. If you do not have a clear idea
of your security needs before you start shopping for hardware, software,
or a security consultant, you may be talked into a solution that is too
big, too small (rarely), too expensive, or not appropriate for your ﬁrm.

Deﬁne the Problem
Now that you have an overview of the major security elements to be
considered, you can begin to deﬁne your IT security project plan
problem statement.The information you considered as you read the pre-
vious section should have helped you begin to see how you can deﬁne
your problem statement. While yours will be unique, we’ve provided a
few samples for you to use as starting points. Be sure the problem state-
ment matches your organization’s real needs. Be sure you’re focusing on
the overarching corporate IT security plan. We’ll work on problem state-
ments in the smaller, more focused security plans later in the book.The
sample statements below are just starting points.You don’t need to spend
days thinking up your problem statement, but you should hit the major
points.As we continue to reﬁne our project plan, we’ll continue to add
detail to the plan that should help you address all needed areas of IT
security for your ﬁrm. Don’t add the “laundry list” here, try to create a
clear, concise overview of the corporate IT security situation that is
causing you to take on this project. While your security project plan will
be unique to your organization, the following are good starting points:
■
My company works with highly conﬁdential data that is currently
exposed to potentially inappropriate internal and external access,
use, and distribution.
■
My company lacks a comprehensive approach to IT security, and
the network assets are at risk.There is  no system in place to ensure
that only authorized users can access conﬁdential data. We also lack
a consistent method for monitoring network access to certain
resources.
■
My company’s security measures were put in place on an “as
needed” basis; we have never done a comprehensive review of the
security measures. Since the company has both internal and external
employees that access conﬁdential data while working remotely, we
need to ensure that our security policies and practices protect the
corporate assets.

Chapter 2 • Deﬁning the Security Project

As you can see, it doesn’t take a rocket scientist to write a problem
statement that will get you going. If you’re a detail-oriented person, you
might want to deﬁne your problem more speciﬁcally. However, at this
point, we’re really just taking a high-level look at the problem. Later, we’ll
dig into the detail because part of every IT security project plan is
making an assessment of the current network and current security mea-
sures. Rather than repeat that, we’ll mention it here and return to it later.
Deﬁning the Outcome
If you know what the problem is, you can identify the desired outcome.
This is where you begin deﬁning how much security is appropriate for
your organization. If your security meets the highest level of government
security standards, you are setting the bar extremely high. However, if
your company is a regional retailer of shoes, it is probably too much secu-
rity.Taking the time to clearly identify your desired outcome can help
you deﬁne the right level of security for your organization.Your security
project plan should incorporate elements speciﬁc to your network and to
your company.The mission statement deﬁnes what the overall end result
should look like.The following are good starting points.
■
Our security solution should take into account the need to secure
all network data. We must be compliant with the Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) standards. Our security
solution should prevent unauthorized access at all branch locations,
and monitor access to conﬁdential data ﬁles. Our auditing systems
should be able to spot unusual access or trafﬁc patterns.
■
Our security project plan should secure corporate network
resources while providing customers with fast and easy access to the
Internet through our wireless network connections.
■
Our ﬁrm requires extremely high data security to prevent unautho-
rized access, use, retrieval, sharing, forwarding, removal, or modiﬁca-
www.syngress.com
Deﬁning the Security Project • Chapter 2
37

tion of conﬁdential research and development data. If this data were
stolen by competitors, the ﬁnancial losses would be staggering and
could potentially put the company out of business.
■
The desired outcome is to provide a reasonable level of security for
the network while keeping administration and day-to-day moni-
toring tasks to a minimum. In addition, we want to prevent unau-
thorized network access, virus infection, and malicious software
(malware) installation.
As you can see, these statements vary greatly.The last one indicates
that a less rigorous security solution would probably be just ﬁne.The ﬁrst
item indicates there are potential legal ramiﬁcations (HIPAA) of a secu-
rity breach.This would indicate a need for a stronger security solution.
Matching the value (tangible and intangible) of your company’s data and
the severity of the impact of a potential breach or outage with the pro-
posed solution will help you deﬁne the optimal solution for your 
company.
Deﬁning Potential 
Security Project Solutions
In traditional project management, once you have defined the problem
and the desired outcome, you begin thinking about potential security
project solutions, which is done by brainstorming ideas and narrowing
the resulting list down to the solutions that fit both the problem and
the outcome.The list of choices is further narrowed by looking at
which potential solution is the most viable for your specific circum-
stances. In this case, you cannot identify potential solutions until you
identify the required components of security.The objective at this stage
is to identify (at the corporate IT security project level) the relative
scope of your project.Another potential solution might be to hire a
security expert, or you might decide to send one or more IT staff to
www.syngress.com
38
Chapter 2 • Deﬁning the Security Project

security training programs.The reason you’re spending time looking at
this is to help you develop an idea of the scope of your project and the
possible solutions you could employ. If you don’t spend time reviewing
all potential options, you might miss finding the most optimal solution
possible. Don’t start from a limited point of view, start from the position
that “all things are possible” and we’ll narrow down the choices later.
Keep in mind that your security solutions will be modular. What is
appropriate for your overall corporate IT security solution may not be
appropriate for individual security project plans.A good solution may
be to hire a security consultant to do an extensive security audit and
make recommendations. However, your optimal solution for the wire-
less security plan will be different. If you have no expertise, you should
hire a consultant to implement your wireless security plan and train
your IT staff. If you have a lot of experience, you might hire an outside
consultant just to review your staff’s plan.
The key here is understanding that different segments of the plan,
while interrelated, should be addressed individually.The optimal solu-
tion for one security area might not be right for another.Your optimal
solutions should be based on your company’s business, industry, current
infrastructure, and risk profile, as well as your IT team’s proven exper-
tise.Take an unbiased look at the optimal solutions so that you can
develop the best solution for your company.
Deﬁning the Optimal 
Security Project Solution
At this point, you understand your overall security problem and the
desired outcome.You’ve looked at all possible security solutions and
made a list. Now, you need to review your list of possible solutions and
narrow it down to the most optimal solution. Notice we still haven’t
identified or considered constraints such as time or money. If we start
with limited options, we might miss finding the best option, so we start
www.syngress.com
Deﬁning the Security Project • Chapter 2
39

with all possible solutions and look for the very best one given what we
know about our company. For example, your company may have a cul-
ture that supports hiring the best and the brightest, then your best solu-
tion might be to go find the best IT security person on the planet. If
your company is always running on a shoestring or has a culture that
supports “homegrown” initiatives, you may choose to hire or train IT
security staff.
You may not be able to identify the optional security solution until
you do an assessment. IT project management is an iterative process; as
you receive new information, you have to make modiﬁcations to previous 
deﬁnitions.
The good news here is that once you’ve done all this high level work
for your corporate IT security project, it will be easier to do these same
steps for your smaller, individual security area project plans.
Applying Security Project Constraints
You have looked at optimal options, and now you have to adjust your
plans accordingly. Every project has four constraints: scope, time, cost, and
quality. If your IT security budget is slashed by 25 percent, you will have
to adjust your budget accordingly. If you reduce cost, you will typically
have to reduce the scope, quality, or increase time. Quality is often sacri-
ﬁced, which can have serious consequences in the security arena.You will
have to make some hard decisions.The following sections review the
security project plan constraints and how they apply to your corporate IT
security master plan and your individual security project plans.
Scope (Amount of Work)
The scope is the total amount of work to be accomplished. If you have a
tight budget, you may decide to focus on the three major security areas
that will be the foundation of your security project plan (i.e., identiﬁca-
tion and authentication, auditing, and malicious code protection).You
www.syngress.com
40
Chapter 2 • Deﬁning the Security Project

may also decide to deﬁne several phases so that you can cover the most
pressing security needs ﬁrst, and then add additional elements in smaller
security project plans. Choose your scope carefully to ensure that the cor-
porate assets are covered. If your scope does not cover the most important
and vulnerable assets, you may have to request a larger budget (see
Chapter 1). One of the worst mistakes you can make is deﬁning, plan-
ning, and implementing a security plan that does not cover the key areas.
If you cannot implement the security project plan necessary for your
company, document the risks and bring it to your manager’s attention.
Make sure the decision makers know what the impact of their decision
will be on the IT department.They rely on your expertise; if you silently
accept budget or timeline cuts, you are doing your company a disservice.
Be professional but clear about the implications of failing to implement
the full scope of a security project plan.
Time (Schedule)
Everyone always wants projects completed as quickly as possible. Every
project requires a certain amount of time to complete.A schedule is
developed after you deﬁne the work to be accomplished and compile the
necessary resources. If you have to shorten your schedule, you might have
to reduce the project’s scope and quality, or increase the budget to allow
you to purchase additional time-saving tools or hire additional staff. In
traditional project management, there is the concept of “crashing the
schedule,” which means running things in parallel. In security project
plans, the danger is in leaving a gap or making an error.As you go
through the project planning process in this book, assume that “crashing
the schedule” is not an option. In addition, make sure you allow plenty of
time for testing, which is one of the best quality control tools you can
use.You may also choose to hire additional staff to test your security solu-
tions and to purposely look for ways to break your security.

Deﬁning the Security Project • Chapter 2
41

Cost
IT departments are being asked to do more with less money, even as IT
budgets have increased.The amount of spending on security is, on average,
approximately 5 to 10 percent of IT budgets, which is not much when
you consider the cost of a security breach. If you are forced to reduce your
budget, you will have to ﬁnd creative ways to address the shortfall (e.g.,
“borrow” staff from other departments, re-use or re-purpose tools you
already own). If your budget is cut, you will have to reduce the scope or
the quality of your project.Also, the amount of time the project takes
might have to be reduced to address the budget issues, or you might have
to increase the amount of time needed to complete the project in order to
avoid overtime costs.
At the risk of repetition, be very careful about agreeing to implement
a security plan that lacks sufﬁcient scope, time or money.At the end of
the day, everyone will forget what the agreed upon scope, budget or
schedule was and they’ll come looking for you when that security breach
occurs. No one will remember the discussion you had six months ago
about the risk of implementing a lower cost security plan. What they’ll
remember is that you and your team implemented the plan and it didn’t
work. Of course on the ﬂip side, if you successfully implement a plan and
no security problems ever occur, don’t expect a pat on the back or a
letter of congratulations.The absence of a problem is rarely rewarded, but
at least you and your team will sleep better at night knowing your net-
work and corporate data are as secure as they reasonably can be.
Quality
The quality of an IT security project plan often comes down to the
amount of testing and review that is done prior to, during, and after pro-
ject implementation.
www.syngress.com
42
Chapter 2 • Deﬁning the Security Project

Now that you have reviewed the project constraints for your IT secu-
rity project plan, you can compare them to your optimal solution and
revise it as needed. If your optimal solution is too expensive or will take
too long, you will have to modify your solution to ﬁt within the project
constraints. Conversely, if you feel strongly that your optimal solution is
exactly what your company needs, prepare a brief document outlining
why this security solution is the right one for your company and why the
resources should be expended to implement it. Be clear, concise, and fac-
tual. Document the risks associated with not implementing the optimal
solution, so that your manager or the company’s executive team can make
an informed decision. Clearly delineate the risks of not implementing the
best solution for your company.
Finally, it is important to note that you may not know exactly what
your security project plan constraints are at this juncture in the security
project planning process. Some companies require a proposal, the assump-
tion being that the more impressive the proposal the bigger the budget.
In some cases, you cannot write an intelligent proposal until you under-
stand the constraints. If you do not have speciﬁc data regarding your IT
security project’s constraints, list your assumptions.That way when you
submit your proposal, you have a starting point with which to negotiate.
Business Intelligence…
Setting Security Priorities Based on Constraints
In a perfect world, we would have all the time, money, and resources
needed for our projects. The reality is that there are always limitations to
contend with. As you begin deﬁning your security project plan and
understanding the project constraints, you will get a better idea of the
project’s constraint priorities (e.g., if you are told you need to implement
a security plan quickly, you might believe that the highest priority is time
(schedule). If that is the case, you either have to reduce the scope to
ﬁnish the security project plan quickly, or you have to increase the
www.syngress.com
Deﬁning the Security Project • Chapter 2
43
Continued

budget to hire additional staff to help plan and implement the project.
However, don’t assume that because you keep hearing how quickly this
project needs to happen that time is the highest priority. In fact, cost
might still be your highest priority in terms of what to focus on even
though everyone’s harping on time.
To verify your assumptions you can test the waters by asking, “If we
need to get this done quickly, I’m assuming we’ll have a budget that
supports overtime and hiring outside help. Is that correct?” If you
believe budget is the priority, test the waters by stating, “Since we are
working with a limited budget, the amount of work we can get done will
also be limited. I’m assuming that is acceptable.” These kinds of tests
help you push the boundaries to ﬁnd out where the real limitations are.
You need to understand the priorities so that when push comes to
shove, you will know on what basis to make decisions. To run a suc-
cessful project, you need to know how to allocate resources and how to
make decisions based on priorities. If cost is the primary constraint, you
might increase the length of the security project plan or decrease the
scope. If time is the primary constraint and you incorrectly assume that
cost is the constraint, your decisions will create problems for all 
concerned.
Developing the 
Security Project Proposal
Once the preliminary work is done, you can develop a security project
proposal and use it to negotiate a bigger budget or a longer timeline, or
to discuss security project constraints. In either case, develop a security
project proposal that will be the basis of your overall security project
planning.This document should contain the following elements, at min-
imum:
■
Project name
■
Proposal date
■
Project manager
■
Problem statement
www.syngress.com
44
Chapter 2 • Deﬁning the Security Project

■
Mission or outcome statement
■
Proposed solution
■
Project constraints (if known)
■
Desired security project completion date
■
Initial proposed Budget (if known)
■
Other relevant information
Once this proposal is developed, bring it to your security project plan
sponsor for approval.The format of the proposal depends largely on what
is generally accepted in your ﬁrm. Some companies have a formal culture
that requires a printed, bound document be provided to the security pro-
ject plan sponsor. Other companies have an informal culture where a
quick e-mail might sufﬁce. Regardless of how the proposal is captured, be
sure that two things occur:
■
The proposal is written clearly and concisely.
■
The proposal is discussed in real time (face-to-face is best; phone is
acceptable).
If you don’t write the proposal down, you have no record of your
starting point. If you simply submit the proposal without also talking with
your project sponsor about it, you risk having misunderstanding right
from the start. Let’s talk about the role of the security project sponsor in
this type of project.
Identifying the Security Project Sponsor
A security project sponsor is the person who champions the security pro-
ject plan within the organization. He or she is typically high enough in
the organization to have the authority to help remove or reduce the road-
blocks that your security project plan will invariably run into.The security
www.syngress.com
Deﬁning the Security Project • Chapter 2
45

project sponsor can be your direct supervisor or the president of your
company.The role of the security project sponsor is to approve the secu-
rity project plans, budget, and schedule, and help provide resources for the
project. If he or she is not motivated to help ensure the project’s success,
your project will probably run into problems down the line. If you suspect
this is the case, ﬁnd someone else to be your security project sponsor who
will partner with you for success (and who has the political pull in your
company to get things done).
Once you have identiﬁed a security project sponsor, start off by sitting
down with him or her and discussing your initial security project pro-
posal, including your assumptions regarding security project constraints.
This is also a great opportunity to develop a better relationship and a
clear and mutual understanding of the proposed project. If everything is
in sync, you are ready to write your security project proposal. If things are
not in sync, determine if you need to clarify it, incorporate feedback
from your security project sponsor, or go back to the drawing board.
Whatever the outcome, if your security project sponsor does not make
time to talk with you at this early stage, it should be a warning ﬂag and
you should re-think your approach (e.g., ﬁnd a new sponsor, ﬁnd a new
method for scheduling meetings with your sponsor).
This is also a good time to clarify how you and your security project
sponsor will interact and work together. Some people prefer quick e-mail
updates, while others prefer a regularly scheduled, face-to-face meeting.
Your job as IT security project manager is to ensure the project’s ultimate
success, which means that you may have to bend a little to achieve your
objectives. If your security project sponsor wants an in-depth, detailed,
blow-by-blow update on a weekly basis, you will either have to provide it
or suggest a suitable alternative.Take time at this juncture to determine
how you can best collaborate with your security project sponsor to
achieve your ultimate goal—a successful project.

Summary
All security project plans should begin with a clear deﬁnition of the
problem, the outcome, the possible solutions, and the optimal solution,
which will set the foundation for success. Remember, smaller projects
with smaller scopes, shorter timelines, and more milestones are typically
more successful.This method works well because it helps you focus on
the overall needs of the company ﬁrst, and then provides a method for
looking closely at the individual security areas.

Introduction
All projects require organization before they can be fully planned and
implemented.This chapter looks at some of the most common methods
used for organizing Information Technology (IT) security project plans.
Once the organizing phase for the corporate IT security plan is complete,
we will begin identifying the details of the project.
Project planning and management are iterative processes.This chapter
steps through the numerous processes that are part of organizing an IT
security project plan. However, that being said, you may not be able to
clearly articulate some of these elements until you have done additional
work (e.g., you cannot clearly deﬁne all of your IT security project
requirements until you have performed a network risk assessment or thor-
ough audit). Sometimes in the planning phase, you cannot deﬁne certain
elements until you have gone a few steps further in the process. If there
are elements you cannot deﬁne, create a placeholder and go back to them
when you have more detail.Also, you may need to complete one or more
individual security area project plans before you can ﬁnalize your overall
corporate IT security plan.
Identifying the IT Security Project Team
There are often two distinct groups within a project team: one helps with
the deﬁnition phase and the other one implements the project.Typically,
the deﬁnition phase of an IT project requires outside input, which is
where many IT projects start to go bad.A lot of these phases are planned
in the back of the server room by IT staff, which is ﬁne if you are dis-
cussing something purely technical; however, IT projects impact many
others beyond the IT staff.
A successful project, as you’ll recall, involves users and appropriate
stakeholders (see next section) early. One of the best ways to make sure
you avoid re-doing a lot of planning work is to include users on the initial
project team. Just because they are part of the initial team doesn’t mean
they have to be on the implementation team, though it’s often a good idea
www.syngress.com
52
Chapter 3 • Organizing the IT Security Project

to include a few users/stakeholders on that team as well. During the plan-
ning phases, key users should be selected for their ability to add value to
the process, not for political purposes (though we all know you sometimes
have to accept the ‘political appointee’ graciously). Getting users involved
can create critical mass for your project and if well-managed, it might
even generate user commitment because you’ll have key staff championing
the IT project to others in the organization. Participating in creating
something usually creates that all-important “buy in” and you’ll need your
users to be on board with any security project so this is as good a place as
any to start. Keep in mind that IT staff often misunderstand the needs of
the users and users almost always misunderstand the IT function, so be
prepared to do a bit of educating (and a lot of listening) along the way.
The more opportunities you have to educate users on how things in the
IT world work, the more effective you can be in meeting user’s needs.The
more opportunities you can take to really understand what users need, the
more effective your IT projects will be.
Some projects beneﬁt from users being involved in the process.You
may decide to have subject matter experts from key user areas participate
in the entire project. In a security project, there will be pieces a user does
not understand (e.g., encryption). On the other hand, a user can provide a
great reality check when you are deciding between smart cards or a 10-
step logon procedure.
Create clear criteria for selecting the right people for the project.
Avoid inviting people that are not critical to a successful project.Also,
keep the project team as lean and mean as possible to make it easier to
manage.
Identifying IT 
Security Project Stakeholders
Stakeholders are the people who are impacted by a project or who impact
projects. It is always a good idea to ﬁnd out who may be impacted before
going too far into the planning stage. If you overlook this step, you will
www.syngress.com
Organizing the IT Security Project • Chapter 3
53

invariably receive additional information later in the planning cycle that
will cost more time, money, and effort. Consider this: Suppose you are
well into your security project (you may have even begun implementing
it), and you ﬁnd out from Human Resources that there is a new govern-
ment regulation that your company must comply with.You also ﬁnd out
that Human Resources knew about it three months ago but did not know
that it would have an impact on the IT group. Now you have to go back
and redesign part of your authentication project plan, because it does not
take the new regulation into account.
At the outset of the IT security project planning process, have a
meeting with key members of every department that is present. Create a
brief presentation using your project proposal (see Chapter 2). Explain
what you are trying to accomplish and ﬁnd out who should be involved
in the project planning.There are often key people outside of a project
implementation team that should be included in both the planning and
testing phases. Once everyone knows about your project, follow up with
an e-mail to those same parties asking them to respond to some short
questions.The questions should be designed to ask if there are any depart-
ment-level considerations that should be included in the planning process
(e.g., ﬁnance might indicate they do not need to participate; however, you
want someone to help you understand what types of data the ﬁnance
department works with, how sensitive it is, where it is stored, and so on).
One way to categorize stakeholders for an IT security project is to
determine who must be involved, who might be inﬂuential, and who must
be informed.Those who should be involved are those who will either pro-
vide critical input to the project, or be directly affected by the results of
the project. Inﬂuential stakeholders should not be overlooked because they
can be key to gaining support for the project and keeping corporate
resources focused on achieving the project’s objectives. Inﬂuential stake-
holders are often project champions within an organization; therefore, uti-
lize them whenever possible. Finally, there is a group of stakeholders that
should remain informed, which includes the executive team, and may also
include key stakeholders who were part of the initial planning and who
www.syngress.com
54
Chapter 3 • Organizing the IT Security Project

may need periodic updates to fulﬁll corporate or government reporting
requirements.This is especially true if your IT security project plan
touches on industry or governmental requirements such as SOX or the
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).
The following is an initial list of potential project stakeholders who
should be represented on your IT security planning team:
■
IT staff
■
User representatives
■
Human Resources
■
Finance
■
Legal
■
Departmental managers
■
Regional or site managers
Deﬁning IT Security 
Project Requirements
Security project plan requirements are not deﬁned until the stakeholders
are identiﬁed; however, a preliminary set of project plan requirements can
be created.The key is making sure you get the stakeholders’ input before
ﬁnalizing your security project plan. If you fail to involve the stakeholders,
you will end up with a security project plan that is missing key require-
ments, or is difﬁcult or impossible to implement or maintain.
Project requirements are those elements that your security project plan
must incorporate.There are four categories of requirements: user, business,
functional, and technical. Requirements can also be analyzed in the following
way:
■
User Requirements What do end users need to help maintain a
secure network environment?
www.syngress.com
Organizing the IT Security Project • Chapter 3
55

■
Departmental Requirements What do the various departments
need for security? Human Resources needs tight security on per-
sonnel ﬁles;Accounting needs tight security on credit card numbers
and company ﬁnancials; and Business Development may have spe-
cialized security needs related to staff that travels frequently.
■
External User Requirements Are there vendors that need to con-
nect to the network? If so, what are their needs? Do you provide
customers the ability to get real-time data online, and if so, what are
their requirements? Does your company allow employees to connect
to the corporate network from home or on the road? How should
these external connections be protected?
■
Corporate Policy Requirements Are there any corporate policies
that can be interpreted as requirements for an IT security project
plan? If so, put them in your security project plan.
■
Governmental Regulation Requirements Is your organization
subject to Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) regulations, Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), or any other govern-
mental regulations that could impact your IT security project plan?
You may have other requirements relevant to your industry, business
activities, location and more.This is not an exhaustive list but just a starter
to get you thinking about all the requirements.As you can see, this is
where having representatives from different parts of the organization can
really help you out since there may be numerous requirements that should
be addressed.
In addition, consider the project constraints (scope, time, cost, and
quality) as project requirements (e.g., some IT project managers include
the initial project constraints if there are speciﬁc requirements). If your
budget for the security project plan is $25,000, you might include it as a
requirement. In the early stages, it is better to include elements that you
may later determine you do not need, than to inadvertently overlook an
important requirement.
Requirements are the elements that a security project plan must pro-
vide. If you do not involve your stakeholders in deﬁning the IT security
www.syngress.com
56
Chapter 3 • Organizing the IT Security Project

project plan requirements, you may end up with a project that fails to
meet stakeholder requirements, which can result in project failure. When
you put up ﬁrewall security so secure it is impenetrable, you think your
project is a success, until you begin receiving user complaints such as they
cannot utilize the Internet or share ﬁles with customers or vendors.The
perception of the success of the project has just plummeted.You have met
IT’s security requirements, but failed to take user requirements into con-
sideration.
To effectively gather stakeholder requirements, hold an initial project
meeting. Invite all potential stakeholders and work with them to identify
as many potential requirements as possible. Once you have compiled an
extensive list, pare it down and circulate it for approval. When you state
the requirements that the security project plan must achieve, you have
identiﬁed the scope of the project. If your list of requirements is too long
or varied, consider breaking it down into several smaller security project
plans.You will probably have to reduce the requirements to a manageable
subset before proceeding to the formal planning stages. Reducing require-
ments is a way of managing the scope; if you do not deﬁne and manage
your requirements throughout the project, you will have a bad case of
scope creep, a term used often to describe uncontrolled changes in a pro-
ject’s scope.To help avoid (or minimize) scope creep, create a clear set of
the requirements necessary to create a secure environment.
The reverse situation can be equally challenging. Suppose you invite a
number of key stakeholders to a meeting to gather IT security project
plan requirements, and no one comes? Or, suppose a number of people
come that have no meaningful input? At that point, you would need to
explain the necessary requirements before continuing the meeting.For
example, you might distribute a list of possible requirements via email and
ask them to respond.You may have to get creative but don’t simply accept
that the users have no requirements if they fail to deliver them.They have
requirements and it’s up to you to ferret them out prior to ﬁnalizing your
project plan.

Business Intelligence…
Taking the Pain Out of Meetings
People hate boring meetings, and the truth of the matter is, many IT-
related meetings are boring. Some IT staff are more comfortable inter-
acting with computers than with users. Following are some tips to help
facilitate communication at the meeting:
1. Decide what you want out of the meeting. 
2. Plan the meeting from the user’s perspective; try to anticipate
how he or she will respond to the meeting and plan accord-
ingly.
3. Have a Human Resources manager or a facilitator moderate
the meeting. A facilitator can help keep the meeting on track,
on time, and on topic. If your team does not have a facilitator,
use company resources.
4. Be sure the users understand why they have been invited to
the meeting. 
5. Avoid “planning by PowerPoint.” PowerPoint presentations
should not be considered security project plans. However,
PowerPoint presentations are an effective communication tool
that can be used to explain the project overview. 
6. Publish a meeting agenda and stick to it. Having an agenda
helps participants understand the preferred objective and can
help keep the meeting on track. An agenda will also help
ensure that the meeting’s objective is achieved. 
7. Assign owners for follow-up items. If your meeting requires
follow up, list the tasks, the due dates and the owners, and
then follow up with them.

Deﬁning IT Security Project Objectives
Once you have identiﬁed the stakeholders and compiled your require-
ments, you are ready to sit down with your team and begin developing
the security project objectives.
After identifying the requirements, create three to ﬁve major objec-
tives.The corporate IT security project plans and the individual security
project plans each have different objectives. For ease of reference, they are
referred to as the Corporate IT Security Project (CISP) and the
Individual Security Area Project (ISAP). In Figure 3.1, the two levels of
objectives are marked by the numbers 1 and 2. Number 1 indicates the
CISP-level objectives and Number 2 indicates the ISAP-level objectives.
You will create a distinct set of objectives for each of your ISAP plans;
however, those objectives may overlap from one project to another.

The following is a sample list of CISP objectives:
■
Provide a comprehensive security management framework for the
organization.
■
Provide a clear and consistent set of corporate security policies.
■
Identify speciﬁc security areas to be reviewed and managed.
■
Create speciﬁc ISAP plans to manage the appropriate security ele-
ments within the company.
ISAP-level objectives go into a deeper level of detail within the var-
ious security topic areas. Use the sub-items listed below each header in
the ISAP section as the starting point of your objectives (e.g., under
“General Security” in Figure 3.1, the following topics are listed:Access
Control,Authentication,Auditing, and Attacks).These objectives can be
stated as follows:
■
Review, deﬁne, and implement access controls on the network.
■
Review, deﬁne, and implement user and computer authentication.
■
Deﬁne and implement auditing policies and procedures.
■
Review vulnerabilities and develop prevention and countermeasures
against attacks.
Everyone approaches things a bit differently, which is ﬁne as long as
everyone adheres to the underlying methodology.You want to deﬁne
three to ﬁve major objectives that take into account your chosen project
solution and requirements. If you ﬁnd yourself deﬁning 10 objectives, you
are going into detail too early. Look at your list of objectives to see if one
or more can be rolled up into a higher-level objective. On the other hand,
if you only come up with two objectives, you may need to spend more
time deﬁning your project. Sometimes, if you only have one or two
objectives, you need to break them down into more speciﬁc objectives.
Three to ﬁve is a general guideline; some successful projects have three
objectives, and some have eight. Make sure you double-check your objec-
tives for your project plan. If your list of objectives is too long, you should
consider breaking it into smaller sub-projects.

Deﬁning IT Security Project Processes
Now we come to one of the large chunks of project deﬁnition that many
people would rather skip. Let’s face it – once the project is underway, pro-
cesses will be used.They will be deﬁned on the ﬂy, they will be made up
in the face of an emergency and they will almost certainly be less than
optimal.As much as you probably don’t want to do this (unless you’re a
real detail-oriented person), it really does help to deﬁne your project pro-
cesses ahead of time. We’re not going to delve too deeply into this topic
but we will provide some helpful reminders to get you on track. Refer to
your IT project management notes or references if you need a more in-
depth refresher.The following is a list of project processes you should con-
sider implementing for your project. If you aren’t familiar with these
concepts, you can review the IT Project Management material (see
Chapter 1 for details on how to access this material).Your IT security
plans should use fairly rigorous processes to ensure that your IT security
project plan is airtight. We’ll review each of these topics brieﬂy with an
eye toward IT security projects.

Acceptance Criteria
Acceptance criteria (sometimes called “success criteria)” are the criteria by
which someone accepts results. Success criteria are the criteria by which
someone deems the project a success.Though acceptance and success go
hand-in-hand, it is possible that some projects may meet the acceptance
criteria and still not be deemed successful. Numerous studies show that an
IT project can come in on scope, on time, on budget, and with the
required level of quality, and still not be deemed successful. Why? The
most common reason is failure to communicate project status and
progress. For our discussion, we use the term “acceptance criteria” to help
keep focused on those tangible elements that can be measured and
reported.Acceptance criteria such as,“users are able to log onto the net-
work using the new required password format” is not a measurable state-
ment.“100% of existing users are able to log onto the network using the
new required password format on the ﬁrst attempt,” is both speciﬁc and
measurable.Acceptance criteria typically address a project’s requirements
and are written in clear, concise, and speciﬁc ways to measure and quantify
the project’s delivery of the requirements.
Risk Management
There are numerous risks involved in developing an IT security project
plan; therefore, it is important to spend as much time planning your pro-
ject as necessary to avoid additional problems later in the process.Again, it
helps to include key stakeholders so that you have an understanding of the
risks of the project, which can run the gamut from,“What happens if we
fail to implement?” to “What happens if we get bogged down in phase 2
of the project?” to “What are the ﬁnancial and legal consequences of a
failure in ISAP-level project 1, 2, or 3?”To help identify the potential
risks, identify the following:

How should those risks be managed (avoid, reduce, respond)?
■

■

■

contingency plans?
You may need to create a security project plan for your network risk
and threat assessment before developing a larger corporate IT strategy.You
need to understand the unique threats to your network and corporate
resources before you can create speciﬁc requirements for your security
project plan.An audit can be a discrete project plan, or it can be incorpo-
rated into each IT security project plan.
Remember, too, that when we discuss risk management here, we’re
speciﬁcally discussing risks to the IT security project itself. Risk assessment
from a network or data perspective is part of a threat assessment or secu-
rity audit and is a separate process. In this phase, you need to understand
what can go wrong with your project and how to deal with it.As with
many other aspects of project management, risk assessment and planning
ahead of project implementation can help save time, effort, and stress once
the project is underway. By looking at what could go wrong before get-
ting into the planning and implementation stages, you can ﬁnd ways to
avoid some risks and minimize others.Also, sometimes you will discover
that your project plan is actually improved by the innovative ideas used to
mitigate project risk.
Change Management
Errors and omissions in the IT security world create gaping holes that can
be exploited, either unintentionally by users, or intentionally through
internal or external attacks. Errors and omissions happen because changes
to the security project plan are not managed well.
www.syngress.com
Organizing the IT Security Project • Chapter 3
63

Managing change in an IT security project plan is a two-fold process.
First, you have to identify the necessary changes and assess the impact
these changes will have on your overall security project plan (e.g., will it
impact your e-commerce application if you change how you conﬁgure
your ﬁrewall).The second aspect of change management is keeping track
of the changes. Changes should be incorporated and clearly documented
into your security project plan (i.e., how, when, where, and why the
change was made ).
Successfully managing changes to a security project plan can mean the
difference between success and failure. If you do not thoroughly assess and
document those changes, you may not know which project plan elements
were implemented, which will create security holes.
Business Intelligence…
Avoiding Endless Decision Loops
Some companies have a culture that encourages decisions be re-visited
repeatedly. This is particularly true with project changes. For example: A
team meets to discuss an unanticipated problem, brainstorm possible
solutions, decide on a solution, analyze the potential risks of that solu-
tion, and determine how to incorporate that change into the security pro-
ject plan. Two months later, someone encounters a problem that is related
to the change, and the decision has to be re-hashed. No decision is
reached and subsequent meetings are called to discuss the problem,
which puts the project at risk. The project is endlessly delayed and rogue
decisions are being made and implemented that are outside the formal
security project planning process, which leads to “unspeciﬁed” results. 
To avoid endless decision loops, document your change manage-
ment process and use it faithfully. If you document everything you do,
including the changes and the reasons for those changes, you can avoid
the endless decision loops that delay projects indeﬁnitely.

Chapter 3 • Organizing the IT Security Project

Communication
Communication is critical when you are planning your IT security project
plan. Users can help secure the network by following the security policies
and reporting suspicious activity.Your communication plan should address
the communication needs of each stakeholder group.The communication
plan is also an opportunity to distribute a positive message about the pro-
ject and its progress.
Assess each stakeholder group individually and develop the appropriate
communication plans (e.g., executives may want a high-level “dashboard”
report on a quarterly or monthly basis, while users may want a more
detailed understanding of how the project is going. If you are sending out
long weekly e-mail updates, chances are good that most people will not
read them. If you are printing out memos in a company that relies on e-
mail, you are also missing your audience.The frequency of communica-
tion, the content of the communication, and the medium for
communication are all important aspects of developing a successful com-
munication plan for your IT security project plan.
Quality
In many cases, the quality of an IT security project plan can be measured,
monitored, and controlled through testing.Your quality processes might
include the level of testing required for each major security area in your
security project plan. Moderate testing yields moderate quality, and exten-
sive testing yields higher quality.The Federal Reserve Bank’s banking
system requires a higher level of security than a used book store; therefore,
the cost to implement that security should be reﬂected. Lower quality is
not necessarily a bad thing; however, it must be appropriate to the needs of
your company.
www.syngress.com
Organizing the IT Security Project • Chapter 3
65

Status Reporting
IT security projects have a unique set of demands for status reporting.As
you begin implementing various security measures, you need to keep key
stakeholders up to date (e.g., how much the project has cost to date, how
the project is progressing against schedule).They may also want to know if
particular parts of security have been modiﬁed or upgraded for govern-
mental or corporate reporting purposes. Keeping key stakeholders in the
loop is a bit of an art form.You need to ensure that you share important
information regularly, supply the needed information in a clear and con-
cise manner, and send updates on a regular schedule.
One successful method you can incorporate is to talk with the various
stakeholders when you are deﬁning project requirements, to help deter-
mine what type and frequency of update will be most useful to them.
Information that is short, clear, concise, and well-organized is far more
likely to be read and absorbed than long, rambling missives.
Defect, Error, and Issue Tracking
As with change management, defect, error, and issue tracking are impor-
tant in IT security project plans.You can use whatever terminology makes
the most sense to you in your organization (defect, error or issue), for
clarity we’ll simply call it issue tracking. Closely track issues related to
your IT security project plan; not doing so may create huge security holes
and gaps. Managing project issues is an important part of the project man-
ager’s job. Be sure you have a solid issue-tracking process deﬁned in your
IT security project plan.
Issues should be tracked to capture the source, the description, the
owner of the issue, the agreed-upon resolution, and the timeline for reso-
lution. Issues should also be assigned a unique identiﬁer so that they can
be found quickly.
www.syngress.com
66
Chapter 3 • Organizing the IT Security Project

Escalation Procedures
Escalation procedures are important for IT security project plans. If an
issue cannot be resolved through normal channels, you need to have a
pre-deﬁned process for escalating it.This is where working with your
sponsor and key stakeholders can be helpful, because they can lend you
their organizational authority and help you create appropriate escalation
procedures.
Deﬁne the parameters for an escalation well in advance of beginning
the project.An escalation raises the awareness and visibility of problems.
Having well-deﬁned parameters will help your team decide what issues
should be escalated and how to do so.The sooner you know about a
problem, the better chance you have of resolving it successfully. If a team
member fails to recognize that an issue should be escalated, your project’s
budget, timeline, or deliverables can be put at risk.
In addition, by clearly deﬁning escalation parameters and procedures,
you are less likely to have to defend your decisions later. When you deﬁne
your escalation procedures and the project sponsor and key stakeholders
sign off on them, you minimize the ﬁnger pointing that often happens
when problems occur.
Documentation Procedures
IT security project plans require a rigorous level of documentation.As you
develop your individual security project plan, deﬁne the documentation
requirements and procedures in detail. It is important to ﬁnd a balance
between the need for documentation and the need to get work accom-
plished. If you require more paperwork than is reasonable and necessary,
the IT staff will likely provide incomplete or inadequate documentation in
an effort to get through the tasks quickly.There is nothing more frustrating
than performing a 5-minute task and then spending 25 minutes on the
paperwork. Be sure you provide IT staff with templates, forms, and easy-to-
use procedures to create the necessary project documentation.The easier it
is for staff to document the needed data, the more likely they will comply.
www.syngress.com
Organizing the IT Security Project • Chapter 3
67

One of the real dangers is having staff provide false information because
the documentation requirements were too onerous.This could lead to sig-
niﬁcant security holes, but more importantly, there could be serious legal
implications.
You may have more stringent or speciﬁc documentation requirements
if your organization is trying to become certiﬁed or is subject to govern-
mental or industry regulation. Locate the in-house experts on those regu-
lations and be sure to get their input on the documentation needs for the
security project plan.
Approval Procedures
Approval procedures should include who approves changes to the security
project plan, who approves increases in expenditures, and who approves
ﬁnal deliverables. Create approval procedures that document exactly what
is being approved, when it is being approved, and by whom. Keep it clean
and simple to ensure that you get the approvals your project needs in
order to continue moving forward in a timely manner.
In most companies, the project sponsor is the person who provides the
needed approval for most of the changes.Therefore, your approval proce-
dures should specify that all approval points and changes to the budget or
schedule must be reviewed by your project sponsor.You should also iden-
tify subject matter experts in various areas of security that can be con-
sulted, or you may need to have Human Resources or Legal review certain
project parameters before moving forward.Take the time to identify the
needed project approval points and identify the person or persons needed
to grant approval.When your project is at a critical juncture, you do not
want to be running around trying to determine whose signature is needed.
In addition, there are often political and organizational issues sur-
rounding certain types of approvals. For example, if your security project
requires a change in the way users access information or in the availability
of certain resources (e.g., prohibiting access to secure data outside of
normal business hours), you need to determine who has the authority to
grant approval for those changes. If you do not go through the proper
www.syngress.com
68
Chapter 3 • Organizing the IT Security Project

channels, you may run into an organizational dead end or face unexpected
backlash.
Deployment
In the case of IT security plans, there may not be speciﬁc deployments or
deployment plans required. On the other hand, if you are installing addi-
tional security devices such as smart card readers, ﬁngerprint readers, or
additional routers, ﬁrewalls, or other network hardware/software, you have
to develop a deployment plan as part of your security project plan.
The deployment plan should also take into account key stakeholder
input; you do not want to interrupt network services during a key client
visit or during a major project deliverable. Make sure your deployment
plans and associated schedule are known to those that will be impacted by
it, so that they can log off.You want to avoid surprise or unplanned dis-
ruptions to company operations to the greatest degree possible.The
deployment plan should be coupled with pro-active communication plan
so that everyone is on the same page (see the “Communication” section
earlier in this chapter).
Operations
Another key area in IT security plans is how security will be maintained
on a day-to-day basis once you have completed your projects and tight-
ened security.To use an analogy, it does not matter how many locks you
have if you leave the door open.As part of your IT security project plan-
ning, you should know what is required on an ongoing basis to keep your
security measures in place.This includes on-going monitoring, and
making necessary changes to ongoing operational activities that reﬂect the
new security policies and procedures.As your business grows and changes,
you will have to reassess the impact of that change on your security pro-
ject plan. If you create a security project plan speciﬁcally for performing a
security audit, you can use that plan each year (after updating it) to reﬂect
the current status of your company, network, and data resources.

Training
Training runs the gamut from training IT staff on new security software
and hardware tools, to learning how to use new tools and techniques for
monitoring and responding to attacks, training users how to avoid
installing malicious software (malware) on their systems, and so forth.
Training also includes training IT staff on new security procedures for
ongoing operations. Users often need to be trained, which is another area
that your key stakeholder’s can help by identifying training needs so that
security is maintained throughout the security project plan.
Involve your company’s training team in the planning phases and in
status reports so they can coordinate their training efforts with your pro-
ject’s progress. Users should be trained as close to actual need for those
skills as possible. If you do not have a training department or if this type of
training typically falls to someone in the IT department, make sure that
identifying training needs, developing training materials, and delivering
training programs are all tasks incorporated into your security project
plan.Also make sure that the person or persons assigned to these tasks are
in the loop regarding project progress so they can plan accordingly.
Finally, there may be training needs along the way.You may think that
your team has the skills needed to implement your security project plan,
and then ﬁnd out later that a key member of the team has left the com-
pany or is otherwise unavailable. While you cannot plan for these types of
possibilities, keep them in the back of your mind as you develop your
training outline and your costs for associated training.

Chapter 3 • Organizing the IT Security Project

Summary
As seen in this chapter, there are some elements of IT security project
plans that are different from other projects. Errors and omissions in this
area could have a serious impact on your security and, therefore, on your
business.Your project team can help you organize your project appropri-
ately, especially if you include key stakeholders in the project organizing
process.You may ﬁnd that you will have different members of the project
team on different phases of the project. Identifying and including key
stakeholders will help support the project’s success.Additionally, stake-
holders can provide vital input as to the project’s requirements so that the
ﬁnal project plan reﬂects user, functional, technical, organizational, and reg-
ulatory requirements. Once you have identiﬁed your requirements, you can
create the project’s objectives, which describe the project’s scope. Finally,
organize your project and identify any needed procedures for your security
project plan.The necessary planning takes a lot of time on the front end
doing, but is a wise investment that will pay dividends on the back end.

Identifying the IT Security Project Team
 A project will be more successful if you involve those outside the IT
staff early in the process.
 Your IT security project plan team may have different members for
the various phases of the project.
 Some members of the team may be needed to deﬁne and organize
the project, a different subset of team members may be needed to test
and implement the project, and another team may be responsible for
the ongoing maintenance of security after the project is complete.

Identifying IT Security Project Stakeholders
 Stakeholders are categorized as involved, inﬂuential, and informed.
 Involved stakeholders are the people who must be closely involved
with the project in order for it to be successful.
 Inﬂuential stakeholders are those who inﬂuence the project.They
may not be closely involved in the day-to-day elements of the
project, but they will have an inﬂuence over the outcome.
 Some stakeholders need to be informed. Stakeholders can include
the executive team, regional or departmental managers, or the
training staff.
Deﬁning IT Security Project Requirements
 Taking time to clearly identify the requirements for your IT security
project helps you deﬁne the scope of your project.
 There can be user, Financial, Legal,Accounting, corporate, industry,
and governmental requirements.
 Stakeholders can be excellent resources for identifying project
requirements.
 Project planning is an iterative process.You may have to come back
to the requirements deﬁnition phase after you have done some initial
assessments.
Deﬁning IT Security Project Objectives
 Projects that are limited in scope have a better chance of success;
therefore, deﬁning three to ﬁve key objectives per project is optimal.
 If you have 10 or 20 objectives, you are probably going into the
detail too soon. See if you have any related objectives that can be
rolled up into higher-level objectives.
www.syngress.com
72
Chapter 3 • Organizing the IT Security Project

 If you can only deﬁne one or two objectives, your project scope may
be too small or you may not clearly understand the problem. If you
skipped the problem deﬁnition steps (see Chapter 2) or if you short-
circuited them, you may want to re-visit them to make sure that you
have a clear understanding of your project.
Deﬁning IT Security Project Processes
 IT security projects require and use deﬁned processes, because
omissions and errors can create huge security holes.
 Keep your procedures simple. Only require as much time, effort, and
documentation as is necessary. Unnecessary or cumbersome processes
and procedures are almost always circumvented, thus creating
potential for error.
 Each IT security project has different procedure and reporting
requirements. Stakeholders can be another source of feedback when
looking for checks and balances in this arena.

Introduction
We often think of quality as something to check for in workmanship
(e.g., whether a chair or a car is well-made). Quality in software projects
is also easy to spot.A program that has few bugs and works as advertised
is considered a higher quality product than one that keeps crashing or
one that generates errors. When we think of Information Technology
(IT) security, we typically think of secure versus vulnerable, protected
versus unprotected, and safe versus at-risk. None of these really evoke
thoughts of quality, but if you think about what will make a network
secure, protected, and safe, it is the quality of several processes.
How well you perform your risk assessment will result in how well-
protected your network ultimately is. How well you delineate the steps
necessary to harden your servers or your network infrastructure ulti-
mately leads to how secure your network is. Quality should be at the
forefront of your mind as you deﬁne, organize, plan, and manage your IT
security project plans. In this chapter, we look at some of the elements
you should address in your IT security project plans.
Quality and security have a lot of common traits. Just as with quality,
security is difﬁcult to quantify or recognize, because the measure of its
success is the absence of failure. Much like insurance, you never want to
have to use it, but unlike insurance, if you have your security systems in
place, the expectation is zero failure, not 98 percent success.The quality
of a security project plan seems more difﬁcult to quantify, but if you do
so, adding these measurements to your project will help you maintain the
highest possible security standards.
Planning IT Security Project Quality
Just as with standard project management, quality begins in the planning
phases. Errors and omissions in the planning stage are ampliﬁed
throughout the security project plan, and typically become very serious
issues at the other end of the project lifecycle, in the implementation or
maintenance phases. Planning is the ﬁrst place quality is “built” into the
www.syngress.com
76
Chapter 4 • Building Quality into IT Security Projects

security project plan, but as with all project management, it’s a contin-
uous cycle (see Figure 4.1).The security project plan is created, imple-
mented, monitored, and tested.Any changes are typically brought back
through the project lifecycle as revisions through the change manage-
ment process. Revisions are almost always necessary, as more detail
becomes known through the planning process.As we plan, we under-
stand the security project plan better and may revise the security project
plan based on new data or a deeper understanding. In addition, we typi-
cally test our assumptions, create workﬂow models, and develop lab pro-
tocols.The results of these should feed back into the security project
plan in a logical and thoughtful manner.This continuous loop helps
create continuous improvement.
One word of caution: Don’t get caught up in the loop, and never
deliver ﬁnal results.You will have to draw a line at some point and
deliver the ﬁnal security project plan. One indication that you need to
stop looping and start delivering is when you ﬁnd that the revisions are
becoming smaller and of less importance, or that you’ve reﬁned the data
to about an 80 to 90 percent level of accuracy or acceptability.You’ll
most likely never reach 100 percent; shooting for it is one of the reasons
people get locked in a feedback loop.You might also have key metrics
that you deﬁne that indicate when it’s time to move forward, or you
might have a hard deadline that drives you to ﬁnalize your security pro-
ject plan. Keep in mind that achieving higher and higher levels of
quality when you’re nearing 100 percent becomes more difﬁcult. It’s not
a straight line increase between 95 percent and 96 percent, it’s an expo-
nential increase.The time, effort, and cost associated with perfection is
rarely practical, and you’ll need to assess your level of quality against
your level of risk and determine when to stop revising and when to
start working.

The following are speciﬁc areas of the planning process that directly
impact quality:

User Requirements
If a security project plan fails to meet key user requirements, the project is
essentially a failure. It’s sometimes easy to forget the fact that IT is a ser-
vice provided to the company to facilitate, enable, and enhance its ability
to get the job done. Business activities are performed by various company
users, so it’s important to ﬁnd a balance between pure IT security objec-
tives and what users actually need.As discussed in Chapter 3, including
key users into your IT planning process early in the lifecycle will help
ensure that user needs are considered throughout. It’s easier to negotiate

and ﬁnd solutions to user objections or issues early on, than it is to go
back through your security project planning steps and re-work a “per-
fect” IT security solution.The net result might not be the optimal one
from an IT security standpoint, but if it meets corporate, IT, and user
needs, you have a much better chance of successfully implementing and
maintaining security.
Functional Requirements
Functional requirements are often derived directly from user requirements.
Functional requirements describe how a system should perform, often
from the user’s perspective.The system can be described or deﬁned as any
part of your IT security solution, such as user logon requirements or ﬁre-
wall functional requirements. Functional requirements are typically delin-
eated as the services, tasks, or functions required of the system.To use a
more concrete example, suppose you are deﬁning the user logon process.
The functional requirements might include the requirement that the user
only has to log on once to access all information, or it might state that
the user be required to logon additional times as they move across
domains or into more conﬁdential data.The functional requirements
would deﬁne how that logon function should work, so that when the
security solution is being developed, the IT staff can create the solution
that ﬁts these requirements.
Functional requirements are often tied to federal, state, or industry
regulations, as well as certiﬁcations. For example, if you are working on a
security project plan that includes the student health services on a local
college campus, you must be compliant with a variety of regulations
including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of
1996 (HIPAA). (See Chapter 9 for more detailed information on some of
the common regulations that might impact your IT security project
plan.) Requirements that are part of governmental or industry regulation
www.syngress.com
Building Quality into IT Security Projects • Chapter 4
79

typically have a precise and detailed list of speciﬁcations that your staff,
processes, and technology must comply with in order to meet standards.
Where available, these should be included as functional requirements. If
the requirements are not clear or do not provide the set of detailed speci-
ﬁcations necessary to meet certiﬁcation or regulatory requirements, you’ll
need to do a bit more research. In some cases, you may need to consult
with industry or regulatory experts for clariﬁcation, or you may need to
seek appropriate legal advice in order to ensure your IT security project
plans deliver the requirements for federal, state, industry regulation, or
certiﬁcation.
Business Intelligence…
Functional Requirements Can 
Help Reduce Complex Security Challenges
Storage Area Networks (SAN) are complex devices that are used by many
network entities, from servers to users to applications, and beyond.
Using functional requirements can help you reduce the complexity so
that rather than trying to wrap your arms around the entire universe of
users, you can look at the required functionality. In this way, you can
look at the functional areas to determine how the SAN security system
should work. An article that appeared on the Search Security Web site in
December 2005, describes the ﬁve A’s of SAN security as authentication,
access, auditing, alarms, and availability. Approaching SAN security from
these functional areas allows you to work through your security project
plan in a methodical manner. Once your functional requirements are
deﬁned, you can move into deﬁning the technical requirements. (For
more information on the ﬁve A’s article, go to http://searchsecurity.
techtarget.com/tip/1,289483,sid14_gci1152494,00.html.)
www.syngress.com
80
Chapter 4 • Building Quality into IT Security Projects

Technical Requirements
The technical requirements are usually created after the functional require-
ments.Technical requirements are statements of parameters or measure-
ments (e.g., the Transmission Control Protocol [TCP]/Internet Protocol
[IP] ports that are required for various applications so that the ﬁrewall can
be properly conﬁgured, the number of users a solution must support and
the maximum amount of time it takes a user to login can be deﬁned; and
the minimum amount of disk space required for an Intrusion Detection
System (IDS) can be conﬁgured.) These are all examples of technical
requirements that should be included in your security project plan.As
you can see, it usually makes sense to create your functional requirements
to describe how your security systems should work, and then create your
technical requirements. However, there may be times where you start
with technical speciﬁcations because your system needs to meet very spe-
ciﬁc technical parameters. Keep in mind that most legal, ﬁnancial, regula-
tory, and industry requirements begin as functional requirements, and
must be translated into technical requirements in order to be incorpo-
rated into the security project plan (e.g., if you are required to protect
personal information due to HIPAA, you should build those requirements
into your functional and technical requirements as well as into your
acceptance criteria).
Acceptance Criteria
It’s always a good idea to deﬁne the criteria by which a security project
plan as a whole or an individual project deliverable will be accepted. In
some project management situations, acceptance criteria are the measure-
ments by which the security project plan is accepted and paid for; there-
fore, these metrics can literally mean the difference between proﬁt and
loss. With internal projects, there usually isn’t the issue of whether or not
you’ll get paid; the issue is whether or not the security project plan will
be deemed completed and successful.At some point in our careers, most
of us have been in a situation where it almost feels like a pair of six-year-
olds quipping back and forth,“Did too!” and “Did not!”This is the kind
www.syngress.com
Building Quality into IT Security Projects • Chapter 4
81

of situation you would always prefer to avoid rather than repair, and the
best way to do that is through acceptance criteria.
By deﬁnition, acceptance criteria are “pre-established standards or
requirements that a project must meet.” When you deﬁne these at the
outset of the security project plan, you can get all of the relevant stake-
holders on the same page and agreeing to the same results. Referring
back to the user example: Suppose the Accounting department wants
users to have to login a second time to examine speciﬁc documents, but
the Sales department wants one fast, easy way for its remote sales people
to login to the network and retrieve accounting documents, sometimes
over intermittent or slow connections. If you appease one group, you’ll
likely frustrate the other. In this case, you’ll end up with a security project
plan that is deemed a failure (or at least, less than successful) by one group
or the other.To avoid this kind of push-pull, deﬁne requirements and
acceptance criteria for each of your individual security area project plans,
as well as for your security project plan as a whole. Make special note of
any legal, ﬁnancial, regulatory, or industry requirements that must be met,
and build them into your acceptance criteria.
Quality Metrics
Speciﬁc quality metrics may be difﬁcult to deﬁne for your security project
plan because, as stated at the outset of this chapter, the deﬁnition of
quality is “the complete absence of incidents.” If your network is targeted
by hackers and they fail to get in, you have achieved a quality result.
While you and your IT staff understand the enormity of that result, it’s
entirely possible that those outside of the IT world see it as a non-event.
In reality, it is the compilation of non-events that proves that your secu-
rity solution delivered the requisite level of quality.
Still, there are ways to deﬁne quality. For instance, when imple-
menting intrusion prevention and intrusion detection systems, you want
100 percent prevention and zero percent intrusion. Is this a reasonable
and achievable metric? It would seem so since even one intrusion could
cost your company millions of dollars, thousands of hours, and untold
www.syngress.com
82
Chapter 4 • Building Quality into IT Security Projects

cost to the company’s reputation. However, let’s remember that quality
has to do with errors and defects. Even if you have zero errors or defects,
a network intrusion can still occur for other reasons; therefore, you need
to deﬁne the level of errors or defects that are acceptable. While most
everyone would agree that zero is the best, it’s usually not an achievable
metric.You will have to balance your time and budget against your
quality metrics to make sure you’re delivering a reasonable solution. If
you wait until it’s perfect, you will never implement anything. Be clear
about where you’re drawing the line and why. Document what exposure
these choices might create, and the decision-making process that you used
to balance the time and cost against results, so that you have a clear
record of this process that you can refer back to later, or that you can
provide to management should you be asked.
As discussed previously, quality needs to be balanced against the con-
straints of the security project plan. For example, to meet the requirement
of 100 percent prevention of intrusion, you might have to spend twice as
much as is in your budget. On the other hand, you might be able to
achieve 95 percent prevention within your budget.The cost also has to be
counterbalanced with the amount of risk your company is willing to
accept, as well as the value of the data being protected.This equation is
critical to understanding and addressing the cost of security.The accept-
able level of risk and the value of the data being protected should be kept
in mind throughout your IT security project planning process.
In many cases, quality is not a discrete deliverable, but rather a
mindset and a cultural attitude. When you focus on quality in your IT
security project plan, you are sending a message to the team and the
company that quality is critical to the success of the project. Defining
and quantifying it in ways appropriate to your specific security project
plan is a worthwhile endeavor.You might be surprised at how you and
your team can define quality within the framework of an IT security
project plan.

Change Management Procedures
We talk more about change management procedures later in the book, so
we’ll just touch on them in this chapter. Changes to the security project
plan are made throughout the project lifecycle. While changes are
inevitable, it doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t strive to reduce the number
of required changes with thorough and thoughtful up-front planning.
That said, change will always happen for a variety of reasons; therefore,
having a well thought-out plan for managing change is crucial to both
project quality and project success.As you know, when you change a set-
ting in one place, it can have a ripple effect throughout the network.The
same is true of any change you make to your security project plan; it can
(and usually will) ripple throughout your security project plan. In addi-
tion, because you’re speciﬁcally focusing on security, you also have to rec-
ognize that changes to a security project plan can have both intended and
unintended results.The unintended results are those unexpected things
that occur as a result of inserting change into an already thought-out
security project plan.
Create, implement, and manage your change management process for
your security project plan to ensure that the ﬁnal result meets quality and
security standards. If change is allowed to run rampant throughout your
security project plans, you will deliver a patchwork project that will more
than likely leave you exposed on several fronts. While change manage-
ment won’t prevent all errors, omissions, or gaps, it will certainly help
reduce them.
Standard Operating Procedures
Standard operating procedures (SOPs) are sometimes outside the scope of a
security project plan, but in the world of network security, they must tie
in very tightly to the project. Once the security measures have been
implemented and tested, someone has to take ownership of maintaining
security throughout the organization.This is done through a number of
measures including training, the deﬁning and adherence to SOPs, and the
designation and training of an incident response team (also called a
www.syngress.com
84
Chapter 4 • Building Quality into IT Security Projects

Computer Security Incident Response Team [CSIRT]).Therefore, it’s
advisable to include the deﬁnition of SOPs in the IT security project
plan itself.
Think about it.Your security project plan team will include represen-
tatives from many key areas of your organization. What better time to
develop procedures for maintaining security than when you have the key
people responsible for doing so participating in the planning? While you
may need to circle back to this team toward the end of the project life-
cycle (since you probably cannot deﬁne SOPs until you’ve deﬁned and
implemented your speciﬁc security solutions), these key people should be
involved in deﬁning the SOPs that will help maintain security. If you
implement a security solution that is virtually impossible to monitor and
maintain, have you delivered a quality project? You may have delivered a
top quality security project plan result, but users and management are not
likely to perceive the project as high-quality if it leaves them completely
overwhelmed or confused about how to maintain security on a day-to-
day basis.Therefore, keeping an eye on SOPs, not just for the IT team,
but for users, department leads, and others, will help make sure your secu-
rity project plan not only delivers a quality result, but will also help
ensure that the result is maintained over time.
Monitoring IT Security Project Quality
Another element of planning IT security project quality is deﬁning how
you’ll monitor the quality of your security project plan. Suppose one of
your projects is to harden network servers? Each server will be audited to
determine the server role, the types of connections, the criticality of the
server’s data (or role), and the types of security measures that will be
applied. Next, the servers will be hardened one-by-one based on the
audit results and the relevant security standards.
Let’s look at a brief example. Suppose Max is assigned to harden the
database server. On the day that Max is changing some of the server set-
tings, he’s distracted by a personal problem he’s having and he’s been on
the phone throughout the day trying to sort it out. He’s not paying close
www.syngress.com
Building Quality into IT Security Projects • Chapter 4
85

attention and he accidentally skips over three critical steps. He mistakenly
reports that he’s completed the task and everything is set.That evening,
the servers are taken down for routine maintenance and the database
server fails to come back online properly.Another member of the IT
staff, Jill, knows that Max worked on the server earlier that day, so she
calls him at home and asks him what changes he made. He says that he
made the changes indicated in the security project plan for the database
server. Jill thanks him and hangs up, and goes to work troubleshooting the
server, without success. Frustrated, she pulls the security project plan out,
looks at the list of steps to be taken, and walks through them again. She
discovers that three key steps were missed. She makes the necessary
changes, makes some notes, reboots the server, and it comes back online
as expected.
This is the most benign scenario—several hours of Jill’s time were
wasted due to an error on Max’s part. We might chalk it up to “these
things happen,” except that this was completely avoidable. In addition,
while it was just a waste of a few hours’ time, suppose this database was
the backend on an e-commerce server and a database error exposed crit-
ical data to users over the Internet? Suppose credit card data were
exposed and hackers managed to grab some of that data before the server
was ﬁnally locked down. Max’s error could have been very costly to the
company, and all because he was simply not paying attention.
So, given that these kinds of things do happen, how can you devise a
security project plan to monitor the quality of your project as you move
forward? One very easy way to implement the method is to create “com-
pletion criteria,” which are checklists with a bit more muscle. Completion
criteria are requirements that deﬁne the successful completion of a task.
(When we look at deﬁning IT security project plan tasks later in this
book, we’ll revisit completion criteria and look at them in a bit more
detail.) However, if Max had used a checklist that described the steps
needed to successfully harden the database server, he would have been less
www.syngress.com
86
Chapter 4 • Building Quality into IT Security Projects

likely to miss three critical steps. Depending on how your company
works and what its culture is like, you may choose to print out tasks
with completion criteria on them and require the IT staff person (in
this case, Max) to initial them after each step is completed.This gives
you a paper trail to follow should things go wrong.
Completion criteria can also be used by a second person, whose pri-
mary responsibility is project quality. For instance, while all security tasks
are important, you and your team may designate 10 or 20 tasks as being
absolutely critical to a sound security project plan.You may have a
second person check the results of these tasks as a backup (or insurance)
plan. While no one likes having their work checked, most people
understand that when security is at stake, the more eyes the better.
Having work double-checked can help protect the company, the net-
work, and the IT staff.Avoiding errors is always better than repairing
errors.Therefore, using completion criteria as a checklist for quality
assurance is a simple, easy-to-implement tool to help maintain the
highest level of quality (and security) possible.
This is just one example of how you can monitor quality in your
security project plan. By making quality a constant focus and part of your
team’s culture, you can ﬁnd ways to monitor it throughout the project
lifecycle that are meaningful and appropriate to your IT security project
plan.
Another reminder: If your company is subject to industry or govern-
mental regulations, you may have very speciﬁc monitoring requirements
that your security project plan must conform to. Even if those regula-
tions do not have speciﬁc monitoring requirements, you can review the
regulations and develop meaningful monitoring requirements for your
project.

Stages of Security Acceptance
An article by Andrew Briney back in 2004 does a great job of helping you
understand how Chief Executive Ofﬁcers (CEOs) and corporate execu-
tives typically view security. Briney identiﬁes four stages of acceptance
regarding the importance of security to an organization. Even today,
two years later, studies show that CEOs are still reluctant to spend
money on security despite the very clear risks it poses to the organiza-
tion. It probably falls back to the concept we discussed, that it’s hard to
quantify the cost of something that does not occur. No one likes to pay
insurance, but most of us insure our cars, homes, and possessions just
in case. Helping CEOs understand that security spending is one of the
most important insurance policies they can have, will help you in moving
your CEO up the ladder of acceptance from “security is a necessary evil”
to “security is quality.” To read the full article, follow this link:

Testing IT Security Project Quality
As part of your IT security project planning process, you should develop
thorough testing security project plans for each of your Individual
Security Area Projects (ISAPS).You can do this in any number of logical
ways, depending both on the nature of the project and the culture (and
sometimes budget) of the company. For example, your test security pro-
ject plans should test each area secured during the project, and an overall
quality security project plan should also run a more comprehensive test
on the entire network.That comprehensive security project plan would
be designed and developed in tandem with your ISAPs so that there are
no gaps in between the various ISAPs. Since network components work
together in an integrated way, it doesn’t make sense to create testing silos
www.syngress.com
88
Chapter 4 • Building Quality into IT Security Projects

that don’t test security as data or users moving across physical and logical
boundaries. In other words, your test security project plans have to mimic
real life scenarios, likely attacks, and normal (and abnormal) usage.
Based on your risk analysis, your testing should accommodate those
identiﬁed risks. However, you might also consider creating tests that don’t
follow normal rules. Hackers are pretty creative and users can do weird
things, so while speciﬁcally addressing known risks is vital, so too is
addressing the potential problems you can foresee.
How much testing is enough? Again, the answer depends on how
conﬁdent you want to be in your security solutions.You’ll need to strike
a balance, but you should err on the side of more, not less, testing, to
ensure your security solutions are working as intended. If you have very
serious security needs, you may choose to work with an external security
consulting ﬁrm to help test your solutions to make sure you’re not falling
victim to “group think.” While an external ﬁrm could be used for an
end-to-end security project plan (from assessment to implementation to
testing), it might make sense for some companies to hire a ﬁrm simply to
test the results of the project. Human nature is such that if we devise the
security project plan, we’re also likely to test the security project plan and
perhaps not test the actual security.Therefore, you might want to have a
different IT group test the security than those who implemented it.This
also helps ensure there is no collusion among IT staff in terms of leaving
back doors open or creating security holes for their work convenience.
Since most security breaches occur from within the organization, you
have to build in safeguards against potential collusion, whether among IT
staff or among others. In a perfect world, we could simply trust everyone,
but we know that in this world, we have to take reasonable safeguards.
Your testing security project plans should cover every angle, not just the
ones you cover in your IT security project plan.

Summary
In this chapter, we included a section on quality for the simple reason
that a high-quality security project plan is clearly preferable to a low-
quality security project plan.There are numerous ways you can ensure
you deliver a high-quality security project plan and result. Quality is
delivered through developing a thoughtful and thorough IT security pro-
ject plan.This is accomplished ﬁrst through planning activities. User
requirements are a great place to start, because if users’ requirements are
not addressed, they will circumvent security in order to get their jobs
done.Technical requirements are developed after functional requirements
so that you make sure your security systems have all the required func-
tionality to deliver a strong security solution before specifying the tech-
nical elements for the project. It’s easy to get distracted by deﬁning how
many failed attempts to access a resource should be allowed before an
administrator is notiﬁed (technical requirements), and the failure to list
administrator notiﬁcation of failed attempts as a functional requirement.
While they go hand-in-hand, it’s a good practice to ﬁrst deﬁne functional
requirements so there are no gaps in your security project plan.
Acceptance criteria are typically tied to user, functional, and technical
requirements.These criteria should be speciﬁed and agreed to at the
outset of the planning phase to ensure that all stakeholders are on the
same page with regard to expected deliverables. When acceptance criteria
are deﬁned in advance, it gives everyone a stationary target to shoot for
when developing and delivering a security project plan.
Your IT security project plan should also include thorough plans for
monitoring and testing IT security project plan results. Remember, there
are two separate entities here—the IT security project(s) itself and the
ongoing IT security maintenance. We’re primarily focused on the IT
security project plans themselves, although you may create a security pro-
ject plan that deﬁnes how ongoing security will be maintained, moni-
tored, and tested.

Planning IT Security Project Quality
 Planning quality in an IT security project plan means that quality
must be a mindset, not just a speciﬁc set of deliverables.
 Quality can be managed through several planning mechanisms,
including well-deﬁned user requirements, functional requirements,
technical requirements, acceptance criteria, and quality metrics.
 Including user requirements helps the IT security project plan meet
the end-user’s needs, and will ultimately yield higher quality and
better security.
 Deﬁning functional requirements helps ensure all functionality
required by the various systems is included in the security project
plan.
 Deﬁning technical requirements typically follows deﬁning
functional requirements.
 Quality metrics can sometimes be difﬁcult to deﬁne for a security
project, but looking for opportunities to quantify this data will
improve quality and security.
 Change management procedures ensure that when changes are
needed to the security project plan, they are evaluated,
implemented, tested, and integrated in a manner that maintains or
increases security.
 Standard operating procedures are used to ensure that the security
solutions that are implemented are maintained on a day-to-day
basis. Involving key stakeholders in deﬁning SOPs at the appropriate
time can improve the actual and perceived quality of your project.

Monitoring IT Security Project Quality
 Quality begins in the planning stages, but is implemented
throughout the security project plan lifecycle. Monitoring the
quality of project results is critical to a successful project.
 How you monitor quality throughout your IT security project plan
will depend, in part, upon the nature of the project. Work with your
team to identify ways to monitor quality as you complete project
work.
 One way to manage and monitor quality is to use completion
criteria for each task.This is a list of steps that must be completed
before a task is considered complete.
 Completion criteria can be used by the person performing the task
to ensure all steps are done in the proper sequence.
 Completion criteria can be used by someone monitoring quality to
perform “spot checks.” In some situations, it might be appropriate to
have someone step through the most critical security tasks a second
time to double-check results.
Testing IT Security Project Quality
 Testing IT security project plan results is the third element of
delivering a quality IT security project plan. If you don’t test the
solutions you put in place, you have no idea if an attacker would be
successful or not.
 Develop a test security project plan for each area of security you
will be working on.Also develop an overall security project test plan
so that you don’t focus solely on the areas you’ve worked on.
 You might choose to hire an outside consulting ﬁrm to test your
security to uncover blind spots you and your team may have.
 If you choose to design, implement, and test your own security
solutions, make sure you get a broad representation of people
together who can help think of all the things that could go wrong.
www.syngress.com
92
Chapter 4 • Building Quality into IT Security Projects

 Errors and omissions are the biggest holes in security and are the
ones attackers are most likely to ﬁnd and exploit.
 There is no single right answer to the question,“How much testing
is enough?”You and your team will need to assess the risk of attack
and the consequences of a successful intrusion or attack, and
determine at what point you feel comfortable that your systems are
a secure as they can be within your company’s budgetary
constraints.

Introduction
If you’re an experienced project manager, you’ve learned that a security
project team makes or breaks a project.A security project plan is nothing
but a “to do” list until you have a security project team compiled of
competent people who can actually do the work and deliver the results.
Therefore, if you don’t spend time planning and organizing your security
project team, you’re missing a huge opportunity, and simultaneously cre-
ating a big problem for yourself as project manager. In this chapter, we’re
going to talk about how to go about forming a security project team for
an Information Technology (IT) security project.The material in this
chapter intersects with much of the other data presented throughout the
book, because the security project team touches all aspects of the pro-
ject. Even if you’re an experienced project manager (which we’re
assuming you are), you’ll gain valuable insight and knowledge from
looking at your security project team through the security perspective
presented in this chapter.
Identifying IT Security 
Project Team Requirements
An IT security project team is not a static group of people; its member-
ship should shift and change as you move through the various stages of a
project.There will be some people who need to be involved in the initial
planning stages to ensure various stakeholder needs are met. However,
that same group may not be needed again until the project is in its ﬁnal
stages and you’re ready to deﬁne standard operating procedures to main-
tain security in daily operations.Therefore, your ﬁrst task should be to
gather your core IT security project team and deﬁne the requirements for
that team.There are a number of things that should be considered beyond
just who should be involved. Outside of the stafﬁng issue, you should give
some consideration to the following areas when forming your IT security
project team:
www.syngress.com
96
Chapter 5 • Forming the IT Security Project Team

■
Organizational Which departments, divisions, or sections of
the company should be represented on the security project team?
Is there a budget issue (e.g., hiring freeze, cutbacks, and so forth)
that could impact your project? What about unions or collective
bargaining issues that will impact team membership (or the pro-
ject itself)? Are layoffs imminent or is your company in a hiring
mode?
■
Technical What are the different technical specialties that
should be represented on the security project team? Are there
different types of technologies (e.g., engineering approaches, soft-
ware languages, equipment) that should be represented or that
will have to be coordinated? What are the technical interfaces
that require special knowledge (e.g., database, network, wireless,
Web, Virtual Private Network (VPN), e-commerce, and so forth)?
■
Logistical Where are security project team members located?
Are they local, remote, overseas? How will you coordinate their
activities? What technologies will you use to facilitate team and
project work?
■
Interpersonal What types of formal and informal relationships
exist among team members (or potential team members)? Are
there known relationships you can leverage or known issues you
can avoid?
■
Political What alliances exist among various stakeholders and
how will these inﬂuence your project (for better or for worse)?
Are there any people on the IT security project team with polit-
ical clout, or any members on the team that seem to be out of
favor politically? How will this affect your IT project?
Roles and Responsibilities
Once you’ve reviewed the environmental elements, you should identify
the key roles and responsibilities needed for the IT security project team.
Do this without regard to the people in your IT department or in your
www.syngress.com
Forming the IT Security Project Team • Chapter 5

organization.You need to deﬁne an optimal environment ﬁrst, then you
can pare it down to meet both budget and personnel constraints. If you
start with a limited view of your stafﬁng needs, you’re almost certain to
develop a short-sighted plan.Also, if you start thinking of who can ﬁll
which role, you may inadvertently have a bias toward (or against) partic-
ular people who are currently in certain roles.This, too, would be a mis-
take.The ﬂip side, however, is that if there is someone in a certain role
that you know from past experience (or political savvy) will be a
“required” member of your security project team, you’ll have to plan
around that fact. Sometimes that’s a good thing, other times it’s a hin-
drance, but as the security project team manager, you have to deal with
these issues.
Roles and responsibilities within your IT security project team are
not the same as competencies and staff. Deﬁning roles and responsibilities
is independent of who should take them on. People are far more produc-
tive when they know what is expected of them and how they ﬁt into the
team, so spend time deﬁning these roles. If you need to “borrow” four
database administrators for your project, make sure they all understand the
role they are expected to play as part of your IT security project team,
and that they understand their various roles among themselves. Resist the
urge to let them sort it out by themselves, since how they deﬁne roles
and responsibilities may not map to your needs or your approach.Also,
resist the urge to let the person with the biggest title win. One best prac-
tice you might want to incorporate into your project management skills
is to avoid using organizational titles. If one person comes in as Senior
Database Analyst and another comes is as Associate Database Analyst,
don’t just let the pecking order rule the day. Clearly deﬁne how you want
these folks to interact, who their lead is, and to whom they all report to
in your project structure.
Deﬁning responsibilities typically includes deﬁning deliverables or
what each security project team member will be responsible for accom-
plishing.Again, the more clarity you start with, the better the result.
www.syngress.com
98
Chapter 5 • Forming the IT Security Project Team

Working with each member of the team to establish clear, well-deﬁned
responsibilities also helps ask and answer questions about conﬂicting roles,
responsibilities, and deliverables.Avoid overlapping responsibilities, and
work with the security project team to clarify any issues before getting
started on the project work itself.These responsibilities and deliverables
also become part of the security project team members’ performance
review process at project closeout.
To aid in your thinking, we’ve included a list of roles that might be
appropriate to your IT security project. It’s not an exhaustive list, but it
should help get you started:
■
Manager or team lead 
■
Assistant managers, supervisors, team or group leaders 
■
Help Desk staff

Business Intelligence…
Evenly Distributing the Opportunities
We all know that some projects are more interesting to work on than
others. Some projects are exciting because they are cutting edge, they
use brand new technology, and they have high impact and high visibility.
Those are the projects on which reputations can be made. Then there are
the mundane, utility projects that have little excitement or interest, but
must be done.
As IT manager, you should strive to ensure that even your best per-
formers have to work on some of the boring projects. The only way
someone becomes a star performer is to be given opportunities to shine
by working on projects with some challenge, visibility, and so on. If you
keep allowing your best staff to monopolize the best projects, your
junior staff may never get a chance to grow, learn, and show what
they’re capable of. One way to mitigate the risk of assigning junior mem-
bers to a high visibility or critical project is to assign a senior team
member to oversee the junior team member’s work. This accomplishes
two key objectives: it mitigates your risk with the junior team member,
and it helps develop leadership and management skills in senior team
members. Providing these kinds of growth opportunities in a controlled
and manageable manner is part of what makes people enjoy their work.
Most people are far more satisﬁed working in an environment that lever-
ages their talents and provides opportunities for growth.
Competencies
In addition to identifying roles and responsibilities, your IT security pro-
ject plan will undoubtedly require very speciﬁc sets of competencies.
Again, avoid thinking about speciﬁc people at this point, and work to
identify the competencies required.This is one area that will probably
require some revision down the road (e.g., your corporate IT security
project plan will include several Individual Security Area Projects (ISAPs),
and those ISAP’s may each contain very specialized competencies.You
www.syngress.com
100
Chapter 5 • Forming the IT Security Project Team

want someone very familiar with Intrusion Prevention Systems and
Intrusion Detection Systems (IPS/IDS) to implement your IPS/IDS solu-
tion, and you want someone very familiar with your database structure
and use to help design and implement a database security solution).These
are competencies you can identify generically as you go through your
planning process and develop additional detail as it becomes available.
Keep in mind that competencies are not conﬁned to technical com-
petencies.You should consider including competencies from other areas
such as:
■
Technical
■
Communication (verbal and written)
■
Training
■
Negotiation
■
Translating technical language into user language
■
Reporting
■
Legal, ﬁnancial, regulatory
Technical
Obviously, your competencies list would not be complete without a full
list of the required technical competencies as a starting point.Though
you’ve probably got this covered, it is wise to sit down and review which
technical competencies are required for all of your IT security projects
(i.e., the corporate IT security plan and the ISAPs).This may be a list you
have to re-visit a few times as your IT security project plans come into
focus. Creating this list of required technical competencies can help you
determine if you have the expertise in-house, if you need to train internal
staff, if you need to hire additional staff, or if you need to hire an external
vendor. Knowing where your technical competencies are and where your
gaps are will help you create a viable stafﬁng plan. Having untrained or
www.syngress.com
Forming the IT Security Project Team • Chapter 5
101

unknowledgeable (or outright incompetent) staff performing critical or
complex technical security tasks can leave gaping holes in your security
systems.
Communication
Let’s face it. IT departments are not known for their wonderful commu-
nications skills. Unfortunately, many IT departments do a terrible job
communicating, probably because the IT staff are so busy working on
technical issues that they forget (or try to forget) there are users out there
awaiting information, responses, and updates. When putting together your
IT security project team, look for one or more people who are good at
communicating and enjoy it.You may have to look for someone outside
your department to help, by having them attend key meetings and write
up brief status updates and announcements on behalf of your security
project team.That’s ﬁne, as long as you make communicating with key
stakeholders a deliverable in your security project plan. Remember, pro-
ject success is as dependent on perceived success as it is on actual success
(perceived success, in fact, trumps actual results).Therefore, it is very
important to ﬁnd someone who is good at communicating, who can add
communication tasks to the security project plan and be the task owner
and implement those plans.
Training
Training is another competency you should have represented on your
security project team. Someone with a training background or perspec-
tive can help identify areas that will require IT staff training and user
training. Including this competency also creates awareness of the need for
training, and can help ensure that training tasks are either included in the
security project plan or are appropriately tied in with the security project
plan through the Training and Development department.
www.syngress.com
102
Chapter 5 • Forming the IT Security Project Team

Negotiation
You may not think that negotiation is a necessary competency for an IT
security project team, but it can be helpful to have, especially when you
have to negotiate a bigger budget, the loan of several key staff people for
a months-long security project team, or with a vendor for a large secu-
rity-related purchase. Negotiation is how business gets done, and if you
have someone on your security project team that is comfortable (and suc-
cessful) at negotiating, it can help your project tremendously. Keep in
mind, however, that not everyone approaches negotiating in a similar
manner. In some respects, it’s very cultural (country-to-country, com-
pany-to-company, department-to-department, individual-to-individual).
Ensure that if you bring someone to the security project team to help
negotiate, that he or she has similar values to you and your team. If the
negotiator believes in “winning at any cost” and your attitude is “create a
win-win outcome,” you’re likely to get a result from your negotiator that
you don’t like. Set clear rules and boundaries if you have someone else
negotiate on your (or your team’s) behalf.
Translating Technical Language
IT people sometimes forget how to say things in plain English. Rather
than explain that the server requires Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
(SMTP) server authentication and that you’ll be implementing Secure
Password Authentication (SPA), they simply tell the user that they’d be
securing outgoing email.The ability to translate technical language and
jargon into plain English (or some other language) is a competency that
is sometimes under-represented on IT teams. By explaining things simply
and clearly, and in an appropriate (e.g., not condescending or simple-
minded) manner, you can help users and executives become more com-
fortable with what’s going on behind the scenes. Remember that most
executives and users think IT is spooky, secret stuff. By translating it for
“normal” people, your IT project details can be more accessible and
therefore less threatening.

Reporting
Have you ever noticed how some people have a knack for coming up
with perfect report formats? They seem to instinctively know what data
belongs together, how it should be organized, and how one piece of data
relates to another.These folks can be valuable assets to a security project
team, so you may want to include reporting as a competency. Having one
or more security project team members with this ability can help you
develop meaningful reporting procedures. Various stakeholders require
different types and frequencies of reporting.You could have a security
project team member with a strength in reporting plan the various types
of reports.This can contribute signiﬁcantly to perceived project success,
since most people are satisﬁed with accurate, timely information.
Legal, Financial, and Regulatory
When you’re dealing with an IT security project plan, you have to make
sure that your legal, ﬁnancial, and regulatory bases are covered. Identifying
the competencies needed for your IT security project(s) and including
them in your security project plan, will help ensure that you pull in the
right professionals at the right time, and that you leave no gaps in your
security project plan.
Once you’ve created the list of competencies (some may be required,
and some may be optional that could enhance the project), you can begin
laying out a rough timeline for when those competencies will be needed
(e.g., you might ﬁnd that you’ll need the Legal department to review the
regulatory requirements and translate them into plain language at the
outset of the project.) You may not need the Legal department again for
your security project plan, or you may need it to advise the Human
Resources department on the implications of performing employee back-
ground checks on all employees who will have access to Research &
Development (R&D) data. If you can identify when during the project
lifecycle you’re likely to require these various competencies, you will have
a head start on your stafﬁng requirements and stafﬁng plan.
www.syngress.com
104
Chapter 5 • Forming the IT Security Project Team

There may be additional competencies not listed here that your IT
security project plan will require.This is a good time to give it some
serious thought, and to get your security project team to think the pro-
ject through to help identify needed competencies.The more thought
you give to it now, the less it will keep you up at night.
Identifying Stafﬁng 
Requirements and Constraints
Once you’ve identiﬁed your required competencies, you have to begin
looking at your stafﬁng requirements, which match competencies with
actual people in (or outside of) your organization. Look for the optimal
candidates for each competency ﬁrst, and then make note of the second,
third, and fourth choices. Devise strategies for ﬁlling gaps, either through
training, hiring, or contracting. In some cases, it may be appropriate to
divide your IT security project plans into phases and shift your compe-
tencies accordingly. Sometimes you can reasonably delay hiring or
training until a later phase.
Reality usually sets in once you’ve created your “dream team” (e.g.,
Jill is temporarily on assignment in Madrid, Spain; Craig is your best
IPS/IDS guy, but he’s out with a family situation for another month; John
is your go-to guy for all Internet-related work, but he’s already working
overtime to get the new Web site up and running; Lisa is absolutely your
best security administrator [users, access controls, auditing, log ﬁle man-
agement, and so forth], but she’s recently been promoted and will be
heading off to a new position at a regional ofﬁce within the month.) You
know the drill; your best people are not always available and yet you have
a project to plan, implement, manage, and complete. Determining your
stafﬁng constraints is where you insert a bit of organizational reality into
your “perfect world” security project plan, so that you can actually get
your project work done.
Sometimes your stafﬁng constraints are ﬁnancial.You may need four
database administrators to help design and implement database security,
but you’d have to temporarily transfer them to your IT payroll and your
www.syngress.com
Forming the IT Security Project Team • Chapter 5
105

budget doesn’t have the room. Other times you may need to hire a con-
tractor with a speciﬁc skill set or hire a new position or bring in a secu-
rity consultant—all while you’re being tasked with improving security for
about 5 percent of your overall IT budget. While life and budgets aren’t
always fair, your job as IT security project manager is to ﬁnd creative
solutions to these problems. Brainstorm with your security project team
or make a strong business case to your security project plan sponsor.
Whatever you do, you’ll have to live with stafﬁng constraints and nego-
tiate your way through the process.
This might also be a milestone or checkpoint that you can use to sit
down with your security project plan sponsor and discuss your stafﬁng
needs. Since most company’s budgets are not unlimited, you’re probably
going to have to make a few tough decisions. Best practices include going
to your security project plan sponsor prepared with your stafﬁng needs,
costs, and alternatives. Don’t march in with a list of demands, and don’t
expect your sponsor to solve your problems for you. Be prepared, and
come in with various alternatives along with the risks and rewards of
those alternatives. Work cooperatively and proactively with your security
project plan sponsor to ﬁnd acceptable solutions to the stafﬁng and
budget limitations that you might encounter.
Also keep in mind that if you cannot gather the people you need to
ﬁll critical (or required) roles or to provide required competencies, your
project is at risk of failing.Though you haven’t moved beyond the plan-
ning stage yet, you will be positioning your project to fail if you take off
without adequate resources and simply hope that something will change
down the line.As much as you might not like being the bearer of bad
news, you have to work hard with your security project plan sponsor to
ﬁnd a reasonable solution. If your sponsor “orders” you to proceed despite
your lack of critical resources, you will have a serious problem on your
hands for two reasons. First, it will spell disaster for most projects and,
second, you will have a serious security problem in the making. If you
can’t ﬁnd someone competent enough to install or conﬁgure a new IDS
system, you could potentially open the ﬂoodgates for hackers—not a
good situation and one that will absolutely come back and fall on your
www.syngress.com
106
Chapter 5 • Forming the IT Security Project Team

shoulders.This can be a difﬁcult situation, but unless you’re going to get
ﬁred for saying,“I don’t want to proceed until I have the needed
resources for success,” hold ﬁrm and negotiate for what you need. Don’t
hold a hard line—get creative, be ﬂexible, and ﬁnd the necessary middle
ground to get your security project plan work accomplished successfully.
The goal is to increase security from its existing state and to ﬁnd out
whether or not you have the right resources to help you get there.
Acquiring the Needed Staff
Once you’ve determined who you need and when, you’ll need to put
some thought into how you will actually “acquire” those people for your
security project plan. Some companies have very formal procedures that
must be followed, that track time, expense, department, and project num-
bers. In other companies, it’s a negotiated process (e.g.,“You need Justin?
You can have him two hours a day for the next month. I can’t afford to
have him away from his other work any more than that.”). Be sure to talk
with the person’s direct supervisor or manager to get the okay ﬁrst. No
one likes their staff yanked out from under them (or enticed onto a pro-
ject with promises of fame and glory), so be sure to use common cour-
tesy when gathering your security project team. In addition, there may be
something about Justin’s performance that you don’t know. Suppose Justin
has just been put on a performance improvement plan because he’s been
spending most of his days surﬁng the Internet, and not getting much
work done? Suppose Justin really is an incredibly bright guy, but doesn’t
get along well with others? Do you really want him on your security
project team? The ﬂip side is that you should try to ensure that the
people you think you want on the team will actually be valuable mem-
bers.You can ask others who they’d recommend for a particular role or to
provide a particular competency, to see whose name keeps popping up. If
Justin’s name never comes up, it should make you wonder if he has
trouble working well with others, doesn’t carry his weight, talks inces-
santly, or has some other behavior that causes people to avoid working
with him.
www.syngress.com
Forming the IT Security Project Team • Chapter 5
107

Beyond that, you’ll need to think about some of the routine aspects of
managing a team, including:
■
Where will the team meet and work?
■
What procedure is needed to formally pull someone onto the 
project?
■
What cost accounting procedures are required to track personnel
costs?
■
How are external staff (vendors, contractors, other departmental
staff) acquired and managed?
■
How you will handle stafﬁng if project timelines slip?
At this stage of your IT security project plan, you may not have
enough detail to answer these questions; however, they should be
answered at some point. Project management is an iterative process, so
you will likely have to review these questions periodically as you plan and
implement your security project plans.
Forming the IT Security Project Team
Your IT security project team will likely require a rotating or changing
cast of characters, so you may want to name your various teams (e.g., a
“project deﬁnition” team, a “requirements” team, a “communications”
team, a “training team,” and so forth).There may be some people who are
members of several teams and others who are members of only one team.
If you want to get creative and have fun, you can let the teams name
themselves around a common theme (so there’s some relation and they
can be easily remembered). Once your teams are formed, your ﬁrst step is
to create team rosters.This will help the team members know who’s on
the team and how to contact other team members. It will also help you
as you move through your various projects, since some teams won’t ﬁre
up until later in the project lifecycle.

Chapter 5 • Forming the IT Security Project Team

Identify Training Needs
At this point, you’ll also need to identify your initial training needs.You
have already identiﬁed your project’s required competencies and the
people needed to provide those competencies. However, if your company
is like most, you have a few gaps between the needed competencies and
the available staff. Determine if you need to provide training to ﬁll 
those gaps.
Whether you provide training or hire external consultants, contrac-
tors, or vendors, you’ll need to make sure there’s room in your project
budget for these additional costs.These are the kinds of costs that often
sneak up on you and cause you to blow your project budget even before
the project has gotten underway.This is another checkpoint between you
and your security project plan sponsor that you can use to perhaps shift
some of the training costs to the Training department or the Human
Resources department (if appropriate), or to ask for additional funds
speciﬁcally earmarked for training.
Team Processes and Procedures
If you’re an experienced IT project manager, you probably have a hard
drive folder or notebook full of project processes and procedures that
you’ve developed over time. If so, this is the time to pull them out and
review which ones you’ll need, and which ones that may need to be
modiﬁed to meet the needs of this particular project. We’ve provided a
refresher list for you, but if you need a more thorough review, go back
through your IT project management documents to make sure you’ve
covered all the bases.

security improvements, especially if you are subject to various regulatory
or legal requirements.The problem with some of these requirements is
that they are vague or unclear, and they leave organizations with a lot of
questions about exactly how to implement them. While the legal
authorities are sorting it all out, you can attempt to make sure your bases
are covered by developing processes and procedures for documenting

everything (including your documentation) so that you have the needed
data at hand.
Your security project may require other very speciﬁc processes.
However, make sure that any and all processes and procedures you intro-
duce actually help drive the project forward. Some people mistake process
for product, meaning they think that all of the busy work associated with
developing processes and ensuring people comply with the processes
actually accomplishes security project plan work. In fact, processes and
procedures that are overly burdensome will grind your project to a halt.
Check with your security project team about what processes and proce-
dures will help them get their jobs done. If you believe additional pro-
cesses are required, check with the team to ensure they’ll actually help.
Process for process’s sake is just a waste of time.
Team Kick-off Meeting
At the beginning of the project, you should schedule a security project
team kick-off meeting that includes all members of the team.You may
choose to include those who will participate in the project in later
phases, in order to create a cohesive team and to provide a sense of
starting off together. Planning this meeting (and subsequent team meet-
ings) will help it be both interesting and productive.The security project
team kick-off meeting is the ﬁrst and best opportunity to get people
excited about the project, and to assist them in forming the necessary
team relationships that will help the project move forward.A solid foun-
dation for the security project team will weather any bumps in the road
that may occur later on.
Keep in mind that an effective meeting is one that has a speciﬁc pur-
pose. We have all attended meetings that wandered around and at the end
of the allotted time, nothing was accomplished. If you want people to
attend your meetings, make them so action-packed and useful that no
one wants to miss one. Clearly state the purpose of the meeting in the
invitation.Attach or later forward a meeting agenda with clearly deﬁned
objectives and outcomes. Start and end the meeting on time, actively
manage the meeting, move it along, and keep the conversation on topic.

Assign action items for follow up along with due dates and owners. If
meetings are productive, your team will attend. If meetings are a waste of
their time, they’ll ﬁnd excuses not to attend and security project work
will often begin to fall behind schedule.
The team kick-off meeting sets the tone.You can start your project off
on the right foot by holding an effective meeting with your new team.

Geography and Project Teams
We all know that IT security project teams can be (and often are) geo-
graphically dispersed around a country or around the globe. If you’re
managing a security project team that is not centrally located, your com-
munication skills are even more important. If you’re managing a global
team, you have your work cut out for you, especially if you don’t have
existing relationships with some of your team members. Keep in mind
that people in different countries and cultures communicate differently,
they approach work differently, they interact differently, and they
respond differently to feedback, criticism, and debate. If you are man-
aging a global team for the ﬁrst time, you should make a concerted
effort to understand the culture from which your team members come
and how they view work and their participation on the team. Remember,
too, that security may be viewed very differently from one country to the
next. Finally, keep in mind that terminology should be well-deﬁned; you
should check for understanding before assuming everyone is on the
same page. While technological terms are somewhat “universal” in
nature, be sure that everyone has the same understanding—whether
they’re across town or across the globe.
If you’re looking for a few communication tools that work with
worldwide teams, consider instant messaging, email, Skype, Voice Over
Internet Protocol (VoIP), and any one of the variety of online collabora-
tion tools such as GoToMeeting.com, WebEx.com, LiveMeeting.com, or
Windows NetMeeting (or many others) in order to collaborate in as near
real-time as possible.

Chapter 5 • Forming the IT Security Project Team

Summary
Forming the security project team is one of the most important planning
tasks, because projects don’t just run themselves and project tasks don’t
just magically get done—they rely on people to do them.Therefore, the
people you surround yourself with on this project will be the key to suc-
cess.Taking time to start at the top and deﬁne the roles, responsibilities,
and competencies needed will help you avoid narrowing your focus too
early. Often if we like or dislike someone with a particular skill or com-
petency, our decision making can be inﬂuenced. Starting with the imper-
sonal data will help ensure you create a solid list before focusing in on
the speciﬁc people you need.
Since there are few companies where people are just sitting around
waiting for their next assignment, you will have to contend with a variety
of stafﬁng issues and constraints. How they manifest will vary from com-
pany to company; you’re probably well aware of the issues you’re likely to
face.This is a good time to sit down and talk with your project sponsor
to make sure you have his or her support and to help you gain the
resources you need to ensure a successful project. If you are unable to
secure the necessary people (skills, competencies, roles) for your project,
you’re headed for a very rocky road ahead. Be ﬂexible and creative when
looking for ways to resolve stafﬁng constraints, but don’t launch a project
with glaring stafﬁng holes either.
Deﬁne project processes and procedures from A to Z so your team
can get its work done quickly and efﬁciently.They should know how,
when, and to whom to submit a status report and what data should be in
that report.They should know how to notify the team or you of a
problem, and how to escalate and resolve problems.They should under-
stand what constitutes a change, how to submit a change request, and
what the procedures are for managing change requests throughout the
project lifecycle. Processes and procedures help the project run smoothly
and they help you avoid having to reinvent the wheel from project to
project.

Identifying IT Security Project Team Requirements
 Organizational, technical, logistical, interpersonal, and political
requirements should be considered when forming your security
project team.
 Roles and responsibilities should be identiﬁed for the security
project team, to help everyone form a clear picture of where and
how they ﬁt in.
 Competencies should be deﬁned without regard to which
speciﬁc person or people will provide those competencies. Start
with your ideal “wish list” and pare it down, as needed.
 Competencies can include (but are not limited to) technical,
communication (verbal and written), training, negotiation,
translating technical language into user language, reporting, legal,
ﬁnancial, and regulatory.
Identifying Stafﬁng Requirements and Constraints
 Once you’ve identiﬁed the skills and competencies you need for
your security project team, you can begin identifying people to
ﬁll roles or to provide speciﬁc competencies.
 You may ﬁnd that you have roles or competencies required for
the project that you cannot ﬁll with company resources.You’ll
have to devise a plan for obtaining the necessary resources you
need, and check with your security project plan sponsor.
 Stafﬁng is always inﬂuenced by various constraints, from vacation
time to other company obligations, to politics and beyond.Your
job as project manager is to make sure you have the resources
you need to deliver a quality IT security project.
www.syngress.com
114
Chapter 5 • Forming the IT Security Project Team

 If the quality of your project will be signiﬁcantly impacted by
stafﬁng constraints, you should work closely with your security
project plan sponsor to address those deﬁciencies. Moving
forward as if resources will magically appear or problems will
disappear is unwise.
Acquiring Needed Staff
 Give some thought to how you will actually “acquire” the staff
you need for your security project team. Consider your
company’s culture, organizational style, and stafﬁng levels.
 Make a practice of talking to a person’s supervisor or manager
before talking directly to a staff person you’d like to join your
security project team. It’s polite and may save you problems
later on.
 Ask around to ﬁnd out who other people would recommend for
a particular role or to provide a speciﬁc competency.This gives
you a clue as to how others view individuals within the
organization. If someone is very smart but impossible to work
with, you might think twice about inviting him or her to the
security project team if you have other options.
Forming The IT Security Project Team
 As soon as you know who the members of your security project
team are, create a team roster.This provides everyone a list of
team members and contact information and begins to create a
sense of belonging to a team.
 You may create several sub-teams and provide sub-team rosters
for those participating later in the project lifecycle or those
participating on a particular section of the project.

 Once you’ve put your security project team together, you should
look at their training needs. It’s more common than not that you
were unable to get your “dream team” and some skills gaps may
exist.Addressing training needs at the outset will help you plan
and budget appropriately.
 This is also a good point to deﬁne security project team processes
and procedures.You may have a fairly standard list of these that
you can reuse, or you may have to deﬁne new ones just for this
project.A thorough set of processes and procedures helps team
members be more productive with less effort.
 Remember that security-related processes and procedures,
especially those required by law or other regulation, should be
built into your security project planning process.
 Be sure to plan a security project team kick-off meeting, so that
you can begin to create a sense of the team and let everyone
know that the project is underway.

Introduction
We’ve arrived at what many consider the heart of the project manage-
ment planning stage. Each of the other activities described in earlier
chapters of this book is vital to the success of the project, but some of
what is required in those other steps can’t be fully completed until the
work described in this chapter is complete. Once you complete this
chapter, you should go back and review the ﬁrst ﬁve chapters to revisit
and revise your data.
In this chapter, we deﬁne the speciﬁc tasks that make up the project
work package or “deliverables.” Keep in mind that we’re discussing two
different project types in this book: the overarching master security pro-
ject plan, and the smaller, individual security area project plans.Together,
you have a total security project plan that incorporates the speciﬁc secu-
rity elements relevant to your company. In later chapters, we show you
Work Breakdown Structures (WBS) for various individual security area
project plans. If you’re familiar with WBS, this chapter provides details
related to security that will be helpful to you. If you’re a bit rusty on your
project management skills, this chapter will also provide a quick refresher.
Creating the IT Security 
Project Work Breakdown Structure
The WBS is like a “to do” list only with more muscle. It is a list of all the
major and minor tasks that need to be accomplished in a project. It is
most easily created by starting with the three to ﬁve project objectives
you created in Chapter 3.Those three to ﬁve major objectives can each
be broken down into major tasks that, when completed, would achieve
that particular objective. Be sure that your WBS tasks are at the same
level. Many people have a tendency to dig down into the detail on some
tasks, but not on others, so keep this in mind. Some people ﬁnd it helpful
to use a standard outline form to ensure their WBS makes sense. For
example, suppose your project was to secure your home wireless network.
The major steps would be:
www.syngress.com
118
Chapter 6 • Planning the IT Security Project

1. Conﬁgure what router to use unique to Service Set Identiﬁer
(SSID).
1.1Log into the Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) or router
administrator account.
1.2Locate the access point name and modify the default name to
a unique name.
1.3Locate the SSID and change the default name to a unique
name.
1.4Log out of the WAP or router administrator account.
2. Disable the SSID broadcast.
3. Enable security (Wireless Encryption Protocol [WEP] or Wi-Fi
Protected Access [WPA]).
4. Conﬁgure Media Access Control (MAC) address ﬁltering.
If 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, or 1.4 were at the same level as 2, 3 or 4, you would
not have good construction (e.g., because 1c is at a deeper level of detail
than items 2 or 3). By using this outline form, you can insert detail as you
think of it, while keeping track of the levels.There are many different
ways people create the WBS. Some advocate simply listing out all the
tasks you can possibly think of and ordering them later. However, most
people think through tasks in a fairly linear way, so creating an outline
and then popping in details that may come to mind out of order is also
an acceptable way of approaching the WBS.
The key is not to get sidetracked by trying to place your tasks in
order at the same time you’re thinking of them. If you’re working on this
with your initial project team (a recommended approach), you should try
to use a white board and simply list all the tasks you can collectively
think of and then organize them. If you do it this way, you will ﬁnd that
tasks at all levels of the WBS pop out in random order, and that’s ﬁne.
Capture them and order them later. If you try to approach this too
methodically, you’re likely to overlook or omit something, because you’ll
be too busy trying to keep everything in order rather than making sure
you’re covering all your bases.

A sample security WBS for an Information Technology (IT) security
project plan might look something like that shown in Figure 6.1. Notice
that we’ve stayed at a fairly high level at this point. We’re assuming we’ve
already audited network security and identiﬁed security needs, though
these can be part of a master security project plan. (Chapter 10 walks you
through a security assessment and auditing project plan.) We’ve got a bit
of detail under task 2, but we’ve indented those subtasks and used a sub-
numbering system to indicate the relationship of those tasks to the top-
level task. Later, we can refer just to task 2.4 or 2.4.1 (a subtask of that
task), and readily understand the relationship among these tasks. In later
chapters, we walk through more speciﬁc WBS structures for Individual
Security Area Projects (ISAPs).The structure shown in Figure 6.1 is not
the only structure your WBS can take, but it is commonly used and is
probably familiar to you.

In any security-related project, there’s a good chance you’ll ﬁnd tasks
that span the boundaries between two different projects. We’ve talked

about the corporate IT security project as separate from the individual
security area projects (ISAPs), but in reality, there are all interrelated.
When you’re creating your security project plan, you’re well aware of the
fact that you can’t look at security in silos. What you do in one area often
impacts another, which is why we describe the corporate IT security pro-
ject plan as the glue that binds the ISAPs together, and ensures you have a
comprehensive approach to security.As you develop your WBS for any
security-related project, be sure to capture tasks that either fall completely
outside the scope of your project, or that span the boundaries.You can
capture them as un-numbered tasks, or you can place them in a “parking
lot” ﬁle. Just be sure to capture them, and make sure they’re addressed at
some point.
Deﬁning Project Tasks and Sub-tasks
As shown in Figure 6.1,Task 2 has four sub-tasks deﬁned.Typically, you
would deﬁne the major tasks and go back and identify the sub-tasks (in
this case 2.1, 2.2, and so forth) afterward. For each major task, you will
then develop sub-tasks. Some IT project managers ﬁnd it helpful to assign
each major task to a subset of the project team and have them work
through the details. For example, you might have your wireless experts
develop the tasks for Task 2, so that they bring their expertise to bear on
the development of those related tasks. Who better to recommend tasks
for securing your wireless network than your wireless experts? While it
may sound obvious, you’d be surprised how many times in the frenzy of
planning a project that these things get overlooked. While planning is
almost always improved by the input of subject matter experts, it is
doubly so with IT security.An error or omission in security can mean
you’ve left the door open for the bad guys.
Though we’re assuming you have strong project management skills, a
quick refresher never hurts. Keep these things in mind while you create
your WBS:
www.syngress.com
Planning the IT Security Project • Chapter 6
121

1. Don’t worry about the order in which you deﬁne your tasks (or
sub-tasks).You can reorder them later.
2. Tasks should use a verb/noun format.Avoid using “Access con-
trol” as a task name. Instead, use “Tighten access control” or “Test
access control” so the intent of the task is clear.
3. Use a numbering system that makes sense to you. One com-
monly used one is shown in Figure 6.2.
4. You can go down any number of levels, depending on the level
of detail you want to deﬁne for each task.There is a point of
diminishing returns, so deﬁne a reasonable amount of detail.
Additional detail can be deﬁned and captured in the task’s details.
5. Once you believe your WBS is complete, review it thoroughly
when you’re alert, refreshed, and focused. Have your security pro-
ject plan team review it for errors or gaps, as well.

Checking Project Scope 
Once you’ve identiﬁed your project’s tasks, sub-tasks, and so on, you
should have a very clear idea of what the project looks like. If not, you
need to do more work on deﬁning your tasks. If your task list is a thou-
sand miles long and ﬁlled with tasks like,“Sharpen all red pencils,” your
task list is too detailed and you need to scale it back a bit.Then, look at
all the tasks and see if they ﬁt within your deﬁned project scope.This is
your ﬁrst real opportunity to do a “scope check” and ensure that all the
work you’ve deﬁned ﬁts within your stated scope. More often than not, a
good WBS will detail more work than was included in the initial scope.
That’s natural, because we tend to be able to better deﬁne the project the
further into it we get. However, the problem it creates is rather obvious—
you have approval to do “X” amount of work and your project plan has
delineated “2X” work.
You have several choices at this point, but the most obvious are to
either scale back your WBS or increase your scope. Now for your spot
quiz: If you increase the scope of your project, what else must change? If
you answered time, budget, or quality, then you know your project man-
agement well. If you increase your scope at this point, you’ll have to rene-
gotiate the amount of time you’ll have to complete the project (more),
the amount of money you’ll need to complete the project (more), or the
quality (less) you’ll be able to deliver if time and cost cannot change.
Your second choice is to look at your security project plan and your
WBS and decide if there are any elements that are not crucial to the suc-
cessful completion of the project. Sometimes when people get into WBS
mode, they start deﬁning their “wish list,” or they include everything they
can think of. Sometimes this can be an effective way to accomplish things
in the organization that has been looking for a project, but most of the
time it just clouds the issue. Clean out your WBS if you can’t change
your scope, time, schedule, or budget. Pare it down to the bare minimum
and re-check your scope.
www.syngress.com
Planning the IT Security Project • Chapter 6
123

IT security projects are tricky to the extent that if your WBS deﬁnes
a scope of work that is larger than the initial discussion or agreement
about the scope, you need to really ask yourself what should “give.”
Should it be the scope or some of the tasks in the WBS? How can you
decide when you’re talking about network security? While our tendency
is usually to say “It’s all important!” the truth is that if you carefully
review your WBS, you may actually ﬁnd tasks that can either be put into
a different security project plan or that may truly be redundant or
optional. Finally, this situation may force you and your team to get a bit
creative and think of ways you can scale things back and actually improve
your security or your security project plan (or both).The old expression
“Necessity is the mother of invention” sometimes holds true, and if you
and your team put your collective minds to it, you may be able to ﬁnd
ways to increase security while scaling back the project scope.
This is also a great time to check in with your security project plan
sponsor. Run the WBS by him or her and gain approval for your WBS
and your scope. If there are problems, now is the time to ﬁnd them and
ﬁx them. If you ﬁnd yourself in the position of having to go to bat for a
larger budget or longer schedule, you should be prepared to make the
business case for this. Remember, it’s natural that you would have a better
idea of the project’s scope once you’ve created your WBS, because the act
of creating the WBS drives clarity. With that clarity should come an
understanding of the areas in which the project has grown. If you believe
these are important areas to include, then clearly link each of these areas
to the business objectives, the risks of not addressing these areas, and
potential alternatives to addressing these areas (e.g., you might prioritize
several of the items and agree to make them part of a Phase II project,
because you and your team believe that, while important, these items may
not be pressing or critical in the near-term). Finding creative solutions
and bringing alternatives to the table is always preferable to saying, in
essence,“We need a bigger budget. Period.” Sometimes that works, espe-
cially if the items are critical areas to address, but often the answer is,
“Find something else to cut out of it then.” It may be a negotiation, but
if your network security is at risk, it’s worth putting some effort into dis-

covering ways to get it done. If you need some fuel for your ﬁre, check
out Chapter 9 where we discuss some of the legal ramiﬁcations of not
securing your network. Better yet, do a bit of Internet research and look
for recent articles pointing out the cost or ramiﬁcations of a security
breach. If you can ﬁnd a company like yours or in the same kind of busi-
ness, it might really drive the point home.There’s nothing like a little
reality check from time to time.
Business Intelligence…
Smaller is Better When it Comes to Scope
As we discussed in Chapter 1, studies have consistently shown that
smaller projects are more successful. That makes sense when you think
about it; it’s easier to get your arms wrapped around a project, it’s easier
to keep staff motivated and focused, it’s easier to monitor progress, and
so on. One of the ﬁrst places you’ll begin to get a sense of the scope of
your project is once you’ve made the ﬁrst or second pass through your
WBS. As you deﬁne the tasks and sub-tasks, you’ll see the scope of the
project more clearly. Sometimes in the process of delineating your WBS,
you see that your scope has expanded signiﬁcantly. Other times, your
WBS may indicate the project isn’t as large and complex as you’d ﬁrst
thought (a somewhat rare occurrence). Using your WBS to gauge your
scope can help you decide whether you need to break your project down
into smaller projects, or whether your scope managed to creep up
during the deﬁnition phase of the project lifecycle. Whatever the case,
your WBS will deﬁne your scope, and this is an excellent time to check
your scope and make the necessary adjustments. If the scope is out of
control at this point, your project is not likely to succeed.
Developing Task Details
There are numerous task details you can include in your IT security pro-
ject plan, but we’re going to focus on two types of details—the most
commonly used task details and the details that speciﬁcally relate to IT
www.syngress.com
Planning the IT Security Project • Chapter 6
125

security. We’re taking a two-pronged approach, because people often skip
over deﬁning even basic task details, and these details (both basic and
security-related) are extremely helpful project management tools.
How you develop your task details is somewhat a matter of personal
project management style, but there are some guidelines that will help
you develop really solid task details. First, the person or group that will be
performing the task is typically the best resource for helping to deﬁne
task details.To go back to our wireless example, you’re better off having
your wireless expert deﬁne the wireless security task details, than having
your database administrator deﬁne them.The experts can usually deﬁne
the task detail more quickly and effectively than the project manager can;
therefore, rather than sitting down one late night and trying to deﬁne all
these task details, begin delegating at this point. It’s an obvious but some-
times overlooked piece of the puzzle.
Owner
The ﬁrst task detail that comes to mind is the task owner. In an IT security
project, you may choose to have security area experts head up the ISAPs;
therefore, they may be considered the owners for tasks related to his or her
individual security area.You may choose to assign ownership of tasks to
those who will oversee the work or to those who will actually do the
work. It depends largely on how your IT organization is structured. In any
case, there is a rule about task ownership that you should heed:“A task
with no owners won’t get done; a task with two owners won’t get done.”
In other words, a task should have only one owner.That owner may or
may not complete the work itself, but he or she is responsible for the
work getting done. If you have two or more task owners, no one takes
responsibility for the task, and you, as the IT project manager, won’t know
who to hold accountable (e.g., Jose says it was Keiko’s responsibility; Keiko
says she thought Manish had it under control; Manish says he thought
Larry was heading it up; and Larry says he thought Jose said (in a meeting
last week) that he had completed the task.Assign one owner per task to
maintain accountability and responsibility for task completion.

126
Chapter 6 • Planning the IT Security Project

Resources
The term resources can be used to indicate anything needed for a security
project plan’s completion, whether that’s people, money, tools, equipment,
software, or supplies. For each task, you should have the task owner (or a
subject matter expert) deﬁne the resources needed for that task. While
they may not know exactly which resources they need, they should
deﬁne (at a minimum) the people or skills required and any known tools,
software, or equipment they can think of.These two types of resources—
people and supplies—are used both in scheduling and in budgeting, so
deﬁning these elements at this stage will be very helpful in developing
your initial project schedule and budget. Remember, project management
is an iterative process, so you’ll probably have to go back to this a few
times to hone the details as the picture becomes clearer.
With an IT security project, you’re likely to need resources that you,
as the project manager, may not know about or even understand. Do you
know what AirSnort is, how it’s used, or what it might cost? Would you
think to include the cost or even require the use of these tools in your
wireless security project plan? (Ironically, many hacker tools are available
as standard tools built right into operating systems, or as free shareware
programs widely available on the Internet). If you’re a wireless security
expert, you might. If you’re an IT manager or an IT project manager that
might not be your strength, therefore, relying on your subject matter
experts to help deﬁne the needed resources for tasks is critical.
Otherwise, you may lack the tools or expertise needed to secure your
network, or you may ﬁnd yourself at the short end of your budget
quicker than anticipated.
Also, because IT security project plans require speciﬁc expertise in key
areas, you should also require your subject matter experts to deﬁne the
type of expertise required to perform a particular security task. If the task
is to review Access Control Lists (ACLs) on several key network objects,
anyone on your IT staff could probably complete that task. However, if
the task is to test the database so that script errors won’t provide an
opening to hackers, there’s a good chance you need a database expert to

help you with that. So, be sure to deﬁne required expertise within your
task resources.This will help ensure you have the expertise needed for the
task, and will also help you better estimate what skills and knowledge
you’ll need to complete your IT security project plan.That might mean
training internal staff or contracting out, but you need to know this going
into the project so that you can properly allocate time, money, and
resources.
Completion Criteria
We brieﬂy discussed completion criteria earlier, so we’ll quickly revisit it
here. Completion criteria are the criteria by which you or anyone else
can determine if a task was completed properly. Completion criteria can
be a simple checklist or a more comprehensive set of standards or proto-
cols. Whatever will be used to determine if the task was successfully com-
pleted should be deﬁned in advance, in the completion criteria for the
task. Often, the task owner or the subject matter expert is the best person
to create these completion criteria; however, sometimes additional
research may be required. It’s also possible that you won’t be able to
deﬁne the completion criteria for some of the tasks until later in the pro-
ject cycle, when you have a better understanding of the project. Deﬁning
completion criteria for a security project is absolutely crucial.The
number of errors and omissions drops signiﬁcantly when you deﬁne the
completion criteria for each task. In addition, when you deﬁne these cri-
teria at the beginning of the security project plan lifecycle (when things
are relatively calm), you reduce your chance of missing something impor-
tant once the project is in full swing.
Also keep in mind that if you have speciﬁc requirements—whether
functional, technical, legal, or regulatory—they should be addressed via
the completion criteria in the tasks. Quality is built into a project through
task details, and one of the most important task details are the completion
criteria. If you need to meet speciﬁc requirements, build this into your
task detail via the completion criteria, to ensure the requirements actually
are met. Otherwise, it’s a bit of a crap shoot.

Schedule
Best practices in project management include the use of the 8/80 rule
when deﬁning the schedule.This rule states that you should not deﬁne any
task that takes less than 8 hours, and no single task should take more than
80 hours.This is a very broad guideline, but it helps on both ends of the
scheduling spectrum. Obviously, if you schedule tasks that are less than 8
hours, you’re headed for an absolute scheduling nightmare. On the other
hand, if you have a task that takes more than 80 hours, there’s a good
chance it can be broken down into smaller tasks that are more manageable.
Once you’ve created your IT security project plan’s WBS (for the
corporate IT security project plan or any of the ISAPs), you can begin
estimating task duration. Let’s take a moment to distinguish between dura-
tion and effort.You’re probably familiar with these two terms, but it’s
important to understand the difference. Duration is the amount of time
you allot for the task to be completed. Effort is the actual amount of time
it takes to complete the task (e.g., you may schedule two weeks (dura-
tion) to implement network server auditing, but the actual task of setting
up that auditing might take a total of 4 hours (effort). Successful security
project plans schedule around duration, not effort. Most of the people
(probably all of them) on your project team have other duties, responsi-
bilities, and deliverables. By scheduling the duration, you’re deﬁning in
what time period the task needs to be completed. One person might
complete the task on Day 1 of the two-week duration, another might not
be able to complete it until Day 14. It’s 4 hours worth of work that has
to be scheduled in among other conﬂicting priorities. Using the duration
will give your security project plan team members the ﬂexibility needed
to complete their tasks in a manner that ﬁts their workload.
Once you’ve deﬁned task duration, you can begin to get a sense of
how long your project will take to complete. We haven’t yet discussed
dependencies, which can push your schedule out further, nor have we
talked about scheduling resources, which can expand or contract your
schedule, but duration will give you a high-level sense of your project’s
overall schedule length.

Budget
If you’ve deﬁned all of your tasks and identiﬁed the needed resources, it
stands to reason you should be able to develop your preliminary budget at
this point, right? Well, yes and no.You can go through your tasks and
identify the resources needed—both in terms of people and supplies—but
that doesn’t necessarily account for all of your IT security costs. It doesn’t
include training (e.g., hiring outside contractors to ﬁll in for three team
members that will be in China starting up a new corporate division for
six weeks during your project).These are the kinds of things that can
break a budget and they often sneak up on you. So, once you’ve deﬁned
your tasks, needed resources, and required expertise, you may want to get
the team together to talk about what you might be missing from your
budget. In an IT security project plan, you almost certainly will require
tools, training, and equipment. Some of those resources will be speciﬁc to
an ISAP, and others will be useful across several ISAPs or in your corpo-
rate IT security project plan. Look for areas where you can leverage
resources to reduce the overall cost of your security project plan budget.
When you can show executives they’re getting more “bang for the buck”’
with some of their IT security expenditures, they may be less reluctant to
approve the purchase.
You may need assistance in creating a budget from your Finance
department. If that type of resource is available, take advantage of it.
Having someone well-versed in creating a line item budget can help
speed the process and make sure you don’t overlook important budget
components.
Dependencies
If you’ve created even one project plan, you know that deﬁning dependen-
cies is a key task in your planning process, because it ultimately determines
the length of your schedule. If you fail to identify dependencies, you will
end up with excessive idle time in the project, or you’ll end up crashing
your schedule to get it completed in time. If your dependencies are
linked to external events, you have additional challenges to consider.
www.syngress.com
130
Chapter 6 • Planning the IT Security Project

In an IT security project, there are numerous interconnected elements
that can impact your schedule that should be listed as dependencies.
Hardening your servers may be dependent upon upgrading several of the
operating systems or some other task.The order in which you perform
these tasks may be vitally important, and identifying the dependencies
properly, and therefore performing the tasks in the requisite order, can liter-
ally mean the difference between having or not having a secure network.
Different people use different methods of identifying and recording
dependencies. Some people like to use sticky notes, placing them on a
whiteboard, drawing lines to deﬁne dependencies, and then loading all of
that data into a project management software program. Others prefer to
identify dependencies within the project management software program
right from the start.Your subject matter experts are a good source of data
about dependencies, because they can tell you that if you do Task 7.2.3
before Task 4.1.9 you will generate errors and Task 3.3.5 will fail. Finally,
if you are developing your dependencies for your ISAP, you should note
all of the dependencies that link to or rely on external tasks, activities, or
events. Be sure to mark these dependencies in the relevant tasks, and
create milestones in your security project plan schedule to indicate the
need to link to external data, tasks, or events.
Constraints
Constraints impact projects by limiting the approach or methods the team
can use to complete the project. Constraints can be internal or external
to your department, division, or company. What are the kinds of con-
straints you’re likely to ﬁnd in an IT security project plan? Some are the
same as any other project, and some are unique to security. While your
list of constraints might be longer, shorter, or contain different items, the
following are ﬁve elements that are likely found on many lists:
www.syngress.com
Planning the IT Security Project • Chapter 6
131

1. Expertise
2. Tools
3. Budget
4. Organizational change
5. Governmental or regulatory requirements
Expertise
As mentioned earlier, the lack of speciﬁc security expertise is a constraint
that should be carefully considered. If you lack the depth and breadth of
expertise on a particular aspect of security that is vital to your security
project plan, you will need to ﬁgure out the best way to address that gap.
These constraints can cause difﬁculty in your project planning and execu-
tion, because, unlike standard IT projects, security project plans can be
less forgiving (i.e., someone is often waiting for you to make a mistake so
they can exploit it).
If you ﬁnd your security project plan needs speciﬁc expertise, and if
you believe this expertise is in short supply, difﬁcult to locate, or very
expensive, this is a signiﬁcant constraint on your project that should be
noted and addressed with your security project plan sponsor.
Tools
Sometimes tools can be a constraint, especially if one of your subject
matter experts recommends (or requires) a particular tool and your
budget can’t accommodate it. If there’s a piece of equipment that you
share with another department, or a piece of equipment you need to rent
or lease, list this as a constraint as well, since it could impact the ability of
your project team to move on to speciﬁc tasks that require the use of this
tool or equipment.
Budget
Is a budget ever large enough? Probably not, but in the world of IT secu-
rity, a skimpy budget may translate into network vulnerability or, even
www.syngress.com
132
Chapter 6 • Planning the IT Security Project

more importantly, legal liability. Don’t let your corporate executives tell
you to be “penny wise and pound foolish.”You might be able to shave a
few thousand dollars off the budget, but you need to assess the risks of
doing so. If your budget has a bit of fat that can be trimmed, great. If not,
then you’re starting to cut into the muscle of your project and need to
clearly delineate the risks to your boss, security project plan sponsor, or
corporate executives.
Sometimes the issue isn’t the total amount of money, but the timing
of the funds (e.g., smaller companies often track [and manage] their cash
ﬂows very tightly). It’s possible that your budget for this project was
approved, but you’re later told that you can’t spend that $10,000 on x, y,
or z until June, because the company doesn’t have the cash. Clearly, this is
a constraint that impacts your team’s ability to get the security project
plan completed on time; therefore, it should be listed as a constraint. If
you’re really on top of your game, you will prepare a cash ﬂow model for
your project so that you can deﬁne when you’ll need which amounts of
capital. If this is beyond your skill set, see if you can offer one of the
Finance people a free lunch or a pair of movie tickets to help you project
your cash expenditures during the lifecycle of the security project plan.
Your executives will be impressed and your Finance folks will probably
be relieved to have an idea of when these expenditures might come in.
Organizational Change
Sometimes changes to the organization can create project constraints that we
don’t immediately recognize. If your company is in the process of evalu-
ating another company for acquisition, this might be a constraint on your
security project.You might not be able to conclude your project in a
timely manner if your project resources are reallocated to another project,
or are unavailable due to this acquisition. While this scenario may not be
relevant to your organization, take a look around your company and see
if there are any upcoming changes that could constrain on your project.

Planning the IT Security Project • Chapter 6
133

Governmental or Regulatory Requirements
Governmental or regulatory requirements have an impact on an IT secu-
rity project plan.Are these constraints? It depends on the nature of the
requirements. In some cases, these might simply be included in the func-
tional and technical requirements. In other cases, these regulations might
be constraints on the project as a whole.Any governmental or regulatory
requirement that limits the way your team approaches the project should
be considered a constraint and should be listed.
Along with constraints, you may also want to make a note of how
that constraint impacts your security project plan, the approach to your
plan, or methods the plan can use.Typically, constraints are risks or chal-
lenges you must live with, but any planning you can do to mitigate these
constraints is usually worth the effort.
Business Intelligence…
Compliance Confusion
The ever-changing landscape of compliance clearly impacts IT security
project plans, especially in the planning stages. While you should cer-
tainly utilize standard IT project methodologies, you also have to imple-
ment whatever additional tools and techniques are needed to become
or remain compliant. We’ve stressed the importance of involving execu-
tives and users throughout the process, because at the end of the day,
you’re only as secure or compliant as your users allow you to be. All the
access controls in the world won’t help when an authorized user prints
out a patient’s medical ﬁle for review and accidentally leaves it at a
coffee shop after a hectic morning. We’ll talk about security policies and
procedures later in this book, but you may want to add some additional
planning steps to your IT security project plan to ensure that your orga-
nization can become and remain compliant with whatever regulations
apply to your ﬁrm. The document called “8 Steps to Compliance
Readiness” on Gantthead.com is helpful, and can be found at
www.gantthead.com/article.cfm?ID=228710.

Chapter 6 • Planning the IT Security Project

Lessons Learned
You may want to deﬁne and capture lessons learned as tasks are being
completed. It’s very common for these key ﬁndings to get lost as people
move onto new tasks or new projects.Trying to sit down at the end of a
project and gather lessons learned is like sifting through sand; most of it
falls through the cracks.Although a particular task may not lead to a
major “a ha” moment, it could certainly lead to a new or reﬁned best
practice, or just a slight modiﬁcation to a test procedure that lends itself
to improved productivity, better security, or less user frustration. Whatever
is learned, the task work should be captured as part of the task detail.As
part of your project processes and procedures, you can convene a “lessons
learned” meeting each month or each quarter and have everyone compile
the lessons learned from their tasks. Discussing these frequently and regu-
larly can save other IT security project plan team members time and
effort on later tasks, it can streamline and improve your project, and it can
help everyone avoid common pitfalls or share better methods. If you wait
to gather these at the end of your project, you not only risk having these
innovations be forgotten, but you miss the opportunity for team members
to beneﬁt from this knowledge earlier in the project lifecycle.
Identifying and 
Working With the Critical Path
Sometimes people use an incorrect deﬁnition for critical path; therefore,
let’s start by deﬁning it so that we all start from the same baseline. By def-
inition, the critical path is the longest, least ﬂexible path through your
project. If any task that is on the critical path slips (e.g., is late), the pro-
ject will not be ﬁnished on time. Most project management software pro-
grams will graphically show you the critical path after you’ve loaded in
your task dependencies and duration.
The critical take-away here is that you should be clear about which
tasks are on your critical path and which are not, especially within your
ISAPs. It will help you make better decisions about how to allocate
www.syngress.com
Planning the IT Security Project • Chapter 6
135

resources to your project. If one ISAP is delayed, it might ripple through
your corporate IT security project plan and delay the start or completion
of other ISAPs. Ultimately, this impacts your overall network security
because the longer it takes you to complete various elements of your 
corporate IT security plan, the longer the bad guys have to work on
weak targets.
Testing IT Security Project Results
How you approach testing your security project plan results and security is
up to you.You may choose to develop a wholly independent testing plan.
You may also choose to develop testing criteria within tasks or phases of
your project. Because you’re dealing with network security, it’s important
to decide how you will test project results before you launch into your
project. If you choose to develop an independent testing plan, you should
tie in key tests or test points to your task details (e.g., if a task is deﬁned
as “Harden Server 123,” completion criteria should be localized tests on
Server 123 to ensure the hardening tasks were successful). However, since
Server 123 doesn’t live in isolation, a more expansive test will also need
to be performed to ensure that the cross-boundary issues are addressed
(e.g., what protocols, applications, or users are connecting to Server 123,
and are all of those areas secure as well.). If a user is accessing conﬁdential
data located on Server 123, and Server 123 is secure, that’s great. But
what about the fact that the user is in the Dallas airport using an unse-
cured wireless connection? Now how secure it that data? Even if the user
is connecting to a secure Web site requiring a user login, that data is still
traveling from the laptop through the unsecured wireless connection to a
hardwired Internet connection before traveling on to the secure site.
Since security is deﬁned by the weakest link, this particular scenario
describes a secure server and unsecured conﬁdential data. Do your testing
procedures for Server 123 account for this? Probably not, because it’s out-
side the scope of the task,“Harden Server 123.”Therefore, your project
planning should include testing procedures that test down (ISAPs) and
across (corporate) the enterprise. (Figure 7.1 represents the cross-
www.syngress.com
136
Chapter 6 • Planning the IT Security Project

boundary issues.) However, be sure your security project plan includes
testing procedures.
As a reminder, it’s often helpful to look at testing in terms of people,
process, and technology.The people aspect has to do with testing how people
can (and do) interact with network resources. Process has to do with
testing various security processes, whether through settings, automation,
or interactive testing. Technology has to do with verifying conﬁguration,
hardware, and software settings. If you look at these three areas in your
testing plan, you’re more likely to develop a comprehensive test plan.
While you’ve probably looked at your enterprise and decided what’s
included, now’s a good time to review your project and what it encom-
passes. Is there something you’ve thought of that you want to test that is
not included in the project plan or the WBS? If so, this is a good indica-
tion that there is an omission that should be addressed. (For your review,
we’ve included a list in Chapter 9 of potential areas that might need to be
included in your security project plan or might need to be part of your
test plan [see Table 9.1].). While this list is long, it is not exhaustive, and
you should take a close look at your organization to see what else might
need to be included.
Testing plans vary signiﬁcantly from one type of project to another,
but a common set of steps for testing include the:
1. Testing stage
2. Schedule of the test
3. Location of the test
4. Participants in the test
5. Environment; general IT and equipment
6. Data to be used for testing
7. Backup and restore procedures
8. Testing procedure
9. Issue, problem, and error reporting procedure
10. Issue resolution procedure
www.syngress.com
Planning the IT Security Project • Chapter 6
137

11. Retesting procedure
12. Signoff procedure
We’ve also included a list of test types that will provide a reminder as
to how you want to develop your testing plans.These will be very spe-
ciﬁc to both your organization, the risks, the threats, and the types of
technology you have (ISAPs), but here’s a refresher to get you started:
1. Unit testing
2. Integration testing
3. Usability testing
4. Acceptance testing
5. Beta testing
6. Regression testing
7. Performance testing (stress and load testing, stability testing, and
reliability testing)
8. Benchmark testing
Budget, Schedule, 
Risks, and Communications
Once you have the details generated via your WBS, you can create a
more detailed budget and schedule.You can also step back and look at
various project risks and develop mitigation strategies. Finally, you can
develop your communication plans because you’ll now have sufﬁcient
information to allow you to determine who needs to be in the loop with
regard to your project.
Budget
If you’re working on your corporate IT security plan, it will have to
encompass the underlying budgets for all the ISAPs. If you don’t have
those project plans developed, be sure your budget contains placeholders
www.syngress.com
138
Chapter 6 • Planning the IT Security Project

for those amounts.Also be sure to communicate this information to the
appropriate parties. Clearly, you want to avoid a situation where the
budget that is approved contains only a portion of your overall IT secu-
rity project plan costs.You can create your high level corporate IT secu-
rity project plan with ISAP budget placeholders, or you can delineate the
cost of each ISAP and add to it the corporate IT security project plan
piece. It’s just two different approaches that will lead you to the same
result. Either way, remember that your corporate IT security project
budget is a sum of the underlying ISAP budgets and the costs of the dis-
crete components of the corporate IT security project itself. When it
comes to budget approval, you want to have all the projects included and
not have to go back for a second round of budget approvals after your
projects are underway.
Schedule
For the most part, the comments just made about the budget preparation
hold true for the schedule, with a few minor exceptions. First, some por-
tions of the project work can be run in parallel; therefore, the overall cor-
porate IT security project plan schedule is not exactly the sum of all
underlying schedules. However, as you look across your ISAPs and the
corporate IT security project plan, you may discover scheduling conﬂicts
that didn’t come into play until you looked at all of the projects in a
holistic manner.The scheduling component becomes more complex
when you’re juggling resources across multiple projects, so if you are tack-
ling more than one ISAP project at a time (i.e., running in overlapping or
parallel modes), you’ll need to map out your resource requirements across
all projects.This moves your corporate IT security project into the realm
of program management. (A program is a collection of related projects.) If
you need to schedule a number of projects, you will want to rely on a
good project management software program to help you with resource
load balancing.
www.syngress.com
Planning the IT Security Project • Chapter 6
139

Risks
Each project carries its own set of risks.As you know from your project
management experience, the risks are both internal and external to the
project.As with your budget and schedule, you have individual ISAP risks
as well as risks to the overall corporate IT security project plan. It’s pos-
sible that as you evaluate your projects, you’ll see risks that span several
ISAPs that were not present when looking at your projects one by one.
One example of that kind of risk is that the resources you need won’t be
available at the right time. If several of your team members are working
on one ISAP security project plan that gets delayed, it might have an
impact on one or more of the other ISAPs. Looking holistically at your
risks across the entire range of projects (ISAPs and corporate IT security
project plan) will allow you to see the big picture and plan your risk mit-
igation strategies accordingly.
Communications
Communicating in the IT security project plan is really no different from
other projects. It’s included here because some IT project managers aren’t
great communicators, and this is a huge missed opportunity.An inter-
esting statistic about security project plan success is that the perception of
success is just as important as the actual results when people are asked to
assess the project’s success. So, you can knock yourself out to deliver the
absolute best results only to ﬁnd that, because you didn’t do a good job
communicating during the project, it’s deemed “acceptable” at best.
Create communication plans and implement them. Remember the
four C’s: Communicate clearly, concisely, and consistently. Most people
just want information, but many people in IT seem to think that if they
don’t know the answer, they should wait until they do know the answer
before saying anything. Just the opposite is true. If you don’t know, say
you don’t know, and then communicate what you’re doing to ﬁnd out
when you’ll next communicate. When you fail to communicate, your
project falls into the corporate black hole and you lose the opportunity
to maintain a positive attitude about the project and its results.

Business Intelligence…
Users Are the Key to Compliance and Security
IT security has become a major issue in the compliance arena, though
that pointed focus is a bit misplaced. In some ways, IT security is the
“low hanging fruit”—easy to point to and grab as the solution to this
challenging problem. Computer and information technology is still an
evolving ﬁeld. Fifty years ago, no one had to worry about managing
electronic information, so the answers we’re seeking today have to be
developed based on the ever-changing technological landscape. IT tech-
nologies must contribute to security, but in the end, people within the
organization must be engaged in helping create and maintain security.
There are different ways to do this, but continued visibility is an impor-
tant aspect. Whether you have your Human Resources department or
your Training department involved, be sure to consider creating a reg-
ular communication channel to educate and engage users in the security
process. The Computer Security Institute has developed two regular
newsletters, one focused on users and the other focused on top-level
executives, that you can sign up to receive. They can be customized to
your organization (i.e., you can add your logo, street address, and a
small section for company-speciﬁc information) for regular distribution
to your users and executives. This fee-based newsletter is just one solu-
tion, but it’s a good idea to implement a system for keeping IT security
and security practices in the forefront of your users’ minds. You can take
a look at sample newsletters at www.gocsi.com/awareness/publica-
tions.jhtml. Keeping users up-to-date about changing IT threats and
security best practices is a great way to help bolster your IT security pro-
ject plan results.

Summary
Planning an IT security project plan isn’t dramatically different from plan-
ning any other kind of IT project, it just has a few nuances that are good
to know about going in.We reviewed the basics of planning your IT secu-
rity project plan and discussed those differences.The WBS is where the
proverbial rubber hits the road, where the project details begin to take
shape.Within your tasks, you can include the data that provides guidance
on the successful completion of the tasks as it relates to your security
requirements. Functional and technical requirements should be translated
into completion criteria. Ultimately, these ensure that your security project
plan provides the requisite level of security and complies, where necessary,
with laws and regulations such as Sarbanes-Oxley and others.
After completing your WBS, you should perform your ﬁrst scope
check. It’s here that you discover whether your scope and the tasks
deﬁned in your WBS are aligned. In most cases, there is some sort of mis-
match and, therefore, you have an opportunity to work through these dis-
connects fairly early in the planning stages.
We discussed the importance of developing task details and how these
details can be used to enhance security and ensure your project delivers
the quality results you require. It’s important to have subject matter
experts participate in developing the WBS and the task details, since they
are closest to the technical details and are the ones best suited to devel-
oping meaningful task details and metrics.
Project constraints in an IT security project plan are slightly different
because legal, regulatory, or industry requirements are constraints not
always found in other kinds of IT projects. Be sure to include all legal,
regulatory or industry requirements not only in your task details, but also
in your constraints.These are likely to shape the way your project pro-
ceeds, and should be addressed at the outset of the project planning phase.
Testing is an important element in IT security and it’s vital that your
project plan include test procedures. In some cases, this can be accom-
plished via task details and completion criteria. In many cases, however, it
also requires you to test down through the ISAP and across the enterprise
www.syngress.com
142
Chapter 6 • Planning the IT Security Project

to ensure there are no gaps in security. Some organizations and projects
require a separate IT security test project plan, others simply require that
discrete testing tasks be built into the project WBS.
We looked at the areas where the ISAPs and the corporate IT security
project plan come together. In later chapters of this book, we’ll look at
some individual security area project plans and step through them.
However, it’s important to understand that there may be two discrete
types of plans you’re working with; the corporate IT security project
plan, which addresses the entirety of corporate IT security, and the indi-
vidual security areas like wireless security or operational security.These
areas are sometimes implemented as individual projects, but must also be
viewed as part of the larger whole. We looked at aspects related to both
the corporate IT security project plan and the individual security project
plans as it pertains to the critical path, budget, schedule, and risks. We ﬁn-
ished the chapter with the four C’s discussion, reiterating the importance
of communicating clearly, concisely, and consistently.

Creating the IT Security Project Work Breakdown
Structure
 The WBS is developed from the three to ﬁve major objectives
identiﬁed in the deﬁnition phase of the project.
 Use a numbering system to help manage tasks.You can later refer to
them by number rather than name to lend clarity to your
communications.
 Your WBS may include the tasks from your sub-projects, or it may
include just the corporate IT security project plan tasks.
www.syngress.com
Planning the IT Security Project • Chapter 6
143

Deﬁning Project Tasks and Sub-tasks
 Tasks should follow the 8/80 rule. If they are shorter than 8 hours,
roll them up into another task (if possible). If they are longer than
80 hours, split them into smaller tasks.
 Tasks and sub-tasks are often identiﬁed in a linear manner, but
should not be placed in a formal order.The ﬁnal order for tasks will
be based on the logical ﬂow of the tasks as well as the dependencies
and constraints.
Checking Project Scope 
 Once you’ve identiﬁed all of the project’s tasks, you can check the
scope of the project.
 It’s common to ﬁnd that the WBS deﬁnes work that is larger than
the deﬁned (or desired) scope of the project. Either you’ll need to
reduce your WBS task list, or you’ll need to adjust your scope
statements.
 This is typically the genesis of scope creep, so this is your ﬁrst and
best place to address potential scope creep.
 Often the process of creating the WBS causes you to discover
additional information germane to the project planning process.
This often causes you to have to reevaluate your scope.
 If your scope has legitimately changed based on the information
you’ve discovered, discuss the proposed changes with your project
sponsor.
Developing Task Details
 The task details can include all kinds of data. For an IT security
project, it should include functional and technical requirements, as
well as any legal, regulatory, or industry requirements.

Chapter 6 • Planning the IT Security Project

 Your completion criteria should include legal, regulatory, or
industry requirements. When each task is completed according to
speciﬁcations, there is a much higher likelihood that the project
results will also be compliant.
 Gather lessons learned as part of the task detail.This may help team
members avoid common pitfalls or leverage new streamlined
methods.
 Regularly reviewing lessons learned helps share knowledge earlier in
the project lifecycle. Waiting until the end of the project to gather
lessons learned, misses an opportunity to improve the project and
risks missing the opportunity to capture organizational knowledge.
Identifying and Working With the Critical Path
 By deﬁnition, the critical path is the longest, least ﬂexible path
through the project.
 When dealing with tasks from both the ISAPs and the corporate IT

Testing IT Security Project Results
 Testing plans should be developed in the planning phase of the
project.
 Tests should include testing the security or the result of individual
security tasks.
 Tests should include testing the security in an individual security
area plan (ISAP) as well as across the enterprise.
 Test plans may be implemented as separate projects or as part of the
project’s existing WBS.
 Test plans can include unit testing; integration testing; usability
testing; acceptance testing; beta testing; regression testing;

Budget, Schedule, Risks, and Communications
 The budget for ISAPs and the corporate IT security project plan
must be addressed individually and as a whole. Gaps or omissions in
your budget can be difﬁcult to resolve later.
 The schedule for ISAPs and the corporate IT security project plan
can be challenging to manage since you have several potentially

combined risks of the projects. Some risks span ISAPs and should
be addressed and managed as such.

Introduction
After you’ve thoroughly planned your project and circled back once or
twice through various areas to develop additional clarity, it’s time to begin
the project. Whether you’re working on the corporate IT security project
or one of the individual security area projects, you need to get everyone
moving in the same direction and you need to monitor the results as you
go. In this chapter, we review these project management steps with a
focus on IT security. Security is developed through the planning stages to
make sure all bases are covered, but is implemented through the project
tasks. It’s later maintained through policies and operational procedures. In
this chapter, we cover the implementation. In a later chapter, we look at
the policies and operational procedures needed to maintain security in
your network environment.
Initiating the IT Security Project
The best place to start your Information Technology (IT) security project
is to make sure that all of your prior deﬁnition and planning tasks have
been completed.At this point, you should have the following:
■
Problem statement
■
Mission statement
■
Selected solution
■
Project constraints and priorities
■
Project requirements (functional, technical, legal)
■
Work breakdown structure (WBS) with all tasks and task details
deﬁned
■
Project risks and mitigation strategies
■
Project budget and schedule
■
Required competencies identiﬁed
■
Project team formed
■
Project processes deﬁned

Chapter 7 • Managing the IT Security Project

After making sure that all of the necessary elements are in place,
check in with your project sponsor. Make sure that all systems are still
“go” and that nothing has changed that will cause you to have to rework
parts of your plan.This is also a good opportunity for one ﬁnal “scope
check” to ensure that the scope of work hasn’t increased before the pro-
ject work has begun.
When you’re ready to begin the project work, start with a formal
announcement and a team meeting.The formal announcement serves
two purposes: it notiﬁes the organization that the project resources are
now required for the IT security project, and it gives your project some
visibility. Sometimes IT projects are planned and implemented in the
back of the server room, and no one outside of the IT department knows
what’s going on. In many cases that’s ﬁne; however, in the case of IT
security projects, more visibility is needed. It’s important that users, man-
agers, division heads, and executives all understand that these initiatives
are underway and that they are important.This is your opportunity for a
bit of a “marketing blitz”: let the company know how important this pro-
ject is to the future of the organization and how individuals can con-
tribute to its success.
Also take this opportunity to reiterate the importance of quality in
your project. Participants must be committed to doing a good job
because without quality in this project, your network security will be at
risk.Attention to detail, following deﬁned processes and procedures, and
addressing issues and changes according to plan parameters is vitally
important to a successful project outcome.Your kick-off meeting is the
ﬁrst and best chance to set the stage for this mindset, and can have a huge
impact on the ﬁnal result.
Monitoring and Managing 
IT Security Project Progress
The biggest challenge in an IT security project is managing the compli-
ance issues. Often, there are so many conﬂicting requirements that even
the most savvy IT security expert has difﬁculty discerning what’s required
www.syngress.com
Managing the IT Security Project • Chapter 7
149

or, in some cases, how to reconcile conﬂicting requirements. Even when
these compliance requirements are straightforward, you have to be conﬁ-
dent that the activities undertaken during the project work phase are
generating compliant results.
As mentioned in Chapter 6, you need to establish processes and pro-
cedures that ensure that your results are compliant with whatever regula-
tions apply to your ﬁrm.There are often stringent documentation
requirements, and in some cases, you’ll need to document your 
documentation.
Business Intelligence…
Focus, Simplicity, and Enforceability
Compliance was on the minds of many IT professionals who attended
the April 2006 InfoSec World conference. Focus, simplicity, and enforce-
ability are the keys to crafting corporate information security policies,
according to conference attendees. “Pick your battles,” Anish Bhimani,
chief information security ofﬁcer at JPMorgan Chase & Co. advised. He
added that instead of having a laundry list of compliance items, compa-
nies should be “crystal clear” on what their security objectives are and
spell them out in a policy that workers can easily understand and that is
high level enough to remain relevant over an extended period of time.
One thing to keep in mind is how many controls you’re asking people to
comply with. Focusing on the elements that matter the most and that
will drive compliance is important. Keeping the requirements simple will
help ensure compliance across the organization. Finally, focus on what
can be enforced.
Using a consistent IT security project management methodology
will help you in your quest for compliance, but you must also look at
how your project plan interacts with your organization. As you imple-
ment your IT security project plan, keep an eye on the focus, simplicity,
and enforceability of your processes and procedures. We’ll look at poli-
cies that support compliance later in this book. For now, keep an eye on
compliance requirements as you implement your IT security project plan,

because you may need to modify policies and procedures as you
progress through the project to address user concerns or issues.

Task Progress
Your IT security project should be broken down into tasks with very
clear, speciﬁc deliverables, which should be identiﬁed through the use of
well-crafted completion criteria. If you are dealing with compliance
issues, you should also make sure that the appropriate documentation is
included in the mix. Different compliance requirements will have diverse
reporting and documentation requirements, so be sure these are in place
prior to initiating security project work.This is a good checkpoint to
make sure you’re comfortable with the documentation deﬁned in each
phase or task of your project. It’s much easier to document the work you
perform and what is required to maintain the requisite level of security,
than it is to go back and try to ascertain what was done when and by
whom.
Below is an example of completion criteria, which help ensure tasks
are completed correctly. While the example uses a fairly simple task that
would not normally need to be tracked across time, it shows you a con-
crete model of how completion criteria can be included in a task to help
monitor results. In this example, the task is to set the network password
policy to require the use of strong passwords. Previous tasks, upon which
this task is dependent, have included activities to notify users that this will
be required starting on a particular date, and to train users as to what
constitutes a strong password.The language in this example is fairly
generic; your completion criteria should include the speciﬁc steps (e.g.,
clicks, menu options, responses, and so forth) you would take (e.g., in a
Windows Server 2003 environment or a Linux environment).

Completion Criteria Example - Strong Passwords
This task is complete when the following steps have been completed in
order:
[Initial each step when complete.]
1. _____Log in on the administrator account to Server 123.
2. _____ Access password policies.
3. _____ Conﬁgure passwords to require at least 7 characters.
4. _____ Conﬁgure passwords to require at least one lower case
letter, one upper case letter, one number and one special char-
acter.
5. _____ Conﬁgure passwords to disallow the use of any part of the
username.
6. _____ Conﬁgure passwords to be different from the previous
three passwords used.
7. _____ Conﬁgure passwords to require they be changed no less
than every four weeks.
8. _____ Modify the Failed Login Notiﬁcation box to include only
this text (remove any pre-existing text and substitute it with this
text):“You must change your password to conform to new pass-
word requirements. If you have trouble logging on, please contact
Jaime at extension 1234 for assistance.”
9. _____ Log off the administrator account.
10. _____ Log in on your own user account.
11. _____ Test password requirements by trying to set your password
using these passwords. Note result as “Pass” or “Fail.” Pass indi-
cates you were able to login using that password; Fail indicates
you were unable to successfully login using that password:

Additional Notes:
The success of a security project plan is built on the successful com-
pletion of tasks, and progress can be measured against the completion 
criteria
In addition to managing the compliance and documentation issues,
you’ll be managing standard project management issues related to tasks.
Are the needed resources ready to begin their tasks? Are tasks starting and
ending on time? Are tasks being completed successfully? If tasks are slip-
ping, how does it affect dependent tasks? How are tasks on your critical
path going? Is funding available when needed, and are tasks being
impacted as a result? These are the kinds of normal project management
www.syngress.com
Managing the IT Security Project • Chapter 7
153

issues you face on a regular basis and which you’re skilled at, especially
using project management software to help track any progress against
your security project plan.There are two additional factors to keep in
mind within the scope of an IT security project plan.The ﬁrst is whether
there are any external factors that must be addressed with respect to hard
deadlines for compliance or changes to laws or regulations that occur
during the work cycle of the project.The second is whether any issues
arise that could jeopardize your overall security. Sometimes security and
compliance requirements don’t align, so you need to be sure that nothing
will jeopardize your network security.
Project Progress
As stated earlier, a project with multiple milestones is usually more suc-
cessful than a project with few milestones. Milestones are checkpoints in
a security project plan: the more often you step back and take a look at
where you are, the more successful your project will be. Milestones in
your IT security project plan should include, among others, checkpoints
on required activities and documentation related to compliance issues.As
you move through your project work, keeping an eye on these two key
elements will be crucial. It’s very difﬁcult to go back and create docu-
mentation, and it takes much less time and effort to create it concurrent
with the security activity. Be sure you have milestones in your project
plan for these key tasks.Also be sure to include milestones related to any
external events or activities including hard deadlines for compliance,
timelines for external audits (if any), and checkpoints to determine if
there have been any relevant changes to the laws or regulations to which
your IT security project might be subject.
In addition to regulatory issues, you want to ensure that your project
is progressing as planned. In today’s IT environment, it’s easy to ﬁnd mul-
tiple, conﬂicting demands pulling on your IT staff or security project plan
team. It’s easy to get off track under these conditions; therefore, it’s critical
that you, as the project manager, actively manage this situation.You’ll have
to use your best management skills to keep people focused and motivated
on the tasks at hand while recognizing the conﬂicting demands staff face.

Chapter 7 • Managing the IT Security Project

We’re not going to get into a discussion of various methods of evalu-
ating project progress other than to say that there are numerous methods
you can use, including percent complete and earned value analysis (EVA),
to name two common ones. Percent complete is really a ballpark estimate
unless you use real metrics (e.g., if your entire project is scheduled for 60
days and you’ve hit the 30-day mark, are you actually 50 percent com-
plete?) It depends on whether or not the tasks scheduled to be started, in
progress, and complete by the 30th day are all on track. Percent complete
can be deceiving (intentionally or unintentionally). EVA can also be an
excellent tool but again, is subject to various kinds of intentional or unin-
tentional manipulation and is not always accurate. Many people are
intimidated or confused by EVA and choose not to use this method.
Other people feel that for some projects, EVA takes more time to calcu-
late than the actual work it is calculating. Whatever method(s) you use, be
sure you apply it consistently as you move through your security project
plan, so that you can keep yourself, your project team, your project
sponsor, and the organization apprised of your progress.
While you’re managing the project, be sure to keep your project
sponsor in the loop using the agreed-upon timelines and deliverables for
project status reporting.The project sponsor rarely needs to know all the
gritty project details, but he or she should know the current status and
issues well enough to help support (and possibly defend) the project to
upper management should the need arise. Key check-in points should
also be identiﬁed via project milestones.
Issues Reporting and Resolution
Issue management is very important in IT security projects. Issues may
arise that impact your overall network security, and managing these effec-
tively will be fundamental to delivering a successful project result.As
issues arise, they need to be evaluated as to criticality—is the issue an
emergency or is it simply something to be addressed before project com-
pletion? The criticality of an issue is an assessment of what impact it will
have on the task, the schedule, the budget, or the overall project.As you’re
www.syngress.com
Managing the IT Security Project • Chapter 7
155

evaluating criticality, keep an eye on your risks and mitigation strategies,
which should include speciﬁc triggers that indicate when a risk is occur-
ring. Keeping these front and center will help as issues arise, because you
can quickly determine if an issue is part of a deﬁned risk or not. If it is
part of a deﬁned risk, the issue has been thought through and can be
addressed in a systematic manner. If it is not part of a deﬁned risk, the
issue has to be looked at in more detail. Resolving project issues can be
complex in some cases and the resolutions may have unintended effects,
especially on the overall security of the network. Be sure your issue reso-
lution process includes steps to evaluate the risk of implementing the
solution as well as any potential unintended consequences you can think
of (unfortunately, some may not be evident until later). Carefully thinking
through issue resolution in a security project is very important, because
each change brings with it the potential for creating an unintended secu-
rity hole that may be exploited.
Documentation
Your standard issue reporting and resolution processes and procedures will
work well for a security project plan with one notable exception: docu-
mentation.As we’ve continually stressed, documentation in a security
project plan is important, because it provides you with an audit trail so
that you can go back and see what’s been done. It is also important,
because it forms the basis of ongoing security operations procedures.
Finally, documentation is critical because it is typically required (often in
triplicate) for compliance audits. It can’t be stressed enough that your
documentation should be well-deﬁned and completed in as near real-
time as possible. It’s also very important to understand that any and all
documentation you generate, including the issue reports, could become
legal documents should a security breach occur that results in litigation.
In most cases, the best approach is to have a consistent approach to docu-
ment project results and a track record for taking action on issues that
arise. If you have well-documented problems but fail to adequately
address or resolve them, you’re leaving yourself wide open for security
www.syngress.com
156
Chapter 7 • Managing the IT Security Project

problems and potential litigation. Documentation combined with appro-
priate action is your best bet when it comes to managing an IT security
project.
Monitoring IT Security Project Risk
In the planning phase of your project, you identiﬁed potential risks
(internal or external) to your IT security project.Your planning process
should include risk assessment, mitigation strategies, evaluation of the risk
of mitigation plans, and triggers.As you move through your security pro-
ject plan, it’s important to continually check your list of known risks. If
you have identiﬁed triggers, you should quickly spot the risks and take
immediate action to address them. In some IT projects, failure to spot
these risks early may be a “non-event,” but in a security project they usu-
ally have more serious implications.
In addition, as your security project plan progresses, you may identify
new risks that could not be anticipated until the project was underway.
These risks might be related to project work or they might be new risks
from the outside world.You can’t know everything in advance of per-
forming project work; sometimes new risks crop up.Actively managing
these new risks using the same evaluation and planning methodology you
used in the planning stages will generate the best results. Sometimes new
external threats show up that throw a wrench in the works (e.g., during
your project work, you might discover that a new network intrusion
method has cropped up.) This might be a risk to security that was never
considered because it wasn’t known at the time. Should it be included in
your project plan? It’s hard to say until you and your team take the time
to evaluate the risk of such an intrusion, evaluate the steps required to
address the new threat, and determine whether or not it can safely be
incorporated into your project plan. When you’re dealing with security,
it’s rarely a good idea to respond without doing your homework.
Sometimes such action exposes you to a whole new set of risks.
Be aware of potential new threats or regulations.Address these risks by
assessing the likelihood of occurrence, the criticality of such an occurrence,
www.syngress.com
Managing the IT Security Project • Chapter 7
157

and the cost or impact of such an occurrence, and then create your mitiga-
tion strategy accordingly.
Managing IT Security Project Change
Change is an absolute certainty in projects, which is why all projects have
(or should have) project managers. Someone has to ensure that the pro-
ject continues to make steady progress and that any new information is
incorporated in a logical, consistent manner. What kinds of changes can
occur in your project? If you’re an experienced project manager, you’ve
probably seen it all. Key stakeholders making new requests (demands) of
the project, key staff not being available, new corporate plans that were
under wraps are suddenly unveiled—these are the kinds of changes that
happen to all projects, including IT security projects. Let’s look at a few
of the high-level categories and discuss these kinds of changes within the
realm of IT security.
Key Stakeholder Change
It’s very common for stakeholders to submit change requests for a project
(e.g., a departmental manager asks for a change to the logon procedure
for his staff or a vice president requests that a particular portion of the
network be secured in a different manner than was speciﬁed).A director
demands that some procedure be changed or an executive demands that
particular security tasks be delayed until after a certain time or event.All
of these kinds of changes have to be managed by the IT project team.
Your standard change management procedures should be employed
consistently throughout the project lifecycle.These procedures should
include evaluating the requested change, assigning it a level of criticality,
and assessing what actions might be taken to address the change. Once it’s
decided that a change is desirable or acceptable, it must go through the
risk evaluation process. By deﬁnition, change is a project risk because
you’re deviating from the project plan.Therefore, you should view all
major change as a risk and evaluate it using the same methodologies you
use to evaluate other kinds of risk. Be especially aware of unintended
www.syngress.com
158
Chapter 7 • Managing the IT Security Project

consequences of change.Think through these situations very carefully to
determine if these changes will support, enhance, or erode security. If
they will not support or enhance security, they should probably not be
implemented. However, we all know that in the real world, things are
rarely perfect and you may be forced by circumstances to implement a
change that does not support or enhance security.You’ll have to evaluate
the pro’s and con’s before making a ﬁnal decision.This might be a good
time to check in with your security project plan sponsor if you have con-
ﬂicting demands that cannot be easily resolved.
Also, use your functional and technical requirements documents to
address major stakeholder change requests. Sometimes stakeholders simply
fail to understand the implications of their change requests and once they
are discussed in light of the original speciﬁcations and the risks of the
requested change, they may rescind those requests. If not, your job is to
negotiate a reasonable solution to the problem. Look over the original
speciﬁcations and determine whether the stakeholder’s change request:
1. Falls under the original speciﬁcations (i.e. you and your team may
have missed something).
2. Falls outside of the original speciﬁcations, but is a desirable modi-
ﬁcation that will support or enhance security.
3. Falls outside of the original speciﬁcations, is a reasonable modiﬁ-
cation, but does not support or enhance security.
4. Falls outside the original speciﬁcations, is not a reasonable modiﬁca-
tion, and may or may not support security.
Clearly, having had key stakeholder input from the start of the project
should reduce these kinds of change requests, but change always pops up
in one form or another.As you evaluate these potential changes using
these four criteria, you can take a logical approach toward incorporating
the requested change or explaining the reasons for rejecting the requested
change. Be sure to effectively communicate with key stakeholders and
take time to explain the rationale for the decision. While the stakeholder
might not be pleased with the ﬁnal outcome, he or she should at least
www.syngress.com
Managing the IT Security Project • Chapter 7
159

understand why the decision was made. If you can defend your position,
be sure you’re being reasonable. Sometimes in the midst of project work,
we want to reject change just because it’s inconvenient, not because it’s
undesirable. Make sure you don’t fall into that trap.
Key Staff Change
We’ve all experienced staff changes in project work. We’ve spent time
identifying core competencies and skills needed for a successful project,
we’ve identiﬁed the key people we needed, and were assured they’d be
available for the project. However, when the time comes, that person is
unavailable. Sometimes this happens because the project timeline has
slipped and that person’s window of availability has closed. Other times,
the project is on target but the person has been pulled to a higher pri-
ority task or is simply no longer available (promotion, left the company,
out on family leave, and so forth).The key is how you handle it as the
project manager.
If these key staff are critical to project success, their lack of availability
should have been identiﬁed as a project risk and mitigation strategies
should have been identiﬁed at the outset of the project.This might
include identifying your second and third choices for the work, or
sending someone through training to be the backup. It may also mean
that you’ve identiﬁed an outside contractor who could ﬁll that role, if
needed. In rare cases, you may have to put that aspect of project work on
hold until the key person becomes available.This would clearly not be an
optimal solution but one of last resort.
Key Environmental Change
Things change within organizations every day.There are times when
upper management have plans they’re working on that they cannot
divulge to anyone, even though they will impact other organizational
plans and projects. It’s the nature of business. If an executive team is dis-
cussing a hostile takeover of a competitor or an acquisition of another
ﬁrm, they may not be able to disclose this information (legally, ethically
www.syngress.com
160
Chapter 7 • Managing the IT Security Project

or strategically) to you. However, you may later ﬁnd yourself in the midst
of running your IT security project when plans are announced and sud-
denly your environment shifts dramatically.
Another example of an environmental change that could impact your
project is if laws or regulations regarding data security in your industry or
segment change. It is a common occurrence these days that changes are
discussed for months or even years without resolution. It’s impossible to
adequately plan because the discussion regarding these regulations
changes and shifts until it’s ﬁnally just locked in one day. If you responded
to every shift in approach before the regulation was enacted, you’d spend
all of your time reacting to these changes and never end up with any
meaningful plan. Most IT professionals keep an eye on these proposed
changes but proceed with their project planning work anyway. If you
waited for the “ﬁnal” word, you’d almost never be able to actually plan
and implement a project. Once the ﬁnal decision is reached and enacted,
you may have to make sure that your plan incorporates the latest aspects
of the regulation. If you keep on top of potential changes that could be
implemented, you probably won’t be blindsided.That said, it’s entirely
possible that despite your best efforts to keep an eye on the regulatory
environment, you may need to step back and ﬁgure out “Plan B.”
Testing IT Security Project Results
Testing IT security project results is an important element of delivering a
successful security project plan result. How should testing be performed
to ensure the results are as expected? That’s not an easy question to
answer.You probably performed some level of testing as part of your
assessment and audit process before launching into this project, so you
may choose to re-use those testing procedures to test project results.
However, as stated earlier, there is a tendency to test our plans, not test
our results, so it’s easy to fall into a trap whereby we think we’re testing
the security of our network but we’re just testing the work we per-
formed. Both types of testing are useful; the real key is in understanding
the difference. Start by asking what you’re actually testing, why you’re
www.syngress.com
Managing the IT Security Project • Chapter 7
161

testing it, and what you expect to ﬁnd. Include metrics and measurements
to the greatest extent possible.A general assessment of “it worked” is not
as helpful as “the database scripting did not generate an error when it was
tested with situation A, B, and C” (where each A, B and C is described in
detail).
In addition, it’s important to remember that regardless of the type of
IT security project you’re working on, you need to look across all bound-
aries. Figure 7.1 depicts the cross-boundary types of testing you should
consider for your project. Each Individual Security Analysis Programs
(ISAPs) results should be tested to ensure that your wireless network or
server infrastructure (or whatever you deﬁned as an ISAP) is secured as
expected via the security project plan. However, this type of “silo testing”
will only tell you how secure that individual area is. Clearly, there are
interactions across ISAPs as well, and these are the areas your corporate
IT security project plan should address.The horizontal arrows in Figure
7.1 show corporate IT security testing that spans all ISAPs at various
levels. In addition, through your risk assessment and planning processes,
you may have identiﬁed some especially high-risk areas that deserve spe-
cial attention.The areas called out in stars labeled 1, 2, and 3 indicate
areas that additional attention and testing will be applied to in order to be
sure these critical areas are addressed within the ISAPs, across the ISAPs,
and as part of the overall corporate IT security project.
Testing is not an isolated event that generates a yes/no response. It
must be looked at across the enterprise and evaluated based on its hori-
zontal and vertical aspects (horizontal = across the enterprise, vertical =
into the ISAP).

Chapter 7 • Managing the IT Security Project

Figure 7.1 Cross-boundary Testing
As mentioned in Chapter 6, testing should encompass many different
elements. It may also be appropriate to create a separate security project
plan devoted solely to testing. For example, there are network compo-
nents, protocols, setups, user proﬁles, resource access control lists (and
more) which need to be tested. Even if they are not part of the IT secu-
rity project plan, the key elements related to securing your corporate net-
work must be tested.This is different from ongoing monitoring in which
these areas are watched, alerts are set, and log ﬁles are reviewed and ana-
lyzed.Testing requires an active “push” against security areas to ensure
they don’t collapse.A thorough testing plan is critical to solid results.You
can use a variety of normal testing procedures including testing access
controls (too much or too little access for various users and groups), as
well as batch and interactive kinds of testing. (For a list of potential areas
to look at for testing, refer to Table 9.1 in Chapter 9.)

Summary
Managing an IT security project is very similar to managing any other
type of IT project in many respects. However, there are several unique
characteristics that should be addressed as you move through the security
project plan phase. Security is created and maintained by a consistent,
well-thought out approach; all the planning in the world is useless if the
implementation is sloppy.
Monitoring task progress is involves ensuring that tasks are being
started and completed on time and being completed according to speciﬁ-
cations and completion criteria. Project quality (and therefore network
security) is built on the fundamental building blocks of successful task
completion. If tasks are not completed according to speciﬁcation, the pro-
ject will most likely fail to deliver requisite levels of security. Compliance
issues must also be addressed through adequate documentation.As you
progress through your tasks, documentation about the work performed
and other required data should be developed.Trying to go back and
develop documentation and recall details is almost always more difﬁcult
than doing it in near real-time.
Keeping an eye on issues and changes is also another very important
element of managing an IT security project plan. Issues that arise might
be simple problems, but they might also be bigger issues that impact
functional, technical, or legal requirements.Again, documenting the issues
and actions taken in detail might be the difference between a compliant
and non-compliant project result. Should a security issue arise in the
future, these steps, actions, and resolutions might become legal issues, so
be sure you carefully document your activities with regard to addressing
project issues.
Change happens in all projects, but change to an IT security project
plan can impact network security. Internal and external change must be
monitored, evaluated, and responded to in a clear, concise, and methodical
manner to ensure that security gaps are avoided.
Testing is an important part of project work and there are many dif-
ferent ways to approach it. It should be part of your project planning

activities and comprehensive enough to ensure that your network is as
secure as you’ve decided it can be.Testing also helps ensure that your pro-
ject results meet functional, technical, regulatory, and/or legal require-
ments.Testing should be deep and broad so that various ISAPs are tested
and security across boundaries is also tested.

Initiating the IT Security Project
 Your project plan should be comprehensive and complete before
initiating project work.The areas that should be covered include:
problem statement, mission statement, selected solution, project
constraints and priorities, project requirements (functional, technical,
legal), Work Breakdown Structure with all tasks and task details
deﬁned, project risks and mitigation strategies, project budget and
schedule, required competencies identiﬁed, project team formed,
project processes deﬁned.
 Begin your project with a kick-off meeting to let everyone know
the project is underway.This alerts the organization that it will need
to provide the resources agreed upon during the planning phase.
 Take this opportunity to reiterate the importance of the project and
of project quality. Without attention to detail, your network security
will be put at risk.
Monitoring and Managing 
IT Security Project Progress
 A successful project is built on a series of successfully completed
tasks.
 Task progress should be monitored as should the quality of task
results.
 Project progress is monitored and managed through keeping an eye
on individual task progress as well as the critical path tasks.
www.syngress.com
Managing the IT Security Project • Chapter 7

 Project issues should be addressed with an eye toward security and
compliance. Document issues and resolutions and be sure they
support or enhance security.
 In many IT security projects, documentation is a critical component
to proving or verifying compliance. Be sure your documentation
meets or exceeds minimum requirements.
 Be aware that project documentation of all kinds may become legal
documents if there is a security breach down the road. Be cognizant
of this potential when developing project documentation
requirements and when writing the documentation itself.
Managing IT Security Project Risks
 Your security project plan should include identiﬁcation of known
or anticipated risks along with mitigation strategies.
 Once your project is underway, keep an eye on these risk factors as
well as the triggers you’ve identiﬁed.
 Project risks are both internal and external and you may ﬁnd new
risks as you begin implementing your plan.
 Be aware of any potential new risks to your project such as a new
threat or a new regulation.Address these risks by assessing the
likelihood of occurrence, the criticality of such an occurrence, and
the cost or impact of such an occurrence and then create your
mitigation strategy accordingly.
Managing IT Security Project Change
 Change happens in every project, but change in an IT security
project plan has the potential to create additional security
challenges.
 It’s not uncommon for stakeholders to request or demand change
once a project is underway.
www.syngress.com
166
Chapter 7 • Managing the IT Security Project

 Don’t dismiss stakeholder change requests. Instead, review the
requests and determine if you missed including them in your
original project plan (IT error).
 Some change requests come up because more information is known
once the project is underway. Changes should be evaluated to
determine if they support, enhance, or detract from security.
 Changes that support or enhance security should be evaluated to
determine what, if any, impact they will have on the existing project
and on overall security.
Testing IT Security Project Results
 Test plans may be part of the project’s WBS, or testing might be a
separate project altogether.
 Test plans should test the security within the targeted area as well as
across the enterprise.
 Testing is usually a combination of scenarios and interactive and
scripted testing techniques.
 Be careful to avoid inadvertently “testing the plan.” Instead, test the
actual network security independent of the plan.
 Test plans should include people, process, and technology across the
ISAPs and across the enterprise so that they are comprehensive,
inclusive, and holistic.

Introduction
In previous chapters, we focused on the elements of Information
Technology (IT) project management that are particular to a security pro-
ject plan.This chapter focuses on standard project management methods.
(For the purposes of this chapter, we will assume that you have a solid IT
project management background.) 
Closing out a security project plan is different from closing out a stan-
dard IT project plan, because there are more serious ramiﬁcations for
security projects. In a standard IT project, if you change the scope, decide
to forego a few tasks, or are unable to resolve a problem, you can usually
save those issues for a subsequent project or version. In the case of secu-
rity, what you skip over or omit could be what hackers ﬁnd and exploit;
therefore, the project close-out process must be thorough and diligent. In
this chapter, we look at determining when the project is complete, how
to close out various issues, and how to prepare for implementation,
deployment, and transfer.These elements are critical to maintaining secu-
rity; thus, particular attention must be paid to this area. Finally, we look at
capturing lessons learned and ﬁnalizing project documentation.This is
another area that may require a different approach than that of a standard
IT project, due to the potential for compliance with various laws, regula-
tions, or standards related to network and data security.
Evaluating Project Completion
When is your IT security project complete and how will you know? The
obvious answer is,“When all tasks are 100 percent complete,” but a more
accurate answer might be,“When all tasks on the critical path are 100
percent complete.” Still, that’s not a real-world answer, because the actual
data vs. the planned data are often at odds with one another.As you near
the conclusion of your IT security project plan, you should begin gath-
ering data, status reports, and other information that will help you deter-
mine exactly when your security project plan will conclude.
www.syngress.com
170
Chapter 8 • Closing Out the IT Security Project

There are numerous project tracking methods you can use for your
IT security project to determine actual project completion. If your pro-
ject parameters specify that the budget (cost) is the priority, you may have
to terminate your project when you reach a speciﬁed budget amount,
regardless of whether or not you’ve completed the project tasks. By the
same measure, if you determine that schedule (time) is the highest pri-
ority, you may have to terminate your project when you reach a speciﬁed
date or deadline, even if all of the project tasks have not been successfully
completed.
The problem with this is that if you fail to complete all project tasks,
you may be leaving yourself open to security breaches.As you manage
the project, you need to keep these parameters in mind.You may have to
make a few tough decisions (e.g., omitting a particular set of project tasks
after determining they are not needed immediately or can be postponed
with minimal risk). With security, you fall into a difﬁcult situation where
you can’t reasonably reduce the scope, increase the budget, or lengthen
the schedule without putting the security at risk. Some of the tasks that
could potentially be omitted or delayed from the current project might
include upgrading a particular technology that meets speciﬁcations today,
but is not optimized for handling evolving threats.You might choose to
delay this until a later phase when time, money, or resources are more
available.This is not without risk to overall security and the project itself,
but is an example of the kinds of situations where you might have to
make a difﬁcult trade off.
If you ﬁnd yourself approaching the end of your schedule or the
bottom of your budget and you haven’t completed the security project
plan, you have a problem. In Chapter 7, we recommended you keep your
project parameters in the forefront of your decision-making, and that you
actively manage the scope to avoid running into these problems. While
problems will inevitably arise, managing them pro-actively will help you
avoid running out of leeway on your project.
When all is said and done, it’s a good idea to step back and look at
the actual data vs. the planned data to determine what worked, what
didn’t work very well, what went horribly wrong, what snuck up on you,
www.syngress.com
Closing Out the IT Security Project • Chapter 8
171

and what worked surprisingly well. In every project, there are all of these
elements and looking at your project in retrospect will help you and your
team learn a lot about many aspects of the project, the organization, and
the team.A project summary report is often required (or desired), and the
opportunity to look back through the report should be utilized in a posi-
tive, productive manner. Some company cultures seem to get locked on
the negative aspects, and project reviews turn into blame-fests. Don’t let
this occur. Look at what worked, what didn’t work, and what can be
improved for next time. Be brutally honest in your review, but be profes-
sional and positive in your communication. Create a culture where
people feel comfortable admitting their shortcomings, errors, or omissions
so that a better system can be created to avoid those problems in the
future. If you create a culture where people are reluctant to identify or
own these issues, they’ll keep cropping up. Remember the saying,“The
deﬁnition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting
different results.”
Closing Issues Log, Change 
Requests, and Error Reports
As with any IT project, issues logs should be actively managed throughout
the project lifecycle. If you’ve assigned an owner of the issues log (see
Chapter 7), you should have little problem with outstanding issues at the
end of the security project plan. If you have not been actively managing
the issues log, you run the risk of ending up with open issues that prevent
project closure or leave a huge security hole. Issues log items should be
resolved and the resolution should be well-documented.Also, you may
have legal liabilities that stem from the issues and resolutions (see Chapter
7).Addressing known issues in a reasonable manner and documenting
those resolutions are important elements of reducing risk.
At this point in the process, change requests should be addressed and
resolved.These change requests should be recorded, evaluated, incorpo-
rated (or rejected), and documented.As with issues, the key in an IT secu-
rity project plan is to thoroughly document the changes made so you can
www.syngress.com
172
Chapter 8 • Closing Out the IT Security Project

update your documentation, operational procedures, and policies.At pro-
ject close-out, you should not have any open change requests. Change
requests should be evaluated and incorporated into the security project
plan task plan or they should be rejected. If any are still open at the end of
your project, it’s usually because you have changes that need to be made to
something that falls outside the scope of the project. If this is the case, be
sure you ﬁnd an appropriate method for transferring this knowledge to
the appropriate parties (e.g., a change request deemed to be outside the
scope of the project might be transferred to the training department so
they can develop targeted training on this topic for users). Rather than
changing the project itself, you might decide that changing a user proce-
dure or policy makes more sense and delivers the same or more security.
Typically, error reports indicate a problem that should be resolved
before a project is closed out. However, in some cases, error reports fall
outside the scope of the IT security project plan. When this happens, the
team decides whether the issues can be resolved in an alternate manner.
An error report outside the scope of the project should be tracked as an
“issue” that can be transferred outside the project during close out. If it’s
an actual error, it should be resolved within the scope of the project.
The net result is that all issues, change requests, and errors should be
resolved or transferred at project close out. Whatever process you use,
document all of it so you don’t get caught short during an audit or in the
aftermath of a subsequent security breach.Also, a security project has
more legal and regulatory implications.
Preparing for Implementation,
Deployment, and Operational Transfer
We’ve already covered closing out the issues, change requests, and error
logs and transferring any open or outstanding items to the appropriate
places. Beyond closing these items out, you should begin looking at the
other elements of the IT security project that need to be documented
and handed-off for implementation, deployment, or operations. Many of
these are standard processes you’ve used countless times in other IT pro-
www.syngress.com
Closing Out the IT Security Project • Chapter 8
173

jects; however, when you move into the realm of IT security, there may
be additional steps needed to complete the preparation for project com-
pletion. Remember, too, that since the perception of project success is as
important as real deliverables in the minds of many stakeholders, how you
handle closing the project and transferring operational knowledge can
increase or decrease that perception. Users and others in the organization
may only see the operational component, since much of the project plan
may be done by subject matter experts including security analysts and
high-end IT staff.Therefore, how you handle this aspect of the project
may be the only part visible to the organization and may be the only
thing upon which success is judged by a majority of stakeholders. Of
course, at the end of the day, project success will be tied to what doesn’t
happen (e.g., the intrusion averted, the data secured, and so on).As we’ve
discussed, it’s often hard to tout success based on the absence of some-
thing, so your most tangible opportunity to tout project success may be
through this operational transfer process. Make good use of it.
Preparing for Implementation
Implementing security elements is often part of the IT security project
plan. However, there may be instances where certain portions of imple-
mentation fall outside the security project plan.This might include
changes to policies and procedures that are recommended but not imple-
mented, or changes to logons or other security methods that must be
rolled out in a particular manner or in a particular timeline (e.g., some
companies might choose to implement security measures in segments,
such as ﬁrst implementing security measures for all users in the Finance
department).This is often done to ﬁnd and resolve problems that may
arise during the implementation phase without completely disrupting the
organization.Your security project plan may have other kinds of imple-
mentation needs that will be completed outside the security project plan
itself, or after project work is complete. If implementation happens out-
side the scope of your security project plan, be sure that the information
required for implementation is well-developed by deﬁning the imple-

174
Chapter 8 • Closing Out the IT Security Project

mentation requirements and including tasks that address implementation
needs.Also, be sure to include milestones in your security project plan so
that internal (to the project) and external events remain in sync. Finally,
be aware of the need to review your implementation plans from a secu-
rity viewpoint. If you’re implementing changes outside the scope of the
project, are there risks to doing so? How will you test, monitor, and
remediate implementation results? Who is responsible for the implemen-
tation work? Keep these issues in mind as you begin to close out the pro-
ject, so that all of your hard work on the security project plan is
supported throughout the implementation plans.
Preparing for Deployment
Deployment might also be part of the IT security project or it might fall
outside the scope of the security project plan. Deployment might include
installing new Intrusion Detection System (IDS)/Intrusion Prevention
System (IPS) systems or upgrading servers based on recommendations
from the security project plan. Security project plans often include the
deployment of security solutions as a second phase of the project, but this
varies from company to company and from one IT security project plan
to another. Deployment includes installing hardware and software and
documenting how they will be installed, tested, and turned over. In some
cases, this is the same as an implementation plan. In other projects, there
is a discrete deployment team whose job it is to take the recommenda-
tions and deploy them.As with an implementation plan, a deployment
plan that is outside the scope of the security project needs to tie in
closely.The deployment team needs to be aware of the security project
plan timelines so they can plan accordingly.They also need to be aware of
problems, issues, and questions that are still open so they can either par-
ticipate in solving/closing those issues or so they can work around them.
All deployment plans should include a rollback plan that explains
what you should do if things go wrong. Delineating the steps for backing
out of a security implementation or deployment is important especially if
the deployment causes signiﬁcant network or resource access issues. If
www.syngress.com
Closing Out the IT Security Project • Chapter 8
175

someone sets access control to critical ﬁles on a database server incor-
rectly and no one can access these ﬁles, what steps will you take to
quickly resolve this? What if these changes have already been replicated
across the enterprise? These are the kinds of things you should include in
your deployment rollback plans for the major changes you’re under-
taking. Identifying how to roll back to the last known good state is an
important part of the planning process, especially if these plans follow
your IT security project plan.
Preparing for Operational Transfer
Operational transfer typically refers to the point at which a project is
handed off to the users. However, in an IT security project plan, this may
also be transferred to the IT staff responsible for the day-to-day opera-
tions. Since your security project plan(s) may have utilized subject matter
experts to assess security and develop security solutions, your project may
have developed information that needs to be documented and transferred
to whoever is responsible for the day-to-day operations. In essence, the
operational plan should include:
■
The tasks for handing off the project deliverables
■
The strategy to be used for the handoff (How will the handoff
occur?)
■
The key resources needed
■
The task owners
■
The timing of transfer tasks
■
The cost of transfer tasks
■
The schedule for transfers
■
The risks and contingency plans for transfers
■
The formal acceptance or closure methods for transfers
www.syngress.com
176
Chapter 8 • Closing Out the IT Security Project

Your IT security project plan concludes with a successful transfer to
operations.These operational plans form the keystone to maintaining
security and, in particular, maintaining compliance after the project
concludes.Therefore, it is critical that sound planning occurs at this
juncture.These activities can be included in your IT security project
plan itself, or they can be a separate implementation plan, whatever
works best for your situation. Keep in mind that you should document
operational issues throughout the project lifecycle, so that when it
comes time to transfer operations you have well-documented data.Your
operations data should include procedures for:
■
Maintaining new security measures
■
Monitoring security
■
Reviewing and analyzing security audit and log files
■
Taking action based on audit and log file analysis
■
Alerting an emergency response team to a potential security
problem
■
Addressing user issues with new security policies and proce-
dures
■
Escalating emergency and ongoing issues
■
Ongoing user security awareness and education
Be sure you identify the timelines for transfer and provide all neces-
sary training, information, and documentation, so that the hard work
undertaken during your security project plan lifecycle will be sup-
ported, maintained, and perhaps enhanced.

Business Intelligence…
Don’t Just Lob It Over the Fence
Operational transfer is a critical component to maintaining IT security,
even though some of these areas can fall outside the normal domain of
the IT department. IT may not be involved with developing user policies
beyond some basic IT issues like password complexity; however, in the
world of IT security, paying close attention to operational transfer is very
important. If you drop the ball here, all of that hard work you and your
team did during the project lifecycle is put at risk, because all the best
security measures in the world don’t add up to anything without con-
sistent operational security afterward. Operational transfer often hands
over control from the project team to the user, but in the case of IT secu-
rity, it might also include transferring operations from the project team
to the IT staff who manage day-to-day operations. In either case, be sure
that your project deliverables include the details and necessary informa-
tion for the operations team. If necessary, create several working ses-
sions where the project team can do a download to the operations
group and provide the detailed information necessary for a successful
hand off.
Reviewing Lessons Learned
As mentioned in Chapter 6, it’s a good idea to document lessons learned
during the course of the project itself, rather than wait until the last
minute to gather this data.This should be included in the task details and
the information should be shared with the team during the course of the
security project plan. It’s often the case that lessons learned can be used
during the remaining project plan.At the end of the project, however,
you should have a wrap-up meeting to review the lessons learned, the
context of the lessons learned, the improvements that can be made, and
the positive things that worked and should be repeated in the future.
While it’s important to discuss tough issues head on, it’s also important to
www.syngress.com
178
Chapter 8 • Closing Out the IT Security Project

focus on what worked well or what you discovered that you could use in
the future to make subsequent projects more successful.
Some of the things you should have captured during the project
include:
■
Problems resulting from incomplete or unclear project deﬁnitions
(problem, mission, potential solutions, selected solution, project
priorities).
Example:The lesson learned might include spending more
time deﬁning the speciﬁc problem so that the project is more tar-
geted or focused. It might also include spending more time with
stakeholders in advance of project planning. Finally, it might
involve asking someone from human resources to facilitate your
planning meetings so they are more productive.
■
Problems arising from lack of clarity or agreement regarding pro-
ject parameters including scope, schedule, budget, and quality as
well as the relative priority of each of these factors.
Example: Users will be able to logon to access ﬁles. If a
metric measures project success, it must be speciﬁc and measur-
able. Users will be able to logon to the system with a single user-
name and password to access ﬁles across all domains.The logon
should be completed by the server within 10 seconds of user data
being submitted locally. Users logging in via remote connections
should receive authentication within 20 seconds, depending on
the user’s connection speed.
■
Problems arising from inaccurate or unrealistic scheduling or
budgeting.
NOTE
Scheduling and budgeting are skills that are improved with practice
and evaluation. Being honest about how well you and your team did in
this area will help you ﬁnd ways to improve for future projects).
www.syngress.com
Closing Out the IT Security Project • Chapter 8
179

Example: It is not possible to develop an accurate schedule
until the requirements are clearly understood. One solution is to
revise the high-level project plan and the high-level schedule in
more detail as the project becomes more deﬁned.This allows you
to know if the project is getting too expensive.Too often, initial
estimates are used as targets; learning to reﬁne estimates and
manage expectations is often a lesson learned in project manage-
ment.
■
Changes to the scope that caused problems including how
changes were requested, evaluated, implemented, and docu-
mented.
Example:Your current change management process may uti-
lize a monthly change request meeting, but changes are occurring
in the project that have not been discussed in the meeting.You
may need to revise your process to include a more formal,
written acceptance of changes so that stakeholders are not slip-
ping changes in through back channels.
■
Problems resulting from organizational challenges including lack
of executive support, lack of organizational support, lack of
reporting clarity, lack of resources stemming from organizational
constraints, unanticipated organizational change, and so on.
Example:You began implementing security changes for
remote access, but the marketing department put an immediate
halt to the security project plan because they were in the middle
of a huge client project.Their plan was being disrupted in ways
no one anticipated, and they could not afford the downtime.The
lessons learned here might include bringing in a wider group of
stakeholders during the planning process, and communicating
more effectively about the expected outages and timelines once
the security project plan begins, so that any mission-critical activ-
ities can be accommodated.
■
Things that were unplanned and unanticipated that disrupted the
project.
www.syngress.com
180
Chapter 8 • Closing Out the IT Security Project

■
Anything that worked well (as opposed to a problem) from Items
1 through 6 above.
Example:Two Finance department employees and two subject
matter experts assisted you in developing a more reﬁned project
budget.
Sometimes lessons learned are much simpler than that. It might be
that someone discovers a faster, easier method of updating server settings
or restoring a security template. It doesn’t have to be a major, life-altering
change to be worthy of mention.You may choose to create two cate-
gories—one called “Best Practices” and the other one called “Lessons
Learned.” In this way, you can differentiate between the two and share the
data accordingly.
Whatever you do, make sure you don’t just gather the data, record it
someplace, and move on. If you never incorporate the information,
you’ve wasted your time capturing it. Find ways to make use of the data
so that you and your team can continuously hone your project manage-
ment skills and make continuous improvements. In this rapidly changing
global business environment, organizations that don’t learn often fail.This
is a great opportunity for you to help ensure your organization continues
to grow and learn and remain competitive in a highly competitive world.
Documentation 
and Compliance Reports
Documentation for your IT security project comes in two basic ﬂavors:
documentation you and your team need for departmental or organiza-
tional reporting, and documentation you need for regulatory compliance
reports.These are not necessarily one and the same, although to the
extent that you can re-purpose material or generate one report that will
serve two purposes, you’ll be better off. Finding ways to streamline
reporting and documentation from a compliance perspective is important,
and you may choose to purchase a software solution that helps you main-

Closing Out the IT Security Project • Chapter 8
181

tain security and compliance.This may be part of your overall corporate
IT security project plan or it may be a task or a sub-project.
The speciﬁc data needed to document your project at close out will
vary depending on the details of the project.At minimum, you should
have the following:
■
Status reports from your team.
■
Project status reports to your executive team.
■
Project status reports to your project sponsor.
■
Original project plan (including work breakdown structure
[WBS], schedule, and budget).
■
Revised project plan (including any change requests that were
incorporated).
■
Final project plan (including ﬁnal schedule and budget).
■
Lessons learned and best practices.
■
Project team member performance reviews (some companies do
this as part of project close out, some do not). Follow your com-
pany’s practices regarding this or check with your Human
Resources department).
■
Suggested or implemented revisions to standard operating proce-
dures.
■
Suggested or implemented revisions to company and user policies
and procedures.
■
Documentation for user training (if applicable).
Let’s look at these in more detail.The status reports from your IT pro-
ject team should be collected and archived in some accessible location in
the event there are any questions about what was done when.Again,
these may end up as legal documents, so they should be handled in a
manner appropriate to your company and the regulations under which it
operates. If in doubt, seek the appropriate legal counsel. In some cases,
www.syngress.com
182
Chapter 8 • Closing Out the IT Security Project

these documents can raise more questions than they answer—especially if
they are informal documents—so, be sure to either dispose of them or
archive them in a manner appropriate to your situation.The same holds
true of status reports to your executive team or project sponsor.
The original security project plan, including the WBS and all deﬁned
tasks, should be archived for two reasons. First, it’s good to have a copy of
the original plans for future reference.You will want a snapshot of the
project in its original state for review and assessment. Second, the original
project security plan details the scope of the project and may be used (or
needed) later to assert that your ﬁrm took “reasonable care” to address
security issues.This is a two-edged sword, however, since you may also
ﬁnd that your ﬁnal project plan was scaled down and that one or more
fairly important security areas were left out of the security project plan
due to ﬁnancial or scheduling constraints.
You should also review the original project documents against the
ﬁnal documents. In particular, review the actual data vs. the planned data
for major tasks or deliverables, to see how well you’re doing with plan-
ning and estimating.Accurately estimating the cost and duration of pro-
ject tasks can be challenging, and the more you do it, the better you’ll get
if you spend time looking back at the original plan (e.g., if you thought
that the assessment would take three weeks and cost $5,000, and it took
seven weeks and cost $9,000, you need to understand why).There are
essentially two things to look for: did things go wrong that you should
have (or could have) anticipated (i.e., did you just miss something), or did
things go wrong that you could not have anticipated. Be extremely
honest in your assessment (it’s not about blame, it’s about understanding
how to improve), and look for ways to enhance your overall project plan-
ning skills with the team.The better everyone becomes at project plan-
ning, especially with respect to identifying key tasks, creating a reasonable
and achievable schedule, and developing a realistic budget, the better your
project results will be.

Business Intelligence…
Compliance, Reporting and Security
The maze of compliance and reporting issues facing IT security projects
can sometimes be daunting. More important, a company may be com-
pliant and not secure or secure and not compliant. The problem is that
many of these regulations are either still evolving or they are unclear
because they were crafted by people who understood the intent but
not the implementation of these measures. That leaves you, the IT secu-
rity project manager, in the cross-ﬁre. As you evaluate what documen-
tation and compliance reports must be generated throughout the
lifecycle of your project, keep in mind that you will have to ﬁnd a bal-
ance. It will do you no good to claim you were fully compliant after a
multi-million dollar security breach, nor will it do you any good to claim
you had National Security Agency-grade security after a failed compli-
ance audit. Make sure you discuss these challenges with your manager
and with the project sponsor, so you don’t end up being “thrown under
the bus” if things get difﬁcult later. Throughout this book, we’ve advo-
cated documenting everything thoroughly, clearly, and accurately while
being cognizant that these may become legal documents down the
road. If you can present a compelling argument for the decisions you
make, you may manage to successfully walk that ﬁne line between
security and compliance.
Ultimately, compliance is a business issue that must come from the
top down in the organization. Much of the regulatory and compliance
requirements had their genesis in corporate malfeasance. However
unfortunate it is, the primary responsibility for taking “reasonable
action” falls on the IT department, because it is the easiest, most clearly
deﬁned target. Whenever possible, bring this further into the organiza-
tion and continue to educate executives and users that compliance is an
organizational issue, not just an IT issue.

Chapter 8 • Closing Out the IT Security Project

Summary
Closing out an IT security project includes many of the same tasks as
closing out any other IT project.There are, however, a few notable differ-
ences. When evaluating security project plan completion, you need to be
sure that you have completed all of the tasks in the project or you may
subject your network to unexpected security risks. In a typical project,
the ramiﬁcations of such an oversight are often not as serious as in a
security project, so taking extra care to ensure the project is complete
before closing it out, is always wise.
During the course of the project, you had issues, change requests, and
error logs in which you tracked outstanding items.These should be
reviewed and each item in the list should be properly dispatched. Leaving
items open is messy and leaves your project exposed to risk. If an item
cannot be properly closed, it should be transferred to some other mecha-
nism or tracking system so the project can be closed and so the issue can
still be addressed.
Another part of closing out the project is preparing for the imple-
mentation, deployment, and/or operational transfer.This is a very impor-
tant part of the project, because it not only impacts the users’ (and the
organization’s) perception of project success, it also helps ensure that the
security measures you’ve worked so hard to develop are successfully
implemented and maintained.
Project close-out is a good time to capture and summarize lessons
learned, and to craft best practices based on those lessons.Though this
information should be captured in task details throughout the project
lifecycle and shared regularly during the security project plan, you should
debrief with the IT project team at the end of the project to look at the
bigger picture lessons learned and to develop plans for incorporating
lessons learned into a future security project plan. Organizations that
don’t learn often fail. Knowing how to incorporate lessons learned into
your processes and procedures will help you make continuous improve-
ments to help your company remain highly competitive in the global
marketplace.

Deﬁning and developing project documentation should be part of
your security project planning process and at project close-out, these doc-
uments should be gathered, summarized (if needed), and archived. Be
aware that project documentation may end up in a courtroom some day,
if a security breach occurs and litigation follows. While that’s a scary
thought for many IT professionals, you can (and should) seek legal
counsel as to how and when to dispose of or archive project documenta-
tion for any security project.That said, normal project procedures
included reviewing various project documents and closing or transferring
issues.There may be additional documentation required for compliance-
based reporting, and those should also be included in your project plan-
ning process.At the end of the project, you should have the required
documentation for compliance reporting rather than having to step back
through the project to deﬁne and develop that documentation.
Solutions Fast Track
Evaluating Project Completion
 Project completion typically occurs when all task work is
completed.
 In security-related projects, ensuring all tasks are 100 percent
complete is important to network security. Status reviews and
task documentation can help ensure planned work is actually
complete.
 If you’ve come to the end of your schedule or budget and you
haven’t yet completed your security project plan, you have a
serious security risk that must be resolved.
Closing Issues Log, Change 
Requests, and Error Reports
 Closing out issues logs involves reviewing all open issues and
determining the appropriate disposition. If an issue is open that
needs to be resolved, you cannot close out the project.
www.syngress.com
186
Chapter 8 • Closing Out the IT Security Project

 If an issue needs to be resolved outside the scope of the security
project plan, be sure there is an appropriate transfer mechanism
available so the issue remains visible and on someone’s “to do” list.
 Change requests should be evaluated and either incorporated or
rejected during the security project plan cycle. If there are open
change requests, you may have a problem.As with open issues, a
change may be needed outside the scope of your security project
plan, and it may need to be transferred to the appropriate forum.
 Although error reports are likely to be hardware- and software-
based and, therefore, resolved within the scope of the project, you
should check that all open issues have been satisfactorily resolved
and documented.
Preparing for Implementation,
Deployment, and Operational Transfer
 All project documentation should be deﬁned in the project
deﬁnition phase and consistently collected and reviewed during
the project plan phase.
 During project close out, documentation should be updated and
ﬁnalized for review or archiving.
 Project documentation can be construed as legal documents
related to the security project plan, and should be treated as such.
Consult with legal counsel regarding the appropriate storage or
disposition of these documents.
 Implementation, deployment, or operational transfer are all visible
aspects of the security project.They present great opportunities to
increase the perceived value and success of the security project
through ﬂawless execution.
 Operational transfer is an important connecting point between
the IT security project team and those responsible for
maintaining security on a day-to-day basis. Be sure to provide
www.syngress.com
Closing Out the IT Security Project • Chapter 8
187

your operations staff with the tools and knowledge needed to
successfully monitor, maintain, and improve security.
Reviewing Lessons Learned
 The lessons learned should be gathered as part of the tasks details
and reviewed on a periodic basis with the team.
 A project close-out debrieﬁng on the lessons learned and the best
practices can help team members incorporate the ﬁndings and
support organizational learning.
 Improving your project results through reviewing and
incorporating lessons learned helps keep your company
competitive in the worldwide market.
Documentation and Compliance Reports
■
Documentation needed for the project should be deﬁned and
developed during the project planning stage.
■
Documentation includes project status reports, original project
plan, schedule, and budget; revised project plan, schedule, and
budget; the actual data vs. the planned data analysis and more.
■
Compliance documentation should be deﬁned in the project
tasks and task details, so that at the end of the project you will
have all of the data and documentation needed for compliance
audits or reviews (to the degree possible).
■
Compliance documentation will vary depending on the laws and
regulations your ﬁrm must comply with. Keep in mind that all
project documentation related to a security project could become
legal documents in the future; therefore, handle it accordingly.

WARNING: DO NOT PRACTICE LAW WITHOUT A LICENSE
In virtually every U.S. state, individuals are legally prohibited from prac-
ticing law without a license. For example, in Colorado, “practicing law” is
deﬁned, by law, to include, “counseling, advising and assisting [another] in
connection with” legal rights and duties. Penalties for the unauthorized
practice of law in Colorado can include ﬁnes or imprisonment. Information
security consultants should not, under any circumstances, purport to
advise customers as to the legal implications of statutes such as the
HIPAA, Gramm-Leach-Bliley ﬁnancial information privacy provisions, or
other federal, state, or local laws or regulations. First, the consultants risk
legal action against them by doing so. Second, they do their customers a
grave disservice by leading them to believe that the customers can take
any legal comfort from advice given them by non-lawyers.

Introduction
This chapter provides the framework for creating an overarching corpo-
rate Information Technology (IT) security project plan. In subsequent
chapters, we’ll step through Individual Security Area Projects (ISAPs).
This and subsequent chapters are intended to be used as templates to
guide you through your security project planning process.There is no
one-size-ﬁts-all approach to any security project planning process; thus,
you will need to modify your security project plan to ﬁt your organiza-
tion’s requirements.This chapter provides the basic building blocks to
help you get started.As you read this chapter, keep in mind that the same
principles apply, with some variation, to each of the ISAPs discussed later
in this book.As you become familiar with the framework used in this
chapter, you’ll be able to see more clearly how this and subsequent ISAP
plans should be modiﬁed to ﬁt your own unique needs. This chapter also
discusses a security audit.
Deﬁning Your Security Strategy
Managing IT security across an enterprise is one of the most important
business problems you’ll face in your IT career. IT security impacts the
ongoing viability and competitiveness of your company. Regardless of the
assets and resources that need to be secured (information, technology,
assets), you must have a clear strategy you can implement, monitor, and
revise as the business and operational environments change. In the long
run, the effectiveness of your overall IT security strategy depends on how
well it is aligned with and supports the organization’s business drivers.
Your corporate IT security project plan must provide the strategic vision
for how you address enterprise-wide IT security. Many organizations
understand that IT security project success depends on gaining executive-
level management support and aligning security goals with the mission,
vision, and objectives of the organization. When IT security is aligned
with business objectives, security becomes a tool to enable and support
your company’s strategy, rather than just a black hole for IT expenditures.

Chapter 9 • Corporate IT Security Project Plan

Your corporate IT security project essentially deﬁnes your security
strategy for the organization. While it must include speciﬁc deliverables
related to key areas of enterprise security, it also needs to address the
higher level strategic security approach. Clearly, your security strategy
should be aligned with organizational objectives in order to add value to
the organization and gain key management support.Your security strategy
should be deﬁned prior to initiating your corporate IT security planning
process so that you have a clear view of the required objectives.Your cor-
porate IT security plans also have to align with the reality of your organi-
zation.You must live within the company’s constraints, which may
include budget, schedule, stafﬁng, or other overarching organizational lim-
itations. It doesn’t matter if you create a masterful security strategy or
project plan if it costs far more than your company can afford or requires
resources your company doesn’t have.Your goal should be to ﬁnd an
optimal solution that ﬁts within the constraints of the organization.
A technical report, written by Richard Caralli at Carnegie Mellon
entitled “The Critical Success Factor Method: Establishing A Foundation
For Enterprise Security Management” (Technical Report, CMU/SEI-
2004-TR-010, ESC-TR-2004-010, July 2004), identiﬁes the following
ﬁve key success factors in developing an enterprise security strategy:
■
The skills, capabilities, and efforts of the entire organization must
be utilized and mobilized.
■
The key functions and processes in the organization must collab-
orate on shared security goals and strategy.
■
The organization’s security objectives or an articulation of its
“desired state” must be developed and understood.
■
Critical assets that are essential to achieving the organization’s
mission must be identiﬁed and protected.
■
IT operations and support must enable security goals.
It should be evident that if you lack a strategic view of security in the
enterprise, you’ll have difﬁculty getting executive support for your initia-

tives.As you learned in Chapter 1, executive support for IT projects is the
number one success factor. Developing a security strategy that supports
and enhances organizational goals is the primary way to achieve your IT
security mission-critical objectives. With that in mind, we’ll dig into
developing a corporate IT security plan that supports your organization’s
objectives. In addition, your strategy should take into account the pre-
dominant legal issues your organization might have to contend with.
Legal Standards 
Relevant to Corporate IT Security
WARNING: THIS SECTION DOES NOT CONTAIN LEGAL ADVICE
This section provides an overview of a number of legal issues faced by infor-
mation security professionals and their companies. Hopefully, it will alert you
to the issues on which you should consult qualiﬁed legal counsel experienced
in information security law. This chapter, however, does not, and cannot, pro-
vide any legal advice or counsel to you. You should not, under any circum-
stances, purport to rely on anything in this book, chapter, or section
“Legal Standards Relevant to Corporate IT Security,” as legal advice.
Likewise, following any of the suggestions in this section does not create an
“advice-of-counsel” defense to regulatory or law enforcement action or to civil
legal claims. If you are involved in information security and have any questions
regarding the law and IT security, you are strongly urged to retain qualiﬁed,
experienced legal counsel.
The following sections discuss the legal standards relevant to IT security.
The corporate IT security project plan is the appropriate place to discuss
these elements, because you need to be cognizant of the legal issues sur-
rounding IT as you formulate your comprehensive security project plan.
As written in the above sidebar, nothing in this section (or book, for that
matter) should be construed as legal advice in any manner. Instead, it is
provided as an overview of some of the legal issues involved with IT
security. Some IT professionals fail to understand the legal implications
for IT security and put themselves and their companies at substantial legal

risk.This section is intended to give you a jump start in understanding
some of the issues so you can determine for yourself what additional
resources and assistance you might need to ensure that you and your
company are adequately protected.
We know that laws are made by politicians and that politicians are
driven by public and media reaction to speciﬁc incidents.As is often the
case, laws are made piecemeal to deal with individual incidents.At some
point, a critical mass is reached and lawmakers may patch together a
number of initiatives to address a growing concern.The result, however, is
often a set of laws that are inconsistent, piecemeal, spotty, and sometimes
contradictory.
This is the current situation in the law of information security.As dis-
cussed in “Selected Federal Laws” below, federal law regulates information
security for, among other things, personally identiﬁable health care infor-
mation, ﬁnancial information of individuals, and, to an increasing degree,
ﬁnancial information in the hands of publicly traded companies.There
currently is no “omnibus” federal statute governing all information secu-
rity. Instead, the standards are pieced together in response to various per-
ceived (and actual) problems found in the public and private sector.
For IT security professionals, this is a good news/bad news story.
Often, attempts at “comprehensive” legislation turn out to be a jumbled
mess, particularly when multiple economic sectors with differing opera-
tional environments and needs are being regulated, and lawmakers lack a
clear understanding of the technological issues at hand. Such regulation
can be particularly ineffective (or worse) when forced upon the private
sector. On the other hand, a patchwork of different federal, state, and
international laws and regulations (as is the current state of information
security law) can be confusing and puts a premium on careful, case-spe-
ciﬁc legal analysis and advice from qualiﬁed and experienced counsel.
If you’re reading this wondering how your small company can afford to
address these legal issues, there is some good news. First, you can do your
own research and become conversant with the various legal issues relevant
to your company’s IT security. First, you can do your own research and
become conversant with the various legal issues relevant to your company’s

IT security.You should be aware, however, that doing your own research
provides you with no legal protection, unless you get a legal opinion from
qualiﬁed outside legal counsel. At a minimum, you should take this infor-
mation to a competent attorney that specializes in IT security and under-
stands your business sector to get a legal opinion to protect your company’s
interests. If you do your homework, your legal bills will be far less than if
you walk in the door unprepared. Have speciﬁc questions prepared and
then ask “What else do I need to know?” It may not be your speciﬁc
responsibility to do this, but as the IT security project manager for your
company, you have the responsibility to bring these potential legal issues to
the attention of senior management so they can make the determination as
to the best way to address and mitigate legal risks.
Selected Federal Laws
To illustrate the array of laws that impact information security, the fol-
lowing provides a general survey of statutes, regulations, and other laws
that may govern information security consultants and their customers.
This list is not exhaustive, but may help identify issues and understand
which “best practices” have actually been adopted in law. If any of these
areas apply to your company, you can do additional research, consult your
in-house counsel, or hire outside counsel to advise you on how to ensure
your company’s legal exposure is reduced to the greatest degree possible.
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act
One of the earliest US government forays into mandating information
security standards was the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA). Section
501(b) requires each covered ﬁnancial institution to establish “appropriate
safeguards” to: (1) ensure the security and conﬁdentiality of customer
records and information; (2) protect against anticipated threats or hazards
to the security or integrity of those records; and (3) protect against unau-
thorized access to, or use of, such records or information which could
result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer. GLBA
required standards to be set by regulation for safeguarding customer infor-
mation.This task was accomplished with the publishing of the
www.syngress.com
194
Chapter 9 • Corporate IT Security Project Plan

Interagency Guidelines Establishing Standards for Safeguarding Customer
Information (the “Guidelines”).The Guidelines apply to customer infor-
mation maintained by covered “ﬁnancial institutions,” both of which
terms are broadly deﬁned under applicable law and regulations.The
Guidelines require a written security program speciﬁcally tailored to the
size and complexity of each individual covered ﬁnancial institution, and
to the nature and scope of its activities. Under the Guidelines, covered
institutions must conduct risk assessments to customer information and
implement policies, procedures, training, and testing appropriate to
manage reasonably foreseeable internal and external threats. Institutions
must also ensure that their Board of Directors (or a committee thereof)
oversees the institution’s information security measures.
Further, institutions must exercise due diligence in selecting and over-
seeing, on an ongoing basis, service providers (entities that maintain, pro-
cess, or otherwise are permitted access to customer information through
providing services to a covered institution). Institutions also must ensure,
by written agreement, that service providers maintain appropriate security
measures.
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996
(HIPAA) became law in August 1996. Section 1173(d) of HIPAA
required the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to adopt
security standards for protection of all Electronic Protected Health
Information (EPHI). Development of these security standards was left to
the HHS Secretary, who released the HIPAA Security Final Rule (the
“Security Rule”) in February 2003.All covered entities, with the excep-
tion of small health plans, must now comply with the Security Rule.
Because HIPAA has, in some ways, the most elaborate and detailed guid-
ance available in the realm of federal law and regulation with regard to
information security, we focus more on the HIPAA Security Rule than
any other single federal legal provision. In addition, many of the general
principles articulated in the Security Rule are common to other legal
procedures dealing with information security. In general, the HIPAA
www.syngress.com
Corporate IT Security Project Plan • Chapter 9
195

Security Rule mandates speciﬁc outcomes and speciﬁes process and pro-
cedural requirements, rather than speciﬁcally mandated technical stan-
dards.The mandated outcomes for covered entities are:
■
Ensuring the conﬁdentiality, integrity, and availability of EPHI
created, received, maintained, or transmitted by a covered entity
■
Protecting against reasonably anticipated threats or hazards to the
security or integrity of such information
■
Protecting against reasonably anticipated uses or disclosures of
EPHI not permitted by the HIPAA Privacy Rule
■
Ensuring compliance with the Security Rule by its employees.
Beyond these general, mandated outcomes, the Security Rule contains
process and procedural requirements broken into several general categories:
■
Administrative Safeguards Key required processes in this area
include: conducting a comprehensive analysis of reasonably antic-
ipated risks; matrixing identiﬁed risks against a covered entity’s
unique mix of information requiring safeguarding; employee
training, awareness, testing, and sanctions; individual account-
ability for information security; access authorization, manage-
ment, and monitoring controls; contingency and disaster recovery
planning; and ongoing technical and non-technical evaluation of
Security Rule compliance.
■
Physical Safeguards Physical security safeguard measures
include: mandated facilities access controls; workstation use and
workstation security requirements; device and media controls;
restricting access to sensitive information; and maintaining offsite
computer backups.
■
Technical Safeguards Without specifying technological mech-
anisms, the HIPAA Security Rule mandates automated technical
processes intended to protect information and to control and
record access to such information. Mandated processes include
authentication controls for persons accessing EPHI, encryption/
www.syngress.com
196
Chapter 9 • Corporate IT Security Project Plan

decryption requirements, audit controls, and mechanisms for
ensuring data integrity.
The Security Rule contains other requirements beyond these general
categories, including: ensuring by written agreement that entities with
whom a covered entity exchanges EPHI maintain reasonable and appro-
priate security measures, and holding those entities to the agreed-upon
standards; developing written procedures and policies to implement the
Security Rule’s requirements, disseminating such procedures, and reviewing
and updating them periodically in response to changing threats, vulnerabili-
ties, and operational circumstances.
Sarbanes-Oxley Act
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX) has gotten a lot of media attention
in the past few years and came on the heels of some very well-publicized
corporate scandals, most notably the collapse of Enron. SOX creates legal
liability for senior executives of publicly traded companies, potentially
including stiff prison sentences and ﬁnes of up to $5,000,000 per violation,
for willfully certifying ﬁnancial statements that do not meet the require-
ments of the statute. Section 404 of SOX requires senior management, pur-
suant to rules issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), to
attest to:“(1) the responsibility of management for establishing and main-
taining an adequate internal control structure and procedures for ﬁnancial
reporting; and (2) …the effectiveness of the internal control structure and
procedures of the issuer for ﬁnancial reporting.” (See Chapter 13 sidebar
“SEC Announces Next Steps for Sarbanes-Oxley Implementation to Help
Small Companies” for an update on recent changes related to Section 404).
Section 302 also requires that pursuant to SEC regulations, ofﬁcers signing
company ﬁnancial reports certify that they are “responsible for establishing
and maintaining internal controls,” and “have evaluated the effectiveness” of
those controls and reported their conclusions as to the same.

Federal Information Security and Management Act
The Federal Information Security and Management Act of 2002, as
amended, (FISMA) does not directly create liability for private sector IT
security professionals or their companies. However, IT security profes-
sionals should be aware of this law, because it:
■
Legally mandates the process by which information security
requirements for federal government departments and agencies
must be developed and implemented
■
Directs the federal government to look to the private sector for
applicable “best practices” and to provide assistance to the private
sector (if requested) with regard to information security
■
Contributes to the developing “standard of care” for information
security by mandating a number of speciﬁc procedures and 
policies
If you work for the federal government or an organization that comes
under federal auspices, your organization may be directly impacted by
FISMA.
FERPA and the TEACH Act
The Family Educational Right to Privacy Act (FERPA) prohibits educa-
tional agencies and programs, at risk of losing federal funds, from having a
policy or practice of “permitting the release of ” speciﬁed educational
records. FERPA does not state whether or not the prohibition places afﬁr-
mative requirements on educational institutions to protect against unautho-
rized access to these records through the use of information security
measures. It is certainly possible that a court could conclude in the future
that an educational institution which fails to take reasonable information
security measures to prevent unauthorized access to protected information is
liable under FERPA for “permitting the release” of such information.The
recent case of a Vermont college system employee having such data on a
laptop that was later stolen (see Chapter 1 sidebar “The Real Cost of
Remediation”) might test this very statute.The 2002 Technology, Education,
www.syngress.com
198
Chapter 9 • Corporate IT Security Project Plan

and Copyright Harmonization Act (the “TEACH Act”) explicitly requires
educational institutions to take “technologically feasible” measures to prevent
unauthorized sharing of copyrighted information beyond the students
speciﬁcally requiring the information for their studies, and, thus, may create
newly enforceable legal duties on educational institutions with regard to
information security.
Electronic Communications Privacy 
Act and Computer Fraud and Abuse Act
These two federal statutes, while not mandating information security proce-
dures, create serious criminal penalties for any persons who gain unautho-
rized access to electronic records. Unlike laws such as HIPAA and GLBA,
these two statues broadly apply, regardless of the type of electronic records
that are involved.The Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA)
makes it a federal felony to use or intercept the contents of electronic com-
munications without authorization. In addition, the Computer Fraud and
Abuse Act of 1984 (CFAA) makes it a felony to gain unauthorized access to
a very wide range of computer systems (including ﬁnancial institutions, the
federal government, and any protected computer system used in interstate
commerce).As a result, IT security professionals, especially outside consul-
tants who may test client security (i.e., try to hack into a system to gain
unauthorized access) must take great care, and rely on qualiﬁed and experi-
enced legal professionals to ensure they receive authorizations from their
clients that are broad and speciﬁc enough to mitigate potential criminal lia-
bility under the ECPA and the CFAA.

What to Look For in Your Attorneys
There are a number of obvious characteristics one should seek in any
attorney retained for any purpose. These include integrity, a good repu-

Corporate IT Security Project Plan • Chapter 9

Continued

tation in the legal community, and general competence. You also want
to consider an attorney with a strong background in corporate and busi-
ness transactions who is familiar with the contracting process. One
useful tool for evaluating these qualities as you attempt to narrow your
list of potential attorneys to interview is a company called Martindale
Hubbell (www.martindale.com). Look for lawyers with an “AV” rating
(Martindale’s highest).
(Note: Never hire any attorney without at least one face-to-face
meeting to learn what your gut tells you about whether you could work
with him or her.) 
In the area of information security evaluation, you will want to look
for attorneys with deep and broad expertise in the ﬁeld. The best way to
do so is to look for external, independently veriﬁable criteria demon-
strating an attorney or law ﬁrm’s tested credentials (e.g., is the lawyer
you seek to retain listed on the National Security Agency Web site as
including individuals certified as having been trained in NSA’s
Information Security Assurance Methodology (IAM)? If so, on the appro-
priate NSA Web page (e.g., www.iatrp.com/indivu2.cfm#C), you will
ﬁnd a listing similar to this: Cunningham, Bryan, 03/15/05, (303) 743-
0003, bc@morgancunningham.net) 
Has an attorney you are considering authored any published works
in the area of information security law? Has he or she held positions, in
the government or elsewhere, related to information security? Finally,
there’s the gut check. How does your potential lawyer make you feel?
Are you comfortable working with him or her? Does he or she commu-
nicate clearly and concisely? Does he or she seem more interested in cov-
ering their own backside than in providing you with legal counsel to
protect your interests?
State Laws
In addition to federal statutes and regulations implicating information
security, there are numerous state laws that, depending on an entity’s loca-
tion and the places in which it does business (also known as nexus), can
also create legal requirements related to the work of information security
professionals.

Unauthorized Access
In Colorado (and in other states), it is a crime to access, use, or exceed
authorized access to, or use of, a computer, computer network, or any
part of a computer system. It is a crime to take action against a computer
system to cause damage, to commit a theft, or for other nefarious pur-
poses. However, it is particularly important for IT security professionals to
be aware that it is also a crime to knowingly access a computer system
without authorization or to exceed authorized access.This is one reason
it is critical for IT security consultants, with the advice of qualiﬁed and
experienced counsel, to negotiate a comprehensive, carefully worded,
Letter of Authorization (LOA) with every client.
If you are hiring an outside consultant, they should insist on this type
of authorization if they plan on testing your network’s security. If they do
not insist on this (or even mention it), you should seriously review the
consultant’s credentials to be sure they have the requisite skills and
knowledge you’re looking for. If they are not hired to actually test your
system for vulnerabilities and will not be testing for the ability to gain
unauthorized access, this type of LOA may not be needed. On the other
hand, if a consultant asks for this type of authorization and it’s not what
you hired them to do, it should signal a serious disconnect that should be
addressed before going any further. Be sure you’re hiring a bona ﬁde con-
sultant and not a rogue hacker in a business suit.
Enforcement Actions
What constitutes the “reasonable standard of care” in IT security will
continue to evolve, and not only through new statutes and regulations.
Prosecutors and regulators will not be content to wait for such formal,
legal developments. In lawsuits, prosecutors and regulators have demon-
strated the clear intent to extend “reasonable” IT security measures even
to those entities not clearly covered by speciﬁc existing laws.This is being
done through legal actions leading to settlements, often including consent
decrees (agreements entered into to end litigation or regulatory action)
wherein a company agrees to “voluntarily” allow regulators to monitor
www.syngress.com
Corporate IT Security Project Plan • Chapter 9
201

(e.g., for 20 years) the company’s IT security program. Such was the case
with the company that ended up purchasing CardSystems, the credit card
transaction processing company that was responsible for millions of credit
card holders’ information being compromised (described in Chapter 1).
Since these agreements are publicly available, they are adding to the
“standard of care” to which organizations will be held.They also provide
added support for similar enforcement actions in the future.Thus, even if
your company is not speciﬁcally required by law to take certain security
measures, it might still suffer rigorous legal consequences for its actions.
Three Fatal Fallacies
The saying goes,“A little knowledge is a dangerous thing.”The same can
be said of conventional wisdom. Unfortunately, many organizations and
IT professionals, upon realizing they have legal and other requirements
for IT security, have come to believe incorrect information regarding
their security decisions. Let’s take a look at a few of these common mis-
understandings.
The “Single Law” Fallacy
Many IT security professionals, both within companies and those
working as consultants, subscribe to the “single law” fallacy.That is, once
they identify the laws, statutes, or set of regulations they think apply to
them, they address just those issues under the belief they’ve got their legal
bases covered. In fact, this may or may not be the case. Rather than
blithely making these assumptions, you or your company should seek
competent legal advice to mitigate the legal risks.Take, for example, a
mid-sized college or university. IT security professionals may conclude
that, since FERPA clearly applies to educational records, following guid-
ance tailored to colleges and universities based on what they conclude are
the appropriate Department of Education standards, is sufﬁcient to miti-
gate any potential legal liability.This could be an expensive assumption to
make, particularly if the educational institution does not ask itself the fol-
lowing questions:

Chapter 9 • Corporate IT Security Project Plan

■
Does the school grant ﬁnancial aid or extend other forms of
credit? If so, it could be subject to GLBA.
■
Does it operate hospitals, provide psychiatric counseling services,
or run a student health service? If so, it could be subject to
HIPAA.
■
Does the school’s Web site contain any representations about the
security of the site and/or university-held information? If so, it
could be subject to lawsuits under one or more (depending on
whether it has campuses in multiple states) state deceptive trade
practices laws.
The Private Entity Fallacy
Focusing on SOX and the resulting preoccupation with publicly traded
companies, some institutions take solace in being private and in the fact
that, so the argument goes, they are not subject to SOX and/or that they
can somehow “ﬂy under the radar” of federal regulators.Anyone who
believes that lawyers for future plaintiffs (students, faculty, victims of
attack, or identity theft) will be deterred by the literal terms of SOX is
misguided.The argument will be that the appropriate “standard of care”
for IT security was publicly available and well known.And, just because
your company may not speciﬁcally be obligated under SOX, there are
numerous other segments of the law that could apply such as HIPAA,
GLBA, state statutes, and common law theories and, depending on where
an entity does business, international and foreign law, such as the complex
and burdensome European Union Privacy Directive.
The “Penetration Test Only” Fallacy
Some IT security professionals are so conﬁdent in their security solutions
and implementations that they hire an outside security consultant just to
try to break into the system.This can be the case when the company is
strapped for funds and doesn’t believe it can afford an outside security
consultant, or when the organization has a fairly strong group of IT pro-
fessionals in-house.The problem is, if you hire an outside consultant to
www.syngress.com
Corporate IT Security Project Plan • Chapter 9
203

do a penetration test (also called a “pen test”), you are exposing your
company to potential legal liabilities.Think of it this way.An IT security
consultant performs a penetration test and gets in. He or she exposes one
or more weaknesses in your system.This exposes vulnerabilities that are
now publicly (or at least with an outside entity) documented and open to
the legal discovery process. While you may hire an outside ﬁrm to do a
penetration test at some point, it should be as part of a holistic approach
to IT security utilizing both internal and if desired, external, resources.
Do It Right or Bet the 
Company: Tools to Mitigate Legal Liability
In recent years, numerous articles have been written on how to protect
your network from a technical perspective, but, at least throughout mid-
2005, the headlines were full of examples of companies that have lost
critical information due to inadequate security. ChoicePoint, DSW Shoes,
several universities, ﬁnancial institutions including Bank of America and
Wachovia, MasterCard and other credit providers, and even the FBI have
been named in recent news articles for having lost critical information.As
one example, ChoicePoint was sued in 2005 in actions brought in states
ranging from California to New York and in its home state of Georgia.
Allegations in the lawsuits included that ChoicePoint failed to “secure
and maintain conﬁdential the personal, ﬁnancial and other information
entrusted to ChoicePoint by consumers”; failed to maintain adequate
procedures to avoid disclosing some private credit and ﬁnancial informa-
tion to unauthorized third parties; and acted “willfully, recklessly, and/or
in conscious disregard” of its customers rights to privacy.
It’s not hard to imagine that if you work for a medium-to-large com-
pany that deals with consumer data of any kind, that one day you may be
faced with an IT security-related lawsuit, frivolous or not.The question
is, what can you as the IT security project manager do to help your com-
pany reduce its litigation “target proﬁle?” Creating a thorough corporate
IT security project plan helps, but there are a few additional tips we’ve
provided below.

Chapter 9 • Corporate IT Security Project Plan

We Did our Best; What’s the Problem?
Many companies feel that their internal IT technology and security staffs
are putting forth their best efforts to maintain and secure their networks.
They may know there have been no signiﬁcant security breaches and that
the organization has well-deﬁned procedures for handling important data.
They may even hire an outside security consultant for periodic penetra-
tion tests that result in no penetration occurring.All’s well, right? Not
really. Simply doing one’s best is not enough in today’s litigious environ-
ment. Corporate efforts must also be grounded in complying with
existing, external legal standards. In ChoicePoint’s case, at least based on
what has been made public, penetration tests would not have helped.
ChoicePoint appears to have fallen victim to individuals who fraudulently
posed as businessmen and conned people into giving them what may
have been otherwise secure information.This was a classic case of social
engineering at its best. Penetration testing would have shown that the
networks were secure, but as we know, no network is completely secure
and social engineering is a good example of that.
Addressing any one particular potential point of failure will almost never
be enough. Companies today must understand the potential sources of lia-
bility that apply to all companies, as well as those speciﬁc to their industry.
Companies can minimize their risk through understanding the legal envi-
ronment and adopting and implementing policies to assure a high level of
compliance with current legal requirements. Of course, this approach
cannot be non-static, either. It requires an ongoing review and implementa-
tion to assure compliance in an ever-changing legal environment.As part of
your corporate IT security plan, you should be sure that your project plan
includes the ongoing security maintenance and monitoring activities
needed to continually assess and improve your organization’s security mea-
sures. (This topic is addressed in more detail in Chapter 13.)
Negligence and the “Standard of Care”
Clearly, there are numerous variations to the ways IT security can be
breached and how those breaches can impact companies and individuals
(customers, employees, and so forth). Understanding the basis for liability
www.syngress.com
Corporate IT Security Project Plan • Chapter 9
205

and conducting business in a manner designed to avoid liability is the best
defense. In many cases, the claim of liability is based on a charge that the
company and its ofﬁcers and directors acted “negligently.” In law,“negli-
gence” arises when a party owes a legal duty to another, that duty is
breached, and the breach causes damages to the injured party. Generally
speaking, acting “reasonably” under the circumstances will prevent com-
panies from being found “negligent.”The problem is that the deﬁnition
of “reasonable” can be tricky and changeable.
When a company maintains personal or conﬁdential customer informa-
tion, or has agreed to maintain as conﬁdential the trade secret information
of another business, its minimum duty is to use reasonable care in securing
its computer systems to avoid theft or inadvertent disclosure of the infor-
mation entrusted to it. Reasonable care may be an extremely high standard
when trust and conﬁdence are placed in a company to secure sensitive
information.A reasonable “standard of care” is what the law deﬁnes as the
minimum efforts a company must take not to have acted negligently (or,
put another way, to have acted reasonably).A good starting point for all IT
security is to implement security measures to the known standard of care
required to avoid liability.While that sounds a bit like a circular statement,
let’s look at a very simple example.We all know that viruses make their
way through e-mail systems all the time.Any company that does not have
an enterprise-wide anti-virus software solution in place, that does not scan
every incoming e-mail for viruses and other known attacks, has not imple-
mented a reasonable level of care. If a new variant of a virus is released at
midnight and your anti-virus vendor doesn’t provide an updated signature
ﬁle until 4:00AM, are you liable for private data being distributed by this
new virus via an e-mail leaving your server at 2:00AM? Probably not.What
about a case where that e-mail doesn’t go out until 9:00AM? Now it’s not
so clear. Should your virus deﬁnition ﬁle be updated the instant the anti-
virus company releases the update, or is there a “reasonable” window of
time during which you cannot be held accountable? Unfortunately that
question can sometimes only be answered by twelve people sitting in a jury
box—not the ideal place to look for answers to corporate questions.
Therefore, if you perform to a reasonable standard in your IT security prac-
tices, you will limit your liability to the greatest degree possible.

Chapter 9 • Corporate IT Security Project Plan

What Can Be Done?
Fully understanding the risks, as assessed by qualiﬁed and experienced
counsel, is an essential ﬁrst step.Taking action that either avoids liability
or minimizes the consequences when things go wrong is the next step.
The following are some suggestions that might help as you assess your
risk and determine your optimal security solutions.
Understand Your Legal Environment
Mitigating legal liability begins with understanding the laws applicable to a
company’s business. Ignorance of the law is no excuse, and failure to keep
pace with statutory requirements is a ﬁrst source of liability.Working with
professionals, whether inside or outside of the company, to track changes in
legislation and tailor your IT security policies, is the ﬁrst line of defense.
Careful compliance with laws not only helps reduce the potential for crim-
inal liability or administrative ﬁnes, but also demonstrates that all important
“standard of care” that might mitigate civil liability as well.
Comprehensive and Ongoing Security 
Assessments, Evaluations, and Implementation
Working with qualiﬁed and experienced legal counsel and technical con-
sultants, a company must identify and prioritize the information it con-
trols that may require protection.That process should include cataloging
the speciﬁc legal requirements applicable to such information and to the
type of business you’re in. Next, policies must be developed to ensure that
information is properly maintained.As we’ve discussed, this has every-
thing to do with end user and employee training on security policies,
procedures, and security measures.Your corporate IT security plan is only
as good as the implementation and maintenance of those security mea-
sures, so including the development and implementation of policies and
procedures in your corporate IT security plan is vital.
The process of thorough and unbiased assessments, tests, evaluations,
and implementation must be ongoing.A static one-shot assessment is
almost worse than none at all.Almost equally bad is insufﬁciently training
employees on appropriate policies and procedures for maintaining 
www.syngress.com
Corporate IT Security Project Plan • Chapter 9
207

security measures, or never evaluating those employees on their under-
standing and implementation of security measures. (The need for
employee awareness and training is discussed in Chapter 13.)
Use Contracts to Deﬁne 
Rights and Protect Information
Almost every company has trade secrets—from its customer lists to its
business methodologies—that are what afford a competitive advantage.
Any protection for these valuable assets will be lost if a company fails to
make reasonable efforts to maintain the information as conﬁdential.At a
minimum, contracts must be developed that commit employees not to
disclose the trade secrets or any information legally mandated to be pro-
tected (e.g., individual health care or ﬁnancial information).These agree-
ments are often most effective if entered into at the time of employment.
While this clearly is not within the purview of the IT department, your
understanding of the organizational mechanisms that support IT security
will help you develop better IT security project plans. In addition, you
may ﬁnd it desirable to advise your Human Resources department, in
conjunction with appropriate legal counsel, on what types of policies,
procedures, and employee contracts are appropriate in your organization
based on the nature and value of the company’s data.
Employment policies should reinforce the employee’s obligation to
maintain conﬁdentiality.These policies should also provide clear guidance
on which procedures to use to maintain password security and to respon-
sibly use the information secured on the network. Regular employee
training should be implemented to reinforce the notion that these
requirements are mandatory and taken seriously by management. Vendors
and service providers that may need to review conﬁdential information
should only be permitted access to such information under an agreement
limiting the use of that information and agreeing to maintain its conﬁ-
dentiality. In most cases, vendors or outsiders should be speciﬁcally
required to sign conﬁdentiality or non-disclosure agreements to mitigate
liability. Hiring any outside consultant to perform a network security
evaluation or to review other secret or conﬁdential data without a proper
www.syngress.com
208
Chapter 9 • Corporate IT Security Project Plan

conﬁdentiality agreement in place, could later be found to be sufﬁcient
evidence that a company failed to make “reasonable efforts” to maintain
information as conﬁdential. In worst case scenarios, this can result in the
information no longer being considered a trade secret and therefore no
longer entitled to protection.
Use Qualiﬁed Third-party Professionals
A key requirement emerging as a critical part of the evolving IT security
standards of care is the requirement to get an external review by quali-
ﬁed, neutral parties.These requirements are based on the theory that, no
matter how qualiﬁed, expert, or well intentioned an organization’s IT staff
is, it is impossible for them to be truly objective. In addition, there is the
ever-present risk of the “fox in the hen house,” leaving senior manage-
ment to wonder whether those charged with creating and maintaining IT
security can and will fairly and impartially assess the effectiveness of such
security. Finally, qualiﬁed and experienced outside legal counsel and tech-
nical consultants bring perspective, breadth of experience, and currency
with the latest technical and legal developments that in-house staff nor-
mally cannot provide cost-effectively.This is not a pitch to get you to run
out and hire an outside consultant, but the smart people know when to
ask for help, and this might be a good place to start.
Making Sure Your Standards-of-Care
Assessments Keep Up with Evolving Law
As suggested above, the legal deﬁnition of a “reasonable” standard of care
is constantly evolving. Legislators are beginning to take seriously the
threats and the substantial economic loss caused by cyber attacks, and to
create laws to address these problems. New laws are continually being
enacted to punish attackers and to shift liability to companies that have
failed to take reasonable IT security measures. Contractual obligations can
now be formed instantly and automatically simply by new customers
accessing your company’s Web site and using your services from any-
where in the world.As new vulnerabilities, attacks, and countermeasures
come to public attention, new duties emerge. In short, what was “reason-
www.syngress.com
Corporate IT Security Project Plan • Chapter 9
209

able” last month may not be reasonable this month. IT security assess-
ments and evaluations provide tools to evaluate and comply with best
practices in protecting critical information. However, at best they are only
snapshots unless they are performed on a consistent and ongoing basis.
Best practices begin with understanding and complying with applicable
laws, but security can only be maintained through tracking and imple-
menting evolving statutory requirements. Working with qualiﬁed and
experienced counsel to follow new legal developments in this fast-
moving area of the law and provide advice on the proper interpretation
and implementation of legislative requirements can be extremely helpful.
In fact, it’s becoming increasingly important for mid- to large-sized com-
panies in this ever-changing legal landscape.
Plan for the Worst
Despite all best efforts, nothing can reduce a company’s liability to zero
(short of closing the doors permanently and even that’s not a guarantee).
One of the things smart companies have learned is that if (or when) a
security breach occurs, the best thing a company can do is get out in
front of it quickly. Clearly, part of your corporate IT security project
planning work should include incident response to address any security
breaches. It should also include your internal and external response plans,
including updating security procedures, communicating with appropriate
stakeholders, and possibly preparing public statements or press releases.
Avoiding liability involves planning for problems (e.g., one class action
ﬁled against ChoicePoint alleges that shareholders were misled when the
company failed to disclose [for several months] the existence of its secu-
rity breach and the true extent of the information that was compro-
mised.) Having policies in place to provide guidance to executives in
communicating with customers and prospective shareholders may have
helped ChoicePoint avoid these allegations.
California currently has a Notice of Security Breach law that was
enacted in 2002.As of 2005,Arkansas, Georgia, Indiana, Montana, North
Dakota, and Washington have followed suit by enacting some form of
legislation requiring disclosure relating to breaches of security, and bills
www.syngress.com
210
Chapter 9 • Corporate IT Security Project Plan

have been introduced in not less than 34 other states to regulate in this
area.As of mid-2005, there was no similar federal regulation, although,
several disclosure bills have been introduced in Congress.Again, though
your job is not speciﬁcally to address the legal issues of a breach, your IT
security plan should incorporate the development of policies and proce-
dures to be implemented if a security incident takes place. By working
with key stakeholders ahead of time, you can reduce the impact of a
potential security breach by helping those outside the IT environment
understand how you will respond, what steps you will take, and how you
will communicate this information within the organization.
Insurance
As more information security breaches occur and are disclosed, the cost to
businesses and individuals will continue to rise. In 2002, the Federal Trade
Commission (FTC) estimated that 10 million people were victims of iden-
tity theft.According to Gartner, Inc., 9.4 million online users in the U.S.
were victimized between April 2003 and April 2004, with losses amounting
to $11.7 billion. Costs to business from these losses will likely grow to stag-
gering levels in the coming years, and this trend is capturing the attention
of some of the more sophisticated insurance companies. Some companies
are developing products to provide coverage for losses resulting from
breaches of information security. Companies should contact their carriers
and do their own independent research to determine what coverage, if any,
is or will become available.Again, this may fall outside the scope of your
duties as IT security project manager, but is another opportunity for you to
add value to your organization by recommending to your executives that
they consider evaluating the need for such coverage. In many cases, execu-
tives may not be aware of the existence of this type of insurance and as an
IT security expert, part of your job is to keep your company’s executive
team up to speed on this type of relevant information.
This rather exhaustive look at IT security from the legal perspective
can cause many IT security professionals to start losing sleep at night.
Clearly, there are risks in every aspect of business and IT security is no
different.Your company must reduce its exposure to liability by taking
www.syngress.com
Corporate IT Security Project Plan • Chapter 9
211

reasonable measures, commensurate with best practices in the industry, to
secure sensitive information.You can’t provide a 100 percent guarantee
that your network will never be breached or that your company won’t
face a lawsuit stemming from a breach.You can, however, develop a thor-
ough IT security project plan, implement it ﬂawlessly, maintain and
review security on a regular basis, and train your company’s staff on the
latest security measures and attack countermeasures. With that in mind,
let’s return to your corporate IT security project plan.
Corporate IT 
Security Project Plan Overview
As discussed in the earlier chapters in this book, we’re going to look at
ISAPs.To that end, we’re starting with the overarching plan, the corporate
IT security project, which in most companies will include many of the
ISAPs presented in subsequent chapters.The plans will all follow the same
outline:
1. Deﬁne your overarching corporate security strategy.
2. Deﬁne the speciﬁc problem area (security audit, risk assessment).
3. Deﬁne the desired (required) outcome(s).
4. Identify potential solutions.
5. Deﬁne project constraints.
6. Deﬁne project requirements (functional, technical, legal).
7. Select optimal solution.
8. Deﬁne project team.
9. Deﬁne project procedures.
10. Deﬁne project work breakdown structure, tasks, owners,
resources, budget, and schedule.
11. Monitor and manage project.
12. Hand off and close out project.

Chapter 9 • Corporate IT Security Project Plan

As mentioned in the previous section, you need to start from a clearly
deﬁned security strategy. It is outside the scope of this book to step you
through developing that strategy, but you can ﬁnd ample information in
various resources, including “How To Cheat At IT Project Management.”
Deﬁning your strategy in alignment with corporate goals should be the
starting point for your corporate IT security project plan.This chapter
assumes that you’ve done that work already. If you haven’t, take a step
back and deﬁne your strategy before developing your corporate IT secu-
rity plan.You’ll save yourself a lot of time and re-work by doing so.
Depending on how your organization works, it’s usually advisable at
this point to identify your core project team or at least those players you
need at the outset to help you develop project parameters. If you work
on this by yourself, you may inadvertently be creating two problems.
First, you undermine your own ability to develop team buy-in for the
project. When people work together to deﬁne a project, they are much
more likely to feel a sense of ownership and will therefore work harder to
make sure the project is successful. Second, you will probably overlook
key elements because you can’t reasonably expect to know everything
that should be included in the project. Getting training, human resources,
ﬁnance, operations, and legal representatives on the team early will help
ensure that your project plan contains all the required elements to meet
key stakeholder needs. If you miss this step, you will either deliver a pro-
ject that falls short of organizational needs, or you’ll have to go back and
re-work a lot of your project plan. Change is always easier and less
expensive to instigate at the outset of the project planning process.
In the IT security world, deﬁning the problem is typically accom-
plished through a security audit.You may choose to perform a compre-
hensive security audit or you may choose to audit individual security
areas ﬁrst. Regardless of which way you approach the auditing function,
be sure that at the end you have a comprehensive overview. If you work
ﬁrst on the individual areas, be sure you don’t leave gaps “between” the
individual security areas (i.e., the places where various security areas meet
or intersect). If you look at your overall corporate security ﬁrst, be sure to
focus clearly on the individual security areas so you don’t miss some area
www.syngress.com

of detail in one of the ISAPs. Either way, you need to take a comprehen-
sive look, but you can choose to go at it from either direction as long as
you keep in mind that you need to look broadly and deeply at the cur-
rent state of security in your organization.
Before we head into the details, let’s quickly review the framework for
our approach to corporate IT security. If you recall, we delineated
numerous security areas in Chapter 1. We’ve included that same diagram
here in Figure 9.1 for your reference.
Figure 9.1 Corporate IT Security Project Plan Components
As we move through this chapter, keep in mind that we’re focusing on
the overall corporate IT security project plan, but that these same ele-
ments will also be used in subsequent individual security area project
plans.You may have additional ISAPs deﬁned for your organization and, if
so, you can utilize this framework to develop project plans to address
those speciﬁc areas.

Corporate Security Auditing
Before you can embark on any IT security project, you need to under-
stand the current environment.As we’ve stated several times, in project
management, you should start with a problem statement.The problem
statement for corporate security can be as general as,“We currently have
no clear understanding of our network’s vulnerabilities.” However, the
more speciﬁc you get, the better your solution will be. If you say,“Our
network consists of servers, network storage devices, end user computers,
Web services, wireless access and sensitive corporate and customer data.
We do not have a detailed approach to securing these network resources.”
You are getting closer to deﬁning the real problem and closer to identi-
fying the real need. One way to develop a solid security project plan
problem statement is by conducting a thorough security audit. Since
knowing your starting point is the logical genesis of any security plan,
we’re going to delve into the details of conducting a security assessment
or audit.You can conduct your assessment as one of the ﬁrst major objec-
tives of your corporate IT security plan, or you can create a separate
security assessment and auditing project plan to be conducted and con-
cluded prior to the development of your corporate IT security project
plan or any of your ISAPs. Either method is acceptable as long as your
projects build upon the results of your audit. In this chapter, we’ll use the
terms assessment and audit interchangeably.
Auditing means different things to different people but we’ll use a
deﬁnition commonly used in the IT security world: a thorough and
methodical review of systems and technologies focused on ﬁnding vul-
nerabilities. Some companies hire outside security consultants to assist
with their security auditing. If you choose to perform your own network
security audit, you’re going to need several tools and a lot of expertise to
do so effectively.You’ll also need one or more people on your team to
volunteer to think like hackers so you can discover vulnerabilities hackers
would likely exploit.

Corporate IT Security Project Plan • Chapter 9

Business Intelligence…
Ethical Hackers?
The term “ethical hackers” seems like a bit of an oxymoron, however, it’s
actually a growing ﬁeld of interest these days. In order to effectively
thwart hackers, you need to have the same or better skills as hackers.
There are numerous companies that train people to hack systems so they
can use their skills for the beneﬁt, not detriment, of the company.
Numerous organizations provide ethical hacker training and certiﬁcation
programs and you can ﬁnd many listed using a quick online search.
These courses teach participants to use the same tools, techniques, and
thought processes that hackers use in order to exploit vulnerabilities and
to force their way into computers, networks, and other electronic cor-
porate resources. However, there’s good news and bad news. The good
news is that having these skills on your IT team can be valuable in
keeping your corporate network safe. The bad news is that it’s always a
bit unnerving to teach your employees how to hack a network. However,
if you look at the open source model for software development, you ﬁnd
a similar logic. Open the knowledge to many and you have a better
chance of exposing and addressing vulnerabilities. And, while you can
send your employees for training, you can also hire an outside consul-
tant who is a certiﬁed ethical hacker to teach your IT staff how to hack.
Remember, though, your employees may choose to learn on their own,
so keep all of your options open and keep an eye on your network
through various, independent methods.
Choosing A Target
Hackers, like robbers or car thieves, will attack the easiest targets ﬁrst. For
example, in the case of wireless networks, hackers will certainly take an
unsecured wireless network over a protected one any day. Just like the car
thief, the easiest cars to steal are ones that are (in this order):

For a hacker, the easiest networks to hack are those that are unsecured.
However, corporations can be rich targets for hackers, either because of
the data on the network (ﬁnancial, personal identiﬁcation, and so forth) or
because they can access trade secrets, Research & Development, and other
conﬁdential corporate data.The potential payoff makes it worth the effort.
Finally, there is the “hacker of convenience” who hacks into a network just
to see if he or she can; sometimes it just boils down to bragging rights.
Therefore, your goal in network auditing is to ﬁnd the vulnerabilities from
easiest to hardest (just like a car thief). If you plug the obvious holes,
you’re better off than doing nothing, but you’re not secure.
Business Intelligence…
The Best Defense is a Good Offense
What’s the best way to secure your network? By taking both a defensive
and offensive position. The defensive position consists of all the things
you do to secure your network, from requiring strong passwords, to
controlling and auditing access to key ﬁles, to hardening your servers.
It’s like locking the doors and windows on your house to make sure it’s
secure before heading off on vacation. However, that’s not enough in
network security. Hackers, like professional burglars, are scoping out
your network just looking for an opening. In network security, you have
to also take an offensive approach and attack your network from as
many different angles as possible. Not only do you have to think like a

hacker, you have to be as creative as a hacker and think of different ways
to attack your systems. This is one reason outside consultants can be
helpful; they aren’t well-versed in your systems and will come in with a
fresh perspective and without any pre-conceived notions about how
your system does (or does not) work. He or she will be able to examine
elements of your network security you and your team may overlook.
Why Security Fails
An important aspect of understanding how to secure your network
comes from understanding why network security fails in the ﬁrst place.
It’s not just a matter of an unused port being left open on a server or a
default setting being left in place. Security and security failure depends on
a number of interrelated aspects including:
■
Improper conﬁguration
■
Failure to update
■
Faulty requirements
■
Human factors
■
Policy issues
■
Incorrect assumptions
Improper Conﬁguration
Improper conﬁguration is one of the ﬁrst areas IT managers think of
when they think of how security can fail. Failing to change settings from
the default or out-of-the-box settings is a major source of security risk,
since every hacker in the world has access to the same data you do when
it comes to default settings.Those of you familiar with Microsoft
Windows Server operating system know that the major change to the
2000/2003 versions is that the default settings came locked down rather
than fully open. In older versions, Microsoft assumed you’d lock down
any functionality you didn’t want to use or didn’t want users to access.
However, that left many open doors for attacks. In the latest versions, the
www.syngress.com
218
Chapter 9 • Corporate IT Security Project Plan

out-of-the-box conﬁguration comes locked down and you have to delib-
erately enable key functionality.This is clearly a better approach to secu-
rity but it’s not a cure-all. Other equipment including routers and
wireless access points in particular, come with default settings that many
companies fail to change during normal installation and conﬁguration.
In addition to using default settings, there is also the chance for simple
error when making changes to conﬁguration settings. Other times, the
settings are properly conﬁgured but the resulting conﬁguration has unin-
tended consequences elsewhere in the system.These are the kinds of
issues a solid security assessment plan will try to locate and address.
Failure to Update
Anyone working in network security these days is well aware of the need,
or rather the requirement, to keep systems up-to-date.The adage that
“two heads are better than one” comes into play from both sides of this
issue. Hackers are increasingly collaborating together and are getting
smarter and more sophisticated. On the other side of the issue, various
hardware and software vendors are also working harder to maintain secu-
rity. Since attackers are never going to stop trying to improve their
chances of getting into your system, you have to stay one step ahead
through keeping systems up-to-date. If you don’t have a comprehensive
plan in place for keeping operating systems, applications, and security
applications (anti-virus, anti-spyware, and so forth) up-to-date, your entire
network is vulnerable. Part of your assessment should include your cur-
rent update plans.
Faulty Requirements
Functional and technical requirements are the foundation of any tech-
nology project. Whether building a server, designing a rocket, or con-
structing a solar power generator, all require well-designed requirements.
If the requirements are faulty in any way, you have a poorly designed
system. In the case of network security, requirements tend to build one
upon the next, creating a layered effect (e.g., the requirements for the
server hardware, operating system, applications, communications proto-
www.syngress.com
Corporate IT Security Project Plan • Chapter 9
219

cols, network routers, and ﬁrewalls combine to create the security that
impacts that one speciﬁc server. If anywhere along the line those require-
ments are poorly conceived, designed, or executed, you have a potential
security gap.This was the case about ten years ago when some
Department of Defense systems had serious security vulnerabilities. It
wasn’t that the vulnerabilities were new or unique, it was that the systems
were poorly engineered and long-term plans for remediation were
needed. If they had ﬁxed the issues immediately, it would have had a dire
impact on the mission. Faulty or poorly designed requirements can create
a serious problem at many different levels of network security. Each of
your ISAPs as well as your corporate IT security project plans should
include functional, technical, and legal/compliance requirements to
ensure that you are addressing security at the most basic level.
Human Factors
In network security, humans are the weakest link. Human behavior is
fairly predictable. We don’t remember complex passwords very well, so we
write them down. If we don’t have to use complex passwords, we use
ones we can easily remember so we don’t have to write them down.
Unfortunately, these end up being passwords that can be easily guessed or
found through a dictionary search. Using your pet’s name or your wife’s
birthday helps if the attacker doesn’t know you, but a large number of
security breaches happen inside the organization. If your user account has
administrative privileges and you use your wife’s birthday as your pass-
word, how hard is it for someone in your organization to hack into your
account? If you use a word found in the dictionary, a computer could
hack the account in about 20 seconds, on average. Users, developers,
managers, and IT administrators all fall victim to shortcuts for remem-
bering passwords, and there are those in the industry that believe that IT
administrators are the single largest security vulnerability.
There’s also the issue of social engineering, where users are persuaded
or tricked into giving up their usernames and passwords. More sophisti-
cated forms of social engineering have spawned “phishing” and given the
proliferation of the practice, one would have to surmise that phishing is
www.syngress.com
220
Chapter 9 • Corporate IT Security Project Plan

successful enough to be worth the effort. In many cases, it’s just easier to
ask.You’d be surprised how often people will divulge their passwords if
the request appears appropriate. Have any of your IT staff call anyone in
your organization and ask for their password and see how often someone
is willing to divulge it.
Finally, there is the aspect of physical security. Laptops are stolen, users
leave their desks unattended, and network resources are left unsecured.
Physical access to a server is absolutely the best way to hack it. Sitting
down at the receptionist’s desk that’s logged on to the network might
yield useful information to an attacker.Your network assessment needs to
account for the human factor in all areas of security.
Policy Issues
The quality and comprehensiveness of your security policies and practices
is at the heart of your network security.Your policy should be created in
conjunction with your human resources staff and your legal counsel to
ensure that you’re creating policies and procedures that make sense for
the whole organization. Legal counsel helps ensure policies meet legal
requirements, both from a human resources perspective and also from a
legal risk mitigation perspective.Your policies and procedures need to be
strong enough to meet standards of “reasonable care,” but they also must
conform to standard human resources practices.
We’ve discussed the importance of involving key stakeholders in your
project planning process right from the start.This is one key area where
outside assistance from human resources and legal can help tremendously.
If security policies are mismatched to the organization, there’s a very high
chance that compliance will be low.The major problems users run into
with security policies is that they’re:
■
Too Stringent Requiring a 35-character complex password,
multiple logins, and so on. Will usually cause the user to ﬁnd
ways to circumvent the policy.
■
Too Old Outdated security policies undermine the credibility
of the policies that are still up-to-date.Asking users to sort
www.syngress.com
Corporate IT Security Project Plan • Chapter 9
221

through and determine which are relevant and which are not
creates an inconsistent approach to security policies, which leads
to security risks.
■
Unread or Unused Security policies that are not read or
enforced by the IT staff, management, and human resources are
useless. It doesn’t matter how many locks you put on the door if
you leave the door wide open.
■
Vague or Unclear Policies that are vague, confusing, contradic-
tory, or that provide no clear direction on how users can comply
are worse than no policies at all. If users do not understand how
to comply with security requirements, they will usually resort to
doing whatever they need to do in order to get their jobs done.
That often means circumventing security best practices out of
desperation. If users are told they cannot transmit a patient’s med-
ical data across unsecured lines or without encryption but they
don’t know if their lines are secure or how to encrypt a ﬁle,
there’s a good chance they won’t comply.
Your security assessment should include reviewing, modifying,
updating, and deleting all existing security policies so that the resulting set
of policies is up-to-date and relevant to the current (and near future)
security environment for the network.You should also make sure that
your policies are clear enough that users understand and know how to
comply with security policies.
Incorrect Assumptions
The difﬁculty about assumptions is that we don’t always know we’re
making them, and that’s the root of security issues. If we assume users
behave in a particular way and we’re wrong, we potentially have a secu-
rity hole. If we assume a particular set of conﬁguration settings will result
in a particular outcome, we’ve created a potential security hole. If we
assume that the technology works in one way and we’re wrong, we’ve left
the door open to attack.Testing assumptions is an important part of your
www.syngress.com
222
Chapter 9 • Corporate IT Security Project Plan

security assessment process. Unfortunately, it’s not always easy to see what
we’re assuming.There are several ways to address this including con-
sciously asking, on a regular basis,“What assumptions are we making
here?” involving those outside the IT environment to provide a fresh per-
spective and unbiased approach, and hiring outside experts who come in
without those same assumptions in mind.
For example, suppose someone wants to get at your customer
database.The attacker knows your company has a large online store with
millions of transactions ﬂowing through on a monthly basis.The attacker
looks on your company Web site and eventually is able to cause the
database server to generate an error that gives the attacker the informa-
tion he or she was looking for.The attacker uses the result of the database
error to inject code that enables him or her to hack further into the
system. He or she gives themselves administrative privileges, covers their
tracks, and sits in the comfort of his or her home grabbing any database
information he or she wants.You may have looked hard at your Web
server and made sure that it was secure and that customer transactions
were secure and assumed you were all set.These are exactly the kinds of
assumptions attackers hope you’ll make.
Another assumption we discussed earlier in this book is the assump-
tion that the proper steps were followed when implementing various
security measures. If you simply assume the proper steps were followed
and completed, you leave open the possibility that these measures were
not properly completed. Using completion criteria for each task (see
Chapter 6 for more detail) will help ensure that each security task is
completed successfully and per your security project plan. Using comple-
tion criteria and spot checks on various security measures will help you
to know, rather than assume, that your security measures have been prop-
erly implemented.

Corporate IT Security Project Parameters
After completing the risk assessment and impact analysis for your corpo-
rate IT security project, you should have a better idea of the problem(s)
you’re trying to solve and the desired outcomes.These should be well-
aligned with your enterprise-level security strategy. If not, you’ll need to
circle back through the process and locate and address any disconnects.At
the conclusion of this process, you should document both the problem
statement and the outcome statement.This can be a relatively short few
sentences just to make sure you’ve clearly identiﬁed the problem you’re
trying to solve and that you’ve identiﬁed the outcome you want to
achieve.There will always be a balance between security and cost and
between security and operational efﬁciency, and this is the place to begin
to ﬁnd that balance.
Project Objectives
Your corporate IT security solutions should include all of the security
areas you need to address. Figure 9.1 shows several common security
areas that are likely to be a part of your plan.These include general,
infrastructure, Web, wireless, communication, and operational security,
among others.You may ﬁnd that you want to slice and dice your security
areas differently than we have here.That’s ﬁne as long as you take a log-
ical and comprehensive approach to the wide variety of topic areas you
need to cover, and don’t inadvertently omit anything.
Your potential solutions include all of the security topic areas you
want to cover. We also know that in the real world of corporate ﬁnance,
there’s a good chance that your complete list probably falls under the
label “wish list” rather than “to do list.” Since you will likely be forced to
make some compromises and tough choices, it’s important to start with
your ideal list and pare it down from there. Once you’ve identiﬁed your
ideal solution, you need to circle back and see how it compares with your
project constraints starting with the scope, time, cost, and quality.

Chapter 9 • Corporate IT Security Project Plan

Project Parameters
All projects have four parameters: scope, schedule, budget, and quality.As
we’ve discussed, there is a relationship among these parameters that must
be addressed at the outset of any project planning process.You can create
a smaller project scope by phasing your projects and identifying ISAPs
within the corporate IT security project plan.Your overall plan and your
ISAPs will each have the four parameters and will move independently.
For example:Your corporate IT security project may have a schedule
of 12 months and a budget of $500,000.Your communication security
plan, which includes e-mail, instant messaging, Voice over IP (VoIP), and
remote access, has a schedule of 30 days and a budget of $10,000. Clearly,
the 30 days is part of the 12-month schedule and the $10,000 is part of
the $500,000 budget. However, the priority for your corporate IT secu-
rity project might be time —it must be completed in 12 months. On the
other hand, your priority for your communication security plan might be
budget—you don’t care if it takes two months or even three months, but
it can’t cost more than $10,000.
This is one of the reasons it’s helpful to break a project down into
smaller sub-projects.You can adjust priorities for the sub-projects (in our
case, the ISAPs) in a manner that drives your overall goals and objectives.
This can be especially helpful if you believe that another segment of your
corporate IT security project plan could take more time than allotted. In
that case, you might need to allocate more funds to hire outside contrac-
tors to come in and assist in getting the job done. By having both the
overall plan’s project parameters and priorities identiﬁed and by working
with the ISAPs, you can build in a bit more ﬂexibility than you might
have otherwise.
Scope
The scope of your corporate IT security project plan includes the scope
of all the ISAPs (if you choose to break your projects out in this manner),
but that’s not all it should include.The corporate IT security project, in
some sense, is the mortar that holds the bricks (ISAPs) together. Each
www.syngress.com
Corporate IT Security Project Plan • Chapter 9
225

individual security area is important, but without a holistic approach to
security, you’re bound to have gaps between these areas.The scope of the
corporate IT security project should reﬂect this need.You can include the
scope statement from each of the ISAPs and you may want to include the
following items as well:
■
Comprehensive review of network systems security
■
Comprehensive test plan for systems vulnerability
■
Vertical security assessment and hardening
■
Horizontal security assessment and hardening
■
Perimeter security assessment and hardening
■
System-wide IT security policies and procedures
■
Corporate IT security policies and procedures
■
System-wide IT emergency response plan
At the risk of being repetitive, these elements should take a system-
wide or corporate-wide look at the same areas that will be addressed in
one or more of your individual security area plans. In some cases, there is
overlap and in other cases there are gaps.The goal of the corporate IT
security project plan is to ensure that any areas that overlap are appropri-
ately resolved and any gaps that exist are addressed.Think of the corpo-
rate IT security project plan as your last line of defense.
Another useful way to look at the scope is to look at the physical ele-
ments of your network. How many locations does your company have?
How many buildings does that entail? How many logical or physical sub-
nets are there? How many servers? How many desktops? How many
users? Are you planning on addressing every aspect of your IT security in
this plan or are you going to take it in phases? If you remember the pro-
ject management guideline that smaller projects tend to be more suc-
cessful than larger projects, you can see that properly setting your scope is
key to success. If you determine that your corporate IT project must
address every aspect of IT security, you will deﬁnitely need to break it
www.syngress.com
226
Chapter 9 • Corporate IT Security Project Plan

down into smaller ISAPs. If your network security is relatively good and
you simply want to make sure things stay up-to-date with the latest
threats, your scope may not need to be quite as extensive.
Finally, you might look at your network both horizontally and verti-
cally.A vertical approach looks at a single host or single host type and
looks for all vulnerabilities that might impact that host type (e.g., look at
all of the desktop systems running Microsoft Windows XP Professional
and look for all vulnerabilities, threats, and remediation strategies related
to that operating system and those devices.) This is deﬁned as the scope
of your corporate IT security project or the scope of just Phase One.A
horizontal approach is useful for spanning various platforms and might
include looking for any device that could be vulnerable to a Transmission
Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) port scan or a Denial of
Service (DOS) attack.This approach could be used to deﬁne the scope.
Ultimately, you want to review all systems top to bottom and side to
side, but if you’ve recently completed a number of security measures or if
a comprehensive corporate IT security project plan is outside of the
ﬁnancial means of the company, you may choose to scale it down using
these various elements of scope.
Schedule
There are a number of elements regarding the schedule of a corporate IT
security project and the related ISAPs.The overall schedule may be dic-
tated by a planned, future event such as the company going public via an
Initial Public Offering (IPO) or a requirement to be compliant with a
particular set of regulations by a certain deadline, or maybe by a deadline
determined by the executive team.These are external constraints that
must be considered as you build your project plan. If schedule (time) is
your top priority, you already know that something else will have to
“give” if the project runs into problems (which almost all projects do at
one time or another). In this case, you need to plan for the possibility that
you will need to add more people to your project if work is delayed for
any reason.You also need to be ready to scale your scope back a bit if you
fall behind schedule.The corporate IT security plan will have to be the
www.syngress.com
Corporate IT Security Project Plan • Chapter 9
227

most ﬂexible, because it will have to accommodate the changes to all the
underlying ISAPs and it will also have to provide a thorough, integrated
approach to corporate security as a whole.
In addition, you may set high-level target completion dates for various
elements of your project and then set your more detailed schedule based
on the ISAP schedules you develop. For example, you may choose to
complete a Web security project plan ﬁrst, because you know your Web
systems are most vulnerable at this time.You expect that project to take
two months to complete.You might choose to begin the planning stages
of your infrastructure project plan, because you want to begin imple-
menting it as soon as possible.You may also be able to utilize different
members of your IT staff so that you can run these projects in parallel.
These are the kinds of things you can decide on regarding your schedule
when you take a holistic, system-wide look at your security initiatives.
Budget
Determining the budget for your corporate IT security project can be
the most challenging aspect of developing your corporate IT security
plan. How much it will cost is often a function of how much it can cost,
meaning that your security budget may well be set by corporate or IT
budget constraints. If your budget question is answered for you, then
you’ll need to reverse engineer your budget to determine just how much
security you can get for some set number of dollars.
Phasing your security projects can also help when overall cost is not as
much as an issue as the timing of cash ﬂow.You’ll need to determine if
your costs are primarily internal or external. Internal costs are those such
as labor costs for staff, loss of productivity (which often isn’t captured in
any organization), and any other cost that essentially involves shifting
money around in accounts. External expenses are the ones that often have
to be timed and explicitly approved. Purchases including new security
hardware, software, or external labor often require speciﬁc sponsor
approval for the expenditure if it exceeds a certain threshold. Often you
can negotiate a higher overall budget for your corporate IT security pro-
ject by negotiating the budgets for the smaller ISAPs individually. Beware
www.syngress.com
228
Chapter 9 • Corporate IT Security Project Plan

of one trap of this approach. Sometimes you’ll negotiate a budget for an
ISAP such as infrastructure security and, whether accidentally or inten-
tionally, it is construed as your entire security budget. Be extremely clear
in your communications that if you choose to negotiate individual pro-
ject plan budgets that you’re talking about a subset of your total security
needs. If you are painfully clear about this, you’ll avoid problems down
the road, but you will likely have to answer the question,“How much
will the whole thing cost?”Although you may not know (or may not
want to say at that moment), you can brieﬂy lay out your approach to
managing the costs by discussing your overall corporate IT security
strategy. In some companies, this piecemeal approach to budget expendi-
tures is an effective way to reduce organizational resistance to security
spending. In other companies, this approach could be viewed as manipu-
lative or underhanded, in which case you should ﬁnd a more acceptable
method of presenting your budget needs.
Quality
Although even one security breach can be devastating for an organiza-
tion, the cost of guaranteeing zero breaches can be astronomical.You’ll
have to ﬁnd the balance between the quality your organization requires
and the cost it can afford. In many cases, there is a direct relationship
between the level of quality (or the tolerance for breaches) and the cost
of the project.Therefore, if budget is your top constraint, you’ll most
likely need to adjust your scope or your quality. Reducing quality is not
as bad as it sounds.Adobe Photoshop is a great program, but it’s pricey if
all you want to do is view pictures from your digital camera and add cap-
tions underneath. Less expensive programs offer lower quality, but if that’s
all you need, why pay more? The same holds true for your corporate IT
security quality level. Deliver the highest quality you can afford, and rec-
ognize that no solution is ever perfect. Deﬁne what level of risk you can
afford to operate under and let that be your guide to quality. If the level
of quality your organization requires is higher than your budget allows,
you will have to build a business case for increasing the budget.You may
www.syngress.com
Corporate IT Security Project Plan • Chapter 9
229

ﬁnd an ally in your legal department or a legal representative who can
help explain the cost of the risks (and consequences) that you’re trying to
mitigate.
Requirements
Every IT project should have well-developed requirements that deﬁne the
boundaries of your project.Your scope statement states what is and is not
included in the project, but the requirements provide the details for those
scope statements. Functional requirements answer the question,“What
should this project accomplish?”A good example for corporate security
might be that the functional requirement speciﬁes the implementation of a
stronger authentication system, because a recently passed law or regulation
requires it.The functional requirement says the project must include a
“strong authentication system as deﬁned by Regulation 123.”
Technical requirements describe how you will accomplish the func-
tional requirements.They are typically quite speciﬁc and binary: either it
is or it isn’t; either it meets speciﬁcations or it doesn’t.A stronger authen-
tication requirement might provide very detailed technical speciﬁcations
for smart cards or biometric hardware in very speciﬁc language.Technical
requirements are server processor speed or hard disk capacity (i.e., they
are clear, tangible, and relatively easy to deﬁne.)
Project management is an iterative process—you often have to circle
back to add detail as information becomes available. Requirements may
be known at the outset of a project, in which case they should be
included. However, it’s also common for new or additional requirements
to be added as you move through the deﬁnition and planning phases of
your project.You may not know that strong authentication is a require-
ment until you’ve done a risk analysis or audit.You may not know that
you need a biometric system for authentication until you’ve completed
some other part of the project work or read a new section of a regula-
tion.The key is to deﬁne what you’re aware of and revise the project plan
as details become known.That doesn’t mean that you’re shooting at a
moving target—just the opposite. Pin down as many details as possible,
www.syngress.com
230
Chapter 9 • Corporate IT Security Project Plan

knowing that as you gather data and do your research, you’ll develop
ﬁner levels of detail. Don’t get lost in the spin cycle, but do reﬁne your
data as you gather additional information.
Projects may also have some sort of organizational requirements (e.g.,
a particular security measure must be compatible with screen readers used
by visually impaired employees, or the security measures do not violate
employee privacy as deﬁned by the organization.These typically should
be translated into functional and technical speciﬁcations, but they can also
be noted separately as organizational requirements to ensure they receive
the attention they deserve.
Finally, IT security projects will have legal and regulatory issues that
need to be deﬁned as requirements.Again, these can be listed as legal,
regulatory, or compliance requirements to give them needed visibility, but
they ultimately should be translated into functional and technical require-
ments for the project.
Key Skills Needed
Although we touched on this in earlier chapters, this is a good time to
reiterate the basics.Your corporate IT security project team should
include people from all areas of your organization with both technical
and non-technical skills.You can create a list of the technical skills needed
for each of the ISAP projects, and roll your skills list up into your corpo-
rate IT security project plan. However, you might need to take a bit more
time identifying the non-technical skills needed (e.g., you don’t always
need technical people to create security policies that include physical
computer equipment security policies, e-mail, and Internet and training
policies, and you don’t always need technical people to create and deliver
related user training).The following is a list of skills you may need for
your corporate IT security plan:
■
Technical
■
Communication
■
Training
www.syngress.com
Corporate IT Security Project Plan • Chapter 9
231

■
Policy development
■
Technical and non-technical writing
■
User requirement development
■
Financial (to create the budget)
■
Legal (to advise on various aspects of your project)
■
Human Resources (to help develop user guidelines)
From the technical side, there are numerous skills you’re likely to
need.The core skills needed to assess security (which are usually the same
skills needed to implement security solutions after assessment) are oper-
ating system, network, application and programming skills.These skills are
often found in two different groups of people. Most of your IT staff can
be divided into “network guys” and “programmers.”Your network experts
are the ones you turn to when you have a router outage, a server conﬁg-
uration issue, or a new application to install. Programmers typically look
at the world in a different way; they’re usually not the ones you want
conﬁguring your database server, but you do want them writing and
testing the scripts. Understanding the core skills of your IT staff and
where they’re most appropriately applied in your IT security project plan
is critical.
Most technical skill sets are either deep or broad and it’s not too
common to ﬁnd someone whose skills are both. If someone knows
routers inside and out and can list off soft switch settings for every Cisco
product ever made, he or she most likely won’t be able to tell you the
best way to conﬁgure access control lists for the database. In fact, your
department likely has a mix of generalists and specialists speciﬁc to the
jobs you’ve needed to get done in the past. However, that doesn’t neces-
sarily help when you’re looking the skills needed for your corporate IT
security project.A skills assessment may be necessary before you under-
take your security project and you may need to train staff or hire exper-
tise, which should be reﬂected in your project budget.

Chapter 9 • Corporate IT Security Project Plan

Operating System Skills
You should have at least one person on staff with deep operating system
expertise for each operating system deployed in your organization. If
you’re running Windows, Linux, and Apple, you ideally should have
experts in each of those areas who are well-versed in securing each of
those operating systems.Your expert(s) should have a detailed under-
standing of the operating system’s subsystems, with special emphasis on
the security subsystems. Operating system fundamentals change slowly, so
this is one area where in-depth study will pay off.This is also an area
where you should have good bench strength.
Create a list of all of the operating systems deployed in your organiza-
tion, and make sure you have one or more experts on staff that can assist
in developing, implementing, and maintaining your corporate IT security
plan. Excellent training in these areas is widely available and a good
investment to ensure that staff skills in this area are up-to-date.
Network Skills
As an IT Manager or IT Security Project Manager, you probably recall
the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model in name only. However,
if your job is to secure the network, the OSI model should be perma-
nently etched in your brain. Understanding what goes on in the network
at Layer 2 and 3 is critical to security, because that’s where most of the
routing, switching, and security controls operate.Another network skill
you should have on your IT staff is Internet Protocol (IP) expertise,
people who can count and add in hexadecimal format in their sleep.They
should be familiar with subnetting, supernetting, IPv4, IPv6, IP telephony
(VoIP), and all of the other ways the IP is implemented, used, and conﬁg-
ured in the enterprise.
Part of your corporate IT security project plan should include a list of
the network skills needed based on the type of systems you have in place
and what you’re planning to implement in the near future.

Application Skills
Staying up-to-date on application skills can be a challenge, because unlike
operating system or networking data, applications rarely stay the same
from version to version.The core application doesn’t change much, but
enterprise-wide applications are typically complex programs and when
something changes in one area, it ripples through the application at light-
ening speed.This creates a security challenge, because on one hand, you
don’t know exactly how the latest updates impact the application and its
security (i.e., did the developers do a good job testing security on this
latest release?) and you also don’t know exactly how the application
changes might impact your business operations and security (i.e., how
well-versed you are in the latest nuances of the application and how it
impacts your system security).
The application skills your organization requires are database skills and
Web application skills. If you don’t have these skills internally, you should
add them to your requirement list so that the next time you hire
someone, you will hire them with these skills in mind. Database and
Web-related security are two areas that hackers like to attack, so be sure
you have the requisite skills in this area.
Identify the applications in your organization and check to see if you
have the necessary skills. If not, seek out vendor training so that you can
adequately secure your company’s applications.
Security Tools Skills
Depending on the scope of your corporate IT security project plan, you
may or may not need to delve into the detailed world of speciﬁc security
tools. In later chapters, we take a look at various security tools. Some are
simple scripting tools and others are hardware devices. Depending on
your project plans, you may purchase these tools and train staff to use
them, or hire external contractors who have the tools and the expertise.
The decision will primarily hinge on the potential payback on the invest-
ment. If you’re going to need these tools on a regular basis, it makes sense
to make the investment in the tools and training. If a tool will only be
www.syngress.com
234
Chapter 9 • Corporate IT Security Project Plan

used occasionally, it might make sense to hire a contractor, who can bear
the time and expense of staying up-to-date.You can hire their expertise
for less than it would cost you to develop that expertise in-house.
There are many training methods available including online courses,
workshops, and boot camps that train staff how to use security tools. One
thing to consider, though, is that not all courses teach participants to
think like hackers, and using the security tools without the mindset of an
attacker will likely yield less than optimal results.
Programming Skills—Compiled Languages
In order to perform security testing, you should have programmers on
staff that are conversant in various compiled languages. Is it absolutely
necessary? No, but it’s often helpful to create automated testing proce-
dures and to understand how to read source code and see what’s going
on beneath the covers. C and C++, C#, and Java are the primary lan-
guages in use, although there are others. C, C++, and C# are not the
same languages. Both C++ and C# are object-oriented languages; C is
not. However, all share similar syntax and semantics. C# is a relatively
new variation and is used primarily in Web applications and Web ser-
vices. Java is also an object-oriented language, developed by Sun
Microsystems, and is used across a wide variety of platforms and devices.
Determine what security projects you’re going to undertake and
whether you’ll need these programming language skills in-house. In some
cases, you may want to hire the programming expertise you need from an
employment agency, but be careful about what you provide to the con-
tractor.You could be hiring the guy who opens the back door on your
system.
Programming Skills—Scripting Languages
Scripting languages (also called interpreted languages) are often used for a
variety of administrative tasks, so chances are your IT staff has a variety of
scripting skills.Take a full inventory of all scripting skills in your depart-
ment.This will not only help you match skills to need, but it might also
prompt a few creative ideas for how to approach various security tasks.
www.syngress.com
Corporate IT Security Project Plan • Chapter 9
235

The most commonly used scripting languages these days are Microsoft’s
Visual Basic Scripting Edition (VBScript), JavaScript, Python, and Perl.
VBScript is typically used to automate various administrative tasks, espe-
cially in the Windows environment. It’s also widely used on the client
side of Web services. JavaScript is also used in client side code on Web
sites. VBScript is speciﬁc to Microsoft and JavaScript works across the
Microsoft, Unix, and Linux platforms. Python is also an object-oriented
scripting language that is used extensively in the Google search engine.
Python runs on Windows, Linux/Unix, Mac OS X, OS/2,Amiga, Palm
Handhelds, and Nokia mobile phones. Python has also been ported to
the Java and .NET virtual machines. Python is distributed under an OSI-
approved open source license that makes it free to use, even for commer-
cial products. Python is slowly replacing Perl, though there are still many
Perl scripts running in the world.
Key Personnel Needed
Once you’ve identiﬁed the scope of your project and the skills needed to
successfully complete your corporate IT security project plan, you can
start mapping the speciﬁc people to their skills. For example:
■
Communication - Jesse (IT), MaryAnn (HR)
■
Training - Lisa (IT), Fernando (IT), Sonali (Training)
■
Policy development - Bill (IT), Marcos (HR)
■
Technical and non-technical writing - Lisa (IT), Sonali
(Training), Ming (HR)
■
User requirement development - Luisa (Business analyst),
Ming (HR)
■
Financial (to create the budget) - Deepak (Finance), Lisa (IT)
■
Legal (to advise on various aspects of your project) -
Larry (Legal)
■
Human Resources (to help develop user guidelines) - Nels
(HR), Ming (HR), Fernando (IT)
www.syngress.com
236
Chapter 9 • Corporate IT Security Project Plan

You can see from this list that there are two names that appear mul-
tiple times—Lisa from the IT department and Ming from HR.Are you
sure that Lisa and Ming will be available? Can Fernando cover for Lisa in
any of these areas? As you develop your list of needed personnel, also
create a viable list of alternates. If these people are not available and are
truly needed, your project will be delayed.
Notice we didn’t list any of the technical skills or technical personnel
needed. It’s assumed you’ll do this in each of your ISAPs and roll it up
into your corporate IT security plan. However, you may need or want to
include additional skills and personnel to your corporate IT security plan,
if you want to provide a higher level skill set to the mix (e.g., an outside
security consultant to review your overall plan or someone with a systems
integration testing background who normally works in a different depart-
ment or division).
Project Processes and Procedures
The overarching question is this: What processes and procedures do you
need to implement to manage your corporate IT security project plan?
The answer lies in your approach to your corporate IT security plan. For
example, if you choose to break your corporate IT security project plan
down into the underlying ISAPs, how will you manage the timing,
resource allocation, reporting, and scheduling of these projects? How will
you manage resource conﬂicts? How will you know if you’re over budget
or behind schedule?
The key to developing your project’s processes and procedures is to
look at what you’ve deﬁned thus far. What does your scope look like?
How are you organizing this project? Next, you’ll need to ﬁnd your stan-
dard project processes and procedures and review them.Are they appro-
priate to this project? Do they contribute to or compromise overall
security? For instance, for some projects, you may want people to collab-
orate on particular sections of the project, but in a security project, you
may want people to work independently so they can test each other’s
solutions. Having one person develop the solution and another devise the
test of that solution can sometimes yield better results.
www.syngress.com
Corporate IT Security Project Plan • Chapter 9
237

As part of the organizational security ISAP, we’ll discuss both organi-
zational security policies and procedures and emergency response policies
and procedures, so we won’t cover them here (see Chapter 13).The pro-
cesses, policies, and procedures we focus on in this section are those
needed to effectively plan, implement, monitor, and manage your enter-
prise-wide IT security plan.
In addition, you may want to implement additional procedures related
to security projects including:
■
Require that IT staff create special user accounts for testing so
that employees who have been given permission to test security
can be recognized and monitored on the system.These accounts
can later be deactivated or used only in cases of security testing.
This can help separate out legitimate testing from insider
hacking.
■
Develop speciﬁc procedures for testing security and for recov-
ering from any unintended consequences of that testing.
Sometimes pen testing (or other security testing) breaks some-
thing in ways you couldn’t foresee. Having speciﬁc recovery pro-
cedures in place will help mitigate project risk.
■
Develop procedures to prioritize security breaches found during
testing.
■
Develop procedures for notifying key staff of serious security
holes found and the appropriate measures to take.The last thing
you want is for one of your staff to ﬁnd a signiﬁcant security hole
and be told, in essence,“That task isn’t scheduled for another
month. Remind us later.”Your security procedures should include
escalation and notiﬁcation procedures for serious security issues
uncovered during the security project.
■
Create policies and procedures for emergency response teams in
the event of a real security breach.
www.syngress.com
238
Chapter 9 • Corporate IT Security Project Plan

■
Develop policies regarding how IT staff handles the sensitive
information discovered during security assessments and audits.
Remember, discovery of security holes can lead to legal liability
if reasonable measures are not taken to address those shortcom-
ings.
■
Develop policies detailing how and when to perform complete
backups and how to restore systems.Always perform complete
backups of critical systems before performing any audit or test
activities.Also ensure that backups are tested with sample restores
prior to auditing activities.
There may be many other security-related policies and procedures
you want to employ in order to successfully plan, implement, and run
your corporate IT security project plan, but this will get you started
thinking along the lines of things that are speciﬁc to security projects.
Project Work Breakdown Structure
Recall that your work breakdown structure (WBS) is created from your
project objectives.Typically, you’ll have three to ﬁve high-level objectives
to start with. In the case of your corporate IT security plan, you’ll prob-
ably end up incorporating sub-plans (ISAPs) into the master plan.To that
end, you may not decide to list out each of the ISAPs for your project,
but instead include those as one high-level objective. Let’s look at a few
examples of how you can deﬁne your corporate IT security plan.
Remember that if you don’t already have your core project team working
with you on deﬁning your project, there’s no time like the present to get
them involved. If you deﬁne your WBS without key stakeholder and sub-
ject matter expertise input, you’ll have a lot of rework on your hands
later on.
WBS Example 1
1. Develop enterprise security strategy
2. Perform enterprise-wide security audit
www.syngress.com
Corporate IT Security Project Plan • Chapter 9
239

3. Implement individual security area plans based on audit results
3.1Develop and implement the Infrastructure Security Plan
3.2Develop and implement the Web and Internet Security Plan
3.3Develop and implement the Communication Security Plan
3.4Develop and implement the Wireless Security Plan
3.5Develop and implement the Cryptography Security Plan
3.6Develop and implement the Operational Security Plan
4. Perform cross-functional security review
5. Develop ongoing security maintenance procedures
In this example, developing the security strategy is the ﬁrst major
objective of your corporate IT security project plan. Some might argue
that this step should be completed prior to developing your corporate IT
security project plan, but if rolling it into your project planning process is
helpful, there’s no harm in doing so as long as it’s completed before
moving into the development of the remaining four high-level objectives
(which translate into your top-level tasks in your WBS). Notice that Task
3 is a high-level placeholder for ISAPs. Several are listed underneath Task
3 for illustrative purposes only. One quick reminder is that best practices
dictate that task names use a verb and a noun format so they are some-
what descriptive. Let’s look at another corporate IT security WBS you
might use as a starting point.
Work Breakdown Structure Example 2
1. Develop RFP to hire an outside security consultant for an enter-
prise-wide security audit
1.1 Deﬁne RFP parameters
1.2 Develop a list of companies from whom to solicit RFP
responses
1.3 Issue a RFP
www.syngress.com
240
Chapter 9 • Corporate IT Security Project Plan

1.4 Evaluate RFP responses
1.5 Hire an outside consultant
2. Perform enterprise-wide security audit
3. Implement security recommendations based on audit results
3.1 Develop ISAPs
3.1.1 Develop and implement Infrastructure Security Plan
3.1.2 Develop and implement Wireless Security Plan
3.1.3 Develop and implement Operational Security Plan
3.2 Implement, monitor, and manage deﬁned ISAPs
4. Develop ongoing security maintenance procedures
In this example, you’ve decided to hire an outside consultant to per-
form a security audit. From those results, you will develop your individual
security plans to address the speciﬁc areas or vulnerabilities identiﬁed by
the consultant.You may develop those plans with or without the consul-
tant, and you may decide to implement and manage those projects with
or without the consultant.Those are choices you can make as you move
through the process based on the unique characteristics of your organiza-
tion, your IT staff’s capabilities, and your relationship with the consultant.
However, regardless of who does the work, you are the project manager
and should actively manage the process. In most cases, it is not advisable
to hand off responsibility for the project to an outside consultant, unless
you are explicitly hiring them to come in, assess your security needs,
develop the security project plan, and implement the resulting plan.There
are some instances when that might be advisable, but as a general rule,
you should maintain control of the project, because you’ll be held
accountable for the results when it’s all said and done.
As part of your WBS, you’ll want to include the speciﬁc security areas
you plan on addressing.You may have to circle back through your plan-
ning process to add detail once your security assessment or audit is com-
pleted. If the assessment or audit is conducted prior to planning your
www.syngress.com
Corporate IT Security Project Plan • Chapter 9
241

corporate IT security project, you most likely will have adequate detail to
specify the ISAPs at the outset of your planning phase.There are
numerous security areas to be considered that should be delineated as part
of your assessment process. However, to give you a jump start, we’ve
included a list developed by the International Engineering Consortium
(IEC) that delineates many of the major areas to be addressed in a com-
prehensive security project plan.Table 9.1 provides a list to help you to
start thinking about what your network includes, what your security
assessment should review, and what ISAPs you may need to deﬁne.
Remember, smaller projects are more successful, so if you need or
want to undertake many (or all) of the items listed in Table 9.1, you
should create separate ISAPs for them and roll them up into your corpo-
rate IT security project plan.At that point, the corporate IT security pro-
ject plan becomes more of a “program” than a project, because it is the
roll up of a number of related initiatives.This distinction is important,
because looking at the corporate IT security project as a program allows
you to allocate resources (time, money, expertise) across your IT security
projects in a thoughtful and predictable manner, rather than running wild
through one enormous project plan that is difﬁcult (impossible) to effec-
tively manage.

Once you’ve developed your high-level (and perhaps mid-level) WBS
tasks, you can continue developing additional underlying detail as you
would any WBS development process. Don’t worry about deﬁning the
tasks in the correct order.The order in which tasks should be done will
be determined later when you’re creating your project schedule.The tasks
will be undertaken based on dependencies, constraints, and available
resources, so spending a lot of time ordering tasks at this point is usually
unproductive.That said, there is usually a linear order in which we think
about tasks; if keeping them in some semblance of order helps ensure you
don’t overlook any major or minor tasks, that’s ﬁne. Numbering the tasks
at this point will help you keep track of them. If desired, you can re-
www.syngress.com
244
Chapter 9 • Corporate IT Security Project Plan

number your tasks when you believe you have your ﬁnal WBS, but don’t
expect numbers tasks to be performed sequentially once your project gets
underway.
Project Risks
Identifying risks to the corporate IT security project plan is ideally a
team effort. Everyone comes to a project with a distinct set of skills and a
unique perspective.These are valuable assets in your risk identiﬁcation,
evaluation, and mitigation planning process.The objective of this phase of
project planning is to identify all the things that could go wrong with
your project and come up with speciﬁc plans for avoiding or reducing
those risks.
There are three basic ways to deal with any risk.You can mitigate,
avoid, or transfer. Let’s look at a quick example to help illustrate these dif-
ferentiations so you know how to approach project risk management.
■
Mitigation If there is a ﬁre danger, you buy ﬁre sprinklers to
reduce your risk of ﬁre.
■
Avoidance If there is a ﬁre danger, you remove ﬂammables
from the area to avoid the risk.
■
Transference If there is a ﬁre danger, you buy ﬁre insurance to
make the risk someone else’s.
Eight distinct steps should be taken in your risk management planning
phase:
1. Identify the risk.
2. Rank the likelihood of the risk occurring.
3. Rank the severity of the impact should the risk occur.
4. Create a prioritized list of risks you will plan for and manage.
5. Develop mitigation strategies to avoid or reduce the impact of
the risk.
www.syngress.com
Corporate IT Security Project Plan • Chapter 9
245

6. Develop speciﬁc triggers for the risk mitigation (or alternative)
strategy.
7. Analyze the potential impact of implementing the alternate
strategy.
8. Identify any direct, indirect, and unintentional consequences of
implementing the alternative strategy.
Not all risks are worth planning for, because they are either unlikely
to occur or because the impact if they do occur is negligible.An asteroid
hitting Earth would have a huge impact, but it’s not worth planning for
because the likelihood of that occurring is so small. But what about
something less dramatic, such as your company’s acquisition of another
company? How likely is that to occur and how would it impact your
corporate IT security project plan? In your case the answer might be that
it is highly likely to occur and would have a major impact. What about a
dramatic downturn in sales? How likely is that to occur in your business,
industry or sector? If that were to occur, how would that impact your
corporate IT security plan? You might decide that it’s highly unlikely to
occur, but it would have a major impact on your plan (because your IT
budget would be slashed accordingly). What about the introduction of a
new security technology? Would that impact your corporate IT security
plan? It might if your security strategy involves staying on the leading
edge of security and technology. How likely is that to occur? It depends
largely on what technology you’re talking about, but let’s assume for this
example that it’s not very likely to occur but would have a huge impact if
it did occur.
These are all high-level risks that may be appropriate because we’re
focusing on the corporate IT security plan, not the ISAPs. However,
there may be additional risks you and your team identify that you want
to address.This is where an all-out brainstorming session can be very
helpful. Have everyone identify absolutely every risk you can think of,
whether they’re realistic, outlandish, or highly unlikely to occur.Then
have the team rank each potential risk twice (independently)—once for
likelihood of occurrence and once for severity of occurrence. Place the
www.syngress.com
246
Chapter 9 • Corporate IT Security Project Plan

list in prioritized order and review it. Sometimes a purely mathematical
ordering of a risk’s likelihood and severity doesn’t address contextual
issues very well; a bit of human intelligence can go a long way in devel-
oping your ﬁnal list. Once you’ve accomplished this, decide how far
down the list you’re willing to plan. Develop risk mitigation strategies
(covered that in detail in Chapter 6) appropriate to the plan and incorpo-
rate them into your project.
Project Constraints
As you know, every project has constraints that you must deal with. It’s
one of the major responsibilities of the IT project manager, and is what
makes the job both challenging and interesting.Your corporate IT secu-
rity project plan will undoubtedly have time, budget, and resource con-
straints you’ll have to deal with. In addition, you will likely have legal or
regulatory constraints that come into play.These need to be identiﬁed at
the outset of your project.
In addition, you need to look at your project’s scope, budget, schedule,
and quality requirements and rank them from highest to lowest priority.
Put another way, you need to understand which parameters are locked in
and which are ﬂexible. It’s nearly impossible to demand that scope, time,
budget, and quality all be etched in stone from the outset of the project,
so you’re better off deﬁning which parameters can change and which
cannot.
In the case of corporate IT security, you may ﬁnd that your con-
straints are a compilation of the underlying ISAP plans, or you may ﬁnd
that your high-level constraints drive your ISAP constraints.There is no
one right way to approach this, but it is important that you address it
early and get project sponsor agreement as to project priorities. If you’re
operating under the assumption that budget is the top priority and your
project sponsor believes you’re working to come in on schedule knowing
the budget may expand a bit, you have a potentially serious disconnect.
Deﬁne these at the top level for your corporate IT security project based
on your stated security strategy and alignment with corporate objectives.
www.syngress.com
Corporate IT Security Project Plan • Chapter 9
247

This should give you a bit more ﬂexibility in deﬁning your constraints at
the corporate IT security plan level and provide guidance as to how to
proceed with the ISAPs.
Project Assumptions
In order to undertake any project, you have to make a few assumptions
such as that funding will be available or that resources will be released to
you.The key here is to identify the assumptions you are making so that
you can address them directly. If your corporate IT security project plan
assumes the existence of an overarching security strategy, say so. If the
strategy doesn’t yet exist, then that assumption means you have some
foundational work to do before you can implement your corporate IT
security project plan. If you assume that your IT budget will remain a ﬂat
5 percent of corporate revenue next year, state what dollar amount you
believe that to be. When you list your assumptions, two things happen.
First, you deﬁne what you’re counting on as being true. Second, you’re
forced to look clearly at your project and think through what it is you are
assuming.That’s not always an easy process, because our assumptions
sometimes are so fundamental that we can’t see them clearly.Again,
having your project team work with you on this will help avoid blind
spots and make sure you clearly list the assumptions upon which this pro-
ject is built.
Project Schedule and Budget
In terms of developing your corporate IT security project schedule and
budget, there is one important note. If you approach it as you do any
other IT project, you’ll develop your schedule based on the logical order
in which tasks should be performed, including the dependencies and the
constraints.Your budget will be based on the calculated cost of each of
the tasks and sub-tasks deﬁned in the plan. However, there is one element
to the corporate IT security planning process that is unique with regard
to schedule and budget.You may choose to take a top-down or a
bottom-up approach to your plan development.That is, you may choose
www.syngress.com
248
Chapter 9 • Corporate IT Security Project Plan

to develop the various ISAPs and pull them altogether (with additional
tasks that glue the corporate IT security project together and ensure a
holistic approach) to create your project plan.This bottom-up approach
means that your schedule and budget will also be built from the bottom
up.Your schedule will look something like that shown in Figure 9.2,
where your corporate plan is roughly the sum of the underlying ISAPs
(there may be additional schedule and budget components for those
“glue” tasks). In Figure 9.2, those “glue” tasks are shown as having no
dependencies and 100 percent ﬂoat, which is probably not how they’d be
included in your project plan.They are shown in this manner to indicate
there are tasks that are needed to tie these ISAPs together, such as a full
systems test after all the ISAPs are complete or a complete review of all
policies related to the ISAPs.The intent of the diagram is to show that
the ISAPs roll up and essentially deﬁne the corporate IT security project
schedule and budget.
Notice that in Figure 9.2, there is overlap of some of the ISAPs.This
might occur if you have enough IT staff time, resources, and expertise to
undertake projects in parallel (e.g., you might use completely different
staff to implement your Web and Internet security plan versus your wire-
less security plan). Based on other projects and workload, you determine
if you can run these projects almost in parallel and that the ﬁrst of those
two can start when the communication security project is about 50 per-
cent complete.Therefore, your total duration for your project is not the
sum of the duration for each ISAP, but rather the total duration for all
ISAPs to be completed.
www.syngress.com
Corporate IT Security Project Plan • Chapter 9
249

Figure 9.2 Bottom-up Schedule and Budget Development
Alternately, you can deﬁne your schedule and your budget from the
top-down, as shown in Figure 9.3. In this case, your total budget and
schedule are deﬁned and each ISAP underneath (as well as any “glue”
tasks) are parsed out of the total. In this example, the total schedule
allotted for your corporate IT security project plan is 18 months and
your budget is $250,000.All of the ISAPs underneath are allocated a per-
centage or portion of the total.This may mean you have to scale time
and budgets for the ISAPs down in order to meet your schedule and
budget requirements, but you’d have to do that with either the approach
anyway, since we’re assuming you don’t have unlimited time and unlim-
ited funds to accomplish your goals.

Figure 9.3 Top-down Schedule and Budget Development
As with the bottom-up approach, some of your ISAPs may run in
parallel or may begin before another project is complete. In the example
shown in Figure 9.3, the wireless security plan begins when the Web and
Internet project is about 50 percent complete, but that project can’t com-
mence until the communication plan is complete.
These examples are two ways you can incorporate your ISAPs into
your corporate IT project plan and come up with a fairly accurate initial
estimate for schedule and budget. It will have to be revised a number of
times based on additional detail that is developed through the project

Project Estimating: Part Science, Part Art
Project estimating—whether for scope, budget or schedule—is part sci-
ence and part art. The science involves taking a consistent and method-
ical approach toward deﬁning your tasks. The more detailed your WBS,
the easier it becomes to deﬁne a unit of work (task) that can be clearly
deﬁned in terms of duration, effort, and cost. At the outset of project
planning, you don’t have that level of detail, but are often required to
drawn a line in the sand and commit to the maximum cost and time the
project will take. Dangerous waters, to be sure, but something we have
to do almost daily. The process of deﬁning the project schedule and cost
can be termed progressive elaboration where you progressively gather
more detail as you move through your project planning phases. The art
form comes from understanding how to generate that initial estimate,
how to manage expectations, and how to estimate various unknowns.
As you become more experienced in project management and esti-
mating, you should ﬁnd that your estimates are closer to reality than ﬁc-
tion. That’s the ﬁne art of estimating.
Managing the Project
We’re assuming that your corporate IT security project is a series of
ISAPs and that you will manage them accordingly.You will have the
additional burden of balancing conﬂicting demands for resources and
addressing the impact of one ISAP on another.There is no cookie cutter
approach that will work in all circumstances. Program management is
outside the scope of this book, but sufﬁce it to say that it will test your
skills as a project manager.
Closing Out the Project
Any project close out includes standard steps (see Chapter 8), but closing
out the corporate IT security project plan also includes a number of ele-
www.syngress.com
252

ments unique to this type of project. It’s entirely possible that you want to
perform another security test or audit once all work is completed before
ofﬁcially closing out the project.This is one last check before you close
the books on this project, and hand off the management of security for
day-to-day management by your IT staff.Along the way, you should have
developed processes and procedures for maintaining security on an
ongoing basis; developed user training and guidelines, and developed an
updated set of documentation for your IT staff to review, modify, and
update on an ongoing basis.
There may be particular tasks or duties that need to transition out of
the project mode and into the maintenance mode. Ongoing operations
should support, sustain, or even improve the security set through the pro-
ject activities. Documents, processes, and procedures should be reviewed
and ﬁnalized for the operational team.
As with other important projects, your high-level corporate IT secu-
rity project plan may also require a large presentation to executives or
other key staff. Don’t miss this chance to tout your team’s efforts and pro-
ject results. Highlight the positive, calmly explain the negative, and if nec-
essary, explain what you’ve learned and how it will beneﬁt the company
in the future.

Summary
We’ve covered a tremendous amount of territory in this chapter, with the
intent of helping you deﬁne your corporate IT security project plan
based on the speciﬁc needs of your organization.Your corporate IT secu-
rity plan should start with a well-deﬁned enterprise-wide security
strategy.This is the glue that binds all of your security activities together
and provides the rationale for all IT security activities. Ideally, this is
developed prior to trying to plan your corporate IT security plan, but in
some cases, it might make sense to list it as the ﬁrst major objective in
your plan.
We took a look at various legal standards related to your corporate IT
security plan, because in this day and age, security has become a legal
issue. While this chapter won’t make you an attorney, it should have pro-
vided enough of an overview to help you understand the larger legal
environment. Of course, you should consult your ﬁrm’s legal counsel for
additional information on the potential legal implications of security in
your particular company.
The bulk of this chapter walked you through the standard project
management steps with an eye toward corporate IT security project plan-
ning. While the generally accepted project management methods apply in
this case, there are areas speciﬁc to corporate IT security planning that we
called out along the way.These are typically high-level issues that should
be addressed in a top-level project plan. We also noted areas where the
corporate IT project plan provides the mortar or glue for the ISAPs. Each
individual plan should be complete unto itself, but there are necessary
connections between and among the ISAPs required to implement a
comprehensive, holistic IT security solution for your company.
At the end of all of this, you should have a fairly clear view into how
to approach your unique corporate IT security project plan. Every com-
pany and every IT security solution has standard components as well as
very distinct organizational requirements.Your challenge is to apply stan-
dardize methodologies while addressing the aspects unique to your com-

pany and your IT environment.This chapter provided the foundation
upon which to build your corporate IT security project plan.

Deﬁning Your Security Strategy
 Your IT security strategy should be aligned with the business
objectives of your organization.
 IT security strategies developed without aligning with business
objectives are far less likely to beneﬁt from executive support or
to receive needed funding.
 The ﬁve key success factors for an IT security strategy are: 1) The
skills, capabilities, and efforts of the entire organization must be
utilized and mobilized, 2) Key functions and processes in the
organization must collaborate on shared security goals and
strategy, 3) The organization’s security objectives or an
articulation of its “desired state” must be developed and
understood, 4) Critical assets that are essential to achieving the
organization’s mission must be identiﬁed and protected, and 5) IT
operations and support must enable security goals.
 Your corporate IT security plans also have to align with the
reality of your organization.You must live within the company’s
constraints, which may include budget, schedule, stafﬁng, or other
overarching organizational limitations.
Legal Standards Relevant to Corporate IT Security
 There are numerous federal laws that impact corporate IT
security. Some of the more well-known ones include: GLBA,
HIPAA, SOX, FISMA, FERPA,TEACH, ECPA, and CFAA.
www.syngress.com
Corporate IT Security Project Plan • Chapter 9

 There are numerous state laws that pertain to corporate IT
security that you should be familiar with, especially with regard
to all states in which your company has a physical presence.
 There are three key fallacies that can trap corporate and IT staff
when planning for IT security:The “Single Law” fallacy, the
“Private Entity” fallacy, and the “Penetration Test Only” fallacy.
 There are a number of things you can do to reduce your
company’s legal liability including: Understand your legal
environment, perform comprehensive and ongoing security
assessments, evaluations, and implementations, use contracts to
deﬁne rights and protect information, and use qualiﬁed third-
party professionals.
 Nothing in this chapter or book should be construed as legal
information or advice.You should consult with a qualiﬁed legal
professional to assess your ﬁrm’s speciﬁc legal liabilities and to
develop optimal legal risk mitigation strategies.
Corporate IT Security Project Plan Overview
 Your corporate IT security project should be based on your
overall security strategy for the organization.
 As with any project, you should deﬁne the problem you’re trying
to solve so your project solves the right problem.
 An integral part of the problem deﬁnition in IT security is the
security assessment or audit.
 You may choose to perform the assessment as a separate project
or as the ﬁrst major task in your corporate IT security project
plan.
 The remaining steps mirror standard project management steps:
Deﬁne the desired (required) outcome(s), identify potential
solutions, deﬁne project constraints, deﬁne project requirements,
select optimal solution, deﬁne project team, deﬁne project

procedures, deﬁne project WBS, tasks, owners, resources, budget
and schedule, monitor and manage project, and hand off and
close out project.
Corporate Security Auditing
 Security assessments and auditing are a natural ﬁrst step for any
IT security project.Your corporate IT security project may have
such an assessment as the ﬁrst major objective or you may
develop your plan based on the outcome of a separate security
assessment project.
 Security fails for a variety of reasons, the primary reasons being:
Improper conﬁguration, failure to update, faulty requirements,
human factors, policy issues, and incorrect assumptions.
Corporate Security Project Parameters
 Your corporate IT security plan should start with deﬁning the
key objectives.
 Every project includes four parameters that must be balanced:
scope, cost (budget), time (schedule), and quality.
 There are numerous skills needed for each IT security project.
These generally can be organized into these categories: Operating
system skills, network skills, application skills, security tools skills,
programming skills, compiled languages and programming skills,
and scripting languages.
 As part of the initial project deﬁnition, you will also need to
identify the key personnel needed.
 Deﬁning project processes and procedures is an important part of
any IT project, but in the corporate IT security project plan, you
need to deﬁne enterprise-wide processes to address the unique
characteristics of this type of plan.

Project WBS
 Creating a WBS for your corporate IT security project may
involve developing high-level tasks that include development of
ISAPs as single task, or you may develop a WBS that pulls of the
ISAPs in as separate project plans.
 There are numerous areas that must be addressed in the corporate
IT security project plan including people, process, and
technology.
 The WBS should include all subtasks and should be an iterative
process to produce ever expanding levels of detail.
Project Risks
 Deﬁning project risks and mitigation strategies is a fairly standard
process, but at the corporate IT security project level, there are
organizational issues that must be addressed.
 One risk unique to the corporate IT security strategy that you
might not ﬁnd in other types of IT projects is the legal risk.
Project Constraints
 If your corporate IT security project plan is well-aligned to your
current business strategies, you should be able to identify your
project constraints in a manner consistent with organizational
goals.
 Understanding at a corporate level how scope, budget, schedule,
and quality all come into play and what the priorities should be
for both the corporate IT security project plan and the ISAPs,
will help you manage the program (collection of related projects).

Chapter 9 • Corporate IT Security Project Plan

Project Assumptions
 Many of your project assumptions will be related to the
underlying ISAPs, but they can also be captured in the corporate
IT security project plan.
 Your high-level assumptions about your business environment are
assumptions that should be captured in your plan.These may
include assumptions about your overall level of funding in the
coming year, planned acquisitions or divestitures, and so on.
Project Schedule and Budget
 When creating your corporate IT security project plan, your
initial schedule and budget estimates can be developed using a
bottom-up or top-down approach.
 A bottom-up approach allows you to create your best estimates
for the underlying ISAPs, add some factor for the corporate IT
security project-speciﬁc activities, and develop a top-level project
schedule and budget.
 A top-down approach allows you to determine the total time and
budget for all corporate IT security projects, and allocate time
and dollars as percentages of the whole.This might be desirable if
you have very speciﬁc deadlines and budgetary targets you’re
trying to meet.
 Running the corporate IT security project is like managing a
program because you’ll have to deal with potentially conﬂicting
needs of the various ISAPs as well as corporate constraints.
 Closing out the project should include transitioning needed
ongoing security activities to the daily operational staff.
Documentation should be reviewed, revised, and ﬁnalized to
provide the procedures, policies, and documentation needed to
support, sustain, and improve security in the future.

Introduction
In this chapter, we provide the framework for creating a general
Information Technology (IT) security project as part of your overall cor-
porate IT security project plan strategy.As with all of the individual secu-
rity area projects (ISAPs) discussed in this book, this is intended to be a
template to use as a starting point.You might be wondering what a “gen-
eral” IT security project plan consists of. In this chapter, we’ll discuss the
security assessment and auditing function in great detail. Most corporate
IT security plans start with a thorough assessment so that the problem
statement can be developed.As discussed in Chapter 9, you might per-
form your assessment as one of the major objectives of your corporate
project, or you might implement the assessment as a separate project
whose results feed into your corporate IT security project plan. Either
way, your planning begins with an assessment, which is covered in detail
here. We also look at access control, authentication, and attacks, and how
to build a project plan that addresses these core areas.
IT Security Assessment and Auditing
For the purposes of this chapter, let’s deﬁne assessment as the act of
testing network security to determine the strength of current security
measures. Furthermore, let’s deﬁne auditing as the act of examining,
recording, and evaluating security conﬁgurations. Clearly these two activi-
ties should work in tandem. If all you do is run some tests against your
network, you’ve performed an assessment that might yield important
information. However, if your test misses some critical area, you’re still
vulnerable. If you perform an audit, you might see that your server con-
ﬁguration is air-tight.Again, you might miss a vulnerability caused by the
interaction of security in one network system (e.g., servers) and another
network system (e.g., ﬁrewalls or routers).These two activities are, in a
sense, two sides of the same coin and together they provide as complete a
picture of your network security as possible. Let’s begin by talking about
assessments.

Chapter 10 • General IT Security Plan

People are always the weakest link in security.Take the recent cases of
hackers getting into corporate credit card databases. In many of these
recent stories, someone on the inside of the organization made a poor
decision (whether malicious or not) about how to handle the data,
resulting in a vulnerability that was exploited by an outsider. Social engi-
neering, lack of awareness of security best practices, and malicious intent
are ranked very high on the list of vulnerabilities from the people per-
spective.Assessing your vulnerabilities from a people perspective should
include these methods.
Processes are the security processes maintained by the company from
top to bottom. Vulnerabilities occur because IT security processes, such as
analyzing key network trafﬁc, are poorly deﬁned or poorly executed.
Corporate policies with regard to security processes often fall behind
known threats and fail to address new threats.A good example is having a
policy about reporting new or unexpected equipment found on or near
one’s desk. Since rogue wireless networks are easy to install, if employees
are not vigilant about investigating new or unusual equipment (they often
assume someone from IT put it there), there is a risk. In addition, if IT
policy doesn’t speciﬁcally deﬁne a procedure for installing new equip-
ment, you are losing an opportunity to maintain security. It’s a two-sided
process. IT should deﬁne clear procedures for how things will work, so
that users can be educated as to standard operating procedures. Both
groups can therefore keep an eye out for rogue or unusual activity that
falls outside standard policies and procedures. In addition, processes such
as how employees are removed from access control lists when they leave
the organization, should be part of the assessment to ensure standard pro-
cedures maintain strong security.
Technology vulnerabilities are the most tangible of the three vulnerabil-
ities and are the ones that most people in IT start out looking for. While
these are found in abundance in technical trade magazines and Web sites,
don’t make the mistake of thinking that the most important vulnerabili-
ties are those with the actual technology. While important, they are part
of this triad of people, process and technology that, when addressed holis-
tically, gives your network the highest possible security. In many ways,

assessments, access control, authentication, and auditing address all three
aspects of security.There are technology assessments and risk assessments,
both of which are discussed in this section.
Business Intelligence…
Lingo
For what it’s worth, the National Security Agency (NSA) and the National
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) use slightly different lingo.
They use management (people), operations (process), and technology. In
How to Cheat at IT Project Management and throughout this companion
book, we use the terms people, process, and technology, which are
slightly different but the intent is the same.
We can also look at security through a layered approach. In fact, the
more ways you parse out your environment, the more likely you are to
ﬁnd vulnerabilities. In Figure 10.1, you can see that your ﬁrst line of
defense consists of your policies, procedures, and user awareness.These
form the foundation of all network security, because people and process
are two of the three major components of security.The physical environ-
ment includes physical access to equipment and the general security of
the facility. If a hacker gains legitimate (though unauthorized) access to
someone’s desk and is able to root around amongst all the sticky notes to
ﬁnd a username and password, you essentially have wasted all those thou-
sands (or millions) of dollars on protecting the network from outside
attack. Finally, there are both physical and virtual security elements related
to the perimeter, the internal network, servers and hosts, applications and
databases, and the data itself.The virtual elements include all the ways
someone could access this information from outside the organization,
while the physical elements include the ways someone could physically
access these components.

Chapter 10 • General IT Security Plan

Figure 10.1 Layered Approach to Network Security
Perimeter or Boundaries
First, you should deﬁne your perimeter and determine where your
border areas are. (Some people use the term “perimeter,” and others
prefer the term “boundaries.”) Be clear that the perimeters or boundaries
are either physical or logical.The port of a router is a physical boundary.
A network segment is a physical boundary.The Internet Protocol (IP)
subnet is a logical boundary.The responsibility for securing data from
Point A to Point B is a logical boundary. Next, you should deﬁne the
components that protect your perimeter, which typically include ﬁrewalls,
routers, proxy servers, and Demilitarized Zones (DMZ’s), to mention a
few.After user awareness and adherence to policies and procedures, your
perimeter defense is often your ﬁrst line of defense against external
attacks. Remember, many attacks or security breaches are internal, so an
obsessive ﬁxation with just the perimeter is not going to keep your net-
work safe.

Internal Network
How your network is conﬁgured and segmented is of great interest to
hackers, because once they learn this, they can navigate easily through
your entire internal network. Information regarding the segmentation and
addressing of network segments as well as the presence and conﬁguration
of any network intrusion detection systems (IDS), would also be a real
bonus for a hacker, and would provide a great jump start to many types
of intrusive attacks.
Servers and Hosts
Information about the types, locations, and numbers of servers and hosts
(for our purposes, any non-server network device with an IP address,) is
great information for a hacker.This is an area where a fair amount of
effort is expended to harden the devices against attack. System hardening
includes tasks such as disabling unused protocols and ports, removing
unused applications, implementing access control and authentication
requirements, maintaining up-to-date anti-virus, anti-spyware applica-
tions, maintaining up-to-date operating systems and applications, and per-
forming ongoing and meaningful intrusion detection and auditing
functions.
Applications and Databases
Applications and databases are also common targets for attackers. If a
hacker can gain access to an application, he or she might be able to
modify data, insert data, or steal data.The same holds true for a database
application except that with databases, there is often a wealth of informa-
tion a hacker would really like to get their hands on. In addition, some-
times the objective is to simply corrupt the database to cause ﬁnancial or
political problems for the company.Think of a database used for an online
application in which a hacker changes the product pricing or inserts bad
language into the product description.Think of a database that becomes
corrupted, and mailings regarding the results of Human
Immunodeﬁciency Virus (HIV) testing are mailed to people’s work
www.syngress.com
266
Chapter 10 • General IT Security Plan

addresses instead of home addresses.The list of possibilities is endless, and
part of your assessment should be how the data could be corrupted and
what the potential implications of such a result would be.
Data
Ultimately, hackers want data of all kinds. Sometimes the hacker doesn’t
know exactly what data he or she wants, but they’ll take whatever they
can get their hands on. Sometimes there’s a ripple effect to data acquisi-
tion.A hacker might start with just the name of a technical contact listed
in the WHOIS database for a Uniform Resource Locator (URL). He
then uses that information to call the company and, through social engi-
neering, convince the technical contact to give him the username and
password for the account on the hosting company’s Web site. He or she
then logs on and installs some tracking software. Now, every time a cus-
tomer logs into his or her account on your Web site, the bad guy gets
instant access. Clearly, this is just one type of data a hacker can use, but
you can see how it can ripple down into your organization.
Unfortunately, there is a lot of public information out there on both
publicly and privately owned companies.There is no way to avoid that.
However, a good rule of thumb is to only disclose required information,
and to verify the entity you are disclosing the information to. Let’s look
at some of the kinds of data a hacker might put to use.
Contact Information
As mentioned, various kinds of contact information can be extremely
useful to attackers.They can use it to represent themselves as an employee
or agent of the company, or they can use it to talk to the internal contact
directly, pretending to be a legitimate external representative of a service
provider. Employee names, mailing addresses, e-mail addresses, and phone
numbers are excellent resources for social engineering.
www.syngress.com
General IT Security Plan • Chapter 10
267

Business Information
Who are your company’s business partners? Who are your vendors, sup-
pliers, and contractors? This information is also extremely helpful for an
attacker, because it can be used to impersonate people with legitimate ties
to your company. In addition, if your company is acquiring or divesting
another company or division, it creates security holes that can be
exploited by an attacker who is aware of this activity.
Extranet and Remote Access
While extranets and remote access channels are great tools for employees
and vendors for a variety of purposes, unfortunately they are also magnets
for hackers. Especially vulnerable are accounts used by external business
partners, which typically use weak or default passwords. Unused or for-
gotten modems are another great source of unauthorized remote access.
Valid User Accounts
To a hacker, valid user accounts with passwords are the mother lode, but
even just a valid user account is a great starting point. It provides the
attacker with information about the format of your user accounts and
allows them to quickly ﬁgure out other valid user names based on the con-
tact information provided. Some companies use a different username
format than their e-mail addresses to protect the user login format infor-
mation (e.g., your e-mail address format might be ﬁrst initial_lastname@
yourcompany.com whereas your user login information might be ﬁrst
name_middle initial_ﬁrst four letters of your last name.While it’s a bit more dif-
ﬁcult for users to remember, they’ll quickly get the hang of it. It won’t nec-
essarily prevent a hacker from ﬁguring out your username format, but it
might slow them down a bit. It might also help you to see any attempts at
brute-force attacks, if they follow the format for your e-mail addresses and
not your standard username format.
If an attacker has a valid user account and can ﬁgure out the format,
he or she can then start a brute-force attack to crack the password.Thus,
protecting user account formats is one half of the equation; the other half
is requiring strong passwords.

268
Chapter 10 • General IT Security Plan

System Conﬁguration
System conﬁguration information is also extremely valuable to an
attacker, because he or she can determine what types of attacks to launch.
If someone knows you’re running Microsoft Windows Server 2003, he or
she can speciﬁcally attack vulnerabilities of those systems, including
exploiting systems that have not been kept up-to-date with critical secu-
rity patches.An example of this can be found at www.netcraft.com.
Business Intelligence…
Deterrence Tactics
An alarm on your car doesn’t prevent it from being stolen, it simply
deters the would-be thief. They have to think twice about whether or
not they can boost your car before someone pays attention to the alarm.
Similarly, protecting your corporate data from attacker reconnaissance
missions is not going to increase your security, it will simply help deter
would-be hackers. Putting up barriers wherever you can without
impeding your own business processes (or without unduly impeding
users) reduces the chances that an attacker will select your network as a
target. In the end, your layered security systems are what will protect
you, but why not make it as difﬁcult as possible for a would-be attacker
to get any helpful information?
Types of Security Assessments
There are various types of assessments you can perform on your overall
network security. We’re not going to go into complete detail here,
because these topics are large and ever-changing. However, there are two
major categories worth addressing: vulnerability scanning and pen testing.
www.syngress.com
General IT Security Plan • Chapter 10
269

Vulnerability Scanning
Vulnerability scanning slices both ways.You’re doing it to keep the bad
guys out and the bad guys are doing it to ﬁnd a way in. From the IT
administrator’s perspective, the goal of vulnerability scanning is to identify
devices on the network that are open to known vulnerabilities. Despite
your best efforts, there will always be new vulnerabilities discovered, and
your activities in this area will likely be almost non-stop. However, you
have to begin from a known starting point, and performing vulnerability
scanning begins with addressing the obvious ﬁrst.Also, keep in mind that
vulnerabilities encompass people, processes, and technology, so be sure to
look at all three areas when addressing vulnerabilities. It doesn’t matter
how locked down your systems are if you have a power user lose a laptop
or hand out a password to someone posing as an IT staffer.Also, keep in
mind that penetration (pen) testing is not useful for scanning for vulnera-
bilities if the system hasn’t been secured. Other methods are more pro-
ductive on the front end; pen testing can be more helpful on the back
end after security measures have been implemented.
Enumeration
The most common type of vulnerability scanning is done using software
tools that attempt to enumerate, or list, all of the network components.
Enumeration includes scanning to identify network segments, IP ranges,
IP addresses, network conﬁguration, names, addresses, and version num-
bers for network devices, protocols, ports, versions, users, groups, directo-
ries, patches, updates and any other information about the network.
Enumeration is possible because system vulnerabilities lead to unautho-
rized exposure of important system information and because system capa-
bilities are actually designed to help administrators manage networked
systems, which also helps attackers. When vulnerabilities exist, they allow
for exposure of information that can be exploited by an attacker.

Chapter 10 • General IT Security Plan

Security Mistakes
Most organizations have a lot of data stored in various locations, directo-
ries, and servers across the enterprise.Are you absolutely sure each of
those areas is properly secured? Systems are often conﬁgured to replicate
settings from the top of the hierarchy down through the lower layers of
the directory or ﬁle hierarchy. Did those settings replicate properly? Were
the original settings correct, or were mistakes replicated throughout the
organization as well? These kinds of security mistakes can create huge
security holes; therefore, vulnerability scanning should look for weak
passwords, incorrect user, ﬁle, or folder permissions, default conﬁgura-
tions, and unused features that should be disabled. In addition to errors,
you also need to ascertain whether any settings have been altered or
modiﬁed by a user within your organization. If a user’s permissions were
accidentally misconﬁgured, he or she may have had the ability (even if for
a short time) to increase their permission levels or even create a new user
account for themselves.
Known Vulnerabilities
Known vulnerabilities are the ﬁrst things exploited by attackers, but they’re
also addressed by software makers through patches and updates.While a
vulnerability might become known before a patch is available, often the
patch is available before the attacker ﬁnds your network and your vulnera-
bility. Such was the case in 2003, when the Blaster virus hit many corporate
networks.The patch had been available for about three weeks before the
attack occurred, but many organizations’ computers were not patched; best
estimates place the infection rate at about 500,000 computers. Patching and
updating are important in addressing known vulnerabilities, and since 2003,
most organizations have developed better systems for patch and update
management. Microsoft has new tools available, including the automatic
update feature on desktop systems and the Microsoft Security Baseline
Analyzer tool that allows you to scan for known vulnerabilities from a
Microsoft systems perspective. Some scanning tools look for registry settings
to determine whether or not the system is up-to-date, and more extensive
www.syngress.com
General IT Security Plan • Chapter 10
271

programs attack the system via the known vulnerabilities to see how it
responds.A wide variety of tools are readily available and are usually a good
investment for companies of all sizes. However, remember, these tools are
also available to the bad guys.
Common Attacks
Vulnerability scanning has to look at both sides of the equation.Are
known vulnerabilities addressed? Are known attacks addressed? There are
many known attacks and attack methods that should be addressed in your
security assessment. It’s not enough to cover known vulnerabilities; it’s
possible that if you simulate attacks on your network you may uncover
previously unknown vulnerabilities. Not all vulnerabilities can be patched
or updated. Some vulnerabilities are the result of the interaction of two
or more network components or systems.Therefore, it’s important that
you include common attack scenario testing in your security assessment.
Pen Testing
Pen testing by itself proves nothing. So what if you can penetrate an inse-
cure network? It’s akin to walking in the open front door of a house; it
doesn’t tell you if the locks work. Second, pen testing is by no means
comprehensive. In fact, it is like a laser; it goes directly at a particular
target in a very focused manner. It will give you a result based on a spe-
ciﬁc circumstance, but it won’t give you a broad overview of your net-
work security. If you’re going to use pen testing as a tool, start with the
“low hanging fruit”; in other words, make sure the front door is locked,
and then work your way up from there. Performing pen testing after a
security project is far more useful than doing it beforehand, so be sure
you understand when and why you’d use pen testing in IT security pro-
jects. Be clear about what the results of a pen test will tell you, not what
you assume they’ll tell you.As an assessment tool, pen testing should be
limited in scope (e.g., if you believe some speciﬁc part of your network is
locked down you might perform a pen test on that area to verify your
assumption).

Chapter 10 • General IT Security Plan

Pen testing can be a tricky area, because you essentially have to hack
your own network. So, before you head off to do a pen test, make sure
you have the appropriate sign-off from corporate executives.The last
thing you need is for you or one of your staff to be falsely accused of
attacking the network when, in fact, you were legitimately testing the
security of the network. Having a security testing plan in hand and get-
ting sign off from your project sponsor is the best way to ensure there are
no negative repercussions.Also keep in mind that an inexperienced pen
tester could cause unintended problems ranging from minor to severe.
Think carefully about how and when these tests should be carried out
and by whom. If you retain an outside ﬁrm to perform this type of
testing, be sure they come well-recommended and with the appropriate
credentials and a spotless reputation.Also, make sure that they sign the
appropriate paperwork to shield you and them from liability. Finally, keep
in mind that many companies think that hiring an outside ﬁrm to “just
do the pen testing” is sufﬁcient. What they fail to realize is that per-
forming pen testing absent other security planning and implementation
activities, can actually lay the company wide open for legal liability. If you
are aware of the problem but do not take “reasonable care” in addressing
it, you could be worse off than not knowing about the vulnerability in
the ﬁrst place.
Keep in mind that the ultimate goal of pen testing is to obtain admin-
istrator-level privileges.Therefore, your testing should start from the same
place as an outsider—without a username or password. Pen testing usually
tries to exploit known vulnerabilities ﬁrst, so this is a logical place to
start. Not all vulnerabilities can be addressed, however. Remember, there
is a limit to what you can protect and what you should protect. In
keeping the balance between security and cost and security and reason-
able business operations, you will probably ﬁnd yourself making conscious
trade-offs between security and other business objectives.Therefore, you
may have to be creative and ﬁnd alternate ways to address vulnerabilities
besides simply closing and locking the door on them.

There are various methodologies you can use to perform a pen test.
Here’s one to get you started:
1. Think like the attacker. Determine how the attacker would most
likely try to attack your network.This normally begins by
locating all publicly available information on the target and using
that information as a starting point.
2. Locate vulnerabilities and areas of weakness. Use the elements in
Figure 10.1 to ensure you’re looking across the entire enterprise.
3. Determine all the ways (currently known) a hacker could exploit
the vulnerabilities and weaknesses found in Step 2.
4. Determine which assets might be attacked to access, alter, or
destroy data based on the likely attack scenarios deﬁned in Step 1
and the vulnerabilities identiﬁed in Step 2.
5. Determine whether an attack can be detected. If you are per-
forming a pen test, determine if you were able to detect the
attack, either in real-time or in retrospect.
6. Determine the attack footprint.The attack footprint is the size of
the target. If you’re shooting an arrow, it’s harder to hit the stem
of a plant than the side of a barn.The same holds true for your
network. Determine how big a target you’re providing.
7. Analyze results, formulate remediation strategy, and implement.
Risk Assessment
We know there is a trade-off between total security and total risk.There
are ﬁnancial and operational trade-offs that every organization must
make. In the risk assessment phase of your audit, you need to look at your
risks in four speciﬁc categories: asset protection, threat prevention, legal liabili-
ties, and costs.This is a good time to sit down with key stakeholders,
including your executive sponsor or team, your ﬁnancial, legal, human
resources, and operational experts to determine what your company’s spe-
ciﬁc risks are.As mentioned in Chapter 5, your IT security project plan
team membership will likely change as you move through the phases of
www.syngress.com
274
Chapter 10 • General IT Security Plan

your project. Risk assessment is a part of the initial deﬁnition stage, and
should include all of the key stakeholders you can think of.At this point,
it might be better to invite too many people to attend this meeting rather
than too few.Anyone who ﬁnds their participation is not needed can
opt-out, but you want to avoid forgetting a key player who can help you
and your IT team perform a thorough risk assessment.
The risk assessment itself should be thorough; skimp here and you
will likely end up with a less-than-optimal security solution. Even if your
company can’t afford to implement all the recommended security solu-
tions, at least you’ll have a thorough assessment of what’s needed.This
may be important later on, because if a security breach does occur, you
can point to documentation showing that your assessment indicated the
breached area was a risk (which might save your job down the line).
However, rather than be right later on, use the results of the assessment to
pro-actively push for a bigger budget and implement those changes now.
If there’s documentation showing that you were aware of the potential
security risk and did not implement a solution, your ﬁrm might have a
huge legal and ﬁnancial liability on its hands. So, the thorough assessment
cuts both ways. It gives you the data you need to make your case for
appropriate funding, but it can also be used by attorneys to prove your
company was aware of the risk and chose not to act.
Risk Assessment:Asset Protection
As we have continually stressed throughout this book, you have to ﬁnd
the right balance between protecting corporate assets and the cost of
doing so. In any network assessment scenario, you should begin by
understanding what you’re trying to protect and why.You may have ade-
quately addressed this issue during your overall IT corporate security
planning process. If so, you should review the data, assumptions, and out-
comes at this stage to ensure your conclusions are still relevant and cor-
rect.Things change so quickly in most corporate environments, that a
quick review of previous assessment data is almost always a good use of
your time.You should review what data is on your corporate network
and what needs to be protected.This is also a good time to ﬁnd out what
www.syngress.com
General IT Security Plan • Chapter 10
275

is on your corporate network that perhaps should not be. If you recall the
case studies from Chapter 1, it’s not uncommon for corporate networks
to store conﬁdential data on the corporate network, such as credit card
numbers or social security numbers.
In addition to discovering what is on your network (and what’s there
but shouldn’t be), you also need to assess the relative value of that data.
While it can be argued that all corporate data is valuable, some data is
clearly more valuable than other types of data. Remember that you need to
think like a hacker to make these assessments.A list of nuts, bolts, and cable
lengths are not worth as much in value as personal data such as credit card
numbers, social security numbers, and bank access codes. Correlate the data
on your network with the perceived value of the data to an outsider, to
understand the relative risk to your network.This will help you determine
how much security is appropriate for your speciﬁc situation.
A good example of this is a home wireless network. Most people
using home wireless networks for things such as logging onto their online
brokerage account or doing some online shopping with a credit card, do
not secure them.This data is transmitted in an unsecured manner from
their laptop or wireless device to their wireless access point, and then to
the router or cable modem and out to the Internet. How likely is it that a
hacker is going to grab that data? If you live in a dense urban setting
where a hacker can sit in a nearby coffee shop and peruse wireless data
like yours, then the likelihood is high. If you live in a more suburban or
rural setting where it would be difﬁcult for someone to get close enough
to receive your wireless signal, the risk drops signiﬁcantly. If you’re in an
urban setting and you run an unsecured wireless network, your risk is
probably four times higher than someone in a more rural setting.That
said, your overall risk is still about 50 times lower than that of any corpo-
rate network, because a hacker would have to sift through a fair amount
of mundane wireless trafﬁc at someone’s home before being able to grab
usernames, passwords, and so forth; the upside potential for that hacker is
minimal. Why go after a single person’s data if you can access thousands
or millions of people’s data? Looking at the risk/reward proposition from
a hacker’s perspective will help you assess the relative value of your assets
www.syngress.com
276
Chapter 10 • General IT Security Plan

and what level of protection is warranted. Keep in mind there is always
the hacker of convenience, who hacks because he or she can, whether
there is a big payoff or not.
Sensitive Data
Sensitive data is deﬁned differently from one company to the next.What’s
sensitive at one company may not be sensitive at another. However, in
most companies, there are clearly segments of data that are sensitive and,
therefore, your security audit should identify those areas.As part of your
corporate security project plan deﬁnition stage, you must clearly under-
stand how sensitive your corporate data is. It goes beyond the legal impli-
cations and into the business aspects. Lists of customers, vendors, suppliers,
or employees can be sensitive, especially if you’re in a medical setting.
Trade secrets, formulas, and research and development (R&D) data can be
extremely sensitive, especially in industries that work in leading edge or
groundbreaking areas.This is a great place to get feedback and input from
the various departments in your company.Ask them what data they work
with that they would not wanted posted on a Web site or printed in a
newspaper.That usually gets people’s attention and helps them to begin
looking at the data they work with on a daily basis from a slightly different
perspective. Here’s a quick list of data typically considered sensitive:
■
Customer databases
■
Employee lists
■
Identity information (e.g., customer, employee, vendor)
■
Credit card or other ﬁnancial data
■
Health information
■
Intellectual property
■
Trade secrets
■
R&D
Remember, too, that there are two ways sensitive data is at risk. First, it
can be stolen and used inappropriately by your competition, your
www.syngress.com
General IT Security Plan • Chapter 10
277

employees, or by those who can gain ﬁnancially from the data. Second, it
can be compromised. Imagine the damage that could be done if a publicly
held corporation’s ﬁnancial statements were changed without the com-
pany’s knowledge, just before being released to the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) or just before a major announcement. Sensitive data
must be protected from theft and from modiﬁcation. Keep that in mind
when you’re looking at your corporate IT security auditing plans.
Network Services and Business Operations
Sometimes an attacker is less interested in stealing or compromising data
than they are in disrupting business operations (e.g., shutting down a Web
site through a Denial of Service (DOS) attack, or corrupting a customer
database or modifying ﬁnancial statements). Whether it’s the external link
(Web site) or the internal network, some hackers are simply looking to
undermine the availability of the network.There are numerous areas to
look for vulnerabilities in business and network operations.The following
is a list to start with; your organization may have additional operations
that need to be included on this list.
■
Internet connectivity
■
Web site connectivity
■
Web-based applications
■
Database services
■
Directory services
■
File services
■
E-mail services
■
Virus and intrusion prevention and detection services
■
Custom application services
■
Voice over IP (VoIP) services
Take an inventory of the various ways your company uses the net-
work and electronic communications to understand the vulnerabilities
www.syngress.com
278
Chapter 10 • General IT Security Plan

that your corporate IT security project plan should address. More than
likely, you’ll want to create ISAPs to address the various categories,
because smaller projects are more manageable.
Risk Assessment:Threat Prevention
Threat prevention starts with the IT security project problem statement.
What problems are we trying to solve with this project? In other words,
what threats do we perceive that we need to address? What is the com-
pany trying to protect through these security measures? What kinds of
threats are likely or possible? Are you most concerned about an attack, a
theft, or a breach and which is most likely to occur? Answering these
questions will help you deﬁne your problem and your outcome state-
ments, and will also help form a solid foundation for your corporate IT
security project plan.
Because past security measures may be in place, there is not always a
direct relationship between the importance of data and the threat to that
data. If you process credit card transactions through a third-party com-
pany, you do not store the credit card data any longer than it takes to
transmit it to that third-party company.Also, if all of your transactions are
conducted using a secure Internet protocol (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol
Secure sockets [HTTPS] and so forth), the risk of credit card data being
stolen from your company is fairly low. When looking at your threats and
vulnerabilities, you should rank both the importance (the relative ﬁnancial
value) of the data and the relative threat or risk to that data.You want to
make sure your most important data is properly secured while also
ensuring that your biggest vulnerabilities are addressed. By identifying
vulnerabilities and their likelihood of occurrence, you can create a priori-
tized list that will help you make smart decisions should you be forced to
choose to implement only a portion of your total corporate IT security
strategy. If you need to stage your corporate IT security project imple-
mentation to meet the ﬁnancial needs of the company (e.g., breaking it
down into phases that can be funded each ﬁscal quarter), this prioritized
list can also help you decide which projects should be addressed during
each phase of funding.

Denial of Service 
A DOS attack is usually launched at a company’s Web site with the clear
intention of making it unavailable to legitimate users. However, a DOS
attack can also be launched in a variety of ways to deny service to Web
sites, Internet access, network access, or wireless network access. When
looking at your vulnerability to a DOS attack, don’t just look at the risk
to your Web site; look at the risk to any network component that pro-
vides vital business service that could be attacked.
Unauthorized Access
The threat of unauthorized access to network resources comes in various
forms, all of which must be considered. It’s important to assess any points
of entry (e.g., the Web site, any dial-in communications that are still
enabled (remember, you may not use dial-in access any more, but you may
still have modems with live phone lines connected to your servers that
have never been removed); network login and wireless access points are
the most common. In addition, unauthorized access can be gained through
various protocols being left open including Simple Network Management
Protocol (SNMP), telnet, serial ports, and a variety of Transmission
Control Protocol (TCP)/IP ports. Using default settings on routers and
wireless access points also leaves you vulnerable to unauthorized access, as
does providing more lenient access to users and user accounts than
needed. Finally, there is the issue of social engineering that is often suc-
cessfully used on sophisticated IT staff and unsuspecting users alike, in
order to gain access to legitimate network credentials and to unauthorized.
Identity Theft
Identity theft is on the rise and while most people assume it happens as a
result of online fraud, there are numerous ways identity theft can occur.
However, we conﬁne our discussion of identity theft to the kinds most
likely to occur within the business environment.As we’ve repeatedly dis-
cussed, any company that collects, stores, or transfers credit card data can
be a source of identity theft. In addition, companies that collect, store, or
www.syngress.com
280
Chapter 10 • General IT Security Plan

transfer other personal information including names with addresses, social
security numbers, and various account numbers (mortgage, brokerage
account, bank account, insurance, and so on) can also be a source for
information used to steal someone’s identity. It’s also important to secure
employee’s personal data including the above-mentioned information,
because even a company with 50 employees is a decent coup for
someone attempting identity theft.
Individual consumers must take steps to secure and protect their per-
sonal information when interacting with businesses; however, even then
there are limits to what a consumer can do.Take the well-publicized cases
discussed in Chapter 1.Those are clear indicators that businesses are the
more likely target for identity theft, since hackers would clearly like to
get their hands on 100,000 names and not just one or two. It’s critical
that you take an inventory of the data your company collects, stores, and
transfers, and identify any data that could be used to perpetrate identity
theft on your consumers, your employees, or any other individuals your
company deals with.
Personal Information Exposure
Personal information exposure can be the source of identity theft, but it’s
not exactly the same thing. Exposure of personal information could be
private or personal data that would not necessarily facilitate identity theft
but some other type of harm. For example, suppose a medical supply
company’s list of people and their associated medical problems was stolen
and that the information was made public.That information couldn’t be
used to steal someone’s identity, but it could reveal other personal infor-
mation that customers don’t want to share. If your company has any sort
of sensitive information including age, marital status, vacation schedules,
alarm codes, and so forth, your ﬁrm could be liable if that information is
stolen and used in any malicious way.A recent episode of a new televi-
sion program featured a group of robbers that broke into an architectural
ﬁrm and stole blueprints to a bank. While such a robbery would be out-
side your control, if a hacker broke into your network and stole the elec-
www.syngress.com
General IT Security Plan • Chapter 10
281

tronic blueprints to someone’s home, another company, or a ﬁnancial
institution, your company could be held liable for a related robbery.
At the risk of redundancy, review all of the data your company stores,
even data that appears to be useless to outsiders, and think about how
that data could be used if it fell into the wrong hands.
Credit Card Fraud
We’ve talked extensively about personal information and we’ve referred
repeatedly to credit card information as some of the most sensitive infor-
mation companies work with. For most hackers, the bigger the potential
gain, the more desirable the target.Therefore, any company that runs an
online store is clearly a more interesting target than a home computer.
Online stores use secure Web protocols to ensure personal information,
including credit card data, is secure when the user data is transmitted via
the Internet to the company’s Web site. Many smaller e-commerce sites
use a third-party credit card processing company to handle the entire
credit card transaction so that the data never sits on the company’s server
for more than the time it takes to authorize the transaction. Still, there is
a vulnerability there. Hackers can compromise the Web site, redirect Web
trafﬁc, spoof the URL, send bogus e-mail that appears to be from your
company and your Web site, redirect users to an alternate URL; the list
goes on and on.Also, keep in mind that the threat is increased if you have
an unsecured wireless network connected to your wired network.Any
hacker than can gain access through the wireless network can work his or
her way onto the wired network and into your credit card data.
Corporate Trade Secrets or Competitive Data
We can become so focused on personal user data such as social security
numbers or credit card numbers, we might easily overlook corporate
trade secrets or competitive data.There’s a long list of information that
can be considered trade secrets or competitive data.The list for your
company will be very speciﬁc to the business you’re in. We’ve included a
generic list to help prompt your own investigation of data that could be
considered conﬁdential to your company.These include:
www.syngress.com
282
Chapter 10 • General IT Security Plan

■
Customer or employee databases (used to steal customers or
employees)
■
E-mails among employees discussing conﬁdential matters
■
E-mails among executives discussing company secrets, ﬁnancial
status, or future plans
■
Competitive information
■
Formulas for products and descriptions of soon-to-be released 
products
■
Design speciﬁcations, engineering speciﬁcations, and technical
diagrams or drawings for current or new products
■
Conﬁdential reports, audits, or memoranda
■
Personnel ﬁles, performance reviews, pay rates
■
Financial reports
■
Source code for software projects
■
Marketing or technical project plans
Unfortunately, due to the variety of data listed here, it’s often difﬁcult
to deﬁnitively point to one or two network locations where this type of
sensitive information exists. Usually, it’s spread across the enterprise in
department-level folders, on e-mail servers, and on individual desktops
and laptops.As part of your corporate IT security planning process, you
may decide to designate speciﬁc locations for this type of sensitive data, to
be sure it’s properly backed up on a regular basis, and so that you can
control, monitor, and audit access to these ﬁles. In addition, pay special
attention to executives and others who might have access to sensitive
information and who travel with laptops.There have been several well-
known cases of laptops with conﬁdential or sensitive data being stolen
from hotel rooms, locked cars, and airports. In some cases, the thief is just
after the laptop. In worst case scenarios, these thefts constitute industrial
espionage and are intended to garner trade secrets from a competitor or
to steal plans, information, or other sensitive data.

Malicious Data Insertion
Malicious data insertion is a huge problem that is on the rise. Part of the
reason is the increase in Internet usage and in the collaboration of mali-
cious software (malware) writers. Hackers are getting along well these
days, working together to create bigger corporate security headaches.
Malicious data insertion is a risk to every computer on the planet, save
those that (for some reason) are completely isolated from the Internet.
The risk to individual user computers is clear: malware can steal user
names and passwords, track where you go on the Internet, capture your
instant messaging, and copy your e-mail. Pretty scary stuff. In the corpo-
rate environment, that problem is multiplied by the number of hours the
average user is on the network, the type of data carried on the corporate
network, and the number of potential “back doors” available to hackers.
Rootkits are one of the most malicious and growing forms of mali-
cious data insertion (see the following sidebar), but they’re not the only
problems. Viruses, worms, corrupted or modiﬁed data, illegal, illicit, or
unethical data can all be inserted into your network. We often think of
security as preventing unwanted intrusion, which it is, but we sometimes
forget that when the bad guys get in, they often want to leave something
on your computer so they can continue to siphon data.
In addition, this malicious code can cause computers to become
unstable which can result in thousands of lost hours and dollars trying to
recover from these incidents. Some viruses or malware are intended to do
nothing more than cause the computer to run slowly, generate errors,
become unstable, or simply not boot.
Malicious data can also involve inserting bad, erroneous, or illegal data
into the company’s network.Think about the last time you shopped
online: almost every online store uses some sort of database to present
product information, including product name, description, speciﬁcations,
and price. What if a hacker inserted data into that database so that the
pricing was wrong, or a competitor’s products were displayed, or the
company’s President’s social security number was displayed instead of the
www.syngress.com
284
Chapter 10 • General IT Security Plan

product number? In some cases, hackers are pulling a prank; in others,
they want to create serious problems and may speciﬁcally target a com-
pany they want to disrupt.
Business Intelligence…
Malware Threat Rises
An article written by Matt Hines in an April 2006 issue of eWeek.com is
titled Rootkits, Smarter Hackers Pose Growing Security Threats. The
article points to a study released by anti-virus maker, McAfee, on the
growing sophistication of hackers and malware writers. According to
the article, “Factoring into the issue, and the continued maturation of
malicious attacks on enterprise systems, is the growing tendency toward
collaboration among hackers.” McAfee said its research indicates that
the use of so-called ‘stealth technologies’ has jumped by over 600 per-
cent during the last three years.” 
If you’re not already aware, a rootkit is a set of software tools typ-
ically used by an attacker to hide unauthorized activity on the computer,
and to evade anti-virus program detection. The tools are intended to
conceal processes, ﬁles, or data running on the computer in order to
evade detection. The issue made headlines in 2005, when Sony BMG
music CDs placed a rootkit on Microsoft computers in order to prevent
CD copying.
A recent report by Microsoft, the biggest target for hackers,
announced it was practically impossible in some cases to get rid of a
rootkit. In a separate eWeek.com article, Ryan Naraine reported that
Mike Danseglio, program manager in the Security Solutions group at
Microsoft, stated at a presentation at the InfoSec World conference that,
“When you are dealing with rootkits and some advanced spyware pro-
grams, the only solution is to rebuild from scratch. In some cases, there
really is no way to recover without nuking the systems from orbit.” In
fact, when a branch of the U.S. government discovered over 2,000 user
computers infected with a rootkit, it had no viable way to quickly scrub
those systems and reinstall the operating system.

As malware threats rise, it’s even more important to train users,
lock down systems, and have a solid plan in place for wiping out systems
and starting from scratch if malware can’t be removed in any other way.
Be sure your audit looks for these problems as part of your project plan,
and as part of your ongoing security operations. (See http://www.
eweek.com/article2/0,1895,1949650,00.asp, http://www.eweek.com/
article2/0,1895,1945782,00.asp.)
Equipment Theft or Damage
The threat of equipment theft or damage should be carefully assessed and
is typically addressed through physical security planning; how buildings,
ofﬁces, servers, and other network resources are physically secured.
Obviously, some items are easier to steal or break than others. It’s pretty
hard to sneak out of a building with a desktop computer under your
coat, but a blade server, router, or laptop is much easier.Your threat assess-
ment should include taking a look at your physical premises to determine
how easy (or hard) it would be for someone (insider or outsider) to steal
or damage equipment. Network, communication, Web, database, and
application servers would be at the top of the list and should be physically
secured. Beyond servers, there are plenty of network resources that, if
stolen or damaged, could hinder or halt business operations. Items such as
routers, gateways, hardware ﬁrewalls, and network storage devices are crit-
ical to daily operations, and should be included in your physical security
assessment.
Risk Assessment: Legal Liabilities
You may need executive or legal input to understand the company’s legal
liabilities, so make sure you have the right people involved in this assess-
ment. For example:A specialty food distribution company sells to other
businesses and directly to consumers through an online Web store.The
company carries an inventory of about 5,000 products and its product
catalog is available online. It keeps track of various data (e.g., business cus-
tomers’ purchase orders, order history, returns, and so forth.; consumer
names, addresses, phone numbers, and order history; and vendor order
www.syngress.com
286
Chapter 10 • General IT Security Plan

history, stocking levels, pricing, transportation costs, and discounts. It pro-
cesses credit cards through a third-party credit card processing company,
and does not store credit card numbers, expiration dates, or related data.
What are the company’s legal liabilities? On the vendor side, they’re
pretty low because the data is probably not very interesting to most
hackers (excluding industrial espionage). On the customer side, the busi-
ness customer’s order numbers, order history, and purchase order numbers
are also not particularly useful to a hacker, unless someone wants a list of
customers.Again, not particularly useful or lucrative data to go after.
Finally, the consumer data (e.g., credit card information, expiration dates,
names, addresses, phone numbers, and so forth. What’s the liability here?
If the company has a secure connection to the credit card processing
company, and if they never store that data, then the liability is more lim-
ited than if they inappropriately store credit card data in order to do a bit
of “data mining.” However, the security of the transmission between the
credit card processing Web site and the company Web site should be
assessed, as should the overall security of the Web site itself.
As you can see, by looking at your business processes from the hacker’s
perspective, you can better determine where your legal liabilities lie and
how best to address them. It’s important to understand what a hacker
might go after and what the legal liabilities are in each of those scenarios.
Make sure you also understand what, if any, legal protection your ﬁrm has
in the event of a breach, and what impact a breach might have on your
organization such as blacklisting your domain name due to unauthorized
spamming stemming from a breach. Make sure to include your ﬁrm’s
legal representative in this discussion, to make sure you haven’t over-
looked any legal elements. For a more detailed look at legal liabilities,
pick up another Syngress title, Network Security Evaluation: Using the NSA
IEM (see Chapter 5).
Third-party Attacks
Third party attacks are most common in the wireless arena, where an
attacker (usually a spammer) sends unsolicited e-mail via your network
connection. It’s simple enough once an attacker gains access through an
www.syngress.com
General IT Security Plan • Chapter 10
287

unsecured wireless network connection. In those cases, it is your net-
work’s IP address that will be tagged as the source of this spam, even
though no one from your company actually sent the e-mail. Many states
are instituting legal and ﬁnancial penalties for spamming, and your com-
pany could be found liable for spam it never sent. Beyond the possible
legal and ﬁnancial penalties, your networks’ IP address could be black-
listed or shutdown due to this type of activity, unless you have some way
of proving you were the victim of a third-party attack. Even then,
restoring order and connectivity can be extremely difﬁcult.Another
growing and disconcerting kind of attack are zombie nets, which are
Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS) attacks.
Illegal Data Insertion
We talked about malicious data insertion, but we didn’t speciﬁcally discuss
the legal liabilities that can come from it (as opposed to malware, rootkits,
and so on).There are two ways illegal data ends up on your network.
First, stolen content could be placed on your network from an attacker
who gains unauthorized access to the network.They may place stolen
data there in order to blackmail the company, to embarrass the company,
or to get the company in legal hot water. Suppose a hacker (or disgrun-
tled employee) places unlicensed, stolen software on your network and
then reports your company to the authorities? Suppose a competitor’s
blueprints or technical drawings end up on your network and it is
somehow discovered? These kinds of activities may not steal your data,
but they can certainly disrupt business operations, cost a lot of money,
and create signiﬁcant legal liabilities.
Risk Assessment: Costs
At some point in every project planning process, you should ask the
question,“What if we do nothing?”The reason for this is to avoid solving
a problem that doesn’t need to be solved. In the case of corporate IT
security, you shouldn’t just “do nothing,” but if you start from there and
www.syngress.com
288
Chapter 10 • General IT Security Plan

work your way up, you can begin to understand what is required and
what might be optional, since you’re likely to have to make trade offs at
some point.
Once you’ve decided to implement corporate IT security, you’ll need
to include the initial and ongoing costs of securing the network to your
cost estimates. If you already have an IT security solution installed, you’ll
have to address the cost of both the ongoing (in place) IT security, and
the new security initiatives.Your costs include securing the network data,
securing the network connection, securing network communications, and
securing end-user devices (laptops, Personal Digital Assistants [PDA’s]).
You will continually have to balance operational security with operational
efﬁciency and security costs with remediation costs.
In addition to these implementation costs, you need to assess the cost
of a network security breach to the organization. If the network is com-
promised, how much will it cost you to repair the damage? What are the
costs of remediation, legal defense, and possibly marketing and public
relations to address a potential breach? Finally, you need to look at the
cost/beneﬁt analysis to determine how all the potential costs of a breach
compare to the cost of securing the network in the ﬁrst place.Though
the answer almost always comes out in favor of pro-active security solu-
tions, you need to be comfortable with your analysis so that you can
defend it to your executive team or project sponsor.
People
When performing a risk assessment and looking at costs, you need to
start with the people needed to design, implement and maintain security.
Without the right people in place, your costs (or schedule) can mush-
room and you can still end up with a network full of security holes.
Critically assess your team’s skill set and be brutally honest with yourself
about the skills your team has and the skills it lacks. Hiding your head in
the sand won’t change the cost of the project but it will change the out-
come if you don’t have the needed skills.As mentioned earlier, hiring an
outside security consultant can be costly but the quality of the result can
end up saving you time and money on the other end of the project. If an
www.syngress.com
General IT Security Plan • Chapter 10
289

outside consultant isn’t warranted or affordable, you’ll need to ﬁnd alter-
native ways of gaining the expertise you need at a reduced cost.That
might involve training current staff (which still leaves them at the early
stage of the learning curve), hire a well-qualiﬁed temporary employee
(which comes with the danger that he or she will open a back door into
your network), or hire a full-time employee with the requisite skills. It’s
going to cost you no matter which way you approach it, so you might as
well ﬁnd your best alternatives early in the process. It’s usually an invest-
ment that’s well worth it.
Training
As part of your security assessment, you’ll need to look at the training
needs of the entire organization related to security.As we’ve stated, secu-
rity is not a one-time activity; it takes the awareness, attention, and com-
pliance of all network users to help ensure a secure network.As such,
there are a variety of training activities that will probably be needed and
which should be assessed early in the planning process.
■
Installation and Conﬁguration Equipment that is improperly
installed and conﬁgured creates a huge security hole.Think of all
the wireless routers out there using the default administrator
username and password. IT staff may require vendor-speciﬁc
training on equipment, especially servers, routers, and ﬁrewalls,
among others. Remember that training provides the necessary
knowledge to IT staff, but there’s no substitute for hands-on
experience.
■
Network Operations Training The ongoing operations of the
network is where security is monitored, maintained, and managed
once the security plans have been implemented.Therefore, as part
of the assessment, it’s important to begin identifying what
ongoing operations are required to maintain security once it’s
established. It’s important for those responsible for managing the
day-to-day network operations to be well-versed in secure opera-
tions, and to be well-trained in operational issues. Whenever pos-
www.syngress.com
290
Chapter 10 • General IT Security Plan

sible, send your employees to vendor-sponsored training on the
equipment you use. It’s a great way to ensure your employees are
well-trained on network equipment, and a great way for your
employees to learn about the latest tips, trick, and threats from
the instructor or other class participants.
■
End-user Training End-user training is often overlooked in the
security planning process, yet we all know that users can be the
ﬁrst line of defense. When users understand the threats that exist,
they can actively participate in keeping the network secure. For
instance, if employees understand that downloading ﬁles from
unknown sources (and some known sources) can result in mal-
ware being installed, they tend to be a bit more cautious about
downloads. If they understand that an unusually slow computer
or altered ﬁles can be a sign of virus, worm, or malware infection,
they can quickly report it rather than disregard it.Also keep in
mind that each company should have policies in place regarding
safe and approved computer behavior. Each employee should be
trained in these policies and ideally should have to acknowledge,
in writing, that they will comply with these policies. While
training can be a signiﬁcant expense, the upside is that properly
trained users are less likely to put the network or the company’s
data at risk. We know the cost of remediation is very high both
in real dollar costs and in lost productivity.The cost of training is
almost always offset by the real reduction in security risks.
Equipment
When performing a risk assessment and looking at costs, it’s important to
include equipment—both equipment that needs to be protected and
equipment that protects the network. Equipment that needs to be pro-
tected are all network servers, routers, switches, hubs, ﬁrewalls, desktops
and mobile devices (your list might be longer).These devices need to be
physically protected from theft, damage or unauthorized use. In addition,
these devices need to be protected from remote attack such as data inser-
www.syngress.com
General IT Security Plan • Chapter 10
291

tion, data manipulation, or data theft. On the other side of the spectrum
is the equipment you use to protect your network, including ﬁrewalls,
isolated network segments (and the equipment used to create those sub-
nets), routers, and more.
Sometimes it’s helpful to look at what network level (data link, net-
work, application, and so forth) your equipment is operating and how it
needs to be protected. In other cases, it might be more helpful to look at
your network map and determine where security is needed.
Regardless of the security solution you’re working on (corporate IT
security or one of the individual security area plans), you’re probably
going to have to buy software or hardware to complement your security
efforts.You can harden your servers, disable unused TCP/IP ports, set up
auditing, and tighten access controls but you still need ﬁrewalls, anti-virus,
anti-spyware, and other security systems to complement those efforts.
Again, be sure you do a thorough inventory and assessment before sitting
through any company’s sales presentations. Deﬁne your goals, your needs,
and your parameters ﬁrst, then sit through the presentations. Companies
will almost always try to up-sell you. Sometimes that’s a good thing
because they add value to the process; however, other times it’s just about
making more money. If you are clear about the equipment and the solu-
tions you need before you sit down and talk with anyone, you’re more
likely to purchase just the solutions you need, not the ones the company
wants to sell you.
Time
When IT staff members are on salary, there’s a tendency to forget that time
is money. IT security can take up tremendous amounts of time in many
different areas, and the risk assessment and the associated costs should
include the cost of people’s time.When planning the time for the risk
assessment and the security plan implementation, include tasks such as:
■
Equipment speciﬁcation development
■
Equipment purchase (direct purchase or through a bid process
such as Request for Quote [RFQ])
www.syngress.com
292
Chapter 10 • General IT Security Plan

■
Equipment set up, staging, testing, conﬁguration, and installation
■
Integrating security solutions into existing infrastructure (plan-
ning, staging, testing, implementing)
■
Maintenance, operations, and recovery procedures
■
Baseline testing and documentation
■
Security policies and procedures
■
Vendor contract negotiation and contract management
Time is a cost that should be captured within your assessment and in
your project plan. When you delineate your project’s tasks, you’ll capture
the estimated duration (how long you’ll allow for the task to be com-
pleted) so you can create a project schedule. Depending on how your
company works, you may also be required to capture labor costs. In these
cases, you’ll need to estimate the time (effort) it will take to complete a
task, and calculate the labor cost based on the wages of those who will be
completing the task.Add tasks like those in the above bulleted list, so that
you don’t inadvertently underestimate your labor costs in both the assess-
ment and project implementation phases.
Impact Analysis
How much would it cost your business to be down for one hour? One
day? One week? As part of your risk assessment, you need to identify
your critical business systems and processes that most impact your busi-
ness revenues, your assets, and your clients or customers.These should be
ranked in order of direct and indirect costs. It’s not enough to merely
determine that you’d lose $54,000 per hour of revenue. What is the cost
in terms of lost productivity, IT staff time spent on remediation,
employees unable to access critical data, and the press getting wind of
your security breach? Identify your business systems, evaluate the impact
of an outage, and prioritize them so you can focus your attention on
addressing the most critical aspects ﬁrst.You can use a model like the one
shown earlier (in Figure 10.1) as an aid in deﬁning your impact analysis.
www.syngress.com
General IT Security Plan • Chapter 10
293

Since you’re likely to implement your security plan as a corporate IT
security plan with smaller individual plans incorporated, you can choose
to implement the most critical ISAPs ﬁrst.This reduces your security
risks quickly while providing a comprehensive approach to corporate
security.As we’ve discussed throughout this chapter, the potential impact
goes far beyond the ﬁnancial impact and can include:
■
Immediate ﬁnancial loss
■
Long-term ﬁnancial loss
■
Loss of customer conﬁdence
■
Industry or market loss of conﬁdence
■
Bad press or intensive press scrutiny/investigation
■
Regulatory, statutory, or legal investigation
■
Shareholder scrutiny or lawsuits
There are companies that perform impact analysis as part of their con-
sulting services, but in many cases, you can perform this assessment your-
self or with help from key members of your company.The analysis should
include identifying the most critical business processes across your entire
company (not just the headquarters or location you’re most familiar
with).After identifying these critical business processes, you should iden-
tify the maximum outage your company can afford to sustain before it
severely impacts the well-being of the company.According to the Gartner
Group, 50 percent of all businesses that suffer a data loss due to attack or
system failure went out of business within three years of the attack if they
failed to restore the lost data within 24 hours.Your impact analysis should
include the impact of both a full and partial outage.Your recovery and
remediation plans should also be well-documented, so that you are able
to recover quickly.Your impact analysis should address the ﬁnancial, pro-
ductivity, and personnel impact of an outage, and you will also need to
account for the potential legal liability (and the related ﬁnancial impact of
legal defense and litigation) of a security breach that exposes conﬁdential
or personal information.
www.syngress.com
294
Chapter 10 • General IT Security Plan

The impact analysis should also take into account the priority of
recovery. Clearly, when a security breach is discovered, the ﬁrst priority it
to close the gap and secure the network. Once that is accomplished,
however, additional work must be done to assess the scope, nature, and
impact of the breach. Recovery and remediation plans should be priori-
tized based on business impact, so that the most important systems are
brought back online as quickly as possible. Sometimes in the heat of the
moment, people tend to go after the “low hanging fruit” and focus on
the tasks that are easiest or fastest to accomplish. Having an impact anal-
ysis and prioritized list at your disposal during these crises can help you
focus on getting the most important work done ﬁrst without having to
try to evaluate priorities during an “emergency.”
Public Access Networks
One of the most neglected areas is that of public access security and the
impact to business via a breach in this arena. Here’s the most common
scenario:A busy VP of Marketing is traveling to an important client
meeting. She’s waiting in an airport for her ﬂight and is waiting for one
of her staff to make a key revision in the presentation she’s making at the
client site. She ﬁres up her laptop and checks her e-mail. While online,
she opens another document, makes a few changes, and saves it. She logs
off, saves the updated presentation to her laptop, turns off the computer,
and boards her plane. It all sounds innocent enough until she checks into
her hotel room and ﬁres up the laptop. Now she ﬁnds that she can’t
logon to her e-mail account. She gets a message saying username or pass-
word is invalid. She contacts the IT help desk but it’s after hours and she
gets a recording and the option to page someone. She’s very tired, it’s
been a long day so she lets it go until morning. What she doesn’t know is
that sitting in the airport was someone just waiting for someone else (the
VP of Marketing in this case) to log onto an unsecured wireless network
that appeared to be the airport network.The bad guy now has her corpo-
rate username and password, which happens to be the same for her e-
mail.The bad guy now has access to everything on her corporate
network, and he’s been reading her e-mail while she is in meetings.
www.syngress.com
General IT Security Plan • Chapter 10
295

Because she’s a fairly high level corporate employee, chances are good her
user account has permission to access highly conﬁdential material.
Certainly she (and now the bad guy) have access to marketing plans and
projections, ﬁnancials, and more.
Most IT staff will focus intently on the impact to business operations
if the corporate network is attacked directly, but the scenario described is
becoming more commonplace. When looking at the potential impact,
look at all of the ways your company’s employees connect to corporate
data and look at the potential impact of these means of access.
Legal Implications
We discussed the legal implications at great length, so we won’t repeat
that here other than to say that it should be abundantly clear to you by
now that there are signiﬁcant legal aspects to IT security that must be
assessed and addressed in a clear, thoughtful, and intelligent way.The
future of your company literally depends on how well you do your job in
this area. No pressure.
After performing a thorough risk assessment, audit, and/or impact
analysis, you should have a very clear idea of what needs to be secured
and what the priorities are. When you looked at the impact of systems
outages to your business, you should have developed a prioritized list that
would help you in two ways: you know what you need to secure ﬁrst,
and you know where you need to focus your IT resources, including
your staff, your budget, and your project planning efforts.You can priori-
tize your ISAPs based on this analysis and build them into your corporate
IT security plan in a phased manner.This helps by reducing the project
scope, schedule, and budget and allows you to focus completely on one
particular security area at a time. Granted, not everyone can implement
security solutions in a sequential manner, in some cases you’ll have to run
security projects in parallel. We also recognize you don’t have the luxury
of just running a security project. IT staff have multiple ongoing responsi-
bilities on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis.The security project will be
“just another task” on the long to-do list for many. Breaking your corpo-
rate IT security project plan down into smaller s can help staff focus on
www.syngress.com
296

the tasks at hand without overwhelming them with a massive corporate
security plan.
Thus far in this chapter, we’ve talked about your risk assessment and
impact analysis.We’ve gone into great detail, but you can dig even deeper.
This should provide you with an excellent framework for understanding
your corporate IT security needs.As we mentioned, you will have to circle
back through this more than once, because the corporate IT security plan
depends on a full assessment. Regardless of your approach, you will want to
revisit your data at least once and reﬁne it as you go, to make sure your
corporate IT security plan is as comprehensive as possible. Remember,
there is no perfect security solution and you can far outspend your need
for security; thus, striking a balance should be your goal. Next, we discuss
the parameters for your corporate IT security plan.
Business Intelligence…
Scan the Headlines to Avoid Common Mistakes
We all have those “duh” moments when we realize we’ve made an
incredibly dumb mistake by overlooking the obvious. One way to avoid
common security mistakes is to scan the headlines for what’s happening
in the rest of the world. Many IT professionals subscribe to a variety of
online newsletters including security-related newsletters, which is one
way to stay on top of changes in the world. In addition, scan newspaper
and magazine headlines on a regular basis. If possible, include a “what’s
new in the world of security” segment in your IT staff meetings, and
assign one or more people each week to come prepared with a ﬁve
minute presentation (sans PowerPoint) on a security-related topic. Look
at the problem, how it was detected, and how it was corrected. This
information can be extremely useful in detecting and avoiding security
problems internally. It keeps you and your staff up-to-date, sharpens
your skills, and can also make for very interesting staff meetings. And,
chances are if they were exploited elsewhere, they’ll be exploited in your
organization before long.

Authentication
Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of any entity
requesting access to network resources.Authentication encompasses server
and host authentication, router or wireless access point authentication
(where applicable), process authentication, and user authentication.
Authentication and authorization are not exactly the same thing,
though in some cases such as legal or technical requirements, they are
often paired or confused with each other. However, authentication is the
process of making sure you are who you say you are, and authorization
allows access based on that identity.
Your project plan should dig into your authentication security to
determine how effectively you’ve implemented authentication systems,
where your vulnerabilities lie, where and how an attacker might strike,
and what you need to do to improve security. While ever-changing, the
list presented here shouldn’t change too dramatically in the near-term,
unless some major event or discovery obliterates previous authentication
solutions.
■
Basic Authentication Users signing into a guest account have
to know the guest account name and password.
■
Two-factor Authentication The username and password are
two factors required to log onto a network.This is similar to
entering a credit card number and the expiration date for an
online transaction.
■
Multi-factor Authentication The username, password, and pin
number are all part of multi-factor authentication. Many banks
use multi-factor authentication to prevent theft based on URL
spooﬁng. Multi-factor authentication includes entering a user
name and then being presented with a unique key such as a pic-
ture or key word, and then entering your password only after the
correct key is presented to you.This prevents speciﬁc types of
attacks, such as man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.

■
Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) PKI is a form of cryptog-
raphy that is implemented as part of a security project. PKI allows
users to communicate securely through the use of a pair of cryp-
tographic keys. One of the keys is the “public” key and one is the
“private” key, and they are related to one another mathematically.
■
Geo-location Geo-location is a method of determining where
in the world a particular computer resides. It’s used for a number
of legitimate purposes, but it can also be used for illegitimate
purposes. Many companies sell IP address geo-location databases
that can locate the city and the street Justas well as the country of
an IP address.Anonymous trafﬁc can help deter geo-location
efforts, but many Internet companies will not accept or forward
anonymous trafﬁc.
■
Kerberos An Internet security protocol that prevents eavesdrop-
ping and replay attacks, and ensures the integrity of the data. It is
implemented between clients and servers and provides mutual
authentication.
■
Secure Shell (SSH) SSH is one implementation of public key
cryptography that provides for mutual authentication of user to a
remote server. It also provides data conﬁdentiality and integrity.
■
Secure Remote Password (SRP) Protocol  The Secure
Remote Password Protocol is a password-authentication system
that allows users to authenticate with a server.This method is
resistant to dictionary attacks and does not require a trusted third
party.
■
Closed-loop Authentication Closed loop authentication is a
means by which one party veriﬁes him or herself to another
party by requiring the use of a token transmitted from a trusted
point of contact.

Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS)
RADIUS is a protocol that provides authentication, authoriza-
tion, and accounting (AAA) for network access and mobility. It
works in both local and roaming situations.
■
DIAMETER DIAMETER is an AAA protocol that is pur-
ported to be the “upgrade” to RADIUS, although it is not back-
ward compatible.
■
Hashed Message Authentication Code (HMAC) HMAC is
a type of message authentication code that uses a cryptographic
hash function in combination with a secret key.
■
Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) EAP is a fairly
universal authentication mechanism that is often used to secure
wireless networks and point-to-point connections.There are vari-
ations of the EAP protocol that are incorporated into recent
Wireless Protected Access (WPA) and Wi-Fi Protected Access 2
(WPA2) standards for wireless networking security.
■
Biometrics Biometrics are used in computer security through
ﬁngerprint, retinal, and facial recognition, among others. Recent
studies have shown that some of these methods are easily
spoofed.
■
Completely Automated Public Turning Test to Tell
Computers and Humans Apart (CAPTCHA) You may have
run into this type of authentication without knowing its name.
It’s used to tell humans apart from machines by preventing auto-
mated responses. It falls into the category of challenge-response
authentication.Typically, a word or set of numbers and letters are
presented that are obscured or modiﬁed in some manner to pre-
vent computers from responding to a prompt. Figure 10.2 shows
an example of a CAPTCHA.

Authentication can be accomplished in a number of ways.This section
is not meant to teach you about authentication as much as it is meant to
get you thinking about the kinds of authentication you may have or may
want to research as you begin developing your IT security project plan.
We discuss cryptography in a later chapter, with an eye toward developing
individual security area project plans.
Business Intelligence…
CAPTCHA
You may not need to know about CAPTCHA to develop your authentica-
tion and authorization assessments, audits, and recommendations, but
it’s a very interesting concept that’s worth knowing about. This is one of
those areas that you’ll learn about sooner or later if you have your staff
actively looking for innovations in the security world. Developed by the
brilliant folks at the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon
University, the CAPTCHA can be used in a variety of applications, among
them thwarting automated responses. There are several iterations of this
method. The most basic is called “Gimpy,” which distorts text so that
www.syngress.com
General IT Security Plan • Chapter 10
301
Continued

human eyes can still recognize and read the text, but computers cannot
use automated programs to discern the letters in the text image.
“Bongo” is a system where the user is shown visual images and asked to
determine where a third image should be placed. “Pix” relies on a large
database of labeled images. The database then pulls four (or some
number) of related images together and asks the user to identify the uni-
fying element (e.g., it might show a picture of a lake, an ocean, a sail-
boat, and a glass of water). The unifying element can be selected from
a long list that includes the word “water.” CAPTCHA uses a sound ﬁle to
say or spell a word, and then the listener must type in the word he or
she heard. 
CAPTCHA’s are good for a lot of things, but keep in mind that
they’re not friendly to those who have sight or hearing problems (e.g.,
visually impaired people often use screen readers to determine what’s
on their computer screen. Clearly, visually based CAPTCHA’s can be prob-
lematic, because aurally based CAPTCHA’s would exclude people who
are hearing impaired. While this may be a small portion of your popula-
tion, it is something to consider before implementing this type of
system. For more information on CAPTCHA, go to www.captcha.net.
Access Control
Access control can be thought of as authorization and encompasses three
areas: physical access to equipment, local access to the network, and
remote access to network resources through Virtual Private Network
(VPN), the Internet, or wireless connections.As shown earlier in Figure
10.1, the layered approach might help you visualize your network and
look at access control from that perspective (e.g., how do you physically
control, monitor, and detect a breaches access to the elements deﬁned?
How do you virtually control, monitor, and detect breaches to access? 
Physical Access to Equipment
As part of your ISAP, you need to assess and audit the physical access to
your equipment, and devise strategies for improving that aspect of secu-
rity based on the results of your assessment, testing, and auditing.
Restricting and monitoring access to key network components such as
www.syngress.com
302
Chapter 10 • General IT Security Plan

servers and routers, is an important part of securing the network that
should be addressed in your security project plan. Obviously, there are
limits to how secure you should make equipment. Users need access to
some of the network resources, including desktops, laptops, PDAs, and
other wireless devices.These assets should be protected to the greatest
extent possible to prevent an unauthorized person from using or stealing
the equipment (e.g., What happens when the receptionist steps away from
his or her desk? Is the front door locked? Is there a security person or
camera? Does your company’s security policy dictate that he or she lock
his workstation ﬁrst?).Also, compliance issues such as the Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) can come
into play. What if the receptionist who leaves the desk unattended works
in a doctor’s ofﬁce or a hospital emergency room? In that case, you have
two issues—the security risk and the HIPAA risk.
Local Access to Network
Local access is typically controlled through username login requirements,
although as mentioned in the previous section, it is also tied to actual
physical access to the system. Look for ways that unauthorized persons
might gain access to the local network.This is clearly the largest area,
because we have to include usernames, passwords, access control lists,
security and user groups, permissions, and how they replicate throughout
the organization.These areas should be reviewed and addressed as part of
your assessment and included as discrete tasks in your security project
plan. Local access can also include someone slipping a wireless access
point onto a network node that is hidden or in an obscured location.
Remote Access to Network
Remote access includes access to the corporate network by employees
physically located outside your network, as well as other connecting
points into the network such as extranets and Web sites—anyplace that
the inside and outside come together.An attacker would prefer to sit in
www.syngress.com

the comfort of home to wander undetected through your network, so all
external-facing access points must be assessed and addressed in your 
project plan.
Auditing
Different people view auditing in different ways, but the net result is that
auditing should examine and expose any shortcomings of IT and com-
pany security policies in a systematic manner.The challenge for many IT
departments is twofold. First, policies almost always come from outside
the IT department, so you have to actively advocate for policy change
and work collaboratively on a cross-functional team to accomplish this
goal. For many in IT, that’s not an appealing proposition. Second, devel-
oping policies and procedures based on the outcome of your auditing, is a
task that requires less technical ability and more organizational agility,
which are two primary reasons why IT audit results sometimes don’t
make their way back into organizational policies and procedures.
Many IT security experts agree there are ﬁve major components of a
security audit: policy review, process and procedure review, operational
review, legal requirements, and reporting requirements. Let’s look at each
of these areas in more detail so you can include tasks in your IT security
project plan to address these components.
Policy Review
There are all kinds of corporate policies that directly and indirectly
impact network security.This is an area that you should have representa-
tives from different areas of your company provide input.At minimum,
you should have one or more representatives from Human Resources to
provide guidance on current policies, how suggested changes to policies
might be implemented, and whether there are any legal or Human
Resources considerations for such policy changes.
There are three basic kinds of policies, as shown in Figure 10.3.The
physical policies truly govern who can physically access equipment,
including servers and other mission critical components.Technical poli-

are often governed by or created from administrative policies, the third
piece of this puzzle, which outline how corporate resources are used.
Figure 10.3 Three Layers of Security-related Policies
Physical
Physical policies prevent unauthorized access to network resources, which
basically prevents theft and tampering on a physical level. Physical policies
are often dictated by administrative policies (e.g., you might have an admin-
istrative policy that says that only senior IT staff have access to server
rooms.You might enforce that policy through physical policies such as
installing a card key system that only senior IT staff identiﬁcation (ID) cards
can open, or using a keypad with unique Personal Identiﬁcation Number
(PIN) numbers for each senior IT staff member.While these are clearly
physical barriers to entry, they also reﬂect or enforce administrative policies
through technical policies (which card keys or PINs are authorized). Notice
that these three areas are always intertwined.
Technical
Technical policies are enforced by the operating system or other related
technology, not by physical means.A technical policy addresses various

Physical Policies

Policies

technical requirements such as the requirement to use strong passwords or
a policy regarding how conﬁdential data is encrypted.These technical
policies are, in a sense, the second line of defense after physical policies.
However, since attackers often don’t require physical access to the net-
work, physical policies are inadequate by themselves.
In addition, technical policies that should be audited include the full
scope of how users access the network and what methods are in place to
monitor network activities (e.g., how user groups are created and main-
tained, how it is determined which user gets membership to which
groups, how group permissions are assigned and replicated through the
enterprise, the administrative procedures for maintaining appropriate
group permissions, and related activities).
When we talk about auditing, we’re talking about looking at the secu-
rity environment, but there is also the discrete activity of auditing that
involves tracking various network events through the use of log ﬁles and
alerts. What you audit is strictly dependent on your unique network
environment. If you audit too many events that don’t directly help you
manage security (or other critical network aspects), you risk becoming
bogged down in mundane log ﬁles and non-critical event evaluation. If
you audit too few events, you may miss seeing a pattern of repeated
attack or inquiry (perhaps an attacker is gathering information and has
not yet performed an intrusive attack). In this case, auditing is part science
and part art.You have to carefully determine which events are worth
auditing, understand what the audited event will actually tell you about
your network activity, and create a process for routinely reviewing log
ﬁles.A log ﬁle containing all the clues to an imminent network attack is
useless if no one ever looks through it and analyzes the logged events.
Providing a full list of auditable activities is outside the scope of this
chapter, but there are great resources available to help you develop a
meaningful network auditing process so that you can be sure you’re
looking at log ﬁles and audit ﬁles that help you maintain security across
the enterprise.To get you started thinking about log ﬁles and auditable
events, we’ve created this high level list for you:

Buried by Log Files
You’ve undoubtedly had a lot of experience with log ﬁles. You know that
you can set auditing requirements in just about any way you want, and
at the end of the day, those audit activities create alerts and log ﬁles.
While there are automated ways of reviewing log ﬁles, they’re not
without ﬂaws. Being overrun with data is not helpful if you can’t discern
the potentially important events from normal daily network activities. As
Jacob Babbin puts it, it’s really about “identifying the patterns in the
chaos.” (Security Log Management, Jacob Babbin, Syngress Publishing,
Inc., 2006). Jacob (and others) put together a great resource to help you
ﬁgure out what you need to log, what you need to do with those logs,
and ultimately, how you can see “the forest through the trees” when
you’re managing security logs in the enterprise. You can also ﬁnd arti-
cles speciﬁc to managing log ﬁles in the Windows environment on the
Microsoft Web site at www.microsoft.com/technet. When all is said and
done, it’s your job to determine which events to audit and to manage
log ﬁles in a manner that enhances and maintains security. A log ﬁle that
isn’t read and acted on is just a waste of 1s and 0s on your network
storage device.

Administrative
A variety of administrative policies are required to describe in detail how
security is maintained.These run the gamut from policies regarding
which level of access a manager is granted, which employees should be
granted remote access capabilities, and how passwords should be created,
secured, and maintained. Policies regarding the use of the Internet, the
ability to download from the Internet, or the ability to install new pro-
grams fall under both administrative and technical policies.The adminis-
trative policy describes what is and is not allowed and technical policies
are created to enforce those administrative policies.This can include
blocking certain Internet sites and disabling the feature that allows users
to install new programs and other technical safeguards.Administrative
policies are typically included in employee handbooks, reviewed during
employee orientation or awareness campaigns, and maintained through
active management.
Administrative policies also help deﬁne the culture and attitudes
toward security within an organization. While some companies go a little
crazy with policies and procedures, others are far too lax.You’ll need to
work with key stakeholders in your organization to ﬁnd the right balance
between securing the network and over-burdening management with
policies that are unenforceable or unmanageable.
Process and Procedure Review
Here is another area in which you should have strong Human Resources
input, because many of the security processes and procedures are directly
related to personnel management (e.g., what happens when an employee
is hired or ﬁred?). In some organizations, it can be days before a ﬁred
employee’s account is disabled.A policy that states that the account of any
terminated employee should be disabled within ten minutes of termina-
tion should then be coupled with a process for doing so.This might
involve having the ﬁring manager or Human Resources notify IT
through a deﬁned process so that the account is quickly disabled. What
about when a new employee is hired? Are there any policies regarding
www.syngress.com
308
Chapter 10 • General IT Security Plan

background checks for employees working in Human Resources, IT, or
ﬁnance? If so, you also need to have a process for making sure the back-
ground check is performed.
Operational Review
Your operational review should accomplish the following:
■
How consistently are the policies and procedures related to secu-
rity applied and enforced?
■
How do day-to-day operations enhance or degrade IT security?
■
What operational plans are in place to address security in the var-
ious areas? Ideally, each area should be assessed individually and as
part of a holistic system.
Your operational audit should look at four discrete elements that help
build a secure framework. First, you should provide the least privilege
necessary for any user to perform the functions of their job. Second, you
should reduce the attack footprint by disabling, removing, and unin-
stalling anything on the system that is unused, including equipment,
modems, ports, software packages, protocols, and the like.You should also
look at the various security layers, sometimes called depth-of-defense, to
ensure your policies, procedures, and operations support your security
objectives. Finally, you should work diligently to identify the inherent
assumptions you’re making about your network, your users, and potential
attackers (people, process, and technology assumptions).
Legal and Reporting Requirements
Although listed last, it might actually be the ﬁrst task, chronologically, that
you perform in your audit function because it often helps to know what
your legal requirements are for your audit. If you must conform to var-
ious government or legislative regulations, you should state these at the
outset of your audit process.As part of your project plan, you should have
deﬁned your various requirements and all legal requirements should be
listed.This will help you devise an audit plan that ensures you meet these
www.syngress.com
General IT Security Plan • Chapter 10
309

requirements. In addition, you may have legal or corporate reporting
requirements.Again, these should be deﬁned at the outset so that your
audit is conducted in a manner that facilitates the required reporting. For
example, you may need to collect a particular type of data that can only
be collected at the time the activity occurs.Therefore, your audit require-
ments should list this and these requirements should be built into your
task’s completion criteria.
Attacks
Attacks come in all shapes and sizes, and the list of common attacks pro-
vided here will no doubt change before the ink on the page has dried.
Still, old habits die hard and some of the most common attacks have been
around for a long time. In this section, we provide a list of attacks to look
for, to prompt you to think along these lines. However, be sure to sit
down with your team and research the latest attack methods as well as the
best practices for addressing these attacks.
Attacks can generally be categorized as intrusive and non-intrusive.
Intrusive attacks include password attacks, DOS attacks, network snifﬁng,
spooﬁng, session hijacking, and application and database attacks. Non-intru-
sive attacks include network and host discovery (using a variety of tech-
niques), port scanning, war driving (and related activities), and information
reconnaissance. Intrusive attacks usually cause damage; non-intrusive attacks
are typically the precursor to intrusive attacks, because they involve gath-
ering information about their target prior to the actual attack.Therefore,
let’s start by talking about various non-intrusive attacks that provide vital
information to an attacker in preparation for the actual assault.
Non-intrusive Attacks
Non-intrusive attacks are intended to gather information typically needed
to perform an intrusive attack.There are various kinds of non-intrusive
attacks; the following list is just a sampling.You need to look at all the
different ways your network can be evaluated or sized up by the bad
guys, so you can determine how a non-intrusive attack would generate
www.syngress.com
310
Chapter 10 • General IT Security Plan

needed data for a later, more invasive attack. Let’s look at a few of the
more commonly used non-intrusive attacks and how they should be
incorporated into your own assessment, testing, and audit plans.
Information Gathering
We previously discussed various kinds of data that hackers try to access,
including user account information, contact names, e-mail addresses, and
phone numbers, as well as system conﬁguration data and external con-
nection data (extranets, phone lines, and so forth) This type of non-intru-
sive attack is called information gathering (also known as information
reconnaissance), because the attacker is simply gathering data from public or
easily available sources. While you can’t prevent this information from
being gathered, you can think of ways to reduce the value of this data,
such as using generic e-mail addresses for public use.Your audit activities
should include an examination of all of the public data you can ﬁnd on
your company (e.g., phone book, Web site, search engine, public records,
domain name registration, and so forth), and ensure it is as minimal and
generic as possible.
Server and Host Discovery
Finding the addresses of key servers is one of the goals of most hackers.
There are two distinct ways to accomplish this task. One is to access the
network and start “taking inventory.”The other is to ﬁnd a source that
will tell you everything you need to know. One of those sources is the
Domain Name Server (DNS) directory, that will give you all kinds of
information about the structure of the network.The variety of record
types used in the DNS can yield a wealth of hacker-friendly information.
A thorough discussion of DNS is far outside the scope of this book, but it
is an area your IT security project plan should incorporate.Active
Directory (in the Microsoft world) and other directory services are also
potential gold mines for attackers.
Aside from DNS and other directory services, there are many other
kinds of information about your server and hosts that a hacker would
love to get their hands on.This includes all network conﬁgurations,
www.syngress.com
General IT Security Plan • Chapter 10
311

system components (routers, switches, hubs, and so forth), wireless net-
works, telephony equipment and conﬁguration data, power and control
systems for your network, and other data that generally cannot be enu-
merated via a directory scan.
Your audit should perform the same kinds of enumeration and dis-
covery techniques that a hacker would use to try to determine the con-
ﬁguration and layout of your network.There are numerous techniques
and tools you can use for this set of tasks.
War Dialing and War Driving
War driving (also known as war dialing) is when an attacker drives around
looking for open wireless networks. Many organizations have dial-in con-
nections to their networks that are no longer used but still active, or that
are active but not secured. It’s easy to dial phone numbers during off-
hours to try to ﬁnd a modem that automatically throws handshakes at
you.Your audit should identify all existing modems and the current state
of the security on those lines.
Port Scans
Another non-intrusive attack is a port scan. When an attacker is looking
for a way in to your network, he or she may perform an initial port scan
to see what ports are sitting open for them to enter through.The TCP
and the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) both use ports to identify session
and services information, and to transmit this data back and forth among
machines using these protocols. Ports should be scanned on your end, and
your security project plan should include ports that are listening, ﬁltered,
and closed.
Intrusive Attacks
Intrusive attacks intrude into your network for a deﬁnite purpose. Once
an attacker has gathered data using non-intrusive techniques, he or she
now have the needed data to actually get into the network and do some
damage.Two major objectives for hackers are to get in and out quickly,
and to do so in an undetected manner.Therefore, your job is to make it
www.syngress.com
312
Chapter 10 • General IT Security Plan

hard to get in and out, and even harder to do so without detection. It’s a
never-ending high stakes game of “cat and mouse.” Let’s look at some of
the intrusive attack techniques you should include in your network secu-
rity assessment and audit.
Password Attacks
Password attacks are the easiest and most commonly used intrusive
attacks.They can be done through social engineering (e.g.,“Hey, Jake, I
forgot the password for the database, can you e-mail it to me? I’m
working from home today.Thanks!”), brute-force attacks, dictionary
attacks, and password capture.
DoS
Traditional DoS attacks ﬂood Web servers with so many packets, that it is
forced to deny service to legitimate users.This was a very popular attack
style about ten years ago but is still used in a variety of less-well known
ways.A DoS can happen at a Web or Internet connection point or at a
server, where the CPU is overloaded with bogus requests it must respond
to, thus forcing out any legitimate CPU requests.A new variation, DDoS,
gained favor among hackers in the recent past.
Network Snifﬁng
Network snifﬁng is the process of capturing and examining network
packets to gather information to be used in an attack.Your assessment and
testing should include network snifﬁng, but keep in mind that snifﬁng
must be done on the local network.That means that you can’t do it
remotely.Your policies, procedures, and technology should help ensure
that sniffers are not used on your network; however, there is no danger of
remote sniffers.Also keep in mind that switches, which are “smarter” than
hubs, are designed to send trafﬁc to one speciﬁc host instead of broad-
casting to everyone on the segment.As a result, switches are vulnerable to
network snifﬁng attacks and should be tested in your organization.
www.syngress.com
General IT Security Plan • Chapter 10
313

Spooﬁng
The three most common kinds of spooﬁng are DNS, e-mail, and IP. Each
type of spooﬁng attempts to impersonate legitimate network or elec-
tronic trafﬁc in order to gain access to valuable data.Your assessment and
testing plans should include tests to see how easily (or not) spooﬁng can
be used on your network.
Session Hijacking
As you know, a session is a speciﬁc connection between two computers.
Sessions are created in order to exchange information between hosts on a
network. If a session can be hijacked, a hacker can insert his or her com-
puter into the exchange and gather information. Sessions can be hijacked
at the application level, the host level, or the network level.Your assess-
ment and testing should include a determination as to whether your net-
work uses transport protocols that are unencrypted (which could lead to
session hijacking vulnerabilities), if you have ports that could be easily
hijacked, or if you have applications that have been written with security
in mind (terminating idle sessions, testing user input, use digital signa-
tures, and so on).
Application Attack
Commonly used application attacks that have received a fair amount of
publicity include buffer overruns (stack and heap) and integer overﬂows.
Assessment and testing plans should address these issues.
Database Attack
Database management and the attendant requirements for security can ﬁll
volumes on their own. Databases are becoming more complex and
securing them is becoming more difﬁcult. Ironically, even today, many
databases are the weakest link in the security chain. Database servers
should be tested for proper conﬁguration, all updates and patches should
be applied, and access should be strictly controlled. Scripts should be
www.syngress.com
314
Chapter 10 • General IT Security Plan

tested to ensure that errors that can be forced (or are accidentally gener-
ated) do not compromise the security of the database server or the
database itself.
Assessment and Audit Report
Once you’ve completed your assessments, testing, and audits, you need to
generate a report that helps you, the team, and management understand
the ﬁndings of these activities. If you’re performing the assessment and
audit as a separate project in preparation for the development of your
corporate IT security plan, these ﬁndings will form the basis of that pro-
ject plan’s requirements and assumptions. If you’re performing these tasks
as the ﬁrst major objective within your corporate IT security project
plan, you’ll need to take these ﬁndings and circle back into some of your
earlier planning tasks to revise your plan based on the results of this ﬁrst
phase. In either case, it’s not enough to simply record the results of var-
ious assessments, including vulnerability assessment and auditing.This data
needs to be turned into actionable information that is incorporated into
later stages of your project. Information without action is as bad as no
information.You and your team should spend time thinking about the
types of data that will result from these activities and how that informa-
tion can be used to increase security across the enterprise.
The results of your assessments and audits might become legal docu-
ments if your network is later breached, so you should be cognizant of
the potential implications of these reports.That is not to say you should
omit or minimize negative information.To the contrary, you should doc-
ument the issues found with the clear understanding that you will take
action—within a reasonable time and in a reasonable manner—to miti-
gate or resolve these issues.
It is easy to forget that this document essentially lays out every vul-
nerability and weakness discovered. What a great resource for a hacker!
Be sure that the document is not widely distributed and that you main-
tain strict control of it.You may choose to create several versions of this
document, most of which do not speciﬁcally delineate the vulnerabilities
www.syngress.com
General IT Security Plan • Chapter 10
315

and weaknesses in a way that could be exploited (e.g., your executive
team does not need to know the all the details, and you don’t need to
worry about where the document ends up.There might also be some
legal liability issues with regard to executives being made aware of speciﬁc
problems.
You may want to sit down with your project sponsor to discuss the
reporting requirements for this project. Since there are potential legal issues
related to this type of reporting, you may also want to consult with your
ﬁrm’s legal counsel before you begin your security project plan, to deter-
mine the most appropriate way to proceed.Again, the intent is to ensure
that your ﬁrm stays within the realm of legal and ethical behavior; your job
is to help your company navigate that sometimes circuitous path.
Elements of a Findings Report
The elements that should be included in your report should be, at a min-
imum:
■
The steps taken to assess vulnerabilities and weaknesses
■
A list of vulnerabilities and weaknesses found
■
An assessment of the risk (criticality and likelihood of occur-
rence) of each vulnerability or weakness
■
The speciﬁc steps to mitigate each vulnerability or weakness
■
The speciﬁc owners, timelines, and deliverables for each mitiga-
tion strategy
Let’s look at these elements in more detail.
Deﬁning the Steps Taken
Through the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), your project plan
should describe all of the steps taken to assess, test, and audit security
across the enterprise, so that you can easily recap these activities in the
beginning of your report. Rather than put copious amounts of detail in
this section, you may choose to put a reference or link to the project 
plan itself.
www.syngress.com
316
Chapter 10 • General IT Security Plan

Deﬁning the Vulnerability or Weakness
After the assessment, you should have an excellent idea of what vulnera-
bilities were found.You should describe in detail the source and nature of
each vulnerability. If possible, organize them using some logical system,
whether by system (external, network conﬁguration, servers and hosts,
and so forth), or by source (network protocol, operating system, scripts,
and so forth). Beware of standard security deﬁnitions that come “out of
the box” with various security applications.They are intended to be one-
size-ﬁts-all deﬁnitions, but they often don’t ﬁt. Use the expertise of a
security professional (whether internal or external) to deﬁne the impor-
tance of the vulnerabilities.
Deﬁning the Criticality of Findings
Each vulnerability or weakness should be assessed for criticality (i.e., how
important is this vulnerability?).As you know, there are some vulnerabili-
ties that would be devastating if exploited, but the likelihood of such an
exploitation is statistically insigniﬁcant. Remember that your ﬁndings
report may serve two purposes: internal and external.The internal pur-
pose might be to document ﬁndings in preparation for an IT security
project, or it might be used as a tool to negotiate for a higher IT security
budget based on vulnerabilities discovered. On the external side, this may
become a legal document if something goes wrong down the road. Be
aware of the potential uses of this document. Create a document with the
right amount and level of detail regarding your assessment of the criti-
cality and potential impact of vulnerabilities.
You can use whatever ranking system works for you. Some people use
a numbering system where 10 is the highest criticality and 1 is the
lowest. Others use words such as critical, high, medium, and low.
Whatever ranking system you use should be deﬁned so that everyone
understands the meaning. What does “critical” or “10” mean? You could
say that “critical” is deﬁned as any activity that can cause bodily harm or
death, signiﬁcantly compromise the company’s ﬁnancial future, signiﬁ-
cantly compromise the company’s ability to remain an ongoing concern,
www.syngress.com
General IT Security Plan • Chapter 10
317

signiﬁcantly damage the company’s brand or reputation, or result in sig-
niﬁcant legal liability or lawsuits.
Deﬁning Mitigation Plans
Your mitigation plans might be part of this project plan or they may feed
into your larger corporate IT security project plan, because a solid assess-
ment should be the starting point for most (if not all) IT security pro-
jects.Therefore, how you address your mitigation plans will depend on
how you’re approaching the project as a whole.
Mitigation plans should be clear, speciﬁc, and measurable.They should
include which speciﬁc vulnerability they are addressing, how the vulnera-
bility will be mitigated, and what the result should be. It might also
include how you’ll test the results of the mitigating action as well as how
these results should be rolled into ongoing security processes and proce-
dures. Finally, it should include recommendations for changes to physical,
technical, and administrative policies, as appropriate.
Deﬁning Owners,Timelines, and Deliverables
In the project management world, a task with no owner most likely will
not get done, or the task will default to the project manager.To avoid
either of these scenarios, you should include owners, timelines, and deliv-
erables in your ﬁnding report. If these tasks are going to be rolled into a
higher level corporate IT security project plan, you should still deﬁne
these elements and then make sure they are incorporated into the details
of the corporate plan. Deliverables might include functional, technical,
legal, ﬁnancial, or regulatory requirements.They might also include spe-
ciﬁc acceptance criteria and should include success criteria. If you recall,
acceptance criteria are those standards by which a project result is
accepted (typically by a client, but in this case it might be acceptance by a
regulatory or compliance authority). Success criteria are those standards
by which the task owner knows the task was successfully completed.They
are closely related, but are not the same in every case.

Chapter 10 • General IT Security Plan

Format of a Findings Report
You don’t necessarily need to hire a graphic designer to format your
ﬁndings report for you, but you should create a professional presentation.
If you’re going to present it to senior management, it should be well-pre-
pared so that it provides information in a clear, concise, and professional
manner. It should be technically accurate and as objective as possible.
While it’s tempting to become a bit defensive if the results are not stellar,
it’s more important to stick to the facts. Executives typically hate spin and
obfuscation, therefore, your best bet is to calmly and rationally state the
facts.That also means that you should avoid presenting the information in
an overly pessimistic way as well. Executives also don’t like to hear “the
sky is falling,” even if it is.Try to be fair and balanced. One way to do this
is to include measurable statements.This helps prevent an “all or nothing”
presentation.
The actual presentation for your ﬁndings will vary based on your cor-
porate culture. If creating a PowerPoint presentation is how you dissemi-
nate information, go for it. Otherwise, write the report in a format that’s
aligned with the relative formality of your organizational reporting
norms. For starters, here’s an outline you can use to begin the process:
1. Cover Sheet Cover sheet with title, author name, contact infor-
mation, and date.
2. Table of Contents If the document is long, a TOC is helpful.
3. Executive Summary Write this after you’ve completed writing
the report.Think of what you’d say if you ran into an executive
in the elevator and had one minute to summarize your ﬁndings.
4. Summary of Findings Discuss the project background brieﬂy
as well as the scope, key ﬁndings, and methodologies used.
5. Detailed Findings Include relevant detail that you want to
capture and report.You may choose to leave some detail out and
reference an external document that contains all the detail,
depending on how much detail is available.A 9,000 page detail
document might not be helpful for anyone but the IT staff.
www.syngress.com
General IT Security Plan • Chapter 10
319

6. Remediation If you haven’t included remediation recommen-
dations or actions in your ﬁndings, include them here.
7. Timelines and Deliverables Any follow up action required
should have assigned owners of speciﬁc tasks.These tasks should
deﬁne clear timelines and deliverables.
We’ll discuss more about various security reporting processes and
tools when we discuss operational security later in this book. For now,
we’re focusing on reporting needs during the assessment and auditing
phase.
Project Plan
We’ve covered a number of related topics in this ISAP, including man-
aging assessments, audits, access control, authentication, attacks, and
reporting. Now you should have the data needed to put together your
security project plan.As with all projects, let’s start with the problem
statement and the major objectives. Once those are deﬁned, you and your
team will be in a better position to select the optimal solution for your
organization.
Project Problem Statement
Your problem statement for this security project plan should focus on the
need to ascertain how secure your network currently is, what processes,
procedures and systems are in place to maintain security, and how that
security can be supported, maintained, or enhanced.The problem state-
ment you generate will be speciﬁc to your organization. However, three
statements are provided here as generic starting points.
We do not have a benchmark for our current level of secu-
rity, and we are not conﬁdent that our network is as secure
as it can be given our size, resources, and vulnerability pro-
ﬁle.
As our company has grown, our public proﬁle has also
grown, and we are concerned that our network may now be
www.syngress.com
320
Chapter 10 • General IT Security Plan

a valuable and sought-out target for attacks. We are partic-
ularly concerned about maintaining conﬁdentiality of certain
data.
Our company is now subject to several governmental regu-
lations regarding the conﬁdentiality, integrity, and avail-
ability of our data. We are not conﬁdent that we currently
meet those standards; we need to ensure that we meet or
exceed them within the next six months.
Problem Mission Statement
As with the problem statement, your mission statement will be highly
unique to your company and this project. However, here’s a starter for you:
To assess how well IT security systems protect the conﬁden-
tiality, integrity, and availability of critical network resources,
and to generate speciﬁc actionable data that can be used to
increase security across the enterprise.
Project Objectives
Once you’ve deﬁned your problem and mission statements, you are ready
to create a short list of high-level objectives. In this project, we’re
focusing on assessing and auditing your network for vulnerabilities.You
can lay out your objectives in one of several ways, depending on your
preferred approach to IT project management. Some people like to com-
bine their major objective and follow-up action into one objective (i.e., if
you test for vulnerabilities, you also want to create a process for
addressing those vulnerabilities, which can all be put into one high-level
objective. On the other hand, you could make vulnerability scanning one
high-level objective and remediation another.Thus, the objectives for this
individual security area project look something like the list shown in
Figure 10.4.
www.syngress.com
General IT Security Plan • Chapter 10
321

Figure 10.4 Sample Objectives for Security Assessment and Audit Project
We’ve talked about each of these elements throughout this chapter.
The objectives here are clear and will form the foundation of the pro-
ject’s WBS.Your security project plan’s objectives may vary from those
shown in Figure 10.4, but the overall result should be the same—a list of
high-level objectives you want to accomplish in this project.
Potential Solutions
Your potential solutions are varied, but let’s start with the fact that you
can perform these assessments and audits internally using IT staff, or you
can outsource this function.There are pro’s and con’s to both approaches
and you may have a third or fourth viable option you want to consider.
When you look at your potential solutions for this particular ISAP, you
need to consider the following factors:

Do we have the internal expertise we need to ensure we’re effec-
tively looking at all systems?
■
Do we have the time to perform as extensive an assessment,
audit, and test as is needed?
■
Do we have the budget or time to train internal staff to perform
these tasks? If so, is that desirable?

Are we conﬁdent we have trustworthy individuals internally that
will perform these tasks as needed?

Are we conﬁdent we can hire an external ﬁrm that we trust to
perform these tasks as needed?

Are there organizational or political considerations that will
impact this decision?
■
Are we subject to speciﬁc legal or regulatory requirements that
would impact this decision? If so, what are they and how will
they impact this decision?
■
Are there other organizational resources we can call upon to assist
with some of the non-technical elements of this project?
■
What are the environmental constraints (technology changes,
industry changes, pending litigation, pending acquisition, and so
forth) that might impact this project?
How you approach your list of potential solutions is up to you, but if
you ask and answer these questions, you’ll at least start out with a clear
idea of some of the factors impacting your decision.These questions (and
any others you want to add to the list) should be addressed by the core
IT project team with key stakeholders, if possible. Remember, user input
early in the process will help avoid disconnects that often lead to security
problems later. While users may not understand some of the more tech-
nical elements of the project (e.g., vulnerability testing or assessing the
risk of various types of attacks), they can be very helpful in letting you
know how current security is working and how they work with the cur-

rent security processes. In fact, they may very well have great ideas on
how security could easily be improved that you might never think of.
Selected Solution
Once you’ve looked at your potential solutions and thought through all
of your organizational constraints and considerations, you should be able
to identify the optimal solution for this project. Remember, at this point
you want to focus on the optimal solution, knowing that you’ll more
than likely have to scale it back in one way or another once you start
addressing project constraints. In some ways, organizational constraints are
project constraints, but it’s often helpful to separate them into two distinct
categories.
Organizational constraints that impact your solution selection might
include the fact that the president of your company sits on the board of a
company that uses solution X, and has therefore mandated that you con-
sider using solution X. It might be that you know your company is in the
process of acquiring another company and that your IT budget will be
strained with acquisition-related activities.These are organizational con-
straints you’ll have to deal with. Once you begin deﬁning your project,
there will be additional constraints (e.g., a speciﬁc project budget, alloca-
tion of resources, and project timing that will impact the project even
more directly).You’ll have to bounce your ideas about your optimal solu-
tion against these organizational constraints to see what is most optimal at
this juncture.The key is to start from the best possible solution and shave
it back from there. If you start placing too many constraints on your pro-
ject at the solution selection point, you may miss an opportunity to create
an optimized plan. It’s like digging around in your pocket to see how
much cash you have and then deciding what to have for lunch.You may
have failed to take into account that you also have your debit and credit
cards with you, which would open up more possibilities. Don’t limit
yourself too early in the process.
When you have identiﬁed your optimal solution, take time to clearly
describe and record it.The last thing you want is to sit through long
www.syngress.com
324
Chapter 10 • General IT Security Plan

meetings to reach consensus only to have to re-visit the decision in 30
days when a new vice president comes on board. While you might still
have to re-visit the decision, if you have adequately documented the pro-
cess of coming to the solution, the rationale behind it, and the factors
considered, you may be able to short-circuit these kinds of endless loops
that can drive even the most sane IT person over the edge.
General IT Security Project Parameters
We’ve deﬁned our project’s problem, mission, and objectives very clearly.
Next, we need to deﬁne the project’s environment.Again, the speciﬁcs of
these sections will vary from company to company and from project to
project, so don’t just cut and paste these into your plan.That said, you can
use these if they apply directly to your unique set of circumstances.You’ll
need to look at the requirements for this particular project as well as
deﬁne the scope, schedule, budget, and quality of the project. Once you
understand what’s involved (at least in a preliminary way), you also need
to describe the skills you’ll need to successfully carry out the project.
After the required skills are documented, you’ll need to assign key per-
sonnel to the project and form your project team.The ﬁnal stage of the
deﬁnition stage is to develop and document project processes and proce-
dures. Ideally, you’re already working with a core project team, but if not,
this is a good time to pull in additional resources to help in the initial
project deﬁnition stages.
Requirements
What are the requirements for a project whose objectives include per-
forming security assessments and audits as well as developing recommen-
dations for remediating or removing any vulnerabilities discovered? As
discussed in earlier chapters, there are a wide range of requirements that
often impact IT projects. We’re not going to run through all of them
again, but we will provide a quick list of the major categories of require-
ments you should consider including.Then, we provide a few speciﬁc
requirements for this type of security project plan and let you take it from
there.

325

Types of Requirements
The following are the types of requirements you should consider
including in this project.Also, check with your team, your human
resources group, your legal representative and your project sponsor before
ﬁnalizing your requirements list.

User requirements
■
Functional requirements
■
Technical requirements
■
Legal or ﬁnancial requirements
Project Speciﬁc Requirements
The types of requirements needed for an assessment and auditing project
plan include the technical requirements for the various assessments and
tests to be performed. When looking for security vulnerabilities, you
should specify the speciﬁc target of the assessment, the speciﬁc tests or
actions that will be taken, how results will be monitored, recorded, and
reported, and how recommendations will be made.These might fall
under functional, technical, legal, or ﬁnancial requirements.Technical
speciﬁcations should encompass methods, tools, and techniques that will
be used to test and assess security.The audit function should include very
clear speciﬁcations regarding functional and technical requirements.
While you might not speciﬁcally think of user requirements in this
type of project, a user requirement in this context might include that tests
be run at night or on the weekend when the fewest users will be
impacted; that users be selected at random (or via some speciﬁed system)
to review current security practices; or that users will be needed to per-
form certain testing or auditing functions due to speciﬁc subject matter
expertise that you want to bring onto your IT project team.
You may choose to develop your requirements using the elements
shown in Figure 10.5 as your guide. Look at your perimeter, network
conﬁguration, servers and hosts, applications and databases, and data needs
as you develop this project’s functional and technical requirements.
www.syngress.com
326
Chapter 10 • General IT Security Plan

Figure 10.5 Element of IT Security Requirements
Scope
The scope of this project is up to you and your team. If you choose, you
can parse out these different topic areas (as shown in Figure 10.5) into
separate sub-project plans that roll up into your general IT security pro-
ject plan. If so, each of the sub-project’s scope would be limited to the
topic area. If we assume these elements are part of one project, the scope
is all the work to be done to assess, test, and audit security in each of
these areas as well as the security at the intersection of these areas.
The scope statement should be as speciﬁc as possible about what the
project includes and what it doesn’t include. Here are a few examples of
statements that help you deﬁne the scope of your project:
1. The company has 47 servers, including infrastructure, systems, and
applications servers, which are all included in this project.The
organization may acquire the business operations of CompanyZ
during this project and CompanyZ servers are speciﬁcally
excluded from the scope of this project. CompanyZ servers will

be included in a separate project plan should the acquisition go
through.
2. The company has 3,243 host computers, including 2,844 desktop
computers and 399 laptops and other mobile devices.These are
all included in the scope of this project.All CompanyZ host
computers are excluded from this project.
3. The company has four separate geographic locations. Each loca-
tion is a separate domain within the corporate forest. Each of
these four domains is included in this project plan. Domains
external to these four domains are speciﬁcally excluded.The four
domains are: east.company, west.company, north.company, and
south.company.
Each of the above statements is a clear, speciﬁc statement. We could
continue to delineate which operating systems the servers and hosts are
using, and we could speciﬁcally exclude all operating systems that are not
listed as currently under use. Or, we could have delineated all the oper-
ating systems and speciﬁcally included or excluded Linux and Apple
operating systems in this project.
The key is to be very clear about what you’re going to include in this
project. Later, as you develop your WBS, you can keep an eye on your
scope statements to make sure you don’t deﬁne a larger project than your
scope statements describe. On the other end of your WBS development,
you can circle back and determine if your WBS describes a bigger project
than your scope statements.A good checks-and-balances approach to
developing and deﬁning your project helps mitigate scope creep.
www.syngress.com
328
Chapter 10 • General IT Security Plan

Business Intelligence…
Scope—Best Practices
Scope creep happens in even the best-planned and managed projects.
The key is how well you can manage that creep so it doesn’t get com-
pletely out of hand. While it’s true that there are some projects in which
scope does not creep, it seems to be one of the most common areas to
shift and change as a project moves forward. One way to contain or even
prevent scope creep is to deﬁne not only what the project includes, but
also what it speciﬁcally excludes. The project management gurus in
Stanford University’s Advanced Project Management program suggest
deﬁning what a project is and is not. Sometimes by forcing yourself to
speciﬁcally say what is not included, you can better deﬁne the boundaries
of scope and prevent it from oozing out in all directions. It may not cure
all scope creep problems, but it will help you draw a line in the sand.
Schedule
You’re most likely familiar with the concept of the WBS, which is your
detailed list of project tasks broken down into manageable work units.
Until you develop your WBS, you can’t create a detailed or meaningful
schedule. However, at this juncture, you should have a sense of how much
work this assessment, testing, and auditing project is going to require.
Therefore, you should at least begin to develop your ﬁrst pass schedule.
Will this take 6 weeks or 6 months or 60 months? Based on the high-
level objectives and your scope statement, you should begin narrowing
this down to a ballpark duration for the project, with high-level mile-
stones you might want to include. For example, you might look at your
objectives and scope and determine that this is about a 4-month project.
You might also know that your company is being investigated by the
SEC for potential violations related to the disclosure of conﬁdential data
and that your project will come under intense scrutiny.Therefore, you
www.syngress.com
General IT Security Plan • Chapter 10
329

may choose to shorten this proposed schedule, knowing it will cost more
to get it done quicker, so that you can complete your assessment within
60 days in order to comply with one of the SEC’s recommendations (or
requirements). Remember, too, that if you shorten your estimated project
time, you’ll have to modify the scope, budget, or quality to compensate.
Budget
As with your schedule, you’re not completely ready to sign on the
bottom line for the project cost estimate, but you should have a sense of
what this project will likely cost. If your company has a set budget for
this project, you have to ﬁnd ways to work within that pre-determined
budget by adjusting the scope, schedule, or quality. On the other hand, if
there is no set budget for this project at this time, you can develop a
high-level guess based on your experience and expertise. If possible, avoid
tossing around schedule or budget estimates at this point, as they often
“stick” and you end up with a ballpark estimate becoming your actual
schedule or budget.
Once you develop your detailed WBS, you can better estimate the
time and cost of each task and activity and roll it up into a project
budget. Remember to involve subject matter experts who can best esti-
mate both time and cost for speciﬁc tasks within the project plan.
Quality
Deﬁning quality in the assessment, testing, and auditing area is tricky. If
you determine that zero intrusions is your requirement, then your quality
metrics are very high.You will always have to balance security against cost
and against usability. Where you draw these lines is how you are, by
default, deﬁning quality. If you tolerate some security vulnerabilities or
weaknesses due to user requirements or cost constraints, you have essen-
tially lowered the quality.This is not necessarily a bad thing as long as it’s
done consciously and intentionally, and as long as you can justify the
reduction in quality.As stated, you don’t need the same security as the
U.S.Treasury if you’re selling granite to landscape companies. Keep this in
mind as you deﬁne what level of quality is acceptable.
www.syngress.com
330
Chapter 10 • General IT Security Plan

By the same token, be cognizant of the costs of reduced quality in
terms of potential legal liability.This may be an area in which you choose
to consult with your legal representative to determine what “reasonable
care” in your company and industry would consist of. While there may
be no deﬁnitive answer, getting expert guidance can reduce your overall
risks, especially when it comes to making decisions about the trade-offs
between security and cost or security and usability.Although quality is a
difﬁcult area to tackle, quality goals and metrics help deﬁne the maturity
of the processes that are in place.The ultimate goal is continuous
improvement, but you have to start on a very solid foundation to build
quality into all of your security and IT processes.
Key Skills Needed
In a project of this nature, you need a variety of skill sets. First, you need
extremely savvy technical people who can think and test like hackers.
This is a slippery slope, indeed, because it’s always a bit unnerving to have
people on your IT staff who think like hackers. On the other hand, is it
any safer or more reassuring to hire an external ﬁrm that thinks like
hackers and hand them the keys to your system? As the old expression
states,“better the devil you know than the devil you don’t.”There is no
single right answer, but you should be aware of the risks.You’ll also need
people who are less technical, who would be excellent at reviewing poli-
cies and procedures as they relate to security practices in the company.
These people are sometimes found in the IT department, but might also
be found elsewhere in the company.This list is not exhaustive but should
give you an excellent running start.
Technical Skills
1. Physical layer protocols, processes, and services
2. Network layer protocols, processes, and services
3. Operating systems
4. Applications

5. Databases
6. Internet
7. Wireless
8. Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) and IDS 
9. Attack methodologies
10. Attack testing tools
11. Vulnerability and intrusion testing tools
12. Reporting tools
13. Remediation tools, techniques, and recommendations
Non-Technical Skills
1. Public information reconnaissance (what information can be
found about your company)
2. Review of security policies
3. Review of procedures and policies (might also require technical
review or assistance)
4. Recommendations for implementation (from a non-technical and
user perspective)
5. Documentation
6. Training
7. Project communication
Key Personnel Needed
Once you’ve deﬁned your technical and non-technical skill sets, you need
to locate and acquire the right people for the project. In any project, this
can be a challenge for a number of reasons. However in the case of a
security assessment, you need to be sure you have the right players on
your team. If you don’t have the depth and breadth of skills needed, you
will have to devise a strategy for acquiring those skills. Depending on a
number of variables, you will have to decide whether to train, hire, or
www.syngress.com
332
Chapter 10 • General IT Security Plan

contract out for those skills. Whatever route you take, be sure you have
people who are well-versed and experienced in the technologies related
to security vulnerability and testing, as well as assessments and audits.This
is one area where you could have some serious gaps in skills; it’s better to
address them now than face a potentially devastating security breach later.
Since you can’t personally perform and monitor every single task in this
project, you need to have a high level of conﬁdence that the team you do
have has the requisite skills, because at the end of this security project
plan, you will be held accountable for results.
Form the Project Team
Forming the project team is listed here to remind you that if you haven’t
yet put together a preliminary team, you’ve missed a few opportunities to
actually gain expert input and assistance. However, if you’ve been
working with your core team up until this point, now is a good time to
begin deﬁning the ongoing project team, which might mean creating
several sub-teams to address various sub-sections of the project based on
expertise, availability, or other pertinent factors.At this point, you should
have a clear idea of how readily available your needed resources are and
what strategies you’ll need to use to acquire the right talent at the right
time in your project lifecycle.
Project Processes and Procedures
With your project team, you should deﬁne the processes and procedures
for this project.You should have many standard templates for things like
task status reporting (to you), project status reporting (to management),
project status reporting (to the user community), issue tracking, escalation
procedures, and more.
In addition, you need to deﬁne very speciﬁc procedures and processes
for implementing your assessment, testing, and auditing (e.g., if you hire
outside contractors to perform these tasks, you should have very clear
legal documents drawn up that might include non-disclosure agreements,
speciﬁc agreements about what to test and when to test it, and speciﬁc
guidelines on what should be done with the resulting information.
www.syngress.com
General IT Security Plan • Chapter 10
333

Even if you’re working internally, pen testing is a tricky situation,
because you don’t want employees getting in trouble for performing a
pen test and exposing a serious vulnerability. Be sure you get the proper
authorization and document the speciﬁc people, responsibilities, tasks, and
timelines.These should be part of your project processes and procedures
in this type of project, due to the sensitive nature of this kind of work.
Remember that pen testing on the front side is most useful to test areas
that you believe you’ve previously secured, not to just go after the net-
work prior to implementing your security plans.
You’ll also need to deﬁne what should occur in the event a vulnera-
bility scan or pen test reveals a very serious problem. If you’ve deﬁned
“very serious” as “critical” or as a “10,” what should the tester do? These
should be thought of in advance to protect everyone involved. Deciding
on these actions ahead of time helps set expectations and helps keep
everyone calm when something signiﬁcant occurs.
General IT Security Project Plan
We’ve deﬁned the environment for the project, now it’s time to get into
the details of the project plan.The next step is to take the high-level pro-
ject objectives and create the WBS. Whatever method you use for cre-
ating the WBS is ﬁne, but remember to follow a few best practices:
■
Use the verb/noun format to describe tasks so they are clear and
unambiguous.
■
Don’t spent time placing tasks in order until later; just make sure
they all get captured.
■
Gather subject matter experts to assist in developing a detailed
WBS.
■
Use a numbering scheme that helps you understand the relation-
ship between and among tasks.

Project WBS 
Your WBS will vary depending on the speciﬁc objectives you’ve devel-
oped for this project plan. However, to give you a running start, we’ve
included a sample in Figure 10.6. If you’re familiar with developing a
WBS (which we’re assuming you are), you can follow whatever method-
ology you’re most comfortable with. If this is all new to you, you can use
the structure shown in Figure 10.6 as a solid starting point. Be sure to
include reporting and close out activities in your project plan, as you
would with any type of IT project.

Project Risks
There are always risks to any project and this one in particular is fraught
with possibilities.You and your team should spend time discussing your
project’s risks as well as your plans for mitigating those risks. Included
should be your triggers (how will you know the risk has occurred) as well
as your assessment of the potential risks involved in your mitigation plan.
Risks to this type of project include (but are not limited to):
■
Missing a signiﬁcant vulnerability or weakness
■
Failing to fully implement recommended solutions
■
Changes to corporate objectives, structure or funding
You can deﬁne as many risks as you choose.As with other risk assess-
ments, you should determine the likelihood of the risk occurring and the
impact should it occur.Then create mitigation plans for those risks that
weigh in on the top of your list.The biggest single risk is that your pro-
ject will fail to ﬁnd a signiﬁcant vulnerability or weakness.The bigger
risk is that you will fail to ﬁnd it and someone will exploit it. How do
you mitigate this type of risk? In part, through sound project planning
and consistent methodologies. Don’t let egos drive this process. If you
believe your team members have the requisite skills, ﬁne. Otherwise, ﬁnd
outside resources to assist you.
Project Constraints
Constraints on any project often include time and money, but more spe-
ciﬁc to this project plan, one of the typical constraints, is the ability to
perform these assessments. Non-intrusive attacks are generally safe and
can often be performed at just about any time. On the other hand, intru-
sive attacks are more dangerous and could potentially disable a server, net-
work segment, or the entire network.Therefore, the timing of these
various tests is often constrained by user schedules and higher level cor-
porate events. It would be pretty dismal if your testing brought down the
network on the same day your boss was holding a press conference in the
conference room using network-based resources.
www.syngress.com
336
Chapter 10 • General IT Security Plan

Another common constraint in this type of project is the availability
of highly qualiﬁed personnel.This project requires a very speciﬁc set of
skills for many aspects of the assessment and testing functions. Having the
wrong people performing this work can result in wasted time or
increased vulnerabilities. However, you may have difﬁculty ﬁnding,
training, hiring, or contracting out for these services, especially if your
budget is locked in.This is the place in your project plan where you
review and work through these various constraints to determine what
impact they will have on your project. If they are signiﬁcant, it will
require you to sit down with your project sponsor to work through these
problems before proceeding. If you believe the constraints on this project
are serious, don’t agree to a project plan that is faulty from the start.
Negotiate with your project sponsor to address these problems.
Project Assumptions
Project assumptions in this type of project might include a list of the
known vulnerabilities you’ll be testing for, and the assumptions about the
skills or availability of key technical resources. If you have two people on
your team who are able to perform the bulk of the vulnerability scanning
and testing, you should list this as an assumption about your project.
While some project management methodologies list “success factors”
as discrete elements of the security project plan, they can also be incorpo-
rated into assumptions. If you assume that the things you need to be suc-
cessful are included, you can list them in this section (e.g., if continued
executive support is one of the factors you deem essential to the success
of the project, or if you believe that a 25 percent increase in your IT
budget will come through and is fundamental to the success of the pro-
ject, list these as assumptions.
Project Schedule and Budget
Now that you’ve developed your WBS, you have a list of the tasks needed
to successfully complete this project.Therefore, you should be able to
look at your tasks and develop a more detailed schedule and budget.The
www.syngress.com
General IT Security Plan • Chapter 10
337

schedule must take into consideration the various constraints as well as
resource scheduling, corporate event coordination (e.g., avoiding an
outage during a press conference or VIP tour of the facilities) and task
dependencies.
Projects with more milestones tend to be more successful than those
with fewer milestones.Add milestones as checkpoints throughout your
project, so that you can keep the team focused on the next steps and you
can measure progress more effectively.
Once you’ve concluded these tasks, you’re ready to launch, manage,
and close out the project.

Chapter 10 • General IT Security Plan

Summary
In this chapter, we looked in detail at how to develop a security project
plan for a security assessment and audit project. It should form the foun-
dation of any IT security planning process, whether you undertake the
project as a standalone project or as part of a larger corporate IT security
project plan. We looked at different ways to view the security assessment
as a whole, including looking at the perimeter systems, internal network,
server and host systems, applications and databases, and data. It’s important
to understand the elements that comprise an assessment, which typically
fall into the vulnerability scanning, pen testing, and risk assessment with
the caveat that any pen testing should be limited in scope prior to imple-
menting a security project.The audit function includes auditing physical,
technological, and administrative policies and procedures. We also looked
brieﬂy at access control, authentication, and auditing as part of our overall
security assessment, and will re-visit some of these topics brieﬂy in our
operational security project plan. Finally, we developed a security project
plan that includes a problem statement and a mission statement, potential
solutions, the selected solution, and the high-level objectives. We also
developed other project details including the skills required, the WBS, the
project risks, and the assumptions.
At this point, you should have a solid start on your general IT security
project plan focused on assessment, testing, and auditing. While this initial
project plan will not be your end-point, it should give you a reasonable
start on deﬁning and planning a security project plan customized to your
company’s unique situation.
Solutions Fast Track
IT Security Assessment and Audit
 A security assessment and audit is a typical starting place for any
IT security project.
www.syngress.com
General IT Security Plan • Chapter 10
339

 People, processes, and technology must all interact effectively to
maintain and enhance security.
 It’s often helpful to categorize the components that should be
included in your assessment. One way to parse these out is:
policies, procedures and training; physical security; perimeter;
network conﬁguration; servers and hosts; applications and
database; and data.
 The types of assessments usually include vulnerability scanning,
pen testing, and risk assessment.
 Pen testing prior to implementing a security plan should be
limited and very focused. Gaining access through an open door
doesn’t prove the locks don’t work.
 Types of auditing include authentication, access control, and
auditing (at a systems level).
 An impact analysis helps deﬁne what would happen if these
vulnerabilities or weaknesses occurred.This can help you
prioritize activities and expenditures.
Authentication
 Authentication proves the identity of an entity trying to gain
access to network resources.
 There are many different kinds of authentication schemes
available today.They span many different network types, operating
systems, and devices.
 Authentication is managed through a variety of methods and
each should be assessed and tested during this project.
Access Control
 Access control limits access to devices, resources, and data in the
organization, based on pre-existing rules and policies.

 Access control can be developed on several levels, including
physical, local, and remote.
 Testing access control spans all systems and networks, and requires
a thorough audit of processes, procedures, and conﬁguration data.
Auditing
 Auditing is used in two ways with regard to this project.There is
the task of auditing current security settings and there is the
ongoing activity of auditing key network activities.
 Auditing current security settings includes reviewing physical,
technical, and administrative policies.
 Auditing should also include a thorough review of processes and
procedures, operational issues, and any legal and reporting issues.
Attacks
 Your vulnerability scan and pen testing should include various
known attack types.
 Your plans should also include an assessment of your ﬁrm’s attack
footprint and plans for reducing that footprint.
 Attacks can be non-intrusive or intrusive. Non-intrusive attacks
typically involve gathering information in preparation for an
intrusive attack.
 Intrusive attacks typically include stealing, modifying, or
destroying critical data or systems.
 A list of attacks as well as the likelihood of or vulnerability to
various attacks should be included in the security project plan, to
ensure a comprehensive plan and to document what should be
included.

Assessment and Audit Report
 Once you’ve completed your assessment, testing, and auditing
activities, you will need to generate a ﬁndings report.
 Remember that the data contained in this report enumerates
your company’s vulnerabilities, and may become a legal
document. Handle this document with extreme care and
maintain close control over it.
 Include the following items in your report:
■
Deﬁne what steps were taken
■
Report the results of the steps taken (vulnerabilities and
weaknesses found)
■
Deﬁne the criticality of ﬁndings
■
Describe mitigation plans
■
Deﬁne owners, timelines, and deliverables.
General IT Security Project Parameters
 As with any project, your planning process should begin with
clearly deﬁning the problem statement, mission statement, and
high-level objectives
 After deﬁning the basic elements, you and your team should look
at all potential solutions and then select the optimal solution. If
you don’t look at all potential solutions, you might inadvertently
overlook an excellent but somewhat unconventional solution.
 An assessment and auditing project has a very speciﬁc set of
requirements. Carefully deﬁne functional and technical
requirements to ensure you create a thorough assessment plan.
 The scope of your assessment and audit plan may be part of a
larger corporate IT project plan, or it may be a standalone
project. Clearly deﬁne the scope by describing what is and is not
included.

 You won’t have enough detail at this juncture to commit to
scope, schedule, budget, or quality, but you should begin deﬁning
these so they can be reﬁned as you gather additional information.

personnel.Your company’s future may rest on the skills and
expertise of the people you select, therefore, be diplomatic but
honest in your assessment.
General IT Security Project Plan
 Your WBS should be developed from your high-level objectives
speciﬁc to assessment, testing, and auditing activities.
 Include reporting and close out activities in your WBS.
 Risks in security assessment and auditing type projects require
that speciﬁc attention is paid to the risks of not ﬁnding
vulnerabilities and weaknesses, and the risks of ﬁnding those
weaknesses and not addressing them adequately.
 Assumptions should be examined and well-documented, because
the success of the project ultimately rests on the assumptions you
make about the project and its environment.
 Assumptions can also include critical success factors. If a budget
of $100,000 has been discussed and you believe it is critical to
the success of the project, state that as an assumption.
 Once you’ve developed a detailed WBS, you can hone your
schedule and budget.
 Be sure to include reporting and close out activities, and roll
these into your corporate IT security project plan, if appropriate.

Introduction
Infrastructure security is at the root of your entire corporate security
plan. Other individual security area plans (ISAPs) may overlap with your
infrastructure security plan to some extent. For example, a wireless net-
work is part of your infrastructure, but it’s also a large enough area to be
addressed in a separate project plan.You’ll need to ensure that your cor-
porate IT security project and your ISAPs cover all the bases, but be
aware that there are overlapping areas that should be clearly delineated if
you’re working on several projects in parallel.You don’t want project
teams wrestling over ownership of one part of your network or another.
In this chapter, we’ll look at the basic infrastructure components and how
to secure them; then we’ll create a project plan utilizing this information.
Infrastructure Security Assessment
There are two distinct processes: audit and assessment.An assessment is
intended to look for issues and vulnerabilities that can be mitigated,
remediated, or eliminated prior to a security breach.An audit is normally
conducted after an assessment with the goal of measuring compliance
with policies and procedures.Typically, someone is held accountable for
audit results. Some people don’t like the term auditing; perhaps it’s too
reminiscent of ol’ Uncle Sam scouring through your tax return from
three years ago when you claimed that one vacation as a business trip
because you talked to your boss on your cell phone while waiting at the
shuttle to your beachfront hotel.Though the terms assessment and audit
are often used interchangeably, in this chapter we focus on assessments.
As we’ve discussed throughout this book, there are three primary
components of IT security: people, process, and technology.A balanced
approach addresses all three areas, because focusing on one area to the
exclusion of others creates security holes. People, including senior man-
agement, must buy into the importance of security, and they must under-
stand and participate in their role in maintaining security. Process includes
all the practices and procedures that occur and reoccur to keep the net-

work secure.Technology obviously includes all hardware and software
that comprises the network infrastructure. Part of the technology assess-
ment required to assess and harden infrastructure security includes
deploying the right technological solutions for your ﬁrm and not the
“one size ﬁts all” or the “it was all we could afford” solution. In IT, we
often focus a disproportionate amount of time and energy on securing
the technology and overlook the importance of both people and process
to the overall security environment.
To secure your infrastructure, you need to understand its building
blocks.These include:
■
Network perimeter protection
■
Internal network protection
■
Intrusion monitoring and prevention
■
Host and server conﬁguration
■
Protection against malicious code 
■
Incident response capabilities
■
Security policies and procedures
■
Employee awareness and training
■
Physical security and monitoring
We’ll discuss policies, procedures, and training in the chapter on opera-
tional security later in this book, so we won’t discuss that material here.
We can look at the infrastructure security assessment in three seg-
ments, as shown in Figure 11.1.
www.syngress.com
IT Infrastructure Security Plan • Chapter 11
347

Figure 11.1 Infrastructure Assessment Overview
Internal Environment
Security assessments should begin by looking at the overall environment
in which security must be implemented, since security does not exist in a
vacuum. Looking at the relative importance of your company’s informa-
tion is a good starting point, because you need to ﬁnd the right balance
between security and information criticality.As part of that analysis, you
also need to look at the impact of a network infrastructure intrusion and
what that would cost to defend and repair.You need to deﬁne the various
systems you have in place and look at how information ﬂows through
your organization to understand the infrastructure you’re trying to pro-
tect. Finally, you need to create an initial assessment of scope to deﬁne
what is and is not included in your project. We’ll look at scope later in the
chapter, when we begin developing our project plan.
Information Criticality
It’s important to begin by looking at information criticality. We’ve dis-
cussed this topic throughout this book, and it will continue to be a
common theme because there’s really no point in securing something

that no one wants. It’s why a new Lexus RX-330 comes with a lo-jack
system, but a 1993 Dodge Dart with serious body damage is not likely
to need any protection (in fact, there might be an economic beneﬁt to
having such a vehicle stolen—no offense intended to any 1993 Dodge
Dart owners). Information criticality is an assessment of what your net-
work holds and how important that is in the overall scheme of things.
Not all data is created equal, and if your company manufactures steel
troughs for horse feed, there’s a good chance your network data is not
nearly as interesting to a potential attacker as the data in an online stock
brokerage ﬁrm or a bank or credit card processing house network.
Therefore, you need to look at the criticality of your information and
decide how much you’re willing to spend to secure that information. No
one ever wants a security breach, but it would not make good business
sense to spend $15 million to secure a network for a company that pulls
in $5 million annually and doesn’t store sensitive personal data such as
credit card numbers or medical records.That said, just because your
company makes $5 million annually doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t look
seriously at the criticality of your data, to be sure you don’t have exces-
sive exposure. If you are storing credit card numbers or medical records,
you’d better be sure your security solutions are up to standards, because
your legal liability could signiﬁcantly outstrip that $5 million annually in
a big hurry.
Impact Analysis
You’ll notice as you read the chapters for the individual security area
plans that some of this information overlaps. It’s hard to perform an
impact analysis on an infrastructure breach without also seeing how it
would impact your wireless network components, your Web site, or your
policies and procedures. However, in looking at the impact to your infras-
tructure, you’ll need to understand how a breach could impact the very
foundation of your organization.The impact analysis should include:
■
Cost of network infrastructure—failure (downtime) Server
down, database server down, routers down, etc.
www.syngress.com
IT Infrastructure Security Plan • Chapter 11
349

■
Cost of network infrastructure—unavailable (slow or
unresponsive) Denial-of-service attacks, packet ﬂooding, etc.
■
Cost of network infrastructure breach—data conﬁden-
tiality, integrity, availability Man-in-the-middle, spooﬁng,
phishing, etc.
■
Cost to company reputation Lost sales, lost customers, loss of
long-term business relationships.
■
Cost to company Cost of remediation, cost of litigation.
You should combine information criticality with the ﬁndings of your
impact analysis to form a clear picture of what you’re trying to protect
and why. When you understand the impact, you can see where the
important areas are in your organization, and you can use this informa-
tion, in part, to prioritize your approach to securing the network.
System Deﬁnitions
Infrastructure systems clearly include the “backbone” services, including
DHCP servers, DNS servers, Directory Services servers, e-mail servers,
database servers, ﬁrewalls, DMZs, routers/switches, operating systems, Web
servers, and security applications (antivirus, antispyware, IDS/IPS, etc.). If
it’s helpful, you can also look at your systems from the OSI model per-
spective—from the physical layer all the way up through the application
layer, whatever makes the most sense to you and your team.
Creating (or updating) network diagrams can also be included in the
system deﬁnitions overview, since the way everything ﬁts together is part
of understanding the whole.
Information Flow
One area that is sometimes overlooked in the assessment phase is the ﬂow
of information through the infrastructure.This area can be used in con-
junction with your systems deﬁnitions to help map your network and to
discover the key areas that need to be protected and how an attacker
would get to those assets.
www.syngress.com
350
Chapter 11 • IT Infrastructure Security Plan

It sometimes helps to look at information ﬂow from different per-
spectives. For example, how does information from a user computer ﬂow?
How does DNS or DHCP trafﬁc ﬂow through the network? How is
external trafﬁc coming into the network managed, and where and how
does it enter? How is trafﬁc leaving the network for the public network
(Internet) managed? Creating a map of your network infrastructure and
information ﬂow will help you visualize your network and identify
potential weak spots.
Scope
You might want to limit the scope of your infrastructure security project
for a variety of reasons. While you’re looking at your internal environ-
ment, you might choose to limit the scope.“Scoping” is often done at
this point when you’re engaging an external security consultant.
However, if you’re doing this work internally, you may limit your scope
here, or you may choose to do a full assessment and then limit the scope
after you see what’s what.
People and Process
Clearly, people and processes impact network security in a big way. Most
security breaches occur from the inside, not the outside, despite the
media’s sensationalized focus on external security breaches.The people in
your organization can be your defenders or your downfall, depending on
how they approach security. Savvy, well-informed users can augment the
technical security measures by avoiding becoming victims of social engi-
neering, by reporting suspicious activity, by avoiding responding to
phishing e-mail, or by not leaving their computer logged in and unat-
tended.All the security in the world can’t prevent problems if users are
not pulling their weight.There are many ways to inform and involve
users, and unfortunately, many IT departments don’t leverage these
opportunities very successfully, because they often fall victim to a “user as
pain in the hind quarters” mentality. Let’s look at how users and organiza-
tional processes should be reviewed during an infrastructure assessment.
www.syngress.com
IT Infrastructure Security Plan • Chapter 11
351

User Proﬁles
What kinds of users do you have? Where and how do they work? If you
begin by looking at your user population, you will see segments that have
higher and lower risk proﬁles.The clerk in the mailroom might only have
access to e-mail and the mailroom application, but does he or she also
have Internet access and the ability to download and install programs?
What about the marketing staff who travel worldwide? What kinds of
information do they keep on their laptops (usernames, passwords, domain
names, sensitive documents, contacts, and the like), and how does this
impact your network security?
Users can be categorized in whatever ways work for you in your
organization, but here’s a list of potential risks by employee type, to get
you thinking:
■
Executive High-proﬁle targets, often not extremely “tech
savvy,” potentially easy to get information about (from press
releases, public ﬁlings, legal ﬁlings, and so on).
■
Director High-proﬁle targets, may travel extensively with sensi-
tive information, may need to connect to the network in a
variety of insecure locations.
■
Finance, marketing, HR, legal Access to extremely sensitive
data, may be high-proﬁle targets due to their access to sensitive
data, may travel extensively and be desirable targets of social 
engineering.
■
IT staff Access to network resources, ability to grant/deny
access, potentially desirable targets of social engineering (espe-
cially via help desk), highly desirable targets (IT usernames and
passwords with administrative privileges are the Holy Grail for
hackers).
■
Users Access to sensitive company information, often targets of
social engineering.
www.syngress.com
352
Chapter 11 • IT Infrastructure Security Plan

In addition to these categories, you may have user groups deﬁned in
your network security management system (which manages access con-
trol) that you want to use. Microsoft deﬁnes users as administrators, power
users, and the like, and that might also work for you.Again, the point is
to use a categorization method that’s meaningful to the way your com-
pany and your existing network infrastructure are organized, so you can
understand the risks users bring into the organization and the strategies
for keeping the network secure in light of the way various users work.
Policies and Procedures
We won’t spend a lot of time discussing policies and procedures in this
chapter; we’ll focus on them in an upcoming chapter on operational
security.As we’ve discussed, no single security topic exists in a vacuum or
silo, and as you move through your project planning, you’ll notice areas of
intersection and overlap.There are few hard-and-fast rules about where
these overlapping elements should be placed; the important factor is to be
sure they are included someplace.
Infrastructure policies and procedures touch on the day-to-day opera-
tions of the IT staff, including the way security is monitored (auditing
functions, log ﬁles, alerts) and how it is maintained (backups, updates,
upgrades). Policies regarding user behavior are also crucial to ensuring
that the network infrastructure remains safe. Finally, corporate policies
regarding the use of data, computer and electronic equipment, and
building access, to name just three, are areas that should be reviewed and
revised to support and enhance security across the enterprise. For more
speciﬁc information on polices and procedures, see Chapter 13,
“Operational Security.”
Organizational Needs
The internal environment is shaped by the organization’s business proﬁle,
including the type of business, the nature of sales and marketing func-
tions, the types of customers, the kinds of employees, and the ﬂow of
work through the company. What does your company require from the
network services you provide, and how can these needs be secured? If
www.syngress.com
IT Infrastructure Security Plan • Chapter 11
353

you believe your organization’s network, data, and computer needs are
being met, delineate what they are and check with a few users to see if
you’re on the mark or if you’re really off-center by a wide margin. Make
sure that you understand how the network ﬁts into the organization, not
the other way around, and then design your security solution around it.
Regulatory/Compliance
Any infrastructure assessment and security plan must incorporate regula-
tory and compliance requirements.These vary greatly from state to state
and country to country, and as you’re probably well aware, keeping up
with them can be more than a full-time job. Many companies are hiring
compliance ofﬁcers whose primary job is to manage corporate compli-
ance. If your company has a compliance ofﬁcer, you should certainly
make sure he or she is a member of your IT project team, at least during
the deﬁnition phase, when you’re developing your functional and tech-
nical requirements, since these are often the method by which compli-
ance occurs. We’ve included a short list here with a few Web site links,
but it’s not exhaustive; you should seek legal advice regarding regulatory
and compliance requirements for your ﬁrm if you don’t have a knowl-
edgeable and experienced compliance ofﬁcer in place.

Common Compliance Standards
There are numerous compliance issues facing organizations today.

Technology
The technology assessment involves the three elements: people, process,
and technology. However, the technology portion of the assessment will
probably take up 80% of your time due to the vast number of technolog-
ical components involved in securing the infrastructure. Servers and hosts
must be updated, patched, and secured.Applications must be updated,
patched, and secured.The perimeter of your network must be secured,
tested, and monitored. Remote access and wireless access must be
secured, tested, and monitored. Data traveling across the network needs to
be secured against a variety of attack types, which is done through var-
ious protocols at different network layers, depending on where the data
originates, where it’s headed, and what it contains. We’ll spend the
remainder of the chapter looking at the technology components of infras-
tructure security, holding off discussing the policies and procedures
(which impact user behavior and the people aspect) until a later chapter.

Establishing Baselines
The point of performing these assessments is not to prove that your net-
work is secure or insecure but to ﬁnd out exactly what level of security
you actually have and to establish baselines. When you know the starting
point, you can improve security incrementally and document it as you go.
Baselines are created by establishing a known starting point, in this case
your current settings.
It might be tempting to correct problems as you perform this assess-
ment, but it’s not the best way to proceed.As you know, making a conﬁg-
uration change at Point A can cause a ripple effect through your network
and show up at Point C in a strange and unexpected way.As you develop
your project plan, be clear with your project team that they need to doc-
ument existing conﬁgurations, settings, versions, and so on, without
making changes. If a team member ﬁnds a serious security hole, it should
be brought to your attention immediately for action.The point is that if a
serious problem is found, it should be quickly addressed but not in an ad
hoc manner. It should be assessed and addressed in a calm, rational,
thoughtful manner, and possibly incorporated into your project plan.
Does that mean that you wait until your project planning is complete to
address a serious security hole? Absolutely not.You should, however, use a
well thought out strategy for addressing it outside the project planning
cycle, then document the changes and incorporate them into your project
plan. What you want to avoid is having every person looking at the net-
work making small tweaks here and there to “tighten up security” as they
go, because you’ll end up with a mess at the end of your evaluation
period. Serious problems should be brought to your immediate, and
minor issues should be well documented.
Addressing Risks to the Corporate Network
Once you have created a prioritized list of risks to your network as well
as their associated costs, your next step will be to determine a course of
action in handling each risk. When deciding how to address risks to your
network, you typically have one of four options:
www.syngress.com
356
Chapter 11 • IT Infrastructure Security Plan

■
Avoidance You can avoid a risk by changing the scope of the
project so that the risk in question no longer applies, or change
the features of the software to do the same. In most cases, this is
not a viable option, since eliminating a network service such as
e-mail to avoid risks from viruses would usually not be seen as an
appropriate measure. (Network services exist for a reason; your
job as a security professional is to make those services as secure as
possible.) One example of how avoidance would be a useful risk
management tactic is a case where a company has a single server
that acts as both a Web server and a database server housing con-
ﬁdential personnel records, when there is no interaction whatso-
ever between the Web site and personnel information. In this
scenario, purchasing a second server to house the employee
database, removing the personnel database from the Web server
entirely, and placing the employee database server on a private
network segment with no contact to the Internet would be a
way of avoiding Web-based attacks on personnel records, since
this plan of action “removes” a feature of the Web server (the
personnel ﬁles) entirely.
■
Transference You can transfer a risk by moving the responsi-
bility to a third party.The most well-known example of this solu-
tion is purchasing some type of insurance—let’s say ﬂood
insurance—for the contents of your server room.Although the
purchase of this insurance does not diminish the likelihood that a
ﬂood will occur in your server room, it does ensure that the
monetary cost of the damage will be borne by the insurance
company in return for your policy premiums. It’s important to
note that transference is not a 100-percent solution—in the ﬂood
example, your company will likely still incur some ﬁnancial loss
or decreased productivity in the time it takes you to restore your
server room to working order.As with most risk management
tactics, bringing the risk exposure down to zero is usually an
unattainable goal.
www.syngress.com
IT Infrastructure Security Plan • Chapter 11
357

■
Mitigation This is what most IT professionals think of when
implementing a risk management solution. Mitigation involves
taking some positive action to reduce the likelihood that an
attack will occur or to reduce the potential damage that would
be caused by an attack, without removing the resource entirely, as
is the case with avoidance. Patching servers, disabling unneeded
services, and installing a ﬁrewall are some solutions that fall under
the heading of risk mitigation.
■
Acceptance After you have delineated all the risks to your
infrastructure that can be avoided, transferred, or mitigated, you
are still left with a certain amount of risk that you won’t be able
to reduce any further without seriously impacting your business
(taking an e-mail server ofﬂine as a means to combat viruses, for
example).Your ﬁnal option is one of acceptance, where you
decide that the residual risks to your network have reached an
acceptable level, and you choose to monitor the network for any
signs of new or increased risks that might require more action
later.
There is no one right way to address all risks to your infrastructure;
you’ll most likely take a blended approach to security.There are some
risks you absolutely need to avoid, other risks you can reasonably transfer
or mitigate, and still others that you simply accept because the cost of
avoiding them is just not worth it.
Business Intelligence…
Depth in Defense
Depth in defense is a key concept to understand before heading into an
infrastructure security project. The concept is a fairly straightforward
one: Security comes not from one source but from many layers of pro-
tection. Almost any attacker can ﬁnd a way in through a single-defense
www.syngress.com
358
Chapter 11 • IT Infrastructure Security Plan
Continued

system, but it’s much more difﬁcult (but not impossible) to ﬁnd a way
in through a maze of security measures. When security measures are
used in combination, it’s like having a deadbolt, a padlock, a keypad, a
card reader, and a biometric scanner attached to the network. An
attacker can get through one or two, maybe even three, but it’s the
fourth and ﬁfth layers that ﬁnally stop the would-be intruder and cause
him or her to look for another, easier target. In the world of IT security,
nothing is 100-percent secure unless it’s powered off and locked in an
isolated box, at which point it becomes completely useless.
Understanding the depth-in-defense approach will help you as you try to
evaluate the measures you should take to secure your network infras-
tructure. You may choose to implement something less iron-clad (at a
drastically lower cost) in one area, knowing that the “layering” effect
will likely give you a strong enough level of defense against most known
threats.
External Environment
The external environment includes the changes in technology that might
impact your business, the changes in the regulatory and legal environ-
ments that could impact your business, and the changing landscape of
threats to your network. It’s not a static picture; you’ll need to implement
policies and procedures that allow you and your IT staff to remain up to
date with these changes so that you can continually monitor, assess, and
address these changes in a proactive and positive manner.
We’ve talked about the legal implications of compliance and the
importance of understanding those compliance issues when you’re plan-
ning your IT security project. Because these issues are numerous, industry
speciﬁc, and ever changing, we’re not going to get into speciﬁc compli-
ance data in this book. We recap some of the more common ones in this
section, just in case you missed them earlier. We’ve also provided some
Web links for you to learn more about these standards.There may be
serious legal issues involved with compliance and noncompliance, so be
sure to check with your ﬁrm’s legal counsel to determine the regulations
that apply to your ﬁrm.You might want to complete the internal assess-
ment prior to contacting your attorney, so that you have a clear under-

standing of the kinds of information your network stores and the criti-
cality of that information. For example, if your company recently started
storing segments of people’s medical records as part of a new business
partnership with another ﬁrm, you will most likely have to comply with
HIPAA standards (and possibly others). Recent changes to your com-
pany’s business may have pulled you into areas in which regulation and
compliance are mandatory, so be sure to do a full assessment here.
Threats
Predicting network threats and analyzing the risks they present to your
infrastructure are among the cornerstones of the network security design
process. Understanding the types of threats that your network will face
helps you in designing appropriate countermeasures and in obtaining the
necessary money and resources to create a secure network framework.
Members of an organization’s management structure will likely be resis-
tant to spending money on a threat that they don’t understand; this pro-
cess will also help them understand the very real consequences of
network threats so they can make informed decisions about the types of
measures to implement. In this section, we discuss some common net-
work attacks that you will likely face when you’re designing a secure net-
work and how each of these attacks can adversely affect your network.
When classifying network threats, many developers and security ana-
lysts have taken to using a model called STRIDE, which is an acronym
for the following terms:
■
Spooﬁng identity These include attacks that involve illegally
accessing and using account information that isn’t yours, such as
shoulder-surﬁng someone’s password while he types it on his
keyboard.This type of attack affects the conﬁdentiality of data.
■
Tampering with data These attacks involve a malicious modi-
ﬁcation of data, interfering with the integrity of an organization’s
data.The most common of these is a man-in-the-middle
(MITM) attack, where a third party intercepts communications
between two legitimate hosts and tampers with the information
www.syngress.com
360
Chapter 11 • IT Infrastructure Security Plan

as it is sent back and forth.This is akin to sending an e-mail to
Mary that says,“The meeting is at 3:00 P.M.”, but a malicious
attacker intercepts and changes the message to,“The meeting has
been cancelled.”
■
Repudiation These threats occur when a user can perform a
malicious action against a network resource and then deny that
she did so, and the owners or administrators of the data have no
way of proving otherwise.A repudiation threat can attack any por-
tion of the conﬁdentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) triad.
■
Information disclosure This occurs when information is made
available to individuals who should not have access to it.
Information disclosure can occur through improperly applied
network permissions that allow a user to read a conﬁdential ﬁle
or give an intruder the ability to read data being transmitted
between two networked computers. Information disclosure affects
the conﬁdentiality of your company’s data and resources.
■
Denial of service So-called DoS attacks do not attempt to alter
a company’s data; rather, they attack a network by denying access
to valid users, by ﬂooding a Web server with phony requests so
that legitimate users cannot access it, for example. DoS attacks
affect the availability of your organization’s data and resources.A
new variation is a distributed DoS (DDoS), also called a zombie
net or zombie attack.
■
Elevation of privilege This type of attack takes place when an
unprivileged, nonadministrative user gains administrative or “root
level” access to an entire system, usually through a ﬂaw in the
system software. When this occurs, an attacker has the ability to
alter or even destroy any data that he ﬁnds, since he is acting with
administrative privileges.
This type of threat affects all portions of the CIA triad, since the
attacker can access, change, and remove any data that he or she sees ﬁt.
When you are analyzing a potential network threat, try to remember the

STRIDE acronym as a means of classifying and reacting to the threat.You
can use the STRIDE model throughout the life of your corporate network
when you’re designing and maintaining security policies and procedures.
Recognizing External Threats
Now that we’ve discussed a model for classifying network threats, we can
look at some of the common attacks in more detail. Entire books can be
(and have been) written that solely discuss the kinds of threats that we
look at in this section, so we’ll be giving you a “birds-eye” view of the
kinds of attacks that your network security design will need to guard
against.
Denial-of-Service Attacks
As we’ve already mentioned, the DoS attack (and its ﬁrst cousin, the
DDoS attack) works to disrupt services on a network so that legitimate
users cannot access resources they need. Some examples include attempts
to disrupt the connection between two speciﬁc machines, or more com-
monly, attempts to ﬂood an entire network with trafﬁc, thereby over-
loading the network and preventing legitimate trafﬁc from being
transmitted.There can also be instances in which an illegitimate use of
resources can result in denial of service. For example, if an intruder uses a
vulnerability in your FTP server to upload and store illegal software, this
can consume all available disk space on the FTP server and prevent legiti-
mate users from storing their ﬁles.A DoS attack can effectively disable a
single computer or an entire network.
A common venue of attack for DoS is against an organization’s net-
work bandwidth and connectivity; the attacker’s goal is to prevent other
machines from communicating due to the trafﬁc ﬂood.An example of
this type of attack is the SYN ﬂood attack. In a SYN ﬂood, the attacker
begins to establish a connection to the victim machine but in such a way
that the connection is never completed. Since even the most powerful
server has only a certain amount of memory and number processor cycles
to devote to its workload, legitimate connection attempts can be denied
www.syngress.com
362
Chapter 11 • IT Infrastructure Security Plan

while the victim machine is trying to complete these fake “half-open”
connections.
Another common DoS is the so-called Ping of Death, where an
attacker sends so many PING requests to a target machine that it is over-
loaded and unable to process legitimate network requests.An intruder
might also attempt to consume network resources in other ways,
including generating a massive number of e-mail messages, intentionally
generating system errors that need to be included in Event Viewer logs,
or misusing FTP directories or network shares to overload available disk
space. Basically, anything that allows data, whether on a network cable or
hard drive, to be written at will (without any type of control mechanism)
can create a DoS when the attack has exhausted a system’s ﬁnite
resources.
Distributed Denial-of-Service Attacks
Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks are a relatively new develop-
ment, made possible (and attractive to attackers) by the ever-expanding
number of machines that are attached to the Internet.The ﬁrst major wave
of DDoS attacks on the Internet appeared in early 2000 and targeted such
major e-commerce and news sites as Yahoo!, eBay,Amazon, Datek, and
CNN. In each case, the Web sites belonging to these companies were
unreachable for several hours at a time, causing a severe disruption to their
online presence and effectiveness. Many more DDoS attacks have occurred
since then, affecting networks and Web sites large and small.
WARNING
Most publicity surrounding DDoS attacks has focused on Web servers
as a target, but remember that any computer attached to the Internet
can fall victim to the effects of a DDoS attack. This can include every-
thing from file servers or e-mail servers to your users’ desktop 
workstations.
www.syngress.com
IT Infrastructure Security Plan • Chapter 11
363

The DDoS attack begins with a human attacker using a small number
of computers, called masters.The master computers use network scanners
to ﬁnd as many weakly secured computers as it can, and they use system
vulnerabilities (usually well-known ones) to install a small script or a ser-
vice (referred to in the UNIX world as a daemon) onto the insecure com-
puter.This machine becomes a zombie and can now be triggered by the
master computer to attack any computer or network attached to the
Internet. Once the organizer of the DDoS attack has a sufﬁcient number
of zombie machines under control, he or she will use the “zombi-ﬁed”
machines to send a stream of packets to a designated target computer or
network, called the victim. For most of these attacks, these packets are
directed at the victim machine.The distributed nature of the DDoS
attack makes it extremely difﬁcult to track down the person or persons
who began it; the actual attacks are coming from zombie machines, and
the owners of these machines are often not even aware that their
machines have been compromised. Making matters even more difﬁcult,
most network packets used in DDoS attacks use forged source addresses,
which means that they are essentially lying about where the attack is
coming from.
Viruses,Worms, and Trojan Horses
Viruses,Trojans, and worms are quite possibly the most disruptive of all
security threats that we discuss in this section.These three types of
threats, working alone or in combination, can alter or delete data ﬁles and
executable programs on your network shares, ﬂood e-mail servers and
network connections with malicious trafﬁc, and even create a “back
door” into your systems that can allow a remote attacker to entirely take
over control of a computer.You’ll often hear these three terms used inter-
changeably, but each type of threat is slightly different.A virus is a piece of
code that will alter an existing ﬁle and then use that alteration to recreate
itself many times over.A worm simply makes copies of itself over and over
again for the purpose of exhausting available system resources.A worm
can target both hard drive space and processor cycles.

Business Intelligence...
Even Symantec Is Vulnerable
On May 24, 2006, a research company, eEye Digital Security, announced
it had discovered a high severity security vulnerability in the Symantec
antivirus program used by 200 million computers worldwide. The vul-
nerability was characterized as severe because it didn’t require any user
interaction to be exploited, making it highly susceptible to worm
attacks. The irony is, of course, that this vulnerability was discovered not
a week after the CEO of Symantec slammed Microsoft’s “security mono-
culture” as a source of vulnerability. Since no one single product or
defense will provide adequate security in today’s threat environment,
this ﬁnding underscores the need for depth in defense. And, as
Symantec’s CEO discovered, it also underscores the danger of tossing
rocks at security “glass houses.”
Software Vulnerabilities
Some network attacks target vulnerabilities in the way that a software
application or entire operating system has been programmed. For
example, a buffer overﬂow attack occurs when a malicious user sends
more data to a program than it knows how to handle. For example, we’ve
all seen Web forms that ask you to ﬁll in personal information: ﬁrst name,
last name, telephone number, and so forth.A careless developer might
program the “First Name” ﬁeld to only be able to handle 10 characters;
that is, a name that is 10 letters long. If the Web application does not
check for buffer overﬂows, an attacker can input a long string of gib-
berish into the First Name ﬁeld in an attempt to cause a buffer overﬂow
error.At this point, the attacker could even embed the name of an exe-
cutable ﬁle into that long string of text and actually pass commands to
the system as if he or she were sitting at the server console itself.A similar
software vulnerability is a format string vulnerability that would allow an
www.syngress.com
IT Infrastructure Security Plan • Chapter 11
365

attacker to insert random data into a ﬁle or database, including malicious
code that can be executed against the server as though the attacker were
sitting right in front of the keyboard.
Another attack that is speciﬁcally common to Web and FTP servers is
a directory traversal vulnerability.This type of vulnerability allows a user to
gain access to a directory on a server that he hasn’t been speciﬁcally given
permissions to, by virtue of having permissions to a parent or child direc-
tory. Say that someone goes to the URL www.airplanes.com/biplanes/
cessna/model1.html. He decides to manually change this URL (in other
words, not following an <HREF> link on the site itself) to www.air-
planes.com/biplanes/piper, to see if the directory structure holds any
information there. If the Web site hasn’t been properly patched and con-
ﬁgured with the correct security settings, the user might ﬁnd that he now
has access to every single ﬁle in the piper/ directory. Even worse, he can
once again execute a command from the Web browser by changing the
URL to something like www.airplanes.com/biplanes/piper/del%20*.*.
(%20 is used in HTML to represent a space, so that command would
read del *.* on a regular command line.) 
Another common attack also occurred in NetMeeting and Windows
Media Player some time ago, where an attacker could insert special char-
acters during a ﬁle transfer that would allow him to browse an unsus-
pecting user’s hard drive directory structure.
Unfortunately, the breadth and depth of software vulnerabilities grows
almost daily due to the wonderfully wide variety of applications available
on the market.This variety provides new and useful functionality to users,
but it obviously can create headaches for IT staff just trying to keep up.
Nontechnical Attacks
A ﬁnal category of attack that we’ll discuss here are those that use less
technical means to circumvent network security. Social engineering attacks
rely on an unsuspecting user’s lack of security consciousness. In some
cases, the attacker will rely on someone’s goodwill, using a tactic like,
“I’ve really got to get this done and I don’t have access to these ﬁles. Can
you help me?” (This works because most of us, at heart, really want to be
www.syngress.com
366
Chapter 11 • IT Infrastructure Security Plan

helpful to those around us.) Other social engineering attacks use a more
threat-based approach, insisting that the attacker is the secretary for Mr.
Big-Shot VP who needs his password reset right away and heaven help
you if you keep him waiting.This method relies on the assumption that a
show of authority will cause someone without adequate training to
bypass security procedures, to keep the “big-shot important user/client”
happy. Since social engineering attacks are nontechnical in nature, the
measures required to defend against them are more administrative than
anything else. It’s critical to have well-understood security policies in
place that apply to everyone, regardless of their position in your company.
This will assist in preventing an attacker from circumventing security pro-
cedures because a help desk or other staff member is unaware of them.
We discuss user education and awareness campaigns later in this book.

Hackers Turn to Security Software
An article in the Washington Post in late 2005 highlighted a new and
growing trend among hackers: the new focus on security software used
by millions of end users. In the “old days,” hackers focused on attacking
operating systems and exploiting known vulnerabilities. Although that
still occurs, the new threat front is in the very software you rely on to
secure your computer from the bad guys. As hackers look for and exploit

these vulnerabilities, they expose users to a whole new realm of risk.
Operating systems such as Windows and Linux are now regularly
updated and patched, but security software programs typically were
only updating virus signature ﬁles, not the program itself. Now security
software program makers are ﬁnding their products under attack and
are having to respond as operating system companies once did.

Network Security Checklist
This section is a lengthy one and is intended to provide you with a thor-
ough review of the types of things you should review, assess, and think
about when you prepare your infrastructure security project plan. Even
though we’ve created a detailed list, there’s always a chance there are
additional elements your plan will need. Certainly, there’s also a strong
likelihood that there are things in these checklists that you don’t have and
don’t need.That’s okay.The point is to try to help you think through all
the details you possibly can about your network infrastructure, to ensure
that you are thorough and don’t leave any stone unturned.At the end of
this process, you may decide not to address some aspects of infrastructure
security, or you might choose to work on some of these items in a Phase
2 or Phase 3 project plan.This should give you a great start in thinking
all this through.
We’ve divided the infrastructure project into four main areas, though
you may choose to parse it out differently. We’ll look at devices and
media and ways to secure network devices (excluding servers and user
computers) and the network media. Media could mean secure network
area storage devices (NAS), backup media, or other storage devices.The
“Topologies” section includes how you segment the network for security,
including creating DMZs and implementing ﬁrewalls, and how you
secure network trafﬁc. Intrusion detection and prevention systems are
pretty popular these days (for good reason), so we’ll look at best practices
for implementing IDS/IPS that you can utilize in your project plan.
www.syngress.com
IT Infrastructure Security Plan • Chapter 11
369

Finally, we’ll look at system hardening, including hardening infrastructure
servers (DNS, DHCP, and so on), application and database servers, and
other computers on the network. Keep in mind that this is not a “how
to” as much as it is a list of things to consider and include in your project
plan.There are volumes ﬁlled with information on these topics; it would
be far outside the scope of this book to talk about how you do these
things. Our intent is to provide a framework and a solid starting point for
your infrastructure security project-planning process. If you’re not sure
what some of these things are or if you’re uncertain as to how to address
these issues, you’ll need to do further research on these topics.
Devices and Media
Network devices typically include routers, switches, ﬁrewalls, and other
communication devices. We cover these items extensively at the end of
this section (we placed it there because it’s a long, wide-ranging list).The
short story is that routers, switches, and other communication devices
should be:
1. Physically secured Place devices in a locked cabinet, locked
room, and locked building, where possible. Where that’s not pos-
sible, devices should be closely monitored or access should be
controlled or limited.
2. Physically inspected Remove extra cables, disable external
ports, and disconnect unused connections.
3. Hardened Remove unused software, disable unused ports, stop
or uninstall unused protocols and services, disable unused func-
tionality, remove unused user accounts, change default settings,
use strong passwords, and remove or limit all but one administra-
tive account.
4. Monitored Audit, log, and monitor all access to devices, both
physical and logical; monitor all successful logons; monitor all
failed logons; review log ﬁles frequently; and store conﬁguration
data in a safe, secure location.

Chapter 11 • IT Infrastructure Security Plan

5. Encrypted Encrypt sensitive data ﬁles; encrypt and secure all
removable media; create a secure system for handling removable
media, including backup ﬁles; create a log ﬁle to track media
handling; secure removable media in locked, access-controlled
location; and store archives in a secure, off-site location.
Topologies
Network infrastructure security:
1. Create secure boundaries using ﬁrewalls, DMZs, and proxy
servers.
2. Create secure remote access.
3. Create secure wireless access.
4. Implement a segmented network.
5. Implement network trafﬁc security protocols for sensitive net-
work trafﬁc.
6. Deploy network security technologies.
■
Use Encrypting File System (EFS) or similar ﬁle encryption.
■
Require and use strong user authentication, passwords and
account policies.
■
Employ the concept of “least privileges” when assigning user
rights.
Security infrastructure components include routers, proxy servers, ﬁre-
walls, and DMZs. Firewalls are pretty straightforward and can be imple-
mented as hardware or software solutions. Let’s take a side street and take
a quick look at DMZs.
Demilitarized zones, or DMZs, are isolated network segments that typi-
cally sit between the Internet and your network, whether in front of or
behind your ﬁrewall (or between two ﬁrewalls).There are many different
ways to set up a DMZ; again, it’s outside the scope of this book to discuss
the design, implementation, and conﬁguration of a DMZ. However, it
www.syngress.com
IT Infrastructure Security Plan • Chapter 11
371

might be helpful to discuss a few highlights of DMZ design that might
help as you look at implementing or tightening a DMZ for your network.
Designing DMZs
DMZ design, like security design, is always a work in progress.As in secu-
rity planning and analysis, we ﬁnd DMZ design carries great ﬂexibility
and change potential to keep the protection levels we put in place in an
effective state.The ongoing work is required so that the system’s security is
always as high as we can make it within the constraints of time and
budget, while still allowing appropriate users and visitors to access the
information and services we provide.You will ﬁnd that the time and funds
spent in the design process and preparation for the implementation are
very good investments if the process is focused and effective; this will lead
to a high level of success and a good level of protection for your network.
In this section of the chapter, we explore the fundamentals of the
design process. We incorporate the information we discussed in relation
to security and trafﬁc ﬂow to make decisions about how our initial
design should look.Additionally, we’ll build on that information and
review some other areas of concern that could affect the way you design
your DMZ structure.
Design of the DMZ is critically important to the overall protection of
your internal network—and the success of your ﬁrewall and DMZ
deployment.The DMZ design can incorporate sections that isolate
incoming VPN trafﬁc, Web trafﬁc, partner connections, employee con-
nections, and public access to information provided by your organization.
Design of the DMZ structure throughout the organization can protect
internal resources from internal attack.As we discussed in the security
section, it has been well documented that much of the risk of data loss,
corruption, and breach actually exists inside the network perimeter. Our
tendency is to protect assets from external harm but to disregard the dan-
gers that come from our own internal equipment, policies, and
employees.
These attacks or disruptions do not arise solely from disgruntled
employees. Many of the most damaging conditions occur because of
www.syngress.com
372
Chapter 11 • IT Infrastructure Security Plan

inadvertent mistakes made by well-intentioned employees. Each of these
entry points is a potential source of loss for your organization and ulti-
mately can provide an attack point to defeat your other defenses.
Additionally, the design of your DMZ will allow you to implement a
multilayered approach to securing your resources that does not leave a
single point of failure in your plan.This minimizes the problems and loss
of protection that can occur because of misconﬁguration of rule sets or
ACL lists, as well as reducing the problems that can occur due to hard-
ware conﬁguration errors.
Remote Access
Remote access is granted in a number of different ways, so the way it
should be secured varies widely.The basics are that the remote access
servers should be physically secured (as should all infrastructure servers) in
an access-controlled location.The number of accounts that are authorized
to log onto the server for administrative purposes should be limited and
audited.The communication link between the RAS and the remote users
should be secured, as should the data on that link, if needed.The network
trafﬁc security methods include signing, encryption, and tunneling.The
level of these methods is determined by the system with the least capabil-
ities. Older operating systems cannot utilize the latest encryption tech-
nologies, for example, so you might include policies that require that
remotely connecting users use the latest version of Windows XP
Professional, to enable the entire end-to-end communication link to use
the strongest available encryption.You can also require strong authentica-
tion across remote links. Different operating systems implement this dif-
ferently; in Windows Server 2003, for example, it’s implemented through
policies set in Administrative Tools | Routing and Remote Access.
Wireless Access
We’ve devoted a whole chapter to wireless security, so we will only dis-
cuss the top-level items here:
www.syngress.com
IT Infrastructure Security Plan • Chapter 11
373

■
Change access point default settings.
■
Disable SSID broadcasting; create a closed system (does not
respond to clients with “Any” SSID assigned).
■
Transmission power control (limiting the amount of power used
for transmission to control the signal range).
■
Enable MAC address ﬁltering.
■
Enable WEP or WPA.
■
Filter protocols.
■
Deﬁne IP allocations for the WLAN.
■
Use VPNs.
■
Secure users’computers.
All these choices have pros and cons, distinct advantages and disadvan-
tages; you’ll need to decide the right approach for your organization.As
with all things in IT security, it’s important that you understand the result
of the solutions you’re using, understand the conﬁguration and mainte-
nance of these elements, and be sure you test them well in a lab or iso-
lated setting before implementing them across the enterprise.
Intrusion Detection Systems/
Intrusion Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS)
First, let’s deﬁne IDS and IPS, because they’re not one and the same.
Intrusion detection systems (IDS) are passive in nature; they let you know an
intrusion is taking place or has occurred.They do nothing to stop an
intrusion. On the other hand, an intrusion prevention system (IPS) is an
active system that works to stop an intrusion or to prevent one when “it
thinks” one is occurring. How does “it” think? It does so based on how
you conﬁgure it, so we end up back at that persistent people problem
we’ve mentioned once or twice.An IPS has one major drawback, and
that is the high likelihood of false positives. Depending on how you con-
ﬁgure the IPS, the results of a response to a false positive might be far
www.syngress.com
374
Chapter 11 • IT Infrastructure Security Plan

more devastating than an actual intrusion, so you’re walking a ﬁne line
with IPS.That said, some excellent hardware and software solutions are
available on the market today, many of which are a great improvement
over IDS/IPS systems of the past. It is far outside the scope of this book
to discuss the pros and cons, the highlights and lowlights of these systems,
so we’re not going there. However, we will mention a few different ways
you can implement and secure your IDS/IPS systems and leave it up to
you to develop a speciﬁc plan for implementing these systems, since they
are so varied.
A word of caution: IDS/IPS is not a standalone defense.You should
implement it with the understanding that it contributes to your depth of
defense, but alone it will not keep your network safe. It’s a great tool to
have in your security toolkit, but it’s not the magic bullet everyone
wishes they had.
IPSs introduce fundamental performance and stability issues within
the network or system they are designed to protect.The act of imple-
menting automatic controls in response to detecting attacks does not
come without a price. For example, an inline network IPS will not for-
ward packets before inspecting Application-layer data.This inspection
takes time and can result in a slowdown in the responsiveness and
throughput of the local network.A host IPS that has been charged with
the inspection and validation of an application’s system calls can impact a
kernel’s ability to quickly service system calls, which may only be 1 to 15
percent but is probably noticeable.
Network Active Response System
A network active response system has the ability to interact with network
trafﬁc indirectly through the modiﬁcation of ﬁrewall policies and router
Access Control Lists (ACLs).They also have the ability to take down
switch ports (for locally generated attacks) and to spoof error code
packets such as Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), RST (Reset), or
Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) unreachable packets. Such an
active response system is commonly implemented directly within a net-
work IDS, where it can easily take advantage of its detection capabilities.
www.syngress.com
IT Infrastructure Security Plan • Chapter 11
375

This is useful for tearing down individual sessions or for trying to con-
vince an attacking host that the target is unreachable due to ICMP
errors. However, there is not usually much time between these measures
and the goal of the attack. It’s unclear whether the countermeasure will
be successful.
There are four classes of countermeasure that a network IPS can uti-
lize to thwart a network-based attack. Each class applies to one layer of
the protocol stack, beginning at the Data Link layer:
■
Data Link layer countermeasures Administratively shut
down a switch port interface associated with a system from
which attacks are being launched.This approach is feasible only
for attacks that are generated from a local system. Having the
ability to timeout the downed switch port is important, since the
port probably should not be shut down indeﬁnitely.
■
Network layer countermeasures Interact with the external
ﬁrewall or router to add a general rule to block all communica-
tion from individual IP addresses or entire networks.An inline
IPS can accomplish the same thing without having to appeal to
an external device, since packets from speciﬁc IP addresses can
simply be blocked after an attack has been detected. Similarly to
Data Link layer responses, timeouts are important at the Network
layer, since the ﬁrewall rule set or router ACL modiﬁcations
should be removed after a conﬁgurable amount of time.
■
Transport layer countermeasures Generate TCP RST
packets to tear down malicious TCP sessions, or issues any of sev-
eral available ICMP error-code packets in response to malicious
UDP trafﬁc. (Note that ICMP is strictly a Network layer pro-
tocol and is the standard method of communicating various
errors to clients that utilize UDP).Timeouts are not applicable
here, because countermeasures are leveraged against an attacker
on a per-session or per-packet basis.
www.syngress.com
376
Chapter 11 • IT Infrastructure Security Plan

■
Application layer countermeasures Alter malicious
Application layer data so as to render it harmless before it reaches
the target system.This countermeasure requires that the IPS be in
line in the communication path.Any previously calculated
Transport layer checksum must be recalculated. Similarly to the
Network layer, timeouts are not applicable here, since the effects
of replacing Application layer data are transitory and do not linger
once an altered packet is forwarded through the IPS.
Later in this chapter, we’ll walk through a number of “generic” coun-
termeasures and hardening tasks related to these layers when we look at
various ways routers, switches, and other network devices can be hard-
ened in conjunction with whatever IDS/IPS system you implement.
Host Active Response System
A host active response system is usually implemented in software and is
deployed directly on a host system. Once a suspicious event has been
detected on a host (through any number of means, such as log ﬁle analysis,
detection of speciﬁc ﬁles or registry keys associated with known exploits,
or a suspicious server running on a high port), a host active response
system is charged with taking an action.As with network active response,
the expectation for a host active response system is that countermeasures
will not necessarily prevent an attack from initially being successful.The
emphasis is on trying to mitigate the effects and damage caused by an
attack after detection.After an attack is detected, automated responses can
include alteration of ﬁle system permissions, changes in access that a
system grants to users, automated removal of worms or viruses (anti-virus),
and additions of new rules to a local ﬁrewall subsystem.
Before we move into system hardening, let’s take a look at how
IDS/IPS systems are implemented in the network infrastructure. Figure
11.2 shows the IDS system as part of the infrastructure.The IDS server, in
this case, would be connected to a span port so that it would monitor all
trafﬁc on the local network.The IDS system is capable of spooﬁng a TCP
RST or ICMP error code packet to thwart the attack but would not be
effective against single-packet attacks.

Figure 11.2 IDS System Placement in Infrastructure
An inline system performs a bit differently, as shown in Figure 11.3. In
this case, the inline system captures the sploit (short for exploit) and modi-
ﬁes it to protect the local network.A typical deployment of the IPS
occurs just inside the ﬁrewall. In this position, it captures all incoming
trafﬁc before it goes to the local network, providing ubiquitous protec-
tion, even for single-packet attacks. Because all trafﬁc ﬂows through an
inline IPS, downsides such as false positives and slower response times
must be factored in.
Next Generation Security Devices
As you look at your current implementation of IDS or IPS (or if you’re
considering an implementation), you should also keep an eye on recent
developments in the world of security devices. Network processors can be
deployed in various architectures including parallel, where each processor
handles 1/N of the total load or pipeline, where, as a packet moves
through the pipeline, each processor typically handles a single speciﬁc
repetitive task.The network processor was originally targeted to the

routing market, but it is easy to see how it can be applied to the increased
demands of packet inspection in network security. For example, one pro-
cessor could handle the pattern matching for known worm signatures,
another could analyze for protocol standards compliance, and yet another
could look for protocol or usage anomalies.The network processor would
have direct access to fast memory that stores policies and signatures,
whereas slower, larger memory would store state information and heuris-
tics information. New attacks could be mitigated by adding new code to
the network processor.A separate processor can handle management
functions such as logging and policy management. Network processors
also offer the ability to scale, much like CPUs on computer systems.

Intrusion Prevention and Detection Resource
At the risk of sounding a bit self-serving, if you have any desire to under-
stand more about IDS/IPS, you really should check out another Syngress
book. There may be other excellent IDS/IPS resources out there, but
Intrusion Detection and Active Response: Deploying Network and Host
IPS, by Michael Rash, Angela Orebaugh, Graham Clark, Becky Pinkard,
and Jake Babbin, with a foreword by Stephen Northcutt (Syngress
Publishing, Inc., 2005), is a great resource. If you’re like most IT profes-
sionals, you’re inundated with technical information on a daily (okay,
hourly) basis and it’s hard to stay up to date on every topic in the com-
puter world. This book provides excellent background information and
helps you understand the wild world of IDS/IPS so you can make
informed decisions about how, when, and where to implement it in your
organization. If you’re looking for an excellent resource on this topic, do
yourself a favor and check out this one-stop-shopping trip for an excel-
lent IDS/IPS education.
System Hardening
Server security:
1. Always control physical and network access to critical servers,
especially domain controllers, DNS servers, DHCP servers, and
other infrastructure servers. Keep infrastructure servers in an
access-controlled location.
2. Always perform tasks on the servers with the least possible privi-
leges. Do not perform tasks with Administrator privileges, if pos-
sible. Use the Run As command (or equivalent) when needed.
3. Restrict user and machine access to groups that have loose secu-
rity settings. Provide users and computers with the least possible
www.syngress.com
380
Chapter 11 • IT Infrastructure Security Plan

permissions while still meeting their needs to access and use net-
work resources.
4. Secure the data on the computers using strong ACLs and, if
needed, the syskey utility.The syskey utility provides protection
against password-cracking software that targets the Security
Access Management (SAM) database or directory services. It uses
strong encryption that is much more difﬁcult (if not close to
impossible) and time consuming to crack.
5. Require the use of strong passwords via password policy settings.
6. Restrict the downloading and installation of programs that do
not come from known, trusted sources.
7. Maintain up-to-date virus protection on all systems.
8. Keep all software patches up to date. Patches often address newly
discovered security holes.Applying patches in a timely manner
on all affected machines can prevent problems that are easily
avoided.
9. Deploy server, application and client-side security technologies:
■
Secure server trafﬁc traveling on the network.
■
Secure application and user data traveling on the network.
■
Secure network access points and network access.
■
Secure client devices including desktops, laptops, and PDAs.
■
Implement automatically updating virus and spyware protec-
tion systems.
Other Infrastructure Issues
1. Deploy network monitoring and auditing.
2. Develop a disaster recovery plan that includes creating backups,
documenting recovery options and using repair and recovery
tools. (See Chapter 13 for more on disaster planning and
recovery.)

3. Develop standard operating procedures that include strong moni-
toring, auditing, and documentation.

Rootkits
There’s been a lot of news in the recent past about the problems pre-
sented by rootkit attacks. As you’re well aware, those little pieces of mal-
ware reside so deep in the system that you can’t possibly remove them
without completely starting from scratch. After a system is compro-
mised, all the affected software must be reinstalled from known “clean”
sources. Since it can be difﬁcult to determine precisely which pieces of
software have been affected, the best way to guarantee security is to
reinstall the entire operating system (OS) and all applications. OS kernels
can also be compromised (see www.rootkit.com), and when they are,
nothing on the system (even the most basic ﬁle system, memory, and
network status information) can be trusted. An after-the-fact forensic
analysis of the ﬁle system may turn up useful information if the disk is
mounted underneath an uncompromised OS, but this is a time-con-
suming operation.
Other Network Components:
Routers, Switches, RAS, NMS, IDS
There are numerous components that should be checked during an
infrastructure security project.The list in this section was compiled, in
part, from a network checklist developed by the Defense Information
Systems Agency (DISA) for the Department of Defense (DoD).Although
not all items listed will apply to your network and it’s possible that not all
items that apply to your network appear on this list, this is an extensive
list that you can use as the starting point for your own checklist. Some of
the items in this list contain brief explanations included to help you
understand their importance. Our assumption is that you’re familiar with
www.syngress.com
382
Chapter 11 • IT Infrastructure Security Plan

the ins and outs of network security, but there are a few places where a
quick clariﬁcation will help, and we’ve included them as well.These are
written in language that reﬂects problems you would ﬁnd that should be
remedied (for instance, highlighting the problem you’re looking for, not
necessarily the solution you should implement).The list is organized by
device type, beginning with routers and other network devices and
moving on to ﬁrewalls, VLANs, RAS servers, and so on.
Network
■
Network infrastructure is not properly documented You
should begin with a clear understanding of how your network
infrastructure is currently conﬁgured.This should be well docu-
mented and kept up to date.
■
Network connections exist without approval All network
connections should exist only with explicit approval or knowl-
edge of the IT department.This is typically a problem with
modems, wireless access points, and USB-type network devices.
■
Unmanaged backdoor connections, backdoor network
connections bypass perimeter Every network in the world
has a variety of backdoor connections that network administra-
tors use (or that software developers build in). When unmanaged,
these connections create security problems for your network
infrastructure.These are especially problematic when these back-
doors bypass perimeter security systems. If you can use them, so
can the bad guys.
■
Circuit location is not secure The location of network cir-
cuitry, including the backbone and other highly critical compo-
nents, should be secured physically.
■
Network devices are not stored in secure communica-
tions room This is part of physical security; to the extent pos-
sible, network devices should be stored in a secure
communications room.This should certainly be true for mission-
www.syngress.com
IT Infrastructure Security Plan • Chapter 11
383

critical devices. Physical security of the company’s premises, cou-
pled with physical security of key network devices, is part of a
depth-in-defense strategy.
■
Minimum operating system release level All network
devices—from desktop computers to servers to ﬁrewalls to
routers—should have the latest updates and patches for the oper-
ating system they are running.As seen from the top-20 threat list,
many are threats to portions of the operating system, so all device
operating systems should be kept up to date. Where possible, you
may also choose to upgrade the operating system itself to a
newer, more secure version, where appropriate.This OS release-
level maintenance should also apply to routers and other devices
that have operating systems, ﬁrmware, or other embedded soft-
ware functionality.
■
DNS servers must be deﬁned for client resolver If a router
or similar network device is speciﬁed as a client resolver (resolves
DNS to IP address), the router should have a DNS server
deﬁned. If the DNS server is speciﬁed, it makes it more difﬁcult
for an attacker to substitute his or her IP address for that of the
destination host. If this type of man-in-the-middle attack is suc-
cessful, the unsuspecting host user could transmit sensitive infor-
mation, including logon, authentication, and password data, to the
attacker.
External Communications 
(also see “Remote Access”)
■
Modems are not disconnected In Chapter 12 (“Wireless
Security”), we discuss the problem with unsecured modems.
Brieﬂy, these can be attacked by wardialers who simply look for
modems connected to corporate networks.These can create sig-
niﬁcant security holes and are often overlooked in our quest to
lock down the wired network.

Chapter 11 • IT Infrastructure Security Plan

■
An ISP connection exists without written approval In
most companies, this might be a difﬁcult trick to achieve, but it
certainly warrants examination to ensure that the ISP connec-
tion(s) is managed by the IT department and not some errant
user who managed to get the local ISP provider to run a cable
into the ofﬁce on a Saturday morning.
■
Communications devices are not password protected This
seems like a giant “Duh!” but you’d probably be surprised how
often communication devices such as modems, routers, switches,
and other “smart” devices are left unprotected by even a simple
password or that use the default password that came with the
device out of the box.
■
No warning banner Failure to display the required login
banner prior to logon attempts will limit the site’s ability to pros-
ecute unauthorized access. It also presents the potential for crim-
inal and civil liability for systems administrators and information
systems managers. Not displaying the proper banner will also
hamper the site’s ability to monitor device usage. Displaying a
banner warning users of the consequences of unauthorized access
helps warn off the bad guys and draws a line in the legal sand
that you might need later.
TCP/IP (Some TCP/IP Information 
Also Found in the “Routers” Section)
■
LAN addresses are not protected from the public In later
versions of the Windows operating system, even home users were
able to easily implement Network Address Translation (NAT) to
protect internal IP addresses from Internet users. Most businesses
these days have implemented some method of protecting internal
IP addresses so that hackers can’t use this information to decipher
the network structure and plan an attack.
www.syngress.com
IT Infrastructure Security Plan • Chapter 11
385

■
The DHCP server is not conﬁgured to log hostnames To
identify and combat IP address spooﬁng, it is highly recom-
mended that the DHCP server log MAC addresses or hostnames
on the DHCP server.
■
TCP and UDP small server services are not disabled TCP
and UDP services are often available on network devices,
including routers and servers. Disabling these services if they’re
not used helps reduce the attack footprint.TCP and UDP proto-
cols include services that routers can support; however, they are
not required for operation.Attackers have used these services to
cause network DoS attacks.
■
TCP keepalives for Telnet session must be enabled
Enabling TCP keepalives on incoming connections can help
guard against both malicious attacks and orphaned sessions caused
by remote system crashes. Enabling the TCP keepalives causes the
router to generate periodic keepalive messages, letting it detect
and drop broken Telnet connections.
■
Identiﬁcation support is enabled Identiﬁcation support
allows you to query a TCP port for identiﬁcation.This feature
enables an unsecured protocol to report the identity of a client
initiating a TCP connection and a host responding to the con-
nection. With identiﬁcation support, you can connect a TCP port
on a host, issue a simple text string to request information, and
receive a simple text-string reply.This is another mechanism to
learn the router vendor, model number, and software version
being run. Identiﬁcation support should be disabled on routers
and other network devices that provide this functionality.

Business Intelligence…
Whitelisting
Whitelisting is the ability to easily specify IP addresses or networks that
should never be the subject of an automated response in an IDS/IPS
system. For example, IP addresses associated with systems that are crit-
ical to a network (for example, the Domain Name Server, or DNS, or
upstream router) should not be automatically blocked by an active
response system, nor should sessions be altered by an inline IPS. Some
active response systems include the ability to whitelist IP addresses and
networks and to specify which protocols should be ignored. For
example, if a DNS server sends an attack across the network to a Web
server, it may be permissible for an active response system to capture the
individual TCP session on port 80 but ignore everything else.
■
IP-directed broadcasts are not disabled An IP-directed broad-
cast is a datagram sent to the broadcast address of a subnet that is
not directly attached to the sending machine.The directed broad-
cast is routed through the network as a Unicast packet until it
arrives at the target subnet, where it is converted into a link layer
broadcast. Due to the nature of the IP addressing architecture,
only the last router in the chain, which is connected directly to
the target subnet, can conclusively identify a directed broadcast.
IP-directed broadcasts are used in the extremely common and
popular smurf, or DoS, attacks. In a smurf attack, the attacker
sends ICMP echo requests from a falsiﬁed source address to a
directed broadcast address, causing all the hosts on the target
subnet to send replies to the falsiﬁed source. By sending a contin-
uous stream of such requests, the attacker can create a much
larger stream of replies, which can completely inundate the host
whose address is being falsiﬁed.This service should be disabled
www.syngress.com
IT Infrastructure Security Plan • Chapter 11
387

on all interfaces when it’s not needed to prevent smurf and DoS
attacks.
■
Ingress ﬁltering inbound spooﬁng addresses Inbound
spooﬁng occurs when someone outside the network uses an
internal IP address to gain access to systems or devices on the
internal network. If the intruder is successful, they can intercept
data, passwords, and the like and use that information to perform
destructive acts on network devices or network data.
■
Egress outbound spooﬁng ﬁlter You should restrict the
router from accepting any outbound IP packet that contains an
illegitimate address in the source address ﬁeld via egress ACLs or
by enabling Unicast Reverse Path Forwarding.ACLs are the ﬁrst
line of defense in a layered security approach.They permit autho-
rized packets and deny unauthorized packets based on port or
service type.They enhance the network’s posture by not allowing
packets to even reach a potential target within the security
domain.Auditing packets attempting to penetrate the network
but that are stopped by an ACL will allow network administrators
to broaden their protective ring and more tightly deﬁne the
scope of operation.
Administration
■
Devices exist that have standard default passwords This is
another major “Duh!” item; again, it’s surprising how easy it is to
get into a large number of devices just by using the default pass-
word that the device shipped with. Want to know the default
password? Go up on the manufacturer’s Web site, look for the
user guide for the speciﬁc device, and the default password is
almost guaranteed to be listed in the ﬁrst ﬁve pages of the
manual.
■
Group accounts or user accounts without passwords
Without passwords on user accounts for network devices, one
www.syngress.com
388
Chapter 11 • IT Infrastructure Security Plan

level of complexity is removed from gaining access to the routers.
If a default user ID has not been changed or is guessed by an
attacker, the network could be easily compromised, since the only
remaining step would be to crack the password. Sharing group
accounts on any network device should also be prohibited. If
these group accounts are not changed when someone leaves the
group, that person could possibly gain control of the device.
Having group accounts does not allow for proper auditing of
who is accessing or changing the network. Only allow individual
user account access and require each user to have a unique user
ID and a strong password.
■
Assign lowest privilege level to user accounts Across the
enterprise, you should always assign the least privilege possible for
all users.This prevents users from getting into places they
shouldn’t, and it also prevents hackers from upgrading their privi-
leges if they manage to get in on a user account that has too
many privileges. Even IT staff should have user accounts with
least privileges for most day-to-day network tasks, and they
should only log on with administrative privileges when needed.
Network outages and security holes can be created by users with
too many permissions or even by a well-meaning but inexperi-
enced net admin.
■
Strong password policies are not enforced Strong passwords
is an inadequate defense on its own, but it slows down a would-
be intruder and can also alert a net admin to a potential problem
if failed password attempts are monitored and accounts are locked
down after too many failed attempts. Requiring users to use
strong passwords, to change them periodically, and to prevent
them from repeating old passwords too frequently are all parts of
strong password policy. In addition, you can audit failed attempts,
notify a net admin of too many failed attempts, and lock out an
account with too many failed accounts as part of your strong
password policy implementation.
www.syngress.com
IT Infrastructure Security Plan • Chapter 11
389

■
Passwords are not recorded and stored properly User pass-
words should not be recorded and stored, but certain administrative
ones absolutely should be.You can probably think of several sce-
narios where someone who doesn’t normally require administrative
access requires it. For example, suppose as part of your disaster
recovery plan, you have an executive VP who is responsible for
coordinating recovery efforts. He or she should have access to these
passwords only for these emergency situations, because on a day-
to-day basis, you operate on the principle of “least access” and the
EVP really has nothing more than the equivalent rights of a power
user. Having these passwords on a network server in plain sight or
in a paper ﬁle someplace obvious is not a good idea. Making sure
these emergency passwords are recorded and stored properly
ensures security for the network on a day-to-day basis but provides
an important fail-safe option in emergencies as well.
■
Passwords are viewable when displaying the router or
other device Many attacks on computer systems are launched
from within the network by unsatisﬁed or disgruntled employees.
It’s vital that all router passwords be encrypted so they cannot be
intercepted by viewing the console. If the router network is com-
promised, large parts of the network could be incapacitated with
just a few simple commands.
■
Passwords are transmitted in clear text  There are many
types of situations in which passwords are transmitted in clear
text.This creates an opportunity for an attacker to seize pass-
words. Review how and where passwords are transmitted and
secure the communication lines if the passwords themselves are
transmitted in clear text.
■
Emergency accounts should be limited to one Emergency
accounts on devices such as routers or switches should be limited
to one.Authentication for administrative access to the router
should obviously be required at all times.A single account can be
created on the router’s local database for use in an emergency,
www.syngress.com
390
Chapter 11 • IT Infrastructure Security Plan

such as when the authentication server is down or connectivity
between the router and the authentication server is not operable.
Verify that there is one and only one emergency account to pre-
vent unnecessary opportunities for attack.
■
Unnecessary or unauthorized router or device accounts
exist This point is related to the previous item.You should elim-
inate any unused, unnecessary, or unauthorized device accounts
except for one authorized emergency account.
■
Disable unused ports and services On every server, every
ﬁrewall, and every device, disable unused ports and services.
Microsoft took a giant leap forward in the more recent versions
of the Windows operating system when the company changed
the default conﬁguration from “open” to “closed.”This meant
that the net admin had to consciously enable and open services
and ports after installation. Earlier versions came open and
unlocked out of the box, and the net admin had to sift through
the system to lock it down. For all devices, disable unused ports
and services, uninstall unused applications, and remove unused
hardware.
■
Auditing and logging ﬁles are not set to record denied
events, not set to record system activity Auditing and log-
ging are key components of any security architecture. It is essen-
tial that security personnel know what is being done, being
attempted, and by whom in order to compile an accurate risk
assessment.Auditing the actions, particularly denied events, on
routers provides a means to identify potential attacks or threats.
Maintaining an audit trail of system activity logs (syslog) can help
you identify conﬁguration errors, understand past intrusions,
troubleshoot service disruptions, and react to probes and scans of
the network.
www.syngress.com
IT Infrastructure Security Plan • Chapter 11
391

■
Conﬁgurations are stored in unsecured locations To ensure
network and data availability, the conﬁguration data of key net-
work infrastructure components should be maintained in a
secure, offsite location.This is part of good disaster recovery plan-
ning practices and adds to security if these conﬁgurations are
stored in secured locations offsite rather than in an unlocked ﬁle
cabinet in the mailroom.Access to these conﬁguration ﬁles
should be restricted and logged to prevent unauthorized access.
Network Management
■
Out-of-band network management not implemented or
required  It’s outside the scope of this chapter (and book) to get
into a deep discussion of in-band and out-of-band network man-
agement, but we will toss out a couple of quick explanations
before discussing the infrastructure security implications of both.
In-band network management uses the same network infrastruc-
ture as the devices and data being managed. Most networking
equipment basically sends out IP trafﬁc for network management
on the same medium as the trafﬁc it’s managing (routers,
switches, and so forth). Out-of-band network management uses a
separate connection, often a serial RS-232 port, instead of the
network port used for in-band management.There are security
pros and cons to both, so the key is to secure whichever
method(s) you implement.
Without secure out-of-band management implemented with
authenticated access controls, strong two-factor authentication,
encryption of the management session, and audit logs, unautho-
rized users may gain access to network managed devices such as
routers or communications servers (CS). If the router network is
compromised, large parts of the network could be incapacitated
with only a few commands. If a CS is compromised, unautho-
rized users could gain access to the network and its attached sys-
www.syngress.com
392
Chapter 11 • IT Infrastructure Security Plan

tems.The CS could be disabled, therefore disallowing authorized
subscribers from supporting mission critical functions.
From an architectural point of view, providing out-of-band
management of network systems is the best ﬁrst step in any man-
agement strategy. No network production trafﬁc resides on an
out-of-band network.
■
Use of in-band management is not limited, restricted, or
encrypted It is imperative that communications used for
administrative access to network components are limited to
emergency situations or where out-of-band management would
hinder daily operational requirements. In-band management
introduces the risk of an attacker gaining access to the network
internally or even externally. In-band management should be
restricted to a limited number of authorized IP addresses to
improve security.The in-band access should also be encrypted for
added security. Without encrypted in-band management connec-
tions, unauthorized users may gain access to network managed
devices such as routers, ﬁrewalls, or remote access servers. If any
of these devices are compromised, the entire network could also
be compromised.Administrative access requires the use of
encryption on all communication channels between the remote
user and the system being accessed. It is imperative to protect
communications used for administrative access because an
attacker who manages to hijack the link would gain immediate
access to the network.
■
Log all in-band management access attempts Since in-
band trafﬁc travels on the same pathways as normal network
trafﬁc, be sure that all in-bound management access attempts are
logged.This will give you an indication as to whether an intruder
is attempting to gain control of key network devices.These
attempts should not go unnoticed and should be veriﬁed against
legitimate management activity of that device. For example, if the
www.syngress.com
IT Infrastructure Security Plan • Chapter 11
393

access attempts happen after business hours, it’s possible (or likely)
that the attempts are unauthorized.
■
Two-factor authentication is not used for in-band or out-
of-band network management Without strong two-factor
authorization, unauthorized users may gain access to network
managed devices such as routers, ﬁrewalls, and remote access
servers. If any of these devices are compromised, the entire net-
work could also be compromised.
■
Filter ICMP on external interface The Internet Control
Message Protocol (ICMP) supports IP trafﬁc by relaying infor-
mation about paths, routes, and network conditions. ICMP
unreachable notiﬁcations, mask replies, and redirects should be
disabled on all externally-interfaced routers to prevent hackers
using these messages to perform network mapping and infrastruc-
ture discovery.
■
SNMP access is not restricted by IP address Detailed
information about the network is sent across the network via
SNMP. If this information is discovered by attackers, it could be
used to trace the network, show the network topology, and pos-
sibly gain access to network devices.Access to SNMP should be
for speciﬁc IP addresses only.
■
SNMP is blocked at all external interfaces Clearly, using
SNMP to map a network and discover the network infrastructure
is a great hacker tool that should be secured to the greatest extent
possible.This includes blocking SNMP on all external interfaces.
■
SNMP write access to the router is enabled This allows an
intruder to set various conﬁguration settings to allow him or her
greater access to the router and hence to the network. SNMP
write access should be disabled.
■
Block identiﬁed inbound ICMP messages Using inbound
ICMP Echo, Information, Net Mask, and Timestamp requests, an
attacker can create a map of the subnets and hosts behind the
www.syngress.com
394
Chapter 11 • IT Infrastructure Security Plan

router.An attacker can perform a DoS attack by ﬂooding the
router or internal hosts with Echo packets. With inbound ICMP
Redirect packets, the attacker can change a host’s routing tables.
■
Block identiﬁed outbound ICMP trafﬁc An attacker from
the internal network (behind the router) may be able to launch
DoS attacks with outbound ICMP packets. It is important to
block all unnecessary ICMP trafﬁc message types.
■
Block all inbound traceroutes If you’re ever had to trou-
bleshoot a network or Internet connection, you’re familiar with
the traceroute command.This is a helpful tool in troubleshooting,
but it also provides great information to a would-be attacker to
create a map of the subnets and hosts behind the router.These
should not be allowed into the network through the router or
other externally facing devices.
■
Secure NMS trafﬁc using IPSec To securely protect the net-
work, Network Management Systems (NMS) and access to them
must be controlled to guard against outside or unauthorized intru-
sion, which could result in system or network compromise.
Allowing any device to send traps or information may create a false
positive and having site personnel perform unneeded or potentially
hazardous actions on the network in response to these false traps.
These sessions must be controlled and secured by IPSec.
■
An insecure version of SNMP is being used SNMP
Versions 1 and 2 are not considered secure and are not recom-
mended. Instead, use SNMP Version 3, which provides the User-
based Security Model (USM), which gives strong authentication
and privacy. Without Version 3, it’s possible an attacker could gain
unauthorized access to detailed network management informa-
tion that can be used to map and subsequently attack the 
network.
www.syngress.com
IT Infrastructure Security Plan • Chapter 11

■
SNMP standard operating procedures are not docu-
mented Standard operating procedures will ensure consistency
and will help prevent errors or omissions that could create a
security hole.
■
NMS security alarms not deﬁned by violation type or
severity Ensure that security alarms are set up within the man-
aged network’s framework.At a minimum, these will include the
following:
■
Integrity violation Indicates that network contents or
objects have been illegally modiﬁed, deleted, or added.
■
Operational violation Indicates that a desired object or
service could not be used.
■
Physical violation Indicates that a physical part of the net-
work (such as a cable) has been damaged or modiﬁed without
authorization.
■
Security mechanism violation Indicates that the net-
work’s security system has been compromised or breached.
■
Time domain violation Indicates that an event has hap-
pened outside its allowed or typical time slot.
Also ensure that alarms are categorized by severity using the
following guidelines:
■
Critical and major alarms are given when a condition that
affects service has arisen. For a critical alarm, steps must be
taken immediately to restore the service that has been lost
completely.
■
A major alarm indicates that steps must be taken as soon as
possible because the affected service has degraded drastically
and is in danger of being lost completely.
■
A minor alarm indicates a problem that does not yet affect
service but may do so if the problem is not corrected.

Chapter 11 • IT Infrastructure Security Plan

■
A warning alarm is used to signal a potential problem that
may affect service.
■
An indeterminate alarm is one that requires human interven-
tion to decide its severity.
Without the proper categories of security alarm being deﬁned
on the NMS, responding to critical outages or attacks on the net-
work may not be coordinated correctly with the right personnel,
hardware, software, or vendor maintenance. Delays will inevitably
occur that will cause network outages to last longer than neces-
sary or expose the network to larger, more extensive attacks or
outages.
■
The NMS is not located in a secure environment Any
network management server (or any other highly critical network
component) should be kept in a physically secure location with
restricted access. Since many attacks come from inside an organi-
zation, by people who are authorized to be on the premises, it’s
important to physically secure all critical network components to
the greatest degree possible. Using keypad or card-swipe access
control can also help identify speciﬁc administrative access, to
allow you to further control and monitor access.
Access to NMS and other network critical components
should be restricted via access controls as well, and all activity,
including all successful and failed attempts to log on, should be
logged.The log ﬁle, as with all log ﬁles, should be reviewed regu-
larly, stored for 30 days, and archived for a year, unless regulatory
or compliance requirements differ.
■
NMS accounts are not properly maintained Only those
accounts necessary for the operation of the system and for access
logging should be maintained.This is true for all servers and net-
work devices. Good “housekeeping” is an essential element to net-
work security, and removing or disabling unused accounts as well
as removing and investigating unauthorized accounts is critical.

Routers and Routing
■
No documented procedures and maintenance for MD5
keys Routing protocols should use MD5 to authenticate neigh-
bors prior to exchanging route table updates, to ensure that route
tables are not corrupted or compromised.
■
MD5 Key Lifetime expiration is set to never expire MD5
is a public key encryption algorithm that uses the exchange of
encryption keys across a network link. If these keys are not man-
aged properly, they could be intercepted by unauthorized users
and used to break the encryption algorithm.This check is in
place to ensure that keys do not expire, creating a DoS due to
adjacencies being dropped and routes being aged out.The recom-
mendation is to use two rotating six-month keys, with a third key
set as inﬁnite lifetime.The lifetime key should be changed seven
days after the rotating keys have expired.
■
Console port is not conﬁgured to time out Console ports
on routers or other network devices should be set to time out
after some speciﬁed period of inactivity. In most cases, a 5- or 10-
minute timeout is appropriate.A router is a highly desirable asset
to an intruder, so setting a low threshold on timeout will help
increase security.
■
Modems are connected to the console or aux port There
may be valid reasons to have a modem connected to the console
or auxiliary port of a router or other network device, but you
should ﬁrst ensure that this connection is absolutely necessary. If
not, remove it. If it is needed, be sure to secure it by requiring a
username and password (and other security measures) and avoid
default conﬁgurations.
■
The router or network device’s auxiliary port is not dis-
abled If the router or other network device has an auxiliary
port, be sure it is disabled it if it’s not in use.These are the kinds
of welcome backdoors hackers look for.
www.syngress.com
398
Chapter 11 • IT Infrastructure Security Plan

■
Login is not limited to three attempts Login attempts for
any network device that exceed three tries are likely the work of
a hacker. Limiting login attempts to three is a reasonable limit,
and most net admins will stop after three attempts if they cannot
recall the appropriate login.This won’t stop a hacker who is
willing to try three times, wait some speciﬁed interval, and try
again, but it will prevent automated attacks from going through
quickly (or at all).
■
Secure Shell timeout is not 60 seconds or less Many routes
and network management devices use the Secure Shell (SSH)
protocol to secure communications to the device. Reducing the
broken Telnet session expiration time to 60 seconds or less
strengthens the router or network device from being attacked
using an expired session.
■
Key services are not disabled on all routers The DHCP,
ﬁnger service, HTTP, FTP, and BSD r-commands and bootp ser-
vices should be disabled on routers and network devices for
added security.All unused protocols and services should be dis-
abled to prevent unauthorized use of these services.
■
Conﬁguration autoloading must be disabled The routers
can ﬁnd their startup conﬁguration in their own NVRAM or
load it over the network via TFTP or Remote Copy (rcp).
Obviously, loading in across the network is a security risk. If an
attacker intercepted the startup conﬁguration, it could be used to
gain access to the router and take control of network trafﬁc.
■
IP source routing is not disabled on all routers IP source
routing is a process whereby individual packets can specify
routing.This is a method that attackers can exploit, so this ability
should be disabled on routers and network devices with this
capability.
www.syngress.com
IT Infrastructure Security Plan • Chapter 11
399

■
Proxy ARP is not disabled When proxy ARP is enabled on
some routers, it allows that router to extend the network (at
Layer 2) across multiple interfaces (LAN segments). Because
proxy ARP allows hosts from different LAN segments to look
like they are on the same segment, proxy ARP is safe only when
it’s used between trusted LAN segments.Attackers can leverage
the trusting nature of proxy ARP by spooﬁng a trusted host and
then intercepting packets.You should always disable proxy ARP
on router interfaces that do not require it, unless the router is
being used as a LAN bridge.
■
Gratuitous ARP is not disabled A gratuitous ARP is an ARP
broadcast in which the source and destination MAC addresses are
the same. It is used to inform the network about a host’s IP
address.A spoofed gratuitous ARP message can cause network
mapping information to be stored incorrectly, causing network
malfunction and resulting in various types of service denials,
leading to an availability issue.
■
Routers are not set to intercept TCP SYN attacks The
TCP SYN attack involves transmitting a volume of connections
that cannot be completed at the destination.This attack causes
the connection queues to ﬁll up, thereby denying service to legit-
imate TCP users. Routers and similar network devices should be
conﬁgured to intercept TCP SYN attacks to prevent DoS attacks
from an outside network.
■
Router is not conﬁgured to block known DDoS ports
Several high-proﬁle DDoS attacks have been launched across the
Internet.Although routers cannot prevent DDoS attacks in gen-
eral, it is usually sound security practice to discourage the activi-
ties of speciﬁc DDoS agents (a.k.a. zombies) by adding access list
rules that block their particular ports.
www.syngress.com

Chapter 11 • IT Infrastructure Security Plan

■
TFTP used without speciﬁc need or approval, access is
not restricted Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) is a simple
form of FTP that uses the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) and
provides no security features at all (not even a password). It is
often used by routers, X-terminals, and servers to boot diskless
workstations, but by its very nature it is an insecure protocol. It
should not be implemented without a very speciﬁc need to do
so, and access to the TFTP server should be restricted and moni-
tored.
■
The FTP username and password are not conﬁgured The
FTP server should require the use of usernames and passwords to
prevent anonymous use of the FTP functionality on the network.
Firewall
■
Firewall not implemented and conﬁgured properly You
should ensure that one or more ﬁrewalls are installed and prop-
erly conﬁgured.The default conﬁguration should be the most
restrictive conﬁguration, deny-by-default, so that only speciﬁcally
allowed trafﬁc is allowed into the network.
■
A screened subnet (DMZ) is not implemented Without
the dual-homed screened subnet (a DMZ), architecture trafﬁc
that would be normally destined for the DMZ would have to be
redirected to the site’s internal network. Computers on the inside
of the ﬁrewall should send outbound requests through the ﬁre-
wall and into the DMZ.The DMZ, in turn, routes or redirects
these outbound requests.Typically, a ﬁrewall will not accept
inbound requests from the DMZ computers, which adds another
layer of protection to the network clients.
■
Using an application-level ﬁrewall All networks should use
an application-level gateway or ﬁrewall to proxy all trafﬁc to
external networks. Devices such as SSL gateways, e-mail gateways
that will proxy services to protect the network, are also accept-
www.syngress.com
IT Infrastructure Security Plan • Chapter 11
401

able.A Layer 4 or stateful inspection ﬁrewall, in collaboration
with application-level proxy devices, can be used to secure all
connections.
■
Firewall does not require authentication, does not lock
out after three attempts Firewalls are the enforcement mech-
anisms of the security on the network, and they are ideal targets
for attackers. Firewall placement in the network and the level of
access granted to the users accessing the device also increase the
risk proﬁle associated with remote management.Therefore, all
personnel who access the ﬁrewall both locally and remotely
should be granted the minimum privilege level needed to per-
form their duties.The standard three-attempt lockout should be
enforced, with the exception that when a ﬁrewall administrator is
locked out, the senior net admin (or network security ofﬁcer, if
one exists) should be responsible for unlocking the account.
■
Firewall remote access is not restricted Only the ﬁrewall
administrator should be able to access the ﬁrewall remotely.
Remove unused accounts and remove access for all staff other
than the administrator.
■
Firewall is not conﬁgured to protect the network Ensure
that the ﬁrewall is actually conﬁgured to protect the network.
Conﬁguration of the ﬁrewall will vary from site to site, but in
general, it should at least be conﬁgured to prevent TCP SYN
ﬂooding and the Ping of Death attacks.
■
Firewall has unnecessary services enabled As with all net-
work devices, disable, uninstall, and deconﬁgure any unused or
unnecessary services.The fewer services that are enabled, the
smaller the attack footprint.
■
Firewall version is not a supported or current As with all
network devices, it’s critical to keep the ﬁrewall software (and
hardware, if appropriate) up to date with current versions,
patches, and updates. It’s extremely common for attackers to
www.syngress.com
402
Chapter 11 • IT Infrastructure Security Plan

exploit known security issues days, weeks, or even months after a
patch is available.This type of hacking is pretty lazy stuff and is a
bit of an embarrassment if it occurs, because it’s 100-percent pre-
ventable. Keep your ﬁrewall up to date.
■
The ﬁrewall logs are not being reviewed daily There’s
really no point in creating log ﬁles if you’re not going to review
them. Reviewing and analyzing log ﬁles is part art, part science,
but the only way you’ll ever know what’s going on is to actually
review those ﬁles on a regular basis. If you don’t know that a
hacker was chopping away at your network security last night,
you’ll probably be surprised when he or she manages to hack in
tomorrow night.
■
Firewall log retention does not meet policy The ﬁrewall
logs can be used for forensic analysis in support of incidents (after
the fact) as well as to aid in normal trafﬁc analysis. It can take
numerous days to recover from a ﬁrewall outage when a proper
backup scheme is not used. Firewall logs should be stored in
secure locations; they should be stored for 30 days and archived
for one year.
■
The ﬁrewall conﬁguration is not backed up weekly It’s
quite a chore to properly conﬁgure a corporate ﬁrewall, as you
probably well know.Therefore, it’s wise to back up the conﬁgura-
tion data for the ﬁrewall on a weekly basis or whenever the ﬁre-
wall conﬁguration changes.This provides excellent forensic
support and helps in disaster recovery efforts.
■
The ﬁrewall is not conﬁgured to alarm the admin If
someone is knocking at the door but no one’s home, an intruder
may well decide to just barge right in.That’s the net result of
having a ﬁrewall that is not conﬁgured to alarm the administrator
to unusual trafﬁc.
www.syngress.com
IT Infrastructure Security Plan • Chapter 11
403

■
The ﬁrewall is not conﬁgured properly The ﬁrewall should
be conﬁgured to protect the network.The following are sug-
gested settings:
■
Log unsuccessful authentication attempts.
■
Stamp audit trail data with the date and time it was recorded.
■
Record the source IP, destination IP, protocol used, and the
action taken.
■
Log administrator logons, changes to the administrator group,
and account lockouts.
■
Protect audit logs from deletion and modiﬁcation.
Intrusion Detection/Intrusion Prevention
■
The company does not have an incident response policy
An IDS is pretty worthless if you don’t also have an incident
response policy in place. Develop an incident response policy so
there are clear lines of responsibility and reporting.Also clearly
delineate how, where, and to whom to report suspicious activity.
■
Unauthorized trafﬁc is not logged Audit logs are necessary
to provide a trail of evidence in case the network is compro-
mised. With this information, the network administrator can
devise ways to block the attack and possibly identify and prose-
cute the attacker. Information supplied by an IDS can be used for
forensic analysis in support of an incident as well as to aid in
normal trafﬁc analysis.
■
No established weekly backup procedures IDS data needs
to be backed up to ensure that it is preserved in the event of a
hardware failure of the IDS or in the event the IDS is breached.
■
IDS antivirus updates procedures not in the standard
operating procedure IDS systems require antivirus updates. Be
sure that these updates are in the standard operating procedures
www.syngress.com
404
Chapter 11 • IT Infrastructure Security Plan

for IT staff. Sometimes it’s the little things we overlook that bite
us the hardest; this one’s a no-brainer but easy to overlook.
■
Switches and cross-connects are not secure Since the
intrusion detection and prevention system includes all hardware
required to connect horizontal wiring to the backbone wiring,
it’s important that all switches and associated cross-connect hard-
ware are kept in a secured location, a locked room or an enclosed
cabinet that is locked.This will also prevent an attacker from
gaining privilege mode access to the switch. Several switch prod-
ucts require only a reboot of the switch to reset or recover the
password.
Remote Access
■
The management VLAN is not secured In a VLAN-based
network, switches use VLAN1 as the default VLAN for in-band
management and to communicate with other networking devices
using Spanning-Tree Protocol (STP), Cisco Discovery Protocol
(CDP), Dynamic Trunking Protocol (DTP), VLAN Trunking
Protocol (VTP), and Port Aggregation Protocol (PAgP)—all
untagged trafﬁc.As a consequence, VLAN1 may unwisely span
the entire network if it’s not appropriately pruned. If its scope is
large enough, the risk of compromise can increase signiﬁcantly.
■
Remote Access Servers do not require encryption for
end-user access You should ensure that only users who require
remote access are granted it and that all remote access trafﬁc is
encrypted to the fullest extent possible.
■
RAS does not use two-factor authentication Without
strong two-factor authorization, unauthorized users may gain
access to network services, devices, and data. Clearly, if an
intruder gains control of network infrastructure devices, he or she
could inﬂict damage to either the data or the network, causing
loss of conﬁdentiality, integrity, or availability.
www.syngress.com
IT Infrastructure Security Plan • Chapter 11
405

■
Remote Access Server connectivity isn’t logged Logging is
your friend; keeping a log ﬁle of RAS connectivity is critical to
keep track of who is attempting to log in, who did log in and
when, and how long they were logged in. Reviewing log ﬁles
daily will help you notice patterns and problems earlier in the
cycle than reviewing log ﬁles infrequently (or never).
■
RAS session exceeds 30-minute inactivity An RAS session
that is inactive should be terminated to prevent session hijacking.
Terminate idle connections after no more than 30 minutes of
inactivity.
■
RAS log retentions do not meet requirements Depending
on organizational, legal, or regulatory requirements, you should
keep log ﬁles for 30 days and archive them for one year.
■
The logs are not viewed on a weekly basis Reviewing log
ﬁles daily will help you notice patterns and problems earlier in
the cycle than reviewing log ﬁles infrequently (or never).
■
Modems are not physically protected Limiting the access to
infrastructure modems and keeping accurate records of the
deployed modems will limit the chance that unauthorized
modems will be placed into the infrastructure. If an unauthorized
person has physical access to a site’s modems, the switch or soft-
ware settings can be changed to affect the security of a system.
■
An accurate list of all modems isn’t maintained Keeping
accurate records of the deployed modems will limit the chance
that unauthorized modems will be placed into the infrastructure.
It will also help you keep track of modems that are no longer
used so they can be physically removed or disabled.
■
Modems are not restricted to single-line operation
Modems should be connected to phone lines that have very basic
capabilities. If a phone line has advanced features such as call for-
warding, it’s possible an intruder could take control of a modem,
computer, or network. Keep it simple for better security.
www.syngress.com
406
Chapter 11 • IT Infrastructure Security Plan

■
Proper call logs are not being maintained Logs of all in-
bound and out-bound calls for modems and phone lines should
be logged and reviewed on a regular basis. Hijacked modems
could conceivably allow an attacker to steal phone time and incur
long-distance charges on your company’s dime. Make sure you
know what’s going on with modems and phone lines to avoid
big phone bills or network intrusion.
■
Callback procedures are not conﬁgured correctly One
way to increase security is to implement a callback feature on the
modem so that a caller’s call disconnects and the modem calls
back a preprogrammed number. Ensure that if callback proce-
dures are used, on establishment of the callback connection the
communications device requires the user to authenticate to the
system.
■
RAS/NAS server is not located in a screened subnet
Allowing a remote connection to the private network unchecked
by the ﬁrewall enables a mobile user to violate the security policy
and put the network infrastructure in a vulnerable position.The
risk would be magniﬁed if a remote access session were hijacked.
■
The RAS/NAS is not conﬁgured to use PPP To securely
protect the network, Network Access Servers (NAS) and access
to them must be controlled to guard against outside or unautho-
rized intrusion, which could result in system or network compro-
mise. If the NAS is accessed remotely, the risk of compromising a
password or user ID increases.The authentication of the remote
nodes must be controlled by encryption such as CHAP with
MD5 or MS-CHAP with MD4.
■
VPN gateway is located behind the ﬁrewall Allowing a
remote connection to the private network unchecked by the ﬁre-
wall enables a mobile user to violate the security policy and put
the network infrastructure in a vulnerable position.The risk
would be magniﬁed if the VPN connection were hijacked.
www.syngress.com
IT Infrastructure Security Plan • Chapter 11
407

■
The VPN connection is not using IPSec’s ESP tunnel
Ensure that remote access via VPN uses IPSec ESP in tunnel
mode. For legacy support, L2TP may be used if IPSec provides
encryption or another technology that provides security such as
AES, 3DES, SSH, or SSL.
■
VPN is not conﬁgured as a tunnel type VPN Be sure that
VPNs are established as tunnel type VPNs, which terminate out-
side the ﬁrewall (in other words, between the router and the ﬁre-
wall, or connected to an outside interface of the router). If VPNs
terminate inside the ﬁrewall, you basically have taken the ﬁrewall
out of the security mix and reduced your line of defense by one.
Improperly deployed VPNs take away a ﬁrewall’s ability to audit
useful information.
We’ve walked through a lot of very speciﬁc security information in
this section, some of which might be relevant to your organization, some
of which might not be. What is highly likely, though, is that if you even
scanned this section, you thought of a few things you might otherwise
have overlooked, or it sparked you to make a note to check one thing or
another.The key is to be thorough, and to that end, this list should have
helped you make sure you covered some of the nitty-gritty details of net-
work infrastructure security.
Project Parameters
It’s time now to plan your infrastructure security project. We’ve covered a
lot of detail, and now we’ll try to focus it down into a project plan that
you can use to secure your infrastructure. Let’s start with our problem and
mission (outcome) statements. Remember, this is a good time to gather
your core IT project team together to help you begin deﬁning the basic
project parameters.You probably could do some (or all) of this prelimi-
nary work on your own, but there’s a lot to be said for getting the core
team ﬁred up and engaged with the project from the very start.You’re less
likely to have gaps in the project plan if you start relying on the “two
www.syngress.com
408
Chapter 11 • IT Infrastructure Security Plan

heads are better” theory right from the start. Here are two sample
problem statements you can use to begin developing your own:
Our network infrastructure is vulnerable to attack because
our security technologies have not kept pace with changes
in the external environment. We currently do not have a
meaningful approach to security, and all measures in place
have been ad hoc or reactive. We are not conﬁdent of our
level of security across the enterprise.
We recently experienced a security breach that caused a net-
work outage for three days. We were fortunate that no sen-
sitive data appears to have been stolen or compromised. We
took remedial measures, but we are not conﬁdent that our
data or our network is secure. 
Next, let’s look at the mission or outcome statement for these
problem statements. What’s the desired outcome in both of these cases?
The short answer is a secure network. We can probably use a single out-
come statement for both problems, and it might look something like this:
We want to create and implement a comprehensive infras-
tructure security plan so that we are conﬁdent we have
developed and can maintain as secure a network environ-
ment as is reasonably possible.
Your possible solutions run the gamut, but we’re going to assume that
you’ve made the decision to secure your network infrastructure by devel-
oping a security plan focused on network infrastructure.That being the
case, let’s look at the requirements for this project.
Requirements
If you haven’t done so, gather your core project team to work with you on
the requirements. Requirements are those areas the project must address;
in some respects, this is the real foundation of your project.Whatever is
deﬁned in the requirements should be implemented in the project, and
whatever’s in the project should be deﬁned by the requirements. Success
www.syngress.com
IT Infrastructure Security Plan • Chapter 11
409

factors, those things required to make the project successful, can be
deﬁned within your requirements here or as part of your assumptions (dis-
cussed later in this chapter).
Functional Requirements
The functional requirements for your infrastructure security project will
vary from the list we’re providing, but your list should have the same
overall elements. Where we would expect to see more divergence is in
the technical requirements, which we’ll discuss in a moment. Functional
requirements might include:
■
Physically secure premises
■
Secure network infrastructure servers
■
Secure network components (ﬁrewalls, routers, switches)
■
Secure local communication (authentication, access control,
encryption)
■
Secure remote communication (authentication, access control,
encryption)
■
Secure user devices (operating system, antivirus, antispyware,
application, ﬁle system)
■
Create secure operating procedures
■
Create documentation
Technical Requirements
Clearly, the technical requirements for your infrastructure security project
will vary greatly from whatever list we provide, because the technical
requirements are based on the speciﬁc network topology, server types,
server operating systems, communication methods, authentication
methods, and more.The lengthy list of items presented earlier in this
chapter should provide you with plenty of ideas and material for creating
your technical requirements for the project. Instead of going into detail
www.syngress.com
410
Chapter 11 • IT Infrastructure Security Plan

here, we present the categories that you should include; the details under
those categories are up to you, based on your unique requirements.
Remember, technical requirements should describe the “how” of your
functional requirements. So, as you work through this section, keep in
mind that you should be describing, very speciﬁcally, how you will
implement the functional requirements via technology.Your technical
requirements should be detailed in describing how these things will be
accomplished, but be careful to stick to describing the requirement. Let’s
take “Physically secure the premises” as an example.You don’t need to
describe how the premises will actually be secured (“Phil will get a
screwdriver and install a deadbolt …”); you need to describe the technical
details of how it will be secured. So, let’s say you’re the only tenant in a
building.You might describe your technical requirement in this manner:
■
Upgrade all external entry doors to card-swipe system. Card-
swipe system should be compatible with the existing employee
card system, XYZ. (You might include the technical specs of this
system here as well.)
■
Install security monitoring system (with cameras) focused on
parking lot and all external doorways (3). System should be able
to record continuously for 24 hours, cameras should be able to
record in slow motion and high resolution, the system should be
able to “respond” to potential incidents, and the system should
record events and have at least three methods of administrator
alert.
These are just some of the ways you can capture technical require-
ments. Clearly, if you’re talking about a server, you would include pro-
cessor speed, memory speciﬁcations, disk drive speciﬁcations, operating
system, and so on. However, other kinds of less technical elements, such as
how to secure the premises, might look like the example provided. If
your card-swipe system, for example, must conform to certain standards,
those standards should be included as well.
www.syngress.com
IT Infrastructure Security Plan • Chapter 11
411

Legal/Compliance Requirements
Create a list of the functional, technical, and administrative requirements
for your infrastructure security project based on the legal, regulatory, and
compliance requirements.Taking time to translate these requirements into
project requirements at this juncture will help ensure that you build com-
pliance requirements into your project. In standard project management,
it’s always easier to build something in at the front end than to add it at
the back end (it reduces errors, omissions, time, and cost), so now’s the
time to add these requirements to the greatest extent possible.Also, be
sure to add milestones and documentation requirements to your project
plan based on compliance needs.
Policy Requirements
Policy requirements may fall under functional requirements, but there’s
no rule that you can’t include policy requirements as a distinct category
of requirements if doing so helps you cover all the bases. We’ll look at
policies in more detail in a later chapter, but for now, let’s walk through a
few ideas for policies related to securing the infrastructure:
■
User policies
■
Network access policies
■
Remote access policies
■
Wireless policies
■
Network administration/network management policies
■
Server policies
■
Firewall, IDS/IPS, DMZ policies
■
Regulatory/compliance policies
■
Corporate policies
■
Legal policies

Chapter 11 • IT Infrastructure Security Plan

Scope
At this point, you should have an idea of the scope of your project.You
could choose to address your complete infrastructure security needs
during this project, or you might choose to parse it out into smaller sub-
projects and time them in stages or phases to meet organizational needs.
Making changes to the infrastructure comes with risk, and you’ll need to
be careful to take this fact into consideration as you plan your project.
This starts with determining the proper scope for your project. For
example, you might have recently implemented an IDS that you’re satis-
ﬁed with, so you could choose to include IDS in your project only to the
extent that it ties in with other infrastructure security measures. However,
you might feel that your biggest exposure is on network servers such as
DHCP, DNS, and directory servers, so your primary focus will be to
harden these servers and related network trafﬁc.Your assessment should
tell you where you need to focus and what must be included in the plan
and perhaps what can safely be omitted from your plan.Then clearly
deﬁne what is and what is not part of your project so that you leave
nothing open to interpretation.
Schedule
Since we haven’t created a detailed work breakdown structure (WBS) yet,
we can’t develop a detailed schedule, but we can begin to develop a
higher-level schedule. First, you should take a look at your organization
and see if there are any events or timelines that might come into play.You
certainly don’t want to be in the middle of a network outage (due to an
upgrade) when an important client is visiting, when your marketing
department has a big presentation coming up, or when your manufac-
turing group is working overtime to get a large order out.Taking organi-
zational needs into consideration is critical to project success and helps
grease the political gears as well.
In addition to organizational needs, you might know about other
timelines or constraints that should be considered in the schedule.Are
other security initiatives being planned or under way? If so, is there a log-
www.syngress.com
IT Infrastructure Security Plan • Chapter 11
413

ical order to the plans themselves? It might make sense to complete early
phases of an infrastructure security project before implementing a new
wireless network security plan, for example.Also, look at other IT pro-
jects to determine how they might impact the infrastructure security plan
or how the infrastructure security activities might disrupt or alter other
projects that are in the planning or implementation stages.
Finally, look at your talented IT staff and determine if there are any
scheduling issues that would impact your project, such as your best wire-
less or IP person heading out for vacation or your encryption specialist
planning to be out for a month on paternity leave. Whatever the case, if
you already know about these scheduling issues, you might as well begin
addressing them here.
You might have a rough idea of how long this project will take, given
what you’ve looked at thus far, and you may be able to see where it will
ﬁt in your overall IT schedule.You’ll have to balance the demands for
your IT resources with the need to secure the infrastructure, so this is a
good point to try to get a handle on some of those schedule constraints.
Budget
Your budget will be large or small depending on how well secured your
infrastructure currently is and how large your company is. For example, if
you already know that you’re going to have to upgrade some of those old
servers still running Windows NT (gasp), then your budget is going to
have to include a whole host of things like the server box itself, the oper-
ating system, license upgrades, and updated applications.As with
scheduling, you won’t have an exact amount in mind yet, but you might
have some large segments deﬁned or at least identiﬁed. Begin making a
list of the components you believe you’ve identiﬁed in terms of purchases
so you can verify (or modify) this list after you’ve created your WBS.Also
keep in mind that with an infrastructure security project, a large per-
centage of your budget might be expended on labor costs (if you track
internal labor costs in your project) because much of the work entails
checking conﬁgurations and modifying settings.

Quality
You could deﬁne quality as the level of protection you’re willing to
accept, though it might be difﬁcult to quantify.As we’ve stated, quality is
a mindset, and you should instill this mindset in your IT project team.As
you deﬁne your project plan, you’ll have the opportunity to create spe-
ciﬁc quality metrics related to your infrastructure and incorporate them
into your task details. Remember that security comes from depth of
defense, so you want each layer you build to be as strong as it can be,
within the deﬁned constraints (time, cost, criticality, and so on) and
understanding that no system is 100-percent secure.
Once you’ve deﬁned the project parameters, it’s essential that you
develop your priorities. If you haven’t checked in with your project
sponsor, this would be a good time to discuss the priorities. What’s the
least ﬂexible element here? Are you expected to meet a particular dead-
line, or were you handed a set budget? Understanding which of these
parameters must be met will tell you how to make decisions during the
project work phase. If you have a deadline, you’ll focus your efforts on
making sure that the schedule stays on track, which might mean spending
a bit more on overtime than was in the original budget.As you know, in
projects something always changes and something has to give.
Understanding where that ﬂexibility should come from will help you
meet organizational requirements. Understand which parameter is least
ﬂexible and which is most ﬂexible. Discuss this with your project sponsor,
and make sure you’re clear and in agreement.That way, when project
work is under way, you won’t have to keep going back to your sponsor to
make basic decisions, and you’ll know you’re making decisions that sup-
port these priorities.
Key Skills Needed
For your network infrastructure security project, you’re going to need a
very wide variety of skills. Here we list some of the obvious ones; you
can add to (or modify) this list as you deﬁne your project:
www.syngress.com
IT Infrastructure Security Plan • Chapter 11
415

■
Network services Securing the infrastructure requires a solid
look at security settings on infrastructure servers such as DHCP,
DNS, and directory services servers.These key servers require a
deep understanding of the services they provide as well as an
understanding of best practices in each of these areas.
■
Network perimeter services Securing the perimeter involves
installing, conﬁguring, and managing components such as ﬁre-
walls, routers, proxy servers, and DMZs.These typically require a
strong background and ability to work with various protocols,
including SNMP, ICMP,TCP, IP, FTP, HTTPS, SSH, SSL 
and more.
■
Intrusion detection/intrusion prevention Installing and
conﬁguring IDS/IPS systems require a strong skill set in net-
working, understanding how information and IP trafﬁc ﬂows
through the network infrastructure, and understanding the kinds
of threats that are commonly launched (TCP, ICMP, etc.).
■
Remote access Securing remote access requires an under-
standing of communication devices and protocols as well as of
various authentication and encryption standards and methods.
RAS, VLAN, VPN, and tunneling are just a few of the concepts
needed in this area.
■
Wireless access Securing a wireless LAN is discussed in a later
chapter, but the skills here are the ability to understand and use
various wireless network tools (the same ones the hackers use)
and an understanding of how wireless networks are vulnerable
and can be protected using a variety of tools.
■
Servers and hosts These entail understanding operating sys-
tems, patches, upgrades, and vulnerabilities as well as how to
secure ﬁles, folders, data, and user accounts.
■
Network administration A strong understanding of network
administration tools and techniques, including the ability to audit,
www.syngress.com
416
Chapter 11 • IT Infrastructure Security Plan

review, and manage user and group accounts, access control lists,
services and protocols, and other administrative tasks, is critical.
■
Documentation You need people who are excellent at docu-
menting the systems, the proposed changes, the implemented
changes, and the ﬁnal infrastructure conﬁguration data.
Documentation may be required for legal or compliance require-
ments as well.
■
Communication You should have one or more people on your
team who are good at communicating and creating connections
within the organization. Since infrastructure changes can have a
big impact on business operations, you will need to effectively
and proactively communicate with various stakeholders and users
during the course of the project.
■
Training You might need to train users or IT staff on new
methods, technologies, or other changes that occur as a result of
implementing the infrastructure project plan.
Key Personnel Needed
Now that you’ve developed your list of needed skills, you can develop
your wish list for project team members.You might want to create your
“A” list and a backup list, but for political purposes, you might want to
call it your Primary and Secondary teams, to avoid rufﬂing any feathers.
Be sure to highlight the skills needed for which there are no internal
matches.This will indicate places you need to seek staff training or
external expertise.Also look at your personnel needed and get a sense for
how much you’re relying on a two or three people. It’s often the case that
we want the three people who are best to work on everything, but that
will slow your project down tremendously. Develop your personnel list,
then determine where your gaps are and how you’ll address those gaps.

IT Infrastructure Security Plan • Chapter 11

Project Processes and Procedures
As with any project, you should identify the processes and procedures
you’ll use during the duration of the project. We are assuming you have a
whole stash of those at your disposal, so we won’t run through the basics
here. However, there are ﬁve areas to keep in mind when you’re working
on an infrastructure security project; you might want to check that these
are in your processes and procedures. If not, add them as needed:
■
Testing procedures Deﬁne how, when, and where you’ll test
security solutions before implementing them on the live net-
work. Clearly, some things can be done on live systems; others
should be tested before going live. Deﬁne what should be tested
ofﬂine and how those testing scenarios should proceed.
■
Rollback procedures For any major changes you’re making, be
sure you’ve identiﬁed and tested reliable rollback plans so you can
roll back to a known good state in case things go wrong.
■
Escalation procedures These are standard in any project, but
when you’re dealing with the infrastructure, you might need to
beef this area up a bit to make sure you have the right people on
standby or on call when critical portions of the project are being
implemented.
■
Critical issue reporting As with other security projects, you
might want to review your critical issue-reporting procedures to
see whether you need to create a “team red response” that will
enable you and your project team to quickly address any vulnera-
bilities or issues that are deemed critical, severe, or extreme.
Develop the process for deﬁning these kinds of issues, and
develop an agreed-on scale or measurement system so your team
can quickly deal with imminent or urgent issues that may arise.
■
Documentation Depending on the nature of your project as
well as your regulatory or compliance requirements, you might
need to revisit your typical project documentation processes and
www.syngress.com
418
Chapter 11 • IT Infrastructure Security Plan

procedures so that you can create the kinds of documentation
your project requires, without sorting back through the project to
develop the documentation after the fact.
Project Team
We always recommend gathering at least your core team together to help
deﬁne the project, but at this point, you have deﬁned the skills and per-
sonnel you need, so you should be ready to create your project team.As
with almost all IT projects, you should involve subject matter experts
from outside the IT department so that you get a well-rounded view of
life within the organization, not just within the IT department.Also keep
in mind that with infrastructure issues, many areas are technically beyond
the grasp of many employees within the organization (well, most
everyone outside the IT department). Be patient, be prepared to explain
things in nontechnical ways, and don’t discuss technical details when it
isn’t absolutely necessary.You want to involve users and stakeholders in
appropriate ways, but there will be a more limited role for them in this
type of project than in most of the other kinds of IT security projects
you might undertake.
An infrastructure security project spans the entire enterprise and is as
deep as it is wide.To be successfully completed, the project requires an
extensive set of ﬁrst-rate skills. Be sure that your project team has all the
skills delineated in your skills assessment. If it does not, your project is at
risk because gaps in skills or skills that are not up to standards will create
problems in quality or scheduling down the line. Be sure you have all the
requisite skills; if you don’t, be sure to create a plan to address those gaps.
Whether you need additional external staff or just some training for
internal staff, be sure to add this to your budget and possibly your
schedule.
Develop your team, create a team roster, and get the team ready to
create the detailed project plan, especially the work breakdown structure.
www.syngress.com
IT Infrastructure Security Plan • Chapter 11
419

Project Organization
You might want to organize your project by the topic areas we’ve deﬁned
so that you have subteams dedicated to: devices and media, topologies,
IDS/IPS, and system hardening.You could choose to parse it out differ-
ently, or you might have the whole team, if it is small, work through each
stage of the project plan together. It’s up to you, and it’s certainly some-
what dependent on the size of your company, the size of the project, and
the size of your IT staff. Be sure that everyone is clear about what their
roles are within the team and within the project. Organizing your team
will provide the necessary structure for the team to be productive. Since
we’re assuming you’ve managed a lot of projects (or have read up on your
project management skills recently), we won’t delve into the details of
organizing this project except to make one note:The work in the various
segments of this project overlaps a lot, and if your project and team are
not well organized, you’re going to have people working at cross-pur-
poses and creating a big mess. Keep the project and your team organized
to avoid this scenario.
Project Work Breakdown Structure
Your approach to creating your work breakdown structure (WBS) might
be different from the method we provide; that’s ﬁne as long as you cover
the basics. Our recommended approach is to start with your mission
statement and your selected solution and create three to ﬁve high-level
objectives. From there, you can parse each of those objectives down into
smaller components until you have tasks that actually make sense and are
understandable.Tasks should be broken down until they represent an
understandable and manageable unit of work.The 80/8 rule is a good
one to keep in mind; it states that no task should exceed 80 hours or be
less than 8 hours. If a task is longer than 80 hours, it needs to be broken
down into smaller components. If you deﬁne tasks of less than 8 hours,
you’ll end up with a scheduling nightmare on your hands.

420
Chapter 11 • IT Infrastructure Security Plan

We’ll start with the four major areas we discussed at the opening of
this chapter:
1. Devices and media
2. Topologies
3. Intrusion detection/intrusion prevention
4. System hardening
If you recall from prior chapters, these are not properly written as
tasks or even as objectives; they’re topic labels. So, let’s ﬁx that and create
the top-level objectives based on these four areas of concern:
1. Audit and secure devices and media 
2. Audit and secure network topology
3. Implement or harden intrusion prevention/detection systems
4. Harden systems
Now we have a better starting point for our WBS. From here, we can
break these down into smaller tasks. We’re not going to dig down as deep
as you’ll need to, because once you get beyond a certain level of detail,
the plan is very much dependent on the nature and structure of your
organization and how you and your team decide to approach the project.
So, don’t ﬁght with the structure presented here; use it as a guide to
create one that works for you.Also note that where servers or other
devices may be called out, the numbers or types of devices may not track
with standard networking practices.They are presented as examples of a
WBS tree, not necessarily examples of best practices in networking. In
reality, you will have more or fewer DNS servers, but we only mention
one.You will have a long list of tasks under Task 3.4,“Assess and harden
routers, switches, and other network communication devices.” We didn’t
dig down at all levels of the WBS but provided samples of how or where
you might develop additional tasks and subtasks.And, while this list is
long, it’s not as long as your infrastructure security project plan’s WBS
will end up being. However, this should give you a running start:

Once you’ve completed the WBS, you need to go through with your
subject matter experts and develop the task details. Details can include
task owners, resources, known constraints, or requirements for the task,
task duration, task cost or budget, tools or equipment needed for the task,
completion criteria, deadline or due date, and any other data relevant to
the task and its successful completion. Remember that the functional,
technical, and legal requirements should be fully incorporated into the
project task detail or they will get lost.This is a great opportunity to
review your requirements and go through your task details to ensure that
everything is included, before project work starts.
This is also a point at which you should do a scope check and make
sure that the WBS describes your intended scope. It’s fairly common for
the scope described by the WBS to be larger than the stated scope. In
fact, this is often the ﬁrst source of “scope creep.” Look at your scope
statement and at your WBS and reconcile any discrepancies. For example,
www.syngress.com
426
Chapter 11 • IT Infrastructure Security Plan

you might have stated in your scope statement that something was not
part of the project scope but that element shows up in the WBS. Decide
if that element should be in or out, then adjust either your scope state-
ment or your WBS accordingly. If there are substantive changes to your
scope, check in with your project sponsor to gain agreement as to the
modiﬁed or updated scope and WBS.
Project Risks and Mitigation Strategies
This section of your project plan deﬁnes the risks to your project and the
strategies you’ll use to avoid or mitigate your risk.There are always risks
with every project, and it’s important to take time to identify those risks
while you’re calm, cool, and collected.There are some projects for which
the risks outweigh the beneﬁts and you decide, as a team or an organiza-
tion, to not go down that path. Securing the infrastructure is not likely to
fall into that category, but it’s always important to keep this in mind—that
sometimes doing nothing is a better choice.
However, you’ve decided to strengthen security on your network
infrastructure and there are attendant risks. Let’s look at one risk you
might have, and you can then use this structure to develop additional risk
and mitigation strategies. We’ll use the following ranking system: 1 =
Extremely high, 5 = Extremely low.
Risk: Improper conﬁguration could completely disable 
network.
1. Criticality: 1
2. Likelihood of occurrence: 3
3. Relative risk ranking: 2
4. Mitigation strategy 1:Test all conﬁgurations in lab prior to
rollout.
5. Risk of mitigation 1: Not all lab tests will completely mirror
actual conditions.
www.syngress.com
IT Infrastructure Security Plan • Chapter 11
427

6. Mitigation strategy 2: Develop fail-safe rollback plans for all crit-
ical conﬁguration changes.
7. Risk of mitigation 2: Rollback will take time and set back project
completion timelines.
8. Trigger 1: One week prior to scheduled conﬁguration change.
9. Trigger 2: Forty-ﬁve minutes after network outage occurs.
10. Notes:All conﬁguration changes will be tested in the lab ﬁrst, but
the there is still a chance that the conﬁguration change could
cause the network to crash. If this occurs, rollback plans will be
implemented after 45 minutes of network downtime have
elapsed.
As you can see from this single example, you can develop sound con-
tingency plans for risks you decide are worth planning for. Some risks are
too small to bother planning for; other risks are signiﬁcant but unlikely to
occur, and planning for them would also not be a good use of time.
Once you’ve listed every risk you can think of, you can develop a
ranked list based on both criticality and likelihood of occurrence. From
there, you can develop mitigation strategies for just the most critical and
most likely-to-occur risks.You may choose to develop more than one
mitigation strategy. In our example, our ﬁrst choice was to test in the lab,
but we also conceded that testing in the lab may not mirror real-world
results and the risk of our mitigation strategy had to be addressed as well.
In this case, we developed a secondary or backup mitigation strategy as a
fail-safe option. Both mitigation strategies require a deﬁned trigger—how
will you know when to implement your risk mitigation plan? In this
case, you might choose to build lab testing into your project plan for all
conﬁguration change tasks and avoid this ﬁrst mitigation strategy.
However, you would still need the second mitigation strategy and trigger
in the event that you ran into a conﬁguration problem that you couldn’t
immediately ﬁnd. In this case, after a 45-minute outage you’d go to Plan
B, your predetermined rollback plan. It’s nice to have Plan B ready to go
when you’re running around like you hair is on ﬁre because you have 47
www.syngress.com
428
Chapter 11 • IT Infrastructure Security Plan

different people asking you when the network will be back up, what the
problem is, and why they can’t log onto the network.
Project Constraints and Assumptions
Constraints for an infrastructure security project might come in all shapes
and sizes.You may well face budgetary constraints that limit the scope of
your project.You might face scope problems because the infrastructure
needs a lot of upgrading but your company isn’t willing to implement all
the changes needed, for a variety of ﬁnancial, political, and organizational
reasons.You might face resistance within the organization because some
changes impact users’ computing behaviors, and this can cause problems.
In addition, you may face speciﬁc constraints or limits within portions of
your project. For a variety of reasons, you might not be able to make
changes to application servers or database servers due to other projects
under way or other organizational issues.The infrastructure security is
core to your network’s security, so constraints to the project should be
clearly identiﬁed and discussed. If the constraints are too great or impede
your project too much, you should have a talk with your project sponsor.
Although every project has to deal with a variety of constraints, you must
decide whether the constraints are reasonable or if they place an undue
burden on your project.You are responsible for project success and, ulti-
mately, for the security of the infrastructure, so it’s up to you to clear
away these obstacles or get your project sponsor involved with removing
them so the project can be successful.
Equally important is delineating the assumptions you’re working
under as you move into the project. For example, if you assume certain
resources will be available or if you assume that other projects will be
completed ﬁrst, you should state that clearly.Your assumptions should be
clearly delineated so that you and your team can challenge, clarify, or con-
ﬁrm those assumptions before proceeding with the project.The most dan-
gerous assumptions are the ones we don’t know we’re making.
For example, if you’ve been in the midst of deploying a particular
encryption method, your project would work on the assumption that the
www.syngress.com
IT Infrastructure Security Plan • Chapter 11
429

encryption scheme was already in place or was being deployed.This fact
is critical to note in your project because, if something outside your con-
trol changes the encryption scheme on which your infrastructure project
is based, you’ll have to rework your project plan.This could (and probably
would) impact both your schedule and your budget. It’s hard enough to
bring a project in on time and on budget without having the project
environment shift around on you. Listing the assumptions you’re making
going into the project will help you as you develop your plan as well
because others on the team or in the organization can challenge your
assumptions, if they know what they are.To go back to the encryption
example, if you list this as an assumption and someone on your project
team lets you know that the encryption project was put on hold for one
reason or another, it’s good to know that ahead of time rather than plan-
ning based on that incorrect assumption.
Some project managers like to list project success factors in their list
of assumptions because they are assuming these factors will be in place or
will occur.You can also discuss and deﬁne success factors at the front of
your project-planning process, if that’s a more logical ﬂow for you. Some
teams don’t know what it will take to be successful until they’ve neared
the end of their deﬁnition and planning work; others like to deﬁne these
elements right up front. Whatever works for you is ﬁne. Just be sure to
deﬁne these so you’ll know what it will take for your project to succeed.
You and your project team will have to look at the project environ-
ment and list the constraints and the assumptions you’re making in order
for your project to get off to a good start and to have a better-than-
average chance for success.These elements are unique to each project and
each company, so we can’t give you a list of things to place in this sec-
tion, but now that we’ve discussed them in general terms, you and your
team should be able to dig in and ﬁnd the constraints and assumptions for
your own, unique infrastructure security project.

Chapter 11 • IT Infrastructure Security Plan

Project Schedule and Budget
You can see from the lengthy project plan we’ve created that your
schedule and budget are going to be challenging to develop. Once you’ve
created your WBS, you can look through your task details and begin
developing your schedule.The schedule is best developed in a project
management software program since you will have a lot of moving parts
to handle. If you have subteams working in parallel on different aspects of
the project plan, be sure you address this in your schedule. First, you’ll
have to be sure you’re not double-booking someone and throwing your
schedule off. Second, you want to keep an eye on how different segments
of the project will impact other segments so you don’t end up working at
cross-purposes, or worse, damaging something another team just imple-
mented. If one team is upgrading the ﬁrewalls and another team is
working on IPS, it’s entirely possible one team’s work will greatly impact
the other team’s work and cause confusion, problems, errors, or omissions.
Be sure to check your critical path tasks after you’ve loaded your
schedule into the software program, since these tasks will determine the
longest, least-ﬂexible path through your project.Although we haven’t dis-
cussed the more technical aspects of scheduling (we assume you know
them), recall that you can indicate lead and lag times as well as ﬂoat to
create a more realistic schedule. If everything in your project plan ends up
on the critical path, or if none of your tasks end up on the critical path,
there’s a good chance you have a fundamental problem with how your
schedule is set up.
As for budget, you should have a pretty clear idea of what this project
will cost at this point, with one notable exception. If you are using your
infrastructure security project plan to evaluate the need for an IDS, IPS,
DMZ, or other network equipment, you might not yet have sufﬁcient
data with which to get bids for these systems. In that case, you need some
sort of placeholder to indicate that a system will be purchased but the
system has yet to be clearly deﬁned and therefore cannot be spec’d out or
priced. If you know the order of magnitude, it might be good to add a
dollar-amount placeholder. For example, suppose you know that one type
www.syngress.com
IT Infrastructure Security Plan • Chapter 11
431

of system you’re looking for costs about $18,000, plus or minus $2,000.
You might want to put $20,000 into your budget as a placeholder so that
when your project budget is approved, you have that cost built in. It’s
usually difﬁcult to get your budget increased after it’s been approved,
unless you speciﬁcally get your budget approved with the understanding
that it does not include the cost of new hardware or software solutions
that may be recommended as a result of the project assessment.
If you’ve made it this far, you’ve made it to the end of the chapter and
the end of your planning cycle for your infrastructure security project
plan. It’s a lot to cover because the infrastructure is wide and deep, but if
you take time to step through your planning in a measured, thoughtful
manner, you’ll end up with better results than if you just rush headlong
into the project work.That’s a guarantee.Your project might not be per-
fect, it could come in late or over budget, but whatever result you turn in
will be far better than if you used no consistent approach or framework
at all.

Summary
We’ve covered a lot of ground in this chapter because your network
infrastructure is literally and ﬁguratively the backbone of your network.
Infrastructure security touches every aspect of your network, and a thor-
ough assessment will take time and careful effort to complete so that your
network is as secure as it can reasonably be, given the organizational con-
straints and considerations you’ll have to deal with. It’s often helpful to
break the network infrastructure down into it systems or areas to help
ensure that you cover all the areas, including devices and media, topology,
intrusion detection and prevention, system hardening, and all the network
components such as routers, switches, and modems. Once you’ve identi-
ﬁed all the areas, you need to take a top-to-bottom look at how security
is currently implemented and what threats exist. By looking at issues such
as information criticality and performing an impact analysis, you can
decide what should be included in your project and what can reasonably
be left out or delayed for a later phase if needed. Understanding the
threat environment and your network’s vulnerabilities is also important
during your planning phase.
Requirements need to be thoroughly developed because they form
the foundation of your project’s scope. Functional requirements should be
developed ﬁrst, followed by technical, legal, and policy requirements. Be
sure to build these into your task details when you create your WBS so
that all required elements will be present and accounted for in your pro-
ject plan.
In an infrastructure security project, you’ll need a wide variety of
skills that span the depth and breadth of networking knowledge. Be sure
you deﬁne the skills you’ll need so that you can assess your team and
your organization to identify skills gaps.These will have to be addressed
before your project can proceed, and this often requires hiring outside
contractors or providing training for internal staff members. Either way,
this can impact both your budget and your schedule, so be sure you do a
gap analysis between needed and available skills prior to proceeding with
your project.

The WBS deﬁnes the scope of your project, so once you’ve identiﬁed
all the work through delineating the tasks, be sure to do a scope check. If
the deﬁned scope is smaller than the scope outlined in your WBS, you
need to reconcile the differences.Also be sure to discuss any scope
changes with your project sponsor so that you start off with the same
expectations about project results.
Scheduling an infrastructure security project can be challenging due
to all the moving parts involved.You’ll run into scheduling conﬂicts,
resource usage conﬂicts, timing issues, and more.These should be resolved
to the greatest degree possible before starting the project, because things
will only get more complicated and difﬁcult to resolve once project work
is under way. One important scheduling note is that with all areas of your
network being poked and prodded, you’ll need to make sure subproject
teams are not working at cross-purposes and undoing work just done or
inadvertently injecting false indicators into the process through their own
task work.
When it’s all said and done, you should be able to deﬁne, implement,
manage, and close a very successful infrastructure security project, if you
follow a consistent methodology and make teamwork and quality top-
most priorities.This is the foundation of all other security projects; it
touches on everything in your organization, so success here will create
the framework for a very secure network that will help you sleep at
night, knowing you’ve done everything possible to keep your organiza-
tion’s assets secure.

Infrastructure Security Auditing
 Auditing or assessing the infrastructure security is a large task that
encompasses every aspect of your network.

 Infrastructure projects cross several boundaries, and you should be
sure that any overlap is addressed so you are not working at cross-
purposes.
 The infrastructure project can be parsed out in numerous ways.
One way is to look at it in terms of these systems: network
perimeter, internal network, intrusion monitoring and
prevention, host and server conﬁguration, malicious code
protection, incident response capabilities, security policies and
procedures, employee awareness and training, and physical
security and monitoring.
 The internal and external environments should be assessed
thoroughly prior to planning your project.
 Internal factors include understanding information criticality, the
potential impact of a breach, the information ﬂow, policies and
procedures, user needs, and regulatory/compliance issues.
 Externally, you need to consider the types of threats your
network is vulnerable to, including spooﬁng, repudiation, data
tampering, denial of service, and elevation of privileges.
 The SAN Institute publishes a list of the top 20 vulnerabilities
that can serve as a great starting point for assessing your network’s
vulnerabilities.
 The assessment should look at devices and media, topologies,
intrusion detection/intrusion prevention systems, and system
hardening.
 Devices and media include all the network infrastructure devices
that must be secured, including routers, switches, and modems.
Project Parameters
 Deﬁning the functional and technical speciﬁcations for your
infrastructure project will deﬁne the scope of work you need to
accomplish.
www.syngress.com
436
Chapter 11 • IT Infrastructure Security Plan

 There could be speciﬁc legal or regulatory compliance issues to
be addressed within the scope of your infrastructure security
plan; you should include these issues in the early stages of project
planning.
 Deﬁning scope, initial budget, initial schedule, and quality
guidelines based on the functional, technical, legal, and policy
requirements gives you a solid starting point.
 Developing the relative priority of your parameters and gaining
project sponsor agreement is important in helping you know
how to make decisions for your project, moving forward.The
least ﬂexible parameter will be your constraint; the most ﬂexible
parameter will be what “gives” when things change in the course
of project work.
 Technical skills needed for the project include network services,
network perimeter, intrusion detection/prevention, remote
access, wireless access, server and host administration, familiarity
with protocols, ports, and services as well as skills in
documentation, communication, and training.
Project Team
 Your core project team should help in deﬁning the project.
 Your infrastructure project team should include people with the
needed skills, which, in an infrastructure security project, are
extensive.
 Your project is at risk if you don’t have the skills you need on
your team. Be sure to address skills gaps before you start project
work and add any associated costs into your project budget.

IT Infrastructure Security Plan • Chapter 11
437

Project Organization
 The project should be organized around areas of the network and
areas of expertise.
 Typical organizational methods should form the foundation of
your project organization.
 Infrastructure projects require extra coordination to ensure that
subteams are not working at cross-purposes.
Project Work Breakdown Structure
 The work breakdown structure, or WBS, for an infrastructure
project should begin with the high-level objectives for your
project, which might include securing devices and media,
securing the perimeter, securing infrastructure components, or
whatever way you choose to segment the work in this project.
 Task details should reﬂect the functional, technical, and regulatory
requirements for your project. Check task details against
requirements to be sure everything is included at the outset.
 The scope statement and the scope described by the WBS might
not be in sync. Compare them and make any modiﬁcations
needed to either your scope statement or your WBS before
proceeding.
 If there are signiﬁcant changes to your scope statement, check in
with your project sponsor before proceeding to ensure that you’re
both on the same page with regard to scope.
Project Risks and Mitigation Strategies
 The risks inherent in an infrastructure project are many because
this type of project touches every aspect of your network.
www.syngress.com
438
Chapter 11 • IT Infrastructure Security Plan

 Identify all potential risks and rank them according to criticality
and likelihood of occurrence, then look over the list and make
any reasonable adjustments.
 Determine how far down your risk list you will plan, then
develop mitigation strategies and triggers for each deﬁned risk.
 If you determine that there are one or more signiﬁcant risks, you
should sit down and talk them over with your project sponsor. In
some cases, the risks outweigh any potential beneﬁt and the
project should be canceled, redeﬁned, or postponed until those
risks can be more clearly evaluated and addressed.
Project Constraints and Assumptions
 Constraints are present in every project, but in an infrastructure
security project, you could have constraints on several fronts.
 If the constraints are too great, they can hinder or prevent project
success. Discuss major constraints with your project sponsor to
determine the best course of action. Otherwise, develop ways to
address these constraints or plan around them.
 Clearly delineating assumptions is an important part of your
infrastructure security plan because you have to work from a
known good point.
 If your assumptions are stated, they can be challenged, clariﬁed, or
conﬁrmed.
 Assumptions may also include success factors, since you might be
assuming certain factors must be in place for the project to
succeed. Success factors are also sometimes developed in the
requirements phase of the project-planning process, depending on
how you go about identifying them.
www.syngress.com
IT Infrastructure Security Plan • Chapter 11
439

Project Schedule and Budget
 After you’ve developed your project’s WBS, you should have
sufﬁcient data to create a fairly realistic and feasible project
schedule and budget.
 Keep in mind that the project schedule has a lot of moving parts,
and you’re likely to run into issues around conﬂicting resource
demands or subteams working at cross-purposes.
 Be sure your budget provides for adequate training or hiring of
needed resources.
 Large purchases such as IDS/IPS or other major components
might not be decided at the outset of the project. Create ballpark
estimates or insert placeholders in your budget so it is clear
whether or not large-ticket items are included or speciﬁcally
excluded from your project budget.

Introduction
In this chapter, we’ll provide the framework for creating a wireless secu-
rity project as part of your overall corporate IT security strategy.As with
all the individual security area projects (ISAPs) discussed in this book, it is
intended to be a template to use as a starting point.There is no one-size-
ﬁts-all project plan for any security topic, and wireless security is no
exception.You will need to modify this project plan to ﬁt your organiza-
tional needs in many different ways but you will ﬁnd the basic building
blocks here.
Wireless technology continues to evolve and so, too, do the tools
hackers use to gain unauthorized access to wireless networks. Even as
recently as two years ago, a majority of corporate wireless networks were
unsecured, allowing anyone with a wireless card to access the network. In
the past couple of years, more companies have begun securing their wire-
less networks in a variety of ways (though a surprising number are still
unsecured). Some companies have created a separate wireless network for
customers or guests that does not connect in any way to the corporate
network (such as those often found in hotels, coffee shops, and airports).
Other companies have applied basic security such as Wired Equivalent
Privacy (WEP), which was once thought to be secure but has since been
shown to be hackable; or Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA), a stronger but
more difﬁcult-to-administer security solution for wireless. We won’t get
into the pros and cons of various wireless security solutions in this
chapter, though we will discuss various technical elements and let you
decide what will work best for your organization.
Even if your company does not have a wireless network, you still need to per-
form an audit because an intruder or employee can easily install a rogue wireless
access point at just about any place on the wired network to provide unauthorized
wireless access. So, don’t think that because your IT department hasn’t
implemented a wireless network that others (inside and out) haven’t
already done so without your knowledge.The bottom line is this: wireless
networks must be secured to meet the speciﬁc needs of your organization
www.syngress.com
442
Chapter 12 • Wireless Security Project Plan

and you must also be aware of all wireless access to the network. In this
chapter, we’ll get you started down that path.
In addition, a laptop with a wireless connection at an airport or hotel
lobby accessing the corporate network via the Internet exposes your ﬁrm
to the same wireless hazards as a corporate wireless network does, so you
do need to have a wireless security plan for your organization.
Wireless Security Auditing
Before you can embark on just about any IT security project, you need
to understand the current environment. In project management, as we’ve
stated several times, you should start with a problem statement.The
problem statement for wireless security can be as general as,“We don’t
have adequate security for our wireless network and corporate resources
are at risk.” However, the more speciﬁc you get, the better your solution
will be. If you say,“We currently have 25 wireless access points (WAP)
that are operating without security and we have no idea how many rogue
WAPs we have,” you are getting closer to deﬁning the real problem and
closer to identifying the real need. One way to develop a solid problem
statement can be through auditing.
Auditing means different things to different people but we’ll use a
deﬁnition commonly used in the IT security world: a thorough and
methodical review of systems and technologies focusing on ﬁnding vul-
nerabilities. Some companies hire outside security consultants to assist
with their security auditing. If you choose to perform your own wireless
security audit, you’re going to need several tools to do so and you’re also
going to need to put on your “hacker’s hat” so you can discover vulnera-
bilities hackers would likely exploit.
Hackers, like robbers or car thieves, will attack the easiest targets ﬁrst.
In the case of wireless networks, they’ll certainly take an unsecured wire-
less network over a protected one any day.Although both WEP and WPA
can be hacked, both require more time, effort, data, and sophistication to
do so. Just like the car thief, the easiest car to steal is a car that is (in this
order):
www.syngress.com
Wireless Security Project Plan • Chapter 12
443

1. Running with the key in the ignition.
2. Unlocked.
3. Locked.
4. Locked and using a security device (e.g., a steering wheel lock).
5. Locked, with an alarm system.
6. Locked, with an alarm system and an engine-disabling device.
For a hacker, the easiest networks to hack are those that are unse-
cured. However, corporations can be pretty rich targets for hackers—
either because of the presence of personal data on the network (credit
cards, personal identiﬁcation, etc.) or because they can access corporate
trade secrets, R&D, and other conﬁdential corporate data. Hackers will
try to ﬁnd a way in if they believe it’s fun, interesting, or lucrative to do
so. Finally, there is simply the hacker-of-convenience who hacks into a
network just to see if he or she can.Therefore, your goal in wireless net-
work auditing is to ﬁnd the vulnerabilities from easiest to hardest (just
like our car thief). If you plug the obvious holes, you’re better off than
doing nothing, but you’re not secure.
Also keep in mind that there are a growing number of wireless
devices, all of which you need to manage. Users with laptops, PDAs,
smart phones, and other devices are accessing all kinds of information on
the Internet, both from your corporate network and elsewhere.They’re
like little kids out playing at school—you have no idea what they may
have gotten into and what kinds of viruses they may bring into the orga-
nization, all through relatively innocent activities. It doesn’t really matter
how secure your network is if traveling employees access conﬁdential data
across an unsecured link.These are the kinds of things you need to be
aware of when you assess your wireless environment from end to end.

Business Intelligence…
Outside Consultants Sometimes Make Sense
Our goal is not to push you to use outside consultants, but to remind
you that there are expert resources available to you. When it comes to
security, you may just want to hire a specialist. Think of it this way: If you
sprain your ankle or break your leg, you can go see just about any com-
petent medical doctor for treatment, but if you have a leaking heart
valve or some other more difﬁcult medical problem, you want a spe-
cialist who has been down this path hundreds (if not thousands) of
times. You want someone who knows this specialty cold, who brings his
or her experience, expertise, and specialized training to your aid. The
same is true of a security consultant who has solid credentials. He or she
will know the common security holes, common errors made in corporate
security, and the latest tools and techniques for assessing and tightening
security. If you have this type of specialized expertise on your IT team,
you’re in great shape. If you don’t, you may look to an outside consul-
tant to help you audit your security (from a full network audit to indi-
vidual security area audits) so you can develop the best security plan
possible. Although an outside consultant might cost you more initially,
it is likely that in most companies that cost will be quickly offset by a
more thorough and reliable security audit report, shorter time to imple-
ment appropriate security solutions, and higher overall security. One
caveat: Know what you’re looking for before you sit through security
consultant presentations. If possible, work with a ﬁrm you’re familiar
with or that comes highly recommended to you and always check refer-
ences. You want to ﬁnd the right ﬁrm for your company and your pro-
ject, not the ﬁrm with the most persuasive sales team or the glitziest
PowerPoint presentation.
Types of Wireless 
Network Components and Devices
There is a long list of actual devices that can be used in a variety of wire-
less environments. For now, let’s look at the top-level categories.These
include:

Wireless Technologies
Although it’s important to be aware of the various kinds of wireless tech-
nologies, the primary focus is on the standard wireless networking com-
ponents we’re all pretty used to by now. Let’s take a brief detour to
understand the wireless standards.
The wireless standard issued by the Institute of Electrical and
Electronic Engineers (IEEE) is known as IEEE 802.11. Here’s a quick
summary:
■
802.11 Has data speeds of up to 2 megabits per second (Mbps)
and uses either Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum (FHSS) or
Direct-Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS) transmission tech-
niques. Even though both are based in the ISM (Industrial,
Scientiﬁc, and Medical) radio band, FHSS and DSSS devices
cannot network with each other.
■
802.11a Has data speeds of up to 54 Mbps and uses the
Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) tech-
nique in the U-NII (Unlicensed National Information
Infrastructure) radio band.
■
802.11b Has data speeds of up to 11 Mbps and uses only the
DSSS technique in the ISM radio band. It’s backward-compatible
with 802.11 DSSS devices.
■
802.11g Has data speeds of up to 54Mbps and uses both OFDM
and DSSS techniques in the ISM radio band. Use of the DSSS
allows it to be backward-compatible with 802.11b and 802.11
DSSS devices.
■
802.11n This is the latest Wi-Fi standard but results aren’t in yet.
There are reports that there are interoperability problems so most
consumers and businesses are taking a wait-and-see approach.
Although 802.11 debuted in the mid-1990s, wireless networking
didn’t become a big consumer item until the introduction of inexpensive
802.11b equipment in 2001. Even though the 802.11a standard was rati-
www.syngress.com
448
Chapter 12 • Wireless Security Project Plan

ﬁed just prior to 802.11b, most manufacturers made “b” equipment ﬁrst.
802.11a has a very short range in comparison to any of the other stan-
dards, due to the U-NII band, and has never gained much popularity.The
subsequent standard, 802.11g, was ratiﬁed in 2003, and is backward-com-
patible with 802.11b and 802.11 DSSS equipment. For these reasons,
802.11b enjoys the most popular use, though 802.11g has caught up
quickly. Next up, 802.11n. If you want to learn more about the standards,
www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Jean_Tourrilhes/Linux/Linux.Wireless.std.ht
ml has some detailed information on how they came about.You can also
read through the IEEE standards; they’re located at
http://standards.ieee.org/wireless.Another good resource is
http://www.netstumbler.com.
Types of Threats
There are three primary categories of threats we’ll discuss in this chapter:
War dialing, war driving, and Bluetooth attacks. In a moment, we’ll look
at each one in detail.The majority of this chapter will be devoted to “tra-
ditional” wireless security—meaning the wireless networks created by
wireless network interface cards and wireless access points connected to a
wired network.This is where the bulk of the risk comes from in any
company and therefore it should be the place where most attention is
placed (from a wireless security perspective). However, there are several
other types of attacks that fall within the “wireless” realm that should be
understood and assessed in your network. Most of these “alternate” con-
nection types can be quickly and easily located and secured, but the point
is that you must be thorough in your wireless assessment so you don’t
overlook these easily secured openings. We’ll begin by looking at attack
methods from oldest to newest. War dialing started back in the days when
remote computers communicated with one another only via modems
over the public telephone systems. Wardriving is the updated version of
that and uses wireless technologies rather than phone lines. Bluetooth, a
short-wave radio signal communication method, also has its perils.
www.syngress.com
Wireless Security Project Plan • Chapter 12
449

War Dialing, Demon 
Dialing, Carrier Signal Scanning
Although war dialing (a.k.a. demon dialing or carrier signal scanning) is
not technically a wireless technology, it belongs in this arena due to the
nature of the attack. War dialing, for those of you not familiar with this
attack type, is when hackers dial phone numbers looking for misconﬁg-
ured or unsecured modems. Remember modems? Many desktop com-
puters and even many servers have modems sitting in them, even if they
are unused and getting dusty in a virtual sense. War dialing can yield
unexpectedly large rewards for hackers since modems are often forgotten
elements and are therefore overlooked as part of a risk assessment or
security monitoring project.
In a standard network conﬁguration, all incoming trafﬁc is routed
through an external ﬁrewall and/or a perimeter network along with an
internal ﬁrewall. However, with a modem in the mix, a hacker can essen-
tially bypass all those layers of protection and go directly into the com-
puter or server with the modem installed.The modem in and of itself is
not a problem but because it may not be secured, it may create a security
hole that you’re not even looking for.You should take an inventory of all
computers in your network to determine if they have modems and if
they have phone lines connected to them.A modem by itself can’t be uti-
lized unless it’s connected to a phone line, and some companies’ phone
systems don’t connect well with standard RJ-11 jack types, so this may
not be an issue for you. However, it never hurts to look. For example, if
your company used to use modems, are you sure you’re no longer paying
for those modem lines from the phone company? Many corporate phone
bills go directly to ﬁnance, not to the IT department, so it’s entirely pos-
sible you have active phone lines that users might still be connected to
(or that they could connect to). For example, if a corporate computer is
conﬁgured with Symantec’s pcAnywhere without username and password
required, it’s a wide open door for anyone looking to circumvent net-
work ﬁrewalls and security measures, as shown in Figure 12.1.A hacker
can easily bypass all the well-designed security systems and get right in an

open backdoor without any security measures at all. It doesn’t take any
very sophisticated tools or techniques to do this.
Keep in mind that if your company is still running legacy systems or
components, many require the use of modems for maintenance and sup-
port activities. If these systems are connected to the network, they are
part of your security environment. One of the best ways to secure these
types of systems is to enable the dial-back feature so that an incoming call
is disconnected and the call is returned to a speciﬁed phone number.

unsecured modems in the San Francisco area. Although the method they
used was dialing blocks of numbers within area codes, an easier way is
to dial blocks of numbers associated with a business’s main phone
number. If your company’s phone number is 555-1000, a war dialer
would dial every number between 555-1000 and 555-9999 looking for
a modem. Of the 5.7 million numbers Shipley and Garﬁnkel called,
49,192 modems respond. What they found was that many of these
modems were connected not just to open dial-up lines, but directly to
application servers. Even though that was ﬁve years ago, the emphasis
on high-speed Internet connections via cable modems, broadband, and
T1 lines has left little attention focused on these “legacy” devices. A well-
publicized event cited by these authors was a teenager who stumbled
upon a dial-up line and was never asked for a username or password.
With open access, he was presented with various commands he could
use, so he began experimenting. According to the article, the result was
that the teen managed to shut down power to a regional airport and
600 nearby houses. Even though the teen was really just monkeying
around, his rather innocent exploration had a major impact. The
lesson—don’t overlook modems as part of your security patrol. For the
full story, check out the full article by Peter Shipley and Simpson
Garﬁnkel at the link provided; it’s a fascinating read and will open your
eyes to a lot of security issues, not just war dialing techniques.
Wardriving, NetStumbling, or Stumbling
Wardriving is a term many IT people are familiar with—the term is a take
off on the original term war dialing (based on a 1980s movie starring
Mathew Broderick called War Games) and involves actually driving
around in a car with a good antenna looking for unsecured wireless net-
works. Before we jump to any rash conclusions, however, let’s hear what
security experts have to say about war driving.This is an excerpt from
WarDriving: Drive, Detect, Defend:A Guide To Wireless Security (Chris
Hurley, Frank Thornton, Michael Puchol, and Russ Rogers, Syngress
Publishing, Inc. 2004).
These days, you might hear people confuse the terminology
WarDriver and hacker. As you probably know, the term
hacker was originally used to describe a person that was
www.syngress.com
452
Chapter 12 • Wireless Security Project Plan

able to modify a computer (often in a way unintended by its
manufacturer) to suit his or her own purposes. However,
over time, owing to the confusion of the masses and consis-
tent media abuse, the term hacker is now commonly used
to describe a criminal; someone that accesses a computer or
network without the authorization of the owner. (If you
choose to hack or modify your own computer, you’re not
engaging in a criminal activity.) The same situation can be
applied to the term WarDriver. WarDriver has been misused
to describe someone that accesses wireless networks
without authorization from the owner. An individual that
accesses a computer system, wired or wireless, without
authorization is a criminal. Criminality has nothing to do
with either hacking or WarDriving.
The news media, in an effort to generate ratings and
increase viewership, has sensationalized WarDriving. Almost
every local television news outlet has done a story on “wire-
less hackers armed with laptops” or “drive-by hackers” that
are reading your e-mail or using your wireless network to
surf the Web. These stories are geared to propagate Fear,
Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD). FUD stories usually take a
small risk, and attempt to elevate the seriousness of the sit-
uation in the minds of their audience. Stories that prey on
fear are good for ratings, but don’t always depict an activity
accurately.
An unfortunate side effect of these stories has been that the
reporters invariably ask the “WarDriver” to gather informa-
tion that is being transmitted across a wireless network so
that the “victim” can be shown their personal information
that was collected. Again, this has nothing to do with
WarDriving and while a case can be made that this activity
(known as snifﬁng) in and of itself is not illegal, it is at a
minimum unethical and is not a practice that WarDrivers
engage in. 
www.syngress.com
Wireless Security Project Plan • Chapter 12
453

These stories also tend to focus on gimmicky aspects of
WarDriving such as the directional antenna that can be
made using a Pringles can. While a functional antenna can
be made from Pringles cans, coffee cans, soup cans, or
pretty much anything cylindrical and hollow, the reality is
that very few (if any) WarDrivers actually use these for
WarDriving. Many of them have made these antennas in an
attempt to both verify the original concept and improve
upon it in some instances.
The reality of WarDriving is simple. Computer security pro-
fessionals, hobbyists, and others are generally interested in
providing information to the public about security vulnera-
bilities that are present with “out of the box” conﬁgurations
of wireless access points. Wireless access points that can be
purchased at a local electronics or computer store are not
geared toward security. They are designed so that a person
with little or no understanding of networking can purchase
a wireless access point, and with little or no outside help,
set it up and begin using it. Computers have become a
staple of everyday life. Technology that makes using com-
puters easier and more fun needs to be available to
everyone. Companies such as Linksys and D-Link have been
very successful at making these new technologies easy for
end users to set up and begin using. To do otherwise would
alienate a large part of their target market. 
The Legality of WarDriving
According to the FBI, it is not illegal to scan access points,
but once a theft of service, denial of service, or theft of
information occurs, then it becomes a federal violation
through 18USC 1030 (www.usdoj.gov/criminal/cyber-
crime/1030_new.html). While this is good, general informa-
tion, any questions about the legality of a speciﬁc act in the
United States should be posed directly to either the local FBI
ﬁeld ofﬁce, a cyber crime attorney, or the U.S. Attorney’s
ofﬁce. This information only applies to the United States.
www.syngress.com
454
Chapter 12 • Wireless Security Project Plan

WarDrivers are encouraged to investigate the local laws
where they live to ensure that they aren’t inadvertently vio-
lating the law. Understanding the distinction between
“scanning” or identifying wireless access points and actually
using the access point is the difference between WarDriving,
a legal activity, and theft, an obviously illegal activity.
One of the more commonly used tools for wireless network detection
is NetStumbler, which was created by Marius Milner and released in May
of 2001.There is a PocketPC version of this program called MiniStumbler.
As a result of the ease-of-use of this program and the proliferation of its
use, many now refer to the activity of wireless network detection not as
wardriving but as netstumbling, or simply stumbling. Since it is often an
activity done with no malice whatsoever, stumbling certainly is more rep-
resentative of what most people do with these programs.
Clearly, the downside to the proliferation of easy-to-use wireless com-
ponents is that they come with no security conﬁgured right out of the
box. More recent releases of the Microsoft operating system come locked
down, by default, but earlier versions had been set to “open” by default
and the system administrator had to lock down anything he or she didn’t
want open, on, installed, or available. Now, the operating system takes just
the opposite approach—things are locked down, disabled, and not installed
by default, and the system administrator has to make a conscious effort to
open things up.This approach is much better for network and server secu-
rity but certainly doesn’t encourage ﬁrst-time users to give it a whirl.The
balance between encouraging users and providing security is a delicate
one, and most user-grade component companies like Linksys and D-Link
are focused on the home user.As such, their equipment comes ready to
install and use out of the box. Does that mean your home wireless net-
work is at risk? Absolutely. Does it mean someone is going to come and
steal your personal data? Who knows? If you live in a rural area, the likeli-
hood of someone getting close enough for long enough to steal data is
unlikely but certainly possible. If you live in an urban area, the risk obvi-
ously climbs because your neighbor in the downstairs apartment might be
sitting there watching all your unsecured network trafﬁc go by. However,
www.syngress.com
Wireless Security Project Plan • Chapter 12

to go back to the comments made by the WarDriving experts, the real
issue is that WarDriving itself is not an illegal activity and someone who
uses your open wireless network may be unethically using your network,
but if he or she does nothing harmful, it’s a bit like running an extension
cord to your neighbor’s house to run your television set—it is stealing but
it does not damage your television in any way.We’re not here to support
stealing unsecured wireless access, but to help you understand that not
everyone who engages in wardriving has ill intentions.
If you perform a Web search for images using the search phrase “war
driving maps,” you’ll ﬁnd thousands of access point maps out on the
Internet. Some sites keep up-to-date maps in a database, other sites are
abandoned or outdated, but the overall impression you should get is that
there are thousands of people looking for unsecured access points
everyday for all kinds of reasons, and if you think your corporate wireless
network or your wireless users are safe, think again. Figure 12.2 shows a
sample map of the Los Angeles area.

You can see that wireless networks are clustered, and anyone looking
for wireless access could take a nice slow drive down Wilshire Blvd. or
ﬁnd a comfy coffee shop and take a look at tons of unsecured network
trafﬁc.The point is not to feed into the fear factor but to help you
understand the reality of wardriving and the need to secure your corpo-
rate network and wireless users’ wireless devices so that your network
assets remain secure against the bad guys and the good guys who might
accidentally stumble in.
Business Intelligence…
Wardriving for Fun and Proﬁt
If you pay attention to what’s happening in the outside world, you’ll
notice there’s been a proliferation of information about wardriving in
the past few years. At ﬁrst, it was a subversive, secret underground
world (or so it seemed), but these days there are many people who view
wardriving as cheap entertainment—well not so cheap with the price of
gas these days, but still very affordable. The tools and techniques are
readily available for anyone seeking them. A laptop with a wireless card,
a small fairly inexpensive antenna, and a tank of gas will get you started.
If you’re really strapped, you could do this on foot (some do in urban
areas) with a well-equipped PDA (see Figure 12.3). Wardriving itself is
not illegal when it’s done simply to ﬁnd and map secured and unsecured
wireless access points (fun). Wardriving that leads to using someone
else’s unprotected network or network intrusion (proﬁt) is illegal.
Stumbling = ok, intrusion = not ok. It’s a simple rule to follow for most.
There are thousands of Web sites that discuss wardriving and
wardriving adventures. One that comes up in a search engine search is
http://www.unwiredadventures.com, though there are many out there.
On this particular site, the wardriver talks about his adventures in
wardriving while vacationing with his family. This is a leisure activity he
engages in to map wireless access points in various locations. Think of it
as local geography with a twist. This excerpt from his Web site indicates
his intention (from 2001): “Our trip was fun for all of us. Lots of good
food and fun with our relatives. The kids were well behaved in the car

and my wife was understanding about the extra equipment in the car.
802.11b wireless equipment is very easy to install and has become very
inexpensive. It’s everywhere now, in homes and businesses. Wireless
network technology has made the use of computer systems so very
easy and convenient. Let’s be sure to understand the equipment that
we plug into our networks. Read the manuals, or hire an experienced
security consultant to make sure that you are secure in your use of this
technology.” He mentioned that he has TCP/IP disabled on the computer
he uses for wardriving so that he cannot inadvertently gain unautho-
rized access to corporate networks, though he admits that “Otherwise,
it would have been easy to get free Internet access behind many corpo-
rate ﬁrewalls. Nearly all of the 802.11b wireless equipment that I have
evaluated is factory conﬁgured with the lowest possible security set-
tings. No access control and no encryption. It’s up to the user to secure
the equipment that is plugged into their network.”
http://www.unwiredadventures.com/unwire/2005/12/vacation_war
_dr.html.
A word to the wise: If you decide to give wardriving a try to hone
your own skills, be sure to disable the TCP/IP stack on your wardriving
device before you head out. This will prevent accidental intrusion to an
unsecured network and keep you on the right side of the law.

Some critics get upset by the proliferation of information available on
how to set up equipment for wardriving.This is true for just about every
computer activity that can be used for good or evil. E-mail communication
is not a bad thing, phishing is.They both use the same tool (e-mail) for dif-
ferent purposes.The same is true of wardriving.The activity can be done
innocently for fun or to hone technical skills, or it can be done to gather
information in advance of an attack. Many in the security world are frus-
trated by the easy access people have to sniff, attack, and hack, but most also
grudgingly agree that the more information that’s out there, the more tools
one has to understand and prevent unauthorized access. It’s a never-ending
cycle and you and your IT project team need to be on top of the latest
tools, techniques, and tips that hackers have available so that you can secure
your network—wired and wireless—from unauthorized access and harmful
activities.We’ll discuss the tools of the trade later in this chapter when we
look at risk assessment for your wireless security project.
Bluetooth Attacks
As you probably know, Bluetooth uses a short-range radio signal to pro-
vide wireless communications, typically between various personal com-
munication devices such as cell phones and headsets or PDAs. Bluetooth
allows you to create a wireless personal area network (WPAN) that can
communicate with other Bluetooth devices within a small physical
radius (about 10 meters). Bluetooth relies on the use of radio waves and
overcomes earlier infrared (IR) technologies that were used for personal
communication devices. IR required line-of-sight for communicating
with another device and it was a one-to-one connection. Bluetooth
overcomes these limitations because it does not require line-of-sight and
it allows many devices to communicate simultaneously. Bluetooth limits
interference with other radio signals and other Bluetooth devices by lim-
iting its broadcast range to 10 meters and by using a random frequency
hopping algorithm. If interference does occur, it would be extremely
short-lived since frequency hopping involves changing frequency several
times per second.
www.syngress.com
Wireless Security Project Plan • Chapter 12
459

Let’s take a short side-trip to understand how Bluetooth devices com-
municate with one another so you can better understand the threat.
Bluetooth devices “pair up” by exchanging a passkey (depending on the
type and level of authentication selected). Once this occurs, the devices
have essentially created a personal area network (PAN) in which one of
the devices assumes the lead role (“master”).A single device can partici-
pate in multiple PANs, creating a scatternet, as shown in Figure 12.4.
PAN1 and PAN2 form the scatternet and by design, the hand-held com-
puter could be communicating, via the cell phone with the laptop com-
puter. Since radio signals move through walls, the scatternet can be
formed much like a standard wireless network. Some Bluetooth users
mistakenly believe that their devices are safe but if you have Bluetooth
enabled and you’re not actively using it, it’s possible your device is part of
a scatternet without even knowing it.

Business Intelligence…
The Art of Bluejacking and Bluesnarﬁng
Bluejacking ﬁrst showed up in popular use in 2003 or so when Bluetooth
devices gained popularity. Bluejacking is more of a prank than an attack,
and an annoying one at that. The term apparently was coined in late
2002 by a fellow going by the moniker ajack. Although there are some
rather amusing stories about bluejacking, to date there are no stories of
unmitigated corporate network attacks having their genesis in a blue-
jacking. A story in 2003 by the Associated Press is a great example of
how bluejacking typically works.
“The group of lanky tourists strolling through Stockholm’s old town
never knew what hit them. As they admired Swedish handicrafts in a
storefront window, one of their cell phones chirped with an anonymous
note: “Try the blue sweaters. They keep you warm in the winter.” The
tourist was “bluejacked” — surreptitiously surprised with a text mes-
sage sent using a short-range wireless technology called Bluetooth. As
more people get Bluetooth-enabled cell phones — both sender and
recipient need them for this to work — there is bound to be more mis-
chievous messaging of the unsuspecting. It’s a growing fad, this fun
with wireless. Already, Web sites are offering tips on bluejacking, and
collections of startled reactions are popping up on the Internet.”
—Matt Moore, “Cell phone messaging takes a mischievous turn,” The
Associated Press, November 13, 2003 (from http://www.wordspy.com/
words/bluejacking.asp).
Bluesnarﬁng, on the other hand, is an illegal activity that involves
stealing data from a Bluetooth-enabled device. Typically, this involves
stealing contacts or calendar entries. The calendar entries might be
embarrassing (“Cosmetic surgery, 4 pm”) but rarely damaging unless the
calendar entry also has conﬁdential information in it (“Meet Doug M. at
2 am in southwest corner of parking lot to hand off illegally gotten trade
secrets”). More importantly, most of us don’t want our contacts just
handed over to a complete stranger. If you’re like most people, you have
a mixture of personal contacts (Mom, Dentist, Local Pizza Place) and
business contacts (Boss: Home, Boss: Work, Boss: Cell, Boss: Husband,
Boss: VacationHome, CEO of Company A, CIO of Company B). It would
www.syngress.com
Wireless Security Project Plan • Chapter 12
461
Continued

be pretty creepy (and potentially dangerous) to have your mother get
phone calls at 2 am from someone telling her that he knows her home
phone number, address, zip code, and alarm code.
Stealing calendar and contact information via bluesnarﬁng requires
both Bluetooth devices be on and available. The quickest and easiest
way to avoid bluesnarﬁng (which requires about two to three minutes
of continuous connection time) is to disable Bluetooth when not specif-
ically in use. If you’re using a cell phone with a Bluetooth headset, you
can disable Discovery mode (sometimes called Visible mode), which
makes it difﬁcult for someone to ﬁnd your Bluetooth-enabled device.
There’s an excellent article you can read from 2004 that contains in-
depth information about various Bluetooth attacks and the devices that
were (at that time) vulnerable to such attacks. Head to this URL for more
information: http://www.thebunker.net/security/bluetooth.htm.
One might argue that the threats to Bluetooth devices are greatly
exaggerated by the media.At the same time, if you’re sitting in a crowded
airport awaiting your ﬂight, there’s always a chance someone could grab
your contacts and have a ﬁeld day with them. Suppose you were fortu-
nate enough to get the home phone number (or the private line at the
remote cabin) for the CIO of your company, a Fortune 500, publicly
traded company. Do you really want someone getting that number, calling
the CIO in the middle of the night saying that the Director of IT
Security (you) gave the caller his number? Talk about a CTM (Career
Terminating Move).The point is that conﬁdential information is routinely
stored on Bluetooth devices from PDAs to cell phones and data is at risk,
regardless of how great or small you perceive that risk to be.This is an
excellent example of a case where evaluating risk and remediation is
pretty simple.You’ll most likely create a user policy guideline (see the
chapter on security policy later in this book) that requires users to set
their Bluetooth devices so they are not in Discovery or Visible mode
except when purposely participating in a Bluetooth network in a rela-
tively safe location (at a business meeting, for example). Most (if not all)
newer Bluetooth devices are updated to protect against attack but
attackers are often smart, persistent folks and they’ll no doubt ﬁnd the

next open door to go through. Staying up to date on attack types is a
never-ending task, so make sure there are people on your IT staff that are
speciﬁcally tasked with doing so and keeping the rest of the team
informed. Dividing this work into topic areas is a good way to keep
everyone on the prowl for the latest data, and can be a great way to
improve the skills of everyone on your team.
Risk Assessment
We know there is a trade-off between total security and total risk.There
are ﬁnancial and operational trade-offs that every organization must
make. In the risk assessment phase of your audit, you need to look at your
risks in terms of CIA: conﬁdentiality, integrity, and availability. Data that is
accessed wirelessly is most at risk of loss of conﬁdentiality because it’s rel-
atively easy for a hacker to jump into the middle of an unsecured wireless
stream and grab any data desired. However, he or she could also modify
data (integrity) or simply make that data, network, or service unavailable,
if desired.
Other key components of the wireless risk assessment are the people,
process, and technology components. We’ll talk about creating security poli-
cies for the organization in Chapter 13, which are used to help dictate
and guide people’s behaviors. People are almost always the weakest link in
the security chain and your risk assessment should look at the risks
people’s behaviors (intentional and unintentional) have on security in the
wireless realm. Processes must be assessed for risk as well. How do wireless
users connect on-site? How do wireless users connect off-site? How
should guest accounts be handled for wireless connections? There are a
variety of process issues that should be assessed from end-to-end. Finally,
the technology assessment should include an assessment of various wireless
technologies in use along with the strengths and weaknesses of each.You
also need to understand the technology available to the hackers and
determine how to secure your wireless connections in light of hacker
capabilities. Let’s look at an example. It is possible to crack WEP encryp-
tion if a hacker has enough time, a powerful enough computer, and
www.syngress.com
Wireless Security Project Plan • Chapter 12
463

enough data to do so.Therefore, WEP is usually sufﬁcient for home wire-
less networks because a hacker rarely will be able to gather enough data
in a short enough time frame to crack WEP on a home network and
because there usually isn’t a big enough pot of gold at the other end to
entice a hacker to work that hard to break WEP on a home network
(except in cases where there is targeted malicious intent or utter
boredom). Contrast that to a corporate network where ﬁnancial data
including customer credit cards or bank account numbers or whatever are
stored. Now there’s a big enough payoff to make the time and effort
worthwhile. So, you have to choose your battles and understand the rela-
tive attack footprint of your organization to understand where and how
to secure your assets.That said, wireless is just a ridiculously easy target
and you should take stronger precautions here than you might have oth-
erwise considered necessary.
Remember, too, that there is no magic bullet. Wireless networking
cannot be secured with 100 percent conﬁdence. Security is often a matter
of applying layers of protection to create a maze of problems most
attackers will walk away from.A smart determined attacker with the right
tools and enough time can probably crack anything, including the once-
sacred WPA security. However, if you use MAC address ﬁltering, you
suppress SSID broadcasting, you use WEP or WPA and you educate your
users, you’ve done all you can do.The rest is a matter of intelligently
installing, conﬁguring, maintaining, and monitoring an intrusion detec-
tion system and performing regular scans to make sure no ad hoc net-
works pop up.
Although we talked about risk assessment in Chapter 10, it’s worth
walking through a few of the risks inherent in a wireless network envi-
ronment.There is some overlap but we will keep an eye focused speciﬁ-
cally on wireless risks.
Asset Protection
As we have continually stressed, you have to ﬁnd the right balance
between protecting corporate assets and the cost of doing so. In any net-
work assessment scenario, you should begin by understanding what you’re
www.syngress.com
464
Chapter 12 • Wireless Security Project Plan

trying to protect and why.You may have addressed this issue adequately
during your overall IT corporate security planning process. If so, you
should review the data, assumptions, and outcomes at this stage to ensure
your conclusions are still relevant and correct.Things change so quickly
in most corporate environments that a quick review of previous assess-
ment data is almost always a good use of your time.You should review
what data is on your corporate network and what needs to be protected.
This is also a good time to ﬁnd out what is on your corporate network
that perhaps should not be. If you recall the case studies from Chapter 1,
it’s not uncommon for corporate networks to have data on it that should
not be there, such as credit card numbers or social security numbers that
were stored inappropriately and in violation of corporate policy or
vendor policy (as was the case with the credit card processing company,
which violated its own policies and that of the credit card companies for
whom they processed data).
In addition to discovering what is on your network (and what’s there
but shouldn’t be), you also need to assess the relative value of that data.
Though it can be argued that all corporate data is valuable, some data is
clearly more valuable than other types of data. Remember that you need
to think like a hacker to make these assessments. If all you have are lists of
nuts, bolts, and cable lengths, there’s not as much value to that data as
there is with personal data such as credit card numbers, social security
numbers, or bank access codes. Correlate the data on your network with
the perceived value of the data to an outsider to understand the relative
risk to your network.This will help you determine just how much secu-
rity is appropriate for your speciﬁc situation.
A good example of this is a home wireless network. Most people
using home wireless networks do not secure them even though they may
log onto their online brokerage account or do some online shopping
using a credit card.This data is transmitted in an unsecured manner from
their laptop or wireless device to their wireless access point, then to the
router or cable modem and then out to the Internet. Even if the Web site
they are using is secured using SSL or HTTPS (for example), the link
between the user’s wireless device and the wireless access point may not
www.syngress.com
Wireless Security Project Plan • Chapter 12
465

be secured.This is the weak link in this transaction.The same holds true
of a corporate user at a coffee shop, hotel, or airport waiting area.
The question is this: how likely is it that a hacker is going to grab that
data? Well, if you are in a dense setting where a hacker can sit in a nearby
location and peruse wireless data like yours, then the potential is extremely
high but the likelihood is somewhere in the mid-range on the risk scale. If
you live in a more suburban or rural setting or are in a remote location of
any kind where it would be difﬁcult for someone to get close enough to
receive your wireless signal, the risk drops signiﬁcantly.The potential drops
to low and the likelihood drops to near zero. Looking at the risk/reward
proposition from a hacker’s perspective will help you assess the relative
value of your assets and what level of protection is warranted.
Sensitive Data
Sensitive data is deﬁned differently from one company to the next. What’s
sensitive at one company may not be particularly sensitive at another.
However, in most companies, there are clearly segments of data that are
sensitive and your security audit should identify those areas.As part of
your wireless security project deﬁnition stage, you need to clearly under-
stand what data can be accessed via the wireless network (typically the
connection in a corporate setting is to the wired network) and how sen-
sitive that data is. It goes beyond the legal implications and into the busi-
ness aspects. Lists of customers, vendors, suppliers, or employees can be
sensitive, especially if you’re in a medical setting, for example.Trade
secrets, formulas, and research and development (R&D) data can be
extremely sensitive, especially in industries that are working in leading
edge or ground-breaking areas.This is a great place to get feedback and
input from various departments in your company.Ask them what data
they work with that they would not want posted on a Web site or
printed in a newspaper.That usually gets people’s attention and helps
them begin to look at the data they work with on a daily basis from a
slightly different perspective.
Sensitive data can be stored in a variety of locations, most notably
(and insecurely) on laptops that leave the building. Employees could

intentionally boost sensitive data and if they are legitimate users of that
information, it would be hard to know if they’re doing something wrong.
However, you also need to look at the possibility that users will transmit
sensitive data via wireless laptop connections or that these laptops them-
selves might be stolen. In the chapter on operational security, we’ll talk
about physical laptop security, but for now, let’s focus on laptops con-
taining sensitive data that users transmit across unsecured wireless connec-
tions. Here’s a quick list of data typically considered sensitive:
■
Customer databases
■
Employee lists
■
Identity information (can include customer, employee, vendor)
■
Credit card or other ﬁnancial data
■
Health information
■
Intellectual property
■
Trade secrets
■
Research and development
Network Assets
In addition to data assets that hackers might target, there is another type
of data that is often sought out by hackers and that is network data. If a
hacker can get into the network using an unsecured wireless access point
(or by any unsecured means, really), he or she will try to enumerate the
network assets to ﬁnd out where servers, databases, and sensitive informa-
tion are located.Therefore, understanding the network conﬁguration is
often not the end-game but the intermediate step toward the ﬁnal target.
If you can prevent a hacker from gaining access to this network conﬁgu-
ration data, you may prevent an intrusion. Network data that is helpful to
a hacker includes (but certainly is not limited to):
■
Usernames and passwords
■
Directory listings

■
Network ﬁrewalls, routers, switches, and hubs
■
Network segmentation, including DMZs
■
IP addresses for servers
■
Ports and protocols in use
Business Intelligence…
The Cost of Identity Theft
The growing focus on IT security in all realms is because there is a
growing problem with data theft—both corporate and personal.
Companies must secure personal information but consumers must also
do their part. There are 10 million identity theft victims in the United
States each year. The average ID theft victim spends over 175 hours
trying to ﬁx the damage done and at a cost of over $1500 per incident.
The total annual cost in the United States attributed to identity theft
tops $15 billion. There are four basic types of identity theft:
■Financial ID Theft—This type of case typically focuses on
your name and Social Security number (SSN). This person
may apply for telephone service, credit cards or loans, buy
merchandise, lease cars or apartments. 
■Criminal ID Theft—The imposter in this crime provides the
victim’s information instead of his or her own when stopped
by law enforcement. Eventually when the warrant for arrest is
issued it is in the name of the person issued the citation—
yours.
■Identity Cloning—In this crime, the imposter uses the
victim’s information to establish a new life. They work and
live as you. Examples: Illegal aliens, criminals avoiding war-
rants, people hiding from abusive situations, or becoming a
“new person” to leave behind a poor work and ﬁnancial his-
tory.
■Business or Commercial Identity Theft—Businesses are also
victims of identity theft. Typically the perpetrator gets credit

cards or checking accounts in the name of the business. The
business ﬁnds out when unhappy suppliers send collection
notices or their business rating score is affected.
Tips for businesses from the ID Theft Center include:
■Information acquisition—Do you need the information? Are
you acquiring it in a safe manner? 
■Storage—What computer security measures have you placed
around the systems storing personal data? It should be con-
sidered highly classiﬁed and not common access. 
■Access—Who has access? Is it on a need to know basis and
access audited? Is there password control over systems? Is
there a cafeteria worker asking your child for his/her SSN
prior to receiving lunch? Did you do a background check on
those who have access to personal information of employees
and customers? Do temps have access to secure info? 
■Disposal—Are electronic and paper documents containing
personal information rendered unreadable prior to disposal?
What is in your dumpster? Is it a treasure chest for thieves
and for consumer action attorneys ready to sue you for
placing their clients in jeopardy? 
■Distribution—How do you handle information? Is your
employee requiring a member of the public to repeat a SSN
out loud where it can be overheard? The public display, use,
and exchange of SSN (including on membership cards carried
in wallets) needs to be reconsidered. You place people at
much higher risk when you do so.
Understanding identity theft is an important aspect of securing
your network and it certainly can help you secure your own personal
identity as well.

Threat Prevention
Threat prevention starts, in many respects, with the IT security project
problem statement. What problem are we trying to solve with this pro-
ject? In other words, what threats do we perceive that we need to
address? What is the company trying to protect through these security
www.syngress.com
Wireless Security Project Plan • Chapter 12
469

measures? What kinds of threats are likely or possible? Are you most con-
cerned about an attack, a theft, or a breach, and which is most likely to
occur? Answering these questions will help you deﬁne your problem and
your outcome statements and help form a solid foundation for your wire-
less security project plan. In this section, we’re going to outline the cur-
rent threats to wireless networks. Some of this might overlap with other
kinds of threats, but it’s included here so that you have a fairly compre-
hensive list in front of you. Clearly, you’ll need to do additional research
when you sit down to deﬁne your wireless security plan because threats
change and morph on a regular basis.
In order to understand how to protect your network, you need to
understand what you’re protecting against.This segment provides detailed
information on threats to wireless networks. It should be used in the
planning of your wireless security plan, though be clear that this same
information can be used to attack your wireless network. It can be used
for a friendly penetration test to ﬁnd weak spots but it can also be used
for an unfriendly penetration event to cause harm to your network or
company. Most network tools can be used for both good and evil, so
don’t shoot the messenger.
War Dialing Prevention
War dialing typically occurs during off-hours to prevent phones ringing
all over the ofﬁce, though computers with modems may be turned off
after hours, causing you to miss some devices.You may choose, as part of
threat prevention, to notify users that if they hear phones ringing, espe-
cially after hours, and they are answered with screeching modem tones,
that they should report it to the IT security ofﬁcer.Also, your threat pre-
vention in this case ﬁrst should be to identify all live modems and phone
lines.A scan of your company’s phone bill may show existing dial-up
lines that everyone had forgotten about (which the phone company just
loves). Second, you can war dial your own company (during off-hours to
avoid disruption) to see if you ﬁnd any open modems. If you do so after
hours, you risk the chance that users have turned computers off and that
existing modems will not answer. If you suspect rogue modems may be a
www.syngress.com
470
Chapter 12 • Wireless Security Project Plan

problem, you’ll need to do your war dialing during working hours.
Clearly, an e-mail blast letting people know that you’re scanning for
modems would be counterproductive since the point of the exercise is to
ﬁnd modems. If a user with a rogue modem is given a heads up, there’s a
strong chance you’ll never ﬁnd the modem without going desk by desk
and inspecting computers.You can do an inventory of your corporate
ownership of Symantec’s pcAnywhere and look for existing versions.You
can also check system inventory lists and look at all computers that have
modems installed. If the modem is not in use and can be removed (as
opposed to those that are embedded in the computer’s mother board), it
should be removed. If it is embedded in the mother board, it should be
disabled, if possible.
Once you’ve gone through and discovered any modems not in use,
you next need to check those that are still in use. First ﬁnd out if they
can be disabled. If they are still needed, ensure they require the use of
usernames and strong passwords (you’d be shocked how many dial up
connections require no username or password) and use the callback fea-
ture, if available. Next, look at what software is being used on those dial-
up systems and ensure that the latest patches and updates are applied. If
the application is deemed to be inherently insecure, look for a newer,
better application that could be used instead or a way to divert this dial-
up trafﬁc to another connection method. Finally, look at the system and
application conﬁguration to ensure it is conﬁgured to be as secure as pos-
sible. Eliminate unused accounts, disable default or guest accounts, require
strong passwords, and so on.
Direct Access
According to statistics from the third World Wide WarDrive, approxi-
mately one of every four access points currently deployed is in a default
conﬁguration.The default conﬁguration means that there is no encryp-
tion enabled and the Service Set Identiﬁer (SSID) has not been changed
from the factory settings.The “direct
approach” can be used to gain access to wireless networks in the default
conﬁguration.The direct approach, in a nutshell, refers to “requesting” a
www.syngress.com
Wireless Security Project Plan • Chapter 12
471

connection to the access point.This is an extremely simple process in
both Windows and Linux. In order to access a wireless network with a
default conﬁguration from a
Windows machine, all that you need is a wireless client manager.The
wireless client manager is the conﬁguration software that either ships
with the wireless card, or is built into the operating system (as is the case
with Windows XP). It scans for wireless networks, ﬁnds one, and,
depending on conﬁguration settings on the client, connects automatically.
Defeating MAC Address Filtering
One security measure that many wireless network administrators put in
place is ﬁltering by MAC address. Enabling MAC address ﬁltering allows
only network cards with certain MAC addresses to connect to your net-
work. However, as with any security measure, a determined, knowledge-
able attacker usually can ﬁnd a way around such an obstacle.
Most commercial- and consumer-grade wireless networking equip-
ment sends the MAC address clear text even if Wired Equivalency
Protection (WEP) is enabled.This means that if you passively sniff the
trafﬁc on a wireless network using a freeware tool such as Ethereal
(www.ethereal.com), you can determine one or more MAC addresses
that are allowed to connect to the network. If MAC address ﬁltering is
the only security measure in place, you just need to change your MAC
address to one that is allowed access.This is a relatively easy thing to do
in both the Windows and Linux environments. In Windows, it’s a matter
of editing a registry key manually or using an automated tool. In Linux,
it’s a matter of changing the MAC address in the interface.This also can
be done manually using the ifconﬁg command or using an automated tool.
Finding Cloaked Access Points
Many wireless network administrators “cloak” their access points by
putting them in “stealth” mode.This is accomplished by disabling the
SSID broadcast.Active scanners, like NetStumbler, do not detect cloaked
access points.These access points can be found using passive scanners like
Kismet or AirSnort. Keep in mind that while you may have cloaked your
www.syngress.com
472
Chapter 12 • Wireless Security Project Plan

access points, an intruder could have installed an access point on your
network and cloaked it.Therefore, you need to use these same tools to
ﬁnd cloaked access points that may be attached to your network. One of
the biggest beneﬁts that passive scanners like Kismet have to offer is the
ability to detect access points that are not broadcasting their SSID.
Discovering cloaked access points with Kismet is accomplished by placing
your wireless card in monitor mode. Older versions of Kismet required
that Kismet be placed in monitor mode manually using the kismet_monitor
command. When Kismet discovers a cloaked access point, it will initially
list it as having no SSID.As Kismet collects more packets, it will be able
to determine the SSID.
AirSnort is a passive wireless scanner developed by the Shmoo Group
(http://airsnort.shmoo.com). Like Kismet,AirSnort will automatically
activate your card in monitor mode when it is started.Any cloaked access
points that AirSnort initially ﬁnds will project a blank SSID, but after
enough packets are collected,AirSnort is able to determine the SSID of
the cloaked network. Unlike Kismet,AirSnort has additional functionality
that is also extremely valuable to an attacker. We’ll discuss AirSnort in
more detail later when we look at how one attacks WEP.
Man-in-the-Middle Attacks
Placing a rogue AP (an unauthorized access point placed on a network by
an individual) within range of wireless stations is a wireless-speciﬁc varia-
tion of a man-in-the-middle attack. If the attacker knows the SSID the net-
work uses (which, as we have seen, is easily discoverable) and the rogue
AP has enough strength, wireless users have no way of knowing that they
are connecting to an unauthorized AP.
Using a rogue AP, an attacker can gain valuable information about the
wireless network, such as authentication requests, the secret key that is in
use, and so on. Often, the attacker will set up a laptop with two wireless
adapters, in which the rogue AP uses one card and the other is used to
forward requests through a wireless bridge to the legitimate AP. With a
sufﬁciently strong antenna, the rogue AP does not have to be located in
close proximity to the legitimate AP. For example, the attacker can run
www.syngress.com
Wireless Security Project Plan • Chapter 12
473

the rogue AP from a car or van parked some distance away from the
building containing the network. However, it is also common to set up
hidden rogue APs (under desks, in closets, and so on) close to, and within,
the same physical area as the legitimate AP. Due to their virtually unde-
tectable nature, the only defense against rogue APs is vigilance through
frequent site surveys (using tools such as AirMagnet, NetStumbler, and
AiroPeek) and physical security.
Frequent site surveys also have the advantage of uncovering the unau-
thorized APs that company staff members might have set up in their own
work areas, thereby compromising the entire network and completely
undoing the hard work that went into securing the network in the ﬁrst
place.These unauthorized APs usually are set up with no malicious intent
but rather were created for the convenience of the user, who might want
to be able to connect to the network via his or her laptop in meeting
rooms, break rooms, or other areas that do not have wired outlets. Even if
your company does not use, or plan to use, a wireless network, you
should consider doing regular wireless site surveys to see if someone has
violated your company security policy by placing an unauthorized AP on
the network, regardless of that person’s intent.
Hijacking and Modifying a Wireless Network
Numerous techniques are available for an attacker to hijack a wireless net-
work or session. Unlike some attacks, network and security administrators
may be unable to distinguish between the hijacker and a legitimate pas-
senger. Many tools are available to the network hijacker.These tools are
based on basic implementation issues within almost every network device
available today.
As TCP/IP packets go through switches, routers, and APs, each device
looks at the destination IP address and compares it with the IP addresses
it knows to be local. If the address is not in the table, the device hands
the packet off to its default gateway.This table is used to coordinate the
IP address with the MAC addresses that are known to be local to the
device. In many situations, this list is a dynamic one that is built up from
www.syngress.com
474
Chapter 12 • Wireless Security Project Plan

trafﬁc passing through the device and through Address Resolution
Protocol (ARP) notiﬁcations from new devices joining the network.
There is no authentication or veriﬁcation that the request the device
received is valid.Thus, a malicious user is able to send messages to routing
devices and APs stating that his MAC address is associated with a known
IP address. From then on, all trafﬁc that goes through that router destined
for the hijacked IP address will be handed off to the hacker’s machine. If
the attacker spoofs as the default gateway or a speciﬁc host on the net-
work, all machines trying to get to the network or the spoofed machine
will connect to the attacker’s machine instead of their intended target. If
the attacker is clever, he will use this information only to identify pass-
words and other necessary information and route the rest of the trafﬁc to
the intended recipients. If he does this, the end users will have no idea
that this man in the middle has intercepted their communications and
compromised their passwords and information.
Another clever attack can be accomplished through the use of rogue
APs. If the attacker is able to put together an AP with enough strength,
the end users might not be able to tell which AP is the authorized one
that they should be using. In fact, most will not even know that another
AP is available. Using this technique, the attacker is able to receive
authentication requests and information from the end workstation
regarding the secret key and where users are attempting to connect.
These rogue APs can also be used to attempt to break into more
tightly conﬁgured wireless APs. Utilizing tools such as AirSnort and
WEPCrack requires a large amount of data to be able to decrypt the
secret key.An intruder sitting in a car in front of your house or ofﬁce is
noticeable and thus will generally not have time to ﬁnish acquiring
enough information to break the key. However, if the attacker installs a
tiny, easily hidden machine in an inconspicuous location, this machine
could sit there long enough to break the key and possibly act as an
external AP into the wireless network it has hacked. Once an attacker has
identiﬁed a network for attack and spoofed his MAC address to become a
valid member of the network, the attacker can gain further information
that is not available through simple snifﬁng. If the network being attacked
www.syngress.com
Wireless Security Project Plan • Chapter 12
475

is using SSH to access the hosts, just stealing a password might be easier
than attempting to break into the host using an available exploit.
By simply ARP-spooﬁng the connection with the AP, the attacker can
appear to be the host from which the attacker wants to steal passwords.
The attacker can then cause all wireless users who are attempting to SSH
into the host to connect to the rogue machine instead. When these users
attempt to sign on with their passwords, the attacker is then able to, ﬁrst,
receive their passwords, and, second, pass on the connection to the real
end destination. If the attacker does not perform the second step, it
increases the likelihood that the attack will be noticed because users will
begin to complain that they are unable to connect to the host.
Attacking Encrypted Networks
One of the most common ways that administrators attempt to protect
their wireless networks is with encryption. Unfortunately, the two pri-
mary means of protection, Wired Equivalent Protection (WEP) and Wi-
Fi Protected Access (WPA), have ﬂaws that allow them to be exploited.
This section discusses how to attack networks that are protected by WEP
and WPA.
The most commonly used form of encryption protecting wireless
networks is WEP. WEP is a ﬂawed implementation of the Rivest Cipher
4 (RC4) encryption standard. Scott Fluhrer of Cisco Systems, Itsik
Mantin, and Adi Shamir of the Weizmann Institute detailed the ﬂaws in
WEP in their joint paper Weaknesses of the Key Scheduling Algorithm of
RC4 (www.drizzle.com/~aboba/IEEE/rc4_ksaproc.pdf ). In short, WEP
utilizes a ﬁxed secret key. Weak initialization vectors sometimes are gener-
ated to encrypt WEP packets. When enough weak initialization vectors
are captured, the secret key can be cracked.There are a two popular tools
available on the Internet that can be used to crack WEP encryption.
1. Windows WEPCrack (Windows)
WEPCrack (http://wepcrack.sourceforge.net) is a set of Open
Source PERL scripts intended to break 802.11 WEP secret keys.
It was the ﬁrst publicly available implementation of the attack
www.syngress.com
476
Chapter 12 • Wireless Security Project Plan

described by Fluhrer, Mantin, and Shamir in their paper. Since a
PERL interpreter is not installed by default with Windows Server
2003 (or any version of Windows, for that matter), you will need
to install one to run the scripts. One or both of the following
freely available solutions will give you what you need: Cygwin
(www.cygwin.com) or ActiveState ActivePerl (www.activestate.
com/Products/ActivePerl).The more robust option is to install
Cygwin. Cygwin is a Linux-like environment for Windows that
consists of a DLL (cygwin1.dll) to provide Linux emulation func-
tionality and a seemingly exhaustive collection of tools, which
provide the Linux look and feel.The full suite of PERL develop-
ment tools and libraries are available; however, the PERL inter-
preter is all that is required to run the WEPCrack scripts.The
other option, using a Windows-based PERL interpreter, may be
desirable if you have no need for Linux emulation functionality
on your workstation or server.ActiveState ActivePerl, available by
free download from the ActiveState Web site (www.activestate.
com), provides a robust PERL development environment that is
native to Windows. WEPCrack was written so that it could be
ported to any platform that has a PERL interpreter without
needing to modify the code.
2. AirSnort (Linux)
When enough weak initialization vectors are identiﬁed,
AirSnort begins attempting to crack the WEP key.There are
about 16 million possible initialization vectors generated by wire-
less networks using WEP.Approximately 9 thousand of these are
weak.AirSnort considers these 9 thousand weak initialization
vectors as “interesting.”According to The Shmoo Group, most
WEP keys can be guessed after collecting approximately 2 thou-
sand weak initialization vectors.
After some weak initialization vectors have been collected,
AirSnort will attempt to crack the WEP key.A vast majority
(approximately 95 percent) of weak initialization vectors provide
www.syngress.com
Wireless Security Project Plan • Chapter 12
477

no usable information about the WEP key. One way you can try
to decrease the amount of time it takes to crack the key is by
increasing the crack breadth in AirSnort.According to the Shmoo
group’s Frequently Asked Questions site for AirSnort
(http://airsnort.shmoo.com/faq.html), this will increase the
number of key possibilities examined when AirSnort attempts to
crack the WEP key.
The most difﬁcult part of attacking wireless networks
deployed with WEP encryption enabled is the amount of time it
takes. It usually requires a minimum of 1200 weak initialization
vectors to crack the WEP key. It can take days or even weeks to
capture this many weak initialization vectors.
Once you have the cracked key, it’s a simple matter of adding
a preferred network in the wireless networking properties
(Windows), entering the SSID and the cracked WEP key. In
Linux, edit the wireless.opts ﬁle to include the cracked key and
then restart PCMCIA services.
Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) networks were discovered to be less
secure than originally thought when Robert Moskowitz of ICSA Labs
discovered that WPA is vulnerable to an ofﬂine dictionary attack, a brute
force attack that tries passwords and/or keys from a precompiled list of
values (http://wiﬁnetnews.com/archives/002452.html). WPA utilizes a
256-bit preshared key or a passphrase that can vary in length from eight
to 63 bytes. Short passphrase-based keys (less than 20 bytes) are vulnerable
to the ofﬂine dictionary attack.The preshared key that is used to set up
the WPA encryption can be captured during the initial communication
between the access point and the client card. Once you have captured the
preshared key, you can use that to essentially “guess” the WPA key using
the same concepts that are used in any password dictionary attack. In
theory, this type of dictionary attack takes less time and effort than
attacking WEP.Although there are currently no tools available to auto-
mate cracking WPA, it is only a matter of time before they are available.
If you’re using WPA, you should use a long, complex string that is less
vulnerable to a dictionary attack than a short, simple one would be.

Legal Liabilities
We discussed legal liabilities in detail in Chapter 9, and if you skipped
that chapter for any reason, be sure to read up on the legal issues sur-
rounding IT security these days.The bottom line is that the laws are
changing. Requirements are sometimes unclear or conﬂicting and lack of
attention to detail, and lack of “reasonable care” can be cause for litigation
in the event of a serious security breach. Companies that are attacked that
fail to recover quickly have a 50 percent chance of failing within three
years of the attack. Beyond that, your company and its executive team
could face stiff penalties if reasonable care is not taken.
With wireless networking on the rise and the price of wireless com-
ponents falling, it’s easy to see how a company could experience a wire-
less breach perhaps more easily than an attack via the Internet or some
other opening.Therefore, you should be sure that your wireless security
plan is thorough and an assessment should be conducted even if your
company does not ofﬁcially have a wireless network.You never know if
your users (or the bad guys) have installed access points until you scan for
them. Saying that your company did not install or sanction a wireless net-
work will be no defense if your network is breached and you ﬁnd your-
self being sued by customers whose personal data was stolen.
Business Intelligence…
Lawmakers Crack Down on Wi-Fi Crime
According to an April 26, 2006 article on internetnews.com, by Tim
Scannell, if you’re a business owner in New York and you use a wireless
LAN to handle sensitive customer data, you had better make sure it’s
secure. Lawmakers in White Plains, New York (Westchester County, north
of Manhattan) passed a law making it illegal for a business not to take
necessary precautions to protect its wireless networks from accidental or
deliberate abuse. The new law is less restrictive of public Wi-Fi hotspots
like those found in coffee shops and hotels. While many members of the

business community support this legislation, not everyone is a big fan of
this approach. It’s an issue that needs to be addressed, and according to
Andrew Neuman, senior assistant to the county executive, “At the end of
the day, not one person has said it’s a bad idea.
“IBM’s corporate headquarters is located in White Plains, and there-
fore must also comply with the new law, which goes into effect in
October. Executives there have not yet responded to the legislation,”
Neuman said. 
Experts from the technical community have a mixed reaction to the
legislation. 
“Strong authentication and encryption combined with Wi-Fi secu-
rity technologies will ultimately be the best remedy for keeping the bad
guys off the network while protecting users from connecting to unau-
thorized devices.” Some experts are not convinced that forcing busi-
nesses to secure their wireless networks is the best approach. “As much
as the local government thinks they’re doing the right thing by enforcing
some sort of wireless security, is it really within their rights to do so?”
said Doug DiNunzio, senior product manager for Bluesocket in
Burlington, Mass.

Costs
Remember that in every project planning process, at some point you
should ask the question,“What if we do nothing?”The reason for asking
this question is to avoid solving a problem that doesn’t actually need to
be solved. In the case of wireless security, you can’t just “do nothing” if
you have a wireless network, but suppose you don’t have a wireless net-
work yet, and you’re planning security for your proposed wireless net-
work? Now the question makes a bit more sense—in essence “What if
we don’t have a wireless network?” Don’t start with the assumption you
should have a wireless network just because everyone else does or because
it’s the latest, greatest thing. If you haven’t developed a strong business
case for why you should have a wireless network, you’ve skipped an
important step. Most companies these days can make the case for having a
wireless network, if only from the perspective of providing ﬂexibility and
www.syngress.com
480
Chapter 12 • Wireless Security Project Plan

avoiding the need to run more cabling. Make sure you start with a clean
baseline and add from there. However, even if your ﬁrm decides against
deploying a wireless network, you can’t assume your employees (or ven-
dors, visitors, or intruders) haven’t installed wireless access points that
create rogue wireless networks on their own. In this case, you would need
to look for wireless networks attached to the corporate network on a
regular basis as part of your operational security.
Once you’ve decided to implement a wireless network, you’ll need to
include the initial and ongoing costs of securing the wireless network to
your cost estimates. If you already have a wireless network installed, you’ll
have to address the cost of the wireless network security component sep-
arately, as we’re doing here.Your costs include the cost of securing the
network to which wireless access points connect, securing the communi-
cation between wireless devices (WEP, WPA) and securing the wireless
devices themselves (laptops, PDAs).You should also ask yourself whether
the cost of securing all of this is worth either having a wireless network
or securing the wireless network. Using the hotel guest wireless network
example, there’s no reason to implement security because it would be an
extremely high-maintenance activity to provide secure access to guests
who may stay for only a night or two. However, since the WAP has to
connect to the Internet, you will need to plan how to provide this access
without risking your own network’s security.
In addition to these implementation costs, you need to assess the cost
to the organization of a wireless security breach. If the network is com-
promised, how much will it cost you to repair the damage? What are the
costs of remediation, legal defense, and possibly marketing/PR to address
a potential breach? Finally, you need to look at the cost/beneﬁt analysis
to determine how all the potential costs of a breach compare to the cost
of securing the network in the ﬁrst place.Though the answer often
comes out in favor of security solutions, you want to be comfortable with
your analysis so you can defend it to your executive team or project
sponsor.

Time
Perhaps the biggest cost (other than potential legal bills) is the time lost
due to investigating and repairing a security breach that occurs, especially
a wireless attack that can be a bit more obscure in some ways.As you’re
probably painfully aware, a security breach takes time away from other IT
projects and IT work but it also causes lost productivity for everyone in
the organization.Although you may not be able to speciﬁcally quantify
the cost of a potential security breach in terms of the time it would take
to address such a breach, you can certainly look at it from a macro level.
If your company is highly dependent on computers and electronic com-
munications, your time costs will be higher than if your company uses
computers but doesn’t rely signiﬁcantly on them.Take a look at the cost
of downtime and give it an overall assessment if you can’t speciﬁcally
quantify it.
People
The people risk is the risk that is incurred from people’s actions. In a
wireless networking situation, your people risk is twofold. First, has
anyone inside the organization installed a wireless access point? Whether
their intentions are good or bad, the result will be the same—a huge
security hole that circumvents all the best network security measures
you’ve put in place.Therefore, while you need to assess the risk in this
regard, you also need to implement policies regarding the unauthorized
implementation of any technology, including wireless devices, and you
need to implement a procedure for sweeping your network on a regular
basis looking for rogue access points.
Another people risk is the risk of users with wireless devices con-
necting to the network via unsecured channels. If they are working with
sensitive data on a laptop and they connect via an unsecured connection
from a hotel or airport lounge, there is some danger their wireless com-
munication could be hijacked. Implementing policies and procedures for
secure wireless communication for mobile users is key to assessing your
risk in this area.

Chapter 12 • Wireless Security Project Plan

The outside people risk is that a vendor, supplier, or visitor could
install a rogue access point anywhere in your building.Assessing the risk
includes reviewing the physical environment of your building and ﬁnding
places an access point could be installed in an unobtrusive manner.Your
risk assessment might include a physical risk review to ﬁnd spots where a
WAP could be installed and creating tasks in your project plan to make
those spots more secure and/or more visible.
Finally, you’ll need to look at the external risk of people who may
come in close enough contact with your physical premises to interfere
with wireless network operations.This might include RF jamming, intru-
sion, spooﬁng, and more.
Impact Analysis
The impact analysis is an essential element in a security project because,
as we’ve stated numerous times, you have to balance the time and cost of
implementing security against the potential impact of a security breach. If
your company makes nuts and bolts, stores no real conﬁdential informa-
tion, and doesn’t store personal information such as credit card numbers
or medical records on your network, the impact of a security breach is far
lower than for a high-proﬁle hospital or major university. No doubt a
security breach could potentially cause embarrassment and lost produc-
tivity if intruders impacted the conﬁdentiality, integrity, or availability of
network resources, but the chance you’d end up in a law suit for failing
to protect certain data would probably be low.Therefore, it’s important
that you perform an impact analysis to understand how an intrusion of
your wireless network could impact your company.Your analysis should
include (but should not necessarily be limited to):
1. Data loss—conﬁdentiality, integrity and/or availability
2. Productivity loss—direct and indirect (what was not getting done
when the situation was being repaired)
3. Financial loss—direct and indirect

4. Loss of reputation—customers, vendors, employees, public mar-
kets
5. Loss of trust and conﬁdence—customers, vendors, employees,
public markets
6. Legal or regulatory implications—what are the legal, ﬁnancial,

The Proliferation of Wireless Technologies
A recent article on MIT’s Technology Review Web site highlights the new
ways Wi-Fi technology is being used. Researchers at Brigham & Women’s
Hospital in Boston are collaborating with Harvard Medical School and
MIT to test what they’re calling “Scalable Medical Alert and Response
Technology” (SMART) for use in ER waiting rooms. Researchers hope this
wireless medical technology using sensors will make waiting in the
emergency room a bit less life-threatening. The author of the article
says: “Here’s a scenario: You ﬁnd yourself sitting in a local emergency
room, or standing in the admitting line of an emergency clinic. But
instead of just cooling your heels (and having a cardboard tag tied
around your neck, as Gulf Coast clinics did after Katrina), you’ve been
given a fanny pack containing a pocket-sized computer and ultrasound
transponder. And wires come out of it, leading to a sensor on your ﬁnger
and some more on your chest. Now, if something happens—say, you
quietly go into a cardiac arrest—the doctors will know and can come
running.” Let’s hope hackers don’t ﬁnd a way into this one.

Wireless Security Project Parameters
We’ve looked at many aspects of wireless networking, the risks and
threats, the tools both you and the hackers can use. Now, let’s start plan-
ning the wireless security project. We’ll begin where all projects should
begin, with the problem statement and mission statement.
Your problem statement should reﬂect the current situation in your
company, whether you have a wireless network or not. We’ve included a
couple of sample problem statement to get you started; you’ll need to
tweak it to reﬂect your company’s situation.
We currently have a wireless network that is unsecured. We
also have business users who travel frequently and utilize
wireless connections to check e-mail and log into the net-
work. We do not know our level of exposure and we have
no security measures in place.
We currently do not have a wireless network but we do not
know if there are ad hoc wireless networks in existence
putting our network assets at risk. We have users with wire-
less devices including laptops and PDAs and want to ensure
they are secure when connecting to our network, whether
internally (unauthorized wireless networks) or externally.
Your mission or outcome statement should focus on the other side of
the problem statement—where do you want to be when your project is
complete? We’ve included two mission or outcome statements to give
you a running start.
We will have a reasonably secure wireless network that will
keep out most intruders. We will implement security mea-
sures on all wireless mobile devices and create new oper-
ating procedures and user policies to support this higher
level of desired security.
We will continue to operate without an ofﬁcial corporate
wireless network but will implement IT operational plans
that include scanning for rogue wireless networks on our
www.syngress.com
Wireless Security Project Plan • Chapter 12
485

corporate network. We will also educate users and provide
policy guidelines and best practices to keep our corporate
mobile users safe when connecting to our network from
external locations.
Requirements
As you recall from standard project management, we need to deﬁne the
various requirements for this project.They include functional (often user-
driven), technical, and legal or compliance requirements. It’s usually best
to start with functional requirements and develop technical requirements
from there. We’ll discuss functional and technical requirements but as
with everything in these project plans, you’ll need to tailor it to your spe-
ciﬁc organizational needs. Remember that, in general, the functional
requirements describe “what” and the technical requirements describe
“how.”
Since wireless network security does not exist in a vacuum, it’s impor-
tant to remember that the solutions you develop for your wireless secu-
rity project will very likely impact some other project. For example, if
you decide you want to implement authentication or encryption proto-
cols, these may impact all remote connections, all wireless connections, all
users, and so on.Therefore, be sure to check with other IT security pro-
ject teams or with your IT security program manager (if one exists) to
coordinate the implementation of these across the enterprise.These may
end up rolling up into the corporate IT project plan so that all the indi-
vidual security area project (ISAP) plans coordinate their use of authenti-
cation or security protocols.You don’t need four different groups
identifying and implementing security protocols and work at cross-pur-
poses in the organization.
Some people also like to include “success factors” in project require-
ments because they want to deﬁne what is required to be successful.That
is certainly one way it can be documented and if that is the method you
use, that’s ﬁne. In this methodology, we use “assumptions” (deﬁned later
in this chapter) to capture the things we’re assuming will be in place so
www.syngress.com
486
Chapter 12 • Wireless Security Project Plan

the project will be successful.There are probably 9 million opinions on
how to approach this and the important point is that you do address it
either as requirements for success or assumptions about what will be in
place to help the project be a success. We’ve addressed it in the project
assumptions.
One very important note here: we have not speciﬁcally talked about
forming your project team (we’ll discuss that later in this chapter), but
you would be remiss to formulate your requirements without additional
input from your IT staff as well as from key stakeholders. Users, depart-
mental managers, trainers, and HR representatives should be included in
deﬁning functional requirements.Your IT team can then translate them
into technical requirements. In addition, you will need these same experts
to help you deﬁne appropriate policies, procedures, and processes for
implementing and maintaining wireless security once project work is
complete. Building this important information and feedback into your
project plan will help you deliver a project that meets diverse organiza-
tional needs.
Functional Requirements
Different people phrase functional requirements differently. How you
word them is not nearly as important as that you word them to include
what you want your wireless project to include by way of functionality.
Therefore, the functional requirements for a wireless security project
could include:
1. Address physical security—Monitoring and/or restricting access
to company’s physical premises and network components.
2. Address network components—Identifying and locating all
existing authorized and rogue access points and ad hoc networks.
Identifying all existing wireless devices and connection methods.
Identifying procedures for locating rogues and how they will be
addressed.
3. Develop ability to monitor and detect intrusion via wireless
access.
www.syngress.com
Wireless Security Project Plan • Chapter 12
487

4. Develop ability to monitor and manage wireless data conﬁden-
tiality, integrity, and access.
5. Develop list of network resources to which users should have
access (with the understanding that not all resources need to be
accessible via remote or wireless connections).
6. Develop policies and procedures to dictate appropriate/secure use
and to educate users about maintaining wireless security.
Technical Requirements
Technical requirements for a wireless security project could include:
1. Physical security—Security guards monitoring/controlling
building entry/exit (ensuring proper identiﬁcation, preventing
“tailgating” (when one visitor enters right behind another autho-
rized visitor), requiring visitors to sign in or be escorted, etc.),
card key access, locked server rooms, locked doors, cabinets, and
drawers in public or easy-to-access locations.
2. Address wireless network components—Based on the data pro-
vided earlier in this chapter (Threat Assessment), identify the
tools needed to locate wireless components on your network.
3. Identify the technical requirements for an intrusion
detection/intrusion prevention (IDS/IPS) system that has the
ability to monitor and detect intrusion via wireless access.
4. Identify the technical requirements for encryption, secure con-
nections, and secure access via wireless technologies and via
Internet connections accessed through wireless connections in a
variety of locations.
5. Identify the technical requirements for securing a variety of wire-
less devices and policies for the use of such devices.
6. Identify the speciﬁc technical requirements for users regarding
the use of wireless networks and wireless devices on company
www.syngress.com
488
Chapter 12 • Wireless Security Project Plan

premises and off company premises when connecting to the
company network and noncompany networks.
7. Identify the ongoing operational procedures related to main-
taining wireless security including frequency and method of scan-
ning, physical inspection practices, and maintaining security on
user’s wireless devices.
You may have other requirements and your technical speciﬁcations
should be much more speciﬁc. For instance, you should identify which
assets (laptops, PDAs) you’ll use for identifying all existing authorized and
unauthorized access points and ad hoc networks.What operating system
are these devices using? Which programs will you use for this activity,
which version, where will you get it, what else is needed (other equipment,
other programs) to perform this activity and what are the speciﬁcations of
the program (i.e., what does this program need to do?). In some cases, you
may be listing the requirements that are used to evaluate and purchase (or
download in the case of freeware) a program. In other cases, you may be
listing the technical requirements for the laptop, all software applications,
antenna, and so on.This is just one example of the speciﬁcity you should
strive for in your technical requirements.The seven items in the list are rep-
resentative of the types of technical requirements, but you will probably
have a longer list of technical requirements and your list should be far more
speciﬁc. Here’s an example of the level of speciﬁcity for a single elements of
the technical speciﬁcations that would be desirable:
■
Dell Inspiron 3500 laptop with 512KB RAM, 40GB hard disk
running Windows XP Professional (Asset tag # 44932)
■
Orinoco Classic Gold wireless card
■
NetStumbler ver. 0.4.0
In addition, you might also specify a number of other tools you 
want to use in your wireless security project including (but certainly not
limited to):

Professional
Technical requirements might also include speciﬁc training initiatives
to ensure staff is trained on key technologies, assessment methodologies, or
wireless network detection and intrusion tools. Since hackers are well
trained in these technologies, you should ensure your own staff is also well
versed in using these tools so that you can at least level the playing ﬁeld.
Legal/Compliance Requirements
This is an area where you’re going to have to do some serious research,
talk with your legal, ﬁnancial, and HR departments and determine
exactly which requirements your company must comply with.As we dis-
cussed in Chapter 9, there are a wide variety of laws and regulations, and
chances are good if you’re the head of your IT department that you’re
already aware of the particular regulations you need to address. However,
it’s not a bad idea to do some additional research to be sure you’ve got
your bases covered.
www.syngress.com
490
Chapter 12 • Wireless Security Project Plan

Once you’re clear which rules, regulations, and laws apply to your
business, you’ll need to develop a speciﬁc list of requirements. In many
cases, these can and should be incorporated into your functional and
technical requirements.You may choose to keep track of your compliance
requirements within your functional and technical speciﬁcation by ﬂag-
ging them in some manner such as using COMP: at the beginning of a
requirements description or by putting them in one section. Since many
of the compliance requirements may overlap regular requirements, you’ll
need to determine the best method for listing compliance-related
requirements. For example, some requirements might be both your own
requirements and those needed for compliance. Others might be to satisfy
compliance issues only. Do you need to know which is which? Maybe
yes, maybe no, you’ll have to decide. Regardless of your approach, you
should be sure to clearly indicate which items are required for compli-
ance and what those compliance requirements are speciﬁcally.This should
later be incorporated into task details. For example, suppose in order to
be compliant with some particular requirement you must use encryption.
The compliance requirement doesn’t specify which type of encryption or
how it is to be implemented.Therefore, you choose to implement WEP.
You’ll need to include this in your functional (encryption), technical
(128-bit WEP), and compliance (data encryption methods) requirements.
You’ll need to add one or more tasks to your Work Breakdown Structure
(WBS) that implement WEP on your wireless network.You’ll need to
add testing tasks to ensure that the WEP implementation works as speci-
ﬁed and that users can connect wirelessly to the network once WEP is
implemented.Then, you’ll need tasks in your WBS that also document
the implementation of WEP as a compliance requirement and generate
whatever documentation is required in order to prove compliance.
Policy Requirements
Policy requirements may fall under functional requirements but there’s no
rule that you can’t create your own category of requirements if it helps
ensure you cover all the bases. We’ll look at policies in more detail in a
www.syngress.com
Wireless Security Project Plan • Chapter 12
491

later chapter, but for now, we will walk through a few ideas for policies
related to wireless security.
User policies—Installation of wireless access points on the com-
pany network; use of wireless devices on company premises; use
of wireless devices when traveling; appropriate use of unsecured
wireless networks when traveling; guidelines for securing conﬁ-
dential data when traveling.
IT policies—Installation of wireless access points on the com-
pany network; management and authorization of wireless devices
for use on company premises; management and authorization of
wireless devices for users who travel; conﬁguration management
for company-issued wireless devices; conﬁguration management
for noncompany issued wireless devices; procedures for moni-
toring the presence of wireless networks connected to the corpo-
rate network; procedures for monitoring intrusion via the
wireless network; emergency response to wireless intrusion event;
remediation for response to wireless intrusion event.
Scope
The scope of your wireless security project is based on a number of fac-
tors unique to your organization.Your scope statement should identify
what is and what is not part of the project. By deﬁning what is not
included, you can be sure that everyone is pretty clear about where this
project is headed. Where possible, identify scope using speciﬁc, measur-
able terms. For instance, your scope might include the building located at
123 Main Street but not the manufacturing facility located at 999 South
Street since the manufacturing facility does not have a computer network
but only standalone manufacturing computers.You might say your scope
includes all network segments, all wireless devices including (list all
authorized devices).You might say your project includes all devices that
run 802.11 or 802.1X but will not address wireless keyboard, mice, over-
head projection systems, remote controls for televisions, sound systems or
www.syngress.com
492
Chapter 12 • Wireless Security Project Plan

projectors, nor will it address Bluetooth or RFID. Once you get into the
swing of things, you should be able to clearly say what is and is not
included and this will give you a great idea of how big this project is (and
is not).
Schedule
You may not be able to create any sort of meaningful schedule at this
point, but that’s ﬁne.What you should do at this point is see if there are
any external drivers for your schedule such as hard deadlines, legal or
compliance deadlines that must be met, funding events, public market
events, and so on. Look around to see if there is anything that would
require your project be completed by a speciﬁed time. If not, you may
have a bit more ﬂexibility on your wireless project schedule than you ini-
tially thought.You might also be able to develop a high-level under-
standing of how long this project is likely to take. How long will it take
you to inventory all company-issued wireless devices? It probably depends
on whether you have a database of devices with asset tags and device
owners or not. If you have to walk around to every user and ask what
devices they have, what operating system they’re running, what type of
wireless connection they use, you’re going to need more time.This kind of
information can be used to generate a ﬁrst-pass schedule estimate that tells
you this project is three months or twelve months long. If you still can’t
make a ﬁrst-pass guess, that’s ﬁne but be sure to ask yourself (and your
team),“What other information would we need to generate a fairly good
ballpark estimate?”That way, you can focus on clarifying that data rather
than randomly gathering data that gets you no closer to the answer.
After you create your Work Breakdown Structure, you should be able
to create a very tight schedule. Once you ﬁnalize the WBS, it will be the
schedule you have to commit to and manage against.At this juncture,
you’ll just need a rough idea of timelines, but be careful here.Any esti-
mate you casually toss around now might come back to haunt you later.
People have a strange way of remembering the one thing you wish they’d
forget and if you say,“I don’t know, I think it should just take a couple of
www.syngress.com
Wireless Security Project Plan • Chapter 12
493

months,” you’ll ﬁnd that 59 days later someone is asking you for the
results of your project. What they didn’t hear (or didn’t want to hear) is
that “it might take 60 days and that’s once we begin working on project
tasks.” Be cautious about tossing around estimates and if you’re really
pressed to give an initial estimate, pack it with as many disclaimers as you
can. Later, you will have to (and should) commit to a project schedule but
at this juncture, it’s not much more than guesswork.
Budget
Just as your schedule may be fuzzy at this juncture, the budget may also
be vague at the moment.As with schedule, you need to determine if
there are any budgetary constraints speciﬁcally tied to your wireless secu-
rity project budget. It’s possible there was recently a new allocation for
wireless technology in your ﬁrm and you can pull from that budget. It’s
possible there was recently a budget cut and all budgets were slashed 10
percent, which will trickle down into your IT department.Your choice at
that point will likely be to slash all your projects by 10 percent or look at
your project list and determine which project(s) should take the hit. In
fact, this might be the opportunity you needed to kill a dead project that
needed to go away but no one had the nerve to cancel it and reallocate
those funds to your wireless security project.
Every company will differ in the way it allocates funds for projects
and the way budgets are developed. However, your starting point needs to
be your requirements list and your scope because those will dictate how
big the project is. Once you understand how large the project is, you can
begin to balance schedule, budget, and quality to ﬁnd the optimal mix for
your wireless security project.
As with schedule, once you’ve developed your WBS and your detailed
task list, you should have a very clear sense of how much the project will
cost and you should be prepared to defend your budget and manage it.
The same perils exist as well. If you toss out a number, you can be sure
that will be your top number and it’s only going down from there, so
avoid giving any ﬁnancial estimates until you have a better idea of what
www.syngress.com
494
Chapter 12 • Wireless Security Project Plan

number is realistic. Many organizations seem to be more tolerant of not
knowing an exact budget more so than not knowing an exact schedule.
Most companies ask “how long will it take?” before they ask “how much
will it cost?” though every company culture is different. If you’re pressed
for a budget estimate before you have any idea of what it will cost, just
say you’re working up an estimate and should have one ready by (when-
ever) but it’s too early to provide any estimates.They might not like that
answer but it’s safer than being held to a randomly generated guess.
Quality
You may have a distinct approach to quality in your wireless security pro-
ject in mind but if not, you can begin by deﬁning what level of conﬁ-
dence you want in your wireless security. For instance, 100 percent
conﬁdence that your wireless network is secure will be costly and time-
consuming (not to mention impossible to achieve) and the risks to your
network do not support such an iron-clad approach. What if you were 80
percent sure your wireless network was secure, would that be sufﬁcient? It
may seem odd to accept less than 100 percent conﬁdence or 100 percent
quality but that’s not realistic given the time/cost factors involved with
that level of quality. Do you want to use military standards for your ﬁrm?
That’s probably over-engineering the solution to a great extent for most
companies, so you may choose to implement 80 percent of the DoD
standards.You can see that as you begin to look at your approach, you can
begin to deﬁne quality in meaningful ways.
Keep in mind that the functional and technical requirements also help
deﬁne quality by the inclusion or exclusion of various requirements. In
fact, your technical requirements generally deﬁne your initial level of
quality and can be used as a great starting place for understanding project
quality.
Quality is also supported and developed through proper training. If
your team members don’t know how to use AirSnort or NetStumbler,
there’s a good chance that project results will be less than optimal.
Identify training needs once you’ve identiﬁed key skills needed (see next
www.syngress.com
Wireless Security Project Plan • Chapter 12
495

section) and be sure that you have the skills and expertise needed to
deliver a quality job.
Finally, understand that quality is as much a mindset as a measure-
ment. Keep your team focused on doing their jobs with 100 percent
accuracy. If every task is completed as speciﬁed, you should have a high-
quality result on the other end of your project work.Therefore, quality
can be built in to task details (completion criteria are excellent for
driving quality in a project) and quality can be built one task at a time.
Focus your team on delivering quality and use the tools at your disposal
to monitor and measure quality as you move through your project work.
Business Intelligence…
Quality in Technical Projects
Most people don’t like to admit there’s something they don’t know and
technical people are probably at the top of that list. Given that very
human trait, it’s important that you, as the IT security project manager,
create an environment where teammates are encouraged to ask ques-
tions, to say “I don’t know,” and to ask for assistance. Security and pro-
ject quality are both dramatically reduced when someone is stumbling
around trying to ﬁgure out an answer without asking for help to avoid
looking dumb. When time is of the essence, having someone ﬁddle
around with settings or reading the software’s documentation or Help
ﬁle may not be the most productive use of time, especially if there is
someone on the team (or externally) that has the answer and could help.
Discovery is a wonderful way to learn, but it’s not always the most pro-
ductive use of time when time is of the essence. Having a more experi-
enced team member provide answers, assistance, or even impromptu
training is more efﬁcient in some instances, and it can happen only
when team members feel comfortable saying “I don’t know” or “I need
some assistance.” Pairing subject matter experts with novices can foster
a learning environment. Creating an atmosphere of open teamwork will
improve the quality of your project and increase everyone’s skills along
the way.

Chapter 12 • Wireless Security Project Plan

Once you have deﬁned your initial scope, schedule, budget, and
quality, you also need to look at the relative priority of those parameters.
What is your least ﬂexible parameter? Which one absolutely must be
met? Which parameter is your most ﬂexible, the one that can “give” if
things start going wrong? This is critically important to understand before
you launch the project so if you’re not clear about your least ﬂexible and
most ﬂexible parameters, you need to ﬁnd out now. Some people misun-
derstand the nature of this discussion and think it’s just a way to avoid
responsibility for results.Although some might use it that way, it’s impor-
tant to understand that things will change during the course of the pro-
ject.As the project manager, you need to understand how to prioritize
things and how to make the best decisions for the project. Understanding
the least and most ﬂexible parameters will provide you the tools you need
to make sound decisions without letting you off the hook for delivering
results. If you haven’t talked with your project sponsor yet or if you
haven’t clariﬁed the priorities yet, develop your own assessment of priori-
ties based on your current understanding of constraints and then discuss
them with your project sponsor. If there’s any disagreement or confusion,
be sure to follow up with an e-mail clarifying or reiterating the result of
the meeting so there’s no confusion down the road.
Key Skills Needed
Throughout this book, we’ve discussed deﬁning the skills needed before
you identify the people for your project because you can keep a more
open mind about what you need without ﬁltering it through the people
issues you might encounter. For your wireless security project, you’ll need
a variety of skills and we’ve provided a list to start you off. Keep in mind
it may not include everything you need for your wireless security project
or it might include things that you don’t need; you will have to ﬁne tune
this to ensure it meets the unique requirements of your project.

Key Personnel Needed
The list of needed skills is pretty extensive, so your ﬁrst task, once you’ve
completed the skills needs assessment, is to match those skills to your cur-
rent team. Identify any gaps and decide whether you need to ﬁll those
gaps with training, hiring, or contracting. One way to discern this is by
developing a sort of “gap hierarchy” where the gaps are prioritized based
on how big or critical they are. For example, if someone on your team is
well-versed in operating systems but isn’t up to speed on PDA operating
systems, then training might be in order. On the other hand, if you have
no one on your team well-versed in secure remote communication
methods, including authentication and encryption protocols, you may
want to contract out for that skill. However, if you determine that you will
have an on-going need for that skill set, you may want to get permission
to hire another IT person to complement your team’s skills or send one of
your existing people to extensive training.You’ll have to balance your
immediate needs against your long-term needs to ﬁnd the right mix.
When you get into project scheduling, you’ll ﬁnd out where you have
resource constraints including double-booking someone for project work
based on a particularly unique skill set they may have.This may lead you
to train additional IT staff or to hire an outside contractor to ﬁll in those
gaps or help you work around those constraints.
This is also a good time to make sure you know who your project
sponsor is and what his or her schedule looks like during the estimated
duration of the project. We’re assuming you’ve already been in contact
with your project sponsor because that is typically how projects are initi-
ated, but if you haven’t identiﬁed or talked with your project sponsor,
there’s no time like the present to do so.
Project Processes and Procedures
The processes and procedures you’ll need for your wireless security pro-
ject are probably much the same as other project processes and proce-
dures. Some additional items that might make sense would be:

ment (already listed), client side software and installations settings,
conﬁguration data, and so on, periodic inventory checks, periodic
physical security checks of wireless equipment
Project Team
After you’ve identiﬁed needed skills and determined the key personnel for
your team, you should begin forming your project team. In addition to the
technical skills mentioned earlier in this chapter, you’ll also need to be sure
to include key stakeholders on your project team, especially during the def-
inition stage (scope, requirements, etc.). Be sure to include user representa-
tives during the deﬁnition phase and also when you begin testing your
wireless security solutions. If you devise a solution that only the most savvy
IT folks can implement, you’ll have a cacophony of dissatisﬁed users
pounding on your door (literally or ﬁguratively).Also be sure to include
subject matter experts including those that can help craft policies and pro-
cedures. Include those who really enjoy working with detail who can mon-
itor, manage, and create your project documentation. If you have a
compliance ofﬁcer or someone who is tasked with monitoring and man-
aging compliance issues, be sure he or she is also included on the project

team. Finally, you may need someone from legal or who understands legal
issues to help guide you as you deﬁne the scope of the project and the
functional and/or technical requirements to ensure you’ve got all your bases
covered. One way to be sure you’ve got the right people on the team is to
ask,“What else do I need to know?” and “Who else needs to know about
this?”Ask this of yourself, your IT staff, and your initial project team.You
can always pare down your project participants but if you miss a key player
you’ll have to deal with the ramiﬁcations, which can include missing a key
element for the project or just having to deal with the political fall-out of
overlooking someone “important.”
Identify project team roles so everyone knows how they ﬁt in and
what they should be doing. For complex or lengthy tasks (to be deﬁned
later), you may assign leads to work with subteams.Also create a team
roster with contact information and be sure to have team members iden-
tify any times they’ll be unavailable (upcoming scheduled vacations or
leave, lengthy training or seminars scheduled, etc.) so you can quickly
determine early in the project cycle whether you’ll need to bring in
more people or ﬁnd ways to ﬁll gaps.
Project Organization
Everyone has a slightly different way of organizing a project, and we dis-
cussed a number of general project organizational ideas earlier in the
book, so we won’t repeat that here. However you choose to organize
your project should include the basics such as deﬁning the project team
structure, how things will proceed, when meetings will occur, who has to
attend, how project status will be reported, how and where documenta-
tion should be stored, and so on. For a security project of this nature, you
may want to divide your project team into different groups and have dif-
ferent groups test each other’s security solutions in a friendly competi-
tion.This might help avoid collusion between team members (leaving
back doors open) and it might also help ensure that testing is thorough
and comprehensive.As we’ve mentioned a number of times, there’s a
danger that testing will test the plan and not test the actual security, so
www.syngress.com
Wireless Security Project Plan • Chapter 12
501

using creative methods to ensure your testing is as thorough as your
attackers is an important part of organizing your project.
It is in this phase you should deﬁne what type of reporting will be
required. One type of reporting for wireless network security that is
needed is a list (and map, if possible) of all known, existing wireless access
points in the building.This will be updated after the scan takes place once
all currently unknown WAPs are also mapped.You’ll need to create
checklists for network and user wireless device inventories and you’ll
need to deﬁne standard operating procedures for your wireless security
project. How are issues tracked and resolved? How are issues escalated?
How are reports formatted and to whom are they submitted? All the run-
of-the-mill project processes should be deﬁned and modiﬁed to meet
your project team’s needs before proceeding into project work.

Obviously, the more detail you can add to your tasks, the better
everyone will understand exactly what it will take to complete the tasks
and the entire project. Using subject matter experts to help complete task
details will yield the most detailed and meaningful task details.
Project Risks
Project risks are those things that can (and likely will) go wrong during
the course of the project.They are things that you should look for and
assess, then plan to avoid or mitigate.This is a great job for all the
“naysayers” on your team.You want them to ﬁnd all the things that could
possibly go wrong and challenge them to ﬁnd a way to avoid those prob-
lems.The risks to a wireless security project are going to be unique to
each organization and they fall along the lines of typical project risks.
Your budget might be at risk, you might risk losing key team members to
layoffs or you might not have the technical skills you think you have.
Although we’ve run through this drill earlier in the book, we’ll
quickly recap here for convenience. First, brainstorm every risk you and
the team can think of. Next, rank the risks in order of criticality and like-
lihood of occurrence. Criticality should be deﬁned so everyone uses the
same ranking system. It could be 1 = Devastating, 5 = Mildly annoying,
whatever works for your team. Likelihood should be a similar ranking
system where 1 = Extremely likely, 5 = Extremely unlikely (in both
ranking systems, there would be similarly deﬁned 2, 3, and 4). Rank each
risk according to both scales and then take a look at them. Use a bit of
human reasoning and see if the ﬁnal, ranked list actually reﬂects reality; if
not, adjust the ranking manually to reﬂect what you all believe is realistic
and likely. Next, select a cut-off point and agree to address only the top
ﬁve or top ten risks.You could spend forever dealing with risks and miti-
www.syngress.com
506
Chapter 12 • Wireless Security Project Plan

gation strategies but if one of your risks is “The world might come to an
end” there’s really not much point in planning for that type of risk and
you might as well move on.
For each risk identiﬁed, devise a strategy to avoid or reduce the risk.
In essence, identify your “Plan B” before you need it. Be sure to look at
the risk of the avoidance or mitigation strategy as well.Again, you could
spend all day looking at risks but if you fail to look at the risk of the mit-
igation strategy, you could easily introduce far worse risk into the mix.
Once you’re conﬁdent in your risk and mitigation strategies, develop
triggers for each risk. In some cases, you may want to develop several trig-
gers for a particular risk. For instance, if one of your risks is that there is a
layoff coming and you don’t know if your staff will be hit, you might add
one trigger for “announcement of departmental layoffs” so that when this
is announced, you begin looking at your Plan B option.A second trigger
might be when the actual personnel are identiﬁed.You might then imple-
ment phase 2 of your Plan B option. Finally, when those personnel have
left the building, you might implement phase 3 of your Plan B option.
For some risks, you may want to add milestones to your project plan
so you can keep an eye out for them. For example, if one of the risks is
that the new equipment you order might not be available at the time you
need it (perhaps you’re implementing a new technology that is just
coming to market), you not only have to create Plan B but you also have
to know to implement Plan B about two weeks before the equipment
should be ordered.Adding milestones for risks helps keep them in the
front of your mind so they don’t sneak up on you.
Project Constraints and Assumptions
In a wireless security project, your constraints will be similar to other
kinds of projects.They are often time, budget, or talent constraints.
Although they should be addressed via your project planning activities,
they may not be. For example, you may be constrained by pending litiga-
tion, by a pending merger or reorganization, or by a pending layoff.
Typically, project constraints are external to your project and generally are
www.syngress.com
Wireless Security Project Plan • Chapter 12
507

tied to your macro-environment. List these and determine if any of them
constitute a “project killer.” If so, you need to circle back with your pro-
ject sponsor and get clariﬁcation as to how to proceed.There’s no point
in ﬁring up a project that is so constrained from the outset that it has
little chance of success.
Assumptions can be thought of as the success factors if you’re assuming
certain conditions will be available during the course of the project. If
you delineated success factors in your requirements, you may choose to
list them as assumptions here as well.The reason for deﬁning your
assumptions is twofold: ﬁrst, you want to make sure that you’re looking at
the project with eyes wide open; second, you want to document the
assumptions you’re making because if any of those things change, it prob-
ably will change the outcome of the project. For instance, if you assume
that you will be able to schedule time to perform penetration testing and
your Vice President of Information Technology comes back to you and
says under no circumstances will you perform penetration testing, that
may be a major setback to your project plan. If this is listed as an assump-
tion, you can gain agreement from your project sponsor about these
assumptions.Then, if things change later, you’ll at least have documenta-
tion showing that it was listed as an assumption (or success factor), that it
was approved by the project sponsor, and that it later changed and had a
negative impact on the project outcome.
Project Schedule and Budget
You’ve created your detailed Work Breakdown Structure and you’ve
developed your task details.At this point, you should be very clear about
your project’s projected schedule and budget.
The schedule should be deﬁned by placing your tasks in optimal
order, then by identifying dependencies. Constraints and conﬂicts should
then be addressed to generate you ﬁrst real project schedule. Since we’re
assuming you’re familiar with basic project management principles, we
won’t go into project scheduling techniques. Of course, using a project
management software program greatly assists in creating and managing a
www.syngress.com
508
Chapter 12 • Wireless Security Project Plan

project schedule, so now would be the time to input project tasks and
generate your schedule if you’re using a software program. Software pro-
grams are also very helpful at identifying the critical path so you can
properly manage those key elements.
As for your schedule, once you’ve delineated all your tasks, you should
also be able to generate a real budget based on the cost of project tasks,
the cost of labor (if you track labor costs with your projects), and the cost
of training and other auxiliary elements.
A quick reminder about both schedule and budget—don’t pad them.
Make your schedule and budget estimates as tight and accurate as pos-
sible, then add a “management reserve” that provides a general buffer
against unexpected changes to your schedule or budget. In this way, you’ll
be able to see more clearly what you planned on doing and what you
were actually able to do. If you pad your estimates, you’ll never really
know what you thought you could accomplish vs. the padded estimate.

Summary
We’ve covered a lot of territory in this chapter. We looked at wireless
security from end to end starting with auditing wireless security.There
are numerous kinds of wireless devices, not all of which you’ll need to
address in your wireless security plan, but if you are unaware of these
device types, you won’t know if they pose a threat or not. We also looked
at the basics of wireless technology reviewing the 802.11 IEEE standard.
Understanding the threats in the wireless world requires a deep
understanding of how attackers work and the tools they use. We reviewed
some of the threat types including war dialing, wardriving (NetStumbling
or stumbling), and Bluetooth attacks. In order to develop a useful wireless
security project plan, you’ll need to perform a risk assessment for your
organization. By dividing this assessment into people, process, and tech-
nology and by looking at conﬁdentiality, integrity, and availability of data,
you can develop a holistic view of your company’s risk proﬁle. Since
you’ll always have to balance security, cost, and practicality, you’ll need to
assess and evaluate your company’s risk proﬁle and risk tolerance to
determine how much security is needed, reasonable, and feasible.
Understanding what assets you’re actually protecting helps you
develop a sound wireless security plan.Assets such as customer credit
cards, health care information, ﬁnancial or bank data, employee lists, trade
secrets, intellectual property, and R&D data are high on the list of valu-
able data assets to be protected. In addition, there are network assets that
should be protected including usernames, passwords, directory listings,
network ﬁrewalls, routers, switches, IP addresses, and ports/protocols in
use.This is information that intruders often use to gain access to the valu-
able data assets or to simply create havoc on the network.An impact anal-
ysis helps you understand the ramiﬁcations of a potential wireless
network intrusion.These elements include data loss (conﬁdentiality,
integrity, availability), productivity loss, ﬁnancial loss, as well as the less
tangible but very real problems of losing your company’s good reputation
or losing the trust and conﬁdence of your customers.There are also legal
or regulatory implications that must be assessed.

Chapter 12 • Wireless Security Project Plan

After going through this material, we began walking through the steps
needed to create a meaningful wireless security project plan. We identi-
ﬁed the problem, the mission or desired outcome, and the solution.The
project deﬁnition includes identifying the functional requirements that
lead, in most cases, to the technical requirements. We also identiﬁed other
types of requirements that could potentially apply to your wireless secu-
rity project including legal or compliance requirements and policy
requirements.There certainly are some areas of overlap between the wire-
less project and other IT security projects, including authentication and
encryption, that should be tied in to other projects as applicable.
Developing the project scope, initial estimated schedule, budget, and
quality were reviewed with an eye toward the unique elements found in a
wireless security project.We were then able to deﬁne the skills needed for
this project.Though your list of skills will differ from the list provided, it
got you thinking in the right direction in terms of the speciﬁc skills needed
for a wireless security project, which differ in some ways from other IT
projects. Once your skill set is deﬁned, you’re ready to identify the people
needed for the project and to begin forming your project team.
With a project team in place, your next major task together is to
create the Work Breakdown Structure. It includes all the major and
minor tasks needed to secure your wireless network including the assess-
ment, design, and implementation of a security solution and, of course,
the documentation of all security changes made.
The risks, assumptions, and constraints are unique to every company
and every IT project, so there’s no speciﬁc information that can be pro-
vided that will ﬁt all organizations. Deﬁning these three key elements is
critical to project success, so be sure you walk through these steps and
clearly articulate these items.
Finally, we provided a quick outline for you to use in developing your
wireless security project plan, as a quick recap for you.Throughout this
chapter, we’ve looked at the standard project management methodology
with an eye toward developing a sound wireless security project plan.You
should have a solid idea of where to start your own wireless security pro-
ject plan and, utilizing the information in this chapter, you should be able
to take it from here.

Introduction
Network security is no longer just a technical issue, it’s a business issue.
It’s no longer just a problem for the IT department to handle, it’s an
organizational problem. In the past, IT security was viewed as an expense,
but slowly, companies are beginning to see it as an investment. It has
evolved from an ad hoc activity to one that is planned using proven
methodologies. Perhaps the most important shift occurring is that organi-
zations are beginning to move from the reactive “security incident
response” mentality to the “organizational resiliency” (thanks to folks at
CERT/CC for that phrase). Companies are facing the stark reality that
security is no longer just something a few geeky guys do in the dark
recesses of the IT department. Corporate executives understand that
while network services have moved more toward “utility” services, secu-
rity has moved toward a more specialized commodity that involves the
entire organization.
Operational security is sometimes overlooked or put together in a
patchwork fashion.That’s unfortunate because all the hard work that
went into your IT security projects is pretty much wasted if you don’t
develop on-going operations that support or enhance security.This is
accomplished through your operational security plan. In this chapter,
we’re going to look at ﬁve distinct areas that support security: incident
response, corporate and IT policies related to security; disaster recovery
(whether a hurricane or a network intrusion), regulatory issues, and con-
ﬁguration management.These are not the most exciting topics to techies,
which is probably why they’re often neglected. If this topic bores you to
tears, ﬁnd someone on your team who loves policies and procedures and
get him or her ﬁred up about this project then hand it over. Whatever
you do, don’t squander a great opportunity to tighten up security on the
front and back end of your technology initiatives.

Chapter 13 • IT Operational Security Plan

Operational Security Assessment
As with all security initiatives, it’s wise to begin with an assessment of
your operational security. We’ll continue to use the ﬁve topic areas men-
tioned in the Introduction to guide us through our assessment and our
planning activities:
■
Incident response
■
Security policies
■
Disaster recovery
■
Regulatory compliance
■
Conﬁguration management
The ﬁrst operational area is obvious – what do you do if there is a
security incident? If you don’t have a planned response, you’re likely to
overlook something (or create a bigger problem) in the aftermath of an
attack.You and your team may be scrambling to lock the doors and forget
that the window is wide open. How you respond to incidents can mean
the difference between being down for an hour or a month.
Policies are a part of every organization, whether they’re formal or
informal, written or practiced. It’s important to deﬁne policies that sup-
port security without creating a convoluted tangle of rules and regula-
tions that only serve to confuse users. Confused users are dangerous users
because rather than try to understand what they should and should not
do, they’ll do whatever they know how to do or whatever is easiest.This
type of user behavior neither supports nor enhances security.
We often think of disaster recovery in the context of natural disasters
such as ﬁres, ﬂoods, earthquakes or hurricanes. However, unnatural disas-
ters include network intrusion, data modiﬁcation, data falsiﬁcation or data
corruption. In these cases, it’s important to have a clear path to recovery.
If you recall from Chapter 1, companies that fail to restore lost data
within 24 hours of an attack or system failure have a 50 percent chance
of going out of business within three years.Those are seriously bad odds,
and they don’t bode well for IT job security either. Having a viable dis-

aster recovery plan in place may not only save your job but it may well
save your company.
Throughout this book, we’ve discussed regulatory issues that impact
your IT security projects. While it’s outside the scope of this book to
cover all of them in detail, we will take a more in-depth look at some of
the issues facing companies in the compliance and regulatory arena so
you can determine next steps for your own organization.
Conﬁguration management, though individually called out, is really
incorporated into a number of different areas. Conﬁguration management
is an important part of maintaining a secure and compliant network envi-
ronment. It should be incorporated into your response team’s security
management and proactive services deﬁnitions; it should be done through
developing policies and procedures for your IT staff’s day-to-day opera-
tions, and it should be done on a consistent basis and incorporated into
disaster recovery plans on a regular basis. Conﬁguration management is a
large topic and might be a large enough issue in your organization to
warrant its own distinct project plan.You can ﬁnd additional information
on conﬁguration management online.A good place to start is:

Incident response
As we step through the assessment activities, we’ll also discuss best prac-
tices so that when you’re ready to develop your operational security pro-
ject plan, you’ll have the information you need to develop a solid
incident response plan. Before we head into the details, let’s take a quick
look at the history of incident response.This will give you a bit of per-
spective and it’s a great (geeky) conversation starter at tech conventions
and high school reunions.
In 1988, an “Internet worm” hit a lot of computers then connected to
the Internet. While 1988 may seem like the Stone Age of the Internet,
that ﬁrst attack disabled a large percentage of those 60,000 computers. In
response to that incident, the Computer Emergency Response Team
(CERT) was formed. CERT was chartered to be a single, trusted point of
contact for computer emergency response data; to act as a clearinghouse
for trusted information. In 1995, according to the CERT website, there
were 171 vulnerabilities reported to CERT. In 2005, there were 5,990
vulnerabilities reported. If the remainder of 2006 tracks with ﬁrst quarter
results, CERT will log over 6,388 reported vulnerabilities. Clearly, we are
on an unfortunate upward trajectory.
Those 60,000 computers connected to the Internet pale in compar-
ison to the some-200 million hosts now estimated to be connected to the
Internet. It’s no surprise, then, that the volume of vulnerabilities reported
has increased signiﬁcantly.Today, there are numerous resources available to
anyone who wants to form a security response team and there are also
various organizations including the Forum of Incident Response and
Security Teams (FIRST) and the TERENA-sponsored TF-CSIRT, a task

force for the collaboration of incident response teams in Europe. If you’re
interested in these topics, visit the CERT site at www.cert.org.
Most organizations don’t plan for incident response until after they’ve
had their ﬁrst incident.This leaves most organizations without even basic
knowledge about their network status, such as:
■
Not knowing if, for how long, or to what degree the network
has been breached
■
Not knowing what information has been stolen, modiﬁed or cor-
rupted by the breach and the criticality/sensitivity of that infor-
mation
■
Not knowing what method(s) the intruder(s) used to gain access
to the network
■
Not knowing how to stop a breach in progress
■
Not knowing who should respond and in what manner 
■
Not knowing who has the authority to respond 
■
Not knowing who to contact regarding the breach (executives,
legal counsel, law enforcement)
These problems are ampliﬁed by companies with ofﬁces in multiple
locations, whether domestic or international. Without a clearly deﬁned
plan in place, you’re putting your company’s future at risk. Many compa-
nies hold mistaken beliefs about forming an incident handling team.The
reasons run the gamut, but here are a few common attitudes that get
some companies in trouble:
■
It’s too intimidating; ignore it and it will go away.
■
Just take care of problems as they arise.
■
Our ﬁrewall keeps us safe.
■
It’s too much money to spend on something as non-strategic as
the network.

Chapter 13 • IT Operational Security Plan

Clearly, being in a state of denial doesn’t ﬁx the problem, so part of
your job is to advocate for the creation and support of an incident
response team.This should be one of the major components of your IT
operational security project plan, so let’s take a look at the details of what
that type of team should do and how to form one.
Company-Wide Incident Response Teams
Most organizations of any size and geographic distribution found them-
selves hastily developing interdepartmental response procedures in the
spring of 1999.As the Melissa virus knocked out the core communication
medium, the bridge lines went up and calls went out to IT managers of
ofﬁces all over the world. United in a single goal, restoring business as
usual, companies that previously had no formal incident response plan-
ning spontaneously created a corporate incident response team. Most of
the development of formal incident response teams came about as a solu-
tion to problems they had faced in managing their response to the most
recent issue.
The biggest obstacle in the opening hours of March 26, 1999, was the
rapid loss of e-mail communication. Initial responses by most messaging
groups upon detecting the virus was to shut down Internet mail gate-
ways, leaving internal message transfer agents enabled. However, it quickly
became clear that having already entered the internal network and
hijacking distribution lists, it was necessary to bring down e-mail entirely.
Unfortunately, security administrators were no different than any other
users, and relied almost entirely on their e-mail clients’ address books for
locating contact information for company personnel. With the corporate
messaging servers down, initial contact had to be performed through
contact spidering, or simply waiting for the phone to ring at the corpo-
rate help desk.
There was a common thread in companies that had difﬁculty getting
back online, even after having gotten all the necessary representatives on a
conference call. In most of these organizations, despite having all the right
contacts available, there was still contention over responsibilities. In some
cases, IT teams from remote organizations were reluctant to take the nec-
www.syngress.com
IT Operational Security Plan • Chapter 13
523

essary steps to secure their environments, insisting that the central IT
group should be responsible for managing matters pertaining to organiza-
tional security. In other cases, the messaging group refused to bring up
remote sites until those sites could provide documentation showing that all
desktops at the site had been updated with the latest anti-virus software.
Clearly, when no one is in charge and no plan is in place, chaos reigns.
Each member of an incident response team should have a clearly
deﬁned circle of responsibility.These circles should be directly related to
the member’s position in an organizational chart, with the relevant cor-
porate hierarchies providing the incident response team’s chain of com-
mand.At the top of the chart, where an organizational diagram would
reﬂect corporate headquarters, sits the CIO, CSO, or Director of
Information Security.The chart should continue down in a multi-tier
format, with remote ofﬁces at the bottom of the chart. For example, the
team member from corporate IT who acts as liaison to the distributed
retail locations would be responsible for ensuring that the proper steps are
being taken at each of the retail locations.
It is important to keep in mind that incident response could require
the skills of any of four different specialties: networking, messaging, desktop,
and server support.At each of the upper levels of the hierarchy there
should be representatives, preferably subject matter experts, in each spe-
cialty. By ensuring that each of these specialties is properly represented on
a response team, you should be prepared to deal with any emergency, no
matter what aspect of your infrastructure is initially impacted.
Once the team is developed, you have to ﬁnd a way to maintain the
team.At one company, the Director of Information Security instituted a
plan to run a ﬁre drill twice a year, setting off an alarm and seeing how
long it took for all the core team members to join the call.After the call,
each of the primary contacts was asked to submit updated contact sheets,
since the ﬁre drill frequently identiﬁed personnel changes that would
have otherwise gone unnoticed.Another company decided to dual-pur-
pose the organizational incident response team as an information security
steering committee. Quarterly meetings were held at corporate headquar-
ters and video conferencing was used to allow remote locations to join
www.syngress.com
524
Chapter 13 • IT Operational Security Plan

in.At each meeting, roundtable discussions were held to review the status
of various projects and identify any issues that team members were con-
cerned about.To keep the meeting interesting, vendors or industry pro-
fessionals were invited to give presentations on various topics. By
developing and maintaining an incident response team in this way, your
organization will be able to take advantage of the best talents and ideas of
your entire organization, both during emergencies and normal day-to-day
operations. Properly developed and maintained, this team can save your
organization both time and money when the next worst-case scenario
ﬁnds its way into your environment.
Response Team Services
Although we used the term “incident response” in the section heading,
we really should use a broader term, incident handling, to indicate what the
plan should incorporate. We’ll also use the term “operational response
team” or “response team” (RT) just so we don’t step on any toes (some
response team names are trademarked).The response team should be a
part of the IT team, but it should also include other key stakeholders such
as corporate executives, facilities and operations management and others
needed to handle security incidents. Figure 13.1 provides a general list of
services a response team can provide to an organization.

Security Management
www.syngress.com

Security management includes performing a risk analysis, which is part of
the IT security projects we’ve discussed throughout this book.Trend anal-
ysis can also be part of the security management services.Trend analysis
involves looking at network data and analyzing it to search for patterns
that occur over time.There’s an excellent resource available on trend anal-
ysis called Models of Information Security Trend Analysis by Tim Shimeall,
Ph.D. and Phil Williams, Ph.D. from CERT Analysis Center, Software
Engineering Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Penn. It
can be found at www.cert.org/archive/pdf/info-security.pdf and is a great
reference if you’re interested in learning more about the intricacies of
trend analysis in the IT security arena. Clearly, someone needs to look at
security-related data in log ﬁles and elsewhere and try to decipher normal
patterns from abnormal patterns that might indicate a problem in
progress.Trend analysis might also be part of artifact handling when
looking at the trail left by a breach. Disaster planning, which we’ll discuss
later in this chapter, is another management service the RT can provide.
User education is an often overlooked function and assigning this to the
RT can keep their skills up-to-date and can provide an extremely useful
link back into the user community. In concert with education and aware-
ness, the RT team can provide security training or train-the-trainer pro-
grams to ensure that security education is replicated across the enterprise
in an effective and efﬁcient manner. User awareness is a critical compo-
nent of overall network security, and providing consistent, helpful infor-
mation to users can increase awareness and compliance with security
policies and procedures. Finally, the RT can assist in evaluating products
for the network.The team might evaluate the security features of a new
application or the features of a new security product and how, or even if,
it might ﬁt into your overall security strategy.
Proactive services include warnings and alerts about threats and vulnera-
bilities that exist.This is particularly helpful as part of user awareness and
education. If users know that a new phishing scam is asking for user-
names and passwords, for example, the RT can alert users and help avoid
incidents.Threat communication can include technical information being
communicated to executives or IT staff.You can task your RT with
www.syngress.com
526
Chapter 13 • IT Operational Security Plan

alerting your IT staff to new or developing threats along with recom-
mendations on how to avoid or address vulnerabilities related to these
threats.The team may also be involved with conﬁguring and maintaining
security solutions the company is implementing. Conﬁguration manage-
ment is an on-going security process that should be incorporated into the
mission of the RT or should be speciﬁcally assigned to a senior IT staff
member (or team). Conﬁguration management (CM) ensures that net-
work components are and continue to be properly conﬁgured to main-
tain security.After your security project teams have completed their
work, the maintenance of the network conﬁguration should be clearly
delegated to an individual or team. In many organizations, this is a subset
of the RT.An in-depth look at conﬁguration management is outside the
scope of this book, but there are numerous online resources at your dis-
posal to learn more about conﬁguration management and associated soft-
ware tools you can utilize to assist in your CM processes.The team may
be tasked with staying up to date on these systems so they provide the
subject matter expertise needed to manage these security solutions at
optimal levels for your organization.
Reactive services are, of course, the ones you hope you’ll never need.
Should your organization have the need for an incident response, a rapid
deployment of your RT can make all the difference between a ‘simple’
intrusion and a devastating breach.The reactive services provided by the
RT can include warnings and alerts about threats or intrusions that
appear to be occurring (during initial assessment) or that actually are
occurring (initial response).They can handle vulnerabilities including
analysis, response and coordination. When vendors or other industry
experts announce newly discovered vulnerabilities, you need a team that
can rapidly assess the organization’s exposure and respond with recom-
mendations, procedures, patches or monitoring services to address the
speciﬁc vulnerability. If an incident does occur, they are typically the ﬁrst
responders who will analyze the problem, coordinate efforts across the
enterprise to respond to the problem and provide response services on
site, if that’s the stated function of the team. In some companies, an RT
deploys to the various company locations to coordinate incident response.
www.syngress.com
IT Operational Security Plan • Chapter 13
527

In other companies, the RT is centrally located and provides e-mail and
phone support to widely-dispersed IT resources domestically or interna-
tionally. Finally, the reactive services include handling what are commonly
called “artifacts” in the computer forensics ﬁeld. It’s estimated that over 85
percent of all cybercrimes leave an electronic trail, or an electronic artifact.
The term artifact is usually used to connote “of human craft or inven-
tion,” so artifacts of cybercrimes are those electronic trails or footprints
left by the intruder.The RT should be trained in ﬁnding, analyzing and
responding to the artifacts found in the wake of an intrusion attempt or a
breach.

Computer Security Incident Response Teams
Computer security incident response teams, or CSIRTS, are teams that
not only respond to computer security problems; they should be proac-
tively involved with helping your company avoid computer security
threats. There are numerous books, articles, white papers and Websites
that provide speciﬁc guidance on forming and managing a response
team. Our goal in this chapter is not to provide you with a step-by-step
guide for forming a team, but in assessing your response capabilities, we
will cover the basics of an RT. If you’d like more information on forming
a world-class incident response team, check out these websites for

Response Team Assessment
We’ve brieﬂy covered response team services, so let’s turn our attention
now to your RT assessment.You’ll need to take a look at a number of
factors as you look at your company’s need for a response team. If you
already have a team in place, you need to assess the services provided by
the team and whether or not the team is covering all the bases. We’ve
continually talked about the three primary components of all security
plans: people, process and technology.A response team interacts with all
three of these elements in a variety of ways. We know that IT security
comes about as a result of a multi-layer defense strategy that includes:
■
Keeping operating systems and applications patched and up to
date (technology and process).
■
Installing, maintaining and monitoring perimeter defenses (tech-
nology and process).
■
Reviewing, revising and publishing security policies and proce-
dures (people and process).
■
Providing security awareness training to users (people and process).
■
Managing incidents (people, process and technology).
Using the model we developed earlier, let’s look at your response
team’s capabilities.There is clearly some overlap in these areas with secu-
rity activities we’ve discussed in other chapters.
Security Management Services
Risk analysis, disaster planning, user awareness, training and product eval-
uation all fall under security management services. We’ve already dis-
cussed risk analysis and risk assessment elsewhere in this book, but this is
certainly an area that can be part of the RT’s mission, either as part of
your corporate IT security initiative or as part of the on-going operations
after the security initiative is complete. Security is not a one-shot deal, so
you will need to have a team dedicated to on-going security assessment,
analysis and planning.
www.syngress.com
IT Operational Security Plan • Chapter 13
529

Risk Analysis
We’ve covered risk analysis and assessment throughout this book, so you
should have a clear understanding of what skills are required to perform a
thorough risk analysis. If your RT doesn’t have the skills needed to conﬁ-
dently perform a risk analysis, you have one of two viable options.The
ﬁrst is to send one or more of your IT staff to intensive training to
upgrade and update their skills so they can perform a comprehensive risk
analysis. If you don’t have staff on board that you believe is capable of
this, you might need to look at hiring an outside consultant to perform
your risk assessment and analysis for you. However, in the long term, you
will need this capability on your team, so you should look both near- and
long-term at your options.
Trend Analysis
The CERT document referred to earlier on trend analysis provides an
excellent explanation of how trend analysis can help improve network
security.Authors Shimeall  and Williams state,“In the area of information
security, enhanced understanding of trends, patterns, and anomalies could
contribute signiﬁcantly to indicators and warning processes that are a key
component of efforts to anticipate, thwart, or mitigate intrusions. It is pos-
sible, for example, to extrapolate trends so that defenders have at least some
expectation about broad developments that might occur.While this is not
foolproof by any means, it can provide some basis for anticipation and
lessen surprises.”Trend analysis should be part of your response team’s secu-
rity management services so that it can potentially anticipate and monitor
troublesome trends and avoid being caught completely off-guard.
Disaster Planning
Disaster planning is part of the security services an RT can provide.The
RT can develop a thorough disaster plan that should be part of a larger
business continuity planning initiative for your company. If disaster were to
strike, how would your company continue daily operations? The answer
clearly goes far beyond the functionality of the network and the avail-
www.syngress.com
530
Chapter 13 • IT Operational Security Plan

ability of databases and websites. If possible, avoid taking responsibility for
the entire business continuity planning process since IT is just one piece of
the puzzle.A business continuity project should be headed up or at least
sponsored by a senior level executive, and a business continuity planning
project should involve stakeholders from every part of your company —
facilities management to operations, ﬁnance, HR and IT, to name a few.
Disaster planning from a business perspective includes how IT services will
be re-established after a disaster. Disaster planning from an IT perspective
involves how network services will be restored after a disaster occurs,
including natural disasters and network security breaches.
Your assessment should look at your RT’s capabilities with regard to
disaster planning including the existing disaster plan, the ability to manage
and implement a disaster plan after a disaster strikes. We’ll cover this in
more detail later in this chapter.
Education and Awareness
Although adequately managing your network borders can help to prevent
a substantial portion of the external threats to your environment, there
are always going to be access points that you simply cannot control. Users
who bring their laptops home with them can easily provide a roaming
target for autonomous threats such as worms,Trojan horses, and other
applications that are forbidden by corporate policy.A software update
from a vendor might inadvertently contain the next Code Red, as of yet
undetected in an inactive state, waiting for a certain date six months in
the future. No matter how locked down your network and perimeter
may be, there will always be risks and vulnerabilities that must be
addressed. Raising user awareness about security threats, risks and vulner-
abilities and educating them about how to avoid or reduce these risks is
as important as locking down your borders. Developing effective aware-
ness campaigns should be part of the security management responsibilities
of your RT team.A review of educational and awareness activities is part
of your RT assessment.Awareness campaigns include awareness of secu-
rity threats, security best practices as well as awareness of corporate secu-
rity policies. We’ll discuss creating security policies later in this chapter,
www.syngress.com
IT Operational Security Plan • Chapter 13
531

and the awareness techniques we discuss here also apply to policies you
and your team develop to address on-going security practices.
Developing Effective Awareness Campaigns
In order to get the attention of the user base, you’ll need to provide
incentive to the managers of those groups to help IT get the word out
about how to recognize and respond to potential security threats. In order
to involve the company’s managers in IT security, RT leaders have to
make the tasks as simple as possible. When the guidelines are clear and
concise and leave no room for interpretation, your chances of main-
taining security are much higher.There are many examples of fairly
straightforward tasks that can be assigned to managers. For example, the
enforcement of acceptable-use policies is one of the most common ways
to involve management in information security (though the detection of
violations is and probably always will be an IT responsibility).
Company-wide awareness campaigns also leave room for engaging
management in your information security posture.Although the IT staff
can do a lot to protect users from inadvertently causing harm to the com-
pany by implementing technology-based safeguards, in many cases, the
users are still the last line of defense. If we could magically teach users to
never leave their workstations unsecured and to recognize and delete suspi-
cious e-mail, a considerable portion of major security incidents would
never come to fruition. Let’s look at three common approaches to dissemi-
nating security awareness materials.You can assess whether your RT is
taking appropriate measures, given your corporate culture and network
structure, to raise and maintain user awareness about IT security through:
■
Centralized corporate IT department
■
Distributed department campaigning
■
Enforcement
Creating Awareness via a Centralized Corporate IT Department
Using this approach, corporate IT assumes responsibility for developing
and distributing security awareness campaigns.The problem with this
www.syngress.com
532
Chapter 13 • IT Operational Security Plan

approach is that there is an inherent conﬂict of interest here.Your IT staff
is tasked with keeping the network up and running and at the same time,
they are asked to lock down the network to keep it secure. Government
best practices (National Security Agency, for example) suggest you keep
these two functions completely separate.This is not always possible in
small organizations, but if you can separate these out, you’ll probably have
better results.Your organization may already have produced mouse pads,
buttons, or posters that include the help-desk telephone number and
instructions to contact this number for any computer issues. Sometimes,
this task is handed to the messaging group, and periodic company wide
e-mails are distributed including information on what to do if you have
computer issues.
Depending on the creative forces behind the campaign, this method
can have varying results.Typically, such help-desk awareness promotions
are fairly passive in nature. When a user has a problem, he or she looks up
the help desk e-mail address or phone number or search for the most
recent e-mail to ﬁnd the number of the help-desk. Communications
received from corporate IT are often given the same attention as spam—a
cursory glance before moving on to the next e-mail. Part of the reason
for this is the nature of the e-mail – many users assume it will be too
technical to understand. Let’s face it, IT departments are not known for
their effective communications styles with users. (If your department
excels in this area, you’re among the elite).
Even plastering ofﬁces with posters or mouse pads can be overlooked;
people can become immune to any kind of mass communication today.
After all, they’ve learned to look past banner ads, ignore billboards, mute
the TV during commercials and skip entire pages in the newspaper.There
are numerous methods of effectively communicating with your user base.
You can use humor, rewards and awards (some people might consider this
a form of corporate bribery, but if it works, it may cost far less than
recovering from a security breach) to get users to pay attention. Look for
ways to be creatively entertaining.Ask users to submit humorous IT-
related anecdotes and include them in your e-mail distribution. Give
small awards to those who submit the selected story. Include a little
www.syngress.com
IT Operational Security Plan • Chapter 13
533

known fact or an amusing quote – anything to get users to actually read
IT e-mail on security. Be sure to make the e-mail readable – leave out
jargon and complicated explanations and just make it clear, concise and
engaging. If you don’t have someone on the RT team that can craft this
kind of message, collaborate with your internal communications or PR
department for some assistance. In the end, the most challenging obstacle
in centralized awareness campaigns is actually getting the attention of the
user to ensure the information is read, absorbed and retained.
Creating Awareness via a Distributed Departmental Campaign
In some highly compartmentalized organizations, it may be beneﬁcial to
distribute the responsibility for security awareness to individual depart-
ments.This approach is useful in that it allows the department to ﬁne-
tune the messages to be relayed to the users in a manner more aligned
with the users in that area. For example, if global messages are deployed
that focus heavily on preventing data theft or inadvertent release of pro-
prietary documents, some staff may perceive these e-mails to be irrelevant
to them. If they believe the information does not apply to them, they will
disregard the e-mail and the information contained within. If a local
department is tasked with delivering certain messages, the RT team can
work with departments by providing the message and allowing (or
requesting) department to tune the message to their department.The
upside to this is that the message might be delivered in a manner more
appealing to the targeted users.The downside is that your RT will have
to be conﬁdent that the departments are actually distributing the message.
It certainly doesn’t help if your organization has pockets of security and
pockets of happy-go-lucky ignorant users because their department never
passed the message along. If the responsibility is delegated and never exe-
cuted, you are in a worse position than if you’d used a centralized IT
method of disseminating this information.
In many cases, departmental assistance supplements the centralized
security campaign. Issues that can impact users regardless of department
are left to IT to manage; more speciﬁc concerns such as data privacy and
integrity can sometimes be delegated to the organizational groups that
www.syngress.com
534
Chapter 13 • IT Operational Security Plan

require specialized security.The problem is often that departments don’t
know what to ask and IT doesn’t advise.The communication gap at this
point becomes the security breach.The response team’s charter might
include communicating with departmental representatives to identify
security needs unique to those areas.This removes the circular problem
that often accompanies user security issues – the users don’t know the
right questions to ask and the IT staff doesn’t know what the users need.
The development of such programs will vary greatly from one organi-
zation to the next, but as with any interdepartmental initiative, the ﬁrst task
is to enlist the help of the senior management of your department. Once
you convince them of the potential beneﬁts of distributing the load of user
education, they should be more willing to help you craft a project plan,
identify the departments most in need of such programs, and facilitate the
interdepartmental communication to get the program off the ground.

USB Sure Is Handy, but Consumer 
Keys Are Creating a Huge Security Headache  
USB makes it extremely convenient for employees to transfer data to
portable devices, whether it’s for work at home or more sinister pur-
poses. It’s not easy to deal with the security headaches this practice cre-
ates, but tools are now emerging that allow administrators to know
which external devices have been connected to the network, and which
ﬁles were written to them. Typically this is accomplished with software
agents that allow network managers to centrally control USB devices.
One approach is to enable the use of company-issued USB drives, while
rejecting others. Both SanDisk and Sony have created USB devices that
use biometric (ﬁngerprint) technology to secure both a computer
(desktop or laptop) and the USB device itself.

Creating Awareness via Enforcement
In a pure enforcement awareness campaign, you count on feedback from
automated defense systems to provide awareness back to your user base.A
prime example is a content ﬁlter scheme that responds to forbidden
requests with a customized message designed not only to inform the user
that their request has been denied, but also to remind the user that when
using corporate resources, their activity is subject to scrutiny.This
approach can be quite effective, but there is the potential for this method
to backﬁre.
In many organizations, IT is viewed in any one of several potentially
negative ways.The “Enforcer” image usually doesn’t foster good will and
cooperation between IT and users. If IT takes on an adversarial role, the
users are not likely to willingly comply with IT requests or mandates
unless they have no other option. In any kind of management relation-
ship, developing the desire to cooperate is always more effective than
forcing someone to do so. If users have a dislike or mistrust of the IT
department or the RT, they’re likely to ignore a virus warning or fail to
notify IT of a strange dialog box that popped up after they clicked on a
link in an e-mail.
There is an element of psychology involved in designing awareness
campaigns.Your task is to provide a balance — effectively conveying what
users can do to help minimize the various risks to an organization,
reminding them of their responsibilities as a corporate network user, and
encouraging them to ask for help when they need it.The threat of reper-
cussions should be saved for the most egregious offenders; if a user has
reached the point where he or she needs stronger action, it’s probably
time to recommend disciplinary action anyway. We’ll discuss policies and
procedures that will help reinforce (and require) appropriate security pro-
cedures later in this chapter. Reminding users of these policies and proce-
dures through awareness campaigns can be helpful since most users glance
at policies and procedures during their new hire orientation and never
look at them again. Keeping them in front of users in a friendly, useful
www.syngress.com

manner can raise security levels signiﬁcantly.This job falls to the RT in
many companies, assuming a company has a response team.
Make certain that users are aware of what they can do to help protect
company resources. If a user in your organization suspected that they
might have just released a virus, what should they do? Do they know
who to call? More importantly, would they be afraid to call? Your RT’s
job is to make sure users are aware of their roles and responsibilities in
maintaining network security.
Policies
Your IT operations security project plan should include a review of your
company’s current security policy environment. Once you’ve completed
your review or assessment, you’ll need to create a project plan to revise
the corporate security policies to help support and enhance network
security after your project work is complete. In this section, we’ll break
down the process into several deﬁned steps, each of which help you to
create, review, and enforce the policies you need to secure your corporate
network.As we’ve discussed, current technology can be used to create a
secure infrastructure, but good policies are necessary to maintain it.
Security policies are usually seen as necessary to gain compliance with
some higher authority, not as a needed function in network operations.
They are often overlooked and undervalued until they are really needed.
People, unlike computers, don’t follow instructions exactly as told.They
have choices, and their choices can put cracks in the security walls. Based
on research conducted in 2002, about 78 percent of internally caused
security breaches were due to inadequate security policies or users disre-
garding those policies.The question is: Why weren’t security policies put
in place if they could have helped to prevent some of these incidents?
Part of the answer is that companies may not be aware of just how much
security policies can bolster network security.

Founding Principles of a Good Security Policy
A security policy will not solve all your misconﬁguration and personnel
problems, but it will provide a piece of the puzzle that no other compo-
nent can provide: structure. Clearly, the goal of information security is to
maintain information conﬁdentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA).
Security policies are one of the few security tools that help us guard
against unknown, unforeseen, future attacks. Policies deﬁne what actions
need to be taken to maintain secure networks, such as removing inactive
users, monitoring ﬁrewall activity, and maintaining current, standard
server builds. However, proper policies are also not the silver bullet.
Policies that are not reviewed, updated, circulated, or enforced will
become outdated and ineffectual.
Security policy is one area where management support is critical.
Because security policies deal much more with the day-to-day actions of
employees, and changes in policy should ideally result in changes in pro-
cedures, it is important that security implementers have the backing of
management. Effecting procedural change in a corporation where
employees are set in their ways can be very difﬁcult, and requires much
effort. Before you make an effort to implement any policies, make certain
you have speciﬁc commitments from management as to their role in your
initiative, and the support they will provide.
Security policies should be clear and concise. We’ve all read policies
that sounded like the attorneys had spent three months on it. While there
may be some required “legal language” in security policies, the general
rule is that they should speak directly to the target audience and provide
meaningful information.There are a number of best practices for writing
policies; we’ve included some of them here as a guide for your policy
review. Remember, your review of policies should include not only the
actual impact of the policy (the do’s and don’ts) but the clarity and con-
sistency of the language. If one policy talks about hosts (which, by the
way, is something most users don’t understand) and another discusses
desktop computers, users may be confused. Review your policies for con-

tent and style (this is one place where style actually does count). Here are
some best practices to consider:
1. Consider the reader.
2. Use consistent naming conventions.
3. Use an easy-to-read writing style.
4. Keep documents current.
5. Balance protection and productivity.
6. Designate policy ownership.
Understanding Current Policy Standards
There are numerous policy standards you can use as reference points for
developing your security standards. We’ll discuss a few of them here and
you can follow up with some independent research to ﬁnd out what
might be most appropriate for your organization.
ISO 17799
One of the most widely accepted and endorsed security policy guidelines
in use is the International Organization for Standardization (ISO)
17799:2000.This document was originally the British Standard (BS)
7799, and was submitted to the ISO in late 2000.
There has been some confusion over the ISO 17799 in that you
cannot become certiﬁed as ISO17799-compliant. When the BS 7799 was
originally submitted, BSI declined to include BS 7799-2 for approval,
which is a checklist of controls that a company can be audited against.
The ISO 17799 is not appropriate to be certiﬁed against, and therefore,
the ISO has not offered a certiﬁcation through its registrars. However, if
your company has a desire to be certiﬁed against the BS 7799-2, which is
the closest certiﬁcation available, you can get more information at BSI’s
homepage, www.bsi.com.
The ISO17799 can be purchased from BSI for under $200, and it is a
worthwhile investment.Though not perfect, it is one of the best we have,
and one of the most widely referred-to security documents. It appears to

have good traction and is gaining ground, both in the American and
international communities, as a solid security standard.
Business Intelligence…
ISO 17799 – Security Management Guidelines
You may be familiar with the International Organization for
Standardization (ISO). In 2005, they released a speciﬁcation, ISO/IEC
17799:2005, which establishes guidelines and general principles for ini-
tiating, implementing, maintaining, and improving information security
management in an organization. According to the website
(www.iso.org), “the objectives outlined provide general guidance on the
commonly-accepted goals of information security management. ISO/IEC
17799:2005 contains best practices of control objectives and controls in
the following areas of information security management:
■Security policy
■Organization of information security
■Asset management
■Human resources security
■Physical and environmental security
■Communications and operations management
■Access control
■Information systems acquisition, development and mainte-
nance
■Information security incident management
■Business continuity management
■Compliance
The control objectives and controls in ISO/IEC 17799:2005 are
intended to be implemented to meet the requirements identiﬁed by a
risk assessment. ISO/IEC 17799:2005 is intended as a common basis and
practical guideline for developing organizational security standards and
effective security management practices, and to help build conﬁdence in
inter-organizational activities.”

SAS70
The Statement on Auditing Standards (SAS) No. 70, Service
Organizations, is a tool available to auditing ﬁrms and CPAs to conduct
an audit of a company that already has implemented an information secu-
rity program.The SAS70 does not contain a checklist of security con-
trols, but rather allows an auditing ﬁrm to issue a statement of how well a
company is adhering to their stated information security policy.
If you have already implemented a security policy based on a stan-
dard, such as the ISO 17799, the SAS70 may give your information secu-
rity program additional credibility. Having more accreditation groups
stating that your program gets a “pass” grade doesn’t necessarily mean you
have a more secure program. However, it can help to make customers
happy or meet federal or insurance requirements. Remember that the
SAS70 is not appropriate for use as a checklist to create an information
security policy.
There are three other sets of guidelines that might be of interest to
you.They are:
■
Control Objectives for Information and (Related)
Technology (CobiT) A free set of guidelines for information
security published by the Information Systems Audit and Control
Association (ISACA).
■
ISO 15408/Common Criteria  A technical standard published
by the ISO used to support the speciﬁcation and technical evalu-
ation of IT security features in products.
■
Government Information Security Reform Act (GISRA)
Requires civilian Federal Agencies to examine the adequacy of
their information security policies, among other requirements.

Guard Against the Unknown
Imagine if you were able to stop attacks before they started. Imagine if
you were able to patch vulnerabilities before they are discovered. Sound
impossible? Perhaps not.
If you implement proper information security policies and proce-
dures, you may be able to prevent attacks before they even start. For
example, if your policies require you to follow the principle of defense-
in-depth, and you have a properly implemented security perimeter
around your entire network, you are less likely to suffer an impact from
a failure in one component of your network. Another example: If you
have proper personnel policies and procedures implemented, such as
performing background checks on employees, removing old user
accounts held by former employees, and evaluating the threat potential
of current employees, you may be less likely to suffer an attack from an
insider. With the proper personnel controls in place, you may be able to
recognize and mitigate threats from a potentially subversive employee
before they take action. You may even be able to recognize them as a
threat before they get any ideas and address the problem before it
starts.
Creating Corporate Security Policies
Let’s begin by stating something obvious, but something easily over-
looked. Policies include the written policies in your employee handbook
and they also include computer-related methods of managing network
security. Both types of policies interact, but they are managed in two dis-
tinctly different ways.A written policy can be developed from a software
program, replicated throughout the organization and enforced through
monitoring user behaviors.A computer policy is developed on the com-
puter, replicated throughout the organization and enforced using hard-
ware and software tools. In this section, we’ll discuss both kinds of
policies. Let’s begin with “written” policies.
www.syngress.com
542
Chapter 13 • IT Operational Security Plan

First, gather all existing corporate policies that pertain in any way to
computer or network security or to security, in general.You want to
include general security policies because some may tangentially relate to
network security such as policies regarding visitor access or after-hours
access to the premises.These kinds of policies clearly impact the overall
security of the network and should be included in your scope.The scope
for policy review and revision should be “policies that directly or indi-
rectly impact the security of the network, the conﬁdentiality, integrity
and availability of the data on the network and the users who use the
network.” While that’s a broad statement, you should start broad and
narrow it down later, if needed.
Almost all procedures require technical insight into some area, and
many procedures should not be developed without input from experts in
those areas. Even areas such as physical security require insight into phys-
ical authentication routines, biometrics, and networking and power con-
siderations for physical setting of systems. On the other hand, an exclusive
focus on the technical elements may miss some of the people-side issues,
which is why you want to have a wide representation of stakeholders par-
ticipate in these policy review and revision tasks. Figure 13.2 provides a
framework, based on the NSA model, of how security policies and proce-
dures should be laid out.

Once you’ve identiﬁed all existing corporate policies that fall within
your stated scope, you should categorize them if they are not already cat-
egorized.There are numerous resources you can use in creating policies,
and if you plan on using a resource (book, manual or software program),
you may want to utilize the categories provided. Remember, you may
have written computer policies that address these areas. Using the model
provided in Figure 13.2, we would say that our written policies fall into
the “User Documentation” category and our computer policies fall into
the “System Security Plans” category. For example, your written e-mail
policy might state that users are not to click on links provided in e-mails
from unknown sources.Your computer e-mail policy might prevent users
from downloading images in e-mails automatically. Both are e-mail poli-
cies; both are implemented in different ways for the same intended effect
– network security. We’ve included a list for your reference, and while it
doesn’t cover every possible topic, it’s pretty extensive.

Chapter 13 • IT Operational Security Plan

Microsoft Word formatted document or Adobe PDF formatted ﬁles.
These are templates you can use by inserting your company’s name in
them, so they can be very helpful.You can also review the various secu-
rity checklists provided by the National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST) and review the policies required to address all of
these various security areas.The checklists can be found at
http://csrc.nist.gov/pcig/cig.html.
However, there are four things to keep in mind when using templates.
1. Templates are one-size-ﬁts-all and may not be right for your com-
pany.You may need to edit them or revise them pretty signiﬁ-
cantly to make them ﬁt your situation, so don’t just do the old
“cut-and-paste” and hope for the best. Review, revise and edit
until the policy ﬁts your environment.
2. If you do use templates, be sure that they ﬁt your organization’s
overall tone and approach and that the resulting policies are clear,
concise and user-friendly.
3. Be sure that you have the legal right to use the material.You
don’t want to inadvertently use copyrighted or protected material
inappropriately. Most templates indicate how and when they can
be legally used and they usually include internal use, but you
couldn’t sell the templates as your own, for example. Be sure
you’re in the clear when using templates or language from other
sources.
4. Check the ﬁnal draft with your Human Resources department,
your executive team and your legal counsel before ﬁnalizing and
releasing them.There may be issues about which your team is not
aware that should be incorporated into your policies, especially if
you use templates that originate outside your organization.
Your policy team should include representatives from legal, human
resources, management and IT staff.The security policies should include
or address these high level issues:

■

These documents are necessary for the proper implementation and
enforcement of policy after delivery of your overall security plan and
your RT may be the team responsible for these activities. One thing
should be clear is that these activities should be someone’s responsibility,
and it should be clearly stated in the job description so that one person is
the primary owner of these activities. Otherwise, you risk having no one
in charge and that’s a sure recipe for failure.
Policy development, like IT security management, is a process. It con-
tains a series of steps that takes the user towards a goal, and no single ﬁx
can solve all problems.The following is a process that draws from multiple
resources to help security managers develop their policy:
1. Justiﬁcation Formalize a justiﬁcation for the creation of your
security policy.This usually comes from a management directive,
hopefully from the Board of Directors.This is your ticket to
www.syngress.com
546
Chapter 13 • IT Operational Security Plan

create what you need to get your job done. Make certain you
have a way to check back with the Board or executive team
should it be necessary to get organizational support to complete
the task.
2. Scope Clearly deﬁne the scope of your document — who is
covered under your policy and who isn’t. Does this apply to all
users, to mobile users, or just to Help Desk staff? Does this apply
to data centers, to remote ofﬁces or to all locations? Does this
policy apply to company employees and contractors as well as
external vendors? Be as clear and exact here as possible because as
with any scope statement, this deﬁnes the boundaries. It might
also be helpful to deﬁne what or who a policy does not cover. If
this applies to data centers but not to vendors’ data centers, state
that clearly. Some topics useful in deﬁning scope are:
■
Data centers
■
Subsidiaries
■
Customer call centers
■
Satellite ofﬁces
■
Business partners
■
Professional relationships
■
Clients
■
Suppliers
■
Employees, contractors and vendor staff
■
Salaried versus hourly employees
■
Executive versus non-executive staff
■
IT security staff or management versus IT operational staff

3. Outline Compose a rough outline of all the areas you need
your policy to cover. If you start here, you’ll be able to ﬁll in the
blanks as you ﬁnd sample policies, omit redundancies, and create
controls to enforce your policies.
4. Management support Management support is different from
justiﬁcation. Justiﬁcation says “we need this done, and this is
why.” Management support says “I will help you get this done.”
This usually comes in the form of support from VPs for smaller
organizations, or department managers for larger organizations.
Having the support of the Board behind you can make this task
much easier.
5. Areas of responsibility This is related to the initial scoping
you performed, but on a more detailed level. By now you have
identiﬁed the general areas where you will be responsible for cre-
ating a security policy. For example, in your scoping you may
have deﬁned that your policy will cover data centers that are
directly controlled by your organization, not third parties.You
may also have already contacted the manager for the data center
and informed them that you will be creating their security policy.
If physical security is already covered under a corporate physical
security policy, and the data center follows these policies, it may
not be necessary to create a second, redundant physical security
policy. However, you certainly could integrate the current phys-
ical security policy into your document, and include any modiﬁ-
cations if necessary, so long as you have permission of the physical
security policy coordinator.
6. Implementation and Enforcement Once the policy is
written, the easy part is over. Distributing it to the rest of your
organization, and ensuring it is read and followed, is the hard
part.This is one of the most critical steps in developing your
policy program.This is where all your work culminates in getting
results and is one of the most important reasons to have manage-
ment support. If you have managed your program properly, there
www.syngress.com
548
Chapter 13 • IT Operational Security Plan

are many managers, plus the Board, that have supported you in
your policy development process. Hopefully you have maintained
good relationships with all of them, and they are anticipating the
ﬁnal result of your work. If you write your policies correctly, they
will not be an additional burden on your users and there will be
less resistance.
7. Review Once you have developed and deployed your policy,
your job is not yet ﬁnished. Changes in regulations, environment,
business strategy, structure, or organization, personnel, and tech-
nology can all affect the way your policy is interpreted and
implemented. Remember that policies should be living docu-
ments and the responsibility for maintaining these policies can be
delegated to your RT or to a sub-team whose mission is to
review, revise and maintain security policies.This is especially true
in corporate environments in which you must comply with regu-
latory or legal standards.
There are also a number of free or commercial policy templates, some
of which are listed in this chapter. With the acceptance of the BS 7799 as
the ISO 17799, there is a worldwide standard on which you can base
your policy creation decisions. However, many policies in existence today
were not created using guidelines or templates, but were thrown together
in an ad hoc fashion.This is why a policy review should be conducted as
part of your IT operational security project – to update and revise poli-
cies to create a clear, consistent body of knowledge for the organization.
It’s helpful if all policies related to IT security follow the same basic
format so that users can quickly read and understand the policies.
Creating a template for your policies will make the job of creating poli-
cies easier, as well. We’ve listed the headings that are typically found in
security policies, and you can use these to craft your own template.These
are based on best practices, and you can select the sections that make
sense for your organization.

Tools
There are a variety of tools available that can help you write your infor-
mation security policies.These are useful if the policy administrator does
not have the time or resources to create an information security docu-
ment. However, be careful to not place too much trust in the prewritten
policies. No policies should be created and deployed if they haven’t been
reviewed for consistency and checked for conﬂicts with corporate or
government regulations.
Charles Woods has developed a well-regarded compilation of security
policies, especially ones that can help you with compliance issues.You can
learn more about products that help you develop policies and practices
that assist in security and compliance at www.informationshield.com/
index.htm.
Another product that you might ﬁnd useful is PolicyCenter, which
helps the policy administrator to create their policies and distribute, track,
and enforce them. PolicyCenter uses the templates from Wood’s
Information Security Policies Made Easy. For more information, see

NetIQ offerings allow administrators to create, distribute, and enforce
their policies.These features help to create a “living policy” document.

Rewriting Your Policies for a Management System
With the advent of automated security policy management systems, there
are some things you may want to consider when implementing your infor-
mation security policy. Do you want to backtrack and implement part of
your security policy program using an automated tool? Consider the ben-
eﬁts, but also consider the traps. On one hand, you will be able to mon-
itor continuously for compliance with your security policies, checking
everything from patch level to password strength, from access controls to

Continued

intrusion signatures. This can assist you in securing your hosts and net-
work by holding the reigns of policy tight on your network.
However, also consider the switching costs involved once you port
your existing policies to the new management system. This will take
time and resources, and will probably need to be repeated if you
choose to switch to a competing product. In addition, these products
are relatively new and untested and may have their own inherent con-
cerns. Finally, these products cover only a specific set of information
security policy procedural controls and still require the maintenance of
a policy administrator.
Consider the needs of your network and whether you feel you will
beneﬁt from the implementation of such a system. If your corporate cul-
ture or policies require tight maintenance on compliance with policies in
your hosts and networks, either due to heightened threats or govern-
ment regulation, an automated security policy management system may
be appropriate. However, if you think it will add to the security of your
network, but you fail to implement additional policies and controls, you
are probably leaving a gaping hole in your security policy. 
Policy Distribution and Education
Now that we have created our policies, either from templates or tools, we
need to implement and enforce them. No matter how wonderful and
eloquent a policy may be, if it’s not distributed and enforced properly, it is
not worth the paper it is printed on.
First, we have to determine the scope of our recipients. It won’t make
much sense to give our new policies to individuals who don’t need to
read them, and at the same time it would be a mistake if we missed
important personnel.The answer is not to distribute all policies to all
people in a blanket coverage issuance of our new policies. Instead, you
should work with your stakeholders to determine which policies should
be distributed to the various segments of the user population.
By discussing this with stakeholders, you can provide a useful IT per-
spective about security while the stakeholder provides a useful perspective
about the user community. Striking this balance will help ensure the poli-
cies are not only targeted to the right users but that there are no critical
www.syngress.com
552
Chapter 13 • IT Operational Security Plan

gaps.A few overlaps are better than gaps, but a blanket distribution is
almost guaranteed to miss the intended target.
There are numerous creative ways to get users to read and implement
policies and security guidelines.As much as you might like to just send
them out in a long PDF ﬁle or email and then post it on an intranet, that
technique is number one on the top of the list of ineffective ways to pro-
mulgate security policy.
Instead, make the task palatable. Have department managers discuss
policies at staff meetings, post important policies on posters in hallways
and break rooms, include the important information in bite-sized chunks
in newsletters or interesting e-mails or as screensavers or “message of the
day.” When you make the communication quick, easy and relevant to the
intended audience, you’re more likely to get a higher rate of compliance.
Remember, you can simply stand there and be the enforcer, which is
only effective when you’re standing there, or you can gain compliance
through education. It’s how good managers manage. By educating your
audience in interesting and informative ways, you get higher compliance
over a longer term than if you stand there ready to handcuff anyone who
disobeys. Get your Human Resources and Training teams involved with
educating people on the key policies and ﬁnd ways to keep these mes-
sages in front of users in ways that they won’t simply overlook.There are
numerous resources you can use to create awareness programs,
Here are two useful links for help in creating an effective awareness
program:

Maintaining Corporate Security Policies
Policies must be maintained with constant diligence; otherwise, they will
become stale and outdated.The more policies become outdated, the more
difﬁcult it is to bring them, and the company, back into compliance.A
tool has been released by the Human Firewall Council (www.humanﬁre-

wall.org), which allows administrators to evaluate their current security
practices against the ISO 17799. It also provides them with a Security
Management Index, a ranking of their security management against
others in their industry.
As you know, a project is a unique solution to a unique problem, but
a process or procedure is developed in response to an on-going need. In
this case, you’re using a project to develop a process, which is a common
outcome of project work. Develop a process for reviewing security poli-
cies on a periodic basis. If you are subject to compliance or regulatory
requirements, you will absolutely need to have a reliable process in place
for staying up-to-date. If you are not subject to regulatory constraints, you
need to implement a periodic review in order to simply maintain net-
work security. Outdated policies can become a legal liability as much as
having no policy in place, so don’t assume you can create policies once
and be done with it.
If you ﬁnd this entire endeavor to be a bit unappealing (most IT folks
would rather go study DOS commands than deal with policies), ﬁnd
someone on your team that ﬁnds this interesting and challenging. Find
someone who communicates well and (ideally) is a decent writer and ask
them to own the process or the task or to head up the project team.This
is a very important part of overall network security and it should get your
star players, not your also-ran’s. Well-crafted policies delivered in an
appealing and usable format will go much further than any ﬁrewall ever
can. Incorporate solid policy development and management as part of
your overall operational security plan.
Disaster Recovery
Disaster recovery is often considered a key component of business conti-
nuity planning. However, business continuity planning is broader in scope
than disaster planning from an IT perspective.Therefore, it’s important
that your IT disaster recovery plans include other key stakeholders in the
organization. Disaster response planning should be a coordinated effort
among various groups within the company. Disaster planning and business

continuity planning is a big undertaking and will require a concerted
effort on your company’s part to develop a coherent plan.A thorough
discussion of disaster planning is outside the scope of this chapter, so we’ll
just cover the basics here.You and your team will need to do additional
research to determine the speciﬁc elements you’ll need to address for
your company since every company’s disaster and business continuity
plans will be different.The basic elements of such a plan should include:
1. Examine and analyze potential threats and vulnerabilities
2. Assess impact of a disruption to normal services 
1. Alternative business process handling 
2. Customer service backup and recovery 
3. Administration, operations, communications and IT
3. Prepare information about existing systems
4. Review involvement of emergency services
5. Initial assessment of potential impact of emergency
6. Mobilizing the recovery teams
7. Notifying employees, families and the media
8. Maintaining suitable records and event logs 
You’ll need to make sure you cover these key areas:
■
Facilities
■
Hardware and software
■
Communications
■
Data ﬁles
■
Customer services
■
User operations
■
IT network and communication services
■
End-user systems
■
Other processing operations

There are a variety of books, training courses and tools available on
the Internet that will assist you in creating a business continuity and dis-
aster recovery plan for your organization. While this is not solely the
responsibility of the IT department, it’s unlikely there is another group in
your organization that is, or should be, tasked with this job, so you should
consider it the job of IT to head up this planning effort.
The Small Business Administration’s website provides a number of
guidelines that should be considered in your disaster and recovery plan-
ning, though it is by no means exhaustive.
Facilities 
1. Develop contingency plans to remain in operation if your ofﬁce,
plant, or store is unusable. Could you operate out of your home
or a nearby storefront? Could you quickly transport critical items
such as computers, inventory, and equipment? Could you save
replaced equipment and reactivate it in an emergency? Could
you store inventory, equipment, and supplies off-site? Examine
the possibilities, make a plan, and assure that you and your
employees know what to do.
2. Keep extras of any hard-to-replace parts or supplies on hand.
Store them off-site. If this cannot be done, work with suppliers in
advance to assure a secure and adequate supply. Store several days’
supply in a place that is not vulnerable to the same disaster as
your facility. Be sure to keep this auxiliary supply up-to-date.
3. Make upgrades now that would prevent possible future damage.
Strengthening exterior walls, adding a retaining wall or shoring
up a creek bank are relatively minor projects in comparison to
losing the building to ﬂood waters.
Operations
1. Purchase a backup generator to maintain full operations or crit-
ical functions such as refrigeration, lighting, security systems, and
computer control in the event of a power failure.
www.syngress.com
556
Chapter 13 • IT Operational Security Plan

2. Have back-up vendors and shippers in place in case your primary
ones are disabled. Set up relationships in advance and maintain
them. Place occasional orders so that they regard you as an active
customer when you need them.
3. Guard against loss of your customer base by diversifying your
product lines, sales locations, or target customers. Make it part of
your annual plan to develop new customers, even if your current
customer base seems ﬁne. Make the time to do so.
Information and Communications
1. Make backup copies of all critical records such as accounting and
employee data, as well as customer lists, production formulas, and
inventory. Keep a backup copy of your computer’s basic oper-
ating system, boot ﬁles, and critical software. Store a copy of all
vital information on-site and a second in a safe off-site location.
Make it a critical part of your routine to regularly back up ﬁles.
2. Make pre-arrangements with computer vendors to quickly
replace damaged vital hardware. Keep invoices, shipping lists, and
other documentation of your system conﬁguration off-site so you
can quickly order the correct replacement components.Take care
of credit checks, purchase accounts and other vendor require-
ments in advance so that the vendor can ship replacements
immediately.
3. Surge-protect all computer and phone equipment through power
and phone lines.A power surge through a telephone line can
destroy an entire computer through a connected modem. Invest
in a surge protector that has a battery backup to assure that sys-
tems keep working through blackouts.
4. Maintain an up-to-date copy of phone numbers, computer and
Internet logon codes and passwords, employee phone numbers
and other critical information in an accessible location. Develop
an employee “telephone tree” to rapidly contact employees in an
emergency.
www.syngress.com
IT Operational Security Plan • Chapter 13
557

Business Insurance
1. Review your current insurance coverage. Is it enough to get your
business back in operation? Will it cover the replacement cost of
vital facilities? Make it a regular annual procedure to review and
update insurance.Also remember that insurance on mortgaged
property probably only covers the lender with nothing left over
for you.
2. Be aware of your contents insurance. Does it cover the replace-
ment cost of critical equipment?
3. Know what your insurance does not cover. Most general casualty
policies do not cover ﬂood damage. Many require additional
riders for windstorm, sewer backup, or earth movement. Consider
adding coverage for likely perils, especially ﬂood insurance.
4. Consider business interruption insurance that assists you with
operating needs during a period of shutdown. It may help you
meet payrolls, pay vendors, and purchase inventory until you are
in full operation again.Also be prepared for the extraordinary
costs of a disaster such as leasing temporary equipment, restoring
lost data, and hiring temporary workers.
5. Don’t assume that, just because it never happened before, it never
will. Flooding patterns are changed by development: water, which
runs off new streets and parking lots, may overwhelm nearby
streams and surrounding land. Landslides and sinkholes may
develop because of distant earth movement, natural or man-
made.The creek by your building may be a tiny, placid stream
that has never ﬂooded, but a downpour may change it into a
destructive torrent that destroys your building foundation. Plan
for the worst.

558
Chapter 13 • IT Operational Security Plan

provided here and supplemented by additional targeted resources should
spark thought about what your company will need to recover from a dis-
aster, whether that’s a security breach or a hurricane, ﬂood or earthquake.
Be sure you put your plan to the test through simulations and assess-
ments.An untested plan is a big unknown and while you can’t always
simulate everything that will occur during a disaster, you can anticipate
the common scenarios and test your plan. For example, if the corporate
network was down, you couldn’t use e-mail. How would you communi-
cate? What if the phone systems were also out? You might be able to use
cell phones if the land lines were down. Simulating a scenario where
power, network and phone communications are down might help you
identify gaps in your plan. While you may never know how well you’ve
prepared until you need to implement your plan, recent events such as
the Hurricane Katrina disaster response have yielded a lot of new infor-
mation about how to respond (and how not to respond) that you can and
should use to reinforce your disaster planning activities.
You will likely want to create a separate project plan for disaster and
business continuity planning and work through it as you would any other
IT project plan. However, this should be part of the mission and responsi-
bility of your response team.
Regulatory Issues
One of the odd things about regulatory and compliance issues is that
meeting these standards does not necessarily make your network or data
secure. While that is the intent of these kinds of regulations, they often
fall short of their intended effect. In part, that’s because lawmakers are not
IT security experts, and in part, it’s because these are complex issues and
it usually takes a few iterations before regulations align with the legiti-
mate operational needs of the business. So, don’t be lulled into a false
sense of security, thinking that if you are compliant, you are also secure.
Earlier in the book, we discussed the legal implications of many of the
regulations facing corporations today. In this chapter, we’re going to run
through some of these same regulations, but this time with an eye toward
www.syngress.com
IT Operational Security Plan • Chapter 13

operational elements such as creating policies that help you comply. We’re
providing additional resources, but again, it’s important to emphasize that
because there are serious consequences to being out of compliance, you
should be in close communication with your ﬁnancial, legal and HR
departments during your compliance assessment and implementation
work to keep you and your company on the right side of the compliance
issue.Also keep in mind that many of these policies and regulations are
being updated on a somewhat regular basis, so the links or references
might change.
Business Intelligence...
Five Compliance Myths
A white paper released by Symantec entitled “Debunking the Top Five
Myths of Compliance” is an interesting read for anyone working on com-
pliance issues in the corporate world. The ﬁve myths discussed are:
1. Compliance initiatives don’t align with business objectives.
2. Compliance can be solved with a project.
3. Compliance is someone else’s problem.
4. IT security is about protecting computers.
5. One security/compliance product can do it all.
The white paper provides a good overview but Myths 1 and 2 are
of particular interest. The elements common to all compliance initiatives
are those things that align with sound business practices, such as
accountability, integrity, custodianship, risk management and standard-
ization. If compliance and security initiatives can be seen as aligned with
sound business practices and supporting the long-term success of the
company, the perception of compliance-related activities might improve.
Granted, there may still be a disconnect between the requirements for
compliance and the way your business runs, but seeing compliance as
part of sound business practices might help your organization buy into
compliance requirements more readily. Myth 2, that compliance can be
solved with a project, is also an important take-away. While this book is

Continued

focused on project planning for a variety of security issues, it is clear that
operational security, the day-to-day security discussed in this chapter, is
how compliance is achieved and maintained. It should be assessed,
planned and initially implemented via a project plan, but maintaining
compliance requires an on-going commitment with consistent organiza-
tional practices in place. This is an important point to understand as you
plan your organizational security project so you can be sure the hand-off
to daily operations at project completion supports and enhances con-
tinued compliance.
The Symantec website has a lot of good information on IT security
and compliance, though it naturally is slanted toward their products and
solutions. You can ﬁnd the white paper many places online, but here’s
one link to it: www.bindview.com/resources/whitepapers/Debunking_
WP.pdf (Bindview was acquired by Symantec).
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act 
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) was
signed into law in 1996. HIPAA came about in response to a need to
establish standards for the transfer of patient data among health care
providers.This includes health care clearinghouses, health plans, and
health care providers who conduct certain ﬁnancial and administrative
transactions electronically. Insurance providers, hospitals, and doctors use a
wide array of information systems to store and transfer patient informa-
tion, and have various claim forms with varying formats, codes, and other
details that must be completed for each claim. HIPAA was enacted to
simplify the claim process. Privacy and security issues were also addressed
in this legislation to protect patient data.
The latest documents including resources to determine if your com-
pany must comply with HIPAA standards can be found at www.cms.
hhs.gov/HIPAAGenInfo/02_TheHIPAALawandMore.asp#TopOfPage.
The guidelines include:
1. Administrative procedures Documented practices to establish
and enforce security policies

IT Operational Security Plan • Chapter 13
561

2. Physical safeguards Protection of buildings and equipment
from natural hazards and intrusions
3. Technical security services Processes that protect, control, and
monitor information access
4. Technical security mechanisms Controls that restrict unau-
thorized access to data transmitted over a network

By now, you’re probably aware of your company’s need to be com-
pliant with HIPAA, but if you’re new to your job or new to the com-
pany, you may want to become more familiar with HIPAA.You might

Websites.
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act
On November 12, 1999, President Clinton signed the Financial
Modernization Act, commonly known as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act
(GLBA). GLBA includes provisions to protect consumers’ personal ﬁnan-
cial information held by ﬁnancial institutions.There are three principal
parts to the privacy requirements: the ﬁnancial Privacy Rule, Safeguards
Rule and pretexting provisions.
The Financial Privacy Rule governs the collection and disclosure of
customers’ personal ﬁnancial information by ﬁnancial institutions. It also
applies to companies, whether or not they are ﬁnancial institutions, who
receive such information.An overview of the ﬁnancial privacy require-
ments is summarized on the Federal Trade Commission website at
www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/buspubs/glbshort.htm.
The Safeguards Rule requires all ﬁnancial institutions to design,
implement and maintain safeguards to protect customer information.The
Safeguards Rule applies not only to ﬁnancial institutions that collect
information from their own customers, but also to ﬁnancial institutions
“such as credit reporting agencies” that receive customer information
from other ﬁnancial institutions.

Chapter 13 • IT Operational Security Plan

The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act also prohibits “pretexting,” the use of
false pretenses, including fraudulent statements and impersonation, to
obtain consumers’ personal ﬁnancial information, such as bank balances.
This law also prohibits the knowing solicitation of others to engage in
pretexting.The Commission has been active in bringing cases to halt the
operations of companies and individuals that allegedly practice pretexting
and sell consumers’ ﬁnancial information. For more information, visit
www.ftc.gov/privacy/privacyinitiatives/glbact.html.
Sarbanes-Oxley Act
As you know, Sarbanes-Oxley deals with financial information and it
applies to companies that deal with a variety of financial types of data.
As with HIPAA, if your company is required to be compliant with
SOX, you’re probably already painfully aware of this fact and have had
to deal with it.Your operational IT security plan should review current
and updated compliance data and ensure that your operational plans
incorporate methods that support or enhance compliance with SOX.
Clearly, many of these regulations continue to undergo modification,
often to clarify the intent or implementation of a particular aspect of
the regulation.
If you want more information on SOX, the University of Cincinnati
College of Law has a great Website that gives you some of the details (a
link from the Security and Exchange Commission Website), at
www.law.uc.edu/CCL/SOact/toc.html. Due to the complexity of these
regulations, you should certainly involve your ﬁnancial and legal experts
in discussions about what’s needed to become or remain compliant. If
your company is currently compliant, your IT security project might look
at ways of reducing the burden of maintaining compliance through the
use of appropriate technologies and through the revision and enforce-
ment of security policies.
If you want to really dig in and learn more, there’s a wealth of infor-
mation on the SEC’s Website at www.sec.gov/index.htm.

SEC Announces Next Steps for Sarbanes-
Oxley Implementation to Help Small Companies
Anyone working at a small public company knows the challenges that
SOX compliance brought on. In response to several on-going problems,
the SEC issued a press release that speaks directly to changes that should
relieve some of the burden on small companies. 
On May 17, 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission took a
series of actions it intended to take to improve the implementation of
the Section 404 internal control requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
of 2002. 
The actions the Commission intended to take included issuing SEC
guidance for companies and working with the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) on revisions of its internal control
auditing standard. These actions are based on extensive analysis and
commentary in recent months from investors, companies, auditors, and
others. The actions also included SEC inspections of PCAOB efforts to
improve Section 404 oversight and a brief further postponement of the
Section 404 requirements for the smallest company ﬁlers, although ulti-
mately all public companies will be required to comply with the internal
control reporting requirements of Section 404. 
If you read the press release carefully (follow the link provided
below), you’ll notice some interesting language such as “we will take a
giant step toward ‘getting it right’” and “future guidance will be scal-
able and responsive to their individual circumstances.” This language
suggests that the SEC knows that compliance is needed but that many
smaller companies are struggling to make sense or to implement these
regulations. Given the number of companies subject to SOX and the
overwhelming complexity of the rules, this is an important acknowl-
edgement from the SEC and should help companies that are struggling
to become compliant even after compliance deadlines have passed.

Chapter 13 • IT Operational Security Plan

There are numerous other regulations to which your company may
have to apply but these are the “big three” compliance headaches for
most companies. In order to incorporate these regulations and compli-
ance requirements into your IT operational security project plan, you’ll
need to be fairly familiar with the requirements, so the ﬁrst step would
become well-versed in these areas.
Many companies sell products they claim help companies become
compliant with a variety of regulations. Clearly, some of these claims are
true and some are probably not-so-true. However, before you run out
and purchase a variety of these products, you should complete your
assessment and create a project plan for gaining and maintaining compli-
ance.Taking an ad hoc approach to purchasing and implementing com-
pliance products will leave you with a patchwork of solutions that may
do nothing more than drain your IT budget. If you use the steps delin-
eated throughout this book – deﬁne the problem, deﬁne the desired out-
come, look at potential solutions, look at constraints, assumptions and
requirements, and select the most appropriate solution – you’ll end up
with a much more thorough and consistent solution to your security and
compliance needs.As the earlier sidebar pointed out, security and compli-
ance cannot be viewed simply as “projects,” they must be seen as on-
going activities that are woven into the fabric of corporate operations.
However, becoming secure and compliant is often best done through a
project plan that has the development of on-going processes and proce-
dures to maintain and enhance security as one of its objectives.
Project Parameters
Now that we’ve looked at the elements of IT operational security
including incident response, policies, disaster recovery and regulatory
issues, let’s deﬁne the problem statement, the mission statement and the
project’s other parameters. Remember that your operational security
planning should begin with forming a core project team that can partici-
pate in deﬁning the project parameters from the ground up. Once you’ve
deﬁned the basic project requirements and parameters, you can then
www.syngress.com
IT Operational Security Plan • Chapter 13
565

modify team membership so that you include needed subject matter
experts and other key stakeholders for the project.
We’re assuming you know how to do the basic project deﬁnition
tasks, so we will run through these elements rather quickly with an eye
on operational security.
Problem
The essential problem is that technology, alone, cannot protect your net-
work. People need to understand what they can, should and must do to
maintain that security. Your organization needs to have a plan for how to
respond if something does happen – whether that’s a security breach or a
disaster. If your company is subject to regulations, you must develop pro-
cesses, procedures and policies that enable you to remain compliant and
to maintain security after project work is complete. So, let’s pose three
potential problem statements you can use as starting points.
Our ﬁrm is looking into expanding, and part of this expan-
sion would include handling consumer credit card data. If
we choose to go this route, we will be required to comply
with GLBA regulations. The executive team wants to know
what it will take (how much time and money) to become
compliant so they can make a decision as to whether they
want to begin handling consumer credit card data or not.
At present, we are not subject to any regulation and we do
not know if our organization is even close to being com-
pliant with GLBA regulations.
Our ﬁrm is required to comply with Sarbanes-Oxley, but we
are struggling with understanding the rules, regulations and
compliance requirements. Since we are a very small ﬁrm, the
regulatory burden has been signiﬁcant. 
Our ﬁrm has been fortunate not to have experienced a secu-
rity breach, but we do not have a well-thought out
approach to responding to an incident, whether natural or
manmade.
www.syngress.com
566
Chapter 13 • IT Operational Security Plan

Mission/Outcome
Your mission statement, often called an outcome statement, is the ﬂip side
of your problem statement and you should be able to come up with an
outcome statement pretty easily. We’ll continue with the three sample
problem statements.
To provide a clear assessment to management of the time
and cost required to become compliant with GLBA regula-
tions so the executive team can make an informed decision
about the cost/beneﬁt ratio of the proposed transaction.
Taking a fresh look at our current practices using a more
methodical project management approach will yield a better
strategy for us to get closer to becoming and remaining
fully compliant with Sarbanes-Oxley now and in the future.
We will have a clear, concise plan for maintaining security in
the event of a security incident, whether natural or man-
made. We will know exactly what to do in the event of a
problem and will respond in a calm, rational and effective
manner. 
Solution
We’re taking a short cut here because the next step in your process would
be to think through all the possible solutions you and your team could
come up with and then rank the solutions, identify organizational con-
straints that would impact solution selection and select a solution. We’re
assuming you’ll do all of that and that you’re ready to select your solu-
tion. Clearly, the solution must be one that addresses the needs of your
particular organization (time, budget, scope) and if needed, the regulatory
environment.
Your solution should also encompass the four distinct operational
security areas we discussed in this chapter: incident response, policy man-
agement, disaster planning and recovery and regulatory compliance.Your
solution will form the foundation of your operational security project
www.syngress.com
IT Operational Security Plan • Chapter 13
567

plan, so we’ll assume for our purposes that you are addressing all four
areas.The solution statement would look something like this:
To address these concerns, we will perform an operational
risk assessment and form a permanent response team
tasked with reviewing, managing and maintaining opera-
tional security including incident response, policy manage-
ment, disaster response and regulatory compliance related
to the corporate IT infrastructure and services.
Your solution may vary but the idea is to determine how you will
address the problem and the mission or desired/required outcome.You
can also develop your three to ﬁve top level objectives at this point based
on the solution you’ve identiﬁed. We’ll expand on these objectives when
we create our work breakdown structure later in this chapter.
Scope
As with any project scope statement, you need to deﬁne what is and is
not included in your project.This scope statement will form the founda-
tion of your Work Breakdown Structure and after you’ve deﬁned your
WBS, you’ll come back to your scope statement to see if the two match.
If not, you’ll have to revise one or the other so that you have consistency
throughout your operational security project. Let’s look at some of the
things that could be included (or excluded) from your scope statement.
■
Incident response Your operational security plan, at minimum,
should include planning for incident response. Best practices dic-
tate forming a response team but if your planning activities sug-
gest a different and more optimal path, incorporate that into your
plan.
■
Policy management Policy management includes the com-
piling, review, revision and maintenance of all corporate policies
related to IT and network security.You may choose to carve this
out into a separate project using a different team. Be clear about
whether your project includes or excludes policy management.
Also deﬁne clear boundaries of policy management for project
www.syngress.com
568
Chapter 13 • IT Operational Security Plan

purposes so you know what is included and excluded from your
policy management tasks.
■
Disaster response This is part of business continuity planning
(BCP) and while IT plays an ever increasing role in BCP, you
may decide to parse out this work. For example, your company
may already have BCP teams or projects in place and you may
need to prepare your IT portions and insert them into the larger
BC plan. Be clear about what your planning activities include
and exclude and how this ﬁts into the larger BCP process at your
company.
■
Regulatory compliance Compliance crosses several major
corporate “boundaries” and touches legal, ﬁnancial, HR, training
and IT. If your operational security plan includes regulatory com-
pliance, be speciﬁc about which regulations you’re addressing and
how you’ll gain and maintain compliance. If this is going to be
delegated to a regulatory project team or a team whose mission is
to manage regulatory issues, be clear about that as well.
Compliance must be maintained once achieved, so your project
plan should include on-going operational procedures that support
compliance if compliance is part of your project plan.
Cost
Operational security planning costs can include the cost of purchasing
tools, equipment and training resources but most of your cost in a project
of this nature is going to be time.The majority of tasks in this project
involve gathering, reviewing, revising, disseminating, managing and
updating data. If you have a speciﬁc budget allocated to this project, make
note of it here so you can compare it to the costs you calculate after
developing your WBS.
Time
Operational security planning is usually not as time-sensitive as other IT
security projects may be. Certainly having a trained response team or
www.syngress.com
IT Operational Security Plan • Chapter 13
569

well-crafted user security policies are important and should be in place,
but securing the infrastructure is usually a ﬁrst step followed by a review
and improvement of operational security.Therefore, you may ﬁnd that
your schedule for operational security is longer because it typically is not
as time-sensitive.That doesn’t mean you can “back burner” it and expect
everything will turn out ﬁne. It should be a priority to perform the tasks
in this project to maintain the security your team has worked so hard to
achieve through the other projects.
Quality
As we’ve stated throughout the book, quality is as much a state of mind
as it is speciﬁc measurable results. In your operational security project
plan, quality will include statements and measurements in the following
areas:
■
Incident response Your incident response plan should include
metrics about response time and time between response and
recovery. It could include quality measurements related to how
many incidents were detected and prevented, how many incidents
were detected and responded to and how well various systems
performed.
■
Policy management Policy management quality is a bit more
difﬁcult to quantify.The goal should be to create and manage
policies that are as clear, concise and effective as possible. Metrics
might include number of policies reviewed and revised, number
of security incidents related to user issues before and after policy
revision or the number of awareness campaigns or employees
trained through the policy management activities.
■
Disaster response BCP and disaster response quality should
strive to be as complete as possible.A high quality plan will touch
on all the major points of BCP.This area may be difﬁcult to
determine the quality of the plan in advance of actually using the
plan so testing portions of the plan through simulations and
www.syngress.com
570
Chapter 13 • IT Operational Security Plan

assessments will be an important part of developing a quality dis-
aster response plan.
■
Regulatory compliance Compliance is an area where there
are sometimes very clear measurements and sometimes vague or
conﬂicting requirements for compliance.As the regulatory envi-
ronment continues to evolve, especially with regard to computer
security, it will be important to use as many quantiﬁable metrics
as possible.Your legal liability may well be based upon quality
assessments such as percentage of policies compliant with Statute
123 or the number of transactions that fall inside or outside some
particular measurement. If there are speciﬁc quality measurements
included in the regulatory areas you must comply with, be sure
to include those in your quality statements and in your technical
requirements.
Remember, too, that you need to assign relative priorities to scope,
cost, time and quality so that when you’re in the middle of managing
your project, you know how to make decisions consistent with the prior-
ities of the project and the organization. Deﬁne which parameter is least
ﬂexible – the one that should not change —  no matter what.Then
deﬁne which parameter is most ﬂexible – the one that can move around
to accommodate the other elements.That’s not to say that you shouldn’t
try to meet all four parameters, but that you need to know the relative
importance of these factors so you can work your plan.Things always
change in a project, and you simply need to know where to “give” and
where to hold ﬁrm. Run your decisions by your project sponsor and be
sure that he or she agrees with your assessment. If you have a disconnect
here, you could end up with a major problem down the road.
Functional Requirements
Your functional requirements describe the things that should be part of
the project plan, but they do not describe speciﬁcally how those require-
ments will be implemented. Functional requirements in each of the four
areas discussed in this chapter may include:
www.syngress.com
IT Operational Security Plan • Chapter 13
571

■
Incident response Your incident response plan should describe
exactly what actions should be done in the event of an incident.
How those actions are implemented may be described as part of
your functional requirements or they may be part of your tech-
nical requirements.
■
Policy management
Policy management functional require-
ments could include the speciﬁc categories of policies your oper-
ational security plan will address. Functional requirements in this
area could also include speciﬁc user or organizational require-
ments for policy that should be included in the project plan so
that you describe the full scope of policies to be addressed.
■
Disaster response Which disaster response activities should be
included in your project? Is this part of a larger BCP or will you
be incorporating the basic BCP elements into your operational
security plan? Deﬁne speciﬁcally what you will address within
the scope of your operational security project plan.
■
Regulatory compliance What speciﬁc regulations is your
company required to comply with and what are the areas of
compliance required? If you clearly deﬁne these functional
requirements, developing methods for meeting compliance
requirements will be that much less burdensome.
Technical Requirements
The technical requirements for most IT projects are often the easiest to
deﬁne, but in the case of operational security requirements, the functional
requirements may end up being easier to deﬁne.Technical requirements
should be developed from your functional requirements and should
include details on how you will be required to deliver the functional
requirements of the project.
■
Incident response Your technical requirements should describe
how you will respond to an incident. In the technical require-
ments, you should include tools, technologies and timelines that
www.syngress.com
572
Chapter 13 • IT Operational Security Plan

are required or that will support meeting the functional require-
ments. If you will use speciﬁc tools like sniffer tools or IDS/IPS
systems, those should be clearly spec’d out in the technical
requirements.
■
Policy management What are the technical requirements for
policy management? They might include speciﬁc policy develop-
ment software tools or they might include the required elements
of all IT security policies.The technical requirements provide
detail on how you will develop the policies in your organization,
so they might also include the methods you’ll use to collect,
store, archive and manage policy revisions. For example, you
might deﬁne a document management system for version man-
agement as part of your policy management technical require-
ments. Since policies are typically part of the compliance
environment as well, you may need to deﬁne speciﬁc technolo-
gies that will be used to meet policy management requirements
for compliance purposes.
■
Disaster response The technical requirements for disaster
response may be quite varied since BCP and disaster response
may include partial and full recovery requirements. If your com-
pany has multiple geographic locations, your technical speciﬁca-
tions will vary from a company that has one location.You might
deﬁne the amount of power a backup generate will need (or
your project plan may include tasks to help you deﬁne that), the
number of users to be supported in a temporary or alternate
work location, the amount of network storage required or the
speciﬁcations for off-site storage of critical network data.
■
Regulatory compliance Technical requirements for regulatory
compliance vary greatly due to the diverse nature of the compli-
ance environment. Speciﬁcations that describe how you will meet
functional (and regulatory) requirements may include software
speciﬁcations, audit cycles, monitoring tools and more.

Legal/Compliance Requirements
There may be legal and compliance requirements that don’t ﬁt neatly
into functional or technical requirements that you may want to clearly
delineate in this section. In addition, even if it overlaps a bit, you may ﬁnd
it helpful to articulate the compliance requirements in a separate section
so they can be easily found, referred to and updated as needed. It’s wise
to take whatever advance steps you can to make your compliance process
easier and less burdensome on your entire organization. Keeping compli-
ance requirements separate can also help you distinguish between opera-
tional plans that you are choosing to implement to improve security
versus those you are required to take by an outside organization that ulti-
mately may, or may not, improve security in your organization.
Success Factors
You may choose to include success factors in your requirements planning
or you may choose to include it later in your project assumptions section.
In either case, you should clearly articulate what it will take for the project
to be a success. If those factors are missing or constrained, your project
success is at risk. If the success factors are never articulated, you might fail
to realize a key component is missing. Once deﬁned, these can be listed as
requirements for the project and can be included in risk management
planning as well, since a missing success factor puts the project at risk.
Required Skills
The skills needed for an operational security project plan really run the
gamut from technical skills to operational management to communica-
tion and writing skills and just about everything in between. We’ve cre-
ated a preliminary list from which you can start.
■
Technical skills Networking, systems (servers, hosts), security
components (routers, ﬁrewalls), administration, operations, appli-
cations, databases.
www.syngress.com
574
Chapter 13 • IT Operational Security Plan

■
Auditing skills Thoroughness, attention to detail, understanding
of auditing/assessment procedures and best practices, documenta-
tion, versioning (document management), and archiving.
■
Planning and coordination skills The operational security
plan touches all parts of the organization so the ability to effec-
tively plan cross-departmental activities and the ability to coordi-
nate across the enterprise are important skills for this type of
project. In addition, disaster and continuity planning require
strong planning and coordination skills as does developing an
incident response team.
■
Writing skills The ability to clearly articulate polices and pro-
cedures, incident response procedures, disaster recovery plans and
more requires strong writing skills.
■
Communication skills An operational security project requires
the ability to communicate effectively with a variety of stake-
holders across the enterprise.The coordination of incident
response or disaster response planning (and implementation)
requires strong communication skills as does the promulgation of
corporate security policies throughout the company.
Personnel Needed
Your operational security project plan will need people from inside and
outside your IT department.After identifying your required skills, you’ll
need to begin looking for the right resources in your organization to
assist in this project. Look across your organization for the right people –
don’t be myopic and look only at IT staff for help with this project.The
more you can reach out and involve people from different areas of your
company, the better your organizational security planning process will be.
You may still need to head this up and keep in on track but you should
certainly include a representative cross-section of your company in this
process.

IT Operational Security Plan • Chapter 13
575

Project Processes and Procedures
Project processes and procedures are those needed to run this speciﬁc pro-
ject.We’re assuming you have a whole slew of processes and procedures at
your disposal from working on other similar projects. So, let’s look at
which ones might be unique to an operational security project plan.
First, you’ll need cross-functional communication and coordination.
Whereas other IT projects teams may have included members from other
departments, this project must include members from across the organiza-
tion. Do they all use email? For example, some companies have divisions
or sections of their companies that are less technical than others. If you
have a manufacturing plant, do all the employees there have access to
email or an intranet? If not, then disseminating project update or security
policies to them may present a different set of issues. Look across the
organization and across your proposed team (we’ll cover team composi-
tion in the next section) and determine the processes and procedures that
might work with this diverse population. If some members of the team
use Instant Messaging and other members are not IM-enabled, you may
have communication problems.
Second, you’ll need to test many of your plans in simulation types of
settings. For example, you can run a drill for incident response or disaster
response but you won’t be able to fully simulate all aspects of an actual
problem.Your processes and procedures should address this unique need
as well. How are problems with drills or simulations addressed? How
should be they be documented or escalated? Certainly, you’ll need to
have well-thought out change management processes that help you revise
your project plan based on results from tests. If you ﬁnd that your project
work or your test results are missing the mark, you’ll need to have very
solid practices in place to manage the process of implementing feedback
and change based on project results.
For compliance and regulatory issues, you most likely have to follow
very speciﬁc mandatory steps, processes and procedures.These should be
included as project procedures so that as you work your way through
your project you don’t have two sets of procedures to follow.You may
www.syngress.com
576
Chapter 13 • IT Operational Security Plan

choose to incorporate them in a way that makes it clear they are part of
the regulatory or compliance process so they can be given the attention
needed.You’ll also need to deﬁne the processes and procedures needed
once project work is complete to maintain compliance standards.This is
usually accomplished by adding one or more tasks in your project plan
regarding on-going operations and project hand-off, as discussed earlier in
this book.
Project Team
We’ve touched on this throughout the chapter because we’ve talked
about the far-reaching nature of an operational security project plan.
Once you’ve deﬁned the functional, technical, and regulatory require-
ments for the project, you’ve deﬁned what you need to accomplish in the
project. By looking at the speciﬁc skills needed to accomplish project
work, you’ve essentially deﬁned who you need. Gathering that team
together and coordinating those activities will be your biggest challenge
for two reasons. First, you’ll be interacting with people from all over your
organization and coordinating them can simply be a challenging task.
Second, not everyone is going to recognize, accept or respond to the
authority of an operational security project manager.This is where execu-
tive support becomes vital to project success. If you have one of the top
executives in your company supporting you and your project’s objectives,
you should ﬁnd more organizational cooperation. If needed, your execu-
tive support may also include putting a bit of pressure on unruly or
unwilling participants to ensure project success.
Gather your project team together and get them ﬁred up about the
project by helping them understand the importance of their work on the
project and how it supports and enhances the company’s efforts. Make
sure you introduce everyone present since there may be people who have
never worked together before. In large companies, there very well could
be people who’ve never met or even heard of others before this meeting.
Develop a team roster and distribute it to all team members. Deﬁne roles
and responsibilities so that everyone is clear about how the project will
www.syngress.com
IT Operational Security Plan • Chapter 13
577

proceed and how they will interact with the team.These are all basic IT
project management concepts that are not unique to operational security.
However, operational security is likely to pull in people from areas of the
organization who may not normally interact closely with IT or who have
never been involved with this kind of project.Therefore, it’s your job as
project manager to pull these folks in, make them feel welcomed and set
clear expectations so everyone can work effectively in their assigned roles.
Project Organization
Organizing an operational security project is challenging because it can
(and usually is) so wide-reaching in scope.Your typical organizational
methods will probably work well but you’ll need to coordinate to a
greater extent.This type of project lends itself well to creating sub-teams
since developing policies is a set of tasks distinctly separate (though
related) from forming a disaster response plan.These teams can be coordi-
nated but allowed to work in parallel if the project is well-organized.You
may choose to break the four topic areas we’ve discussed (incident
response, policy management, disaster response and compliance) into four
sub-projects that roll up into a master plan so that resources, schedules
and activities can be effectively coordinated. It’s highly likely that you’ll
have activities that intersect that need to be coordinated. For example,
you’ll certainly need to coordinate compliance activities with policy
development so that the policy team can create the policies and opera-
tional procedures needed to maintain compliance on a moving-forward
basis.You should also keep an eye on translating all of this work into on-
going operational procedures.At the end of your project work, you
should have procedures deﬁned that deal with incident response, policy
management, disaster response and compliance for day-to-day operations.
Once project work is completed, you should have updated policies and
procedures for daily operations.

Project Work Breakdown Structure
Creating a work breakdown structure begins with your top level objec-
tives. If you haven’t deﬁned those top level objectives yet, you can do so
now. Ideally, you should deﬁne three to ﬁve top level objectives, though
in some cases you might reasonably come up with six or seven.Too many
and you’ve gone into too much detail too early, too few and you may be
overlooking something or may not fully understand your project. Since
we’ve been working with four project elements, let’s use those as our four
objectives. If your project is not going to cover these four areas, you can
modify your project’s WBS as needed.

Remember to check your scope against your functional, technical and
regulatory requirements and make sure everything syncs up.This is one
place that scope begins to creep out of control and ensuring that your
requirements are reﬂected in your WBS and that the WBS reﬂects your
requirements is a great checkpoint in your project planning process.Also,
if anything has changed (or even if it hasn’t), this is also a good time to sit
down with your project sponsor and review the project before project
work begins. If any changes need to occur, now’s the time to make them.
Task details are developed after your WBS. Remember the basics.
Tasks should have one and only one owner, though others may con-
tribute to task work.Task details help drive quality, so be sure to have
subject matter experts assist in developing task details, especially comple-
tion criteria. Note any dependencies, constraints or requirements associ-

IT Operational Security Plan • Chapter 13
583

ated with tasks so you can build them into your project schedule and
budget. Identify how long a task will take (duration allotted) and how
much you expect it to cost. Some projects work with hard costs only and
do not track direct project labor. Other companies want people to keep
timesheets to track time against speciﬁc projects.This is especially true in
consulting ﬁrms, but your ﬁrm may also require this level of tracking.
Project Risks and Mitigation Strategies
The risks to an operational security plan are as varied as the tasks within
the plan. Let’s break it down based on the four high level objectives and
we can walk through a few of the possible risks.You and your project
team should sit down, identify the risks and rank them based on their
likelihood of occurring and the criticality of such an occurrence.Then,
you can choose how far down the prioritized list to go in your planning
session. For each risk, develop a mitigation strategy that includes potential
ways to avoid the risk altogether or ways to reduce the impact of the risk
should it end up occurring. Finally, be sure to include triggers so you
know when you’ll implement your mitigation plan. If appropriate, you
should also look at potential risks your alternative strategies may inject
into your project plan. In some cases, you may ﬁnd that you’d rather deal
with a particular risk, should it occur, than to implement a more ﬂawed
“Plan B.”
Incident response
Remember, risk planning is not the risk that an incident will occur but
the risk that something will impact our incident response project plan.
What are the things that could put that project segment at risk? Things
like a corporate re-organization, acquisition or spin-off certainly would
impact your project. Staff layoffs could decimate your response team;
budget cutbacks could impact your team’s ability to remain current on
threats and vulnerabilities. Budget cutbacks could also put equipment
(hardware, software) purchases at risk. Changes in the legal or compliance
markets could imperil your incident response project plan as well.
www.syngress.com
584
Chapter 13 • IT Operational Security Plan

Policy management
Changes in the management structure or philosophy of the company
could certainly put a policy management project at risk.Another poten-
tial risk to this part of the project is the other corporate-wide disruptions
including re-organizations, acquisitions, spin-offs that would impact the
scope of the project. Layoffs could impact your ability to complete the
project. Changes in the legal or regulatory environment could certainly
put a project of this nature at risk.The project could also be delayed by
changes in technology, so the project should be coordinated with any
major infrastructure changes such as the implementation of a wireless
network, the upgrading of remote access technologies or the introduction
of new authentication technologies, to name a few.
Disaster planning
You disaster planning is also subject to the same macro-level considera-
tions as the previous two topics covered. Changes to various infrastruc-
ture components such as the introduction of a new facility or the closing
of an older one that was providing data services or backup functions
could impact your disaster planning project.You and your team should
look closely at what could impact your disaster planning and address
these because when it’s all said and done, you need a solid disaster
recovery plan in place.You need to test that plan and keep it up-to-date
so that if a disaster strikes, you have some reasonable path to follow.
Budget cuts, layoffs and other organizational change can dramatically
impact your disaster readiness, so you should give this area of risk mitiga-
tion serious attention.
Regulatory/compliance
The biggest risks to this section of your project plan involve things gen-
erally outside of your control whether that’s changes to the language or
intent of the regulations or lack of clarity about requirements for compli-
ance.This is an area where you should involve executives and legal
www.syngress.com
IT Operational Security Plan • Chapter 13
585

counsel, if appropriate, to ensure you’ve covered the potential risks and
understand the intricacies of this environment.
Project Constraints and Assumptions
Utilize this section of your project plan to list any known constraints to
your project as well as any assumptions under which you’re operating.
Constraints are usually restrictions impacting your project as a whole such
as resource limitations or constraints imposed by other corporate initia-
tives or directives. Constraints could also come from the legal or regula-
tory environment, so be sure to look at these as well.
Assumptions are critical to include in your project plan because with
every project, we make certain assumptions about the environment that
will be in place when we commence project work. Examples of assump-
tions include stafﬁng levels, expertise on your IT project team or the
timing of other key events. While it’s sometimes hard to see exactly what
we’re assuming to be true about a situation, work with your project team
to identify these assumptions and document them in your project plan.
Run them by your project sponsor to be sure they’re acceptable assump-
tions. If you assume that the company will proceed with purchasing and
implementing an IDS or IPS system and it doesn’t, your incident response
plan could change signiﬁcantly. If you’re assuming your company will
remain at its current size and number of locations, list that since any
change could impact all areas of your operational security plan.
Project Schedule and Budget
At this point, you should have all the data you need to develop a prelimi-
nary schedule and budget based on the information deﬁned in your
WBS.You’ll need to enter your WBS into a project management software
tool if you want to use automated scheduling features (highly recom-
mended).You’ll need to look at resource constraints as well as dependen-
cies. In this project, you may have four sub-teams performing project
work but there may be overlap. It’s conceivable (perhaps likely) that you’ll
have the same or overlapping resources on your policy management sec-
www.syngress.com
586
Chapter 13 • IT Operational Security Plan

tion and on your compliance section because these two areas are so
closely connected.You may also have the same or an overlapping group of
people working on your incident response section and your disaster plan-
ning section. Be sure you account for overlapping resource conﬂicts in
your schedule.You also need to identify dependencies for the project.
These will probably have common characteristics the four sections. For
example, your policy group’s timing will depend on the timelines of the
incident response team, the disaster recovery team and the compliance
team because policies cross all those boundaries. Look for these areas and
be sure that your schedule accommodates these. Once you’ve loaded in
your dependencies, check your critical path. If all (or none) of your tasks
are on the critical path, something’s wrong and you’ll need to go back
through your schedule to see what’s going on.
Each task contains details regarding cost, so you should also be able
create a realistic budget for your project at this point. Both schedule and
budget should be reviewed with your project sponsor and signed off on.
If there are any problems, resolve them now before project work begins.
One ﬁnal note on project budgets – you will need to have on-going
activities to support network security.Your project plan should include an
assessment of the on-going activities and costs the company will incur to
maintain security.This is typically less than the cost of going through
another full-blown security assessment. Including information about the
cost of on-going security operations at the end of your project, as part of
project close-out can help you budget moving forward.

Summary
You can secure your network using hardware and software but if you
don’t develop operational plans to maintain that security, you still have
signiﬁcant risk to your network. Operational security involves developing
incident response teams that can address three major areas of security:
security management, proactive services and reactive services.Your
response team planning project (or sub-project) should address these areas
and provide on-going support for network security.The work of the
response team overlaps other areas of the organization and including key
stakeholders in the response team’s planning and implementation will
help provide a more comprehensive approach to incident management.
Policies and procedures are vital to on-going security operations.The
IT staff will need updated policies and procedures for managing day-to-
day security and users will need updated policies and procedures to help
them do their part to maintain a safe and secure network environment.
Most companies have policies and procedures related to network and
computer security but they are often implemented in a haphazard or lax
manner, resulting in security lapses. Since a large number of internal secu-
rity breaches are the result of someone intentionally or unintentionally
disregarding security policies, this is an area that will bolster network
security signiﬁcantly. Review and revise policies then make sure they’re
kept up-to-date and that users are well aware of them. Using targeted
education and awareness campaigns, you can be sure your users have the
tools they need to help maintain a secure computing environment.
Disaster planning is the subject of entire books, so we only covered
the basics in this chapter. However, you should be aware that disaster
planning and recovery are part of the larger business continuity planning
function.As such, your project team should include stakeholders from
every corner of the organization. In some companies, the IT staff heads
up BC planning because so much of the work involves ensuring network
services become quickly available after a disaster. In other companies, IT
staff participates as part of a corporate project team to perform overall BC
planning that incorporates IT plans.

Chapter 13 • IT Operational Security Plan

Regulations regarding conﬁdentiality and privacy have proliferated in
recent years and almost every IT staff has to deal with some sort of regu-
lations. While this can be an onerous task, working within a consistent
methodology such as IT project management can make the task more
manageable. Failure to comply with regulations can be costly in some
cases; in other cases, it can be the cause of serious legal action.To avoid
these problems, be sure to understand your company’s compliance issues
and seek expert advice as you move toward compliance. Some regulatory
agencies have provided very clear guidelines; other guidelines are vague
or contradictory.Addressing these issues within an IT project manage-
ment framework can help you support and defend your position and ulti-
mately get you close to achieving and maintaining compliance.
All four of these areas have overlapping segments and taking an inte-
grated approach to operational security will help you avoid gaps that can
be created by looking at these areas as individual projects. Operational
security project plans are often developed and implemented in parallel or
subsequent to other IT security project plans because they provide the
framework for maintaining IT security once achieved.This critical step
should be undertaken with the same attention to security and detail as
every other IT security project plan and should be the ﬁnal piece of the
puzzle in maintaining a secure environment. Network and IT security is a
never-ending job, but putting solid operational plans in place will help
reduce the burden by building in practices and procedures that support
and enhance IT security.
Solutions Fast Track
Operational Security Assessment
 Operational security planning and implementation helps support
and enhance network security through addressing the on-going
security needs of the organization.
www.syngress.com
IT Operational Security Plan • Chapter 13
591

 These on-going needs can be broken down into ﬁve main areas:
Incident response, security policies, disaster recovery, regulatory
compliance and conﬁguration management
 Incident response is typically managed through the creation of a
response team.
 The response team’s mission can be broken down into three
areas: security management services, proactive services and
reactive services.Together, these three areas address the on-going
security services needed to maintain a secure network
environment.
 Most companies have policies related to network security
including IT operational procedures or policies and user policies.
 Policies that are not current are a liability to network security
because they may require or advise users to take actions that are
no longer appropriate or that cause confusion.
 Policies should be written in a clear, concise and easy-to-
understand manner that enables the intended audience to quickly
and easily understand what is required to maintain security.
 Awareness campaigns are an important part of promulgating
security policies. Raising user awareness about security issues,
especially in an environment where security threats change
everyday, can mean the difference between an attempted
intrusion and a successful one.
 Disaster planning is part of the larger business continuity planning
process.
 Disaster planning is often part of the mission of the response
team and there may be overlap in these planning processes.
 Disaster planning should include facilities, operations, IT
operations and business functions.

Chapter 13 • IT Operational Security Plan

 The regulatory environment is constantly changing and you may
need outside expertise or legal counsel to assist in your
compliance planning.
 Using a project management methodology will help in gaining
and maintaining compliance.
 Be sure to build compliance requirements into your project plan
so that you can use your project plan as a means toward
compliance.
Project Parameters
 Executive support is essential to the success of all projects, but
even more so to IT operational projects that span the
organization.
 Deﬁne your functional and technical requirements with an eye
toward compliance issues to reduce your challenges in this area.
Project Team
 Be sure to create a cross-functional team for your operational
security.There are often issues outside of the IT department that
should be taken into consideration during the planning phase.
 An operational security project requires slightly different skills
than a purely technical project.These included the ability to
perform organizational audits, to develop policies and procedures
and to create consistent, clear and useable documentation.
Project Organization
 An operational security plan requires a bit more cross-
departmental coordination due to the wide reaching nature of
operations.
 Some operational security planning can be done in parallel with
other project work; other planning must be done only at the
www.syngress.com
IT Operational Security Plan • Chapter 13
593

conclusion of other project work. Identify areas where working
in parallel is feasible (and desirable) to avoid working at cross-
purposes.
Project Work Breakdown Structure
 Your Work Breakdown Structure development should begin with
developing the high level objectives of the project.
 The four high level objectives for your operational security
project plan include incident response, policy management,
disaster planning and regulatory compliance.
 Task details should be developed by subject matter experts.
 Task details should include compliance or regulatory
requirements so that when project work is complete, the bulk of
the compliance work has been completed as well.
Project Risks and Mitigation Strategies
 Every project has risks that must be addressed. When working on
an operational security project plan, your risks are often related to
the wider organizational environment.
 In some cases, mitigating your risks can cause more operational
problems than the risk itself.After identifying operational security
risks, determine whether your “Plan B” introduces more risk than
the original action.
Project Constraints and Assumptions
 Constraints limit your ability to complete project work.
Constraints are external to the project itself and have to do with
the organizational environment in which the project is being
managed.
www.syngress.com
594
Chapter 13 • IT Operational Security Plan

 Listing assumptions is critical for project success because if any of
the elements you’re assuming to be true or present changes, your
entire project is at risk.
 In an operational security project plan, constraints and
assumptions can be related to corporate-wide actions such as
acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures and other business
relationships.
 Operational security plans are also impacted by impending hiring
or layoff plans. Disruptions to your corporate-wide operational
security project team can derail even the best project plans.
Project Schedule and Budget
 The schedule for your operational security project plan requires
coordination across a variety of functional areas.
 Some operational security components can be done in parallel
with other activities. In some cases, the operational security
planning must be done only at the completion of other project
(typically more technical projects) so that security can be
maintained on a going-forward basis.
 The budget for an operational security budget often is more
heavily weighted toward labor costs than expenditures for tools,
technology or equipment.
 Be sure your project budget can later be translated into a budget
to support on-going security operations.

As network defense perimeters get stronger and stronger, IT, security, law enforce-
ment, and intelligence professionals are realizing that the greatest threats to their
networks are increasingly coming from within their own organizations. These
insiders, consisting of current and former employees or contractors, can use their
inside knowledge of a target network to carry out acts of sabotage, espionage,
and theft of data.
