Intermediate Italian For Dummies 

Introduction
You may like Italian because it’s the language of art, design, good (and healthy)
food, icy mountains and deep blue seas, music, and of course great literature. As
you get to know it better, you’ll discover it’s also the language of great scientists,
traders, explorers, and emigrants. Italian is spoken by the 60 million inhabitants of
Italy and by many people of Italian descent in foreign countries (about 16 million in
the United States alone). And the number of Americans of non-Italian descent who
want to learn Italian is growing.
Italian was established as the language of high culture in the thirteenth century
thanks to the works of many poets and storytellers (the most important one being
Dante and his Divine Comedy). Since then, one shared language has dominated high
culture despite continued political fragmentation, while at the local level people
spoke local languages and dialects also derived from Latin.
Italian, like any language, is a living thing that has changed remarkably over time and
especially in the last 100 years, as modern society and the arrival of mass media have
introduced a simpler, more direct way of speaking. Thanks to universal public educa-
tion, TV, newspapers, and movies, Italians now all speak the same language, with only
some variations in vocabulary and pronunciation. Still, a lot of people, especially
those who don’t live in big cities, continue to speak their local dialects, which after a
phase of neglect are now popular again.
About This Book
The language I present in Intermediate Italian For Dummies is the language of every-
day life in today’s Italy. You’ll find it used in newspapers, on TV, in modern novels, in
instruction booklets, on the Internet, and so forth. At any given point in time, there
are good ways and bad ways of expressing yourself, so I give you the correct version
of the language and usage. But don’t be surprised if you go to Italy and hear or read
something different from what you find in this book. Over time you’ll develop your
own sensibility for expressions that are interesting variations on the language rather
than merely mistakes.
As the title suggests, Intermediate Italian For Dummies is a reference book for people
who have some familiarity with the language. You may find information that you’re
already aware of, in which case you can skip it and move on. You also can choose
where to start and consult only the chapters that interest you. But keep in mind that
the book does proceed logically from simpler matters to more complex ones. The
Cheat Sheet and the appendixes provide you with some quick-reference tools to
check basic things like unfamiliar words but especially pronouns and verb conjuga-
tions, which are two of the least intuitive aspects of Italian for English speakers.

The first part of the book is devoted to nouns, adjectives, and various pronouns.
They share the fact that they vary in gender and number and require users to learn
how to coordinate them when they’re used together. I devote the middle part to
verbs, both to their conjugations and to the way you use them in context. In the latter
part I introduce topics that help you figure out how to put sentences together, either
when asking questions or giving answers or when linking together sentences to
convey complex information.
In each chapter you have the opportunity to practice what you’ve just read. You may
be asked to come up with one word, craft an entire sentence, or select the best word
or phrase to complete a sentence. The bottom line is that it’s important to test your
skills and be able to find information stored in your mind. The Answer Key at the end
of each chapter allows you to check your progress.
Conventions Used in This Book
To make this book as easy to use as possible, I used certain conventions throughout:
 I bold all the Italian words so they stand out in the text; English translations are
in italics.
 When a practice exercise has more than one correct answer, I provide both the
more and the less common answers.
 I use some technical grammar terms. Every subject matter has its jargon, and it’s
much more convenient to learn the difference between mood and tense, or coor-
dination and subordination, than to engage in verbose explanations of what those
words define. The more you use these terms, the more familiar they become —
trust me.
Foolish Assumptions
I made the following assumptions about you (my reader) and your Italian when writ-
ing this book:
 You’re proficient enough in Italian to consider yourself an intermediate-level
writer or speaker. You’re already aware that even the simplest sentence in Italian
requires an understanding of gender and number options, ability to coordinate
endings, and memorization of strange verbal forms, to say the least.
 You understand basic concepts of English grammar. I define them, but I expect
you to have encountered the terms before and to be able to apply them to any
language. From a grammatical point of view, Italian and English are often sub-
stantively different, but with a few exceptions, the grammarians who system-
atized the two languages used the same concepts: A verb is a verb in both
languages, as is a pronoun, a subordinate clause, and so on.
 You want to become more precise when using verbs, pronouns, and other parts
of speech. Sure, Italians will understand you if you say volere Coca-Cola (to want
Coca-Cola) instead of Vorrei una Coca-Cola (I’d like a Coca-Cola), but the pleas-
ure of speaking a foreign language comes with proficiency in it.

Intermediate Italian For Dummies 

 You want to use your Italian to read novels, travel to Italy, do business with
Italians, or possibly pursue a degree in Italian.
 You want to know everyday Italian rather than the language of a special field,
such as economics or medicine.
I do hope that you’re the reader I had in mind when I was writing this book. If you find
it too hard to use, perhaps a more elementary text can help you reach the point where
this book becomes useful for you — it should be challenging, but approachable.
How This Book Is Organized
I divided this book into parts, starting with the building blocks of Italian and ending
with the appendixes. Each part has several chapters that deal in detail with that
part’s subject matter. Here’s a breakdown of the six parts.
Part I: Getting Your Bearings: 
Reviewing the Basics
In this part, I explain the basic grammatical structures of Italian (and English), parts
of speech, and the main differences between Italian and English grammar; the definite
and indefinite articles; masculine, feminine, singular, and plural nouns; and numbers,
including how to handle expressions of time and the calendar.
Part II: A Close Look at Parts of Speech
In this part, I guide you through the maze of Italian pronouns, which are numerous and
complicated. I talk about adjectives and how to coordinate them with nouns; and how
to form short phrases made of a preposition and a noun (called complements), which
you need when the noun by itself can’t carry your meaning. I also cover words like this
and that, indefinites such as some and a little, and how to say that something belongs
to you. I end this part with a chapter about relative pronouns and conjunctions — little
words such a e (and), ma (but), quando (when), and che (that) that enable you to link
sentences together.
Part III: What Would You Do 
without Verbs and Tenses?
Verbs are the core of any language because they convey so much meaning. All you
need is one word — well, perhaps two or three in compound tenses — to give people
a sense of time, the emotion you’re feeling, whether you’re talking about yourself 
or someone else, and whether you’re doing something or you’re the recipient of
someone else’s action. Italian verbs are more varied and more complicated than
English verbs. They’re conjugated (as the verb to be still is in English: I am, you are,
he is, we are, you are, they are). I give you guidelines about how to conjugate verbs.

Introduction

With the regular ones, well, they’re regular, so you pick up the pattern and you apply
it. With the irregular ones, you have to expect surprises. (Sometimes I still find myself
surprised!)
Part IV: Adding Nuances to Moods and Tenses
More verbs, more nuances. This part explores how to give commands and how to
convey possibility, hope, and uncertainty. Italian has very specific verbal forms for
those concepts. This part also tells you how to use various moods (indicative, condi-
tional, and subjunctive) in sentence combinations and how to do it when talking
about the present, the past, and the future.
In addition, this part revolves around the idea that language is a public good in that
you share it with others. You use it mostly to interact, and languages wouldn’t exist if
people weren’t in the company of other human beings. So you ask questions and give
answers in Italian, and you use different constructions to say that you’re acting in the
world, you’re the object of your own actions, or you’re experiencing something being
done to you.
Part V: The Part of Tens
When you’re talking with someone, you have the chance to clarify what you’re saying,
or the other person can give you a useful suggestion about how to express yourself
better. But if you’re writing, you’re on you own. This part includes a list of false
friends, words that look similar but mean different things. I also list ten ways of
expressing yourself that will make your Italian richer and more idiomatic — in writing
or speaking.
Part VI: Appendixes
The appendixes include a verb chart that summarizes conjugations of regular and
irregular Italian verbs, an English-Italian dictionary to help you find the right words in
Italian, and an Italian-English dictionary so that you can figure out the meaning of
unfamiliar words.

Where to Go from Here
In Intermediate Italian For Dummies, I think of my readers as highly motivated people
who are self-starters and have the patience to work through training exercises as if
they were at the gym. Learning a language isn’t easy, but you can make it more enjoy-
able by varying your approach. Perhaps you want to team up with a friend to quiz
each other, write to an Italian pen pal who wants to improve his or her English in
exchange for helping you with your Italian, pick up some Italian-language films to
watch (without subtitles!), or start exploring Italian Web sites and message boards.
You can start with any chapter, so browse all you want. You may want to scan the
table of contents or index first, or just pick a chapter and dive in. In each chapter I
refer to other chapters when the subject matter requires it; I recommend that you
follow the thread, as it were, because all pieces ultimately are tied together in a lan-
guage. Buon lavoro!

efore you plunge into the maze of Italian verbs  and
come out at the other end congratulating yourself for
your great sense of direction, I invite you to review some
basic information. In this part, you’re likely to encounter
many things you already know about using the language,
but it’s always good to refresh one’s memory and integrate
new and old information. With that in mind, I go over the
parts of speech, all the possible endings of articles and
nouns, how to move from singular to plural and vice versa,
and how to count.

talian is a Romance language, derived from Latin. It shares features with its parent
language, including variation in the endings of nouns and adjectives, depending on
the grammatical group they belong to; a sometimes maddening array of verbal forms
that vary in person, tense, and mood (conjugation); and a weakness for linking sen-
tences together by adding one or more dependent clauses to an independent clause.
In other words, Italian has a lot of markers, and gender, number, person, mood, and tense
are just the main ones. The advantage of markers is that they enable you to see that two
words are related even if they’re far away from one another in a sentence. Therefore, the
word order is less strict in Italian than in English, where at times position alone tells you
a word’s function. Because all the pieces can be tied and clustered together, writers can
build long, fluid paragraphs. Hence the beautiful, flowing nature of the language.
The main disadvantage of all those markers is that Italian grammar is complex even at
the beginner level. You need a lot of rules at your fingertips to say or write even the
simplest sentence. This book aims to help you acquire that skill.
If Italian grammar is complex, its phonetics is easy. I say a few words about pronunci-
ation in the section I devote to phonology, the part of grammar that studies sounds
and spelling; but the long and short of it is that a one-to-one correspondence between
what you write and how you say it makes Italian oral comprehension much easier and
frees you from spelling nightmares!
Getting a Grip on Italian Grammar 
Terms and Nuances
Italian grammar has a long history, dating back to — guess what — Latin. Latin gram-
marians are the source of most of the terms used in European languages, including
English. Grammatical terms do what mathematical terms do for you: They allow you
to understand what object you’re dealing with. Is 8 + 8 an addition or a subtraction? Is

3⁄4 a fraction or an equation? These aren’t just labels; rather, they’re concepts that
allow you to perform the correct operation with those numbers. Grammatical con-
cepts do the same for languages, and you discover many of them in the upcoming
sections.
When you consider a language, you can look at many different aspects of it:
 Phonology: The study of a language’s sounds; for example, the difference
between ce (the sound chair in English) and che (the sound kettle in English).
 Morphology: The study of the form words can take — are they singular (gatto
[cat]) or plural (gatti [cats])? Masculine (leone [lion]) or feminine (leonessa
[lioness])? First-person singular (io [I]) or third-person plural (loro [they])? Do
they convey the present (lui va [he goes]) or the past (lui andava [he used to
go])? Is the mood conditional (vorrei [I’d like]) or imperative (alzati! [stand up!])?
 Syntax: The study of the rules that tell you how you can form full sentences and
link them together, as in Vorrei un tè freddo perché fa così caldo (The lake is
frozen because it’s very cold).
 Semantics: The study of the meanings of what people say; for example, if you say
È caldo (It’s hot), what are you talking about? The weather? The roast beef on
your plate?
In this section (and in this book), I talk a little bit about phonology and a lot about
morphology and syntax. And even without saying that I’m doing it, I talk about seman-
tics throughout the book.
Phonology: Saying and spelling words correctly
If you’re reading this book, I assume you already know the basics of Italian spelling
and pronunciation. So with this section, I only want to remind you of some differences
you may experience when listening (or speaking) and reading (or writing).
As in English, the letters c and g can have a hard sound ([c] as in cat and [g] as in go)
or a soft sound ([s] as in city and [j] as in gin). Here’s how the spelling affects 
pronunciation:
 c and g have a hard sound before a, o, and u: casa (house), cosa (thing), cubo
(cube); gamba (leg), gola (throat), gusto (taste). They also have a hard sound
when followed by h, as in che (that) and ghiaccio (ice).
 c and g have a soft sound before e and i: cera (wax), cinema (cinema); 
gelo (freeze), giro (turn).
Adding an i before a, o, or u makes the sound soft, as in ciao (hello) and gioia (joy).
Adding an h before e and i makes the sound hard, as in che (that) and chi (who).
In Romance languages, accents can make a big difference. In Italian, you write the
accent only on vowels, and only in the following cases:
 The accent falls on the vowel at the end of the last syllable, as in città (city) and
virtù (virtue).
 Adding an accent helps avoid confusion with other words, as with la (the, her)
and là (there); da (from, by) and dà (he gives).
10
Part I: Getting Your Bearings: Reviewing the Basics 

Morphology: Word structure and 
variations in word forms
In Italian and English, morphology is the study of the inner structure of words, the
forms they can take, and the functions they can serve when you use them in speech
or writing. But language has thousands of words! Are you supposed to study their
form, structure, and function one by one? Your work would never end! Luckily, gram-
marians have clustered words according to the basic function they play in the lan-
guage. So before telling you a bit more about forms and functions of words, I tell you
how they’re grouped into the parts of speech.
Identifying the nine parts of speech
English has eight parts of speech, and Italian has nine, as listed in Table 1-1.

The terms of agreement: A few more details about word forms
When you know what part of speech a word is, you can ask questions regarding its
form, structure, and function. The answers to those questions enable you to start
using those words correctly with one another.
To start, you can ask questions about
 Gender: Does the word you’re looking at have a gender or not? And which one?
In both English and Italian, names used for people and animals have gender
(Paolo [Paul] or Anna [Anna]), as do pronouns (lui [he] and lei [she]).
But in Italian, a lot of other words have a gender, too, either masculine or feminine:
• Nouns and articles, as in il gatto (the male cat) or la gatta (the female cat)
• Adjectives, as in bello (beautiful) or bella (beautiful)
• Past participles, as in andato (gone, referring to a singular masculine noun)
or andata (gone, referring to a singular feminine noun)
 Number: Is the word singular or plural? In other words, does it vary in number?
Examples of number change include il gatto (the cat) →i gatti (the cats); la
ragazza (the girl) →le ragazze (the girls).
 Person: What’s the grammatical person of the agent performing the action — the
speaker (first person), the one spoken to (second person), or someone else
(third person)? Italian and English have six grammatical persons: three singular
and three plural.
In the sentences that follow, identify the underlined part of speech and write it next to
the sentence. Then translate the sentence into English.
Q. Mauro e Giovanna ballano il tango.

7. Siete partiti in orario? _____________________________________________________________
8. Mi hanno dato una buona ricetta. ___________________________________________________
9. Non ci hanno ascoltato. ____________________________________________________________
Conjugating verbs
In Italian, verbs take a lot of different forms. A verb can change according to
 Which one of the six grammatical persons is performing the action
 When that action occurs (time)
 What feeling the action conveys (mood)
 Whether the subject is performing the action (active voice), is being acted upon
(passive voice), or is acting upon itself (reflexive voice)
 Whether the verbal form is finite (such as indicative or subjunctive), meaning
that it conveys a specific subject; or nonfinite (such as infinitive or gerund),
meaning that it doesn’t convey a specific subject
Italian verbs take different forms depending on all the criteria in the preceding list.
When you change the ending of the verb according to those criteria, you conjugate
the verb. The families of verbs that behave in the same way are called conjugations.
When it comes to Italian verb conjugations, you encounter the following:
 Three regular conjugations with the infinitive form of the verbs ending in
• -are: guardare (to look at)
• -ere: temere (to fear)
• -ire: sentire (to hear, to feel)
 Regular verbs that change spelling: giocare (to play) →giochiamo (we play)
 Irregular verbs, which may change
• Stem: andare (to go) →vado (I go)
• Ending (when you compare it to the endings of regular forms): cadere
(to fall) →caddi (I fell), not cadei or cadetti
• Both stem and ending: vivere (to live) →vissi (I lived)
You need to know all the verb forms in order to convey time and mood correctly and
to match the verb with the subject. When the verbal form includes a past participle,
you have to decide whether you can leave it in its default form, which is the mascu-
line singular (as in amato [loved]), or you have to coordinate its ending with the sub-
ject or the object of the sentence, choosing among amato, amata, amati, and amate
(loved). See Chapter 10 for details.
14
Part I: Getting Your Bearings: Reviewing the Basics 

If you want to acquire full command of verb conjugations, learn them by heart.
Choose mood and tense, and then conjugate a verb in the three persons (in both sin-
gular and plural), with or without the subject pronouns. Repeat the conjugation in a
singsong manner on the treadmill, while you’re driving, or before falling asleep. For
example, the simple or historic past of essere is [io] fui, [tu] fosti, [lui] fu ([I] was,
[you] were, [he] was); [noi] fummo, [voi] foste, [loro] furono ([we] were, [you] were,
[they] were) — and remember to breathe! You need to say the verbal forms, not just
repeat them in your mind in order for them to stick. With practice, you may find your-
self pleasantly surprised when you need the Italian counterpart of we were and it just
pops into your mind: noi fummo!
Table 1-2 gives you a sense of how many moods and tenses Italian verbs can take and
gives you their English counterparts. I also provide short examples of how you use
that tense and mood in context, and I refer you to the chapters in this book that I
devote specifically to the tense in question.

Syntax: Putting words in order
Syntax tells how you can put words together to form phrases, sentences, and groups
of sentences in a meaningful way. In this section, you go through some syntax-related
terminology and review some basic rules of syntax.
Syntax lingo
This section presents some terms related to syntax so you that can choose the appro-
priate form and structure for your words, phrases, and sentences. A phrase is a group of
words without a subject or a verb that forms a unit of meaning within a sentence. The
term is often used to describe a prepositional phrase, such as per caso (by chance).
A clause is a group of words that includes a verb, such as noi preghiamo (we pray). In
Italian, you rarely use subject pronouns because the verb ending already tells you
which person is doing the action, so even the single word preghiamo (we pray) is a
clause. Usually the verb is in a finite form — in other words, in one of the moods and
tenses that can take a specific subject.
Clauses can be independent or dependent:
 They’re independent when they’re meaningful by themselves, as in noi 
preghiamo (we pray).
 They’re dependent when they need to lean on an independent clause to convey a
complete meaning. For example, . . . che le piace il gelato (. . . that she likes ice
cream) needs an introduction — So che le piace il gelato (I know that she likes
ice cream).
When you add dependent clauses to an independent one, you can classify the clauses
on the basis of the meaning they convey:
 Declarative clauses introduced by che (that)
 Hypothetical clauses introduced by se (if, whether)
 Causal clauses introduced by perché (because)
Chapter 8 covers coordinating and subordinating conjunctions and relative clauses in
detail, and Chapter 15 addresses declarative and if . . . then clauses.
A sentence is a group of words that convey a complete thought, and it’s made up of
one or more clauses and punctuation. One word may be enough, such as when you
say, Vai! (Go!). In Italian, the subject is understood thanks to the form the verb takes,
but the exclamation mark is essential, because if you take it away and leave vai (you
go), you’re no longer issuing an order; rather, you’re making a statement of fact.
Sentences can be simple, compound, or complex:
 A simple sentence is a single independent clause: Lei gioca a palla. (She’s play-
ing ball.)
 A compound sentence consists of multiple independent clauses joined together
using coordinating conjunctions (see Chapter 8): Vanno in Russia ma non vanno a
San Pietroburgo. (They’re going to Russia, but they’re not going to St. Petersburg.)
17
Chapter 1: What Do You Know? Parts of Speech and Then Some

 A complex sentence consists of one or more independent clauses with at least one
dependent clause linked to the main one through subordinating conjunctions (see
Chapter 8): Se ti piace il pesce, quel ristorante è molto buono. 
(If you like fish, that is an excellent restaurant.)
The clauses also may be joined by a relative pronoun.
Basic syntax rules
Knowing syntax enables you to put words together so that you can say what you want
to say. Italian and English share some basic syntax rules:
 To build a sentence you put words in sequence in four basic ways:
• Subject + verb: Anna dorme. (Anna is sleeping.)
• Subject + verb + qualifier of the subject: Lisa è professoressa di storia.
(Lisa is professor of history.); Ugo è astuto. (Ugo is cunning.)
• Subject + verb + object: Mario compra un libro. (Mario is buying a book.)
• Subject + verb + prepositional phrase(s): Lucia viene al cinema con noi.
(Lucia will come to the movies with us.)
 The crucial syntactical distinction is the distinction between independent
clauses and dependent clauses. For instance, io vado (I’m going) is an inde-
pendent clause; se vuoi (if you want) is not. The tense and mood of the inde-
pendent clause determines the tense and mood of the dependent clause. For
example, it’s meaningless to say Sono andato al mercato perché ne ho voglia 
(I went to the farmers’ market because I wish to). You have to say either Sono
andato al mercato perché ne avevo voglia (I went to the farmers’ market because
I wished to) or Vado al mercato perché ne ho voglia (I’m going to the farmers’
market because I wish to).
Italian and English differ in the following ways:
 English uses the progressive form (I’m going, I was going, I will be going, and so
on) much more than Italian, which uses only Io sto andando (I’m going), Io stavo
andando (I was going), and Staranno andando (They’re likely to be going).
 In the past tense, English doesn’t distinguish between the imperfetto (imperfect)
and the preterit (past definite), as in Io leggevo il libro/Io lessi il libro 
(I read the book).
 In the past tense, Italian uses the passato prossimo (present perfect) in most
cases when English uses the simple past.
 English no longer uses the subjunctive, except in set phrases such as Esigo che
lui mi risponda (I demand that he answer me). Italian uses it quite a lot (see
Chapters 14 and 15).
 English changes the word order and uses auxiliaries (helping verbs) to ask ques-
tions; Italian doesn’t. For example, Lei andava all’università (She went to college)
becomes a question in Italian: Lei andava all’università? (Did she go to college?).
 English uses auxiliaries to modify verb tenses, such as in the future and the con-
ditional; Italian doesn’t. For example, Venderanno la barca (They’ll sell the boat);
Mi impresteresti la moto? (Would you lend me your motorbike?).

 English favors the active voice over the passive voice more than Italian. For
example, in Italian you may say La forma passiva sarà studiata dagli studenti
(The passive form will be studied by the boys and girls), but English prefers 
I ragazzi studieranno la forma passiva (The boys and girls will study the 
passive form).

Getting the Most Out of Dictionaries
If you don’t know how to translate a word, you can look it up in a bilingual dictionary,
but even in simple cases, you have to be careful to get the right word. Suppose you
want to know how to say cat in Italian. You find gatto (male cat) in your dictionary,
but you need to be aware that you also can use gatta (female cat). Here’s another
example: Suppose you’re translating a recipe. You need to be aware that in Italian,
celery has a sort of leg — un gambo di sedano (a stalk of celery, masculine noun) —
just as flowers do (stem). But a human or table leg is la gamba (feminine noun).
In electronic dictionaries, you can find a word by entering only a few letters, trigger-
ing the program to list all the possible combinations. But remember that if you look
for facessero, for example, you may not find it. You see similar forms, making it easier
19
Chapter 1: What Do You Know? Parts of Speech and Then Some

to understand that facessero is a form of the verb fare. Of course, you can enter
entire words and check dictionaries online. A lot of results pop up based on your
entry, which helps you see the word in context. Such tools also help you check your
grammar. For example, do you say Me piace? or Mi piace? (Do I like it?) Many more
entries surface under mi piace, which is likely to be correct. But beware that the
majority answer isn’t always correct.
Use online translations only to acquire a general idea of the topic in question, not to
find a reliable translation.
Navigating a monolingual Italian dictionary
Here are some points to remember when you check an entry in an Italian dictionary:
 All verbs are listed in the infinitive. To find the infinitive when the verb is in
another mood and tense, you need to distinguish between the stem of the verb
and its possible endings. For help in this area, consult Parts III and IV for regular
and irregular endings and Chapter 17 for reflexive verbs.
 The masculine singular is the default gender. In an Italian dictionary, adjectives
and other qualifiers that can vary in gender and/or number are listed in the mascu-
line singular (unless they exist only in the feminine, such as la spia [spy]). For exam-
ple, no/no one is listed under nessuno. Only the examples in the entry indicate (if
you don’t know it already) that you can use nessuna (feminine singular). Similarly,
red is listed as rosso (red), even though it can become rossa, rossi, and rosse.
In an Italian dictionary, you find both gatto and gatta, but if you check only gatto,
you get no warning that an entry for gatta exists. When in doubt, check for a fem-
inine version of a masculine noun (or vice versa) and its meaning (as in the case
of il gambo [stalk, stem] and la gamba [leg]).
 A dictionary tells you whether a verb is transitive, intransitive, or reflexive.
This information is crucial because it affects most aspects of verb conjugation
and use, as you see in Chapters 10 and 17.
 In a complete Italian dictionary, all irregular verbal forms are listed in any
mood and tense only in the first person that carries that irregularity. If you look
up facessi (that I did), the dictionary sends you to the verb fare (to do, to make).
But it doesn’t do so for facessero (that they did). On the other hand, you find both
feci (I did), which is first-person singular, simple past of the indicative, and facesti
(you did), which is second-person singular, because they’re the first instances of
two different irregular patterns. But you don’t find facemmo (we did).
 You only find entries of present and past participles that are also used as
adjectives or nouns. For example, you find cantante (singer) but not guardante
(looking), amato (loved) but not ballato (danced).
Navigating a bilingual Italian-English/
English-Italian dictionary
Here follow two (shortened) entries for the verb parlare (to speak) from a sizeable
English-Italian/Italian-English dictionary, such as you might use at this stage of your
20

knowledge of the language. The English entry for to speak comes first, followed by the
Italian entry for parlare:
speak [spi:k]. v. (pret. spoke, p.p. spoken) I. v.i. 1 parlare: to learn to speak:
imparare a parlare; 2 (to converse) parlare (to, with con, a) conversare (con), dis-
correre (con); (to communicate vocally) parlare a. 3 (to make a speech) parlare,
tenere un discorso II v.t. 1 dire, pronunciare, esprimere 2 (of a language) parlare,
sapere, conoscere: to ~ six languages, parlare sei lingue 3 (to reveal) esprimere,
dire, rivelare. [idioms] to ~ for, parlare a nome di, to ~ of parlare di: he spoke of his
problems parlò dei suoi problemi; to ~ out parlar chiaro
parlare I v.i. (aus. avere) 1 to speak, to talk: chi ha parlato? who spoke? 2 (avere
un colloquio) to speak (con with, to), to talk (to), 3 (tenere un discorso) to speak, to
make a speech, 4 (fare oggetto di chiacchiere) to talk, to gossip II v.t. to speak:
parla bene il tedesco he speaks German well parlarsi v.r. (recipr.) 1 to speak to 
e.o. 2 (pop) (amoreggiare) to go together, to go steady [idioms] ~ chiaro to speak
clearly; ~ di fare una cosa to talk about doing something
Both entries tell you that the verbs in question are used first of all intransitively, v.i.
(meaning by themselves or with an indirect object), but also transitively, v.t. (mean-
ing by themselves or with a direct object), and that the Italian verb can take the
reflexive (v.r.) form with a reciprocal meaning. They tell you what prepositions you
need (a, con, to, with) when you want to convey the person you’re addressing. They
give you variations on the basic meaning of the verb and some idiomatic expressions,
in particular phrasal verbs in English (verbs whose meaning is modified by a preposi-
tion that always follows them, such as to speak out), which in Italian you have to convey
with a turn of phrase.
Two points about these entries are worth noting:
 The two entries don’t match one another exactly. In the English entry, you find
out that to speak out is parlar chiaro, but in the Italian entry you find out that
the translation of parlare chiaro is to speak clearly. Why? Because the English
part of the dictionary was written by linguist A and the Italian part of the diction-
ary was written by linguist B, and no one reconciled the two. Don’t conclude that
this is a poorly written dictionary. It’s a very good one. You’ll find inconsisten-
cies or incomplete entries in any dictionary. (Trust me.)
 The English side tells you what form the strong verb to speak takes in the past
tense and the past participle, but it doesn’t tell you what auxiliary the Italian
verb parlare needs, a crucial piece of information for using verbs in Italian. The
Italian side does the opposite.
Keep in mind these five rules of thumb when using a bilingual dictionary:
 Use an English-Italian/Italian-English dictionary so that you can check entries
from English into Italian and from Italian into English.
 A dictionary doesn’t substitute for knowing what to do with the information you
find. If you don’t find a listing for the auxiliary of a verb, you need to know at
least that.
 Use both a bilingual dictionary and two monolingual dictionaries to acquire a full
picture of the word you’re checking. That’s heavy-duty, so the following is less
ponderous and more effective: When you find a word you don’t know, look at the
21
Chapter 1: What Do You Know? Parts of Speech and Then Some

context in which it’s used. Then use that word often to fix it in your mind. For
example, you say Gioco a carte, a calcio, a tennis (I play cards, soccer, and
tennis) but Suono il pianoforte (I play the piano).
 Beware of false friends, which are words that look the same but have different
meanings (see Chapter 18). A galleria is both a tunnel and an art gallery in Italian,
so the road sign Accendere i fari in galleria (Turn on beams in tunnel) doesn’t
mean that you must turn on the lights if you go to the Museum of Modern Art!
 Languages are full of idioms — that is, phrases and sentences used figuratively
that you may misunderstand or fail to understand even if you know all the words
they use. For example, prendere qualcuno per la gola doesn’t mean to grab
someone by his or her throat but rather to win over someone by feeding that
person what he or she likes best. Gola here translates to gluttony, not throat.
Complete dictionaries help you sort out the most common idioms, as do special-
ized publications devoted both to idioms and false friends.

Noun and Article Basics: 
Gender and Number
In This Chapter
 Sorting out definite and indefinite articles
 Drawing the line between masculine and feminine nouns
 Working with plural nouns and articles
N
ouns serve similar purposes in English and Italian, but in English, nouns don’t
have a gender, whereas in Italian, they can be masculine or feminine. When
Italian nouns refer to things or abstractions, their grammatical gender is merely 
a product of convention and usage: sole (sun) is masculine, but luna (moon) is 
feminine. At times nouns are masculine or feminine because they refer to a male or
female person or animal. In this chapter, I show you how to distinguish between 
feminine and masculine nouns and how to move from the masculine to the feminine
(and vice versa when changing gender is possible).
In many cases, you can make out the gender of a noun from its ending. But in a lot of
cases, you can’t. You have to know a noun’s gender by heart or by looking at clues in
other words that accompany the noun. Because the clearest indicator of gender is the
definite article (corresponding to the English the), in this chapter, I start with articles
and then introduce nouns.
As in English, Italian nouns can be singular or plural. Most follow regular patterns, but
some behave irregularly or come only in the singular or the plural. I show you how to
form the plural and how to reconstruct the singular masculine form of a noun.
Because the masculine is usually the default gender in Italian, you find words listed in
that gender in dictionaries.
A Primer on Articles
Looking at nouns out of context is useful for helping you understand the general rules
that govern grammar, but because you need to know each noun’s gender and because
the most reliable indicator of a noun’s gender is the definite article, I devote this first
section to articles.

English has a definite and an indefinite article — the and a/an respectively — as does
Italian. With the definite article, you point to a specific item, as in Il bambino è
caduto dall’altalena (The child fell off the swing). With the indefinite article, you point
to one thing among many like things, as in Leggi un libro? (Are you reading a book?).
Memorize new nouns with their articles to make sure you know their gender as well.
Dealing with the definite article “the”
In Italian, articles vary in gender, number, and spelling. English and Italian use the 
definite article to point to a specific thing or person:
Il libro è sul tavolo. (The book [we are/were talking about] is on the table.)
I bambini stanno giocando in giardino. (The children are playing in the garden.)
Table 2-1 provides the three forms of the definite article, il, lo, and l’, which you use
with singular masculine nouns. It also presents the two forms of the masculine plural
definite article, i and gli, which you use with plural masculine nouns.

Part I: Getting Your Bearings: Reviewing the Basics 

The feminine l’ is the same as la but with the -a replaced by an apostrophe. Likewise,
the masculine l’ is the same as lo but with the -o replaced by an apostrophe.
In Italian, the definite article can play the role the possessive adjective plays in
English, as in Cerco la borsa (I’m looking for my handbag). (See Chapter 7 for more on
possessive words.)
Saying “a” or “an” in Italian: 
Indefinite articles
Besides the definite article, Italian uses the indefinite articles un, un’, una, and uno,
which correspond to the English a or an. Because un means one, you can use it only
with singular nouns, as in una villa (a villa) or un paese (a country). Table 2-3 lays out
the forms of the indefinite article used with singular masculine nouns, and Table 2-4
does the same for the feminine article.

Distinguishing between Masculine 
and Feminine Nouns
In most Indo-European languages (the family to which both Italian and English belong),
nouns have a gender. In Italian, you deal with only two genders: masculine and feminine.
Other parts of speech have a gender as well, and as you progress through this book, you
discover how to match these other words to the gender of the noun.
27
Chapter 2: Noun and Article Basics: Gender and Number

This section focuses on nouns, discussing what word endings tell you about gender
and which words can and should undergo a gender change.
Recognizing common noun endings
In Italian, most nouns are masculine or feminine. Grammatically, their endings in the
singular help you figure out to which gender they belong. Masculine nouns often end
in the following:
 -o: letto (bed), libro (book), giorno (day), gatto (male cat), buco (hole)
 A consonant: autobus (bus), sport (sport), bar (bar), chef (chef, cook), zar (czar)
However, some nouns ending in -o are feminine, such as auto (automobile), radio
(radio), mano (hand), and moto (motorbike). So are some foreign words, especially
when they translate an Italian word that has the same meaning, such as star del
cinema (film star).
Feminine nouns often end in
 -a: barca (boat), ora (hour), pianta (plant, tree)
 -i: analisi (analysis), crisi (crisis), tesi (thesis), diagnosi (diagnosis)
 -tà or -tù: bontà (goodness), virtù (virtue), verità (truth)
Some nouns ending in -a are masculine because they derive from classical Greek:
problema (problem), tema (theme), and programma (program).
Some words have a masculine and a feminine version, with different meanings. For
example, il buco (hole), la buca (pit, hole in golf); il foglio (sheet of paper), la foglia
(leaf); il fine (aim, goal), la fine (end); il capitale (financial capital), la capitale
(capital city).
Both masculine and feminine nouns can end in -e, but I can’t give you any general rule
that explains why some are masculine and others feminine. For example, sole (sun) is
masculine, and notte (night) is feminine — so just have a dictionary on-hand until
you’re more familiar with noun gender.
Decide whether the following nouns are masculine or feminine and mark an M or F on
the corresponding blank lines.

Sorting nouns into three classes
When it comes to gender, you find three classes of nouns in Italian:
 Nouns that are gender-specific: If the individual in question is male, you use one
word: il padre (father); if it’s female, use another word: la madre (mother).
 Nouns that can move from masculine to feminine: The masculine is the default
gender, so you tend to look up a noun in the masculine and then see whether you
make a feminine noun out of it: Lo zio (uncle) becomes la zia (aunt). In real life,
of course, you may encounter a noun in the feminine first and then wonder
whether it has a masculine version. It usually does, but the masculine may be
really different from the feminine: La dottoressa (female doctor/graduate) doesn’t
become il dottoresso but rather il dottore (male doctor/graduate).
 Nouns that are used for males and females but don’t change: La guida (guide)
is feminine, but it’s used for men, too; il soprano (soprano) is masculine, but it’s
used for women.
Gender-specific nouns
Some nouns are gender-specific — that is, you use different words to refer to mascu-
line and feminine variations of the noun. See Table 2-5 for a sampling of these nouns.
Table 2-5
Nouns that Indicate the Gender of the Individual
Masculine Noun
Feminine Noun
il padre (father)
la madre (mother)
il papà (dad)
la mamma (mom)
il fratello (brother)
la sorella (sister)
il marito (husband)
la moglie (wife)
il genero (son-in-law)
la nuora (daughter-in-law)
l’uomo (man)
la donna (woman)
il porco (pig, boar)
la scrofa (sow)
il toro (bull)
la vacca (cow)
Universal nouns that change the article (and sometimes the ending) 
to switch gender
For nouns that aren’t gender-specific, you take the masculine noun and change either
the article alone or the article and the ending to make the noun feminine. This change
can play out in several ways, depending on the spelling of the masculine noun. 
Table 2-6 breaks down the possibilities.

Some names of professions or people’s titles change the final -e to -a: il cameriere
(waiter), la cameriera (waitress), il signore (gentleman, Sir), la signora (lady, Madam,
Ms.). There’s neither rhyme nor reason to why these nouns take -a instead of -essa,
except, perhaps, ease of pronunciation: Camerieressa sounds horrible.
And newly invented words take either -essa or -a: l’avvocato (male lawyer), l’avvo-
catessa (female lawyer); l’architetto (male architect), l’architetta (female architect).
How do you know whether a word is a new word? Practice and a dictionary.
Nouns used for both males and females
Some masculine nouns can refer to females, and some feminine nouns can refer to
males. Nouns that are always masculine, regardless of the gender of the animal or
person described include il pavone (peacock), il serpente (snake), and il cicerone
(tour guide).
Some nouns that are always feminine, regardless of the gender of the animal or
person described, are la tigre (tiger), la volpe (fox), and la spia (spy).
To distinguish between male and female animals, add the words maschio (male) and
femmina (female) to the basic noun:

Moving from Singular to Plural: Basic Rules
As in English, Italian nouns can become plural by changing the ending, and the plural
of nouns varies depending on the ending of the singular. Table 2-7 illustrates the regu-
lar patterns.
Table 2-7
Regular Plural Noun Endings
Masculine

-e: chiave (key)
-i: chiavi (keys)
-a: problema
-i: problemi
(problem)
(problems)
Plural and singular nouns share some of the same endings, so it may be difficult to tell
the number and gender of a noun such as sere; after all, -e is an ending for feminine
plural nouns, masculine singular nouns, and feminine singular nouns. If the noun
comes with the article, you know at once: Le sere is the feminine plural of la sera
(evening). If the context doesn’t help you, consult a dictionary (check out Appendix C
for an Italian-English dictionary). Dictionaries list nouns in their default form, usually
the masculine singular form. You can use trial and error until you find the right noun.
Some nouns have both a masculine and a feminine plural, but there’s no rule estab-
lishing which meaning is associated with which gender. You pick up on these 
variations as you encounter them in context. Here are some examples:

Exceptions to the Basic Rules on Number
With language, nothing’s ever quite as simple as it may seem. When you get a rule or
pattern, you have to accept the fact that languages can’t be rationalized beyond a cer-
tain point. This section contains the many exceptions to those rules.
Changing more than just the ending
Some groups of nouns don’t change just the last vowel when you turn them into the
plural but rather change the entire last syllable. Other nouns switch genders. Check
out the following rules:
 Nouns ending in -co, -go, -ca, and -ga, which have a hard sound in the singular,
add an h before the suffix of the plural to preserve it:
cuoco (cook) →cuochi (cooks)
fungo (mushroom) →funghi (mushrooms)
barca (boat) →barche (boats)
strega (witch) →streghe (witches)

The most important words that are exceptions to this rule are medico
(physician) →medici, amico (friend) →amici (friends), and nemico (enemy) →
nemici (enemies). However, the feminine versions — amica (girlfriend) and
nemica (female enemy) — do become amiche (girlfriends) and nemiche (female
enemies). Other words, such as chirurgo (surgeon) →chirurghi/chirurgi
(surgeons) and stomaco (stomach) →stomachi/stomaci (stomachs), can have
either ending.
 Nouns ending in -cia or -gia accented on a syllable that isn’t the last one add -e if
the last syllable is preceded by a consonant, and they add -ie if the last syllable
is preceded by a vowel:
provincia (province) →province (provinces)
spiaggia (beach) →spiagge (beaches)
camicia (shirt) →camicie (shirts)
valigia (suitcase) →valigie (suitcases)
Nouns that end in -cìa or -gìa, accented on the ì, form the plural by adding -ie:
allergia (allergy) →allergie (allergies). However, be aware that the accent isn’t
marked in Italian, so you have to figure out which nouns are accented on the i as
you go along.
 Nouns ending in -io take -ii in the plural if the accent falls on the ì and take only
one -i if the accent falls on a preceding syllable (the accent is not marked):
pendio (slope) →pendii (slopes)
viaggio (trip) →viaggi (trips)
If nouns end in -ia, the plural is regular: biglia (pinball) →biglie (pinballs).
 Some nouns change gender from the singular to the plural. The following words
are among the most frequently used:
il dito (finger, toe) →le dita (fingers, toes)
l’uovo (egg) →le uova (eggs)
il ginocchio (knee) →le ginocchia (knees)
Turn the following nouns from singular to plural, including the article. (I’ve added the
accent when necessary to help you follow the rules outlined.)

Changing only the article
There are some names that are invariable, so you need to check the article to find out
if they’re used in the singular or in the plural form. Some common examples include
the following:
 Masculine nouns: cinema, brindisi, caffè, film
 Feminine nouns: radio, metropolis, città, spezie
Assign the nouns to the following categories: masculine singular (MS), masculine
plural (MP), feminine singular (FS), and feminine plural (FP).

(resignation)
 Nouns that come in the plural from Latin: le nozze (nuptials), le ferie
(paid vacation days), le tenebre (darkness)

Deciding When to Include an Article 
When you’re confident in your knowledge of nouns as they relate to gender and
number, you can move on to when and how to use articles and nouns together.
Deciding when to use the indefinite article is easier because people use it in similar
ways in English and Italian. Also, all you need to know is that you’re singling out one
item among many: Un cane abbaia (A dog is barking).
Becoming confident in using the definite article is more challenging than choosing
when to use the indefinite. In the sections that follow, I indicate the instances when
the use of each type of article is correct and the few when it’s definitely incorrect.
When (and when not) to use a definite article
Deciding when and when not to use the definite article is a tricky topic in both Italian
and English. One rule of thumb is that Italian uses the definite article much more than
English. For example, Italian uses articles before foods (il pane, bread; la mela,
apple), before body parts (il braccio, arm; le dita, finger), before dates (il 25 aprile,
April 25), before titles (il professor Baldini, Professor Baldini) and before abstract
nouns (la forza, strength). It also uses the article before possessive adjectives (la mia
borsa, my handbag) and family members when referred to in the plural (le mie
sorelle, my sister).
People
Articles are used when referring to a professional (il Dott. Cecconi) or before a female
name to express affection and familiarity (La Elena), but they’re not used in direct
address. For example, you use the article when you say Ho visto il Dott. Cecconi
martedì sera (I saw Dr. Cecconi on Tuesday evening), but you don’t use it when you
say Buon giorno, Dott. Cecconi (Good morning, Dr. Cecconi).
Places
You use the Italian definite article with the following geographical features:
 Mountains, rivers, and lakes: le Alpi (the Alps), il Monte Bianco (Mont Blanc), il
Po (the Po River), il [lago di] Garda (Lake Garda), il lago Michigan (Lake
Michigan)
 Many large islands and archipelagos: la Sicilia (Sicily), l’Inghilterra (England), le
Bahamas (the Bahamas); but skip the article for Long Island (Long Island) and
Cuba (Cuba)
 Regions and states: il Lazio (the Lazio region), la Puglia (Apulia), la California
(California)
 Nations (singular or plural) and continents: l’Italia (Italy), gli Stati Uniti (the
United States), l’Asia (Asia)
Italian doesn’t use the definite article before names of cities and most small islands:
Bologna, Roma (Rome), New York, Capri, Malta.
35
Chapter 2: Noun and Article Basics: Gender and Number

The rules for articles change when prepositions and idiomatic expressions are used.
With idiomatic usage, you don’t use an article with a preposition unless the object of
the preposition is modified and then the preposition is contracted. For example, you
don’t use an article when you say Vado in Italia (I’m going to Italy), but you do use an
article when you say Vado nell’Italia centrale (I’m going to central Italy).
Things
Use the definite article with the following things:
 Countable plural nouns: Le scimmie e le mucche sono mammiferi. (literally:
Monkeys and cows are mammals.)
 Uncountable nouns: il sale (salt), lo zucchero (sugar), l’acqua (water)
In English, uncountable nouns take the definite article only when you mean a
type of or a portion of something, as in Mi passi il sale, per favore? (Can I have
the salt, please?); but when you talk (in English) about salt, sugar, water, and so
on in general, you use neither the definite nor the indefinite article. In Italian, you
have to use the definite article.
 Possessive adjectives and pronouns: La nostra macchina è rossa (Our car is
red); La macchina rossa è la nostra (The red car is ours).
 Firms, institutions, and clubs: la General Motors (General Motors), la Chiesa
(the Church), la Roma (Roma Football Club).
 Abstractions: La tolleranza è fondamentale in democrazia. (Toleration is funda-
mental in democracies.)
When (and when not) to use 
an indefinite article
Although Italian uses the indefinite article much the same as English does, in some
situations where an indefinite article is appropriate in English, Italian leaves it out.
Consider the following situations where you’d leave out the indefinite article:
 When using a noun as a qualifier of the subject after the verbs essere (to be): Mia
madre è vedova (My mother is a widow); Suo fratello è medico (Her brother is a
physician).
 In exclamations introduced by che and quanto (how): Che uomo coraggioso!
(What a courageous man!)
Fill in the appropriate definite or indefinite article (if any) in the following sentences.

Chapter 3
Numbers, Dates, and Time
In This Chapter
 Counting and establishing numbered order
 Making accurate references to the calendar and the clock
You count the calories you eat and the minutes spent on the treadmill. You check
appointments ten times a day and celebrate anniversaries. Numbers are a central
part of your life, and fortunately, numerals are used all over the world these days. But
when you spell out numbers or talk about them, you use different words, and each
language has its own words and conventions to separate integers and decimals, to
talk about centuries, and to tell the time.
In this chapter, I help you express quantities such as 25, 149, and even 2,689,365.00!
You also find out how to set things in numerical order — first, second, third, and so
on — and how to manage time and dates (or at least write about them).
Counting Items with Cardinal Numbers
If you say that you’ve seen ten movies, you’re using a cardinal number — that is, a
number that conveys an absolute quantity. When written in full, numbers are invari-
able in Italian, and you form them more or less as you form numbers in English. The
first ten each have their own names. Those between 11 and 19 add the suffix -dici or
the prefix dici[a]-, which both mean ten. Starting with 21, you encounter the pattern
that you repeat from 30 to 99. Following are the numbers from 0 through 29.
 zero (0)
 uno (1)
 due (2)
 tre (3)
 quattro (4)
 cinque (5)
 sei (6)
 sette (7)
 otto (8)
 nove (9)
 dieci (10)
 undici (11)
 dodici (12)
 tredici (13)
 quattordici (14)
 quindici (15)
 sedici (16)
 diciassette (17)
 diciotto (18)
 diciannove (19)
 venti (20)
 ventuno (21)
 ventidue (22)
 ventitré (23)
 ventiquattro (24)
 venticinque (25)
 ventisei (26)
 ventisette (27)
 ventotto (28)
 ventinove (29)

When you add 1, 2, 3, and so on to numbers from 20 to 29, you drop the i when the
following number starts with another vowel; otherwise, you keep the vowel and
simply add the number:
42
Part I: Getting Your Bearings: Reviewing the Basics 
 trenta + uno = trentuno (31)
 trenta + due = trentadue (32)
 quaranta + sette = quarantasette (47)
 quaranta + otto = quarantotto (48)
 cinquanta + uno = cinquantuno (51)
 cinquanta + quattro = 
cinquantaquattro (54)
 sessanta + otto = sessantotto (68)
 sessanta + nove = sessantanove (69)
Except for tre (3), all numbers ending in -tré carry an accent, such as trentatré (33)
and settantatré (73).
Table 3-1 lists multiples of 10 and 100. You build numbers from 200 to 900 as you do in
English, by adding -cento to any of the first ten numbers, as in duecento (200). For
numbers between 200 and 999, add any other number to the number you’ve just
formed, as in trecentoquarantatré (343). You write them as one word.
Directly after the word cento (100), you add -uno and -otto without dropping any
vowel, even if another vowel follows, as in centouno (101) and centootto (108). You
add all the other numbers without modifying them: 117 is centodiciassette, and 148 is
centoquarantotto.
Table 3-1
Cardinal Numbers with Double and Triple Digits
Multiples of 10
Multiples of 100
Numbers 101–909

ottanta (80)
ottocento (800)
ottocentootto (808)
novanta (90)
novecento (900)
novecentonove (909)
In Italian, 1,000 is mille. For numbers between 1,000 and 1,999, you add hundreds to
mille-. For example, to write 1,100, you add 100 to mille- and get millecento. To write
1,999, you add 999 to 1,000 and get millenovencentonovantanove.
To form higher numbers, you use -mila (thousand) as follows:
 To form thousands, you add units from 2 to 9: duemila (2,000), cinquemila (5,000)
 To form tens of thousands, you add tens, from 10 to 90: undicimila (11,000),
trentamila (30,000), sessantamila (60,000)

 To form hundreds of thousands, you add hundreds, from 100 to 900: duecentomila
(200,000), settecentomila (700,000)
When you write numbers as numerals, you use a period to separate thousands and a
comma to separate integers from decimals — basically, the opposite of the punctua-
tion in English. For example, 1.000.543,25 corresponds to 1,000,543.25. When saying
the number, you read the comma as virgola, as in un milionecinquecentoquaranta-
tremila virgola venticinque.
When you get to un milione (1,000,000), you write it as two separate words, but you
link all the lower numbers together and then to the word milione, as in 1.300.000: un
milionetrecentomila (1,300,000.00).
Milione, bilione, and trilione take the plural, as in quindici milioni di euro (fifteen
million euros).
When you use cardinal numbers to express a measurement  you place them after the
measurement symbols: cm. 22 (22 centimeters), kg. 84 (84 kilos).
In both numerals and when spelled out, write the cardinal numbers that come before
and after the numbers listed.

Putting Items in Order with Ordinal Numbers
With ordinal numbers, you set things in order, using them to establish ranking. The
first ten have special forms:
44
Part I: Getting Your Bearings: Reviewing the Basics 
 primo (1st)
 secondo (2nd)
 terzo (3rd)
 quarto (4th)
 quinto (5th)
 sesto (6th)
 settimo (7th)
 ottavo (8th)
 nono (9th)
 decimo (10th)
In Italian, ordinal numbers behave like adjectives in that they need to match in gender
and number with the nouns or pronouns they refer to. You form ordinal numbers
above decimo by adding the ending -esimo (masculine singular), -esima (feminine 
singular), -esimi (masculine plural), or -esime (feminine plural) to the corresponding
cardinal number (see the preceding section).
Following are some ordinal numbers from 11th to 100th, in the standard masculine
singular form:
 primo (1st)
 undicesimo (11th)
 dodicesimo (12th)
 tredicesimo (13th)
 quattordicesimo (14th)
 quindicesimo (15th)
 sedicesimo (16th)
 diciassettesimo (17th)
 diciottesimo (18th)
 diciannovesimo (19th)
 ventesimo (20th)
 trentesimo (30th)
 quarantesimo (40th)
 cinquantesimo (50th)
 sessantesimo (60th)
 settantesimo (70th)
 ottantesimo (80th)
 novantesimo (90th)
 centesimo (100th)
When you use an ordinal number in the context of a sentence, you usually place it
before the word it refers to, accompanied by the article; for example, Le chiavi sono
nel terzo cassetto (The keys are in the third drawer).
You can write an ordinal number using numerals followed by a superscript letter
related to the ordinal number’s ending. That is, you use o for primo (first) and a for
prima (first). For example, you write il 1o maggio (May 1st).
When you use a Roman numeral — for example, in a person’s name or title (Pope
John Paul II, Thurston Howell III) or when you talk about il XVIII secolo (the 

eighteenth century) — you read that numeral as an ordinal number. For example,
you’d say Papa Giovanni Paolo Secondo (Pope John Paul the Second).
Rewrite the cardinal number in parentheses using the corresponding ordinal number
when appropriate. When the number doesn’t indicate a date or a century, write it out
in full.

A. Colombo esplorò l’America centrale nel XV secolo. (Columbus explored Central America in

Managing Your Calendar and Your Time
You live in the age of digital planners, e-mail appointment reminders, cellular phones
with calendars and flight schedules, and clocks on every possible gadget. That’s why
it’s pretty important to know how to handle information about time, starting with cen-
turies and proceeding to years, seasons, months, days of the week, hours, minutes,
and seconds.
Il calendario: The calendar
The U.S. and Italy (and the entire world) share the same calendar. Here follows the
vocabulary you use to talk about centuries, years, seasons, months, dates, and days
of the week.
Secoli, anni e stagioni: Centuries, years, and seasons
In Italian as in English, you refer to a century with Roman numerals as opposed to
ordinal numbers. The Italian word for century is secolo, so when speaking about a
century, you say the Roman numeral as an ordinal number, followed by secolo:
Newton visse nel XVIII (diciottesimo) secolo (Newton lived in the eighteenth century).
See the earlier section on ordinal numbers for details on writing ordinal numbers.
If you’re referring to a particular year, you add the definite article to the cardinal number
indicating the year, as in il 2000 (the year 2000); when you need a preposition, you use
the form combined with the article (see Chapter 6), as in nel 1945 (in 1945). You can 
45
Chapter 3: Numbers, Dates, and Time

say il 1968/il millenovecentosessantotto (nineteen sixty-eight) or il ’68/sessantotto (sixty-
eight), but you can’t say il diciannove sessantotto (nineteen sixty-eight). And you only
use il 2008/duemilaotto (two thousand eight), not lo ’08.
The four seasons are la primavera (spring), l(a)’estate (summer), l(o)’autunno
(autumn), and l(o)’inverno (winter).
Mesi e date: Months and dates
You don’t capitalize the names of the months. They’re all masculine and take il (the),
except agosto (August), which takes l’ (the) (see Chapter 2). Here are the months:
46
Part I: Getting Your Bearings: Reviewing the Basics 
 gennaio (January)
 febbraio (February)
 marzo (March)
 aprile (April)
 maggio (May)
 giugno (June)
 luglio (July)
 agosto (August)
 settembre (September)
 ottobre (October)
 novembre (November)
 dicembre (December)
When mentioning a particular date, you use cardinal numbers, except for the first of the
month, in which case you use the ordinal number primo. You write dates in the day-
month-year format, without commas. For example, you say Oggi è il primo maggio
(Today is May 1st), but you say Partiamo il 15 aprile (We will leave on April 15th).
If you want to know the specific day of the week that something occurred or occurs,
you say In che giorno . . .? (On what day . . .?). If you ask for the date, you usually say
Che giorno è?, which may mean What’s the date? or What’s today? If you need to be
more precise, you can ask Quanti ne abbiamo oggi?, which literally means What’s
today’s number? but is the same as asking Qual è la data di oggi? (What’s today’s
date?). The answer is phrased Oggi è il 29 febbraio (Today is February 29th). And if
you want to know the day of the week, you ask Che giorno è della settimana? (What
day is today?), and the answer is phrased Oggi è venerdì (Today is Friday).
I giorni della settimana: Days of the week
Just as with months, you don’t capitalize the days of the week in Italian. They’re all
masculine and take il, except for la domenica (Sunday). In Italian calendars, the week
starts on Monday. The days from lunedì (Monday) through venerdì (Friday) are 
i giorni feriali (weekdays); la domenica and other holidays are i giorni festivi (festivi-
ties); il sabato (Saturday) and la domenica form il fine settimana/il week-end (week-
end). Here are the days of the week:
 lunedì (Monday)
 martedì (Tuesday)
 mercoledì (Wednesday)
 giovedì (Thursday)
 venerdì (Friday)
 sabato (Saturday)
 domenica (Sunday)
L’ora: The time
If you want to catch a train or a plane, make sure the store is open, or check the
movie theater’s schedule, you need to know the right time. To ask the time, you say
Che ora è/sono? (What time is it?).
When you answer, you can use the 24-hour system (which in the U.S. is usually associ-
ated with the military) or the 12-hour system:

47
Chapter 3: Numbers, Dates, and Time
 You find the 24-hour system printed on schedules and notebook pages, event
programs, and so forth: for example, Il treno parte alle [ore] 15,45/15:45 (The
train leaves at 1545 hours [3:45 p.m.]). When you tell the time this way, you add
minutes to the hour, as in 15:45, which you read as le quindici e quaranta-
cinque. You use this system in everyday life when you want to avoid misunder-
standings or be very formal (for example, if you’re someone’s secretary setting
an appointment for his or her boss).
 Otherwise, you use the 12-hour system. You say Sono le tre e cinquantanove
(It’s 3:59). You can add di mattina (a.m., in the morning) or di pomeriggio/
di sera (p.m., in the afternoon/evening) to avoid misunderstandings, as in
“Partono alle 4.” (“They’re leaving at 4.”)
“Di mattina?!” (“In the morning?!”)
“No! Di pomeriggio.” (“No! In the afternoon.”)
When expressing time, you add the definite article to the number: l’una (1 a.m./p.m.);
le tredici (1 p.m.); le ventuno (9 p.m.). You use the indefinite article in the expression
un quarto a (a quarter to). You coordinate the article with the gender and number of
the hour you’re talking about (see Chapter 2 on gender-number coordination).
You use the verb essere (to be) in the plural with all hours over una (1 a.m.), as in Sono
le tre meno cinque (It’s five minutes to 3 a.m./p.m.). Check out the following examples:
 È l’una (1 a.m./p.m.)
 È mezzogiorno (12 p.m., noon)
 È un quarto a . . . (a quarter to . . .)
 È l’una e tre quarti (It’s a quarter to 1 a.m./p.m.) or È un quarto alle due
(1:45 a.m./p.m).
Check out the following examples of ways in which you can convey fractions of the hour:
 Sono le due e dieci (2:10 a.m/p.m.)
 Sono le otto meno un quarto (a quarter to 8 a.m./p.m.)
 Sono le dieci e un quarto (10:15 a.m./p.m.)
 È l’una e tre quarti, or è un quarto alle due (1:45 a.m./p.m)
 Sono le tre meno cinque (5 minutes to three a.m./p.m.)
 È mezzogiorno (noon, 12 p.m.)
 È mezzanotte (midnight, 12 a.m.)
 Sono le quattro e mezza/o (4:30 a.m./p.m.)
What follows are the first entries in the travel plan of a young woman. Translate the
words she left in English in her travel plan into Italian, using the 24-hour system. Use
the prepositions indicated in parentheses. If you add the definite article, prepositions
form one word with it (see Chapter 2). Rewrite dollar or euro amounts according to
the Italian style (see “Counting Items with Cardinal Numbers” for details).

Parts of Speech

n this part, I guide you through the Italian parts of
speech, starting with pronouns (which are both numer-
ous and complicated). I talk about adjectives and how to
coordinate them with nouns; about prepositions and how
to combine them with the definite article; and how to form
complements — that is, short phrases needed when the
noun by itself can’t carry your meaning. I also talk about
this and that, indefinites such as some and a little, and how
to say that something belongs to you.

I
talian has many types of pronouns, each with a special function. Most pronouns
replace people, places, concepts, and quantities that have already been men-
tioned. Subject pronouns don’t replace anything but rather they convey who’s per-
forming the action. Italian uses pronouns often because they allow you to avoid
repetition and shorten sentences. Here’s an example of a sentence without and with
subject pronouns:
Io ho telefonato a Giovanna. Ho detto a Giovanna che ero stanca. Non credo di
andare al cinema con Giovanna. Purtroppo, Giovanna ha già ordinato i bigli-
etti e io ho già pagato i biglietti. (I called Giovanna. I told Giovanna that I was
tired. I don’t think I’ll go to the movies with Giovanna. Unfortunately, Giovanna
already ordered the tickets and I already paid for the tickets.)
[Io] ho telefonato a Giovanna e le ho detto che ero stanca. Non credo di andare
al cinema con lei. Purtroppo, Giovanna ha già ordinato i biglietti e io li ho
pagati. (I called Giovanna and I told her that I was tired. I don’t think I’ll go to the
movies with her. Unfortunately, she already ordered the tickets and I already paid 
for them.)
Understanding and using Italian pronouns is challenging because they vary so much
in form, positioning, and function, but they’re indispensable, so you need to work
through the tough stuff. In this chapter, I present the various pronouns and the func-
tions they perform. They can be
 Subject pronouns, as in Io ho telefonato a Giovanna (I called Giovanna)
 Stressed pronouns, as in Non credo di andare al cinema con lei (I don’t think I’ll
go to the movies with her)
 Direct object pronouns, as in Li ha già ordinati (She already ordered the tickets)
 Indirect objects pronouns, as in Le ho detto che ero stanca (I told her that I was
tired)

I also talk about two other pronouns that perform a lot of functions in Italian: ci (here,
there, about this/that, of this/that, on this/that) and ne (of/about him/her/them,
of/about this/that). You also may use another set of pronouns, called reflexive pro-
nouns, when the object of the sentence is the same as the subject. In English, it’s
translated with myself, yourself, and so on. Reflexive pronouns don’t substitute
already mentioned concepts, but they’re conjugated directly with the verbs.
In most cases, Italian and English use pronouns in very similar ways, but there are
also some differences:
 Italian uses subject pronouns much less than English. In Italian, you can omit
subject pronouns because the verb conjugation indicates the person performing
the action.
 Italian has several sets of pronouns. Even when they perform the same func-
tion, the object pronouns may change in form, depending on where they’re
placed in the sentence.
 Italian conveys a direct object and an indirect object together by forming
double pronouns.
Reader, Meet the Subject Pronouns
Grammatically speaking, six persons can perform an action: the first, second, and
third persons, singular and plural. But there are more pronouns than persons
because the third person differentiates between masculine, feminine, and neuter
forms (it).
Table 4-1 lists the subject pronouns. Note: In Italian, when animals are seen as pos-
sessing feelings and even a personality, you use pronouns once reserved for human
beings: lui (he), lei (she), and loro (they).
Table 4-1
Subject Pronouns

io (I)
noi (we)
Second

lui (he), lei (she), 
loro (they), 
esso/essa (it)
essi/esse (they)
Third (singular and plural, used 
Lei (you)
Loro (you)
to address people formally)
The traditional subject pronouns for people are egli (he), ella (she), and essi/esse
(they). You may find them used in older writings and formal settings. Today, the third-
person pronouns lui, lei, and loro are used as pronouns.
54
Part II: A Close Look at Parts of Speech 

Knowing when to use them
Most of the time, you don’t use subject pronouns in Italian because the verb conjuga-
tions indicate the subject. In the sentence Guardano la televisione tutte le sere
(They watch TV every night), you know the subject is loro (they) because guardano is
conjugated in the third-person plural form. I cover verb conjugation details in Part III.
At times, you do need subject pronouns. You should use them whenever you’re
 Emphasizing what a particular person is doing: Io darò le dimissioni. (I’m going
to resign.)
 Emphasizing one subject over another (often inverting the word order): Decido
io, non tu, a che ora devi tornare a casa! (I’m the one who decides what time you
must come home, not you!)
 Forming a sentence that may generate confusion about the subject: Lui capisce
cose che io non capisco. (He understands things that I don’t understand.)
Adapting subject pronouns for 
formal and informal usage
In addition, you can address people formally or informally in Italian, altering your pro-
noun and verb choice accordingly:
 Informally, you address people with the following pronoun-verb combinations:
• tu (you singular) + the verb in the second-person singular: [Tu] vieni alla
partita, Andrea? (Are you coming to the game, Andrea?)
• voi (you plural) + the verb in the second-person plural: [Voi] venite alla par-
tita, Andrea e Giacomo? (Are you coming to the game, Andrea and Giacomo?)
 Formally, you address people with the following pronoun-verb combinations:
• Lei (you) with either a man or a woman + the verb in the third-person sin-
gular: [Lei] viene alla partita, Signore/Signora? (Are you coming to the
game, Sir/Madam?)
• Loro (you) + the verb in third-person plural: [Loro] vengono alla partita
Signori/Signore/Signori e Signore? (Are you coming to the game,
Sir/Madam/Ladies and Gentlemen?)
• Nowadays you can use voi (you plural) to address more than one person
informally or formally, as in [Voi] venite alla partita Signori/Signore/
Signori e Signore? (Are you coming to the soccer game, Sir/Madam/ladies
and gentlemen?)
When you address someone formally, you use his or her last name preceded by
Signor (Mr.), Signora (Mrs., Ms.), Signorina (Miss, Ms.), Dottor/Dottoressa (Dr. for all
those with a laurea or university degree), Ingegner (Engineer), Avvocato (Counselor),
and so on with specific professional titles.

Read the following e-mail written to a friend. Taking clues from the verbs, fill in the
blanks with the appropriate subject pronouns.
Q. Caro Marco, ti scrivo da Cortina. _________________ sto bene. Come stai
_________________?
A. Caro Marco, ti scrivo da Cortina. Io sto bene. Come stai tu? (Dear Marco, I’m writing you
from Cortina. I’m well. How are you?)
Stressed Pronouns
Stressed pronouns are most often placed after a preposition, as in Vieni con me al
mercato! (Come to the market with me!). But you also can use them directly after a
verb without a preposition for emphasis, as in La mamma vuole te! (Mom wants you!).
At this stage, to make your life simpler, use the stressed pronoun only when you have
a preposition. For example, Qualcuno ha lasciato un messaggio per te (Someone left
a message for you).
Cara Giulia,
ti scrivo da Cortina. Purtroppo, scrivo (1) _____ perché Elena 
si è fatta male alla mano destra in un’ascensione e (2) _____ 
non potrà scrivere per un po’. A parte questo incidente, (3) 
_____ stiamo tutti bene. Il tempo è splendido e il panorama, 
come (4) _____ sai bene, magnifico. Lo scorso fine settimana i 
miei suoceri sono venuti a trovarci. (5) _____ non sono dei

così (6) _____ sono andato a fare una bella scalata con i miei 
amici. Li conosci anche (7) _____, vero? Spero che l’estate 
prossima tutti (8) _____ potremo stare insieme.
Un abbraccio,
Marco

Table 4-2 demonstrates the forms of the stressed pronouns. As you can see, the only
forms that change from the subject projects are the forms for io (me) and tu (te).
Although only four prepositions are shown here, any preposition can be combined
with a stressed pronoun.

Direct Object Pronouns 
Whereas subject pronouns are sometimes optional, object pronouns aren’t — you rely
on object pronouns to replace objects or people who are recipients of that action —
nice and straightforward. Here are a few key points about direct objects and direct
object pronouns:
57
Chapter 4: All About Pronouns

 Direct objects are those that follow transitive verbs and are called such because
the action affects the object directly, as in Vedo Angela (I see Angela). If you
replace Angela with a pronoun, the sentence becomes La vedo (I see her).
 Direct object pronouns usually answer the questions who? or what?. When you
can answer those questions, you can replace the answer (the direct object) with
a pronoun. For example, Leggo il giornale la domenica (I read the paper on
Sunday): What do I read? The paper. Lo leggo (I read it.) Here’s another example:
Ho invitato i nostri amici a cena (I invited our friends to dinner). Who? Our
friends. Li ho invitati a cena (I invited them to dinner).
 Direct object pronouns can replace people, animals, things, and abstractions.
For example, Il ragazzo accarezza il cucciolo (The boy is petting the puppy), [Lo]
L’accarezza (He is petting it); Quell’uomo ha perso la libertà (That man lost his
freedom), L’ha persa (He lost it).
Table 4-3 shows the direct object pronouns.

La (MS/FS, formal)

ci

vi
you
li/le (MP/FP)
them
Li/Le (MP/FP, formal)
you (plural formal)
When you address someone formally in speech or writing, the direct object pronouns
you use are La (you singular for a man or a woman), Li (you plural) for a group of
men, Le for a group of women, or Li for a group of men and women:
Signore/Signora, La ringrazio di essere venuto/a. (Sir/Madam, thank you for
coming.)
Signori/Signore e Signori, Li ringrazio di essere venuti/e. (Gentlemen/Ladies and
gentlemen, thank you for coming.)
Signore, Le ringrazio di essere venute. (Ladies, thank you for coming.)
In everyday life, the voi (you plural) form is much more commonly used (formally or
informally), which simplifies things considerably. For example, Signore e Signori, vi
ringrazio di essere venuti (Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for coming).
58
Part II: A Close Look at Parts of Speech 

Placement of the direct object pronoun varies according to the verb form:
 The direct object pronoun often precedes the conjugated verb: Quel ragazzo
non dice mai la verità (That boy doesn’t ever tell the truth); Non la dice mai (He
never tells it).
 If the verb is in the infinitive, imperative, or gerund form, you attach the pronoun
to the verb. When attached to the infinitive, the final -e is dropped.
• Infinitive: “Ti piacerebbe comprare la borsa?” “Sì, mi piacerebbe com-
prarla.” (“Would you like to buy the purse?” “Yes, I would like to buy it.”)
• Imperative: Porta i bambini al mare! (Take the children to the beach!);
Portali al mare! (Take them to the beach!)
• Gerund: Avendoli preparati [i panini], li ho portati al mare. (Having made
the sandwiches, I took them to the beach.)
 When using the direct object pronouns lo and la before a verb that begins with a
vowel, -o or -a can be dropped and replaced with an apostrophe, or they can
remain as they are, as in Bianca lo/l’aspetta (Bianca’s waiting for him).
When using a direct object pronoun with a compound tense, the past participle
agrees in gender and number with the pronoun. 
“Hanno ricevuto la lettera?” “No, non [la] l’hanno ancora ricevuta.” (“Did they
receive the letter?” “No, they didn’t receive it yet.”)
“Avete fatto i compiti?” “Li abbiamo fatti!” (“Did you do your homework?” “We
did (it)!”)
Fill in the blanks in the following sentences by replacing the underlined words with
the appropriate direct object pronouns. (Use Table 4-3 for reference.)
Q. Cercano il dottore? (Are they looking for the doctor?)
A. Sì, lo cercano. (They’re looking for him.)
15. Non capisco voi. Non _________________ capisco.
16. Vedono spesso il fratello di Beppe. _________________ vedono spesso.
17. Chiamate noi domani! Chiamate_________________ domani!
18. Non mangiano la carne. Non _________________ mangiano.

23. Desidero pagare il caffé. Desidero pagar_________________.

Chapter 4: All About Pronouns

Fill in the blanks with the appropriate formal direct object pronouns. The context of
the sentence should indicate when you’re addressing a man, a woman, a group of
men, a group of women, or a mixed group.
Q. Signora, _________________ aiuto io a salire le scale.
A. Signora, L’aiuto io a salire le scale. (Madam, I’ll help you walk up the stairs.)
24. Signore, _________________ volevo avvisare che la squadra femminile è al completo.

25. Signori, _________________ volevo avvisare che la squadra maschile è al completo.
26. Signora, _________________ vorrei avvertire che la gonna che Lei ha ordinato è arrivata.
27. Signore, si è fatto male a una mano? _________________ aiuto io.
Indirect Object Pronouns
Indirect object pronouns refer to living beings. They’re used with transitive verbs and
answer the question a chi? (to whom?). Prepositions used with indirect objects can
include a/per/con (to/for/with) + a person or animal.
Scrivo a mia madre ogni giorno (I write to my mother every day) becomes Le
scrivo ogni giorno (I write to her every day)
Telefono a Luigi una volta alla settimana (I call Luigi once a week) becomes Gli
telefono una volta alla settimana (I call him once a week)
In Table 4-4 I list the indirect object pronouns that are generally placed before the
verb or attached to it when the verb is an infinitive, an imperative, or a gerund. The
loro form always follows the verb, as in Ho detto loro quello che pensavo (I told
them what I was thinking).

Part II: A Close Look at Parts of Speech 

Note the following nuances of the indirect object pronouns:
 In the third-person plural form, gli is used for both masculine and feminine
forms. Compro un regalo per le mie figlie (I’m buying a gift for my daughters)
becomes Gli compro un regalo (I’m buying a gift for them). You also can use gli
for only males or male and female combined, as in “Cosa regali ai nonni per
Natale?” “Gli regalo una radio” (“What are you giving our grandparents for
Christmas?” “I’m giving them a radio”).
 When you address people formally, you use the Le form in the third-person sin-
gular for both male and female, as in Signore/Signora, Le apro io la porta
(Sir/Madam, I’ll open the door for you).
 Note that the third-person plural form has two options that mean the same thing.
The gli form is being used more frequently in modern spoken Italian, although
the loro form is still acceptable. In the plural, you may use the pronoun Loro
after the verb with or without a preposition, as in Signori/Signore/Signore e
Signori, apro Loro la porta/apro la porta per Loro (Gentlemen/Ladies/Ladies
and gentlemen, I’ll open the door for you).
Contrary to the rules of direct object pronouns, the past participle in compound
tenses doesn’t agree in gender and number with the indirect object pronoun. Rather,
the past participle remains unchanged: “Avete telefonato ad Adriana?” “No, non le
abbiamo telefonato” (“Did you call Adriana?” “No, we didn’t call her”).
Fill in the blanks in the following sentences by replacing the underlined words with
the appropriate indirect object pronoun.
Q. Hanno fatto un grosso favore a noi. (They did a big favor for us.)
A. Ci hanno fatto un grosso favore. (They did us a big favor.)
28. Compriamo un gelato per voi. _________________ compriamo un gelato.
29. Raccontano una storia a Enzo. _________________ raccontano una storia.
30. Mando dei fiori a Paola. _________________ mando dei fiori.
31. Ha offerto a noi il suo aiuto. _________________ ha offerto il suo aiuto.
32. I genitori hanno dato la macchina al figlio. I genitori _________________ hanno dato la

33. Tu hai scritto una cartolina a me? Tu _________________ hai scritto una cartolina?
34. Hanno pagato il conto per voi? _________________ hanno pagato il conto?
35. Ho preparato la cena per gli amici. _________________ ho preparato la cena.
In the following sentences, fill in the blanks with the appropriate direct object pro-
nouns or indirect object pronouns, using the words in parentheses as clues. (Don’t
forget that the preposition indicates that the object pronoun is indirect. Refer to the
tables earlier in this chapter for help.)

Combining Direct and Indirect Object
Pronouns to Form Double Pronouns
Italians say things quickly and take it for granted that the listener understands what
they’re talking about after they’ve mentioned something once. The language accom-
modates this through double pronouns, which, like the other pronouns covered in
this chapter, are placed either before the verb or attached to the infinitive, impera-
tive, or gerund. You form double pronouns by combining the indirect object pronouns
(mi, ti, gli, le, ci, vi, and gli) with the direct object pronouns, usually in the third-
person singular and plural (lo, la, li, and le). You use double pronouns when you
want to convey both a direct object and an indirect object together.
When combining gli + lo, la, li or le, you connect them with an e: glielo, gliela, glieli,
gliele.
The following examples show how to replace the direct object and the indirect object
with pronouns. In the sentence Regalo un libro al bambino (I give a book to the little
boy), un libro (a book) is the direct object, and al bambino (to the little boy) is the
indirect object. Here are the ways to recast this sentence combining the direct and
indirect object pronouns:
 Replace al bambino with the indirect object pronoun gli: Gli regalo un libro.
(I give him a book.)
 Replace un libro with the direct object pronoun lo: Lo regalo al bambino. (I give
it to the little boy.)
 Combine the two object pronouns, starting with the indirect object pronoun fol-
lowed by the direct object pronoun: Glielo is the combination of gli meaning to
him and lo meaning the book, so you get Glielo regalo (I give it to him).
62
Part II: A Close Look at Parts of Speech 

When combining the two object pronouns in the third person, the indirect object 
pronoun is always gli even if the translation is to her. You know that the pronoun le
means to her, but when combining pronouns, the indirect object pronoun will always
be gli. In the same example Regalo un libro al bambino, substitute al bambino with
alla bambina. Watch the transformation: Replace alla bambina with the indirect
object pronoun gli (not le), and replace the direct object pronoun with lo. The combi-
nation is the same: Glielo regalo.
When using the combined pronouns and a compound tense, the past participle will
agree in gender and number with the direct object pronoun. For example, Ho regalato
una bicicletta alla bambina (I gave a bicycle to the little girl) becomes Gliel’ho
regalata (I gave it to her). When lo and la precede the verb avere, the vowel can be
dropped and replaced with an apostrophe, or they can remain as they are.
Table 4-5 lists pronoun combinations. Mi, ti, ci, and vi change to me, te, ce, and ve to
ease pronunciation, and the third-person singular and plural becomes one word.

Note that in the third-person plural, glielo (in its various forms) can also be replaced
by loro after the verb. For example, Lo compro loro (I’ll buy it for you/them).
When using double pronouns with the imperative (see Chapter 13), one syllable com-
mands (da’, fa’, sta, di’, va’) followed by a direct, indirect, or combined pronoun
double the initial consonant of the pronoun attached. For example, Da’ il conto a me!
becomes Dammelo! (Give the bill to me!).
Rewrite the following sentences, replacing the direct and indirect objects with a
double pronoun.

Special Italian Pronouns
Italian has two special pronouns: ci (here, there) and ne (of this/that/him/her/them).
They’re considered pronouns because they replace prepositional phrases. In the case
of ci, it generally replaces the prepositions a, in, and su + a place or a thing. Ne gener-
ally replaces the prepositions di and da + a person or thing. When used idiomatically,
both pronouns can refer to entire sentences or ideas, as you find out later in this 
section.
The adverbial pronoun ci
All languages have homonyms — that is, words that look and sound alike but that
have different meanings. For example, sound may mean “noise” or “stretch of water.”
In Italian, the pronoun ci is similar: It can mean us/to us, but it’s also an adverbial pro-
noun that can mean here, there.
For example, if someone says Sei andatoagli Uffizi quest’estate? (Did you go to the
Uffizi Museum this summer?), you answer No, ci sono andato l’estate scorsa (No, Iwent
there last summer). The ci stands for agli Uffizi.
Ci is also used with the verb essere to mean there is and there are.
You use c’è (there is) with a noun or name in the singular and ci sono (there are) with
a noun or name in the plural. C’è/ci sono also can take the spelling vi è/vi sono, but
it’s used more in literature than in spoken language. However, if you do see vi è/vi
sono, be careful not to confuse vi with the pronoun meaning you. Here are some
examples of the adverbial pronouns at work:
C’è/Vi è molta neve in montagna. (There’s a lot of snow in the mountains.)
C’era una volta una bellissima principessa . . . (Once upon a time, there was a
beautiful princess . . .)
You also can use ci as a pronoun referring to
 Places already mentioned, with phrases such as qui/lì (here), là, in quel posto
(there, in/to that place), da/per/attraverso quel posto (through there/that place)
64
Part II: A Close Look at Parts of Speech 

“Vieni spesso a Firenze?” “Sì, ci vengo ogni estate.” (“Do you come to Florence
often?” “Yes, I come here every summer.”)
 With special verbs having idiomatic meaning, such as pensarci, vederci, volerci,
and crederci
“Hai pensato al tuo dilemma?” “Ci ho pensato.” (“Did you think about your
dilemma?” “I thought about it.”) 
 Things or situations already mentioned, with such phrases as a questo, a quello,
a ciò (of/about this/that)
“Tu credi a quello che ha detto?” “No, non ci credo.” (“Do you believe what he
said?” “No, I don’t believe it.”)
It may help you to think about ci like this: When you have a place introduced by the
prepositions a, in, or per (at, to, in, through), you can use ci to refer to the preposition +
noun combination in the sentence that follows. Some examples include the verbs andare
a/in (to go to), entrare a/in (to enter), passare per (and also di/da) (to go through), stare
a/in (to stay at/in), and others. For example, “Sei mai stato in Croazia?” “No, non ci
sono mai stato.” (“Have you ever been to Croatia?” “No, I’ve never been there.”)
Some verbs associated with ci are idiomatic. The verb volerci is one of these. It
means to take, to need. It’s conjugated in the third-person singular and plural forms
depending on the object of the sentence. For example, Ci vogliono tre ore per
andare a Roma da qui (It takes three hours to get to Rome from here), but Ci vuole un
uovo per questa ricetta (You need one egg for this recipe).
Translate the following sentences into Italian. You have to use ci in all its functions: as
it’s used in the expressions c’è/ci sono (there is, there are); as an adverbial pronoun
meaning here/there/about that; and simply meaning us/to us.  The conjugated verb
forms are given if the verb used is not essere.
Q. There’s a new film with George Clooney.
A. C’è un nuovo film con George Clooney.

Chapter 4: All About Pronouns

The pronoun ne
Ne (of this/that/him/them, from this/that place) is a useful pronoun. It can refer to
people, animals, things, individual objects, or entire sentences that have already been
mentioned. You place ne before the verb or attached to it if the verb is an infinitive,
imperative, or gerund.
Ne means of this, of them, and from there because it’s used with verbs that are always
followed by either di (of, about) or da (by, from). For example, if someone asks you
Avete fatto delle foto? (Did you take some pictures?), you can answer Ne abbiamo
fatte molte (We took many of them). If someone asks you Ritorni adesso dal mercato?
(Are you just now coming back from the market?), you can answer Ne ritorno adesso
(I’ve just come back [from it]) because the verb ritornare (to return, to come back) can
be followed by the preposition da. Therefore, when you have a thing or a place intro-
duced by the preposition di or da you can use ne to refer to the preposition + noun
combination.
The following examples further illustrate the use of ne with a verb that takes di and
one that takes da:
“Hai parlato di tua figlia con il medico?” “Gliene ho parlato.” (“Did you speak
to the doctor about your daughter?” “I spoke to him about her.”)
“Quando sei arrivato da Pisa?” “Ne sono arrivato mezz’ora fa.” (“When did you
get in from Pisa?” “I just got here half an hour ago.”)
Verbs with which ne is commonly used include andare via da (to go away from, to
leave), pensare bene/male di (to think well/badly of someone), and venire da (to
come from). For example, “Dov’è Massimo?” “Si è arrabbiato e se n’è andato”
(“Where’s Massimo?” “He got mad and left”).
Table 4-6 shows what ne can substitute.
Table 4-6
The Many Meanings of Ne
Phrases That Ne Can Replace
Translation
di lui, di lei, di loro
of/about him, of/about her, of/about them
da lui, da lei, da loro
by/from him, by/from her, by/from them
di ciò, di questo, da quello
of/about this, of/about that
da qui, da lì, da là, da questo/da quel posto
from here, from there, from this/that place
A couple of other uses of ne are as follows:
 You can pair ne with indirect object pronouns (mi, ti, le, gli, ci, vi, gli) to form
double pronouns (me ne, te ne, gliene, ce ne, ve ne, gliene, ne loro). A sen-
tence such as Ha parlato a te di quel problema? (Did he talk to you about that
problem?) can become Te ne ha parlato? (Did he talk to you about it?).
 Ne can substitute for words that indicate quantity, such as molto, parecchio,
tanto, and un po’ di. For example, “Vorresti un po’ d’acqua?” “Ne vorrei pro-
prio un po’, grazie” (“Would you like a little water?” “ I’d like just a little, thanks”).
66
Part II: A Close Look at Parts of Speech 

 Ne is used idiomatically when asking the date: Quanti ne abbiamo oggi? (What’s
the date?)
When you address someone directly, you don’t use ne but rather repeat the preposi-
tion + personal pronoun construction:
“Hai sentito parlare di me?” “Ho sentito parlare di te.” (“Have you heard any-
thing about me?” “Yes, I have [heard something about you].”)
Ne can drop the -e when combined with the third-person present and imperfect forms
of essere. For example, È rimasto colpito da Bianca (He was struck by Bianca); N’è
rimasto colpito (He was struck by her).
When ne substitutes for a partitive, the past participle agrees in number and gender
with the object it replaces, as in “Hanno bevuto tanta birra?” “Sì, ne hanno bevuta
tanta” (“Did they drink a lot of beer?” “Yes, they drank a lot [of it]”).
Rewrite the following sentences, replacing the underlined words with the pronoun ne
in the appropriate place.
Q. Avete letto del nuovo presidente? (Did you read about the new president?)
A. Ne abbiamo letto. (We read about him.)
57. Sono appena tornati dalla Grecia.

When the Subject Is Also the Object:
Reflexive Pronouns
Reflexive pronouns convey that the subject is also the recipient of the action, as in Mi
lavo ogni mattina (I wash myself every morning). You use these pronouns with reflex-
ive verbs, which I cover in Chapter 17. Table 4-7 lists the pronouns.
RULES
67
Chapter 4: All About Pronouns

Reflexive Pronouns

ci (ourselves)
ti (yourself)
vi (yourselves, informal)
si (himself, herself, itself)
si (themselves)
Si (yourself, third-person singular, formal)
Si (yourselves, third-person plural, formal)
When conjugating a reflexive verb, conjugate it exactly as you would a verb that’s not
reflexive, but place the reflexive pronoun in front of the conjugated verb:
Marco si sveglia ogni mattina alle 6:00 ma non si alza fino alle 6:30. Io mi 
sveglio alle 6:00 ma mi alzo subito. (Marco wakes up every morning at 6:00 but 
he doesn’t get out of bed until 6:30. I wake up every morning at 6:00 but I get up
immediately.)
Fill in the blanks in the following letter with the correct forms of the reflexive 
pronouns.
Q. I ragazzi si annoiano d’estate? (Do the children get bored in the summer?)
A. No, non si annoiano mai. (No, they never get bored.)

Dear Giulia,
I’m writing from Cortina. Unfortunately, I’m writing because Elena hurt her right
hand in a hike up a mountain and she won’t be able to write for a bit.  Except for 
this, we are all well.  The weather is wonderful and the views, as you well know, are 
magnificent.  Last weekend my inlaws came to visit us.  They aren’t big hikers but they
stayed with the children and with Elena, so I was able to go on a beautiful hike with 
my friends. You know them, right? I hope next summer we will all be able to stay
together.
Hugs,
Marco

Chapter 5
Adjectives, Adverbs, and
Comparisons
In This Chapter
 Coordinating nouns and adjectives
 Locating the best spots in a sentence for adjectives
 Creating adverbs and putting them in the proper spot
 Establishing comparisons and rankings
I
f you say Marina ha una casa grande (Marina has a big house) or Marina ha una
casa piccola (Marina has a small house), all you’ve changed is one word, but you’ve
said two very different things. Grande (big) and piccola (small) are adjectives that
convey qualities of people, animals, objects, and situations. In Italian, as in English,
you employ adjectives with nouns, names, and pronouns.
Adverbs are another part of speech that helps you describe actions. In both Italian
and English, adverbs are invariable, which means that you don’t need to match them
to the words they modify. You can add an adverb to qualify a verb, an adjective, a
noun, a sentence, and even another adverb. For example, if you say È molto presto
(It’s very early), you’re using two adverbs — molto and presto — together.
The final topics of this chapter are comparatives and superlatives because, in using
adjectives and adverbs, you may want to establish comparisons and rankings
between two or more things or people. Consider these examples: Gianni è alto come
Umberto (Gianni is as tall as Umberto); Pino è il più alto della classe (Pino is the
tallest in his class); and È arrivata tardissimo! (She arrived very late!).
In this chapter, I explain the various endings adjectives can have as well as the differ-
ences between masculine and feminine, singular and plural adjectives and how to
match them to the words that they refer to. I also talk about where to place adjectives
in the sentence. As for adverbs, I explain the difference between original and derived
adverbs and how to form the latter. I also give you suggestions for their placement in
sentences. I wrap up this chapter with coverage of comparatives and superlatives,
helping you figure out how to use them to best express yourself.

Matching Adjectives to Nouns 
in Gender and Number
In Italian, you must match adjectives in gender and number to the nouns that they
modify. You need a masculine singular adjective with a masculine singular noun, a
feminine singular adjective with a feminine singular noun, and so forth. For example,
Maria + bello →Maria è bella (Maria is beautiful).
A few adjectives are invariable; they only have one form. I list the most important
ones in the later section, “Invariable adjectives.”
When you match an adjective and a noun, remember that you may end up with two
words with the same ending, as in Il cavallo è piccolo (The horse is small), or you may
not, as in Il cavallo è intelligente (The horse is smart). If you check the possible end-
ings of nouns listed in Chapter 2 and look at the possible endings of adjectives listed in
this chapter, you can come up with several combinations. (This is a good exercise for
you in order to practice your mastery of noun-adjective endings and combinations.)
In order to come up with the right match, you must consider the gender of the noun
and then choose the gender of the adjective. For example, if you choose the noun
castello (castle), which ends in -o, and the adjective grande (huge), which ends in -e,
the right combination is castello grande (huge castle); if you choose the feminine
noun pena (sorrow) and the adjective grande (huge), the right combination is castello
rinascimentale (renaissance castle) because the adjective grande has one ending for
both the masculine and feminine gender. If the noun is in the plural, you also have to
choose the correct ending of the adjective in the plural, so castelli (castles) needs
grandi (huge) to form castelli grandi (huge castles), just as pene needs grandi to form
grandi pene (great sorrows) because, again, grande becomes grandi in the plural for
both masculine and feminine nouns.
Adjectives fit into one of three categories, depending on how they change to match a
noun’s gender and number.
 Regular adjectives vary in their endings depending on gender (masculine or fem-
inine) and number (singular or plural). Regular adjectives are clustered in three
broad categories:
• Those with four endings (masculine and feminine, singular and plural)
• Those with two endings (singular and plural)
• Those with three endings, one for the singular (masculine and feminine)
and two for the plural
 Irregular adjectives change the spelling of several letters, not just the last one,
especially when going from singular to plural (as seen for nouns; see Chapter 2).
 Invariable adjectives are few and far between, so you don’t need to change their
ending when you match them to the words they describe.
I’ve organized the following subsections according to the categories in the preceding
list. When you finish this section, you should be able to take an adjective you’ve
never seen before and place it in the proper group just by looking at its ending. When
in doubt, as usual, consult a dictionary.
74
Part II: A Close Look at Parts of Speech 

Regular adjectives
Regular adjectives are those that modify only the last letter to change either gender
and number or only number. Table 5-1 shows the possible variations and some exam-
ple adjectives.
Table 5-1
Variations of Regular Adjective Endings
Four endings: 
Two endings: 
Three endings: 
-o, -a, -i, -e
-e, -i
-a, -i, -e
Masculine singular (MS)
piccolo (small, short)
intelligente (intelligent)
egoista (selfish)
Feminine singular (FS)
piccola
intelligente
egoista
Masculine plural (MP)
piccoli
intelligenti
egoisti
Feminine plural (FP)
piccole
intelligenti
egoiste
When used after a noun, bello (beautiful) and buono (good) are regular adjectives with
four possible endings. When they are used before before a noun, though, they don’t take
the same endings as all other adjectives ending in -o. Instead, they follow these rules:
 bello follows the rules of the definite article:
• Use bel before a singular masculine noun that starts with one or more con-
sonants (exceptions follow): bel treno (beautiful train); use bei with the
same kinds of nouns in the plural: bei treni (beautiful trains).
• Use bello before a singular masculine noun starting with gn-, pn-, ps-, s +
consonant, z-, x-, or y-: bello spazio (beautiful space); begli with the plural:
begli spazi (beautiful spaces).
• Use bell’ before a singular masculine noun starting with a vowel: bell’orolo-
gio (beautiful watch); use begli in the plural: begli orologi (beautiful watches).
• Before a plural masculine noun that starts with a consonant, use bei:
bei gatti (beautiful cat).
• Before a singular or plural feminine noun, use bella and belle: bella artista
(beautiful artist), belle artiste (beautiful artists).
 buon follows the rules of
• The indefinite article when used with singular nouns: For example, before a
singular masculine noun that starts with a vowel or consonant, use buon:
buon anno (good year).
• The definite article when used with plural nouns: Used with plural nouns it
works as a four ending adjective and so you would say: buoni zii (good
uncles), buone famiglie (good families).
Irregular adjectives
When forming plurals, irregular adjectives modify more letters than just the last one,
usually to preserve the soft or hard sound of the singular masculine, as in bianco,
bianca, bianchi, bianche (white). But many times the variations from the norm are
accidents of history, for which I can’t give you any reason. Table 5-2 breaks down the
ending changes for irregular adjectives, with examples.

Choose the adjective in the gender and number appropriate for the word that it
describes. Both the ending and the meaning of the sentence should help you choose
the right word from the options provided.
Q. Il film era lunga/interessanti/noioso.
A. Il film era noioso. (The movie was boring.)
7. La canzone è (bello/interessante/lunghe).
8. Paolo compra una macchina (nuova/rosso/grandi).
9. Giuliana è (intelligenti/noioso/brillante).
10. Loro sono (giovani/importante/bella).
11. Le mie sorelle sono (giovane/vecchi/stanche).
12. Le arance non sono (mature/buona/cattivi).
When You Need to Match One Adjective 
to More than One Noun
An adjective may refer to more than one person or thing, in three ways:
 With a plural noun (or name or pronoun), as in Le suore sono silenziose (The
nuns are quiet)
 With two separate nouns, as in Gli uccelli e i gatti sono nemici (Birds and cats
are enemies)
 With one adjective referring to two different things that are singular and share
the same gender, as in Il professore parla di letteratura e storia tedesca (The
professor is talking about German literature and history)
You need to decide the adjective’s gender and number so that it matches the noun.
Follow these guidelines:
 If you have one plural subject, the adjective will be in the plural and match the
noun in gender. For example, I miei fratelli sono piccoli (My brothers are short);
Le mie sorelle sono piccole (My sisters are short).
 If you have a masculine noun and a feminine noun, you choose the masculine
plural adjective. For example, Pietro e Luciana sono piccoli (Pietro and Luciana
are short).

1. mosce: _________________
2. ricchi: _________________
3. allegre: _________________
4. begli: _________________
5. ipocrite: _________________
6. fertili: _________________

 If you don’t know the gender, use the masculine. For example, Loro sono piccoli
(They are little).
 If you have one adjective referring to two singular nouns of the same gender,
choose the singular form of the adjective in the gender that matches the nouns.
For example, in the following sentence, romana (Roman) matches the gender of
the nouns pittura (painting) and scultura (sculpture): Bianca è un’esperta di pit-
tura e scultura romana (Bianca is an expert of Roman painting and sculpture).
Putting Adjectives in Their Place
In English, you place adjectives after verbs that indicate a status or a condition, such
as to be or to feel, as you do in Italian; for example, Gina è contenta (Gina is happy).
When you attach an adjective to a noun, though, in English you place it before the
noun to which it refers, as in a blue sky. In Italian, you usually do the opposite, as in
Hanno scritto dei libri importanti (They’ve written important books).
However, you place some commonly used adjectives before the noun. For example,
you say Hanno una bella casa (They have a beautiful house), even though everyone
will understand you if you say Hanno una casa bella. I give you a list of the most
important adjectives that take this placement in the later section, “Recognizing the
adjectives that come before nouns.”
In a few cases, the adjective changes meaning depending on whether you place it
before or after the noun. For example, if you say È un grand’uomo (He’s a great man),
you mean something very different from È un uomo grande (He’s a big man). You can
find more on these adjectives in the later section, “Using placement to change an
adjective’s meaning.”
Recognizing the adjectives 
that come before nouns
Italian has some basic adjectives that you place before nouns. For example, you usu-
ally say È una bella casa (It’s a beautiful house). But if you say È una casa bella,
everyone understands you.
Here are the adjectives you usually place before the noun:
78
Part II: A Close Look at Parts of Speech 
 bello (beautiful)
 brutto (ugly)
 buono (good)
 cattivo (nasty, evil)
 breve (short)
 lungo (long)
Using placement to change 
an adjective’s meaning
Some adjectives change meaning depending on whether you place them before or
after the nouns they qualify. For example, if you say Ho rivisto un caro amico (I saw a

dear friend again), caro means dear to your heart; but if you say È un negozio caro (It’s
an expensive store), caro means expensive. Here’s another example: Solo means lonely in
Un uomo solo è spesso triste (A lonely man is often sad), and it means only in Sono le
sole pesche che abbiamo (These are the only peaches we have). I list the most com-
monly used adjectives of this sort in Table 5-3.

Forming Adverbs the Italian Way
In Italian, adverbs add details and nuances by modifying verbs, adjectives, nouns,
entire sentences, and other adverbs. Adverbs can radically change the meaning of
what you’re saying; for example, Lia si comporta bene (Lia behaves well) as opposed
to Lia si comporta male (Lia behaves badly). Adverbs are invariable in the sense that
they have neither gender nor number, so you don’t have to worry about coordinating
them to the words they modify.
In Italian, adverbs fall into two categories:
 Original: These adverbs aren’t derived from other words, and they vary widely
among one another.
 Derived: These adverbs are derived from adjectives.
Original adverbs
Original adverbs don’t have a fixed form, so you’re forced to simply learn them as you
go. Here are some important adverbs to remember:
80
Part II: A Close Look at Parts of Speech 

Some adjectives play the role of adverbs. To use them as adverbs, you always use the
masculine singular form. For example, Sandro e Marco corrono piano (Sandro and
Marco run slowly). These adverbs can only qualify verbs, adjectives, and other
adverbs (or sentences) because, when you apply them to nouns, names, and pro-
nouns, their “nature” as adjectives takes over and you need to coordinate them with
the words they refer to. So you would say Sandro e Marco sono corridori veloci
(Marco and Sandro are fast runners).
Key adjectives that you can use as adverbs include:
81
Chapter 5: Adjectives, Adverbs, and Comparisons
Derived adverbs
You form most derived adverbs by taking the singular form of an adjective and adding
-mente (the equivalent of -ly in English) to it. Here are the basic rules for forming
these adverbs, followed by some examples:
 If the adjective ends in -o, you add -mente to the feminine singular form of the
adjective. For example, curioso (curious) →curiosamente (curiously).
 If the adjective ends in -e, you add -mente to that adjective. For example, dolce
(sweet) →dolcemente (sweetly).
 If the adjective ends in -e but the -e is preceded by -l or -r, you drop the -e before
adding -mente. For example, normale (normal) →normalmente (normally);
celere (rapid) →celermente (rapidly).
 abbastanza (enough)
 adesso/ora (now)
 anche (also)
 ancora (still, yet)
 bene (well)
 davvero (really)
 domani (tomorrow)
 fa (ago)
 già (already)
 ieri (yesterday)
 mai/non . . . mai 
(ever, never)
 male (badly)
 no (no)
 non (not)
 oggi (today)
 presto (soon, early)
 purtroppo
(unfortunately)
 sempre (always)
 sì (yes)
 spesso (often)
 subito (at once, 
right away)
 tardi (late)
 comodo (comfortable)
 chiaro (clear)
 duro (hard, tough)
 forte (strong)
 giusto (right)
 leggero (light)
 molto (very, much)
 parecchio (a lot)
 poco (too little)
 quanto (how, how
much)
 sicuro (sure)
 solo (alone)
 tanto (so, so much)
 troppo (too)
 veloce (fast)
 vicino (near)

Finding a Place for Adverbs in a Sentence
In general, you place most adverbs close to the words they modify — that is, before
the adjective and the noun and after the verb (in both its simple and compound
forms). Here are a few examples (note that the adverbs are spesso and molto):
Roberto gioca spesso a golf. (Roberto plays golf often.)
Mi è piaciuto molto il concerto. (I liked the concert a lot.)
Exceptions to the general rule are the simple adverbs appena (just), ancora (yet, still),
già (already), and mai (ever); and the compound adverbs non . . . mai (ever, never),
non . . . ancora (not yet), and non . . . più (no more, no longer). The following guide-
lines explain where to place them:
RULES
82
Part II: A Close Look at Parts of Speech 

 With a compound verb composed of an auxiliary and a past participle (see
Chapter 10), you place the simple adverbs listed previously between the auxil-
iary and the past participle, as in Il film è già finito (The film has ended already).
If you have a verbal form consisting of a modal auxiliary and a verb in the infini-
tive (see Chapter 8), you place the adverb between the two verbs, as in Volete
ancora venire? (Do you still want to come?).
 With compound adverbs, non precedes the verb, and mai/ancora/più follows it.
For example, Non mangio più il sushi (I don’t eat sushi anymore).
If the verb is in a compound form or is accompanied by a modal auxiliary, you
place the second word of the adverb between the two verbs, as in Non ho
ancora mangiato il dolce (I haven’t eaten dessert yet).
Ancora means yet or still, but it also means some more or again. Regardless of mean-
ing, its placement in the sentence remains the same. Here are a few examples:
È ancora presto per telefonargli. (It’s still too early to call him.)
Vuoi ancora del gelato? (Do you want some more ice cream?)
The adverb sempre, however, can go either between components of a compound tense
or verbal form, or after without any change in meaning. For example, Ha sempre gio-
cato con lei and Ha giocato sempre con lei both mean He’s always played with her.
You have more freedom in placing all other adverbs, depending on what you want to
emphasize. You can say Improvvisamente, se ne andarono (Suddenly, they left) or Se
ne andarono improvvisamente (They left suddenly). As usual, when it’s a matter of
emphasis and style, I can’t give you precise rules. Notice where they’re placed when
reading, and try different options when writing.
Rewrite each sentence, placing the adverb provided in parentheses in its appropriate
place. Some exercises may have two correct answers, in which case you should choose
whichever one seems most appropriate. Then translate your answer into English.
Q. Non parlano di lui. (bene)
A. Non parlano bene di lui. (They don’t speak well of him.)

Making Comparisons
In both English and Italian, you can compare things in three ways. You can say some-
thing possesses a quality more than, less than, or as much as something else. The two
objects you’re comparing are called the first and the second term of comparison. You
can convey them with names, nouns, pronouns, adjectives, adverbs, and verbs.
Here are the rules for establishing comparisons in Italian:
 To say that one object has a quality more than or less than another object, use
più to convey more, meno to convey less or fewer (before a countable plural
noun), and di (or a contracted form of di) or che to convey than. You use di only
when the second term is a name, a pronoun without a preposition, or an adverb.
Bianca è più intelligente di Silvia. (Bianca is more intelligent than Silvia.)
Sembri meno nervoso di ieri. (You seem less nervous than yesterday.)
 When the second term is a name or a noun preceded by a preposition; or when
you compare two adjectives, two adverbs, or two verbs, you can only use che
before the second term.
Compriamo meno pere che mele. (We’ll buy fewer pears than apples.)
Gli piace sciare più che nuotare. (He likes skiing more than swimming.)
With some exceptions that I mention in the later section, “Migliore and peggiore, meglio
and peggio: Better and worse,” unlike English, Italian doesn’t add endings to adjectives
or adverbs to convey that one individual possesses a quality to a different degree than
someone else. For example, vecchio (old) remains the same, and you add the words più
or meno before it. In English, you add -er to one- and two-syllable adjectives to assert a
difference of degree; for example, old becomes older and cold becomes colder.
When you want to say that the degree of a quality (or the amount of an object) keeps
on increasing or decreasing, as in more and more tired, taller and taller, and less and
less ready, in Italian you use sempre più and sempre meno (which are invariable) + an
adjective, an adverb, or a noun. For example, Fa sempre più freddo (It’s colder and
colder); Abbiamo sempre meno vacanze (We have fewer and fewer vacation days).
To say that one object possesses a quality as much as another object you use the
expressions tanto . . . quanto or così . . . come to convey as . . . as, as much . . . as, or
as many . . . as. For example, Bianca è tanto intelligente quanto Silvia (Bianca is as
intelligent as Silvia).
84
Part II: A Close Look at Parts of Speech 

When you use an adjective to compare two individuals, you can omit the words tanto
or così, as in Luciano è alto quanto Carlo (Luciano is as tall as Carlo). You keep tanto
and così when you compare two nouns, as in Compriamo tante pere quante mele
(We’ll buy as many pears as apples); two adjectives, as in Luisa è tanto bella quanto
brava (Luisa is as beautiful as she’s good); or two verbs, as in A Gianni piace tanto
nuotare quanto sciare (Gianni likes swimming as much as skiing).
You’re buying Christmas presents for your children, nieces, and nephews. Using the clues
given in parentheses, fill in the missing comparatives in the following dialogue. (Note:
Combine the preposition di with one of the following articles: del, dei, delle, and so on.)
Q. Voglio comprare _________________ (more) saggi _________________ romanzi.
A. Vorrei comprare più saggi che romanzi. (I’d like to buy more essays than novels.)
Cliente: Vorrei fare dei regali educativi (42) _________________ (more) alla moda. A mia
figlia piacciono le bambole piccole (43) _________________ (less) bambole grosse, ma le
piacciono i videogiochi (44) _________________ (more) bambole.

curioso (as . . . as). Ho bisogno di un regalo (49) _________________ (more) interessante
(50) _________________ caro. La mia nipotina è (51) _________________ (more) giovane
(52) _________________ mia figlia. Penso che le piacerebbe un pupazzo di peluche.
Commessa: Questa scimmietta è (53) _________________ (less) bella (54) _________________
questa tigre, ma ai bambini piace molto.
Designating the best and the worst: 
The superlatives
Just as in English, in Italian you can rank objects to establish which one is the highest
or the lowest in a series or group. And you can declare that one object is excellent at
something even if you don’t compare it with anything else.
To rank objects as the highest or lowest when the second term is a noun or pronoun,
you use il più/il meno . . . di/in (the most/least . . . of/in). You match the adjective
with the noun that it refers to.
Luciano è il più alto dei figli. (Luciano is the tallest of the children.)
Marta è la meno agile nella squadra. (Marta is the least agile on the team.)
The absolute superlative expresses the greatest degree of an adjective or an adverb, as
in I ragazzi sono lentissimi (The boys are so very slow). In English, you convey it by
adding very, much, by far, incredibly, amazingly, and so on to an adjective or an adverb.
To express the absolute superlative in Italian, you modify adjectives by dropping the
final vowel and adding -issimo, -issima, -issimi, or -issime; for example, gentile →gen-
tilissimo (very kind) and alto →altissimo (very tall). When the adjective or adverb
85
Chapter 5: Adjectives, Adverbs, and Comparisons

ends in -i, it only adds -ssimo. For example, tardi →tardissimo (very late). As usual,
you coordinate the adjective to the noun in gender and number.
Quei vestiti sono carissimi. (Those dresses are very expensive.)
Torno a casa prestissimo. (I’ll be coming home very early.)
When you want to convey a superlative less emphatically, in Italian you can add molto or
assai (very). Despite the fact that molto and assai mean very, the phrase molto grande
means large, big, or rather big instead of very large, which translates to grandissimo.
For some emphasis, you also have the option of repeating a short adjective or adverb,
like grande grande or presto presto (with no comma between them). For example, Le
diede un abbraccio forte forte (She gave her a really strong hug). You typically don’t
do this with long words because it doesn’t sound good.
Migliore and peggiore, meglio and peggio:
Better and worse
In Italian you have two ways of saying that someone has more or less of the qualities
expressed by the adjectives buono (good), cattivo (bad), grande (great), and piccolo
(small, little). You can add più (more) or meno (less) to the adjective; or use special
words as listed in Table 5-4.
With the adverbs bene (well), male (badly), molto (much), and poco (too little), you
only have special forms to express the comparatives and superlatives of these quali-
ties. I list them in Table 5-5.
In all other respects, you use these special forms as you use the other comparatives.
Umberto è il più grande dei fratelli. or Umberto è il fratello maggiore. (Umberto
is the oldest of the siblings.)
Penso che il parmigiano sia migliore della fontina. or Penso che il parmigiano
sia più buono della fontina. (I think that parmesan is better than fontina.)

Prepositions: The Big Challenge
In This Chapter
 Sorting out articles combined with prepositions
 Forming complements with prepositions and nouns, names, or pronouns
 Locking in set phrases and idiomatic expressions
 Pairing verbs and prepositions
P
repositions are invariable words you need to link other words in a sentence when
adding a name, pronoun, or noun by itself isn’t enough. For example, I’m going
school is not a complete sentence. You need to say, I’m going to school. Choosing one
preposition over another leads you to say different things, such as I’m speaking to you
or I’m speaking about you. One preposition can play different functions. In the sen-
tence I’m at home, the word at conveys place. In the sentence He’s at ease, it conveys
someone’s feelings. On the other hand, different prepositions can convey similar
meanings, as with in the evening or at night.
Prepositions are difficult to learn in any language because their use is idiomatic in
many cases. The basic rule, therefore, is practice, practice, and more practice.
In this chapter, I give you some guidelines. I show you the main Italian prepositions
(called preposizioni semplici, or simple prepositions). In Italian, you also encounter
other words used as prepositions — adverbs and adjectives in particular. Here, I men-
tion only the few that are indispensable. I also show you how to choose the preposi-
tion that corresponds to the one you’d use in English in the same situation, because
literal translation won’t do. For example, the preposition di usually translates to of,
but in the expression to think of someone, you use a, which usually means at or to:
pensare a qualcuno.
Prepositions can also introduce infinitives. A and di are the most common in Italian,
as to is in English. Often, the verb you’re using “carries” a specific preposition, which
you have no choice but to use. I provide you with a list of commonly used verbs and
the prepositions that follow them.
Combining Prepositions with Articles
Italian has eight basic prepositions, corresponding to the basic prepositions used in
English. I list them here, starting with the most-frequently used. You find the transla-
tion that reflects their meanings in the two languages, but remember that you can’t
assume that you’ll use the same preposition in Italian and English every time.

With prepositions, the word order is strict: A preposition precedes and is never sepa-
rated from the word with which it forms a unit of meaning: a me (to me); con coraggio
(with courage). The girl whom I was thinking of can be translated only as La ragazza a
cui pensavo (The girl of whom I was thinking).
When you have a definite article between a preposition and a noun, you fuse six of
the eight prepositions with the articles to form one word. Table 6-1 lists the simple
prepositions in their combined forms.

Forming Complements (Preposition + Noun,
Name, or Pronoun)
You can form short phrases by putting together a preposition and a noun, a name, or
a pronoun. These combinations are called complementi (complements) because they
complete the meaning of a sentence. In Italian, there’s a vast array of complements, as
you see if you check an Italian grammar book. Here I talk about which prepositions
you need in a given context: place, for example. If you want to say, I’m going from
Florence to Palermo, you need two prepositions that have to do with place. As you
gain knowledge of prepositions, you’ll realize that you can use the same preposition
in different contexts, as happens in English with in, for example, which works with
both place and time (as happens in Italian, too). Following are the main contexts and
the prepositions you use to talk about each of them.
92
Part II: A Close Look at Parts of Speech 
 di (of, about)
 a (at, to)
 da (from, by)
 in (in, into)
 con (with)
 su (on, onto)
 per (for, through)
 fra/tra (between,
among)

Possession and specification
If you say that something belongs to someone, or if you convey information about
someone or something, you use di, as in the following examples: il succo di mele
(apple juice); le foto del matrimonio (the photos of the wedding); la paura della fame
(the fear of hunger).
In English, you attribute characteristics to people or other things by inverting the
word order or placing of between an object and another noun representing a feature
that object possesses (the brilliance of diamonds). You also may add an apostrophe
and s to a noun or a name or use a possessive adjective, such as his or her. Here’s
how Italian works:
 Use di (of, about) to link a feature to a person or thing that has that feature, as in
il piano del tavolo (the table top).
 To convey ownership, use possessive adjectives and pronouns, or di followed by
the thing owned, as in il gatto di Marta (Marta’s cat) or il suo gatto [di Marta]
(her cat).
Qualities and functions
You can talk about features of things by emphasizing a characteristic that makes
them what they are, as in la scollatura a V (a V-neck), or by indicating their function,
as in le carte da gioco (playing cards). In English, you invert the word order or you
add an adjective to a noun. So when you have those two constructions in English, you
have to decide whether to use di (of), a (at, in) or da (by, from) in Italian.
You can test which preposition works by performing the following experiment. If you
say the table top, can you change that phrase to the top of the table? The answer is
yes. In Italian you use di, writing il piano del tavolo. But if you say a motor boat, can
you turn it into the boat of a motor? Unlikely. You’re talking about a boat with a motor.
In Italian, it’s la barca a motore. And if you say, a pleated skirt, can you turn it into the
skirt’s pleated? Obviously not. It’s a skirt with pleats. In Italian, it becomes la gonna a
pieghe. And what about a golf ball? Are you talking about a ball’s golf, a golf’s ball, or
a ball you use to play golf? Clearly the latter. When you describe what something is
used for, you choose da in Italian: la pallina da golf. Here are the general rules:
 To indicate a feature of an object, you use noun + a + another noun: la barca che
va a vela is la barca a vela (sailing boat) 
 To indicate a feature that explains the function of an object, you use noun + da +
noun: la pallina che serve a giocare a da tennis is la pallina da tennis (tennis ball)
You also use da + number to convey value, as in Vuoi un anello da 10.000 euro?!
(You want a ring that costs 10,000 euro?!), but you use di for numbers to count things:
Legge un libro di cinquecento pagine (She’s reading a 500-page book).
93
Chapter 6: Prepositions: The Big Challenge

Insert di (of), a (characterized by), da (with the function of), or no preposition at all
between the following sets of nouns.

2. i pantaloni _____ righe
3. il giornale _____ ieri
4. la tazzina _____ caffè
5. il discorso _____ Giovanna
6. un saggio _____ trenta pagine
7. il forno _____ microonde
8. l’asilo _____ nido
Place
Place is a label I use to refer to activities ranging from staying still to going through, both
physically and metaphorically. English uses only to (and into or onto) to convey motion
toward something, whereas Italian uses in (in), a (at, to), da (by, as in by the window),
and su (on). Italian chooses the preposition on the basis of various features of place.
In, into, on, over, above, and behind
You use the following prepositions regarding place, depending on what you’re 
discussing:
 For a point in space, use a: a Genova (in/to Genoa); all’angolo (at/to the corner);
al Colosseo (at/to the Coliseum); al primo piano (on the first floor)
 To indicate geographical position and distance, use a: Siamo a nord-ovest di
Trieste (We are northwest of Trieste); Siamo a 50 chilometri da Siena (We’re 50
kilometers away from Siena)
 For areas with boundaries, use in (in): in Italia (in/to Italy); negli Stati Uniti
(in/to the United States)
 When you say you’re in or are getting on a means of transportation, use in (in,
into) + noun (with or without the article) or su (on, onto): in macchina
(in/inside/into the car); nel treno (in/into the train); sull’aereo (on/onto the
plane); sul treno (on/onto the train)
 For volumes, use in (in, into) + noun followed by the article or not: nel cielo (in
the sky); in aria (in the air)
 For small islands, use a/su (in, to, on): a Capri (in/to Capri, on the Isle of Capri); a
Long Island (on/to Long Island); sull’Elba (on Elba Island)
 For large islands, use in (in, to): in Sicilia (in/to Sicily); in Gran Bretagna (in/to
Great Britain)
 For physical place, use in + article: nell’ufficio del dottore (in/into the doctor’s
office); nella mia cartella (in/into my briefcase)
 For expressing above/over and under, use sopra and sotto + article: su/sopra il
tavolo (on/over the table); sotto il tavolo (under the table); sottoterra (underground)

Whether there’s physical contact or not isn’t important when choosing between su
and sopra, as in L’aereo vola sulla/sopra la città (The plane is flying over the city).
 For expressing in front of and behind, use davanti a and dietro a/di: Siamo
davanti a San Pietro (We’re standing in front of St. Peter’s); La macchina è dietro
di te (The car is behind you)
From, through, across, and among
To convey origin, motion through, and separation, you use the following prepositions,
depending on what you’re discussing:
 For conveying someone’s origin and being born into a certain family, use essere
+ di (to be from): Sono di Venezia (They’re from Venice); Maria è di buona
famiglia (Maria comes from a well-to-do family).
 For motion from, origin, distance, and movement out of containers/elements, use
da (from, out of): La neve cade dal cielo (The snow falls from the sky); Ha tolto il
cellulare dalla borsa (She took the mobile phone out of her bag).
With verbs of motion such as andare (to go), venire (to come), and viaggiare (to
travel), you use da (from) or a (to). But the verb partire (to leave) requires the
preposition per (for, to) to indicate the destination, so you say, Vanno da Roma
ad Atene (They’ll go from Rome to Athens) but Partiamo per Nairobi (We’re leav-
ing for Nairobi).
 For expressing through, use da and per: Passate da/per Oslo? (Are you going/
driving/flying through Oslo?); Non passate per il bosco! (Don’t go through the
woods!).
 For expressing across, use dall’altra parte di: Il tabaccaio è dall’altra parte
della strada (The tobacconist is across the street).
 For expressing between/among, use fra/tra: Tra le case c’è una staccionata
(There is a fence between the houses). Italian doesn’t distinguish whether you’re
choosing between two things or among several things.
Add the appropriate prepositions to the following notes.
Q. Parto _____ Amsterdam (destination) _____ Milano (origin).
A. Parto per Amsterdam da Milano. (I’ll leave for Amsterdam from Milan.)
9. Roma è a ottocento chilometri _____ Torino.
10. _____ la Francia e l’Olanda c’è il Belgio.
11. Strasburgo è _____ Francia.
12. Per andare _____ Madrid (origin) _____ Berlino (destination) passiamo _____ Monaco.
13. _____ Capri c’è la villa di Tiberio.
14. L’università di Oxford è _____ Inghilterra.
15. Il treno _____ Parigi (origin) _____ Londra passa (destination) _____ la Manica.
95
Chapter 6: Prepositions: The Big Challenge

Place and function
If you say I’m going to the doctor’s, you can convey two ideas at once: a physical move-
ment (going to your doctor’s office) and the service provided there (you’re seeing a
doctor because you aren’t feeling well). In Italian, you can use the following preposi-
tions to express place and function at the same time:
 in + (no article) noun (neither names nor pronouns): in chiesa (at/to church); in
ospedale (at/to the hospital); in casa (home, at home); in giardino (in/to/into the
garden); in latteria (at/to the milk store); in ufficio (at work)
 a + noun: a casa (at/to home), a teatro (at/to the theater), a scuola (at/to school)
 a + definite article + noun (neither names nor pronouns): all’asilo (at/to kinder-
garten); al negozio di . . . (to the . . . store); all’ospedale (in/to the hospital); al
cinema (at/to the movie theater)
 da + noun, name, or pronoun of a person’s profession or role: dal macellaio
(at/to the butcher’s); dal dottore (at/to the doctor’s); da zia Lilla (at/to Aunt
Lilla’s); da noi (at/to our place)
From the phrases provided, select the proper conclusion to each sentence and write
it in the blank.

17. Dai, passiamo a prendere un caffè _________________.
18. Fa i pesi due ore ogni giorno _________________.
19. Hai visto quella collana di perle _________________?
20. Luigi detesta Marisa. Non verrà a cena _________________.
21. Mi sono macchiata il vestito. _________________.
Time
With prepositions, time behaves somewhat like space: Things can happen at a spe-
cific moment, as in a Natale (at Christmas), or during a period of time, as in nel 1975
(in 1975). Or they can take a chunk of time, as in per tre mesi (for three months).
Often you can express time without prepositions, as you can do in English: for exam-
ple, when something happens on a day of the week, as in Lo vedo domenica (I’ll see
96
Part II: A Close Look at Parts of Speech 

him this Sunday); when you talk about duration, as in Stanno in Svezia tre mesi
(They’ll stay/be in Sweden for three months); and with words that express time, such
as oggi (today), domani (tomorrow), and l’anno prossimo (next year). In particular,
Italian doesn’t use prepositions with dates (see Chapter 3), as in È nato il 15 agosto
1960 (He was born [on] August 15, 1960).
When you need prepositions to talk about a specific point in time, follow these 
guidelines:
 For days of the week, use di (on), as in di domenica (on Sundays); for moments
of the day, use di (in), as in di mattina (mornings); and for seasons, use in or di
(in), as in d’estate or in estate (in summer).
If you do something every week on a certain day of the week, in Italian you can
use the name of that day with the article, without a preposition, as in Giochiamo
a tennis il sabato (We play tennis every Saturday), or with di plus the day of the
week, as in Giochiamo a tennis di sabato (We play tennis on Saturdays). If you’re
talking about doing something on a certain day in the coming week, you use the
name of the day alone, as you do in English: Giochi a tennis sabato? (Will you
play tennis Saturday?).
 For holidays or named days and months, use a (at, in), as in a Pasqua (at Easter);
a Ferragosto (at Ferragosto [on August 15]); ad aprile (in April).
 For telling the time, use a + article, as in alle 9 di mattina (at 9 a.m.); alle [ore]
21:40 (at 9:40 p.m.); a mezzogiorno (at 12 noon/midday). (See Chapter 3.)
 For expressing that something will happen by a certain time, use tra/fra (in), as
in tra dieci giorni (in ten days); tra due settimane (in two weeks). Or use per
(by), as in per la settimana prossima (by next week).
 For expressing origin in time and continuing action, use da (since/from), as in da
gennaio (since/from January); dalle sette di mattina (since/from 7 in the
morning); da ieri (since/from yesterday); dal 15 luglio (since/from July 15).
 For expressing the end of a period of time in the future, use entro (by), as in
entro lunedì (by Monday); entro la fine dell’anno (by the end of the year).
 For expressing the onset of something, use con/su (with/by/at), as in con l’ar-
rivo della primavera (with the arrival of spring/by spring time); sul far del mat-
tino (towards/at dawn).
And when something lasts over a period of time, you use the following prepositions:
 For unspecified moments during the day, parts of the day, months, seasons, and
years, use in or in + article (at, in) or durante (in, during): in mattinata (in the
morning); nel pomeriggio (in the afternoon); in aprile (in April); in estate/
nell’estate (during the summer/in summer); nel 2005 (in 2005).
 For a specified amount of time and continuing action, use da (for) when referring
to the past: da tre mesi (for three months) or dal 20 luglio (since July 20). Use
per (for) when referring to the future and a definite amount of time: per tre mesi
(for three months).
Prima di/del means before. It takes di before names and pronouns, and it takes di +
article before nouns. Here are some examples: Marisa arriva prima di Silvia/lei
(Marisa arrives before Silvia/her); Il treno parte prima dell’autobus (The train is leav-
ing before the bus).
97
Chapter 6: Prepositions: The Big Challenge

Dopo means after. It takes di before pronouns and names, but it stands alone when
followed by nouns with the article. Here are some examples: È nato dopo di te (He
was born after you); Mario parte dopo la mamma (Mario is leaving after mother).

Purpose and agent of action
Are you giving someone a present? Are you doing a favor to or for someone? Are you
fighting for freedom? Because Italian looks at these actions as conveying metaphori-
cal movement, you use prepositions indicating motion: a (to) and per (for). A and per
are often interchangeable, as they are in English. For example, Compri i regali per
i/ai bambini? (Are you buying presents for the kids?).
When you write about body parts, in Italian you often use verbs that require the
preposition a (to) afterwards, such as farsi male a (to hurt one’s), aver male a (for
something to hurt), operare a (to perform surgery on/to). Therefore, you have no
choice but to use that preposition, as in Lo operano al piede sinistro (They’ll do sur-
gery to his left foot).
If you use a verb that doesn’t require a preposition, such as rompersi qualcosa (to
break something), you add the noun of the organ without any preposition, as in Maria
si è rotta un polso (Maria broke a wrist).
If you consider somebody responsible for something, or the agent of the action, you
use da (by): La Nona Sinfonia è stata composta da Beethoven. (The Ninth
Symphony was composed by Beethoven.)

Tools, reasons, and causes
In everyday life, you do a lot of things with, well, things. These objects can be means
of transportation or tools you use to do something; or maybe they’re causes of
events, or reasons for your actions.
For means of transportation, you use the following prepositions:
 in (by) (without the definite article) followed by a noun in the singular (except
for objects like sci [skis], which are used in pairs): Verranno in macchina
(They’ll come by car); Vanno in paese in sci (They’re going to town by skis).
 con + article + noun to convey how one has reached one’s destination (rather than
the means used): The distinction is meaningful in English too, as in the following
example: Arriva con l’aereo delle 20 (She’ll arrive on the 8 p.m. flight). You also use
con if you add any qualification to the means used, as in Va in giro con la moto di
suo fratello (He drives around with his brother’s motorbike).
 per to convey by/via: L’ho mandato per posta (I sent it by mail).
 con + article + noun to talk about the object used to achieve a result: Mio padre
lucida l’automobile con un prodotto speciale (My father polishes the car with a
special product).
 da to express a cause with the verb in the passive form: La casa è stata distrutta
dall’incendio (The house was destroyed by the fire).
The most common prepositions conveying causes and reasons are da, di, and per
(for, out of, with, because of). As you can see, you have a lot of options in English as
well. This tells you that it’s very difficult to give specific rules about how to choose
among the various options. It’s easier to learn some expressions by heart when you
encounter them. Here are a few:
 gridare per la rabbia (to shout in anger)
 morire di fame/sete (to die from hunger/thirst)
 piangere di gioia/di dolore; piangere per la gioia/per il dolore (to cry for joy/
in pain)
 ridere dalla/per la gioia (to laugh for joy)
 soffrire per la/di nostalgia (to suffer from nostalgia)
 tremare per il/di freddo (to shiver with cold)

Chapter 7
Demonstrative, Indefinite, and
Possessive Qualifiers
In This Chapter
 Pointing to people and things with “this” and “that”
 Conveying indefinite persons, qualities, and quantities
 Assigning ownership
W
hen you want to point to someone or something because you want to make sure
that you and your listener or reader are on the same wavelength you can use a
special set of words that help you be specific: words such as this, my, and some. You
add them to names, nouns, and pronouns, as in Quel corso di filosofia è difficile (That
philosophy course is difficult). Or you can use them by themselves as pronouns, as in 
“Il nostro viaggio è stato magnifico. E il vostro?” (“Our trip was great. And yours?”).
You have at your disposal different kinds of “pointers” which are the topic of this
chapter:
 Demonstrative qualifiers, such as questo and quello, as in Questa è una bella
bambola. (This is a beautiful doll.)
 Indefinite words, such as alcuni or nessuno, as in Non ho parlato con nessuno.
(I didn’t talk to anyone.)
 Possessive adjectives and pronouns, as in Hai visto la mia gatta?
(Did you see my cat?)
This chapter points out similarities and differences between Italian and English in the
use of those qualifiers, tells you how to match them to the words they refer to and
how to express that you’re talking about part of a larger set, as in Molti dei miei stu-
denti sono ammalati (Many of my students are sick). 
Pointing to Something with Questo (This)
and Quello (That)
The demonstrative qualifiers questo (this) or quello (that) are words you use to point
to people, things, and situations. You can use them as adjectives or pronouns. They
function as adjectives when you add a noun afterwards. They function as pronouns
when they refer to a noun, name, or pronoun you’ve already mentioned.

When you use either questo or quello, you coordinate it in gender and number with
the person or thing to which it refers. Questo follows the role of the “four ending
adjectives” while quello follows the definite article. When you use either as an adjec-
tive followed by a noun, besides gender and number you need to choose the spelling
of its ending depending on the vowel or consonant of the word that follows, as you do
with the definite article (see Chapter 2). So, for example, you say quell’alta torre (that
high tower), but quella torre alta (that high tower).
Demonstrative qualifiers mean exactly the same in Italian and English, with the follow-
ing exceptions when it comes to using questo and quello as pronouns: 
 You use the form quelli (those ones) only as a pronoun: Quelli non vogliono
pagare il conto (Those [people] don’t want to pay the bill). When you refer to a
group of females only you use quelle (those ones), which is the regular plural of
quella. 
 You can use questo or quello reinforced with the adverbs of place qui/qua
(here) for questo or lì/là (there) for quello. You can point to a thing: Questo qui
è il mio quaderno (This [one] is my notebook). When you employ them to point
to a person, you often do it to convey a negative nuance: Non ti fidare di questa
qui (Don’t trust this one); Non parlare a quello là (Don’t talk to that one).
 You can add an adjective to questo or quello instead of repeating a noun and an
adjective: “Vuoi la giacca blu o quella verde?” “Quella verde.” (“Do you want
the blue or the green jacket?” “The green one.”)
Translate the following sentences into Italian.
Q. I’ll buy the long dress; she’ll buy the short one.
A. Compro il vestito lungo; lei compra quello corto.
1. This is my wife.

Conveying Something Indefinite
In this section I talk about indefinite words that you can use as adjectives or as pro-
nouns and about indefinite words that you can use only as pronouns. Mind that in
Italian indefinite adjectives and pronouns are often singular even though they may
convey either a singular or a plural meaning. An example is the adjective qualche
(some) (which never changes its ending), as in the phrase: Abbiamo ancora qualche
dubbio (We still have some doubts); or the pronoun chiunque (anyone): Sono dis-
posto a discutere della questione con chiunque! (I’m willing to discuss that issue with
anyone!)
I also show you how indefinite words can help you select a section out of a larger
whole, as in the following example: Molti di noi non gli hanno creduto (Many of us
didn’t believe him). Molti (many) is the section and the larger whole is noi (us).
Indefinite words used as adjectives or pronouns
In Table 7-1 I list indefinite words that can be used as adjectives or pronouns. I indi-
cate which ones
 You can employ only in the singular, the plural, or both.
 Are invariable, which means that they only come in one form no matter the
gender and number of the person or thing to which they refer. If they are singular
(which is almost always the case) you conjugate the verb in the third-person sin-
gular. If the verb is in a compound form which includes the past participle
(check Chapter 9), you use the past participle in the masculine singular, unless
you’re sure that the indefinite adjective or pronoun refers to a group of females.
 Vary in gender and number, ending in -o, -a, -i or -e; or only in number, ending in 
-e or -i; you match variable indefinites with the nouns to which they refer, as you
do with describing adjectives (see Chapter 5).

Chapter 7: Demonstrative, Indefinite, and Possessive Qualifiers
In Italian as in English, the indefinite adjectives/pronouns both and either are used
only with plural, countable nouns. The most common phrase is tutti e due (M)/tutte e
due (F), but especially in writing, you’ll also see ambedue (M and F) and entrambi
(M)/entrambe (F).
Indefinite words used solely as pronouns
In Table 7-2 I list separately some indefinite words that you can only use as pronouns.
Most of these indefinite pronouns are singular and invariable, but they do convey a
generic, singular or plural meaning. Look at the following example: “Hai contattato
qualcuno?” “Sì, ho contattato tre avvocati” (“Did you contact someone?” “Yes, 
I contacted three lawyers”).
In English nowadays you use everyone meaning “all people.” You add third-person
plural possessive adjectives and personal pronouns, as in Everyone thinks that their
team is better. In Italian you can’t use ognuno that way. You use tutti (masculine
plural), as in Tutti pensano che la loro squadra or tutte (feminine plural) if you know
the group includes only women.
To convey whoever, whatever, and whichever, you can use
 chiunque + verb in the subjunctive, as in Chiunque sia stato, lo scopriranno.
(Whoever did it, they’ll find them.)
 chiunque + di + noun/pronoun to refer to people, as in Chiunque sia stato di
loro, lo scopriranno. (Whoever did it, they’ll find them.)
 qualunque or qualsiasi + noun, as in Qualunque regalo tu le faccia, non sarà
contenta. (Whatever present you give her, she won’t be happy.)
Chiunque, qualunque, and qualsiasi require the verb in the subjunctive (see
Chapters 14 and 15 for coverage of the subjunctive) as shown in the examples above.

13. Hai mangiato (molta; tutti; tutto)?!
Indefinite words that express a part of a set:
Partitive articles, indefinites, and the 
pronoun ne
When you employ an indefinite pronoun, you often express the set of which the 
pronoun refers to as a part. For example, in this sentence, Alcuni di loro non 
verranno alla festa (Some of them won’t come to the party). Alcuni (some) is the
indefinite pronoun and loro (of them) is the set. You can employ the following 
formulas using pronouns and other words to convey a part of a larger whole:
 ognuno/ciascuno (each), chiunque (any), nessuno (none), qualcuno (any, some),
uno (one) + the preposition di (of) or tra (among) + the verb in the third-person
singular
If there’s a past participle, you leave it in the masculine, as in Qualcuno di voi ha
scritto al giornale (Some of you wrote to the paper), unless you know that the
group consists of only females. For example, Una delle ragazze si è fatta male
(One of the girls got hurt).
 alcuni (some, a few), molti (many, a lot of), parecchi (several), pochi (few), tanti
(so many), troppi (too many) + di or tra + the verb in the third-person plural
Alcuni di voi hanno chiesto un rinvio. (Some of you have asked for a 
postponement.)
 The indefinite article del, dello, dell’, della, dell’ (some) in the singular + nouns
that are uncountable or indicate things in bulk, such as acqua (water), vino
(wine), or pioggia (rain)
Vuoi del vino? (Do you want some wine?)
113
Chapter 7: Demonstrative, Indefinite, and Possessive Qualifiers

 The adverbial phrase un po’ di (a little of) + uncountable concrete nouns or
abstractions
Sì, vorrei un po’ di vino grazie. (Yes, I’d like some wine thank you.) 
Ci vuole un po’ di costanza. (You need a little perseverance.)
You use di after an indefinite pronoun when an adjective follows. For example, 
Hai visto qualcosa di interessante alla mostra? (Did you see something/anything
interesting at the exhibit?).
When you don’t want to repeat the noun or pronoun representing a set already 
mentioned in a sentence with an indefinite pronoun, you can replace the set with the
pronoun ne (of those, them), either placed before the verb or attached to the infinitive
or the gerund. (For the other meanings of ne and a discussion of pronoun placement,
turn to Chapter 4.) If you use a past participle or another adjective, you coordinate it
with the word ne refers to:
“Hai comprato delle/alcune/molte/troppo banane?” “Ne ho comprate troppe!”
(“Did you buy some/many/too many bananas?” “I bought too many [of those]!”)
If you use uno/nessuno (one/none), the past participle takes the singular, coordi-
nated in gender with the item you’re talking about:
“Hai visto i tuoi amici?” “No, non ne ho visto nessuno.” (“Did you see your
friends?” “No, I didn’t see any [of them].”)
You can employ any quantifier, not just indefinites, to express a part of a set. For
example, “Hai comprato dieci borse?!” No, ne comprate 2!” (“Did you buy ten hand-
bags?” “No! We bought two!”).
From the options provided, select the proper conclusion to each sentence and write it
in the blank.

nessuno.

Assigning Ownership with 
Possessive Qualifiers
In English you assign ownership by adding a possessive adjective (my or our) to the
object owned, by referring to that object through a possessive pronoun (mine or
ours), or by adding ’s (or just the apostrophe) to the noun or name that conveys the
owner. In Italian you have three options: add a possessive adjective to the owner,
introduce the owner with the preposition di (of), or employ the idiomatic expression
essere di [insert owner’s name], which means something like to belong to.
Unlike in English, in the third-person singular Italian, the possessive adjective or pro-
noun doesn’t convey whether the owner is male or female. That information is clarified
only by the context of the sentence; for example, la sua gatta can mean his/her cat.
Table 7-3 lists possessive adjectives and pronouns, which are identical in Italian,
along with the corresponding definite articles.

In Italian you use the definite article with possessive adjectives and pronouns, except
in two cases:
 You don’t use the article with the names of close relatives except for the use
with loro.
 When you use a possessive word after the verb essere (to be) at this stage 
you can use the article or skip it, whichever comes easier, as when you say
Quell’automobile è la mia (That car is mine) or Quell’automobile è mia (That
car is mine).
RULES
115
Chapter 7: Demonstrative, Indefinite, and Possessive Qualifiers

Note, however, that the presence or absence of the article conveys a slightly 
different meaning: Quell’automobile è la mia (pronoun) means That car is mine
(as opposed to being yours or hers, and so forth). Quell’automobile è mia
(adjective), on the other hand, means simply That car belongs to me (as in, 
I bought it, I didn’t rent it).
If you select one or more items out of a group of things owned, in Italian you can use
 Any quantifier (a number or an indefinite pronoun) followed by dei, degli, delle
+ possessive qualifier + noun in the plural: Sono tre dei miei amici (They’re three
of my friends).
 uno or dei + possessive adjective + noun: È un mio amico (He’s a friend of mine);
Sono dei miei amici (They’re friends of mine). But, È un amico dei miei means
He’s a friend of my parents.

Linking Sentences with Conjunctions
and Relative Pronouns
In This Chapter
 Joining thoughts thanks to conjunctions
 Linking clauses with relative pronouns
I
n Chapters 1 through 7 I talk about handling various words — articles, nouns,
verbs, indefinite words, among others — to form one meaningful sentence. But in
speech and writing, you use many sentences, not just one. You can string them out
one after another, separating them with a period. But you often need to link together
thoughts expressed in different sentences. I devote this chapter to showing you how
to do that with coordinating or subordinating conjunctions or with relative pronouns.
When you rely on conjunctions, you employ invariable words whose only purpose in
life is to join clauses. I only give you a few suggestions about coordination and subor-
dination here because this is a broad and complex topic that you’re sure to work on
in depth in advanced Italian courses (or books). In both Italian and English, you
encounter coordinating and subordinating conjunctions. Here’s a rundown of both:
 You use coordinating conjunctions — such as e (and), o/oppure (or), or ma (but) —
when you link together clauses that are (grammatically) of equal standing.
Vai in crociera o stai sul lago? (Are you going on a cruise or are you staying
at the lake?)
 You use subordinating conjunctions — such as perché (because), quando
(when), or finché (in so far as) — when you link together dependent and inde-
pendent clauses.
Quando torni dobbiamo parlare. (When you come back we need to talk.)
You can point to a person, thing, or situation already mentioned by linking two
clauses with a relative pronoun, thus building a dependent clause called a relative
clause. For example, L’attrice che ha vinto l’Oscar è francese (The actress who won
the Oscar is French). In the example, che (who) is a relative pronoun that introduces
the relative clause ha vinto l’Oscar è francese (won the Oscar is French).
In the section reserved for relative pronouns, I introduce you to a special set of 
combined demonstrative + relative pronouns that do double duty: The (implied)

demonstrative pronoun belongs to the independent clause while the relative compo-
nent introduces the dependent clause, as in Ha visto chi ha mandato questo pacco?
(Did you see who sent this package?). In this example, chi combines la persona che
(the person who) and quello che (the one who). (You can also use the non-combined
form if you wish, but the combined form is handy.) (For more on demonstrative quali-
fiers, turn to Chapter 6.)
Linking Words and Clauses with
Conjunctions and Prepositions
As you know, a clause is a grouping of words that includes a verb, which sometimes is
all you need: Entrate! (Come in!). But in most situations, you need a subject, an object,
adjectives and other qualifiers, other nouns introduced by a preposition, and so forth
to express your meaning. When you’re on a roll with sentence construction and want
to keep going, you can link full sentences together using conjunctions and preposi-
tions. Here’s the breakdown of these linking words:
 Coordinating conjunctions: These conjunctions link together two (or more) sen-
tences that remain meaningful even if you take the conjunction away; for exam-
ple, Va negli USA, [ma] non va a New York (He’s going to the US, [but] he’s not
going to New York). This process is called coordination, and you have an array of
coordinating conjunctions to choose from.
 Subordinating conjunctions: These conjunctions tie one or more dependent
clauses to an independent one, as in Gioco con te se mi impresti la tua bici (I’ll
play with you if you lend me your bike). This process is called subordination. I also
tell you about how to use prepositions to construct a subordinate clause with
the verb in the infinitive.
Connecting words or sentences with 
coordinating conjunctions
You can use coordinating conjunctions in various ways:
 To link names, nouns, pronouns, adjectives, and adverbs in the same sentence,
as in Mi piacciono i romanzi e i resoconti di viaggio (I like novels and travel
books), or Vorrei un vestito elegante, ma comodo (I’d like an elegant but com-
fortable dress).
 To coordinate verbs in the infinitive, such as when they follow a modal auxiliary
(see Chapter 10). For example, No so né sciare né arrampicare (I can neither ski
nor climb).
 To coordinate complete sentences, as in Lia scrive poesie e Ugo suona il piano
(Lia writes poems and Ugo plays the piano).
Table 8-1 lists coordinating conjunctions you can use to link words or sentences.

When you use the conjunction e, you can invert the order of the sentences. Think 
of them in mathematical terms: In multiplication or addition, the product or sum
doesn’t change if you move numbers around. This is also the case with o (or), o . . . o
(either . . . or), né . . . né (neither . . . nor), and sia . . . sia (either . . . or). But with other
conjunctions (as with division and subtraction), order matters. If you establish a con-
trast with ma (but) or tuttavia (however); point to a conclusion or a consequence with
quindi (thus) or perciò (therefore); or convey a temporal sequence with allora, poi
(then), you can’t swap the sentence order. For example, Mia le fa un regalo, ma non
dirglielo (Mia will give her a present, but don’t tell her).
Rewrite the sentences with the conjunctions in the proper places. When it comes to
coordinating conjunctions, you may have more than one correct option.
Q. Luca non vuole parlarti, allora ha bisogno dei tuoi consigli.
A. Luca non vuole parlarti, tuttavia, ma, però ha bisogno dei tuoi consigli. (Luca doesn’t
want to talk to you, but he needs your advice.)

Chapter 8: Linking Sentences with Conjunctions and Relative Pronouns

Joining a dependent clause 
with an independent one
If you subordinate one sentence to another, you establish a relationship of dependence
between a main or independent clause and a subordinate or dependent one. With sub-
ordination, the meaning of the combined sentences is very different from their mean-
ings if left independent of one another. Consider this example: Mangio la verdura
perché fa bene (I eat vegetables because they’re good for me) means that you eat vegeta-
bles because they’re healthy food. Mangio la verdura. La verdura fa bene. (I eat 
vegetables. Vegetables are good for one’s health.) means that you may eat them because
you like them, because you have nothing else in the refrigerator, or for any other
reason. The fact that you eat veggies isn’t necessarily tied to their health benefits.
You can subordinate a dependent clause to a dependent one in two ways:
 With a subordinating conjunction
 With a preposition or prepositional phrase that does the work of a conjunction
I expand on these methods in the following sections.
With a subordinating conjunction
Table 8-2 lists the most common subordinating conjunctions.

Conjunctions are invariable, with the exception of words you use to convey compar-
isons, such as tante . . . quante (as many . . . as).
When you link sentences through subordination, the main clause and the conjunction
you’ve chosen determine the mood and tense of the verb in the dependent clause. In
Chapter 15, I detail how to link sentences with the declarative and the if . . . then con-
structions, which often use the subjunctive. Other constructions require the conjunc-
tion in the dependent clause, including affinché, perché when it means in order to, a
meno che (unless, except if), nonostante/nonostante che (although), prima che
(before), purché (as long as, provided that), sebbene, benché (although, even though),
and senza che (without). For example, Mi spiegate cosa sta succedendo sui mercati
affinché non perda tutti i miei soldi? (Can you explain to me what’s happening in the
markets so I won’t lose all my money?).
As I say in the introduction to this chapter, the syntax of subordination is complex, so
in the following exercise all you have to do is to choose the correct conclusion to the
first part of the combined sentence. I’ve chosen the conjunctions on your behalf!
From the options provided, select the proper conclusion to each sentence and write it
in the blank.

With a preposition or prepositional phrase
As long as the subject of both clauses is the same, you can introduce a dependent
clause with a preposition, or with phrases that include a preposition, followed by an
infinitive. In the sentence Ho deciso di andare a pescare (I’ve decided to go fishing),
the preposition di (to) introduces a dependent clause. In fact, you can replace the
preposition with the declarative conjunction che (that): Ho deciso che vado a
pescare (I’ve decided that I’ll go fishing). Table 8-3 lists prepositions and phrases with
prepositions that can introduce verbs in the infinitive.
When you use the preposition da, the infinitive can refer to the object of the sen-
tence, as in Dammi un libro da leggere (Give me a book to read/that I can read/for
me to read). And you can have two different subjects when you use su + article, as in
Partimmo sul sorgere del sole (We left while the sun was rising).

Each of the following exercises features separate sentences or combined sentences
linked by a subordinating conjunction. You can add a preposition to link the sen-
tences that are independent, and you can replace the subordinating conjunction with
a preposition. In both cases you should end up with a combined sentence in which
the two clauses are linked by a preposition and the verb in the infinitive. Remember
that if the verb is in the present perfect in the original sentence, you need a past
infinitive.

Joining Clauses That Belong Together
You may need a full sentence to point to a person or a thing already mentioned. For
example, if you say L’attrice ha vinto l’Oscar. L’attrice è francese, you can link the
two sentences by using a relative pronoun, which introduces a relative clause. The
two sentences become L’attrice che ha vinto l’Oscar è francese (The actress who won
the Oscar is French). In this sentence, che ha vinto l’Oscar (who won the Oscar) is the
relative clause, and who is the relative pronoun.
In English you often can skip the relative pronoun unless it’s the subject of the rela-
tive clause. In Italian you may not. For example, in English you may say Did you like
the wine that we drank last night? or Did you like the wine we drank last night? Either is
correct. In Italian, though, you must include che (that): Ti è piaciuto il vino che abbi-
amo bevuto ieri sera?
Italian has a set of relative pronouns that have counterparts in English, such as che
(who, whom) or le quali (who, feminine plural). But Italian also has a set of combined
relative pronouns. They convey (but don’t spell out) a demonstrative pronoun, such
as quello (that) or colui (the one), and a relative pronoun, such as che (who), to form
the combined pronoun chi (who), which means colui che (the one who). In English
the only exact equivalent is what, which means the things that/which; in Italian, it’s
quanto. Because these pronouns have no exact counterparts in English, turn to the
later section, “Economy of speech: Combined pronouns” to see what they mean and
how they work.
125
Chapter 8: Linking Sentences with Conjunctions and Relative Pronouns

Dealing just with your average 
relative pronouns
Italian has two sets of (non-combined) relative pronouns: invariable and variable.
 Invariable relative pronouns don’t change their endings to match the words they
replace in gender and number (for once!). An example is che (who, whom), which
can refer to a singular, plural, masculine, or feminine person or thing, as in Le
bambine che hai visto al parco sono le mie sorelle (The little girls you saw in the
park are my sisters).
 Variable relative pronouns are formed of two words: the relative word quale and
the definite article. Quale changes in number, but not in gender: quale, quali. It
always takes the definite article, which conveys both gender and number — il,
la, i, le (the) — to form the pronoun il quale (and its variations) meaning who,
whom, which. For example, La bambine le quali hai visto al parco sono le mie
sorelle (The little girls you saw in the park are my sisters).
When you use the variable set, you coordinate the pronoun with the word in the pre-
ceding clause that the pronoun replaces. You change the ending of the pronoun in
number and the article in both gender and number (for more on rules of coordina-
tion, refer to Chapter 2). For example, in the sentence La gatta della quale ti avevo
parlato è morta (The female cat about whom I talked to you died), la gatta is feminine
singular, as is the relative pronoun della quale.
You also have to contend with the pronoun cui, which never changes and can’t be
used as subject or direct object. You can only use it in two ways:
 Accompanied by the definite il, la, i, le (the), which conveys both gender and
number to form the pronoun il cui (and its variations). In this form, il cui means
whose.
Hai visto quel film il cui titolo ora non ricordo? (Did you see that movie
whose title I can’t remember right now?)
 Accompanied by a preposition but without an article, as in da cui (by/from
whom).
Table 8-4 illustrates the functions of the variable and invariable relative pronouns.

ter 6) 
When it comes to deciding which pronoun to use, if you use a relative pronoun as
subject or direct object, you can choose between the invariable form che or the vari-
able form il quale.
 Choose the word che when it’s very clear to whom you’re referring, as in Ho visto
Giovanna che andava in palestra (I saw Giovanna, who was going to the gym).
 Choose the variable form il quale (or one of its forms) when you want to avoid
ambiguity. If you say Ho incontrato il figlio della signora Maria, che ti manda
tanti saluti (I met Maria’s son, who sends you his greetings), in Italian nothing
makes you really certain who sent you greetings, whether Maria or il figlio. But
if you say Ho incontrato il figlio della signora Maria, il quale ti manda saluti,
you know for sure that you’re talking about il figlio, which is masculine singular,
because il quale is masculine singular as well.
When you use a preposition with the relative pronoun because you want to convey an
indirect object, you can choose between cui (plus article or plus preposition) or
quale (plus preposition and article). When in English
 You use of or about before a relative pronoun, use di + cui in Italian, as in Non
possiamo fare la vacanza di cui ti ho parlato (We can’t take the vacation which 
I spoke to you about). (But remember that the formula Non possiamo fare la
vacanza della quale ti ho parlato is perfectly correct and used all the time.)
127
Chapter 8: Linking Sentences with Conjunctions and Relative Pronouns

 You use the pronoun whose, meaning that someone already mentioned possesses
a certain trait, or that something already mentioned has a certain characteristic,
in Italian use il cui (la cui, i cui, le cui). For example, Ho visto una ragazza la cui
bellezza mi ha colpito (I saw a girl whose beauty struck me); Abbiamo fatto una
riunione il cui scopo non mi era chiaro (We had a meeting whose purpose wasn’t
clear to me).
 You need any other preposition before the relative pronoun, you can use 
indifferently cui or il quale. You add only the preposition to cui: con cui (with
whom/which), da cui (by whom/which), su cui (on whom/which); and you add a
combined article to quale: con il quale (with whom/which), dal quale (by
whom/which), sul quale (on whom/which). (For combined articles and the use of
prepositions, consult Chapter 6.) For example, you can say La persona sulla
quale avevamo contato non ci può aiutare or La persona su cui avevamo con-
tato non ci può aiutare (The person on whom we had counted can’t help us).
If you need a preposition with the relative pronoun (either il quale or cui) you may
not skip it. However, with cui only, you may (but don’t have to) skip the preposition a
(to) or per (for) to indicate aim or purpose (not motion), and leave cui all by itself, as
in La faccenda cui ti riferisci è stata sistemata (The problem you’re referring to has
been solved).
Join the following sentences using the appropriate relative pronouns. Use both the
invariable or variable forms; at times, both will be correct. (Tip: You need to place the
relative pronoun after the word to which it refers, which means that you may have to
change the word order of the new sentence, as I show in the example.)
Q. Ti ho parlato di quella persona. È arrivata.
A. La persona di cui/della quale ti ho parlato è arrivata. (The person I was telling you about
has arrived.)
19. Ho fatto un sogno. Volavo sopra il Polo Nord.

__________________________________________________________________________________
Economy of speech: Combined pronouns
In addition to relative pronouns, Italian has combined relative pronouns. A combined
pronoun is a single word that conveys two meanings: a demonstrative word (see
Chapter 7) and a relative pronoun. For example, the pronoun quanto (what, all that
which) contains both the demonstrative quello (that) tutto quello (all that) and the
relative pronoun che (which). For example, Farò quanto mi è possibile/Farò tutto
quello che mi è possibile (I’ll do what I can).
You can use the combined or non-combined form of the relative pronouns — it’s your
choice. The combined forms are very convenient, just as the pronoun what is in English.
If you use a non-combined form, you can see that each of the two components of the
pronoun plays a different function. Consider this example: Non faccio favori a coloro
che non lo meritano (I don’t do favors to those who don’t deserve them). With the
demonstrative component a coloro (to those), you convey aim or purpose; in fact,
you need the preposition a (to). The relative component che (who) is the subject of
the relative clause. And because in this case the demonstrative coloro is plural, the
verb of the relative clause is plural, too.
If you collapse the two components in a combined form, you’re also collapsing the
two grammatical functions. So, in keeping with the preceding example, a coloro che
becomes a chi (those who): The pronoun takes the preposition a to convey aim or
purpose, but it’s a singular pronoun, so you need the verb in the singular in the rela-
tive clause, as in Non faccio favori a chi non lo merita (I don’t do favors to those who
don’t deserve them).
Remember that the combined pronouns can convey
 A direct object and a subject, as in Lisa ringrazia chi le ha mandato i fiori/Lisa
ringrazia coloro che le hanno mandato i fiori (Lisa thanks those who sent her
flowers) or Lisa ringrazia colei/colui che le ha mandato i fiori (Lisa thanks the
person who sent her flowers). (Given the context at your disposal, the pronoun
chi can refer to all the persons mentioned.)
 Two direct objects, as in Invito quanti voglio or Invito tutti coloro che voglio
(I’m inviting all those I want to invite).
 An indirect object and a subject, as in Siamo riconoscenti per quanto hanno
fatto per noi or Siamo riconoscenti per quello che hanno fatto per noi (We’re
thankful for what they did for us).

Part II: A Close Look at Parts of Speech 

Part III
What Would You Do without
Verbs and Tenses?

In this part . . .
H
ere come the verbs! Verbs are the core of both
English and Italian because they convey so much
meaning. If you say Go!, that’s all you need to express what
you have in mind. Italian loves verbs, and to prove it, it
has many more verb forms than English (check out the
table of moods and tenses on the Cheat Sheet at the front
of this book), and every verb varies greatly from person to
person and tense to tense.
In this part, I explain how to distinguish the core of a verb
(the stem) from the endings you add for each person in
the various moods and tenses. I introduce conjugations,
regular verbs, and a lot of irregular verbs (which you
patiently have to learn by heart). I talk about the present
and various ways to convey the past. I show you how to
coordinate the past participle with the subject of the sen-
tence or its object, when to use essere (to be) and avere
(to have), where to place pronouns, and how to add verbs
such as potere (can), dovere (must), and volere (will),
which are called modal auxiliaries. Finally, I introduce the
future tense, which is used in Italian more or less like in
English.

Chapter 9
Writing in the Present
In This Chapter
 Conjugating regular and irregular verbs
 Managing the present progressive
 Dealing with the gerund, the infinitive, and personal pronouns
T
he present tense of the indicative mood, which allows you to convey statements of
fact or describe feelings and emotions, allows you to talk about the present (obvi-
ously!) and the future (not so obviously). (I cover the future more in Chapter 12.) The
present tense takes two forms in both Italian and English:
 The present (also called the present simple), which you use to describe situa-
tions, recurring actions, and habits:
Noi viviamo in Italia. (We live in Italy.)
Io leggo il giornale ogni mattina. (I read the paper every morning.)
 The present progressive, with which you talk about what’s happening or what
you’re doing at a specific moment:
Lia sta parlando al telefono. (Lia is talking on the phone.)
In this chapter, I show you how to form the present simple by adding endings to the
verb (as you do in English when you add -s to the third-person singular). I also show
how to form the present progressive, which you create by using the verb stare (to
stay, to be) in the present and adding the main verb in the gerund. Finally, I talk about
when to use the present or the present progressive and how to add verbs in the infini-
tive to modal auxiliaries such as potere (can, may) or dovere (must, shall). I also talk
about verbs that have no subject and how to add pronouns to verbs in the infinitive
and the gerund.
The Reliable Guys: Regular Verbs
Conjugated verbs are formed with a stem and an ending. The default form of the verb,
which you find in dictionaries, is the infinitive, as in to work. In Italian, most infinitives
end in -are, -ere, or -ire. When you take these endings out you are left with the stem
of the verb. Here are the three options, illustrated by three regular verbs:
 -are: guardare (to look at, to watch)
 -ere: temere (to fear)
 -ire: sentire (to hear)

Regular verbs form the present by adding endings to the stem according to a fixed
pattern, which changes depending on whether the verb ends in -are, -ere, or -ire. All
you have to do is to figure out the conjugation pattern and apply it to each verb of
that type. Table 9-1 shows you the regular verb endings. I follow that with a chart that
shows sample conjugations of a regular verb.

io guardo
noi guardiamo
tu guardi
voi guardate
lui/lei/Lei/esso guarda
loro/Loro/essi/esse guardano
Guardiamo sempre la TV. (We always watch TV.)
In order to preserve the hard sound of the infinitive, verbs ending in -care and -gare,
such as giocare (to play) and pagare (to pay), add an h before the suffixes beginning
with -e or -i. Verbs ending in -iare, such as studiare (to study) and consigliare (to
advise), keep only one i when the ending begins with i. But those accented on the i,
such as sciare (to ski), inviare (to send), and spiare (to spy), keep the i of the stem,
which means that in some persons they have two.
Conjugate the verbs listed in parentheses to match the subject.

Finding Surprises at Every Turn: 
Irregular Verbs
Verbs are classified regular or irregular depending on how they behave throughout
their entire conjugation, in all moods and tenses. So the remarks that follow explain
why a verb that may be regular in the present indicative — such as vedere (to see) —
is considered irregular: It changes the stem in the simple past, from ved- to vid-.
Verbs can be irregular in that they
 Change the stem in some persons within one tense: For example, essere (to be),
becomes io sono (I am), noi siamo (we are).
 Use one stem in one tense and a different stem in another one: For example, the
present indicative of vivere is regular, but its simple past (see Chapter 10) is
irregular, changing the stem from viv- to vis- in some persons.
 Take endings different from the regular ones: For example, the simple past of
cadere (to fall) is io caddi (I fell) rather than cadei, which is the form regular
verbs take in the first-person singular.
Auxiliary verbs and modal auxiliaries
Auxiliary verbs do what the adjective says: They help the main verb. The key auxiliary
verbs in Italian and English are essere (to be) and avere (to have), which people use
to construct compound tenses, as in Noi eravamo andati (We had gone).
Modal verbs, which provide different nuances to what you’re saying, also act as auxil-
iaries; they’re followed by the infinitive of the main verb. The modals include dovere
(must, shall), potere (can, may), and volere (will, to want to). Italian also uses sapere
as a modal auxiliary, meaning to know how to.

The following tables show the conjugation of the verbs essere and avere.

137
Chapter 9: Writing in the Present

Expressing mood with modal auxiliaries
Like their English counterparts, dovere (must, shall), potere (can, may), and volere
(will, to want to) are modal auxiliaries, which are usually followed by another verb in the
infinitive. Sapere (to know how to) can be used in the same way as the other modals.
The meanings of dovere and potere are close to those of their English counterparts,
with the following exceptions:
 Dovere also translates to have to, as in Devo parlargli (I have to talk to him).
And you can use dovere by itself, meaning I owe: Le devo la mia gratitudine 
(I owe her my gratitude).
 Potere means both can and may. For example: Posso entrare? (May I come in?)
or Puoi fare tu la spesa? (Can you do the shopping?). When you use can in
English to convey that you need to overcome an obstacle to do something,
Italian uses potere (can) or riuscire a (to succeed), as in these examples: Riesci 
a passare/Puoi passare dal salumiere? (Can you stop by the deli?) and Ugo
riesce a riparare la TV? (Will Ugo be able to repair the TV set?).
 Volere can be translated literally as will, as in he does as he wills. But in English,
will is used to convey the future, which you convey in Italian by adding specific
endings to the main verb (see Chapter 12). Italian volere corresponds to to want
to followed by an infinitive, as in Voglio parlare con lei (I do want to talk to her).
The following tables show conjugations of each of the modal auxiliary verbs.
dovere (must, shall)
io devo
noi dobbiamo
tu devi
voi dovete
lui/lei/Lei/esso/essa deve
loro/Loro/essi/esse devono
Devono andare a casa. (They must go home.)
potere (can, may)

Irregular verbs of the first conjugation: -are
Andare (to go), dare (to give), fare (to do, to make), and stare (to stay, to be) are the
only irregular verbs of this first conjugation, but they’re quite important. The follow-
ing tables show you the conjugations of all four verbs.
andare (to go)
io vado
noi andiamo
tu vai
voi andate
lui/lei/Lei/esso/essa va

17. _________________ tu all’ufficio postale?
18. I miei genitori _________________ bene.
19. Aldo _________________ in panetteria.
20. I miei amici _________________ una partita a carte.
Irregular verbs of the second conjugation: -ere
Most irregular verbs belong to the second conjugation, so it’s impossible to list them
all here. What I give you is patterns of change so that if you know that cogliere
changes the stem to colgo- in the first-person singular of the present indicative, you
can try your best guess with togliere and see whether it does the same (it does).
Among verbs ending in -cere, some you use all the time are irregular. They include
piacere (to please, but it corresponds in meaning to to like), dispiacere (to be sorry),
tacere (to be silent), and giacere (to lie down). For these verbs, you double the c in
the first-person singular and the first- and third-person plural. Note: Piacere is used
primarily in third-person singular and plural forms.
140
Part III: What Would You Do without Verbs and Tenses? 

piacere (to be pleasing)
io piaccio
noi piacciamo
tu piaci
voi piacete
lui/lei/Lei/esso/essa piace
loro/Loro/essi/esse piacciono
Mi piacciono le pesche. (I like peaches.)
Bere (to drink) and sedere/sedersi (to sit) are even more irregular. Bere changes the
stem to bev- in all persons.
bere (to drink)
io bevo
noi beviamo
tu bevi
voi bevete
lui/lei/Lei/esso/essa beve
loro/Loro/essi/esse bevono
Bevono solo acqua. (They drink only water.)
Sedere/sedersi uses the stem sied- in all persons except the first- and second-person
plural. Sedersi is a reflexive verb, so I’ve included the reflexive pronouns in parenthe-
ses. (I illustrate how to form and use reflexive verbs in Chapter 17.)
sedere/sedersi (to sit down)
io (mi) siedo
noi (ci) sediamo
tu (ti) siedi
voi (vi) sedete
lui/lei/Lei/esso/essa (si) siede
loro/Loro/essi/esse (si) siedono
Anna siede a capotavola. (Anna sits at the head of the table.)
Rimanere (to remain) changes the stem in the first-person singular and the third-
person plural, which drops the -ere and becomes rimang-. Verbs that behave like
rimanere include dolere (to hurt, to feel sorry) and valere (to be worth).
rimanere (to remain)
io rimango
noi rimaniamo
tu rimani
voi rimanete
lui/lei/Lei/esso/essa rimane
loro/Loro/essi/esse rimangono
Rimanete a Pairigi? (Will you remain in Paris?)
The verb tenere (to keep) changes the stem to teng- in the first-person singular and
third-person plural and to tien- in the second- and third-person singular. All verbs
formed by adding prefixes to tenere do the same, including appartenere (to belong),
mantenere (to maintain), ottenere (to obtain), and ritenere (to think).
141
Chapter 9: Writing in the Present

tenere (to keep)
io tengo
noi teniamo
tu tieni
voi tenete
lui/lei/Lei/esso/essa tiene
loro/Loro/essi/esse tengono
Tengono i nostri documenti. (They keep our documents.)
Spegnere (to turn off) also takes the form spengere, transposing the g and n. The
first-person singular and plural come from spengere, and the other persons come
from spegnere.
spengere/spegnere (to turn off )
io spengo
noi spegniamo
tu spegni
voi spegnete
lui spegne
loro spengono
Spegniamo la luce. (We turn the light off.)
Some verbs change gl to lg for the stem of the first-person singular and the third-
person plural. For example, the stem of scegliere (to choose) becomes scelg- for those
persons, but it otherwise uses the standard scegl- stem you get from cutting the ending
off the infinitive. The verbs cogliere (to pick) and togliere (to take out) behave the
same way.
scegliere (to choose)
io scelgo
noi scegliamo
tu scegli
voi scegliete
lui/lei/Lei/esso/essa sceglie
loro/Loro/essi/esse scelgono
Scegliamo la tua proposta. (We choose your proposal.)
Irregular verbs of the third conjugation: -ire
The third conjugation in -ire has fewer irregular verbs. I illustrate some basic patterns
in this section.
Salire (to get on, to go up) changes the stem to salg- in the first-person singular and
the third-person plural.
RULES
142
Part III: What Would You Do without Verbs and Tenses? 

salire (to get on, to go up)
io salgo
noi saliamo
tu sali
voi salite
lui/lei/Lei/esso/essa sale
loro/Loro/essi/esse salgono
Salgono sull’autobus. (They’re getting on the bus.)
A lot of verbs in ending -ire add -isc- to the stem in the first- and third-person singular
and the third-person plural before adding the regular endings. The following table
shows the conjugation of agire (to act, to behave) as an example.
agire (to act, to behave)
io agisco
noi agiamo
tu agisci
voi agite
lui/lei/Lei/esso/essa agisce
loro/Loro/essi/esse agiscono
Anna agisce onestamente. (Anna behaves honestly.)
Here are some other common verbs included in this group. Consult a dictionary if you
find a verb you don’t know and you think it may behave like these.
143
Chapter 9: Writing in the Present
 capire (to understand)
 colpire (to hit, to strike)
 costruire (to build)
 finire (to end, to finish)
 guarire (to recover, to heal)
 gestire (to manage)
 preferire (to prefer)
 restituire (to return)
 spedire (to send, to mail)
 tossire (to cough)
 tradire (to betray)
 unire (to unite)
Apparire (to appear) doesn’t add -isc-, but it does drop the r and adds an -i- in the
first-person singular and the third-person plural: io appaio, tu appari, lui/lei/Lei/esso/
essa appare, noi appariamo, voi apparite, loro/Loro/essi/esse appaiono. Riapparire
(to reappear) and scomparire (to disappear) follow the same pattern.
Even more irregular are the verbs dire (to say, to tell), morire (to die), uscire (to go
out), and venire. Consult a dictionary or Italian Verbs For Dummies, by Teresa L.
Picarazzi (Wiley), for the conjugations.
Modify the verbs listed in parentheses to match the subjects.

A. lei chiarisce (she clarifies)
21. lui _________________ (colpire)

24. voi _________________ (conoscere)
25. loro _________________ (proibire)
26. tu _________________ (gestire)
27. noi _________________ (dormire)

More irregular verbs: Those that end 
in -arre, -urre, and -orre
Some Italian verbs don’t exhibit regular endings in the infinitive. These verbs end in 
-arre, -urre, or -orre.
Verbs ending in -arre, such as trarre (to draw), change those ending letters to -agg- in
the first-person singular and the third-person plural. They behave as if they were reg-
ular verbs in -are in the second-person singular and first- and second-person plural.
Other verbs that follow this pattern include attrarre (to attract), contrarre (to con-
tract, to narrow), and distrarre (to distract).
trarre (to draw)
io traggo
noi traiamo
tu trai
voi traete
lui/lei/Lei/esso/essa trae
loro/Loro/essi/esse traggono
Traggono le loro conclusioni. (They’re drawing their own conclusions.)
Verbs ending in -orre, such as porre (to put), add -ong- to the stem in the first-person
singular and third-person plural. They take pon- in the second-person singular and
the first- and second-person plural.
porre (to put, to suppose)
io pongo
noi poniamo
tu poni
voi ponete
lui/lei/Lei/esso/essa pone
loro/Loro/essi/esse pongono
Pongono la prima pietra. (They’re laying the foundation stone.)
The following verbs end in -orre and behave like porre:
144
Part III: What Would You Do without Verbs and Tenses? 
 deporre (to depose)
 imporre (to impose)
 opporre (to oppose)
 proporre (to propose)
 supporre (to suppose)
And verbs ending in -urre, such as produrre (to produce), add -uc- to the stem before
adding the standard endings.
produrre (to produce)
io produco
noi produciamo
tu produci
voi producete
lui/lei/Lei/esso/essa produce
loro/Loro/essi/esse producono
L’Italia produce molto vino. (Italy produces a lot of wine.)

The following verbs behave like produrre:
145
Chapter 9: Writing in the Present
 condurre (to conduct)
 introdurre (to introduce)
 ridurre (to reduce)
 sedurre (to seduce)
Having to Do without a Subject: 
Impersonal Verbs
You can have people doing things, or you can have things happening without anyone in
particular doing them. Italian has several verbs called impersonal verbs that need no
subject. In English, if you use a verb in the third-person singular, it takes it as its subject.
You use these impersonal verbs only in the third-person singular in finite forms such
as the present indicative or the past simple, and you use them in the infinitive, the
past participle, and the gerund. Several verbs regarding the weather are impersonal,
including the following common ones:
 lampeggiare (to flash [lightning]) →lampeggia (there’s lightning)
 nevicare (to snow) →nevica (it snows)
 piovere (to rain) →piove (it rains)
 tirare vento (to be windy) →tira vento (it’s windy)
 tuonare (to thunder) →tuona (it thunders)
Other weather-related verbs are formed with fare (to do) + an adjective or noun, 
such as:
 fare freddo (to be cold) →fa freddo (it’s cold)
 fare caldo (to be hot) →fa caldo (it’s hot)
Here are some other impersonal verbs that have nothing to do with the weather but
are used often:
 bisognare (need, to have to) →bisogna, as in Bisogna partire. (It’s necessary to
leave.)
 bastare (to be sufficient) →basta, as in Basta parlarle. (It’s sufficient to talk to her.)
 cominciare (to begin), →comincia, as in Comincia a piovere. (It’s beginning to
rain.)
 importare (to matter) →importa, as in Importa che cosa pensano loro. (It mat-
ters what they think.)
Don’t confuse the two meanings of importare, to matter and to import, as in
Importano mele dal Giappone (They import apples from Japan).
 sembrare (to seem) conjugates to sembra, as in Mi sembra giusto. (It seems right 
to me.)

You can use essere followed by an adjective, an adverb, or a noun, as an impersonal
verb, as in È ora di andare (It’s time to go). In English, it’s similar to saying It’s beauti-
ful/important/a shame.
Out of the list of impersonal verbs, bastare, cominciare, importare (to matter), and
sembrare can be used either impersonally or personally, as in the following examples:
Le mele bastano. (The apples we have are sufficient.)
Cominciamo il lavoro domani. (We’ll start our job tomorrow.)
Le loro opinioni importano molto. (Their opinions matter a lot.)
Sembrano contenti. (They seem happy.)
What’s Happening Right Now: 
The Present Progressive Tense
In Italian, you can convey that you’re in the midst of doing something with the pres-
ent simple or with the present progressive. For instance, if someone asks you Che
cosa stai facendo? (What are you doing?), you can answer Sto lavando la macchina
(I’m washing the car) or Lavo la macchina (I wash the car). Both are equally correct
and idiomatic. But you should use the present progressive when you want to empha-
size what’s happening in that specific moment: Abbassa la TV. Non vedi che sto par-
lando al telefono? (Turn down the TV. Don’t you see I’m speaking on the phone?); Sta
cominciando a piovere (It’s beginning to rain).
In Italian, you use only the present simple, not the present progressive, with essere (to
be) or stare (to stay, to be) to talk about conditions in general, as in Pietro è gentile
con te (Pietro is being nice to you); Indossa un vestito blu (She’s wearing a blue dress).
You form the present progressive by adding the gerund to the verb stare, as in Stiamo
mangiando (We’re eating). The gerund is invariable in gender and number, so you
don’t have to match it to any other word. To form it, you add -ando to the stem of an 
-are verb, or add -endo to the stem of an -ere or -ire verb. Table 9-2 illustrates the pat-
terns for sample verbs of the three conjugations.

Part III: What Would You Do without Verbs and Tenses? 

Most verbs form the gerund regularly. Even those ending in -ire, which add -isc- to
some persons, follow a regular pattern. For instance, you form the gerund as finendo
(finishing), from the infinitive finire (to finish).
Most of the verbs that form the gerund irregularly are verbs that add some letters to
the stem, such as bere (to drink), which becomes bev- and has the gerund bevendo
(drinking). The main irregular verbs follow; I give the infinitive first followed by the
gerund:
 condurre (to lead) →conducendo (leading)
 bere (to drink) →bevendo (drinking)
 dire (to say) →dicendo (saying)
 fare (to do) →facendo (doing)
 porre (to lay) →ponendo (laying)
 produrre (to produce) →producendo (producing)
 trarre (to draw) →traendo (drawing)

Using Pronouns with Verbs in 
the Infinitive or the Gerund
With a verbal form composed of a modal auxiliary and a verb in the infinitive or a
present progressive (with the gerund), and with an unstressed pronoun that conveys
either a direct object (such as mi [me] or la [her]) or an indirect object meaning to or
for (such as gli [to him]; check Chapter 4 on pronouns for more information), you can
place these pronouns in two different places without any change in meaning. It’s only
a matter of taste and style. Here are your options:
RULES
147
Chapter 9: Writing in the Present

 Place the pronoun before the modal auxiliary and before the present progressive
form: Lo posso fare (I can do it); Vi sto parlando (I’m talking to you).
 Attach the pronoun to the verb in the infinitive or the verb in the gerund: Posso
farlo (I can do it); Sto parlandovi (I’m talking to you).
The infinitive drops the final -e to ease pronunciation, as in Dobbiamo vender-
glielo (We must sell it to him/her).
In Table 9-3, I list the personal pronouns you can place in those positions (but refer to
Chapter 4 for a full list and for a review of their functions). For each pronoun type, the
table shows both pronoun placements for an example sentence with a modal auxil-
iary and an example sentence in the present progressive. (The pronouns are under-
lined in the examples.) As you can see, when you have a modal auxiliary followed by
an infinitive, you can place any unstressed pronoun before the verbal form, as in Lo
posso aiutare; or attached to the infinitive, as in Posso aiutarlo (I can help him).
When you have the present progressive, you can add any unstressed pronoun before
the verbal form, as in Lo sto aiutando; or attached to the gerund, as in Sto aiutandolo
(I’m helping him).

Glancing Back at the Past: 
The Present Perfect and Preterit
In This Chapter
 Forming past participles
 Choosing the right auxiliary
 Making sure the past participle coordinates with the subject or object
 Using the present perfect with modal auxiliaries
 Recognizing the preterit
W
hen you talk or write about the past in English you mostly use the simple past.
You say I went home no matter whether you went home two minutes ago or
two months ago. In Italian, you mostly use the present perfect, or passato prossimo
(literally, near past). For example, Sono andata a casa (I went home). Italian has 
two other forms that you translate in English with the simple past: the imperfetto
(imperfect) and the preterit (known by Italians as the passato remoto). In this chapter
I focus on the present perfect, which is the most common form of the past tense and
at the end of the chapter I talk about the preterit, which is used primarily in historical
narratives and fairy tales. In Chapter 11 I cover the imperfect tense.
The present perfect tense is a compound tense because it comprises an auxiliary and
the verb that conveys the action you’re talking about. In Italian the present perfect is
made of the present indicative of either avere (to have) or essere (to be) and the past
participle of the main verb, as in Ho mangiato il gelato (I ate the ice cream).
In order to form the present perfect of a particular verb, you need to follow these
steps:
1. Choose between essere (to be) and avere (to have) as the auxiliary verb.
2. Modify the verb’s infinitive in order to turn it into a past participle.
3. Choose the ending of the past participle, which may take the default form in -o or
may need to be coordinated with the subject or the object of the sentence.
Later in this chapter, I explain how you can add a modal auxiliary (can, may, shall,
must, will) to a verbal form in the present perfect, as in Ho potuto vederlo (I was able
to see him/I could see him).

Step 1: Turning a Verb into a Past Participle
Words such as amato (loved), andato (gone), tenuto (kept), visto (seen), and studiato
(studied) are past participles. They’re forms of the verbs used in several compound
tenses (for a complete list, see the table about moods and tenses on the Cheat Sheet).
In Italian, past participles behave like adjectives (see Chapter 5), varying in gender
and number, because in most cases they must be coordinated with the words they
refer to.
I deal with coordination between past participle and subject or object of the sentence
in the section, “Step 3: Coordinating the Past Participle with the Subject or Object,”
later in this chapter. I start with telling you how to form past participles.
Forming the past participle of regular verbs
In Chapter 9 I talk about regular and irregular verbs, and I warn you that a verb may
be regular in the present tense and irregular in another tense, such as the preterit.
When it comes to the past participle, most verbs, even those that are irregular in
other tenses, form the past participle according to the rules I spell out in this section.
Table 10-1 starts you off with regular verbs.
Table 10-1
Forming the Past Participles of Regular Verbs
Infinitive
Singular Past 
Plural Past 
Translation
Participle (M, F)
Participle (M, F)
guardare (to look at, 
guardato, guardata
guardati, guardate
looked at, watched
to watch)
temere (to fear)
temuto, temuta
temuti, temute
feared
sentire (to hear)
sentito, sentita
sentiti, sentite
heard
The verb fare only keeps the f- of the infinitive and doubles the -t- to become fatto,
fatta, fatti, fatte; dare keeps the d- and becomes dato, data, dati, date.
Verbs of the second conjugation in -cere and -scere add an -i before the suffixes of the
past participle in order to preserve the soft sound of the infinitive. For example,
conoscere (to know) →conosciuto, conosciuta, conosciuti, conosciute (known).
Forming the past participle of irregular verbs
Even with irregular verbs, the endings of the past participles never change. What
changes is the stem of the verb, which in most cases loses some letters — really, it
contracts. Remember that verbs formed by adding prefixes to the main verb take the
same ending as the basic verb when it comes to the past participle. So rompere
(to break) →rotto (broken), and corrompere (to corrupt) →corrotto (corrupted).
RULES
154
Part III: What Would You Do without Verbs and Tenses? 

Irregular verbs of the second conjugation
You find many irregular verbs in the second conjugation in -ere. Most of them form
the past participle by contracting the infinitive before adding the endings. For exam-
ple, rimanere (to remain) drops -nere and becomes rimasto, rimasta, rimasti,
rimaste; dipingere (to paint) drops the -gere and becomes dipinto. Because patterns
are erratic to say the least, my suggestion is this: Learn them by heart as you
encounter them, and check a dictionary when you want to use a new verb. After all,
that’s what learners of English have to do with verbs such as to go, which becomes
gone in the past participle.
Table 10-2 lists the most common irregular verbs ending in -ere.

Irregular verbs of the third conjugation
A few verbs of the third conjugation in -ire are irregular. They behave similarly to the
verbs of the second conjugation that drop pieces of the infinitive before adding the
endings of the past participle. Table 10-3 lists the most important irregular -ire verbs.
Some verbs begin their lives with a contracted infinitive. Their past participles are
erratic, so here comes one more short list for you to learn. The basic ones are trarre
(to draw) →tratto (drawn); porre (to put, to lay) →posto (put, laid); and produrre
(to produce) →prodotto (produced).

Chapter 10: Glancing Back at the Past: The Present Perfect and Preterit
Step 2: Figuring Out Which Auxiliary to Use
When you want to form any compound tense that requires the past participle, you
need to choose between the auxiliaries avere and essere. In order to make that
choice, you have to know
 Whether the verb is active (Io vado [I’m going]), passive (Il film è girato
[The film is shot]), or reflexive (Io mi guardo [I’m looking at myself]). Consult
Chapter 17 for coverage of the passive and reflexive uses of verbs.
 Whether the verb is transitive (Luigi ama Susanna [Luigi loves Susanna]) or
intransitive (Bruno corre [Bruno runs/is running]).
In this chapter, I only talk about the active form of transitive and intransitive verbs.
The distinction between transitive and intransitive verbs is clear-cut in Italian. When
a verb can be followed directly by an object (called, in fact, the direct object), it’s tran-
sitive, as in Suono il pianoforte (I play the piano). So transitive means that the verb’s
action is transferred to an object directly, without adding any other part of speech 
(in particular a preposition). When you have a preposition plus a person, the noun 
is an indirect object, which takes a transitive verb — for example, Ho scritto a Mirko
(I wrote to Mirko). Intransitive verbs take a preposition, but the preposition is usually
coupled with a place, as in Vado in ufficio (I’m going to the office).
I’m not saying that in real life you always find verbs followed by objects, direct or
indirect. I’m saying that a transitive verb can be followed by a direct object, whereas
an intransitive verb cannot. But you can use a transitive verb by itself, without
expressing the object, as in Le scrivo (I’m writing to her). And you can use an intransi-
tive verb by itself, for example when you say Vengo (I’m coming). But scrivere is tran-
sitive because you can add a direct object to it: Le scrivo una cartolina (I’m writing
her a postcard); and venire isn’t transitive because if you add an object, you do need
a preposition: Lui arriva da Mosca (He’s coming from Moscow). Any Italian dictionary
will tell you whether the verb is transitive (v. tr.) or intransitive (v. intr.).
In English, the presence of a preposition isn’t decisive when it comes to determining
whether a verb is transitive or intransitive. If you say, I’ve looked for you all day, the
verb to look for is transitive because the verb isn’t to look but to look for. If you
change the preposition from for to at, the meaning changes completely. And to look
used by itself has a third meaning (and is an intransitive verb). Verb + preposition
packages are called phrasal verbs, of which English has a lot and Italian only a few. So
when you encounter a verb with a preposition, the presence of the preposition and a
place is a good indicator that the verb is intransitive.
You need the auxiliary avere (to have) with the following verbs:
 Avere, which is transitive and regular in its past participle, avuto (had)
Donatella ha avuto fortuna. (Donatella has had good luck.)
 Transitive verbs in the active form, such as amare (to love), leggere (to read),
and mandare (to send)
Ho cercato tuo fratello. (I looked for your brother.)

 A few intransitive verbs that convey an action performed by the subject (except
verbs of motion), such as dormire (to sleep), pranzare/cenare (to dine), parlare
(to speak), and gridare (to shout)
Ho dormito poco. (I slept very little.)
You need the auxiliary essere (to be) with the following intransitive verbs:
 Essere, which becomes stato, stata, stati, state (been)
Sei stato in Cina? (Have you been to China?)
 Stare (to stay and to be in set phrases such as stare bene/male [to be well/
unwell]), which takes the same past participle as essere: stato, stata, stati, state
(stayed, felt)
Lucio è stato male. (Lucio was ill.)
 Most verbs of motion, used literally or metaphorically
Siamo arrivati a Hong Kong. (We arrived at Hong Kong.)
Il dollaro è sceso rispetto all’euro. (The dollar has fallen against the euro.)
 Most intransitive verbs conveying a change of status in the subject, such as
invecchiare (to age), nascere (to be born), crescere (to grow up), and morire
(to die)
Mio padre è invecchiato molto. (My father has aged a lot.)
 Reflexive verbs, such as lavarsi (to wash oneself) and addormentarsi
(to fall asleep)
Mi sono svegliato. (I woke up.)
Mi sono tagliato un dito. (I cut my finger.)
 The passive voice, as in essere amato (to be loved) and essere mangiato
(to be eaten)
La casa è stata venduta. (The house has been sold.)
See Chapter 17 for more on the reflexive and passive constructions.
You can use either avere or essere with the following verbs:
 Those conveying weather conditions, such as piovere (to rain), nevicare
(to snow), and grandinare (to hail). For example, È/Ha piovuto (It rained). You
use them only in the third-person singular without any subject. (Check Chapter 9
for details.)
 Some verbs of motion, such as correre (to run), passare (to spend [time], to go
by), finire (to end, to finish), and volare (to fly). These verbs take essere when
you use them without a direct object and avere with a direct object. For exam-
ple, Sono corsi a casa (They ran home); but Hanno corso la Maratona di 
New York (They ran the New York Marathon). Also included in this category is
cominciare (to begin), which takes essere when you use it without any subject,
as in È cominciato a piovere (It started to rain), and takes avere when it’s used
with a subject, as in Abbiamo cominciato le vacanze (We began our vacation).
158
Part III: What Would You Do without Verbs and Tenses? 

The intransitive verb vivere (to live, to reside) can take both avere and essere with-
out any change in meaning, as in Hanno vissuto dieci anni a Barcellona/Sono vissuti
dieci anni a Barcellona (They lived ten years in Barcelona).
Using the words in parentheses, add the appropriate auxiliaries to the following 
sentences.
Q. Sono _________________ dieci anni in Argentina. (vivere)
A. Sono vissuti dieci anni in Argentina. (They lived ten years in Argentina.)
23. Con chi _________________ tu? (parlare)
24. Dopo quella gita, loro _________________ dieci ore filate! (dormire)
25. I miei colleghi _________________ in Marocco. (essere)
26. Mio figlio _________________ di dieci centimetri in un anno! (crescere)
27. I miei figli _________________ Il signore degli anelli. (vedere)
28. Voi _________________ allo stadio? (andare)
Step 3: Coordinating the Past Participle 
with the Subject or Object
Since past participles have four endings, you have to decide what words to match
them to, just like you do with adjectives. Here are three possibilities you may have: 
 You choose the -o ending of the past participle when the auxiliary is avere
followed by
• A transitive verb used by itself or followed by an expressed direct object;
for example, Mia sorella ha già mangiato (My sister has eaten); Mia sorella
ha mangiato la carne (My sister has eaten the meat).
• An intransitive verb that takes avere, including correre (to run), vivere
(to live), and agire (to behave). For example, Ida e Gianna non hanno 
dormito (Ida and Gianna didn’t sleep).
 You have to coordinate the past participle with the subject (see Chapter 2 on
coordination), when the auxiliary is essere and
• The verb is intransitive (the action is performed by the subject and the
verb stands alone or takes no direct object). For example, Pietro e Gianni
sono andati via (Pietro and Gianni left).
• The verb is reflexive (the subject is also the recipient of the action). For
example, I due ragazzi si sono lavati (The two boys washed themselves). 
(I cover the reflexive in depth in Chapter 17.)
• The verb is in the passive voice (the action is performed upon the subject
by someone else). For example, L’attrice è stata premiata con l’Oscar dalla
giuria (The actress was awarded an Oscar by the jury). (I cover the passive
voice in Chapter 17.)
159
Chapter 10: Glancing Back at the Past: The Present Perfect and Preterit

 You have to coordinate the past participle with the direct object of a sentence when
the auxiliary is avere and the object precedes the verb, which happens when
• You use the direct object pronouns mi, ti, lo, la, ci, vi, li, le (me, you, 
him, her, it, us, you, them), which are placed before the verb. For example,
“Hai visto i miei fratelli?” “Sì, li ho visti andare via” (“Did you see my
brothers?” “I saw them leave”).
• You use the pronoun ne (of this/that/these/those), which refers to some-
thing already mentioned (see Chapter 4 for more information on pronouns
and ne in particular). Because ne is invariable, you have to look for the
word that it replaces in order to ascertain its gender and number. For
example, “Quanti libri hai letto?” “Ne ho letti sei” (“Did you read all those
books?” “I read six of them”).
Use the words in parentheses to add the appropriate past participles to the following
sentences, matching them to the appropriate words if necessary.
Q. Abbiamo _________________ bene in quel ristorante. (cenare)
A. Abbiamo cenato bene in quel ristorante. (We dined well in that restaurant.)
29. “Avete pagato le mele?” “Le abbiamo _________________.” (pagare)
30. “Avete trovato delle albicocche?” Non ne abbiamo _________________.” (trovare)
31. “Hai visto Elena?” “Non l’ho _________________.” (vedere)
32. I miei genitori sono _________________ a Parigi per Pasqua. (essere)
33. Mirella è _________________ molti anni in Australia. (vivere)
34. Mirella ha _________________ a lungo da sola. (vivere)
35. Nell’incidente aereo sono _________________ centocinquante persone. (morire)
Adding a Modal Auxiliary to a Verbal Form
in the Present Perfect
In English, you can’t form the present perfect of the modal auxiliaries can, may, shall,
must, or will. In fact, you use substitutes (for other tenses as well): to be able to or to
have the possibility of for can or may; to have to for must or shall; and to want to for
will. You can form the present perfect and then add the verb that conveys the main
action. That’s what you do in Italian with the modal auxiliaries themselves: dovere
(must, shall), potere (can, may), or volere (will, to want, to wish). You form the pres-
ent perfect and add an infinitive. For example, Ho potuto aiutare mio fratello (I was
able to help my brother). Of course, you still have to choose an auxiliary: Usually you
adopt the one of the infinitive that follows. Therefore, you have three cases:
 If you use a modal auxiliary, for example potere (can, to be able to), and you want
to form the present perfect followed by the verb leggere, which is transitive and
takes avere, you say Ho potuto leggere la tua lettera (I was able to/could read
your letter).
160
Part III: What Would You Do without Verbs and Tenses? 

 If you use a modal auxiliary, for example dovere (must, shall, to have to), and you
use it with the verb camminare, which is intransitive but takes avere, you say
Hanno dovuto camminare per tre ore (They had to walk for three hours).
 If you use a modal auxiliary, for example volere (to want to), and you use it with
the verb tornare, which is intransitive and takes essere, you say Sono voluti
tornare (They wanted to come back).
You use the auxiliary avere when the modal auxiliary introduces the verb essere
(to be). For example, Ho potuto essere generoso (I’ve been able to/I could be generous).
Based on the appointments listed on the following agenda, write sentences describing
what you did between May 13 and May 20, 2007. Add the modal auxiliaries listed in
parentheses to each of your sentences, and write all sentences in the present perfect
tense. Because the sentences are in the first-person singular, you have to decide whether
you’re writing them as a man or a woman. I give you both options in the answer key.

Writing and Reading about 
the Distant Past: The Preterit
The preterit tense (or, in Italian, the passato remoto), is used to express events that
took place in the distant past and have no relationship with the present. It is used fre-
quently in writing, especially in narratives. Nowadays, in spoken Italian, the tense
used mostly to talk about the past is the present perfect, but in some central and
southern regions of Italy people use the preterit. Here are two examples of the
preterit in action:
Dante nacque nel 1265. (Dante was born in 1265.)
Manzoni scrisse I Promessi Sposi. (Manzoni wrote the Promessi Sposi.) 
Even though the majority of Italians use the present perfect for talking and writing,
the preterit is used in fairy tales, short stories, and novels as well as when describing
historical events in nonfiction biographies, histories, and encyclopedia articles, so
you do need to recognize it. Unfortunately, it’s the most irregular of all verb forms in
Italian.

The preterit of regular verbs
As with all regular verbs, the regulars of the preterit vary their endings depending on
the verb’s conjugation. I list them in Table 10-4, followed by an example for the three
conjugations.

Complete each sentence with the verb in the preterit; use the verb provided in paren-
theses, which conjugates regularly in the preterit. For verbs in which the person has
more than one possible conjugation, use the more common version.
Q. Noi _________________ a lungo. (dormire)
A. Noi dormimmo a lungo. (We slept a lot.)
43. Tu _________________ a scuola. (andare)
44. Voi _________________ per la Polonia. (partire)
45. Mia sorella _________________ di perdere il bambino. (temere)
46. Suo marito _________________ il garage. (pulire)
47. Tu ed io _________________ la sua posizione. (capire)
The preterit of irregular verbs
Many irregular verbs have only the first-person singular and the third-person singu-
lar and plural irregular (1, 3, 3, pattern). The tu, noi, and voi form are regular; for
example, the verbs scrivere (to write), piacere (to like), mettere (to put), conoscere
(to know). Take a look at the sample conjugation for scrivere; when you know the
infinitive and the first-person singular (scrissi) you can easily form the other two per-
sons (scrisse and scrissero). The tu form is the regular -esti ending; the noi form
takes -emmo, and the voi form uses -este (the regular second conjugation endings).
You can find the various conjugations for other verbs in Appendix A.
scrivere (to write)
io scrissi
noi scrivemmo
tu scrivesti
voi scriveste
lui/lei/Lei/esso/essa scrisse
loro/Loro/essi/esse scrissero
Scrissero molto durante le vacanze. (They wrote a lot during the holidays.)

51. venire (to come), venni, _________________, _________________, _________________,
_________________, _________________
52. vivere (to live ), vissi, _________________, _________________, _________________,
_________________, _________________
Some verbs, though, do not derive directly from the infinitive and don’t follow the 
1, 3, 3 pattern. For example, dare (to give), dire (to say), bere (to drink), stare
(to stay), and fare (to do, to make) are entirely irregular in the preterit. Because the
preterit has so many variations, and because you won’t use it enough to justify mem-
orizing all the conjugations in this erratic tense, your best bet is to simply look up the
conjugations for verbs in this tense when you need them. I provide the conjugations
of the most commonly used verbs in Appendix A, but any English-Italian 
dictionary will provide them as well.
Fill in the blanks with the preterit of the verbs provided in parentheses. Use Appendix
A or a dictionary to find the conjugations.
Q. Tu _________________ molto amareggiato. (rimanere)
A. Tu rimanesti molto amareggiato. (You were really disappointed.)
53. A Bianca _________________ lo spettacolo. (piacere)
54. Carlo _________________ un passaggio a Elisa. (dare)
55. I ragazzi _________________ una corsa. (fare)
56. Lui _________________ un quesito. (porre)
57. Loro _________________ le trattative. (aprire)
Even though the preterit is the tense of historical and fictional writing, writers can
write in any tense — it all depends on what they want to convey. As a writer, you may
practice whichever tense is better suited to the situation. The passage you find in this
exercise is in the present tense, which conveys closeness. It’s as if you were right there
where the action is taking place. The preterit, on the other hand, creates more dis-
tance between yourself and what you’re narrating. It’s definitive; things happened in a
certain way and can’t be changed. Do you want closeness or distance? Perhaps in the
preterit the following story is more poignant and sad. Transpose all the verbs that are
in the present tense into the preterit, except for the ones I underline and for which I

verbs because the first one, riporta, should be changed to the imperfect (Chapter 11),
and the second one, poteva essere, should be changed to the past conditional

When Things Lasted (In the Past): 
The Imperfect
In This Chapter
 Conjugating the imperfect
 Knowing when to use the imperfect
 Touching on the imperfect progressive
 Comparing the imperfect and the present perfect
 Going farther back in time with the past perfect
T
he imperfect is true to its name because when you use it, you don’t focus on
whether or not the action you’re talking about was concluded sometime in 
the past but rather on the fact that it lasted for a while. For example, Quando era 
giovane, andava ogni weekend a ballare (When she was young, she went dancing
every weekend). In this statement, you don’t know if she’s still dancing or how well;
all you’re interested in is that she used to do it in the past. In English you can convey
an imperfect action in the past with the formula used to + infinitive.
Because the imperfect allows you to talk about things that lasted in the past, it’s also
very useful when you want to talk about feelings, emotions, states of affairs, and
habits. Here are some situations you can use as guidelines for choosing the imperfect
over another past tense. You employ it to talk about
 Conditions and states of affairs: Quando ero bambino andavo a scuola vicino a
casa. (When I was a child, I went to a school close to home.)
 Actions that may have or may not have been completed in the past but that were
happening at the time: Quando suo fratello ha telefonato, Ada scriveva una let-
tera. (When her brother called, Ada was writing a letter.)
 Habitual activities: Quando ero bambino, passavo sempre l’estate in montagna.
(When I was a child, I used to spend/I would always spend the summer in the 
mountains.)

Note: You’ll find the imperfect commonly used in journalism because it’s ideal for narra-
tives, even if the action is over and done with. For example, Ieri tre operai morivano in
una fonderia, uccisi da un tubo di metallo che cadeva dal soffitto. (Yesterday, three
workers died in a foundry, killed by a metal tube that fell from the ceiling).
The imperfect is a simple tense. As usual, you’ll encounter regular and irregular
verbs, but fortunately the imperfect doesn’t have many irregularities; I outline the
major ones in this chapter. Besides telling you how to form the imperfect of regular
and irregular verbs, in this chapter I give you some guidelines on how to choose
between the present perfect and the imperfect and when to use the imperfect pro-
gressive (yes, Italian has that one too) rather than the imperfect. I also mention the
trapassato prossimo (past perfect), which you use when two things occurred in the
past but one is closer to you in time than the other.
Forming the Imperfect
Luckily for you, the imperfect is a very regular tense, even for verbs that are irregular
in other tenses. And even with the few verbs that are irregular in the imperfect, what
changes is the stem of the verb; the endings are always the same. In this section, I
start by telling you what the endings are, and then I move on to the few irregularities
you’ll encounter.
Adding endings to regular verbs
Italian has three conjugations, for which the endings are -are, -ere, and -ire. To form
the imperfect, you add endings to the stem of the verb, which you get by dropping
the infinitive ending. So the stem of guardare (to look at, to watch) is guard-, of
temere (to fear) is tem-, and of sentire (to hear) is sent-. The endings that you apply
for the imperfect vary depending on the verb’s conjugation. I list the endings in Table
11-1 and then provide a sample conjugation.

io guardavo
noi guardavamo
tu guardavi
voi guardavate
lui/lei/Lei/esso/essa guardava
loro/Loro/essi/esse guardavano
Loro guardavano un film. (They were watching a movie.)
The auxiliary verb avere — as well as the modal auxiliaries dovere (must, shall), potere
(can, may), volere (will, want), and sapere (to know how to), which usually are followed
by a verb in the infinitive — form the imperfect regularly, but in other tenses they’re
irregular. The following list shows the meanings of the modal auxiliaries in the imper-
fect tense. I provide them in the first-person singular, but you have to choose the appro-
priate person (first-, second-, or third-person singular or plural) when you use them.
 Potevo (could, was able to, was capable of): Conveys capacity, power, or permis-
sion. For example, Poteva lavorare solo due ore al giorno (She could only work
two hours a day).
 Dovevo (had to): Conveys necessity, need, or obligation. For example, Dovevano
parlargli prima di partire (They had to talk to him before leaving).
 Volevo (wanted to): Conveys intention or desire. For example, I bambini vole-
vano giocare a calcio (The children wanted to play soccer).
 Sapevo (could): Conveys skill and ability. For example, Sapeva giocare a golf
(She could play golf/She knew how to play golf).
A few scoundrels: Irregular verbs
As I say throughout this book, in most cases it’s hard to give criteria for recognizing
irregular verbs. All I can do is to list them, and all you can do is to learn them by heart
(or consult a dictionary). This section covers irregular verbs in the imperfect.
Essere (to be): Always irregular
The verb essere (to be) is irregular in all moods and tenses. In the imperfect, it takes a
special stem, er-, and adds the endings of the first conjugation in -are (even if in the
infinitive it’s a verb of the second conjugation in -ere), but after dropping the letters 
-av-, except in the first- and second-persons plural. Here’s the conjugation (quite hon-
estly, it’s easier to show you than to explain!):
essere (to be)
io ero
noi eravamo
tu eri
voi eravate
lui/lei/Lei/esso/essa era
loro/Loro/essi/esse erano
Io ero stanca. (I was tired.)
173
Chapter 11: When Things Lasted (In the Past): The Imperfect

Regular verbs that take an expanded stem
Because of space limitations, I can’t list all the regular verbs that take an expanded
stem in the imperfect, so I give you the most common ones in Table 11-2, along with
their modified stems. These few verbs drop the -re of the infinitive, add -eve-, and
then add the regular endings of the imperfect of the second conjugation in -ere.
Verbs formed by adding a prefix to a basic verb, as in adding ri- to fare (to do, to
make) to get rifare (to redo, to remake), follow the pattern of the basic verb. For
example, add dis- to porre (to lay) to get disporre (to dispose). In the case of con-
durre, which is a verb with a prefix to begin with, you can change that prefix, using
tra-, for example, to get tradurre (to translate).

174
Part III: What Would You Do without Verbs and Tenses? 

Crafting the Imperfect Progressive
Like English, Italian has an imperfect progressive tense. You form the imperfect pro-
gressive by conjugating the regular verb stare (to stay) in the imperfect and then
adding the gerund of the main verb. For example, Io stavo leggendo (I was reading).
The gerund is invariable (it has only one form), so you don’t have to worry about
matching it to another word in the sentence. You form the gerund by adding -ando to
the stems of verbs ending in -are, and you add -endo to the stems of verbs ending in 
-ere or -ire. I talk about it more at length in Chapter 9, where you can also check the
gerunds of irregular verbs. Here’s an example of a verb in the imperfect progressive:
guardare (to look at, to watch)
io stavo guardando
noi stavamo guardando
tu stavi guardando
voi stavate guardando
lui/lei/Lei/esso/essa stava 
loro/Loro/essi/esse stavano 
guardando
guardando
Voi stavate guardando la partita di calcio. (You were watching the soccer game.)
In Italian you use the imperfect progressive in the same way you use it in English: to
emphasize what you were doing (or what was happening) at a given moment. If you
ask the question Che cosa stavano facendo? (What were they doing?), what you leave
unsaid is at that moment or at the time we’re talking about. And you can answer
Stavano guardando la TV (They were watching TV).
However, Italian is more flexible than English when it comes to the distinction
between a simple tense and its progressive form. So you can also say Che cosa face-
vano? (What were they doing?), and answer Guardavano la TV (They were watching
TV). You choose between the two versions not because you need to follow a rule but
because the progressive form may seem more appropriate in a specific instance.
In Italian, you use the progressive form to talk about emotional and mental states. For
example, Stavo pensando di licenziarmi (I was thinking of quitting that job). But you
don’t use it to talk about conditions, as in Indossava un vestito blu (She was wearing
a blue dress), or with the verb essere (to be), as in Era carino con te (He was being
nice to you).

When the Going Gets Tricky: Comparing 
the Imperfect and Present Perfect
In this section I give you guidelines about
 How to choose between the imperfect (or the imperfect progressive) and the
present perfect
• Imperfect/imperfect progressive: Guardavo/Stavo guardando la TV con i
miei amici. (I watched/I was watching TV with my friends.)
• Present perfect: Ho guardato la TV fino a mezzanotte. (I watched TV until
midnight.)
 What happens when you link sentences together using the present perfect in one
and the imperfect in the other, as in Guardavo [imperfect] la TV quando è man-
cata [present perfect] la luce (I was watching TV when the electricity went out); or
you want to emphasize that specific moment, as in Stavo guardando [imperfect
progressive] la TV quando è mancata [present perfect] la luce (I was watching
TV when the electricity went out).
Choosing one over the other: Imperfect 
or present perfect?
In English and Italian you employ the present perfect to talk about situations that began
in the past and are still affecting the present, as in Il grande direttore d’orchestra è
morto nella sua casa di famiglia (The great conductor died at his family’s home).
176
Part III: What Would You Do without Verbs and Tenses? 

But in other situations, Italian uses the imperfect or the present perfect, and the
English translation for both of the Italian tenses is the same. Compare the following
examples:
Mia figlia era una bambina vivace. (My daughter was a lively kid.)
Mia figlia è stata in Spagna l’estate scorsa. (My daughter was in Spain last summer.)
In the first sentence, the verb was needs to be in the imperfect in Italian because the
sentence conveys a condition lasting over time. In the second sentence, the trip to
Spain is an event that was concluded in the past. You have to get used to asking the
following questions to decide whether to use the imperfect or the present perfect:
 Am I talking about an event? If yes, use the present perfect.
 Am I talking about a situation, a condition, or something lasting? If yes, use the
imperfect.
Using different tenses in different sentences
Sometimes, you’ll find yourself in a situation where, when looking at a sentence in iso-
lation, you find it’s difficult to decide whether you’re talking about a condition that
lasted in the past or an event that happened and is over. If in English you have a sen-
tence such as My son was a quiet kid, what tense do you use in Italian? The present
perfect? Mio figlio è stato un bambino tranquillo? Or the imperfect? Mio figlio era
un bambino tranquillo? Neither of them is right or wrong. What tense you use
depends on the context, and the simplest context you can think of may be another
sentence.
Suppose that you’re talking about your son, who’s now 20 years old, and you’re look-
ing back to the time to when he was a kid. You have three possible situations; you can
think of
 Two situations that both lasted in the past and for which you use the imperfect:
Quando mio figlio era bambino, era molto tranquillo. (When my son was a kid,
he was very quiet.)
 A condition that lasted in the past as compared to an event (in this case, the
onset of adolescence) that changed that situation and for which you use the
present perfect: Mio figlio era un bambino tranquillo, ma con l’adolescenza è
diventato molto vivace. (My son was a quiet child, but with adolescence he
became very lively.)
 Two situations that have a beginning and an end, no matter the length of time
they cover, and for which you use the present perfect: Mio figlio è stato un bam-
bino tranquillo fino ai quattordici anni, ma poi è diventato molto vivace. (My
son was a quiet kid until the age of 14; afterwards he became very lively.)
As the examples show, you need to appreciate the nuances in order to make the best
decision. People will understand you if you use the wrong tense in situations such as
the one illustrated in this example, but if you want to write well, you need to develop
sensitivity to those nuances.

Conveying Two Past Actions in Sequence:
The Past Perfect
In Italian, the past perfect is called trapassato prossimo. You need this tense when
two actions occurred in the past and one occurred before the other. In Italian, you
also use this tense in situations where English uses the simple past, even though it’s
correct to use the past perfect in English too, as in Le ho chiesto cos’aveva fatto
(I asked her what she had done/I asked her what she did).
You use the past perfect
 When you’re talking about an event that happened in the past before the situa-
tion you’re describing. You convey the situation with the imperfect and the event
with the past perfect.
Non sapevo [situation lasting over time] che tu gli avevi telefonato
[event]. (I didn’t know you had already called him.)
 When you’re describing a situation that lasted over time before an event you’re
talking about. You convey the event with the present perfect and the situation
with the past perfect.
Quando siamo usciti [event], aveva smesso di piovere [situation lasting
over time]. (By the time we went out, it had stopped raining.)
You form the past perfect by conjugating the auxiliary verb essere or avere in the
imperfect. Then you add the past participle of the main verb, such as detto (said) or

andato (gone), to get avevo detto (I had said) or ero andato (I had gone). Head to

Complete the following sentences by adding the past perfect in the person suggested
in parentheses. Choose the appropriate auxiliary, and pay attention to the ending of
the past participle.

Practicing Your Navigation Among

Chapter 11: When Things Lasted (In the Past): The Imperfect

Think of a hypothetical vacation you spent at the beach when you were 7 years old.
Some things you did began and ended while you were on vacation — you learned how
to swim, for example — others occurred over a stretch of time — the vacation itself,
for example, or your being 7 years old, which covered, of course, an entire year of
your life. When you translate the sentences listed below, decide when it’s appropriate
to use the imperfect or the present perfect. You may also need the past perfect when
two events happened both at that time, but one preceded the other.
Translate the following sentences from English into Italian using the appropriate past
tense.
Q. This photograph represents a place similar to one I used to know.
A. Questa fotografia rappresenta un posto simile a un posto che io conoscevo.
26. As a child, I used to go to the seashore every year.
27. I used to go on vacation with my parents and my siblings.
28. I learned to swim when I was 7.
29. My father taught me to swim.
30. I used to build sandcastles.
31. I had a lot of friends at the beach.
32. At the beach, we always played bocce on the sand.
33. My mother had bought me a mask and fins so I could watch the fish under water.
34. I never saw again the friends I had met at the beach.
The following passage is the biography of an Italian writer, Lalla Romano, written
mostly in the present tense. Answer the questions that follow in one of the three past
tenses. Her birth, dates of publications, and so forth are best conveyed in the
preterit. When an activity covers a chunk of time or an emotional or existential state,
you should talk about it in the imperfect. And when it comes to assessing her role in
Italian literature, you should use the present perfect (Chapter 10).

Chapter 12
The Future Tense
In This Chapter
 Conjugating the future of regular and irregular verbs
 Forming and using the future perfect
T
his is the chapter of the future. The future is a tense you employ to talk about an
event that hasn’t yet taken place or isn’t yet concluded. It has a simple form (futuro
semplice): Andrò (I will go); and a compound form called the futuro anterione (future
perfect): Sarò andato (I will have gone). You use the future perfect when a future
event precedes another future event: Quando tornerai a casa, Ugo sarà già partito
(By the time you come home, Ugo will have left). Here’s when you use the future tense:
 To describe events happening in the future (usually a far or unspecified future):
Un giorno sarò ricco e famoso. (One day I will be rich and famous.)
 To express the intention to do something in the future: Penso che andrò in
California il prossimo anno. (I think I’ll go to California next year.)
 To express a possibility or probability: Hanno bussato alla porta, sarà l’UPS che
consegna il pacco. (Someone knocked on the door; it may be UPS delivering the
package.)
 When the first verb of a sentence (either a subordinate or main clause) is in the
future: Quando finirai il liceo, andrai all’università. (When you finish high
school, you’ll go to college.)
In general, the future is used when talking about unspecified events in time or events
that are likely to occur in a distant future. When describing events happening in a
near future, use the present tense. Note that in these cases, English often uses the
future or the present progressive tense: Che fai stasera? (What are you doing
tonight?); Io esco con Simona. (I’m going out with Simona.)
Knowing When to Use the Present 
to Talk about the Future
All languages have rules, and even basic conjugations can be a challenge at first. Not
only do Italian verb forms vary more than they do in English, but Italian also takes a
few more liberties in using the present tense to describe the future. 

Talk about the future with the present in the following cases:
 To mention an event that will happen soon, as in La vedo domenica (I’ll see her
on Sunday/I’m seeing her on Sunday).
 To announce a decision that’s more or less close in time. For example,
Quest’estate vado alle Maldive! (This coming summer I’m going to the Maldives!).
 To refer to an event that’s part of a timetable. For instance, Il semestre autun-
nale incomincia il 10 ottobre (The fall term begins on October 10).
 To give instructions, such as Quando arrivi a Londra, va’ direttamente alla
Stazione Vittoria (When you get to London, go straight to Victoria Station).
Forming the Future Tense
The future is formed by adding the corresponding endings to the infinitive of the verb
minus the final -e. In -are verbs, the a of the infinitive changes to e. Read on for conju-
gations of regular and irregular verbs in the future tense.
Many verbs, such as vivere (to live), are preceded by a prefix, such as sopra- in
sopravvivere (to survive). Both regular and irregular verbs formed with prefixes
behave like the basic verb without the prefix. Conjugate the verb with the prefix as
you’d conjugate the simple verb:
I miei nonni vivranno a lungo. (My grandparents will live a long time).
Queste piante sopravvivranno al freddo. (The plants will survive the cold.)
Regular verbs
The future tense in Italian is a thing of beauty: For regular verbs, the conjugation of
both -are and -ere verbs (no matter where the accent is) is exactly the same. And -ire
verbs follow the same pattern, with an i in place of the e at the beginning of the
ending. In Table 12-1, I list the endings for the three conjugations, followed by a
sample conjugation table. Remember that all verbs — regular and irregular — place
the accent on the same vowels.
Table 12-1
Endings for Regular Verbs in the Future Tense

Ending for -are/-ere Verbs
Ending for -ire Verbs

-erò
-irò
tu
-erai
-irai

guardare (to look at)
io guarderò
noi guarderemo
tu guarderai
voi guarderete
lui/lei/Lei/esso/essa guarderà
loro/Loro/essi/esse guarderanno
Massimo non mi guarderà mai! (Massimo will never look at me!)
The verb spengere/spegnere (to turn off, to extinguish) forms the simple future regu-
larly but uses only the stem spegn-. This is because the infinitive has two forms —
spengere and spegnere — whose meanings don’t change. But remember: You hear
only spengere in Tuscany, whereas the rest of Italy uses spegnere.
Verbs that end in -ciare and -giare, such as lanciare (to throw, to launch) and man-
giare (to eat), drop the i before adding endings because the -e of the future ending 
preserves the soft sound of the infinitive. Verbs that end in -care and -gare, such as
cercare (to look for) and pagare (to pay), take ch and gh before the endings to pre-
serve the hard sound of the infinitive.
Add the verb to the following sentences, choosing among the options in parentheses.
Q. (Pagheremo/Prenderanno/Servirete) noi il conto.
A. Pagheremo noi il conto. (We will pay for the bill.)
1. Gianni e Piero (balleranno/correranno/visiteranno) la Maratona di New York.
2. Io e i miei fratelli (prenderai/serviranno/daremo) una grande festa.
3. “Marco, (lascerò/partirai/salirai) per Mosca fra un mese?”
4. “Signora, (cambierà/cancelleranno/ricorderò) il suo numero di telefono?”
5. “Signori, (passerà/uscirete/entrerai) dalla porta numero 4.”
6. Tu e i tuoi colleghi (finirete/annulleranno/darete) le dimissioni?
Irregular verbs
As usual, some verbs don’t follow the rules of the future tense. They conjugate start-
ing from different future stems, depending on the endings of the infinitives (-are, -ere,
-ire) and on where in the verb the stress falls. Read on for info on these irregular
verbs.
Auxiliaries and modal auxiliaries
The verb essere (to be) is irregular all around when it comes to conjugation, meaning
that the conjugated forms don’t look anything like the infinitive form. Avere (to have)
is much less irregular; to use avere in the future tense, you just drop the -ere ending.
The following tables show their conjugations.
187
Chapter 12: The Future Tense

essere (to be)
io sarò
noi saremo
tu sarai
voi sarete
lui/lei/Lei/esso/essa sarà
loro/Loro/essi/esse saranno
Dove sarai tra vent’anni? (Where will you be in twenty years?)
avere (to have)
io avrò

tu avrai
voi avrete
lui/lei/Lei/esso/essa avrà
loro/Loro/essi/esse avranno
Guarda quei ragazzi: avranno vent’anni al massimo. (Look at those guys: They can’t be older than 20.)
In conjugating the future tense, the modal auxiliaries dovere (must, shall), potere
(can, may), and sapere (to know how to) drop the -ere from the infinitive and add an r
plus the future endings. Volere (will, to want to) conjugates similarly but also changes
the l of the stem to r. The following tables show the conjugations of these verbs in the
future.
dovere (must, shall)
io dovrò
noi dovremo
tu dovrai
voi dovrete
lui/lei/Lei/esso/essa dovrà
loro/Loro/essi/esse dovranno
Dovrò ridare questo esame. (I’ll have to take this exam again.)

Irregular verbs of the first conjugation: -are
Some two-syllable verbs ending in -are keep the a of the infinitive. These verbs are
dare (to give), fare (to do), and stare (to stay). They drop the e of their endings. The
following are their conjugations.
andare (to go)
io andrò
noi andremo

12. Stai tranquillo, domani (starà/farà/saremo) bello.
13. “Tu e tua moglie (farete/saremo/andrete) in vacanza in Messico?”
Irregular verbs of the second conjugation: -ere
To form the future tense, irregular -ere verbs follow one of four patterns:
 Drop the -ere and add r plus the ending. Common verbs in this category include
cadere (to fall), accadere (to happen), godere (to enjoy), and vedere (to see).
 Drop the -ere and replace the m, n, or l of the stem with an r, as in rimanere
(to remain), tenere (to keep), and valere (to be worth).
 Double the consonant r, as in bere (to drink).
 Add the suffix without the e to the verbs that have a double r in the stem, as in
condurre (to lead), trarre (to pull), and porre (to put).
Following are the future conjugation tables for cadere, rimanere, bere, and 
condurre.
cadere (to fall)
io cadrò
noi cadremo
tu cadrai
voi cadrete
lui/lei/Lei/esso/essa cadrà
loro/Loro/essi/esse cadranno
Se sarai prudente, non cadrai. (If you’re cautious, you won’t fall.)

(Don’t worry, they’ll take us to our destination.)
Irregular verbs of the third conjugation: -ire
Only one of the -ire verbs is irregular and important to know: Venire drops the -ire of
the ending and changes the n of the stem to a rr plus the ending.
venire (to come)
io verrò
noi verremo
tu verrai
voi verrete
lui/lei/Lei/esso/essa verrà
loro/Loro/essi/esse verranno
Verrai alla mia festa di compleanno? (Will you come to my birthday party?)

Forming the Future Perfect Tense
The future perfect is a compound tense that describes a future event happening
before another future event. You form it by adding the simple future of the auxiliary
verb essere (to be) or avere (to have) to the past participle of the verb. (Earlier in this
chapter, in the “Irregular verbs” section, I explain how to form the future tense of
essere and avere. Chapter 10 tells you which auxiliary to choose, how to form the
past participle, and how to coordinate the past participle with subjects and objects.)
Here are mangiare (to eat), which uses avere, and tornare (to return, to go back),
which uses essere, in the future perfect.
mangiare (to eat)
io avrò mangiato
noi avremo mangiato
tu avrai mangiato
voi avrete mangiato
lui/lei/Lei/esso/essa avrà 
loro/Loro/essi/esse 
mangiato
avranno mangiato
Il gatto avrà mangiato la bistecca. (The cat will have eaten the steak.)
tornare (to return, to go back)
io sarò tornato/tornata
noi saremo tornati/tornate
tu sarai tornato/tornata
voi sarete tornati/tornate
lui/lei/Lei/esso/essa sarà 
loro/Loro/essi/esse saranno 
tornato/tornata
tornati/tornate
Sarà tornato in ufficio. (He’ll have gone back to work.)
193
Chapter 12: The Future Tense

To understand how to use the future perfect, compare the verb tenses in the follow-
ing example sentences:
 Present: Quando arriva in ufficio, gli telefono. (When I call him, he arrives at the
office.)
 Future: Quando arriverà in ufficio, gli telefonerò. (When I call him, he’ll arrive at
the office.)
 Future perfect: Quando, sarà arrivato in ufficio, gli telefonerò. (When I call him,
he’ll have already arrived at the office.)
Using the clues in parentheses, decide whether to use the present, the future, or the
future perfect to complete the following sentences. Because Italian uses the present
tense to describe events that take place in the near future, both the simple future
tense and the present may be correct in some cases.
Q. Guarda che pozzanghere! _________________ tutta la notte. (piovere)
A. Guarda che pozzanghere! Avrà/Sarà piovuto tutta la notte.

31. Ha detto con tono deciso: “_________________ a lavorare in Australia tra due anni!”

36. Io vi _________________ al mio ritorno dalla Cina. (vedere)
37. “Chi ha suonato alla porta?” “_________________ la nostra vicina di casa.” (essere)

Adding Nuances to 
Moods and Tenses

In this part . . .
I
n Part IV, I discuss how Italian, like any language, is a
public good shared with others. In order to communi-
cate, you need words to ask questions, and you need to
know how to construct answers. You also use different
constructions to say that you’re acting in the world, or
that you’re the object of your own actions, or that you’re
experiencing something being done to you.

Chapter 13
The Imperative
In This Chapter
 Forming the informal and formal imperative of regular and irregular verbs
 Issuing affirmative and negative commands
 Adding pronouns to commands
W
ith the imperative, you encounter one more mood — different from the indica-
tive, the subjunctive, the conditional, and so on. The imperative is the mood
of commands and exhortations, like Abbi fiducia! (Have faith!) or the less-inspiring
Non tirare la coda al gatto! (Don’t pull the cat’s tail!).
The imperative always implies a blunt command and is mainly used in conversation.
To give generic orders, or in signs, advertisements, recipes, and instructions, Italian
uses the infinitive.
Sonia, mescola la farina! (Sonia, mix the flour!) (Imperative)
La ricetta dice: “Mescolare la farina e aggiungere tre uova”. (The recipe says:
“Mix the flour and add three eggs.”) (Infinitive)
A sentence such as Andiamo! È tardi! (Let’s go! It’s late!) lies between order and
exhortation. You use the imperative when addressing a person directly, as in Passi
prima Lei, Signora! (Please, you go first, Madam!); or Prendano l’ascensore sulla
destra! (Take the elevator on the right!). And the imperative is employed mostly 
(but not exclusively) in the second-person singular and plural.
The future tense of the imperative is identical to the simple future of the indicative.
All that distinguishes the two is the placement after the verb of the person to whom
you issue a command (if expressed), the exclamation mark, and, in speech, the tone
of voice. For example, Andrete voi in banca a spiegare perché mancano i soldi!
(You’ll be the ones who go to the bank and explain why the money isn’t there!).
In this chapter, you find out how to form the present and future imperative and how
to issue affirmative and negative commands.

The Imperative Form of Regular Verbs
When you form an imperative in Italian, you have a sort of reverse rule for the tu and
Lei forms — the -are conjugations are a flip of the -ere and -ire conjugations. For
example, the imperative of the verb cantare (to sing) is Canta! (informal) and Canti!
(formal). In contrast, the imperative forms of dormire (to sleep), for example, are
Dormi! (informal) and Dorma! (formal).
Informal usage
The imperative mood is used to give orders, advice, and exhortations. The informal
imperative form addresses people with whom you’re familiar, or when the degree of
formality is low (with classmates, children, and co-workers, for example). The infor-
mal imperative forms of tu, noi, and voi are identical to the corresponding present
tense forms with one exception: In the tu form of -are verbs, the -i becomes -a. Please
note that the imperative form of noi corresponds to the English Let’s. For example,
Andiamo a Parigi! (Let’s go to Paris!).
Table 13-1 shows the different conjugations for informal usage.
Table 13-1
Informal Imperatives of Regular Verbs
Verb
Informal Singular
Informal Plural
guardare (to look)
(tu) guarda! ([you] look!)
(noi) guardiamo! ([we] look!); 
(voi) guardate! ([you] look!)
prendere (to take)
(tu) prendi! ([you] take!)
(noi) prendiamo! ([we] take!); 
(voi) prendete! ([you] take!)
dormire (to sleep)
(tu) dormi! ([you] sleep!)
(noi) dormiamo! ([we] sleep!); 
(voi) dormite! ([you] sleep!)
finire (to finish)
(tu) finisci! ([you] finish!)
(noi) finiamo! ([we] finish!); 
(voi) finite! ([you] finish!)
Formal usage
The formal imperative is used less frequently than the informal command form. You
go the formal route as a form of respect in situations where a certain degree of formal-
ity is required, such as when addressing your own boss, talking to older people, or
talking to people you don’t know or whom you’ve just met.
The best way to construct a formal imperative is to start from the io form of the pres-
ent tense because some verbs base their regular formal imperative on an irregular
form of the present. These verbs, whose stem changes in the present tense form, are
as follows:
200
Part IV: Adding Nuances to Moods and Tenses 

You create the formal lei and loro imperative by dropping the final -o from the io form
of the present tense and adding -i/-ino to the stem of -are verbs, and -a/-ano to the
stem of -ere and -ire verbs. Table 13-2 shows some examples.
Although you may hear the formal imperative of Loro in very upscale restaurants and
hotels, this form is often replaced in everyday spoken Italian by the informal impera-
tive form of voi, as in Signore e signori, ascoltate con attenzione! (Ladies and gentle-
men, listen carefully!).
Table 13-2

prendere (to take)

dormire (to sleep)
(tu) dorma! ([you] sleep!)
(voi) dormano! ([you] sleep!)
finire (to finish)
(tu) finisca! ([you] finish!)
(voi) finiscano! ([you] finish!)
The Imperative Form of Irregular Verbs
Some Italian verbs have an irregular conjugation in the imperative mood. This section
walks you through the conjugations of these verbs.
Verbs that are irregular in 
the informal imperative
The verbs andare (to go), dare (to give), fare (to do, to make), and stare (to stay) have
both regular and irregular tu informal imperatives: va’/vai, fa’/fai, da’/dai, and sta’/stai.
When speaking, their irregular imperatives are more common than their regular forms.
Consider this example: Sta’ zitto e fa’ quel che dico! (Be quiet and do as I say!).
The verb dire (to say) is irregular only in the tu form, as in Di’ la verità! (Tell the truth!).
201
Chapter 13: The Imperative
 andare (to go)
 apparire (to appear)
 bere (to drink)
 cogliere (to pick)
 dire (to say)
 fare (to do, to make)
 porre (to put)
 rimanere (to remain)
 salire (to climb)
 scegliere (to choose)
 sedere (to sit)
 tradurre (to translate)
 trarre (to draw, to pull)
 udire (to hear)
 uscire (to go out)
 venire (to come)

Verbs that are irregular in 
the formal imperative
The verbs avere (to have), essere (to be), sapere (to know how to), dare (to give), and
stare (to stay) are irregular in the formal imperative. The modal auxiliaries dovere
(must, shall) and potere (can, may) don’t have the imperative due to their meaning.
But volere (will, to want) and sapere (to know how to) do, even though you may not
use them often. I break down the conjugations of some of the auxiliaries and modal
auxiliaries in the following tables.
avere (to have)
noi abbiamo (present indicative)
tu abbi
voi abbiate (present subjunctive)
lui/lei/Lei/esso abbia
loro/Loro/essi/esse abbiano
(present subjunctive)
(present subjunctive)
Abbi pazienza con lei. (Have patience with her.)
essere (to be)
noi siamo (present indicative)
tu sii
voi siate (present subjunctive)
lui/lei/Lei/esso sia
loro/Loro/essi/esse siano
(present subjunctive)
(present subjunctive)
Sii gentile con lei. (Be nice to her.)
sapere (to know how to)
noi sappiamo (present indicative)
tu sappi
voi sappiate (present subjunctive)
lui/lei/Lei/esso sappia
loro/Loro/essi/esse sappiano
(present subjunctive)
(present subjunctive)
Sappi che io non vengo. (Know that I won’t come.)

Part IV: Adding Nuances to Moods and Tenses 

Use the clues in parentheses to fill in the blanks with the appropriate verbs in the
present imperative.
Q. _________________ a spasso il cane! (tu, portare)
A. Porta a spasso il cane! (Walk the dog!)
1. _________________ il mio consiglio, Signora! (ascoltare)
2. _________________ con tuo fratello, Mara! (giocare)
3. _________________ il vostro nome e cognome in stampatello, Signori! (voi, scrivere)
4. _________________ a me, è meglio rimandare la partenza! (loro, credere)
5. _________________ la passeggiata, anche se non siamo stanchi! (noi, finire)
6. _________________ avanti, Signore e Signori! (loro, venire)
Negative Commands
You form the negative imperative for tu using the infinitive form of the verb preceded
by Non (Don’t). For example, Non spendere troppo! (Don’t spend too much!). The
forms of noi and voi imperatives are formed by using their affirmative imperative pre-
ceded by Non. For example, Non parlate così in fretta! (Don’t speak so fast!). You
craft the negative form of the formal imperative by adding Non to the formal impera-
tive, as in Non usi quel telefono, non funziona (Don’t use that phone, it doesn’t work).
The negative informal imperatives of the irregular verbs follow the rules of the regular
imperatives.
The only difference between a verb’s conjugations in affirmative and negative com-
mands is that in negative commands you use the infinitive preceded by the particle
non in the second-person singular. For example, Non tornare tardi! (Don’t come back
late!). Following are some more examples:
 essere: Non essere! (Don’t be!)
 fare: Non lo fare! (Don’t do it!)
 andare: Non andare! (Don’t go!)
 uscire: Non uscire! (Don’t go out!)
 dire: Non lo dire! (Don’t say it!)
 bere: Non bere! (Don’t drink!)
Each of the following questions contains a reproduced road sign. Use the clues to tell
your driver what he or she should or shouldn’t do, depending on the sign. Write short
commands in the second-person singular and plural.

Part IV: Adding Nuances to Moods and Tenses 

Adding Pronouns to Commands
When you issue a command, emphasis falls on the verb, which usually comes at the
beginning of the sentence, as in Andate a casa! (Go home!).
When the pronoun follows the imperative
Sometimes a pronoun follows the imperative, like the English command Listen to me.
In this case, the pronoun is attached to the informal imperative form of the verb, as in
Ascoltami bene prima di parlare (Listen to me carefully before speaking). Here are the
unstressed pronouns you can attach to the imperative:
 Direct object pronouns: mi (me), ti (you), lo/la (him/her), ci (us), vi (you); also
loro (them) placed after the verb but not attached to it
Aiutala! (Help her!)
 Indirect object pronouns: mi (to/for me), ti (to/for you), gli/le (to/for him/her), ci
(to/for us), vi (to/for you), gli (to/for him); also loro (to/for them) placed after the
verb
Compriamogli un paio di guanti. (Let’s buy him a pair of gloves.)
 Ci (here, there, about this/that) and ne (about him/her/them, of this/that)
Andateci! (Go there!)
Parlatene! (Talk about that!)
 Double pronouns: me lo (that to me), te le (those to her), glielo (it/that to
him/her), gliene (about that to him), ce ne (about that to us)
Diteglielo. (Tell it to him/her.)
Parlarmene. (Tell me everything about it.)
When using a reflexive verb or a direct or indirect object pronoun, the pronoun fol-
lows and is attached to the imperative. For example: Alzati e lavati! (Get up and wash
yourself!)
In negative tu commands, the pronoun may precede or follow the infinitive. When
attached to the infinitive, the infinitive drops the final -e before the pronoun, as in
Non preoccuparti; Non ti preoccupare (Don’t worry).
Refer to Table 13-3 for the use of reflexive pronouns with the imperative mood. Note
that the negative informal imperatives of the irregular verbs listed in Table 13-3 follow
the rules of the regular imperatives.
205

herself! Don’t wash yourself! (FS)
Laviamoci! Let’s wash ourselves!
Non laviamoci!, Let’s not wash ourselves!
Non ci laviamo!
Lavatevi!
Wash yourselves!
Non lavatevi!,
Don’t wash yourselves!
Non vi lavate!
Si lavino!
Let them wash themselves! Non si lavino!
Let them not wash themselves! 
Wash yourselves! (FP)
Don’t wash yourselves! (FP)
When the pronoun precedes the imperative
When using a formal imperative, the pronoun precedes the imperative and the verb,
as in Mi ascolti bene prima di parlare (Listen to me carefully before speaking).
When attaching a pronoun to the irregular tu imperative forms of andare, dare, fare,
stare, and dire (refer to the earlier section “The Imperative Form of Irregular Verbs”
for more on this), the apostrophe disappears and the first consonant of the pronoun 
doubles. For example, Dimmi che verrai! (Tell me that you’ll come!).
An exception to this rule is the indirect object pronoun gli. When attaching it to the
imperative, the first consonant g doesn’t double after the imperative. For example,
Dagli il libro (Give him the book).
If you issue a negative command in the second-person singular, which uses the infini-
tive, you drop the final -e of the verb. You can attach the pronoun to the verb or
insert the unstressed pronoun between the particle non (not) and the verb. Here are
examples of both options:
Non telefonargli! (Don’t call him on the phone!)
Non gli telefonare! (Don’t call him on the phone!)
When issuing a negative command expressed in the formal imperative, the pronoun is
always placed between Non and the imperative, as in Non si preoccupi, signora
(Don’t worry, Madam).
Chapter 17 discusses reflexive verbs, such as addormentarsi (to fall asleep) and
lavarsi (to wash oneself), which employ reflexive pronouns placed before the verb. In
the imperative of these verbs, the same rules of the pronouns apply. For example,
Alzati (Get up); Pettinatevi bene (Comb your hair well).

Forming Conditional and 
Subjunctive Verbs
In This Chapter
 Working with the present and the past conditional
 Putting the present subjunctive to use
 Forming the imperfect subjunctive
 Understanding the present perfect and the past perfect subjunctive
T
he conditional and the subjunctive are two moods; they’re different from the
indicative mood and from one another. Mood represents the speaker’s attitude
about whether something is considered factual. Here are explanations of each mood:
 The indicative is the mood of assertions and descriptions, where you’re stating
straightforward facts. For example, when you say Parlo spagnolo (I speak
Spanish), you’re using the indicative mood.
 The conditional is the mood of hypothetical situations and of events dependent
on something else happening. In English, you’re using the conditional mood
when you use would plus an infinitive, as in this sentence: Vorrei studiare medi-
cina (I’d like to study medicine).
 The subjunctive is the mood of possibility, uncertainty, and of hypotheses when
used in if . . . then statements with the conditional. In Italian, a subjunctive state-
ment you may make is Accetteri quel lavoro se offrissero uno stipendio
migliore (I’d accept that job if they offered a better salary).
In this chapter, I show you how to form the present and past conditional and the pres-
ent, imperfect, present perfect, and past perfect subjunctive. Also in this chapter, I
give you the opportunity to practice conjugations and discover how to form condi-
tionals and subjunctives. Chapter 15 focuses on putting these moods into practice,
particularly when using the if . . . then statements.
Shaping Verbs into the Present Conditional
The present conditional is a simple tense that you form by adding suffixes to the stem
of the verb, depending on the verb’s ending. You use it when you want to express
events occurring under certain circumstances or conditions. It’s also used to add
politeness to offers, advice, and requests that would otherwise sound too blunt. Read
on for the conjugations.

Regular verbs
The conjugations for regular verbs in the present conditional mood have one set of
endings attached to the future stem of the verb. The future stem of regular verbs is
the infinitive of the verb minus the final -e; also, in -are verbs, the a of the infinitive
changes to e (see Chapter 12 for more on the future). The present conditional endings
are the same for the three conjugations (-are, -ere, and -ire verbs). See Table 14-1.
Table 14-1
Endings for Regular Verbs in the Present Conditional
Person
Conditional Endings
io
-ei
tu
-esti
lui/lei/Lei/esso/essa
-ebbe
noi
-emmo
voi
-este
loro/Loro/essi/esse
-ebbero
Both regular and irregular verbs formed with prefixes behave like the basic verb. For
example, if you add the prefix stra- to vincere (to win) to create stravincere (to win by
a great margin), you conjugate these two verbs in the same way:
Con molta fortuna vincerei un milione di dollari alla lotteria. (With a lot of luck,
I would win one million dollars and the lottery.)
Con un buon allenatore stravincerebbe. (With a good coach, he would win by a
great margin.)
The following table shows you how to conjugate guardare (to look at).
guardare (to look at)
io guarderei
noi guarderemmo

As you see for the various conjugations throughout this book, verbs that end in -ciare
and -giare, such as lanciare (to launch, to throw) and mangiare (to eat), drop the i
before the endings because the -e of the -are, -ere, and -ire preserves the soft sound.
Verbs that end in -care and -gare, such as cercare (to look for) and pagare (to pay),
take ch and gh before the endings to preserve the hard sound of the infinitive.

Irregular verbs (Well, sort of)
All verbs that have an irregular future stem use the same stem for the conditional. So
though it seems that the conditional has irregular verbs, the situation is sort of mis-
leading; the future has the irregular conjugations, and the conditional is built on the
future tense. Technically, the conditional does follow a regular pattern — you form it
by adding the appropriate endings to the future stems of the verb. Because I cover
the future tense at length in Chapter 12, I provide conjugations for only the auxiliaries
and the modal auxiliaries here; to find out how to form the conditional tense of all
other irregular verbs in the future tense, consult Chapter 12 and apply the conjuga-
tion pattern for the conditional, which I explain in the preceding section.
You can use essere (to be) and avere (to have) by themselves or as auxiliaries in com-
pound tenses (see Chapters 9 and 10 for details). In the present conditional mood, the
stem for essere is sar-. For avere, you drop both e’s from the infinitive to get avr-.
The following tables show the conjugations for both essere and avere.
essere (to be)
io sarei
noi saremmo
tu saresti
voi sareste
lui/lei/Lei/esso/essa sarebbe
loro/Loro/essi/esse sarebbero
Sarei felice di conoscerlo. (I would be happy to meet him.)
avere (to have)
io avrei
noi avremmo
tu avresti
voi avreste
lui/lei/Lei/esso/essa avrebbe
loro/Loro/essi/esse avrebbero
Non avrebbe della moneta? (Would you happen to have change?)
People often use the conditional of the modal auxiliaries dovere (must, shall), potere
(can, may), volere (to want to), and sapere (to know how to) to soften the impact of
requests and demands. Volere uses the stem vorr-.
dovere (must, shall)
io dovrei

tu dovresti

loro/Loro/essi/esse dovrebbero
Perché dovremmo pagare noi? (Why should we have to pay?)

It’s Over Now! Forming the Past Conditional
Although the present conditional describes an option that’s still possible, the past
conditional expresses the idea that that option is no longer likely to happen; the past
conditional also describes an action that’s not possible in the future, either.
The past conditional is a compound tense that’s made of the present conditional of
the auxiliaries essere (to be) and avere (to have) (see the preceding section) along
with the past participle of the main verb. The auxiliary you decide on depends on
which main verb you’re using. (Chapter 10 shows you how to decide which auxiliary
verb to use as well as how to form the past participle and coordinate it with subjects
and objects.)
For example, in the following sentence, you form the past conditional mood by using
the auxiliary essere and the past participle of venire (to go), which is venuto:
Sarei venuto al cinema con te, ma ero troppo stanco. (I would’ve gone to the
movies with you, but I was too tired.)
Here are two tables of the past conditional of leggere (to read), which takes the auxil-
iary avere, and of andare (to go), which takes the auxiliary essere.
leggere (to read)
io avrei letto
noi avremmo letto
tu avresti letto
voi avreste letto
lui/lei/Lei/esso/essa avrebbe letto
loro/Loro avrebbero letto
Avrei letto il giornale, ma l’hai buttato via. (I would’ve read the 
newspaper, but you tossed it.)
andare (to go)
io sarei andato/andata
noi saremmo andati/andate
tu saresti andato/andata
voi sareste andati/andate
lui/lei/Lei/esso/essa sarebbe 
loro/Loro sarebbero 
andato/andata
andati/andate
I ragazzi non sarebbero mai andati alla festa senza di te. 
(The boys would’ve never gone to the party without you.)

Chapter 14: Forming Conditional and Subjunctive Verbs

Putting Verbs in the Present Subjunctive
The subjunctive mood expresses doubt, possibility, uncertainty, or personal opinions
of the subject, as opposed to plain facts, which are expressed by the indicative. The
subjunctive can also express emotion, desire, or suggestions. It’s generally preceded
by a main clause and introduced by the conjunction che (that). In this section, you
discover the present subjunctive, a simple tense formed by adding suffixes to the
stem of the verb, depending on the verb’s conjugation type.
Regular verbs
You form the present subjunctive by adding the corresponding suffixes to the stem of
the verb. The stem is simply the infinitive minus the -are, -ere, or -ire ending. I list the
subjunctive suffixes Table 14-2.
Table 14-2

noi
-iamo

voi 
-iate

loro/Loro
-ino
-ano
Note that the first-person singular and third-person plural persons of the present sub-
junctive correspond to the conjugation of the formal imperative mood (see Chapter 13).
Check it out:
 Formal imperative: Signorina Rutelli, venga avanti! (Miss, come on in!)
 Present subjunctive: Penso che la signorina Rutelli venga da Roma. (I think that
Ms. Rutelli is from Rome.)
Also, verbs ending in -ire that insert -isc- between the stem and the verb endings 
in the present indicative, such as finire (to finish), follow the same rule in the 
subjunctive:
Immagino che il film finisca bene. (I imagine that the film has a happy ending.)
The following table shows you how to conjugate sentire (to hear).

sentire (to hear)

voi sentiate
lui/lei/Lei/esso senta
loro/Loro/essi/esse sentano
È possibile che non sentano perché sono a un concerto. (It’s 
possible that they can’t hear because they’re at a concert.)
As usual, verbs ending in -care and -gare add an h before endings beginning with i.
They do so in order to retain the hard sound of the c or g.
Irregular verbs
When conjugating irregular verbs in the present subjunctive, you usually modify the
stem of the infinitive and apply the same suffixes as you do for regular verbs (refer to
Table 14-2 for the suffixes to use). Some verbs use a particular modified stem in all six
persons, but others use the regular stem (or another modified stem) in the first- and
second-person plural. Table 14-3 shows how the stems change for the most common
irregular verbs. (Consult Chapter 9 for a more complete list of verbs that modify their
stems.)
In the present subjunctive, when a verb has an unaccented i in its stem, you drop it if
the verb also has an i in the suffix. For example, incominciare (to begin), whose stem
is usually incominci-, conjugates as loro incomincino; fare (to make, to do), whose
stem is usually facci-, conjugates as noi facciamo. However, if the i in the stem is
accented, keep it; for instance, sciare (to ski), whose stem is sci-, conjugates as loro
sciino.

Creating the Imperfect Subjunctive
The imperfect subjunctive is a simple tense that you form by adding suffixes to the
stem of the verb. Like the present subjunctive, the imperfect subjunctive expresses
doubt, possibility, uncertainty, personal opinions, emotion, desire, or suggestions.
You use it instead of the present subjunctive when your sentence meets the following
conditions:
 The verb in the main clause is in a past tense or in the present conditional.
 The action in the subordinate clause occurred simultaneously or after the action
in the main clause.
Regular verbs
The imperfect subjunctive uses the same stem as the imperfect indicative, and it adds
the same subjunctive endings to the verbs of all conjugations. In other words, it drops
the -re from the infinitive and adds the endings in Table 14-4.

Part IV: Adding Nuances to Moods and Tenses 

Constructing the Subjunctive Mood of the
Present Perfect and Past Perfect
The present perfect subjunctive and the past perfect subjunctive are compound tenses.
To put the present perfect and past perfect tenses in the subjunctive mood, you use a
subjunctive form of the auxiliary essere or avere along with the past participle of the
main verb. (For rules about forming the past participle, choosing between essere and
avere, and coordinating subjects and past participles, consult Chapter 10.)
The present perfect corresponds to the simple past in English. You use the present
perfect subjunctive to describe a past action when the verb in the main clause is in
the present tense and requires a subjunctive. Form the subjunctive mood of this
tense with
 The present subjunctive of the auxiliary essere or avere
 The past participle of the main verb
The past perfect subjunctive corresponds to the present perfect and preterit of the
indicative. It’s used whenever one of these tenses is in the indicative mood. Use the
past perfect subjunctive in a subordinate clause when the verb in the main clause is
in any form of past tense or in the conditional and when the action in the subordinate
clause occurred before the action in the main clause. The past perfect subjunctive is
formed with
 The imperfect subjunctive of the auxiliaries essere and avere
 The past participle of the main verb
Compare these examples of the present perfect and past perfect in the subjunctive:
 Present perfect subjunctive: Credo che Luisa gli abbia parlato. (I believe Luisa
spoke to him.)
Past perfect subjunctive: Speravo che Luisa gli avesse parlato. (I hoped Luisa
had spoken to him.)
 Present perfect subjunctive: Temo che siano andati via. (I’m afraid they left.)
Past perfect subjunctive: Pensavo che fossero andati via. (I thought they had
left.)
The following verbal forms are in the present subjunctive and the imperfect subjunc-
tive. Turn the former into the present perfect subjunctive and the latter into the past
perfect subjunctive.

The Conditional and the 
Subjunctive in Action

 Forming if . . . then clauses
T
his chapter tells you how you can use the conditional and the subjunctive in vari-
ous settings. If you happened to open this book to this page and have never
encountered the conditional, the subjunctive, or their conjugations in Italian, take a
step back and read Chapter 14, where I explain the basic meanings of these tenses
and how to handle regular and irregular verbs.
You can use the conditional and the subjunctive in two ways:
 To build a sentence that stands alone: For example, with the conditional, you can
say Vorrei comprare un vestito (I’d like to buy a dress). With the subjunctive,
you can say Viva l’Italia! (Long live Italy!) or Che lui possa tornare sano e salvo!
(I wish that he comes back safe and sound!). I doubt you’ll go around talking in the
subjunctive much, but you may find the tense used in writing, so you need to
understand it.
 To put two sentences together: For example, Voglio che tu gli parli (I want you to
talk to him) or Se mi telefonasse le spiegherei tutto (If she would call me, I’d
explain everything to her). At times, you’ll need the subjunctive and the condi-
tional together; at other times, you’ll use them with the indicative (refer to
Chapters 9 through 11) or the imperative (refer to Chapter 13).
To help you deal with these options, in this chapter I explain how you can use the
conditional by itself to express wishes and polite invitations. I tell you how to build a
main sentence and then add a dependent clause that contains a declaration, forming
a declarative dependent clause. I also tell you how to build a main sentence and then
add a condition or a hypothesis, as in Se muovi la regina, lui ti dà scacco matto
(If you move your queen, he’ll give you checkmate).
Finally, I help you decide what tense you need: the present, the imperfect, the present
perfect . . . and the list goes on. Consult the sections devoted to temporal sequences
to get a full picture. Temporal sequences aren’t easy, in part because you can’t always
rely on the patterns of the English language to help you decide what to do in Italian.
With that in mind, I give you some basic guidelines to follow.

Using the Conditional by Itself
If you want something, you can be very assertive (as children are) and say Voglio un
gelato! (I want ice cream!). If you’re talking to yourself, this sort of statement is okay,
but if you’re engaging in polite conversation, you may want to be a tad less aggres-
sive. The conditional enables you to tone down your demands, as in Sposteresti la
macchina, per favore? (Would you mind moving the car, please?); and to express sur-
prise and uncertainty, as in Ci crederesti? (Can you believe that?). In such cases, you
build independent sentences with the verb in the conditional.
The conditional has a present and past tense.
 You use the present conditional when you’re talking about something that some-
one is requesting or wishing right now, as in La Signora Rossi ti vorrebbe par-
lare (Mrs. Rossi would like to talk to you).
 You use the past conditional to convey that something would have been desir-
able or appropriate, even though it’s too late now to do anything about it, as in
Avrei visto volentieri quel film una seconda volta (I would like to have seen that
movie a second time).
In both Italian and English, it’s often the case that you use some verbs to modify the
meaning of another verb. These modal verbs are dovere (must, shall), potere (can,
may), and volere (will, want to). They’re called verbi servili (modal auxiliaries)
because they provide help.
Italian also uses sapere (to know how to) as a modal auxiliary, as in Sapresti aprire la
cassaforte? (Could/Would you be able to open the safe?).
Rewrite the following sentences, adding a diplomatic nuance. Change only the verb.
Q. Comprate del pane anche per me.
A. Comprereste del pane anche per me? (Would you buy some bread for me too?)
1. Cristina e Mara, portate la valigia del nonno?
__________________________________________________________________________________
2. Signora, mi prepara il pacco per oggi pomeriggio?
__________________________________________________________________________________
3. Signori, giocano a bridge con noi?

7. Lei vuole andarsene, mentre lui vuole rimanere.
__________________________________________________________________________________
Constructing Declarative Clauses
Leaving the world of self-sufficient clauses, this section walks you through the world
of dependency, where you build an independent or main clause and then you build
another one that can’t stand on its own legs. If you start a sentence with the words 
Ti dico . . . (I’m telling you . . .), the sentence that follows, introduced by che (that) —
. . . che lui sta bene (. . . that he’s well) is a dependent declarative clause, the most
common dependent clause in English and Italian. It’s dependent because the sentence
is incomplete without the introduction provided by the main clause. It’s declarative in
the sense that you’re declaring or asserting something.
This section tells you how to put together a main clause and a dependent declarative
clause in Italian, starting with the simplest case in which both clauses are in the pres-
ent tense (of the indicative, or of the indicative plus the subjunctive). Then I tell how
to handle different tenses.
The relative pronoun che means who, whom, that, and which. It introduces relative
clauses, as in La ragazza che ha telefonato è la zia di Lia (The girl who called is Lia’s
aunt). (Chapter 8 covers relative pronouns.)
To add a declarative clause in Italian, you have two possible constructions:
 When you convey certainty in the main clause, you use the present indicative in
both clauses, as in La UPS ci informa che il pacco è in transito (UPS informs us
that the package is in transit).
 When you convey uncertainty or preference, you use the present indicative in
the main clause and the present subjunctive in the dependent clause, as in 
Spero che tua figlia guarisca (I hope that she recovers).
English often omits the conjunction that, but it’s something you may not do in Italian
when you use the present indicative in the dependent clause.
To help you make the correct construction decision, Table 15-1 provides a list of
verbs that require the indicative, and Table 15-2 a list of verbs that require the sub-
junctive. By no means do these lists include all the verbs at your disposal, but they
give you a good idea of the kinds of verbs you can use.

In colloquial Italian it’s now acceptable to use the indicative even after verbs express-
ing opinion. For example, you may encounter the sentence Penso che arriva domani
(I think he’ll arrive tomorrow). Moreover, at times you may choose the indicative or
the subjunctive depending on what you want to say. For example, you can say
Ammetto che hai ragione tu (I admit that you’re right), but also Ammette che sia
vero, ma non ne è davvero convinto (He admits it’s true, but he isn’t really convinced).
226
Part IV: Adding Nuances to Moods and Tenses 

Using the subjunctive after a verb that conveys certainty signals that the feelings are
ambivalent. In other words, when you reach this level of proficiency in a foreign lan-
guage, inflexible rules don’t make much sense. However, you won’t hear people say
Spero che tu hai ragione (I hope that you’re right) because the condition of sperare
(hoping) is too subjective to be followed by a verb in the indicative.
Using the verbs in parentheses, fill in the blanks in the following sentences with the
verbs in the present indicative or subjunctive, whichever is more appropriate.
Q. Temo che Maria _________________ scontenta del nostro lavoro. (essere)
A. Temo che Maria sia scontenta del nostro lavoro. (I’m afraid that Maria is unhappy with our
job performance.)
8. Chiedono che loro _________________ la data della firma del contratto. (spostare)
9. Credo che lei _________________ _________________ dal medico. (andare)
10. Il Signor Poretti dichiara che sua moglie _________________ il presidente della società.
(essere)
11. L’avvocato afferma che il suo cliente _________________ la verità. (dire)
12. Pensi che Mario _________________ le dimissioni? (dare)
13. Preferiscono che tu _________________ domani. (partire)
Managing Time in Declarative Clauses
In addition to declarative clauses in the present tense, you also can build them to talk
about the future, the past, or a combination of tenses. For example, you can say So
[present] che è partita [present perfect] (I know she has left/she left). Therefore, this
section gives you some guidelines on how to shift from the present to other tenses
and how to put together sentences with different tenses. I can’t by any means cover
all the options you have, so consider this section an introduction to handling tempo-
ral sequences in Italian.
The mood and tense of the main clause dictates your choice of mood and tense in the
declarative dependent clause. Then you need to consider two more issues:
 What temporal relation exists between the main and the dependent clause? You
can have a situation where the action in the dependent clause
• Happens at the same time as the action in the main clause, as in Ti dico
che Anna è dal medico (I’m telling you that Anna is at the doctor)
• Happens after the action in the main clause, as in So che lui verrà (I know
he’ll come)
• Happens before the action in the main clause, as in So che Carlo è arrivato
(I know Carlo has arrived/arrived)
227
Chapter 15: The Conditional and the Subjunctive in Action

 What kind of verb are you using in the main clause? You have two broad 
categories:
• A verb that conveys certainty, which requires a verb in the indicative in the
declarative clause, as in Io dico che lei ha sonno (I’m telling you that she’s
tired)
• A verb that conveys opinion or uncertainty, which requires a verb in the
subjunctive in the declarative clause, as in Penso che Mia lasci il lavoro
(I think Mia is about to leave her job)
Tables 15-3 and 15-4 summarize your options for declarative clauses in different
tenses.

Part IV: Adding Nuances to Moods and Tenses 

Note the use of the past conditional as pointing to the future when you have a past
tense in the main clause. Because in English you use the present conditional in this
situation, learning to shift to the past conditional in Italian takes some work. My 
suggestion: lots of practice.

fosse arrivato (. . . he had arrived)
(I’ve thought that . . .)
Imperfect: Pensavo che . . . 
(I thought that . . .)
Preterit: Pensai che . . . 
(I thought that . . .)
When you use verbs such as desiderare (to wish), preferire (to prefer), and volere 
(to want) in addressing other people, you use the present conditional in the main
clause and the imperfect subjunctive in the declarative clause. For example, Vorrei
che tu venissi al mercato (I would like it if you would come to the farmers’ market). The
action in question can happen now or in the future. If you’re talking about the past,
you can use the imperfect indicative or past conditional in the main clause and the
past perfect subjunctive in the declarative clause, as in Preferirei /Avrei preferito
che Sandra fosse partita (I would prefer/I would have preferred that Sandra had left).
229
Chapter 15: The Conditional and the Subjunctive in Action

Using the verbs in parentheses, add the verb in the indicative or the subjunctive to
the following declarative clauses.
Q. Afferma che un anno fa al processo _________________ la verità. (dire)
A. Afferma che un anno fa al processo ha detto la verità. (He/She says that he/she told the
truth at the trial a year ago.)
14. Laura stava dicendo che Luca _________________ da noi domani. (passare)
15. “Signora, desidera che le _________________ il pacco a casa?” (consegnare)
16. Lisa temeva che il dottore le _________________ brutte notizie. (dare)
17. Speravi che il professore _________________ la lezione dopo il tuo ritorno? (ripetere)
18. Nicoletta mi ha scritto che suo marito _________________ a Mosca. (arrivare)
19. Mi informano che il senatore _________________ le dimissioni ieri sera. (dare)
20. Credo che Ugo _________________ da noi ieri sera solo per vedere Carla. (venire)
Setting Conditions: Building 
If . . . Then Clauses
When you set a condition for an event to happen, you build an if . . . then clause. With
this construction, you deal both with the time when the action is taking place and the
feeling you have about it. Here are some of the possible questions that can arise:
 Is the consequence of that condition something that will surely happen?
Se dai scacco matto all’avversario, vinci la partita. (If you checkmate your
rival, you win the game.)
 Are you merely considering a possibility?
Se avessi tanti soldi comprerei una BMW. (If I had a lot of money I’d buy 
a BMW.)
 Are you saying that something is impossible?
Se avessi studiato, avresti passato l’esame. (If you had studied, you would
have passed the exam.)
When you build these kinds of sentences, you choose moods and tenses so as to
convey both the time when something happens (or doesn’t) and its real, possible, or
unreal aspect. So in order to build if . . . then clauses, you need to be able to handle
mood — that is, the feeling or impression you convey about a situation — as well as
the temporal sequence.
In the following sections, I start with two different moods you convey with if . . . then
clauses and their basic temporal sequence. Then I move into variations on that 
temporal sequence.
230
Part IV: Adding Nuances to Moods and Tenses 

Real, possible, and unreal if . . . then clauses
In both Italian and English you often start an if . . . then clause with the dependent
clause followed by the main clause, as in Se vieni anche tu [dependent clause], vado
a vedere la partita [main clause] (If you come too, I’ll go to the soccer game). You need
to identify the main clause correctly because it’s the clause that dictates mood and
tense of the dependent clause, even if it comes second when you speak or write. 
(By the way, it’s perfectly acceptable to invert the order of the clauses.)
When you talk about conditions and hypotheses in Italian, you use four moods: the
indicative, the imperative, the conditional, and the subjunctive.
In the if clause, you never use the conditional after the word se, as in se sarei (if I
would be). Other than that rule, you’ll find the array of possible combinations in the
following list. I introduce the various options with examples because it’s easier to
explain what’s going on (and what you need to do) if I refer to a concrete case.
 You can assert that, given a certain condition, a consequence will follow: Se
prendi la medicina, guarisci/ guarirai (If you take the medication, you’ll recover).
In this case, you use the present or future tense of the indicative guarisci/guari-
rai (you will recover) in the main clause and prendi/prenderai (you take/you’ll
take) in the dependent clause. The tense you choose depends on whether you’re
talking about the present, the near future, or the distant future.
 You can say that something is merely possible or even unreal:
• You may talk about the present: Se prendessi la medicina, guariresti
(If you would take/If you took your medication, you would recover). Here you
use the present conditional guariresti (you would recover) in the main
clause, and the imperfect subjunctive prendessi (you would take/took) in
the dependent clause. That person may take the medication (possible situ-
ation), or you know that he won’t (unreal situation). You just want to tell
him what would happen if he did something. So in this case the present
conditional conveys that you’re talking about the present, whereas the
imperfect subjunctive doesn’t convey so much time as mood — a mood of
possibility and uncertainty.
• You may talk about the past: Se avessi preso la medicina, saresti guarito
(If you had taken your medication, you would have recovered). This is an
unreal situation because you do know what happened: The person in ques-
tion didn’t take his medication and didn’t recover, but you believe that the
medication would have helped. So in this case the past perfect subjunctive
avessi preso (you had taken) and the past conditional saresti guarito (you
would have recovered) convey both time and mood.
Nowadays it’s acceptable to use the imperfect indicative to convey impossibility: 
Se mi avvertivate prima, portavo io la pizza [Se mi aveste avvertito prima, avrei
portato io la pizza] (If you [had] told me before, I would have brought pizza). It’s 
also acceptable to use the imperfect indicative together with the past subjunctive: 
Se venivi [fossi venuto] con noi, ti saresti divertito (If you had come with us, you
would have had fun).
231
Chapter 15: The Conditional and the Subjunctive in Action

Table 15-5 summarizes the sequence of moods and tenses for the three cases.
Table 15-5
If . . . Then Clauses: Sequence of Moods and Tenses
Type of Condition or Hypothesis Tense and Mood of the 
Tense and Mood of the 
Condition (Dependent 
Consequence (Main Clause)
Clause)
Certain or real
se parto (I leave)
arrivo/arriverò (I’ll arrive/
I’ll be arriving)
se partirò (I’ll leave)
arriverò (I’ll arrive/I’ll be arriving)
Possible or unreal in the present se partissi (I left/I would arriverei (I would arrive)
leave)
Unreal in the past
se fossi partito
sarei arrivato (I would have 
(I had left)
arrived)
Using the verbs in parentheses, add the appropriate verbal forms to each dependent
clause. Keep the same subject in both sentences. When the if . . . then clause is of the
real type, use the same mood and tense you find in the main clause.
Q. Se la _________________, le restituisco il suo libro. (vedere)
A. Se la vedo, le restituisco il suo libro. (If I see her, I’ll give her back her book.)
21. Se _________________ una macchina ibrida, risparmieremmo benzina. (comprare)
22. Se Umberto _________________ tra due ore, arriva stasera. (partire)
23. Se _________________ il corso di latino, avrà mia zia come professore. (prendere)
24. Se _________________ in India, farei un corso di yoga. (andare)
25. Se _________________ me, avreste risparmiato molti soldi. (ascoltare)
26. Se lo _________________, lo avrebbero invitato a cena. (vedere)
Handling variations of temporal 
sequences of if . . . then clauses
It’s important to note that when you have an if . . . then clause of the possible or
unreal type, the sequence of tenses is fixed. But when you build if . . . then clauses of
the real type, you have more options, depending on what you want to say. Here’s a
rundown: If you use if . . . then clauses
 To talk about rules of a game, you use the present indicative in both sentences.
For example, Se vuoi giocare a tennis, hai bisogno di una racchetta e una pal-
lina (If you want to play tennis, you need a tennis racquet and a tennis ball).
232
Part IV: Adding Nuances to Moods and Tenses 

 To describe a hypothetical situation in the present or the near future, you can
use the present or future indicative. For example, Se compri/comprerai una
barca, vengo/verrò a fare vela con te (If you buy a boat, I’ll come sailing with you).
You choose the present indicative when you talk about the present or the near
future, and you choose the simple future when you refer to a moment farther
away in time.
 To describe a hypothetical situation in the present or the future, you can also
use the imperative (see Chapter 13) in the main clause when you want to issue
an invitation or a warning. For example, Se passi da Roma, vieni a trovarmi
(If you come to Rome, come see me); Se leggi il libro, non dirmi come va a
finire! (If you read the book, don’t tell me how it ends!).
In English, you don’t use the future in the if component of if . . . then clauses,
whereas in Italian you do.
 To talk about the past, you use the present perfect. For example, Se hai letto il
libro, hai visto che è a lieto fine (If you [have] read the book, you saw/have seen
it has a happy ending).
Keep in mind that you can combine different tenses, because you may have an if clause
about a situation that precedes the one in the then clause. For example, Se sono partiti
ieri, arriveranno fra tre giorni (If they left yesterday, they’ll arrive in three days).
You also can use the preterit (see Chapter 11) when writing fiction or history. For
example, Se il generale comprese di aver perso, non lo diede a vedere (If the gen-
eral understood he had lost, he didn’t show it).
Choose the appropriate conclusions to the sentences from the options provided, and
write them in the blanks.

Satisfying Your Curiosity with
Questions and Answers
In This Chapter
 Trying different ways of asking questions
 Asking (and answering) negative questions
 Playing with more ways of answering questions
C
onstructing questions and answers is one of the easiest things you can do in
Italian. You don’t need an auxiliary verb, and you don’t need to change the word
order. You can turn any sentence into a question by simply adding a question mark at
the end. For example:
Laura studia il russo. (Laura studies Russian.) →Laura studia il russo? (Does
Laura study Russian?)
You can also begin your question with question words, such as come (how) or dove
(where). In this chapter, I tell you what those words are in Italian and how you can use
them. You also can use interrogative adjectives and pronouns, such as quanto,
quanta, quanti, quante (how much, how many); for example, Quante ciliegie hai
mangiato? (How many cherries did you eat?). These words vary in gender and
number. With words such as quale (which, what) and chi (who), you use interrogative
pronouns. (You also encounter them in Chapter 8 as relative pronouns.) 
Despite the fact that asking questions in Italian is so easy, I do have some things to
explain to you. First of all, I clarify how you can provide positive answers, as in Laura
studia il russo (Laura does study Russian); or negative answers, as in Laura non
studia il russo (Laura doesn’t study Russian). I also tell you how to ask interrogative-
negative questions, as in Laura non studia il russo? (Doesn’t Laura study Russian?).
Finally, I talk about words you use in answers, especially when you give negative
answers, and the use of multiple negatives, as in “È venuto qualcuno alla festa?”
“Non è venuto nessuno” (“Did anyone come to the party?” “No one came”).

The Three Ways of Asking a Question
You can ask questions in three ways (depending on what you want to say, of course):
 Add a question mark to an affirmative or negative sentence.
Vai al mercato? (Are you going to the market?)
Non vai al mercato? (Aren’t you going to the market?)
 Use question words, such as quando (when), dove (where), come (how), perché
(why), or che/che cosa (what).
Dove vai in vacanza? (Where will you go on vacation?)
 Use interrogative adjectives and pronouns, such as quale (what, which) or chi
(who).
Quale borsa prendi? (What purse are you taking?)
Chi compra il latte? (Who will buy milk?)
Adding a question mark to a sentence
Asking questions by adding a question mark to an affirmative or negative sentence is
pretty straightforward. I don’t have much to say about that because it’s so easy, but I
can spare a few words about the position of the subject in the sentence when you do
express it with a specific word, noun, name, or pronoun — something that may or
may not happen, especially when it comes to pronouns.
As you know from Chapter 9 (and if you haven’t looked at it, check it out), in Italian
you don’t use subject pronouns very much because the verb’s ending takes care of
conveying who’s performing the action. For example, in the sentence Dove stai
andando? (Where are you going?), the subject is implied by the verb (which is conju-
gated to you singular) and the question is perfectly clear. But when you want to use a
name, noun, or pronoun, you can place any of these in different positions in the sen-
tence, depending on what you mean. Mind, you’re entering the realm of nuances here
because the fundamental meaning of your question (or answer) isn’t affected. Here
are your options:
 You can use a name or a noun. If you ask a direct, non-emphatic question, you
place the subject after the verb, as in Dove sono i ragazzi? (Where are the
boys?). If you invert the word order and ask I ragazzi dove sono? (The boys,
where are they?), you add emphasis, perhaps because you’re slightly worried.
The same happens if you use a name.
 You may want to add a pronoun, for two reasons:
• To avoid misunderstandings. You place the pronoun before the verb, as in
Lei accetterà quel lavoro? (Will she accept that job?).
• To add emphasis. You place the pronoun after the verb, as in Pagano loro
le tasse? (Do they pay taxes?). As you can see from the translation, in
English your question doesn’t really convey the nuance you find in Italian.
You’d probably construct your sentence differently in English, perhaps
saying They will pay the taxes, won’t they?
238
Part IV: Adding Nuances to Moods and Tenses 

Employing the obvious: Question words
Another classic way of asking questions is by introducing the sentence with a ques-
tion word. Question words are adverbs, which are all invariable. You don’t have to
change the word order of the sentence; you merely add the question word at the
beginning. Here are the Italian question words with some examples of usage:
 Quando (when): Quando parti? (When are you leaving?)
 Come (how): Come stai? (How are you?)
 Dove (where): Dove andate? (Where are you going?)
 Perché (why): Perché vendi la bici? (Why are you selling your bike?)
In Italian, the interrogative adverb perché (why) is the same as the conjunction
perché (because) with which you introduce subordinate clauses that explain the rea-
sons or causes of an event. Compare the following examples: Perché mi hai tele-
fonato? (Why did you call me?); Ti ho telefonato perché avevo bisogno del tuo
parere (I called you because I need your opinion).
You use come and perché by themselves, but you can add a preposition to quando
and dove, depending on the question you’re asking. For example, you say Dove vai?
(Where are you going?) but Per quale città devi passare per andare a Roma?
(Through what city are you going to go to Rome?). Because quando enables you to ask
questions about time and dove about place, you employ some of the prepositions
that have to do with time and place. Table 16-1 lists only the simple prepositions you
can use in this context, their meanings, and some examples of how to use them with
quando and dove. (Chapter 6 has full coverage of prepositions.)

Add the appropriate question word to the following sentences.

A. Perché hai giocato l’asse di cuori? (Why did you play the ace of hearts?)

2. _________________ vai in vacanza, tra una settimana o tra due?
3. _________________ hai accettato quel lavoro?
4. _________________ spieghi quello che è successo?
Using interrogative pronouns 
to ask about specifics
You can also ask questions starting with interrogative pronouns, which enable you to
ask something specific about people, things, and situations. You place an interroga-
tive pronoun at the beginning of a question. As you probably already know at this
point, this rule isn’t iron-clad because Italian is pretty flexible with word order. But at
this stage of your knowledge of the language, I recommend that you follow that sug-
gestion when you build an interrogative sentence.
The following interrogative pronouns are invariable (they don’t take masculine or
feminine, singular or plural endings):
 chi (who, whom): Used as a subject (who) or direct object (whom) only with
people (and some animals) to inquire about
• The identity of people and some animals, with the verb essere (to be) con-
jugated in the person you’re inquiring about, as in Chi sono le tue amiche?
(Who are your girlfriends?)
• Who’s performing the action, with the verb always in the third-person sin-
gular, as in Chi va al mare? (Who’s going to the beach of all your sisters?)
 che cosa, cosa (what): Used as a subject or direct object only with things or situ-
ations to inquire about
• What action is being performed, as in Che cosa ti preoccupa? (What’s wor-
rying you?); Che cosa fate? (What are you doing?)
• What’s happening, with verbs such as succedere and accadere (to happen),
followed by the verb in the third-person singular, as in Che cosa succede?
(What’s happening?)
Instead of cosa or che cosa you can use che. It’s more colloquial and a bit more
aggressive, as in Ma che dici? (What are you saying?).
Table 16-2 lists interrogative adjectives/pronouns, which vary in gender and number
or only in number.

Chapter 16: Satisfying Your Curiosity with Questions and Answers

To convey the English pronoun whose, you add the preposition di to the pronoun chi,
as in Di chi sono questi guanti? (Whose gloves are these?).
As you can see in the table, quale varies in number but not gender. It drops the -e
before the third-person singular of the verb essere (to be) but doesn’t take an apos-
trophe, so it becomes qual era (what, which was). You use it
 To inquire about the identity of a person or thing, as in Qual è il loro numero di
telefono? (What’s their telephone number?)
 To select one or more items in a group, as in Quali gonne ti interessano? (Which
skirts interest you?)
Quanto varies in gender and number. You use it to inquire about quantities regarding
persons or things, coordinating it with the noun to which it refers if that noun is
expressed. Otherwise, use the default masculine singular or plural (see Table 16-2), 
as in Quanto costa il vestito? (How much does that dress cost?); “Avevamo cento
membri.” “Quanti si sono iscritti di nuovo?” (“We had 100 members.” “How many
reenrolled?”).
You can also use che (which is invariable) as an interrogative adjective before nouns
referring to people and things, as in Che lavoro fa? (What’s his/her job?).
When you use the interrogative adjective or pronoun as the subject of a sentence,
you need to decide what person the verb will take. And if the verb is in a compound
form (such as the present perfect, as in sono andato [I have gone]), you also need to
decide the ending of the past participle. When you use any interrogative adjective or
pronoun as direct object with a transitive verb, which takes avere (to have) as its aux-
iliary, in compound tenses you leave the past participle in the default masculine sin-
gular. For example, Quali libri hai comprato? (Which books did you buy?).
You also can add prepositions to interrogative adjectives/pronouns, as in Di quante
pere hai bisogno per la torta? (How many pears do you need for the cake?). With
quali (what, which) and quanto (how much) (but not quanta), and quanti/quante
(how many), you also can use the preposition fra/tra (by, between, among). Consider
these examples:
Fra quanto tornate? (How long before you come back?)
Tra quanti appartamenti potete scegliere? (Among how many apartments can you
choose?)
Add the appropriate question word or interrogative adjective or pronoun to the fol-
lowing sentences, choosing among the options in parentheses.
Q. (Chi/Che cosa/Quale) è capitato?
A. Che cosa è capitato? (What happened?)
5. (Chi/Quale/Quanto) bussa alla porta?
6. (A chi/Di chi/Qual) è quell’ombrello?
7. (Con quale/Con chi/Chi) giochi a pallone?

The Nuances of Negative Adjectives 
and Pronouns: Q & A
To ask a negative question, you use any of the three formulas I outline for asking posi-
tive questions and simply add non (not) to the sentence, placing it right before the
verbal form, simple or compound. Consider these examples:
Laura non ha studiato il russo? (Hasn’t Laura studied Russian?)
Perché non ci avete risposto? (Why didn’t you answer us?)
Chi non mangia la carne? (Who doesn’t eat meat?)
However, you need to be aware of one important difference between Italian and
English: Italian doesn’t have the English allergy to piling up negations in negative
questions (and answers). Check out this example: Non gli ha mai più detto nulla nes-
suno? (No one ever told him anything ever again?). This sentence has five negative
words — four if you count the adverbial phrase mai più (ever again) as one. The rule
of thumb is to not look at your English sentence as a complete statement in which
you can keep only one word in the negative. Instead look at it as a collection of nega-
tive words. For example, in the example sentence, besides the pronoun No one, ever
again and anything are non-negative versions of negative words (never again and noth-
ing). When you need them in Italian, choose their negative forms.
When you ask a negative question you often use negative adjectives and pronouns.
Here are the few things you need to know about using them:
 Nessuno, nessuna (no, no one, nobody, not any) is only singular. As an adjective,
you use it before a masculine or a feminine noun, as in Non hanno visto nessuna
amica (They saw no friend/They didn’t see any friend). As a pronoun, you use it
with verbs in the singular and you choose the default singular masculine form
for the past participle in a compound verbal form, as in Non è partito nessuno
(No one left).
 Niente/Nulla (nothing, not anything) refers only to things. It’s only singular and
takes the default singular masculine form for the past participle in a compound
verbal form, as in Non è successo niente (Nothing happened). There is no differ-
ence in meaning between niente and nulla.
Besides indefinite pronouns such as nessuno and niente used in questions and
answers, you have an array of words at your disposal, mostly adverbs, to convey neg-
ative situations. You can use the adverbs
 nemmeno/neanche/neppure (not even), followed by a noun, a pronoun, or a
name, as in Non lo sapevi neanche tu? (Not even you knew that?). You can
choose any of those three words according to your taste.
243
Chapter 16: Satisfying Your Curiosity with Questions and Answers

 né . . . né (neither . . . nor), as in Non lo hanno comprato né lui né lei? (Neither
he nor she bought it?)
Then you can use the following adverbial phrases: 
 non . . . ancora (not yet), as in Non l’hanno ancora vista? (Haven’t they seen 
her yet?).
 non . . . mai (never, not ever), as in Non l’avete mai vista? (Did you ever see her?)
 non . . . più (no longer, not any longer, no more, not any more), as in Non la vedi
più? (Don’t you see her any longer?) 
With these adverbial phrases you place non before the verb (simple or compound)
and the other component after a simple verbal form, or right after the auxiliary in a
compound form, as in the preceding examples. (For more information about adverbs
and their placement, head back to Chapter 5.)
Now, on to the most important exception regarding negations: You drop the adverb
non (not) from the sentence (question or answer) if you begin your sentence with one
of the following words:
 nessuno
 nemmeno/neanche/neppure (followed by a noun, a pronoun, or a name)
 niente
 né . . . né
Nessuno ha mangiato niente? (No one ate anything?)
Né Laura né Piero sono d’accordo? (Neither Laura nor Piero agree?)
Mind, I said if you start a sentence with those words. You don’t have to. The sentence
Non ha mangiato niente nessuno (No one ate anything) is perfectly all right. It’s your
choice whether to use one construction or the other.
Responding to Questions
What kind of answer you give to a question depends on the question being asked.
When you answer an information question in the negative, you have an array of nega-
tive words to add to your answer. You can choose any of the negative adjectives and
pronouns or adverbs that I list in the earlier section “Using interrogative pronouns to
ask about specifics.” All you have to do is to take out the question mark. So a ques-
tion such as Non l’hanno ancora vista? (Haven’t they seen her yet?) can become an
answer: Non l’hanno ancora vista (They haven’t seen her yet). Similarly, Nessuno ha
mangiato niente? (No one ate anything?) becomes Nessuno ha mangiato niente (No
one ate anything).

Penso di no. (I think not.)
senza dubbio (without any doubt)

Using a pronoun in a response
When you engage in a conversation involving questions and answers, pronouns come
in handy. If someone asks you “Conosci Mauro?” (“Do you know Mauro?”), instead of
answering “Conosco Mauro/Non conosco Mauro” (“I know Mauro/I don’t know
Mauro”), you can say “Lo conosco/Non lo conosco” (“I know him/I don’t know him”).
(You can find more on pronouns in Chapter 4.)
You can use personal pronouns in your answers when the word you don’t want to
repeat is a specific person or thing. But many times your answer will regard the entire
situation mentioned in the question. If someone asks you “Sapevi che i ghiacciai
della Groenlandia si stanno sciogliendo a un ritmo che prepoccupa persino gli
scienziati più pessimisti?” (“Did you know that the glaciers in Greenland are melting 
at a rate that’s alarming even the most pessimistic scientists?”), you can answer “Lo
sapevo/Non lo sapevo” (“I knew it/I didn’t know it”). The pronoun lo (it, that), which
you don’t need in English, refers to the entire argument conveyed by the questions. In
Italian you can use some set phrases that employ three pronouns: lo, ci (here, there,
about this, about that), and ne (of this, of that, of him, of her, of them). (See Chapter 4
for more on these pronouns.)
“Sapevi che Marta si sposa?” (“Did you know Marta is getting married?”); “Lo/Non
lo sapevo.” (“I did/I didn’t know.”)

Chapter 17
The Reflexive, Passive, and
Impersonal Constructions
In This Chapter
 Being the object of your own actions
 Changing active statements into passive ones
 Conveying that someone (you don’t know exactly who) is doing something
M
ost of the time you build sentences in which a known agent performs an action
that may or may not have an impact on an object. But that scenario doesn’t
always apply; in this chapter, I discuss situations where you need to use a special
verb form because
 The subject is the object of its own action, in which case you use the reflexive form.
 The subject of the sentence is the passive recipient of an action performed by an
agent (note the passive voice in italics here — smooth, aren’t I?), in which case
you need the passive form.
 An anonymous someone is doing something, in which case you need the imper-
sonal form.
This chapter explains how you can build those constructions in Italian and helps you
understand when it’s appropriate to use them.
Turning Yourself into the Object 
of Your Own Actions
In both Italian and English, a reflexive verb allows you to say that an action is directed
at the subject who’s performing it. Italian uses reflexive verbs more than English,
employing them to convey that
 The subject is performing an action on himself or herself: Io mi lavo (I’m washing
myself).
 Something is happening to the subject himself or herself, even though it’s not
something the person is really doing: Io mi sveglio (I’m waking up).

 The action is directed at the subject and a part of himself or herself: Io mi lavo
le mani (I wash my hands).
 The subject is doing something for himself or herself: Io mi faccio gli spaghetti
(I’m cooking spaghetti for myself).
 Two or more people engage in a reciprocal action: Noi ci scriviamo (We write to
one another).
Forming reflexive verbs
In order to tell a reflexive verb from a regular transitive or intransitive verb, look for
the ending -si attached to the stem of the infinitive without the final -e: lavare (to
wash) →lavarsi (to wash oneself). Then conjugate a reflexive verb in the desired
mood and tense by following these steps:
1. Conjugate the verb as usual (see Parts III and IV), adding the auxiliary essere in
compound tenses: I bambini si sono addormentati. (The children have fallen
asleep.) Turn to Chapter 9 for coverage of compound tenses.
But, when you attach the pronoun to an infinitive that follows a modal auxiliary,
instead of essere (to be), you use avere (to have) as the auxiliary because the
verb you’re conjugating is the modal auxiliary rather than the reflexive verb.
2. Coordinate the past participle with the subject in compound tenses: Le bambine
si sono addormentate. (The little girls have fallen asleep.) Turn to Chapter 9 to
find out about past participles and coordination.
3. Place the reflexive pronouns mi (myself), ti (yourself), si (himself, herself, itself,
oneself), ci (ourselves), vi (yourselves), si (themselves) before the verb: I bambini
si addormentano. (The children are falling asleep.) I cover reflexive pronouns in
Chapter 4.
Here’s an example of a verb conjugated in the reflexive form.
lavarsi (to wash oneself): Present Indicative
io mi lavo (I wash myself)
noi ci laviamo (we wash
ourselves)
tu ti lavi (you wash yourself)
voi vi lavate (you wash yourselves)
lui/lei/Lei/esso si lava
loro/Loro/essi/esse si lavano (they 
(he/she/it/one washes 
wash themselves)
himself/herself/itself/oneself)
Ci laviamo le mani prima di mangiare. (We wash our hands before eating.)
You place the reflexive pronouns before the verb in all moods and tenses, as illus-
trated in Table 17-1, except for verbal forms that use the gerund or the infinitive. 
For example, Lavarsi le mani prima di mangiare è importante (To wash one’s 
hands before eating is important). (I cover gerunds and modal auxiliaries in Chapters 9
and 10.)

Transforming a transitive 
verb into a reflexive verb
In Italian you can make most transitive verbs — verbs that require both a subject and
an object — reflexive by adding the ending -si to the infinitive of the verb. You do this
when you need the action of a regular transitive verb to fall on the speaker. For exam-
ple, Io mi guardo allo specchio (I’m looking at myself in the mirror); La neve si è 
sciolta (The snow thawed). For more information on transitive verbs, turn to Chapter 9.
Most transitive verbs can be turned into reflexive verbs; as a rule of thumb, use dis-
cernment: You can certainly wash an apple and yourself, but you can’t drink a beer
and yourself, right? If you aren’t sure whether a verb you just turned into its reflexive
form exists, check the dictionary.
Some reflexive verbs have a passive meaning, such as rompersi (to break). For exam-
ple, in the sentence Il bicchiere si è rotto (The glass was/got broken), you’re techni-
cally saying that the glass was damaged, but the verb used to express that idea is
reflexive even though the glass didn’t really do anything to itself.
The transitive and reflexive meanings of a verb may not differ much. Quel film mi ha
annoiata (That movie bored me) means more or less the same as Mi sono annoiata a
vedere quel film (I got bored watching that movie). But Si è ucciso (He killed himself)
is very different from L’hanno ucciso (They killed him). A dictionary will always tell
you a verb’s transitive and reflexive meanings.
Table 17-2 shows the meanings that common transitive verbs acquire when becoming
reflexive.

Verbs that are pretty much purely reflexive
Some Italian verbs are used mainly in their reflexive sense. If used transitively, they
just wouldn’t make sense. English has such verbs as well, although they’re definitely
less common. Consider to enjoy oneself: You wouldn’t say “I enjoyed at the party,”
would you?
The following list shows verbs used mostly, if not only, in the reflexive form:
 arrabbiarsi, adirarsi (to get angry)
 lamentarsi (to complain)
 arrendersi (to surrender)
 ostinarsi (to persist)
 coricarsi (to lie down)
 pentirsi (to repent)
 fidanzarsi (to get engaged)
 sedersi (to sit)
 inchinarsi (to bow)
 suicidarsi (to commit suicide)
 innamorarsi (to fall in love)
 vergognarsi (to be ashamed of)
Acting on the body (or parts of it): Reflexive
pronoun + transitive verb + direct object
When you talk about someone doing something to his or her body or parts of it, you
can “build” a reflexive meaning by using a transitive verb followed by a direct object
and preceded by a reflexive pronoun conveying that the action falls onto the subject.
In fact, the reflexive pronouns mi, ti, si, and so on mean, in this sense, a/per me
(to/for me), te (to/for you), lui (to/for him), and so on (see Chapter 4). The subject
isn’t the direct object of the action — as is the case with real reflexive verbs — but
rather it’s an indirect object: You’re doing things for yourself.
This construction adds emphasis and avoids confusion about the recipient of the
action. If you say Io lavo i capelli (I’m washing hair), you aren’t saying whether you’re
washing your own hair or someone else’s. But if you add a reflexive pronoun and say
Io mi lavo i capelli, you can only be washing your own hair.
253
Chapter 17: The Reflexive, Passive, and Impersonal Constructions

Similarly, if the Italian verb you’re using is followed by the prepositions a/per, as in
insegnare a (to teach), dire a (to say, to tell), or raccontare a qualcuno (to tell), you
use the reflexive form. For example, Mi insegno l’inglese da sola (I’m teaching English
to myself).
Following are some common verbs used in talking about yourself:
 depilarsi (to shave) 
 rompersi (to break [a limb])
 lavarsi (to wash oneself)
 spazzolarsi (to brush one’s hair)
 mettersi (to put on)
 struccarsi (to take off make-up)
 pettinarsi (to comb one’s hair)
 tagliarsi (to cut oneself)
 prepararsi (to prepare)
 tingersi (to dye [one’s hair])
 pulirsi (to clean oneself)
 togliersi (to take off)
 radersi, farsi la barba (to shave)
 truccarsi (to put on make-up)
When speaking about yourself, you can use the reflexive form to emphasize the action
that would normally require a simple transitive verb. This use of the reflexive accen-
tuates the fact that you’re doing something to pamper yourself. For example, Adesso
bevo un bicchiere di vino (I am drinking a glass of wine now) is transitive; Adesso mi
bevo un bel bicchiere di vino! (Now I am going to drink a nice glass of wine!) is reflex-
ive. The following list shows the most common transitive verbs used in a reflexive
form in order to convey this idea.
 ascoltarsi (to listen to)
 farsi (to do)
 bersi (to drink)
 giocarsi (to gamble away)
 comprarsi (to buy)
 mangiarsi (to eat)
 cucinarsi (to cook)
 vedersi (to see, to watch)
If you use a compound with a past participle, you coordinate it with the subject if the
object follows the verb, and you coordinate it with the object pronoun preceding the
verbs (see Chapter 4 on pronouns). For example, “Lia si è lavata le mani?” “Se le è
lavate.” (“Did Lia wash her hands?” “She did.”).

Engaging in reciprocal actions
People often engage in activities characterized by reciprocity: They speak to one
another, write to one another, and so on. You convey this action in English with the
verb in the active form accompanied by the phrases each other/one another, or by
using the verb to get + a past participle. In Italian, you use a reflexive verb in the
plural because the subject will include at least two people (the section “Forming
reflexive verbs,” earlier in this chapter, shows you how to form the plural reflexive
verb). Consider these examples:
Si conoscono da molti anni. (They’ve know each other for many years.)
Marina e Pietro si sono fidanzati. (Marina and Pietro got engaged.)
Following is a list of some verbs with which you can convey reciprocity. Of course,
you can also use some of these verbs to convey an emotion or a state of mind, saying
that the subject is feeling something about himself or herself, as in Nadia si conosce
bene (Nadia knows herself very well) as opposed to Nadia e Maria si conoscono da
due anni (Nadia and Maria have known each other for two years).

Moving from the Active to the Passive Form
In the most common sentence construction, the active form, you line up a subject, a
verb, and an object. Sometimes, though, you may want or need to flip the order of the
subject and object, producing the passive form. When the recipient is a direct object,
you can take that object and turn it into the subject, making the subject the agent
responsible for that action. The passive form is useful when you don’t know or aren’t
sure who’s performing the action. In Italian, journalists and the news media often use
the passive as a means of delivering information as objectively as possible. For exam-
ple, you may read “Il corpo di una donna è stato trovato privo di vita ieri mattina in
Piazza Statuto” (“The body of a woman was found dead yesterday morning in Piazza
Statuto”).
You can only turn verbs that take a direct object from active to passive because the
object becomes the subject of a passive sentence.
Passive verbal forms are always compound forms because you need both an auxiliary
verb to convey mood and tense and a past participle to convey that something is
being done. To turn an active sentence into a passive one, such as L’inquinamento
causa l’effetto serra (Pollution causes the greenhouse effect), follow these steps:
256
Part IV: Adding Nuances to Moods and Tenses 

1. Conjugate the auxiliary essere in the tense and mood you need, choosing the
person and number that matches the object (which is now the subject of the
sentence).
L’effetto serra è . . . (The greenhouse effect is . . .)
2. Add the past participle of the main verb coordinated with the subject.
causato . . . (caused . . .)
3. Add the agent, person, or thing responsible for the action, introduced by the
preposition da (by) (if an agent is expressed).
. . . dall’inquinamento (. . . by pollution)
Table 17-3 gives you some examples of tenses in the active and passive forms. You can
find complete verb charts in the active, passive, and reflexive forms in Appendix A.

If you use a compound tense, you need two past participles in the passive form: that
of the main verb and that of the auxiliary essere (stato, stata, stati, state [been]), both
coordinated with the subject. The following example progresses from an active sen-
tence in the present tense (1) to a passive in the present tense (2), and then from an
active sentence in the past (3) to a passive in the past (4):
(1) Loro mangiano la torta. (They’re eating the cake.)
(2) La torta è mangiata da loro. (The cake is being eaten by them.)
(3) Loro hanno mangiato la torta. (They’ve eaten the cake.)
(4) La torta è stata mangiata da loro. (The cake has been eaten by them.)

Referring to the Anonymous “Someone”
In English, when you aren’t sure who’s performing an action, or when you want to
convey a generic subject, you say that people, we, you, they, or one do/does something
(or you use the passive voice; refer to the earlier section “Moving from the Active to
the Passive Form”). To refer to this type of anonymous someone, Italian employs the
pronoun si followed by a third-person verb. For example, In questo ristorante si beve
dell’ottimo vino (In this restaurant we/you/one drink[s] excellent wine).
When the construction si + verb is followed by a plural noun, the verb is in the third-
person plural, as in Si mangiano le pesche d’estate (You can eat peaches in
summer/Peaches are eaten in summer).
When using the impersonal si in a present perfect tense, essere (to be) is the auxiliary
verb (see Chapter 8 for more on working with compound tenses), followed by the
past participle of the verb. For example, Si è mangiato (We ate).
258
Part IV: Adding Nuances to Moods and Tenses 

Note: The same rule of agreement is applied when the construction si + verb is fol-
lowed by a plural noun in the past, as in Si sono mangiate delle pere squisite (We ate
[one ate] some delicious pears).
When si is followed by the verb essere and an adjective, the adjective agrees in
gender and number with the subject. For example, Si è belle (We [women] are 
beautiful).
You can use most verbs — transitive and intransitive — impersonally; for example, Si
va (we go), si parte (we leave), si beve (we drink), si impara (we learn), and si dice
(people say). Only the context tells you what subject you want to use in English.
Si va al cinema stasera? (Are we going to the movies tonight?)
Si dice che la tregua non durerà. (People say that the truce won’t hold.)
If you use a reflexive verb impersonally, which you do when the action is expressed
by a reflexive verb but the subject isn’t stated, you add the pronoun ci to the imper-
sonal si: Ci si lava ogni mattina (One washes oneself every morning).
Translate the following sentences into Italian using the construction with si. Consult
Chapter 15 for instructions on building declarative dependent clauses.
Q. You can apply for a fellowship online.
A. Si può fare domanda per una borsa di studio on line.
25. People say that the princess was killed.

hen you’re talking with someone in Italian, you

tion about how to express yourself better. But if you’re
writing in Italian, you’re on your own — with the help of
the chapters in this part, of course. In this part, I warn you
about some false friends, or words that look similar in
Italian and English but mean different things. I share
advice on different ways to express yourself and handle
nuances of the language, and I also bring your attention to
subtle differences in meaning of ten important verb pairs.

T
his chapter is a mix of Italian grammar tips intended to help you avoid some
simple mistakes as well as enrich your Italian speaking and writing skills. I start
with what are called in language-learning jargon false friends — words that look simi-
lar in Italian and English but have different meanings — and move on to other tricky
things like verbs used as adjectives or nouns, different ways of expressing the passive
voice, and idiomatic constructions. I also tell you how to convey strong emotions and
elicit someone’s agreement with what you’re saying. In other words, this chapter 
is devoted to nuances of the language that should help you move toward greater 
fluency.
False Friends: Similar Italian and English
Words Don’t Necessarily Share Meanings
Italian and English share a lot of words derived from Latin. In several cases, the
shared words have similar meanings, like fortunatamente, which means fortunately. In
other cases, their meanings are different: Catholic can translate to the Italian univer-
sale or cattolico, depending on the context.
You’ll also encounter Italian and English words that resemble one another in spelling
but that don’t share the same linguistic origin. Words like these trick you into believ-
ing you can guess their meanings when you actually can’t. These are false friends. I list
the most common of these false friends in Table 18-1; note how the Italian words in
the first column are spelled similar to the English words in the third column.

Italian Verbs Can Have Multiple Functions
You can turn the infinitive of Italian verbs into nouns by adding the singular masculine
article il (or l’ or lo, depending on the verb’s first letters) to the infinitive. This use of
the infinitive corresponds to the gerund in English. For example, il bere (drinking).
You also can turn the present and past participles of verbs into adjectives or nouns.
 Present participle: You form the present participle by adding -ante or -ente to
the stem of the verb, so that cantare becomes cantante (singing) and attrarre
becomes attraente (attractive). Here the distinction between present participle
and gerund (see the moods and tense table on the Cheat Sheet) comes in handy:
While the past participle ends in -ante or -ente (plural -anti or -enti), the gerund
ends in -ando or -endo, as in andando (going), dormendo (sleeping), and
finendo (finishing). It’s invariable and it can only function as a verbal form. 
267
Chapter 18: Ten Facts to Remember about Italian Grammar

You can use the present participle as an adjective, as in La ragazza era attraente
(The girl was attractive) or as a noun, as in Il cantante venne applaudito (The
singer was applauded).
 Past participle: You can use the past participle as a noun. Past participles that
become nouns can be masculine, as in il passato (the past), or feminine, as in la
veduta (view). Past participles also can become adjectives, but because they
end in -o, they can take four forms: -o, -a, -i, or -e. For example, the past participle
amato becomes amata, amati, amate, as in Petrarca scrisse molte poesie alla
donna amata (Petrarch wrote many poems to his beloved).
Some Verbs Turn the Object into the Subject
The verb piacere literally means to be pleasing to even though it corresponds to the
verb to like. In English, you can use to like to say, I like ice cream, but you also could
say, Ice cream is pleasing to me. The latter may sound awkward, but it’s still grammati-
cally correct. The construction is similar to the Italian verb piacere: Il gelato piace a
me, or more fluently, Mi piace il gelato. You coordinate the verb with the thing that’s
liked, and you convey the person who likes something with an indirect object pro-
noun, mostly conjugated in third-person singular and plural, placed before the verb
(see Chapter 4 for more information about pronouns). (Remember that the opposite
of piacere is non piacere.)
You use the same construction you use for piacere with several other verbs, which I
show in the following list:
268
Part V: The Part of Tens 
 accadere, capitare, succedere 
(to happen to someone)
 bastare (to be sufficient to,
to be enough for someone, 
to suffice to someone)
 dispiacere (to be sorry about
[used for feelings and mental 
states rather than things])
 far(e) piacere (to please someone,
to be pleasing to someone)
 far(e) dispiacere (to displease 
someone)
 importare (to matter to someone)
 interessare (to be interested in, 
to interest someone)
 mancare (to lack, to miss)
 parere, sembrare (to appear to 
someone, to seem to someone)
You can use these verbs in two ways: You can turn the person who’s the subject into
the receiver of the action; or you can use the verb with the person or thing perform-
ing the action as the subject. Beware that the two constructions aren’t interchange-
able and that you’ll be saying two different things. Consider these examples: Non mi
interessa se tu vieni o no (I don’t care whether you’re coming or not), and I problemi
di Paolo non interessano a nessuno (Paolo’s problems don’t matter to anyone).

Some Verbs Can’t Live Without Pronouns
The following widely used verbs are completely idiomatic in the sense that you can’t
make out their meanings by understanding the meanings of their components. Each
of these verbs adds both a reflexive pronoun matched to the person who’s perform-
ing the action (expressed in the infinitive with si, which becomes se to ease pronunci-
ation) and another pronoun, at times ne (of this, of that, from this/that place) and at
times la (this thing, this situation). Neither of these pronouns points to something real;
they solely play an idiomatic function.
 andarsene (to go away, to leave): È tardi. Me ne vado a casa. (It’s late. I’ll go
home.)
 cavarsela (to make it): La tormenta ci ha sorpreso, ma ce la siamo cavata. (The
snowstorm was suddenly upon us, but we made it.)
 farcela (to be able to make it): Non preoccuparti della valigia, ce la faccio da
sola. (Don’t worry about the suitcase, I can carry it by myself.)
 tornarsene (to come back, to return from, to go back): È meglio che ce ne torni-
amo a casa. (It’s better to go home.)
 vedersela (to see to it oneself): Ma le vedo io per le tasse. (I’ll see to the taxes
myself.)
 venirsene (to come, to walk): Se ne veniva piano piano. (He was walking slowly.)
Fare Is the Jack of All Trades
The verb fare is as common in Italian as to do or to make is in English. It means both
to do and to make, and colloquially (and a bit lazily), it replaces a lot of other verbs.
For example, fare da mangiare (to make food) is the same as cucinare (to cook); fare
una festa (to make a party) is the same as dare una festa (to give a party); and so on.
You also use the verb fare followed by an infinitive to convey the expressions to have
something done, to get something done, to cause something to happen, to make some-
thing happen. You can use it to express two different ideas:
 You have something done on your behalf: Faccio pitturare la casa. (I’ll have the
house painted.)
 Someone has caused something to happen: Il gatto ha fatto cadere il vaso. (The
cat made the vase fall.)
You can even use fare followed by fare, as in Faccio fare il pacco (I’ll have them make
the package). And you can use it reflexively: Farsi fare qualcosa means to have some-
thing done to/for oneself. For example, Mi faccio tagliare i capelli (I’ll have my hair cut).
Fare is a transitive verb which takes avere (to have) as its auxiliary in compound
tenses. But when it’s used reflexively, as farsi, it needs the auxiliary essere (to be).
269
Chapter 18: Ten Facts to Remember about Italian Grammar

da + Verb = Four Possible Meanings
You use da (from, by) followed by an infinitive to say that something is to be done or
can be done, with four different nuances.
 Something is available for us to do: “Hai dei libri da leggere?” “Ne ho troppi!”
(“Do you have any books to read?” “I have too many!”)
 Something must be done: Il professore ci ha dato da leggere tre libri. (The pro-
fessor assigned three books to read.)
 Something needs to be done: La mia automobile è da lavare. (My car needs
washing.)
 Something is worth doing: È un posto da vedere. (It’s a place worth seeing.)
Convey the Passive Voice 
in More than One Way
You can say that things have been done by someone using verbs other than essere (to
be). Unlike essere, which conveys a static condition, these verbs convey motion and
are helpful when you wish to emphasize the process that has led to a certain result.
Their use is governed by idiomatic patterns rather than rules, which you’ll pick up by
reading or listening to native speakers. For example, you may say Il lavoro andrà
finito entro domani (The job will have to be finished by tomorrow) but not Sono
rimasta assunta (I remained hired). You conjugate the verb that functions as the auxil-
iary just as you would conjugate the verb essere, and you add the past participle of
the main verb. In the case of venire and andare, you can say vengono/vanno fatte
(they must be done, they are done), but not sono venute fatte (literally, they have come
done). Here are the alternatives to essere:
 venire (to come) can mean to be or to get: You can only use venire in the simple
tenses of the active voice, as in Le porte vengono chiuse (The doors are
being/closed).
 andare (to go) can mean to get: It’s used only in the third-person singular or
plural, as in La casa andò distrutta (The house was destroyed). It also can mean
to have to, or must; you can use it with the subject in any person, as in Le tasse
vanno pagate subito (The taxes have to be paid at once).
 rimanere (to remain) can mean to get: You use it to emphasize the consequences
of an event, as in Il conducente è rimasto bloccato sull’autostrada (The driver
was stuck in traffic on the highway).
You convey constructions such as I was told or We were reminded by using essere or
venire impersonally, in the third-person singular:
 essere (to be) in the present perfect + past participle of the main verb: È stato
detto loro di parlare col medico. (They were told to talk to their physician.)
 venire (to be, to get) in the present indicative or other simple tense followed by
the past participle of the main verb: Le verrà consigliato di cambiare lavoro.
(She’ll be advised to look for another job.)

Convey Strong Emotion with 
Exclamatory Words
When you feel something strongly, you can use several different short phrases that
convey your emotion and draw the listener’s attention to it. Here’s a rundown of your
options:
 Che! (What!, What a!): Followed by an adjective or a noun, without any article:
Che disgrazia! (What a terrible accident!)
Che bei bambini! (What beautiful children!)
 Come! (How!): Followed by a verb with the subject placed after it: Com’è
pesante quella valigia! (How heavy that suitcase is!)
 Quanto! (How much!, How many!): Matched in gender and number to the noun
that follows. You also can use quanto as an indefinite pronoun (see Chapter 7).
In this case, you can use it with a noun; or you can add any verb conveying quan-
tity, or the verb essere (to be) and an adjective. The verb and the adjective are
matched to the subject of the sentence (at times expressed and at times con-
veyed by the verb):
Quanta gente! (So many people!)
Quanto hai speso! (You spent so much!)
Quanto sono stati gentili! (How kind they were!)
 Ecco! (Here/There he/she/they is/are!): Used if someone you’ve been waiting for
has finally arrived, or if you want to draw someone’s attention to something. If
you use a pronoun to refer to that person, you attach it to Ecco:
“Dov’è Maria?” “Eccola!” (“Where is Maria?” “Here/There she is!”)
“Hai visto i miei occhiali?” “Eccoli!” (“Have you seen my glasses?”
“Here/There they are!”)
Lasciare Grants (Or Requests) Permission
Your daughter wants to go to a sleepover, and you give her permission by telling her,
I’ll let you go, but you need to finish your homework first. In Italian, you use the verb las-
ciare followed by a verb in the infinitive to grant or request permission, as in Ti lascio
andare ma prima devi finire i compiti.
If you use a pronoun to express the person to whom you’re giving permission, you
have two options for constructing your sentences:
 If the person is the only direct object in the sentence, you use the direct object
pronouns, usually in their weak form, placed before the verbal form, as in La
lascia andare al centro commerciale? (Will you let her go to the superstore?).
271
Chapter 18: Ten Facts to Remember about Italian Grammar

 If you have both a person to whom you’re giving permission and a direct
object, you represent the person with an indirect object pronoun. If you use a
double pronoun, you represent the person with an indirect object pronoun and
the thing you’re letting her do with a direct object pronoun. For example, Lascio
che Mario ascolti il CD! →Glielo lascio ascoltare (I let him listen to the CD).
(Turn to Chapter 4 for more on pronouns.)
You place pronouns before the verbal form lasciare + infinitive, or attached to las-
ciare when it’s in the infinitive, the imperative, or the gerund (see Chapter 9).
When you use lasciare followed by a sentence introduced by che, you need the verb
in the subjunctive, as in Hanno lasciato che lui passasse per primo (They let him go
first). (Chapters 15 and 16 cover the subjunctive and use of che.)
If You Want Someone to Agree 
with You, Add Non è vero?
You may want to make sure that you understand what someone just told you, or you
may want someone to agree to what you just said. In English, you take the auxiliary of
the verb (or the verb to do if there’s no auxiliary) and add a question to the end. In
Italian, you always use È vero (Is it true?) or Non è vero? (Isn’t it true?) regardless of
whether you’re using an auxiliary and which one it is. For example, Possiamo andare
tutti con la tua macchina, non è vero? (We can all go with your car, can’t we?).

Ten Subtle Verb Distinctions
In This Chapter
 Understanding slight differences in verb meanings
 Choosing the right verbs for specific actions
T
he meanings of some Italian verbs have very subtle but very important differ-
ences even though their English translations are nearly identical. In this chapter, I
cover the most common nuances between ten pairs of verbs, clarifying the range of
meanings that each verb lays claim to.
Abitare (To Live, To Reside) versus 
Vivere (To Live, To Reside)
You use abitare (to live, to reside) to talk about your address, as in Abito in Italia, a
Milano, in Via Sarpi 18 (I live in Italy, in Milan, at 18 Via Sarpi). You also can say Vivo
in Italia, a Milano (I live in Italy, in Milan). But even though everyone would under-
stand you, you’re less likely to say, Vivo in Via Sarpi (I live on Via Sarpi). Vivere con-
veys more than just having a dwelling: It refers to your entire life, which is likely to
have a larger context. Vivere, therefore, refers to one’s life, not just to one’s resi-
dence; for example, you may say, Ha vissuto a lungo (He had a long life).
When speaking of a residence, you also can use stare (to reside); for example, “Dove
stai?” “Sto in Via Sarpi.” (“Where do you live? What is your address?” “I live on Via
Sarpi.”).
Andare (To Go) versus Partire (To Leave)
Andare describes the action of going to the movies, the office, the moon, and so on,
or the action of going from one place to another, like from room to room, or from city
to city. When using andare, you add da (from) to the place you’re leaving and a, in, or
su to the place you’re going to. For example, Andiamo da Roma a Napoli (We’re going
from Rome to Naples).

Partire describes going on a trip, but it points to the organizational and physical
activities required to reach your destination. You can say: Parto per Shanghai (I’m
leaving for Shanghai) or Parto per le vacanze (I’m leaving for my vacation), both of
which mean I’ve loaded my car, I’ve got my maps, my tank is full of gas, and so on. You
add da if you mention where you’re leaving from, and add per to your destination. But
you don’t use partire and say, Parto per l’ufficio (I’m leaving for the office), even if
you have an hour-long commute. Instead, you say, Vado in ufficio (I’m going to the
office). And if you’re going on vacation and you wish to emphasize that instead of
working you’ll be having fun, you say Vado in vacanza (I’m going on vacation).
Sapere (To Know) versus Conoscere 
(To Be Acquainted With)
Sapere conveys knowledge, whereas conoscere means to be acquainted with, be aware
of, to recognize. So, you say, Sai a che ora parte il treno? (Do you know what time the
train leaves?) but, Conosci mia sorella? (Do you know my sister?). The Socratic injunc-
tion Know thyself! therefore translates to Conosci te stesso!
Fare (To Do) versus Essere (To Be)
You can use fare to talk about people’s jobs, as in Laura fa il medico (Laura is a physi-
cian). You use it especially when you ask questions such as Che cosa fai? Che lavoro
fai? (What do you do? What’s your job?). You also can use the verb essere (to be),
saying Ida è avvocato (Ida is a lawyer). But with the verb essere, you imply that a
person’s profession defines his or her identity. When the role you play becomes your
identity, you use essere instead of fare. For example, you don’t say Ratzinger fa il
papa (Ratzinger is a Pope), but rather Ratzinger è il papa (Ratzinger is the Pope).
Essere (To Be) versus Stare (To Stay)
You use essere to express situations that last over time and indicate not just physical
being but also emotions and feelings; for example, Sei contenta? (Are you happy?). As
I explain in the preceding section, essere has to do with identity, as in È una donna
coraggiosa (She’s a courageous woman). However, when it comes to talking about how
you are, you use stare. For example, Stai bene? (Are you all right?) may regard your
health or your feelings. Americans use the set phrase How are you? (Come stai?,
Come sta?) as a form of salutation, to which people answer rhetorically I’m fine, usu-
ally regardless of how they actually feel. In Italy, if you ask Come stai?, you’re likely to
get a report on the person’s health and state of mind. Use Buon giorno (Good morn-
ing) or Buona sera (Good evening) when meeting someone and Ciao (hello) only with
people you address informally.
274
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Suonare (To Play an Instrument) versus
Giocare (To Play a Game or a Sport)
If you’re referring to playing an instrument, you use suonare (to play). For example, if
you’re a pianist, you say Suono il piano (I play the piano). If you’re engaged in a game
or a sport, you use giocare (to play) and say Gioco a tennis (I play tennis) or Gioco a
bridge (I play bridge), for example, adding a to the game or sport you’re playing. You
also can add a direct object with giocare in order to be more specific, like Hanno gio-
cato tre partite a/di calcio (They played three soccer matches). Giocare/giocarsi also
means to gamble, as in Ha giocato tutti i suoi soldi a baccarat (He gambled all his
money at baccarat).
Partire (To Leave) versus Uscire (To Go
Out) or Lasciare (To Leave)
Because partire means to go on a trip, you don’t say Parto dalla stanza (I’m leaving
the room), but rather Esco dalla stanza (I’m walking out of the room), Lascio la stanza
(I’m leaving the room), or Io ho lasciato il telefonino a casa (I left my cellphone at
home). But uscire points only to physical motion, whereas lasciare can imply your
reasons for leaving. For example, you use lasciare to explain why you’re walking out
of the room: A che ora dobbiamo lasciare la camera? (What time do we have to be
out of the room?). However, you can also use uscire metaphorically, meaning to go out
with or to date: Escono insieme da tre mesi (They’ve been dating for three months).
Prendere (To Take, To Have) versus Bere
(To Drink) or Mangiare (To Eat)
Instead of saying that you’re drinking a beverage or eating a hamburger, you may want
to say that you’re having them, like I’m having a hamburger. You can use prendere (to
have) to order food or to convey that you’re deciding what to eat or drink, whereas
with bere (to drink) or mangiare (to eat) you point to physical activities. For example,
Non prendo il caffè dopo cena (I don’t have coffee after dinner).
Potere (Can, May) Versus Riuscire 
(Can, To Be Able To)
In English, you use can to express power and ability, including success, and may to
convey permission. In Italian, you use potere to convey power and permission, and
riuscire to convey success. See the difference in these examples: Posso fumare qui?
(May I smoke here?); Non sono riuscita a finire il lavoro in tempo (I wasn’t able to
finish the assignment on time).
275
Chapter 19: Ten Subtle Verb Distinctions

Udire/Sentire (To Hear) versus 
Ascoltare (To Listen To)
The distinction between the verbs udire or sentire (to hear) and ascoltare (to listen
to) parallels the distinction in English. To hear means that you’re exposed to sounds,
whether you like it or not, and udire is used more often in literature. To listen to
means that you’ve decided to pay attention to those sounds. For example, you say Ho
sentito il campanello (I heard the bell ring), but Ascolto la sinfonia “Dal nuovo
mondo” (I’m listening to the symphony “From the New World”).

Appendixes

In this part . . .
T
he appendixes in this part are helpful quick-reference
resources. For regular and irregular conjugations of
the most important simple tenses of verbs, head to
Appendix A. You may find it helpful to see all the possible
verb variations and similarities in one place. Appendixes B
and C are dictionaries to provide fast and easy support
when you’re stumped, although they can’t replace full and
complete Italian dictionaries. (One suggestion when it
comes to dictionaries: Try to use a monolingual dictionary
as much as possible and a bilingual one only as support.)

Appendix A
Verb Charts
T
hese charts summarize regular conjugations patterns and provide full lists of
irregular conjugations for commonly used verbs in the most important simple
tenses. Then I list conjugations of irregular verbs. I conjugate the verb only in its
irregular moods and tenses, except for essere (which is almost completely irregular)
and avere, because you really need all their forms at your fingertips. When you look
at the irregular verb and don’t find a tense listed, you can assume that particular verb
is regular in that tense, even though it’s irregular in many others. Fare (to do, to make)
is a good example of one of these quirky verbs.
Here are some suggestions to help you use the charts. I list a verb that “establishes” 
a pattern of irregularity (so to speak), for example dipingere (to paint). I bold the 
letters that you’ll have to drop when the verb takes irregular forms. Then I give you
those irregular forms. So you find io dipinsi (I painted). When I tell you that another
verb, let’s say piangere (to weep), behaves like dipingere, I mean that in the same
moods and tenses, piangere drops the same letters that dipingere does and takes the
same suffixes: io piansi (I wept.) This setup also gives you a nice way to practice your
conjugations and memorize them.
Note: In this appendix, I list conjugations in the order of the six persons to which 
correspond six forms of the verb: io (I), tu (you), lui (he) which also stands for lei,
esso, essa (she, it), noi (we), voi (you), and loro (they) which also stands for essi, 
esse (they).
