Nano

Nano is a simple text editor that we can access right
from the terminal.  It's far more accessible than other
popular command-line editors like vim and emacs.
Nano includes all the basic text editing functionality
you would expect: search, spellcheck, syntax
highlighting, etc.
Nano

To open up a file using nano, run nano FILE.   For
example, to open up the file book.txt using nano, we
would run nano book.txt
We can also use the same command to edit a file that
doesn't yet exist (we can then save it and create the
file). 
Nano
nano FILE
❯

We can also provide nano with a specific line number
to position the cursor at using nano +LINE FILE.
To open up the book.txt file at line 205, we would run
nano +205 book.txt
Edit At A
Specific Line
nano +LINE FILE
❯

Some editors like vim require us to enter "write mode"
before we can start editing a file, but with nano we can
make changes right away.
We can move the cursor using the arrow keys.  
At the very bottom, we'll see a list of shortcuts that we
can use inside of nano. These are super useful!
Editing With Nano

To save, we need to "write out" using the Ctrl+O
command.  Then, nano will prompt us to enter the
filename we want use (just hit enter to keep the
original name).
Saving

To exit, use ctrl + X
Exiting

Use ctrl-W and then enter a search phrase
to search FORWARD in the file from your
current cursor location.
Searching

To search and replace, use ctrl+\ and then
enter the word you want to replace.  Then
enter the replacement and decide whether
to replace specific matches or all matches.
Replacing

We can use spellchecking inside of Nano, but
we have to enable it first in the Nano config
file located at /etc/nanorc
