Tuan 
Nguyen
If I had to pIck a good tIme to build a 
computer system, today is likely better 
than any day in the past 10 years. That’s 
not to say that things haven’t been 
exciting in the last decade—sure, we’ve 
gotten lots of products. But what makes 
today special is the fact that I believe 
AMD and Intel are on a path to collide.
Intel has had many missteps over 
the last few years. It may not seem that 
way if you’re only looking at the desktop 
space, but in other tech areas, Intel has 
lost to other companies. Qualcomm sits 
comfortably on its mobile chip throne, 
and Nvidia is making great strides in 
AI and big computing. For such a giant 
company as Intel, it’s a painful reminder 
that staying at the top is harder than 
getting there.
AMD hasn’t been idly watching all 
these years. For the value-end market, 
Intel left a big hole, where AMD has 
successfully gnawed away piece by 
piece. As of today, the respective focuses 
of Intel and AMD on the desktop space 
are changing places: Intel wants to get 
at the value market, while AMD wants to 
tackle the high-end straight on.
Take Intel’s new Core i9 desktop 
chip, for example: It’s the first new 
line of CPUs from Intel in years, and 
one that’s not entirely based on a new 
architecture. Think Core i7 Extreme 
Edition 
repackaged, 
renamed, 
and 
repositioned as a response to AMD’s 
Ryzen 9 processor. This, to me, is 
profound, because the last time AMD 
provoked such an obvious response from 
Intel was with the original Athlon.
Our benchmarks show that Ryzen can 
dance with the best that Intel has to offer, 
and deliver that kind of performance at 
a much lower price point. Sure, there 
are cases where Ryzen will be slower 
in benchmarks than the equivalent Core 
CPU from Intel, but the two companies 
trade punches on an even level. The 
fact that Intel is rebranding an Extreme 
Edition processor to even the playing field 
with AMD is significant by any measure.
So, why is now the best time to be a 
builder? Choices. Real choices. I can go 
out there and confidently put my money 
down on an AMD system, and not have to 
think twice about performance issues. 
What I do have to look at, though, is full 
support from motherboard companies. 
I want my Ryzen motherboard to deliver 
the same feature set as any top-end Intel 
part, and manufacturers can take that as 
a call to action.
So, here’s what I’d recommend for 
AMD: Go ahead and chase after the high-
end market. But whatever you do, don’t 
ignore the real estate you’ve carved out 
for yourself in the value segment. Learn 
from your rival’s mistakes.
And here’s what I recommend for the 
PC builder: Go ahead and vote with your 
wallet. I don’t have to point you in any 
direction. You’ll get a winning system 
from either camp.

Microsoft’s new cut-down OS debuts on Surface Laptop
Windows S Takes  
on Chrome OS
it doesn’t stand for anything, 
but the blurb repeatedly states 
that Windows S is streamlined 
for 
security 
and 
superior 
performance. Student and store 
are more apt. “Streamlined” 
is, of course, another word for 
simplified. It’s designed to be 
simple to use, employ cloud-
based file storage, run on more 
basic levels of hardware, and 
have low power consumption. 
Essentially the same territory 
as Chrome. It looks and feels 
like Windows 10, but all your 
applications come from the 
Windows Store. 
To get on to the Windows 
Store, applications have to be 
written for the UWP, Universal 
Windows Platform. These tend 
to be more limited versions of 
software, because they can’t 
spread themselves over your 
system, modify system files 
without permission, launch 
automatically, and so on. So, 
you get Office 365, not the 
full-fat Office 2016, Photoshop 
Express, not Photoshop, and so 
forth. Windows S can run any 
browser, in theory, but for now 
it just has Microsoft Edge. 
Developers 
can 
bundle 
their Windows applications 
into a secure container for the 
Windows Store, but uptake has 
been slow. Giving Microsoft a 
cut of the revenue has been one 
stumbling point. At least using 
UWP means that security is 
tight, and your system shouldn’t 
bloat and get sluggish, which 
is the curse of a “regular” 
Windows installation.
We’ve been here before, of 
course. Remember Windows 
RT, also from 2011? This 
version of Windows 8 was 
built for ARM processors, and 
was also limited to approved 
Windows Store applications. It 
died rather quickly, and cost 
Microsoft millions. 
The first hardware to run 
Windows S is the new Surface 
Laptop, 
although 
you 
can 
upgrade to Win 10 Pro for free 
before the end of the year, or 
pay $49 after that. This sleek, 
lightweight machine has a 
13.5-inch touchscreen with 
2256x1504 display. Connectivity 
isn’t extensive—basically, a 
USB 3.0 port, headphones jack, 
and a mini DisplayPort. It is 
a pretty straightforward laptop 
design, albeit a classy one in 
four colors. The fabric-covered 
keyboard is something of an 
oddity. The Alcantara material 
is coated, and should wipe 
clean, says Microsoft. 
Prices start at $999 for a 
Core i5, with 4GB of memory, 
and a 128GB SSD, and run 
to $2,199 for a Core i7, with 
16GB of memory, and 512GB of 
storage. If you want the rather 
fetching mouse that appears in 
many of the illustrations, it’s an 
extra $79. This is clearly not the 
kind of hardware Windows S 
was designed for. More suitable 
Windows S devices starting at 
$189 are due this summer from 
the usual hardware players.
It is unfair to be too critical 
before we’ve even sampled 
Windows S properly, but it’s 
obvious that we a have problem 
here. It’s called Windows, and 
that brings the expectation that 
you can run Windows software. 
The 
Windows 
Store 
has 
improved, but it still offers only 
a small subset of the software 
out there, and lacks many 
popular and powerful packages. 
A Windows S machine can leave 
you feeling like you’re stuck in a 
tiny sandbox in the middle of an 
amusement park. 
Microsoft 
has 
made 
numerous attempts to move 
its OS on to smaller, more 
mobile devices, and none have 
succeeded. Windows S goes 
against a popular and well-
proven OS with a huge installed 
user base. It is going to be a 
tough sell. –CL
Be honest now, did you think 
Google’s Chrome OS would 
be a success when it arrived 
in 2011? A Linux-based OS 
designed around a browser, a 
bit too taxing for phones, and 
too limited on laptops. Even 
so, second–gen Chromebooks 
achieved decent sales, and now 
it’s a success in one large and 
important sector of the market: 
education. 
Students 
have 
flocked to cheap and cheerful 
$200 Chromebooks.
Microsoft has cooked up a 
response with Windows S. What 
is the “S” for? Well, officially 
Although designed 
for far simpler 
devices, 
the new 
Surface 
Laptop 
will be the 
first with Win S, 
but you can, 
and probably 
should, upgrade 
to Win 10 for free.

Tech Triumphs and Tragedies
on may 12, WannaCry infected around 200,000 
machines in the largest ransomware attack to date. 
Through a vulnerability in the Server Message Block, 
WannaCry sent a worm through infected systems, scrambling files, before 
demanding $300 in Bitcoins. It used two vulnerabilities, EternalBlue and 
DoublePulsar, which had been stolen from the National Security Agency. Win 7 
PCs without the latest patch (issued on March 14) took 98 percent of the hits. 
Once the panic died down, the end results proved mundane. Under $100,000 
in Bitcoin was paid out. A nebulous group of hackers, the Lazarus Group, with 
probable links to North Korea, had been cited as a possible culprit, although 
only through similarities in the code. What did we learn? Well, as Microsoft’s 
president, Brad Smith, points out, the NSA needs to take some responsibility 
here. It finds, researches, and develops hacking tools, many of which it then 
stockpiles. He equates the loss of the exploits from the NSA to the US Army 
having some of its Tomahawk missiles stolen. He has a point. –cl

google’s ForThcoming daydream 2.0 will include a full stand-alone headset—no phone,

working with two wide-angle cameras, which use your physical surroundings as reference 
points. Google promises “robust low-latency tracking for games.” 
The headset runs Android O. You can take snapshots and videos as you go, as well as 
Chromecast to a compatible screen, so friends can see what made you squeal. Chrome 
VR adds 3D browsing, and YouTube VR brings shared “rooms” for your real virtual friends. 
A reference design that uses a Snapdragon 835 chip is being developed with Qualcomm. 
HTC, Vive, and Lenovo are working on retail headsets, which should be here “within months.” 
It all sounds rather neat. VR is struggling to get beyond the curious and the hardcore gamer;

VR With NothiNg Added
since The launch of Ryzen, we’ve seen 
a hectic round of new processors, and it 
shows no sign of slowing this year. Both Intel 
and AMD have new top-end silicon on the 
way, and both have turned things up to 9. 
As expected, Intel has brought forward its 
release schedule. A leaked internal slide is 
revealing (if you are serious about security, 
guys, you need to confiscate phones). There 
is a pair of four-core Kaby Lake-X chips, 
branded i7-7740K and i7-7640K, running 
at 4.3 and 4.0GHz. And four new Skylake-X 
chips move to the new Core i9 moniker: 
There’s a six-core i9-7800X, eight-core i9-
7820X, 10-core i9-7900X, and, at the top 
of the tree, a 12-core i9-7920X. Base clock 
speeds start at 3.3GHz and run to 3.6GHz. 
Boost speeds on all run at over 4.0GHz, up to 
4.5GHz Turbo 3.0 (single-core) on the 7920X. 
Yikes. All run on new LGA-2066 boards with 
X299 chipsets. We should have all the new 
Core i7s to play with by the time you read 
this. The Core i9s are expected in August. 
Meanwhile, AMD has its fancifully named 
Threadripper chips, the Ryzen 9. There are 
nine new versions in all. Base clock speeds 
are all fairly similar, running from 3.0 to 
3.7GHz, with a 400–600MHz or so of boost, 
depending on which “leak” you believe. 
As expected, it’s all about the cores—we 
get either 10 cores in the 1955 and 1955X, 
12 cores in the 1956, 1956X, and 1976, 14 
cores in the 1977 and 1977X, or a whopping 
16 cores in the 1998 and 1998X. All get 44 
PCIe lanes and quad-channel memory. 
Essentially, Ryzen 9 is two Ryzen 7 cores in 
one package. It’ll use a modified SP3 socket 
with 4,096 pins (whoa!), developed for AMD’s 
Naples server chips.
No pricing yet, but if things stay true 
to form, we can expect those juicy i9s 
to be expensive, and the Ryzen 9s to be 
competitive. Looks like the boys in the labs 
will have more heavy rounds of system 
testing to do very shortly. –cl

Tech Talk
Jarred Walton has been a  
PC and gaming enthusiast  
for over 30 years.
RIP IDF: The End of an Era
Reactions have ranged from the expected shock and 
disappointment, to an indifferent shrug. There are 
many reasons to ditch the yearly conference, and the 
last two IDFs have been weird hodgepodges of IoT and 
mobile talk that never seems to go anywhere, mixed 
in with a few presentations on new processors and 
fabrication technologies. As an example, two years 
ago, everyone at IDF got a Basis Peak smartwatch, 
which was later recalled due to overheating/burn 
problems that couldn’t be fixed. Oops.
But as IDF closes its doors, Nvidia’s yearly 
GPU Technology Conference (GTC) is becoming 
increasingly important. GPUs are outpacing the 
growth of other processors, and they happen to be 
extremely useful for one of the hottest research 
areas: machine learning and AI. SkyNet fearmongers 
will want to turn the page now, as there’s apparently 
no stopping the advance of our AI overlords.
Last GTC, Nvidia revealed its first Pascal GPU, 
the GP100. It remains the most powerful GPU 
on the planet, boasting up to 25 TFLOPS of FP16 
performance, with 16GB of HBM2 memory. Machine 
learning often distills down to doing massive 
amounts of matrix multiplication, a task for which 
GPUs are especially useful, and every major cloud 
service now offers VMs with Nvidia GPUs. Nearly 
every supercomputer in the Top500 list also includes 
GPUs, or similar technology, such as Xeon Phi.
This GTC, Nvidia unveiled its first Volta GPU, the 
GV100, a complete overhaul of previous designs. 
Nvidia has reworked the core layout, memory 
controllers, thread scheduling and execution, and 
After 20 yeArs, Intel has announced that it will no longer be holding its 
yearly Intel Developer Forum (IDF) conferences—both the San Francisco 
and Asia locations for 2017 have been axed. IDF has been one of the few 
constants for PC enthusiasts, and we’ve come to count on the regular 
updates and insights into Intel’s future roadmaps. 
other aspects of the design. The 
compute 
and 
machine 
learning 
focused 
GV100 
also 
includes a new 
Tensor Core type 
that supplements 
the existing CUDA 
cores. Expect even 
better performance 
per clock relative to 
Pascal, basically.
The 
GV100 
is 
a 
massive chip that is 
likely never to find its 
way into a consumer GeForce 
product—the same happened with 
GP100. The full GV100 chip has 84 
SMs with 64 CUDA cores each, giving 
it up to 5,376 CUDA cores, though 
four SMs are disabled on the Tesla 
V100, likely for yield considerations. 
That’s still 30 percent more than 
GP100; so at least 30 percent better 
performance. The chip is also 30 
percent larger, weighing in as the 
heavyweight champion of the GPU 
world. Another reason not to expect 
it to show up in consumer cards.
As for the new Tensor Core, it’s 
a more densely packed but slightly 
less flexible core that works on data 
in 4x4 matrices. Each Tensor Core 
can do fused multiply add (FMA) 
operations on FP16 4x4 matrices. 
There are eight Tensor Cores per 
SM, 80 SMs in the Tesla V100, and 
a peak clock speed of 1,455MHz 
means nearly 120 TFLOPS. Nvidia 
stated that on ResNet-50 training 
(a deep neural network), the V100 
is 2.4 times faster than the Tesla 
P100, and for ResNet-50 inference, 
it’s 3.7 times faster. And the P100 is 
already the fastest GPU around.
The increased core counts and 
features are possible thanks to 
a process shrink from 16nm to 
12nm. For other Volta products, 
Nvidia should be able to add more 
cores, and each one should be more 
efficient than a Pascal core. With 
GV100 now launched, consumer 
focused variations can’t be far off, 
and GV104 (aka GTX 1180/1170) may 
arrive sooner rather than later. So if 
you haven’t jumped on the GTX 1080 
Ti bandwagon, you might want to 
hold off upgrading until the fall.
The last two IDFs have been 
hodgepodges of IoT and mobile 
talk that never goes anywhere.
The Volta GV100 is the 
largest microprocessor 
ever manufactured, 
measuring 815mm2.

First off, there’s no big cosmetic change. Ubuntu still 
ships with and defaults to Unity 7. While 17.04 ships 
with a preview of Unity 8 (as 16.10 did in October), it is 
not the default desktop, and it still has a few quirks. 
There’s nothing wrong with that, but the shipment of 
Ubuntu 17.04 came days after Canonical announced 
it would be dropping the Unity project.
The impending doom of Unity came as a shock 
to those who grew to love Unity 8. It also means 
Canonical is dropping the goal of convergence—the 
idea that desktops and mobile devices should use 
one, seamless OS. After the death of Firefox OS, 
Ubuntu was the only viable open-source alternative 
to Android. Now it will never go mainstream.
Canonical has said that come April next year and 
the release of 18.04, Ubuntu will be shipping with the 
GNOME desktop. I know some people may not be big 
fans, but remember: Ubuntu shipped with GNOME 
before Unity was even developed. 
Now’s the time to start toying with other desktops. 
Ubuntu GNOME will become the new default, so 
installing that version of 17.04 will give you time 
to learn it. There have been lots of voices asking 
Ubuntu to ship with KDE’s Plasma, but Kubuntu 
(Ubuntu with KDE/Plasma) has long been an option. 
If you prefer the layout and functionality of 
Ubuntu from before Unity, Ubuntu MATE will offer 
a more “classic” experience. (MATE 
is a fork of the older GNOME 2.) Of 
course, as this is Linux we’re talking 
about, there’s nothing stopping 
you from installing all of these 
desktops on top of your existing 
Ubuntu installation. Most desktop 
managers 
(including 
Ubuntu’s) 
allow the user to select the desktop 
environment to use when they log 
in. If you feeling like using GNOME 
one day, but want to switch to KDE in 
the afternoon, you can do that.

Ubuntu 17.04 Sounds the 
Death Knell for Unity
A couple months Ago, Canonical released this year’s first new version of 
Ubuntu: 17.04. Like every release in the first half of the year, it landed in 
April, with a second release slated for October. After playing with the OS 
for a while, I think there’s a few things you should know if you’re looking 
to upgrade, or if this will be your first foray into the world of Ubuntu.
users, these are good reasons to 
go with 17.04 over the long-term 
support version 16.04, because 
16.04 ships with kernel 4.4. While 
you can install a 4.10 kernel in 
16.04, it is not officially supported 
by Canonical. 
I, for one, welcome Canonical’s 
decision to dump Unity. Sure, it sucks 
for fans of the desktop, but it shows 
a bit of maturity on Canonical’s 
part. Instead of spending time on 
a desktop environment that only it 
develops, Canonical is rejoining the 
community. And if MATE has taught 
us anything about desktops, it’s that 
fans of one system will continue 
development on their own so long as 
the source code is made available.
Ubuntu 17.04 still has Unity 7, but kernel 4.10 makes it worth upgrading.

BY jeremy laird
PC versus Mac. Mac versus PC. A debate that just won’t die. That comparative proposition 
used to be pretty straightforward. The PC was clunky but configurable, the Mac pretty but 
painfully restricted. Today, the divide isn’t so obvious. For starters, since Apple moved to Intel 
processors, it’s been possible to dual-boot Macs into Windows. Equally, Windows machines 
such as the Surface Studio aren’t just occupying similar creative territory as Macs, they’re 
doing some things better. Time to have another look at this classic confrontation.
Mac vs. PC
Being Creative
Tricky one. Apple has long styled itself 
as existing at the intersection between 
liberal arts and technology. Although 
that rings faintly ludicrous when you 
consider its puritanical policing of 
software in its app store, there’s no 
doubting that generations of content 
creators have favored Macs.
Exactly how much better or worse 
Macs are for creating content is quite 
a subjective subject. But many people 
certainly 
do 
prefer 
the 
software 
packages and GUI of Mac in a creative 
context. On the other hand, whenever 
performance is a critical part of the 
package, Macs fall behind. Apple’s Mac 
Pro workstation is staggering on with 
ancient hardware. In short, if you want 
to render in a hurry, choose a PC.
Macs also look rather old hat with 
the arrival of Microsoft’s Surface Studio, 
and its intriguing form factor and input 
solutions. It’s far more innovative as a 
content creation device than anything 
Apple has done for years—the touch 
bar on the latest MacBook Pros doesn’t 
come close. For that alone, the PC 
deserves a marginal victory. However, 
when the new Mac Pro arrives next year, 
it could be a very different story.
Winner:
PC by a hair
Playing Games
Of all the possible criteria, remits, and 
requirements, gaming provides the 
most unambiguous winner. It’s a nailed-
down, copper-bottomed certainty that 
the PC is the better choice. There are 
far more games for the PC, and where 
the same game is available on both 
platforms, it runs better on PC. The end.
Likewise, before anyone suggests 
using Boot Camp as a quick-change 
option for transforming a Mac into a 
gaming PC, that only works up to a 
point. That’s because of a Mac’s limited 
configurability. Trying sticking an Nvidia 
Titan X into a trashcan Mac Pro. Yeah, 
right. By contrast, the PC has a wealth 
of options in terms of components that 
enable you to max out your gaming 
performance at any given price point.
The possible exception to this may 
arrive with the upcoming new Mac Pro. 
Apple says the new model will major 
on configurability, so it’s just possible 
that we may finally have a desktop Mac 
with some reasonable upgrade chops. 
In that scenario, dual-booting a Mac into 
Windows via Boot Camp might make 
a decent part-time gaming rig. Until 
then, it’s PC all day long, and thrice on 
Sundays. See ya, Mac!
Winner:
PC by a mile
Going Mobile
What is the best laptop in the world? Quite 
often, the answer to that question has 
been some kind of MacBook. However, 
MacBooks needn’t be the absolute best 
in every category to remain relevant.
The MacBook line is certainly more 
up to date technologically than Apple’s 
tiring Mac Pro product, for instance. 
And when it comes to perceived quality, 
the best MacBooks are peerless. As 
a physical object, the crazy-thin 12-
inch MacBook is probably the single 
most gorgeous portable computer yet 
conceived. You tend to know what you 
are getting with Apple portable, too. 
You can usually assume that great build 
quality and good battery life are givens. 
Usually! With PC laptops, it’s often a 
bit of a gamble, especially if you are 
ordering online and sight unseen.
On the other hand, Apple boxes 
you in with a limited range of choices 
and configurations, a situation that is 
epitomized by the aforementioned 12-
inch MacBook and its single USB C port 
for everything. PCs can be had in all 
shapes, sizes, specifications, and prices. 
In the end, it all depends on your remit 
and the things you care about most. An 
honorable draw, then.

Keeping Safe
Cyber security is the bane of modern 
life. Even governments and major 
corporations regularly get hacked. 
For the average Joe, the safety and 
anonymity of numbers is probably the 
best protection. So, does it really matter 
which computing platform you choose?
In extremis, we concede the PC 
is probably the more vulnerable as 
an overall platform. That is simply a 
consequence of its ubiquity. It presents 
more live targets to the bad guys, 
so more of them are working on ways 
to compromise the PC than Macs. To 
put this in some kind of context, Apple 
lays claim to around 7 percent of new 
computer sales, against a backdrop of 
consistently selling less than the likes 
of Dell, HP, and Lenovo for years on end. 
However, in reality, many of the 
threats to your online persona are 
platform-agnostic. If a minor website 
you use is hacked, and leaks a password 
that also happens to be the key to your 
online banking, it hardly matters what 
computer you use. In other words, in 
terms of the choices you can make, it’s 
mostly down to how you manage your 
personal data, such as passwords, not 
what computer you pick.
Tie:
PC and Mac
Everyday Computing
Or to put it another way, what is the best 
overall combination of hardware and 
operating system? Macs certainly score 
in a number of areas. For starters, they 
present a more consistent face more of 
the time. Apple maintains closer control 
of both hardware and software, so you’re 
less likely to face minor glitches, be that 
in terms of stability or interface quirks—
when you can’t easily blame someone 
else’s hardware or the software, you just 
need to get everything working.
It’s also true that, when equipped 
with a high-DPI display rendering in so-
called “Retina” mode, the Mac has the 
PC beaten for the crispness of its fonts. 
They are gorgeous. Macs also integrate 
exceptionally smoothly with certain 
peripherals that have been designed for 
Mac (although that’s a bit of a double-
edged sword in the value department).
And yet MacOS is very much a walled 
garden compared to the huge expanse 
that is the Windows ecosystem. Windows 
remains a little rough around the edges, 
even Windows 10. But if you’re like us, 
and you want maximum power and 
configurability, as well as the broadest 
software and hardware compatibility, 
the PC has Mac comprehensively licked.
Winner:
PC
Scan the win-lose ratio and you might 
conclude that the PC has served the 
Mac with a brutal punishment beating. 
In practice, it’s much more finely 
balanced. Partly that’s because when 
Mac is at its best, we have no problem 
recognizing that it can be utterly 
delightful. It’s also worth remembering 
that Apple’s well implemented Boot 
Camp dual-booting utility means you 
can often have your MacOS cake and 
eat Windows at the same time.
Ultimately, however, so much of this 
comparison comes down to personal 
preference. 
For 
us, 
the 
power, 
flexibility, freedom, and configurability 
of the PC is what it’s all about. If you’re 
dead serious about getting things done 
your way, and not being held up or 
messed around by somebody else’s 
idea of what makes a good computing 
platform, PC wins hands down.
Where Mac makes sense for us is 
as a secondary system with a relatively 
narrow remit. Powerful desktop PC 
at home; a thin slice of tasty Apple 
portability on the move. Sounds good to 
us. But if there could only be one, there 
can only be one. And it’s the PC. 
And the
Winner Is…

Monitoring Heat
Hello, Doc. I own an Asus 
X99-Deluxe II motherboard. 
It includes a fan extension 
card with a trio of four-pin fan 
outputs, plus three thermistor 
cables that plug into the card.
Where would you suggest 
attaching those thermistors? 
And what type of adhesive 
would you recommend? 
–Jerry Franco, Jr
THE DOCTOR RESPONDS: 
Choose an electrically 
insulated surface, such as 
the back of a graphics card’s 
PCB. High-end boards have 
a bad habit of heating up due 
to voltage regulation circuitry 
on the other side. Readings 
from a thermistor may convey 
valuable data you’re not getting 
from a GPU diode reporting 
to your favorite overclocking 
utility. M.2-based SSDs are 
another good target for thermal 
monitoring. They often receive 
insufficient airflow, and can 
throttle performance beyond a 
defined temperature.
Asus suggests using 
electrical tape to attach 
the probes, so long as the 
temperatures you’re seeing are 
within spec for the adhesive.
Flight Sim Follow-Up
Hiya Doc, I saw the question 
from Gregg Anderson about 
WWII-themed flight sims. I’d 
like to recommend Digital 
Combat Simulator (DCS). It 
is by the same guys who did 
IL2, spanning everything 
from WWII to modern-day 
technology. You purchase 
each aircraft as an individual 
model that plugs into the main 
program, DCS World. Its WWII 
offerings include an excellent 
Spitfire, the Mustang, the Fw 
190, and the Bf 109. Eagle 
Dynamics just released a 
closed-alpha Normandy 
1944 map to backers, but it 
should provide a playground 
for these modules when it’s 
available to everyone. There’s 
also a module pack of AI 
bombers and ground vehicles 
for mission building, and a 
great online multiplayer and 
discussion community.
The prices are steeper 
than IL2, but the modules 
are gorgeous and have very 
realistic flight dynamics. It 
is also Rift/Vive-compatible, 
and the immersion in VR is 
phenomenal.  
–Kelly Catton
THE DOCTOR RESPONDS: Thank 
you for the recommendation, 
Kelly. ED’s Normandy 1944 map 
hit alpha after the Doc’s original 
response, so that should make 
a great addition to the list once 
it launches more broadly.
It’s especially exciting to 
see concerted effort going 
into VR support. Between the 
available hands-on throttle 
and stick options and clickable 
cockpits, you’re looking at 
unprecedented immersion 
from a hyper-realistic sim.
Reading CPU Temps
Hey Doc, I recently built a nice 
little gaming system using an 
AMD Athlon X4 860K, Biostar’s 
Hi-Fi A70U3P mobo, 8GB of 
DDR3 memory, a Radeon HD 
4670 1GB, and Windows Vista 
Home Premium SP2.
Everything is running at 
stock settings, but according 
to Speccy, my CPU hits well 
over 90 C playing an older 
Company of Heroes game, and 
it regularly sits around 70 C 
at idle. I’ve checked my cooler 
to ensure it’s making contact. 
I also dug into my BIOS to 
ramp up the CPU fan settings. 
The four-pin option seems to 
make this problem worse, so I 
disabled it, and forced the fan 
to run at maximum speed. Is 
this my only solution?
Secondly, I did buy an ROG 
Strix RX 470 4GB and was 
drooling at the chance to 
unleash it in newer games, 
but it looks like I’m unable to 
install the drivers on an old 
OS—Vista reverts back to the 
standard VGA driver. Is there 
a workaround? 
–Neo Lithic
THE DOCTOR RESPONDS: 
It sounds like Speccy is 
incorrectly reading AMD’s 
TCTL—the CPU temperature 
relative to its maximum 
operating temperature. You’ll 
also see this referred to as 
thermal margin.
How can the Doc tell your 
readings are wrong? Well, 
the Athlon X4 860K shouldn’t

get much hotter than 70 C 
under load, much less at idle. 
The CPU’s built-in protection 
features intervene as its 
temperature approaches that 
ceiling, forcing the processor 
to a lower power state. 
Performance increases once 
there’s enough thermal margin 
to bring frequency back up.
Get around those erroneous 
readings by using AMD’s 
OverDrive utility for reporting 
available margin under load. 
It’s free, and also gives you 
access to overclocking controls, 
fan speed settings, and its own 
stability tests.
As for your second question, 
the newest cards that AMD 
supports under Vista come 
from its Radeon R9 200 and R7 
200 families. You’d need to track 
down a used Radeon R9 290 for 
performance that comes close 
to the RX 470. But the Doc would 
rather see you upgrade to a 
newer OS. After all, AMD hasn’t 
updated its Vista drivers since 
2013, so newer games won’t be 
optimized (if they run at all).
PSU Problems
Doc, I built a nice rig late 
last year and have now gone 
through two EVGA SuperNOVA 
1,200W P2 power supplies.
This is the second PC 
I’ve built from scratch, so I 
substituted in the original 
system’s EVGA 500W Bronze 
power supply, which seemed 
to chug along just fine while I 
waited for warranty returns.
Is something fishy here, or 
am I just unlucky? I did end 
up having to replace that first 
PC’s power supply (a Cooler 
Master) after about five years.
My configuration includes 
an Intel Core i7-6700K at 
stock, a Cooler Master Hyper 
212 EVO, Asus’s Maximus 
Extreme VIII Extreme/
Assembly, an Asus GeForce 
GTX 1070, 32GB of G.Skill 
DDR-3000, a 512GB Samsung 
950 Pro, and a WD 3TB Red 
hard drive with Win 10 Home.
EVGA has been good to 
work with, so I don’t need the 
Watchdog; I’d just like some 
advice on where to look for the 
gremlin causing my issues.
–Todd Bakken
THE DOCTOR RESPONDS: Power 
supplies fail for a number of 
reasons. Their fans go out, 
capacitors leak, MOSFETs 
overheat, and protection 
features can be misconfigured 
by the manufacturer. EVGA’s 
1,200W 80 PLUS Platinum-
rated SuperNOVA is well 
regarded, though. The company 
is even confident enough to give 
it a 10-year warranty.
Although it’s overkill for 
your hardware, that 1,200W 
SuperNOVA is equipped with 
a suite of features designed to 
protect it and the components 
behind it against problems with 
your mains power. Still, the Doc 
likes to keep his systems behind 
uninterruptible power supplies. 
Not only do they help ensure 
your PSU gets clean power, 
but they also kick in under 
circumstances that would 
normally force your PSU to shut 
down, potentially causing data 
loss. If you don’t have a UPS, 
now’s a good time to add one.
Optimizing a Beast
Hi Doc, I started reading 
Maximum PC in an effort to 
determine what would work 
best for Photoshop and some 
video editing. I’m not a gamer, 
so wanted a build that would 
kick ass without much or any 
overclocking. Though I started 
with something simple, I 
ended up going all-out.
The specs include an Asus 
X99 Deluxe II motherboard, 
an Intel Core i7-6950X CPU, 
128GB of Corsair Dominator 
DDR4 at 2,666MT/s, a GeForce 
GTX 1080, a Corsair RM1000i 
PSU, an Obsidian 750D case, 
four 1TB Samsung 850 EVOs in 
RAID 0, a 2TB Intel DC P3500 
SSD, backup via external 
drives, and Adobe CC.
I have Win 10 on the Intel 
SSD, along with my apps and 
images. It’s 25 percent full. 
The SATA drives store photos 
and videos I want to access 
quickly. But I’m wondering if 
this setup is optimal? 
Following Adobe’s guide to 
troubleshooting Photoshop 
GPU and driver issues, I went 
to the Nvidia control panel and 
added Photoshop and sniffer.
exe. I already told the software 
it could use a big chunk of 
RAM. Is there more I can do to 
optimize for Photoshop?
I also have a problem when 
I tell the machine to sleep and 
later wake it back up. The fans 
start spinning, lights flash, 
and the PC appears to be 
active, but the monitors don’t 
come back on, regardless of 
whether I use DisplayPort, 
HDMI, or DVI. I have to reset 
the machine to turn it back 
on. Sometimes, not always, 
there’s an error message.
I am considering switching 
back to Windows 7. Will my 
hardware/software handle the 
roll-back? –Dominick Marino
THE DOCTOR RESPONDS: All-
out, indeed. That’s a monster.
As far as your storage 
subsystem goes, RAID 0 is 
great for creating large pools 
of fast data. But four 1TB SSDs 
harnessed together multiply 
your chance of loss. Should 
one drive fail, the array breaks, 
taking your photos and videos 
out,too. This has happened to 
the Doc. It is not fun.
Your SSD DC P3500 reads 
at almost 3GB/s and writes at 
nearly 2GB/s. Use that huge 
performance to its potential. 
Windows, apps, and hot data 
can all live there without fear 
of slow-down. Configuring the 
Samsung drives in RAID 10, 
creating a stripe of mirrors, 
gives the array resiliency, 
keeping your photos and videos 
safe, while maintaining its high 
throughput and low latency. 
Sure, you give up capacity, but 
that Asus mobo has plenty more 
room for U.2, M.2, SATA 6Gb/s, 
and add-in card expansion.
There should be no reason 
to mess with Photoshop in 
Nvidia’s drivers—that’s a 
troubleshooting step for 
systems with multiple GPUs. 
On the Doc’s machine, under 
“Preferences > Performance,” 
Photoshop is set to “Use 
Graphics Processor.” Under 
“Advanced Settings,” Drawing 
Mode is set to “Advanced,” 
and all the checkboxes (except 
“30-Bit Display”) are selected.
The other bugs you’re 
experiencing may be 
knocked out by a combination 
of grabbing the latest 
motherboard BIOS version, SSD 
DC P3500 firmware, graphics 
drivers, and Windows Update 
packages. If worst comes 
to worst, right-click on the 
“Windows” button, choose 
“Power Options,” then select 
“Never” in the “Sleep” menu. 
A combination of top-end processing, graphics, memory, and 
storage make this machine a monster.

bunkers, and the video-editing powerhouses that these processors 
are truly designed to shine.
This all caused something of an argument in the office. So, to stop 
the squabble, our editor-in-chief told us to get a hold of ourselves, 
and to settle the debate in true Maximum PC fashion. A build-off, 
to the death…. One side Intel, one side AMD. No budget constraints, 
no fluff, just a pure, fair, and balanced battle between processor, 
chipset, and GPU type, to decide, once and for all, which platform is 
the better workstation standard.
So, then, the rules: Storage would be the same for each system, 
but we’d have free rein over the choice of processor, memory, 
motherboard, GPU, and cooling—and, of course, we’d have full access 
to any system and OS tinkering we wanted, including overclocking 
and memory frequency. Then, with both builds completed, it was 
time to benchmark the mighty beasts to settle the quarrel, and put

ASSeSSInG The PeRfORMAnCe of 
a workstation for CAD applications 
isn’t easy, mainly because real 
workloads vary so wildly. Even when 
handling the same models and data, 
what you’re doing can be just as 
important as what you’re working 
with. While you may be CPU-
bottlenecked on some tasks, you can 
be held back by RAM, hard drive, or 
graphics card in others. There’s a 
lot of factors when it comes to CAD 
work, and that’s a problem when you 
want to know how one workstation 
compares to another.
Thankfully, there is a solution, 
and it takes the form of industry 
stalwart SPECviewperf. This pushes 
any would-be workstation through a 
series of grueling tests to ascertain 
how they’ll perform in the real world 
of 3D CAD modeling. Because the 
tests used vary in complexity and 
rendering techniques used, there 
isn’t an overall score or index; 
instead, we have results for different 
testing scenarios (which, in fact, 
are made up of multiple test runs 
themselves). You can download 
and run SPECviewperf 12.1 for free 
on your own machine to see how it 
compares: www.spec.org. Note that 
it’s a chunky 4GB download, and not 
a fast one either, so grab a cold one 
after you press the download button.
In theory, the big takeaway from 
SPECviewperf is that professional

cards 
make 
a 
big 
difference in CAD. Unfortunately, 
this is muddied by the fact that 
plenty of the tests benefit from the 
raw grunt offered up by the GTX 
1080 Ti, so it isn’t the whitewash for 
the AMD Radeon Pro WX 7100 that 
you might expect. The GTX 1080 Ti 
does incredibly well in the DirectX 
Maya 
benchmark, 
for 
instance, 
while the WX 7100 is almost 10 times 
faster in the penultimate SNX test. 
If you’re serious about CAD, then 
upgrading to a Quadro P6000 might 
make sense, although you need to 
be prepared to drop up to $5,000 on 
such a card.
Note that these tests are largely 
processor-agnostic, running on a 
single core for the most part, so the 
focus is very much on the graphics 
card in your system. Even so, as 
with gaming scenarios, a faster 
core clock on your CPU can make a 
difference here.

On TO The niTTy-griTTy. You can build all the fancy workstations 
you want, but if you don’t have some way of measuring real-world 
performance across them (which is, let’s face it, the entire point of 
this feature), it amounts to very little outside of hypothetical potential 
throughput. Synthetic benchmarks are good at giving you a rough 
idea of how a system responds, but they’re also fallible. Just take a 
step into Asus’s Crosshair VI BIOS, and you’ll quickly spot the option 
to enable performance boosts for both Cinebench and GeekBench, if 
you should so desire.
Which brings us to the question of what benchmarks we should 
use. For both of the Build Its, found on pages 66 and 70, we stuck with 
our traditional suite, which we use across most of the systems we 
build for those pages—more game-heavy, with a peek at processor 
performance and storage output. However, for this feature, we really 
wanted to focus on a more accurate depiction of how each platform 
operates in a working environment. Which meant delving into real-
world programs.
From the get-go, we knew we wanted to include something 
that utilized CAD clients. Because most software associated with 
CAD reaches the tens of thousands of dollars mark, we opted 
for SPECviewperf, a free-to-download benchmark, which runs a  
number of CAD applications to truly test your GPU’s design  
capability. Next on the list was video editing—for this, we took a 
copy of the latest version of Adobe’s Premiere Pro CC, and coupled 
it with a project file we borrowed from our parent company’s 
corporate advertising division. For photo manipulation, we went 
with Gigapan Stitch. Designed to test memory capacity, bandwidth, 
and CPU prowess, this takes hundreds, if not thousands, of images, 
and stitches them all together to create a massive panorama, with 
PSB files reaching upward of 96GB in some places, depending 
on DPI settings. Finally, we ran a few more synthetics for our own 
understanding of how the systems performed across memory, 
and our traditional rendering benchmarks, including SiSoft 
Sandra and X265, which are available for free or on trial.

bOTh Of The MAChIneS we built for this feature are incredible. But 
there can be only one winner, and in terms of raw performance, 
there’s no getting away from the fact that Intel’s Core i7-6950X 
is an absolute beast. It is expensive, though, and getting the best 
from that chip will set you back a serious amount of cash. Our 
Ryzen machine, meanwhile, is much more thrifty, which means 
that while we do lose out in the drag race of straight performance, 
Ryzen has the Intel system easily beat in terms of value for 
money—20 percent performance improvements in most of the 
tests doesn’t balance well with the 80 percent price difference.
In light of that, you could emphasize the win on this front by 
focusing even more on the value of the individual components. We 
wouldn’t step away from the core of the RAM, motherboard, and 
CPU (although an argument could certainly be made for stepping 
down to the Ryzen 7 1700), but everything else is potentially up for 
grabs. You could certainly pick a more affordable power supply, 
and while we’re personally huge fans of the case, it’s an obvious 
place to save a bit of cash—especially as it won’t affect the bottom-
line performance at all.
The one component that would be easy to replace is the graphics 
card, as you could hit pretty much the same performance in many 
tasks by swapping to a Radeon RX 580 (saving $375). Of course, if 
you use applications that benefit from a pro-level card, that doesn’t 
make sense, but for everyone else, it’s an easy win. The fact that 
you’ll hit even higher frame rates in games won’t hurt either.
Overall, though, we’re happy with how the Ryzen build came 
together, and how it has performed in testing. It’s a strong system 
that proves that AMD is back on a par with Intel. We still have a 
few reservations in some areas—RAM support is still not quite 
where we would like it to be, and as the platform is new, we ran into 
problems during testing that we couldn’t be certain weren’t down 
to the particular test. Even so, if you’re looking to build a power 
workstation machine, AMD is definitely an option once again. It’s 
been a while since we’ve been able to say that.
AmD ConClusion  
the value proposition
The vIdeO edITInG community is 
divided on which editing software 
is best. Apple’s Final Cut Pro and 
Adobe’s Premiere Pro are the two 
most commonly used applications, 
followed by the now-defunct Sony 
Vegas 
(recently 
bought 
out 
by 
Magix). Although Premiere offers 
a far greater set of tools than its 
barely supported Apple counterpart, 
Final Cut Pro’s render times are 
far superior, especially when it 
comes to exporting 4K video. That 
said, Final Cut Pro isn’t available on 
Windows, therefore anyone lacking 
the investment into Apple’s Mac OS 
ecosystem has little choice when it 
comes to video editing software. 
We used Adobe Premiere Pro 
CC for our real-world benchmarks, 
taking 180GB-worth of files, a 
preconstructed 
Adobe 
project 
file, rendering out in 4K in H.264 
at maximum bit depth and render 
quality, and timing how long it took 
each machine to complete the task.
As far as performance goes, 
Premiere is always a mixed bag, 
because it relies heavily on both 
the CPU and the GPU, leveraging 
workloads to whichever core makes 
ViDeo renDering
the most sense. Its Media Rendering 
engine 
supports 
both 
OpenCL 
and CUDA, with the latter taking 
center stage when it comes to eking 
out that extra performance. The 
number of cores and clock speed 
also matter, because although not 
every processor is fully utilized 
during rendering, the more you have 
and the faster those individual cores 
run, the better.
On top of that, we also ran 
our X265 benchmark. This is an 
interesting one because it doesn’t 
rely on any particular GPU, but 
purely transcodes video from one 
file format into another, so it acts 
as a fairly heavy synthetic CPU test, 
producing average fps figures for 
four consecutive runs, which are 
then averaged out again to provide 
the final score for comparison.

We ReCenTly received a comment on the old book of faces, 
asking about the point of processors with more than four cores. 
It got us thinking: How do you best explain the proposition behind 
a workstation, like the two builds we have here? This is what we 
came up with.
Going from a four-core, eight-thread processor to an eight-
core, 16-thread one can cut render times in half. If you shave 15 
minutes off a 30-minute render, and do that twice a day, five times 
a week, that’s 2.5 working hours saved in a week. Multiply that out 
by a year, and it’s around 125 man hours saved. Take the average 
wage of an experienced video editor ($30 an hour), and that’s a 
total of $3,750 saved, purely in time, in a single year. 
What we’re getting at is that, for the self-employed, or the 
corporate busybody looking to improve their company’s efficiency, 
investing in good systems, much like infrastructure, will always 
pay for itself in the long run. And that’s something you partially see 
with the two systems we have here. Ryzen’s value proposition in 
contrast to our Intel build is huge. We knew from the start that Intel 
could never win a fight based on trying to spec a similarly priced 
machine, so performance was the goal—smashing the opposition 
through sheer brute force, graphically, computationally, and in I/O 
support and memory was key. 
We’ve gotta give credit to Ryzen—it’s exceptionally well equipped 
at an outstanding price in comparison to Intel, but it wasn’t without 
its limits. Initial setup and getting memory to operate above 2,133 
was still challenging, even with the latest BIOS updates, and 
Gigapan, in particular, proved troublesome (although that’s also 
true of the Intel rig). Ultimately, recommending one rig over the 
other is difficult. If you’ve got the cash to spare, the Intel one is 
easier to set up, more powerful, and far more stable than its Ryzen 
counterpart. But, in all honesty, with AMD’s 16-core Threadripper 
HEDT platform and Intel’s Skylake-X right around the corner, it 
would be better to see what both of those new platforms muster up 
first, before committing to either ecosystem. 
intel ConClusion  
pricey Build, pricey prize.
IT ShOUldn’T COMe as much of a 
surprise when we say that assessing 
how these machines handle image 
editing varies depending on what 
you’re doing. When you’re packing 
loads of memory, fast storage, the 
fastest processors money can buy, 
and great graphics cards, many 
tasks that take a while on a standard 
desktop are too easy for our monster 
rigs. We searched for workloads that 
actually made sense, but kept coming 
up with operations that finished 
within seconds, or were too specific 
to be of much use. In other words, if 
you’re looking for a workstation for 
image editing, both machines fulfill 
the role competently.
Not all image-based tasks are 
created equal, though, and if you’re 
looking for serious system draining, 
image stitching is a good option. 
The concept is to take a series of 
photographs that cover a wide 
panorama, and stitch them together 
to create a massive final image. In 
order to get consistent coverage 
for these images, a “robot” is often 
used, and that’s exactly what was 
done to get the live data set for our 
testing. The shots in question were 
bracketed for improved contrast, 
imAge stitChing
and the final image count came 
in at a cool 690 images, with each 
measuring 5184x3456 pixels. 
There’s some necessary overlap 
between images, but the final 
panorama is 136,758x50,502 pixels, 
and weighs in at 22GB (we saved 
it out as a Photoshop file for more 
manipulation 
if 
needed). 
These 
things are a serious resource hog to 
work with and move around, but the 
final results are incredible. See for 
yourself by going to www.gigapan.
com/cms/view. The software we 
used for this test, Autopano Giga 
4.4, uses as many CPU cores as you 
can throw at it, loads of RAM, and 
requires fast storage, too. No real 
surprises on the result front—the 
added core count of the Intel build, 
along with the larger capacity 
memory, makes a real difference.

Set up the 
perfect 
network
Upgrade, optimize, and 
secure your network with 
the help of Nick Peers
Unless yoU’ve been missing in action since the Y2K 
Bug failed to destroy civilization, you already have 
some form of networking in your home. A typical home 
network combines wired and wireless networking, with 
your main PC, possibly a printer, and perhaps a games 
console plugged into a router using an Ethernet cable, 
and other devices—those in other rooms as well as 
mobile devices—connecting wirelessly. 
At the center of your network lies your modem and 
router (or modem router if you have an all-in-one unit). 
This acts as a bridge between the network in your home 
—a Local Area Network, or LAN—and the world’s best-
known Wide Area Network (WAN), the Internet.
It’s possible you only use your network for accessing 
the Internet, but if you’re smart, you’ll have found ways 
to use its sharing abilities to even greater effect: Why 
buy a printer for every computer in your home, for 
example, when one networked printer can be shared by 
all? But ask yourself this: Are you using your network 
to its maximum? Is it performing as fast and efficiently 
as it should? Could you expand your network to even 
greater benefit? Are there problems—Wi-Fi congestion 
and interference, for example—that need resolving?
In this feature, we answer these questions and 
more. We show you how to benchmark your network, 
plus reveal its topography. Then we help you determine 
if your router needs upgrading, and examine ways to 
expand your network to every corner of your home.
Once you’ve physically set things up, we look at 
how to optimize your network: improve security, boost 
range and performance, ease Wi-Fi congestion, and 
expand its capabilities by offloading services on to a 
NAS. There’s time for some file-sharing tips, before we 
show you how to access your network securely when 
away from home. It all adds up to one supercharged 
network, so light the fuse, and prepare for blast off….

let’s start by taking stock. Make a 
note of your existing router’s make and 
model, then check out its specifications, 
which you’ll need when determining 
whether an upgrade is worthwhile. Then 
take an inventory of all the devices that are 
currently connected to it. Don’t forget any 
smart home tech you’ve added, such as a 
security camera or SmartThings hub. 
Struggling 
to 
remember 
what’s 
connected where? Use the free Fing app 
on your mobile, or download Advanced 
IP Scanner (www.advanced-ip-scanner.
com) on your PC to scan your network for 
connected devices. Both tools provide you 
with as much information as possible to 
help you identify the devices in question. 
In the case of Advanced IP Scanner, you’re 
given the device name, IP, manufacturer, 
and MAC address—click the “>” next to an 
entry to reveal the resources it shares.
The inventory could reveal unwanted 
devices on your network—in which case, 
our tips on securing your network (pg. 44) 
will help you lock these out—but for most, it 
merely reminds you what’s connected.
One last thing before we begin: Consult 
the box on benchmarking (opposite) to see 
how to perform some quick tests on your 
network as it currently stands. You can 
then rerun these as you make upgrades 
and optimizations to your network, to see 
whether they have an effect.
Pick a New Router
Given the router’s critical role in your 
network, this should form the starting point 
for your network tweaking. First question 
to answer: Is it up to the task? If you don’t 
want your network to be hobbled by slow 
transfer speeds, make sure it supports the 
latest wired (Gigabit Ethernet) and wireless 
(802.11ac) technologies.
You’re not limited to the modem router 
supplied to you by your Internet provider—
and if you’re currently paying a monthly 
rental fee for it, it’s likely you’ll get better 
long-term 
value 
by 
purchasing 
your 
own model. If the modem and router are 
separate, you might even want to consider 
buying an integrated modem router to save 
on space and free up a socket, but make 
sure the model you pick works with your 
current Internet connection—it’s usually 
a choice between cable, ADSL (regular 
broadband), and VDSL or ADSL2+ (super-
fast or fiber-optic broadband). If you’re not 
sure about the acronyms, check with your 
Internet provider (or ask on its support 
forums) for confirmation.
Essential Features
So, what should you look for in your new 
model? Start with the wired ports—
make sure your new model offers Gigabit 
Ethernet to maximize transfer speeds. Most 
routers should offer four Ethernet ports—if 
you have more than four wired devices to 
connect, or your devices are in a different 
room to your router, this may not be a deal-
breaker. See the “Expand your network” 
section later for more help in this area.
Next, choose a model that supports 
802.11ac 
(AC) 
wireless 
networking. 
These days, most routers create two 
separate wireless networks on different 
channels: 2.4GHz and 5GHz. The 2.4GHz 
band is supported by all devices, but 
is where congestion and interference 
from neighboring networks can sap its 
performance (more on mitigating this 
later). The 5GHz band is traditionally less 
congested, subject to less interference, and 
much quicker over shorter ranges.
The 5GHz channel’s major drawback 
is its limited range—particularly on older 
Wireless N routers that supported both 
channels. Wireless AC routers improve the 
5GHz range, thanks to detachable antennae, 
which can identify where connected devices 
are, and target the signal directly at them, 
using a process called “beamforming.”
You’ll also see AC routers are rated 
using different numbers, from AC1600 up 
to AC2800. The latter number indicates 
the maximum combined Wi-Fi speed for 
the router’s two channels—typically 300-
600Mb/s for the 2.4GHz range, and then 
1Gb/s up for the 5GHz range.
If you do a lot of streaming, you might 
also be tempted by a model offering 
Multi-User MIMO (MU-MIMO). MU-MIMO 
improves the efficiency of multi-device 
streaming by streaming multiple packets 
simultaneously, but beware: Behind the 
hefty premium is the fact that your wireless 
devices must explicitly support MU-MIMO, 
and right now, not many do.
Handy Extras
Routers are becoming increasingly smart, 
so look out for these features: UPnP, which 
automatically opens the ports required 
to stream to and from the Internet (albeit 
at a cost to security). Then there’s QoS, or 
Quality of Service, which enables you to 
apply bandwidth limits to specific devices.
Some routers even offer VPN services, 
enabling you to set up encrypted network 
connections to a work network—if you’re 
looking to set up your own VPN server, try 
Netgear’s Nighthawk range, or see the 
“Offload network services” section later. 
Bonus points go to routers that offer USB

Benchmark yoUr network
there are several 
tools and techniques 
you can employ to 
benchmark your 
network performance 
and range. Find out how 
fast your internet connection 
is compared to what your 
internet provider claims by 
visiting www.lifewire.com/
benchmark-2626177. 
if you’re benchmarking 
with a view to streaming video, 
consider 5mb/s a reasonable 
requirement for a single 
HD stream from the likes of 
netflix. the demands scale up 
for Ultra 4k—25mb/s—but for 
most people, you don’t need a 
superfast connection for one or 
two streams. one figure worth 
noting is the upload speed—
this is always much lower than 
the download speed, but could 
be critical if you plan to stream 
video over the internet from 
your network.
How can you test the 
strength of your Wi-Fi signal in 
different parts of your home? 
install the free WiFi analyzer 
app from the microsoft store 
on your tablet or laptop, then 
move around your home and 
record the signal strength (in 
dbm) and equivalent speed 
(mb/s). see how far the range 
goes before it disappears, and 
try to test the 5gHz channel as 
well as the 2.4gHz channel.
if you’d like to test your 
network’s file transfer 
capabilities, download and 
run lan speed test lite from 
www.totusoft.com/lanspeed1 
on your main Pc, and use it 
to connect to a shared folder 
on another device on your 
network. test different file 
sizes (say from 2mb up to 
2gb), and perform at least 
three tests with each, before 
recording the average. 
compare the results of all 
your tests against the type of 
connection you’re transferring 
files over—1,000mb/s for 
gigabit ethernet, 300mb/s-
plus for wireless. these are 
theoretical maximums—don’t 
worry if you’re getting half 
these figures, but pay attention 
to specific results, where it 
seems one device or connection 
is struggling in comparison to 
elsewhere on your network.
ports for printers or external hard drives, 
transforming them into network devices.
All these features come with additional 
costs attached, so set yourself a budget and 
decide what—if any—additional features 
you need. Which router should you buy? 
We’re fans of TP-Link’s Archer AC range 
(www.tp-link.com), which work with an 
existing modem, but if the idea of a modem 
router appeals, visit www.techradar.com/
reviews/pc-mac/networking-and-wi-fi/
modem-routers to find inspiration.
Expand Your Network
Your central hub is now sorted, what next? 
First, if you’re connecting any devices 
directly to the router’s Gigabit Ethernet 
ports, check they’re using CAT5e cable. 
Inexplicably slow connections may be 
fixed by simply swapping out the cable—if 
your router (or switch) provides LEDs for 
each connected port, verify they’re green 
(for Gigabit), as opposed to amber (for 
10/100Mb/s connections).
It’s 
likely 
your 
devices 
aren’t 
all 
conveniently clustered around your router. 
You could look to run CAT5e cabling 
through your walls to each room using a 
structured 
home 
wiring setup (see 
w w w.structured 
homewiring.com), 
but for most people, that’s 
not practical.
If you’re happy to go wireless, you 
might find the upgrade to a wireless AC 
router is sufficient to extend its range 
to your entire home, but if there are still 
“dead” zones, where the signal is weak 
or non-existent, you have one of two 
options. The first, cheaper option is to try 
repositioning your router in a more central 
location, but if that isn’t possible, invest in a 
Wi-Fi repeater, which acts as a relay. Place 
it in a halfway location between your router 
and the dead zone, and it should be able to 
boost the signal into that zone, although you 
shouldn’t expect stellar performance. 
You also need to create separate SSIDs 
for this new Wi-Fi network—how about 
appending something on to the end of your 
existing network’s SSID, such as “TP-
LINK_5GHz-office”?—and then pair your 
devices to the new network, as well as the 
old one. They then automatically switch 
between the two as required, and because 
they’re all linked to your router, your 
network access remains consistent across 
all these Wi-Fi hotspots. Prices start from 
as little as $20 for Wireless N models that 
only extend the range of 2.4GHz networks. 
Wireless AC models start from around $35 
for an AC750 model. 
A new trend is the emergence of “Wi-
Fi Mesh” systems, which combine router, 
modem, and Wi-Fi extenders in one piece 
of kit. These are then sold in multi-packs to 
dot around your home, but they come with 
a hefty price tag: $300 for a three-pack 
Google Wi-Fi system, for example.
Extend Via Your Circuits
Wireless isn’t always a practical solution 
for extending your network throughout your 
home. Perhaps your router isn’t in your 
WiFi analyzer gives you an overview

office, where most of your equipment is 
kept, and you’d like to keep those on a wired 
network. If structured home wiring doesn’t 
float your boat, consider extending your 
network through your electrical circuits 
using HomePlug equipment instead.
You need a minimum of two HomePlug 
(also known as powerline) adapters: one to 
place next to your router, and the other to 
put in the room to which you want to extend 
your wired network. Each adapter plugs 
into a spare power socket, so if you’re short 
on sockets, make sure you choose one with 
a pass-through option. Connect the first 
adapter to your router using the supplied 
Cat5e cable, then connect the Cat5e cable 
in your office to your wired device or—if 
you plan to connect multiple devices—a 
network switch (see below). Add more 
adapters for each room that needs them.
When switched on, press a button on the 
main adapter, and it automatically detects 
the others, and simply extends your wired 
network from your router into each room in 
your house. Adapters of varying speeds are 
available but, before you begin, remember 
that the overall speed of your powerline 
network is determined by the slowest 
powerline adapter on it, so if you’ve already 
got older equipment, it might be time to 
upgrade the lot.
Look for HomePlug AV2 models that 
promise a minimum 1Gb/s (1,000Mb/s) 
or faster, remembering that—as with 
all 
networking 
(and 
particularly 
the 
wireless sort)—the advertised speeds 
are theoretical maximums. Powerline 
equipment is notorious for being affected by 
“noise” on the electrical circuit, so expect 
to achieve no more than half the advertised 
figure, and possibly less. That said, if you’re 
transferring data between two devices on 
the same switch, the data doesn’t need to go 
through the HomePlug adapter, so should 
transfer much quicker.
Some HomePlug models offer two or 
more Ethernet ports to avoid adding a 
switch. Expect to pay around $100 for a 
decent starter kit, such as TP-Link’s TL-
PA9020P KIT, which comprises a pair of 
two-port Powerline adapters, offering up 
to 2Gb/s transfer speeds, and pass-through 
sockets. For more information on powerline 
networks, visit www.homeplug.org.
Add a Switch
A network switch helps manage the 
transmission of data between wired devices 
on your network. If you run out of Ethernet 
ports, or you’ve extended your network 
to another room in your home, you need 
an additional switch to connect multiple 
devices to your router.
There 
are 
two 
types 
of 
switch: 
unmanaged and managed. Unmanaged 
switches are shipped in a fixed configuration 
and perform a similar role to older (now 
depreciated) network hubs, in that they 
the topography of networking
How do computers 
talk to each other 
over networks and 
the internet? the 
answer is through 
the tcP/iP model. tcP 
(transmission control 
Protocol) is the method used 
by computers to connect over 
networks, while iP (internet 
Protocol) is the way in which 
data is transferred using 
“packets” of information. this 
model can be broken down into 
four basic layers: application, 
transport, internet, and 
network access.
at the top is the application 
layer, which splits into three 
basic elements. at the very 
top sit the programs you use 
to access the internet, such as 
your email client. beneath this 
is the “presentation” element, 
where data is translated into 
a suitable format for sending 
over the network—if it needs 
compressing or encrypting, 
that happens here. then 
there’s the “session” element, 
which determines the type 
of connection—or session—
that’s established between 
you and the remote computer. 
examples include HttP/HttPs 
for connecting to websites 
and servers, FtP for basic file 
transfers, and smtP for email.
beneath this is the transport 
(tcP) layer. this manages 
how the data is delivered, by 
converting it into “packets” 
for sending, then making sure 
they’re safely delivered, and 
reassembled at the other end 
in the correct order. it also 
works in reverse for packets 
received by your computer. the 
third layer is the internet (or 
network) layer. this is the 
layer that covers how the data 
is addressed and then routed 
between devices. it’s also 
where the actual delivery of 
data occurs, using iP packet-
switching. the final, bottom 
layer is the network access 
(or network interface) layer. 
this is where error detection 
and correction take place 
as the data is packaged and 
transported, plus it’s where 
you’ll find the physical 
hardware—typically ethernet 
or Wi-Fi—that connects you to 
your network and the internet.

simply relay the connection from your 
router’s switch to any connected devices.
If you want more control over a specific 
part of your network, a managed switch 
will appeal. Managed switches enable 
you to control the network at a local level 
by providing certain features that give you 
greater control over how devices connected 
to the switch behave. You can, for example, 
apply QoS settings to manage bandwidth 
demands, or create Virtual LANs (VLANs) 
that enable you to isolate certain devices 
from the rest of the network, without having 
to physically disconnect them.
Of more practical interest is a feature 
called jumbo frames (also known as 
Maximum Transmission Units, or MTUs to 
their friends). Data is transferred across 
networks in packets known as frames, and 
the 802.3 standard originally defined the 
maximum frame size as a meager 1,518 
bytes. If the devices on your network can 
handle it—and that includes the router 
and any switches—you can increase this 
figure to increase the size of your frames, 
and improve network performance through 
more efficient transfer of data: fewer 
frames mean reduced resource usage and 
faster performance.
Entry-level managed switches cost 
as little as $25 for TP-Link’s TL-SG108. It 
comes pre-configured to work as a dumb 
switch, but you can tweak its settings 
through its Easy Smart Configuration Utility 
tool. Visit http://uk.tp-link.com/faq-697.
html for a handy guide to configuring and 
testing jumbo frame settings. If you want 
more features—such as Link Aggregation 
support for potentially boosting your NAS 
drive’s performance (see Spring 2017 
issue)—check out TP-Link’s SG-T2008 
($55, www.newegg.com) instead.
Optimize Current Networks
Now is a good time to benchmark your 
network again, following the advice in the 
box (pg. 41)—you should immediately see 
improvements in Wi-Fi speed if you’ve made 
the jump from Wireless N to Wireless AC, 
and hopefully better range, too, particularly 
on the 5GHz channel.
The next phase of optimization involves 
first moving any devices that can detect 
the 5GHz Wi-Fi network over to it—not 
only is this channel quicker, but it’ll reduce 
congestion and help balance your wireless 
devices’ demands better. If you’re having 
issues with the range of the 5GHz network, 
move your wireless device closer to your 
router to make the initial connection—once

icon in the taskbar 
notification area and 
choosing “network 
& internet settings,” then 
clicking “sharing options.” 
expand “Private” to verify file 
and printer sharing is switched 
on, along with network 
discovery. ignore Homegroup 
connections, then expand “all 
networks” to disable public 
folder sharing, ensure 128-bit 
encryption is enabled, and 
switch on password-protected 
sharing for security reasons.
it’s no longer compulsory, 
but a good idea to verify all your 
computers are on the same

default, but if you change it 
to something else, repeat for 
all the Pcs in your network. 
type “workgroup” into the 
“search” box and click “change 
workgroup name” to do so.
Forgotten which folders 
you’ve shared? Windows no 
longer displays a folder icon 
to indicate shared folders, but 
you can get a comprehensive 
look (including the paths to 
the folders themselves) by 
right-clicking the “start” 
button and choosing “computer 
management > shares.” 
Double-click “shared Folders” 
for a list—right-click a share 
to stop sharing, or choose 
“Properties” to limit the 
number of users that can 
access the share at any time.
Want to create a secret 
share that’s not visible? 
simply add $ to the end of 
its name, and it won’t show 
up anywhere in people’s 
network browsers—the only 
way to access the share is to 
type its path exactly into the 
address bar of File explorer:  
\\comPname\secretshare$.
Finally, if you’re signed into 
Windows using a microsoft 
account, when you come to 
access a share on that Pc from

it’s paired, your router’s beamforming 
technology should help extend its range 
to your device. If there are still issues in 
certain areas, consider a Wi-Fi repeater.
Next, let’s look at your 2.4GHz network. 
Using WiFi Analyzer (see benchmarking box, 
pg. 41), switch to the “Analyze” tab, where 
you’ll see a series of overlapping circles on 
a graph, indicating what channels are being 
used by your—and neighboring —networks. 
A recommended channel is listed—access 
your router’s configuration settings through 
your browser, and look in the 2.4GHz Wi-
Fi section for a channel setting. Change 
this from automatic to the recommended 
channel (often 1 or 11). Click “Save.” After a 
pause, return to WiFi Analyzer to see what 
effect it’s had. Be prepared to experiment 
with different channels, and test in different 
parts of your home, particularly weak 
signal areas, to improve performance in 
areas critical to you.
More Configuration Tips
Let’s return to the router configuration 
utility and trawl through its settings, 
looking for more tweaks to perform. Start 
by tightening up security—if you’ve never 
done so, change the password required to 
access your router. Also, change the Wi-Fi 
network passwords from those supplied 
with the router, and ensure WPA-PSK2 with 
AES encryption is selected. 
Protect 
yourself 
against 
drive-by 
hackings by disabling SSID broadcast, 
enabling MAC filtering, and switching off 
tighten remote access secUrity
applications and 
services such as 
Plex are simple and 
relatively safe to set 
up for remote access, 
although it pays to keep 
an eye on any reported 
vulnerabilities, then disable 
the service until they’ve been 
patched. one of the reasons 
they’re safer is that you can 
only access them with your 
user credentials using an app 
or specific web address (such 
as Plex media Player and 
https://plex.tv/web). they can’t 
then leverage that connection 
to do anything else.
other services, such as 
logging on to your nas or 
even your router, are trickier, 
because anyone with a web 
browser, knowledge of your iP 
address or DDns address can 
attempt to log on—or brute-
force their way—to your device.
if you are opening up a 
device for outside access, 
you’ll almost certainly want to 
use a dynamic Dns address—
effectively a user-friendly web 
address that points to your 
computer’s public iP address—
to make logging on easier. start 
by signing up for an address 
using a provider such as no-
iP.com (www.no-ip.com) or 
similar. link this to your device 
via its configuration utility, but 
then take additional steps to 
add multiple layers of security 
to the connection.
First, look to force an 
encrypted (HttPs) connection 
to the device in your device 
settings, then aim to back 
this up with an ssl certificate 
for your DDns address (for 
example, QnaP allows you 
to purchase its own low-cost 
ssl certificate, or quickly 
add a free certificate from 
let’s encrypt). switch on 
two-step verification if it’s 
offered, and enable network 
access Protection to block iP 
addresses for set periods of 
time (or permanently) after a 
set number of unsuccessful 
login attempts. 
one last thing: ask yourself 
if you really need to access 
this device outside of your 
network—if you don’t need to 
log on when away from home, 
disable all remote access.
add extra layers 
to protect services 
opened to the internet.
the DHCP server, then check the firewall, 
and switch off UPnP port forwarding. 
Finally, look for a remote access option 
to administer your router from outside 
your home network—switch it off. See the 
October 2016 issue’s hack-proof feature for 
more details on how to apply these changes.
Away from security, look for an “Address 
Reservation” option within your router 
configuration’s LAN settings—this enables 
you to apply static IP addresses to specific 
devices, 
without 
having 
to 
configure 
the device itself. One reason to do this would 
be if you have a device that moves from 
network to network—now you can reserve 
it a specific address on your own network, 
without having to change network settings 
when you move to another.
Lock Down Problem Users
Want to manage your kids’ online access? 
Frustrated at your housemate’s tendency to 
hog the bandwidth when you want to stream 
video to your room? To rein in your kids, 
hunt down the parental control settings in 
your router configuration utility. You should 
be able to select devices by IP or MAC 
address, then apply restrictions, such as 
when they have Internet access, and block 
sites according to rating, keyword, or other 
criteria. To ensure nobody monopolizes the 
bandwidth, look for a “QoS” or “Bandwidth 
transfer as many devices to the 5gHz channel as you can.

power Up yoUr roUter
if you’re happy with your 
router’s hardware 
specification, but 
disappointed with its 
configuration utility 
or the tools it offers, 
you may be able to get a free 
“upgrade” without having 
to shell out for a whole new 
router. alternatively, you could 
breathe life into an old router 
by converting it into a wireless 
repeater or vPn server, 
thanks to the broad range of 
additional features provided by 
a community-built open-source 
firmware called dd-wrt.
start by visiting www.
dd-wrt.com and clicking the 
“router Database” link. type 
the first few letters of your 
manufacturer or model to see if 
it’s in the database and whether 
or not it’s supported (make a 
note of any revision numbers, 
and verify your router is the 
same revision, usually by 
checking the label underneath 
it). While most manufacturers 
are represented, not all of their 
models are supported.
if your model is supported, 
head to www.dd-wrt.com/
wiki to obtain the firmware, 
then follow the instructions to 
download and install it—these 
vary from model to model, so 
make sure you’re following the 
correct advice. typically, you’re 
using your existing firmware’s 
upgrade page to “upgrade” 
to the dd-wrt firmware, but 
sometimes you may need to 
log on to your router via the 
command line.
Please note that there is a 
very real possibility that you’ll 
“brick” your router, which 
means it will be rendered 
unusable. the installation 
section of the wiki goes into this 
in great detail, and if you’re put 
off by the process, that’s not 
necessarily a bad thing—this 
is something that requires a 
great level of technical skill, 
and we’re not in a position to 
offer any support should you 
decide to go down this route, 
unfortunately. With this in 
mind, we suggest trying this 
with an older router—perhaps 
even one that you’ve picked up 
on ebay for a few dollars.
Why not turn an old router into a repeater or vPn server?
Control” section. You can set restrictions 
by IP address or range, or specific ports, 
which enables you to apply limits to specific 
applications. You can set a priority level, 
which only applies restrictions when other 
connections are in play, or set upstream 
and downstream limits that ensure plenty 
of bandwidth is left over.
Offload Network Services
If you’re relying on your PC to provide 
network services, such as a media server 
or backup drive, now is a good time to look 
at transferring those to a suitable device, 
freeing up resources on your PC (plus 
enabling you to power off your PC without 
worrying about losing access). You could 
press an older PC into service, or you could 
invest in a mid-range Network Attached 
Storage (NAS) device. For maximum 
flexibility, choose between Synology and 
QNAP models—the QNAP TS-231 is a good 
entry-level choice, or if you’re looking for 
something that can handle multiple HD 
media streams, splash out on a QNAP TS-
251+ (around $300 without disks). The 251+ 
has a quad-core Celeron, and comes with 
2GB RAM onboard (you can upgrade this 
to 8GB)—more than enough to run multiple 
servers side by side. 
A powerful NAS lets you set up everything 
from secure—and private—cloud backup to 
a full-blown media server. We’ve got Plex 
Media Server handling our media needs, 
coupled with OwnCloud for backup and sync 
(configured for network access only), as 
well as Syncthing for synching media to and 
from the device. A USB hard drive plugged 
in the back expands the onboard storage, 
and is available for all our network devices.
Critically, what the NAS has done is 
allow us to reclaim much-needed system 
resources from other computers—it also 
means we no longer have to leave them 
switched on 24-7 for network services to be 
available around the clock.
Access Outside the Network
Why limit your shared resources to just your 
home? It’s possible to open parts of your 
network to the wider Internet, either for 
personal use or to allow others to access 
your content from anywhere. How you do 
this depends on what you want to share 
—for example, to access your Plex media 
collection from elsewhere requires you to 
go to “Settings > Remote Access” in Plex 
to enable the feature. If UPnP routing is 
enabled, your router should do the rest; 
otherwise, you need to manually forward 
the port listed in Plex (32400 by default) 
to your server’s IP address, using your 
router’s configuration utility.
Making 
other 
network 
services 
accessible over the Internet is more 
dangerous—see the box on tightening 
your security (opposite) for tips on 
mitigating these risks. 
We recommend moving your 2.4gHz network to a less congested channel.

You’re about to witness us waxing 
lyrical about a chassis for Tech Porn. 
That’s right: a PC case. do you know 
how many cases we’ve looked at in 
Tech Porn over the last two years? 
one. 
even 
Phantek’s 
prestigious 
evolv aTX lineup didn’t warrant an 
appearance in our hall of fame. So why 
this one? Why has BitFenix’s Portal 
made it on to these pages, where so 
many others have failed? Simply put, 
because it’s different. Staggeringly 
so. BitFenix was the pioneer of turning 
the iTX chassis into more than just 
another low form factor HTPC: in 
2012, it launched the Prodigy, ruffling 
the feathers of the purists by releasing 
a quirky, graceful, willowy box, far 
bigger than anyone had seen before, 
and  packing an astonishing 230mm 
fan in the front.
The Portal takes that innovative 
Prodigy pedigree and crams it into a 
new style of chassis unlike anything 
we’ve ever seen. a convex roof adorns 
the top, ready to show off the heart of 
any gaming system, while the small 
form factor and outlandish design 
make it look more like something from 
alien than anything built on earth.
Combine 
all 
that 
with 
its 
intrinsically 
complex 
sliding 
rail 
internal mechanism, to allow for easy 
construction and tinkering on the fly, 
and what you’re left with is a chassis 
that takes innovation and case design 
to new heights, without necessarily 
breaking the bank. –ZaK storeY

Another month, another batch of 
goodies arrives in the office. This time, 
it’s something very special indeed. A 
full set of custom sleeved cables from 
CableMod, built exactly to my spec.
Traditionally, high-end, liquid-
cooled, aesthetically pleasing systems 
come with custom sleeved cables, 
painstakingly produced by modders 
and enthusiasts, with intricate 
detailing, stealth cable combs, or 
cable lacing to ensure every single 
aspect of their build pops. 
It’s something I have a huge amount 
of respect for, yet lack the patience or 
time to fully commit to. That’s where 
CableMod steps in. We’ve used cable 
kits from these guys in the past, for a 
variety of power supplies and different 
builds, yet we’ve never dived into the 
custom side of the site before.
CableMod’s “configurator” section 
enables you to enter how many cables 
you want, what length you’d like, what 
material you want them sleeved in 
(nylon or paracord), and what color you 
want each individual cable, within each 
bigger cable, to be. This does whack 
the price up (our total kit cost $320), 
but the quality is outstanding. 
Couple them with a set of clip-in 
cable combs to train the cables, and 
they look perfect. Unfortunately, I can’t 
show you what they look like right now, 
but rest assured, they’ll be coming to 
an issue near you soon.

BACKGROUND
Samsung is back, baby! The world’s biggest smartphone 
maker has launched what is very nearly the world’s biggest 
smartphone—with its monster 6.2-inch display, the Galaxy S8+ 
packs a visual wallop. But how will it fare on the teardown 
table? Let’s get the exploded view. 
MAJOR TECH SPECS
•  6.2-inch, dual-edge, Super AMOLED display with 2960x1440 
resolution (529ppi)
•  Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor, with 4GB RAM
•  12-megapixel rear camera with dual-pixel autofocus, and 4K 
video capture; eight-megapixel selfie camera
•  64GB internal storage, expandable via microSD card (up to 
256GB additional)
•  IP68 water resistance rating
•  Android 7.0 Nougat
KEY FINDINGS
•  Enough delay—we’re eager to see inside. Luckily, by now we 
know the drill. Plenty of heat from our iOpener softens the 
adhesive enough to pry the rear glass up, and start battling 
our way in. But for all our talk, this rear panel does present 
something new. The fingerprint reader lives in the rear 
panel, with a very short cable tying it to the motherboard. It 
looks as though Samsung designed the cable to safely pull 
free with the rear panel. With almost no slack, the gentlest 
lift of the panel yanks the cable right out from its tiny pop 
connector. This makes it decidedly less damage-prone than 
certain fingerprint sensor cables we’ve seen before. 
•  Let’s hope that Samsung’s improved testing procedures are 
what the Note 7 was missing, because this design looks 
about the same to us. And it’s still a bear to pry it off that 
adhesive. Even with the battery fully removed, the glue won’t 
let go. The S8+ features a 13.48Wh (3,500mAh at 3.85V) 
battery—the exact same capacity as the Note 7, and a little 
less than the S7 Edge’s 13.86Wh. Samsung continues to beat 
Apple in the battery capacity wars, with the iPhone 7+ 
weighing in at 11.1Wh (2,900mAh at 3.82V).
•  We extract the I/O daughterboard. There’s lots of ingress 
proofing in evidence, including the speaker grille surround 
and the seals on the USB Type-C connector and headphone 
jack, with a collection of gaskets that help earn the phone its 
IP68 rating. The headphone jack itself remains modular—
good for repairability, as this is a high-wear component. 
•  On a hunt for the mysterious home not-button, we dig into 
the display, despite previous difficulties. Luckily, this fused 
display/digitizer peels up from its frame with a decent 
struggle, but no damage. Hoping to find some hidden detail 
under the display cabling, we peel it up and find—zilch. No 
model information, and no visible pressure sensor. Better 
luck next time. 
•  Repairability Score: 4 out of 10 (10 is easiest to repair). 
Many components are modular and can be replaced 
independently. The battery can be replaced, but tough 
adhesive and a glued-on rear panel make it unnecessarily 
difficult to achieve. Front and back glass make for double the 
crackability, and strong adhesive on both makes it tough to 
access the internals for any repair. Because of the curved 
screen, replacing the front glass without destroying the 
display is extremely difficult.

Tips and Tricks
1
Expand your librariEs
The quickest way to manage your library—and add new content 
(including music)—is to open “Settings,” and browse to “Media 
Settings.” From the “Library” section, click your chosen library—
”Videos,” “Music,” or “Pictures”—under “Sources,” and click the 
“Add” option to add another folder to your library. Remember to 
name your media correctly—head over to http://www.filebot.net, to 
grab a handy tool to help you with this.
>> While you’re in the “Library” section, you can periodically 
clean your video or music libraries to remove files that have been 
renamed, deleted, or stored on a drive no longer connected to your 
PC, but to do this, you must first click the “Standard” setting at the 
bottom of the screen in order to switch to “Advanced,” and reveal 
the cleaning options.
>> If you’d like to streamline your movie library, navigate to the 
“Videos” section, and flick the “Show movie sets” button to on. Now 
all the movies in a specific series (such as Star Trek, Star Trek II, 
and so on) are grouped together [image a]—click the main entry to 
drill down to browse and play each individual movie.

TwEak music info
Got an obscure album the default music scraper can’t 
identify? Go to “Media Settings > Music,” and click the 
“Default provider” option for album or artist information, then click 
“Get more…” to pick from a range of alternatives. And if your music 
When it comes to consuming media—movies, photos, home video, and music—on your PC, 
there’s no substitute for Kodi. It’s equally at home providing you with a big-screen friendly interface 
for locally stored content as streaming media over the Internet. You can—with the right help (as in 
this feature)—even use it as a front end for playing classic games from yesteryear.
The basics of Kodi are reasonably straightforward: Point it to your local music, movie, and picture 
folders, and you’re good to go. That said, the user interface does come with a bit of a learning curve 
attached, and some of its best features are buried away behind seemingly impenetrable dialogs 
and settings. This, however, is where we come in. 
We’re going to skip the basics—adding a media folder to your library isn’t rocket science, 
thankfully—and dig deep beneath Kodi’s surface to reveal some of its best kept secrets. Everything 
from changing library view to auto-starting add-ons, and using Kodi as an Airplay audio receiver 
is covered here. Oh, and we’ll show you how to name and organize your media library so Kodi’s 
scrapers can download all that gorgeous artwork and extra info, too. –Nick Peers

configurE livE Tv
If you’ve set up live TV on your PC (or indeed any 
PC on your network) using TVheadend or a similar 
service, select “TV” from the main Kodi menu, and choose 
“Enter add-on browser.” Locate and select your chosen 
PVR server, then click “Configure” to set up access (for 
example, to connect to a remote PVR server, enter its IP 
address and PIN access code). Click “Enable,” and press 
Esc to go back to the main screen.
>> Once enabled, you’ll see several widgets appear 
under “TV,” making it easy for you to access the TV guide 
and previous recordings, as well as browse live TV (and 
radio) by clicking the remote, and choosing which channel 
to watch. If you’ve previously found Kodi unwieldy with live 
TV, now’s a great time to try it again—you’ll find the latest 
update has made it easier and more responsive, even when 
streaming over your network.

configurE gamEpad
If you’re using Kodi on your gaming rig, why not use 
your gamepad to navigate? To set things up, simply 
press a button on your gamepad while Kodi is running, and 
it should ask if you want to configure it [image b] (or you can 
go to “Settings > System Settings > Input > Configure 
attached controllers,” if you prefer).
>> You’ll see a default configuration—Kodi—is present. 
You can manually link the controls on your gamepad 
by clicking the buttons on the right, and following the 
instructions, at which point your controller should work. 
While you’re here, why not flick the “Enable rumble for 
notifications” switch to on?

configurE kEyboard shorTcuTs
It’s worth familiarizing yourself with Kodi’s 
keyboard shortcuts. There are the playback 
controls, for example: P to play, X to stop, left/right arrow

keys to skip back or forward 30 seconds, or R/F to rewind and fast 
forward—press once for 2x, then keep pressing to speed up. Or 
press the backslash (\) key to move between windowed and full-
screen mode.
>> All well and good, but what if you don’t like the keyboard 
shortcuts Kodi’s picked, or you’d like to configure some more 
of your own? From the home screen, select “Add-ons,” and click 
“Enter add-on browser.” Click “…” if necessary to return to the main 
screen, then choose “Program add-ons,” and scroll down to locate 
and install the Keymap Editor. Once done, click “Run,” and choose 
“Edit” to review current shortcuts and define your own, using both 
your keyboard and your game controller buttons.

add a rEmoTE
If you’ve set up Kodi in your living room, you don’t want to 
have to use a keyboard or mouse to control it. If the game 
controller option doesn’t appeal, simply turn your cell phone

to configure Kodi: Navigate to “Settings > Service settings >

“Allow remote control from applications on other systems” switch 
to on, and—if you’ve not already done so—switch on “Announce 
services to other systems” under “General.”

a changE of skin
Kodi 17 defaults to the Estuary skin, a big-screen friendly 
skin that still lacks a little oomph. If you’re running Kodi 
on a touchscreen device, we recommend going to “Settings > 
Interface Settings,” and clicking “Skin” [image c] to switch to 
Estouchy instead—it’s a similar skin to Estuary, but optimized for 
touchscreen devices (short tap to select, long tap to bring up the 
context menu for an item).

Pining for the look of previous versions, for example? Confluence is 
still an option (or try Aeon Flux for a more updated approach). Visit

Kodi runs on Windows, Mac, and Linux, but you can also install 
it on your Android tablet (or jailbroken iPad), plus downloaded 
dedicated distros for turning a low-powered computer, such as 
a net-top PC or Raspberry Pi, into a dedicated Kodi set-top box.
Kodi recently dropped all support for its dedicated 
Kodibuntu distro, which paired Kodi with Ubuntu 14.04. 
Existing Kodibuntu/XBMCbuntu users should be able to 
update to Kodi 17.1 through the Terminal, though:
 $ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get-dist-upgrade
If you’re new to running a dedicated Kodi machine, then 
you’re left with two choices. Raspberry Pi users are best 
served by OSMC (https://osmc.tv), which can also be installed 
on a jailbroken first-generation Apple TV. You can find links 
for downloading a tool to create the required microSD card 
on Windows, OS X, and Linux, or you can download disk 
images directly.
OpenElec (http://openelec.tv) provides dedicated builds 
for AMD/Intel-powered PCs (including lower-powered Atom 
and Fusion CPUs), plus the Raspberry Pi, and a selection of 
WeTek third-party devices, as well as Freescale iMX6 devices 
from the likes of Cubox.

powEr-saving sETTings
If you’ve hooked up Kodi to your living room TV—perhaps 
through a dedicated computer (see box on previous page)—
you should take measures to configure power-saving to both protect 
your TV and reduce energy consumption. To do this, go to “Settings 
> Power saving,” and click the up arrow next to “Put display to 
sleep when idle,” to set a delay of five minutes—you can increase 
this all the way to 120 minutes, but a 5 or 10-minute delay 
is usually best.
>> If you’d like to power off Kodi after a set period, 
switch to “Advanced” or “Expert” view, then set “Shutdown 
function” to one of “Shutdown,” “Hibernate,” or “Suspend,” 
before setting the “Shutdown function timer” to a delay—
again between 5 and 120 minutes—based on inactivity.

The following feature can be troublesome to set 
up—and frequently breaks between updates—
but if you would like to stream audio from your iPhone 
or iPad to your PC or TV’s speakers, give it a go. First, if 
you don’t have iTunes installed on your PC, install Apple 
Bonjour from https://support.apple.com/kb/dl999, then 
go into Kodi, and navigate to “Settings > Service Settings 
> General” to enable Zeroconf, and review your “Device 
name,” which is how Kodi will advertise itself on your iOS 
device when detected.
>> Now select “AirPlay,” and flick the “Enable AirPlay 
support” switch to on. Switch to “Expert,” and you’ll see a 
new option appear: “Enable AirPlay ‘Videos’ and ‘Pictures’ 
support” [image d]. This needs to be switched off for 
AirPlay to work with devices running iOS 9.0 or later. Once 
done, you should find Kodi appear in the list of AirPlay 
devices on your iOS devices.

need to install additional repos. This is slightly fiddly, but 
once you know how, it’s reasonably straightforward. For 
the following example, we’re going to add the Fusion repo.

and choose “Install from zip file.” Scroll down, and select “Fusion” 
from the list, then browse to “kodi repos\english,” where you’ll see 
a host of available repos to choose from. Select a zip file, and click 
“OK” to add that repo to your list. Now, when you open “Add-ons >

Third-party repos are by their nature risky, and can 
contain dangerous material (see http://kodi.wiki/view/
Banned_add-on for a list of so-called “banned” repos—Fusion is 
one of these). If you decide a repo isn’t for you, remove it. Go to “Add-
ons > My add-ons > Add-on repository.” Click the unwanted repo 
to bring up its window (you can configure its update settings from 
here, too—for example, switch between auto and manual updates). 
To remove it completely, click “Uninstall.” Close and restart Kodi.

auTosTarT add-ons
Here’s the scenario: we’ve got a Raspberry Pi set up 
to exclusively run the Plex add-on in Kodi. We want to 
autostart Plex with Kodi to save the hassle of manually accessing it 
from the main menu. You can autostart add-ons using a script, but 
a simpler way is to use the Partymode Autostart add-on [image E].
>> Add your add-on to the “Favorites” menu: Browse to “Add-ons,” 
then locate your add-on (Plex in our example). Right-click it and 
choose “Add to Favorites.” Go back to the main “Add-ons” screen, 
and choose “Downloads > Services,” where you’ll find Partymode 
Autostart. Once installed, right-click it, and choose “Settings.” 
>> Under “Main,” enable it to “Run on Startup,” and reduce the 
delay to 0 seconds. Make sure “Run on Screensaver” and “Run 
on Playlist” are disabled, then scroll down, and enable “Run on 
Favorites,” before clicking “Select from Favorites” to choose your 
add-on. Click “OK,” exit, and restart Kodi. The normal menu should 
briefly appear, but then your add-on should kick in. Job done!

mulTiplE profilEs
This tip will appeal more to those who use Kodi 
on a shared device, such as a Pi connected to 
your TV. Go to “Settings > Profile Settings > Profiles” 
[image f]. Click “Add profile.” Type a name, and click “OK.” 
Leave the profile directory as it is (click “OK” again), then 
choose whether this profile shares the same media library 
as the default user (choose the read-only option to stop 
people from modifying the library), as well as its media 
sources, then click “OK.” You can then opt to copy settings 
across from the default user or let them start from scratch.
15
lock down profilEs
You may not want your users to be able to tweak 
settings, in which case, select the profile lock 
option, and—if necessary—set a profile lock password 
when prompted: either a numeric PIN, a full-text 
password, or even a gamepad button combo. Make your 
choice, then choose what parts of Kodi to lock (effectively 
disabling them), from libraries (music, videos, pictures, 
programs & scripts) to the file manager, settings, and add-
on manager. When locking settings, you can allow users 
to access some settings by choosing a level (standard, 
advanced, or expert). 
E
F
The Rom Collector Browser add-on enables you to transform Kodi 
into a hub for playing games as well as accessing your media. It 
supports standalone games as well as emulator ROMs—these 
need to have been configured already (for example, through a 
GUI-friendly MAME variant, such as MAMEUI: www.mameui.info).
Assuming these are all in place, go to “Settings > File Manager,” 
and choose “Add Source” to create a source pointing toward your 
game emulator folder (or parent folder, if multiple emulators 
are installed). Now install the Rom Collector Browser add-on 
via “Add-ons > Download > Program add-ons.” Once installed, 
launch it, and choose “Yes” to create a config file. Choose the 
online option, followed by your platform, before pointing the 
add-on to the emulator program folder containing your ROMs 
and artwork folder in turn. Once done, you can include additional 
ROM emulators if required, before reviewing the import settings, 
and clicking “Import Games.”
The scrapers aren’t always accurate, so you may want to 
reconfigure Rom Collector Browser: Press the C key to bring 
up a menu, then select “Edit Rom Collection” to make changes.

Play with Digital 
3D Modeling Clay
1 
Get Started
Your first few steps in Sculptris really couldn’t be much 
simpler. Find the installer at http://pixologic.com/sculptris/, 
and download it. You’re asked to give up a bit of personal info to 
get the link, but you don’t explicitly have to—the link isn’t sent to 
your email, so lie if you must. Install it, run the software, and you 
hit the interface. Tools at the top-left, settings for the current tool 
running along the top of the window, and a big ball of gray clay slap 
bang in the middle, ready to be molded by your mouse, with a line 
of symmetry running down its center. Give that clay a click right 
now. The default tool, and one you’ll come back to again and again, 
is “draw,” an additive tool that essentially dollops a little more 
clay on top of whatever you’re working on—the area you clicked, 
highlighted by the orange circle, should grow a little. Hold down 
Alt and you invert the draw tool, and scoop away clay instead; this 
switch between additive and subtractive modes is true of just about 
every tool in Sculptris’s palette, with a couple exceptions. 
2 
Careful doeS it
You may have noticed that the draw tool is a little trigger 
happy at this point. Using it leads to you adding or removing 
gigantic handfuls of clay, rather than performing the intricate 
molding you might be expecting. This is actually fine, because a 
real clay sculpture is generally made by lumping balls of material 
together, then smoothing them down later on. So use it, sparingly, 
to rough out the vague shape of the thing you’re trying to create. 
There are only 11 undo levels stored, so be careful; you’ll want to 
use small strokes rather than just holding the left mouse button 
and scribbling, but give yourself enough breathing room to take 
back mistakes. You can rotate your model by holding the right 
mouse button and dragging, pan by doing the same thing with Alt 
held, or zoom with the mouse wheel.
3 
tweak the toolS
This brings us to a curious feature of Sculptris’s interface. 
Although zooming brings your model closer in view, your 
tool remains the same size, meaning that you can now add finer 
details. This is certainly one way to get intricate, but you need to 
use the sliders for more pinpoint control. Size, as you might expect, 
alters the radius of the circle of influence, again maintaining the 
relative size from your viewpoint, even as you zoom, while strength 
tweaks the amount that the tool affects your model. We generally 
There are plenTy of ways to be creative in the 3D realm, but few of them emphasize the 
creativity part of the equation as well as Sculptris does. Made by developer Pixologic, the company 
behind high-end 3D modeler Zbrush, it is, as its name suggests, primarily focused on sculpting. 
You’re given a big ball of digital clay, then you can poke, prod, and pull it into just about any shape 
you like. Obviously, being based on a malleable, tangible material, Sculptris is best used to create 
organic shapes and creations; slashing out the slick lines of a high-end sports car is going to be 
rather difficult.
It’s not flawless, either. There will be times when you push your clay outside the realms of 
normal three-dimensional physics. You might create so many polygons that your PC grinds to 
a halt—a decent amount of RAM and a capable graphics card is definitely recommended. But 
careful application of its tools and liberal use of the undo shortcut should be all you need to create 
something very cool indeed. –Alex Cox

recommend using lower strength values where possible—
the more gentle you are, the less likely it is that Sculptris 
will place a stray vertex somewhere it shouldn’t be, and 
cause you problems down the line. Hit Space to bring a 
quick slider control up close to your cursor.
4 
Smooth it out
You’ve added lumps, and by now you’ll have 
created a rather rough outline of the object you’re 
trying to create. You can now use two tools to refine your 
broad shape into something more workable: smooth and 
flatten. The former is accessible no matter what tool you 
have selected. Simply hold Shift to quickly switch to it (or 
awkwardly select it from the tools panel, though this is a 
much less efficient way of quickly prototyping your mold), 
then click and drag over your model to even out any rough 
edges. Again, this benefits from a lower strength, which 
you can set independently from the strength of your current 
tool, and it’s worth noting that you can’t invert the smooth 
tool with Alt to make things rougher, because that would be 
silly. Flatten is a slightly more extreme tool, and one you’ll 
use less often—click a surface, and drag the circle over a 
higher or lower area to even things out to match the level of 
the surface on which you began your click.

CreaSinG up
The crease tool, which we’ve used to add the cracks between 
the plates in our skull [image a] is—despite our over-
enthusiastic use of it here—probably best left alone until the end 
of proceedings for two key reasons: It’s primarily a detail tool, and 
it doesn’t play nice with smoothing. This means it’ll be the most 
prominent cause of vertex errors in your model, and once they’re 
there, they’re nigh on impossible to get rid of. If you must use it, pick 
a low strength and a large size, and crease gradually. The same 
goes for the pinch tool, which isn’t exactly a reverse crease—it 
behaves slightly differently, pulling your drawn bumps into more 
prominent ridges, but it’s still dangerous.

Sculptris’s rather vague, flamboyant circle of 
influence can be rather frustrating; editing one 
thing can lead to changes in other areas of your model. For 
our alien’s (rather frightening) teeth, we’ve avoided this by 
using a mask, highlighting the area we want to work on, 
and eliminating others. Before you go masking, though, it’s 
important to know that the mask brush does, by default, 
actually add polygons to your sculpture in order to cut off 
precisely the area you wish to work on. It doesn’t change its 
form at all, but it usually increases the overall complexity 
of your model. To prevent this, drag its detail slider to

the 
widely-used OBJ file format, 
and can import OBJ files, too. 
At least, it can import most of 
them—it complained at us if 
the models entirely consisted 
of four-sided polygons or 
quads, so bear that in mind. 
If you don’t want to start with 
a simple blob of clay, you 
can base your creations on 
an imported model. Hit the 
import OBJ button, and pull in 
something you’ve downloaded 
from the likes of http://.
free3d.com. If you don’t want 
to increase the complexity of 
your model while working, set 
the detail slider to zero, as it is 
by default—these models are 
usually constructed to use the 
bare minimum of polygons, 
though, so you’ll likely want to 
up the detail if you’re making 
significant changes. If you’re 
only looking to play with 
Sculptris for a bit of fun, this 
is a great way to get started.

zero—now it’s restricted by the polygons you have already defined. 
The same is true for any of the tools we might use.
>> In our example [image B], we’ve masked the whole head off, 
and left only the mouth region open for editing. You can do this 
by selecting the mask brush, holding down Ctrl, and clicking the 
background to invert the current mask. Because the whole model 
begins unmasked, the entire thing now becomes masked. Now, hold 
down Alt while drawing with the mask brush to invert it, essentially 
unmasking the bits you want to work on. You don’t need to go this 
extreme, though; unless you foresee your cursor flying all over the 
place, a simple ring around an object you’d like to edit, or a mask 
over a bit you’ve just got right—such as the eyes [image C]—should 
suffice. When you’re done masking, hold down Ctrl, and drag the 
background to reset the mask to defaults.

GraB & Go
If you want to make interesting effects, the grab tool 
is for you. It enables you to pull your material, but 
it’s not entirely realistic—you can drag clay from a single 
point without necessarily distorting your whole model, 
for a start. So why, if it’s so useful, have we waited until 
now to mention it? Well, grabbing and masks go very well 
together. Mask off an area, and start pulling the clay around 
it—again, being gentle, gradually tweaking using small 
motions, and moving the camera to give you the perfect 
angle—and you can create, for example, worryingly ugly 
lips. Mask off two sides and pull, and you can create fins 
or other flappy extremities, which can later be grabbed, 
with the correct combination of tool settings, to be angled

While we do love Sculptris, its 
not been updated for a while, 
and it’s still floating around in 
its alpha form, meaning there 
are quite a few bugs. Luckily, 
if you want to play with 3D, 
you’re not limited to pro-level 
packages, which typically cost 
upward of $500. Windows 
10’s Creators Update, for 
example, introduces Paint 3D, 
a simplistic take on modeling, 
which lets you chuck around 
primitives and crudely 
inflated 2D sketches. On the 
other end of the complexity 
scale, you could try apps such 
as venerable open-source 
subdivision modeler Wings

or curved. Don’t think you have to use masks, though; for our alien’s 
jaw-tentacles [image d], we used the grab tool set on high strength, 
with a fairly narrow size, gradually pulling each longer and longer. 
It’s hard to get too precise with this tool, so it’s handy to use it in 
places, like our deliberately floppy tentacles, where Bob Ross-style 
“happy little accidents” enhance the look rather than ruining it.
8 
touChinG up
The next step takes as long as, or possibly longer than, the 
initial molding phase. It’s time to get deep: Zoom in, and start 
adding details. Use the draw tool, close up, with a narrow focus and 
medium strength, to add bumps and ridges, quickly smoothing 
them down to give extra life and dimension to your model. Go wild 
with the crease tool, adding wrinkles and blemishes. When you’re 
happy that the symmetrical features of your model are complete, hit 
the symmetry button to edit each side individually—it’s a one-way 
process, so only do this when you’re sure you don’t need to mirror 
anything. You can now work on the center line of your object, which 
is tricky with symmetry active, and add individual features, such 
as scars [image e]. Bear in mind, if you’re creating a face, a bust, 
or an unpleasant alien guy, that no face is actually symmetrical, so 
use the grab tool with a wide radius and a reasonably low strength 
to shift elements around. Make one eye very slightly lower than 
the other, tweak the nose, use this opportunity to add expression 
to your face. We masked off the eye area to pull the brow down 
slightly, making our visage slightly more threatening.

Simplify it

added, but the next step is to remove detail. As you construct,

go up. This is counting the number of polygons used in 
your model; the higher it is, the greater the impact it has 
on your system. Switch on wireframe mode [image f], and 
you’ll see the truth within your creation. That rounded, soft 
clay isn’t curvy for nothing. Deep white strips of polygons 
generally follow areas of heavy creasing (we told you it 
was dangerous), and you may even find heavy clusters of 
triangles where there’s no reason for a big patch of detail. 
So leave wireframe mode active, and grab the reduce 
brush tool. Start gradually reducing the detail in those 
over-complex areas, and watch the polygon count drop as 
you do so. Holding the mouse button and scribbling doesn’t 
work with this tool—it’s more like the flatten tool, in that 
you should begin your swipe on an area of lower detail, and 
drag it over higher detail areas to bring them back into line.
10 
perfeCt paintinG
Time for another one-way process: Once you’re 
sure you’ve completed the sculpting portion of 
your model, you can transfer into paint mode by clicking 
the paint button at the top of the interface. It’s not entirely 
one way—you can jump back to your model later, and add 
small bumps and features within paint mode, but if you 
start modeling again, you lose any painting you’ve done. 
Sculptris’s painting tools are not its finest feature, but 
they’re a good way to make your model more presentable 
before you share it with the world. The first thing you need 
to do is choose a base material for your model [image G], by 
clicking the sphere toward the upper-right of the interface. 
There are tons to choose from, which give different levels 
of reflectivity and lighting, so try a few. You can choose 
to inherit the color as well as the light mapping of your 
material by toggling the option below the sphere.
>> Now comes the painting part. Begin daubing away 
with the paint color tool at a high strength, and you quickly 
find it’s like attempting to apply make-up with a broom—
the accuracy isn’t there. You can drop the strength and, 
by clicking the button above the tool settings, switch on 
airbrushing for a more subtle effect, but it’s difficult to 
create something that doesn’t look silly, particularly if your 
early sculpting put a few polygons out of place, making 
coloring them in illogical or impossible. The best use of the 
paint tool is to bring out the cracks and crevices in your 
model [image h]—paint it one uniform color, perhaps with 
the fill tool, then airbrush its valleys with a darker color, 
using the cavity button to pick them out specifically.

Create Bokeh Effects 
Using Photoshop
1 
Choose your baCkground Color
As is often the case with Photoshop, there’s a couple of ways to 
go about this. Firstly, we’ll fake a completely new background 
for our image. Take a look at the photo you want to use—what 
are the main tones in the background? We’ve taken a photo of a 
graphics card sitting on a fence outside, for obvious reasons, so 
the background is a mix of greens, light browns, and muddy hues. 
We can sample these later, so don’t worry too much about them for 
now, but choose one to act as the main background color. Use the 
Dropper tool to sample it, and set it as your background color by 
clicking the little right-angled arrow next to the color samples on 
the left, below the toolbar.
2 
Make a new baCkground
Create a new document [Image a], and make it roughly the 
same size as your photo (you can find out its pixel dimensions 
by going to “Image > Image Size”). In “Background Contents,” 
change from “Transparent” (the default) to “Background Color.” 
Click “Create,” and you should get a new document completely 
filled with your sampled color. Save it as a PSD, then create a new 
layer in the “Layers” palette.
3 
Create a CIrCle of Color
Go back to your original photo, and sample another color 
from the background. This time, keep it as your foreground 
color. Go to your new document and, on the new layer, use the 
Elliptical Marquee tool to create a circle (hold Shift to constrain 
Bokeh is the name given to the perceived quality of the out-of-focus areas of a photograph. More 
generally, it’s used to refer to those areas themselves, the word coming from the Japanese for 
blur or haze. The effect is most easily created using a digital SLR camera, with a large sensor and 
a lens with a large aperture and long focal length, creating minimal depth of field in the photo, and 
throwing the background completely out of focus. 
In this situation, highlights in that background tend to become more prominent, changing from 
points of light to large hazy circles, sometimes taking on characteristics of the lens, such as a 
particular shape, or picking up on aberrations within the glass. Done right, it can be beautiful.
It’s an effect that’s difficult to create with a compact camera or cell phone, because despite 
the larger apertures creeping into smaller cameras’ lenses, the tiny sensors and incredibly short 
focal lengths work against you. Luckily, it’s completely possible to fake a bokeh effect with a little 
Photoshop know-how. –Ian EvEndEn

it, because you’ll end up with an oval otherwise). Feather 
the edges of your selection by 10 pixels using “Select > 
Modify > Feather,” to keep the transition between colors 
soft, then fill the circle with your foreground color using 
the Bucket tool. Deselect, and you end up with a circle of 
color with a soft edge.
4 
tweak the CIrCles
Duplicate this a few times, using the Move tool in 
conjunction with Alt, and hit Ctrl-T to enter “Free 
Transform” to resize your circles. This way, each circle 
sits on its own layer. Once you’ve made enough circles, 
group some together by grouping their layers (blend them 
first, so they show through where they overlap—“Screen” 
works well) to make duplication easier. Again, use “Free 
Transform” to resize and rotate the groups.
5
blend the baCkgrounds
When happy, merge all your layers, and head over to 
the original photo. Select the background, feather 
the edge by a few pixels, and drop your new image into the 
selection using “Edit > Paste Special > Paste Into.” Use 
“Free Transform” again to size it to fit, then blend it with 
the original background using “Luminosity” [Image b], 
but keep it at about 97 percent. This allows a bit of color 
graduation, but doesn’t allow background detail through.

background objects are from the camera. Select the background as 
you did previously, then open “Filter > Blur Gallery > Field Blur.” 
Your cursor now turns to a rather unhelpful push-pin shape, and 
a circular target appears in the center of your image. What you’re 
going to do is drop pins into different areas of the image, then 
control how blurred they are by using the sliders on the right-hand 
side. It works best if you choose objects in the order in which they 
recede from the camera. So, our first pin goes on the graphics card 
itself, with the blur slider set to zero. Next, we drop a pin on the bit 
of fencing on the right of the card, then the fence to the left, which 
is further away, then the house beyond that, on the right, then the 
trees in the far background, increasing the amount of blur each 
time [Image C]. Photoshop is intelligent enough to make a good 
guess at what you want to blur, by selecting continuous areas of 
color for you.

further blurrIng
Below the blur sliders is another set, marked “Effects,” and 
you can use these sliders to alter the blurred areas further. 
We found Light Bokeh to be the most effective slider, creating a nice 
bloom effect in the background highlights, but it’s also the easiest 
to take too far, rendering unnatural white spots in the soft blur. 
Once you’re happy, hit “OK.”

fInal touChes
If you want, you can combine both techniques 
we’ve covered here, and create a really defocused 
background with specular highlights, and an increase in 
blur as distance from the camera increases [Image d]. The 
important thing is to keep the selection of your foreground 
object saved, using “Select > Save Selection,” so it can 
be loaded back again at a later time, saving you the bother 
of having to make the selection all over again. Once you’re 
happy, save the PSD for further tinkering later, and export 
your image as a JPG or PNG for sharing or printing. 
D
Filters to blur images made up some of Photoshop’s earliest 
tools, and the new Blur Gallery does much to bring them up 
to date. Motion blur can add a sense of movement to photos 
of, for example, mountain bikers, while the Path Blur tool 
enables you to blur along lines in an image, which is perfect 
for adding movement to the arms of dancers. Converting the 
layer you are working on to a Smart Object (right-click it in the 
“Layers” palette) enables you to add effects without making 
them permanent—perfect for experimenting. Even on a 
normal layer, the “History” palette enables you to step back 
through your work, and undo anything you don’t like.

Play VR Games on 
Your Cell Phone

Get prerequisites
We’re using a pair of software components for this tutorial. First 
is TrinusVR, which comes in two parts: a PC server (get it free 
from www.trinusvr.com), and an Android app (available from the 
Play Store in 15-minute trial mode, which you should install first, 
and in a time-unlimited $9.99 full version). We’ve selected Trinus 
over some of the other options (VRidge, in particular) because it’s 
not picky about which games it runs; its competitors generally do 
the job of translating already VR-compatible titles from their Oculus 
or Vive modes into a stream displayed on your Android headset, but 
don’t run with anything else. Trinus includes a fake 3D mode, which 
attempts to translate any 3D game into one that’s VR-compatible, 
but it doesn’t actually add any noticeable 3D—which is where TriDef 
3D (get the 14-day free trial from www.tridef.com before you drop 
$39.99 on the full thing) comes in. This app intercepts the z-buffer 
of a host of popular games, such as Skyrim, GTA V, and over 900 
others, outputting a stereoscopic view with real depth. The two 
running in parallel offer just the thing we’re after, although it’s 
worth noting that you can also use Trinus to run SteamVR games 
without the need for TriDef 3D.
2
Hook it up
With everything installed, it’s time to tether your phone to 
your PC via USB. Depending on your handset, this is either 
trivially easy or teeth-gnashingly hard, but it’s absolutely worth 
doing, particularly if your phone has USB 3.0 support. In theory, you 
just need to head to your Android settings screen, select “More” 
We don’t all have an expensive vR headset. Without one, exploring the three-dimensional 
world of the future is sadly out of reach. But we do, in the most part, all own cell phones, which 
means that world is a lot closer than you might think. With a $15 plastic headset (or even a cheap 
and cheerful Google Cardboard) and a little software trickery, it’s actually pretty straightforward to 
start exploring VR gaming without the need for an Oculus Rift or a Vive. And with the software we’ve 
selected here, you’re not even tied to those games that have VR support built in. 
Time for a little tempering of expectations, though, as there are certain things that VR on your 
cell doesn’t do nearly as well as VR on a dedicated headset. We’ve rooted out the most lag-free 
method possible, but those nanoseconds of delay are definitely there. Head tracking works, but 
you can forget about room-scale interaction. And your cell phone’s screen may not be the ideal 
candidate for being an inch from your eyes; we noticed a lot of rainbow edges and screen door effect 
while testing this guide. Forgive those few flaws, though, and you’re in for quite a ride. –Alex Cox

under “Wireless & Networks,” head into “Tethering &

title from its supported list (www.tridef.com/user-guide/

click “Add a game manually,” then point it to the desktop 
shortcut of your chosen title [image a]. Select the game’s 
name from the next window, and its icon ends up in the 
TriDef interface. Double-click it to get the game running, 
and set that game to run windowed in a 4:3 resolution, such 
as 800x600 or 1024x768, with low-level anti-aliasing. If all 
has gone well, you’ll see a split-screen view of your game 
on your desktop [image B].

Now open up Trinus on your desktop and phone. They should 
each, if correctly tethered, say “USB detected.” On your 
desktop, head to the “Video” tab and set “Fake 3D” to “Disabled,” 
then set the capture mode to “General” in the “Main” tab. It’s now 
time to test your connection—hit the triangular icon on each app to 
establish the connection, click your game window to bring it into 
focus, and your game should appear on your cell screen [image c]; 
slide your handset into your VR headset, and you’re ready to play.

refinements
Your initial experience might be a bit fuzzy. By default, 
Trinus doesn’t apply any lens correction, meaning certain 
areas of your game window are out of view, and you may experience 
a very compressed image. Let’s make this better: Click the triangle 
to cancel the connection for now, then, on the “Main” tab of the 
Trinus desktop app, set the image scale to “Ultra,” and drag the 
compression slider all the way to the right. Under “Head mount,” 
tell it which headset you’re using, then head to your cell phone, open 
the settings screen, switch “Lenses” on, and set the performance 
to “Quality.” Connect again, and you’ll find things are much sharper; 
with lens correction on, you should see a less distorted picture, 
with most of the UI in view—or at least you will once you view your 
cell screen through your VR lenses.

With your game running, hit 0 on your number pad to see 
TriDef’s on-screen display [image d]. You can tweak a 
D
number of options using the 8, 4, 2, and 6 keys to navigate, 
and 5 to select. With your headset on, use the 3D menu to 
tweak the scene depth to your liking, but bear in mind that 
pushing it all the way to 100 leads to some odd shimmering 
shadows around certain objects in the middle distance. You 
can also adjust the amount that’s pushed in front of your 
screen, essentially using an inverse stereoscope, although 
this can be taxing on the eyes, so use caution here. If your 
GPU can handle it—and, let’s face it, the low definition of 
phone screens means we’re not pushing the resolution 
here—up the quality to “High” in the performance menu. 
C
If you experience discomfort or sickness 
while using this guide, there are a few 
things to try. First, check your headset; if 
you can adjust the focal length and width 
of your lenses to suit the width of your 
pupils, do so. Then use the “IPD” slider on 
Trinus’s main tab to adjust it in software—
you can scroll with your mouse wheel 
to get it just right. Next, head to the 
“Sensors” tab, and adjust the sliders to 
increase or reduce the feedback your 
cell’s gyro gives to Trinus. Head tracking 
is a tricky thing to nail down, and finding 
the sweet spot here should make your 
experience a lot more comfortable. You 
may or may not find that setting a dead 
zone, reducing wobble in-game, helps 
slightly, and sensor prediction can make 
a small difference if that tiny amount of 
lag gives you an out-of-body experience. 
The most important advice we can give, 
though, is to stop using VR if it’s making 
you feel sick. However fun it may be, it’s 
not worth losing your lunch over.

Ryzen to the 
Challenge
We’re alWays comparing hardware here 
on Maximum PC. Every review, build, and 
feature sees us comparing components, 
or whole systems, against what has gone 
before; either explicitly when picking 
components, or more subtly when alluding 
to performance metrics. Even so, it’s rare 
that we actually go head to head against 
another machine in the same issue, yet 
that’s exactly what we’re doing here: 
two machines aimed at solving the same 
problems, but only one can be considered 
the winner. 
That’s the ethos behind the cover 
feature this month, and to some extent, 
that forms what has gone into these two 
builds. However, when it comes to piecing 
together this Ryzen build and the Intel 
one on page 70, they can be considered 
in isolation. If you want to build either 
machine, you’ll find the full component 
lists and build processes over the next few 
pages, and you don’t have to keep referring 
back to the cover feature in order to do so. 
Having said that, there are a few 
things worth bearing in mind at this 
point: These machines are designed to 
handle workstation loads, and, as such, 
the component choice isn’t the standard 
desktop fare—the Radeon Pro WX 7100 
that can be found inside this machine is 
aimed at serious CAD work, for instance, 
not playing the latest games at 4K. With 
that said, it’s time to get building….

sTarTing on The righT fooT  
obviously, The sTarTing poinT for this build was the Ryzen 7 
1800X, the high end of AMD’s current Ryzen lineup. We did briefly 
toy with the idea of trying to build a machine on a much tighter 
budget, to see what sort of value for money we could squeeze 
out of AMD’s new architecture, but looking at the Intel rig that 
Zak’s piecing together, cost is clearly the last thing on the young 
reviewer’s mind. Time is money, after all. Once we’d decided on 
the chip to use and the general ethos of building something that 
needs to at least give Intel’s finest a run for its money, a lot of the 
other components came together quite easily.
On the motherboard front, we went for the winner of last 
month’s AM4 motherboard group test, the MSI X370 Gaming 
Pro Carbon. Into that we slid four 8GB sticks of Corsair’s sleek 
Dominator Platinum RAM, alongside a serious graphics card in 
the form of the AMD Radeon Pro WX 7100. There are plenty of all-
in-one solutions for keeping a Ryzen cool, but here we wanted to 
go with an air cooler, and so reached out to Arctic, who provided 
us with a Freezer 33 for our build. We’ve used the same hard 
drive and M.2 system drive as the Intel machine, which give us a 
good base for a fast boot drive, coupled with plenty of space for 
data at the same time. We eased all of this gorgeous gear into 
the spacious Corsair Carbide Air 740 case, and powered it all with 
the frankly over-the-top HX1200i Platinum from Corsair as well. 
There are TWo schools of thought when it comes to 
building PCs: check the core components outside of the 
case first, and the more optimistic route of throwing it 
all together in the chassis, and only finding out if you’ve 
got problems once you flick the switch. For this build, 
we were of the more pessimistic persuasion, partly 
because our chip had some bent pins that needed 
straightening. It also means you have lots of room 
when piecing together the cooler. The Arctic Freezer 
33 was fairly straightforward, as it uses the backplate 
that comes with the mobo. Even so, we ran into a 
few problems while screwing in the heatsink, which 
resulted in a screw sheering. We had a spare backplate, 
but if you’re not so lucky, don’t force it. Like we did.
We love comparTmenTalized cases, because they 
promote good airflow and clean builds, and the Carbide 
Air 740 gives you plenty of space in both sections for 
your components. The rear area is for the power supply 
and your hard drives, with removable drive cages for 
3.5-inch and 2.5-inch drives. There is ample space 
for the slightly oversized power supply we used in this 
build, and the fact that it is completely modular made 
for a particularly easy installation. A thumbscrew helps 
position the PSU in place with a tiny retaining bracket, 
as you get it lined up with the rear grille, which is a 
neat addition.

sliding The moTherboard into place was every bit as easy 
as installing the power supply. In fact, because the PSU is in 
its own compartment, it frees up plenty of space around the 
motherboard, making this one of the easiest installs we’ve 
ever done. After clipping the rear IO shield into place, the board 
slotted in neatly. One thing to note here is that we had to spin the 
rear case fan around, so that it was working in tandem with the 
Arctic Freezer 33, as opposed to fighting against it. We could 
have avoided this by installing the cooler fan the other way 
around, but we didn’t want to obstruct the RAM slots, despite 
there being plenty of clearance.
The radeon pro WX 7100 is something of an oddity in 
these days of over-sized coolers, because it’s just a single-
slot card. There’s an air of no-thrills seriousness about 
its design, and it’s refreshing to not have to worry about 
making room for a two- or three-slot behemoth. The card 
only requires a single six-pin power connector, too, which 
was easy to route around the back of the motherboard. 
We connected the rest of the cabling at this point as well, 
pulling it as tight as possible around the back to keep 
airflow clear on the business side of things—particularly 
important when using an air cooler on the CPU.

The neXT sTep was to spin the case around so we could 
work on the cabling after installing the hard drive. The 
Carbide Air 740 uses a tool-free design for holding your 
hard drives, which means that popping the data drive into 
the system was really easy—clip the drive into the caddy, 
then slide it into the cage. There’s only room for three 3.5-
inch drives in this cage, although there’s space for four 
2.5-inch drives as well. Cabling was also straightforward, 
thanks to the copious number of rubber-edged cutouts on 
the motherboard tray. 
once The moTherboard was in place, it was a straightforward 
task of installing the memory and the M.2 drive. The only 
awkward bit here was getting the heat spreader, that MSI 
includes to keep those M.2 temperatures in check, screwed 
into place. This uses a very small screw, which escaped our 
grasp a few times when trying to anchor it in place. In hindsight 
we should have installed the M.2 drive before placing the 
motherboard in the case. It’s also worth noting that we’re using 
the top M.2 slot, as there are two slots on this motherboard.

The arctic freezer 33 was 
straightforward to install, and 
kept the ryzen 7 1800X at comfortable 
temperatures in use. you may get a little 
more overclocking headroom with an all-in-
one water cooler, but the simplicity of this 
solution is a good counter to that.
3  
a professional card, such as the amd 
radeon pro WX 7100, isn’t essential 
for many builds, and if you fancy spending 
your spare time gaming, an enthusiast-
level card may well be a better option. for 
instance, an rX 580 is half the price, and 
outperforms it when it comes to gaming.
The big selling poinT of ryzen is the multi-
threaded performance at a great price. This 
machine promotes that ethos in a succinct 
way without compromising in order to get 
its point across—you could definitely build a 
cheaper workstation with the same core, but it 
wouldn’t be as rounded a machine. This is a PC 
that has an eye on its price tag, while knocking 
out solid performance at the same time.
The 
build 
itself 
was 
surprisingly 
straightforward, with the Corsair Carbide Air 
740 making for a great basis for a clean build. 
After constructing so many ITX systems, it’s 
refreshing to have so much room around the 
motherboard. If you’re going to augment your 
own workstation with plenty of SSDs and hard 
drives, this comes heartily recommended—
although if you want to install lots of 3.5-inch 
hard drives, you’re going to need to come up 
with your own mounting system, because the 
included cage only holds three drives. 
The other component that impressed us 
was the Arctic Freezer 33. Even allowing for 
the fact we overtightened one of the mounting 
screws, and needed to grab another backplate, 
we’d still class it as an easy install. (Besides, 
that was our fault, not Arctic’s.) The Arctic 
Freezer 7 Pro was an incredibly popular option 
back when the Core i7-920 was king, and while 
it’s doubtful that the Freezer 33 will regain the 
throne in these days of all-in-one coolers, it’s 
worth considering for your own builds.
When it came to testing, we could have left 
the Ryzen 7 1800X running at stock speeds, 
but that would have felt like we were wasting 
the chip’s true potential. We couldn’t get this 
particular chip running at 4GHz stably (it 
would boot fine, but then fall over during a 
hearty benchmarking session), so settled for 
a solid 3.9GHz instead. There is an argument 
to be had for not overclocking at all when 
dealing with a workstation, but it’s in our DNA 
to push CPUs as hard as possible, and we 
weren’t about to change that stance. Even so, 
for reference, we did initially run the chip at 
stock settings, and saw Cinebench R15 post 
scores of 149 in single-threaded loads, and 
1,600 with the multi-threaded test.
It’s worth bearing in mind that this is our 
standard benchmarking suite for Build It, 
and as such it leans toward gaming more 
than the hardware in this machine is happy 
with. The Radeon Pro WX 7100 is essentially 
an RX 480 with slightly slower clocks, which 
equates to a rather sound thrashing from our 
zero-point machine (which employs a Fury 
X for the gaming heavy lifting). You can hit 
smooth frame rates in most games with some 
tweaking, but if you’re serious about relaxing 
with your workstation, you would be better 
off going with either a more powerful card, 
or conversely a cheaper one. To find out more 
about the workloads that these machines are 
really built for, we suggest turning to our cover 
feature on page 26.

The Intel Rig 
of Damnation
This is iT: the head-to-head. The build-
off. To hell with gaming, it’s Ryzen versus 
Intel. X370 versus X99. Chipset versus 
chipset. 
A 
superstar 
competition 
to 
determine the definitive champion of the 
workstation marketplace. Whether it’s photo 
manipulation, 4K video editing, or the most 
advanced calculative tasks, we’re pitting 
two of the gnarliest top-end Ryzen and Intel 
systems against each other in an epic battle 
to the FPU death.
After spending the last few issues gushing 
over Ryzen’s positive performance prowess, 
it was this hardware reviewer’s duty to take 
on team blue for our challenge. And, boy, did 
we call in the big guns: 10 cores, 20 threads, 
64GB of high-spec DDR4 memory (we did 
consider 128GB but, well, we can’t absolutely 
demolish the competition), an Nvidia GeForce 
GTX 1080 Ti, and Asus’s now legendary X99-
E-10G WS motherboard to hold the whole 
thing together.
From a price to performance perspective, 
this is a system and a platform that makes 
little to no sense. With Intel’s chips still 
priced so ridiculously high compared to their 
red counterparts, the per core cost of this 
machine really is unjustifiable. That said, 
with support for twice as much memory, at 
frequencies as high as 3,333MT/s, and with 
the vast majority of rendering programs 
benefiting from larger quantities of the 
volatile stuff, it should make this platform the 
overall performance king.

The King of Craziness  
oK, ThaT priCe: ouCh! Why the big bucks? Where are the 
compromises? And what makes this system so much better 
than the $2,000-cheaper competition fielded by executive editor 
Alan Dexter (pg. 66)? That X99 platform. Knowing the Intel build 
was never going to win as far as affordability was concerned, 
we decided our best bet was to leverage those two extra cores 
and the greater support for DDR4 than the X370 opposition. By 
default, our Ryzen system consisted of an eight-core, 16-thread 
processor, and 32GB of DDR4, likely operating at 2,133MT/s, 
depending on motherboard revision. In contrast, we doubled the 
memory capacity to 64GB of 3,200MT/s DDR4, and added an extra 
two cores and four threads. Couple all that higher-spec quad-
channel memory with the more powerful cores, and our real-
world benchmarks should be substantially different from the 
Ryzen cousin. Enough to shatter those real-world benchmarks 
in half? You’ll have to read our lead feature (pg. 26) to find out.
Apart from memory and chip differences, the two rigs feature 
identical storage setups. To retain parity, we decided to run each 
system off a single Samsung 960 Pro 512GB PCIe M.2 NVMe SSD, 
and a 2TB WD Black hard drive—we didn’t want the storage to 
have a huge impact on the real-world figures. Couple that with 
the fact that the X99 smokes X370 on the number of SATA ports 
and potential PCIe drives, and you can see what we’re getting at.
ahh, ThaT beauTiful X99-E-10G WS. To be quite 
honest, we could have gotten away with a cheaper 
motherboard, but we simply had to request this one 
back in. The connectivity, combined with its strong 
overclocking prowess and workstation pedigree, 
made it the perfect choice. Also, the beauty of X99 is 
its lack of need for a backplate. We simply installed 
the motherboard into the system, popped the memory 
and chip in, and could leave the massive CPU heatsink 
until last, thanks to that reinforced socket, making life a 
dream in comparison to our Ryzen competition.
raijinTeK’s asTerion plus comes with an assortment 
of cooling from the get-go—pretty impressive for this 
kind of chassis. And those fans? Well, they’re not bad 
either. You get two 120mms in the front, and a single 
120mm in the rear—the only nuisance is those Molex 
adapters. Traditionally (well, back in the late noughties), 
if you didn’t have enough fan headers on your board, you 
could plug them in via Molex, to get them to run at a 
constant speed. However, because we didn’t need them, 
we simply cut the Molex part off as close to the three-
pin header as possible, and plugged the fan header into 
the board instead.

R&D
iT’s been a sTruggle to find a system in which we can use 
EVGA’s 1,600W T2—without occupying those PCIe slots with 
another three GTX 1080 Tis, there’s very little need for a PSU 
of this caliber. However, the biggest problem by far isn’t the 
fact that it remains heavily under-utilized, but more that the 
thing is so darn long. So long, in fact, that it ends up touching 
the hard drive cages located under the PSU cover, even in this 
rig. It’s a frustrating fix, but for the sake of the build, as we’re 
only running one hard drive here, we opted to pull the hard drive 
cage out entirely, and run off the single one on top of the PSU 
cover. In a real-world scenario, you could get away with running 
a 1,200W PSU or smaller, then keep the additional HDD cage, to 
allow for a total of three 3.5-inch HDDs.
looK aT ThaT rear i/o, or perhaps we should say lack 
of. There’s not a lot of it on this board. Four USB 3.0 slots, 
one USB 3.1 Type A, and another Type C, and, of course, 
the standard 5.1 + optical-out audio solution. But the real 
kingpin of this device is the dual 10Gb/s Ethernet ports, and 
a fairly good excuse for skimping on the internal storage. 
Couple this system with a QNAP TS-431X-2G NAS, with 
built-in 10GbE, for a $350 starting price, sans hard drives, 
and a nice chunky 10GbE Internet connection, and it would 
be a workstation force to be reckoned with.

noCTua’s nh-d15 is a monster of air cooling capability. With 
two NF-A15 140mm fans, it cools the same surface area 
as a Kraken X62 or Corsair Hydro H115i AIO. But with two 
major differences: It works by convection, not a pump, and 
is half the cost of the Kraken. And with Noctua’s legendary 
fan lifetime (150,000 hours), and six-year warranty, there’s 
no fear of it dying on you. But it wasn’t all roses: We had to 
raise up the closest fan to avoid making contact with the 
memory, and drop down the GTX 1080 Ti by one PCIe slot, 
so it didn’t make contact with the GPU’s backplate.
and here’s our soluTion to the conundrum we mentioned 
above: You can mount an additional two SSDs here, on top of the 
PSU cover—or, using the included rubber locking grommets, a 
single 3.5-inch HDD. You need to use a straight SATA data cable, 
and the end of a SATA power, but it’s more than suited to chilling 
out here. Let’s just take a moment to appreciate that Samsung 
960 Pro 512GB—we do enjoy some of that sweet M.2 love. What 
a standard!

The biggest fault with this 
case is probably the rear 
panel, consisting of a hinged 
acrylic door—if your cable tidying 
isn’t good enough, it’ll jut out above 
the hinges.

we could have gone with a 
Titan xp, or perhaps even a 
Quadro, but for most jobs, the gTx 
1080 Ti holds its own against the 
two graphics giants, and comes in 
far cheaper.

although appearances 
shouldn’t really be a major 
factor when it comes to a decent 
workstation, we’ve got to admit 
that the beige and poop-brown fans 
have really grown on us.
4
if a windowed chassis like this 
isn’t your jam, you could save 
yourself some cash, and opt for a 
silenced fractal design define r5 
midi tower instead.
This build was a relaTive cake walk 
to produce. There were conundrums and 
problems that needed solving, mostly to do 
with that insane NH-D15 cooler being a little 
too chunky in various places, but otherwise 
nothing really stood out in terms of difficulty. 
Ideally, we would have loved to have gone with 
a case with a touch more storage potential, but 
you should be running your backups away from 
your main system in this working environment 
anyway. Replace that meager 2TB with a 6TB 
or higher WD Black, and it should be plenty for 
any onsite storage. 
The biggest advantage of using the X99-E-
10G WS, however, comes in the form of those 
dual 10GbE connections in the back. What they 
do is make offsite storage a potential reality 
for heavily accessed programs and media. 
That QNAP NAS we spoke of earlier, coupled 
with a few HDDs, would make this system truly 
killer. On top of that, if you really do crave the 
internal capacity, there’s support for a total 
of six 2.5-inch drives with this system, all of 
which can be plugged in via the X99-E-10G’s 
10 SATA 6Gb/s connection. And, of course, you 
have Intel’s U.2 connector, and that M.2 x4 for 
a plethora of PCIe alternatives.
On to performance. Because we’ve already 
covered our extensive real-world tests in 
the main feature (pg. 26), we’ll focus on the 
usual plethora of system benchmarks here, 
to provide some clarity for the regulars about 
how our two systems perform.
In short, and unsurprisingly, our Intel 
system absolutely demolishes our zero-point 
in almost every benchmark, the big one being 
Cinebench R15. Our 6700K, at 4.6GHz, is 
certainly no slouch, but can it compete with 
the mastery of a 4.2GHz Core i7-6950X? Sadly 
not. With the 20-threaded beast bringing in 
an impressive 2,188 points in multi and 175 
points in single-core performance, it makes 
the 6700K look like small change.
Storage performance was equally as 
impressive, with the 512GB Samsung 960 
Pro booting those figures up against the wall. 
Our 1080p gaming test suite also fell prey to 
the 1080 Ti, with nothing scoring below 60fps. 
The 
biggest 
shocker, 
however, 
was 
the cooler, and its absolutely staggering 
performance. Staying at a steady 72 C, with 
1.29V in the V Core, the plucky tower just goes 
to show that not only can you overclock easily 
enough on air, but it’s just as powerful as any 
AIO, and packs the extra reliability that a pump 
simply cannot muster.
There’s no escaping the fact that this 
system is expensive—exceedingly so—but 
if you’re after the very best in performance, 
whether that’s for 3D rendering, video content 
creation, photo manipulation, or more, in this 
humble reviewer’s opinion, X99 is still the 
king of the hill. Well, until Skylake-X and that 
luscious new chipset drop later on in the year, 
at least.

More cores, more threads, and more 
performance for less money. That’s the 
killer proposition for AMD’s new Ryzen 
CPU. Suddenly, most of Intel’s desktop 
processor range looks overpriced and 
short on punch.
But does that thinking extend to this, 
the new Ryzen 5 1500X, with its mere four 
cores and eight threads? After all, Intel 
has plenty of mainstream quad-core chips 
to choose from. And as good as Ryzen 
undoubtedly is, Intel still has the edge on a 
per-core basis.
Initially, the 1500X looks competitive, 
if not quite the knock-out option of the 
six and eight-core models. At $189, it 
lines up roughly against the Intel Core i5-
7400. That’s a quad-core, quad-thread 
model, with a 3GHz base clock and 3.5GHz 
Turbo speed. Ryzen chips aren’t directly 
comparable in terms of clock speed, 
but with a 3.5GHz base clock and 3.7GHz 
turbo speed, the 1500X has a little extra 
in hand to offset Ryzen’s slight per-clock 
deficiency versus Intel’s finest. It’s also 
fully unlocked, theoretically allowing for 
even more frequency advantage where 
Intel keeps most of its chips locked down, 
bar the pricey K series models.
Of course, you could argue that if you’re 
going with Intel, you would be crazy not to 
grab the Core i5-7500 for just $10 more, 
what with its 3.4GHz base clock and 3.8GHz 
Turbo speed. And as we’ll see, it’s just that 
kind of calculation that eventually undoes 
Can Ryzen maintain the magic with four cores?

the 1500X. But that’s getting a little ahead 
of ourselves. 
First, let’s have a sniff around the 1500X’s 
prowess in our performance benchmarks. 
Like the other Ryzen chips we’ve sampled, 
multithreading is where it hits hardest. At 
over 800 points in Cinebench, it batters the 
much more expensive Intel Core i5-7600K, 
let alone those cheaper Core i5 models. 
The 1500X is quicker than the 7600K in Fry 
Render, too, albeit by a pretty small margin, 
though it’s more or less a dead heat in 
x265 video encoding. In other words, it’ll 
absolutely beast those price-parity Core 
i5-7400 and 7500 processors in anything 
that’s multithreaded.
Beaten at its own game
The exception, as ever, is gaming. Many 
titles tend to be GPU-limited at the detail 
and resolutions keen gamers are likely to 
be using. But where a game is CPU-limited, 
which is the case even at high resolutions 
in Total War: Attila, Intel chips still have 
the edge, though it’s worth noting that this 
quad-core Ryzen delivers precisely the 
same frame rate in Attila as the six-core 
1600X. Over time, as game developers get 
their heads around the nuances of AMD’s 
new Zen architecture, the gap may well 
narrow. For now, though, gaming is Ryzen’s 
one obvious weakness, and it applies to the 
1500X as much as any other mode.
Gaming, 
however, 
really 
is 
the 
exception. Nearly everywhere else, Ryzen 
is damn quick. The 1500X also impressed, 
in relative terms, in our overclocking tests. 
We managed a straightforward and stable 
4.1GHz, or a 400MHz overclock. That’s not 
exactly spectacular, but it’s a useful 10 
percent boost.
So the question you have to ask yourself 
is whether the $30 saving over the six-core 
Ryzen 1600 and the $60 saving versus the 
slightly faster 1600X is worth it. With the 
latter, you’re getting both 50 percent more 
cores and slightly faster clocks. What’s 
more, with any Ryzen processor, you’re 
almost certainly going to need a new 
motherboard and RAM to go with it. That 
means a likely minimum investment in the 
region of $500. In that context, an extra $30 
or $60 for a six-core model and a lot more 
performance is surely the better choice.
With all that in mind, it’s not the Intel 
alternative that pulls the rug out from 
under the 1500X, it’s the value proposition 
of those six-core models. A few years down 
the road, when some of us have existing 
systems with AMD’s new AM4 socket, the 
value calculation will look different. But for 
now, and considering the total cost of going 
with a new Ryzen rig, this particular 1500X 
chip is a hard sell. –JereMy Laird

It’s been almost 14 months since Nvidia 
launched its GTX 1080 GPU, and in that 
time AMD has released diddly-squat 
to challenge it. Leaving the high-end 
marketplace to be monopolized by the 
gargantuan green giant, it seems that just 
as AMD has regained some ground in the 
processor market, thanks to its brilliant 
Ryzen processors, its GPU strategy has 
faceplanted into the ground in a liquor-
fuelled stupor. These cards are, frankly, 
not that interesting. Not even as far as a 
rebadge is concerned.
Harsh? Absolutely not. Every new 
generational jump in GPU prowess has 
lead to one, maybe two, redesigned cards 
at the top end, with the older flagships 
then generally relegated down a step each 
time, usually with a slightly higher clock 
speed, and potentially some architectural 
tweaks to bring them in line with the new 
titans of graphical dexterity heading up the 
range. An R9 290 becomes an R9 380, a 280 
becomes a 370, and so on. 
With the 500 series, this just hasn’t 
been the case. The 480 received a slight 
overclock and a boost to its TDP, pushing 
it from 150W to 180W, and that’s it. And 
we can report that very little has changed 
with the 570, too. It still houses the same 
2,048 shader cores, 128 texture units, and 
32 ROPs; almost identical to last year’s RX 
470, bar a slight increase to its base/turbo 
Attila and Rise of the Tomb Raider, but drop 
the antialiasing down a setting or two, and 
enable DX12, and AMD’s superior support 
for the latest API happily brings this sub-
$200 card up into the 60s. 
So, who is this card for then? Well, 
there’s not a lot of difference between this 
and the RX 470. That said, an upgrade is 
still an upgrade, and those looking to build 
a new system, coming from AMD’s mid-
range 200 series cards, or Nvidia’s GTX 
700 series, will be getting a solid deal with 
this offering. It’s odd to say, but we feel as 
though AMD is somewhat short-changing 
us here. These cards don’t offer anything 
particularly new, and do nothing you 
couldn’t achieve on an RX 470 yourself with 
a touch extra voltage. The 4GB variant we 
tested here is just the right combo for the 
GPU housed within, and makes it an ideal 
card for 1080p gaming. – Zak storey
clocks, and the TDP growing by a hefty 
30W as well. 
On top of that, there’s still very little sign 
of Vega, outside of the rumor mill, allowing 
Nvidia to hold on to that massive market 
share, and bludgeon anyone interested in 
the upper echelon of gaming greatness 
with the inevitable team green tax.
Disappointing news indeed—there are 
whisperings that the newest RX 560 will 
have far more shader cores enabled than 
its predecessor, and therefore far greater 
performance than its esports-oriented, 
single-game cousin, but until we have 
confirmation from AMD on that, we’re 
holding our breath.
Performance, then. Well, first off, can we 
just say that Gigabyte has done a fantastic 
job with the design of this card? Seeing 
Aorus make its way from gaming laptop 
brand to championing all of Gigabyte’s 
latest and greatest hardware has been a 
breath of fresh air for the company. And 
this card is no exception. It has a crisp 
clean, dual-fan design, with only a single 
LED logo, a solid backplate, and plenty of 
cooling potential to keep even the longest 
gaming sessions well below the 70 C mark, 
with very little audible noise.
In game, the 570 is a fairly solid, mid-
range 1080p card, hammering our test 
titles well into the high 50s—almost at that 
sweet spot. It still struggles with Total War:

Workstations have to be big. Lesser 
systems can be smaller—even a gaming 
PC can be realized in a tiny space—but 
workstations have to be big. Don’t they? 
Not long ago, Apple crammed an incredible 
amount of power into the Mac Pro, and that 
was tiny, and stylish, if somewhat flawed. 
So, maybe workstations don’t have to be as 
big as we think. Take a look at this svelte 
little number: It isn’t quite NUC scale, but 
at 8.5 inches square, it’s far smaller than a 
standard workstation, especially when you 
consider that it packs an Intel Xeon and a 
Quadro graphics card in its tiny form.
Before we get carried away with the rest 
of the specs, it’s worth noting that the Xeon 
in question isn’t the sort of thing that gets 
your average server admin excited. The 
Xeon E3-1245 v5 at the heart of this machine 
runs at a fair lick—3.5GHz, turboing up 
to 3.9GHz—but only has four cores and 
8MB of cache. It does offer up support for 
ECC memory, which HP has employed in 
the form of 2x 8GB DDR4-2400, but it only 
offers two memory channels.
The problem is that the lower order of 
Xeon processors doesn’t look so enticing, 
given today’s post-Ryzen world. Here’s a 
four-core, eight-thread chip that struggles 
against some of Intel’s own mainstream 
offerings, and gets annihilated when 
compared to the Ryzen 7 1800X. The 
defense, in this case, is that the chip has a 
TDP of just 80W, but you could drill down 
AMD’s stack and grab a Ryzen 7 1700, 
which has a TDP of 65W, and it would still 
give this Xeon a good hiding. 
Of course, the CPU is just one aspect 
of a workstation, and any system aimed 
at designers also needs to deliver on the 
graphics front. The Nvidia Quadro M620 
would appear to offer up the goods, but 
like the Xeon, it isn’t quite the big hitter you

may first think. As that M-prefix suggests, 
this is ostensibly a mobile solution, which 
works in the tight thermal confines of HP’s 
chassis, but lacks punch. The 30W TDP is 
impressive, and as a Quadro GPU, it comes 
with the driver certification for the top 20 
packages (including AutoCAD), but it offers 
up only 512 CUDA cores, and boasts a 
mere 128-bit interface to the paltry 2GB of 
dedicated GDDR5 the GPU can call its own. 
While we have our reservations about 
the long-term viability of the CPU and 
GPU, we’re much more upbeat about the 
storage. The 512GB M.2 drive puts in a 
great turn of speed—a feeling backed up by 
the impressive benchmark figures. There’s 
room in the Z2 Mini G3 for an additional 2.5-
inch drive as well, so you can arm it with a 
surprisingly large amount of storage. 
When it comes to benchmarks, the HP Z2 
Mini G3 puts in a reasonable performance, 
but not sparkling, and for the kind of cash it 
will set you back, we expected a lot more. 
Given that this is aimed at serious use, 
where time is money, scores this far behind 
our zero-point speak for themselves. 
Compare it to the machines we’ve seen for 
this month’s workstation feature, and you’ll 
understand the false economy here.
We do love the design of the Z2 Mini G3, 
but we can’t see who would buy it, especially 
with the slightly lackluster configuration 
we have here. Like the oft-criticized Mac 
Pro, design should not dominate, and here 
we’d recommend going for something 
bigger. It appears that workstations do 
indeed still have to be big. –alan Dexter

It’s not every day we get something as 
exceptional as this. A board that challenges 
all logic, positioned so high on the economic 
spectrum only the rich kids of Instagram 
and those really looking to burn holes in 
their pockets can attest to its brilliance.
This is, without doubt, a ridiculous 
board. Not in the same way as Asus’s X99-
E-10G workstation motherboard, but in 
a ludicrous concept kinda deal. It’s a well 
established fact that gaming benefits from 
higher performing single cores than slower 
performing multi cores, as found in the 
Broadwell-E and the X99 platform. That’s 
not to say that this dollar-burning combo 
is particularly bad at gaming, merely that 
it’s unnecessary. For the purist, there’s no 
logical reason to spend all that extra cash 
on an eight-core processor and above.
But for the professional, the streamer, 
the YouTuber, the showcaser, well, that’s 
a different story. Let’s talk about what 
you get for all that cash, a plump $570. 
Well, outside of the 2011-3 socket and 
quad-channel memory, supporting up to 
3,333MHz, you also get a neat 5.25-inch

assortment of 5.1 audio, TOSLink, and the 
two neat additions of BIOS reset and clear 
CMOS switches in the rear.
However, it’s the board itself that 
touts the biggest arsenal of connectivity, 
with no fewer than four PCIe x16 slots, a 
plethora of fan headers, USB 2.0 headers, 
RGB headers, two USB 3.0 headers, and 
a full bank of 10 SATA 6Gb/s, followed by 
Intel’s now almost defunct U.2 connection 
standard. Plus, it looks stunning. The rear 
I/O cover, in particular, immediately draws 
your eyes to it, especially with that slice of 
RGB lighting baked in.
Then there’s the performance, which 
really pushes the boat out for the Rampage 
V Edition 10, particularly when it comes 
to overclocking. For the first time in a 
very long while, we managed to push our 
Core i7-6950X beyond the 4.3GHz limit—
admittedly, only to 4.4GHz, with 1.45V in 
the V Core, but achieve that it did. We have 
seen the X99 Strix Gaming achieve similar, 
but it wasn’t anywhere near as stable as 
our overclock on the Rampage V, and it took 
multiple attempts to get both the voltage 
and temperatures just right. 
On top of that, power consumption is 
equally impressive. In our power load test, 
we saw a total power draw of 230W from 
the wall, in stark contrast to the X99 Micro 
2’s 350W. In fact, we were so impressed 
that we left it running for 10 minutes, and 
still saw very little fluctuation in figures.
Ultimately, this motherboard is not for 
the faint of heart. Its extreme price puts it 
out of reach of all but the most enthusiastic 
enthusiasts. It’s ideal for liquid cooling, and 
those looking to build a super-clean system 
using the X99 platform. Combine this with 
one of EKWB’s full cover monoblocks, 
and it’s truly a thing of beauty. But does it 
warrant the price? Only if you have access 
to a plethora of processors you can bin for 
it. For the average punter, that’s simply not 
the reality, and you would be far better off 
investing in something lower down in ROG’s 
lineup, such as the Strix X99, or even the 
Prime instead. –ZaK storey

In AprIl, Intel launched its first SSD with 
3D XPoint Technology, the Optane SSD DC 
P4800X. Boasting incredible performance 
at low queue depths with high endurance, 
it’s targeted at enterprise users—$1,520 
for a 375GB model. The PCIe interface 
is likely a bottleneck to the P4800X’s 
performance, and Intel has a different plan 
for the consumer market: Optane Memory. 
The M.2 form factor drives offer a new 
alternative to Intel’s aging Smart Response 
Technology (SRT) and its 20/24GB SLC SSD 
caching drives from 2011/2012.
Capacity is limited to 16GB or 32GB—
priced at $44 and $77. You could RAID 
several drives to get more capacity, but 
even four would only deliver 128GB—not 
to mention being priced about the same as 
high performance NVMe drives, such as 
Samsung’s 512GB 960 Pro. Clearly, Intel’s 
intent is for budget and mainstream users 
with plain old hard drives to upgrade to 
"near-SSD" levels of performance.
Setup is simple: open your PC, install 
the Optane Memory module, and power 
up. Then install the necessary Intel Optane 
Memory app, and enable Optane Memory 
support. This takes a few minutes and

modifies your PC to boot from the Optane 
module, along with copying some Windows 
files. Optane only provides an SSD cache 
for the C: drive, and if you want to remove 
the Optane module, you must use the same 
app to disable Optane support.
The problem with SSD caching is that it 
requires having the data you’re accessing 
in the cache before it helps, so the first time 
you use an app, it feels like you’re going to 
a hard drive—because you are. But as the 
system learns your usage patterns, critical 
and commonly used files end up in the 
cache, and improve responsiveness. Intel’s 
SRT was underwhelming, but the faster 
M.2 x4 PCIe connection and extremely low 
latency 3D XPoint help.
In a few instances, the 32GB module 
is several times faster than a pure hard 
drive solution. Particularly noteworthy 
are the Adobe Premiere, Windows, and 
Doom launch times. Optane Memory is 
also intelligent about what files it caches, 
so movies don’t need to consume precious 
space. There’s only so much a finite cache 
can do, of course, so if you regularly access 
apps that exceed its capacity, performance 
falls back to HDD levels. We found actively 
switching between four games was enough 
to exceed capacity—bad for benchmarks, 
but not an issue for many people.
Beating a hard drive isn’t difficult, so 
we grabbed a budget 480GB SATA SSD for 
comparison. It costs about the same as a 
2TB HDD plus the 32GB Optane module. 
The performance ties the Optane solution 
on the tests we ran. More importantly, 
performance is always high, as there’s no 
cache to populate. Optane can also help 
performance if combined with a SATA SSD.
The biggest concern is that Optane 
Memory is limited to a very narrow use 
case. It requires an Intel 200-series 
chipset motherboard that supports the 
feature, and a Core i3 or better Kaby Lake 
CPU. So the only people who can use it are 
running Intel’s latest and greatest CPUs 
and mobos, but they'll mostly benefit if 
they’re running hard drives, not SSDs, 
which we recommend against—your boot 
drive should be an SSD. –JArred WAlton

Speed matterS. How do you like that for a 
sales pitch? If there’s any truth to it, you’d 
think AOC’s AGON AG251FZ gaming monitor 
is a certainty for success. After all, it clocks 
in with 240Hz refresh rate capability.
It wasn’t too long ago that LCD monitors 
capable of anything north of 60Hz were 
unusual. Now, 120Hz and even 144Hz 
screens look like technological chumps. 
But, as refresh rates creep ever higher, a 
conundrum slides into smoothly-rendered 
view. Is there a point at which increasing 
the refresh rate stops making a difference? 
What are the limits of human vision here?
Hold that thought while we navigate the 
AG251FZ’s main feature set. It’s a 24.5-inch 
LCD monitor with a Full-HD 1080p native 
resolution—that’s 1920x1080 pixels. In this 
age of the 4K, 40-inch TV for under $400, 
the AG251FZ looks painfully pricey. 
That value only looks worse when you 
consider that it also uses low-cost TN panel 
technology, not the more expensive IPS or 
VA alternatives. But there is logic to all 
this: To drive the latest games at full detail, 
fast enough to make full use of that 240Hz 
refresh capability, is no small feat, even at 
1080p. Up the ante to 4K or even 1440p, and 
the chances of achieving anything close to 
240fps are outstandingly remote, even with 
the most powerful graphics hardware.
Similarly, given the remit is fast-paced 
gaming, using the fastest screen tech, 
even if it has shortcomings in other areas, 
makes sense. Add to that a number of other 
gaming-friendly frills, including a low-
input lag mode and FreeSync support, and 
the result is an overall package that looks 
promising, even at that $500-plus price.
But how good is it in practice? For 
starters, the TN panel is one of the better 
examples of the twisted nematic art we’ve 
seen. In fact, for colors and contrast, it’s as 
good as we’ve seen from this panel type, 
other than the recent crop of 4K TN models, 
which are really in a class of their own.
It’s still not really a patch on the best IPS 
and VA screens, of course. That’s especially 
true if you factor in the latest models with

quantum dot or HDR technology. Most 
obvious are the relatively narrow viewing 
angles. It’s the one metric by which TN 
technology has conspicuously failed to 
close the gap on other LCD panels. But in 
isolation, the AG251FZ puts on a decidedly 
decent show for basic image quality.
So what of that crazy-high refresh rate? 
We’re in the realm of subjectivity, but for 
what it’s worth, in various synthetic tests, 
including text scrolling and image panning, 
it is just possible to discern the difference 
between, say, 120Hz and 240Hz. It’s not 
nearly as obvious and dramatic as the step 
up from 60Hz to 120Hz, but it’s there.
Picking that difference out in games is 
a whole different story, however, and it’s 
not something we could do reliably. Now, 
that’s not to say there are no benefits, but 
they are relatively subtle. Of course, that’s 
assuming you can even drive said game 
beyond 120Hz. 
That said, the AG251FZ’s other gaming 
features certainly add to the package. The 
pixel response is about as good as it gets, 
and the overall experience is utterly lag-
free, even without enabling low-lag mode. 
If you’re looking for a seriously quick and 
slick panel for first-person shooters, the 
AG251FZ should certainly be on your list.
For everyone else, it’s something of a 
niche proposition. Even for gamers, the 
benefits of 240Hz are probably marginal 
versus a 120Hz monitor. In reality, most will 
prefer more pixels or a higher quality panel 
for similar money. –Jeremy Laird

There’s a fighT going on in the lower 
divisions of the mechanical keyboard 
market. Logitech, having spent a good 
amount of time punching sides of design 
beef and lifting crunchy keyswitch logs 
above its head, is ready to wade right into it. 
But does it have what it takes to knock out 
the muscular champions of the enthusiast 
market with this clean keyboard, or should 
it be fighting more dirty?
Let’s put that design on the canvas first 
of all. The keyboard base, more dense 
and weighty, at nearly 2.5lb, than it has 
any right to be, is topped with a generous 
slab of brushed 5052 aluminum alloy, a 
toughened corrosion-resistant mix. The 
metal is given a carbon-colored coating 
in the red-lit version tested here, and left 
silver—and accompanied by white LEDs—
in the alternate variant. It’s hard to argue 
that it doesn’t look damn sexy, particularly 
given the G413’s bezel-free floating keys, 
although the fact that it’s coated aluminum 
means it’s easily scratched, so don’t expect 
those looks to last forever. 
The business part of any mechanical 
keyboard 
is, 
naturally, 
the 
actual 
mechanics, and under the caps here 
we’re treated to Logitech’s proprietary 
Romer-G switches. The company makes 
some 
extravagant 
claims 
about 
its 
tech—up to 40% more durable than the 
leading competitor, for example—but 
it’s reasonable to expect that you’ll rub 
through the keycap coating and the skin 
on your fingertips before you manage 
to hit 70 million keypresses. What 
counts is how the switches work, and 
they’re absolutely fine. They’re silent 
in themselves, consisting of a sprung, 
hollowed-out upper, with a reasonably 
stiff (but not tiring) 1.6oz resistance, and

there’s certainly a heartwarming amount 
of plastic on aluminum clatter (and a faint 
spring-ringing noise, which grates on the 
skull like chewing foil) when you truly 
get going. Travel is deep and satisfying, 
although light-fingered typists will revel 
in the minuscule sixteenth-of-an-inch 
actuation distance, which means even the 
lightest jab gets the job done. 
Those keys, lit by one red LED each, 
are slightly darker than their metalized 
plinth, for a subtle contrast, and bleed 
only the faintest glow beneath. The LED 
position, deep within the keyswitch itself, 
as opposed to the offset positioning 
necessitated by, for example, the central 
post design of Cherry MX switches, 
means keys are labeled in the middle, and 
fairly consistently lit. Disappointingly, or 
perhaps understandably, given the G413’s 
price point, there’s no way to selectively 
light individual keys, although Logitech is 
generous enough to include a key puller 
and a selection of beveled gaming keycaps, 
if that’s your thing. You’d best enjoy them, 
because the obscurity of these switches 
means you’re unlikely to find third-party 
replacements in the wild.
Enough of the brawn—what about the 
brain? There’s a game mode included to 
prevent accidental Windows key presses, 
media functions are tucked away via an 
Fn/F-key combo, and there’s variable 
brightness on the hardware itself. Teaming 
it up with the Logitech Gaming Software 
suite lets you set the LEDs breathing, 
flip the Fn activation, extend the blocked 
keys in game mode, and customize what 
Logitech calls the “G keys”—they’re the 
F-keys, guys, come on now—with whatever 
macros or keypresses you’d like. Profiles 
are included for a bunch of popular games, 
and it detects what you have installed to 
make it easier. It’s a shame customization 
couldn’t be taken further, though, because 
we’re not in the habit of reaching that far up 
the keyboard in clutch situations.
For $90, this is fit, and it’s ready. But it’s 
in such a quality mix—Corsair’s excellent 
$80 K63, HyperX’s $100 Alloy FPS, both 
of which offer slightly higher specs—that 
it’s going to have to scrap hard for your 
attention. The keyswitches are different 
enough from the ubiquitous Cherry MX 
range that it could well be worth a try, but 
be aware of its issues first. –alex Cox

Judging a book by its cover is, as your 
parents erroneously told you when that 
less-than-attractive 
classmate 
asked 
you to prom, a terrible mistake. This is 
conclusively proven by Corsair’s Glaive, 
which couldn’t seem more vanilla when 
sitting in the box, yet—unlike your 
awkward, nose-picking dance partner—
actually turns out to be damn good 
company, once it’s out in the world. 
The Glaive is, as is the law these days, 
full of RGB LEDs. It forgoes the desktop 
halo of the likes of the Razer Deathadder 
Chroma and Asus Gladius II, in favor of a 
three-zone configuration, which lights the 
logo, bands on either side of the palm edge, 
and a pair of front-mounted headlights. 
Each zone can be intricately, intimately 
configured, with gradient fades, rainbow 
effects, flashing colors, or anything you 
like, though you can’t make any zone 
display more than one color at once. The 
LEDs aren’t the brightest, but that suits; 
they’re placed in understated locations, 
and aren’t necessarily there to shout, more 
to whisper your love of colored peripherals.
The only other lights on the Glaive come 
in the form of the DPI markers, which show 
which of the five DPI levels you’ve selected. 
Unusually, these aren’t hard-coded into 
the unit, and can be individually configured, 
like the LEDs, in the Corsair Utility Engine 
2 software, which we should take a second 
to praise: It’s absolutely wonderful. 
Every manufacturer has a peripheral 
configuration app these days, and we’ve 
not seen one as easy to understand, or as 
deeply detailed, as Corsair’s. Good job. 
You can also use CUE 2 to configure 
each of the Glaive’s six buttons—even

is covered in a soft, almost velvety plastic 
coating—the kind that does degrade 
over time, so be wary—while the edges 
and notched wheel are clad in a textured 
rubber, which grips to your hand if you so 
much as look at it. 
What’s more, there’s a gimmick on offer 
here, and one that works: The panel on 
the left edge can be quickly replaced. Pull 
it off, select one of the alternatives, and it 
mounts itself back on via a combination 
of built-in neodymium magnets and a 
subtle alignment groove, giving you the 
option of a smooth, close-mounted panel, 
a textured and slightly wider panel, or a 
thumb-nestling extended curve. While 
you’re unlikely to need to change them in a 
hurry, the use of magnets rather than clips 
is a clever idea, because there’s nothing to 
really break.
It’s difficult to use anything other 
than superlatives to describe the Glaive. 
Perhaps, if you have very small hands, 
it might not suit your particular tastes. 
Maybe you like your lights more brash 
and eye-burning, or you’re already tied 
into another RGB ecosystem. You could be 
offended at spending $70 on a mouse. But 
on a comfortable, versatile mouse that will 
do everything, from desktop to gaming, 
exactly as you want it to? Well, that’s up 
to you. –alex Cox

Lizards and bats, together at last
Yooka-Laylee
NiNteNdo 64 owNers who played more 
than Mario Kart and WWF No Mercy may 
recall Banjo-Kazooie, in which a bear and 
a bird took on a witch. It sold nearly two 
million copies in the States, and spawned 
a couple sequels. Yooka-Laylee is Banjo’s 
spiritual successor, Kickstarted and made 
by a bunch of the same people.
So, instead of a bird and a bear we get 
a lizard and a bat, and instead of a witch 
there’s an anthropomorphic personification 
of the Marxist view of capital. Capital B (for 
Bourgeoisie? No, he’s a bee) isn’t wearing 
a top hat, but his shiny shoes, pin-striped 
suit, and bandit mask mark him out as the 
kind of corporate raider who’d take your 
grandmother’s savings in seconds. Aided 
by the nefarious Dr Quack, his latest raid 
has been on books, and it’s up to Yooka and 
Laylee to get them back by collecting quill 
pens and pages (the main goal), and blah 
blah blah, it’s all just a veneer to get you 
to jump, roll, and smash your way through 
various worlds. And an excuse for bad puns.
Which brings us to the dialog. In true 
Banjo style, voices are stylized as a series 
of grunts, while conversations play out in 
Ghost writers can be collected 
on each level for bonuses. 
Laylee clings to Yooka’s head, as if 
flying doesn’t come naturally to a bat. 
A central hub connects the worlds that 
are accessed through magic books.
A lot of effort has gone into filling 
the script with winks at the player.
has an impassable bit halfway up, leaving 
you wondering whether it’s a bug rather 
than an ability gate. Things could be clearer. 
And the camera could be better, too—the 
one thing most complained about in 3D 
platformers, it’s capable of guiding you off 
the edge of the level or refusing to let you 
look up to see what’s casting a shadow. 
There’s a lot going on in Yooka-Laylee. If 
it grabs you, there are five worlds’ worth of 
imaginative platforming (and a slippy-slidey 
ice world). For today’s gamers, however, it 
may be unfamiliar, and while it’s a shame 
that many may bounce off the game without 
discovering its enormous heart, it wouldn’t 
be entirely unexpected. –iaN eveNdeN
subtitles. This may be charming, but you 
waste time on dialog screens, even when 
clicking to make them go faster. It doesn’t 
help that clicking a character you’ve already 
spoken to replays the whole conversation. 
The script is knowing, self-referential, 
and comes close to the fourth wall on 
occasion—a pixelated dinosaur being asked 
if he’s in the right game, for example. 
Graphically, it’s sumptuous. Unlike the 
pursuit of the photoreal, cartoonrealism 
is a quest that repays explorers many 
times over, without falling into any uncanny 
valleys. But the worlds don’t hang together 
well. Anyone who heads off the path at the 
start of world one discovers a skeleton in a 
cooking pot. Fight off some easy enemies 
for him, and he tells you to come back 
later, when you’ve “expanded the world.” 
What? You don’t discover what this means 
until you’ve exited the level, and returned 
to the hub. Characters dotted around say 
they have no business with you, with no 
clue as to how you get their attention. 
Races seem unwinnable, but just require 
mastery of the game mechanics. A puzzle 
that lets you pass when the fire goes out

In space, no one can hear you scratch your head
The Signal From Tölva
The planeT Tölva has certainly seen some 
action. In addition to the recently wrecked 
frigate whose parts are scattered across 
its surface, there’s plenty of evidence of 
previous conflicts. Military bunkers are 
almost everywhere, and the remains of giant 
robots lie draped across the landscape.
Smaller robots swarm over it, too, and 
that’s where you come in. Drawn to the 
planet by a signal, you are patched into a 
Surveyor robot by a similarly cybernetic 
information broker, then left with a list of 
things to scan. Complicating matters are 
two other robotic factions: the Bandits and 
the Zealots. They exist mainly to harass you 
as you cross the eerie landscape, all broken 
rocks, angel-like insects, flying mantas, 
and areas gated by radiation, chemicals, or 
worse, which you need to level up to enter.
Increasing your rank, scanning objects, 
collecting resources, and blowing other 
bots into piles of bolts unlocks weapons 
and chassis modules for your robot. Not 
that you’re stuck with the same one: In a 
perfect amalgamation of the gaming tropes 
of infinite lives and fast travel, Tölva allows 
you to exit your bot, hacking into a new one 
game, feels like a tiny window into a larger 
universe, your presence just a cog in a 
bigger machine, in the same way your 
robot is laboring away to get a glimpse of 
something infinitely larger. The mystery 
is compounded by fragments of text that 
appear to point the way to the deeper 
mystery of the planet, and ghosts in the 
landscape that seem to be watching you.
Tölva is a shortish, deliberately paced 
game made by five people, its almost cel-
shaded graphics unlikely to trouble any 
recent GPUs, but it punches far above its 
weight in terms of mystery and atmosphere, 
even if it does take the mystery element 
slightly too far. –Ian evenden
The wreckage of several earlier 
civilizations litters the planet,

at spawn points across the map, with body 
modules and weapon loadouts unchanged. 
Giving up a weapon slot for a “phreaker” 
enables you to hijack allied robots and 
eventually head out as a pack of five, 
enough to take on the marauding gangs 
of enemy bots that stand between you and 
your scanning sites, or who occupy spawn 
points you want to capture. Your metal body 
feels heavy, feet slamming into the ground, 
and weapons kicking in a way that makes it 
clear you’re something large and metallic, 
blasting away with tremendous energy.
And it’s good stuff, this robot-blasting, 
but there’s very little driving you forward 
apart from the need to scan more objects. 
The narrative, which promises much with 
its mysterious setup, runs out of steam, and 
by the time you’re seeing either of the two 
endings, you may be left feeling as if you’ve 
missed something, some exposition speech 
or cutscene, that would fill in the gaps.
What you do get is a wonderful PDF in 
place of a manual, full of history and lore 
about a setting so rich it surely promises 
more games will be made within it. This,

Bo Moore, Technology ediTor
I’ve had a lIteral stack of laptops on my 
desk lately. I’m working on a large update 
to our online best gaming laptop buying 
guide, and that means calling in just about 
every portable gaming machine under 
the sun. But as the books piled up, and the 
benchmarks started running together, one 
thing in particular stood out: I’m incredibly 
impressed at how slim and trim gaming 
laptops have become.
Time was that for a laptop to have any 
sort of respectable pixel-pushing power, it 
meant that it also required a chassis that 
looked more like a Harrier jet exhaust than 
a notebook. These powerhouses pushed the 
envelope in terms of what could be called 
portable, and “laptop” was almost certainly 
a misnomer—I don’t know anyone who 
would actually sit one of those behemoths 
on 
their 
lap. 
However, 
things 
have 
changed. Perhaps it’s advances in cooling 
technology, perhaps it’s the lower TDP of 
Nvidia’s Pascal GPUs, but this generation of 
gaming laptops is thinner and lighter than 
ever before. Sure, most of them still aren’t 
exactly what you would actually classify as 
“thin and light”—that honor is still reserved 
for the lightweight notebook form factor. 
But a few millimeters more, and you have 
machines sporting GTX 1060s (sometimes 
even more powerful) that are more than 
capable of locking down 1080p @ 60fps 
or higher.
Even more, many of these machines have 
features previously reserved for the luxury 
of the desktop: displays with 120Hz refresh 
rates and G-Sync technology, or keyboards 
with mechanical switches and RGB lighting. 
And 
perhaps 
more 
impressive 
than 
anything, they don’t require some sort of 
Faustian bargain to purchase. OK, maybe if 
you want all those features in one, but there 
are many more than capable machines out 
now that don’t cost an arm and a leg—and 
most of them don’t even burn my lap.
Observations on a new generation of portable gaming
Laptops Galore
You 
want 
more 
threads? 
AMD has heard your pleas, 
and will be launching Ryzen 
Threadripper this summer. 
Based on its Epyc, aka Naples, 
server 
parts, 
Threadripper 
will launch with up to 16 cores 
and 32 threads. No details on 
pricing yet, but probably (a 
lot) more than $1,000. Intel’s 
answer is Skylake-X, which 
will hoist the Core i9 flag. Core 
Workstations, it transpires, 
aren’t easy to benchmark. 
We’re used to battling with 
desktop apps and games 
here, 
but 
finding 
quality 
workstation-level benchmarks 
proved tricky. The big problem 
is consistency. For instance, 
Kolor Autopano Giga 4.4.1 
was frustrating—it crashed 
several times, exacerbated by 
the number of images we had 
i9 will have up to 12 cores and 
24 threads on the top model. 
It will also feature a 1MB L2 
cache per core—four times 
the amount of the mainstream 
consumer parts. Both CPU 
lines will run on new platforms: 
X390/X399 chipsets and socket 
SP3r3 for AMD, and X299/
LGA2066 for Intel. I can’t wait 
to see these chips demolish 
our benchmark suite!
to work with, which saw whole 
days lost to benchmarking 
this one app. It did seem more 
consistent on Intel systems, 
although that’s a relative term, 
as we saw render times vary 
wildly, and it was only when 
checking the final image in 
Photoshop that we could be 
sure that it had completed 
properly. We got there in the 
end, but it wasn’t easy.

the hysterIa surrounding smartwatches 
has finally calmed to the point where we 
can start looking at them objectively. 
The potential for something like the 
Apple Watch is undeniable, but it seems 
realizing that potential is tougher than 
expected. Throw in the considerable 
$269 price, and it’s easy to see why such 
devices haven’t quite taken off.
We haven’t written off the genre, 
though, as the inclusion of the Xiaomi 
Mi Band 2 proves. Here’s a cheap and 
cheerful device that does so much 
well, that we can forgive it some of its 
shortcomings. True, it isn’t anywhere as 
versatile as some of the more expensive 
offerings, but what it does, it does well. 
Predominantly 
a 
step-counter 
and 
heart rate monitor, this is a smartwatch 
(it tells the time, too) that is light and 
comfortable, and IP67 splash resistant. 
It’ll also monitor your sleep patterns, 
although results vary. You can set it to 
alert you to messages, calls, or idleness, 
as well as specific app alerts, although 
its main use is as a step-counter.
The Mi Band 2’s pedometer algorithm 
does a good job of filtering out erratic 
movements and false starts, and has 
improved with the latest firmware 
updates. The Android app, Mi Fit, shows 
your activity in a clear and concise way, 
and synching is easy—although leaving 
Bluetooth on drained our smartphone’s 
battery. One of the most impressive 
aspects of the Mi Band 2, though, is the 
battery life—it lasts a month between 
charging. Seriously, a month. –ad

I 
recently 
had 
the 
pleasure of introducing 
old papa Storey to the 
wonders 
of 
Spotify. 
After 
him 
clamoring 
about “where exactly I import my music 
from nowadays,” I pointed him in the 
direction of my favorite streaming service. 
You may remember a while back, I was a big 
advocate of Tidal. Its FLAC quality audio was 
impressive. However, over time, two things 
put me off. First, a lack of Metallica, and 
second, the $20 a month for the HRA good 
stuff. I swapped to Spotify on a trial account 
to give it a shot, and haven’t looked back 
since. It’s a great service.
I pay $15 a month for the Family bundle, 
allowing myself and four others (people 
living at the same address) access to 
Spotify’s premium features, including high 
quality 320kb/s streams, offline downloads, 
and no adverts. I have a fairly hefty data 
plan on my Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge (4GB a 
month), so I stream all of my music directly, 
with nothing stored locally, saving storage, 
and the same goes for my desktops, both 
at work and at home. On top of that, I follow 
the artists I like, save the albums I love, and 
create and follow playlists I enjoy, all of it 
backed up in the cloud, ready to listen to on 
any device, anywhere in the world.

Dell Up3218K
What is actually driving 
the evolution of PC 
technology? 
High-res 
displays. 
Yup. 
When 
you think about it, 4K 
and now 8K displays are what’s pushing the 
boundaries of PC performance. To some 
extent, VR is helping out as well, but VR is 
really about the display, too.
I’ve been fortunate enough to bring in 
Dell’s new and insane 8K UP3218K, which is 
a big 32-inch panel sporting a jaw-dropping 
33 megapixels of screen real estate. At one 
point, viewing images off my Canon DSLR 
camera didn’t fit on my screen, but the Dell 
UP3218K will pretty much gobble up most 
digital files without having to zoom out. In 
fact, you can fit four 4K images comfortably 
on the UP3218K in their native size.
This screen is the sharpest, most 
lifelike, most vivid display I have ever used 
in my entire life. Everything looks hyper-
realistic—as though you’re looking through 
an actual window, to whatever it is that’s on 
the other side. The caveat, however, is finding 
8K content. It’s practically non-existent right 
now. With 4K-scaling turned on, though, the 
UP3218K is face-melting, in the best way 
possible. I have never looked at a better 
screen. If it came down to OLED or 8K for my 
PC? I’d go with an 8K display.

Liquid Lifespan
I am going to build an AM4 
PC. I planned to use a 
closed loop pre-filled liquid 
cooling system, and was 
very interested in the Silent 
PC article in the April 2017 
issue. Why did you use a 
liquid cooling system with 
a visible reservoir, that you 
had to fill? Am I making 
a mistake or overlooking 
something? I keep systems 
for five years or more. Is 
there an expected lifespan 
on liquid cooling tubing? 
 
–Charlie B
Reviews editoR Zak stoRey 
Responds: In regard to why 
we used an open loop, it 
comes down to surface area. 
For the everyday user, a 
closed loop AIO is perfect. 
It’s easy to install, comes 
with a hefty warranty, 
is low maintenance, and 
packs substantial cooling 
potential. However, you're 
limited by surface area. All 
cooling—whether you're 
using an air tower for 
your CPU, a blower-style 
graphics card, an AIO liquid 
cooler, or even a passive 
cooling solution—works off 
total surface area. In short, 
cooling operates via the 
transfer of heat from one 
place to another. For a PC, 
that’s moving heat from a 
processor to an array of fins 
to expel that heat into the 
surrounding air. With an air 
cooler, heat pipes transfer 
water vapor from the hot 
processor by convection to 
the fins, where it’s cooled, 
forms a liquid, and goes 
back round and down to 
the processor to start the 
process again, drawing heat 
away from your CPU.
Liquid cooling operates 
on much the same principle, 
except the volumes are 
increased. Instead of water 
vapor and convection, a 
pump moves fluid past the 
processor, drawing heat out 
of the CPU and waterblock, 
to the radiators, where it’s 
cooled by fans, then sent 
back to the CPU to repeat 
the process. The more 
radiators, and the bigger 
they are, the more heat you 
can expel out of them, and 
the less heat you have in 
your processor and coolant.
For AIOs, you’re usually 
limited to 240 or 280mm 
radiators, 30mm thick, 
and capable of supporting 
two to four fans. However, 
with an open loop system, 
you can decide how big the 
radiators are, how thick you 
want them, and how many. 
Which is great for reducing 
processor temperatures, 
or in a loop where you 
have multiple GPUs. For 
instance, our water-cooled 
overclocking build from the 
July 2016 issue, at 4.8GHz, 
under load, would reach 
82 C under a 280mm AIO; in

How to maximize 
internet speeds 
wHen gaming 
witH a Vpn
With all the concerns about privacy on the 
Internet, it is easy to make the argument 
for a VPN (Virtual Private Network) to keep 
your data encrypted and safe. The general 
concern among gamers is that, aside from the 
disadvantages of cost and complexity, a VPN 
can cause a speed slowdown.
In our recent Best VPN for PC Gaming 
Guide, none of our tested VPN services 
provided full download speeds. So, in the 
end, it becomes a balance between speed 
and privacy, but there are some techniques to 
preserve throughput, and minimize lag. There 
 
are also some less obvious advantages to 
gaming on a VPN, such as having access to a 
better server, getting around countries that 
block certain games, protection from DDoS 
attacks on the game server, and avoiding 
getting your online Steam account hacked and 
exposing your credit card data. Read the full

our liquid-cooled PC, with 
two 240mm radiators, it 
would never go over 50 C.
The big downside is 
that a custom loop needs 
maintaining (coolant swap 
every 6–12 months), and it 
costs more to build. Then 
there’s human error, too….
Power of Levitation
Just wanted to post a 
tidbit about a great use 
for Corsair’s new maglev 
fans after reading your May 
issue on the subject. I’ve 
got an ASRock Z97x mobo 
inside an Air 540 chassis, 
and a plethora of fans. For 
whatever reason, the CPU_1 
and CPU_2 headers are 
both controlled by a single 
setting in the BIOS. Since 
I have an AIO cooler with 
a couple Venturi fans, I’m 
using the Silent profile in the 
BIOS. But, with all my other 
fans, and in the interest of 
tidy cables, I have to use the 
CPU_2 header for a couple 
intake fans, and here’s 
the kicker. If I put two of 
my Cougar Vortex 120s or 
Corsair AF 120s on the _2 
header, they don’t spin on 
the Silent profile. But the 
new ML fans do! The reduced 
physical resistance seems 
to be enough that it doesn't 
overwhelm the low power on 
this header at this setting.
So, now my Venturis and 
MLs are happily spinning at 
~800rpm, quiet as can be.

for the tip. We’ve had our

useful they really are at that

Bottleneck Highlight
In the Lab Notes section 
on pg. 92 of the April 2017 
Maximum PC, Bo Moore 
mentions that the Intel 
Pentium G4560 gives you 
just enough power to not 
bottleneck your graphics. 
How do you determine that? 
I've been reading your mag 
for years, but have never 
figured out what to look for 
in order to properly pair a 
CPU and GPU.   
–Rob Steck
executive editoR alan 
dexteR Responds: There are 
no hard and fast rules, but 
in specific cases you can tell 
whether you’re bottlenecked 
by the frame rate—once 
spotted, it’s a case of trying 
different graphics cards 
and processors to ascertain 
what’s holding you back. We 
can call on a bevy of CPUs 
and GPUs here that enable 
us to determine which 
games require more CPU 
power, and which demand 
more from the GPU. If 
there’s more interest in this 
topic, we can look at it in 
a future issue, as knowing 
which component is holding 
you back is essential when 
looking to upgrade for a 
particular task or game. 
Perfect Screen 
I am a heavy Photoshop 
and LightRoom user, and 
want to go 4K. That takes 
me down the professional 
monitor route. But I want 
to start gaming, too, so 
would love 4K in that world, 
so am studying the gaming 
monitors with G-Sync. I 
know that the gaming sweet 
spot is WQHD, 2560x1440, 
because it can be driven at 
165Hz. But I need 4K for my 
photography. What do you 
suggest? 
–Greg Johnson
Reviews editoR Zak stoRey 
Responds: I understand 
what you’re going through: I 
flit back and forth between 
panels. I did use a 28-inch 
4K Iiyama Prolite, which was 
stunning, but the TN panel 
is less than great for color 
accuracy, and 4K under 32-
inch is a bit hit and miss.
I’ve settled on a Samsung 
CF791. It’s a superwide, 
34-inch, curved, 3440x1440 
display, with FreeSync, and 
100Hz refresh. The best of 
everything in my opinion. 
It isn’t 4K exactly, but the 
extra screen real estate is 
useful, plus the VA panel is 
quantum dot, with an sRGB 
rating of 125 percent or 
something incredible.
Seek ’n’ Destroy
In “Recover your Data” in the 
Spring issue, it says, “If your 
hardware doesn’t matter, 
take a hammer to your 
drive.” It got me thinking 
how many old useless hard 
drives I have from retired 
builds: over 20. I found 
Ship’N’Shred—it couldn’t be 
simpler: Select the range 
of hard drives you want to 
get rid of, and it sends you 
a pre-paid FedEx shipping 
label, and the cost is very 
reasonable. Especially when 
you weigh it against 60 or 
more hours using an eraser 
CD or flash drive. –Ron Apra
executive editoR alan 
dexteR Responds: If time is 
precious, a service like that 
is worth considering. We’re 
big fans of destroying data 
ourselves here, though—
often unintentionally—so 
it only seems fair that we 
take it in turns with the 
lump hammer ourselves. 
We also get on with our IT 
team, which means we have 
no end of destruction at 
our disposal. 
After reading about several of your builds, I decided to do my 
own. I built it around a Core i7-6950X and two Titans (2016), 
with a custom cooling loop using marine-grade (316) 0.5-inch 
stainless, seamless tubing, and, of course, green coolant—
because why not? I went with stainless because it seems every 
backyard builder seems to be using clear hard tubing. I felt 
stainless gave the build a very different look and feel, and the 
acrylic GPU block/reservoir showed off enough of the green.

Ryzen Finally hits our mid-range build. We’ve been holding off for 
a while, but this combo is just right for a mid-range Ryzen system. 
Notable changes are the swap from the Core i5-7600K’s archaic four-
core design to the Ryzen 5 1400’s four-core, eight-thread (think Core 
i7-7700K). We’ve also included a slight increase to memory frequency, 
still touting that G.Skill love, reason being that Ryzen seems to 
be more stable at 2,666 than 2,400. Outside of the obvious jump in 
processor prowess, the biggest change comes from the primary 
storage. Swapping out Intel’s 600P M.2 PCIe SSD for a Samsung 960 
Evo set us back an additional $30, but doubled our read speeds, and 
tripled the write speeds, for roughly the same amount of storage. 
One thing to note is that you have to buy the correct cooler mounting 
bracket for the AM4 socket separately from Corsair. You can find the 
link on Newegg’s Corsair H100i V2 product page.
Until Ryzen 3 drops, we’re sticking with Intel for our budget 
offering. It still feels weird to say that. We saw memory creep ever 
higher this issue, so the budget build got a butchering. We swapped 
out the Pentium G4600 for a G4560, as it only loses out a touch on 
clock speed, and saves us a sweet $20. Next up for the chop was the 
1060. We went for a slightly lower specced 1050 Ti from Gigabyte, 
saving $45. Although we have reservations about the 1050 Ti as an 
upgrade over last generation, it’s still a solid 1080p GPU. Again, we 
decided to swap out storage, dropping the 240GB SSD for a 120GB 
model, enough for the OS and critical apps, while swapping to a WD 
1TB Green 7,200rpm drive, which saved a substantial chunk. You 
could make the build even cheaper by ditching the B250i PRO ITX, 
and going for something like an H110. But those boards need a BIOS 
update (requiring a Skylake CPU) to even recognize your new chip.

this coUld be the last time we see the turbo build in its current form. 
Ryzen brought multicore performance to the masses, but its life as 
top dog may be coming to an end. With rumors of Skylake-X and AMD’s 
Threadripper dropping some time after Computex, we may finally 
see a return to HEDT platforms, with oodles of PCIe lanes, masses of 
cores, and hopefully some competition at the high end.
That said, we’ve still got to give credit to our build up top. The Ryzen 
1800X is the one that started it all, and the true trooper in this build. 
Eight cores, 16 threads, and a handy dandy 24 PCIe lanes make this one 
dishy offering for any would-be streamer or workstation professional. 
We did manage to make a few neat savings—amazingly, one of those 
is in the memory department. Swapping out from HyperX Savage DDR4 
to Corsair Vengeance LED DDR4 saved us $23 for almost identically 
specced memory. And we got frilly LED lighting and everything. We’re 
not a fan of RGB lighting, but crisp white lighting is ideal for anyone 
looking to bring attention to their tempered glass interior. On top of 
that, we dropped the PSU down by 100W, bringing the price down by 
another $10, and there’s a solid deal available on a Gigabyte 1080 Ti FE, 
too, saving another $10. It may not be as substantial a set of changes 
as we’ve seen in the mid-range or budget systems, but it goes to show 
that if you search around and do some tweaking, you can refine a build, 
cutting costs, without sacrificing performance.

Storage is one of the most 
noticeable 
upgrades 
you 
can 
make to a system. Going from an 
HDD to an SSD for your OS is an 
almost euphoric experience, as 
long load times become a distant 
memory. Going from an SSD to a 
PCIe SSD, though? Well, that’s an 
entirely different shift, because it 
becomes less about those instant 
boot times, and more about file 
transfers. Moving them across 
from one part of the drive is 
almost as satisfying as watching 
those boot times disappear, and 
Samsung’s 960 Evo is a great entry 
point into the future of M.2 PCIe 
storage solutions.
