Thanks to my family and friends for their support, encouragement, and patience. Special acknowledgement goes to my

We dedicate this book to the memory of Thomas J. Cashman (4/29/32 – 1/7/15). As one of the founders of the  
Shelly Cashman Series, Tom partnered with Gary Shelly to write and publish their first computer education  
textbook in 1969, revolutionizing the introductory computing course and changing the path of computing  
course materials. From 1969 through his retirement in 2008, Tom served as educator, author, leader,  
and inspiration to his fellow authors and Shelly Cashman Series team members. His mark on the series  
and the introductory computing market is indelible and he will be both remembered and missed.

Gaming and Digital 
Home
Academic researchers developed the first video games 
in the 1950s as part of their studies of  artificial 
 intelligence and simulations, and their work was 
applied and expanded commercially to early home 
consoles and arcade games. The concept of home auto-
mation can be traced back to 1898 when Nikola Tesla 
invented the first remote control. The following sections 
describe how these two technologies are used today.
Gaming
Video gamers spend billions of dollars each year 
 making the most of their downtime with game consoles 
and devices, with an estimated 5 billion people world-
wide playing at least 45 hours per week. The popularity 
is due, in large part, to the social aspect of gathering 
families and friends to play together as a group or 
online with each other and those around the world. The 
wide variety of categories offers a gaming experience 
for practically everyone in genres such as adventure, 
 education, fitness, puzzles, sports, role-playing, and 
simulation.
• Obtaining Games: Gamers have several options 
available for locating games. For tablets and smart-
phones, they can download games from an app store to 
a mobile computer or device. For game consoles, they 
can purchase or rent discs or other media that contain 
games; download or transfer them from online stores; or 
sign up for cloud services that stream or transfer games 
on demand.
• Accessories and Input Techniques: The more 
popular game consoles work with a wide variety 
of accessories and input techniques for directing 
movements and actions of on-screen players and 
objects. They include gamepads, voice commands, 
and fitness accessories, some of which are shown 
here. Although many games are played using a 
controller, several systems operate by allowing the 
player to be the controller.
Home Automation
New home builders and existing homeowners are 
integrating features that automate a wide variety of 
tasks, save time and money, and enhance the overall 
at-home environment.
• Lighting: Controlling lighting is one of the more 
common uses of technology in the home. Remotes 
turn light fixtures on and off, and motion sensors 
turn on lights when a car or a visitor approaches the 
driveway or walkway.
• Thermostats: Programmable thermostats adjust to 
seasonal needs and can be set to control temperatures 
in individual rooms. Homeowners can use their smart-
phones to monitor heating and cooling systems, adjust 
temperatures, and manage energy consumption.
• Appliances: Smart appliances, such as  dishwashers, 
can be programmed to run at nonpeak electrical 
times. Coffeemakers can turn on at set times and 
shut off if an overheating coffeepot has been left on 
accidentally. Refrigerators can track expiration 
dates and create shopping lists.
• Security: Security systems can detect 
break-ins at doors and heat from 
fires, and they can send text and 
email messages to alert a 
homeowner when someone 
has entered or left the home. 
Surveillance cameras keep a 
watchful eye on the premises and 
interior rooms; homeowners can view the 
images on televisions and computers within the 
house or on a webpage when they are away from 
home, as shown in the figure.
• Remotes: Many people are turning to 
using their smartphones and tablets to 
control all the devices in the room. 
Users enjoy the convenience of cus-
tomizing apps to operate their tele-
vision, DVR, and security system 
and to perform other functions 
anywhere in the home.

Objectives
Today’s Technology
In the course of a day, you may . . . complete a homework assignment and watch a streaming 
video using your laptop, flip through news headlines and make dinner reservations using your 
tablet, search for directions and the local weather forecast while listening to music on your 
smartphone, edit a video on a desktop computer, and share photos online from your digital 
 camera with family and friends. These and many other technologies are an integral part of 
everyday life: at school, at home, and at work (Figure 1-1).
Technology can enable you to more efficiently and effectively access and search for 
 information; share personal ideas, photos, and videos with friends, family, and others; 
communicate with and meet other people; manage finances; shop for goods and services; 
play games or access other sources of entertainment; keep your life and activities organized; 
and complete business activities. People who can accomplish these types of tasks using 
technology often are said to be tech savvy.
Because technology changes, you must keep up with the changes to remain digitally literate. 
Digital literacy involves having a current knowledge and understanding of computers, mobile 
devices, the web, and related technologies. This book presents the knowledge you need to be 
digitally literate today.
As you read this first chapter, keep in mind it is an overview. Most of the terms and concepts 
introduced in this chapter will be discussed in more depth later in the book.

Shopping Safely Online
Browsing electronic storefronts and  making 
online purchases can be convenient and 
economical, but the experience can be a 
disaster if you encounter unscrupulous ven-
dors. These tips can help you enjoy a safe 
and productive online shopping trip.
• Read customer reviews. Shoppers 
frequently post comments about merchan-
dise quality, pricing, and shipping. Their 
evaluations may help you decide whether a 
company is legitimate. Be aware, however, 
that the Federal Trade Commission has 
sued companies for posting false positive 
reviews and that some companies remove 
negative comments. Make it a habit to rate 
merchants as often as possible so that oth-
ers can learn from your experiences.
• Look for seals of approval. Online 
 businesses can display seals if they have 
met rigorous standards. Some unscrupulous 
merchants, however, will place the seals on 
their websites even if they have not been 
approved. To check a seal’s legitimacy, tap 
or click the logo and be certain you are 
directed to the issuing agency’s website to 
verify the seal is valid.
• Create a strong password and 
 password questions. If the merchant 
requires you to create a user name and pass-
word, be certain to develop a long, complex 
password with at least eight characters 
that include letters, numbers, and special 
characters. (Refer to Secure IT 1-3 earlier 
in this chapter for guidance on creating a 
strong password.) The website also may ask 
for answers to security questions; if so, do 
not supply information that hackers could 
locate easily, such as your high school, place 
of birth, or family members’ or pets’ names.
• Check website details. Locate the 
business’s privacy policy to learn how your 
information will be stored. Also, look for 
phone numbers, physical addresses, and 
email addresses to contact the vendor if 
questions arise about damaged goods or 
billing discrepancies.
• Beware of requests to supply 
further information. After you have 
placed an order, you may receive an 
email message asking you to confirm 
the transaction or to supply additional 
 account information. A reputable busi-
ness will not solicit these requests, so do 
not reply to the message.
 Consider This: Have you made online 
purchases? If so, have you followed the pre-
cautions listed here? How will you change 
your activities the next time you shop online?
Purchasing from an Online Retailer
Step 3
The customer enters 
payment information
on a secure website. 
The online retailer 
sends ﬁnancial 
information to a bank.
Step 4
The bank performs 
security checks and 
sends authorization 
back to the online 
retailer.
Step 5
The online retailer’s web server
sends conﬁrmation to the customer, 
processes the order, and then sends
it to the fulﬁllment center.
Step 6
The fulﬁllment center packages the 
order, prepares it for shipment, and 
then sends a report to the server where 
records are updated.
Step 7
While the order travels to the customer,
shipping information is posted on the web.
Step 8
The order is delivered to the 
customer, who may be required
to sign a handheld computer or 
document to acknowledge receipt.
Step 2
The customer 
collects 
purchases in
a shopping cart.
Step 1
The customer 
displays
the online
retailer’s 
storefront.

Online Social Networks
An online social network, also called a social networking site, is a website that encourages members 
in its online community to share their interests, ideas, stories, photos, music, and videos with other reg-
istered users (Figure 1-29). Popular online social networks include Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn.
Some online social networks have no specialized audience; others are more focused. A photo shar-
ing site, for example, is a specific type of online social network that allows users to create an online 
photo album and store and share their digital photos. Similarly, a video sharing site is a type of online 
social network that enables users to store and share their personal videos. Read Ethics & Issues 1-2 
to consider whether you should be required to obtain permission before posting photos of others.

EthiCs & issuEs 1-2
Should You Be Required to Obtain 
Permission before Posting Photos 
of Others?
Your friends and followers on online social 
networks instantly can view photos you post. 
If others appear in the photo and you post it 
without their permission, they might feel you 
have violated their privacy. Tagging people in a 
photo may create a link to their social network 
profiles, exposing their identity. Depending on 
your privacy settings, your friends’ contacts can 
view a photo you post and/or share the photo 
without your permission.
You may be able to adjust tagging rules 
in the privacy settings of your online social 
network account. For example, you can use 
Facebook’s privacy settings to approve all 
photos in which others tag you. The person 
posting the photo still can upload the photo, 
but your tag will not be associated with the 
photo until you approve it. Facebook also 
allows you to report a photo as abusive if 
you feel it portrays you negatively or if the 
person who posted it refuses to remove it 
upon request. Facebook’s own Statement of 
Rights and Responsibilities states that “You 
will not tag users . . . without their consent.”
People may not want photos of themselves 
posted for a variety reasons. They may have 
professional contacts as friends on their online 
social network and do not want to show 
themselves in a personal setting. Others may 
not be concerned with personal photos of 
themselves but do not want their children’s 
photos shared online. Or, they simply may find 
the photo unflattering. A poll by Sophos stated 
that 80 percent of respondents consider 
asking before posting a photo to be common 
courtesy. Eight percent of respondents felt that 
it should be illegal to do so.
Consider This: Is it ever acceptable to post 
photos of others without permission? Why 
or why not? Has someone posted or tagged 
you in a photo that you did not want others 
to see? How did you handle the situation? 
If asked to remove a photo or tag, would 
you respect the person’s feelings and honor 
the request? What restrictions and policies 
should online social networks have about 
posting photos of others?

Health Care
You are out running on a beautiful day, 
 tracking your route and distance using a 
health and fitness app on a smartphone. While 
running, you accidentally step on uneven 
pavement and suffer an injury that requires a 
trip to an emergency room. Upon check-in, the 
employee at the front desk uses a tablet to 
record your personal data and symptoms. She 
also uses the tablet to verify that your insur-
ance coverage is current and informs you of 
your co-payment amount. After waiting several 
minutes, a triage nurse takes your temperature 
and blood pressure and then asks a series of 
questions about your symptoms. The nurse 
also records this data in a tablet and asks you 
to remain in the waiting room until someone 
from the radiology department is available to 
perform a CT scan. The radiology department 
is located in a different area of the hospital, 
so the technicians watch a computer screen 
that displays a list of patients who currently 
are waiting for their services.
About 30 minutes later, a technician calls 
your name and escorts you to the radiology 
department for your CT scan. As she is 
performing the scan, a computer records 
the images that later will be reviewed by a 
physician. When the CT scan is complete, you 
return to the waiting room until a physician 
reviews the results. Once she receives 
the results and reviews them, a hospital 
employee takes you to a consultation room.
The physician informs you that other than a 
few bumps and bruises, she believes that you 
have sustained no permanent damage and 
prescribes medication to help ease the pain. 
She then returns to a computer at the nurses’ 
station and adds her diagnosis to the database 
that stores your medical records. She also 
sends your prescription electronically to the 
hospital’s pharmacy. Once discharged, you visit 
the cashier to pay the bill. You then use a tablet 
to sign an electronic version of your discharge 
paperwork so that the hospital can store it 
electronically. 
The hospital 
bills your 
insurance 
company 
electronically. 
If you owe 
a balance 
after the insurance company pays its portion, 
a computer at the hospital will generate a bill 
that will be mailed to you. After purchasing 
your medication and leaving the hospital, you 
realize that despite the hospital being busy, 
computers decreased the time of your visit by 
automating processes that otherwise would 
have been performed manually and reduced 
possible errors by storing all of your personal 
information centrally.
 Consider This: How else might 
 computers and technology be used in the 
health care industry?

will run on your computer?
2.  Bad Directions You are driving to your friend’s house 
and are using your smartphone for directions. While 
approaching your destination, you realize that your 
smartphone app instructed you to turn the wrong way 
on your friend’s street. How could this have happened?
3. Bank Account Postings While reviewing your 
checking account balance online, you notice that debit 
card purchases have not posted to your account for

the camera shuts off automatically. What might 
be wrong?
Professional
6. Discarding Old Computer Equipment Your 
company has given you a new laptop to replace your 
current, outdated desktop. Because of the negative 
environmental impact of discarding the old computer in 
the trash, your supervisor asked you to suggest options 
for its disposal. How will you respond?
7. Dead Battery While traveling for business, you 
realize that you forgot to bring the battery charger 
for your laptop. Knowing that you need to use the 
laptop to give a presentation tomorrow, what steps 
will you take tonight to make sure you have enough 
battery power?
8. Cannot Share Photos You are attempting to send 
photos of a house for sale in an email message to your 
real estate partner. Each time you attempt to send 
the email message, you receive an automatic response 
stating that the files are too large. What are your next 
steps?
9. Incorrect Sign-In Credentials Upon returning to 
the office from a well-deserved two-week vacation, 
you turn on your computer. When you enter your

11. Technology in Health Care Your primary care physician is moving from a shared office so that he can open his 
own practice. He mentioned that he would like to use technology in his office that not only will improve the patient 
experience, but also make his job easier. Form a team of three people to determine the types of technology your 
doctor can use in his new office. One team member should research ways that technology can help improve patient 
check-in and billing. Another team member should research the types of technology your doctor can use while he is 
working with patients, and the third team member should research any additional technology that can be used in the 
office to improve the patient experience. Compile your findings in a report and submit it to your instructor.

Chapter 1 Introducing Today’s Technologies
1 Making Use of the Web 
Informational and Research
Informational and research websites contain factual 
information and include reference works such as 
libraries, encyclopedias, dictionaries, directories, and 
guides. More than 2.4 billion people worldwide use the 
Internet, and Google is one of the websites they visit 
most often. Google reports that people perform more 
than 100 billion searches every month using its Google 
Search. In How To 1 in the Succeeding in this Course 
chapter at the beginning of this book and How To 1-3 
in this chapter, you learned how to use a browser to 
display a webpage on a computer or mobile device and 
to perform a basic web search using a search engine.
Research This: Using a browser and search engine, 
find the answers to the following questions. (1) Search 
for the top five informational websites and top five 
research websites. What types of information or re-
search does each present? What search text did you use? 
(2) Visit Google’s website and locate the company’s early 
philosophy: “Ten things we know to be true.” What are 
five of these values? What is the goal of the “Made with 
Code” initiative? (3) Visit the Engadget website and read 
at least three reviews of tablets. Create a table listing 
the product name, price, battery life, pros, and cons. 
(4)  Locate articles about using hands-free devices for 
conversations while driving. Which states have passed 
legislation to restrict drivers’ use of hands-free devices 
while driving? Describe the features found in the sophis-
ticated hands-free system of one of this year’s vehicles.
2 Social Media
Online social networks are a central communications 
tool and the primary source of news and information 
for many people. Historians place the birth of online 
social networking with the BBS (Bulletin Board 
System), where users communicated with a central 
computer and sent messages to other BBS members 
and also downloaded files and games. The next phase 
of online social networks evolved when CompuServe, 
AOL (America Online), and Prodigy were among the 
services linking people with similar interests. Today’s 
online social networks share many of the same basic 
principles by allowing members to communicate 
common interests, play games, and share photos, vid-
eos, and music. Some of these online social networks 
are for personal use, while others are for entrepre-
neurs, business owners, and professionals to share 
job-related topics.
Research This: Compare the features of the top 
 personal online social networks, and create a table 
 listing the number of active members in the United 
States and worldwide, the number of years the sites 
have existed, the more popular features, and the 
amount of content, such as photos, news stories, 
and links, that is shared each month. What types of 
advertisements are featured in each of these sites? 
Which sites are marketed toward younger and older 
users? Then, research the online social networks used 
for business. How does their content differ from that 
found on the personal online social networks? How 
many companies use these sites as a recruiting tool? 
How many native languages are supported? How are 
professionals using these websites to find potential 
clients and  business partners?
3 Search Skills 
Selecting Search Terms
Search text that you send to a search engine, such 
as Google, Bing, or Yahoo!, impacts the quality of 
your search results. Rather than typing a long ques-
tion in the search box, you may improve your results 
if you select the question’s most important words as 
your search text. For example, instead of typing the 
Source: Google Inc.
Instructions: Use a search engine or another search tool to locate the information requested or answers to questions presented in the exercises. 
Describe your findings, along with the search term(s) you used and your web source(s), in the format requested by your instructor (brief report, 
presentation, discussion, blog post, video, or other means).
 Internet Research
The Internet Research exercises broaden your understanding of chapter concepts by 
requiring that you search for information on the web.

Internet Research exercises, which include Search Sleuth, Green Computing, Ethics in Action, 
You Review It, and Exploring Technology Careers.

Chapter 1 Introducing Today’s Technologies
Critical Thinking
4. Recommending Technology Solutions People use computers and mobile devices in a variety of fields, including 
travel, manufacturing, and more. Although the way people use computers and mobile devices varies, each use involves 
hardware, programs and apps, and some type of communications method, such as the Internet or cellular network.
Do This: Form a three-member team and choose a field in which you all are interested. Assign one member to 
investigate hardware, another to investigate programs and apps, and the third member to investigate communica-
tions methods used in the field. Locate user reviews and articles by industry experts. Each team member should 
develop a list of related items that may be used. After the investigation, create a hypothetical business or organization 
in the field. Recommend specific hardware, programs or apps, and communications capabilities that would be best 
for the network or organization. Include comparisons of specific items, as well as costs. Be sure to summarize your 
 investigations, describe the hypothetical business or organization, and outline and support your recommendations.
Instructions: Evaluate the situations below, using personal experiences and one or more resources available to you (such as articles on the web or in 
print, blogs, podcasts, videos, television, user guides, other individuals, electronics or computer stores, etc.). Perform the tasks requested in each exer-
cise and share your deliverables in the format requested by your instructor (brief report, presentation, discussion, blog post, video, or other means).
The Critical Thinking exercises challenge your assessment and decision-making skills by 
presenting real-world situations associated with chapter concepts. The Collaboration 
exercise should be completed with a team.
1. Reactions to Software Problems 
People who use computers and mobile devices 
sometimes experience problems with software, including 
operating systems, desktop apps, web apps, and mobile 
apps. Problems range from not being able to install or 
download the program or app to a computer or mobile 
device, to a program or an app producing unanticipated 
results. Depending on the situation, these problems 
can result in user stress. Many people believe reactions 
to software problems tend to be more extreme than 
reactions to problems with other tools.
Do This: Evaluate situations in which you have seen 
people react to program and app problems on their 
computers and mobile devices. Discuss how these users 
can reduce their frustration when dealing with such 
problems. Have you ever been frustrated by problems 
with a program or an app? How did you react? What 
did you do to solve the problem?
2. Energy Efficiency 
Increases in energy prices lead many individuals to 
look at purchasing energy-efficient computers and 
devices. Energy-efficient models often look and 
perform similarly to equivalent computers or devices 
that use more energy.
Do This: Find two computers or devices of identi-
cal configuration, where the only difference is energy 
consumption. How much energy does the energy-
efficient model save? Are energy-efficient computers 
and devices more or less expensive? Will the difference 
in cost (if any) affect your purchasing decision? How 
else might you be able to change your settings on your 
existing computer or device to save energy? Use the 
web to locate articles that recommend energy-efficient 
products and that  provide tips about additional ways to 
save energy.
3. Case Study
Amateur Sports League You are the new manager 
for a nonprofit amateur soccer league. The previous 
manager tracked all of the data on paper. You realize that 
using technology will increase your efficiency and enable 
you to communicate better with the board of directors, 
coaches, and players. At the board’s next meeting, you 
will share ideas of how you will use technology.
Do This: To prepare for the meeting, you compile the 
following: differences between input and output, a list 
of the types of data you can use as input, and a list of the 
types of information you can produce as output. You in-
clude the types of computers, mobile devices, and other 
technologies you will use to enter data and produce the 
information. Incorporate your own experiences and user 
reviews of the devices. Compile your findings.

Should You Be Required to Obtain 
Permission before Posting Photos 
of Others?
Your friends and followers on online social 
networks instantly can view photos you post. 
If others appear in the photo and you post it 
without their permission, they might feel you 
have violated their privacy. Tagging people in a 
photo may create a link to their social network 
profiles, exposing their identity. Depending on 
your privacy settings, your friends’ contacts can 
view a photo you post and/or share the photo 
without your permission.
You may be able to adjust tagging rules 
in the privacy settings of your online social 
network account. For example, you can use 
Facebook’s privacy settings to approve all
photos in which others tag you. The person 
posting the photo still can upload the photo, 
but your tag will not be associated with the 
photo until you approve it. Facebook also 
allows you to report a photo as abusive if 
you feel it portrays you negatively or if the 
person who posted it refuses to remove it 
upon request. Facebook’s own Statement of 
Rights and Responsibilities states that “You 
will not tag users . . . without their consent.”
People may not want photos of themselves 
posted for a variety reasons. They may have 
professional contacts as friends on their online 
social network and do not want to show 
themselves in a personal setting. Others may 
not be concerned with personal photos of 
themselves but do not want their children’s

Tips and Pointers  Intro Chapter  I-5 
Purchasing the Right Computer
As a student in a technology course, you might be thinking of purchasing a desktop, laptop, or 
tablet to help you with this course and future courses in your academic career. In addition to the 
information in this section, consider speaking with your instructors, as well as an academic advi-
sor, to see if they have any specific recommendations for computers or mobile devices you might 
use in the courses you plan to take. If your academic institution has a store that sells computers, 
it also might have specific computer or mobile device recommendations, as well as a student 
discount program. Make sure the computer or mobile device you purchase is capable of running 
the software that you will need for your classes.
Step 1: Choose the Computer Type
Laptops, tablets, and desktops each serve a different purpose. It is important that you choose 
the type of computer best suited to your needs. This section briefly describes and identifies some 
of the pros and cons associated with each type of computer. See Chapter 3 for a more thorough 
discussion of computer types.
Laptops  A laptop is a thin, lightweight mobile computer with a screen in its lid and a 
­keyboard in its base (Figure 4). Users who need or want to be able carry a computer from 
place to place may choose a laptop.
PROS
• Portable
• Uses less electricity than a desktop
• Contains a battery that can last at least several hours without being plugged in to an external 
power source
• Often more powerful than a tablet
• Contains several different types of ports
• All required components housed in a single unit (i.e., compact keyboard, touchpad, screen, 
speakers, etc.)
• Can support more types of external devices than tablets (i.e., full-sized keyboard, mouse, 
microphone, monitor, printer, scanner, webcam, speakers, etc.)
• Supports programs and apps specifically designed for desktops and laptops
• Can connect to a large monitor

I-6	   Intro Chapter   Succeeding in This Course
CONS
•  Might not be as powerful as high-end desktops
•  May not support as much memory and hard drive space as desktops
•  Contains fewer ports than desktops
•  May support fewer external devices than desktops
•  Not as easy for a user to upgrade or repair as desktops
•  May not be as portable as tablets
Tablets  A tablet is a thin, lightweight mobile computer that has a touch screen (Figure 5). 
Users who do not need the power of a laptop but require a portable computer for basic tasks 
may choose a tablet.
PROS
•  More portable than laptops
•  Lightweight (most tablets weigh less than two pounds)
•  Use less electricity than a desktop
• Battery life often is superior to laptops
• All required components housed in a single unit (touch screen, speakers, etc.)
• Can connect a removable keyboard
• Use thousands of free and fee-based apps
• Often are easier to use than desktops and laptops
• Built-in memory card slots can increase storage capacity
CONS
• Not as powerful as desktops and laptops
• Hardware cannot be upgraded
• Typically do not support the same types of apps as desktops and laptops
• Have limited multitasking capabilities
• More susceptible to damage because they frequently are moved from place to place
• Because a touch screen is the primary form of input, it may be difficult to enter large amounts 
of text on a tablet (unless an external keyboard is connected)
• Lack surface to rest wrists and arms, so ergonomic problems may develop
Desktops  A desktop is a computer designed to be in a stationary location, where all of its 
components fit on or under a desk or table (Figure 6). Users who may prefer desktops include 
those with basic home or office computing needs who do not require the portability of a mobile 
computer or those with high-end computing needs, such as 3-D gaming or HD video editing.

Tips and Pointers  Intro Chapter  I-7 
PROS
• Often more powerful than laptops and tablets
• Can connect to one or more large monitor(s)
• Contain several different types of ports or multiple duplicate ports
• Can accommodate more types of external devices than laptops and tablets (i.e., keyboard, 
mouse, microphone, monitor, printer, scanner, webcam, speakers, etc.)
• Often support more memory and hard drive capacity than laptops and tablets
• Support programs and apps specifically designed for desktops and laptops
• Relatively easy for a user to upgrade and repair
CONS
• Require several external, separate components, such as a keyboard, mouse, speakers, and 
sometimes the monitor
• High-end models can be more expensive than laptops and tablets
• Cannot run apps designed for mobile device operating systems, such as Android and iOS
Most students will find that a laptop or desktop is most suitable for their coursework or for 
gaming. In addition, they might choose a tablet to carry with them at other times because tablets 
are ideal for everyday tasks, such as searching the web, checking email messages, participating in 
video calls, and reading e-books.
Step 2: Choose the Operating System
An operating system is software (a program) that coordinates all the activities among 
­computer components. Multiple operating systems exist for each type of device (Table 1). 
Deciding which operating system is best for you will be the next step in determining the specific 
brand of computer that ultimately meets your needs.
Certain courses may require specific applications (apps), and those applications may be 
­available only on a specific operating system. For example, a course that teaches digital 
media might require an application that is available only for Mac OS. Table 2 illustrates the 
various categories of programs and apps. This section outlines the more common operat-
ing systems for each type of device. See Chapter 4 for a more thorough discussion of an 
­operating system.

I-8	   Intro Chapter   Succeeding in This Course
Laptops and Desktops  The two primary operating systems available on laptops and 
­desktops are Windows (shown in Figure 7) and Mac OS (shown in Figure 8). While other 
operating systems, such as UNIX, Linux, and Chrome OS also are available, Windows and 
Mac OS are the most common. Some computers can run multiple operating systems. For 
example, Apple computers can run Windows and Linux in addition to Mac OS. Windows and 
Mac OS each offer a unique user experience; the best way to determine which one you are 
most comfortable with is to try using each one. Most stores that sell laptops and desktops will 
have some working models that you can evaluate. Make sure the operating system you decide 
to use also is capable of running the programs and apps required for your courses.

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.

Tips and Pointers  Intro Chapter  I-9 
Tablets  Tablets often include one of three operating systems: Android (Figure 9), iOS 
(Figure 10), or Windows (Figure 11). While Android and iOS are the most popular ­operating 
systems on tablets, the Windows operating system is increasing in popularity. Determine 
the types of apps you wish to use on the tablet and then determine which operating systems 
­support those apps.
If you want your tablet to synchronize seamlessly with other computers and devices, such as 
a laptop, desktop, or smartphone, consider an operating system that is compatible with your 
other computer or device. For example, if you have an Android phone, you might prefer the 
Android operating system for your tablet. If you use an iPhone or iPod Touch, you might prefer 
the iOS operating system for your tablet.

Step 3: Choose Configuration Options
The final step in choosing the best laptop, tablet, or desktop to meet your needs is to choose 
the specific configuration details. For example, you may have to choose the size of the display, 
amount of memory, storage capacity, and processor speed.
Display Screen Size  Display screens for computers are available in a variety of sizes (Figure 12). 
A laptop’s screen typically can range from 11 to 17 inches, and a tablet’s screen generally is between 
7 and 12 inches. If you purchase a laptop or tablet, a smaller screen size will make the device lighter 
and more portable. For example, laptops with screens exceeding 15 inches typically are much 
heavier, which makes them less convenient to transport. Desktops often use a monitor as their dis-
play, with the size of screens on these monitors ­ranging from 13 inches to more than 30 inches.
If you primarily will be sending and receiving email messages, creating and editing documents 
using a word processing app, and browsing the web, a device with a smaller screen should meet 
your needs. If you require a larger screen to work with large documents or display multiple 
windows simultaneously, or if you want to experience less eyestrain with the contents appearing 
larger on the screen, consider a desktop or laptop display with a larger screen size. If you require 
touch functionality (and the operating system you plan to use supports it), purchase a screen that 
supports touch input. In addition, if you decide to purchase a laptop or desktop, you usually can 
connect a second monitor.

Memory  The amount of memory (RAM) installed in your laptop, tablet, or desktop will 
help determine the types of programs and apps that can run on the computer, as well as how 
many programs and apps can run simultaneously (Figure 13). If you are purchasing a lap-
top or desktop, review the system requirements for the programs and apps you plan to use, 
and make sure to purchase a computer with enough memory to meet those system require-
ments. For example, if the operating system you plan to use requires at least 4 GB (gigabytes) 
of memory, and you plan to use a word processing app that requires 4 GB of memory, you 
should purchase a laptop or desktop with at least 8 GB of memory. It is recommended that 
you purchase a computer with slightly more memory than you need at the present time. 
This enables you to use multiple programs and apps simultaneously and also accommodates 
­programs and apps you might install and use at a later time.

Tips and Pointers  Intro Chapter  I-11 
Storage Capacity and Media  Laptops, tablets, desktops are available with 
various storage capacities. The higher the storage capacity, the more data 
and information you can keep on the computer or device. To determine the 
ideal storage capacity, add together the amount of storage space required for 
all the programs and apps you want to use. In addition, estimate the amount 
of space you might need to store the files you create. If you are planning 
to store digital media, such as audio, photos, and videos, make sure the 
­storage device has sufficient space for those files as well. Try not to purchase 
a device with exactly the amount of storage space you anticipate needing. 
Always purchase more than you need so that you do not risk running out 
of space.
In addition to determining sufficient storage capacity for your needs, 
two main types of primary storage devices from which you may be able to 
choose include a hard disk (also called a hard drive) or an SSD (solid-state 
drive) (Figure 14). Hard disks use magnetic particles to store data, instruc-
tions, and information on one or more inflexible, circular platters. SSDs are 
flash memory storage devices that contain their own processors to manage 
their storage. Hard disks often are less expensive than SSDs and offer greater 
­storage capacities. SSDs, however, are faster than hard disks and may be less 
susceptible to failure.
Processor Speed  If you are purchasing a laptop or desktop, you probably 
will have to ­determine the processor that will best meet your needs. Many 
different brands and models of processors are available (Figure 15). Review 
the system requirements for the programs and apps you want to run to deter-
mine the ­processor best suited to your needs. Because a variety of brands and 
models of processors exist, you may find it difficult to decide which one to 
purchase. When you are shopping for your laptop, tablet, or desktop, ask a 
sales associate to explain the differences among the various processors so that 
you can make an informed decision.
Step 4: Choose the Purchasing Option
You can purchase new computers and mobile devices in physical stores as 
well as from online retailers. Each purchasing option has advantages and dis-
advantages, and it is important to consider these before making a purchasing 
decision. If, after reading this section, you still do not have a strong preference 
to purchase from a physical store or an online retailer, compare costs from each 
for a computer with an identical or similar configuration.
Physical Stores  A variety of computers and mobile devices are available for sale at physical 
stores. While physical stores offer the convenience of being able to shop for and bring home a 
computer or mobile device the same day, they have a limited inventory and available configu-
ration options. Computers and mobile devices in retail stores are prebuilt and often cannot be 
customized at the store. For example, if you evaluate the various computers at a physical store 
and see a laptop you are considering, that laptop may be available in only one configuration. If 
you want to make changes to the hardware configuration (such as adding a larger hard drive), 
that would need to be done by a third party after you make the purchase. Some computer and 
mobile device manufacturers may void their warranty if a third party upgrades your computer 
or mobile device after the purchase has been made, so be sure to purchase a computer that 
adequately meets your needs.

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.

 Online Retailers  Unlike physical stores, online retailers may offer greater configuration 
options for a computer or mobile device you are considering purchasing. For example, you 
may be able to completely customize a computer by choosing the exact processor, memory, 
and hard drive capacity. Online retailers also may offer prebuilt options, so consider the cost 
difference between purchasing a prebuilt computer and a customized computer with similar 
specifications. You may find that purchasing a prebuilt computer with a configuration slightly 
better than one you customized is less expensive. Prebuilt computers often may be less expen-
sive because they are mass produced. If you purchase a computer from an online retailer, how-
ever, you will not be able to see the computer and evaluate it before purchase. In addition, it 
may take several days to several weeks before computers and mobile devices purchased from 
online retailers may arrive on your doorstep. If you receive the computer or mobile device 
and do not like it, returning or exchanging it may not be as easy as if you were to purchase it 
in a physical store.

1	 Social Media
You likely have heard and seen the phrases, “Like us on 
Facebook” and “Follow us on Twitter.” Facebook and 
Twitter are two websites that advertisers, organizations, 
celebrities, and many groups use to promote and share 
their products, causes, events, and interests. Millions of peo-
ple have accounts on Facebook, Twitter, and many other 
websites known collectively as online social networks. You 
will learn about social media throughout this book and, in 
Chapter 1, will learn how to create Facebook and Twitter 
accounts. You then will view information on these websites 
and realize that social media can engage and connect the 
online social network community members effectively.
Research This: If you are signed in to your Facebook 
account, sign out. Run a browser and then navigate to 
www.facebook.com. What information is required to 
sign up for an account? Why does Facebook require a 
birthdate? Locate and then tap or click the About link. 
How many ‘likes’ does Facebook have? What is the 
content of the first post on this page? How many people 
‘liked’ this first post, and how many people replied to it?

2	 Search Skills 
Searching in an E-Book
One advantage that e-books have over printed books is 
that you can search the text to locate specific content eas-
ily. To search within an e-book, locate its search box, often 
identified by a ‘Search inside this book’ (or similar) label. 
Type the word or phrase for which to search, and tap or 
click a search button. The search button usually contains 
the word Search or the word Go, or displays a magnify-
ing glass icon. The reader will highlight or provide a list 
of occurrences where the search text appears within the 
e-book. You often can jump directly to the page where the 
word or phrase appears or tap or click buttons labeled Next 
or Previous (or displaying forward- and backward-pointing 
arrow icons) to navigate through the occurrences. Within 
the text, the key words appear highlighted.
A search box also may include options for narrowing 
down search results, such as limiting search results to a par-
ticular chapter. When you type a page number in a search 
box, some e-book readers will navigate to the location in 
the e-book corresponding to that page in the printed book.
Research This: Select any e-book to display on your 
computer or mobile device. Type a significant word from 
the title as your search text. Use the e-book reader’s search 
feature to answer these questions: (1) Where on the 
screen, and in what format, does the e-book reader display 
search results? (2) What information do search results in-
clude to help you find the result you are seeking? (3) How 
do you navigate from one occurrence of the search term 
to the next? (3) How does the e-book display your search 
text within the book so that you can locate it easily?
If you are reading the Discovering Computers e-book, 
display it on your computer or mobile device. Enter 
appropriate search text into the search box for the 
­Discovering Computers e-book reader to search for answers 
to each of these questions: (1) How many times does the 
word, Twitter, appear in Chapter 1? (2) Complete the 
sentence in Chapter 1 that begins, “Most e-book reader 
models have…” (3) What sentence contains the first 
­occurrence of the word, laptop, in Chapter 1?
If you read both the Discovering Computers e-book 
and another e-book, compare the experience using 
both e-book readers. Which features are common to 
both? What differences did you notice?
3	 Security
The buyer’s guide in this introductory chapter provides 
information you can use to purchase a laptop, tablet, or 
desktop. No matter which operating system you choose 
and how you configure the computer or device, you need 
to protect your investment from security risks. You will 
learn about these unwelcome intrusions, called malware, 
in Chapter 1 and throughout this book, but it is important 
to obtain malware protection when, or soon after, you 
purchase the computer or mobile device. You also should 
install the latest updates.
Research This: Visit a physical electronics store or 
view online retailers’ websites to learn about software 
that helps prevent malware from infecting computers. 
Read the packaging or the product details or talk to 
employees to determine the names of three programs 
recommended or rated highly. What protections against 
Internet threats are offered? For example, do they safe-
guard your photos, music, and financial data, include up-
dates and backup tasks, and offer parental controls? What 
is the cost, if any, of these programs and the updates? Do 
computer or mobile device manufacturers include this 
software with the original purchase? Which operating 
system is required? How much memory is required?
Instructions: Use a search engine or another search tool to locate the information requested or answers to questions presented in the exercises. 
Describe your findings, along with the search term(s) you used and your web source(s), in the format requested by your instructor (brief report, 
presentation, discussion, blog post, video, or other means).
 Internet Research
The Internet Research exercises broaden your understanding of chapter concepts by 
requiring that you search for information on the web.

Objectives
Today’s Technology
In the course of a day, you may . . . complete a homework assignment and watch a streaming 
video using your laptop, flip through news headlines and make dinner reservations using your 
tablet, search for directions and the local weather forecast while listening to music on your 
smartphone, edit a video on a desktop computer, and share photos online from your digital 
­camera with family and friends. These and many other technologies are an integral part of 
everyday life: at school, at home, and at work (Figure 1-1).
Technology can enable you to more efficiently and effectively access and search for 
­information; share personal ideas, photos, and videos with friends, family, and others; 
communicate with and meet other people; manage finances; shop for goods and services; 
play games or access other sources of entertainment; keep your life and activities organized; 
and complete business activities. People who can accomplish these types of tasks using 
technology often are said to be tech savvy.
Because technology changes, you must keep up with the changes to remain digitally literate. 
Digital literacy involves having a current knowledge and understanding of computers, mobile 
devices, the web, and related technologies. This book presents the knowledge you need to be 
digitally literate today.
As you read this first chapter, keep in mind it is an overview. Most of the terms and concepts 
introduced in this chapter will be discussed in more depth later in the book.

Chapter 1  Introducing Today’s Technologies
Computers
A computer is an electronic device, operating under the control of instructions stored in its 
own memory, that can accept data (input), process the data according to specified rules, produce 
information (output), and store the information for future use. Computers contain many electric, 
electronic, and mechanical components known as hardware.
Electronic components in computers process data using instructions, which are the steps that 
tell the computer how to perform a particular task. A collection of related instructions organized 
for a common purpose is referred to as software or a program. Using software, you can complete 
a variety of activities, such as search for information, type a paper, balance a budget, create a 
­presentation, or play a game.
One popular category of computer is the personal computer. A personal computer (PC) is a 
computer that can perform all of its input, processing, output, and storage activities by itself 
and is intended to be used by one person at a time. Most personal computers today also can 
­communicate with other computers and devices.
Types of personal computers include laptops, tablets, and desktops, with the first two 
­sometimes called mobile computers. A mobile computer is a portable personal computer, 
designed so that a user can carry it from place to place. A user is anyone who interacts with a 
computer or mobile device, or utilizes the information it generates.

resources to learn more about electronic 
­components and circuitry of a computer.
Laptops
A laptop, also called a notebook computer, 
is a thin, lightweight mobile computer with 
a screen in its lid and a keyboard in its base 
(Figure 1-2). Designed to fit on your lap and 
for easy transport, most laptops weigh up to 
7 pounds (varying by manufacturer and speci-
fications). A laptop that is less than one inch 
thick and weighs about three pounds or less 
sometimes is referred to as an ultrathin laptop. 
Most laptops can operate on batteries or a 
power supply or both.
Tablets
Usually smaller than a laptop but larger 
than a phone, a tablet is a thin, lighter-weight 
mobile computer that has a touch screen (read 
How To 1-1 for ways to interact with a touch 
screen). A popular style of tablet is the slate, 
which does not contain a physical keyboard 
(Figure 1-3). Like laptops, tablets run on bat-
teries or a power supply or both; however, 
batteries in a tablet typically last longer than 
those in laptops.

Interact with a Touch Screen
You usually can interact with a touch screen using gestures. A gesture is a motion you make on a touch screen with the tip of one 
or more fingers or your hand. Touch screens are convenient because they do not require a separate device for input. Tablets and 
­smartphones typically have touch screens.
The table below presents common ways to interact with a touch screen.

  Consider This: In addition to the motions listed in the table, what other motions do you think a touch screen should support?
© Cengage Learning
Consider This
If a slate tablet has no keyboard, how do you type on it?
You can use your fingers to press keys on a keyboard that appears on the screen, called an on-screen keyboard, or 
you can purchase a separate physical keyboard that attaches to or wirelessly communicates with the tablet. You 
also may be able to speak into the tablet, and your spoken words will translate to typed text.

Chapter 1  Introducing Today’s Technologies
Desktops and All-in-Ones
A desktop, or desktop computer, is a personal computer designed to be in a stationary 
­location, where all of its components fit on or under a desk or table. On many desktops, the 
screen is housed in a display device (or simply display) that is separate from a tower, which 
is a case that contains the processing circuitry (Figure 1-4a). Another type of desktop called 
an all-in-one does not contain a tower and instead uses the same case to house the display 
and the processing circuitry (Figure 1-4b). Some desktops and all-in-ones have displays that 
­support touch.

refer to an on-screen 
work area on laptops, 
tablets, and desktops.

Consider This
Which type of computer — laptop, tablet, or desktop — is best?
It depends on your needs. Because laptops can be as powerful as the average desktop, more people today choose 
laptops over desktops so that they have the added benefit of portability. Tablets are ideal for those not needing 
the power of a laptop or for searching for information, communicating with others, and taking notes in lectures, at 
meetings, conferences, and other forums where a laptop is not practical. Desktops and all-in-ones often have larger 
displays than laptops or tablets, which make them well suited for developing software, editing large documents, or 
creating images and videos.
 
Servers
A server is a computer dedicated to providing one or more services 
to other computers or devices on a network. A network is a collection 
of computers and devices connected together, often wirelessly. Services 
provided by servers include storing content and controlling access to 
hardware, software, and other resources on a network.
A server can support from two to several thousand connected 
computers and devices at the same time. Servers are available in a 
variety of sizes and types for both small and large business applica-
tions (Figure 1-5). Smaller applications, such as at home, sometimes 
use a high-end desktop as a server. Larger corporate, government, 
and web applications use powerful, expensive servers to support 
their daily operations.

When a computer or 
device connects to a 
network, it is said to be 
online.

Mobile and Game Devices
A mobile device is a computing device small enough to hold in your hand. Because of their 
reduced size, the screens on mobile devices are small — often between 3 and 5 inches.
Some mobile devices are Internet capable, meaning that they can connect to the Internet 
wirelessly. You often can exchange information between the Internet and a mobile device or 
between a computer or network and a mobile device. Popular types of mobile devices are smart-
phones, digital cameras, portable and digital media players, e-book readers, and wearable devices.
Consider This
Are mobile devices computers?
The mobile devices discussed in this section can be categorized as computers because they operate under the 
control of instructions stored in their own memory, can accept data, process the data according to specified rules, 
produce or display information, and store the information for future use.

 
Smartphones
A smartphone is an Internet-capable phone that usually also includes a calendar, an address 
book, a calculator, a notepad, games, and several other apps (which are programs on the smart-
phone). Other apps are available through an app store that typically is associated with the phone.
Smartphones typically communicate wirelessly with other devices or computers. With most 
smartphone models, you also can listen to music, take photos, and record videos.
Many smartphones have touch screens. Instead of or in addition to a touch screen, some 
smartphones have a keyboard that slides in and out from behind the phone (Figure 1-6). Others 
have built-in mini keyboards or keypads that contain both numbers and letters. Some are called 
a phablet because they combine the features of a smartphone with a tablet.

keyboard
Instead of calling someone’s phone to talk, you can send messages to others by pressing 
images on an on-screen keyboard on the phone, keys on the phone’s mini keyboard, or buttons 
on the phone’s keypad. Four popular types of messages that you can send with smartphones 
include voice messages, text messages, picture messages, and video messages.
• A voice mail message is a short audio recording sent to or from a smartphone or other mobile 
device.
• A text message is a short note, typically fewer than 300 characters, sent to or from 
a smartphone or other mobile device.
• A picture message is a photo or other image, sometimes along with sound and text, sent 
to or from a smartphone or other mobile device.
• A video message is a short video clip, usually about 30 seconds, sent to or from a smartphone 
or other mobile device.

Chapter 1  Introducing Today’s Technologies
Digital Cameras
A digital camera is a device that allows you to take photos and store the photographed 
images digitally (Figure 1-7). A smart digital camera also can communicate wirelessly with other 
devices and include apps similar to those on 
a smartphone. Many mobile computers and 
devices, such as tablets and smartphones, 
include at least one integrated digital camera.
Digital cameras typically allow you to review, 
and sometimes modify, images while they are 
in the camera. You also can transfer images 
from a digital camera to a computer or device, 
so that you can review, modify, share, organize, 
or print the images. Digital cameras often can 
connect to or communicate wirelessly with a 
computer, a Smart TV (discussed later in the 
chapter), a printer, or the Internet, enabling 
you to access the photos on the camera without using a cable. Some also can record videos. Many 
digital cameras also have built-in GPS (discussed later in this chapter), giving them the capability 
to record the exact location where a photo was taken and store these details with the photo.
Portable and Digital Media Players
A portable media player is a mobile device on which you can store, organize, and play or 
view digital media (Figure 1-8). Digital media includes music, photos, and videos. Thus, portable 
media players enable you to listen to music, view photos, and watch videos, movies, and televi-
sion shows. With most, you transfer the digital media from a computer or the web, if the device 
is Internet capable, to the portable media player. Some enable you to play the media while it 
streams, that is, while it transfers to the player.
Portable media players usually require a set of earbuds, which are small speakers that rest 
inside each ear canal. Some portable media player models have a touch screen, while others have 
a pad that you operate with a thumb or finger, so that you can navigate through digital media,

Read Ethics & Issues 1-1 to consider whether it should be legal to use a hands-free device, 
such as a smartphone, while driving.
Ethics & Issues 1-1
Should It Be Legal to Use a Hands-Free 
Device while Driving?
Your new vehicle includes a sophisticated 
hands-free system that enables you to connect 
a mobile device to the vehicle’s sound system. 
In addition to making phone calls without 
holding your device, you also can use this 
technology to read and respond to email mes-
sages or to update your Facebook status using 
speech-to-text, which converts your spoken 
words to text. Is this technology safe to use?
The debate about hands-free device 
safety elicits different points of view from 
vehicle insurance companies, consumer 
safety groups, and the telecommunications 
industry. AAA (American Automobile 
Association) conducted a study to measure 
the mental effect of using hands-free 
devices while driving. The conclusions 
indicated that drivers using hands-free 
devices are distracted, miss visual clues, and 
have slower reaction times. The report also 
stated that 3000 fatalities occur each year 
due to the use of hands-free devices.
Critics say that using a hands-free device 
gives people a false sense of security. Others 
claim that drivers can be just as easily 
distracted if they are discussing business or 
emotional matters with passengers in the 
vehicle. Some states have outlawed any 
use of mobile phones while driving; others 
require drivers to use hands-free devices 
while driving. Lawmakers are attempting to 
regulate “distracted driving” caused by using 
hands-free devices. One issue that remains 
unclear is whether law enforcement has a 
right to look at a user’s devices to determine 
whether they were used illegally.
Consider This: Do you think the govern-
ment should be able to establish rules 
about hands-free device usage while 
driving? Why or why not? Do you believe 
you are distracted if you use hands-free 
devices while driving? Why or why not? 
Do you think auto manufacturers should 
continue to put hands-free device technol-
ogy in vehicles? Why or why not?

E-Book Readers
An e-book reader (short for electronic book reader), or e-reader, is a mobile device 
that is used primarily for reading e-books (Figure 1-9). An e-book, or digital book, is an 
electronic version of a printed book, readable on computers and other digital devices. In 
addition to books, you typically can purchase and read other forms of digital media such 
as newspapers and ­magazines.
Most e-book reader models have a touch screen, and some are Internet capable. These 
devices usually are smaller than tablets but larger than smartphones.
Wearable Devices
A wearable device or wearable is a small, mobile computing consumer device 
designed to be worn (Figure 1-10). These devices often communicate with a mobile 
device or ­computer.
Wearable devices include activity trackers, smartwatches, and smartglasses. 
Activity trackers monitor heart rate, measure pulse, count steps, and track sleep 
patterns. In addition to keeping time, a smartwatch can communicate with a smart-
phone to make and answer phone calls, read and send messages, access the web, 
play music, work with apps, such as fitness trackers and GPS, and more. With smartglasses, a 
user looks into an eyeglass-type device to view information or take photos and videos that are 
­projected to a miniature screen in the user’s field of vision.

Chapter 1  Introducing Today’s Technologies
Game Devices
A game console is a mobile computing device designed for single-player or multiplayer 
video games. Gamers often connect the game console to a television so that they can view 
their gameplay on the television’s screen (Figure 1-11). Many game console models are 
Internet capable and also allow you to listen to music and watch movies or view photos. 
Typically weighing between three and eleven pounds, the compact size of game consoles 
makes them easy to use at home, in the car, in a hotel, or any location that has an electrical 
outlet and a television screen.
A handheld game device is small enough to fit in one hand, making it more portable than 
the game console. Because of their reduced size, the screens are small — similar in size to some 
smartphone screens. Some handheld game device models are Internet capable and also can 
­communicate wirelessly with other similar devices for multiplayer gaming.
Consider This
Are digital cameras, portable media players, e-book readers, and handheld game devices 
becoming obsolete because more and more smartphones and tablets include their  
functionality?
Many smartphones and tablets enable you to take and store photos; store, organize, and play or view your 
digital media; read e-books; and play games. This trend of computers and devices with technologies that overlap, 
called digital device convergence, means that consumers may need fewer devices for the functionality that 
they require.
Still, consumers may purchase separate stand-alone devices (i.e., a separate digital camera, portable 
media player, etc.) for a variety of reasons. The stand-alone device (i.e., a digital camera) may have 
more features and functionality than the combined device offers (i.e., a smartphone). You might want 
to be able to use both devices at the same time; for example, you might send text messages on the 
phone while reading a book on an e-book reader. Or, you might want protection if your combined device 
(i.e., smartphone) breaks. For example, you still can listen to music on a portable media player if your 
smartphone becomes nonfunctional.

Gaming and Digital 
Home
Academic researchers developed the first video games 
in the 1950s as part of their studies of ­artificial 
­intelligence and simulations, and their work was 
applied and expanded commercially to early home 
consoles and arcade games. The concept of home auto-
mation can be traced back to 1898 when Nikola Tesla 
invented the first remote control. The following sections 
describe how these two technologies are used today.
Gaming
Video gamers spend billions of dollars each year 
­making the most of their downtime with game consoles 
and devices, with an estimated 5 billion people world-
wide playing at least 45 hours per week. The popularity 
is due, in large part, to the social aspect of gathering 
families and friends to play together as a group or 
online with each other and those around the world. The 
wide variety of categories offers a gaming experience 
for practically everyone in genres such as adventure, 
­education, fitness, puzzles, sports, role-playing, and 
simulation.
• Obtaining Games: Gamers have several options 
available for locating games. For tablets and smart-
phones, they can download games from an app store to 
a mobile computer or device. For game consoles, they 
can purchase or rent discs or other media that contain 
games; download or transfer them from online stores; or 
sign up for cloud services that stream or transfer games 
on demand.
• Accessories and Input Techniques: The more 
popular game consoles work with a wide variety 
of accessories and input techniques for directing 
movements and actions of on-screen players and 
objects. They include gamepads, voice commands, 
and fitness accessories, some of which are shown 
here. Although many games are played using a 
controller, several systems operate by allowing the 
player to be the controller.
Home Automation
New home builders and existing homeowners are 
integrating features that automate a wide variety of 
tasks, save time and money, and enhance the overall 
at-home environment.
• Lighting: Controlling lighting is one of the more 
common uses of technology in the home. Remotes 
turn light fixtures on and off, and motion sensors 
turn on lights when a car or a visitor approaches the 
driveway or walkway.
• Thermostats: Programmable thermostats adjust to 
seasonal needs and can be set to control temperatures 
in individual rooms. Homeowners can use their smart-
phones to monitor heating and cooling systems, adjust 
temperatures, and manage energy consumption.
• Appliances: Smart appliances, such as ­dishwashers, 
can be programmed to run at nonpeak electrical 
times. Coffeemakers can turn on at set times and 
shut off if an overheating coffeepot has been left on 
accidentally. Refrigerators can track expiration 
dates and create shopping lists.
• Security: Security systems can detect 
break-ins at doors and heat from 
fires, and they can send text and 
email messages to alert a 
homeowner when someone 
has entered or left the home. 
Surveillance cameras keep a 
watchful eye on the premises and 
interior rooms; homeowners can view the 
images on televisions and computers within the 
house or on a webpage when they are away from 
home, as shown in the figure.
• Remotes: Many people are turning to 
using their smartphones and tablets to 
control all the devices in the room. 
Users enjoy the convenience of cus-
tomizing apps to operate their tele-
vision, DVR, and security system 
and to perform other functions 
anywhere in the home.

Chapter 1  Introducing Today’s Technologies
Data and Information
Computers process data (input) into information (output) and often store the data and ­resulting 
information for future use. Data is a collection of unprocessed items, which can include text, 
numbers, images, audio, and video. Information conveys meaning to users. Both business and 
home users can make well-informed decisions because they have instant access to information 
from anywhere in the world.
Many daily activities either involve the use of or depend on information from a computer. 
For example, as shown in Figure 1-12, computers process several data items to print information 
in the form of a cash register receipt.

STORAGE and PROCESSES
• Stores entered data. 
• Computes each item’s total price by  
 multiplying the quantity ordered by  
 the item price (i.e., 2 * 1.49 = 2.98).
• Organizes data.
• Sums all item total prices to   
 determine order total due   
 from customer (13.12).
• Calculates change due to customer  
 by subtracting the order total from  
 amount received (20.00 - 13.12 =  
 6.88).
• Stores resulting information. 
Step 1
Cashier scans or enters 
items purchased and the 
amount received from
the customer. These 
items are entered into
the computer as data.
Step 3
The resulting information 
(the cash register receipt) 
is printed for the 
customer.
Step 2
The computer receives the entered data, 
stores it, processes the data into 
information (the receipt), and stores the 
resulting information.

Consider This
Can you give another example of data and its corresponding information?
Your name, address, term, course names, course sections, course grades, and course credits all represent data that 
is processed to generate your semester grade report. Other information on the grade report includes results of 
calculations such as total semester hours, grade point average, and total credits.
 
Input
Users have a variety of input options for entering data into a computer, many of which 
involve using an input device. An input device is any hardware component that allows you to 
enter data and instructions into a computer or mobile device. The following sections discuss 
common input methods.
BTW
Mobile Computer Input
If you prefer a full-sized 
keyboard to a laptop’s 
keyboard or a tablet’s 
on-screen keyboard, 
you can use a full-
sized keyboard with 
your mobile computer. 
Likewise, if you prefer 
using a mouse instead 
of a touchpad, you can 
use a mouse with your 
mobile computer.

Keyboards  A keyboard contains keys you press to enter data and instructions 
into a computer or mobile device (Figure 1-13). All ­desktop keyboards have a 
typing area that includes letters of the alphabet, numbers, punctuation marks, 
and other basic keys. Some users prefer a ­wireless keyboard because it ­eliminates 
the clutter of a cord.
Keyboards for desktops contain more keys than ­keyboards on mobile 
­computers and devices. To provide the same functionality as a desktop 
­keyboard, many of the keys on mobile computers and devices serve two or 
three purposes. On a laptop, for example, you often use the same keys to type 
numbers and to show various areas on a screen, switching a key’s ­purpose by 
­pressing a separate key first.
Instead of a physical keyboard, users also can enter data via an on-screen 
­keyboard or a virtual keyboard, which is a keyboard that projects from a device 
to a flat surface.

Pointing Devices  A pointing device is an input device that allows a user to control a small 
symbol on a screen, called the pointer. Desktops typically use a mouse as their pointing 
device, and laptops use a touchpad (Figure 1-14).
A mouse is a pointing device that fits under the palm of your hand comfortably. With the 
mouse, you control movement of the pointer and send instructions to the computer or mobile 
device. Table 1-1 identifies some of the common mouse 
operations. Like keyboards, some users prefer working 
with a wireless mouse.
A touchpad is a small, flat, rectangular pointing 
device that is sensitive to pressure and motion. To 
control the pointer with a touchpad, slide your fin-
gertip across the surface of the pad. On most touch-
pads, you also can tap the pad’s surface to imitate 
mouse operations, such as clicking.

Chapter 1  Introducing Today’s Technologies
Voice and Video Input  Some mobile devices and computers enable you to speak data 
instructions using voice input and to capture live full-motion images using video input. With 
your smartphone, for example, you may be able to use your voice to send a text message, 
schedule an appointment, and dial a phone number. Or, you may opt for video calling instead 
of a voice phone call, so that you and the person you called can see each other as you chat 
on a computer or mobile device. As in this example, video input usually works in conjunction 
with voice input. For voice input, you use a microphone, and for video input you use a web-
cam (Figure 1-15).
A microphone is an input device that enables you to speak into a computer or mobile device. 
Many computers and most mobile devices contain built-in microphones. You also can talk into a 
headset, which contains both a microphone and a speaker. Many headsets can communicate wire-
lessly with the computer or mobile device. A webcam is a digital video (DV) camera that allows 
you to capture video and usually audio input for your computer or mobile device.
Figure 1-15  You can speak instructions into a microphone or wireless headset and capture live video on a webcam for a video call.

Scanners  A scanner is a light-sensing input device that converts 
printed text and images into a form the computer can process 
(Figure 1-16). A popular type of scanner works in a manner similar to a 
copy machine, except that instead of creating a paper copy of the docu-
ment or photo, it stores the scanned document or photo electronically.
Output
Users have a variety of output options to convey text, graphics, audio, 
and video — many of which involve using an output device. An ­output 
device is any hardware component that conveys information from 
a computer or mobile device to one or more people. The following 
­sections discuss common output methods.
Printers  A printer is an output device that produces text and 
­graphics on a physical medium, such as paper or other material 
(Figure 1-17). Printed content sometimes is referred to as a hard copy 
or printout. Most printers today print text and graphics in both black-
and-white and color on a variety of paper types with many capable 
of printing lab-quality photos. A variety of printers support wireless 
printing, where a computer or other device communicates wirelessly 
with the printer.

Displays  A display is an output device that visually conveys text, graphics, and video 
information. Displays consist of a screen and the components that produce the informa-
tion on the screen. The display for a 
desktop typically is a monitor, which 
is a separate, physical device. Mobile 
computers and devices typically inte-
grate the display in their same physi-
cal case (Figure 1-18). Some displays 
have touch screens.
Home users sometimes use a digital 
television or a Smart TV as a display. 
A Smart TV is an Internet-enabled  
high-definition television 
(HDTV) from which you can use 
the Internet to watch video, lis-
ten to the radio, play games, and 
communicate with others — all 
while watching a television show.

Chapter 1  Introducing Today’s Technologies
Speakers, Earbuds, and Headphones   
Speakers allow you to hear audio, that is, 
music, voice, and other sounds. Most per-
sonal computers and mobile devices have 
a small internal speaker. Many users attach 
higher-quality speakers to their computers 
and mobile devices, including game consoles.
So that only you can hear sound, you can 
listen through earbuds (shown earlier in this 
chapter in Figure 1-8) or headphones, which 
cover or are placed outside of the ear (Figure 
1-19). Both earbuds and headphones usually 
include noise-cancelling technology to reduce 
the interference of sounds from the surround-
ing environment. To eliminate the clutter of 
cords, users can opt for wireless speakers or 
wireless headphones. Read How To 1-2 to 
learn how to protect your hearing when using 
earbuds or headphones.
Consider This
What can you do to ease eyestrain while using a computer or mobile device?
Position the display about 20 degrees below eye level. Clean the screen regularly. Blink your eyes every five 
seconds. Adjust the room lighting. Face into an open space beyond the screen. Use larger fonts or zoom the 
display. Take an eye break every 30 minutes. If you wear glasses, ask your doctor about computer glasses.

Protect Your Hearing when Using 
Earbuds or Headphones
Using earbuds and headphones improperly 
can lead to permanent hearing loss. The 
following tips describe some ways to pro-
tect your hearing when using earbuds or 
headphones:
• If people standing next to you can hear 
the sound being ­transmitted through 
the earbuds or headphones you are 
wearing, decrease the volume until they 
no longer can hear it. The quieter the 
sounds, the less damage you will incur.
• If you intend to listen to music through 
earbuds or headphones for hours at a 
time, consider listening at only 30 percent 
maximum volume. Listening for extended 
periods of time at a high volume may be 
unsafe for your ears.
• Consider using a high-quality set of 
headphones. These ­headphones reduce 
your risk of developing hearing loss 
­because the sound quality often is better 
and does not require you to turn up 
the volume as loud. Also, their design 
is better, allowing a closer fit and thus 
reducing the necessary volume required 
for optimal listening.
• Consider using a set of earbuds or 
­headphones that reduce outside noise. When 
the earbuds or headphones eliminate the 
external noise effectively, they can reduce the 
volume level needed. The lower the volume 
levels, the less potential hearing damage.
  Consider This: Do you prefer earbuds 
or headphones? Why? Do you think you turn 
the volume up too loud while listening to 
music through earbuds or headphones?
How To 1-2
Memory and Storage
Memory consists of electronic components that store instructions waiting to be executed and 
the data needed by those instructions. Although some forms of memory are permanent, most 
memory keeps data and instructions temporarily, which means its contents are erased when the 
computer is shut off.
Storage, by contrast, holds data, instructions, and information for future use. For example, 
computers can store hundreds or millions of student names and addresses permanently. 
Figure 1-19  In a crowded environment where speakers are not practical, users 
can wear headphones to hear music, voice, and other sounds.

What is an external hard drive?
An external hard drive is a separate, portable, freestanding hard disk or SSD that usually connect to the computer 
with a cable (Figure 1-22). As with an internal hard disk or SSD, the entire external hard drive is enclosed in an 
airtight, sealed case.

A ­computer keeps data, instructions, and information on storage media. Examples of local 
­storage media includes hard disks, solid-state drives, USB (universal serial bus) flash drives, 
memory cards, and ­optical discs. The amount of storage for each type of storage media varies, 
but hard disks, solid-state drives, and optical discs usually hold more than USB flash drives and 
memory cards. Some ­storage media are portable, meaning you can remove the medium from 
one computer and carry it to another computer.
A storage device records (writes) and/or retrieves (reads) items to and from storage media. 
Storage devices often also function as a source of input and output because they transfer 
items from storage to memory and vice versa. Drives and readers/writ-
ers, which are types of storage devices, accept a specific kind of stor-
age media. For example, a DVD drive (storage device) accepts a DVD 
(­storage media).

media storage capacity.
Hard Disks  A hard disk is a storage device that contains one or 
more inflexible, circular platters that use magnetic particles to store 
data, instructions, and information. The entire device is enclosed 
in an airtight, sealed case to protect it from contamination. Laptops 
and desktops often contain 
at least one hard disk that is 
mounted inside the computer’s 
case (Figure 1-20).
Solid-State Drives  A solid-state drive (SSD) 
is a storage device that typically uses flash 
memory to store data, instructions, and 
information. Flash memory contains no mov-
ing parts, making it more durable and shock 
resistant than other types of media. For this 
reason, some manufacturers are using SSDs 
instead of hard disks in their laptops, tablets, 
and desktops (Figure 1-21).

Optical Discs  An optical disc is a type of storage media that 
consists of a flat, round, ­portable metal disc made of metal, 
plastic, and lacquer that is written and read by a laser. CDs 
(­compact discs) and DVDs (digital versatile discs) are two types 
of optical discs (Figure 1-25).
Cloud Storage  Instead of storing data, instructions, and 
information locally on a hard drive or other media, some users 
opt for cloud storage. Cloud storage is an Internet service 
that provides remote storage to computer users. For example, 
Figure 1-26 shows JustCloud, which provides cloud storage 
solutions to home and business users.
Types of services offered by cloud storage providers vary. 
Some provide storage for specific types of media, such as photos, whereas others store any 
content and provide backup services. A backup is a duplicate of content on a storage medium 
that you can use in case the original is lost, damaged, or destroyed. Read Secure IT 1-1 for 
­suggestions for backing up your computers and mobile devices.
USB Flash Drives  A USB flash drive is a portable 
flash memory storage device that you plug in a USB 
port, which is a special, easily accessible opening on a 
computer or mobile device (Figure 1-23). USB flash 
drives are convenient for mobile users because they are 
small and lightweight enough to be transported on a 
keychain or in a pocket.
Memory Cards  A memory card is removable flash 
memory, usually no bigger than 1.5 inches in height 
or width, that you insert in and remove from a slot 
in a computer, mobile device, or card reader/writer 
(Figure 1-24). With a card reader/writer, you can 
transfer the stored items, such as digital photos, from a memory card to a computer or printer 
that does not have a built-in card slot.

What is the general use for each type of local storage media?
Hard disks and SSDs store software and all types of user files. A file is a named collection of stored data, 
instructions, or information and can contain text, images, audio, and video. Memory cards and USB flash drives 
store files you intend to transport from one location to another, such as a homework assignment or photos. Optical 
discs generally store software, photos, movies, and music.

Backing Up Computers  
and Mobile Devices
Power outages, hardware failure, theft, 
and many other factors can cause loss 
of data, instructions, or information on 
a computer or mobile device. To protect 
against loss, you should back up the con-
tents of storage media regularly. Backing 
up can ­provide peace of mind and save 
hours of work attempting to recover 
­important material in the event of a 
­mishap.
A backup plan for laptop and desktop 
computers could include the following:
• Use a backup program, either included 
with your computer’s operating system or 
one that you purchased separately, to copy 
the contents of your entire hard drive to a 
separate device.
• Regularly copy music, photos, videos, 
documents, and other important items to 
an external hard drive, a USB flash drive, 
or a DVD.
• Subscribe to a cloud storage provider.
• Schedule your files to be backed up 
regularly.
Backup plans for mobile devices are 
less specific. Apps for backing up your 
smartphone or tablet’s content are 
available. You also can back up a mobile 
device to your computer’s hard drive using 
synchronization software that runs on 
your computer (synchronization software 
is discussed later in this chapter). Some 
mobile device manufacturers, such as 
Apple, provide cloud storage solutions to 
owners of their devices. Other services allow 
subscribers to use another computer as a 
backup storage location. Overall, the best 
advice is to back up often using a variety of 
methods.

People around the world access the web to accomplish the following types of online tasks:
• Search for information
• Conduct research
• Communicate with and meet other people
• Share information, photos, and videos with 
others
• Access news, weather, and sports
• Participate in online training
• Shop for goods and services
• Play games with others
• Download or listen to music
• Watch videos
• Download or read books
• Make reservations
The web consists of a worldwide collection of electronic documents. Each electronic document 
on the web is called a webpage, which can contain text, graphics, audio, and video (Figure 1-28). 
A website is a collection of related webpages, which are stored on a web server. A web server is a 
computer that delivers requested webpages to your computer or mobile device.
Webpages often contain links. A link, short for hyperlink, is a built-in connection to other 
­documents, graphics, audio files, videos, webpages, or websites. To activate an item associ-
ated with a link, you tap or click the link. In Figure 1-27, for example, tapping or clicking the 
audio link connects to a live radio show so that you can hear the broadcast. A text link often 
changes color after you tap or click it to remind you visually that you previously have visited 
the ­webpage or downloaded the content associated with the link.
Links allow you to obtain information in a nonlinear way. That is, instead of accessing topics 
in a specified order, you move directly to a topic of interest. Some people use the phrase surfing 
the web to refer to the activity of using links to explore the web.
A browser is software that enables users with an Internet connection to access and view 
­webpages on a computer or mobile device. Some widely used browsers include Internet 
Explorer, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and Google Chrome. Read How To 1 in the Succeeding in this 
Course chapter at the beginning of this book for instructions about using a browser to display 
a ­webpage on a computer or mobile device.
Consider This
Are the web and Internet the same?
No. The Internet provides more than three billion home and business users around the world access to a variety 
of services. The World Wide Web is one of the widely used services of the Internet. Other popular services include 
email, instant messaging, VoIP, and FTP (all discussed later in this chapter).

Web Searching
A primary reason that people use the web is to search for specific information, including text, 
photos, music, and videos. The first step in successful searching is to identify the main idea or 
concept in the topic about which you are seeking information. Determine any synonyms, alter-
nate spellings, or variant word forms for the topic. Then, use a search engine, such as Google, 
to help you locate the information. A search engine is software that finds websites, webpages, 
images, videos, news, maps, and other information related to a specific topic. Read How To 1-3 
for instructions about how to perform a basic web search using a search engine on a computer 
or mobile device.
Discover More: Visit this chapter’s free resources to learn more about search engines.
Perform a Basic Web Search
The following steps describe how to 
use a search engine on a computer or 
mobile device to perform a basic web 
search:
1.	 Run a browser. (For instructions on 
­running programs and apps, see How 
To 1-4 later in this chapter.)
2.	 Display the search engine’s webpage on 
the screen by entering its web address in 
the address bar. For example, you could 
type google.com to access the Google 
search engine, bing.com to access the 
Bing search engine, or yahoo.com to 
access the Yahoo! search engine.
3.	 Tap or click the Search box and then type 
the desired search text in the Search box. 
The more descriptive the search text, the 
easier it will be to locate the desired search 
results. As the figure shows, the search 
engine may provide search text suggestions 
as you type search text in the Search box.
4.	 To display search results based on your typed 
search text, press the enter key or tap or click 
the Search button. To display search results 
based on one of the ­suggestions ­provided 
by the search engine, tap or click the desired 
search text suggestion.
5.	 Scroll through the search results and then 
tap or click a search result to display the 
corresponding webpage.
6.	 To return to the search results, tap or click 
the Back button in your browser or on 
your mobile device, which typically looks 
like a left-pointing arrow.

Online Social Networks
An online social network, also called a social networking site, is a website that encourages members 
in its online community to share their interests, ideas, stories, photos, music, and videos with other reg-
istered users (Figure 1-29). Popular online social networks include Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn.
Some online social networks have no specialized audience; others are more focused. A photo shar-
ing site, for example, is a specific type of online social network that allows users to create an online 
photo album and store and share their digital photos. Similarly, a video sharing site is a type of online 
social network that enables users to store and share their personal videos. Read Ethics & Issues 1-2 
to consider whether you should be required to obtain permission before posting photos of others.

Ethics & Issues 1-2
Should You Be Required to Obtain 
Permission before Posting Photos 
of Others?
Your friends and followers on online social 
networks instantly can view photos you post. 
If others appear in the photo and you post it 
without their permission, they might feel you 
have violated their privacy. Tagging people in a 
photo may create a link to their social network 
profiles, exposing their identity. Depending on 
your privacy settings, your friends’ contacts can 
view a photo you post and/or share the photo 
without your permission.
You may be able to adjust tagging rules 
in the privacy settings of your online social 
network account. For example, you can use 
Facebook’s privacy settings to approve all 
photos in which others tag you. The person 
posting the photo still can upload the photo, 
but your tag will not be associated with the 
photo until you approve it. Facebook also 
allows you to report a photo as abusive if 
you feel it portrays you negatively or if the 
person who posted it refuses to remove it 
upon request. Facebook’s own Statement of 
Rights and Responsibilities states that “You 
will not tag users . . . without their consent.”
People may not want photos of themselves 
posted for a variety reasons. They may have 
professional contacts as friends on their online 
social network and do not want to show 
themselves in a personal setting. Others may 
not be concerned with personal photos of 
themselves but do not want their children’s 
photos shared online. Or, they simply may find 
the photo unflattering. A poll by Sophos stated 
that 80 percent of respondents consider 
asking before posting a photo to be common 
courtesy. Eight percent of respondents felt that 
it should be illegal to do so.
Consider This: Is it ever acceptable to post 
photos of others without permission? Why 
or why not? Has someone posted or tagged 
you in a photo that you did not want others 
to see? How did you handle the situation? 
If asked to remove a photo or tag, would 
you respect the person’s feelings and honor 
the request? What restrictions and policies 
should online social networks have about 
posting photos of others?

Internet Communications
As mentioned earlier, the web is only one of the services on the Internet. Other services on 
the Internet facilitate communications among users, including the following:
• Email allows you to send messages to and receive messages and files from other users via a 
computer network.
• With messaging services, you can have a real-time typed conversation with another connected 
user (real-time means that both of you are online at the same time).
• VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) enables users to speak to other users over the Internet 
(discussed further in later chapters).
• With FTP (File Transfer Protocol), users can transfer items to and from other computers on 
the Internet (discussed further in later chapters).
Digital Security and Privacy
People rely on computers to create, store, and manage their information. To safeguard this 
information, it is important that users protect their computers and mobile devices. Users also 
should be aware of health risks and environmental issues associated with using computers and 
mobile devices.
Viruses and Other Malware
Malware, short for malicious software, is software that acts without a user’s knowledge and 
­deliberately alters the computer’s or mobile device’s operations. Examples of malware include 
viruses, worms, trojan horses, rootkits, spyware, adware, and zombies. Each of these types of malware 
attacks your computer or mobile device differently. Some are harmless pranks that temporarily freeze, 
play sounds, or display messages on your computer or mobile device. Others destroy or corrupt 
data, instructions, and information stored on the infected computer or mobile device. If you notice 
any unusual changes in the performance of your computer or mobile device, it may be infected with 
­malware. Read Secure IT 1-2 for ways to protect computers from viruses and other malware.
Privacy
Nearly every life event is stored in a computer somewhere . . . in medical records, credit 
reports, tax records, etc. In many instances, where personal and confidential records were not 
protected properly, individuals have found their privacy violated and identities stolen. Some 
techniques you can use to protect yourself from identity theft include shredding financial 
­documents before discarding them, never tapping or clicking links in unsolicited email messages, 
and enrolling in a credit monitoring service.
Adults, teens, and children around the world are using online social networks to share their ­photos, 
videos, journals, music, and other personal information publicly. Some of these ­unsuspecting, 
­innocent computer users have fallen victim to crimes committed by dangerous strangers. 
Consider This
How do Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn differ?
With Facebook, you share messages, interests, activities, events, photos, and other personal information — called 
posts — with family and friends. You also can ‘like’ pages of celebrities, companies, products, etc., so that posts 
from others who like the same items will appear along with your other activities on Facebook. With Twitter, you 
‘follow’ people, companies, and organizations in which you have an interest. Twitter enables you to stay current 
with the daily activities of those you are following via their Tweets, which are short posts (messages) that Twitter 
users broadcast for all their followers.
On LinkedIn, you share professional interests, education, and employment history, and add colleagues or 
coworkers to your list of contacts. You can include recommendations from people who know you professionally. 
Many employers post jobs using LinkedIn and consider information in your profile as your online resume.

Protection from Viruses and Other 
Malware
It is impossible to ensure a virus or malware 
never will attack a computer, but you can 
take steps to protect your computer by 
­following these practices:
• Use virus protection software. Install a 
reputable antivirus program and then scan 
the entire computer to be certain it is free 
of viruses and other malware. Update the 
antivirus program and the virus signatures 
(known specific patterns of viruses) regularly.
• Use a firewall. Set up a hardware firewall 
or install a software firewall that protects 
your network’s resources from outside 
intrusions.
• Be suspicious of all unsolicited email 
and text messages. Never open an email 
message unless you are expecting it, and 
it is from a trusted source. When in doubt, 
ask the sender to confirm the message is 
legitimate before you open it. Be especially 
cautious when deciding whether to tap or 
click links in email and text messages or to 
open attachments.
• Disconnect your computer from the 
Internet. If you do not need Internet 
access, disconnect the computer from 
the Internet. Some security experts 
recommend disconnecting from the 
computer network before opening email 
­attachments.
• Download software with caution. 
Download programs or apps only from 
websites you trust, especially those with 
music and video sharing software.
• Close spyware windows. If you suspect 
a pop-up window (a rectangular area that 
suddenly appears on your screen) may be 
spyware, close the window. Never tap or 
click an Agree or OK button in a suspicious 
window.
• Before using any removable media, 
scan it for malware. Follow this procedure 
even for shrink-wrapped software from major 
developers. Some commercial software has 
been infected and distributed to unsuspecting 
users. Never start a computer with removable 
media inserted in the computer unless you 
are certain the media are uninfected.
• Keep current. Install the latest updates for 
your computer software. Stay informed about 
new virus alerts and virus hoaxes.
• Back up regularly. In the event your 
computer becomes unusable due to a 
virus attack or other malware, you will 
be able to restore operations if you have 
a clean (uninfected) backup.
  Consider This: What precautions do you 
take to prevent viruses and other malware 
from infecting your computer? What new 
steps will you take to attempt to protect your 
computer?
Secure IT 1-3
Creating Strong Passwords
A good password is easy for you to remember 
but difficult for criminals and password-
breaking software to guess. Use these guide-
lines to create effective, strong passwords:
• Personal information: Avoid using any 
part of your first or last name, your family 
members’ or pets’ names, phone number, 
street address, license plate number, Social 
Security number, or birth date.
• Length: Use at least eight characters.
• Difficulty: Use a variety of uppercase and 
lowercase letters, numbers, punctuation 
marks, and symbols. Select characters located 
on different parts of the keyboard, not the 
ones you commonly use or that are adjacent 
to each other. Criminals often use software 
that converts common words to symbols, so 
their program might generate the passwords 
­GoToSleep and Go2Sleep as possibilities to 
guess.
• Modify: Change your password frequently, 
at least every three months.
• Variation: Do not use the same 
­password for all websites you access. Once 
criminals have stolen a password, they 
attempt to use that password for other 
accounts they find on your computer or 
mobile device, especially banking websites.
• Passphrase: A passphrase, which is similar 
to a password, consists of several words sepa-
rated by spaces. Security experts recommend 
misspelling a few of the words and adding 
several numerals. For example, the phrase, 
“Create a strong password,” could become 
the passphrase, “Creaet a strang pasword42.”
• Common sequences: Avoid numbers or 
letters in easily recognized patterns, such 
as “asdfjkl;,” “12345678,” “09870987,” 
or “abcdefg.” Also, do not spell words 
backwards, use common abbreviations, or 
repeat strings of letters or numbers.
• Manage: Do not keep your passwords 
in your wallet, on a sheet of paper near 
your computer, or in a text file on your 
computer or mobile device. Memorize all 
of your passwords, or store them securely 
using a password management app on 
your computer or mobile device. Addition-
al information about password manage-
ment software is provided in Secure IT 5-3 
in Chapter 5.
• Test: Use online tools to evaluate 
­password strength.
  Consider This: How strong are your 
passwords? How will you modify your 
­passwords using some of these guidelines?
Protect yourself and your dependents from these criminals by being cautious in email messages 
and on websites. For example, do not share information that would allow others to identify or locate 
you, and do not disclose identification numbers, user names, passwords, or other personal security 
details. A user name is a unique combination of characters, such as letters of the alphabet or numbers, 
that identifies one specific user. A password is a private combination of characters associated with a 
user name. Read Secure IT 1-3 for tips on creating strong passwords.

Health Concerns
Prolonged or improper computer and mobile device use can lead to injuries or disorders of 
the hands, wrists, elbows, eyes, neck, and back. Computer and mobile device users can protect 
themselves from these health risks through proper workplace design, good posture while at the 
computer, and appropriately spaced work breaks.
With the growing use of earbuds and headphones, some users are experiencing hearing loss. 
Ways to protect your hearing when using these devices were presented in How To 1-2 earlier in 
this chapter.
Two behavioral health risks are technology addiction and technology overload. Technology 
addiction occurs when someone becomes obsessed with using technology. Individuals suffering 
from technology overload feel distressed when deprived of computers and mobile devices. Once 
recognized, both technology addiction and technology overload are treatable disorders.
Environmental Issues
Manufacturing processes for computers and mobile devices along with e-waste, or discarded 
computers and mobile devices, are depleting natural resources and polluting the environment. 
When computers and mobile devices are stored in basements or other locations, disposed of in 
landfills, or burned in incinerators, they can release toxic materials and potentially dangerous 
levels of lead, mercury, and flame retardants.
Green computing involves reducing the electricity consumed and environmental waste 
generated when using a computer. Strategies that support green computing include recycling, 
using energy efficient hardware and energy saving features, regulating manufacturing processes, 
extending the life of computers, and immediately donating or properly disposing of replaced 
computers. When you purchase a new computer, some retailers offer to dispose of your old 
computer properly.

Consider This
How can you contribute to green computing?
Some habits you can alter that will help reduce the environmental impact of computing include the following:
1.	 Do not leave a computer or device running overnight.
2.	 Turn off your monitor, printer, and other devices when you are not using them.
3.	 Use energy efficient hardware.
4.	 Use paperless methods to communicate.
5.	 Recycle paper and buy recycled paper.
6.	 Recycle toner, computers, mobile devices, printers, and other devices.
7.	 Telecommute.
8.	 Use videoconferencing and VoIP for meetings.

Programs and Apps
Software, also called a program, consists of a series of related instructions, organized for a 
­common purpose, that tells the computer what tasks to perform and how to perform them.
Two categories of software are system software and application software (or applications). 
System software consists of the programs that control or maintain the operations of the com-
puter and its devices. Operating systems are a widely recognized example of system software. 
Other types of system software, sometimes called tools, enable you to perform maintenance-type 
tasks usually related to managing devices, media, and programs used by computers and mobile 
devices. The next sections discuss operating systems and applications.

Operating Systems
An operating system is a set of 
­programs that coordinates all the activi-
ties among computer or mobile device 
hardware. It provides a means for users 
to communicate with the computer 
or mobile device and other software. 
Many of today’s computers and mobile 
devices use a version of Microsoft’s 
Windows, Apple’s Mac OS, Apple’s iOS, 
or Google’s Android (Figure 1-30).
To use an application, your computer 
or mobile device must be running an 
operating system.
Applications
An application (or app for short) 
consists of programs designed to make 
users more productive and/or assist 
them with personal tasks. Browsers, 
discussed in an earlier section, are an 
example of an application that enables 
users with an Internet connection to 
access and view webpages. Table 1-2

Chapter 1  Introducing Today’s Technologies
Applications include programs stored on a computer, as well as those on a mobile device or 
delivered to your device over the Internet.
• A desktop app is an application stored on a computer.
• A web app is an application stored on a web server that you access through a browser.
• A mobile app is an application you download from a mobile device’s app store or other location

Installing and Running Programs
Installing a program is the process of setting up the program to work with a computer or 
mobile device, printer, and/or other hardware. When you buy a computer or mobile device, it 
usually has some software, such as an operating system, preinstalled on its internal media so that 
you can use the computer or mobile device the first time you turn it on.
Installed operating systems often include applications such as a browser, media player, 
and calculator. To use additional desktop apps on a computer, you usually need to install the 
software. Mobile apps typically install automatically after you transfer the app’s files to your 
mobile device from its website. You usually do not need to install web apps before you can 
run them.
Once installed, you run a program so that you can interact with it. When you instruct a 
computer or mobile device to run a program, the computer or mobile device loads it, which 
means the program’s instructions are copied from storage to memory. Once in memory, the

computer or mobile device can carry out, or execute, the instructions in the program so that 
you can use it.
You interact with a program through its user interface. The user interface controls how you 
enter data and instructions and how information is displayed on the screen. Often, you work 
with icons or tiles (shown in Figure 1-30 earlier in the chapter), which are miniature images that 
link to programs, media, documents, or other objects. Read How To 1-4 for instructions about 
locating, installing, and running programs and mobile apps.
Locate, Install, and Run Programs 
and Mobile Apps
The following steps describe how to locate, 
install, and run programs and mobile apps:
Locate the Program or Mobile App
•	 Locate the program or mobile app to 
install. Programs are available from retail 
stores, websites, and from other online 
services such as Apple’s App Store or 
Google Play. Mobile apps are available 
from your device’s app store.
Download and/or Install the 
Program or Mobile App
•	 If you are installing a program on your 
computer from physical media such as 
a CD or DVD, insert the media in your 
­computer. If the installation process 
does not start automatically, locate the 
­installation program on the media and 
then ­double-tap or double-click the 
­installation program.
•	 If the program or mobile app is available 
from a website or online store, down-
load the application to your computer 
or mobile device. Once the download is 
complete, if the installation process does 
not start automatically, locate and then 
double-tap or double-click the down-
loaded file to begin the installation.
Run the Program or Mobile App
•	 You have various options for running a 
program or mobile app:
•	 If you are using a computer, tap or 
click the program’s tile or double-tap 
or double-click the program’s icon in 
the desktop.
•	 Display a list of all programs and 
apps on your computer or mobile 
device and then tap or click the 
icon representing the program to 
run (some computers may require 
you to double-tap or double-click 
the icon).
•	 Use the search feature in the 
­operating system to locate the newly 
installed program or app and then 
tap or click the search result to run 
the program or app.
  Consider This: After installing a mobile 
app, where are some locations you might 
look to find the new app’s icon or tile?
How To 1-4
Developing Programs and Apps
A software developer, sometimes called a developer or programmer, is someone who develops 
programs and apps or writes the instructions that direct the computer or mobile device to pro-
cess data into information. When writing instructions, a developer must be sure the program 
or app works properly so that the computer or mobile device generates the desired results. 
Complex programs can require thousands to millions of instructions.
Software developers use a programming language or application development tool to create 
programs and apps. Popular programming languages include C++, Java, JavaScript, Visual C#, 
and Visual Basic. Figure 1-31 shows some of the Visual Basic instructions a software developer 
may write to create a simple payroll program.
Consider This
How do you know if a program will run on your computer?
When you buy a computer, you can find a list of the computer’s specifications on the box, the manufacturer’s 
website, or the order summary. Similarly, when you buy software, the box or the product’s website will list 
specifications and minimum requirements for memory, speed, and more. Your computer’s specifications should 
be the same as or greater than the software specifications. Ensure the software will run on your computer before 
making a purchase, because many retailers will not allow you to return software.

Wired and Wireless Communications
Computer communications describes a process in which two or more computers or devices 
transfer (send and receive) data, instructions, and information over transmission media via a 
communications device(s). A communications device is hard-
ware capable of transferring items from computers and devices to 
transmission media and vice versa. Examples of communications 
devices are modems, wireless access points, and routers. As shown 
in Figure 1-32, some communications involve cables and wires; 
others are sent wirelessly through the air.
Wired communications often use some form of 
telephone wiring, coaxial cable, or fiber-optic 
cables to send communications signals. The 
wiring or cables 
typically are used within buildings or 
underground between buildings.
Because it is more convenient than 
installing wires and cables, many users 
opt for wireless communications, which 
sends signals through the air or space. 
Examples of wireless communications tech-
nologies include Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and 
cellular radio, which are discussed below:
• Wi-Fi uses radio signals to provide 
high-speed Internet and network 
connections to computers and devices 
capable of communicating via Wi-Fi.

Chapter 1  Introducing Today’s Technologies
Most computers and many mobile devices, such as smartphones and portable media players, 
can connect to a Wi-Fi network.
• Bluetooth uses short-range radio signals to enable Bluetooth-enabled computers and devices 
to communicate with each other. For example, Bluetooth headsets allow you to connect a 
Bluetooth-enabled phone to a headset wirelessly.
• Cellular radio uses the cellular network to enable high-speed Internet connections to devices 
with built-in compatible technology, such as smartphones. Cellular network providers use the 
categories 3G, 4G, and 5G to denote cellular transmission speeds, with 5G being the fastest.
Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are both hot spot technologies. A hot spot is a wireless network that 
­provides Internet connections to mobile computers and devices. Wi-Fi hot spots provide wire-
less network connections to users in public locations, such as airports and airplanes, train sta-
tions, hotels, convention centers, schools, campgrounds, marinas, shopping malls, bookstores, 
libraries, restaurants, coffee shops, and more. Bluetooth hot spots provide location-based ser-
vices, such as sending coupons or menus, to users whose Bluetooth-enabled devices enter the 
coverage range.

Networks
A network is a collection of computers and devices connected together, often wirelessly, via 
­communications devices and transmission media. Networks allow computers to share resources, 
such as hardware, software, data, and information. Sharing resources saves time and money. 
In many networks, one or more computers act as a server. The server controls access to the 
resources on a network. The other computers on the network, each called a client, request 
resources from the server (Figure 1-33). The major differences between the server and cli-
ent computers are that the server typically has more power, more storage space, and expanded 
­communications capabilities.
Many homes and most businesses and schools network their computers and devices. Most 
allow users to connect their computers wirelessly to the network. Users often are required to 
sign in to, or log on, a network, which means they enter a user name and password (or other 
credentials) to access the network and its resources. Read Ethics & Issues 1-3 to consider issues 
associated with unsecured networks.

Computers, Devices, and the Web  Chapter 1

Home Networks  Home networks save the home user money and provide many conveniences. 
Each networked computer or mobile device on a home network has the following capabilities:
• Connect to the Internet at the same time
• Share a single high-speed Internet connection
• Access photos, music, videos, and other content on computers and devices throughout the house
• Share devices such as a printer, scanner, or external hard drive
• Play multiplayer games with players on other computers and mobile devices in the house
• Connect game consoles to the Internet
• Subscribe to and use VoIP
• Interact with other devices in a smart home (such as thermostats, lighting controls, etc.)
Home networks usually are small, existing within a single structure, and use wireless 
­technologies such as those shown previously in Figure 1-30. You do not need extensive knowl-
edge of networks to set up a home network. You will need a communications device, such as 
a router, which usually includes setup instructions. Most operating systems also provide tools 
enabling you easily to connect all the computers and devices in your house.
Business Networks  Business and school networks can be small, such as in a room or ­building, 
or widespread, connecting computers and devices across a city, country, or the globe. Some 
­reasons that businesses network their computers and devices together include the following:
• Facilitate communications. Using a network, employees and customers communicate 
efficiently and easily via email, messaging services, blogs, online social networks, video calls, 
online meetings, videoconferencing, VoIP, and more.
• Share hardware. In a networked environment, each computer on the network can access the 
hardware on the network, instead of providing each user with the same piece of hardware. 
For example, computer and mobile device users can access the laser printer on the network, as 
they need it.
• Share data, information, and software. In a networked environment, any authorized 
computer user can access data, information, and software stored on other computers on the 
network. A large company, for example, might have a database of customer information that 
any authorized user can access.
Ethics & Issues 1-3
Would You Connect to an Unsecured 
Network?
If you turn on your laptop and notice that 
you can connect to a nearby home or busi-
ness’s wireless network and access the 
Internet without a password, for free, you 
may find yourself in an ethical dilemma. 
Because they do not know how to secure 
a wireless network, many home and busi-
ness users leave their networks open for use 
by anybody in their signal’s range. Experts 
estimate that up to 35 percent of wireless 
connections are unsecured, leaving them 
open to hackers. (A hacker is someone who 
accesses a computer or network illegally.)
Criminals sometimes use unsecured 
wireless networks to cover up technology-
related crimes. Others may steal connections 
to avoid the costs of Internet service. In other 
cases, a user’s laptop or mobile device may 
connect automatically to an open wireless 
network, without the user’s authorization or 
knowledge. If you are using an unsecured 
wireless network, hackers may be able 
to capture your passwords, hijack your 
accounts, or send spam or a virus.
The Electronic Communications Privacy 
Act (ECPA) states that it is not illegal 
“to intercept or access an electronic 
communication made through an electronic 
communication system that is configured so 
that such electronic communication is readily 
accessible to the general public.” It is unclear 
whether this law refers to an unsecured 
home network or whether it pertains only 
to public hot spots, such as restaurants and 
libraries. Some lawmakers even support 
punishing those who leave their networks 
unsecured.
Consider This: Would you use your 
neighbor’s unsecured wireless home net-
work without permission? Why or why 
not? What would you do if you found out 
that someone was using your wireless 
home network without your permission? 
How should legal authorities address such 
abuse? What punishment should violators 
receive? Should those leaving their net-
works unsecured receive punishment, too? 
Why or why not?

Chapter 1  Introducing Today’s Technologies
Staying in Sync
Assume that each morning you begin the day by check-
ing your appointment calendar on your home or office 
computer. That same calendar appears on your smart-
phone, so that you can view your schedule throughout 
the day. If you add, change, or delete appointments 
using the smartphone, however, you may need to 
update the calendar on your computer to reflect these 
edits. When you synchronize, or sync, computers 
and mobile devices, you match the files in two or more 
locations with each other, as shown in the figure below. 
Along with appointments, other commonly synced files 
from a smartphone are photos, email messages, music, 
apps, contacts, calendars, and ringtones.
Syncing can be a one-way or a two-way process. 
With a one-way sync, also called mirroring, you add, 
change, or delete files in a destination location, 
called the target, without altering the same files in 
the original location, called the source. For example, 
you may have a large collection of music stored on 
your home computer (the source), and you often 
copy some of these songs to your mobile device 
(the target). If you add or delete songs from your 
computer, you also will want to add or change these 
songs on your mobile device. If, however, you add or 
change the songs on your mobile device, you would 
not want to make these changes on your computer.
In two-way sync, any change made in one location 
also is made in any other sync location. For example, 
you and your friends may be working together to 
create one document reflecting your combined ideas. 
This document could be stored on a network or on 
cloud storage on the Internet. Your collaboration 
efforts should reflect the latest edits each person has 
made to the file.
You can use wired or wireless methods to sync. In 
a wired setup, cables connect one device to another, 
which allows for reliable data transfer. While wireless 
syncing offers convenience and automation, possible 
issues include battery drain and low signal strength 
when the devices are not close to each other. Strategies 
for keeping your files in sync include the following:
• Use a cable and software. Syncing photos from 
a camera or a smartphone to a computer frees up 
memory on the mobile device and creates a backup 
of these files. You easily can transfer photos using 
a data sync cable and synchronization software. Be 
certain not to disconnect the mobile device from the 
computer until the sync is complete. You also can 
copy your photos and documents from the computer 
to a smartphone, an external hard drive, a USB flash 
drive, or some other portable storage device.
• Use cloud storage. Cloud storage can provide a 
convenient method of syncing files stored on multiple 
computers and accessing them from most devices 
with Internet access. Several cloud storage providers 
offer a small amount of storage space at no cost and 
additional storage for a nominal fee per month or 
per year. Each provider has specific features, but most 
allow users to share files with other users, preview 
file contents, set passwords, and control who has 
permission to edit the files.
• Use web apps. By using web apps for email, 
contacts, and calendars, your information is stored 
online, so that it is accessible anywhere you have 
an Internet connection and can sync with multiple 
devices.

Technology Uses
Technology has changed society today as much as the industrial revolution changed society in 
the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. People interact directly with technology in fields such 
as education, government, finance, retail, entertainment, health care, science, travel, publishing, 
and manufacturing.
Education/Mini Feature 1-3: Digital School
Educators and teaching institutions use technology to assist with education. Most equip labs 
and classrooms with laptops or desktops. Some even provide computers or mobile devices to 
students. Many require students to have a mobile computer or mobile device to access the 
school’s network or Internet wirelessly, or to access digital-only content provided by a textbook 
publisher. To promote the use of technology in education, vendors often offer substantial stu-
dent discounts on hardware and software.
Educators may use a course management system, sometimes called a learning management 
system, which is software that contains tools for class preparation, distribution, and manage-
ment. For example, through the course management system, students access course materials, 
grades, assessments, and a variety of collaboration tools.
Many schools offer distance learning classes, where the delivery of education occurs at one place 
while the learning occurs at other locations. Distance learning courses provide time, distance, 
and place advantages for students who live far from a campus or work full time. A few schools 
offer entire degrees online. National and international companies offer distance learning training 
because it eliminates the costs of airfare, hotels, and meals for centralized training sessions.

book.
Digital School
Technology and education intersect in today’s classrooms. 
Students can use a variety of devices, apps, and websites 
to collaborate and obtain content while teachers can share 
information in most content areas to engage students 
and enhance the learning process. Digital ­technology 
offers flexibility and a revised classroom setting.
• Mobile devices and tablets: Schools are updating 
their computer labs by eliminating rows of desktops 
and allowing students to bring their own devices into 
the room and also into their classrooms, a practice 
often ­referred to as BYOD (bring your own device). 
They connect their laptops and mobile devices to 
power and data; they then they use educational 
apps, store and share files, read digital books, and 
create content without leaving their desks.
• Virtual field trips: Virtual tours of museums, 
ancient sites, and galleries allow audiences to see 
exhibits, examine paintings, and explore historical 
objects. After viewing 360-degree panoramas of 
such places as Colonial Williamsburg and Machu 
Picchu, students can interact with experts via Twitter 
and videoconferencing.
• Games and simulations: Game design ­theory 
can help engage students and reinforce key 
­concepts. When students master one set of 
­objectives in a particular topic, they can progress to 
more advanced levels. They can receive instant feed-
back and recognition for their accomplishments, 
collaborate with teammates, repeat play to achieve 
higher scores, and document their experiences. 
­Researchers claim that students are more likely to 
pursue challenging subject matter when it is offered 
in a gaming setting.
• Interactive whiteboards: 
Teachers and students 
can write directly on an 
interactive display, shown in 
the figure, which is a touch-
sensitive device resembling 
a dry-erase board. It displays 
images on a connected 
computer screen. Touch 
gestures are used to 
zoom, erase, and annotate 
displayed content.
• Share projects: Effective 
movies can bring the words 
in a textbook to life. Students can create scripts and 
then use animation software or a video camera to 
tell stories that apply the concepts they have learned

Chapter 1  Introducing Today’s Technologies
Government
Most government offices have websites to provide citizens with up-to-date information. People 
in the United States access government websites to view census data, file taxes, apply for permits 
and licenses, pay parking tickets, buy stamps, report crimes, apply for 
financial aid, and renew vehicle registrations and driver’s licenses.
Employees of government agencies use computers as part of their daily 
routine. North American 911 call centers use computers to dispatch calls 
for fire, police, and medical assistance. Military and other agency officials 
use the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s network of information 
about domestic security threats to help protect against terrorist attacks. 
Law enforcement officers have online access to the FBI’s National Crime 
Information Center (NCIC) through in-vehicle laptops, fingerprint 
readers, and mobile devices (Figure 1-34). The NCIC contains more 
than 15 million missing persons and criminal records, including names, 
­fingerprints, parole/probation records, mug shots, and other information.
Finance
Many people and companies use online banking or finance software to 
pay bills, track personal income and expenses, manage investments, and 
evaluate financial plans. The difference between using a financial institu-
tions’ website versus finance software on your computer is that all your account information is 
stored on the bank’s computer instead of your computer. The advantage is you can access your 
financial records from anywhere in the world.
Investors often use online investing to buy and sell stocks and bonds — without using a 
­broker. With online investing, the transaction fee for each trade usually is much less than when 
trading through a broker.
Discover More: Visit this chapter’s free resources to learn more about online investing.
Retail
You can purchase just about any product or service on the web, including groceries, flowers, 
books, computers and mobile devices, music, movies, airline tickets, and concert tickets. To pur-
chase from an online retailer, a customer visits the business’s storefront, which contains product 
descriptions, images, and a shopping cart. The shopping cart allows the customer to collect pur-
chases. When ready to complete the sale, the customer enters personal data and the method of 
payment, which should be through a secure Internet connection. Figure 1-35 illustrates the steps 
involved when a customer purchases from an online retailer.
Many mobile apps make your shopping experience more convenient. Some enable you to 
manage rewards, use coupons, locate stores, or pay for goods and services directly from your 
phone or other mobile device. Other mobile apps will check a product’s price and availability at 
stores in your local area or online. Read Secure IT 1-4 for tips about shopping safely online.

Shopping Safely Online
Browsing electronic storefronts and ­making 
online purchases can be convenient and 
economical, but the experience can be a 
disaster if you encounter unscrupulous ven-
dors. These tips can help you enjoy a safe 
and productive online shopping trip.
• Read customer reviews. Shoppers 
frequently post comments about merchan-
dise quality, pricing, and shipping. Their 
evaluations may help you decide whether a 
company is legitimate. Be aware, however, 
that the Federal Trade Commission has 
sued companies for posting false positive 
reviews and that some companies remove 
negative comments. Make it a habit to rate 
merchants as often as possible so that oth-
ers can learn from your experiences.
• Look for seals of approval. Online 
­businesses can display seals if they have 
met rigorous standards. Some unscrupulous 
merchants, however, will place the seals on 
their websites even if they have not been 
approved. To check a seal’s legitimacy, tap 
or click the logo and be certain you are 
directed to the issuing agency’s website to 
verify the seal is valid.
• Create a strong password and 
­password questions. If the merchant 
requires you to create a user name and pass-
word, be certain to develop a long, complex 
password with at least eight characters 
that include letters, numbers, and special 
characters. (Refer to Secure IT 1-3 earlier 
in this chapter for guidance on creating a 
strong password.) The website also may ask 
for answers to security questions; if so, do 
not supply information that hackers could 
locate easily, such as your high school, place 
of birth, or family members’ or pets’ names.
• Check website details. Locate the 
business’s privacy policy to learn how your 
information will be stored. Also, look for 
phone numbers, physical addresses, and 
email addresses to contact the vendor if 
questions arise about damaged goods or 
billing discrepancies.
• Beware of requests to supply 
further information. After you have 
placed an order, you may receive an 
email message asking you to confirm 
the transaction or to supply additional 
­account information. A reputable busi-
ness will not solicit these requests, so do 
not reply to the message.
  Consider This: Have you made online 
purchases? If so, have you followed the pre-
cautions listed here? How will you change 
your activities the next time you shop online?
Purchasing from an Online Retailer
Step 3
The customer enters 
payment information
on a secure website. 
The online retailer 
sends ﬁnancial 
information to a bank.
Step 4
The bank performs 
security checks and 
sends authorization 
back to the online 
retailer.
Step 5
The online retailer’s web server
sends conﬁrmation to the customer, 
processes the order, and then sends
it to the fulﬁllment center.
Step 6
The fulﬁllment center packages the 
order, prepares it for shipment, and 
then sends a report to the server where 
records are updated.
Step 7
While the order travels to the customer,
shipping information is posted on the web.
Step 8
The order is delivered to the 
customer, who may be required
to sign a handheld computer or 
document to acknowledge receipt.
Step 2
The customer 
collects 
purchases in
a shopping cart.
Step 1
The customer 
displays
the online
retailer’s 
storefront.

Chapter 1  Introducing Today’s Technologies
• Doctors use the web and medical software to assist 
with researching and diagnosing health conditions.
• Doctors use email, text messaging, and other 
communications services to correspond with patients.
• Patients use computers and mobile devices to refill 
prescriptions, and pharmacists use computers to file 
insurance claims and provide customers with vital 
information about their medications.
• Surgeons implant computerized devices, such as 
pacemakers, that allow patients to live longer.
• Surgeons use computer-controlled devices to provide 
them with greater precision during operations, such as 
for laser eye surgery and robot-assisted heart surgery.
• Medical staff create labels for medicine, hospital ID 
bracelets, and more, enabling staff to verify dosage 
and access patient records by scanning the label.
Entertainment
You can use computers and mobile devices to listen to audio clips or live audio; watch video clips, 
television shows, or live performances and events; read a book, magazine, or newspaper; and play a 
myriad of games individually or with others. In some cases, you download the media from the web 
to a computer or mobile device so that you can watch, listen to, view, or play later. Some websites 
support streaming, where you access the media content while it downloads. For example, radio and 
television broadcasts often use streaming media to broadcast music, interviews, talk shows, sport-
ing events, news, and other segments so that you can listen to the audio or view the video as it 
downloads to your computer. You also can create videos, take photos, or record audio and upload 
(­transfer) your media content to the web to share with others, such as on an online social network.
Consider This
Can I make copies of songs or other media that I have purchased and downloaded  
from a legitimate website, such as iTunes?
You typically can make a copy as a personal backup, but you cannot share the copy with others in any format 
unless you have legal permission from the copyright owner to do so. That is, you cannot give someone a CD copy, 
nor can you share a digital file by posting it on the web or sending it as an email message.

Health Care
Nearly every area of health care today uses computers. Whether you are visiting a family doctor 
for a regular checkup, having lab work or an outpatient test, filling a prescription, or being rushed in 
for emergency surgery, the medical staff around you will be using computers for various purposes:
• Hospitals and doctors use computers and mobile devices to maintain and access patient 
records (Figure 1-36).
• Computers and mobile devices monitor patients’ vital signs in hospital rooms and at home; 
patients use computers to manage health conditions, such as diabetes.
• Robots deliver medication to nurses’ stations in hospitals.
• Computers and computerized devices assist doctors, nurses, and technicians with medical tests.

Science
All branches of science, from biology to astronomy to meteorology, use computers to assist them 
with collecting, analyzing, and modeling data. Scientists also use the Internet to communicate with 
colleagues around the world. Breakthroughs in surgery, medicine, and treatments often result from 
scientists’ use of computers. Tiny computers now imitate functions of the central nervous system, 
retina of the eye, and cochlea of the ear. A cochlear implant allows a deaf person to distinguish

sounds. Electrodes implanted in the brain stop tremors associated with 
Parkinson’s disease.
A neural network is a system that attempts to imitate the behavior of the 
human brain. Scientists create neural networks by connecting thousands 
of processors together much like the neurons in the brain are connected. 
The capability of a personal computer to recognize spoken words is a 
direct result of scientific experimentation with neural networks.
Travel
Whether traveling by car or plane, your goal is to arrive safely at 
your destination. As you make the journey, you may interact with a 
navigation system or GPS, which uses satellite signals to determine a 
geographic location. GPS technology also assists people with creating 
maps, determining the best route between two points, locating a lost 
person or stolen object, monitoring a person’s or object’s movement, 
determining altitude, calculating speed, and finding points of interest. 
Vehicles manufactured today typically include some type of onboard 
navigation system (Figure 1-37). Many mobile devices, such as smart-
phones, also have built-in navigation systems.
In preparing for a trip, you may need to reserve a car, hotel, or flight. 
Many websites offer these services to the public where you can search 
for and compare flights and prices, order airline tickets, or reserve a 
rental car. You also can print driving directions and maps from the web.
Publishing
Many publishers of books, magazines, newspapers, music, film, and 
video make their works available online. Organizations and individuals publish their thoughts 
and ideas using a blog, podcast, or wiki.
• A blog is an informal website consisting of time-stamped articles (posts) in a diary or journal 
format, usually listed in reverse chronological order. Posts can contain text, photos, links, 
and more. For example, Figure 1-38 shows the Nutrition Blog Network, in which registered

dietitians post articles about nutrition. As others read articles in your blog, you can enable 
them to reply with their own thoughts. A blog that contains video is called a video blog.
• Podcasts are a popular way to distribute audio or video on the web. A podcast is recorded 
media that users can download or stream to a computer or portable media player. Examples 
of podcasts include lectures, political messages, radio shows, and commentaries. Podcasters 
register their podcasts so that subscribers can select content to automatically download when 
they are connected.
• A wiki is a collaborative website that allows users to create, add to, modify, or delete the 
content via their browser. Many wikis are open to modification by the general public. The 
difference between a wiki and a blog is that users cannot modify original posts made by a 
blogger. Read Ethics & Issues 1-4 for an issue related to using wikis as a source for research.

Manufacturing
Computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) refers to the use 
of computers to assist with manufacturing processes, such 
as fabrication and assembly. Industries use CAM to reduce 
product development costs, shorten a product’s time to 
market, and stay ahead of the competition. Often, robots 
carry out processes in a CAM environment. CAM is used 
by a variety of industries, including oil drilling, power 
generation, food production, and automobile manufactur-
ing. Automobile plants, for example, have an entire line of 
industrial robots that assemble a car (Figure 1-39).
Ethics & Issues 1-4
Should Wikis Be Allowed as Valid 
Sources for Academic Research?
As wikis have grown in number, size, and 
popularity, many educators and librarians 
have shunned them as valid sources of 
research. While some wikis are tightly con-
trolled with a limited number of contributors 
and expert editors, these wikis usually focus 
on narrowly defined, specialized topics. 
Most large, multi-topic online wikis, such as 
Wikipedia, often involve thousands of edi-
tors, many of whom remain anonymous.
Critics of wikis cite the lack of certified 
academic credentials by the editors, as 
well as potential political or gender bias 
by contributors. Wikis also are subject to 
vandalism. Vandals’ motives vary; some 
enter false information to discredit the 
wiki, and others for humorous results. 
On occasion, rival political factions have 
falsified or embellished wiki entries in 
an attempt to give their candidate an 
advantage. Some wiki supporters argue 
that most wikis provide adequate controls 
to correct false or misleading content 
quickly and to punish those who submit 
it. One popular wiki now requires an 
experienced editor to verify changes made 
to certain types of articles. Other wiki 
protection methods include locking articles 
from editing, creating a list of recently 
edited articles, enabling readers to report 
vandalism, and allowing people to be 
notified about changes to a wiki page that 
they have edited or that is about them. 
Some proponents propose that people 
should use wikis as a starting point for 
researching a fact, but that they should 
verify the fact using traditional sources.
Consider This: Should instructors allow 
wikis as valid sources for academic 
research? Why or why not? Would you 
submit a paper to your instructor that 
cites a wiki as a source? Why or why 
not? What policies might wikis enforce 
that could garner more confidence from 
the public? If a wiki provided verification 
of the credentials of the author, would 
you trust the wiki more? Why or  
why not?

Special computers on the shop floor record actual labor, material, machine, and computer 
time used to manufacture a particular product. The computers process this data and auto-
matically update inventory, production, payroll, and accounting records on the company’s 
network.
Technology Users
Every day, people around the world use various technologies at home, at work, and at school. 
Depending on the hardware, software, and communications requirements, these users generally 
can be classified in one of five categories. Keep in mind that a single user may fall into more 
than one category.
• A home user is any person who spends time using technology at home. Parents, children, teenagers, 
grandparents, singles, couples, etc., are all examples of home users.
• A small/home office user includes employees of companies with fewer than 50 employees, as 
well as the self-employed who work from home. Small offices include local law practices, 
accounting offices, travel agencies, and florists.
• A mobile user includes any person who works with computers or mobile devices while away 
from a main office, home, or school. Examples of mobile users are sales representatives, real 
estate agents, insurance agents, meter readers, package delivery people, journalists, consultants, 
and students.
• A power user is a user who requires the capabilities of a powerful computer. Examples of power 
users include engineers, scientists, architects, desktop publishers, and graphic artists.
• An enterprise has hundreds or thousands of employees or customers who work in or do 
business with offices across a region, the country, or the world. Each employee or customer 
who uses computers, mobile devices, and other technology in the enterprise is an enterprise 
user. Read Ethics & Issues 1-5 to consider whether employees should be held accountable for 
their online social network posts.
Ethics & Issues 1-5
Should Employees Be Held 
Accountable for Their Online Social 
Network Posts?
In addition to looking at your resume 
and scheduling an interview, a potential 
employer may search the web to find out 
information about you. A recent Career 
Builder survey found that 39 percent of 
employers look at applicants’ use of online 
social networks, and 43 percent of those 
found information that caused them not to 
hire the applicant.
Once employed, your manager still may track 
your online activity. Companies are concerned 
about damaged reputations, or even lawsuits. 
Employee actions that worry their employers 
include discussing company sales activity, 
griping about their managers or customers, or 
posting photos that show them taking part in 
unethical, illegal, or unsavory activities.
Social network-related firings have 
raised the question of whether companies 
should monitor employees’ online social 
network activity. Accessing an employee’s 
or a potential employee’s social network 
profile also could have consequences for 
the company. If a company realizes that a 
person is a member of a minority group or 
has a disability, the company could face 
discrimination charges if it does not hire or 
later fires the employee. Privacy experts state 
that your online social network posts are your 
own business. Debate about what falls under 
free speech is ongoing. Remember that you 
cannot delete easily what you post online. 
Whether or not you currently are searching 
for employment, online posts you make now 
can damage your future job prospects.
Consider This: What are the results 
when you search for yourself online? 
What steps can you take to clean up and 
protect your online reputation? Would 
you share social networking accounts or 
passwords with an employer or poten-
tial employer? Why or why not? Should 
companies monitor employees’ accounts? 
Why or why not?

Health Care
You are out running on a beautiful day, 
­tracking your route and distance using a 
health and fitness app on a smartphone. While 
running, you accidentally step on uneven 
pavement and suffer an injury that requires a 
trip to an emergency room. Upon check-in, the 
employee at the front desk uses a tablet to 
record your personal data and symptoms. She 
also uses the tablet to verify that your insur-
ance coverage is current and informs you of 
your co-payment amount. After waiting several 
minutes, a triage nurse takes your temperature 
and blood pressure and then asks a series of 
questions about your symptoms. The nurse 
also records this data in a tablet and asks you 
to remain in the waiting room until someone 
from the radiology department is available to 
perform a CT scan. The radiology department 
is located in a different area of the hospital, 
so the technicians watch a computer screen 
that displays a list of patients who currently 
are waiting for their services.
About 30 minutes later, a technician calls 
your name and escorts you to the radiology 
department for your CT scan. As she is 
performing the scan, a computer records 
the images that later will be reviewed by a 
physician. When the CT scan is complete, you 
return to the waiting room until a physician 
reviews the results. Once she receives 
the results and reviews them, a hospital 
employee takes you to a consultation room.
The physician informs you that other than a 
few bumps and bruises, she believes that you 
have sustained no permanent damage and 
prescribes medication to help ease the pain. 
She then returns to a computer at the nurses’ 
station and adds her diagnosis to the database 
that stores your medical records. She also 
sends your prescription electronically to the 
hospital’s pharmacy. Once discharged, you visit 
the cashier to pay the bill. You then use a tablet 
to sign an electronic version of your discharge 
paperwork so that the hospital can store it 
electronically. 
The hospital 
bills your 
insurance 
company 
electronically. 
If you owe 
a balance 
after the insurance company pays its portion, 
a computer at the hospital will generate a bill 
that will be mailed to you. After purchasing 
your medication and leaving the hospital, you 
realize that despite the hospital being busy, 
computers decreased the time of your visit by 
automating processes that otherwise would 
have been performed manually and reduced 
possible errors by storing all of your personal 
information centrally.

­computers and technology be used in the

stating that your password is incorrect. What are 
your next steps?
10.	Synchronization Error  You added appointments 
to the calendar on your computer, but these 
appointments are not synchronizing with your 
smartphone. Your calendar has synchronized with your 
smartphone in the past, but it has stopped working

11.	Technology in Health Care  Your primary care physician is moving from a shared office so that he can open his 
own practice. He mentioned that he would like to use technology in his office that not only will improve the patient 
experience, but also make his job easier. Form a team of three people to determine the types of technology your 
doctor can use in his new office. One team member should research ways that technology can help improve patient 
check-in and billing. Another team member should research the types of technology your doctor can use while he is 
working with patients, and the third team member should research any additional technology that can be used in the 
office to improve the patient experience. Compile your findings in a report and submit it to your instructor.

5	 Back Up Photos from a Phone or Tablet
Many individuals take photos using mobile devices 
such as phones and tablets. Many, however, neglect 
to realize the importance of backing up these memo-
ries. A backup of the photos will be useful if you lose 
your mobile device, upgrade it to a newer model, or 
the device becomes damaged. While many mobile 
devices have built-in capabilities to back up photos to 
the cloud or to a desktop or laptop, it is important to 
make sure these features are configured properly. The 
following steps guide you through the process of back-
ing up ­photos from a phone or tablet.
Backing Up to the Cloud
a. If necessary, install and sign in to an app on a phone 
or tablet that can back up photos to the cloud. 
Make sure the service you use gives you enough 
storage space for the photos you intend to upload.
b. Follow the instructions in the app and configure 
it to back up the photos at an interval of your 
choosing. Some options might include:
• Back up all photos at certain intervals (such as 
one time per day or one time per week)
• Back up photos as you take them
• Back up photos stored in specific folders
c. If you are using a mobile device with a data 
plan, consider specifying whether you want the 
backup to occur only when you are connected to 
Wi-Fi. Backing up using your phone or tablet’s 
data plan may result in additional charges if you 
inadvertently exceed your quota.
d. Verify all photos have been backed up to the cloud 
service.
Backing Up to a Computer
a. Use the USB cable that came with your phone or 
tablet to connect it to the computer to which you 
want to back up the photos.
b. After the computer has recognized that a phone 
or tablet is connected, navigate to the drive on the 
computer representing the phone or tablet and 
then navigate to the folder containing the photos. 
If your phone or tablet stores pictures on both 
internal storage and a memory card, remember to 
back up your photos from both locations.
c. Drag the photos from the location on your phone 
or tablet to a folder on your computer that will 
store the backed up files.
d. When the files have finished backing up to the 
computer, close all open folder windows on the 
computer and then safely disconnect the phone or 
tablet from the computer.
Exercises
1. How often do you think you should back up your 
photos? Why?
2. When backing up photos, why might it be better to 
connect your phone or tablet to the computer using a

phone or tablet into the computer?

Chapter 1  Introducing Today’s Technologies
1	 Making Use of the Web 
Informational and Research
Informational and research websites contain factual 
information and include reference works such as 
libraries, encyclopedias, dictionaries, directories, and 
guides. More than 2.4 billion people worldwide use the 
Internet, and Google is one of the websites they visit 
most often. Google reports that people perform more 
than 100 billion searches every month using its Google 
Search. In How To 1 in the Succeeding in this Course 
chapter at the beginning of this book and How To 1-3 
in this chapter, you learned how to use a browser to 
display a webpage on a computer or mobile device and 
to perform a basic web search using a search engine.
Research This: Using a browser and search engine, 
find the answers to the following questions. (1) Search 
for the top five informational websites and top five 
research websites. What types of information or re-
search does each present? What search text did you use? 
(2) Visit Google’s website and locate the company’s early 
philosophy: “Ten things we know to be true.” What are 
five of these values? What is the goal of the “Made with 
Code” initiative? (3) Visit the Engadget website and read 
at least three reviews of tablets. Create a table listing 
the product name, price, battery life, pros, and cons. 
(4) ­Locate articles about using hands-free devices for 
conversations while driving. Which states have passed 
legislation to restrict drivers’ use of hands-free devices 
while driving? Describe the features found in the sophis-
ticated hands-free system of one of this year’s vehicles.
2	 Social Media
Online social networks are a central communications 
tool and the primary source of news and information 
for many people. Historians place the birth of online 
social networking with the BBS (Bulletin Board 
System), where users communicated with a central 
computer and sent messages to other BBS members 
and also downloaded files and games. The next phase 
of online social networks evolved when CompuServe, 
AOL (America Online), and Prodigy were among the 
services linking people with similar interests. Today’s 
online social networks share many of the same basic 
principles by allowing members to communicate 
common interests, play games, and share photos, vid-
eos, and music. Some of these online social networks 
are for personal use, while others are for entrepre-
neurs, business owners, and professionals to share 
job-related topics.
Research This: Compare the features of the top 
­personal online social networks, and create a table 
­listing the number of active members in the United 
States and worldwide, the number of years the sites 
have existed, the more popular features, and the 
amount of content, such as photos, news stories, 
and links, that is shared each month. What types of 
advertisements are featured in each of these sites? 
Which sites are marketed toward younger and older 
users? Then, research the online social networks used 
for business. How does their content differ from that 
found on the personal online social networks? How 
many companies use these sites as a recruiting tool? 
How many native languages are supported? How are 
professionals using these websites to find potential 
clients and ­business partners?
3	 Search Skills 
Selecting Search Terms
Search text that you send to a search engine, such 
as Google, Bing, or Yahoo!, impacts the quality of 
your search results. Rather than typing a long ques-
tion in the search box, you may improve your results 
if you select the question’s most important words as 
your search text. For example, instead of typing the 
Source: Google Inc.
Instructions: Use a search engine or another search tool to locate the information requested or answers to questions presented in the exercises. 
Describe your findings, along with the search term(s) you used and your web source(s), in the format requested by your instructor (brief report, 
presentation, discussion, blog post, video, or other means).
 Internet Research
The Internet Research exercises broaden your understanding of chapter concepts by 
requiring that you search for information on the web.
Discover More: Visit this chapter’s premium content to challenge yourself with additional 
Internet Research exercises, which include Search Sleuth, Green Computing, Ethics in Action, 
You Review It, and Exploring Technology Careers.

entire question “How many users currently are on 
Facebook?” as your search text, type the following as 
your search text: facebook users current. Many search 
engines consider common words — such as how, are, 
and on — as stop words, or words that a search engine 
ignores when performing a search.
Place the most specific or important word 
(­facebook) first in your search text and then follow it 
with additional words to narrow the results. To see 
if rearranging the order of the words yields differ-
ent ­results, type current users facebook. Some search 
results from both queries likely will overlap. Many 
search engines assist you by automatically completing 
terms as you type them and will display a list of popu-
lar alternatives from which you can select. Sometimes, 
replacing a search term with a synonym will improve 
your results. For example, try using the search text, 
facebook users, followed by the current year instead of 
the using the word, current. Most search engines are 
not case sensitive. (They do not distinguish between 
uppercase and lowercase characters.)
Research This: Create search text using the 
­techniques described above, and type it into a search 
engine to find answers to these questions. (1) What 
English words are stop words for Google? (2) What 
is the largest solid-state drive available? (3) How 
many hours per day on average do teens spend 
­playing video games? (4) When is the next update 
to the Android mobile operating system expected 
to be released?
4	 Security
Secure IT 1-3 in this chapter offers advice about 
­creating secure passwords when registering for ­websites. 
Despite suggestions and constant reminders from secu-
rity experts to develop and then periodically change 
passwords, users continue to create weak passwords. 
These common passwords are broken easily and, 
­therefore, never should be used. For many years, the 
most common passwords have been the word, password, 
and the number sequences 123456 and 12345678.
Research This: Use a search engine to locate at least 2 
different companies’ lists of the 10 or 20 more com-
mon passwords in the past two years. Which passwords 
appear on both lists? Find a password-strength check-
ing website and type three passwords to determine how 
easy or difficult they are to crack. Why do consumers 
continue to use these passwords despite repeated warn-
ings to avoid them? Do you have accounts using one 
or more of these passwords? What advice is given for 
developing strong passwords, such as using the lyrics to 
the first line of a favorite song? How do the companies 
gather data to determine common passwords?
5	 Cloud Services 
Cloud Storage (Iaas)
Cloud storage providers offer online access to 
­hardware for storing files, and web and mobile apps 
to access, back up, and manage files. Cloud storage 
is an example of IaaS (infrastructure as a service), a 
service of cloud computing that allows individuals and 
businesses to use a vendor’s hardware to manage their 
computing needs.
Cloud storage providers offer both free and paid 
service plans based on the amount of free storage, 
and some allow users to earn additional storage 
by recommending friends to use their services or 
by participating in promotional campaigns. Many 
cloud storage providers enable users to synchronize 
files across multiple devices, access files via mobile 
or web apps, share files with team members, and 
maintain previous versions of files. Some provide 
built-in ­access to web-based productivity software or 
­integrate with third-party web and mobile apps.
Research This: (1) Use a search engine to find three 
popular cloud storage providers. Create accounts and 
try each for a period specified by your instructor. In a 
table, summarize their features, including amount of 
free storage available (offered or earned), restrictions 
on file sizes you can upload, ease of use of web and 
mobile apps, operating systems or devices supported, 
cost of paid plans, and additional services provided for 
a fee. (2) Many cloud storage providers offer several 
gigabytes of free storage to their users. What is the 
largest amount of free storage you can find? Who is 
the provider? Can you identify any drawbacks to using 
this service?

Chapter 1  Introducing Today’s Technologies
Critical Thinking
4.	Recommending Technology Solutions  People use computers and mobile devices in a variety of fields, including 
travel, manufacturing, and more. Although the way people use computers and mobile devices varies, each use involves 
hardware, programs and apps, and some type of communications method, such as the Internet or cellular network.
Do This: Form a three-member team and choose a field in which you all are interested. Assign one member to 
investigate hardware, another to investigate programs and apps, and the third member to investigate communica-
tions methods used in the field. Locate user reviews and articles by industry experts. Each team member should 
develop a list of related items that may be used. After the investigation, create a hypothetical business or organization 
in the field. Recommend specific hardware, programs or apps, and communications capabilities that would be best 
for the network or organization. Include comparisons of specific items, as well as costs. Be sure to summarize your 
­investigations, describe the hypothetical business or organization, and outline and support your recommendations.
Instructions: Evaluate the situations below, using personal experiences and one or more resources available to you (such as articles on the web or in 
print, blogs, podcasts, videos, television, user guides, other individuals, electronics or computer stores, etc.). Perform the tasks requested in each exer-
cise and share your deliverables in the format requested by your instructor (brief report, presentation, discussion, blog post, video, or other means).
The Critical Thinking exercises challenge your assessment and decision-making skills by 
presenting real-world situations associated with chapter concepts. The Collaboration 
exercise should be completed with a team.
1.	Reactions to Software Problems 
People who use computers and mobile devices 
sometimes experience problems with software, including 
operating systems, desktop apps, web apps, and mobile 
apps. Problems range from not being able to install or 
download the program or app to a computer or mobile 
device, to a program or an app producing unanticipated 
results. Depending on the situation, these problems 
can result in user stress. Many people believe reactions 
to software problems tend to be more extreme than 
reactions to problems with other tools.
Do This: Evaluate situations in which you have seen 
people react to program and app problems on their 
computers and mobile devices. Discuss how these users 
can reduce their frustration when dealing with such 
problems. Have you ever been frustrated by problems 
with a program or an app? How did you react? What 
did you do to solve the problem?
2.	Energy Efficiency 
Increases in energy prices lead many individuals to 
look at purchasing energy-efficient computers and 
devices. Energy-efficient models often look and 
perform similarly to equivalent computers or devices 
that use more energy.
Do This: Find two computers or devices of identi-
cal configuration, where the only difference is energy 
consumption. How much energy does the energy-
efficient model save? Are energy-efficient computers 
and devices more or less expensive? Will the difference 
in cost (if any) affect your purchasing decision? How 
else might you be able to change your settings on your 
existing computer or device to save energy? Use the 
web to locate articles that recommend energy-efficient 
products and that ­provide tips about additional ways to 
save energy.
3.	Case Study
Amateur Sports League  You are the new manager 
for a nonprofit amateur soccer league. The previous 
manager tracked all of the data on paper. You realize that 
using technology will increase your efficiency and enable 
you to communicate better with the board of directors, 
coaches, and players. At the board’s next meeting, you 
will share ideas of how you will use technology.
Do This: To prepare for the meeting, you compile the 
following: differences between input and output, a list 
of the types of data you can use as input, and a list of the 
types of information you can produce as output. You in-
clude the types of computers, mobile devices, and other 
technologies you will use to enter data and produce the 
information. Incorporate your own experiences and user 
reviews of the devices. Compile your findings.

The Internet
One of the major reasons business, home, and other users purchase computers and mobile 
devices is for Internet access. The Internet is a worldwide collection of networks that connects 
millions of businesses, government agencies, educational institutions, and individuals. Each of 
the networks on the Internet provides resources that add to the abundance of goods, services, 
and information accessible via the Internet.
Today, billions of home and business users around the world access a variety of services on the 
Internet using computers and mobile devices. The web, messaging, and video communications 
are some of the more widely used Internet services (Figure 2-1). Other Internet services include 
chat rooms, discussion forums, and file transfer. To enhance your understanding of Internet ser-
vices, the chapter begins by discussing the history of the Internet and how the Internet works 
and then explains each of these services.
Evolution of the Internet
The Internet has its roots in a networking project started by the Pentagon’s Advanced 
Research Projects Agency (ARPA), an agency of the U.S. Department of Defense. ARPA’s 
goal was to build a network that (1) allowed scientists at different physical locations to share 
­information and work together on military and scientific projects and (2) could function 
even if part of the network were disabled or destroyed by a disaster such as a nuclear attack. 
That ­network, called ARPANET, became functional in September 1969, linking scientific and 
­academic researchers across the United States.
The original ARPANET consisted of four main computers, one each located at the University 
of California at Los Angeles, the University of California at Santa Barbara, the Stanford Research 
Institute, and the University of Utah. Each of these computers served as a host on the network. 
A host, more commonly known today as a server, is any computer that provides services and con-
nections to other computers on a network. Hosts often use high-speed communications to transfer 
data and messages over a network. By 1984, ARPANET had more than 1,000 individual computers 
linked as hosts. Today, millions of hosts connect to this network, which now is known as the Internet.

Chapter 2  Connecting and Communicating Online
The Internet consists of many local, regional, national, and international networks. Both 
­public and private organizations own networks on the Internet. These networks, along with 
phone companies, cable and satellite companies, and the government, all contribute toward the 
internal structure of the Internet.

Consider This
Who owns the Internet?
No single person, company, institution, or government agency owns the Internet. Each organization on the 
Internet is responsible only for maintaining its own network.
The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C ), however, oversees research and sets standards and guidelines for many 
areas of the Internet. The mission of the W3C is to ensure the continued growth of the web. Nearly 400 organizations 
from around the world are members of the W3C, advising, defining standards, and addressing other issues.

Connecting to the Internet
Users can connect their computers and mobile devices to the Internet through wired or wireless 
technology and then access its services free or for a fee. With wired connections, a computer or 
device physically attaches via a cable or wire to a communications device, such as a modem, that 
transmits data and other items over transmission media to the Internet. For wireless connections, 
many mobile computers and devices include the necessary built-in technology so that they can 
transmit data and other items wirelessly. Computers without this capability can use a wireless 
modem or other communications device that enables wireless connectivity. A wireless modem, for 
example, uses a wireless communications technology (such as cellular radio, satellite, or Wi-Fi) to 
connect to the Internet. Figure 2-2 shows examples of modems. The wireless modem shown in 
the figure is known as a dongle, which is a small device that connects to a computer and enables 
additional functions when attached.
Today, users often connect to the Internet via broadband Internet service because of its fast data 
transfer speeds and its always-on connection. Through broadband Internet service, users can 
download webpages quickly, play online games, communicate in real time with others, and more. 
Table 2-1 shows examples of popular wired and wireless broadband Internet service technologies 
for home and small business users.

Many public locations, such as shopping malls, coffee shops, restaurants, schools, airports, 
hotels, and city parks have Wi-Fi hot spots. Recall that a hot spot is a wireless network that 
­provides Internet connections to mobile computers and devices. Although most hot spots enable 
unrestricted or open access, some require that users agree to terms of service, obtain a password 
(for example, from the hotel’s front desk), or perform some other action in order to connect to 
the Internet. Read Secure IT 2-1 for ways to use a public Wi-Fi hot spot safely.
Secure IT 2-1
Using Public Wi-Fi Hot Spots Safely
Connecting wirelessly to a public hot spot at 
your local coffee shop or at the airport can 
be convenient and practical. Using this free 
service can be risky, however, because cyber-
criminals may lurk in public Wi-Fi hot spots, 
hoping to gain access to confidential infor-
mation on your computer or mobile device. 
Follow these guidelines for a safer browsing 
experience:
• Avoid typing passwords and ­financial 
information. Identity thieves are on 
the lookout for people who sign in to 
accounts, enter their credit card account 
numbers in shopping websites, or conduct 
online banking transactions. If you must 
type this personal information, be certain 
the website’s web address begins with 
“https,” signifying a secure connection. 
If the website’s web address changes to 
“http,” indicating an unsecure ­connection, 
sign out to end your Internet session 
­immediately.
• Sign out of websites. When finished 
using an account, sign out of it and close 
the window.
• Disable your wireless connection. If 
you have finished working online but still 
need to use the computer, disconnect from 
the wireless connection.
• Do not leave your computer or 
­mobile device unattended. It may seem 
obvious, but always stay with your com-
puter or mobile device. Turning your back 
to talk with a friend or to refill your coffee 
gives thieves a few seconds to steal sensi-
tive information that may be displayed on 
the screen.
• Beware of over-the-shoulder 
snoopers. The person sitting behind 
you may be watching or using a camera 
phone to record your keystrokes, read 
your email messages and online social 
network posts, and view your photos 
and videos.
  Consider This:  How will you apply 
these precautions the next time you use a 
public Wi-Fi hot spot? Should businesses post 
signs alerting customers about Wi-Fi security 
issues?

Chapter 2  Connecting and Communicating Online
Home and small business users can share and provide wireless Internet connections by 
­creating their own Wi-Fi hot spot through a communications device in the home or business 
that is connected to broadband Internet service. Instead of a stationary Wi-Fi hot spot, some 
users opt to create mobile hot spots through mobile broadband Internet service via a separate 
communications device or a tethered Internet-capable device (Figure 2-3). Tethering transforms 
a smartphone or Internet-capable tablet into a portable communications device that shares its 
Internet access with other computers and devices wirelessly. Users may pay additional fees for 
mobile hot spot and tethering services.

Employees and students typically connect their computers and mobile devices to the Internet 
wirelessly through a business or school network, which, in turn, usually connects to a high-speed 
Internet service. When away from the office, home, or school, mobile users often access the 
Internet using Wi-Fi, mobile hot spots, or tethering services. Hotels and airports often provide 
wireless Internet connections as a free service to travelers. Many hotels have computers in their 
lobbies for customers to check email, browse the web, or print travel documents. Customers 
often bring their laptops or tablets to coffee shops, restaurants, libraries, hotels, and malls that 
offer free Wi-Fi as a service to their patrons.
Consider This
Does everyone use broadband Internet?
No. Some home users connect computers and devices to the Internet via slower-speed dial-up access because 
of its lower cost or because broadband access is not available where they live. Dial-up access takes place 
when a modem in a computer connects to the Internet via a standard telephone line that transmits data and 
­information using an analog (continuous wave pattern) signal.

Internet Service Providers
An Internet service provider (ISP), sometimes called an Internet access provider, is a 
­business that provides individuals and organizations access to the Internet free or for a fee. 
ISPs often charge a fixed amount for an Internet connection, offering customers a variety of 
plans based on desired speeds, bandwidth, and services. In addition to Internet access, ISPs may 
include additional services, such as email and online storage.
Bandwidth represents the amount of data that travels over a network. A higher bandwidth 
means more data transmits. Data sizes typically are stated in terms of megabytes and gigabytes. 
A megabyte (MB) is equal to approximately one million characters, and a gigabyte (GB) is equal 
to approximately one billion characters. Table 2-2 shows approximate data usage for various 
Internet activities.

Does the term data have multiple meanings?
In the technology field, as discussed in Chapter 1, data can refer to unprocessed items that computers often 
process into information. Data also refers to the content that is stored on media or transmitted over a network. For 
example, when you select a data plan for your smartphone, the mobile service provider typically limits the amount 
of data (number of bytes) you can transfer each month depending on the plan you selected.
	
BTW
Byte
A byte is the basic 
storage unit on a 
computer or mobile 
device and represents a 
single character.
Wi-Fi networks often provide free Internet access, while some charge a daily or per use fee. 
Instead of locating a hot spot, some users prefer to subscribe to a mobile service provider, such 
as Verizon Wireless, so that they can access the Internet wherever they have mobile phone 
access. A mobile service provider, sometimes called a wireless data provider, is an ISP that 
offers wireless Internet access to computers and mobile devices with the necessary built-in wire-
less capability (such as Wi-Fi), wireless modems, or other communications devices that enable  
wireless connectivity. An antenna on or built into the computer or device, wireless modem, or 
communications device typically sends signals through the airwaves to communicate with a 
mobile service provider.

Step 1
You send a request to
the Internet. For
example, you enter
the web address
of a webpage
you want to visit
in the address bar
of your browser.
Step 2
A cable modem 
transfers the 
computer’s digital 
signals to the
cable television
line in your house.
Step 3
Your request (digital signals) 
travels through cable television 
lines to a central cable system, 
which is shared by up to 500 
homes in a neighborhood.
Step 4
The central cable
system sends your request
over high-speed ﬁber-optic 
lines to the cable operator,
who often also is the ISP.
Step 5
The ISP routes your request through the 
Internet backbone to the destination server 
(in this example, the server that contains 
the requested webpage).

How Data Travels the Internet
Computers and devices connected to the Internet work together to transfer data around 
the world using servers and clients and various wired and wireless transmission media. On the 
Internet, your computer or device is a client that can access data and services on a variety of 
servers. Wired transmission media includes phone line, coaxial cable, and fiber-optic cable. 
Wireless transmission media includes radio waves and satellite signals.
The inner structure of the Internet works much like a transportation system. Just as interstate 
highways connect major cities and carry the bulk of the automotive traffic across the country, several 
main transmission media carry the heaviest amount of traffic, or communications ­activity, on the 
Internet. These major carriers of network traffic are known collectively as the Internet backbone.
In the United States, the transmission media that make up the Internet backbone exchange 
data at several different major cities across the country. That is, they transfer data from one 
­network to another until reaching the final destination (Figure 2-4).
IP Addresses and Domain Names
The Internet relies on an addressing system much like the postal service to send data to a computer 
or device at a specific destination. An IP address, short for Internet Protocol address, is a sequence of 
numbers that uniquely identifies the location of each computer or device ­connected to the Internet.

The Internet, Websites, and Media  Chapter 2

The Internet uses two IP addressing schemes: IPv4 and IPv6. Due to the growth of the 
Internet, the original IPv4 addresses began dwindling in availability. The IPv6 scheme increased 
the available number of IP addresses exponentially. Because lengthy IP addresses can be difficult 
to remember, the Internet supports domain names. A domain name is a text-based name that 
corresponds to the IP address of a server that hosts a website (Figure 2-5). A domain name is 
part of the web address that you type in a browser’s address bar to access a website.
The suffix of the domain name, called the top-level domain (TLD), identifies the type of 
­organization associated with the domain. In Figure 2-5, for example, the .com is the TLD.  
Table 2-3 lists some of the original TLDs. New TLDs are 
being introduced to give ­individuals and businesses flexibility 
and creativity when purchasing domain names. For example, 
.museum, .technology, .name, and .biz have been introduced 
as TLDs within recent years.
The organization that approves and controls TLDs is 
called ICANN (pronounced EYE-can), which stands for 
Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers. 
For websites outside the United States, the suffix of the 
domain name may include a country code TLD (ccTLD), 
which is a two-letter country code, such as au for Australia. 
For example, www.philips.com.au is the domain name for 
Philips Australia. Read How To 2-1 to learn how to register 
a domain name.

Register a Domain Name
Individuals and companies register domain 
names so that people can find their websites 
easily using a browser. You register a domain 
name through a registrar, which is an organi-
zation that sells and manages domain names. 
When creating a website to post online, regis-
ter a domain name that is easy to remember 
so that visitors can navigate to your website 
quickly. The following steps describe how to 
register a domain name.
1.	 Run a browser.
2.	 Use a search engine to locate a domain 
name ­registrar and then navigate to the 
website. You may want to evaluate several 
domain name registrars before deciding 
which one to use. Domain name registrars 
often offer various pricing models for 
­registering domain names.
3.	 Perform a search on the domain name 
registrar’s website for the domain name 
you wish to register. If the domain name 
is not available or costs too much, con-
tinue searching for a domain name that 
is available and within your price range, 
or explore various TLDs. For example, if 
the domain name you wish to register is 
not available or too expensive with the 
“.com” TLD, consider using another TLD 
such as “.net” or “.org.”
4.	 Follow the steps on the domain name 
­registrar’s website to select and complete 
the purchase and registration of the 
desired domain name.
  Consider This: What domain name 
based on your name would you register for 
your personal website? If your preferred 
domain name is not available, what are  
three alternative domain names you would 
consider?

Chapter 2  Connecting and Communicating Online
The domain name system (DNS) is the method that the Internet uses to store domain names 
and their corresponding IP addresses. When you enter a domain name (i.e., google.com) in 
a browser, a DNS server translates the domain name to its associated IP address so that the 
request can be routed to the correct computer (Figure 2-6). A DNS server is a server on the 
Internet that usually is associated with an ISP. Read Ethics & Issues 2-1 to consider issues 
related those who purchase unused or lapsed domain names for nefarious purposes.

Step 2
The browser communicates with
a DNS server maintained by your
ISP or another provider. The DNS
server looks up the domain name
portion of the web address, ﬁnds
its associated IP address, and
then sends the IP address to
your computer or mobile device.
Step 3
The browser uses the IP address 
to contact the web server at the 
speciﬁed IP address to request the 
content of the desired webpage. 
The web server fulﬁlls the user’s 
request by sending the desired 
content to the user’s browser, 
which formats the page for 
display on the screen.

Ethics & Issues 2-1
Should Cybersquatters Be Prosecuted? 
You learn from a registrar that a domain 
name containing your company name is not 
available. When you enter the web address in 
a browser, a webpage appears that contains 
ads, false content, or a notice that the domain 
is available for purchase, likely by a cyber-
squatter. Cybersquatters purchase unused or 
lapsed domain names so that they can profit 
from selling them. Cybersquatters sometimes 
will sell you the domain name, but some take 
advantage of people ­trying to reach a more 
popular website to promote their own busi-
ness or needs. One example is when a politi-
cian registered several domain names that 
included his ­opponent’s names and redirected 
them to his own campaign website.
Website owners periodically must renew 
domain names. Cybersquatters look for 
out-of-date registrations and buy them so 
that the original website owner must buy 
them back. Cybersquatters often purchase 
domain names with common words, alternate 
spellings of trademarked terms, or celebrity 
names. With the constant increase of new 
TLDs, cybersquatting cases are on the rise. 
Experts recommend purchasing your domain 
name with as many TLDs as you can afford, 
as well as to register your own name and 
that of your children.
More than 15 years ago, lawmakers 
enacted the Anticybersquatting Consumer 
Protection Act (ACPA). The ACPA’s goal is 
to protect trademark owners from having 
to pay a cybersquatter for a domain name 
that includes their trademark. To win a 
case against a cybersquatter, the owners 
must prove that the cybersquatters acted 
in bad faith, meaning they tried knowingly 
to profit from purchasing a domain name 
with a trademarked term, or a common 
misspelling or nickname of a trademarked 
term. Critics say that the ACPA prohibits 
free speech and free market.
Consider This:  Should ­cybersquatting 
be illegal? Why or why not? Is it ­ethical 
to profit from cybersquatting? Why 
or why not? How should companies 
­protect their brands when registering for 
domain names?

The World Wide Web
While the Internet was developed in the late 1960s, the World Wide Web emerged in the early 
1990s as an easier way to access online information using a browser. Since then, it has grown 
phenomenally to become one of the more widely used services on the Internet.
As discussed in Chapter 1, the World Wide Web (WWW), or web, consists of a worldwide 
collection of electronic documents. Each electronic document on the web is called a webpage, 
which can contain text, graphics, animation, audio, and video. Some webpages are static (fixed); 
others are dynamic (changing). Visitors to a static webpage all see the same content each time they 
view the webpage. With a dynamic webpage, by contrast, the content of the webpage ­generates 
each time a user displays it. Dynamic webpages may contain customized content, such as the 
current date and time of day, desired stock quotes, weather for a region, or ticket availability 
for flights. The time required to download a webpage varies depending on the speed of your 
Internet connection and the amount of graphics and other media involved.
A website is a collection of related webpages and associated items, such as documents and 
photos, stored on a web server. A web server is a computer that delivers requested webpages to 
your computer or mobile device. The same web server can store multiple websites.
As web technologies matured in the mid-2000s, industry experts introduced the term Web 2.0 
to refer to websites that provide a means for users to share personal information (such as online 
social networks), allow users to modify website content (such as wikis), and provide applications 
through a browser (such as web apps).
Navigating the Web
Recall from Chapter 1 that a browser is an application that enables users with an Internet 
­connection to access and view webpages on a computer or mobile device. Internet-capable 
mobile devices such as smartphones use a special type of browser, called a mobile browser, which 
is designed for their smaller screens and limited computing power. Many websites can detect if 
you are accessing their content on a mobile device (Figure 2-7).

Chapter 2  Connecting and Communicating Online
When you run a browser, it may retrieve and display a starting webpage, sometimes called a 
home page. The initial home page that is displayed is specified in the browser. You can change 
your browser’s home page at any time through its settings, options, or similar commands.
Another use of the term, home page, refers to the first page that is displayed on a website. 
Similar to a book cover or a table of contents, a website’s home page provides information 
about its purpose and content. Many websites allow you to personalize the home page so that it 
­contains areas of interest to you.
Current browsers typically support tabbed browsing, where the top of the browser shows a 
tab (similar to a file folder tab) for each webpage you display (shown in Figure 2-7). To move 
from one displayed webpage to another, you tap or click the tab in the browser. Tabbed browsing 
allows users to have multiple home pages that automatically are displayed when the browser runs. 
You also can organize tabs in a group, called a tab group, and save the group as a favorite, so that 
at any time you can display all tabs at once.
Because some websites attempt to track your browsing habits or gather personal information, 
current browsers usually include a feature that allows you to disable and/or more tightly control 
the dissemination of your browsing habits and personal information. Read Secure IT 2-2 for 
safe browsing tips.

Safe Browsing Techniques
Browsing the web is similar to crossing a 
busy street: you need to exercise caution 
and look carefully for unexpected traffic. 
Cybercriminals are on the lookout to prey 
upon unsuspecting users, so you should 
­follow these guidelines when browsing:
• Verify the website is safe. Type the 
website address of your email, banking, 
online social network, and other personal 
accounts directly in a browser; never 
visit these websites merely by tapping or 
clicking links found in email messages. 
Before you sign in, double-check the web 
address to verify it is correct. Most brows-
ers change the color of the address bar 
to verify the website is legitimate. Also, 
check that the web address begins with 
https instead of the less secure http, and 
look for a closed padlock symbol beside it.
• Turn off location sharing. At times, you 
may want allow location sharing, which gives 
websites access to your current location. This 
feature is handy when you want to obtain 
current weather conditions or use a naviga-
tion app. This information could be misused 
by dishonest individuals, however, so it is 
recommended you turn off location sharing.
• Clear your browsing history.  A copy of 
­every website you visit is stored in the browser’s 
cache (pronounced cash) folder. If you perform 
online banking or view your credit card 
transactions, the cache could contain personal 
information, such as passwords and account 
numbers. You can specify to clear cache 
­automatically each time you close a browser.
• Never store passwords. Many browsers 
can store your passwords so that you do 
not need to type them each time you visit 
the same websites. Although you may 
consider this feature a convenience, keep 
in mind that anyone who accesses your 
computer can view these secure websites 
easily using your account information.
• Use a phishing filter. Phishing is a scam in 
which a perpetrator attempts to obtain your 
personal and/or financial information. Many 
browsers include a phishing filter, which is 
a program that warns or blocks you from 
potentially fraudulent or suspicious websites.
• Enable a pop-up or pop-under blocker. 
Malicious software creators can develop a 
pop-up ad or pop-under ad, which are ­Internet 
advertisements that ­suddenly appear in a 
new window on top of or behind a webpage 
displayed in a browser. A pop-up blocker is 
a filtering program that stops pop-up ads from 
displaying on webpages; similarly a pop-
under blocker stops pop-under ads. Many 
browsers include these blockers. You also can 
download them from the web at no cost.
• Use private browsing. Prevent people 
using your computer or mobile device from 
seeing the websites you viewed or searches 
you conducted by using private browsing. 
The browser discards passwords, temporary 
Internet files, data entered into forms, and 
other information when you exit the browser.
• Use a proxy server. To protect your 
online identity, use a proxy server, which 
is another computer that screens all your 
­incoming and outgoing messages. The 
proxy server will prevent your browsing 
history, passwords, user names, and other 
personal information from being revealed.

Browsers
All browsers can retrieve and display webpages, but their 
features and ease of use vary. Many factors can affect the 
decision to choose the browser that best fits your needs.
Configuring Options
Users can customize some settings to improve their 
browsing experience, such as those listed below.
• Favorites, also called bookmarks, are links to preferred 
websites. When you add a website to the list of favorites, 
you can visit that website simply by tapping or clicking its 
name in a list instead of typing its web address. Favorites 
can be organized into folders, alphabetized, and sorted by 
date or how frequently you view the websites.
• Security features, such as filters and secure connections, 
help protect you from fraudulent and malicious websites 
that might attempt to steal your identity and personal 
information. These features also can block websites 
you do not want to be displayed and can instruct the 
browser to save passwords.
• Privacy features help prevent thieves from accessing 
­information about your browsing history, such as web-
sites you have visited, data about your browsing session, 
and content you have seen on specific webpages.
Obtaining Browsers
A browser often is included in the operating system 
of a computer or mobile device. For example, many 
computer manufacturers include Edge or Internet 
Explorer when they install Windows and include Safari 
when they install Mac OS. Use a search engine to 
locate the browser you want to install, and visit its 
website to download the most recent version. Most 
browsers are available for download at no cost. Keep 
your browser up to date to prevent security holes. You 
can set your browser to perform updates automatically.
Making a Decision
Selecting the best browser for your needs involves some 
careful thought. You may decide to install several and then 
use each one for specific needs. Perform some research to 
compare browsers and then consider the following factors:
• How old is your computer or mobile device? A newer 
browser may not work properly on older hardware.
• How much memory is in your computer or mobile 
device? Some browsers work best with a lot of memory.
• Which operating system are you using? Some brows-
ers are available for specific operating systems. For 
example, Internet Explorer and Edge are available 
only for Windows operating systems.
• What do you want the browser to do? Some browsers 
are best suited for performing simple searches, while 
others excel when running websites containing media.
Specific Browsers
• Chrome: Google’s Chrome was first released in 2008. 
This free browser is available for Windows and Mac OS 
and must be downloaded and installed. Chrome has 
independent tabbed browsing; if one tab develops a 
problem, the other tabs continue to function.
• Firefox: Developed by the Mozilla Corporation for 
Windows, Mac OS, and Linux, Firefox is known for 
its extensive array of plug-ins (discussed later in the 
chapter). This free browser was first released in 2004 
and must be downloaded and installed. It has enhanced 
privacy and security features, a spelling checker, tabbed 
browsing, and a password manager.
• Internet Explorer: Internet Explore is a free browser, 
available primarily for Microsoft Windows and comes pre-
installed. First released in 1995, features protection against 
it phishing and malware, and settings to delete informa-
tion about searches performed and webpages visited.
• Edge: Edge is a Microsoft web browser included in the 
Windows 10 operating system. It is the default browser for 
Windows 10 on most devices, and is not compatible with 
prior versions of Windows. Features include integration 
with Cortana and OneDrive, along with annotation and 
reading tools.
• Opera: This second-oldest browser is free, fast, and 
small. Used on both computers and mobile devices, 
Opera must be downloaded and installed. It began as 
a research project in Norway in 1994 and introduced 
several features found on most of today’s browsers.
• Safari: Preinstalled on Apple computers and devices, 
Safari has been the default browser for Mac OS since 
2003 and is relatively new to Windows. The browser 
has built-in sharing with online social networks, fast 
performance, parental controls, and ease of use.
Mobile Browsers
Many browsers are included by default with some 
mobile devices and smartphones. Their features vary 
greatly. Some allow users to zoom and use keyboard 
shortcuts with most websites, while others display 
only websites optimized for mobile devices. The more 
popular mobile browsers are Chrome, Firefox, Internet 
Explorer, Edge, Safari, and Opera Mini.

Web Addresses
A webpage has a unique address, called a web address or URL (Uniform Resource Locator). 
For example, the web address of http://www.nps.gov identifies the U.S. Department of the 
Interior National Park Service home page. A browser retrieves a webpage using its web address.
If you know the web address of a webpage, you can type it in the address bar of the browser. 
For example, if you type the address http://www.nps.gov/history/places.htm in the address bar 
and then press the enter key or tap or click the Search, Go, or similar button, the browser 
downloads and displays the associated webpage (Figure 2-8). The path, history/places.htm, 
in this web address identifies a webpage that is specified in a file named places.htm, which is 
located in a folder named history on the server that hosts the nps.gov website. When you enter 
this web address, after obtaining the IP address for the nps.gov domain name, the browser sends 
a request to the web server to retrieve the webpage named places.htm, and delivers it to your 
browser to be displayed.

A web address consists of a protocol, domain name, and sometimes the host name, path to a 
specific webpage, or file name of the webpage. The http, which stands for Hypertext Transfer 
Protocol, is a set of rules that defines how webpages transfer on the Internet. Many web 
addresses begin with http:// as the protocol. The text between the protocol and the domain 
name, called the host name, identifies the type of Internet server or the name of the web server. 
The www, for example, indicates a web server.
Consider This
Do you need to type the protocol and host name in a web address?
Many browsers and websites do not require that you enter the http:// or the host name www in the web address. 
For example, you could enter nps.gov instead of http://www.nps.gov. As you begin typing a web address or if you 
enter an incorrect web address, browsers often display a list of similar addresses or related websites from which 
you can select. If, however, the host name is not www, you will need to type the host name as part of the web 
address. For example, the web address of schools.nyc.gov for the New York City schools website does not contain 
a www and thus requires entry of the entire web address.
	
When you enter a web address in a browser, you request, or pull, information from a web 
server. Another way users can pull content is by subscribing to a web feed, which contains content 
that has changed on a website. Mass media, blogs, and online social networks often provide web 
feeds, saving users the time spent checking the websites for updated content. Most browsers 
contain the capability to read web feeds.

Web Apps and Mobile Apps
Recall from Chapter 1 that a web app is an application stored on a web server that you access 
through a browser. Users typically interact with web apps directly on a website, sometimes 
referred to as the host. Web app hosts usually provide storage for users’ data and information on 
their servers, known as cloud storage.
Many web app hosts provide free access to their software. Others offer part of their web 
app free and charge for access to a more comprehensive program. Many include advertise-
ments in the free version and charge for an advertisement-free version. Some allow you 
to use the web app free and pay a fee when a certain action occurs. For example, you can 
prepare your tax return for free, but if you elect to print it or file it electronically, you pay a 
minimal fee.
A mobile app is an application you download from a mobile device’s app store or other ­location 
on the Internet to a smartphone or other mobile device. Mobile apps often take ­advantage of 
features of the device, such as touch screens, digital cameras, microphones, and embedded GPS 
receivers, to enable you to enter and capture data.

What are GPS receivers?
GPS (global positioning system) is a navigation system that consists of one or more earth-based receivers that 
accept and analyze signals sent by satellites in order to determine the receiver’s geographic location. A GPS 
receiver is a handheld, mountable, or embedded device that contains an antenna, a radio receiver, and a processor. 
Most smartphones include embedded GPS receivers so that users can determine their location, obtain directions, and 
locate points of interest. Read Ethics & Issues 2-2 to consider issues related to apps that track your location.
GPS receivers determine their location on Earth by analyzing at least 3 separate satellite signals from  
24 satellites in orbit.

Chapter 2  Connecting and Communicating Online
Web apps and mobile apps often work together (Figure 2-9). You might access your cloud 
storage website from a laptop or desktop. The cloud storage website hosts web apps to 
upload, download, browse, organize, and view files. The website also may provide a mobile 
app that you install on a smartphone so that you can access the same information or perform 
the same tasks from a mobile device. Because the data and information for each app is stored 
on cloud storage, all data is synchronized and accessible from anywhere you have an Internet 
connection, regardless of the computer or device used. The functionality of the app across 
computers and devices generally is the same, although the mobile app sometimes has fewer 
features. Some tasks may be easier to accomplish on one device or the other. For example, if 
a lot of typing is required, you may opt to use the web app on a laptop so that you can use a 
standard keyboard.

Ethics & Issues 2-2
Should Apps Be Allowed to Track Your 
Location?
When you install an app on your ­smartphone, 
you unintentionally may be allowing the app 
to send personal data. Apps can transmit 
your location, as well as the time you spend 
using the app. Apps also can collect personal 
information, including gender and birth year, 
if you access the app through an online 
social network profile. Although apps often 
present an option to review their security 
policies, some track user data without per-
mission, or require you to enable tracking 
before you can use the app. You may see the 
results of tracking in the ads you see when 
browsing the web or using an app. Other 
apps may track your location without your 
knowledge, such as apps that parents use to 
pinpoint a child’s whereabouts.
If you search for driving directions, coupons, 
or restaurant tips based on your current 
location or past activities, you might be using 
apps that openly use this type of tracking. For 
example, a check-in app posts your location 
to online social networks, and another app 
enables you to locate friends by tracking their 
Bluetooth signals. Even when you opt to share 
data, use of these types of apps is not without 
risk. When people use location-tracking apps, 
for instance, they run the risk of someone 
stalking or robbing them. One positive use 
of location-tracking apps is with emergency 
services. Lawmakers have struggled with 
whether law enforcement officials can use 
location-tracking without a user’s knowledge. 
The U.S. Supreme Court recently ruled that 
police must get a warrant before searching a 
user’s phone or reading text messages.
Consider This:  Should app makers be able 
to require you to enable tracking or track 
your activity without your knowledge? Why 
or why not? Should the police be able to 
track GPS data without warrants? Why or 
why not? Would you use apps that post 
your location to your online social network 
profile or otherwise alert others of your 
whereabouts? Why or why not?

Types of Websites
The web contains several types of websites: search engines; online social networks; informational 
and research; media sharing; bookmarking; news, weather, sports, and other mass media; educational; 
business, governmental, and organizational; blogs; wikis and collaboration; health and fitness; science; 
entertainment; banking and finance; travel and tourism; mapping; retail and auctions; careers and 
employment; e-commerce; portals; content aggregation; and website creation and management. Many 
websites fall into more than one of these types. All of these websites can be accessed from computers 
or mobile devices but often are formatted differently and may have fewer features on mobile devices.
Search Engines
A web search engine is software that finds websites, webpages, images, videos, news, maps, 
and other information related to a specific topic. You also can use a search engine to solve 
­mathematical equations, define words, and more.
Thousands of search engines are available. Some search engines, such as Bing, Google, and Yahoo!, 
are helpful in locating information on the web for which you do not know an exact web address or are 
not seeking a specific website. Those that work with GPS devices or services are location based, mean-
ing they display results related to the device’s current geographical position. For example, your smart-
phone may be able to display all gas stations within a certain distance of your current location. Some 
search engines restrict searches to a specific type of information, such as jobs or recipes.
Search engines typically allow you to search for one or more of the following items:
• Images: photos, diagrams, and drawings
• Videos: home videos, music videos, television programs, and movie clips
• Maps: maps of a business or address, or driving directions to a destination
• Audio: music, songs, recordings, and sounds
• Publications: news articles, journals, and books
• People or Businesses: addresses and phone numbers
• Blogs: specific opinions and ideas of others
Search engines require that you enter a word or phrase, called search text, to describe the 
item you want to find. Search text can be broad, such as spring break destinations, or more 
­specific, such as walt disney world. If you misspell search text, search engines typically correct 
the ­misspelling or identify alternative search text. Some also provide suggested search text, links, 
and/or images as you type your search text.
Depending on your search text, search engines may respond with thousands to billions of search 
results, sometimes called hits. The content of the search results varies depending on the type of 
information you are seeking and your search text. Some search results contain links to ­webpages 
or articles; others are media, such as images or videos. Most search engines sequence the search 
results based on how close the words in the search text are to one another in the titles and 
descriptions of the results. Thus, the first few links probably contain more relevant information.
If you enter a phrase with spaces between the words in search text, most search engines 
­display results that include all of the keywords. Because keywords describe content, search

How can you improve search results?
You may find that many items listed in the search results have little or no bearing on the item you are seeking. You 
can eliminate superfluous items in search results by carefully crafting search text and use search operators to limit 
search results. Other techniques you can use to improve your searches include the following:
• Use specific nouns.
• Put the most important terms first in the search text.
• List all possible spellings, for example, email, e-mail.
• Before using a search engine, read its Help information.
• If the search is unsuccessful with one search engine, try another.
• Practice search techniques by performing the Internet Research: Search Skills exercise in each chapter of this book.
Subject Directories  A subject directory classifies webpages in an organized set of categories, 
such as sports or shopping, and related subcategories. A subject directory provides categorized 
lists of links arranged by subject. Using a subject directory, you locate a particular topic by 
tapping or clicking links through different levels, moving from the general to the specific. 
A disadvantage with a subject directory is that users sometimes have difficulty deciding which 
categories to choose as they work through the menus of links presented.

Mini-Feature 2-2: Online Social Networks
Recall from Chapter 1 that an online social network, or social networking site, is a website 
that encourages members in its online community to share their interests, ideas, stories, photos, 
music, and videos with other registered users. Some online social networks also enable users to 
communicate through text, voice, and video chat, and play games together online. You interact 
with an online social network through a browser or mobile app on your computer or mobile 
device. Read Mini Feature 2-2 for features and uses of popular online social networks.

Online Social Networks
People you know through personal and professional 
circles form your social networks. You share common 
interests, work or spend leisure time together, and know 
many of one another’s friends. Online social networks 
allow you to manage your social networks online.
Your account on an online social network includes 
profile information, such as your name, location, 
photos, and personal and professional interests. You 
might create accounts on several online social networks 
to separate your personal and professional activities. 
Online social networks allow you to view the profiles 
of other users and designate them as your friends or 
contacts. Some sites, such as Facebook and LinkedIn, 
require friends to confirm a friendship, while others, 
such as Twitter and Google+, allow users to follow 
one another without 
confirmation.
  You can expand your 
online social network 
by viewing your friends’ 
friends and then, in turn, 
designating some of them as 
your friends. Friends of your 
friends and their friends form 
your extended contacts.
• Extended contacts on 
a personal online social 
network such as Facebook 
can introduce you to others at your college or from your 
hometown, connect you with long-distance friends or 
relatives, or enable you to stay in touch with those who 
have interests similar to yours.
• Extended contacts on a professional online social 
­network such as LinkedIn can introduce you to people 
who work at companies where you might be seeking 
employment. You can share employment history and 
skills in your profile, enabling potential employers who 
look at your profile to learn about your specific skills.
Read Secure IT 2-3 for tips about securing your privacy 
when using online social networks.
Personal Uses
Personal uses of online social networks include 
sharing photos and videos, greetings, or status updates. 
A status update 
informs friends 
about what you 
are doing. You 
can like, or show 
appreciation for, 
online content such 
as photos or videos 
on online social networks such as Facebook 
and Google+. When you do, people who see 
the same content will know that you liked 
it, and the person who posted it is notified. 
All of your updates, likes, posts, and events 
appear in the activity stream associated with 
your account. Activity updates from friends 
may appear on a separate page associated 
with your account, often called a news feed.
On many online social networks, updates 
can include hashtags to identify their 
topics. A hashtag is a word(s) preceded by 
a # symbol that describes or categorizes a 
post. Users can search for posts on a topic 
by searching for a hashtag. Some online 
social networks list trending topics based 
on popular hashtags. Many television 
broadcasts, advertisements, and businesses 
post hashtags to encourage viewers and 
customers to share comments on Twitter or Facebook.
When accessing an online social network with a  
GPS-enabled mobile device, the location where you 
check in may be revealed as part of a status update. 
An online social network’s mobile app can share your 
location with friends, find others nearby, and alert you 
to promotional deals from local businesses.
Business Uses
Businesses use online social networks to connect 
with their customers, provide promotional offers, and 
offer targeted advertising. For example, users who 
recommend online content about travel services may 
see travel-related advertising on their online social 
network’s webpage.
Businesses also use data from online social networks 
to better connect with and understand customers. 
They can review comments from customers about their 
experiences using companies’ products or services. 
Monitoring these feeds continuously gives companies 
immediate feedback from customers.
Nonprofit organizations use online social networks 
to promote activities and causes, accept donations, and 
allow volunteers to contact one another online.

Privacy and Security Risks with Online 
Social Networks
Online social networks can be excellent 
places to share messages, photos, and 
­videos. They can, however, be risky places to 
divulge personal information. Follow these 
tips to help protect against thieves who are 
following the network traffic and attempting 
to invade private facets of your life.
• Register with caution. During the 
registration process, provide only necessary 
information. Do not disclose your birthdate, 
age, place of birth, or the city where you 
currently are living. If an email address is 
required, consider using a new address 
so that the online social network cannot 
access your email address book. Online 
social networks occasionally ask users to 
enter their email address and password to 
determine if their friends also are members 
of the network. In turn, the network 
obtains access to contacts in your address 
book and can send spam (unsolicited email 
messages) to your friends.
• Manage your profile. Check for privacy 
settings, usually found on the Settings or 
Options tabs, to set permissions so that you 
can control who can review your ­profile 
and photos, determine how people can 
search for you and make comments, and if 
desired, block certain people from viewing 
your page. Be aware that online social 
networks may change privacy settings. 
Periodically check your settings to ensure 
you have the most up-to-date settings.
• Choose friends carefully. You may 
receive a friend request that appears to 
be from someone you know. In ­reality, 
this message may originate from an 
identity thief who created a fake profile 
in an ­attempt to obtain your personal 
­information. ­Confirm with the sender that 
the request is legitimate.
• Limit friends. While many online social 
networks encourage the practice, do not 
try to gather too many friends in your 
social network. Some experts believe that a 
functional online social network should not 
exceed 150 people. Occasionally review 
what your friends are posting about you.
• Divulge only relevant information. 
Write ­details about yourself that are relevant 
to the reasons you are participating in 
an online social network. When posting 
­information, be aware that the message may 
be accessible publicly and associated with 
your identity permanently. Do not post any-
thing you would not want to be made public.
• Be leery of urgent requests for help. 
Avoid responding to emergency pleas for 
financial assistance from alleged fam-
ily members. In addition, do not reply to 
messages concerning lotteries you did not 
enter and fabulous deals that sound too 
good to be true.
• Read the privacy policy. Evaluate the 
website’s privacy policy, which describes 
how it uses your personal information. For 
example, if you watch a video while signed 
in to your account, an external website or 
app may have access to this information 
and post this activity as an entry in both 
your activity stream and your friends’  
news feeds.
  Consider This:  Should online social 
networks do a better job of telling their users 
what information is safe or unsafe to share? 
What role should parents play in oversee-
ing their child’s involvement in online social 
networks?

Media Sharing
A media sharing site is a website that enables members to manage and share media such as 
­photos, videos, and music. These websites are sometimes called photo sharing sites, video 
­sharing sites (Figure 2-11), and music sharing sites, respectively. Media sharing sites, which may 
be free or charge a fee, provide a quick and efficient way to upload, organize, store, share, and 
download media.
Bookmarking
A bookmarking site is a website that enables 
­members to ­organize, tag, and share links to 
media and other online content (Figure 2-12). 
A tag is a short descriptive label that you assign 
to ­webpages, photos, videos, blog posts, email 
messages, and other digital content so that it is 
easier locate at a later time. Many websites and 
web apps support tagging, which enables users to 
organize their online content. Read How To 2-2

Consider This
Why would you use a media sharing site instead of an online social network?
Although the lines between media sharing sites and online social networks are becoming blurred, some users chose 
a traditional media sharing site if they simply want to post photos, videos, or music to share with others and do not 
require the full functionality of an online social network. Before you allow someone to take your photo or record 
video of you, however, remember that the photo or video may be posted on a media sharing site. These photos or 
videos may be accessible publicly and associated with your identity for a long time. Also, once posted, you may be 
giving up certain rights to the media. Further, do not post photos or videos that are protected by copyright.

Tag Digital Content
When you post digital content online, it is a 
good idea to tag the content so that it is easy 
for you and others to locate and organize. 
After you have uploaded digital content to 
a media sharing site, ­follow the instructions 
on the website to apply tags to the digital 
­content you uploaded. Consider the following 
suggestions when tagging digital content:
• Apply tags to all digital media, such as 
photos, music, and videos.
• If you are using multiple tags to ­identify 
one file, separate each tag with a separator. 
The website to which you are posting  
will inform you how to separate multiple  
tags (such as a space, comma, or 
­semicolon).
• Choose tags that are descriptive of the 
content you are posting. For example, if 
you are posting a photo from a re-
cent family vacation to Hammonasset 
Beach State Park, you might choose 
“Hammonasset” and “vacation” as two 
of your tags for this photo.
• After you have tagged the digital content, 
perform a search on the media sharing 
site for your content, using the tags as 
your search criteria, to verify your content 
is displayed as intended.

tag digital content? What tags might you assign

What are the various kinds of social media?
Social media consists of content that users create and share online, such as photos, videos, music, links, blog 
posts, Tweets, wiki entries, podcasts, and status updates. Social media websites facilitate the creation or publishing 
of social media online and include media sharing sites (for photo, video, and audio files), bookmarking sites, blogs 
and microblogs, wikis, podcasts, online social networks, and online gaming sites.
	
News, Weather, Sports, and Other Mass Media
News, weather, sports, and other mass media websites contain newsworthy material, ­including 
stories and articles relating to current events, life, money, politics, weather (Figure 2-13), and 
sports. You often can customize these websites so that you can receive local news or news about 
specific topics. Some provide a means to send you alerts, such as weather updates or sporting event 
scores, via text or email messages.
News on the web is not 
replacing the newspaper but 
enhancing it and reaching dif-
ferent populations. Although 
some exist solely online, many 
magazines and newspapers 
sponsor websites that pro-
vide summaries of printed 
articles, as well as articles not 
included in the printed ver-
sions. Newspapers, magazines, 
and television and radio sta-
tions often have correspond-
ing news, weather, or sports 
websites and mobile apps. Read

Educational
An educational website offers exciting, challenging avenues for formal and informal teaching and 
learning. The web contains thousands of tutorials from learning how to fly airplanes to learning 
how to cook a meal. For a more structured learning experience, companies provide online training 
to employees, and colleges offer online classes and degrees. Instructors often use the web to enhance 
classroom teaching by publishing course materials, grades, and other pertinent class information.
Business, Governmental, and Organizational
A business website contains content that increases brand awareness, provides company 
­background or other information, and/or promotes or sells products or services. Nearly every 
enterprise has a business website. Examples include Allstate Insurance Company, Apple Inc., 
General Motors Corporation, Kraft Foods Inc., and Walt Disney Company.
Most United States government agencies have websites providing citizens with information, 
such as census data, or assistance, such as filing taxes (Figure 2-14). Many other types of organi-
zations use the web for a variety of reasons. For example, nonprofit organizations raise funds for 
a cause and advocacy groups present their views or opinions.
Ethics & Issues 2-3
Is It Ethical to Use a Fake Name or ID 
on a Website?
You are signing up for an account on an 
online social network, an online dating 
­website, or a news website that enables  
you to post comments. Should you use your 
real name?
Many argue that it is harmless to protect 
your anonymity by using a fake name 
but believe that it is not right to create 
a fake profile to mislead others or leave 
malicious comments on a website. The 
latter has become so prevalent that terms 
have emerged to describe this behavior. 
For example, catfishing is when someone 
creates a fake online social network or online 
dating profile and forms relationships with 
unsuspecting users. A troll is a user who 
posts negative, inflammatory comments on a 
blog post or article with the intent of inciting 
other users.
One website creates very thorough, but 
completely fake, personas, which include 
email addresses, Social Security numbers, 
phone numbers, and more. Although law 
enforcement has raised concerns over 
the potential misuses of fake profiles, it 
technically is legal, even though the names 
and personas are not real. Legitimate uses 
for fake name generators include testers of 
large databases, such as ones for hospitals.
Facebook currently requires members 
to use their real names. Twitter’s policy is 
that anyone can create a fake account, 
but it has a verification process to identify 
the official account of a celebrity or public 
figure. Most fake Twitter accounts are 
harmless, and often are flattering. Although 
some argue that creating a fake account 
constitutes identity theft, unless the intent 
is to harm or embarrass the real person, it 
is not unethical or illegal. When a journalist 
created a fake account for a politician and 
posted discriminatory quotes and Tweets in 
the politician’s name, many considered it 
an ethics violation, because journalists are 
supposed to report the truth.
Consider This:  Is it ever acceptable to use 
a fake name online? Why or why not? Is it 
unethical to create fake personas for others 
to use? Why or why not? Should websites 
require you to use a real name, or have a 
verification process? Why or why not?

How can you locate Tweets about certain topics?
When searching Twitter, you can use hashtags to find related posts. Similarly, you can tag 
any word(s) in your Tweets by typing it as a hashtag, such as #election.

Blogs
As described in Chapter 1, a blog (short for weblog) is an 
informal website consisting of time-stamped articles, or posts, 
in a diary or journal format, ­usually listed in reverse chronolog-
ical order. The term blogosphere refers to the worldwide collection of blogs. A 
blog that contains video sometimes is called a video blog, or vlog. A microblog 
allows users to publish short messages usually between 100 and 200 charac-
ters, for others to read. The collection of a user’s Tweets, or posts on Twitter, 
for example, forms a microblog (Figure 2-15).
Similar to an editorial section in a newspaper, blogs reflect the interests, 
opinions, and personalities of the author, called the blogger, and sometimes 
website visitors. Blogs have become an important means of worldwide com-
munications. Businesses create blogs to communicate with employees, cus-
tomers, and vendors. They may post announcements of new information on 
a corporate blog. Teachers create blogs to collaborate with other teachers 
and students. Home users create blogs to share aspects of their personal lives 
with family, friends, and others.
Wikis and Collaboration
Whereas blogs are a tool for publishing and sharing messages, wikis enable 
users to organize, edit, and share information. A wiki is a type of collabora-
tive website that allows users to create, add, modify, or delete the website 
content via a browser. Wikis can include articles, documents, photos, or 
videos. Some wikis are public, accessible to everyone (Figure 2-16). Others 
are private so that content is accessible only to certain individuals or groups. 
Many companies, for example, set up wikis as an intranet for employees to 
collaborate on projects or access ­information, procedures, and documents. 
(An intranet is an internal network that uses Internet technologies.)

Contributors to a wiki typically must register before they can edit content or add ­comments. 
Wikis usually hold edits on a webpage until an editor or website manager can review them 
for accuracy. Unregistered users typically can review the content but cannot edit it or add 
­comments.
Other types of collaboration sites enable users to share and edit any type of project — 
­including documents, photos, videos, designs, prototypes, schedules, and more, often at the same 
time. On these websites, comments or edits are seen by other connected users. Most of these 
websites also enable users to communicate via chat windows, and some provide a whiteboard.

collaboration websites.
Health and Fitness
Many websites provide up-to-date medical, fitness, nutrition, or exercise information for 
­public access. Some offer users the capability of listening to health-related seminars and 
­discussions. Consumers, however, should verify the online information they read with a personal 
physician. Health service organizations store your personal health history, including prescrip-
tions, lab test results, doctor visits, allergies, and immunizations. Doctors use the web to assist 
with researching and diagnosing health conditions.
Science­
Several websites contain information about space ­exploration, astronomy, physics, earth ­sciences, 
microgravity, robotics, and other branches of science. Scientists use online social ­networks to col-
laborate on the web. Nonprofit science organizations use the web to 
seek public donations to support research.
Entertainment
An entertainment website offers music, videos, shows, 
­performances, events, sports, games, and more in an interactive 
and engaging environment. Many entertainment websites support 
streaming media. Streaming is the process of transferring data in 
a continuous and even flow, which allows users to access and use 
a file while it is transmitting. You can listen to streaming audio or 
watch streaming video, such as a live performance or broadcast, 
as it downloads to your computer, mobile device, or an Internet-
connected television.
Sophisticated entertainment websites often partner with other 
technologies. For example, you can cast your vote on a television 
show via your phone or online social network account.
Banking and Finance
Online banking and online trading enable users to access their 
financial records from anywhere in the world, as long as they 
have an Internet connection. Using online banking, users can 
access accounts, pay bills, transfer funds, calculate mortgage pay-
ments, and manage other financial activities from their computer 
or mobile device (Figure 2-17). With online trading, users can 
invest in stocks, options, bonds, treasuries, certificates of deposit, 
money market accounts, annuities, mutual funds, and so on, 
­without using a broker. Read Secure IT 2-4 for tips about pro-
tecting your bank accounts and other personal ­information from 
identity theft.

Travel and Tourism
Travel and tourism websites enable users to research travel options and make travel 
­arrangements. On these websites, you typically can read travel reviews, search for and compare 
flights and prices, order airline tickets, book a room, or reserve a rental car.

Mapping
Several mapping website and web apps exist that enable you to display up-to-date maps by 
searching for an address, postal code, phone number, or point of interest (such as an airport, 
lodging, or historical site). The maps can be displayed in a variety of views, including terrain, 
aerial, maps, streets, buildings, traffic, and weather. These websites also provide directions when 
a user enters a starting and destination point (Figure 2-18). Many work with GPS to determine 
where a user is located, eliminating the need for a user to enter the starting point and enabling 
the website to recommend nearby points of interest.

Protecting Yourself from Identity Theft
The fastest growing crime in the United 
States is identity theft. More than nine 
­million people fall victim each year, with the 
unauthorized use of an existing credit card 
accounting for much of the problem. The 
National Crime Victimization Survey reports 
that household identity theft losses amount 
to more than $13 billion each year, and that 
figure does not account for the aggravation 
and time required to repair the accounts. 
Practice these techniques to thwart attempts 
to steal your personal data:
• Do not tap or click links in or reply to spam 
for any reason.
• Install a personal firewall (software that 
protects network resources from outside 
intrusions).
• Clear or disable web cookies (small text 
files that web servers store on a computer) 
in your browser. This action might prevent 
some cookie-based websites from function-
ing, but you will be able to decide which 
cookies to accept or reject.
• Turn off file and printer sharing on your 
Internet connection.
• Set up a free email account. Use this email 
address for merchant forms.
• Sign up for email filtering through your ISP 
or use an anti-spam program.
• Shred financial documents before you 
discard them.
• Provide only the required information on 
website forms.
• Avoid checking your email or performing 
banking activities on public computers. 
These computers are notorious for running 
keyloggers, which record keystrokes in a 
hidden file, and other tracking software. If 
you must use a public computer for critical 
activities, be certain to sign out of any 
password-protected website and to clear 
the browser’s cache.
• Request a free copy of your medical records 
each year from the Medical Information 
Bureau.
• Obtain your credit report once a year from 
each of the three major credit reporting 
agencies and correct any errors. Enroll in a 
credit monitoring service.
• Request, in writing, to be removed from 
mailing lists.
• Place your phone number on the National 
Do Not Call Registry.
• Avoid shopping club and buyer cards.
• Do not write your phone number on charge 
or credit receipts. Ask merchants not to 
write this number or any other personal 
information, especially your Social Security 
number and driver’s license number, on the 
back of your personal checks.
• Do not preprint your phone number or 
Social Security number on personal  
checks.
• Fill in only the required information on 
rebate, warranty, and registration  
forms.
• Learn how to block your phone number 
from displaying on the receiver’s  
system.
If your identity has been stolen, 
immediately change any passwords  
that may have been compromised. If you  
have disclosed your debit or credit card 
numbers, contact your financial institutions. 
You also should visit the Federal Trade 
Commission website or call the FTC  
help line.
  Consider This:  Do you know anyone 
who has been a victim of identity theft? What 
steps will you take to protect your identity 
using some of these guidelines?

Retail and Auctions
You can purchase just about any product or service on the web, a process that sometimes is 
called e-retail (short for electronic retail). To purchase online, the customer visits the business’s 
electronic storefront, which contains product descriptions, images, and a shopping cart (Figure 2-19). 
The shopping cart allows the customer to collect purchases. When ready to complete the sale, the 
customer enters personal data and the method of payment, which should be through a secure 
Internet connection.

With an online auction, users bid on an item being sold by someone else. The highest ­bidder 
at the end of the bidding period purchases the item. eBay is one of the more popular online 
­auction websites.
Consider This
Is it safe to enter financial information online?
As an alternative to entering credit card, bank account, or other financial information online, some shopping and 
auction websites allow consumers to use an online payment service such as PayPal. To use an online payment 
service, you create an account that is linked to your credit card or funds at a financial institution. When you make 
a purchase, you use your online payment service account, which transfers money for you without revealing your 
financial information.
	
Careers and Employment
You can search the web for career information and job openings. Job search websites list 
­thousands of openings in hundreds of fields, companies, and locations. This information may 
include required training and education, salary data, working conditions, job descriptions, and 
more. In addition, many organizations advertise careers on their websites.
When a company contacts you for an interview, learn as much about the company and  
the industry as possible before the interview. Many have websites with detailed company 
­profiles.

E-Commerce
E-commerce, short for electronic commerce, is a business transaction that occurs over an 
electronic network, such as the Internet. Anyone with access to a computer or mobile device, 
an Internet connection, and a means to pay for purchased goods or services can participate in 
e-commerce. Some people use the term m-commerce (mobile commerce) to identify e-commerce 
that takes place using mobile devices. Popular uses of e-commerce by consumers include 
­shopping and auctions, finance, travel, entertainment, and health.
Three types of e-commerce websites are business-to-consumer, consumer-to-consumer, and 
business-to-business.
• Business-to-consumer (B2C ) e-commerce consists of the sale of goods and services to the general 
public, such as at a shopping website.
• Consumer-to-consumer (C2C ) e-commerce occurs when one consumer sells directly to another, 
such as in an online auction.
• Business-to-business (B2B ) e-commerce occurs when businesses provide goods and services to 
other businesses, such as online advertising, recruiting, credit, sales, market research, technical 
support, and training.
Portals
A portal is a website that offers a variety of Internet services from a single, convenient 
­location (Figure 2-20). A wireless portal is a portal designed for Internet-capable mobile  
devices. Most portals offer these free services: search engine; news, sports, and weather; web 
publishing; yellow pages; stock quotes; maps; shopping; and email and other communications 
services.

Content Aggregation
A content aggregation website or web app, sometimes called a curation website, allows users  
to collect and compile content from a variety of websites about a particular topic or theme 
(Figure 2-21). Types of content that may be compiled includes news, reviews, images, videos, 
podcasts (discussed later in this chapter), and blogs. Content aggregation websites save users 
time because they need to visit only one website (the content aggregation website) instead of 
visiting multiple websites to obtain information.

Website Creation and Management
By creating their own websites, businesses and individuals can convey information to billions 
of people. The content of the webpages ranges from news stories to product information to 
blogs to surveys. Web creation and management sites provide tools that support the steps in  
web publishing, which is the creation and maintenance of websites. To create a website, you do 
not have to be a computer programmer. For the small business or home user, web publishing 
is fairly easy as long as you have the proper tools. Table 2-5 outlines the five main steps in web 
publishing.
Table 2-5  Steps in Web Publishing
Step
Description
1. Plan the website.
Identify the purpose of the website and the characteristics of the people you want to visit the website.
Determine ways to differentiate your website from other similar ones.
Decide how visitors will navigate the website.
Register the desired domain name.
2. Design the website.
Design the appearance and layout of elements on the website.
Decide colors and formats.
Determine content for links, text, graphics, animation, audio, video, virtual reality, and blogs.
You may need specific hardware, such as a digital camera, webcam, video camera, scanner, and/or  
audio recorder.
You also may need software that enables you to create images or edit photos, audio, and video.
3. Create the website.
To create a website, you have several options:
  a. Use the features of a word processing program that enable you to create basic webpages from 
documents containing text and graphics.
  b. Use a content management system, which is a tool that assists users with creating, editing, and 
hosting content on a website.
  c. Use website authoring software to create more sophisticated websites that include text, graphics, 
animation, audio, video, special effects, and links.
  d. More advanced users create sophisticated websites by using a special type of software, called  
a text editor, to enter codes that instruct the browser how to display the text, images, and links  
on a webpage.
  e. For advanced features, such as managing users, passwords, chat rooms, and email, you may need  
to purchase specialized website management software.
4. Host the website.
Options for transferring the webpages from your computer to a web server include the following:
  a. A web hosting service provides storage space on a web server for a reasonable monthly fee.
  b. Many ISPs offer web hosting services to their customers for free or for a monthly fee.
  c. Online content management systems usually include hosting services for free or for a fee, depending 
on features and amount of storage used.
5. Maintain the website.
Visit the website regularly to ensure its contents are current and all links work properly.
Create surveys on the website to test user satisfaction and solicit feedback.
Run analytics to track visitors to the website and measure statistics about its usage.
Some websites are dedicated to one portion of web publishing; others provide a variety of web 
publishing tools, including website design, content management, web hosting, website market-
ing, website analytics, survey development, and more. Because users view websites on a variety of 
computers and devices, many website developers use an approach called responsive web design 
(RWD) that adapts the layout of the website to fit the screen on which it is being displayed.

Digital Media on the Web
Most webpages include 
­multimedia, which refers to 
any application that com-
bines text with media. Media 
includes graphics, animation, 
audio, video, and/or virtual 
reality. The sections that fol-
low discuss how the web uses 
these types of media.
Graphics
A graphic is a visual 
­representation of nontext 
information, such as a drawing, 
chart, or photo. Many webpages 
use colorful graphics to convey 
messages (Figure 2-22). As 
shown in the figure, some web-
sites use thumbnails on their 
pages because larger graph-
ics can be time-consuming to 
display. A thumbnail is a small 
version of a larger image. You usu-
ally can tap or click a thumbnail to 
display the image in full size.
Consider This
Can you assume that content on a website is correct and accurate?
No. Any person, company, or organization can publish a webpage on the Internet. No one oversees the content 
of these webpages.
Use the criteria below to evaluate a website or webpage before relying on its content.
• Affiliation: A reputable institution should support the website without bias in the information.
• Audience: The website should be written at an appropriate level.
• Authority: The website should list the author and the appropriate credentials.
• Content: The website should be well organized and the links should work.
• Currency: The information on the webpage should be current.
• Design: The pages at the website should download quickly, be visually pleasing, and be easy to navigate.
• Objectivity: The website should contain little advertising and be free of bias.
Now you Should Know
Be sure you understand the material presented in the section titled Types of Websites as it relates to the chapter objectives.
Now you should know … 
• How to enter search text and improve your search results (Objective 5)
• How you can benefit from online social networks (Objective 6)
• When you would use specific types of websites (Objective 7)
• How you can publish your own website (Objective 7)

Chapter 2  Connecting and Communicating Online
The web often uses infographics to present concepts, products, 
and news. An infographic (short for information graphic) is a visual 
representation of data or information, designed to communicate 
quickly, simplify complex concepts, or present patterns or trends 
(Figure 2-23). Many forms of infographics exist: maps, signs, 
charts, and diagrams.
Of the graphics formats for displaying images on the web 
(Table 2-6), the JPEG and PNG formats are more common. 
JPEG (pronounced JAY-peg) is a compressed graphics format 
that attempts to reach a balance between image quality and file 
size. With JPG files, the more compressed the file, the smaller 
the image and the lower the quality. PNG (pronounced ping) is 
a patent-free compressed graphics format that restores all image 
details when the file is viewed. That is, the PNG format does 
not lose image quality during compression.

Animation  Many webpages use animation, which is the appearance of motion created by 
­displaying a series of still images in sequence. For example, text that animates by scrolling 
across the screen can serve as a ticker to display stock updates, news, sports scores, weather, or 
other information. Web-based games often use animation.
Audio
On the web, you can listen to audio clips and live audio. Audio includes music, speech, or 
any other sound. Simple applications consist of individual audio files available for download 
to a computer or device. Once downloaded, you can play (listen to) the content of these files. 
Read How To 2-3 for instructions about downloading digital media from online services. Other 
­applications use streaming audio so that you can listen to the audio while it downloads.

Audio files are compressed to reduce their file sizes. For 
example, the MP3 format reduces an audio file to about one-
tenth its original size, while preserving much of the original 
quality of the sound.
To listen to an audio file on your computer, you need 
special software called a media player. Most current oper-
ating systems contain a media player; for example, the 
Windows operating system includes Windows Media 
Player (Figure 2-24). Some audio files, however, might 
require you to ­download a media player. Media players 
available for download include iTunes and RealPlayer. You 
can download media players free from the web.

learn more about audio file ­formats.
Video
On the web, you can view video clips or watch live 
video. Video consists of images displayed in motion. Most video also has accompanying audio. 
You also can upload, share, or view video clips at a video sharing site. Educators, politicians, and 
businesses use video blogs and video podcasts to engage students, voters, and consumers.
Simple video applications on the web consist of individual video files, such as movie or 
­television clips, that you must download completely before you can play them on a computer 
or mobile device. Video files often are compressed because they are quite large in size. Videos 
posted to the web often are short in length, usually less than 10 minutes, because they can take 
a long time to download. As with streaming audio files, streaming video files allows you to view 
longer or live videos by playing them as they download to your computer.

Virtual Reality  Virtual reality (VR) is the use of computers to simulate a real or ­imagined 
environment that appears as a three-dimensional (3-D) space. VR involves the display of 3-D 
images that users explore and manipulate interactively. Using special VR software, a developer 
Download Digital Media from Online 
Services
Online services make various forms of digital 
media available, such as books, music, movies, 
and apps. You typically can use a program, such 
as iTunes, or an app, such as the Google Play 
Store, to access digital media. Digital media 
also may be available from these services’ 
websites. The following steps describe how to

creates an entire 3-D environment that contains infinite 
space and depth, called a VR world (Figure 2-25). A VR 
world on the web, for example, might show a house for 
sale where potential buyers walk through rooms in the 
VR house by sliding their finger on a touch screen or 
moving an input device forward, backward, or to the side. 
In addition to games and simulations, many practical 
applications of VR also exist. Science educators create 
VR models of molecules, organisms, and other structures 
for students to ­examine. Companies use VR to showcase 
­products or create advertisements. Architects create VR 
models of buildings and rooms so that clients can see 
how a ­completed construction project will look before it 
is built.
Plug-Ins
Most browsers have the capability of displaying basic 
multimedia elements on a webpage. Sometimes, how-
ever, a browser requires an additional program, called a 
plug-in, to display ­multimedia. A plug-in, or add-on, is 
a program that extends the capability of a browser. For 
example, your browser may require Adobe Reader to 
view and print PDF files. You typically can download plug-ins at no cost from various websites. 
Some plug-ins run on all sizes of computers and mobile devices; others have special versions for 
mobile devices.
Some mobile devices and browsers, however, do not support plug-ins. For this reason, web 
designers are using newer technologies to create websites that display correctly in both desktop and 
mobile browsers; these technologies generally do not require the use of plug-ins to display media.
Discover More: Visit this chapter’s free resources to learn more about plug-ins.
Other Internet Services
As previously mentioned, the web is only one of the many services on the Internet. Other 
Internet services include the following: email, email lists, Internet messaging, chat rooms, online 
discussions, VoIP (Voice over IP), and FTP (File Transfer Protocol).
Email
Email (short for electronic mail) is the transmission of messages and files via a computer 
network. Email was one of the original services on the Internet, enabling scientists and 
researchers working on government-sponsored projects to communicate with colleagues at 
other locations.
You use an email program to create, send, receive, forward, store, print, and delete email 
messages. Email programs are available as desktop apps, web apps, and mobile apps. An email 
message can be simple text or can include an attachment such as a document, a graphic, an audio 
clip, or a video clip.
Just as you address a letter when using the postal system, you address an email message with 
the email address of your intended recipient. Likewise, when someone sends you a message, he 
or she must have your email address.
An email address is a combination of a user name and a domain name that identifies a user so 
that he or she can receive Internet email. A user name is a unique combination of characters, 
such as letters of the alphabet and/or numbers, that identifies a specific user. Your user name 
must be different from the other user names in the same domain. For example, a user named 
Rick Claremont whose server has a domain name of esite.com might want to select rclaremont

as his user name. If esite.com already has an rclaremont (for Rita Claremont) user name, then 
Rick will have to select a different user name, such as rick.claremont or ­rclaremont2.
Sometimes, organizations decide the format of user names for new users so that the user names 
are consistent across the company. In many cases, however, users select their own user names, 
often selecting a nickname or any other combination of characters for their user name. Many 
users select a combination of their first and last names so that others can remember it easily.
In an Internet email address, an @ (pronounced at) symbol separates the user name from the 
domain name. Your service provider supplies the domain name. A possible email address for 
Rick Claremont would be rclaremont@esite.com, which would be read as follows: R Claremont 
at e site dot com. Most email programs allow you to create a contacts folder, which contains a list 
of names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, and other details about people with whom 
you communicate.
Figure 2-26 illustrates how an email message may travel from a sender to a receiver. When 
you send an email message, an outgoing mail server determines how to route the message 
through the Internet and then sends the message. As you receive email messages, an incoming 
mail server holds the messages in your mailbox until you use your email program to retrieve 
them. Most email programs have a mail notification alert that informs you via a message and/or 
sound when you receive a new email message(s).

Chapter 2  Connecting and Communicating Online
Email Lists
An email list, or electronic mailing list, is a group of email addresses used for mass 
­distribution of a message. When a message is sent to an email list, each person on the list 
receives a copy of the message in his or her mailbox. You subscribe to an email list by adding 
your email address to the mailing list, which is stored on a list server. To remove your name, you 
unsubscribe from the mailing list.
The original use of email lists, such as LISTSERV, allowed any subscriber to send a message, 
which created a discussion-type forum among all subscribers via email. Many mailing lists today, 
such as in Figure 2-27, however, are one-way communications and do not allow subscribers to 
send messages.
Internet Messaging
Internet messaging services, which often 
occur in real-time, are communications services 
that notify you when one or more of your estab-
lished contacts are online and then allows you to 
exchange messages or files or join a private chat 
room with them (Figure 2-28). Real time means 
that you and the people with whom you are con-
versing are online at the same time. Some Internet 
messaging services support voice and video conver-
sations, allow you to send photos or other docu-
ments to a recipient, listen to streaming music, and 
play games with another online contact.
For real-time Internet messaging to work, both 
parties must be online at the same time. Also, the 
receiver of a message must be willing to accept 
messages. To use an Internet messaging service, 
you may have to install messenger software or an 
app on the computer or mobile device, such as a 
smartphone, you plan to use.
Many online social networks include a ­messaging 
feature. To ensure successful communications, all 
individuals on the friend list need to use the same 
or a compatible messenger.

Chat Rooms
A chat is a real-time typed conversation 
that takes place on a computer or mobile 
device with many other online users.  
A chat room is a website or application 
that permits users to chat with others who 
are online at the same time. A server echoes 
the user’s message to everyone in the chat 
room. Anyone in the chat room can par-
ticipate in the conversation, which usually 
is specific to a particular topic. Businesses 
sometimes use chat rooms to communicate 
with customers.
As you type on your keyboard, others 
connected to the same chat room server 
also see what you have typed (Figure 2-29). 
Some chat rooms support voice chats and 
video chats, in which people hear or see each other as they chat. Most browsers today include 
the capability to connect to a chat server.
Online Discussions
An online discussion, or discussion forum, is an online area in which users have written 
­discussions about a particular subject (Figure 2-30). To participate in a discussion, a user posts a 
message, called an article, and other users read and reply to the message. A thread, or threaded 
discussion, consists of the original article and all subsequent related replies.
Some discussion forums require that you enter a user name and password to participate in the 
discussion. For example, an online discussion for students taking a college course may require a 
user name and password to access the discussion. This ensures that only students in the course

of time, such as a semester, in this example.
VoIP
VoIP, short for Voice over IP (Internet Protocol), enables users to speak to other users via 
their Internet connection. That is, VoIP uses the Internet (instead of the public switched tele-
phone network) to connect a calling party to one or more local or long-distance called parties.
To place an Internet phone call, you need a broadband Internet connection, a microphone and 
speaker, both of which are included with a standard computer or mobile device, and VoIP soft-
ware, such as Skype. Some VoIP services require that you purchase a separate phone and VoIP 
router, and subscribe to their service. Others offer certain services free and require a subscrip-
tion for additional services. Read How To 2-4 for instructions about how to set up a personal 
VoIP service and make a call.
BTW
VoIP Microphone
You also can use a 
headset connected to or 
that communicates with 
your computer or mobile 
device.
FTP
FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is an Internet standard that permits file uploading and 
d­ownloading to and from other computers on the Internet. Uploading is the process of transfer-
ring files from your computer or mobile device to a server on the Internet. Recall that down-
loading is the process of transferring files from a server on the Internet to your computer or 
mobile device. Webpage developers, for example, often use FTP to upload their webpages to a 
web server.
Many operating systems include FTP capabilities. If yours does not, you can download FTP 
programs from the web, usually for a small fee.
An FTP server is a computer that allows users to upload and/or download files using FTP. An 
FTP site is a collection of files that reside on an FTP server. Many FTP sites have anonymous 
FTP, whereby anyone can transfer some, if not all, available files. Some FTP sites restrict file 
transfers to those who have authorized accounts (user names and passwords) on the FTP server.

Set Up a Personal VoIP Service and 
Make a Call
VoIP services enable you to make free 
video or voice calls to others around the 
world. In many cases, the person you are 
calling also must use the same VoIP ser-
vice. The following steps describe how to 
set up a VoIP service and make a call.
1.	 If you do not know the VoIP service you 
want to use, search for a program or app 
that enables you to place and receive 
VoIP calls.
2.	 If necessary, download the program or 
app for the VoIP service you will use.
3.	 Most VoIP services require you to have an 
account with their service before you can 
place or receive a call. When you start 
the VoIP program or app, search for the 
button or link to create a new account. 
Follow the steps in the program or app to 
finish creating the account.
4.	 Once the account has been created, if 
necessary, sign in to the VoIP service with 
your user name and password.
5.	 Make sure the person you are calling also 
has an account with the same VoIP ser-
vice. You should know at least one person 
using this service to successfully place a 
call. VoIP services typically allow you to 
locate and call someone by entering their 
user name or adding them to your list of 
contacts. If necessary, add the person you 
want to call to your list of contacts.
6.	 On the list of contacts, select the person 
you want to call and then tap or click the 
appropriate button to place the call.
7.	 When the other person answers, you can 
start your voice or video call.
8.	 When you are ready to end the call, tap 
or click the button to end the call.
9.	 When you are finished using the VoIP 
­service, you should sign out of and exit 
the VoIP program or app.
  Consider This:  Survey your friends and 
family to see if they use a VoIP service. If so, 
which service is the most popular among them?

Mini Feature 2-3: Digital Communications
Home users, small/home office users, mobile users, power users, and enterprise users interact with 
­technology for many reasons, including communication, productivity, and information. Read Mini 
Feature 2-3 for examples of how a home user might interact with digital communications.
Digital Communications
This scenario, which assumes you are a home user with 
a busy family, presents situations and questions regard-
ing technology use during a single day.
7:30 a.m. You notice a leaky pipe under the kitchen 
sink. Your regular plumber recently has retired. On 
your smartphone, you run an app that enables you to 
use search criteria, GPS, and user reviews. You find a 
local plumber who has many positive reviews and tap 
the phone number on the smartphone touch screen 
to place the call. You leave a message explaining the 
problem and asking the plumber to call you back.
 How can you evaluate reviews for authenticity and 
bias? How might an app provider use your location 
information in ways you have not authorized?
8:45 a.m. The plumber calls you back to schedule an 
appointment time. You open your laptop and use the 
electronic calendar web app your entire family uses to 
keep track of appointments. You find a time that works 
for both of you and update the electronic calendar.
 What features enable multiple people, such as a 
family or small business, to use an electronic calendar? 
What issues may occur from using a shared calendar?
10:00 a.m. You have a freelance job blogging for a 
local florist. You are required to post twice weekly to the 
florist’s blog about agreed-upon topics. You use a wiki to 
confirm the symbolic meaning of different types of roses 
so that you can include that in your next blog post. You 
sign in to the blog’s content management system and 
submit your post to the blog.
 What responsibility do bloggers have to post 
accurate, verified information? Should users rely on 
wikis to verify content?
11:00 a.m. While you are driving to 
a doctor’s appointment, you receive 
several text messages on your 
smartphone. You use your Bluetooth 
headset and your smartphone’s 
speech-to-text feature to respond to 
the text messages without taking your eyes off of the road.
 Is it legal in your state to use hands-free devices 
while driving? What, if any, are the consequences of 
noncompliance?
1:00 p.m. Back at home, you flip through today’s mail. 
You received a bill for your monthly mortgage payment. 
Using your laptop, you navigate to your bank’s website 
and schedule a recurring payment for the mortgage to 
ensure you never will be late on a payment.
 What precautions should you take when accessing 
financial information and authorizing payments on the web?
5:30 p.m. Unsure of what to make for dinner, you 
use your tablet to view recipes you bookmarked on 
a bookmarking 
site. You verify 
that you have the 
ingredients on 
hand and follow 
the recipe on 
your tablet as you 
prepare dinner.
 Who owns the 
content posted to social networking or bookmarking 
sites? What risks are involved with using these types 
of websites?
8:30 p.m. While helping your daughter with her math 
homework, you discover a website that includes the 
answers to questions asked in her textbook. You have 
a discussion with your daughter about ethical issues 
surrounding posting and using that type of content.
 Should students receive punishment for using 
answers they find 
on a website?
9:00 p.m. 
You sit down 
to watch your 
favorite vocal 
competition 
reality show, streaming live through your Smart TV. 
The show enables you to send a text message to vote 
for your favorite contestant. You debate between two 
popular singers, then finally send your vote via text 
message.
 How else do TV, movie, and other entertainment 
websites use the Internet to interact with viewers or 
listeners?
10:30 p.m. You use the calendar app on your 
smartphone to confirm your schedule for tomorrow 
and then head to bed.

Netiquette
Netiquette, which is short for Internet etiquette, is the code of acceptable behaviors users 
should follow while on the Internet; that is, it is the conduct expected of individuals while 
online. Netiquette includes rules for all aspects of the Internet, including the web, social media, 
Internet messaging, chat rooms, online discussions, and FTP. Figure 2-31 outlines some of the 
rules of netiquette, with respect to online communications. Read Ethics & Issues 2-4 to consider 
issues related to an extreme misuse of online communications — online bullying.
Discover More: Visit this chapter’s free resources to learn more about emoticons.
Netiquette Guidelines for Online Communications
Golden Rule: Treat others as you would like them to treat you.
Be polite. Avoid offensive language.
Avoid sending or posting ﬂames, which are abusive or insulting messages. Do not participate in ﬂame wars,
which are exchanges of ﬂames.
Be careful when using sarcasm and humor, as it might be misinterpreted.
Do not use all capital letters, which is the equivalent of SHOUTING!
Use emoticons to express emotion. Popular emoticons include:
 
 
 
:o  Surprised
:(  Frown
:\  Undecided
;)  Wink
:|  Indifference
:)  Smile
Clearly identify a spoiler, which is a message that reveals an outcome to a game or ending to a movie or program.
Be forgiving of other’s mistakes.
Read the FAQ (frequently asked questions), if one exists.
 
Use abbreviations and acronyms for phrases:

Ethics & Issues 2-4
Who Is Responsible for Monitoring 
Cyberbullying? 
Sending or forwarding threatening text 
messages, posting embarrassing or altered 
pictures of someone without his or her per-
mission, or setting up a fake online social 
network page where others make cruel com-
ments and spread rumors about someone all 
are examples of cyberbullying. Cyberbullying 
is harassment using technology, often 
involving teens and preteens. Unlike verbal 
bullying, the perpetrators can hide behind 
the anonymity of the Internet and can reach 
a wide audience quickly. Victims cannot just 
walk away or ignore bullying that comes in 
the form of text messages, email, or online 
social network posts.
Cyberbullying often takes place outside 
of school hours on personal devices or 
computers not owned or monitored by 
a school. Yet the ramifications affect the 
victim at school. Schools struggle to come 
up with policies. Many schools are adopting 
policies that include consequences for any 
form of student-to-student bullying, even 
using nonschool resources, if it contributes 
to a hostile environment for any student or 
group of students. Some schools specify that 
students who retaliate against anyone who 
reports instances of bullying or cyberbullying 
will receive punishment.
Anti-bullying laws vary from state to state 
and often do not include specific language 
about cyberbullying. One argument against 
criminalizing cyberbullying is the protection 
of free speech. Awareness campaigns, 
school policies, and parent monitoring of 
technology use are some ways to attempt 
to prevent cyberbullying. These methods 
are not always effective. The impact on 
the victim can lead to poor grades, health 
issues, mental health concerns, and even 
suicide.
Consider This:  Should schools be 
­responsible for punishing students who 
cyberbully other students outside of school? 
Why or why not? What role can parents 
play in reducing cyberbullying? What are 
the positive and negative aspects of the

Transportation
What is transportation like without ­computers 
and mobile devices? Delivery drivers use 
clipboards to hold their records. Human navi-
gators use paper maps to track routes for 
pilots. Ship captains rely solely on experience 
to navigate through shallow waters. Today, 
the transportation industry relies heavily on 
computer and mobile device usage.
Many vehicles include onboard navigation 
systems to help you navigate from one 
location to another. Some of these systems 
provide other services, such as dispatching 
roadside assistance, unlocking the driver’s 
side door if you lock the keys in your vehicle, 
and tracking the vehicle if it is stolen.
The shipping and travel industries identify 
items during transport using bar codes, which 
are identification codes that consist of lines and 
spaces of different lengths. When you ship a 
package, the shipping company, such as UPS 
or FedEx, places a bar code on the package to 
indicate its destination to a computer. Because 
a package might travel to its destination by 
way of several trucks, trains, and airplanes, 
computers automatically route the package as 
efficiently as possible. You are able to visit a 
website or sign up for text message notifications 
to track a package’s progress during shipment.
When you travel by airplane, baggage 
handling systems ensure that your luggage 
reaches its destination on time. When you 
check in your baggage at the airport, a bar 
code identifies the airplane on which the 
bags should be placed. If you change planes, 
automated baggage handling systems route 
your bags to connecting flights with very 
little, if any, human intervention. When the 
bags reach their destination, they are routed 
automatically to the baggage carousel in the 
airport’s terminal building.
Pilots of high-technology commercial, 
military, and space aircraft today work in a 
glass cockpit, which features computerized 
instrumentation, navigation, communications, 
weather reports, and an autopilot. The 
electronic flight information shown on high-
resolution displays is designed to reduce pilot 
workload, decrease fatigue, and enable pilots 
to concentrate on flying safely.
Boats and ships also are equipped with 
computers that include detailed electronic 
maps, which help the captain navigate, as 
well as calculate the water depth and provide 
a layout of the underwater surface so that the 
captain can avoid obstructions.
As you travel the roadways, airways, and 
waterways, bear in mind that computers often 
are responsible for helping you to reach your 
destination as quickly and safely as possible.
  Consider This:  In what other ways do 
computers and technology play a role in the 
transportation industry?

Chapter 2  Connecting and Communicating Online
The Problem Solving exercises extend your knowledge of chapter concepts by seeking 
­solutions to practical problems with technology that you may encounter at home, school, work, 
or with nonprofit organizations. The Collaboration exercise should be completed with a team.
 Problem Solving
Instructions: You often can solve problems with technology in multiple ways. Determine a solution to the problems in these exercises by using 
one or more resources available to you (such as a computer or mobile device, articles on the web or in print, blogs, podcasts, videos, television, user 
guides, other individuals, electronics or computer stores, etc.). Describe your solution, along with the resource(s) used, in the format requested by 
your instructor (brief report, presentation, discussion, blog post, video, or other means).
Personal
1.	Cyberbullying Message  While reviewing the email 
messages in your email account, you notice one that 
you interpret as cyberbullying. You do not recognize the 
sender of the email message, but still take it seriously. 
What are your next steps?
2.	Unsolicited Friend Requests  You recently signed up 
for an account on the Facebook online social network. 
When you log in periodically, you find that people you 
do not know are requesting to be your friend. How 
should you respond?
3.	Unexpected Search Engine  A class project requires 
that you conduct research on the web. After typing the 
web address for Google’s home page and pressing the 
enter key, your browser redirects you to a different 
search engine. What could be wrong?
4.	Images Do Not Appear  When you navigate to a 
webpage, you notice that no images are appearing. 
You successfully have viewed webpages with images 
in the past and are not sure why images suddenly are 
not appearing. What steps will you take to show the 
images?
5.	Social Media Password  Your social media password 
has been saved on your computer for quite some time 
and the browser has been signing you in 
automatically. After deleting your browsing 
history and saved information from your 
browser, the online social network began 
prompting you again for your password, 
which you have forgotten. What are your 
next steps?
Professional
6.	Suspicious Website Visits  The director of your 
company’s information technology department sent 
you an email message stating that you have been 
spending an excessive amount of time viewing websites 
not related to your job. You periodically visit websites 
not related to work, but only on breaks, which 
the company allows. How does he know your web 
browsing habits? How will you respond to this claim?
7.	Automatic Response  When you return from vacation, 
a colleague informs you that when she sent email 
messages to your email address, she would not always 
receive your automatic response stating that you were 
out of the office. Why might your email program not 
respond automatically to every email message received?
8.	Email Message Formatting  A friend sent an email 
message containing a photo to your email account at 
work. Upon receiving the email message, the photo 
does not appear. You also notice that email messages 
never show any formatting, such as different fonts, font 
sizes, and font colors. What might be causing this?
9.	Mobile Hot Spot Not Found  Your supervisor gave 
you a mobile hot spot to use while you are traveling to a 
conference in another state. When you attempt to connect 
to the hot spot with your computer, tablet, and phone, 
none of the devices is able to find any wireless networks. 
What might be the problem, and what are your next steps?
10.	Sporadic Email Message Delivery  The email 
program on your computer has been displaying new 
messages only every hour, on the hour. Historically, new 
email messages would arrive and be displayed immediately 
upon being sent by the sender. Furthermore, your 
coworkers claim that they sometimes do not receive your 
email messages until hours after you send them. What 
might be the problem?
Collaboration
11.	Technology in Transportation  Your project team has been assigned to present a business proposal to a group 
of potential investors. Because the presentation will take place in Kansas City, Missouri, you will need to transport 
people and ship some materials to that location. Form a team of three people and determine how to use technology 
to ship materials and how to make travel arrangements. One team member should research the steps required to 
use a website to make flight reservations, one team member should determine the steps necessary to print a package 
shipping label from his or her computer and track the package while it is en route, and another team member should 
find directions from Kansas City International Airport to a nearby hotel.

Participate in an Online Auction
Online auctions allow consumers to bid on products that 
other people are selling. If you are the highest bidder at the 
end of the bidding period, you often can arrange payment 
through the online auction. The following steps guide you 
through the process of participating in an online auction.
WARNING: Do not purchase or bid on an item 
if you do not intend to purchase it. If you win the 
auction, you legally may be obligated to provide 
payment for the item. 
a. Run a browser and then navigate to www.ebay.com.
b. Tap or click the link to register for a new account.
c. Enter the requested information to create the 
account.
d. Search for an item on which you would like to bid. 
If you want to browse items in a specific category 
instead, tap or click the link to browse for items by 
category.
e. When the search results appear, tap or click an 
item that interests you to see more details about 
the item.
f. Review the item details to determine whether you 
would like to bid on this item. If the item does not 
interest you, return to the search results and select 
another item.
g. The seller may have a “Buy It Now” option that 
allows you to purchase the item immediately at 
a predetermined price. Alternatively, you can 
bid on the item by making an offer. The highest 
bidder at the end of the auction will win the item. 
Remember: If you bid on and win an item, you 
are obligated to provide payment. 
h. You will be notified if you are the winning bidder 
when the auction closes. At that time, follow the 
instructions to arrange to pay the seller.
i. When you are finished, sign out of eBay.
The How To: Your Turn exercises present general guidelines for fundamental skills

View and Manage Data Usage
Many people have limited data plans, so it is important to 
know how to view the amount of data you have used on 
your phone or tablet when you are not connected to the 
Internet using a Wi-Fi connection. If you are using a phone 
or tablet where Wi-Fi is available, you should strongly 
consider using the Wi-Fi connection not only to limit data 
plan usage, but also to experience faster speed. If you find 
that your data usage is high each month, you may be able 
to see which apps are using the most data and adjust usage 
of those apps accordingly. The following steps guide you 
through the process of viewing and managing data usage.
a. Display the settings on your mobile device.
b. Select the option to view data usage.
c. If necessary, tap the option to display a list of apps 
and how much data each app uses. If necessary, 
select the time period for which you want to see 
the data usage.
d. If you notice an app using a large amount of data, 
tap the app to see details for that app. If necessary, 
disable background data transfer for the app. 
Background data transfer is data the app downloads 
and uploads even while you are not actively using 
the app.
e. If you want your mobile device to notify you when 
you are approaching your monthly data limit, set 
the necessary notification option and select a value 
under your monthly data limit in the appropriate 
area.
f. If you want your mobile device to turn off data 
(this does not include Wi-Fi) when you reach a 
certain limit, set the necessary option and then 
select a value that is just less than your monthly 
data limit to ensure you never reach or exceed the 
limit.
g. Save all changes.
Exercises
1. Do you have a data limit on your mobile data plan? If 
so, what is it?
2. When you enter an area with Wi-Fi, do you configure 
your mobile device to connect to the Wi-Fi? Why or 
why not?
3. Review the mobile data usage on your mobile device. 
Which app uses the most data? Which app uses the 
least data?

Search for a Job Online
If you know the company for which you would like to 
work, you may be able to visit that company’s website and 
search for a webpage with current job postings. If you 
would like to search for openings in multiple companies, 
consider using a job search website. The following steps 
guide you through the process of searching for a job 
online.
a. Run a browser.
b. Use a search engine to locate a job search website 
and then navigate to the website.
c. Many job search websites allow you to search for jobs

Send Email Messages Using Various Email 
Programs and Web Apps
The process required to send an email message using a 
computer or mobile device from various email programs 
and web apps is very similar. The following steps guide 
you through the process of sending email 
messages using various email programs and 
web apps.
a. Run the email program or navigate to 
the email web app on your computer 
or mobile device.
b. Locate and then tap or click the 
button to compose a new email 
message.
c. Type the recipient’s email address in 
the To text box. If you are sending the 
email message to multiple recipients, 
separate each email address with a 
semicolon (;).
d. If you would like to send a carbon 
copy of the email message to one or 
more people, type their email address(es) in the Cc 
text box (which stands for carbon copy).
e. To send a copy of the email message to someone 
while hiding his or her email address from the 
other recipients, enter his or her email address in 
the Bcc text box (which stands for blind carbon 
copy). The email recipients listed in the To or Cc 
text boxes will not be able to see the recipients you 
specified in the Bcc text box.
f. Enter a descriptive subject in the Subject text box. 
It is not good practice to leave the subject blank 
when you send an email message because the 
recipient’s email server may place messages without 
a subject in a spam or junk mail folder.
g. Type the body of the email message in the 
appropriate area.
h. If your email program supports it, check the 
spelling of your email message and correct any 
errors found.
i. Tap or click the Send button, which sends the 
email message to everyone listed in the To, Cc, and 
Bcc text boxes.
Exercises
1. Under what circumstances might you want to send a 
blind carbon copy of an email message to one or more 
people?
2. Send an email message to your instructor and put your 
email address in the Cc text box. Use an appropriate 
subject and tell your instructor you have successfully 
completed this exercise.
3. Search for and evaluate three web apps that can send 
and receive email. Which one is your favorite, and why?

Making Use of the Web 
Online Social Networks and Media Sharing 
Every second, an average of 5,700 Tweets and 41,000 
Facebook posts are created. With these impressive 
numbers, it is no wonder that online social media have 
become ubiquitous throughout the world. Twitter, 
Facebook, and other online social networks, especially 
those featured in Mini Feature 2-2 in this chapter, 
are popular among users of all ages. Likewise, media 
­sharing sites, such as YouTube, which is shown in 
Figure 2-11 in this chapter, are popular means of 
managing and sharing photos, videos, and music.
Research This: Visit two of the websites discussed 
in Mini Feature 2-2 or other online social networks 
and create a profile if you do not currently have one. 
What personal information is required to join? Does 
either website ask for personal information that you are 
uncomfortable sharing? How does the content of these 
two websites differ? Which features are beneficial for 
casual users, and which are targeted toward business or 
professional users? Then, visit two social media sites. 
What personal information is required to join? Are 
these websites supported by advertisements? Locate the 
instructions for posting media. Are these instructions 
straightforward? Do these websites impose a limit on 
the number and/or size of media files a user can post?
2	
Social Media 
Most social media companies have invested millions of 
dollars to develop and maintain their websites. Unlike 
other commercial media, such as television, radio, and 
newspapers, advertisements generally are not used 
to fund the majority of operating costs, nor are users 
required to pay monthly or annual fees for basic ser-
vices that they receive at no cost. One method that 
social media sites use to generate start-up and ongoing 
subsidies is through venture capitalists’ funding. These 
investors scrutinize business plans and market trends 
in an effort to locate Internet start-up companies with 
the potential to generate substantial returns. Once the 
businesses are running, additional monies are needed 
to maintain and improve the websites. At this point, 
some websites display advertisements. The charge 
for companies to place an advertisement generally 
increases as the number of subscribers grows. Another 
method of generating income is to charge users for 
accessing premium content. Online dating services use 
this tactic successfully, for they allow people to browse 
online profiles free of charge but require them to pay 
to contact a potential dating match.
Research This: Locate venture capitalists who are 
­seeking Internet start-up companies. Which criteria do 
they use to make investment decisions? Who are the suc-
cessful venture capitalists, and which companies have they 
funded? Which types of advertisements are displayed on 
specific social media and online social networks? How 
does the content of these ads pertain to the demographics 
and interests of users?
3   Search Skills  
Understand Search Results 
Search results display the most relevant 
results first. Search results may include 
links to websites, news stories, images, 
videos, maps, and information from 
Wikipedia and other online databases. 
Results also may show links to simi-
lar searches, related people, or posts 
from online social networks or social 
media sites.
Because many search engines rely on advertising for 
revenue, some search results are paid advertisements. 
Companies and organizations may pay search provid-
ers to display links to their websites prominently in the

search results when search text contains words relevant 
to their products and services. Paid ads often appear 
at the top or along the side of a search results page. 
A search results page may display an icon or use shad-
ing to specify that the search result is an advertisement.
When evaluating the reliability of search results, 
consider the sources of the information provided. 
Specialized information such as medical advice or 
stock performance should come from recogniz-
able sources in those areas, while you might rely on 
reviews from customers when selecting a restaurant or 
purchasing a smartphone.
Research This: Type each search text phrase listed 
in the paragraph below into the search boxes in Bing, 
Google, and Yahoo! and then take a screenshot of the 
first page of search results from each. Compare them, 
identifying ads, news, images, videos, social media 
­results, information from online databases, search 
tools, and common links that both search engines 
returned. Which search engine’s results do you find 
more useful in each case? Why?
Type the following search text: (1) internet service 
providers, (2) google corporate headquarters, (3) flights 
from boston to los angeles, and (4) identity theft.

Security 
Cybercriminals may lurk in public Wi-Fi hot spots, as 
you learned in Secure IT 2-1 in this chapter. These 
thieves also may be on the lookout for customers 
entering their PIN at keypads near cash registers 
or at ATMs. Body heat from fingers touching the 
keys remains for a short time, and a device with 
infrared-scanning capabilities can detect which keys 
are warmer than others. This device, which is readily 
available for purchase at cell phone accessories stores, 
snaps on the back of cell phones. It captures the ther-
mal heat signatures, with the most recently touched 
keys glowing red and the cooler keys glowing light 
green. The thief, therefore, knows which keys com-
prise the PIN and the sequence of numbers by look-
ing at the intensity of colors on the infrared scan.
Research This: How much does a thermal imaging 
cell phone case cost? Which brand of phone is more 
commonly used to capture thermal imaging? What 
steps can consumers take to thwart thieves using 
infrared scanning? Which key materials are less apt to 
retain the thermal signatures: metal, rubber, or plastic? 
Researchers from which university published a paper 
discussing thermal camera-based attacks?

Cloud Services  
Collaboration and Productivity (SaaS) 
Microsoft’s Office Online and Google Docs are online 
productivity suites for creating documents, presenta-
tions, spreadsheets, and other projects. Microsoft and 
Google offer these apps as part of their respective 
cloud storage services. Because documents are stored 
on the cloud, you can access them from any computer 
or device connected to the Internet.
These are examples of SaaS (software as a service), 
a service of cloud computing that allows access to 
software using a browser, without the need to install 
software on a computer or device. As providers update 
their software, users receive the latest version upon 
signing in. SaaS apps often allow users to collaborate 
and share their work with other users. Many provid-
ers offer SaaS titles at no cost; others require users to 
purchase a subscription or pay a fee for the features 
they use.
Research This: (1) Sign up for accounts on Microsoft 
OneDrive and Google Drive to create and store docu-
ments with Office Online and Google Docs. With each 
app, create a document, share it with another user, and 
edit it simultaneously. What is an advantage of sharing 
documents over sending the files by email to collabora-
tors? (2) How do Microsoft Office Online and Google 
Docs compare with Microsoft Office installed on your 
computer? What features are available on the cloud 
that are not possible on a desktop version?

 Critical Thinking
Instructions: Evaluate the situations below, using personal experiences and one or more resources available to you (such as articles on the web or in 
print, blogs, podcasts, videos, television, user guides, other individuals, electronics or computer stores, etc.). Perform the tasks requested in each ­exercise 
and share your deliverables in the format requested by your instructor (brief report, presentation, discussion, blog post, video, or other means).
The Critical Thinking exercises challenge your assessment and decision-making 
skills by presenting real-world situations associated with chapter concepts. The 
Collaboration exercise should be completed with a team.
1.	Mobile Browser Comparison 
Although most mobile devices include a mobile 
browser, users have the option of downloading and 
installing other browsers.
Do This: Evaluate and 
­compare reviews of at least 
four mobile browsers, such 
as Android, Firefox, Opera, 
Safari, or Silk. Discuss the 
major differences among the 
browsers you researched, 
including number and types 
of features, which devices are 
compatible, how they display 
webpages, security features, 
and the speed at which they 
perform. Discuss any expe-
riences you or your class-
mates have had with various 
­browsers. Include in your discussion which mobile 
browser you would recommend and why.
2.	Acceptable Use Policy  
Most businesses provide Wi-Fi and Internet 
access, as well as compatible computers or devices, 
to employees while they are at work. While the 
intention is for employees to use the Internet for 
work-related purposes, employees often find it easy 
to become distracted with other activities on the 
Internet, such as social media, checking personal 
email messages, playing games, or visiting websites for 
entertainment. These activities can degrade Internet 
access for others or lead to poor performance, as 
well as expose the company to malware or other 
risks. Many businesses create an acceptable use 
policy (AUP) that outlines how employees should use 
the Internet. It also may outline consequences for 
unauthorized Internet use.
Do This: Locate two AUPs published online. 
­Compare the two policies and then create a policy you 
believe would be fair to employees of a small business. 
Include guidelines for Internet use during breaks, use 
of smartphones, and restrictions for using social media.
3.	Case Study 
Amateur Sports League  You are the new manager 
for a nonprofit amateur soccer league. The league 
needs a website. You prepare information about the 
website to present to the board of directors.
Do This: First, you plan the website by ­determining 
its purpose and audience. Use a search engine to 
locate two sports league websites, and print their 
home pages. Identify what you like and do not like 
about each. Think about the design of your website, 
and select the colors you would recommend. Describe 
the types of media you would include on the webpage 
and give specific examples, such as a logo, photos or 
a slide show, or links to videos. Make a sketch of the 
home page layout, including navigation, media, and 
text. Research content management systems. Evalu-
ate whether you could use a preformatted template to 
meet your needs, and find what types of customization 
options are available. Determine whether you need a 
separate ISP for hosting the website, and calculate the 
costs. List ways you will maintain and update the site 
content. Compile your findings.
Collaboration 
4.	Website Evaluation  You and three teammates want to open a new chain of fast food sandwich shops. You envision 
a website that includes a menu, nutritional options, and allergy information, and that has regular promotions and 
special offers.
Do This: With your teammates, evaluate existing fast food and sandwich websites by comparing the advantages and 
disadvantages of each. Assign each member the task of evaluating one chain. Team members should print the home 
page of the assigned website and evaluate each restaurants’ website. Pay particular attention to the following areas:  
(1) design, (2) ease of use, (3) menu, (4) nutritional information, (5) allergy information, (6) special offers,  
(7) location information and directions, and (8) hours and contact information. Summarize your evaluations and rank 
the websites in terms of their effectiveness. Be sure to include brief explanations supporting your rankings.

Computers and Mobile Devices
As Chapter 1 discussed, a computer is an electronic device, operating under the control of 
instructions stored in its own memory, that can accept data (input), process the data according to 
specified rules, produce information (output), and store the information for future use. A mobile 
device is a computing device small enough to hold in your hand. Types of computers and mobiles 
devices include laptops, tablets, and desktops; servers and terminals; smartphones, digital cam-
eras, e-book readers, portable and digital media players, and wearable devices; game devices; and 
embedded computers. Figure 3-1 shows a variety of computers and mobile devices.
In addition to discussing features, functions, and purchasing guidelines of computers and 
mobile devices, this chapter also presents ways to connect peripheral devices, protect com-
puters and mobile devices from theft and failure, and minimize your health risks while using 
­computers and mobile devices.
Mobile Computers and Desktops
A mobile computer is a portable personal computer, such as a laptop or tablet, designed so that 
a user easily can carry it from place to place, whereas a desktop is designed to be in a station-
ary location. A personal computer (PC) is a mobile computer or desktop that can perform all of 
its input, processing, output, and storage activities by itself and is intended to be used by one 
person at a time. Personal computers often are differentiated by the type of operating system 
they use, with Windows and Mac operating systems leading the market share. Companies such 
as Acer, Dell, Lenovo, HP (Hewlett-Packard), and Samsung sell personal computers that use 
the Windows operating system, and Apple sells personal computers that use the Mac operating 
­system. Other operating systems for personal computers include Linux and Chrome OS.

What is inside a personal computer?
The electronic components and circuitry of a personal 
computer usually are part of or are connected to a 
motherboard (Figure 3-2). A motherboard, sometimes 
called a system board, is the main circuit board of 
the personal computer. Many electronic components 
attach to the motherboard; others are built into it. 
Two main components on the motherboard are the 
processor and memory. Many motherboards also 
integrate sound, video, and networking capabilities.
A processor, also called a CPU (central processing 
unit), is the electronic component that interprets 
and carries out the basic instructions that operate a 
computer. Memory consists of electronic components 
that store instructions waiting to be executed and 
data needed by those instructions.

Avoid Malware Infections
Some websites contain tempting offers to 
download free games and music, install 
toolbars that offer convenience, enter con-
tests, and receive coupons on your comput-
ers or mobile devices. Danger, however, may 
lurk in those files, for they secretly could 
install malware with effects ranging from a 
mild annoyance to a severe problem such 
as identity theft. Recall that malware is 
malicious software that acts without your 
knowledge and deliberately alters opera-
tions of your computer or mobile device. As 
a general rule, do not install or download 
unfamiliar software. Follow these guidelines 
to minimize the chance of your computer 
or mobile device becoming infected with 
malware:
• Social media: Malware authors often 
focus on social media, with the goal of 
stealing personal information, such as 
passwords, profiles, contact lists, and credit 
card account details. Their websites urge 
unsuspecting users to take surveys, tap or 
click links to obtain free merchandise and 
games, and download antivirus programs. 
Ignore these deceitful tactics.
• Email: Spam (unsolicited email messages) 
can be loaded with malware, but even 
email messages from friends can be a 
culprit. If the message does not contain a 
subject line or contains links or an attach-
ment, exercise caution. One option is to 
save the attachment to your computer so 
that antivirus software can scan the file for 
possible malware before you open it. Your 
best practice is to avoid opening suspicious 
messages at all costs.
• Flash memory storage: Colleagues and 
friends may hand you a USB flash drive or 
memory card with software, photos, and 
other files. Scan these media with security 
software before opening any files.
• Pop-up windows: At times, a window 
may open suddenly (called a pop-up 
window), with a warning that your 
computer is infected with a virus or that 
a security breach has occurred, and then 
make an urgent request to download free 
software to scan your computer or mobile 
device and correct the alleged problem. 
Beware. Many of these offers actually are 
rogue security software that will infect a 
computer.
• Websites: Websites you visit or pop-up 
windows may present instructions to 
download new software or update cur-
rent programs installed on a computer or 
mobile device. If you are uncertain of their 
legitimacy, exit and research the software 
by reading reviews online before you 
decide to install it.
• Software: Occasionally, some seemingly 
safe software attempts to install malware. 
Even worse, some software touted as offer-
ing malware protection actually installs more 
malware. Always obtain software from repu-
table sources and, if possible, update soft-
ware directly from manufacturers’ websites. 
Consider using the custom installation option 
to ensure that only the desired software is 
installed. Read the permissions dialog boxes 
that are displayed on your screen before 
tapping or clicking the OK or Agree buttons. 
If you are uncertain about the messages you 
are viewing, cancel the installation.
• Smartphones: Malware creators are 
targeting smartphones, particularly those 
using the Android operating system. While 
an estimated 80 percent of all smart-
phones are unprotected now, savvy users 
are obtaining protection from malware 
attacks. Read reviews before downloading 
antimalware apps from trusted sources.
  Consider This: What online activities 
might cause malware to be installed on your 
computer? Which specific websites provide 
reputable antimalware apps for mobile 
devices? What new techniques will you use to 
avoid malware?

Laptops, Tablets, and Other Mobile Computers
A laptop, also called a notebook computer, is a thin, lightweight mobile computer with a screen 
in its lid and a keyboard in its base (Figure 3-3). Designed to fit on your lap and for easy trans-
port, most laptops weigh up to 7 pounds (varying by manufacturer and specifications) and can be 
as powerful as the average desktop.
Laptops have input devices, such as a keyboard, touchpad, and webcam; output devices, such 
as a screen and speakers; a storage device(s), such as a hard drive and maybe an optical disc 
drive; and usually built-in wireless communications capability. Some laptops have touch screens. 
Most can operate on batteries or a power supply or both. Read Ethics & Issues 3-1 to consider 
issues related to laptops and other devices with cameras.

What Punishment for Webcam Spying  
Is Appropriate?
Microphones, digital cameras, and webcams 
have many practical and harmless uses. These 
technologies also can leave you open to spy-
ing. For example, one school district used 
software, which was supposed to track the 
school-distributed laptops in case of theft, to 
take photos and screen captures of students. 
In another instance, a person noticed that 
when she gave a customer service rep access 
to her computer, he turned on her webcam 
without asking for her permission.
Cybercriminals can use spy tools that take 
photos, or record video or audio, without 
turning on a light or other notification that 
indicates your camera or microphone is in 
use. The Flame virus is one way for spy tools 
to infect your computer. Security experts 
recommend using a sticker to cover your 
webcam, and inserting a dummy plug in the 
microphone port when you are not using it.
These technologies also allow people to 
take photos or videos in a public setting 
and share them without your knowledge. 
A director at the American Civil Liberties 
Union stated that when you are in a public 
place, people have the right to photograph 
you. Privacy advocates criticize Google 
Street View, however, which takes images 
captured using moving vehicles equipped 
with GPS and cameras and then creates a 
panoramic view of an area, including people 
entering and exiting buildings or relaxing on 
a beach.
Many states’ laws do not cover these 
types of acts. Massachusetts, however, 
recently passed a law that made secretly 
taking photos or videos that focused on 
people’s private body parts a criminal offense. 
Lawmakers continue to debate and expand 
current laws, as well as pass new ones.
Consider This:   Should webcam spying 
punishments be comparable to other types 
of spying? Why or why not? What kind of 
privacy should you expect when you are in 
a public place?
Ultrathin laptops weigh less than traditional laptops, usually have a longer battery life, and 
generally run the Windows operating system. In order to minimize their thickness, many 
ultrathin laptops have fewer ports than traditional ­laptops, do not include an optical disc drive, 
and often require the use of special dongles to attach cables that connect to external displays 
or a network. (Recall that a dongle is a small device that connects to a computer and enables 
­additional functions when attached.)

Ultrabooks
An ultrathin laptop that 
uses a low-power Intel 
processor often is called 
an ultrabook.

Chapter 3  Computers and Mobile Devices
Tablets  Usually smaller than a laptop but larger than a phone, a tablet is a thin, lighter-
weight mobile computer that has a touch screen.
Two popular form factors (shapes and sizes) of tablets are the slate and convertible  
(Figure 3-4). Resembling a letter-sized pad, a slate tablet is a type of tablet that does not contain 
a physical keyboard. A convertible tablet is a tablet that has a screen it its lid and a keyboard in its 
base, with the lid and base connected by a swivel-type hinge. You can use a convertible tablet 
like a traditional laptop, or you can rotate the display and fold it down over the keyboard so that 
it looks like a slate tablet. As with laptops, tablets run on batteries or a power supply or both; 
however, batteries in a tablet typically last longer than those in laptops.
Some tablets include a stylus, which looks like a small ink pen, that you can use instead of a 
fingertip to enter data, make selections, or draw on a touch screen. A stylus may include ­buttons 
you can press to simulate clicking a mouse. As an alternative to interacting with the touch 
screen, some users prefer to purchase a separate physical keyboard that attaches to or wirelessly 
communicates with the tablet (shown with the slate tablet in Figure 3-4).
Tablets are useful especially for taking notes in class, at meetings, at conferences, and in other 
forums where the standard laptop is not practical. Because slate tablets can have a more durable 
construction, they often are used in the medical field and other areas where exposure to germs, 
heat, humidity, dust, and other contaminants is greater.
BTW
Pens
Some tablet 
manufacturers refer  
to a stylus as a pen.
Consider This
What is a phablet?
Some manufacturers use the term, phablet, to refer to a device 
that combines features of a smartphone with a tablet (Figure 3-5). 
These devices are larger than smartphones but smaller than full-
sized tablets. The screen on a phablet usually measures five to 
seven inches diagonally. Some include a stylus.

Handheld Computers
A handheld computer is a computer small enough to fit in 
one hand. Many handheld computers communicate wire-
lessly with other devices or computers. Some handheld 
computers have miniature or specialized keyboards. Others 
have a touch screen and also include a stylus for input. 
Many handheld computers are industry-specific and 
serve the needs of mobile employees, such as parcel 
delivery people or warehouse employees (Figure 3-6), 
whose jobs require them to move from place to place. 
Handheld computers often send data wirelessly to 
­central office ­computers.

Mini Feature 3-1: Mobile Computer Buyer’s Guide
If you need computing capability while traveling and during lectures or meetings, you may 
find a ­laptop or tablet to be an appropriate choice. Read Mini Feature 3-1 for tips to consider 
when purchasing a mobile computer.
Mobile Computer 
Buyer’s Guide
With the abundance of mobile computer manufacturers, 
research each before making a purchase. The following are 
purchasing considerations unique to mobile computers.
1.	 Determine which mobile computer form ­factor 
fits your needs. Consider a tablet or ultrathin lap-
top if you require a lightweight device and the most 
mobility. If you require additional ports or want the 
computer’s capabilities to be more comparable to a 
desktop, consider purchasing a traditional laptop.
2.	 Consider a mobile computer with a 
­sufficiently large screen. Laptops and tablets 
are available with various screen sizes. For example, 
most traditional and ultrathin laptop screens range 
in size from 11 to 18 inches, while most tablet 
screens range in size from 7 to 12 inches.
3.	 Experiment with different keyboards and 
pointing devices. Mobile computers often vary 
in size, and for that reason have different keyboard 
layouts. Familiarize yourself with the keyboard layout 
of the computer you want to purchase, and make 
sure it is right for you. If you have large fingers, 
for example, you should not purchase a computer 
with a small, condensed keyboard. Laptops typically 
include a touchpad to control the pointer. Tablets 
have a touch screen and an on-screen keyboard.
4.	 Consider processor, memory, and storage 
upgrades at the time of purchase. As with a 
desktop, upgrading a mobile computer’s memory and 
internal storage may be less expensive at the time 
of initial purchase. Some internal storage is custom 
designed for mobile computer manufacturers, mean-
ing an upgrade might not be available in the future.
5.	 The availability of built-in ports and slots 
is ­important. Determine which ports and slots 
­(discussed later in this chapter) you require on the 
mobile computer. If you plan to transfer photos from 
a digital camera using a memory card, consider a 
mobile computer with a built-in card slot compatible 
with your digital camera’s memory card. If you plan 
to connect devices such as a printer or USB flash 
drive to your mobile computer, consider purchasing 
one with a sufficient number of USB ports. In addi-
tion, evaluate mobile computers with ports enabling 
you to connect an external monitor.
6.	 If you plan to use your mobile computer for 
a long time without access to an electrical 
outlet, or if the battery life for the mobile 
computer you want to purchase is not suf-
ficient, consider purchasing a second battery. 
Some mobile computers, such as most tablets and 
ultrathin laptops, have built-in batteries that can be 
replaced only by a qualified technician. In that case, 
you might look into options for external battery 
packs or power sources.
7.	 Purchase a well-padded and well-designed 
­carrying case that is comfortable and ergo-
nomic. An amply padded carrying case will 
protect your mobile computer from the bumps 
it may receive while traveling. A well-designed 
­carrying case will have room for accessories 
such as USB flash drives, pens, and paperwork. 
Although a mobile computer may be small enough 
to fit in a handbag, make sure that the bag has 
sufficient padding to protect the computer. Test the 
carrying case with the laptop inside to ensure it is 
comfortable and ergonomic.
8.	 If you plan to connect your mobile computer 
to a video projector, make sure the mobile 
computer is compatible with the video 
­projector. You should check, for example, to be sure 
that your mobile computer will allow you to display 
an image on the screen and projection device at the 
same time. Also, ensure that the mobile computer 
has the ports required or that you have the necessary 
dongle and cables to connect to the video projector.

needs, should you purchase a traditional laptop, 
ultrathin laptop, or tablet? What are the specifications 
of the mobile computer you would purchase?

Chapter 3  Computers and Mobile Devices
Desktops and All-in-Ones
A desktop, or desktop computer, is a personal computer designed to be in a stationary 
­location, where all of its components fit on or under a desk or table (Figure 3-7). Components 
that typically occupy space outside of a desktop include peripheral devices such as a keyboard, 
mouse, and webcam (input devices); speakers and printer (output devices); external hard drive 
(storage device); and possibly a router and/or modem (communications devices). Depending on 
the form factor of the desktop, it may also require an external monitor.
Some people use the term, system unit, to refer to the case that contains and protects the 
­motherboard, internal hard drive, memory, and other electronic components of the computer 
from damage. A desktop may have a system unit tower that is a separate device from a monitor. 
A tower, which is made of metal or plastic, is a frame that houses the system unit on a desktop. 
Towers are available in a variety of form factors. Although they can range in height from  
12 inches to 30 inches or more, the trend is toward smaller desktop tower form factors. An  
all-in-one (AIO) or all-in-one desktop, by contrast, does not have a tower and instead houses the 
display, system unit, and possibly an optical drive, in the same case.

Who uses desktops?
Home and business users who do not require the portability of a mobile computer may work with desktops for 
their everyday computing needs. Gaming enthusiasts often choose a gaming desktop, which offers high-quality 
audio, video, and graphics with optimal performance for sophisticated single-user and networked or Internet 
multiplayer games. Power users may work with a high-end desktop, sometimes called a workstation, that is 
designed to handle intense calculations and sophisticated graphics. For example, architects use powerful desktops 
to design buildings and homes, and graphic artists use them to create computer-animated special effects for  
full-length motion pictures and video games. Some users configure a desktop to function as a server on a network 
(servers are discussed later in this chapter).

Mini Feature 3-2: Desktop Buyer’s Guide
Desktops are a suitable option if you work mostly in one place and have plenty of space in a 
work area. Read Mini Feature 3-2 for tips to consider when purchasing a desktop.
Desktop Buyer’s Guide
Today, desktop manufacturers emphasize desktop style 
by offering bright colors, trendy displays, and theme-
based towers so that the computer looks attractive if it 
is in an area of high visibility. If you have decided that 
a desktop is most suited to your technology needs, the 
next step is to determine specific software, hardware, 
peripheral devices, and services to purchase, as well 
as where to buy the computer. The following consider-
ations will help you determine the appropriate desktop 
to purchase.
1.	 Determine the specific software to use on 
the ­desktop. Decide which software contains the 
features necessary for the tasks you want to per-
form. Your hardware requirements depend on the 
minimum requirements of the software you plan to 
use on the desktop.
2.	 Know the system requirements of the 
­operating system. Determine the operating 
system you want to use because this also dictates 
hardware requirements. If, however, you purchase 
a new desktop, chances are it will include the 
latest version of your preferred operating system 
(Windows, Mac OS, or Linux).
3.	 Look for bundled software. Purchasing software 
at the same time you purchase a desktop may be 
less expensive than purchasing the software at a 
later date.
4.	 Avoid purchasing the least powerful desk-
top available. Technology changes rapidly, 
which means a desktop that seems powerful 
enough today may not serve your computing 
needs in the future. Purchasing a desktop with 
the most memory, largest hard drive capacity, and 
fastest processor you can afford will help delay 
­obsolescence.
5.	 Consider upgrades to the keyboard, mouse, 
monitor, printer, microphone, and speakers. 
You use these peripheral devices to interact with the 
desktop, so make sure they meet your standards.
6.	 Consider a touch screen monitor. A touch  
screen monitor will enable you to interact with 
the latest operating systems and apps using 
touch input.
  7.	  Evaluate all-in-ones, which may be less 
expensive than purchasing a tower and mon-
itor separately. In addition, all-in-ones take up less 
space and often look more attractive than desktops 
with separate towers.
  8.	  If you are buying a new desktop, you have 
several purchasing options: buy directly from 
a school bookstore, a local computer dealer, or a 
large retail store, or order from a vendor by mail, 
phone, or the web. Each purchasing option has its 
advantages. Explore each option to find the best 
combination of price and service.
  9.	  Be aware of additional costs. Along with the 
desktop itself, you also may need to make extra pur-
chases. For example, you might purchase computer fur-
niture, an uninterruptable power supply (UPS) or surge 
protector (discussed later in the chapter), an external 
hard drive, a printer, a router, or a USB flash drive.
10.	  If you use your computer for business or 
require fast resolution of major computer 
problems, consider purchasing an extended 
warranty or a service plan through a local 
dealer or third-party company. Most extended 
warranties cover the repair and replacement of com-
puter components beyond the standard warranty.

Chapter 3  Computers and Mobile Devices
Servers
A server is a computer dedicated to ­providing 
one or more services to other computers or 
devices on a network. Services provided by serv-
ers include storing content and ­controlling access 
to hardware, software, and other resources on a 
network. In many cases, a server accesses data, 
information, and programs on another server. In 
other cases, personal computers, devices, or ter-
minals (discussed in the next ­section) access data, 
information, and programs on a server. Servers 
can support from two to several thousand con-
nected computers or devices at the same time.
Some servers, called dedicated servers, 
­perform a specific service and can be placed 
with other dedicated servers to perform mul-
tiple services (Table 3-1). Each type of dedicated 
server uses software designed specifically to 
manage its service. Dedicated servers typically 
require a faster processor, more memory, and 
additional storage.
Servers typically include a processor, ­memory, 
­storage, and network ­connections. Depending on its function, a server may or may not 
require a monitor or an input device. Some servers are controlled from remote computers. 
Form factors for servers include rack server, blade server, and tower server, which are shown 
in Figure 3-8 and briefly described below.
Consider This
Which server should you use?
Home or small business users and organizations with ample 
floor space often choose tower servers. (Some home users even 
use a desktop tower or powerful laptop to act as a home server.) 
Data centers and other organizations looking to conserve floor 
space often choose rack servers or blade servers. Organizations 
that require a large quantity of servers usually opt for blade 
servers.

• A rack server, sometimes called a rack-mounted 
server, is a server that is housed in a slot (bay) on 
a metal frame (rack). A rack can contain multiple 
servers, each in a different bay. The rack is fastened 
in place to a flat surface.
• A blade server is a server in the form of a single 
circuit board, or blade. The individual blades insert 
in a blade server chassis that can hold many blades. 
Like a rack server, the chassis is fastened in place to 
a flat surface.
• A tower server is a server built into an upright 
cabinet (tower) that stands alone. The tower can 
be similar in size and shape to a desktop tower or 
larger.

Some organizations use virtualization to improve utilization of technology. Virtualization is the 
practice of sharing or pooling computing resources, such as servers and storage devices. Server 
virtualization uses software to enable a physical server to emulate the hardware and computing 
capabilities of one or more servers, known as virtual servers. Users can use software to configure 
the storage, processing power, memory, operating system, and other characteristics of virtual 
servers. From the end user’s point of view, a virtual server behaves just like a physical server. The 
advantages are that a virtual server can be created and configured quickly, does not require a new 
physical server, and is easier to manage. Cloud computing, discussed later in this chapter, uses 
server virtualization.
Major corporations use server farms, mainframes, or other types of servers for business 
­activities to process everyday transactions (Figure 3-9). A server farm is a network of several serv-
ers together in a single location. Server farms make it possible to combine the power of multiple 
servers. A mainframe is a large, expensive, powerful server that can handle hundreds or thousands 
of connected users simultaneously. Enterprises use server farms, mainframes, or other large 
servers to bill millions of customers, prepare payroll for thousands of employees, and manage 
­millions of items in inventory.
Figure 3-9  Server farms and mainframes can handle thousands of connected computers and 
process millions of instructions per second.

Terminals
A terminal is a computer, usually with limited processing power, that enables users to send data 
to and/or receive information from a server, or host computer. The host computer processes 
the data and then, if necessary, sends information (output) back to the terminal. Terminals may 
include a monitor and/or touch screen, keyboard, and memory.
A thin client is a terminal that looks like a desktop but has limited capabilities and components. 
Because thin clients typically do not contain a hard drive, they run programs and access data on 
a network or the Internet. Public locations, such as libraries and schools, and enterprises some-
times use thin clients because they cost less, are easier to maintain, last longer, use less power, 
and are less susceptible to malware attacks than desktops.

Chapter 3  Computers and Mobile Devices
Special-purpose terminals perform specific tasks and contain features uniquely designed for 
use in a particular industry. Three widely used special-purpose terminals are point-of-sale (POS) 
terminals, ATMs, and self-service kiosks.
Point-of-Sale Terminals
The location in a retail or grocery store where a consumer pays for goods or services is the 
point of sale (POS). Most retail stores use a POS terminal to record purchases, process credit or 
debit cards, and update inventory.
In a grocery store, the POS terminal is a 
­combination of an electronic cash register, bar 
code reader, and printer (Figure 3-10). A bar code 
reader is an input device that uses laser beams to 
read bar codes on products. When the checkout 
clerk or customer scans the bar code on the gro-
cery item, the computer uses the manufacturer 
name and item numbers to look up the price 
of the item and the complete product name. 
Then, the price of the item shows on the display 
device, the name of the item and its price print 
on a receipt, and the item being sold is recorded 
so that the inventory can be updated. Thus, the 
output from a POS terminal serves as input to 
other computers to maintain sales records, update 
inventory, verify credit, and perform other activi-
ties associated with the sales transactions that are 
critical to running the business. Some POS ter-
minals are Internet capable, which allows updates 
to inventory at geographically separate locations.
Many POS terminals handle credit card or debit 
card payments. After swiping your card through 
the reader, the POS terminal connects to a system that authenticates the purchase. Once the 
transaction is approved, the terminal prints a receipt for the customer.
ATMs
An ATM (automated teller machine) is a self-service banking terminal that connects to a 
host computer through a network (Figure 3-11). Banks place ATMs in public locations, includ-
ing grocery stores, convenience stores, retail outlets, 
shopping malls, sports and concert venues, and gas sta-
tions, so that customers can access their bank accounts 
­conveniently.
Using an ATM, people withdraw and deposit money, 
transfer funds, or inquire about an account balance. 
Some ATMs have a touch screen; others have special 
buttons or keypads for entering data. To access a bank 
account, you insert a plastic bank card in the ATM’s 
card reader. The ATM asks you to enter a numeric 
password, called a PIN (personal identification number), 
which verifies that you are the holder of the bank card. 
When your transaction is complete, the ATM prints a 
receipt for your records. Read Secure IT 3-2 for ATM 
safety tips.

card and coupons, and then pay for the goods.

ATM Safety
Visiting an ATM to withdraw or deposit 
money is convenient, but it also is ripe with 
potential for criminal activity. Avoid being 
a victim by exercising common sense and 
­following these guidelines.
• Location: Choose an ATM in a well-lit 
public area away from bushes and dividers 
and near the entrance of a building. If 
using a drive-up ATM, keep the engine 
running and doors locked, roll windows 
up while waiting for the ATM to process 
your request, and leave adequate room to 
­maneuver between your vehicle and the 
one in the lane in front of you. Observe 
your surroundings and be suspicious of 
people sitting in vehicles or loitering nearby.
• ATM card and PIN: Handle the ATM card 
like cash by keeping it in a safe location 
and storing it in a protective sleeve. Do not 
write the PIN on the back of the card or 
store it in a text file on your ­smartphone; 
instead, memorize the numbers. (For 
­information about password manager 
apps, read Secure IT 5-3 in Chapter 5.) 
Report a lost or stolen card immediately.
• Transaction: Minimize time by having 
the ATM card ready as you approach the 
machine. Do not allow people to watch 
your activity. Cover the keypad or screen 
with one hand as you enter the PIN, and 
use your body to block as much of the 
area as possible. If the ATM screen appears 
different, behaves unusually, or offers 
options with which you are unfamiliar or 
uncomfortable, cancel the transaction and 
leave the area.
• Be suspicious of skimmers: Thieves can 
capture a credit card number and PIN by 
placing a skimmer on an ATM (shown in 
the figure) or on other self-service stations, 
such as gas pumps, where users swipe 
their credit cards for payment. Sophisti-
cated skimmers are Bluetooth enabled or 
are entire panels placed directly on top of 
the ATM faces and are virtually undetect-
able. Less-technical devices are false card 
readers secured to the card slot with 
double-sided tape and a hidden camera or 
an overlay on the keypad. Many ATMs have 
security stickers informing customers to 
notify attendants if the seal is broken.
• Valuables: Expensive clothes and jewelry 
can be incentives to potential assailants. 
Dress modestly and leave jewels at home.
• Exiting: Do not count cash in public; 
immediately put it in your pocket or fold it 
in your hand. If you receive a receipt, take 
it with you and do not discard it in a trash 
can near the area. As you leave, be certain 
you are not being followed. If you suspect 
someone is tracking you, immediately walk 
to a populated area or business, or drive to 
a police or fire station.
• Statements: Review your balances and 
bank statements frequently. Be certain  
all deposits and withdrawals are listed,  
and look for unusual or unfamiliar  
activity.
  Consider This:  Which of these tips do 
you follow, and how will you change your 
behavior the next time you visit an ATM 
or other self-service stations? Which ATMs 
in your neighborhood appear to be in safe 
­locations?

Self-Service Kiosks
A self-service kiosk is a freestanding terminal that usually has a touch screen for user 
­interaction. Table 3-2 identifies several widely used self-service kiosks. Because users interact 
with self-service kiosks independently, without a salesperson nearby, it is important the kiosk 
is simple and easy to use. In many cases, a web app or mobile app can extend or enhance the 
­capability of the kiosk. For example, you can reserve an item via the app on a computer or 
mobile device and then use the kiosk to finalize the transaction.

Chapter 3  Computers and Mobile Devices
A DVD kiosk, for example, is a self-service DVD 
rental machine that connects to a host computer 
through a network (Figure 3-12). DVD kiosks are 
associated with a particular vendor. To rent a movie 
online, for example, a customer establishes an 
account or connects to an existing account on the 
vendor’s website, selects the desired movie, and then 
chooses a nearby DVD kiosk where the movie will 
be picked up. Customers also usually can select mov-
ies directly at the DVD kiosk via a touch screen or 
some other input device on the kiosk. After present-
ing identifying information and swiping a credit card 
through the reader, the DVD kiosk dispenses the 
rented movie to the customer. The customer returns 
it to any of the vendor’s nationwide DVD kiosks, at 
which time the customer’s account is charged a fee 
based on the time elapsed.
Supercomputers
A supercomputer is the fastest, most powerful computer — and the most expensive (Figure 3-13). 
Supercomputers are capable of processing many trillions of instructions in a single second. With 
weights that exceed 100 tons, these computers can store more than 20,000 times the data and 
information of an average desktop.
Applications requiring complex, sophisticated mathematical calculations use supercomputers. 
For example, large-scale simulations and applications in medicine, aerospace, automotive design, 
online banking, weather forecasting, nuclear energy research, and petroleum exploration use a 
supercomputer.

Cloud Computing
Cloud computing refers to an environment that provides resources and services accessed via 
the Internet (Figure 3-14). Resources include email messages, schedules, music, photos, videos, 
games, websites, programs, web apps, servers, storage, and more. Services include accessing soft-
ware, storing files online, and configuring an environment of servers for optimal performance. 
That is, instead of accessing these resources and services locally, you access them on the cloud. 
For example, you use cloud computing capabilities when you store or access documents, photos, 
videos, and other media online; use programs and apps online (i.e., email, productivity, games, 
etc.); and share ideas, opinions, and content with others online (i.e., online social networks).

Chapter 3  Computers and Mobile Devices
Businesses use cloud computing to more efficiently manage resources, such as servers and 
programs, by shifting usage and consumption of these resources from a local environment to the 
Internet. For example, an employee working during the day in California could use computing 
resources located in an office in Paris that is closed for the evening. When the company uses 
the computing resources, it pays a fee that is based on the amount of computing time and other 
resources it consumes, much in the way that consumers pay utility companies for the amount of 
electricity used.
Cloud computing allows a company to diversify its network and server infrastructure. Some 
cloud computing services automatically add more network and server capacity to a company’s 
website as demand for services of the website increases. The network and server capacity may be 
duplicated around the world so that, for example, an outage of a single server does not affect the 
company’s operations.
Consider This
Are all cloud services available to everyone?
Some cloud services are public and others are private. A public cloud is made available free or for a fee to the 
general public or a large group, usually by a cloud service provider. A private cloud is dedicated to a single 
organization. Some cloud services are hybrid, combining two or more cloud types.

Mobile Devices
A mobile device is a computing device small enough to hold in your hand. Because of their 
reduced size, the screens on mobile devices are small — often between 3 and 5 inches. Popular 
types of mobile devices are smartphones, digital cameras, portable and digital media players, 
e-book readers, and wearable devices. Read Ethics & Issues 3-2 to consider issues related to 
recycling computers and mobile devices.

Should Recycling of Electronics  
Be Made Easier?
As technology advances and prices fall, 
many people think of computers and mobile 
devices as disposable. Worldwide, consum-
ers generate an estimated 20 to 50 mil-
lion tons of e-waste annually. (Recall that 
e-waste consists of discarded computers 
and mobile devices.) E-waste releases lead, 
mercury, barium, and other elements into 
soil and water.
Electronics recycling is known as eCycling. 
Only about 12 percent of e-waste is eCycled. 
Electronics recycling can take several forms: 
reusing parts; creating new products from 
old products; or melting down or reducing 
parts to basic elements or materials.
Many not-for-profit organizations, retail 
websites, mobile service providers, and big 
box retailers offer reselling and eCycling 
options. Several electronics companies 
allow you to trade your device for a gift 
certificate. The Sustainable Materials 
Management (SMM) Electronics Challenge 
promotes eCycling by certifying recycling 
businesses that meet or pass qualification 
guidelines. Other companies focus exclusively 
on eCycling. One business has developed 
automated kiosks that tell you what your 
device is worth, connect you to a buyer, 
take your device, and dispense cash back on 
the spot. The U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA) lists eCycling, reselling, and 
donation resources on its website.
A large amount of e-waste pollutes 
developing countries that may accept the 
materials for profit. A proposed federal bill, 
supported by many electronics manufacturers 
and resellers, makes it illegal for companies 
to export e-waste to developing countries. 
Currently, several states have laws that 
mandate eCycling.
Consider This:   Should the government, 
manufacturers, or users be responsible for 
recycling of obsolete equipment? Why? 
What impact does exporting toxic waste 
have on developing nations? Should the 
state or federal government mandate an 
eCycling program for electronics? Why or 
why not?

Smartphones
A smartphone is an Internet-capable phone that usually also includes a calendar, an address 
book, a calculator, a notepad, games, browser, and numerous other apps. In addition to basic 
phone capabilities, many smartphones include these features:
• Send and receive email messages and access the web — via Wi-Fi or a mobile data plan
• Communicate wirelessly with other devices or computers
• Function as a portable media player
• Include a built-in digital camera
• Talk directly into the smartphone’s microphone or into a Bluetooth headset that wirelessly 
communicates with the phone
• Conduct live video calls, where the parties can see each other as they speak
• Receive GPS signals to determine a user’s current location
• Synchronize data and information with a computer or another mobile device
• Support voice control so that you can speak instructions to the phone and it speaks responses 
back to you
• Connect to external devices wirelessly, such as via BlueTooth
• Serve as a wireless access point
Many smartphones have touch screens. Instead of or in addition to an on-screen keyboard, 
some have a built-in mini keyboard on the front of the phone or a keyboard that slides in and 
out from behind the phone. Others have keypads that contain both numbers and letters. Some 
also include a stylus.
Consider This
How do you type text messages on a phone that has only a numeric keypad and no touch screen?
Each key on the keypad represents multiple characters, which are identified on the key. For example, the 2 key 
on the phone’s keypad displays the letters a, b, and c on the key’s face. On many phones, you cycle through the 
number, letters, and other symbols associated with a particular key by pressing a key on the keypad multiple times. 
To type the word, hi, for instance, you would press the 4 key (labeled with the letters g, h, and i) twice to display 
the letter h, pause momentarily to advance the cursor, and then press the 4 key three times to display the letter i.

Some phones support a swipe keyboard app, on which users enter words by tracing a path on an 
on-screen keyboard with their fingertip or stylus from one letter to the next in a continuous 
motion. With other phones, you press letters on the phone’s keyboard or keypad. Some phones 
use predictive text, where you press one key on the keyboard or keypad for each letter in a word, 
and software on the phone predicts the word you want. Swipe keyboard apps and predictive text 
save users time when entering text on the phone.

Chapter 3  Computers and Mobile Devices
Instead of typing on a phone’s keyboard or keypad, users can enter text via a portable ­keyboard, 
which is a full-sized keyboard that communicates with a smartphone via a dock, cables, or 
wirelessly. Some portable keyboards physically attach to and remove from the device; others 
are wireless. Another option is a virtual keyboard that projects an image of a keyboard on a flat 
­surface. Finally, some phones work with apps that convert your spoken word to text.
Messaging Services  With messaging services, users can send and receive messages to and 
from smartphones, mobile phones, handheld game devices, other mobile devices, and comput-
ers. The type of messages you send depends primarily on the services offered by the mobile 
service provider that works with the phone or other mobile device you select. Many users 
have unlimited wireless messaging plans, while others pay a fee per message sent or received. 
Messaging services include text and picture/video.
With text messaging service, or SMS (short message service), users can send and receive short 
text messages, typically fewer than 300 characters, on a phone or other mobile device or 
computer. Text message services typically provide users with several options for sending and 
­receiving messages, including:
• Mobile to mobile: Send a message from your mobile device to another mobile device.
• Mobile to email: Send a message from your mobile device to any email address.
• Mobile to provider: Send a message by entering a common short code (CSC), which is a  
four- or five-digit number assigned to a specific content or mobile service provider, sometimes 
followed by the message, for example, to a vote for a television program contestant or donate 
to a charity.
• Web to mobile: Send a message from a website to a mobile device or notification from a 
website to a mobile device with messages of breaking news and other updates, such as sports 
scores, stock prices, weather forecasts, incoming email messages, game notifications, and more.
Consider This
What is the difference between push and pull notifications?
A push notification, sometimes called a server push, is a message that initiates from the sending location (such 
as a server) without a request from the receiver. With a pull notification, by contrast, receiver requests information 
from the sending location.  
	
Consider This
Do you need a messaging service to send a text or picture/video message?
Instead of using a messaging plan from your mobile service provider, you can use a mobile messaging app to send 
and receive text, picture, and other message from users. Many messaging apps also provide group chat capabilities. 
Most messaging apps can be downloaded to your mobile device at no cost.
	
With picture messaging service, users can send photos and audio files, as well as short text 
­messages, to a phone or other mobile device or computer. With video messaging services, users can 
send short video clips, usually about 30 seconds in length, in addition to all picture messaging ser-
vices. Smartphones and other mobile devices with picture/video messaging services, also called MMS 
(multimedia message service), typically have a digital camera built into the device. Users who expect to 
receive numerous picture/video messages should verify the phone has sufficient memory. Picture/
video message services typically provide users these options for sending and receiving messages:
• Mobile to mobile: Send the picture/video from your mobile device to another mobile device.
• Mobile to email: Send the picture/video from your mobile device to any email address.
If you send a picture message to a phone that does not have picture/video messaging 
­capability, the phone usually displays a text message directing the user to a webpage that con-
tains the picture/video message. Some online social networks allow you to send a picture/video 
message directly to your online profile.

Voice mail, which functions much like an answering machine, allows someone to leave a voice 
message for one or more people. Unlike answering machines, however, a computer in the voice 
mail system converts an analog voice message into digital form. Once digitized, the message is 
stored in a voice mailbox. A voice mailbox is a storage location on a hard drive in the voice mail 
system. To help users manage voice mail messages, some systems offer visual voice mail. With 
visual voice mail, users can view message details, such as the length of calls and, in some cases, 
read message contents instead of listening to them. Some voice mail systems can convert a voice 
mail message to a text message for display on a computer or mobile device, such as a smart-
phone, which you then can manage like any other text message.
Messaging services and voice mail systems also may be able to send messages to groups of 
phone numbers or email addresses. Read Secure IT 3-3 for tips about safely using smartphones 
and other mobile devices in public.

Safe Mobile Device Use in Public Areas
Sending a text message, updating a 
Facebook status, posting a Tweet, selecting 
a new playlist, and checking email mes-
sages are tasks you may perform using a 
mobile device many times each day. They 
all require some concentration as you focus 
on the device, usually while looking down-
ward, and they distract you from events 
occurring around you. Using technology 
responsibly and safely can prevent theft 
and injuries.
One common method of thwarting a 
smartphone thief is to avoid using the phone 
to check the time. Potential thieves randomly 
ask people for the correct time. If a person 
stops and takes a phone out of a pocket 
or purse, the thief glances at the make and 
model and decides if it is worth snatching.
Bus stops and train stations are common 
places for mobile device theft. People in these 
locations tend to use their smartphones to 
check schedules, send text messages, and 
make phone calls. Headphones and earbuds 
are giveaways that you are using a mobile 
device and may not be focused on your 
surroundings. Recent studies show that 
more than 100 mobile phones are stolen 
every minute in the United States. Thieves 
are likely to snatch the devices while the 
doors are closing just before the train or bus 
departs from a station so that the victim is 
unable to pursue the thief. To decrease the 
chance of theft or pickpocketing, keep your 
mobile device(s) in a front pocket or in a 
zippered backpack. Keep your head up and 
stay aware of your surroundings. If possible, 
when in public, avoid using accessories that 
indicate the type of device to which they are 
connected.
Cognitive psychologists have studied the 
effects of inattentional blindness, which occurs 
when a person’s attention is diverted while 
performing a natural activity, such as walking. 
The researchers have determined that diverted 
attention is particularly pronounced when 
people are talking on a mobile phone and, 
to a lesser extent, using a portable media 
player. Emergency room reports indicate that 
distracted walking accidents are on the rise, 
especially when people trip over cracks in 
sidewalks or run into fixed objects, such as 
parked cars and telephone poles.
  Consider This:  Do you know anyone 
who has had a mobile device stolen? If so, how 
did the theft occur? Have you ever experienced 
inattentional blindness or distracted walking?
Digital Cameras
A digital camera is a mobile device that allows users to take photos and store the 
­photographed images digitally. A smart digital camera also can communicate wirelessly with other 
devices and can include apps similar to those on a smartphone. Mobile computers and devices, 
such as smartphones and tablets, often include at least one integrated digital camera.
BTW
Analog vs. Digital
Human speech is 
analog because it uses 
continuous (wave form) 
signals that vary in 
strength and quality. 
Most computers and 
electronic devices are 
digital, which use only 
two discrete states: on 
and off.
Consider This
Do you need a digital camera if you have a camera built into your mobile phone?
If you use a camera only for posts on social media sites, then you may choose to use your mobile phone’s built-in 
camera. If, however, you want increased zoom capabilities, more powerful flash, image stabilization, manual control 
of settings, and to reduce the drain on your phone’s battery, then you may want to opt for a separate digital camera.

Most point-and-shoot cameras include zoom and autofocus capability, use a built-in flash, 
store images on memory cards, and enable you to view and sometimes edit images directly 
on the camera. Many can take video in addition to still photos. Some are equipped with GPS, 
­giving them the capability to record the exact location where a photo was taken and then 
store these details with the photo. Others are waterproof. Figure 3-17 illustrates how a point-

In addition to cameras built into phones and other devices, types of digital cameras include 
point-and-shoot cameras and SLR cameras (Figure 3-16). A point-and-shoot camera is an afford-
able and lightweight digital camera with lenses built into it and a screen that displays an 
approximation of the image to be photographed. Point-and-shoot cameras, which range in size 
and features, provide acceptable quality photographic images for the home or small office user. 
An SLR camera (single-lens reflex camera), by contrast, is a high-end digital camera that has 
interchangeable lenses and uses a mirror to display on its screen an exact replica of the image 
to be photographed. SLR cameras are much heavier and larger than point-and-shoot cameras. 
They also can be quite expensive, with a variety of available lens sizes and other attachments.

Smart digital cameras include all the features of point-and-shoot cameras and also enable you 
to connect wirelessly via Wi-Fi. Using the wireless capability, you instantly can save captured 
photos or videos on a networked computer or the cloud, share them on your online social net-
work, upload them to a video sharing site, send them via email, and more. With a smart digital 
camera, you typically can download apps (just like on a smartphone) from an app store.
Digital cameras store captured images on storage media in the camera or on some type of 
memory card. Although most cameras enable you to review, edit, print, and share photos directly 
from the camera, some users prefer to transfer photos from a digital camera or the memory card 
to a computer’s hard drive to perform these tasks.
Photo Quality  Resolution affects the ­quality of digital c­amera 
­photos. Resolution is the number of horizontal and vertical pixels in 
a display. A pixel (short for picture ­element) is the smallest element 
in an electronic image (Figure 3-18). Digital camera resolution typi-
cally is stated in megapixels (MP), or millions of pixels. For example, a 
16 MP resolution means 16 million pixels. The greater the number 
of pixels the camera uses to capture a picture, the better the quality 
of the picture but the larger the file size and the more expensive the 
camera. Most digital cameras provide a means to adjust the resolu-
tion. At a lower resolution, you can capture and store more images in 
the camera.
The actual photographed resolution is known as the optical 
­resolution. Some manufacturers state enhanced resolution, instead 
of, or in addition to, optical resolution. The enhanced resolution 
usually is higher because it uses a special formula to add pixels 
between those generated by the optical resolution. Be aware that 
some manufacturers compute a digital camera’s megapixels from 
the enhanced resolution, instead of optical resolution.

Portable and Digital Media Players
A portable media player is a mobile device on which you can store, organize, and play or 
view digital media (Figure 3-19). Smartphones and other mobile devices often can function as a 
portable media player. Portable media players enable you to listen to music; view photos; watch 
videos, movies, and television shows; and even record audio and video. Some include a digital 
camera and also offer a calendar, address book, games, and other apps. Others communicate 
wirelessly with other devices or computers and enable you to synchronize your digital media 
with a computer, another mobile device, or cloud storage.

Chapter 3  Computers and Mobile Devices
Portable media players usually require a set of earbuds, which are small speakers that rest 
inside each ear canal. Available in a variety of sizes and colors, some portable media player mod-
els have a touch screen. Others have a touch-sensitive pad, which is an input device that contains 
buttons and/or wheels you operate with a thumb or finger. Using the touch-sensitive pad, you 
can scroll through and play music; view pictures; watch videos or movies; navigate through song, 
picture, or movie lists; display a menu; adjust volume; customize settings; and perform other 
actions. Some portable media players have only button controls.
Portable media players are a mobile type of digital 
media player. A digital media player or streaming 
media player is a device, typically used in a home, that 
streams digital media from a computer or network to 
a television, projector, or some other entertainment 
device (Figure 3-20). Some can stream from the 
Internet, enabling users to access video on websites. 
Some users opt for a digital media player instead of 
subscribing to cable or satellite subscription services 
to watch television programs.
Your collection of stored digital media is called a 
media library. Portable media players and some digital 
media players house your media library on a storage 
device in the player and/or on some type of memory 
card. With most, you transfer the digital media from 
a computer or the Internet, if the device is Internet 
capable, to the player’s media library. Read How To 2-3 
in Chapter 2 for instructions about how to download 
digital media from online services.

E-Book Readers
An e-book reader (short for electronic book reader), or e-reader, is a mobile device that is 
used primarily for reading e-books and other digital publications (Figure 3-21). An e-book, or 
digital book, is an electronic version of a printed book, read-
able on computers and other mobile devices. Digital publi-
cations include books, newspapers, and magazines. Mobile 
computers and devices that display text also can function as 
e-book readers.
E-book readers usually are smaller than tablets but larger 
than smartphones. Most e-book reader models can store thou-
sands of books, have a touch screen, and are Internet capable 
with built-in wireless technology. You use an on-screen key-
board to navigate, search, make selections, take notes, and 
highlight. Some have a text-to-speech feature, where the device 
speaks the contents of the printed page. E-book readers are 
available with an electronic paper black-and-white screen or 
with a color screen. Most have settings to adjust text size and 
Digital Camera Purchase Guidelines
1.	 Determine the type of digital camera that meets 
your needs, such as a point-and-shoot camera or 
SLR camera.
2.	 Choose a camera with an appropriate resolution.
3.	 Evaluate memory cards, because different cameras 
require different memory cards.iStockphoto / tomprout
4.	 Consider a camera with built-in photo editing features.
5.	 Make sure that you can see the screen easily.
6.	 If the photos you plan to take will require you to 
zoom, choose a camera with an appropriate optical 
zoom.
7.	 Purchase accessories such as extra batteries and 
battery chargers, extra memory cards, lenses, and 
carrying cases.
Portable or Digital Media Player Purchase 
Guidelines
1.	 Choose a device with sufficient storage capacity for 
your media library and apps.
2.	 Consider how the portable or digital media 
player will connect to the Internet. Some devices 
­connect using a wired and/or wireless connection. 
Choose a player that is compatible with the type 
of ­connection you can provide.
3.	 Read reviews about sound quality. If you are 
­purchasing a portable device, consider higher-quality 
earbuds, headphones, or external speakers.
4.	 Select a player that is compatible with other devices 
you already own.
5.	 Consider additional memory cards to increase the 
­storage capacity of your portable or digital media 
player.
6.	 Consider the accessories. If your portable or digital 
media player connects to a television or other dis-
play, consider purchasing a keyboard so that you 
can type easily. If the device is portable, consider 
additional batteries or a protective case.

for various lighting conditions, such as bright sunlight or dim lighting. Batteries usually have a 
long life, providing more than 75 hours of use before needing to be recharged.
Similar to how a portable media player stores digital media, e-book readers store digital 
­publications in a library on a storage device in the e-book reader and/or on memory cards. You 
typically transfer the digital publication from a computer or the Internet, if the device is Internet 
capable, to the e-book reader. Read How To 2-3 in Chapter 2 for instructions about how to 
download digital media from online services.

Electronic Paper Screen
Some users of e-books 
prefer the electronic 
paper black-and-white 
screen over the models 
with color screens 
because the electronic 
paper resembles a paper 
page from a book.
Consider This
Do you need a separate e-book reader if you have a tablet or other device that can function as an 
e-book reader?
If you want the flexibility of reading on one device while using a tablet or other device for separate tasks, you will 
want to purchase a separate e-book reader. Also, e-book readers have a design suited for optimal readability of 
on-screen text and a longer battery life.
	
Wearable Devices
A wearable device or wearable is a small, mobile computing device designed to be worn by a 
consumer (Figure 3-22). These devices often communicate with a mobile device or computer 
using Bluetooth. Three popular types of wearable devices are activity trackers, smartwatches, and 
smartglasses.
An activity tracker is a wearable device 
that monitors fitness-related activities such 
as distance walked, heart rate, pulse, calo-
ries consumed, and sleep patterns. These 
devices typically sync, usually wirelessly, 
with a web or mobile app on your com-
puter or mobile device to extend the capa-
bility of the wearable device.
A smartwatch is a wearable device that, 
in addition to keeping time, can com-
municate wirelessly with a smartphone to 
make and answer phone calls, read and 
send messages, access the web, play music, 
work with apps such as fitness trackers 
and GPS, and more. Most include a touch 
screen.
 Smartglasses, also called smart eyewear, 
are wearable head-mounted eyeglass-
type devices that enable the user to view 
information or take photos and videos 
that are projected to a miniature screen 
in the user’s field of vision. For example, 
the device wearer could run an app while 
wearing smartglasses that display flight 
status information when he or she walks 
into an airport. Users control the device 
through voice commands or by touching controls on its frame. Some smartglasses also 
include mobile apps, such as fitness trackers and GPS.

Game Devices
A game console is a mobile computing device designed for single-player or multiplayer 
video games. Gamers often connect the game console to a television or a monitor so that 
they can view gameplay on the screen. Some models also allow you to listen to music and 
watch movies or view photos. Typically weighing between 3 and 11 pounds, many game  
console models include storage for games and other media. Optical disc drives in the game 
consoles provide access to games and movies on optical disc. Some use memory cards and 
accept USB flash drives. Game consoles that are Internet capable enable gamers to  
download games, stream games or movies, and play with others online. Some gamers connect 
keyboards or webcams so that they more easily can send text messages or conduct video 
chats with other gamers.
A handheld game device is a small mobile device that contains a screen, speakers, controls, 
and game console all in one unit. Some include a stylus. Some handheld game device models 
have touch screens and built-
in digital cameras. Some are 
Internet capable for down-
loading games and apps. Most 
handheld game devices can com-
municate wirelessly with other 
similar devices for multiplayer 
gaming.
With a game console or 
computer video game, players 
direct movements and actions of 
on-screen objects via a control-
ler, voice, or air gestures. Game 
controllers include gamepads, 
joysticks and wheels, dance pads, 
and a variety of motion-sensing 
controllers (Figure 3-23). The 
following list describes each of 
these types of game controllers. 
Most communicate via wired or 
wireless technology.
• A gamepad, which is held 
with both hands, controls 
the movement and actions of players or objects in video games or computer games. On 
the gamepad, users press buttons with their thumbs or move sticks in various directions to 
trigger events. Several gamepads can communicate with the game console simultaneously for 
multiplayer gaming.
• Users running flight and driving simulation software often use a joystick or wheel. A joystick is 
a handheld vertical lever, mounted on a base, that you move in different directions to control 
the actions of the simulated vehicle or player. The lever usually includes buttons, called 
triggers, that you press to initiate certain events. A wheel is a steering-wheel-type input device 
that users turn to simulate driving a car, truck, or other vehicle. Most wheels also include foot 
pedals for acceleration and braking actions.
• A dance pad is a flat, electronic device divided into panels that users press with their feet in 
response to instructions from a music video game. These games test the user’s ability to step 
on the correct panel at the correct time, following a pattern that is synchronized with the 
rhythm or beat of a song.

Chapter 3  Computers and Mobile Devices
•  Motion-sensing game controllers allow users to guide on-screen elements with air gestures, that 
is, by moving their body or a handheld input device through the air. Some motion-sensing 
game controllers are sold with a particular type of game; others are general purpose. Sports 
games, for example, use motion-sensing game controllers, such as baseball bats and golf clubs. 
With general-purpose motion-sensing game controllers, you simulate batting, golfing, and 
other actions with a universal handheld device or no device at all.
• Other controllers include those used for music and fitness games. Controllers that resemble 
musical instruments, such as guitars, drums, keyboards, and microphones work with music 
video games that enable game players to create sounds and music by playing the instrument. 
Fitness games often communicate with a balance board, which is shaped like a weight scale and 
contains sensors that measure a game player’s balance and weight. Read Ethics & Issues 3-3 to 
consider whether games and apps are qualified to provide medical advice.

Are Fitness Video Games and Apps 
Qualified to Provide Medical Advice?
Most video games and smartphone apps 
provide a workout only for your fingers. A host 
of games and apps, however, attempt to track 
calories, suggest workout routines, and more. 
Because you can take your smartphone any-
where, one advantage is that apps can provide 
tips for eating healthfully at a restaurant, act 
as a pedometer to track your steps, and send 
reminders to exercise. Wearable fitness devices 
can track your steps or use GPS to trace your 
route when running or biking. Another advan-
tage is you can receive instant feedback and 
support from fitness apps and games that 
allow you to post workouts, calorie counts, and 
even weight loss to online social networks. 
Some apps even reward you for working out.
Some critics find fault with these apps, 
claiming that medical personnel have not 
evaluated either the game or app developers, 
or the games and apps themselves. Because 
they do not take into account the amount 
of lean muscle mass and body fat, health 
and weight loss goals can be miscalculated. 
Experts say that games that simulate sports, 
such as tennis, burn half the calories you 
would burn if you participated in the actual 
sport. Some medical professionals also note 
that apps do not consider a participant’s 
medical history when recommending activities. 
Proponents of fitness-related games and apps 
say that the games encourage people to be 
more active and can provide positive feedback, 
especially the elderly and children who might 
otherwise not get much physical activity.
Consider This:   Should game and app 
developers provide medical advice? Why or 
why not? Can fitness-related games provide 
a quality workout? Can an app give accu-
rate calorie recommendations? Why or why 
not? As long as the games make people 
more active, should you ignore a games’ 
shortcomings? Why or why not?
Embedded Computers
An embedded computer is a special-purpose computer that functions as a component in a 
larger product. Embedded computers are everywhere — at home, in your car, and at work. The 
following list identifies a variety of everyday products that contain embedded computers.
• Consumer electronics: Mobile phones, digital phones, digital televisions, cameras, video 
recorders, DVD players and recorders, answering machines
• Home automation devices: Thermostats, sprinkling systems, security systems, vacuum 
systems, appliances, lights
• Automobiles: Antilock brakes, engine control modules, electronic stability control, airbag 
control unit, cruise control, navigation systems and GPS receivers
• Process controllers and robotics: Remote monitoring systems, power monitors, machine 
controllers, medical devices
• Computer devices and office machines: Keyboards, printers, fax and copy machines
Because embedded computers are components in larger products, they usually are small and have 
limited hardware. These computers perform various functions, depending on the requirements 
of the product in which they reside. Embedded computers in printers, for example, monitor the 
amount of paper in the tray, check the ink or toner level, signal if a paper jam has occurred, and so 
on. Figure 3-24 shows some of the many embedded computers in vehicles. Read Ethics & Issues 3-4 
to consider whether in-vehicle technology fosters a false sense of security.

Does In-Vehicle Technology Foster 
a False Sense of Security?
Embedded computers in vehicles can guide 
you when backing out of a driveway, warn 
you if a vehicle or object is in your blind 
spot, or alert you to unsafe road conditions. 
Apps can track gas mileage or notify you 
when your car needs an oil change or other 
services. Recently, all new cars were required 
to include electronic stability control, which 
can assist with steering the car in case of 
skidding, and backup cameras. Other tech-
nologies adjust vehicle speed or headlight 
usage, and can even activate the brakes. 
All of this technology is intended to make 
­driving safer.
Critics of in-vehicle technology claim that 
it can provide drivers with a false sense of 
security. If you rely on a sensor for assistance 
while backing up, parking, or changing lanes, 
for example, you may miss other obstructions 
that could cause a crash. Reliance on electronic 
stability control or other crash-avoidance 
technologies may cause you to drive faster than 
conditions allow or to pay less attention to the 
distance between your vehicle and others.
The effect on new, teen drivers is especially 
of concern. If teens learn to drive using vehicles 
equipped with features such as video rearview 
mirrors, they may be unable to drive older, less-
equipped vehicles safely. Many apps and devices 
help parents protect their teens while driving. 
Apps can program mobile devices to block 
incoming calls or text messages while the vehicle 
is moving. GPS can track a vehicle’s location and 
speed. Sensors can monitor seatbelt usage and 
number of passengers in the vehicle.
Consider This:   Does in-vehicle technology  
make driving safer? Why or why not? 
What basic skills should all drivers have, 
regardless of their vehicle’s technology?
Smartphone apps, such as the OnStar RemoteLink 
app shown here, remotely start the engine, unlock 
doors, stream music through the vehicle’s sound 
system, display driving directions, and more.
Adaptive cruise control systems detect if 
vehicles in front of you are too close and, 
if necessary, adjust the vehicle’s throttle, 
may apply brakes, and/or sound an alarm.
Tire pressure monitoring systems 
send warning signals if tire pressure 
is insufﬁcient.
Drive-by-wire systems sense pressure on the gas 
pedal and communicate electronically to the 
engine how much and how fast to accelerate.
Advanced airbag systems have 
crash-severity sensors that determine 
the appropriate level to inﬂate the 
airbag, reducing the chance of airbag 
injury in low-speed accidents.
Cars equipped with wireless communications 
capabilities, called telematics, include features 
such as navigation systems, remote diagnosis
and alerts, and Internet access.
 Electronic stability control 
automatically applies brakes, and 
may reduce engine power, when you 
lose control of steering or traction.

Consider This
Can embedded computers use the Internet to communicate with other computers and devices?
Many already do, on a small scale. For example, a Smart TV enables you to browse the web, stream video from 
online media services, listen to Internet radio, communicate with others on social media sites, play online games, 
and more — all while watching a television show.
A trend, called the Internet of Things, describes an environment where processors are embedded in every 
product imaginable (things), and those ‘things’ communicate with one another via the Internet (i.e., alarm 
clocks, coffeemakers, apps, vehicles, refrigerators, phones, washing machines, doorbells, streetlights, thermostats, 
navigation systems, etc.). For example, when your refrigerator detects the milk is low, it sends your phone a text 
message that you need milk and adds a ‘buy milk’ task to your scheduling app. On the drive home, your phone 
determines the closest grocery store that has the lowest milk price and sends the address of that grocery store to 
your vehicle’s navigation system, which, in turn, gives you directions to the store. In the store, your phone directs 
you to the dairy aisle, where it receives an electronic coupon from the store for the milk. Because this type of 
environment provides an efficient means to track or monitor status, inventory, behavior, and more — without 
human intervention — it sometimes is referred to as machine-to-machine (M2M) communications. For additional 
information about the Internet of Things, read Mini Feature 6-1 in Chapter 6.

Chapter 3  Computers and Mobile Devices
Putting It All Together
Industry experts typically classify computers and mobile devices in six categories: personal 
­computers (desktop), mobile computers and mobile devices, game consoles, servers, supercom-
puters, and embedded computers. A computer’s size, speed, processing power, and price  
determine the category it best fits. Due to rapidly changing technology, however, the distinction  
among categories is not always clear-cut. Table 3-3 summarizes the categories of computers 
­discussed on the previous pages.

Ports and Connections
Computers and mobile devices connect to peripheral devices through ports or by using ­wireless 
technologies. A port is the point at which a peripheral device (i.e., keyboard, printer, monitor,  
etc.) attaches to or communicates with a computer or mobile device so that the peripheral device 
can send data to or receive information from the computer or mobile device. Most computers

and mobile devices have ports (Figure 3-25). 
Some ports have a micro or mini version for 
mobile devices because of the smaller sizes of 
these devices.
A connector joins a cable to a port. A 
­connector at one end of a cable attaches to a 
port on the computer or mobile device, and 
a connector at the other end of the cable 
attaches to a port on the peripheral device. 
Table 3-4 shows a variety of ports you may 
find on a computer or mobile device. USB 
and Thunderbolt are more general-purpose 
ports that allow connections to a wide variety 
of devices; other ports are more specific and

Chapter 3  Computers and Mobile Devices
USB Ports
A USB port, short for universal serial bus port, can connect up to 127 different peripheral 
devices together with a single connector. Devices that connect to a USB port include the fol-
lowing: card reader, digital camera, external hard drive, game console, joystick, modem, mouse, 
optical disc drive, portable media player, printer, scanner, smartphone, digital camera, speakers, 
USB flash drive, and webcam. In addition to computers and mobile devices, you find USB ports 
in vehicles, airplane seats, and other public locations.
Several USB versions have been released, with newer versions (i.e., USB 3.0) transferring data 
and information faster than earlier ones (i.e., USB 2.0). Newer versions are backward compatible, 
which means they support older USB devices as well as newer ones. Keep in mind, though, that 
older USB devices do not run any faster in a newer USB port. In addition to transferring data, 
cables plugged into USB ports also may be able to transfer power to recharge many smart-
phones and tablets. Newer versions of USB can charge connected mobile devices even when the 
computer is not in use.
To attach multiple peripheral devices using a single USB port, you can use a USB hub. A USB 
hub is a device that plugs in a USB port on the computer or mobile device and contains multiple 
USB ports, into which you plug cables from USB devices. Some USB hubs are wireless. That 
is, a receiver plugs into a USB port on the computer and the USB hub communicates wirelessly 
with the receiver. Read Secure IT 3-4 for tips when using USB charging stations.
Secure IT 3-4
Public USB Charging Stations — Safe 
or Not?
Although you might be tempted to recharge 
your smartphone or mobile device at a public 
charging station, think twice before plugging 
your USB cable into the charging kiosk’s port. 
The station may be juice jacking, which occurs 
when a hacker steals data from or transfers 
malware to the device via a USB cable at a 
charging station. (A hacker is someone who 
accesses a computer or network illegally.)
This process is possible because the USB 
cable is used for two purposes: supplying 
power and syncing data. It can occur within 
one minute after plugging into the charger. 
Anything on the device is susceptible, including 
photos, contacts, and music, and some malware 
can create a full backup of your data, leaving 
you prone to identity theft. Once the phone 
or mobile device is infected, it can continue to 
transmit data via Wi-Fi. Security experts claim 
that the only method of erasing this malware is 
to restore the device to its factory settings.
Charging stations are common in airports, 
business centers, and conference rooms. While 
most are safe, you can reduce the possibility 
of juice jacking by taking these precautions:
• Use a travel charger, also called a power 
bank, which can recharge a device several 
times before needing recharging itself.
• Keep the phone or mobile device locked 
so that it requires a password to sync data 
with another device. Turning off the device 
while charging may not provide sufficient 
protection against accessing the storage 
media.
• Use a power-only USB cable that does not 
allow data transmission.
  Consider This: Should warning signs 
be posted by public charging stations? 
Would you use a public charging kiosk if your 
­smartphone or mobile device was running 
low on battery power?

Port Replicators and Docking Stations
Instead of connecting peripheral devices directly to ports on a mobile computer, some mobile 
users prefer the flexibility of port replicators and docking stations. A port replicator is an external 
device that provides connections to peripheral devices through ports built into the device. The 
mobile user accesses peripheral devices by connecting the port replicator to a USB port or a 
special port on the mobile computer. Port replicators sometimes disable ports on the mobile 
computer to prevent conflicts among the devices on the computer and port replicator.
A docking station is similar to a port replicator, but it has more functionality. A docking ­station, 
which is an external device that attaches to a mobile computer or device, contains a power 
­connection and provides connections to peripheral devices (Figure 3-26). Docking stations also

may include slots for memory cards, 
optical disc drives, and other devices. 
With the mobile computer or device 
in the docking station, users can work 
with a full-sized keyboard, a mouse, and 
other desktop peripheral devices from 
their laptop or tablet.
Wireless Device Connections
Instead of connecting ­computers 
and mobile devices to peripheral 
devices with a cable, some peripheral 
devices use wireless communications 
­technologies, such as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, 
and NFC.
Bluetooth  Bluetooth technology 
uses short-range radio signals to 
transmit data between two Bluetooth-
enabled computers or devices. In 
addition to computers, mobile devices 
and many peripheral devices, such as a mouse, keyboard, printer, or headset, and many vehi-
cles and consumer electronics are Bluetooth enabled. Bluetooth devices have to be within 
about 33 feet of each other, but the range can be extended with additional equipment. If you 
have a computer that is not Bluetooth enabled, you can purchase a Bluetooth wireless port 
adapter that will convert an existing USB port into a Bluetooth port. Read How To 3-1 for 
­instructions about setting up two Bluetooth devices to communicate with each other.

Pair Bluetooth Devices
Before two Bluetooth devices will 
­communicate with each other, they might 
need to be paired. Pairing is the process of 
initiating contact between two Bluetooth 
devices and allowing them to communicate 
with each other. It is important to have the 
documentation for the Bluetooth devices you 
are pairing readily available. The following 
steps will help you pair two Bluetooth devices.
1.	 Make sure the devices you intend to pair 
are charged completely or plugged into an 
external power source.
2.	 Turn on the devices to pair, ensuring they 
are within your immediate reach.
3.	 If necessary, enable Bluetooth on the 
devices you are pairing.
4.	 Place one device in discoverable mode, 
which means it is waiting for another 
Bluetooth device to locate its signal. 
If you are connecting a smartphone 
to a Bluetooth headset, for example, 
the smartphone would need to be in 
­discoverable mode.
5.	 Refer to the other device’s documentation 
and follow the necessary steps to locate 
the discoverable device from the other 
device you are pairing.
6.	 After no more than about 30 seconds, the 
devices should initiate communications.
7.	 You may be required to enter a passkey 
(similar to a PIN) on one device for the 
other device with which you are pairing. 
For example, if you are pairing a smart-
phone with a Bluetooth headset, you 
may be required to enter the Bluetooth 
headset’s passkey on the smartphone. In 
this case, you would refer to the Bluetooth 
headset’s documentation to obtain the 
passkey. Common passkeys are 0000 and 
1234.
8.	 After entering the correct passkey, the two 
devices should be paired successfully.
  Consider This: Why is a passkey 
required when pairing two Bluetooth devices? 
Do you need to pair Bluetooth devices before 
each use?

Wi-Fi  Short for wireless fidelity, Wi-Fi uses radio signals that conform to 802.11 standards, 
which were developed by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). 
Computers and devices that have the appropriate Wi-Fi capability can communicate via 
radio waves with other Wi-Fi computers or devices. Most mobile computers and devices are 
Wi-Fi enabled, along with routers and other communications devices. For successful Wi-Fi 
communications in open or outdoor areas free from interference, the Wi-Fi computers or 
devices should be within 300 feet of each other. In closed areas, the wireless range is about 
100 feet. To obtain communications at the maximum distances, you may need to install extra 
hardware. Read How To 3-2 for instructions about connecting a phone to a Wi-Fi network.
Connect Your Phone to a Wi-Fi Network 
to Save Data Charges
Many of today’s data plans limit the 
amount of data you can transfer each 
month on your mobile service provider’s 
network. Connecting a smartphone to a 
Wi-Fi network enables you to transfer 
data without using your phone’s data plan 
and risking costly overages. The following 
steps describe how to connect your phone 
to a Wi-Fi network.
1.	 Make sure you are in a location where 
a Wi-Fi network is available. Obtain 
any necessary information you need to 
­connect to the Wi-Fi network.
2.	 Navigate to the settings on your phone.
3.	 Locate and enable Wi-Fi in your phone’s 
settings.
4.	 When your phone displays a list of available 
wireless networks, choose the network to 
which you want to connect.
5.	 If necessary, enter any additional information, 
such as a password, required to connect to 
the network.
6.	 Your phone should indicate when it 
­successfully is connected to the network.
7.	 When you are finished using the Wi-Fi 
connection or are not within range of 
the Wi-Fi network, disable Wi-Fi on your 
phone to help conserve battery life.
  Consider This: If you have a data plan 
allowing unlimited data and you are within 
range of a Wi-Fi network, is it better to use 
your mobile service provider’s network or the 
Wi-Fi network? Why?

NFC  NFC (near field communications) uses close-range radio signals to transmit data 
between two NFC-enabled devices. Examples of NFC-enabled devices include smartphones, 
digital cameras, computers, televisions, and terminals. Other objects, such as credit cards and

Protecting Hardware
Users rely on computers and mobile devices to create, store, and manage important information. 
Thus, you should take measures to protect computers and devices from theft, vandalism, and 
failure.
Hardware Theft and Vandalism
Companies, schools, and other organizations that house many computers are at risk of ­hardware 
theft and vandalism, especially those with smaller computers that easily can fit in a backpack or 
briefcase. Mobile users are susceptible to hardware theft because the size and weight of their com-
puters and devices make them easy to steal. Thieves may target laptops of company executives so 
that they can use the stolen computer to access confidential company information illegally.
To help reduce the chances of theft, companies and schools use a variety of security measures. 
Physical access controls, such as locked doors and windows, usually are adequate to protect the 
equipment. Many businesses, schools, and some homeowners install alarm systems for addi-
tional security. School computer labs and other facilities with a large number of semifrequent 
users often attach additional physical security devices, such as cables that lock the equipment 
to a desk, cabinet, or floor. Mobile users sometimes lock their mobile computers temporarily 
to a ­stationary object, for example, a table in a hotel room. Small locking devices also exist that 
require a key to access a hard drive or optical disc drive.
Users also can install a security or device-tracking app on their mobile computers and devices. 
Some security apps shut down the computer and sound an alarm if the computer moves beyond 
a specified distance. Others can be configured to 
photograph the thieves when they use the com-
puter. Device-tracking apps use GPS, Wi-Fi, IP 
addresses, and other means to determine the loca-
tion of a lost or stolen computer or device.
Users can configure computers and mobile 
devices to require identification before allowing 
access. For example, you can require entry of a 
user name and password to use the computer or 
device. Some computers and mobile devices have 
built-in or attached fingerprint readers (Figure 
3-27), which can be used to verify a user’s identity 
before allowing access. A fingerprint reader cap-
tures curves and indentations of a fingerprint. This 
type of security does not prevent theft, but it ren-
ders the computer or device useless if it is stolen.
Discover More: Visit this ­chapter’s 
free resources to learn more about 
­device-­tracking apps.
Hardware Failure
Hardware can fail for a variety of reasons: aging hardware; random events, such as electrical 
power problems; and even errors in programs or apps. Not only could hardware failure require 
you to replace or repair a computer or mobile device, but it also can cause loss of software, data, 
and information.
One of the more common causes of system failure is an electrical power variation, which can 
cause loss of data and loss of equipment. If computers and mobile devices are connected to a 
network, a single power disturbance can damage multiple devices at once. Electrical disturbances 
that can cause damage include undervoltages and overvoltages.

Chapter 3  Computers and Mobile Devices
•  An undervoltage occurs when the electrical supply or voltage drops, often defined as 
more than five percent, below the normal volts. A brownout is a prolonged (more than a 
minute) undervoltage. A blackout is a complete power failure. Undervoltages can cause data 
loss but generally do not cause equipment damage.
•  An overvoltage, or power surge, occurs when the incoming electrical supply or voltage 
increases, often defined as more than five percent, above the normal volts. A momentary 
overvoltage, called a spike, occurs when the increase in power lasts for less than one 
millisecond (thousandth of a second). Uncontrollable disturbances such as lightning bolts  
can cause spikes. Overvoltages can cause immediate and permanent damage to hardware.
To protect against electrical power ­variations, use a surge protector. A surge protector, also 
called a surge suppressor, uses electrical components to provide a stable current flow and mini-
mize the chances of an overvoltage reaching the computer and other electronic equipment 
(Figure 3-28). Sometimes resembling a power strip, the computer and other devices plug in the 
surge protector, which plugs in the power source.
Figure 3-28  Circuits inside a surge protector safeguard against  
electrical power variations.

The surge protector absorbs small overvoltages — generally without damage to the computer 
and equipment. To protect the computer and other equipment from large overvoltages, such 
as those caused by a lightning strike, some surge protectors stop working completely when an 
overvoltage reaches a certain level. Surge protectors also usually protect the computer from 
undervoltages. No surge protectors are 100 percent effective. Large power surges can bypass the 
protector. Repeated small overvoltages can weaken a surge protector permanently. Some experts 
recommend replacing a surge protector every two to three years.

Evaluate Surge Protectors and UPSs
Electrical power surges are a part of everyday 
life, and they are especially prevalent during 
thunderstorms and peak energy consump-
tion periods. These unavoidable occurrences 
can damage or ruin sensitive electronic 
equipment. The processor in a computer is 
particularly sensitive to fluctuations in cur-
rent. Two devices can help protect electronic 
components: a surge protector and an 
­uninterruptible power supply (UPS).
Purchase the best surge protector you can 
afford. Typically, the amount of protection 
offered by a surge protector is proportional 
to its cost. That is, the more expensive the 
surge protector, the more protection it 
offers. When evaluating surge protectors 
and UPSs, they should meet or exceed these 
specifications:
• Sufficient outlets to accommodate each 
device needing protection
• Individual on/off switch for each device
• Built-in fuse
• UL 1449 rating that ensures quality 
­control and testing
• Joule rating of at least 600
• Indicator light showing the device is 
­functioning properly
• Warranty for damages to any connected 
equipment
• Low clamping voltage
• High energy-absorption rating
• Low response time, preferably less than 
ten nanoseconds
• Protection for a modem, communications 
lines, and cables
  Consider This:  What other factors 
might you consider while evaluating surge 
protectors? Why?
How To 3-3
Consider This
What other measures can organizations implement if their computers must remain operational at 
all times?
Some companies use duplicate components or duplicate computers to protect against hardware failure.  
A fault-tolerant computer has duplicate components so that it can continue to operate when one of its main 
­components fail. Airline reservation systems, communications networks, ATMs, and other systems that must be 
operational at all times use duplicate components, duplicate computers, or fault-tolerant computers.
	
Figure 3-29  If power fails, a UPS uses batteries to provide electricity for a limited

For additional electrical protection, some users connect an uninterruptible power supply 
to the computer. An uninterruptible power supply (UPS ) is a device that contains surge 
­protection circuits and one or more batteries that can provide power during a temporary or 
­permanent loss of power (Figure 3-29). A UPS connects your computer and a power source.

Health Concerns of Using Technology
The widespread use of technology has led to some important user health concerns. You should 
be proactive and minimize your chance of risk.
Repetitive Strain Injuries
A repetitive strain injury (RSI) is an injury or disorder of the muscles, nerves, tendons, 
­ligaments, and joints. Technology-related RSIs include tendonitis and carpal tunnel  
syndrome.
• Tendonitis is inflammation of a tendon due to repeated motion or stress on that tendon.
• Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is inflammation of the nerve that connects the forearm to the 
palm of the hand.
Repeated or forceful bending of the wrist can cause tendonitis of the wrist or CTS. 
Symptoms of tendonitis of the wrist include extreme pain that extends from the forearm 
to the hand, along with tingling in the fingers. Symptoms of CTS include burning pain 
when the nerve is compressed, along with numbness and tingling in the thumb and first 
two ­fingers.
Long-term computer work can lead to tendonitis or CTS. Factors that cause these disorders 
include prolonged typing, prolonged mouse usage, or continual shifting between the mouse and 
the keyboard. If untreated, these disorders can lead to permanent physical damage.
Consider This
Hand Exercises
• Spread fingers apart for several seconds while
 keeping wrists straight.
• Gently push back fingers and then thumb.
• Dangle arms loosely at sides and then shake
 arms and hands.

What can you do to prevent technology-related 
tendonitis or CTS?
Follow these precautions:
• Take frequent breaks to exercise your hands and arms 
(Figure 3-30).
• Do not rest your wrists on the edge of a desk. 
Instead, place a wrist rest between the keyboard and 
the edge of your desk.
• Place the mouse at least six inches from the edge 
of the desk. In this position, your wrist is flat on 
the desk.
• Minimize the number of times you switch between 
the mouse and the keyboard.

Evaluate Earbuds and Headphones
Earbuds and headphones are used to listen 
to music and other audio files on com-
puters and mobile devices. Selecting the 
proper product not only depends on the 
style you prefer, but also the type of audio 
you will be playing. Prices for earbuds and 
headphones can range from only a few 
dollars to several hundred dollars, so it is 
important to know what you are purchas-
ing. The following guidelines describe what 
to look for when evaluating earbuds and 
headphones.
• Determine which style you prefer. Earbuds 
rest inside your ear, while headphones rest 
over your ear. Experiment with both types 
and determine which is more comfortable 
for you.
• Determine the quality you desire. If you 
­listen to music casually and typically do 
not notice variations in sound qual-
ity, a higher-end product might not be 
necessary. Alternatively, if sound quality 
is important, you may consider a more 
expensive set. Note that a higher price 
does not always indicate better quality; 
read online product reviews for informa-
tion about the sound quality of various 
products.
• Decide whether you would like a noise 
cancelling feature. Noise cancelling 
helps block external noise while you are 
listening to the audio on your device. Noise 
cancelling headphones sometimes require 
batteries, and you are able to turn the noise 
cancelling feature on and off. If you will be 
listening to audio in locations where you 
also need to hear what is going on around 
you, consider purchasing a product without 
this feature.
  Consider This:  Based on your 
­preferences and needs, which type of prod-
uct (earbuds or headphones) is best for you? 
Locate a product online that meets your 
specifications. What brand is it? How  
much does it cost? Where is this product 
available?
How To 3-4
Other Physical Risks
With the growing use of earbuds and 
­headphones in computers and mobile 
devices, some users are experiencing hear-
ing loss. Read How To 3-4 for guidelines for 
­evaluating ­earbuds and headphones.
Computer vision syndrome (CVS) 
is a technology-related health condition 
that affects eyesight. You may have CVS 
if you have sore, tired, burning, ­itching, 
or dry eyes; blurred or double vision after 
­prolonged staring at a display device; 
­headache or sore neck; difficulty shifting 
focus between a display device and docu-
ments; difficulty focusing on the screen 
image; color fringes or after-images when 
you look away from the display device; 
and increased sensitivity to light. Eyestrain 
­associated with CVS is not thought to have 
serious or long-term consequences. Figure 
3-31 outlines some techniques you can 
­follow to ease eyestrain.
People who spend their workday using the 
computer sometimes complain of lower back 
pain, muscle fatigue, and emotional fatigue. 
Lower back pain sometimes is caused from poor posture. Always sit properly in the chair while you work. To alleviate 
back pain, muscle fatigue, and emotional fatigue, take a 15- to 30-minute break every 2 hours — stand up, walk around, 
stretch, and relax.
Techniques to Ease Eyestrain
• Every 10 to 15 minutes, take an eye break.
 - Look into the distance and focus on an object for 20 to 30 seconds.
 - Roll your eyes in a complete circle.
 - Close your eyes and rest them for at least one minute.
• Blink your eyes every five seconds.
• Place your display about an arm’s length away from your eyes
 with the top of the screen at or below eye level.
• Use large fonts.
• If you wear glasses, ask your doctor about computer glasses.
• Adjust the lighting.
Figure 3-31  Following these tips may help reduce eyestrain while using 
technology.

Chapter 3  Computers and Mobile Devices
Behavioral Health Risks
Some technology users become obsessed with computers, mobile devices, and the Internet. 
Technology addiction occurs when technology use consumes someone’s entire social life. 
Technology addiction is a growing health problem, but it can be treated through therapy and 
support groups.
People suffering from technology overload feel distressed when deprived of technology, even for 
a short length of time, or feel overwhelmed with the amount of technology they are required to 
manage. To cope with the feelings of distraction and to control the impact that technology can 
have on work and relationships, set aside technology-free time.
Consider This
How can you tell if you are addicted to technology?
Symptoms of a user with technology addiction include the following:
• Craves computer time
• Overjoyed when using a computer or mobile device
• Unable to stop using technology
• Irritable when not using technology
• Neglects family and friends
• Problems at work or school
	
Another way to help prevent these injuries is to be sure your workplace is designed 
­ergonomically. Ergonomics is an applied science devoted to incorporating comfort, efficiency, 
and safety into the design of items in the workplace. Ergonomic studies have shown that using 
the correct type and configuration of chair, keyboard, display, and work surface helps users 
work comfortably and efficiently and helps protect their health (Figure 3-32). You can hire an 
­ergonomic consultant to evaluate your workplace and recommend changes.

Energy Management
When you walk into your office at the start of 
a new day, you give little thought to the fact 
that the lights are on and the temperature is 
comfortable. For all you know, the air condi-
tioner and lighting were on all night; however, 
energy management systems are hard at work 
conserving energy and reducing energy costs. 
When you return home, you also might take 
for granted the fact that your dryer automati-
cally stops when it senses that your clothes 
are dry, or that your dishwasher or washing 
machine uses only enough water to sufficiently 
clean its contents. Individuals in the energy 
management field always are looking for ways 
to use technology to manage energy use.
Building automation systems are devices 
that can control various building components, 
such as complex air conditioning systems 
and lighting systems. Building automation 
systems adjust these components to provide 
a comfortable, safe working environment 
without wasting energy. For example, in an 
office building where employees all work 
weekdays from 8:00 a.m. until 5:00 p.m., the 
building automation system might prompt 
the air conditioner to turn on one or two 
hours before the first employees arrive. After 
the employees leave for the day, the air 
conditioner either may turn off for the evening 
or maintain a higher temperature to conserve 
energy. Some systems used in hotel rooms may 
include motion sensors that turn off the air 
conditioner if they sense no motion or noise in 
the room. Cruise ship cabins and hotel rooms 
with doors to a balcony may automatically 
shut down the air conditioner if the door is 
left open. Air conditioning systems often are 
one of the largest consumers of energy, and 
money spent toward automating one of these 
systems often can be recovered in smaller 
electricity bills. In addition to controlling the 
air conditioning system, building automation 
systems also can control and monitor lighting. 
Many newer buildings include motion and 
sound sensors in each room and automatically 
turn off lights when the rooms are unoccupied. 
Lighting in common areas of these buildings 
might turn off after hours when the building 
is unoccupied. Alternatively, if the building 
has plenty of natural light coming in, sensors 
automatically can turn off lights when 
sufficient sunlight is available, or turn on the 
lights when the sunlight decreases.
The energy management field has made 
significant advancements because of 
computer technologies. Businesses not only 
are able to reduce their energy costs, but they 
also are conserving energy at the same time.
  Consider This:  In what other ways do 
computers and technology play a role in the 
energy management field?

1	 Synchronize a Device
Synchronizing a mobile device with the cloud or a 
­computer provides a backup location for your data 
should your device fail, or 
become lost or stolen. While 
companies such as Google and 
Apple typically will allow you to 
download your purchased apps 
again free of charge, you also 
should synchronize your data so 
that it is available in the event a 
problem with your device arises. 
The following steps guide you 
through the process of synchro-
nizing a device.
Synchronize with the Cloud
a. Search for an app compatible with your device that 
allows you to synchronize the data on your device 
with the cloud. Some device manufacturers, such as 
Apple, provide a service to synchronize your device 
with the cloud.
b. If necessary, download and install the app.
c. The first time you run the app, you may need to 
enter some personal information so that you are 
able to sign in and access your data in the future.
d. Configure the app to synchronize at your desired 
interval. If you are synchronizing a smartphone, 
keep in mind that synchronizing with the cloud 
will require a data plan. Be sure your data 
plan supports the amount of data that will be 
synchronized.
e. Once you have configured the synchronization 
settings successfully, select the option to manually 
synchronize your device at this time.
Synchronize with a Computer
a. Install and run the app designed to synchronize your 
device with your computer. For instance, iTunes is 
used to synchronize Apple devices with a computer.
b. Connect the device to the computer using the 
synchronization cable provided.
c. When the synchronization is complete, a message 
will inform you that it is safe to disconnect the 
device. Do not disconnect the device before the 
synchronization is complete, as that may damage 
the data on the device.
Retrieve Synchronized Data
If you lose your device or the data on your device, you 
can retrieve the data previously synchronized. To retrieve 
data synchronized previously, follow the instructions in the 
­program or app used to synchronize your data.
Exercises
1. What type of device are you attempting to 
synchronize? What programs and apps are available 
to synchronize your device with the cloud? What 
programs and apps are available to synchronize your 
device with a computer?
2. Which program or app did you use to synchronize 
your device? Why did you choose that program or app 
instead of the others?
3. How long did it take to synchronize your device? 
What data on your device did the program or app 
synchronize?
2	 Find, Download, and Read an E-Book  
on an E-Book Reader
Most e-book readers enable you to find and download 
new e-books without having to connect to a computer 
first. To search for and download an e-book, you need 
to establish an Internet connection through either 
Wi-Fi or a mobile data plan. The following steps 
guide you through the process of finding, download-
ing, and reading an e-book on an e-book reader.
a. Turn on your e-book reader and establish an 
Internet connection.
b. Navigate to the store on your e-book reader where 
you can search for and download e-books.
c. Locate the option to search available e-books and 
then enter the desired search text. You usually can 
search by the book’s title, author, or genre.
Instructions: You often can complete tasks using technology in multiple ways. Figure out how to perform the tasks described in these exer-
cises by using one or more resources available to you (such as a computer or mobile device, articles on the web or in print, online or program 
help, user guides, blogs, podcasts, videos, other individuals, trial and error, etc.). Summarize your ‘how to’ steps, along with the resource(s) 
used, in the format requested by your instructor (brief report, presentation, discussion, blog post, video, or other means).

Transfer Media from a Mobile Device  
to a Computer
Many individuals take photos and record videos using 
mobile devices such as digital cameras, smartphones, 
and tablets. After taking the photos and recording the 
videos, transferring them to a computer allows you 
easily to create backup copies, edit the media, and 
create digital albums. The following steps describe 
multiple ways to transfer media from a mobile device 
to a computer.
To transfer photos from a mobile device to a computer 
using a memory card: 
a.  Safely remove the memory card from the mobile 
device.
b.  Properly insert the memory card into the appropriate 
memory card slot on the computer.
c.  When the computer detects the memory card, 
navigate to the location of the media to transfer.
d.  Select the files to transfer and then drag them to the 
destination folder on the computer.
e.  Use the operating system’s “Eject” or “Safely 
Remove” feature to remove the memory card from 
the computer safely and insert it back in the mobile 
device.
To transfer photos from a mobile device to a computer 
using a USB cable: 
a.  Connect the cable to the mobile device and to the 
computer.
b.  When the computer detects the mobile device, 
navigate to the location on the mobile device 
containing the media to transfer.
c.  Select the files to transfer and then drag them to the 
destination folder on the computer.
d.  Disconnect the USB cable from the computer and 
from the mobile device.
Some mobile devices also allow you to transfer 
media using wireless technologies, such as Bluetooth 
and Wi-Fi. The steps required to transfer photos 
wirelessly vary greatly for each device. Thus, read your 
mobile device’s documentation to see if and how you 
can transfer media to your computer wirelessly. Be 
aware that transferring photos using your mobile data 
plan could increase your data charges. Consider using 
Wi-Fi or Bluetooth to transfer the media.
Exercises

Making Use of the Web  
Retail and Auctions
E-retailers are changing the ways consumers shop for 
goods. One market research firm reports that nearly 
three-fourths of shoppers complete one-half of all their 
transactions online. As shoppers grow increasingly loyal 
to e-commerce, retail websites have become more sophis-
ticated, and brick-and-mortar stores have adapted to the 
online presence. Nearly 90 percent of smartphone owners 
use their devices to compare prices, locate promotional 
offers, and determine directions and store hours.
Online auctions offer another convenient method of 
shopping for and selling practically anything imaginable. 
Most auction sites organize products in categories and 
provide photos and descriptions. eBay is one of thousands 
of Internet auction websites and is the world’s largest 
personal online trading community. In addition, craigslist 
is a free online equivalent of classified advertisements.
Research This: (a) Visit two retail websites and search 
for the latest e-book readers. Which features do these 
websites offer compared with the same offerings in 
brick-and-mortar stores? What are the advantages and 
disadvantages of shopping online? What policies do 
these websites offer for returning items? Which items 
have you purchased online?
(b) Visit an auction website and search for two 
objects pertaining to your favorite musical artist, 
sports team, or celebrity. For example, search for an 
autographed photo or ticket stubs. Describe these two 
items. How many people have bid on these items? Who 
are the sellers? What are the opening and ­current bids?
2	 Social Media
Businesses know that using social media is an efficient 
and effective method of building brand loyalty and 
promoting the exchange of ideas. The informal com-
munication between consumers and company represen-
tatives can help maintain credibility and promote trust. 
According to a recent study, more than 70 percent of 
American Internet users visit online social networks, 
and 65 percent of these people discover particular 
brands, products, and services by reading material 
posted on these websites. Twitter, Facebook, and other 
social media often are used to befriend customers, give 
a positive feeling about services and goods, engage 
readers, and market new ideas. Subscribers share their 
opinions, thoughts, and experiences, either positive or 
negative, through product and service reviews.
Research This: Visit at least three Twitter, Facebook, 
or other online social network sites and review the 
content. How many Twitter followers or Facebook 
‘likes’ does the website have? Identify three orga-
nizations, businesses, products, or causes that have 
a presence on Facebook, Twitter, or other online 
social networks. How many followers or fans do they 
have? Which posts are engaging and promote posi-
tive attitudes about the company and the products or 
services offered? How many user-generated reviews 
and product ratings are shown? How do the online 
social networks encourage sharing opinions? In which 
ways do the companies respond to and interact with 
followers and fans? If negative posts are written, does 
the company respond professionally and positively?
3	 Search Skills  
Search Operators
Search engines provide operators, or special ­symbols, 
that will help narrow down search results. Use quo-
tation marks around search text to search for an 
exact word or phrase. For example, type the follow-
ing as your search text: "wireless communications 
­technologies" (be sure to include the quotation marks) 
to search for those three words in that exact order. 
Search results will display matching pages with the 
quoted search phrase highlighted or in bold.
Instructions: Use a search engine or another search tool to locate the information requested or answers to questions presented in the exercises. 
Describe your findings, along with the search term(s) you used and your web source(s), in the format requested by your instructor (brief report, 
presentation, discussion, blog post, video, or other means).
 Internet Research
The Internet Research exercises broaden your understanding of chapter concepts by 
requiring that you search for information on the web.

To match one or more words in a phrase, you can use 
an asterisk (*), also called a wildcard operator, as part of 
your search text. Each asterisk represents one or more 
words. For example, type the following as your search 
text: "wireless * technologies" (with the quotation 
marks) to find search results that match wireless com-
munications technologies, wireless Internet technolo-
gies, wireless and related technologies, and others. If 
you are searching for a phrase or quotation with many 
words, consider using the asterisk wildcard operator in 
place of some of the words in the search text. This tech-
nique is useful if you have a quotation, and you want to 
find out who said it or where it may have appeared.
Research This: Create search queries using ­quotation 
marks and/or the wildcard operator to answer the fol-
lowing questions and use a search engine to find the an-
swers. (1) Someone once said, “Life is not fair, get used 
to it.” Who was it? (2) What are three websites con-
taining digital camera reviews? (3) How do businesses 
use near field communications? (4) Find five different 
words that complete the phrase, handheld ___ devices, 
by typing appropriate search text into a search engine.

Security
Surge protectors and uninterruptible power ­supplies 
offer protection from electrical power surges, as you 
learned in the Protecting Hardware section of this 
chapter. While these surges are part of everyday 
life, they are more likely to occur during thunder-
storms and peak energy consumption periods. These 
unavoidable occurrences can damage or ruin sensitive 
electronic equipment. The processor in a computer 
is particularly sensitive to the fluctuations in current. 
When shopping for a surge protector, purchase the 
best product you can afford. Typically, the amount of 
protection offered by a surge protector is proportional 
to its cost. That is, the more expensive the surge pro-
tector, the more protection it offers.
Research This: Visit an electronics store or view 
websites with a variety of surge protectors from several 
manufacturers. Read the packaging or specifications 
to determine many of the features. Compare at least 
three surge protectors by creating a table using these 
headings: manufacturer, model, price, Joule rating (a 
Joule is the unit of energy the device can absorb before 
it can be damaged; the higher the Joule rating, the bet-
ter the protection), warranty, energy-absorption rating, 
response time, and other features. 
Which surge protector do you recom-
mend? Why?
5	   Cloud Services  
Data Providers and 
Mashups (DaaS)
The web has made it possible for 
many ­information ­providers to 
make business, housing, weather, 
­demographic, and other data avail-
able on demand to third parties. 
Accessing online data on demand 
is an example of DaaS (data as a 
service), a service of cloud comput-
ing that provides current data over 
the Internet for download, analysis, 
or use in new applications.
Mashups are apps that combine data from one or 
more online data providers. Mapping mashups are 
popular because users can visualize locations associated 
with data originating from a variety of online sources, 
including real estate listings, crime statistics, current 
Tweets, live traffic conditions, or digital photos.
Research This: (1) Use a search engine to find two 
different online data markets. Write a report sharing 
the sources or focus of information each provides, the 
availability of visualization tools to preview data, and 
how developers can access or incorporate the data into 
their own apps and websites. (2) Use a search engine to 
find a popular mapping mashup based on data from one 
of the sources listed above, or another topic. Identify 
the provider of the data and the provider of the maps 
on which the data is displayed. (3) Use a search engine 
to find an app or website that will help you create your 
own map mashup showing locations of your online 
data: Facebook friends, Flickr or Instagram photos, or 
Tweets. Take a screenshot of the mashup you made.

Critical Thinking
4.	National Security Uses for Technology  Technology is an integral part of military operations. Many military 
research projects use simulators that resemble civilian computer games. Your company has been contacted by the 
Department of Defense for a research project.
Do This: Form a four-member team, and then form two two-member groups. Assign each group one of the 
­following topics to research: (1) How have mobile computers and cloud computing affected issues of national 
­security? (2) How can the utilization of microchips worn by soldiers, or wearable computers, be integrated into 
­civilian use? Meet with your team and discuss your findings. Determine any advantages or disadvantages, as well as 
any legal ramifications that may arise.
Instructions: Evaluate the situations below, using personal experiences and one or more resources available to you (such as articles on the web or 
in print, blogs, podcasts, videos, television, user guides, other individuals, electronics or computer stores, etc.). Perform the tasks requested in each 
­exercise and share your deliverables in the format requested by your instructor (brief report, presentation, discussion, blog post, video, or other means).
The Critical Thinking exercises challenge your assessment and decision-making skills by  
presenting real-world situations associated with chapter concepts. The Collaboration 
­exercise should be completed with a team.
1.	Technology Purchases  
You are the director of information technology at 
a company that specializes in designing and selling 
customizable sportswear for local high school and 
college sports teams. Most of the technology equipment 
is out of date and must be replaced. You need to 
evaluate the requirements of individual employees so 
that you can order replacements.
Do This: Determine the type of computer or mobile 
device that might be most appropriate for the following 
employees: a graphic designer who exclusively works 
in the office, a cashier who is responsible for assisting 
customers with purchases, and a sales representative 
who travels to various locations and needs wireless 
communications capabilities. Consider the varying 
requirements of each, including mobility, security, and 
processing capabilities. Discuss various options that 
might work for each user, and considerations when 
purchasing each type of device.
2.	Game Devices  
You manage a youth recreation center and have 
been given a grant to purchase a game console and 
accessories, along with fitness games, for use at the 
center.
Do This: Use the web to research three popular 
recent game consoles. Choose five characteristics to 
compare the game consoles, such as Internet capa-
bilities, multiplayer game support, storage capacity, 
television connection, and game controllers. Research 
fitness games for each console and what accessories 
are needed to run the games. Determine the goals 
of each game, such as skill-building, weight loss, or 
entertainment. Read user reviews of each game, as well 
as professional reviews by gaming industry experts. If 
possible, survey your friends and classmates to learn 
about their experiences with each game, such as heart 
rate while playing the games, any fitness goals reached, 
and their enjoyment of the game.
3.	Case Study
Amateur Sports League  You are the new manager 
for a nonprofit amateur soccer league. The league 
would like to purchase a digital camera to upload pic-
tures of players, games, and fundraising events to its 
Facebook page and its website.
Do This: You need to prepare information about 
­digital camera options to present to the board of direc-
tors. First, research the cost and quality differences 
between point-and-shoot cameras and SLR cameras. 
Use the web to find a recent model of both camera 
types and compare the reviews, as well as the costs, for 
each. Make a list of additional features, such as video 
capabilities, editing capabilities, lens, megapixels, GPS, 
flash, and zoom. Determine how each camera stores 
the images, the amount of storage available, and how 
to transfer images to a computer or mobile device. 
Explore whether software is included with the camera 
that can be used to edit, store, or organize the images 
after they are transferred to a computer. Compare your 
findings with the camera capabilities of a recent model 
smartphone. Determine 
what type of camera would 
be best for the league’s 
needs and the capabilities 
that are most important.

Programs and Apps
Using programs and apps, you can accomplish a variety of tasks on computers and mobile 
devices (Figure 4-1). Recall from Chapter 1 that a program, or software, consists of a series 
of related instructions, organized for a common purpose, that tells the computer what tasks 
to ­perform and how to perform them. An application, or app, sometimes called application 
­software, consists of programs designed to make users more productive and/or assist them with 
­personal tasks.
An operating system is a set of programs that ­coordinates all the activities among computer or 
mobile device hardware. Other programs, often called tools or utilities, enable you to perform 
maintenance-type tasks usually related to managing devices, media, and programs used by 
computers and mobile devices. The operating system and other tools are collectively known as 
system software because they consist of the programs that control or maintain the operations of 
the computer and its devices.
Role of the Operating System
To use applications, such as a browser or word processing program on a desktop or laptop,  
your computer must be running an operating system. Similarly, a mobile device must be 
­running an operating system to run a mobile app, such as a navigation or payment app. Desktop 
­operating systems include Mac OS, Windows, Linux, and Chrome OS. Mobile operating 
­systems include Android, iOS, and Windows Phone. The operating system, therefore, serves 
as the interface between the user, the applications and other programs, and the computer’s or 
mobile device’s hardware (Figure 4-2).
After completing this chapter, you will be able to:
1	 Identify the general categories of programs and apps
2	 Describe how an operating system interacts with applications and hardware
3	 Differentiate among the ways you can acquire programs and apps: retail, custom, web app, mobile app, 
mobile web app, shareware, freeware, open source, and public-domain
4	 Identify the key features of productivity applications: word processing, presentation, spreadsheet, 
database, note taking, calendar and contact management, project management, accounting, personal 
finance, legal, tax preparation, document management, support services, and enterprise computing
5	 Identify the key features of graphics and media applications: computer-aided design, desktop publishing, 
paint/image editing, photo editing and photo management, video and audio editing, multimedia and 
website authoring, media player, and disc burning
6	 Identify the uses of personal interest applications: lifestyle, medical, entertainment, convenience, 
and education
7	 Identify the purpose of software used in communications
8	 Identify the key features of security tools: personal firewall, antivirus programs, malware removers,  
and Internet filters
9	 Identify the key features of file, disk, and system management tools: file manager, search, image viewer, 
uninstaller, disk cleanup, disk defragmenter, screen saver, file compression, PC maintenance, and backup 
and restore

Each time you start a computer or mobile device, the operating system is loaded (copied) 
from the computer’s hard drive or mobile device’s storage media into memory. Once the 
operating system is loaded, it coordinates all the activities of the computer or mobile device. 
This includes running applications and transferring data among input and output devices 
and memory. While the computer or mobile device is running, the operating system remains 
in memory.

Obtaining Software
Software is available in a variety of forms: retail, custom, web app, mobile app, mobile web 
app, shareware, freeware, open source, and public domain.
• Retail software is mass-produced, copyrighted software that meets the needs of a wide 
variety of users, not just a single user or company. Some retail software, such as an 
operating system, is preinstalled on new computers and mobile devices. You also can 
purchase retail software from local stores and on the web. With online purchases, you may 
be able to download purchased programs immediately instead of waiting for the software to 
arrive by mail.
• Custom software performs functions specific to a business or industry. Sometimes a company 
cannot locate retail software that meets its unique requirements. In this case, the company 
may use software developers to create tailor-made custom software. Custom software usually 
costs more than retail software.
• A web app is an application stored on a web server that you access through a browser. Users 
typically interact with web apps directly by visiting a website, but some web apps also can be 
accessed locally offline. Many websites provide free access to their apps. Some charge a one-
time fee, while others charge recurring monthly or annual subscription fees. You may be able 
to use part of a web app free and pay for access to a more comprehensive program or pay a fee 
when a certain action occurs.
• A mobile app is an application you download from a mobile device’s app store, sometimes called 
a marketplace, or other location on the Internet to a smartphone or other mobile device. Some 
mobile apps are preinstalled on a new mobile computer or device. Many mobile apps are free; 
others have a minimal cost — often less than a few dollars.
• A mobile web app is a web app that is optimized for display in a browser on a mobile device, 
regardless of screen size or orientation. Many app developers opt for web delivery because 
they do not have to create a different version for each mobile device’s app store. Many 
web apps use a responsive design, which means the app displays properly on any computer 
or device.
• Shareware is copyrighted software that is distributed at no cost for a trial period. To use 
a shareware program beyond that period, you send payment to the software developer or 
you might be billed automatically unless you cancel within a specified period of time. Some 
developers trust users to send payment if software use extends beyond the stated trial period. 
Others render the software useless if no payment is received after the trial period expires. In 
some cases, a scaled-down version of the software is distributed free, and payment entitles the 
user to the fully functional product.
• Freeware is copyrighted software provided at no cost by an individual or a company that 
retains all rights to the software. Thus, software developers typically cannot incorporate 
freeware in applications they intend to sell. The word, free, in freeware indicates the software 
has no charge.
• Open source software is software provided for use, modification, and redistribution. This 
software has no restrictions from the copyright holder regarding modification of the software’s 
internal instructions and its redistribution. Open source software usually can be downloaded 
from a web server on the Internet, often at no cost. Promoters of open source software state 
two main advantages: users who modify the software share their improvements with others, 
and customers can personalize the software to meet their needs.
• Public-domain software has been donated for public use and has no copyright restrictions. 
Anyone can copy or distribute public-domain software to others at no cost.
BTW
Trial Versions
Some retail and other 
programs have a trial 
version, which is an 
application you can 
use at no charge for a 
limited time, to see if it 
meets your needs. Some 
trial versions have limited 
functionality.
BTW
Copyright
A copyright gives 
authors, artists, and 
other creators of original 
work exclusive rights to 
duplicate, publish, and 
sell their materials.

Thousands of shareware, freeware, and public-domain programs are available on the Internet 
for users to download. Examples include communications, graphics, and game programs. Read

Secure IT 4-1
Safe Downloading Websites
Websites tempt potential customers with 
catchy offers for software promising to 
speed up the computer or to obtain the 
­latest versions of games and music. The 
temptation to download shareware, free-
ware, and public-domain software is high, 
especially when the cost of such useful or 
fun programs is free or extremely reason-
able. This action could be dangerous, how-
ever, because some of these websites are 
filled with virus-infected software just wait-
ing to be installed on an unsuspecting user’s 
computer or mobile device.
Before downloading any software, consider 
these factors when locating and evaluating 
shareware, freeware, or public-domain 
websites:
• Search for popular shareware, freeware, 
and public-domain download websites.  
The software generally is organized  
into ­evaluation categories, such as 
­outstanding and recommended, or  
grouped into ­purpose, such as tools and 
gaming.
• Look for websites with programs for your 
particular type of computer or mobile 
device. Some websites exclusively offer 
Windows- or Apple-based products.
• Obtain the latest versions of shareware, 
freeware, and public-domain software. 
Many developers update their programs 
frequently in an effort to include new 
features and to thwart viruses. The  
newest versions, therefore, often are  
safer and easier to use than previous 
­versions.
• Locate websites with a variety of programs 
in a specific category. For example, if you 
need antivirus software, you can search 
to find which shareware, freeware, and 
public-domain software is available.
• Read ratings for and reviews of products. 
Often, comments from users provide 
guidance in selecting the most desirable 
software for your needs.
If you follow these tips, you may find 
shareware, freeware, and public-domain 
software to be one of the best software 
bargains in the marketplace.
  Consider This: Have you ever used 
or downloaded programs or apps from a 
shareware, freeware, or public-domain soft-
ware website? If so, what software did you 
acquire? If not, would you consider locat-
ing shareware, freeware, or public-domain 
­software for your particular needs? Why or 
why not?
Consider This
What is software as a service?
Software as a service (SaaS) describes a computing environment where an Internet server hosts and deploys 
applications. Editing projects or photos, sending email messages, and managing finances are common consumer 
tasks of SaaS applications. For an exercise related to SaaS, see the Internet Research: Cloud Services exercise at the 
end of this chapter.
	
Installing Software
Recall from Chapter 1 that you typically need to install desktop apps on a computer. Installing 
is the process of setting up the software to work with a computer, printer, and other hardware. 
Mobile apps typically install automatically after you download the app from the device’s app 
store. You usually do not need to install web apps before you can use them, but you may need to 
install plug-ins, such as Java or Flash, so that the web apps work.
During installation of software or before the first use, a program or app may ask you to ­register 
and/or activate the software. Software registration typically is optional and usually involves sub-
mitting your name and other personal information to the software manufacturer or developer. 
Registering the software often entitles you to product support. Product activation is a technique that 
some software manufacturers use to ensure that you do not install the software on more computers  
than legally licensed. Usually, the software can be run a preset number of times, has limited

Syncing Apps
When you install an 
app on one computer 
or device, it also will 
install automatically on 
any other computers 
and devices on the same 
subscription plan.

­functionality, or does not function until you activate it via the Internet or by phone. Thus, 
­activation is a required process for programs that request it. Some software allows multiple 
­activations; for example, you can install it and run it on a laptop and a desktop. Registering and/
or activating software also usually entitles you to free program updates for a specified time period, 
such as a year.
Many desktop and mobile apps use an automatic update feature, where the updates can be 
­configured to download and install automatically. With web apps, by contrast, you always access 
the latest version of the software.

What is a license agreement?
A license agreement, sometimes called an end-user license agreement (EULA), is the right to use a program or app. The 
license agreement provides specific conditions for use of the software, which a user typically must accept before using the 
software (Figure 4-3). Unless otherwise specified by a license agreement, you do not have the right to copy, loan, borrow, 
rent, or in any way distribute programs or apps. Doing so is a violation of copyright law; it also is a federal crime.

Categories of Programs and Apps
With programs and apps, you can work on a variety of projects — such as creating ­letters, 
memos, reports, and other documents; developing presentations; preparing and filing taxes; 
drawing and altering images; recording and enhancing audio and video clips; obtaining direc-
tions or maps; playing games individually or with others; composing email and other messages; 
protecting computers and mobile devices from malware; organizing media; locating files; and 
much more. Table 4-1 categorizes popular categories of programs and apps by their ­general use.

Are the categories of programs and apps shown in Table 4-1 mutually exclusive?
Programs and apps listed in one category may be used in other categories. For example, photo editing 
applications, which appear in the graphics and media category, often also are used for business or personal 
productivity. Additionally, the programs and apps in the last three categories (communications; security; and file, 
disk, and system management) often are used in conjunction with or to support programs and apps in the first 
three categories (productivity, graphics and media, and personal interest). For example, email appears in the 
communications category but also is a productivity application.

Productivity Applications
Productivity applications can assist you in becoming more effective and efficient while ­performing 
daily activities at work, school, and home. Productivity applications include word processing, 
presentation, spreadsheet, database, note taking, calendar and contact management, project 
management, accounting, personal finance, legal, tax preparation, document management, and 
enterprise computing.
A variety of manufacturers offer productivity apps in each of these areas, ranging from ­desktop 
to mobile to web apps. Many have a desktop version and a corresponding mobile version 
adapted for smaller screen sizes and/or touch screens.
Developing Projects
With productivity applications, users often create, edit, format, save, and distribute projects. 
Projects include documents, presentations, spreadsheets, notes, calendars, contact lists, budgets, 
and more.
During the process of developing a project, you likely will switch back and forth among the 
following activities.
 1. When you create a project, you enter text or numbers, insert images, add contacts, schedule 
appointments, and perform other tasks using a variety of input methods, such as a keyboard, 
a mouse, touch, or voice.
 2. To edit a project means to make changes to its existing content. Common editing tasks 
include inserting, deleting, cutting, copying, and pasting.
 a. Inserting involves adding text, images, or other content.
 b. Deleting involves removing text, images, or other content.
 c. Cutting is the process of removing content and storing it in a temporary storage location, 
called a clipboard.
 d. Copying is the process of placing content on a clipboard, with the content remaining in 
the project. Read Ethics & Issues 4-1 for a discussion about unethical copying.
 e. Pasting is the process of transferring content from a clipboard to a specific location in 
a project.
Ethics & Issues 4-1
What Can Schools and Employers Do to 
Prevent Internet Plagiarism?
The Internet has made it easier for students 
and employees to plagiarize; in contrast, it 
also provides tools that schools and employ-
ers can use to detect illegal copying. Schools 
often have specific rules about what consti-
tutes plagiarism. Employees, such as journal-
ists, are expected to follow ethical guidelines 
when copying or citing content.
The Internet offers many ways for students 
to cheat intentionally, including websites 
that allow you to purchase a research 
paper. Students may not realize that copying 
information without properly citing it also 
is plagiarism. Students who intentionally 
plagiarize blame competition. Teachers 
have several tools to catch plagiarists, 
including services that compare papers to 
others on the Internet and produce a report 
highlighting content resembling previously 
published writing.
A journalist might be expected not only 
to produce multiple articles daily but also to 
use social media to keep readers engaged. 
This pressure tempts some journalists to copy 
content, sometimes without giving credit 
or linking to the original source. The laws 
against plagiarism are the same whether 
copying content from a respected news 
source, a personal blog, or social media. 
The pressures of time and expectations 
of content can create high-profile cases 
of plagiarism that affect not only the 
journalist but the news source for which he 
or she writes.
Some argue that the best way to prevent 
cheating is to educate. First, teach the values 
and discuss the consequences of cheating. 
Next, teach how to cite sources properly and 
summarize information. Before copying or 
paraphrasing another person’s work, contact 
him or her to request permission. When 
in doubt, check with a librarian, editor, or 
instructor.
Consider This: How should educators and 
employers deal with plagiarism? Should 
schools use a paper-comparison service in 
an attempt to stop cheating? Why or why 
not? Does linking to the original source 
excuse a journalist who copies content? 
Why or why not?

 3. When users format a project, they change its appearance. Formatting is important because 
the overall look of a project significantly can affect its capability to communicate information 
clearly. Examples of formatting tasks are changing the font, font size, and font style (Figure 4-4).
 a. A font is a name assigned to a specific design of characters. Cambria and Calibri are 
examples of fonts.
 b. Font size indicates the size of the characters in a particular font. Font size is gauged by a 
measurement system called points. A single point is about 1/72 of an inch in height.
 c. A font style adds emphasis to a font. Bold, italic, underline, and color are examples of font styles.
 4. During the process of creating, editing, and formatting a project, the computer or mobile 
device holds it in memory. To keep the project for future use requires that you save it. When 
you save a project, the computer transfers the project from memory to a local storage medium, 
such as a USB flash drive or hard drive, or cloud storage, so that you can retrieve it later.
 5. You can distribute a project as a hard copy or electronically. A hard copy is information that 
exists on a physical medium, such as paper. To generate a hard copy, you print a project. 
Sending electronic files via email or posting them for others to view, on websites for exam-
ple, saves paper and printer supplies. Many users opt for electronic distribution because it 
contributes to green computing.

How often should you save a project, and why do some apps not require you save?
Saving at regular intervals, such as every 5 or 10 minutes, ensures that the majority of your work will not be 
lost in the event of a power loss or system failure. Many programs have an AutoSave feature that automati-
cally saves open projects at specified time intervals, such as every 10 minutes.
Some web and mobile apps, such as online productivity apps, save your work instantly as you type. These 
apps and the document both are stored on the cloud. Thus, the app automatically saves your changes to a 
cloud server with every keystroke.

What is a clip art/image gallery?
Applications often include a clip art/image gallery, which is a collection of clip art and photos. Some 
­applications contain links to additional clips available on the web or are available as web apps. You also can 
purchase clip art/image gallery software that contains thousands of images.
In addition to clip art and photos, many clip art/image galleries provide fonts, animations, sounds, video 
clips, and audio clips. You can use the images, fonts, and other items from the clip art/image gallery in all 
types of projects, including documents, brochures, worksheets, and slide shows.

Word Processing
Word processing software, sometimes called a word processor, is an application that allows 
users to create and manipulate documents containing mostly text and sometimes ­graphics 
(Figure 4-5). Millions of people use word processing software on their computers and mobile 
devices every day to develop documents such as letters, memos, reports, mailing labels, 
­newsletters, and webpages.
A major advantage of using word processing software is that it enables users to change their 
written words easily. Word processing software also has many features to make documents look 
professional and visually appealing. For example, you can change the font, size, and color of 
characters; apply special effects, such as three-dimensional shadows; use built-in styles to format 
documents; and organize text in newspaper-style columns.
Most word processing software allows users to incorporate graphics, such as digital photos 
and clip art, in documents. In Figure 4-5, a user inserted an image of a tractor in the document.  
With word processing software, you easily can modify the appearance of an image after 
­inserting it in the document.
You can use word processing software to define the 
size of the paper on which to print and to specify 
the margins. A feature, called wordwrap, allows 
users to type words in a paragraph continually 
without pressing the enter key at the end 
of each line. While you edit a paragraph 
or change the paragraph margins, the 
words in the paragraph automatically 
wrap, or reflow within the para-
graph. As you type more lines of 
text than can be displayed on 
the screen, the top portion 
of the document moves 
upward, or scrolls, off 
the screen.

Word processing software typically includes tools to assist 
you with the writing process. For example, a spelling checker 
reviews the spelling of individual words, sections of a docu-
ment, or the entire document. A grammar checker detects 
­passive voice, ­run-on sentences, and grammatical errors. A 
­format checker identifies extraneous spaces, capitalization 
errors, and more.

Presentation
Presentation software is an application that allows users 
to create visual aids for presentations to communicate ideas, 
messages, and other information to a group. The presentations 
can be viewed as slides, sometimes called a slide show, that are 
displayed on a large monitor or on a projection screen from a 
computer or mobile device (Figure 4-6).
Presentation software typically provides a variety of 
­predefined presentation formats that define complementary 
colors for backgrounds, text, and graphical accents on the 
slides. This software also provides a variety of layouts for each 
individual slide such as a title slide, a two-column slide, and a 
slide with clip art, a chart, a table, or a diagram. In addition, 
you can enhance any text, charts, and graphics on a slide with 
3-D effects, animation, and other special effects, such as shad-
ing, shadows, and textures.
When building a presentation, users can set the slide timing 
so that the presentation automatically displays the next slide 
after a preset delay. Presentation software allows you to apply 
special effects to the transition between slides. One slide, for 
example, might fade away as the next slide appears.
Presentation software typically includes a clip gallery that 
provides images, photos, video clips, and audio clips to enhance 
presentations. Some audio and video editing applications work 
with presentation software, providing users with an easy means 
to record and insert video, music, and audio commentary in a 
presentation.
You can view or print a finished presentation in a variety 
of formats, including a hard copy outline of text from each 
slide and handouts that show completed slides. Presentation 
software also incorporates features such as checking spelling, 
formatting, researching, and creating webpages from existing 
slide shows.

Spreadsheet
Spreadsheet software is an application that allows users  
to organize data in columns and rows and perform calcula-
tions on the data. These columns and rows collectively are 
called a worksheet. Most spreadsheet software has basic 
­features to help users create, edit, and format worksheets.  
A spreadsheet file also is known as a workbook because it can

contain ­thousands of related individual worksheets. Data is organized vertically in columns and 
­horizontally in rows on each worksheet (Figure 4-7).
Each worksheet usually can have thousands of columns and rows. One or more letters identify 
each column, and a number identifies each row. Only a small fraction of these columns and rows 
are visible on the screen at one time. Scrolling through the worksheet displays different parts of 
it on the screen.
A cell is the intersection of a column and row. The spreadsheet software identifies cells by the 
column and row in which they are located. For example, the intersection of column B and row 4 
is referred to as cell B4. As shown in Figure 4-7, cell B4 contains the number, $1,000.29, which 
represents the wages for January.
Many of the worksheet cells shown in Figure 4-7 contain a number, called a value, that can 
be used in a calculation. Other cells, however, contain formulas that generate values. A formula 
performs calculations on the data in the worksheet and displays the resulting value in a cell, 
usually the cell containing the formula. When creating a worksheet, you can enter your own 
formulas. In Figure 4-7, for example, cell B17 could contain the formula =B9+B10+B11+B12+ 
B13+B14+B15+B16, which would add (sum) the contents of cells B9, B10, B11, B12, B13, B14, 
B15, and B16. That is, this formula calculates the total expenses for January.
A function is a predefined formula that performs common calculations, such as adding the 
­values in a group of cells or generating a value such as the time or date. For example, the func-
tion =SUM(B9:B16) instructs the spreadsheet application to add all of the numbers in the range 
of cells B9 through B16. Spreadsheet applications contain many built-in functions.
One of the more powerful features of spreadsheet software is its capability to recalculate the 
rest of the worksheet when data in a cell changes. Spreadsheet software’s capability of recalculat-
ing data also makes it a valuable budgeting, forecasting, and decision-making tool. Another stan-
dard feature of spreadsheet software is charting, which depicts the data in graphical form, such 
as bar charts or pie charts. A visual representation of data through charts often makes it easier 
for users to see at a glance the relationship among the numbers.

Chapter 4  Programs and Apps
Database
A database is a collection of data organized in a manner that allows access, retrieval, and use 
of that data. In a manual database, you might record data on paper and store it in a filing cabi-
net. With a database stored electronically, such as the one shown in Figure 4-8, the computer 
stores the data on a storage medium, such as a hard drive or optical disc, or on cloud storage.
Database software is an application that allows users to create, access, and manage a database. 
Using database software, you can add, change, and delete data in a database; sort and retrieve 
data from the database; and create forms and reports using the data in the database.
With most personal computer database programs, a database consists of a collection of tables, 
organized in rows and columns. Each row, called a record, contains data about a given item 
in the database, which is often a person, product, object, or event. Each column, called a field, 
­contains a specific category of data within a record. The Publishing database shown in Figure 4-8 
consists of two tables: a Customer table and a Book Rep table. The Customer table contains 15 
records (rows), each storing data about one customer. The customer data is grouped into 10 fields 
­(columns): CU # (customer number), Customer Name, Street, City, State, Postal Code, Amount 
Paid, Current Due, Returns, and BR # (book rep number). The Current Due field, for instance, 
contains the amount of money the customer owes the publisher. The Customer and Book Rep 
tables relate to each other through a common field, BR # (book rep number).
Users run queries to retrieve data. A query is a request for specific data from the database. For 
example, a query might request a list of customers whose balance is greater than $20,000. After 
obtaining the results of a query, database applications can present them on the screen, send them 
to a printer, or save them in a file.
BTW
Web Databases
You likely interact 
with many databases 
without realizing it. For 
example, much of the 
information you access 
on the web — including 
photos, videos, movies, 
job listings, reservation 
details, and class 
registrations — is stored 
in databases.

Consider This
When should you use a database instead of a spreadsheet program?
Although databases and spreadsheets both store data, these programs have different purposes and ­capabilities. 
Spreadsheet programs are ideal for calculating results or creating charts from value in the ­worksheet. You should 
use a database program, however, if want to collect, reorganize and filter data, and/or create reports from the data.

Note Taking
Note taking software is an application that 
enables users to enter typed text, handwritten 
comments, drawings, sketches, photos, and links 
anywhere on a page and then save the page as 
part of a notebook (Figure 4-9). Users also can 
include audio recordings as part of their notes. 
Some enable users to sync their notes to the 
cloud so that they can access the notes on any 
computer or mobile device. Many note taking 
applications also include a calendar feature.
Users find note taking software ­convenient 
during meetings, class lectures and confer-
ences, and in libraries and other settings 
that previously required pencil and paper for 
recording thoughts and discussions.

Calendar and Contact Management
Calendar and contact management software is an application that helps you organize your 
calendar, keep track of contacts, and share this information with other users, who can view it on 
their computers and mobile devices (Figure 4-10). This software provides a way for individuals and 
workgroups to organize, find, view, and share appointment and contact information easily. Although 
sometimes available separately, calendar and contact management software often exists as a unit in a 
single program. Many email applications include calendar and contact management features.

Software Suite
A software suite is a collection of individual related applications available together as a unit. 
Productivity software suites typically include, at a minimum, word processing, presentation, 
spreadsheet, and email applications. While several productivity suites are designed to be installed 
on a local computer, some are web apps and/or mobile web apps that enabling you to share and 
collaborate with projects stored on the cloud.

Consider This
Why would you use a software suite instead of a stand-alone application?
Software suites offer three major advantages: lower cost, ease of use, and integration.
• When you purchase a software suite, the suite usually costs significantly less than purchasing each application 
individually, or as stand-alone applications.
• Software suites provide ease of use because the applications in the suite normally use a consistent interface and share 
features, such as clip art and spelling checker.
• Applications in a software suite often are integrated, which makes it easy to share information among them. For 
example, you can copy a chart created from a worksheet in a spreadsheet program and paste it into a slideshow 
in the presentation software.

Accounting
Accounting software is an application that helps businesses of all sizes record and report their 
financial transactions. With accounting software, business users perform accounting ­activities 
related to the general ledger, accounts 
receivable, accounts payable, purchasing, 
invoicing (Figure 4-12), and payroll func-
tions. Accounting software also enables 
business users to write and print checks, 
track checking account activity, and 
update and reconcile balances on demand.
Most accounting software supports 
online credit checks, bill payment, direct 
deposit, and ­payroll services. Some offer 
more complex features, such as job cost-
ing and estimating, time tracking, mul-
tiple company reporting, foreign currency 
reporting, and forecasting the amount of 
raw materials needed for products. The 
cost of accounting software for small busi-
nesses ranges from less than one hundred 
to several thousand dollars. Accounting 
software for large businesses can cost 
­several hundred thousand dollars.

Manage a Project Using Project 
Management Software
Several project management programs and 
apps exist that are both free and fee based. 
Project management programs and apps 
are designed for projects of specific sizes, 
so be sure to research the various programs 
and apps on the market and choose one 
that best suits your needs. To manage a 
project using project management software, 
follow these steps:
1.	 Make sure you understand the project in 
its entirety, as well as the steps you must 
take to bring the project to ­completion.
2.	 Determine the date by which the project 
must be completed.
3.	 Verify you have the appropriate 
resources (people and materials) to 
­complete the project. If you do not have 
the necessary resources, you should  
obtain them.
4.	 Determine the order of the steps that 
must be taken to bring the project to 
completion. Identify steps that must be 
taken before other steps, as well as steps 
that can be completed at the same time 
as other steps.
5.	 Verify the feasibility of the plan.
6.	 During the project, it will be necessary to 
update the progress and possibly adjust 
dates. Changes to the project and its 
dates should be communicated to the 
entire project team.

Consider This
Does the term, project, have two meanings in the technology field?
Yes. As discussed earlier in this chapter, a project can be a deliverable you create using application software, such 
as a document, presentation, spreadsheet, notes, calendar, contact list, budget, and more. A project also describe 
the collection of tasks and processes required to develop a solution to a problem.

Using Personal Finance Apps Safely
Personal finance apps offer convenient and 
easy methods to pay bills, deposit checks, 
examine account balances, verify payments, 
and transfer funds. They also are a magnet for 
cybercriminals to snatch an unsuspecting user’s 
personal information and send it to someone 
else anywhere in the world, who then can use 
the information for monetary transactions. 
Nearly one-third of malware banking apps 
target customers in the United States with 
malicious instructions that invade their smart-
phones and gain access to information stored 
on their devices. Users in Brazil, Australia, and 
France also are becoming extremely popular 
targets for banking thieves. By using ­caution 
and common sense, however, users can take 
steps to safeguard their funds and their 
­identities by following these practices:
• Evaluate the apps. Fraudulent apps may 
resemble legitimate apps from financial 
­institutions. They often, however, are 
riddled with misspellings and awkward 
sentences. In addition, legitimate compa-
nies rarely promote downloading an app 
from a pop-up or pop-under advertisement. 
If you desire an app from a bank or other 
financial institution, visit that company’s 
website for instructions about downloading 
and installing its authentic apps.
• Use strong passwords to access the 
apps. Many of the more secure personal 
finance apps have dual passwords that 
­involve typing a string of characters and 
also validating a picture. In addition, be 
certain to password protect your mobile 
device.
• Guard your smartphone. At least  
100 smartphones are lost or stolen every 
­minute in the United States according to 
MicroTrax, an asset protection company. 
With that figure in mind, store as little 
personal information as possible on your 
phone so that if the mobile device is 
lost, the chance of having your identity 
stolen and your accounts compromised is 
lessened. Also install software to locate 
your lost or stolen device and to erase its 
content remotely.
• Verify the transactions. Always verify 
your transactions by scrutinizing monthly 
statements. In addition, periodically check 
balances and alert your financial institution 
if any activity seems abnormal.
  Consider This: Have you used finance 
apps? If so, which ones? When making 
transactions, do you follow some of the tips 
described in this box? If not, would you 
consider ­downloading an app to complete 
some ­common banking transactions? Why or 
why not?
Personal Finance
Personal finance software is a simplified accounting application that helps home users 
and small/home office users balance their checkbooks, pay bills, track personal income 
and expenses, verify account balances, 
transfer funds, track investments, and 
evaluate financial plans (Figure 4-13). 
Personal finance software helps deter-
mine where, and for what purpose, you 
are spending money so that you can 
manage your finances.
Most personal finance software 
includes financial planning features, 
such as analyzing home and personal 
loans, preparing income taxes, and man-
aging retirement savings. Other features 
include managing home inventory and 
setting up budgets. Most of these appli-
cations also offer a variety of online ser-
vices, such as online banking and online 
investing. Read Secure IT 4-2 for safety 
tips when using personal finance apps 
on your smartphone or other mobile 
device.

Legal
Legal software is an application that assists in the preparation of legal documents and 
­provides legal information to individuals, families, and small businesses (Figure 4-14). Legal 
software provides standard contracts and documents associated with buying, selling, and 
­renting property; estate planning; marriage and divorce; and preparing a will or living trust. 
By ­answering a series of questions or completing a form, the legal software tailors the legal 
document to specific needs. Read Ethics & Issues 4-2 to consider whether an attorney should 
review ­documents created with legal software.

Ethics & Issues 4-2
Should an Attorney Review Documents 
Created with Legal Software?
If you want to sublet your apartment or buy 
or sell a used car, should you seek legal 
help? Hiring an attorney to create a lease 
or sale agreement can cost hundreds of dol-
lars. Legal software or website services, on 
the other hand, typically cost less than $100 
and sometimes are free. While it is tempting 
to opt for the route that will save money, 
you should evaluate the program to make 
sure it is up to date, addresses the latest 
laws and provisions that are specific to your 
state, and includes a legal dictionary. If you 
use a program that is out of date or creates 
an incomplete or invalid legal document, the 
cost for an attorney to correct the document 
could exceed the amount you originally 
spent on the program.
A lease that you create or sign regarding 
subletting or renting an apartment should 
have provisions for payment of any damages, 
breaking or extending the agreement, and 
who is responsible for routine maintenance 
and repair. In some states, the property 
owner must disclose any mold, lead paint, or 
water quality issues. Sales agreements, such 
as for used cars, should include language 
that protects the buyer from undisclosed 
damage to the car, as well as clearly specify 
any further responsibility of the car seller.
Attorneys caution against using legal 
software unless you intend to have an 
attorney review the document. Not only can 
they validate the accuracy of the document, 
attorneys claim they can provide for gaps in 
the software; further, they are versed in laws 
specific to your state or circumstance. Others 
argue that any legal document is better than 
a verbal agreement and can protect both 
parties.
Consider This: Would you use legal 
­software to create a legal document? Why 
or why not? Would you sign a legal docu-
ment created with software without con-
sulting an attorney? Why or why not? How 
do mistakes made as a result of using legal 
software differ from mistakes that result 
from human error?

After you answer a series of ques-
tions and complete basic forms, 
the software creates and analyzes 
your tax forms to search for missed 
potential errors and deduction 
opportunities.
Once the forms are complete, you 
can print any necessary ­paperwork; 
then, they are ready for filing.

Document Management
Document management 
­software is an application that 
provides a means for sharing, dis-

documents by converting them 
into a format that can be viewed by 
any user. The converted document, 
which mirrors the original docu-
ment’s appearance, can be viewed 
and printed without the software 
that created the original ­document. 
Some document management 
­software allows users to edit ­content 
and add comments to the ­converted 
document (Figure 4-16).
Many businesses use ­document 
management software to share 
and distribute company brochures, 
literature, and other documents 
electronically. Home users distrib-
ute flyers, announcements, and 
graphics electronically. A popular 
electronic image file format that 
document management software 
uses to save converted documents is 
PDF (Portable Document Format), 
­developed by Adobe Systems.

Enterprise Computing
A large organization, commonly referred to as an enterprise, requires special computing 
­solutions because of its size and geographic distribution. A typical enterprise consists of a wide 
variety of departments, centers, and divisions — collectively known as functional units. Nearly 
every enterprise has the following functional units: human resources, accounting and finance, 
engineering or product development, manufacturing, marketing, sales, distribution, customer 
service, and information technology.
Software used in functional units is not mutually exclusive; however, each functional unit in an 
enterprise uses specific software, as outlined below.
• Human resources software manages employee information, such as pay rate, benefits, personal 
information, performance evaluations, training, and vacation time.
• Accounting software manages everyday transactions, such as sales and payments to suppliers. 
Finance software helps managers budget, forecast, and analyze.
• Engineering or product development software allows engineers to develop plans for new 
products and test their product designs.
• Manufacturing software assists in the assembly process, as well as in scheduling and managing 
the inventory of parts and products.
• Marketing software allows marketing personnel to create marketing campaigns, target 
demographics, and track their effectiveness.
• Sales software enables the salesforce to manage contacts, schedule meetings, log customer 
interactions, manage product information, and take customer orders.
• Distribution software analyzes and tracks inventory and manages product shipping  
status.
• Customer service software manages the day-to-day interactions with customers, such as phone 
calls, email messages, web interactions, and messaging sessions.
• Information technology staff use a variety of programs and apps to maintain and secure the 
hardware and software in an enterprise.

Web and Mobile Apps 
for Personal and 
Business Productivity
Whether you are checking appointments, sending or 
reading email messages, arranging travel, banking or 
looking up information online, making a purchase, scan-
ning QR (quick response) codes or bar codes, or checking 
in with friends on online social networks, web and mobile 
apps can assist your personal and business productivity.
Calendar and Email
Maintaining a calendar and checking email messages 
are common tasks of calendar and email web and mobile 
apps. Calendar apps keep track of your appointments 
and synchronize information entered on a mobile device 
with your online or desktop calendar software. Email 
mobile apps integrate with your device's address book to 
display names from your device's contact list that match 
a recipient’s name as you type it, and with your device's 
photo gallery for sending photos.
Travel
Purchasing flights, hotels, 
rental cars, or travel ser-
vices is a common online 
task for personal and busi-
ness travelers. Travel apps 
display available options 
and allow you to filter 
results. Many allow you to 
share travel plans with your 
online social networks.
Financial
You can access bank accounts or investments using 
a financial app. Financial mobile apps track expenses as 
you spend money and notify you when a bill is due. To 
help secure information, financial mobile apps can dis-
able access if your device is stolen or lost. Some bank-
ing mobile apps allow you to upload a photo of a check 
taken with the device’s camera to process the deposit.
Reference
Dictionaries, encyclopedias, books, and directories 
are available online as reference apps. Many have 
associated mobile apps that format information for 
mobile devices, or take advantage of their features. 
For example, rather than typing a search term in a 
dictionary web app to look up its definition, a mobile 
app also might offer voice input. On the mobile version 
of an encyclopedia app, you might shake the device 
to display random topics or redisplay the app’s home 
screen. Some reference mobile apps also can download 
­information directly to your phone for offline access.
Retail
Online marketplaces and payment services support 
­buying and selling items and transferring funds from one 
party to another. Marketplace apps enable customers 
to research products, enter or examine product reviews, 
and make purchases. A retail store mobile app might use 
a device’s GPS to offer special deals closest to the cus-
tomer’s location. You also might use a device’s camera 
to scan a product’s bar code and then place the item in 
a shopping cart. Payment services allow customers to 
send money or pay for items using mobile devices. Read 
Secure IT 4-3 for safety tips when using payment apps.
Scanning
Scanning apps use a mobile device's camera to scan 
a QR code or bar code. A QR code is a square-shaped 
graphic that represents a web address or other informa-
tion. A QR code reader app scans 
a QR code, and then displays its 
corresponding information. A bar 
code scanner reads a bar code 
and may provide product infor-
mation, price, or reviews. Some 
supermarkets provide shopping 
apps for customers to scan bar 
codes of items they purchase. 
These apps create a customized shopping list, ordering 
items by their aisle location in the store, to provide a 
more efficient ­shopping experience.
Online Social Networks
Many users connect with family, friends, and 
­coworkers using online social network mobile apps. 
Online social network web apps often integrate 
instant messaging and video chat communications. 
Online social network mobile apps allow users to 
include photos and videos from their device in their 
updates easily.
  Consider This: Compare the web and mobile 
versions of the same app for personal and business 
productivity. Which features are common to both? Which 
features in the mobile version are not found in the web 
version? Which features in the web version are not found 
in the mobile version? Why do you think the developers 
made these decisions? Which features would you like to 
see that are missing from either version of the app?

Graphics and Media Applications
In addition to productivity applications, many people work with software designed ­specifically 
for their field of work. Power users, such as engineers, architects, desktop publishers, and 
graphic artists, often use sophisticated software that allows them to work with graphics and 
media. Many of these applications incorporate user-friendly interfaces or scaled-down versions, 
making it possible for the home and small business users also to create projects using these 
types of programs.
Graphics and media applications include computer-aided design, desktop publishing, paint/
image editing, photo editing and photo management, video and audio editing, multimedia and 
website authoring, media players, and disc burning.
Secure IT 4-3
Avoiding Risks Using Payment Apps
Paying for coffee at the local coffee shop 
or buying tools at the hardware store has 
become streamlined with the advent of 
mobile payment apps. More than 15 percent 
of Starbucks transactions are accomplished 
using a smartphone app instead of using 
cash or credit card, and many merchants are 
accepting this form of payment as mobile 
wallet apps become more secure. The users 
enjoy the convenience of maintaining control 
when they scan their phone at the checkout 
counter instead of handing a credit card to a 
clerk. This security factor becomes even more 
pronounced at restaurants, where unscrupu-
lous employees can take credit cards away 
from the table and then have full access to 
the personal information on the cards.
Mobile payment providers state that using 
their apps is more secure than using plastic 
credit cards. The apps use a payment system 
on phones equipped with an NFC chip, which 
stores data that is transmitted to a contactless 
terminal and verified as a legitimate sale. A 
smartphone user never enters an account 
number at the cash register because all 
financial information is stored on the mobile 
payment system. If, however, an unauthorized 
charge is made, the Electronic Fund Transfer 
Act protects users as long as the claim is 
made promptly, generally within two days.
If you use your smartphone to make 
purchases, follow this advice from the security 
experts:
• Use a password on your phone.
• Select a payment app that requires you to 
enter a password to start the transaction.
• Choose a payment app that issues a ­receipt 
so that you can verify every purchase.
• Be vigilant about checking mobile 
­transactions against monthly statements 
from the credit card company.
  Consider This: Should additional mer-
chants allow payments using mobile apps? 
Should merchants be required to pay when 
customers use payment apps, like they do 
when customers use credit cards? Why or 
why not? Where would you like to pay for 
transactions using your smartphone?

Chapter 4  Programs and Apps
Computer-Aided Design
Computer-aided design (CAD) software 
is a type of application that assists profes-
sionals and designers in creating engineer-
ing, architectural, and scientific designs 
and models. For example, engineers create 
design plans for vehicles and security sys-
tems. Architects design building structures 
and floor plans (Figure 4-17). Scientists 
design drawings of molecular structures.
Three-dimensional CAD programs allow 
designers to rotate designs of 3-D objects 
to view them from any angle. Some CAD 
software even can generate material lists for 
building designs.
Home and small business users work 
with less sophisticated design and modeling 
software. These applications usually contain 
thousands of predrawn plans that users can 
customize to meet their needs. For example, home design/landscaping software is an application 
that assists users with the design, remodeling, or improvement of a home, deck, or landscape.
Discover More: Visit this chapter’s free resources to learn more about CAD software.
Desktop Publishing
Desktop publishing software (DTP software) is an application that enables designers to 
­create sophisticated publications that contain text, graphics, and many colors. Professional 
DTP software is ideal for the production of high-quality color projects such as textbooks, 
corporate newsletters, marketing literature, product catalogs, and annual reports. Designers 
and graphic artists can print finished publications on a color printer, take them to a profes-
sional printer, or post them on the web in a format that can be viewed by those without  
DTP software.
Home and small business users create newsletters, brochures, flyers, advertisements, postcards, 
greeting cards, letterhead, business cards, banners, calendars, logos, and webpages using personal 
DTP software (Figure 4-18). Although 
many word processing programs include 
DTP features, home and small business 
users often prefer to create DTP proj-
ects using DTP software because of its 
enhanced features. These programs typi-
cally guide you through the development 
of a project by asking a series of questions. 
Then, you can print a finished publication 
on a color printer or post it on the web.
Many personal DTP programs also 
include paint/image editing software and 
photo editing and photo management 
software (discussed next), enabling users to 
embellish their publications with images.

resources to learn more about professional 
and personal DTP software.

Paint/Image Editing
Graphic artists, multimedia professionals, technical illustrators, and desktop publishers use paint 
software and image editing software to create and modify graphics, such as those used in DTP proj-
ects and webpages. Paint software, also called illustration software, is an application that allows users 
to draw pictures, shapes, and other graphics with various on-screen tools, such as a pen, brush, eye-
dropper, and paint bucket. Image editing software is an application that provides the capabilities 
of paint software and also includes the capability to enhance and modify existing photos and images. 
Modifications can include 
­adjusting or enhancing image 
­colors, ­adding special effects 
such as shadows and glows, 
creating animations, and image 
stitching ­(combining multiple 
images into a larger image).
Paint/image editing software 
for the home or small business 
user provides an easy-to-use 
­interface; includes various 
simplified tools that allow you 
to draw pictures, shapes, and 
other images (Figure 4-19); and 
provides the ­capability of modi-
fying existing graphics and pho-
tos. These products also include 
many templates to assist you 
in adding images to projects, 
such as greeting cards, banners, 
calendars, signs, labels, business 
cards, and letterhead.

Photo Editing and Photo 
Management
Photo editing software is 
a type of image editing soft-
ware that allows users to edit 
and ­customize digital photos. 
With photo editing software, 
users can retouch photos, 
crop images, remove red-eye, 
erase blemishes, restore aged 
photos, add special effects, 
enhance image quality, change 
image shapes, color-correct 
images, straighten images, 
remove or rearrange objects in 
a photo, add layers, and more 
(Figure 4–20). Many applica-
tions also provide a means for 
creating digital photo albums.

Edit and Share Photos
When you take a photo using a digital 
­camera or smartphone, you sometimes may 
want to edit the photo to remove unwanted 
areas, correct imperfections, or change its 
file size. Many apps allow you to edit photos 
easily. Several are simple to use and do not 
require advanced photo ­editing experience. 
Before editing a photo, you first should make 
a backup of the original photo. The table 
below describes common ways to edit photos 
using a photo editing app.
After you have edited a photo to your 
satisfaction, you may want to share the 
photo with others. Many mobile devices, 
such as smartphones and tablets, as well 
as most photo editing apps, have built-in 
options that allow you to share photos. 
To share a photo on a mobile device or 
from within a photo editing app, follow 
these steps:
1.	 Open the photo to share.
2.	 Select the sharing option in the  
photo editing app or on the mobile  
device.
3.	 Choose the method by which to share 
the photo. Common ways to share 
photos include sending the photo as an 
email attachment, posting the photo to 
an online social network or photo shar-
ing site, and sending the photo as a 
­picture message to another mobile  
device.
  Consider This: Examine your digital 
camera or other mobile device with a camera 
feature. Which of the photo editing features 
discussed here does it have? Did you notice

Video and Audio Editing
Video editing software is an application that allows professionals to modify a segment of a 
video, called a clip. For example, users can reduce the length of a video clip, reorder a series of clips, 
or add special effects such as words that move across the screen. Video editing software typically 
includes audio editing capabilities. Audio editing software is an application that enables users to 
modify audio clips, produce studio-quality soundtracks, and add audio to video clips (Figure 4-21). 
Most television shows and movies are created or enhanced using video and audio editing software.
Many home users work with easy-to-use video and audio editing software, which is much simpler 
to use than its professional counterpart, for small-scale movie making projects. With these pro-
grams, home users can edit home movies, add music or other sounds to the video, and share their 
movies on the web. Some operating systems include video editing and audio editing applications.

Ethics & Issues 4-3
Is It Ethical to Alter Digital Photos?
Many commercial artists, ­photojournalists, 
and creators of magazine covers and 
­billboards use photo editing software to 
alter digital photos. Artists use photo ­editing 
software to enhance digital photos by 
changing colors, adding or removing objects, 
and more. When does photo manipulation 
become unethical?
In several high-profile cases, news sources 
published intentionally altered photos 
that misrepresented the facts, in one case 
publishing photos of an aging world leader 
edited to remove his hearing aid. One school 
received criticism when it altered necklines 
on yearbook photos to be more modest. 
Real estate agents on occasion have altered 
photos of homes for online listings or print 
brochures. Also making news are celebrity or 
model photos that artists retouch to change 
their physical appearance.
The National Press Photographers 
Association expresses reservations about 
digital altering and subscribes to the 
following belief: “As [photo]journalists 
we believe the guiding principle of our 
profession is accuracy; therefore, we believe 
it is wrong to alter the content of a photo 
in any way ... that deceives the public.” 
Yet, some insist that the extent to which a 
photo “deceives the public” is in the eye of 
the beholder. Many differentiate between 
technical manipulation to improve photo 
quality and an intent to deceive. Some 
governments are attempting to legislate 
photo manipulation. One country banned a 
magazine in which a celebrity’s appearance 
appeared visibly altered. Some celebrities 
refuse to allow airbrushing or other 
manipulation of photos of them.
Consider This: Is it ethical to alter 
digital photos? Why or why not? Does 
the answer depend on the reason for the 
alteration, the extent of the alteration, or 
some other factor? Should magazines stop 
­altering pictures of people to change their 
­appearance? Why or why not?

Multimedia and Website Authoring
Multimedia authoring software allows users to combine text, graphics, audio, video, and 
­animation in an interactive application (Figure 4-22). With this software, users control the 
placement of text and images and the duration of sounds, video, and animation. Once created, 
multimedia presentations often take the form of interactive computer-based presentations or web-
based presentations designed to facilitate learning, demonstrate product functionality, and elicit 
direct user participation. Training centers, educational institutions, and online magazine publish-
ers use multimedia authoring software to develop interactive applications. These applications may 
be distributed on an optical disc, over a local area network, or via the Internet as web apps.
Website authoring software helps users of all skill levels create related webpages that 
include graphics, video, audio, animation, special effects with interactive content, and blog posts. 
In addition, many website authoring programs allow users to organize, manage, and maintain 
websites. Website authoring software often has capabilities of multimedia authoring software.
Consider This
What is computer-based or web-based training?
Computer-based training (CBT   ) is a type of education in which students learn by using and completing exercises 
with instructional software. Web-based training (WBT   ) is a type of CBT that uses Internet technology to deliver 
the training. CBT and WBT typically consist of self-directed, self-paced instruction about a topic so that the user 
becomes actively involved in the learning process instead of being a passive recipient of information. Beginning 
athletes use CBT programs to learn the intricacies of participating in a sport. The military and airlines use CBT 
simulations to train pilots to fly in various conditions and environments. WBT is popular in business, industry, and 
schools for teaching new skills or enhancing existing skills of employees, teachers, and students.

rize, tag, organize, and rank 
the media posted by you, your 
friends, and your contacts.
Streaming Audio and Video
Podcasts, video blogs, clips or episodes from a 
­television show, or even entire movies are available 
through a variety of streaming media web and mobile 
apps. Some services are available only with member-
ship, and may charge a monthly fee. Others are free, but 
include ads. Streaming media enables you to view and lis-
ten to content without downloading it to your computer 
or device, saving valuable disc or media storage space.
Gaming
Game web and mobile apps often offer a social 
­component, enabling you to chat within the game envi-
ronment, find friends who play the same game apps, and 
post your scores on social media. Word, puzzle, and board 
games are just some examples of apps you can play by 
yourself or with friends or others using the same apps.
News, Sports, and Weather
Many apps provide access to the latest news, ­stories, 
current events, sports scores, sporting events, and 
weather forecasts. Some of these mobile apps use GPS 
technology to provide current or customized informa-
tion based on the location of your mobile device. You 
also can configure these apps to deliver text messages 
and other types of alerts to your device when certain 
events occur, such as when a football team scores a 
touchdown or when severe weather is near.
Mapping
Using your mobile device’s GPS capability, you can 
use mapping mobile apps to obtain directions, maps, 
and recommendations for restaurants or other points of 
interest based on your current location. Some mapping 
apps even help you to locate friends based on their GPS 
signals (if they enable you to do so). Others allow you 
to share your current location on social media using a 
check-in feature. Web apps help you decide on a route, 
print directions or a map, and even find amenities along 
your route, such as public rest stops or restaurants.
Health and Fitness
Losing weight, training for a race, or following a 
­low-calorie diet are some uses of health and fitness apps. 
Using a mobile device 
as a pedometer or 
GPS receiver can help 
you count your steps 
or create a map of 
a route you run and 
then update your pro-
file with the data it 
tracked. You can use 
corresponding web 
apps to chart and 
analyze your progress, 
schedule your next 
workout, or deter-
mine the next steps 
to reach your goals. These apps also can help plan your 
meals and track the nutritional value of food you consume.
Academic
If you need to study terms or topics, flash card apps 
can provide reinforcement. This book‘s premium ­content 
for example, has an accompanying Flash Cards app 
designed to improve your retention of chapter key terms. 
Schools often subscribe to educational apps that provide 
students with games, quizzes, and lessons about course 
topics. Using these apps, teachers can keep track of stu-
dents’ progress and pinpoint areas where they may need 
extra help. You also can access complete college or high 
school courses and take advantage of free or fee-based 
digital content provided by publishers and teachers.

Security Tools
To protect your computers and mobile 
devices, you can use one or more security 
tools. Security tools include personal firewalls, 
antivirus programs, malware removers, and 
Internet filters. Although some of these tools 
are included with the operating system, you 
also can purchase stand-alone programs that 
offer improvements or added functionality.
Personal Firewall
A personal firewall is a security tool that 
detects and protects a personal computer 
and its data from unauthorized intrusions 
(Figure 4-24). Personal firewalls constantly 
monitor all transmissions to and from a 
computer or mobile device and may inform 
a user of attempted intrusions. When con-
nected to the Internet, your computer or 
mobile device is vulnerable to attacks from 
Ethics & Issues 4-4
Should Your Email Provider Be Allowed 
to Read or Scan Your Email?
When using any email program or service, 
you expect the app to scan incoming and 
outgoing mail to prevent the spread of mal-
ware. One web-based email service recently 
released a service update that includes 
automatic scanning of all email messages 
in order to provide targeted advertisements. 
Privacy experts point out that the scan 
includes all email messages sent or received, 
whether or not both the sender and recipi-
ent subscribe to the service.
Ad-supported web services, including 
email, often collect information in your 
profile, as well as your search results and 
other Internet activity. When you agree to 
use these services, you give consent to this 
type of monitoring. In this case, the extent 
of the monitoring exceeds the policies of 
other web-based services. In a court filing, 
one email provider stated that users of 
web-based services have no “reasonable 
expectation” of privacy with respect to the 
content of email messages.
A further complication to this instance is 
that many educational institutions use this 
service for email, collaboration software, and 
more. The service admits to collecting data 
from students, even when the school has 
opted out of ad displays. Laws are unclear 
whether collecting student data is legal. 
Several schools have joined to create a class-
action lawsuit against the provider. Many 
argue that collection of student data, which 
could include grades received and more, is 
a violation of the Family Educational Rights 
and Privacy Act (FERPA). Although FERPA 
predates cloud-based Internet services, 
it states that “schools must have written 
permission from the parent or eligible 
student in order to release any information 
from a student's education record.”
Consider This: Should an email service 
provider disclose data collection practices? 
Why or why not? Is it ethical for an email 
provider to scan email sent by a nonsub-
scriber? Why or why not? Is collecting 
student data a violation of FERPA? Why or 
why not?

Mini Feature 4-3: Viruses and Malware
A computer virus is a potentially damaging program that affects a computer or device ­negatively 
by altering the way it works. This occurs without the user’s knowledge or permission. Once the 
virus is in a computer or device, it can spread and may damage your files, programs and apps, and 
operating system. Read Mini Feature 4-3 to learn more about viruses and other malware.
Viruses and Malware
Viruses do not generate by chance. The programmer of 
a virus, known as a virus author, intentionally writes a 
virus program. Writing a virus program usually requires 
significant programming skills. The virus author ensures 
the virus can replicate itself, conceal itself, monitor for 
certain events, and then deliver its payload. A payload 
is the destructive event or prank the virus delivers. 
Viruses can infect all types of computers and devices. 
Most variations of viruses have two phases involved in 
their execution: infection and delivery.
The first step in the infection phase is activation of 
the virus. The most common way viruses spread is by 
users running infected programs or apps. During the 
infection phase, viruses typically perform one or more 
of the following actions:
1.	 First, a virus replicates by attaching itself to program 
files. A macro virus hides in a macro, which is a 
standard feature of many productivity applications, 
such as word processing and spreadsheet apps.  
A boot sector virus targets the computer’s start-up 
files. A file virus attaches itself to program files. The 
next time an infected program or app is run, the 
virus executes and infects the computer or device.
2. Viruses conceal themselves to avoid detection. A 
stealth virus disguises itself by hiding in fake code 
sections, which it inserts within working code in a 
file. A polymorphic virus actually changes its code as 
it delivers the infection.
3.	 Finally, viruses watch for a certain condition or event 
and activate when that condition or event occurs. 
The event might be starting the computer or device, 
or reaching a date on the system clock. A logic 
bomb activates when it detects a specific condition 
(say, a name deleted from the employee list). A time 
bomb is a logic bomb that activates on a particular 
date or time. If the triggering condition does not 
exist, the virus simply replicates.
During the delivery phase, the virus unleashes 
its payload, which might be a harmless prank that 
displays a meaningless message — or it might be 
destructive, corrupting or deleting data and files. 
The most dangerous viruses do not have an obvious 
payload. Instead, they quietly modify files. One way 
antivirus software detects computer viruses is by 
monitoring files for unknown changes.
In addition to viruses, other malware includes 
worms, trojan horse programs, and rootkits.
• A worm resides in active memory and replicates itself 
over a network to infect computers and devices, using 
up system resources and possibly shutting down the 
system.
• A trojan horse is a destructive program disguised as 
a real program, such as a screen saver. When a user 
runs a seemingly innocent program, a trojan horse 
hiding inside can capture information, such as user 
names and passwords, from your computer or enable 
someone to control your computer remotely. Unlike 
viruses, trojan horses do not replicate themselves.
• A rootkit is a program that easily can hide and allow 
someone to take full control of your computer from 
a remote location, often for nefarious purposes. 
For example, a rootkit can hide in a folder on your 
computer. The folder appears empty because the 
rootkit has instructed your computer not to display 
the contents of the folder. Rootkits can be very 
dangerous and often require special software to 
detect and remove.

Antivirus Programs
To protect a computer from virus attacks, users should install an antivirus program and keep 
it updated by purchasing revisions or upgrades to the software. An antivirus program protects 
a computer against viruses by identifying and removing any computer viruses found in memory, 
on storage media, or on incoming files (Figure 4-25). Antivirus programs scan for programs that 
attempt to modify a computer’s start-up files, the operating system, and other programs that 
normally are read from but not modified. In addition, many antivirus programs automatically 
scan files downloaded from the web, email attachments, opened files, and all types of removable 
media inserted in the computer or mobile device.
If an antivirus program identifies an infected file, it attempts to remove the malware. If 
the antivirus program cannot remove the infection, it often quarantines the infected file. 
A quarantine is a separate area of a 
hard drive that holds the infected 
file until the infection can be 
removed. This step ensures other 
files will not become infected. 
Quarantined files remain on your 
computer or mobile device until you 
delete them or restore them.
Most antivirus programs also 
include protection against other 
­malware, such as worms, trojan 
horses, and spyware. When you pur-
chase a new computer, it may include 
a trial version of antivirus software. 
Many email servers also have anti-
virus programs installed to check 
incoming and outgoing email mes-
sages for viruses and other malware. 
Read Secure IT 4-4 for tips about 
­recognizing virus hoaxes.
Studies show that malware can infect an 
unprotected computer within minutes after connecting 
to the Internet. Due to the increasing threat of viruses 
attacking your computer, it is more important than 
ever to protect your computer from viruses and other 
malware. Secure IT 1-2 in Chapter 1 lists steps you can 
follow to protect your computer from a virus infection.

Spyware, Adware, and Other Malware Removers
Spyware is a type of program placed on a computer or mobile device without the user’s ­knowledge 
that secretly collects information about the user and then communicates the information it ­collects 
to some outside source while the user is online. Some vendors or employers use spyware to collect 
information about program usage or employees. Internet advertising firms often ­collect ­information 
about users’ web browsing habits. Spyware can enter your computer when you install a new 
­program, through a graphic on a webpage or in an email message, or through malware.
Adware is a type of program that displays an online advertisement in a banner or pop-up or 
pop-under window on webpages, email messages, or other Internet services. Sometimes, Internet 
advertising firms hide spyware in adware.
A spyware remover is a type of program that detects and deletes spyware and similar pro-
grams. An adware remover is a program that detects and deletes adware. Malware removers 
detect and delete spyware, adware, and other malware. Read Secure IT 4-5 for measures you can 
take to protect your mobile device from malware.

Recognizing Virus Hoaxes
Computer hoaxes spread across the Internet 
in record time and often are the source of 
urban legends. These hoaxes take several 
forms and often disappear for months or 
years at a time, only to resurface some time 
later.
Most alarming to some users are the 
computer virus hoaxes that warn the 
computer is infected and needs immediate 
attention. Some warnings state the problem 
is so severe that the computer or device will 
explode or that the entire hard drive will be 
erased in a matter of seconds. The warnings 
cite prominent companies, such as Microsoft 
and Intel Security. These messages claim to 
offer a solution to the problem, generally 
requesting a fee for a program to download. 
Snopes.com compiles these hoaxes and 
describes their sources and histories.
In reality, these fake messages are 
generated by unscrupulous scammers preying 
upon gullible people who panic and follow 
the directions in the message. These users 
divulge credit card information and then often 
download files riddled with viruses.
If you receive one of these virus hoaxes, 
never respond to the message. Instead, delete 
it. Most importantly, never forward it to an 
unsuspecting friend or coworker. If you receive 
the virus hoax from someone you know, send 
him or her a separate email message with 
information about the hoax.
  Consider This: Have you ever received a 
virus hoax? If so, what action did you take?

How do antivirus programs detect viruses?
Many antivirus programs identify viruses by looking for virus signatures. A virus signature, also called a virus 
definition, is a known specific pattern of virus code. Computer users should update their antivirus program’s 
signature files regularly. This extremely important activity allows the antivirus program to protect against viruses 
written since the antivirus program was released and/or its last update. Most antivirus programs contain an 
automatic update feature or regularly prompts users to download the updated virus signatures, usually at least 
once a week. The vendor usually provides this service to registered users at no cost for a specified time.

Are cookies spyware?
A cookie is a small text file that a web server stores on your computer. Cookie files typically contain data 
about you, such as your user name, viewing preferences, or shopping cart contents. Cookies are not considered 
­spyware because website programmers do not attempt to conceal the cookies.

Internet Filters
Filters are programs that remove or block certain items from being displayed. Four widely 
used Internet filters are anti-spam programs, web filters, phishing filters, and pop-up and 
­pop-under blockers.
Anti-Spam Programs  Spam is an unsolicited email message or posting sent to many 
­recipients or forums at once. Spam is considered Internet junk mail. The content of spam 
ranges from selling a product or service, to promoting a business opportunity, to advertising 
offensive material. Spam also may contain links or attachments that contain malware.
An anti-spam program is a filtering program that attempts to remove spam before it reaches 
your inbox or forum. If your email program does not filter spam, many anti-spam programs are 
available at no cost on the web. ISPs often filter spam as a service for their subscribers.
Web Filters  Web filtering software is a program 
that restricts access to certain material on the web. 
Some restrict access to specific websites; others 
filter websites that use certain words or phrases. 
Many businesses use web filtering software to limit 
employee’s web access. Some schools, libraries, 
and parents use this software to restrict access to 
­websites that are not ­educational.
Phishing Filters  Phishing is a scam in which a 
­perpetrator sends an official looking email mes-
sage that attempts to obtain your personal and/or 
financial information (Figure 4-26). Some phishing 
messages ask you to reply with your information; 
others direct you to a phony website or a pop-up 
or ­pop-under window that looks like a legitimate 
­website, which then ­collects your ­information.
A phishing filter is a program that warns or 
blocks you from potentially fraudulent or ­suspicious 
­websites. Some browsers include phishing filters.

Malware Risks to Mobile Devices
Practically every smartphone is vulnerable to 
hacking attacks. Threats to smartphones and 
mobile devices are growing in record num-
bers due to the rising popularity of these 
products and the variety of marketplace 
sources for downloading apps.
Often the malware is disguised as a 
popular app and steals personal and sensitive 
information and phone numbers. It also can 
allow hackers to control the mobile device 
from remote locations. Once the hacker takes 
over the device, all the information on it is 
available, including passwords and account 
numbers. One of the fastest growing threats 
within mobile apps is toll fraud malware, 
which is a malicious mobile app that uses 
a variety of fraudulent schemes to charge 
unsuspecting users for premium messaging 
services.
Smartphone users can take several 
precautions to guard against malware threats. 
They include:
• Read reviews of apps and the companies 
that create them before downloading the 
apps to your mobile device.
• Use mobile malware and antivirus protection.
• Turn off location-based apps that track your 
movements.
• Do not connect to unknown wireless 
networks.
• Keep the operating system up to date.
• Enable the screen lock feature, and use a 
strong password to unlock the device.
• Reset the mobile device before selling or 
trading it in.
• Practice the same safe computing 
­measures you take on your home  
computer.

File, Disk, and System Management Tools
To perform maintenance-type tasks related to managing a computer, its devices, or its programs, 
you can use one or more file, disk, and system management tools. Functions provided by these 
tools include the following: managing files, searching, viewing images, uninstalling software, 
cleaning up disks, defragmenting disks, setting up screen savers, compressing files, maintaining 
a personal computer, and backing up files and disks. Although some of these tools are included 
with the operating system, you also can purchase stand-alone programs that offer improvements 
or added functionality.
File Manager
A file manager is a tool that performs functions related to file management. Some of the file 
management functions that a file manager performs are displaying a list of files on a storage 
medium (Figure 4-27); organizing files in folders; and copying, renaming, deleting, moving, and 
sorting files. A folder is a specific named location on a storage medium that contains related 
files. Operating systems typically include a file manager.

Search
A search tool is a program, usually included with an operating ­system, 
that attempts to locate a file, contact, calendar event, app or any other item 
stored on your computer or mobile device based on criteria you specify 
(Figure 4-28). The criteria could be a word(s), date, location, and other simi-
lar properties. Search tools can look through documents, photos, music, cal-
endars, contacts, and other items on your computer or mobile device and/or 
on the Internet, combining search results in a single location.
Search tools typically use an index to assist with locat-
ing items quickly. An index stores a variety of information 
about a file, including its name, date created, date modified, 
author name, and so on. When you enter search criteria, instead of look-
ing through every file and folder on the storage medium, the search tool 
looks through the index first to find a match. Each entry in the index 
contains a link to the actual file on the storage media for easy retrieval.
Image Viewer
An image viewer is a tool that allows users to display, copy, and print 
the contents of a graphics file, such as a photo (Figure 4-29). With an 
image viewer, users can see images without having to open them in a 
paint or image editing program. Many image viewers include some photo 
editing capabilities. Most operating systems include an image viewer.

Uninstaller
An uninstaller is a tool that removes a program, as well as any ­associated entries in the system 
files. When you install a program, the operating system records the information it uses to run 
the software in the system files. The uninstaller deletes files and folders from the hard drive, as 
well as removes program entries from the system files. Read How To 4-4 for instructions about 
uninstalling ­programs and removing apps from your computers and mobile devices.

Disk Cleanup
A disk cleanup tool searches for and removes unnecessary files (Figure 4-30). Unnecessary 
files may include downloaded program files, temporary Internet files, deleted files, and unused 
program files. Operating systems usually include a disk cleanup tool.
Uninstall a Program or Remove an App
You may choose to uninstall a program 
or remove an app from your computer or 
mobile device for a variety of reasons. For

How To 4-4
Consider This
Can you use a file manager to delete a program?
If an uninstaller exists and you remove software from a computer by deleting the files and folders associated 
with the program without running the uninstaller, the system file entries might not be updated. This may cause 
the operating system to display error messages when you start the computer.

Disk Defragmenter
A disk defragmenter is a tool that reorganizes the files and unused space on a computer’s 
hard disk so that the operating system accesses data more quickly and programs run faster. 
When an operating system stores data on a disk, it places the data in the first available sector 
(a storage location on a disk in the shape of an arc). The operating system attempts to place data 
in sectors that are contiguous (next to each other), but this is not always possible. When the 
contents of a file are scattered across two or more noncontiguous sectors, the file is fragmented.
Fragmentation slows down file access and, thus, the performance of the entire computer. 
Defragmenting the disk, or reorganizing it so that the files are stored in contiguous sectors, 
solves this problem (Figure 4-31). Operating systems usually include a disk defragmenter.
Consider This
What is the purpose of a screen saver?
Screen savers originally were developed to prevent a problem called ghosting, in which images could be etched 
permanently on a monitor’s screen. Although ghosting is not as severe of a problem with today’s displays, man-
ufacturers continue to recommend that users install screen savers for this reason. Screen savers also are popular 
for security, business, and entertainment purposes. To secure a computer, users configure their screen saver to 
require a password to deactivate.

Defragmenting is 
necessary only on hard 
disks. You do not need 
to defragment an SSD 
(solid-state drive).
Screen Saver
A screen saver is a tool that causes a display device’s screen to show a moving image or blank 
screen if no keyboard or mouse activity occurs for a specified time. When you press a key on the 
keyboard, tap the screen, or move the mouse, the screen saver disappears and the screen returns 
to the previous state.

File Compression
A file compression tool shrinks the size of a file(s). A compressed file takes up less storage 
space than the original file. Compressing files frees up room on the storage media. You may 
need to compress a file so that it will fit on a smaller storage medium, such as a USB flash drive. 
Attaching a compressed file to an email message, for example, reduces the time needed for file 
transmission. Uploading and downloading compressed files to and from the Internet reduces the 
file transmission time.
Compressed files sometimes are called zipped files. When you receive or download a ­compressed 
file, you must uncompress it. To uncompress (or unzip or expand) a file, you restore it to its original 
form. Some operating systems include file compression and ­uncompression capabilities.
Discover More: Visit this chapter’s free resources to learn more about file ­compression tools.
PC Maintenance
A PC maintenance tool is a program that identifies and fixes operating system problems, 
detects and repairs drive problems, and includes the capability of improving a computer’s per-
formance. Additionally, some personal computer maintenance utilities continuously monitor a 
computer while you use it to identify and repair problems before they occur.
Backup and Restore
A backup tool allows users to copy, or back up, selected files or the contents of an entire ­storage 
medium to another storage location, such as another hard drive, optical disc, USB flash drive, or 
cloud storage (Figure 4-32). During the backup process, the backup tool monitors progress and 
alerts you if it needs additional media, such as another disc. Many backup programs compress files 
during the backup process. By compressing the files, the backup program requires less storage space 
for the backup files than for the original files.
Because they are compressed, you usually cannot use backup files in their backed up form. In 
the event you need to use a backup file, a restore tool reverses the process and returns backed 
up files to their original form. Backup tools work with a restore tool. You should back up files and 
disks regularly in the event your originals are lost, damaged, or destroyed.

Entertainment
Do you wonder how music on the radio 
sounds so perfectly in tune, how animated 
motion pictures are created, or how one 
controls and technology lighting during a con-
cert? Not only does the entertainment industry 
rely on computers and technology to advertise 
and sell their services, computers also assist 
in other aspects, including audio and video 
composition, lighting control, ­computerized 
animation, and computer gaming.
Entertainment websites provide music and 
movies you can purchase and download to 
your computer or mobile device; live news 
broadcasts, performances, and sporting 
events; games you can play with other 
online users; and much more.
As early as 1951, computers were used 
to record and play music. Today, computers 
play a much larger role in the music industry. 
For example, if you are listening to a song 
on the radio and notice that not one note 
is out of tune, it is possible that a program 
or app was used to change individual notes 
without altering the rest of the song.
Many years ago, creating cartoons or 
animated motion pictures was an extremely 
time-consuming task because artists were 
responsible for sketching thousands of 
drawings by hand. Currently, artists use 
computers to create these drawings in a 
fraction of the time, which significantly 
reduces the time and cost of development. 
Technology also is used in other areas of 
movie production to add visual effects.
Technology also is used in the gaming 
industry. While some game developers 
create games from scratch, others might use 
game engines that simplify the development 
process. For example, LucasArts created the 
GrimE game engine, which is designed to 
create adventure games.
During a concert, lighting technicians 
use computer programs to control lights 
by turning them off and on, changing 
their color, or changing their placement 
at specified intervals. In fact, once a 
performance begins, the technicians 
often merely are standing by, monitoring 
the computer as it performs most of the 
work. A significant amount of time and 
effort, however, is required to program 
the computer to execute its required tasks 
during a live show.
The next time you listen to a song, watch 
a movie, play a game, or attend a concert, 
think about the role technology plays in 
contributing to your entertainment.
  Consider This: How else might 
­computers and technology be used in the 
entertainment industry?

Obtain Help about Programs and Apps
Multiple ways are provided to obtain help while using the 
programs and apps on a computer or mobile device. The 
program or app developer usually includes a Help feature 
in the program and/or online. In addition, third parties 
often post resources online that can provide further assis-
tance. The following steps describe how to obtain help 
about various programs and apps using various methods.

you with help for the operating system installed  
on your computer? Why do you consider them  
reputable?
2	 Compress/Uncompress Files and Folders
You may want to compress files if your hard drive 
is running out of available space. While the operat-
ing system may be able to compress some files by 50 
percent or more, other files’ sizes may not decrease 
significantly when they are compressed. Compressed 
files typically are stored by default in a file with a 
.zip file extension. The following steps describe how 
to compress a file or folder and then uncompress 
(expand or extract) the compressed file.
a. Press and hold or right-click the file(s) or 
folders you wish to compress to display a 
shortcut menu.
b. Tap or click the option to compress the file(s) or

3	 View Current Virus Threats
One important way to protect your computer or 
mobile device from viruses is to be aware of current 
threats. Several websites exist that not only provide 
a list of current virus threats but also describe how 
best to protect your computer or mobile device from 
these threats. As new virus threats are introduced, it 
is important to make sure your antivirus program is 
updated and running properly. The following steps 
describe how to view a list of current virus threats.
a. Run a browser and then navigate to a search engine 
of your choice.
b. Perform a search for websites that display current 
virus threats.
c. Review the search results and visit at least two 
websites that display current virus threats.
d. View the list of virus threats on each of these websites.

4	 Back Up Your Computer
Backing up your computer is an important way to 
protect your programs, apps, and data from loss. The 
frequency at which people back up their computers can 
vary. For instance, if you create and modify a lot of files 
on your computer, you may choose to back up your 
computer frequently. If you rarely use your computer 
or primarily use your computer for answering email 
messages and browsing the web, you might not back up 
your computer as often. The following steps guide you 
through the process of backing up a computer.
a. Decide which backup program you wish to use. 
Some operating systems have built-in tools you 
can use to back up a computer, or you can install a 
third-party program.
b. Run the program you will use to back up the 
computer.
c. If necessary, connect the storage device, such as 
an external hard drive, you will use to store the 
backup. If you plan to store the backup on an 
optical disc or another hard drive that already 
is installed, you will not need to connect an 
additional storage device.
d. Make sure the storage medium has enough 
available space for the backed up files. If you are 
storing the backup on optical discs, make sure you 
have enough optical discs for the backup.
e. Select the type of backup (full, incremental, 
differential, or selective) you wish to perform.
f. If you are performing a selective backup, choose 
the files, programs, and apps you wish to include in 
the backup.
g. Run the backup. The backup process may take up 
to several hours, depending on the number of files 
you are including in the backup.
h. If you are storing the backup on optical discs, the 
backup program may prompt you to insert new, 
blank optical discs throughout the backup process.

5	 Share Your Online Calendar
If you keep track of your meetings, 
appointments, and other obligations using 
an online calendar, you might want to 
share your calendar with others so that 
they know when you are available. For 
instance, you might want to share your 
calendar with fellow employees so that 
they can verify your availability before 
scheduling meetings. Your family mem-
bers may share their calendars with one 
another so that it is easier to plan family 
events when everyone is available. The 
following steps describe how to share your online 
calendar.
a. If necessary, run a browser and navigate to an 
online calendar.
b.  Display the calendar’s settings.
c.  Select the option to display the calendar’s 
sharing settings.
d.  Specify with whom you want to share the 
calendar.
e.  Determine your sharing settings for each 
person. For example, you may select whether 
a person only can view your calendar or view 
and edit your calendar. You also can select the 
level of detail you want to share with others. 
For example, you can share the times you 
are free or busy, or you can share the specific 
details for each appointment.
f.  If necessary, repeat the two previous steps 
for each additional person with whom you 
wish to share the calendar.
g.  Save the settings.
h.  Verify the people with whom you shared the 
calendar are able to access the calendar.
Exercises
1.  For what other reasons might you share 
your calendar?
2. In addition to the steps outlined previously, in  
what other ways can you share your calendar  
online?
3. In addition to sharing online calendars, is it possible 
to share calendars you create in programs such as 
Microsoft Outlook? If so, how?

Making Use of the Web 
Website Creation and Management
Retailers and organizations realize the importance of 
­having a website to promote their goods and services. 
An online presence helps a business connect with 
an audience and ultimately builds trust and respect. 
Innovative and dynamic websites deliver informa-
tion to current and potential customers and clients. 
Creating these websites requires a methodology of 
planning, designing, creating, hosting, and maintain-
ing. A business must identify the website’s purpose, 
demographics of the target audience, ­appropriate 
­content and functionality, page layout, and ­usability. 
Once the website is implemented, it must be 
­monitored to determine usage. Logs list the number of 
visitors, the browsers they used, and usage patterns. In 
addition, the website should be maintained to update 
content and features.
Products are available to help build and manage a 
website. Most offer well-designed templates that can 
be customized to accommodate specific personal and 
business needs. They can include calendars, photos, 
videos, maps, and blogs. Some of these design and 
management tools, such as those offered on Google 
Sites, are available at no cost, while others require 
fees for specific features, such as technical support or 
exclusive designs.
Research This: Visit Google Sites and two other 
online content management systems for building web-
sites. Compare these web apps by creating a table using 
these headings: Name, Number of Templates, Price, 
Maximum Storage, Customer Support, and ­Features. 
The Features column could include the ­availability 
of items such as customizable color schemes, 
­e-commerce, drag and drop, website logs and analytics, 
and mobile editing. Which website builder would you 
choose if you were creating a website? Why?

Social Media
Gaming via social media has seen explosive growth 
in recent years, especially among adult males. 
Exponential gaming growth has spawned companion 
businesses that facilitate and manage the gaming expe-
rience. Some mobile and desktop apps provide gamers 
a portal for tracking all their online gaming results in 
a central location that can be shared with friends and 
others with similar game interests. These apps inte-
grate with the major Internet messaging services, have 
personalized news feeds, and incorporate a “sugges-
tion” engine for new game discoveries. Many gaming 
blogs offer game tricks, work-arounds, and hidden fea-
tures. Beginning gamers can engage their minds dur-
ing downtime and expand their circle of online friends.
Research This: Visit at least 
two online social networks 
for gamers. How many games 
are shown? Which topics 
are featured in community 
discussions and live chats? 
Are rewards available? If so, 
what are they? Which online 
leagues and tournaments 
are offered? What are some 
of the latest news articles 
about specific games and 
the gaming industry? Have 
you participated in gaming 
online social networks? If so, 
which ones?
Instructions: Use a search engine or another search tool to locate the information requested or answers to questions presented in the exercises. 
Describe your findings, along with the search term(s) you used and your web source(s), in the format requested by your instructor (brief report, 
presentation, discussion, blog post, video, or other means).

Search Skills 
Narrowing Your Search Results
One strategy for narrowing search results is to 
specify what you are or are not looking for as part of 
your search text. Precede words with a plus sign (+) 
if you want to ensure that they appear in your search 
results, and precede a word with a minus sign (-) if 
you want to exclude that word from search results. 
For example, typing the phrase, windows +microsoft,  
will search for information about the operating 
­system; typing the phrase, windows –microsoft, also 
will find information about windows that are made 
of glass.
Include the keyword, and, between words or phrases 
in search text if you want search results to include 
both words or phrases, or the keyword, or, if search 
results containing either word or phrase are accept-
able. Group terms with parentheses to clarify search 
text. For example, type the phrase, iPhone and "Steve 
Jobs" (including the quotation marks), to search for 
articles about the inventor of the iPhone. Type the 
phrase, (iPhone or iPad) and "Steve Jobs" (including 
the parentheses and quotation marks), to search for 
information about iPhone or iPad devices that also 
mentions Steve Jobs.
Research This: Create search text using the­ 
­techniques described above or in previous Search 
Skills exercises, and type it in a search engine to 
­answer these questions. (1) What is an open source 
FTP ­application that has versions for both Windows 
and Mac? (2) Other than TurboTax, what are two 
examples of online tax preparation software? (3) Find 
reviews comparing Internet Explorer, Edge, Chrome, 
and Firefox browsers. (4) What are the more popular 
calendar ­management and task ­management apps on 
Google Play?

Security
Virus hoaxes are widespread and sometimes cause 
panic among Internet users. Secure IT 4-4 in this 
chapter gives advice on recognizing and avoiding virus 
hoaxes. Snopes.com provides further insight on the 
sources and variations of a wide variety of rumors, 
deceptions, and folklore.
Research This: Visit snopes.com and type the search 
text phrase, virus hoaxes & realities, in the Search box 
at the top of the page. Review the list of the more 
recent real (indicated by a green dot) and false (indi-
cated by a red dot) rumors circulating on the Internet. 
Which are the three newest actual warnings, and which 
are the three latest virus hoaxes? What harm is pre-
dicted to occur if a user downloads each of these real 
or false viruses or views a website laden with malware? 
What is the origin of the website’s name, Snopes?

Cloud Services 
Photo Editing (SaaS)
Online photo editing apps provide browser-based 
c­apabilities to modify digital images, and often contain 
many similar features as their desktop counterparts. 
They are an example of SaaS (software as a service), 
a service of cloud computing that 
provides access to software solutions 
accessed through a browser. In addi-
tion to drawing shapes, touching up 
colors, and adding filters to images, 
online photo editing apps allow 
users to access, store, and share their 
photos on the cloud. Online photo 
editing apps often include the ability 
to share photos with friends easily by 
sending a link, or posting the photo 
to online social networks.
Research This: (1) Use a search 
engine to research various online 
photo editing apps. Compare the features of two of 
them as you explore their capabilities. Summarize your 
findings in a table, regarding image formats you can 
import or save, sharing capabilities, special editing 
features, and ways to organize photos online. Which 
features take advantage of the fact that the app is cloud 
based? (2) If you have access to computers running 
two different operating systems, such as Windows and 
Mac, try running the photo editing app in a browser 
on both computers. What similarities and differences 
do you notice between the two ­versions?

Critical Thinking
Instructions: Evaluate the situations below, using personal experiences and one or more resources available to you (such as articles on the web or 
in print, blogs, podcasts, videos, television, user guides, other individuals, electronics or computer stores, etc.). Perform the tasks requested in each 
­exercise and share your deliverables in the format requested by your instructor (brief report, presentation, discussion, blog post, video, or other means).
The Critical Thinking exercises challenge your assessment and decision-making skills by 
­presenting real-world situations associated with chapter concepts. The Collaboration 
­exercise should be completed with a team.
1.	File, Disk, and System Management Tools 
You are the director of information technology at a 
company that frequently hires student interns. The 
interns tend to have limited experience with using file, 
disk, and system management tools. As part of your 
job, you lead workshops that teach the interns the 
many tasks and functions they can perform using  
these tools.
Do This: Choose three categories of tools, such as 
disk cleanup, PC maintenance, and file compression. 
Determine whether your computer’s operating system 
includes these tools. Use the web to research popular 
tools for each category, whether they can be pur-
chased separately or if they are available only as part 
of an operating system, and the costs for each tool. 
Choose one program from each category, and read 
user reviews and articles by industry experts. Describe 
situations where you would use each type of tool. 
Share any experiences you have with using the tools.
2.	Web and Mobile App Comparison  
You recently purchased a new smartphone and want  
to research mobile apps that also have accompanying 
web apps.
Do This: Choose three categories of apps, and find 
an example for each that has both a free web and 
mobile version. Read user reviews of each app, and 
search for articles by industry experts. Research any 
known safety risks for the apps. If you determine the 
app is safe, have access to the appropriate device, and 
would like to test the mobile app, you can download it 
to a smartphone or other mobile device. Try accessing 
the web app on a computer. Using your experience or 
research, note the differences in functionality between 
the web and mobile app. Is one or the other easier to 
use? Why or why not?
3.	Case Study 
Amateur Sports League You are the new manager 
for a nonprofit amateur soccer league. The league 
needs productivity software in order to keep track of 
participant and budget information and to prepare 
flyers. You prepare information about productivity 
software options to present to the board of 
directors.
Do This: Use the web to research popular word 
­processing, spreadsheet, and accounting software. 
Choose three programs from each category. List 
common features of each, find pricing information, 
and note any feedback or

4.	Educational Program and App Effectiveness  
The principal of the local elementary school has recommended that educational apps should play a major role in the 
learning process, believing that these apps enable students to learn at their own pace. Some enable teachers to track an 
individual student’s progress and understanding.
Do This: Form a three-member team and research the use of educational apps. Each member of your team should 
choose a different type of app, such as flash cards, testing, or CBT. List the advantages and disadvantages of using 
that type of app. If possible, download or access a free version of an educational app from each category and spend 
some time using it. Read user reviews of popular apps, and search for articles by industry experts. Would you recom-
mend using an app for educational purposes? Why or why not? Meet with your team, and discuss and compile your 
­findings.

Objectives
Digital Security Risks
Today, people rely on technology to create, store, and manage their critical information. Thus, 
it is important that computers and mobile devices, along with the data and programs they store, 
are accessible and available when needed. It also is crucial that users take measures to protect or 
safeguard their computers, mobile devices, data, and programs from loss, damage, and misuse. 
For example, organizations must ensure that sensitive data and information, such as credit 
records, employee and customer data, and purchase information, is secure. Home users must 
ensure that their credit card numbers are secure when they make online purchases.
A digital security risk is any event or action that could cause a loss of or damage to computer 
or mobile device hardware, software, data, information, or processing capability. The more com-
mon digital security risks include Internet and network attacks, unauthorized access and use, 
hardware theft, software theft, information theft, and system failure (Figure 5-1).
While some breaches to digital security are accidental, many are intentional. Some ­intruders 
do not disrupt a computer or device’s functionality; they merely access data, information, 
or programs on the computer or mobile device before signing out. Other intruders indicate 
some evidence of their presence either by leaving a message or by deliberately altering or 
­damaging data.
Cybercrime
An intentional breach to digital security often involves a deliberate act that is against the law. 
Any illegal act involving the use of a computer or related devices generally is referred to as a 
computer crime. The term cybercrime refers to online or Internet-based illegal acts such as 
distributing malicious software or committing identity theft. Software used by cybercriminals 
sometimes is called crimeware. Today, combating cybercrime is one of the FBI’s top priorities.

Chapter 5  Digital Security, Ethics, and Privacy
Perpetrators of cybercrime typically fall into one of these basic categories: hacker, cracker, 
script kiddie, corporate spy, unethical employee, cyberextortionist, and cyberterrorist.
• The term hacker, although originally a complimentary word for a computer enthusiast, now 
has a derogatory meaning and refers to someone who accesses a computer or network illegally. 
Some hackers claim the intent of their security breaches is to improve security.
• A cracker also is someone who accesses a computer or network illegally but has the intent of 
destroying data, stealing information, or other malicious action. Both hackers and crackers 
have advanced computer and network skills.
• A script kiddie has the same intent as a cracker but does not have the technical skills and 
knowledge. Script kiddies often use prewritten hacking and cracking programs to break into 
computers and networks.
• Some corporate spies have excellent computer and networking skills and are hired to break 
into a specific computer and steal its proprietary data and information, or to help identify 
security risks in their own organization. Unscrupulous companies hire corporate spies, a 
practice known as corporate espionage, to gain a competitive advantage.
• Unethical employees may break into their employers’ computers for a variety of reasons. 
Some simply want to exploit a security weakness. Others seek financial gains from selling 
confidential information. Disgruntled employees may want revenge.
• A cyberextortionist is someone who demands payment to stop an attack on an organization’s 
technology infrastructure. These perpetrators threaten to expose confidential information, 
exploit a security flaw, or launch an attack that will compromise the organization’s network — 
if they are not paid a sum of money.
• A cyberterrorist is someone who uses the Internet or network to destroy or damage 
computers for political reasons. The cyberterrorist might target the nation’s air traffic control 
system, electricity-generating companies, or a telecommunications infrastructure. The term, 
cyberwarfare, describes an attack whose goal ranges from disabling a government’s computer 
network to crippling a country. Cyberterrorism and cyberwarfare usually require a team of 
highly skilled individuals, millions of dollars, and several years of planning.
Read Ethics & Issues 5-1 to consider how cybercriminals should be punished. Some ­organizations 
hire individuals previously convicted of computer crimes to help identify security risks and imple-
ment safeguards because these individuals know how criminals attempt to breach security.

Ethics & Issues 5-1
How Should Cybercriminals Be Punished?
A hacker received a 10-year jail sentence for 
selling credit card information from several 
large corporations, costing one company 
approximately $200 million. In another 
case, a hacker accessed the personal online 
accounts of celebrities, as well as people 
he knew, and distributed revealing photos 
and information. He also received 10 years 
in jail, in part for the emotional distress his 
actions caused his victims. Do these sen-
tences seem too harsh? Some legal experts 
point out that the punishment given to 
some hackers is not in line with crimes of a  
violent nature.
In addition to the extent of the 
punishment, other issues surrounding 
cybercrime laws include whether an action is 
defamation or free speech and who should 
be punished, the hacker or those who were 
hacked. If a hacker’s actions damage the 
reputation of another via libel or slander, 
should the hacker be prosecuted under the 
defamation law or be protected under the 
First Amendment? A hacktivist, which is a 
type of hacker whose actions are politically 
or socially motivated, believes his or her 
actions should be protected under the First 
Amendment. Should companies whose 
systems have been breached be punished 
for their lax security? The Federal Trade 
Commission (FTC) has fined companies 
whose security flaws enabled hackers to 
access their systems.
Legislators have made efforts to define and 
prevent cybercrime, both with new laws and 
the expansion of existing laws. Cybercrime 
laws vary between states and countries, 
making it difficult to establish what is illegal. 
Determining who has jurisdiction over a case 
can create more legal hassles. For example, 
which area is responsible for determining 
punishment: where the victim(s) resides or 
where the criminal lives?
Consider This: Should hacktivism be 
punishable? Why or why not? Should 
­corporations be liable for damages caused 
by hackers? Why or why not? Should 
­hackers receive comparable punishment to 
violent criminals? Why or why not?

Internet and Network Attacks
Information transmitted over networks has a higher degree of security risk than information kept 
on an organization’s premises. In an organization, network administrators usually take ­measures to 
protect a network from security risks. On the Internet, where no central ­administrator is present, the 
security risk is greater. Internet and network attacks that ­jeopardize security include malware, botnets, 
denial of service attacks, back doors, and spoofing.
Malware
Recall that malware, short for malicious ­software, 
­consists of programs that act without a user’s knowl-
edge and deliberately alter the operations of com-
puters and mobile devices. Table 5-1 summarizes 
common types of malware, all of which have been dis-
cussed in previous chapters. Some malware contains 
characteristics in two or more classes. For example, a 
single threat could contain elements of a virus, worm, 
and trojan horse. 
Malware can deliver its payload, or destructive 
event or prank, on a computer or mobile device 
in a variety of ways, such as when a user opens an 
infected file, runs an infected program, ­connects an 
­unprotected computer or mobile device to a net-
work, or when a certain condition or event occurs, 
such as the computer’s clock changing to a specific 
date. A common way that computers and mobile 
devices become infected with viruses and other mal-
ware is through users opening infected email attach-
ments (Figure 5-2). Read Secure IT 5-1 to learn 
about how ­malware can affect online gaming.

Table 5-1  Common Types of Malware
Type
Description
Virus
A potentially damaging program that affects, or infects, 
a computer or mobile device negatively by altering the 
way the computer or device works without the user’s 
knowledge or permission.
Worm
A program that copies itself repeatedly, for example 
in memory or on a network, using up resources and 
possibly shutting down the computer, device, or network.
Trojan horse
A program that hides within or looks like a legitimate 
program. Unlike a virus or worm, a trojan horse does 
not replicate itself to other computers or devices.
Rootkit
A program that hides in a computer or mobile device 
and allows someone from a remote location to take full 
control of the computer or device.
Spyware
A program placed on a computer or mobile device without 
the user’s knowledge that secretly collects information 
about the user and then communicates the information it 
collects to some outside source while the user is online.
Adware
A program that displays an online advertisement in 
a banner, pop-up window, or pop-under window on 
webpages, email messages, or other Internet services.
Step 1
Unscrupulous programmers
create a virus program that 
deletes all ﬁles. They hide the 
virus in a word processing 
document and attach the 
document to an email 
message.
Step 2
They send the email message that contains 
the infected attachment to thousands of 
users around the world.
Step 3a
Some users open the attachment and their
computers become infected with the virus.
Step 3b
Other users do not recognize the name of the sender 
of the email message. These users do not open the 
email message — instead they immediately delete 
the email message and continue using their computers. 
These users’ computers are not infected with the virus.

Botnets
A botnet, or zombie army, is a group of compromised computers or mobile devices connected 
to a network, such as the Internet, that are used to attack other networks, usually for nefari-
ous purposes. A compromised computer or device, known as a zombie, is one whose owner is 
unaware the computer or device is being controlled remotely by an outsider.
A bot is a program that performs a repetitive task on a network. Cybercriminals install 
­malicious bots on unprotected computers and devices to create a botnet. The perpetrator 
then uses the botnet to send spam via email, spread viruses and other malware, or commit a 
­distributed denial of service attack (discussed in the next section).
Consider This
What if you cannot remove malware?
In extreme cases, in order to remove malware from a computer or mobile device, you may need to erase, or 
reformat, an infected computer’s hard drive, or reset a mobile device to its factory settings. For this reason, it is 
critical you have uninfected (clean) backups of all files. Consider creating recovery media when you purchase a new 
computer, and be sure to keep all installation media in the event you need to reinstall the computer’s operating 
system and your apps. Seek advice from a technology specialist before performing a format or reformat instruction 
on your media.

Play It Safe to Avoid Online 
Gaming Risks
Gamers often understand general security 
issues regarding online behavior, but they 
may not be aware of a different set of tech-
nology and social risks they may encounter 
as they interact in the online world. Anyone 
experiencing the joys of playing games 
online or playing games with others through 
online services should realize that thieves 
and hackers lurking behind the scenes may 
take advantage of security holes and vulner-
abilities that can turn a gaming session into 
a nightmare.
Viruses, worms, and malware can be hidden 
in downloaded game files, mobile apps, 
email message attachments, and messaging 
software. In addition, messages on online 
social networks may encourage gamers to visit 
fraudulent websites filled with malware. If the 
game requires a connection to the Internet, 
then any computer connected to the game’s 
server is subject to security cyberthreats. 
Thieves can take control of a remote 
computer that does not have a high level 
of security protection and use it to control 
other computers, or they could break into 
the computer and install malware to discover 
personal information.
Malicious users know that the gaming 
community uses social media intensely, so 
they also create accounts and attempt to 
mislead uninformed users into revealing 
personal information. The thieves may claim to 
have software updates and free games, when 
they really are luring users to bogus websites 
that ask users to set up profiles and accounts.
Gamers should follow these practices to 
increase their security:
• Before downloading any software or apps, 
including patches to games, or disclosing 
any private details, check the developer 
to be certain the website or the person 
­making the request is legitimate.
• Read the permissions notices to learn what 
information is being requested or being 
collected. Avoid games requiring ­passwords 
to be saved to an online account on a 
smartphone.
• Exercise extreme caution if the game 
­requires ActiveX or ­JavaScript to be 
enabled or if it must be played in 
­administrator mode.
• Use a firewall and make exceptions to 
­allow only trusted individuals to access 
your computer or mobile device when 
­playing multiplayer online games.
• Do not share personal information with 
other gamers whom you meet online.
  Consider This: Have you played online 
games or downloaded gaming apps and 
­followed the advice listed here? How will 
you change your gaming behavior now that 
you are aware of specific security threats?
Consider This
How can you tell if your computer or mobile device is functioning as a zombie?
Your computer or mobile device may be a zombie if you notice an unusually high drive activity, a slower than normal 
Internet connection, or connected devices becoming increasingly unresponsive. The chances of your computer or 
devices becoming part of a botnet greatly increase if your devices are not protected by an effective firewall.

Denial of Service Attacks
A denial of service attack (DoS attack) is an assault whose purpose is to disrupt computer 
access to an Internet service, such as the web or email. Perpetrators carry out a DoS attack in 
a variety of ways. For example, they may use an unsuspecting computer to send an influx of 
­confusing data messages or useless traffic to a computer network. The victim computer network  
slows down considerably and eventually becomes unresponsive or unavailable, blocking 
­legitimate visitors from accessing the network.
A more devastating type of DoS attack is the distributed DoS attack (DDoS attack) in which a 
zombie army is used to attack computers or computer networks. DDoS attacks have been able to 
stop operations temporarily at numerous websites, including powerhouses such as Yahoo!, eBay, 
Amazon.com, and CNN.com.
The damage caused by a DoS or DDoS attack usually is extensive. During the outage, ­retailers 
lose sales from customers, news websites and search engines lose revenue from advertisers, and 
time-sensitive information may be delayed. Repeated attacks could tarnish reputations, ­causing 
even greater losses.
Internet Research
Are DoS attacks still 
prevalent?
Search for: news of dos 
attacks
Consider This
Why would someone execute a Dos or DDoS attack?
Perpetrators have a variety of motives for executing a DoS or DDoS attack. Hactivists, or those who disagree with 
the beliefs or actions of a particular organization, claim political anger motivates their attacks. Some perpetrators 
use the attack as a vehicle for extortion. Others simply want the recognition, even though it is negative.
	
Back Doors
A back door is a program or set of instructions in a program that allows users to bypass 
­security controls when accessing a program, computer, or network. Once perpetrators gain 
access to unsecure computers, they often install a back door or modify an existing program to 
include a back door, which allows them to continue to access the computer remotely ­without 
the user’s knowledge. A rootkit can be a back door. Some worms leave back doors, which 
have been used to spread other worms or to distribute spam from the unsuspecting victim 
computers.
Programmers often build back doors into programs during system development. These back 
doors save development time because the programmer can bypass security controls while ­writing 
and testing programs. Similarly, a computer repair technician may install a back door while 
troubleshooting problems on a computer. If a programmer or computer repair technician fails 
to remove a back door, a perpetrator could use the back door to gain entry to a computer or 
­network.
Spoofing
Spoofing is a technique intruders use to make their network or Internet transmission appear 
legitimate to a victim computer or network. Two common types of spoofing schemes are IP and 
email spoofing.
• IP spoofing occurs when an intruder computer fools a network into believing its IP address is 
associated with a trusted source. Perpetrators of IP spoofing trick their victims into interacting 
with the phony website. For example, the victim may provide confidential information or 
download files containing viruses, worms, or other malware.
• Email spoofing occurs when the sender’s address or other components of an email header are 
altered so that it appears that the email message originated from a different sender. Email 
spoofing commonly is used in virus hoaxes, spam, and phishing scams (Figure 5-3). Read  
How To 5-1 to learn about how to determine if an email message has been spoofed.

Safeguards against Internet and Network Attacks
Methods that protect computers, mobile devices, and networks from attacks include the 
­following:
• Use antivirus software.
• Be suspicious of unsolicited email attachments.
• Scan removable media for malware before using it.
• Implement firewall solutions.
• Back up regularly.
Secure IT 1-2 in Chapter 1 provided some measures you can take to protect your computers 
and mobile devices from malware. Read Secure IT 5-2 for additional tips to protect home users 
against Internet and network attacks. The next section discusses firewalls in more depth.
Determine If an Email Message Has 
Been Spoofed
Spoofed email messages appear to originate 
from one source, but in reality originate from 
another source. Spoofed email messages often 
are sent by nefarious people attempting to 
obtain personal information. For example, an 
email message appearing to be sent from 
a reputable source, such as your financial 
institution, may ask you to reply with per-
sonal information, such as a password, Social 
Security number, or account number. If you 
reply, you will be sending personal informa-
tion to an unknown third party that could use 
the information to steal your identity, make 
­unauthorized purchases, and more. The follow-
ing steps describe some ways to determine if 
an email message has been spoofed.
• The email message requests personal 
information, such as account numbers, 
passwords, Social Security numbers, and 
credit card numbers.
• The email message contains spelling and/
or grammatical errors.
• The email message encourages you to tap 
or click a link that takes you to another 
website.
• The header in the email message contains 
a different domain in the MessageID than 
the domain of the supposed sender.
• The “From” and “Reply-To” email 
addresses do not match.
If you ever are unsure of whether an email 
­message was spoofed, contact the supposed 
sender either via phone or a new email ­message 
(do not reply to the original email message) to 
verify the authenticity of the message.
  Consider This: Have you ever received 
a spoofed email message? Did you know it 
was spoofed? What steps did you take?

Protection from Viruses  
and Other Malware
It is impossible to ensure a virus or malware 
never will attack a computer, but you can 
take steps to protect your computer by 
­following these practices:
• Use virus protection software. Install a 
reputable antivirus program and then scan 
the entire computer to be certain it is free 
of viruses and other malware. Update the 
antivirus program and the virus signatures 
(known specific patterns of viruses) regularly.
• Use a firewall. Set up a hardware firewall 
or install a software firewall that protects your 
network’s resources from outside intrusions.
• Be suspicious of all unsolicited email 
and text messages. Never open an email 
message unless you are expecting it, and 
it is from a trusted source. When in doubt, 
ask the sender to confirm the message is 
legitimate before you open it. Be especially 
cautious when deciding whether to tap or 
click links in email and text messages or to 
open attachments.
• Disconnect your computer from the 
Internet. If you do not need Internet 
access, disconnect the computer from the 
Internet. Some security experts recommend 
disconnecting from the computer network 
before opening email attachments.
• Download software with caution. 
Download programs or apps only from 
websites you trust, especially those with 
music and video sharing software.
• Close spyware windows. If you suspect 
a pop-up or pop-under window may be 
spyware, close the window. Never tap or 
click an Agree or OK button in a suspicious 
window.
• Before using any removable media, 
scan it for malware. Follow this pro-
cedure even for shrink-wrapped software 
from major developers. Some commercial 
software has been infected and distributed 
to unsuspecting users. Never start a com-
puter with removable media inserted in the 
computer unless you are certain the media 
are uninfected.
• Keep current. Install the latest updates 
for your computer software. Stay informed 
about new virus alerts and virus hoaxes.
• Back up regularly. In the event your 
computer becomes unusable due to a virus 
attack or other malware, you will be able 
to restore operations if you have a clean 
(uninfected) backup.
  Consider This: What precautions 
do you take to prevent viruses and other 
­malware from infecting your computer? 
What new steps will you take to attempt to 
protect your computer?
Firewalls
A firewall is hardware and/or software that protects a network’s resources from intrusion 
by users on another network, such as the Internet. All networked and online users should 
­implement a firewall solution.
Organizations use firewalls to protect network resources from outsiders and to restrict 
employees’ access to sensitive data, such as payroll or personnel records. They can implement 
a firewall solution themselves or outsource their needs to a company specializing in providing 
firewall protection.
Large organizations often route all their communications through a proxy server, which 
­typically is a component of the firewall. A proxy server is a server outside the organization’s 
network that controls which communications pass in and out of the organization’s network. 
That is, a proxy server carefully screens all incoming and outgoing messages. Proxy servers 
use a variety of screening techniques. Some check the domain name or IP address of the mes-
sage for legitimacy. Others require that the messages have digital signatures (discussed later in 
this chapter).

You could use an online security service, which is a web app that evaluates your computer or mobile device to 
check for Internet and email vulnerabilities. The online security service then provides recommendations of how to 
address the vulnerabilities.
Organizations requiring assistance or information about Internet security breaches can contact or visit the 
website for the Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center, or CERT/CC, which is a federally funded 
Internet security research and development center.

Home and small/home office users often protect their computers with a personal firewall. 
As discussed in Chapter 4, a personal firewall is a software firewall that detects and protects 
a ­personal computer and its data from unauthorized intrusions. Personal firewalls constantly 
monitor all transmissions to and from the computer and may inform a user of any attempted 
intrusions. Both Windows and Mac operating systems include firewall capabilities, including 
monitoring Internet traffic to and from installed applications. Read How To 5-2 for instructions 
about setting up a personal firewall.
Some small/home office users purchase a hardware firewall, such as a router or other device 
that has a built-in firewall, in addition to or instead of a personal firewall. Hardware firewalls 
stop malicious intrusions before they attempt to affect your computer or network. Figure 5-4 
illustrates the purpose of hardware and software firewalls.

Set Up a Personal Firewall
A personal firewall is a program that helps 
­protect your computer from unauthorized 
access by blocking certain types of communi-
cations. For example, if somebody knows the 
IP address of your computer and attempts to 
access it using a browser or other program, 
the personal firewall can be configured to 
deny the incoming connection. The follow-
ing steps describe how to set up a personal 
firewall.
	 1.	 Locate and purchase a personal 
­firewall. You can purchase personal 
firewalls online and in stores that 
sell software. Many operating sys-
tems include a personal firewall. 
Computers typically can have only 
one active personal firewall running 
at a time. If you purchase a personal 
firewall, you may need to disable  
the one that is included with the 
operating system.
	 2.	 If you purchase a personal firewall, 
follow the instructions to install the 
program on your computer.
	 3.	 Run the personal firewall.
	 4.	 If necessary, ensure the personal 
­firewall is enabled.
	 5.	 Review the settings for the incoming and 
outgoing rules. Incoming rules display 
programs and services that are allowed 
to access your computer. Outgoing rules 
display programs and services on your 
computer that are allowed to communi-
cate with other computers and mobile 
devices on your network or the Internet.
	 6.	 Back up or export your current list of 
incoming and outgoing rules. If your com-
puter does not function properly after you 
adjust the rules (in Steps 7 and 8), you 
will be able to restore the current rules.
	 7.	 Adjust your incoming rules to disallow 
devices, programs, and services you do 
not want accessing your computer. Be 
­careful adjusting these settings, as adding 
or removing rules may ­hinder a legitimate 
program’s capability to work properly.
	 8.	 Adjust your outgoing rules to allow only 
appropriate programs on your computer 
to communicate with other computers 
and mobile devices on your network 
or the Internet. Examples include 
a browser, email program, or other 
­communications programs.
	 9.	 Save your settings.
10.	Test programs on your computer that 
require Internet access. If any do not 
function properly, restore the list of rules 
you backed up or exported in Step 6.
11.	Exit the personal firewall.

How To 5-2
Unauthorized Access and Use
Unauthorized access is the use of a computer or network without permission. Unauthorized use is 
the use of a computer or its data for unapproved or possibly illegal activities.
Home and business users can be a target of unauthorized access and use. Unauthorized use 
includes a variety of activities: an employee using an organization’s computer to send personal 
email messages, an employee using the organization’s word processing software to track his or her 
child’s soccer league scores, or a perpetrator gaining access to a bank computer and ­performing an 
unauthorized transfer.
Safeguards against Unauthorized Access and Use
Organizations take several measures to help prevent unauthorized 
access and use. At a minimum, they should have a written acceptable use 
policy (AUP) that outlines the activities for which the computer and net-
work may and may not be used. An organization’s AUP should specify 
the acceptable use of technology by employees for personal reasons. 
Some organizations prohibit such use entirely. Others allow personal use 
on the employee’s own time, such as a lunch hour. Whatever the policy, 
an organization should document and explain it to employees. The 
AUP also should specify the personal activities, if any, that are allowed 
on company time. For example, can employees check personal email 
­messages or respond to personal text messages during work hours?
To protect your personal computer from unauthorized intrusions, 
you should disable file and printer sharing in your operating system 
(Figure 5-5). This security measure attempts to ensure that others cannot 
access your files or your printer. You also should be sure to use a firewall. 
The following sections address other techniques for protecting against 
unauthorized access and use. The technique(s) used should correspond to 
the degree of risk that is associated with the unauthorized access.
Figure 5-5  To protect files on your device’s hard 
drive from hackers and other intruders, turn off file 
and printer sharing on your device.

Access Controls
Many organizations use access controls to minimize the chance that a perpetrator 
­intentionally may access or an employee accidentally may access confidential information on 
a computer, mobile device, or network. An access control is a security measure that defines who 
can access a computer, device, or network; when they can access it; and what actions they can 
take while accessing it. In addition, the computer, device, or network should maintain an audit 
trail that records in a file both successful and unsuccessful access attempts. An unsuccessful 
access attempt could result from a user mistyping his or her password, or it could result from a 
­perpetrator ­trying thousands of passwords.
Organizations should investigate unsuccessful access attempts ­immediately to ensure they are 
not intentional breaches of security. They also should review successful access for irregularities, 
such as use of the computer after normal working hours or from remote computers. The secu-
rity program can be configured to alert a security administrator whenever suspicious or irregu-
lar activities are suspected. In addition, an organization regularly should review users’ access 
­privilege levels to determine whether they still are appropriate.
User Names and Passwords
A user name — also called a user ID (identification), log on name, or sign in name — is a 
unique combination of characters, such as letters of the alphabet or numbers, that identifies one 
specific user. A password is a private combination of characters associated with the user name 
that allows access to certain computer resources.
Most operating systems that enable multiple users 
to share computers and devices or that access a home 
or business network require users to enter a user 
name and a password correctly before they can access 
the data, information, and programs stored on a 
computer, mobile device, or network. Many systems 
that maintain financial, personal, and other confiden-
tial information also require a user name and pass-
word as part of their sign-in procedure (Figure 5-6).
Some systems assign a user name and/or password 
to each user. For example, a school may use a combi-
nation of letters from a student’s first and last names 
as a user name. For example, Brittany Stearn’s user 
name might be stearns_brit. Some websites use your 
email address as the user name. Information technol-
ogy (IT) departments may assign passwords so that 
they have a record in case the employee leaves or 
forgets the password.
With other systems, users select their own user 
names and/or passwords. Many users select a com-
bination of their first and last names for their user 
names. Many online social networks, media sharing sites, and retail and other websites allow 
you to choose your own user name. You might select a name that is formed from parts of 
your real name or nickname and possibly some numbers, if the name you want is taken (such 
as ­britstearns04). If you wish to remain more anonymous, choose a user name that combines 
­common words, or reflects your interests (such as guitarboston27).
Once you select a password, change it frequently. Read Secure IT 1-3 in Chapter 1 for tips 
about creating strong passwords. Do not disclose your password to anyone or write it on a slip 
of paper kept near the computer, especially taped to the monitor or under the keyboard. Email 
and telemarketing scams often ask unsuspecting users to disclose their credit card numbers, so 
be wary if you did not initiate the inquiry or phone call. Read Secure IT 5-3 for tips about using 
a password manager.
Figure 5-6  Many websites that maintain personal and confidential data, 
such as Citibank’s credit card system, require a user to enter a user name 
(user ID) and password.

Single Sign On
When you enter your 
user name into a single 
sign on account, such as 
for Microsoft, Google, 
Twitter, and Facebook, 
you automatically are 
signed in to other 
accounts and services. 
Many also recognize 
your information to 
provide additional 
customized content.

In addition to a user name and password, some systems ask users to enter one of several pieces 
of personal information. Such items can include a grandparent’s first name, your ­favorite food, 
your first pet’s name, or the name of the elementary school you attended. These items should 
be facts that you easily remember but are not easy for others to discover about you when using 
a search engine or examining your profiles on online social networks. As with a password, if the 
user’s response does not match information on file, the system denies access.
Passphrase  Instead of passwords, some organizations use passphrases to authenticate users. 
A passphrase is a private combination of words, often containing mixed capitalization and 
punctuation, associated with a user name that allows access to certain computer resources. 
Passphrases, which often can be up to 100 characters in length, are more secure than 
­passwords, yet can be easy to remember because they contain words.
PIN  A PIN (personal identification number), sometimes called a passcode, is a numeric 
­password, either assigned by a company or selected by a user. PINs provide an additional level 
of security. Select PINs carefully and protect them as you do any other password. For exam-
ple, do not use the same four digits, sequential digits, or dates others could easily determine, 
such as birth dates.
Secure IT 5-3
Safely Use a Password Manager
If you use the same password to access your 
banking, shopping, online social ­networks, 
and school accounts, you are not alone. Many 
people think one password is ­sufficient pro-
tection for all their vital online accounts, but 
cyberthieves are aware of this flawed thinking 
and take advantage of this practice. Security 
experts recommend using different user 
names and passwords for every account and 
changing the passwords frequently.
Keeping track of all these accounts can be an 
overwhelming task. A password manager, also 
called a password organizer, is a convenient 
service that stores all your account information 
securely. Once you select a service, you 
download and install the software and create 
one master password. The first time you view a 
password-protected website and enter your user 
name and password, the password manager 
saves this information. The next time you visit 
one of these websites or apps, the software 
supplies the account information automatically. 
Password managers use two-step verification 
and advanced encryption techniques (discussed 
later in this chapter) to ensure information is 
stored securely.
Some managers offer the option to 
generate random passwords, which have a 
unique combination of jumbled numbers and 
letters that are difficult for criminals to steal, 
for each account. Other features include the 
ability to auto-fill information, such as your 
name, address, and phone number, on forms 
and to provide a hint if you have forgotten 
your master password.
Password manager services can be free 
to use or may require a small annual fee. 
Some security experts recommend using a 
service that charges a fee, stating that these 
companies may provide more features. Before 
using any manager, call the company and ask 
about security measures, the ability to sync 
with multiple mobile devices, 24-hour customer 
service via live chat or phone, and limits on the 
number of passwords that can be saved.
  Consider This: Do you use a password 
manager? If so, do you feel secure storing all 
your sign in and password information in this 
service? If not, how do you keep track of your 
passwords?
Consider This
Why do some websites allow you to use your email address as a user name?
No two users can have the same email address; that is, your email address is unique to you. This means you can 
use your email address and password from one website to validate your identity on another website. Facebook, 
Google, and Twitter, for example, are three popular websites that provide authentication services to other 
applications. By using your email address from one of these websites to access other websites, you do not have to 
create or remember separate user names and passwords for the various websites you visit.
	
BTW
Default Passwords
If a program or device 
has a default or preset 
password, such as 
admin, be sure to 
change it to prevent 
unauthorized access.

Possessed Objects
A possessed object is any item that you must possess, or carry with you, in order to gain access 
to a computer or computer facility. Examples of possessed objects are badges, cards, smart cards, 
and keys. The card you use in an ATM (automated teller machine), for example, is a possessed 
object that allows access to your bank account.
Biometric Devices
A biometric device authenticates a person’s identity by translating a personal characteristic, 
such as a fingerprint, into a digital code that is compared with a digital code stored in a com-
puter or mobile device verifying a physical or behavioral characteristic. If the digital code in the 
computer or mobile device does not match the personal characteristic code, the computer or 
mobile device denies access to the individual.
Biometric devices grant access to programs, ­computers, or rooms using computer analysis of some 
biometric identifier. Examples of biometric devices and systems include fingerprint ­readers, face 
recognition systems, hand geometry systems, voice 
verification systems, signature verification ­systems, 
iris recognition systems, and retinal scanners.
Fingerprint Reader  A fingerprint reader, or 
fingerprint scanner, ­captures curves and indenta-
tions of a fingerprint (Figure 5-8). Organizations 
use fingerprint readers to secure doors, computers, 
and software. With the cost of fingerprint readers 
often less than $100, some home and small busi-
ness users install fingerprint readers to authenticate 
users before they can access a personal computer. 
Consider This
Why do some websites 
display distorted characters 
you must reenter along with 
your password?
These websites use a CAPTCHA, 
which stands for Completely 
Automated Public Turing test 
to tell Computers and Humans 
Apart. A CAPTCHA is a program 
developed at Carnegie Mellon 
University that displays an image 
containing a series of distorted 
characters for a user to identify 
and enter in order to verify that 
user input is from humans and not 
computer programs (Figure 5-7).
A CAPTCHA is effective in 
blocking computer-generated 
attempts to access a website, 
because it is difficult to write 
programs for computers to detect 
distorted characters, while humans 
generally can recognize them. 
For visually impaired users or if 
words are too difficult to read, the 
CAPTCHA text can be read aloud; 
you also have the option of generating a new CAPTCHA.

Ticketmaster website, the user must enter the characters in

The reader also can be set up to perform different ­functions for different fingers; for example, 
one finger starts a ­program and another finger shuts down the computer. External fingerprint 
readers usually plug into a USB port.
Some laptops, smartphones, and smartwatches have a built fingerprint reader. Using their 
fingerprint, users can unlock the computer or device, sign in to programs and websites via their 
fingerprint instead of entering a user name and password, and on some devices, even test their 
blood pressure and heart rate.

What is a lock screen?
A lock screen is a screen that restricts 
access to a computer or mobile device until 
a user performs a certain action. Some 
simply require a user swipe the screen to 
unlock the screen. Others verify a user’s 
identity by requiring entry of a password, 
PIN, or passcode; a fingerprint scan; or a 
gesture swipe (Figure 5-9). Gestures are 
motions users make on a touch screen 
with the tip of one or more fingers or their 
hand. For example, to unlock the screen 
on a phone, a user could connect the dots 
on the screen using a pattern previously 
defined by the user.

Face Recognition System  A face recognition system captures a live face image and compares it with 
a stored image to determine if the person is a legitimate user. Some buildings use face recognition 
systems to secure access to rooms. Law enforcement, surveillance systems, and airports use 
face recognition to protect the public. Some mobile devices use face recognition systems 
to unlock the device. Face recognition programs are becoming more sophisticated and can 
recognize people with or without glasses, makeup, or jewelry, and with new hairstyles.
Hand Geometry System  A hand geometry ­system ­measures the shape and size of a 
­person’s hand (Figure 5-10). Because hand geometry systems can be expensive, they often 
are used in larger companies to track workers’ time and attendance or as security devices. 
Colleges use hand geometry systems to verify students’ identities. Daycare centers and 
hospital nurseries use them to identify parents who pick up their children.
Voice Verification System  A voice verification system compares a person’s live speech 
with their stored voice pattern. Larger organizations sometimes use voice verification 
systems as time and attendance devices. Many companies also use this technology for 
access to sensitive files and networks. Some financial services use voice ­verification 
systems to secure phone banking transactions.
Signature Verification System  A signature verification system recognizes the shape of 
your handwritten signature, as well as measures the pressure exerted and the motion 
used to write the signature. Signature verification systems use a ­specialized pen and 
tablet. Signature verification systems often are used to reduce fraud in financial institutions.

Do retailers use a signature verification system for credit card purchases?
No. With a credit card purchase, users sign their name on a signature capture pad using a stylus attached to the 
device. Software then transmits the signature to a central computer, where it is stored. Thus, the retailers use these 
systems simply to record your signature.

Iris Recognition System 
 
High security areas use iris 
recognition systems. The 
camera in an iris recognition 
system uses iris recognition 
technology to read pat-
terns in the iris of the eye 
(Figure 5-11). These patterns 
are as unique as a fingerprint. 
Iris recognition systems are 
quite expensive and are used 
by government security orga-
nizations, the military, and 
financial institutions that 
deal with highly sensitive 
data. Some organizations use 
retinal scanners, which work 
similarly but instead scan pat-
terns of blood vessels in the 
back of the retina.

Two-Step Verification
In an attempt to further protect personal data and information from online thieves, many 
organizations such as financial institutions or universities that store sensitive or confidential 
items use a two-step verification process. With two-step verification, also known as two-factor 
verification, a computer or mobile device uses two separate methods, one after the next, to verify 
the identity of a user.
ATMs (automated teller machines) usually requires a two-step verification. Users first insert 
their ATM card into the ATM (Step 1) and then enter a PIN (Step 2) to access their bank 
account. Most debit cards and some credit cards use PINs. If someone steals these cards, the 
thief must enter the user’s PIN to access the account.
Another use of two-step verification requires a mobile phone and a computer. When users sign in to 
an account on a computer, they enter a user name and a password (Step 1). Next, they are prompted 
to enter another authentication code (Step 2), which is sent as a text or voice ­message or via an app 
on a smartphone (Figure 5-12). This second code generally is valid for a set time, sometimes only for 
a few hours. If users do not sign in during this time limit, they must repeat the process and request 
another verification code. Microsoft and Google commonly use two-step verification when you sign in 
to their websites. If you sign in from a device you use ­frequently, you can elect to bypass this step.
Consider This
How popular are biometric devices?
Biometric devices are gaining popularity as a security precaution because they are a virtually foolproof method of 
identification and authentication. For example, some grocery stores, retail stores, and gas stations use biometric 
payment, where the customer’s fingerprint is read by a fingerprint reader that is linked to a payment method, such as 
a checking account or credit card. Users can forget their user names and passwords. Possessed objects can be lost, 
copied, duplicated, or stolen. Personal characteristics, by contrast, are unique and cannot be forgotten or misplaced.
Biometric devices do have disadvantages. If you cut your finger, a fingerprint reader might reject you as a 
legitimate user. Hand geometry readers can transmit germs. If you are nervous, a signature might not match the one 
on file. If you have a sore throat, a voice recognition system might reject you. Many people are uncomfortable with 
the thought of using an iris scanner.

Can users circumvent the two-step verification process?
Users may be able to specify a computer as a trusted device during a two-step verification so that future sign-in 
attempts on that same computer will bypass the two-step verification. Only limited-use computers in safe areas 
should be identified as a trusted device.
	
Digital Forensics
Digital forensics, also called cyberforensics, is the discovery, collection, and analysis of ­evidence 
found on computers and networks. Digital forensics involves the examination of media, 
­programs, data and log files on computers, mobile devices, servers, and networks. Many areas 
use digital forensics, including law enforcement, criminal prosecutors, military intelligence, 
insurance agencies, and information security departments in the private sector.
A digital forensics examiner must have knowledge of the law, technical experience with 
many types of hardware and software products, superior communication skills, familiarity 
with ­corporate structures and policies, a willingness to learn and update skills, and a knack for 
­problem solving.

Software Theft
Software theft occurs when someone steals software media, intentionally erases programs, 
­illegally registers and/or activates a program, or illegally copies a program.
• Physically stealing software: A perpetrator physically steals the media that contains the 
software, or steals the hardware that contains the media that contains the software. For 
example, an unscrupulous library patron might steal a game CD/DVD.
• Intentionally erasing software: A perpetrator erases the media that contains the software.  
For example, a software developer who is terminated from a company may retaliate by 
removing or disabling the programs he or she has written from company computers.
• Illegal registration/activation: A perpetrator illegally obtains registration numbers and/
or activation codes. A program called a keygen, short for key generator, creates software 
registration numbers and sometimes activation codes. Some unscrupulous individuals create 
and post keygens so that users can install software without legally purchasing it.
• Illegal copying: A perpetrator copies software from manufacturers. Software piracy, often 
referred to simply as piracy, is the unauthorized and illegal duplication of copyrighted 
software. Piracy is the most common form of software theft.
Safeguards against Software Theft
To protect software media from being stolen, owners should keep original software boxes and 
media or the online confirmation of purchased software in a secure location, out of sight of prying 
eyes. All computer users should back up their files and drives regularly, in the event of theft. When 
some companies terminate a software developer or if the software developer quits, they escort the 
employee off the premises immediately. These companies believe that allowing terminated employ-
ees to remain on the premises gives them time to sabotage files and other network ­procedures.
Many manufacturers incorporate an activation process into their programs to ensure 
the ­software is not installed on more computers than legally licensed. During the product 
­activation, which is conducted either online or by phone, users provide the software product’s 
identification number to associate the software with the computer or mobile device on which 
the software is installed. Usually, the software can be run a preset number of times, has limited 
­functionality, or does not function until you activate it.
To further protect themselves from software piracy, software manufacturers issue users license 
agreements. As discussed in Chapter 4, a license agreement is the right to use software. That 
is, you do not own the software. The most common type of license included with software pur-
chased by individual users is a single-user license agreement, also called an end-user license agreement 
(EULA). The license agreement provides specific conditions for use of the software, which a 
user must accept before using the software. These terms usually are displayed when you install

the software. Use of the software constitutes 
acceptance of the terms on the user’s part. 
Figure 5-13 identifies the conditions of a 
typical single-user license agreement.
To support multiple users’ access of 
­software, most manufacturers sell network 
versions or site licenses of their software, 
which usually costs less than buying indi-
vidual stand-alone ­copies of the software for 
each computer. A network license is a legal 
agreement that allows multiple users to 
access the software on the server simultane-
ously. The network license fee usually is 
based on the number of users or the ­number 
of computers attached to the network. 
A site license is a legal agreement that ­permits 
users to install the software on multiple 
computers — usually at a volume discount.

Typical Conditions of a Single-User License Agreement
You can…
           • Install the software on only one computer or device. (Some license
 
agreements allow users to install the software on a specified number
 
of computers and/or mobile devices.)
           • Make one copy of the software as a backup.
           • Give or sell the software to another individual, but only if the software
 
is removed from the user’s computer first.
You cannot…
           • Install the software on a network, such as a school computer lab.
           • Give copies to friends and colleagues, while continuing to use the software.
           • Export the software.
           • Rent or lease the software.

Can you install software on work computers or work-issued smartphones?
Many organizations and businesses have strict written policies governing the installation and use of software and 
enforce their rules by checking networked or online computers or mobile devices periodically to ensure that all 
software is licensed properly. If you are not completely familiar with your school’s or employer’s policies governing 
installation of software, check with the information technology department or your school’s technology coordinator.
	
Information Theft
Information theft occurs when someone steals personal or confidential information. Both 
­business and home users can fall victim to information theft. An unethical company executive  
may steal or buy stolen information to learn about a competitor. A corrupt individual may 
steal credit card numbers to make fraudulent purchases. Information theft often is linked to 
other types of cybercrime. For example, an individual first might gain unauthorized access to a 
­computer and then steal credit card numbers stored in a firm’s accounting department.
Safeguards against Information Theft
Most organizations will attempt to prevent information theft by implementing the user 
­identification and authentication controls discussed earlier in this chapter. These controls are 
best suited for protecting information on computers located on an organization’s premises. To 
further protect information on the Internet and networks, organizations and individuals use a 
variety of encryption techniques.
Encryption
Encryption is the process of converting data that is readable by humans into encoded 
­characters to prevent unauthorized access. You treat encrypted data just like any other data. That 
is, you can store it or send it in an email message. To read the data, the recipient must decrypt, 
or decode it. For example, users may specify that an email application encrypt a message before 
sending it securely. The recipient’s email application would need to decrypt the message in order 
for the recipient to be able to read it.

Chapter 5  Digital Security, Ethics, and Privacy
In the encryption process, the unencrypted, readable data is called plaintext. The encrypted 
(scrambled) data is called ciphertext. An encryption algorithm, or cypher, is a set of steps that can 
convert readable plaintext into unreadable ciphertext. A simple encryption algorithm might 
switch the order of characters or replace characters with other characters. Encryption programs 
typically use more than one encryption algorithm, along with an encryption key. An encryption 
key is a set of characters that the originator of the data uses to encrypt the plaintext and the 
recipient of the data uses to decrypt the ciphertext.
Two basic types of encryption are private key and public key. With private key encryption, also called 
symmetric key encryption, both the originator and the recipient use the same secret key to encrypt and 
decrypt the data. Public key encryption, also called asymmetric key encryption, uses two encryption keys: 
a public key and a private key (Figure 5-14). Public key encryption software generates both the pri-
vate key and the public key. A message encrypted with a public key can be decrypted only with the 
corresponding private key, and vice versa. The public key is made known to message originators and 
recipients. For example, public keys may be posted on a secure webpage or a public-key server, or 
they may be emailed. The private key, by contrast, should be kept confidential.
Some operating systems and email programs allow you to encrypt the contents of files and 
messages that are stored on your computer. You also can purchase an encryption program to 
encrypt files. Many browsers use encryption when sending private information, such as credit 
card numbers, over the Internet.
Mobile users today often access their company networks through a virtual private network. 
When a mobile user connects to a main office using a standard Internet connection, a virtual  
private network (VPN) provides the mobile user with a secure connection to the company 
­network server, as if the user has a private line. VPNs help ensure that data is safe from 
being intercepted by unauthorized people by encrypting data as it transmits from a laptop, 
­smartphone, or other mobile device.

Digital Signatures and Certificates
A digital signature is an encrypted code that a person, website, or organization attaches to an 
electronic message to verify the identity of the message sender. Digital signatures often are used 
to ensure that an impostor is not participating in an Internet transaction. That is, digital signa-
tures can help to prevent email forgery. A digital signature also can verify that the content of a 
message has not changed.
A digital certificate is a notice that guarantees a user or a website is legitimate. E-commerce 
applications commonly use digital certificates. Browsers often display a warning message if a 
website does not have a valid digital certificate.
A website that uses encryption techniques to secure its data is known as a secure site 
(Figure 5-15). Web addresses of secure sites often begin with https instead of http. Secure sites 
typically use digital certificates along with security protocols.

Who issues digital certificates?
A certificate authority (CA) is an organization that issues digital certificates. Each CA is a trusted third party that 
takes responsibility for verifying the sender’s identity before issuing a certificate. Individuals and companies can 
purchase digital certificates from one of more than 35 online CA providers. The cost varies depending on the 
desired level of data encryption, with the strongest levels recommended for financial and e-commerce transactions.

Chapter 5  Digital Security, Ethics, and Privacy
Cloud Data Privacy
Privacy and security concerns arise when consumers 
and businesses consider moving their data to an online 
storage service. While the cloud offers a tremendous 
amount of storage space at a relatively low cost, the 
security of data and the reliability of cloud companies 
trigger concerns.
When people register for a cloud computing service, 
they sign a written contract or tap or click an online OK 
or Agree button to affirm they read and understand the 
terms of the agreement. Any data saved on the cloud is 
entrusted to the third-party provider, which has a legal 
obligation to protect the data from security breaches. 
The company also must guard against data loss due to 
physical disasters, such as power outages, cooling fail-
ures, and fire. When data has been compromised, many 
states require the company to disclose the issue to the 
data owner promptly.
The Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) warns of ­hackers 
who register for the service with a credit card or for 
a free trial period and then unleash malware in an 
attempt to gain access to passwords. Because the regis-
tration and validation procedure for accessing the cloud 
is relatively anonymous, authorities can have ­difficulty 
locating the abusers.
Another concern arises when transferring data over 
a network to the cloud. When the data is traveling to 
or from a computer and the cloud service, it is sub-
ject to interception. To minimize risk, security experts 
emphasize that the web address of the website you are 
visiting must begin with https, and the data should be 
encrypted and authenticated.
Law enforcement’s access to the data raises another 
security issue. Email messages stored on a private 
server belong to the company or individual who owns 
the computer, so law enforcement officials must obtain 
a search warrant to read a particular user’s messages. 
In contrast, law enforcement officials can access 
email messages stored on the cloud by requesting the 
information from the company that owns the cloud 
service. The user might not be notified of the search 
until up to 90 days after the search occurred; moreover, 
the search may occur without limitations and may 
include continuous monitoring of an individual’s email 
­communications.
International laws and industry regulations ­protect 
sensitive and personal data. Germany has some of 
the strictest cloud data privacy laws, and, in general, 
the European Union’s privacy regulations are more 
­protective that those in the United States. In much of 
Europe, for example, consumers must agree to have 
their personal information collected, and they can 
review the data for accuracy. The education, health care, 
and financial services industries in the United States 
have strict data privacy regulations that affect cloud 
storage. For example, the Family Educational Rights 
and Privacy Act (FERPA) regulates the confidentiality of 
students’ educational records, so colleges must obtain 
students’ consent to share data with cloud ­storage pro-
viders and other third parties.
Cloud storage companies have increased their 
privacy and security features in recent years. Many 
allow consumers and businesses to protect files with 
passwords or require two-step authentication to access 
files, to delete data if a mobile device has been stolen 
or lost, and to delete data that has been stored past an 
expiration date.

  Consider This: How much of your personal data  
is stored on the cloud? Do you have concerns about the 
security of this data? Have you ever received a notice 
that any of your online data has been compromised? 
Should online social networks or email providers give 
more explicit notice that data is stored on the cloud? 
Should law enforcement officials be able to access your 
data without your consent? Why or why not?

Ethics & Issues 5-2
Who Is Responsible for Data Left  
on the Cloud?
Businesses often contract with cloud storage 
providers for data storage. Many businesses 
also use cloud storage providers to store 
customer data. This data could include con-
tact information, credit card numbers, and 
ordering history.
Ownership of cloud data becomes an 
issue when a cloud storage provider or the 
business using the cloud services closes. 
Other issues include what happens if the 
business fails to pay the cloud storage 
provider, or when a contract ends. Many feel 
that it is the responsibility of the business 
owner to remove and destroy company 
data before a contract ends. Supporters of 
this argument believe that cloud storage 
providers should not be accessing data they 
host. Others contend that if a business fails 
to remove and destroy its data before its 
cloud storage contract ends, cloud storage 
providers should return the data, or remove 
the data permanently.
An ongoing debate exists related to who 
is responsible for cloud data security. Many 
experts put the responsibility of securing 
data in the hands of the data owner. Others 
advocate for a shared security model, in 
which the cloud storage provider includes 
security tools, but the company provides 
additional security as needed.
Ownership and security of data should 
be included in any contract between 
a business and cloud storage provider. 
Contracts also should specify what happens 
in a variety of scenarios, including if either 
party stops its operations, or if hackers 
access the data.
Consider This: If a business stops its 
­operations, who should remove its data 
from cloud storage? Why? If a customer 
does not remove its data before a contract 
ends, should a cloud storage provider return 
the data, or can it remove or sell the data? 
Why or why not? Who is responsible for 
data security? Why?
Hardware Theft, Vandalism, and Failure
Users rely on computers and mobile devices to create, store, and 
manage important information. As discussed in Chapter 3, you 
should take measures to protect computers and devices from 
theft, vandalism, and failure.
Hardware theft is the act of stealing digital equipment. 
Hardware vandalism involves defacing or destroying digital 
equipment. Hardware can fail for a variety of reasons: aging 
hardware, ­natural or man-made disasters, or random events 
such as electrical power problems, and even errors in programs 
or apps. Figure 5-16 summarizes the techniques you can use to 
safeguard hardware from theft, vandalism, and failure.
Backing Up — The Ultimate Safeguard
To protect against data loss caused by hardware/software/information theft or system failure,  
users should back up computer and mobile device files regularly. As previously described, 
a backup is a duplicate of a file, program, or media that can be used if the original is lost, 
­damaged, or destroyed; and to back up a file means to make a copy of it. In the case of system 
failure or the discovery of corrupted files, you restore the files by copying the backed up files to 
their original location on the computer or mobile device.
If you choose to back up locally, be sure to use high-quality media. A good choice for a home user 
might be optical discs or an external hard drive. Keep your backup media in a fireproof and heat-
proof safe or vault, or offsite. Off-site means in a location separate from where you ­typically store or 
use your computer or mobile device. Keeping backup copies off-site minimizes the chance that a 
single disaster, such as a fire, would destroy both the original and the backup media. An off-site loca-
tion can be a safe deposit box at a bank, a briefcase, or cloud storage or cloud backup.
Cloud storage provides storage to customers, usually along with synchronization services but often 
on smaller amounts of data. By contrast, cloud backup provides only backup and retrieval services, 
but generally provides continuous data protection (discussed next) to the cloud. More customers are 
opting for cloud backup because it saves them the cost of maintaining hardware (Figure 5-17).
Hardware Theft and Vandalism Safeguards
   • Physical access controls (i.e., locked doors and windows)
   • Alarm system
   • Physical security devices (i.e., cables and locks)

Chapter 5  Digital Security, Ethics, and Privacy
Backup programs are 
available from many 
sources. Most operating sys-
tems include a backup pro-
gram. Backup devices, such 
as external disk drives, also 
include backup programs. 
Numerous stand-alone 
backup tools exist. Cloud 
storage providers may offer 
backup services. Users of a 
cloud backup service install 
software on their comput-
ers that backs up files to the 
cloud as they are modified.
Business and home users 
can perform four types of backup: full, differential, incremental, or selective. A fifth type, continu-
ous data protection, often is used only by large enterprises to back up data to an in-house network 
storage device purchased and maintained by the enterprise. Cloud backup services, a sixth option, 
are providing continuous data protection capabilities at a lower cost. Table 5-2 summarizes the pur-
pose, advantages, and disadvantages of each of these backup methods.
Some users implement a three-generation backup policy to preserve three copies of important  
files. The grandparent is the oldest copy of the file. The parent is the second oldest copy of 
the file. The child is the most recent copy of the file. When a new backup is performed, the 
child becomes the parent, the parent becomes the grandparent, and the media on which the 
­grandparent copy was stored may be erased and reused for a future backup.

Disaster Recovery
A disaster can be natural or man-made (hackers, viruses, 
etc.). Each company and each department or division 
within an organization usually has its own disaster 
recovery plan. The following scenario illustrates how an 
organization might implement a disaster recovery plan.
Rosewood Associates is a consulting firm that helps 
clients use social media for marketing and customer 
outreach. Last week, a fire broke out in the office suite 
above Rosewood. The heat and smoke, along with 
water from the sprinkler system, caused extensive dam-
age. As a result, Rosewood must replace all computers, 
servers, and storage devices. Also, the company lost all 
of the data it had not backed up.
Rosewood currently backs up its systems daily to an 
internal server and weekly to a remote cloud server. 
Because of damage to the internal server, the company 
lost several days of data. Rosewood does not have a 
plan for replacing hardware. Thus, they will lose several 
additional days of productivity while purchasing, install-
ing, and configuring new hardware.
To minimize the chance of this type of loss in the 
future, the company hired you as a consultant to help 
create a disaster recovery plan. You first discuss the 
types of disasters that can strike, as shown in the table. 
You then explain that the goal of a disaster recovery 
plan is to prevent, detect, and correct system threats, 
and to restore the most critical systems first.
A disaster recovery plan typically contains these four 
components: emergency plan, backup plan, recovery 
plan, and test plan.
Emergency Plan: An emergency plan specifies the 
steps Rosewood will take as soon as a disaster strikes. 
The emergency plan is organized by type of disaster, 
such as fire, flood, or earthquake, and includes:
1.	 Names and phone numbers of people and 
­organizations to notify (company management, 
fire and police department, clients, etc.)
2.	 Computer equipment procedures, such as equipment 
or power shutoff, and file removal; employees should 
follow these ­procedures only if it is safe to do so
3.	 Employee evacuation procedures
4.	 Return procedures (who can enter the facility and 
what actions they are to perform)
Backup Plan: The backup plan specifies how 
Rosewood will use backup files and equipment to 
resume computer operations, and includes:
1.	 The location of backup data, supplies, and equipment
2.	 Who is responsible for gathering backup resources and 
transporting them to an alternate computer facility
3.	 The methods by which data will be restored from 
cloud storage
4.	 A schedule indicating the order and approximate 
time each ­application should be up and running
Recovery Plan: The recovery plan specifies the actions 
Rosewood will take to restore full computer opera-
tions. As with the emergency plan, the recovery plan 
differs for each type of disaster. You recommend that 
Rosewood set up planning committees. Each committee 
would be responsible for different forms of recovery, 
such as replacing hardware or software.
Test Plan: The test plan includes simulating various levels 
of disasters and recording Rosewood’s ability to recover. 
You run a test in which the employees follow the steps in 
the disaster recovery plan. The test uncovers a few needed 
recovery actions not specified in the plan, so you modify the 
plan. A few days later, you run another test without giving 
the employees any advance notice to test the plan again.

Wireless Security
Billions of home and ­business users have laptops, 
smartphones, and other mobile devices to access 
the Internet, send email and Internet messages, chat 
online, or share network ­connections — all wire-
lessly. Home users set up wireless home ­networks. 
Mobile users access wireless networks in hot spots at 
­airports, hotels, shopping malls, bookstores, restau-
rants, and ­coffee shops. Schools have wireless net-
works so that ­students can access the school network 
using their mobile computers and devices as they 
move from building to building (Figure 5-18).
Although wireless access provides many conveniences 
to users, it also poses additional security risks. Some 
perpetrators connect to other’s ­wireless networks to gain 
free Internet access; others may try to access an organi-
zation’s confidential data.
To access a wireless network, the individual must 
be in range of the wireless network. Some intruders 
intercept and monitor communications as they transmit 
through the air. Others connect to a network through 
an unsecured wireless access point (WAP) or combination router/WAP. Read How To 5-3 for 
instructions about ways to secure a wireless network, in addition to using ­firewalls.

Secure Your Wireless Network
When you set up a wireless network, it is 
important to secure the network so that 
only your computers and mobile devices 
can connect to it. Unsecured wireless net-
works can be seen and accessed by neigh-
bors and others nearby, which may make 
it easier for them to connect to and access 
the data on the computers and mobile 
devices on your network. The following 
list provides suggestions for securing your 
wireless network.
• Immediately upon connecting your 
­wireless access point and/or router, 
change the password required to access 
administrative features. If the password 
remains at its default setting, others may 
possibly be able to connect to and config-
ure your wireless network settings.
• Change the SSID (service set identifier), which 
is a network name, from the default to some-
thing that uniquely identifies your network, 
especially if you live in close proximity to 
other wireless networks.
• Do not broadcast the SSID. This will make 
it more difficult for others to detect your 
wireless network. When you want to connect 
a computer or mobile device to your wireless 
network, it will be necessary to enter the SSID 
manually.
• Enable an encryption method such as WPA2 
(Wi-Fi Protected Access 2), and specify a 
password or passphrase that is difficult for 
others to guess. The most secure passwords 
and passphrases contain more than eight 
characters, uppercase and lowercase letters, 
numbers, and special characters.
• Enable and configure the 
MAC (Media Access Control) 
address control feature. A 
MAC address is a unique 
hardware identifier for your 
computer or device. The 
MAC address control feature 
specifies the computers and 
mobile devices that can 
connect to your network. If 
a computer or device is not 
specified, it will not be able 
to connect.
• Choose a secure location 
for your wireless router so 
that ­unauthorized people cannot access it. 
­Someone who has physical access to a wire-
less router can restore factory defaults and 
erase your settings.
  Consider This: In addition to 
­safeguarding the data and information on 
your computers from others, why else might 
it be a good idea to secure your wireless 
network?

Mini Feature 5-3: Mobile Security
As the number of smartphones and mobile devices in use increases, the possibility of security 
breaches and lost devices increases proportionally. Read Mini Feature 5-3 to learn about ways 
you can protect sensitive and personal data on your mobile devices.
Consider This
Can you detect if someone is accessing your wireless home network?
If you notice the speed of your wireless connection is slower than normal, it may be a sign that someone else is 
accessing your network. You also may notice indicator lights on your wireless router flashing rapidly when you are 
not connected to your wireless network. Most wireless routers have a built-in utility that allows you to view the 
computers currently connected to your network. If you notice a computer that does not belong to you, consult your 
wireless router’s documentation to determine how to remove it from the network.	
Mobile Security
The consequences of losing a smartphone or mobile device 
are significant given the amount of storage and the variety 
of personal and business data stored. Symantec, one the 
world’s leading online security companies, projects that 
only one-half of lost or stolen phones eventually will be 
returned to their owners. Chances are that the people who 
find the missing phones likely will have viewed much of 
the content on the devices in a quest to find the owners 
and possibly to gain access to private information.
The goal, therefore, for mobile device users is to 
make their data as secure as possible. Follow these 
steps to ­protect sensitive and personal data and to 
fight mobile cybercrime.
• Be extra cautious locating and downloading 
apps. Any device that connects to the Internet is 
­susceptible to mobile malware. Cyberthieves target 
apps on widely used phones and tablets. Popular 
games are likely candidates to house malware, and 
it often is difficult to distinguish the legitimate apps 
from the fake apps. Obtain mobile device apps 
from well-known stores, and before downloading 
anything, read the descriptions and reviews. Look for 
­misspellings and awkward sentence structure, which 
could be clues that the app is fake. If something looks 
awry, do not download. Scrutinize the number and 
types of permissions the app is requesting. If the list 
seems unreasonable in length or in the personal infor-
mation needed, deny permission and uninstall the app.
• Use a PIN. Enable the passcode feature on a mobile 
device as the first step in stopping prying eyes from 
viewing contents. This four-to-eight-digit code adds 
a layer of protection. Only emergency functions can 
be accessed without entering the correct sequence of 
numbers. This strong code should not be information 
easily guessed, such as a birthdate.
• Turn off GPS tracking. GPS technology can 
track the mobile device’s location as long as it is 
transmitting and receiving signals to and from 
satellites. This feature is helpful to obtain directions 
from your current location, view local news and 
weather reports, find a lost device, summon emergency 
personnel, and locate missing children. Serious privacy 
concerns can arise, however, when the technology is 
used in malicious ways, such as to stalk individuals 
or trace their whereabouts. Unless you want to allow 
others to follow your locations throughout the day, 
disable the GPS tracking 
feature until needed.
•  Use mobile security 
software. Protection 
is necessary to stop 
viruses and spyware 
and to safeguard 
personal and business 
data. Mobile security 
apps can allow you 
to lock your mobile 
device and SIM card 
remotely, erase the

Chapter 5  Digital Security, Ethics, and Privacy
Ethics and Society
As with any powerful technology, computers and mobile devices can be used for both good 
and bad intentions. The standards that determine whether an action is good or bad are known 
as ethics.
Technology ethics are the moral guidelines that govern the use of computers, mobile devices, 
information systems, and related technologies. Frequently discussed areas of computer ethics are 
unauthorized use of computers, mobile devices, and networks; software theft (piracy); informa-
tion accuracy; intellectual property rights; codes of conduct; green computing; and information 
privacy. The questionnaire in Figure 5-19 raises issues in each of these areas.
Previous sections in this chapter discussed unauthorized use of computers, mobile devices 
and networks, and software theft (piracy). The following sections discuss issues related to 
­information accuracy, intellectual property rights, codes of conduct, green computing, and 
­information privacy.
Now you should know
Be sure you understand the material presented in the sections titled Software Theft; Information Theft; Hardware 
Theft, Vandalism, and Failure; Backing Up – The Ultimate Safeguard; and Wireless Security as it relates to the 
­chapter objectives.
Now you should know …
• What actions you are allowed according to a software license agreement (Objective 4)
• Why you would want to use encryption, digital signatures, or digital certificates (Objective 5)
• How you can protect your hardware from theft, vandalism, and failure (Objective 6)
• Which backup method is most suited to your needs (Objective 7)
• How you can protect your wireless communications (Objective 8)

memory, and activate the GPS function. Other apps 
prevent cyberthieves from hijacking your phone and 
taking pictures, making recordings, placing calls 
to fee-imposed businesses, and sending infected 
messages to all individuals in your contact list. Look 
for security software that can back up data to a cloud 
account, set off a screeching alarm on the lost or 
stolen mobile device, offer live customer service, and 
provide theft, spam, virus, and malware protection.
• Avoid tapping or clicking unsafe links. Tapping 
or clicking an unknown link can lead to malicious 
websites. If you receive a text message from someone 
you do not know or an invitation to tap or click a 
link, resist the urge to fulfill the request. Your financial 
institution never will send you a message requesting 
you to enter your account user name and password. 
Malicious links can inject malware on the mobile 
device to steal personal information or to create toll 
fraud, which secretly contacts wireless messaging 
services that impose steep fees on a monthly bill.

and personal information.
  Consider This: As the number of smartphones 
and mobile devices in use increases, the possibility 
of security breaches and lost devices increases 
proportionally. How can manufacturers and wireless 
carriers emphasize the importance of mobile security 
and convince users to take the precautions suggested 
in this mini feature? What mobile security safeguards 
have you taken to protect your smartphone or mobile 
device? What steps will you take after reading this 
mini feature?

Information Accuracy
Information accuracy is a concern today because many users access information maintained 
by other people or companies, such as on the Internet. Do not assume that because the informa-
tion is on the web that it is correct. As discussed in Chapter 2, users should evaluate the value of 
a webpage before relying on its content. Be aware that the organization providing access to the 
information may not be the creator of the information. Read Secure IT 5-4 to consider the risks 
associated with inaccurate data.

Secure IT 5-4
Risks Associated with Inaccurate Data
Mapping and navigation software is invaluable 
for locating unfamiliar destinations. Problems 
arise, however, when satellite images are out-
dated or when the desired address cannot be 
found on a map. Inaccurate data can result in 
lost revenues for businesses when potential 
customers cannot find the storefront. It also has 
caused accidents when drivers followed turn-
by-turn GPS directions and drove the wrong 
way on one-way streets, made illegal turns, or 
ended at ponds where a road stopped.
Business owners can report incorrect 
address data to some mapping services. 
They can, for example, state that the satellite 
image needs updating, their address has 
changed, the directions are incorrect, or the 
street names are inaccurate. In some cases, 
the maps and addresses are updated quickly, 
often within a day.
Data entry errors also can lead to lost 
business, lawsuits, and expenses. In an 
extreme example, a $125 million Mars 
Climate Orbiter spacecraft was lost in space 
because Lockheed Martin engineers performed 
calculations using English units (pounds) to 
fire the thrusters guiding the spacecraft, but 
NASA engineers assumed the data was in 
metric units (Newtons) and sent the spacecraft 
60 miles off course. In another unit conversion 
error, an axle broke on a Space Mountain 
roller coaster car at Tokyo Disneyland because 
it was the wrong size; the error occurred when 
engineers performed calculations to convert 
the original Space Mountain master plan from 
English units to metric units.
In the business world, mistakes can occur 
when software has not been updated or 
when employees are overworked, distracted, 
or faced with repetitive tasks. Software 
should have safeguards to verify valid data 
has been entered, such as checking that 
phone numbers have 10 numeric characters. 
Data cleaning software can eliminate 
duplicate database records, locate missing 
data, and correct discrepancies.
  Consider This: Have you ever used a 
mapping app or website and encountered 
incorrect information? Would you consider 
notifying mapping companies of errors in 
their satellite images or directions? What 
steps can companies take to help employees 
enter data accurately?
In addition to concerns about the accuracy of computer input, some ­individuals 
and organizations raise questions about the ethics of using computers to alter 
­output, primarily graphic output, such as a retouched photo. With graphics 
­equipment and software, users easily can digitize photos and then add, change 
(Figure 5-20), or remove images.
Intellectual Property Rights
Intellectual property (IP) refers to unique and original works, such as ideas, inventions, 
art, writings, processes, company and product names, and logos. Intellectual property 
rights are the rights to which creators are entitled for their work. Certain issues arise 
surrounding IP today because many of these works are available digitally and easily 
can be redistributed or altered without the creator’s permission.
A copyright gives authors, artists, and other creators of original work exclusive 
rights to ­duplicate, publish, and sell their materials. A copyright protects any 
­tangible form of expression.
A common infringement of copyright is piracy, where people illegally copy 
software, ­movies, and music. Many areas are not clear-cut with respect to the law, because copy-
right law gives the public fair use to copyrighted material. The issues surround the phrase, fair 
use, which allows use for educational and critical purposes. This vague definition is subject to 
widespread ­interpretation and raises many questions:
• Should individuals be able to download contents of your website, modify it, and then put it on 
the web again as their own?
• Should a faculty member have the right to print material from the web and distribute it to all 
members of the class for teaching purposes only?
• Should someone be able to scan photos or pages from a book, publish them on the web, and 
allow others to download them?
• Should someone be able to put the lyrics of a song on the web?
• Should students be able to take term papers they have written and post them on the web, 
making it tempting for other students to download and submit them as their own work?
These issues with copyright law led to the development of digital rights management (DRM),  
a strategy designed to prevent illegal distribution of movies, music, and other digital content.

Codes of Conduct
A code of conduct is a written guideline 
that helps ­determine whether a specification 
is ­ethical/unethical or allowed/not allowed. 
An IT code of conduct focuses on accept-
able use of technology. Employers and 
schools often specify standards for the ethi-
cal use of technology in an IT code of con-
duct and then distribute these standards to 
employees and students (Figure 5-21). You 
also may find codes of conduct online that 
define acceptable forms of ­communications 
for websites where users post commentary 
or other communications, such as blogs, 
wikis, online discussions, and so on.
Green Computing
People use, and often waste, resources such as ­electricity and paper while using technology. 
Recall from Chapter 1 that green computing involves reducing the electricity and environmen-
tal waste while using computers, mobile devices, and related technologies. Figure 5-22 summa-
rizes measures users can take to contribute to green computing.
Personal computers, displays, printers, and 
other devices should comply with guidelines of 
the ENERGY STAR program. The United States 
Department of Energy (DOE) and the United States 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) developed 
the ENERGY STAR program to help reduce the 
amount of electricity used by computers and related 
devices. This program encourages manufacturers to 
create energy-efficient devices. For example, many 
devices switch to sleep or power save mode after 
a specified number of inactive minutes or hours. 
Computers and devices that meet the ENERGY 
STAR guidelines display an ENERGY STAR label 
(shown in Figure 5-22).
Enterprise data centers and computer facilities 
consume large amounts of electricity from com-
puter hardware and associated devices and utili-
ties, such as air conditioning, coolers, ­lighting, etc. 
Organizations can implement a variety of mea-
sures to reduce electrical waste:
• Consolidate servers by using virtualization.
• Purchase high-efficiency equipment.
• Use sleep modes and other power management features for computers and devices.
• Buy computers and devices with low power consumption processors and power supplies.
• When possible, use outside air to cool the data center or computer facility.
Some organizations continually review their power usage effectiveness (PUE), which is a ratio 
that measures how much power enters the computer facility or data center against the amount 
of power required to run the computers and devices.
Sample IT Code of Conduct
 1. Technology may not be used to harm other people.
 2. Employees may not meddle in others’ ﬁles.
 3. Employees may use technology only for purposes in which they have been authorized.
 4. Technology may not be used to steal.
 5. Technology may not be used to bear false witness.
 6. Employees may not copy or use software illegally.
 7. Employees may not use others’ technology resources without authorization.
 8. Employees may not use others’ intellectual property as their own.
 9. Employees shall consider the social impact of programs and systems they design.
10. Employees always should use technology in a way that demonstrates
     consideration and respect for fellow humans.

Chapter 5  Digital Security, Ethics, and Privacy
Information Privacy
Information privacy refers to the right of individu-
als and companies to deny or restrict the ­collection, 
use, and dissemination of information about them. 
Organizations often use huge databases to store 
records, such as employee records, medical records, 
financial records, and more. Much of the data is 
personal and confidential and should be accessible 
only to authorized users. Many individuals and orga-
nizations, however, question whether this data really 
is private. That is, some companies and individuals 
collect and use this information without your autho-
rization. Websites often collect data about you, so 
that they can customize advertisements and send you 
personalized email messages. Some employers moni-
tor your computer usage and email messages.
Figure 5-23 lists measures you can take to make 
your personal data more private. The following sec-
tions address techniques companies and employers 
use to collect your personal data.

Electronic Profiles
When you fill out a printed form, such as a maga-
zine subscription or contest entry, or an online form 
to sign up for a service, create a profile on an online 
social network, or register a product warranty, the 
merchant that receives the form usually stores the 
information you ­provide in a database. Likewise, 
every time you tap or click an advertisement on the 
web or ­perform a search online, your information 
and preferences enter a database. Some merchants 
may sell or share the contents of their databases 
with national marketing firms and Internet advertis-
ing firms. By combining this data with information 
from public records, such as driver’s licenses and 
vehicle registrations, these firms can create an elec-
tronic profile of individuals. Electronic profiles may

 10. Inform merchants that you do not want them to distribute your personal
       information.
How to Safeguard Personal Information
   1. Fill in only necessary information on rebate, warranty,
       and registration forms.
   2. Do not preprint your phone number or Social
       Security number on personal checks.
   3. Have an unlisted or unpublished phone number.
   4. If you have Caller ID, ﬁnd out how to block your number from displaying
       on the receiver’s system.
   5. Do not write your phone number on charge or credit receipts.
   6. Ask merchants not to write credit card numbers, phone numbers, Social
       Security numbers, and driver’s license numbers on the back of your
       personal checks.
   7. Purchase goods with cash, rather than credit or checks.
   8. Avoid shopping club and buyer cards.
   9. If merchants ask personal questions, ﬁnd out why they want to know before
       releasing the information.
 12. Obtain your credit report once a year from each of the three major credit
       reporting agencies (Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion) and correct any errors.
 13. Request a free copy of your medical records once a year from the Medical
       Information Bureau.
 14. Limit the amount of information you provide to websites. Fill in only required
       information.
 15. Install a cookie manager to ﬁlter cookies.
 16. Clear your history ﬁle when you are ﬁnished browsing.
 17. Set up a free email account. Use this email address for merchant forms.
 18. Turn off ﬁle and printer sharing on your Internet connection.
 19. Install a personal ﬁrewall.
 20. Sign up for email ﬁltering through your ISP or use an anti-spam program.
 21. Do not reply to spam for any reason.
 22. Surf the web anonymously or through an anonymous website.

Consider This
Should you save out-of-date computers and devices?
Users should not store obsolete computers and devices in their basement, storage room, attic, warehouse, or 
any other location. Computers, monitors, and other equipment contain toxic materials and potentially dangerous 
elements including lead, mercury, and flame retardants. In a landfill, these materials release into the environment. 
Recycling and refurbishing old equipment are much safer alternatives for the environment. Manufacturers can use 
the millions of pounds of recycled raw materials to make products such as outdoor furniture and automotive parts. 
Before recycling, refurbishing, or discarding your old computer, be sure to erase, remove, or destroy its hard drive so 
that the information it stored remains private.

include personal details, such as your age, address, phone number, ­marital status, number and 
ages of dependents, interests, and spending habits.
Direct marketing supporters claim that using information in this way lowers overall ­selling 
costs, which lowers product prices. Critics contend that the information in an electronic 
­profile reveals more about an individual than anyone has a right to know. They argue that 
companies should inform people if they plan to provide personal information to others, and 
people should have the right to deny such use. Many websites allow people to specify whether 
they want their personal information shared or preferences retained (Figure 5-24).

A cookie is a small text file that a web server stores on your computer. Cookie files typically 
contain data about you, such as your user name, postal code, or viewing preferences. Websites 
use cookies for a variety of purposes:
• Most websites that allow for personalization use cookies to track user preferences. These 
cookies may obtain their values when a user fills in an online form requesting personal

• Some websites use cookies to track how often users visit a site and the webpages they visit 
while at the website.
• Websites may use cookies to target advertisements. These websites store a user’s interests and 
browsing habits in the cookie.
Consider This
Do websites ever sell information stored in cookies?
Some websites sell or trade information stored in your cookies to advertisers — a practice many believe to be 
unethical. If you do not want personal information distributed, you should limit the amount of information you 
provide to a website or adjust how your browser handles cookies. You can regularly clear cookies or set your 
browser to accept cookies automatically, prompt if you want to accept a cookie, or disable all cookie use. Keep in 
mind if you disable cookie use, you may not be able to use some e-commerce websites. As an alternative, you can 
purchase software that selectively blocks cookies.
	
Many commercial websites send a cookie to your browser; your computer’s hard drive then 
stores the cookie. The next time you visit the website, your browser retrieves the cookie from your 
hard drive and sends the data in the cookie to the website. Figure 5-25 illustrates how websites 
work with cookies. A website can read data only from its own cookie file stored on your hard drive. 
That is, it cannot access or view any other data on your hard drive — including another cookie file.
Phishing
Recall from Chapter 4 that phishing is a scam in which a perpetrator sends an official ­looking 
email message that attempts to obtain your personal and/or financial information. These 
­messages look legitimate and request that you update credit card numbers, Social Security 
­numbers, bank account numbers, passwords, or other private information. Read How To 5-4 for 
instructions about protecting yourself from phishing scams.

Protect against a Phishing Scam
Phishing scams can be perpetrated via 
email messages, websites, and even on the 
phone. The following guidelines will help 
protect you against a phishing scam.
Phone Scams
• If you receive a phone call from someone 
claiming to be from a company with which 
you do business, record his or her name and 
the time of the call. Do not disclose personal or 
financial information to the caller. If the caller is 
offering a product or service and is requesting 
a payment, call the company back at the num-
ber you have on file, and ask to be transferred 
to the person who called you initially.
• Whenever possible, enter your payment 
information on secure websites instead 
of reading credit card numbers or bank 
account information on the phone. You 
never know whether the caller is recording 
your payment information to use later for 
malicious purposes.
Email Scams
• If you receive an email message from 
­someone requesting you to verify online 
account or financial information, do not reply 
with this information.
• Never tap or click links in email messages, 
even if the message appears to be from 
someone you know. Nor should you copy 
and paste the link from the email message 
to a browser. Instead, type the link’s web 
address into a browser’s address bar man-
ually, and make sure you type it correctly. If 
you are visiting your financial institution’s 
website, make sure the web address you 
enter matches the web address you have 
on file for them.
• Do not reply to email messages asking you 
for financial assistance — even if the email 
message appears to originate from someone 
you know. If you receive this type of email 
message from someone you know, call the 
person to verify the message’s authenticity.
Website Scams
• When visiting a website, such as your 
financial institution’s website, that will require 
you to enter confidential information, be sure 
to type the web address correctly. Typing 
it incorrectly may take you to a phishing 
website where the information you enter can 
be collected by an unknown party.
• Make sure websites requiring your confi-
dential information use the https://protocol.
• Websites with misspellings, poor grammar, or 
formatting problems may indicate a phishing 
website. Do not enter personal or financial 
­information on a website that looks ­suspicious.
• Enable the phishing filter in your browser 
that can warn or block you from potentially 
fraudulent or suspicious websites.
  Consider This: Have you experienced a 
phishing scam? If so, how did it attempt to 
trick you into providing personal or financial 
information? How did you respond?
How To 5-4
Clickjacking is yet another similar scam. With clickjacking, an object that can be tapped or 
clicked — such as a button, image, or link — on a website, pop-up ad, pop-under ad, or in an 
email message or text message contains a malicious program. When a user taps or clicks the 
­disguised object, a variety of nefarious events may occur. For example, the user may be redi-
rected to a phony website that requests personal information, or a virus may download to the 
computer or mobile device. Browsers typically include clickjacking ­protection.
Spyware and Adware
Recall from Chapter 4 that spyware is a program placed on a computer or mobile device 
without the user’s knowledge that secretly collects information about the user and then commu-
nicates the information it collects to some outside source while the user is online. Some vendors 
or employers use spyware to collect information about program usage or employees. Internet 
advertising firms often collect information about users’ web browsing habits. Spyware can enter 
your computer when you install a new program, through malware, or through a graphic on a 
webpage or in an email message.
Adware is a program that displays an online advertisement in a banner, a pop-up window, or 
pop-under window on webpages, email messages, or other Internet services. Adware on mobile 
phones is known as madware, for mobile adware. Sometimes, spyware is hidden in adware.
To remove spyware and adware, you can obtain spyware removers, adware removers, or 
­malware removers that can detect and delete spyware and adware. Some operating systems and 
browsers include spyware and adware removers.
Social Engineering
As related to the use of technology, social engineering is defined as gaining unauthorized 
access to or obtaining confidential information by taking advantage of the trusting human 
nature of some victims and the naivety of others. Some social engineers trick their victims into 
revealing confidential information, such as user names and passwords, on the phone, in person, 
or on the Internet. Techniques they use include pretending to be an administrator or other

engineers also obtain information from users who do not destroy or conceal information prop-
erly. These perpetrators sift through company dumpsters, watch or film people dialing phone 
numbers or using ATMs, and snoop around computers or mobile devices looking for openly 
displayed confidential information.
To protect yourself from social engineering scams, follow these tips:
• Verify the identity of any person or organization requesting personal or confidential 
information.
• When relaying personal or confidential information, ensure that only authorized people can 
hear your conversation.
• When personal or confidential information appears on a computer or mobile device, ensure 
that only authorized people can see your screen.
• Shred all sensitive or confidential documents.
• After using a public computer, clear the cache in its browser.
• Avoid using public computers to conduct banking or other sensitive transactions.
Privacy Laws
The concern about privacy has led to the enactment of federal and state laws regarding the 
storage and disclosure of personal data, some of which are shown in Table 5-3. Common points 
in some of these laws are as follows:
 1. Information collected and stored about individuals should be limited to what is necessary to 
carry out the function of the business or government agency collecting the data.
 2. Once collected, provisions should be made to protect the data so that only those employees 
within the organization who need access to it to perform their job duties have access to it.
 3. Personal information should be released outside the organization collecting the data only 
when the person has agreed to its disclosure.
 4. When information is collected about an individual, the individual should know that the data 
is being collected and have the opportunity to determine the accuracy of the data.

Ethics & Issues 5-3
Do You Have the Right to Be Digitally 
Forgotten?
Privacy experts, such as The Institute 
for Responsible Online and Cell-Phone 
Communication (IROC2), warn that “Your 
digital activity is public and permanent” and 
is available permanently to anyone using a 
search engine. Does it have to be? Do you 
have a “right to be forgotten” as was ruled 
by a court in the European Union recently?
In this case, the court ordered a popular 
search engine to remove links to information 
that was “inadequate, irrelevant, or no 
longer relevant.” The content in question 
included many factual articles published by 
a major news source. Examples included 
stories about a university student arrested for 
driving while intoxicated and a referee who 
lied about a mistake. Free speech advocates 
criticize the law. They state that a government 
should not be able to deny access to 
accurate information. Others argue that a 
person should be able to request removal of 
information that is damaging to his or her 
reputation. Some are concerned that negative 
incidents may be necessary information for an 
employer to know about a job seeker, or for 
those considering a relationship with another 
person. You can never truly delete your digital 
footprint because everything you do online 
has the potential to be forwarded, captured 
as a screenshot, or archived in databases.
Among the debated issues is whether the 
rights of a private citizen should differ from 
those of a public figure. Many argue that 
different rules apply for celebrities, politicians, 
and others who choose such professions. 
Some feel that the responsibility rests on 
search engines to provide methods that enable 
individuals to comment on, explain, or select 
what information is displayed when they are 
the subject of an Internet search. For example, 
Google developed the Google Inactive Account 
Manager, where you can specify what happens 
to your data after a period of inactivity.
Consider This: Does a government have 
a right to legislate search engine links? 
Why or why not? In what, if any, ­situations 
should individuals be able to request 
removal of digital content? Should search 
engines provide users with tools to control 
what information about them appears? 
Why or why not?
Consider This
Do employers have the right to read employee email messages?
Actual policies vary widely. Some organizations declare that they will review email messages regularly, and others 
state that email messages are private. In some states, if a company does not have a formal email policy, it can read 
email messages without employee notification.
	
Employee Monitoring
Employee monitoring involves the use of computers, mobile devices, or cameras to observe, 
record, and review an employee’s use of a technology, including communications such as email 
messages, keyboard activity (used to measure productivity), and websites visited. Many programs 
exist that easily allow employers to monitor employees. Further, it is legal for employers to use 
these programs.
Content Filtering
One of the more controversial issues that surround the Internet is its widespread availability of 
objectionable material, such as prejudiced literature, violence, and obscene photos. Some believe 
that such materials should be banned. Others believe that the materials should be filtered, that 
is, restricted.
Content filtering is the process of restricting access to certain material. Many businesses 
use content filtering to limit employees’ web access. These businesses argue that ­employees 
are unproductive when visiting inappropriate or objectionable websites. Some schools, 
­libraries, and parents use content filtering to restrict access to minors. Content filtering 
opponents argue that banning any materials violates constitutional guarantees of free speech 
and personal rights. Read Ethics & Issues 5-4 to consider whether content filtering violates 
first amendment rights.

Web filtering software is a program that restricts access to specified websites. Some also 
filter sites that use specific words (Figure 5-26). Others allow you to filter email messages, 
chat rooms, and programs. Many Internet security programs include a firewall, antivirus 
­program, and filtering capabilities combined. Browsers also often include content filtering 
capabilities.
Ethics & Issues 5-4
Does Content Filtering in a Public 
Library Violate First Amendment 
Rights?
Among the resources libraries offer are 
Internet-enabled computers. The use of con-
tent filtering software on library computers 
controls the type of information a patron can 
access. Free speech advocates argue that 
this violates the First Amendment because it 
restricts library patrons from viewing certain 
websites and content.
The Children’s Internet Protection Act 
(CIPA) requires that schools and libraries use 
content filtering software in order to receive 
certain federal funds. The purpose of CIPA is 
to restrict access to objectionable material, 
protect children when communicating online, 
prohibit children from sharing personal 
information, and restrict children’s identities 
or accounts being hacked. Proponents of CIPA 
claim it is necessary to protect children. CIPA 
does allow libraries to turn off the filters, if an 
adult patrons requests it. Some libraries use 
content filtering software on computers used 
only by children.
Critics of content filtering software argue 
that the programs do not always work as 
intended. They can overfilter content, blocking 
information or education websites based on 
a single word. Some websites and services 
that filtering software may block include 
online social networks, or software platforms, 
such as Google Drive, which students may 
need to access to submit assignments. 
Conversely, they can underfilter content, 
which could result in access to webpages 
with inappropriate media. Others argue that 
it gives unequal access to students doing 
research who rely on library computers to do 
schoolwork and those who have unfiltered 
Internet access at home.
Libraries typically have a policy stating 
acceptable use of the Internet. Libraries’ policies 
also should state whether they use content 
filtering software, so that the patrons are aware.
Consider This: Is it fair for a government 
to require that libraries use content filtering 
software? Why or why not? Do free speech 
laws cover content on the Internet? Why or 
why not?

National and Local Security
Since 2001, the federal government, local 
governments, businesses, and individuals have 
been implementing aggressive new security 
measures because of the increase in terrorist 
activity. A security threat can exist anywhere, 
and it is nearly impossible for humans alone 
to protect the country. As a result, technology 
now assists governments, law enforcement 
officials, business owners, and other individu-
als with monitoring and maintaining security.
Advancements in computer vision enable 
computers to monitor indoor and outdoor 
areas that might be subject to a high volume 
of criminal activity. For example, some cities 
are installing cameras in problematic areas. 
A program analyzes the output from the 
camera and can determine whether two or 
more people in close proximity to one another 
might be engaged in a physical confrontation. 
If the computer detects suspicious behavior, it 
automatically notifies local law enforcement.
Computers also use facial recognition to 
identify individuals who do not belong in a 
particular area. For example, one theme park 
takes a picture of individuals they escort out of 
and ban from the park. As visitors walk from 
their cars to the park, surveillance cameras 
positioned in strategic locations scan visitors’ 
faces and compare them with the database 
containing images of those who are banned 
from the park. If the computer finds a match, it 
alerts a security officer who then can investigate 
the situation. Thousands of people visit theme 
parks each day, and computers make it easier to 
perform the otherwise impossible 
task of identifying those who 
might be trespassing.
The federal government, 
particularly the Department 
of Homeland Security, uses 
a computerized No Fly List 
to track individuals who are 
not authorized to travel on 
commercial flights within 
the United States. When an 
individual makes a reservation, 
a computer compares his or her 
name to the names on the No Fly List. If the 
computer finds a match, the individual must 
prove that he or she is not the person on the 
list before being allowed to board an aircraft.
Whether you are walking outside, visiting 
an attraction, or traveling, the chances are 
good that computers are, in some way, 
ensuring your safety.
   Consider This: In what other ways 
do computers and technology play a role in 
national and local security?

 Problem Solving
Personal
1.	No Browsing History  While using the browser on 
your tablet, you realize that it is not keeping a history 
of websites you have visited. Why might this be 
happening, and what is the first step you will take to 
correct this problem?
2.	Phishing Scam  You just received an email message from 
someone requesting personal identification information. 
Believing the message 
was legitimate, 
you provided the 
requested information 
to the original sender. 
You now realize, 
however, that you might 
have fallen victim to a 
phishing scam. What are 
your next steps?
3.	Suspicious File Attachment  You receive an email 
message that appears to be from someone you know. 
When you try to open the attachment, nothing 
happens. You attempt to open the attachment two 
more times without any success. Several minutes later, 
your computer is running slower and you are having 
trouble running apps. What might be wrong?
4.	Antivirus Software Outdated  After starting your 
computer and signing in to the operating system, a message 
is displayed stating that your virus definitions are out of 
date and need to be updated. What are your next steps?
5.	Laptop’s Physical Security  You plan to start taking 
your laptop to school so that you can record notes 
in class. You want to make sure, however, that your 
computer is safe if you ever step away from it for a brief 
period of time. What steps can you take to ensure the 
physical security of your laptop?
Professional
6.	Corporate Firewall Interference  You installed a 
new browser on your work computer because you no 
longer wish to use the default browser provided with the 
operating system. When you run the new browser, an error 
message appears stating that a user name and password are 
required to configure the firewall and allow this program 
to access the Internet. Why has this happened?
7.	Problems with CAPTCHA  You are signing up for an 
account on a website and encounter a CAPTCHA. You 
attempt to type the characters you see on the screen, but 
an error message appears stating that you have entered 
the incorrect characters. You try two more times and get 
the same result. You are typing the characters to the best 
of your ability but think you still might be misreading at 
least one of the characters. What are your next steps?
8.	Unclear Acceptable Use Policy  You read your 
company’s acceptable use policy, but it is not clear about 
whether you are able to use the computer in your office 
to visit news websites on your lunch break. How can 
you determine whether this type of activity is allowed?
9.	Two-Step Verification Problem  A website you are 
attempting to access requires two-step verification. In 
addition to entering your password, you also have to 
enter a code that it sends to you as a text message. You no 
longer have the same phone number, so you are unable 
to receive the text message. What are your next steps?
10.	Issue with Virus Protection  You receive a notification 
that the antivirus program on your computer is not 
enabled. While attempting to enable the antivirus 
program, an error message is displayed stating that a 
problem has prevented the antivirus program from 
being enabled. What are your next steps?
The Problem Solving exercises extend your knowledge of chapter concepts by seeking ­solutions 
to practical problems with technology that you may encounter at home, school, work, or with 
nonprofit organizations. The Collaboration exercise should be completed with a team.
Instructions: You often can solve problems with technology in multiple ways. Determine a solution to the problems in these exercises by using 
one or more resources available to you (such as a computer or mobile device, articles on the web or in print, blogs, podcasts, videos, television, user 
guides, other individuals, electronics or computer stores, etc.). Describe your solution, along with the resource(s) used, in the format requested by 
your instructor (brief report, presentation, discussion, blog post, video, or other means).

Collaboration
11.	Technology in National and Local Security  National and local security agencies often use technology to protect 
citizens. For example, computers are used to maintain a No Fly List, which contains a list of individuals not cleared to 
board a commercial aircraft. Form a team of three people to create a list of the various ways technology helps to keep 
the public safe. One team member should research how local agencies, such as police departments, use technology to 
ensure security. Another team member should research ways national security agencies use technology to protect the 
public from threats, and the last team member should research ways that private businesses use technology to enhance 
security. Compile these findings into a report and submit it to your instructor.

1	 Evaluating Your Electronic Profile
When you make purchases online, tap or click advertise-
ments, follow links, and complete online forms requesting 
information about yourself, you are adding to your elec-
tronic profile. While an electronic profile may help busi-
nesses guide you toward products and services that are 
of interest to you, some people view them as an invasion 
of privacy. The following steps guide you through the 
process of locating online information about yourself and 
taking steps to remove the information, if possible.
a. Run a browser.
b. Navigate to a search engine of your choice.
c. Perform a search for your full name.
d. In the search results, follow a link that you feel 
will display a webpage containing information 
about you. If the link’s destination does not contain 
information about you, navigate back to the search 
results and follow another link.
e. Evaluate the webpage that contains information 
about you. If you wish to try removing the 
information, locate a link that allows you to contact 
the site owner(s) or automatically request removal 
of the information.
f. Request that your information be removed from 
the website. Some websites may not honor 
your request for removal. If you feel that the 
information must be removed, you may need 
to solicit legal advice.
g. If the search results display information from 
an account you have on an online social 
network, such as Facebook or LinkedIn, you 
may need to adjust your privacy settings 
so that the information is not public. If the 
privacy settings do not allow you to hide 
your information, you may need to consider 
deleting the account.
h. Repeat Steps d – g for the remaining search 
results. When you no longer see relevant 
search results for the search engine you used, 
search for other variations of your name (use 
your middle initial instead of your middle 
name, exclude your middle name, or consider 
using commonly used nicknames instead of your 
first name).
i. Use other search engines to search for different 
variations of your name. Some search engines 
uncover results that others do not.
j. If you have an account on an online social network, 
navigate to the website’s home page and, without 
signing in, search for your name. If information 
appears that you do not want to be public, you may 
need to adjust your privacy settings or remove your 
account.
k. Follow up with requests you have made to remove 
your online information.
Exercises
1. What personal information have you uncovered 
online? Did you have any idea that the information 
was there?
2. What additional steps can you take to prevent people 
and businesses from storing information about you?
3. What steps might you be able to take if you are 
unsuccessful with your attempts to remove online 
information that identifies you?

2	 Update Virus Definitions
In addition to installing or activating an antivirus 
­program on your computer or mobile device to keep it 
safe from viruses, it also is necessary to keep the virus 
definitions updated so that the antivirus program can 
search for and detect new viruses on your computer or 
mobile device. New virus definitions can be released as 
often as once per day, depending on the number of new 
viruses that are ­created. Antivirus programs either can 
search for and install new virus definitions automati-
cally at specified intervals, or you can update the virus 
signatures manually. The following steps describe how to 
update the virus definitions for an antivirus program.
Update Virus Definitions Manually
a. If necessary, establish an Internet connection so 
that you will be able to update the virus definitions.
b. Run an antivirus program.
c. Tap or click the button to check for updated virus 
definitions.
d. If new virus definitions are available for the 
antivirus program, tap or click the link to download 
the definitions to the computer or mobile device.
e. When the update is complete, tap or click the button 
to scan the computer or mobile device for viruses.
Configure Automatic Updates for Virus Definitions
a. If necessary, establish an Internet connection so 
that you will be able to update the virus definitions.
b. Run an antivirus program.
c. Tap or click the option to update virus definitions 
automatically.
d. Tap or click the option to display the virus 
definition update schedule.
e. To provide the maximum protection from viruses, 
configure the antivirus program to update 
definitions as frequently as possible.
f. After configuring the update schedule, tap or click 
the button to update virus definitions manually.
g. When the update is complete, tap or click the button 
to scan the computer or mobile device for viruses.
Exercises
1. What antivirus program, if any, currently is installed 
on your computer? Is it scheduled to update virus 
definitions automatically?
2. In addition to downloading and installing virus 
definitions from within the antivirus program, 
are other ways available to obtain the latest virus 
definitions?
3. In addition to keeping the antivirus program’s virus 
definitions current, what other ways can you protect a 
computer or mobile device from viruses?
3	 Determine Whether a Computer or Mobile 
Device Is Secured Properly
Several steps are required to secure a computer or mobile 
device properly. In addition to installing antivirus software 
and updating the virus definitions regularly, you also should 
install and configure a firewall, keep the operating system 
up to date, and be careful not to open suspicious email 
messages, visit unsecure webpages, or download untrusted 
files while using the Internet. The following steps guide 
you through the process of making sure your computer 
or mobile device is secured properly by verifying antivirus 
software is installed and running, a firewall is enabled and 
configured, and the operating system is up to date.
Verify Antivirus Software
a. Use the search tool in the operating system or scan 
the programs on the computer or mobile device for 
antivirus software. Some operating systems include 
antivirus software.
b. If you are unable to locate antivirus software on 
the computer or mobile device, obtain an antivirus 
program and install it.
c. Run the antivirus program.
d. Verify the virus definitions in the antivirus program 
are up to date.
Verify the Firewall
a. Use the search tool in the operating system or scan 
the programs, apps, and settings on the computer or 
mobile device to access and configure the firewall.
b. If you are unable to locate a firewall on the 
computer or mobile device, obtain a firewall 
program and install it.
c. Run the firewall program.
d. View the firewall settings and verify the firewall is 
turned on.
e. View the list of programs, apps, and features 
allowed through the firewall. If you do not 
recognize or use one or more of the programs, 
apps, or features, remove them from the list of 
allowed programs, apps, and features.

4	 Clear Your Browsing History
A browser keeps track of the webpages that you have 
visited previously unless you have changed your set-
tings. Although you can clear the browsing history on 
your computer or mobile device, your Internet service 
provider still may have logs that show a history of web-
sites you have visited. The following steps guide you 
through the process of clearing your browsing history.
a. Run the browser.
b. Display the browser’s settings.
c. If necessary, navigate to the settings that configure 
the browser’s security settings. These settings often 
are found in the Security, Safety, or Privacy category.
d. Select the option to delete the browsing history. In 
addition to deleting the list of websites you have 
visited, you also may be able to clear passwords 
the browser has remembered, clear cookies and 
temporary internet files, clear data you entered in 
forms, and clear a history of downloads.
e. When the browsing history has been deleted, run 
the browser again.
f. Follow the above steps for each additional browser 
you have installed on your computer or mobile device.
Exercises
1. What are some reasons why you might want to delete 
your browsing history?
2. Can you configure your browser to automatically 
delete your browsing history? If so, how?
3. What are the advantages of keeping your browsing 
history? If you do keep your browsing history, how 
long do you keep it?
5	 Configure a Browser’s Cookie Settings
As discussed in this chapter, cookies can be used for 
a ­variety of reasons. Websites can install cookies on 
your computer or mobile device that can store infor-
mation on your computer or mobile device, or track 
your browsing habits. You can configure a browser’s 
settings to disallow websites from storing and access-
ing cookies on your computer or mobile device. The 
following steps guide you through the process of con-
figuring a browser’s cookie settings.
a. Run the browser.
b. Display the browser’s settings.
c. Navigate to the settings that configure the 
browser’s cookie settings. These settings often are 
found in the Security, Safety, or Privacy category.
d. Configure how the browser handles first-party 
cookies and third-party cookies. Some users choose 
to reject all cookies. To function properly, however, 
some websites require that you accept their cookies.
e. Save the changes to the settings.
f. Run the browser again.
Exercises
1. What is the difference between first-party cookies and 
third-party cookies?
2. Configure the browser to deny all first-party and 
third-party cookies and then navigate to five websites 
you visit most frequently. Do the websites display 
any differently now that you are denying all cookies? 
Describe your browsing experience while the browser 
is configured to deny all cookies.
3. What security risks are associated with cookies?

1	 Making Use of the Web 
News, Weather, and Sports
Apps on tablets, smartphones, and other mobile devices 
are changing the delivery of the day’s major news, weather, 
and sports stories. In one study, approximately one-half of 
American adults reported that they get some of their news 
on a tablet or mobile device. They view video and photos 
from eyewitnesses and fans, read analyses from investi-
gators and coaches, and comment on stories. Men and 
college-educated people are the heaviest users of mobile 
news websites, and they are likely to read in-depth inves-
tigations and analyses. Online social networks also are a 
major source of information for many people.
Research This: (a) Visit two news websites or apps 
and locate one national event covered in both sources. 
Compare the coverage of the two stories. What 
information is provided in addition to the text, such 
as video, graphics, or links to related articles? Which 
story offers a better analysis? Which source is easier 
to navigate and read? Then, using another website or 
app, locate and read today’s top international news 
story. What did you learn by reading the story? Were 
you aware of this event prior to reading the online 
story? Does the coverage include videos and photos to 
increase your comprehension?
(b) Visit a weather website or app and obtain the five-
day forecast for your hometown. Include details about 
information that supplements the current and forecast 
conditions, such as a pollen or air quality index, storm 
tracking, travel advisories, or season summaries.
(c) Visit a sports website or app and read the first 
story reported. Describe the coverage of this event. 
Which sources are quoted in the story? Which links 
are included to other stories? Describe the features 
provided on this website, such as the ability to chat, 
customize the page for your favorite teams, or share 
the content with media sharing sites.
2	 Social Media
Sharing photos on your social media sites of 
­yesterday’s visit to the ballpark might be at the top 
of today’s to-do list, but these images might be just 
the clues cyberthieves need to access your account. 
Facebook, in particular, is one website that scammers 
and advertisers use to gather information regarding 
your whereabouts and your personal life. Their mali-
cious attacks begin with a visit to your timeline or 
other record of your activities. Searching for keywords 
on your page, they send targeted messages appearing 
to originate from trusted friends. If you open their 
attachments or tap or click their links, you have given 
these unscrupulous individuals access to your account. 
In addition, you may think you have crafted a pass-
word no one could guess. With your page open for 
others to view, however, the thieves scour the contents 
in hopes of locating starting clues, such as children’s 
names, anniversary dates, and pet breeds, which could 
be hints to cracking your password.
Research This: In the Help section of an online social 
network you use, search for information about changing 
your profile’s security and privacy settings. What steps 
can you take to mitigate the chance of becoming the vic-
tim of a hack? For example, can you adjust the connec-
tion settings to restrict who can see stories, send friend 
requests and messages, or search for you by name or 
contact information? Can you hide certain posts or block 
people from posting on your page? Can you report 
posts if they violate the website’s terms? What are other 
potential threats to someone accessing your account?
3	 Search Skills 
Social Media Search
Search engines provide access to millions of search 
results by finding webpages, documents, images, or

other information that match the search text you pro-
vide. Recommendations from people who use social 
media to share what they have read can be a possible 
alternative to using a search engine. People who take 
the time to Tweet pin an article or image on Twitter 
or Pinterest often do so because they found it useful, 
and hope others will as well.
To search Twitter, type the search text, search twitter, 
in a search engine to find the web address for the Twitter 
Search website, or sign in to Twitter with your creden-
tials. In the Search Twitter text box, type the search text. 
For example, type the text, best mapping app, to find 
recommendations of links to articles or websites about 
mapping apps. You also can search Twitter for hashtags 
(a keyword preceded by a # symbol) to find Tweets 
about current events or popular discussion topics.
To search Pinterest, sign in to your Pinterest 
­account and then type the search text into the search 
box. For example, type the search text, information 
security, into the search box to view related pins from 
Pinterest users. Pinterest users often pin links to 
­infographics, images, and websites.
Research This: Use Twitter and Pinterest to search 
for information about the following topics and then 
compare your results with those you would find using 
a search engine such as Bing, Google, or Yahoo!.  
(1) green computing, (2) computer virus, (3) cyber-
crime, and (4) malware. How are the results different? 
What type of information are you more likely to find 
on Twitter, on Pinterest, and using a search engine?
4	 Security
Digital certificates and signatures detect a sender’s 
identity and verify a document’s authenticity. In this 
chapter you learned that many e-commerce com-
panies use them in an attempt to prevent digital 
eavesdroppers from intercepting confidential informa-
tion. The online certificate authority (CA) vendors 
generate these certificates using a standard, called 
X.509, which is coordinated by the International 
Telecommunication Union and uses algorithms and 
encryption technology to identify the documents.
Research This: Visit websites of at least two companies 
that issue digital certificates. Compare products offered, 
prices, and certificate features. What length of time is 
needed to issue a certificate? What is a green address bar, 
and when is one issued? What business or organization 
validation is required? Then, visit websites of at least two 
companies that provide digital signatures. Compare sign-
ing and sending requirements, types of supported signa-
tures, and available security features. Which documents 
are required to obtain a digital signature? When would 
a business need a Class 2 rather than a Class 3 digital 
­signature?
5	 Cloud Services
Cloud Security (SecaaS)
Antivirus software offers regular, automatic updates 
in order to protect a server, computer, or device from 
viruses, malware, or other attacks. Antivirus software 
is an example of cloud security, or security as a service 
(SecaaS), a service of cloud computing that ­delivers 
virus definitions and security software to users over 
the Internet as updates become available, with no 
intervention from users. Security as a service is a 
­special case of software as a service, but is limited to 
security software solutions.
Individuals and enterprise users take advantage of 
antivirus software and security updates. Enterprise 
cloud users interact with cloud security solutions 
via a web interface to configure apps that provide 
protection to email servers, preventing spam before 
it arrives, keeping data secure, and watching for 
online threats and viruses. As the use of cloud-based 
­resources continues, the market for security as a ser-
vice solutions is expected to increase significantly in 
coming years.
Research This: (1) Use a search engine to find two 
different providers of security as a service solutions. 
­Research the different solutions they provide, and 
report your findings.  (2) How are enterprise security 
requirements different from those of individual users?

Chapter 5  Digital Security, Ethics, And Privacy
Critical Thinking
4.	Implementing Biometric Security You are the chief technology officer of a large 
company. You have been reading an article about computer security that discussed 
several examples of security breaches, including thieves breaking into an office and 
stealing expensive equipment, and a recently terminated employee gaining access 
to the office after hours and corrupting data. Because of these incidents, your 
company would like to start using biometric devices to increase its security.
Do This: Form a three-member team and research the use of biometric devices 
to protect equipment and data. Each member of your team should choose a differ-
ent type of biometric device, such as fingerprint readers, face recognition systems, 
and hand geometry systems. Find products for each device type, and research costs 
and user reviews. Search for articles by industry experts. Would you recommend 
using the biometric device for security purposes? Why or why not? Meet with 
your team, discuss and compile your findings, and then share with the class.
Instructions: Evaluate the situations below, using personal experiences and one or more resources available to you (such as articles on the web or in 
print, blogs, podcasts, videos, television, user guides, other individuals, electronics or computer stores, etc.). Perform the tasks requested in each ­exercise 
and share your deliverables in the format requested by your instructor (brief report, presentation, discussion, blog post, video, or other means).
The Critical Thinking exercises challenge your assessment and decision-making skills by 
presenting real-world situations associated with chapter concepts. The Collaboration 
exercise should be completed with a team.
1.	Online Gaming Safety 
You and your friend frequently play a popular online 
role-playing game. Your friend’s computer had a virus 
recently, which was traced back to a malware-infected 
website. Your friend tells you that she visited the website 
after following a link while playing the game. What 
risks are involved when playing online games?
Do This: Use the web to find articles about incidents 
of malware infections associated with online gaming. 
Research tips for increasing security when playing 
online games. Did you find other threats and security 
tips in addition to the ones mentioned in this chapter? 
Have you ever downloaded updates to a game? If so, 
how did you ensure the updates were safe? Locate a list 
of games that are known to cause malware infections. 
Share your findings and any online gaming security 
problems you have experienced with the class.
2.	Ensuring Safety and Security Online 
You work in the information technology department 
for a large enterprise. An increasing number of users 
are contacting the help desk complaining about slow 
computer performance. Help desk representatives 
frequently attribute the decreased performance to 
malware. Although the help desk has installed security 
software on each computer, users also must practice 
safe computing. Your manager asked you to prepare 
information that teaches employees how to guard 
against malware and other security threats.
Do This: Include information such as how to 
­determine if a website is safe, how to identify email 
and other spoofing schemes, guidelines for down-
loading programs and apps, email attachment safety, 
and how to avoid phishing scams. Create a list of 
how organizations use common safeguards to protect 
other users on the network, such as firewalls, proxy 
servers, user names and passwords, access controls, 
and audit trails.
3.	Case Study
Amateur Sports League You are the new manager 
for a nonprofit amateur soccer league. The league’s board 
of directors asked you to develop a disaster recovery plan 
for its main office. The main office consists of a small 
storefront with two back rooms: one room is the office, 
with all of the electronic equipment and paper files; the 
other is for storage of nonelectronic equipment. The 
staff ­members — you, an administrative assistant, and 
an information technology (IT) specialist — work in the 
office. The electronic equipment in the office includes 
two desktops, a laptop, an external hard drive for backups, 
a wireless router, and two printers. In addition, each staff 
member has a smartphone.
Do This: Choose either a natural or man-made 
disaster. Create a disaster recovery plan that outlines 
emergency strategies, backup procedures, recovery 
steps, and a test plan. Assign staff members roles for 
each phase of the disaster recovery plan.

1943 During World War II, British 
scientist Alan Turing designs the Colossus, 
an electronic computer created for the 
military to break German codes. The 
computer’s existence is kept secret until 
the 1970s.
1946 Dr. John W. Mauchly 
and J. Presper Eckert, Jr. 
complete work on the 
first large-scale electronic, 
general-purpose digital 
computer. The ENIAC 
(Electronic Numerical 
Integrator And Computer) 
weighs 30 tons, contains 
18,000 vacuum tubes, 
occupies a 30 3 50 foot 
space, and consumes 160 
kilowatts of power. 
1951 The first commercially available 
electronic digital computer, the UNIVAC I 
(UNIVersal Automatic Computer), is 
introduced by Remington Rand. Public 
awareness of computers increases 
when the UNIVAC I correctly predicts 
that Dwight D. Eisenhower will win the 
presidential election.
1953 Core memory, developed 
in the early 1950s, provides much 
larger storage capacity than 
vacuum tube memory. 
1953 The IBM model 650 
is one of the first widely used 
computers. The computer is so 
successful that IBM manufactures 
more than 1,000. IBM will 
dominate the mainframe market 
for the next decade.
1937 Dr. John V. Atanasoff and Clifford 
Berry design and build the first electronic 
digital computer. Their machine, the 
Atanasoff-Berry-Computer, or ABC, 
provides the foundation for advances  
in electronic digital computers.
1945 John von Neumann poses in 
front of the electronic computer built 
at the Institute for Advanced Study. 
This computer and its von Neumann 
architecture served as the prototype for 
subsequent stored program computers 
worldwide.
1947 William Shockley, John Bardeen, 
and Walter Brattain invent the transfer 
resistance device, eventually called 
the transistor. The transistor would 
revolutionize computers, proving much 
more reliable than vacuum tubes.
1952 Dr. Grace Hopper 
considers the concept of 
reusable software in her 
paper, “The Education 
of a Computer.” The 
paper describes how 
to program a computer 
with symbolic notation 
instead of detailed 
machine language.

Reset button after the 50th boot of 
an infected disk.
1969 Under pressure from the 
industry, IBM announces that 
some of its software will be priced 
separately from the computer 
hardware, allowing software firms 
to emerge in the industry.
1975 MITS, Inc. advertises one of 
the first microcomputers, the Altair. 
The Altair is sold in kits for less than 
$400, and within the first three 
months 4,000 orders are taken.
1976 Steve Jobs and Steve 
Wozniak build the first Apple 
computer. A subsequent 
version, the Apple II, is an 
immediate success. Adopted 
by elementary schools, high 
schools, and colleges, for 
many students, the Apple II 
is their first contact with the 
world of computers.
1980 IBM offers Microsoft 
Corporation cofounder, Bill 
Gates, the opportunity to

Objectives
Inside the Case
Whether you are a home user or a business user, you most likely will purchase a new computer 
or mobile device, or upgrade an existing computer at some time in the future. Thus, you should 
understand the purpose of each component in a computer or mobile device. As Chapter 1 dis-
cussed, computers and mobile devices include components that are used for input, processing, 
output, storage, and communications. Many of these components are inside the case that con-
tains and protects the electronics of the computer or mobile device from damage. These cases, 
which are made of metal or plastic, are available in a variety of shapes and sizes (Figure 6-1).
• Recall that the term, system unit (or chassis), refers to the case on a desktop that contains and 
protects the motherboard, hard drive, memory, and other electronic components. Some 
desktops have a tower system unit that is a device separate from the monitor. Others that 
house the display and the system unit in the same case are called an all-in-one. Peripheral 
devices normally occupy space outside the system unit and communicate with the system unit 
using wired or wireless technology.
• On most laptops, including ultrathin laptops, the keyboard and pointing device often occupy 
the area on top of the case, and the display attaches to the case by hinges.
• With a slate tablet, which typically does not include a physical keyboard, the case is behind the 
display. Keyboard options for slate tablets include an on-screen keyboard, a wireless keyboard, or 
a keyboard that attaches to the slate via a clip, magnets, or other mechanism. On a convertible 
tablet, by contrast, the case is positioned below a keyboard, providing functionality similar to a 
laptop. The difference is that the display attaches to the case with a swivel-type hinge, enabling 
the user to rotate the display and fold it down over the keyboard to look like a slate tablet.
• With game consoles, the input and output devices, such as controllers and a television, reside 
outside the case.
• Like a slate tablet, the case on a smartphone often is behind the display.
• The case on wearable devices, portable media players, digital cameras, and handheld game 
devices typically consumes the entire device and houses the display and input devices.

The Motherboard
The motherboard, sometimes called a system board, is the main circuit board of the 
­computer. Many electronic components, such as the processor and memory, attach to the 
motherboard; others are built into it. Figure 6-3 shows photos of current desktop and laptop 
motherboards.
On personal computers, the circuitry for the processor, memory, and other components reside 
on a computer chip(s). A computer chip is a small piece of semiconducting material, usually 
silicon, on which integrated circuits are etched. An integrated circuit contains many microscopic 
pathways capable of carrying electrical current. Each integrated circuit can contain millions 
of elements such as resistors, capacitors, and transistors. A transistor, for example, can act as an 
electronic switch that opens or closes the circuit for electrical charges. Today’s computer chips 
contain millions or billions of transistors.
Most chips are no bigger than one-half-inch square. Manufacturers package chips so that the 
chips can be attached to a circuit board, such as a motherboard.

Securing Computers and Mobile 
Devices
Millions of smartphones, mobile devices, and 
computers are stolen in the United States 
every year, but only a small percent of these 
devices are recovered. Many devices can 
help deter potential thieves and also help 
trace and recover stolen goods. The follow-
ing products may be useful in securing and 
tracking hardware.
• Clamps, cables, and locks: Lock  
kits include mounting plates, glue, 
cables, and padlocks to protect desk-
tops, monitors, laptops, and peripheral 
devices.
• Ultrasonic sensors: Thieves do not 
need to remove a computer from an 
office building or school to commit their 
crimes; instead, they can open the case 
on a desktop or server on site and then 
remove a hard drive or other expensive 
component. To prevent such tampering, 
hardware manufacturers have developed 
an alarm system to install in the case. If the 
computer is moved or the case is opened, 
an ear-piercing alarm sounds and a security 
company is alerted.
• Tracking software: Many smartphones 
and mobile devices have software that 
shows the approximate location of devices 
and computers. The owner can issue com-
mands remotely to have the device play a 
sound, lock the screen, display a message, 
or erase all personal information.
• Asset tags: Metal security plates affixed 
to hardware contain unique bar codes that 
are registered to the owner and are stored 
in a security company’s database. If a lost 
or stolen device is recov-
ered, the finder can call 
the phone number on the 
tag, and the company 
will notify the owner.
• Personal safes: 
Protective cases that are 
approximately the size of 
a cereal box can store a 
smartphone, keys, tablet, 
and other valuables. The 
attached security cable 
can be secured to a stationary object, such 
as a chair or table. Some personal safes 
have built-in electronic locks; others can be 
secured with a combination lock. The safe 
can be useful in a hotel room, at the gym, 
or on campus.
  Consider This: Have you seen any of 
these security devices at school or at busi-
nesses? If so, where? Do you know someone 
whose computer or mobile device was lost or 
stolen? If so, was the hardware recovered? 
What other measures can organizations take 
to prevent security breaches?

Chapter 6  Computing Components
Processors
The processor, also called the central processing unit (CPU), interprets and carries out 
the basic instructions that operate a computer. The processor significantly impacts overall 
­computing power and manages most of a computer’s operations. On larger computers, such as 
mainframes and supercomputers, the various functions performed by the processor extend over 
many separate chips and often multiple circuit boards. On a personal computer, all functions of 
the processor usually are on a single chip. Some computer and chip manufacturers use the term 
microprocessor to refer to a personal computer processor chip.
Most processor chip manufacturers now offer multi-core processors. A processor core, or 
simply core, contains the circuitry necessary to execute instructions. The operating system views 
each processor core as a separate processor. A multi-core processor is a single chip with two 
or more separate processor cores. Multi-core processors are used in all sizes of computers. Read

Chip Implants Secure Animals’ Identity
The search for lost dogs or cats can be 
traumatic for their owners. The animals’ safe 
return home may be based on data stored 
on a chip that veterinarians have implanted 
under the skin, usually at the neck or shoul-
der blades.
The chip — sometimes called a microchip 
because it is so small (about the size of a 
grain of rice) — has a unique number that is 
registered to the owner’s name and address. 
It contains an antenna and transponder 
encased in a glass tube. The antenna 
receives low-frequency radio waves when a 
scanning device passes over the chip, and the 
transponder sends a signal with the chip’s 
number back to the scanner.
Shelters and animal control centers 
routinely scan runaway pets for chips in an 
attempt to reunite animals with their owners. 
Most shelters require pets to have the implant 
before the animals are adopted or before a 
once-lost pet is returned to its owner. Some 
veterinarians also scan new pets for chips 
to ensure the animal does not belong to 
someone else.
Some pet owners are concerned that 
microchipping can cause health problems, 
particularly if the chip moves from its original 
injection site. Most humane societies and 
veterinarians, however, state that no long-
term adverse health effects or discomfort 
occurs.
Microchips also are implanted or attached 
externally in other animals, including 
horses, elephants, cows, birds, fish, lizards, 
and snakes. Breeders, farmers, and animal 
associations implant the chips to deter 
thieves. Chips also can monitor an animal’s 
temperature, so that a farmer can prevent the 
spread of disease by identifying and removing 
an ill animal from a herd.
Researchers, including those at the U.S. Fish 
and Wildlife Service, also use this technology 
to track migration of wild animals, reptiles, 
and fish. They study how these species interact 
with their environment, and conservation 
authorities can identify endangered species, 
such as sea turtles, that have been confiscated 
from smugglers.
  Consider This: Do you have or know 
anyone who has a pet that has been 
implanted with a chip? If so, why do you 
think they did it? Besides possible health 
problems, why might some people oppose 
mandatory animal chipping? Do you think 
people someday might choose to have a 
chip implanted to eliminate the need to carry 
­identification? Why or why not?
Consider This
Are multi-core processors better than single-core processors?
Each processor core on a multi-core processor generally runs at a slower speed than a single-core processor, but 
multi-core processors typically increase overall performance. For example, although a dual-core processor does not 
double the processing speed of a single-core processor, it can approach those speeds. The performance increase is 
especially noticeable when users are running multiple programs simultaneously, such as antivirus software, spyware 
remover, email program, Internet messaging, media player, and photo editing software. Multi-core processors also 
are more energy efficient than separate multiple processors, requiring lower levels of power consumption and 
emitting less heat inside the case.

Processors, Memory, the Cloud, and More  Chapter 6	
281
Processors contain a control unit and 
an arithmetic logic unit (ALU). These 
two components work together to per-
form processing operations. Figure 6-4 
illustrates how other devices connected 
to the computer communicate with the 
processor to carry out a task. When a 
user runs an application, for example, its 
instructions transfer from a storage device 
to memory. Data needed by programs 
and applications enters memory from 
either an input device or a storage device. 
The control unit interprets and executes 
instructions in memory, and the arithme-
tic logic unit performs calculations on the 
data in memory. Resulting information 
is stored in memory, from which it can 
be sent to an output device or a storage 
device for future access, as needed.

free resources to learn more about 
­processor chip manufacturers and 
­multi-core processors.
The Control Unit
The control unit is the component 
of the processor that directs and coordi-
nates most of the operations in the computer. That is, it interprets each instruction issued by a 
program or an application and then initiates the appropriate action to carry out the instruction. 
Types of internal components that the control unit directs include the arithmetic logic unit, 
­registers, and buses, each discussed in this chapter.
The Arithmetic Logic Unit
The arithmetic logic unit (ALU), another component of the processor, performs arithmetic, 
comparison, and other operations.
Arithmetic operations include basic calculations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and 
division. Comparison operations involve comparing one data item with another to determine whether 
the first item is greater than, equal to, or less than the other item. Depending on the result of the 
comparison, different actions may occur. For example, to determine if an employee should receive 
overtime pay, software instructs the ALU to compare the number of hours an employee worked 
during the week with the regular time hours allowed (e.g., 40 hours). If the hours worked exceed 40, 
for example, software instructs the ALU to perform calculations that compute the overtime wage.
Machine Cycle
For every instruction, a processor repeats a set of four basic operations, which comprise a 
machine cycle: (1) fetching, (2) decoding, (3) executing, and, if necessary, (4) storing.
• Fetching is the process of obtaining a program or an application instruction or data item from 
memory.
• Decoding refers to the process of translating the instruction into signals the computer 
can execute.
• Executing is the process of carrying out the commands.
• Storing, in this context, means writing the result to memory (not to a storage medium).

Chapter 6  Computing Components
Registers
A processor contains small, high-speed storage locations, called registers, that temporarily hold 
data and instructions. Registers are part of the processor, not part of memory or a permanent 
storage device. Processors have many different types of registers, each with a specific storage 
function. Register functions include storing the location from where an instruction was fetched, 
storing an instruction while the control unit decodes it, storing data while the ALU ­calculates it, 
and storing the results of a calculation.
The System Clock
The processor relies on a small quartz crystal circuit called the system clock to control the 
timing of all computer operations. Just as your heart beats at a regular rate to keep your body 
functioning, the system clock generates regular electronic pulses, or ticks, that set the operating 
pace of components of the system unit.

Figure 6-5 illustrates the steps in a machine cycle. In some computers, the processor fetches, 
decodes, executes, and stores only one instruction at a time. With others, the processor fetches a 
second instruction before the first instruction ­completes its machine cycle, resulting in faster 
processing. Some use multiple processors simultaneously to increase processing times.

Each tick equates to a clock cycle. Processors today typically are superscalar, which means they 
can execute more than one instruction per clock cycle.
The pace of the system clock, called the clock speed, is measured by the number of ticks per 
second. Current personal computer processors have clock speeds in the gigahertz range. Giga is 
a prefix that stands for billion, and a hertz is one cycle per second. Thus, one gigahertz (GHz) 
equals one billion ticks of the system clock per second. A computer that operates at 3 GHz has 
3 billion (giga) clock cycles in one second (hertz).
The faster the clock speed, the more instructions the processor can execute per second. The 
speed of the system clock is just one factor that influences a computer’s performance. Other 
f­actors, such as the type of processor chip, amount of cache, memory access time, bus width, and 
bus clock speed, are discussed later in this chapter.

Does the system clock also keep track of the current date and time?
No, a separate battery-backed chip, called the real-time clock, keeps track of the date and time in a computer. The 
battery continues to run the real-time clock even when the computer is off.
	
Personal Computer and Mobile Device Processors
The leading manufacturers of personal computer processor chips are Intel and AMD. AMD 
manufactures Intel-compatible processors, which have an internal design similar to Intel ­processors, 
perform the same functions, and can be as powerful, but often are less expensive. These 
­manufacturers often identify their processor chips by a model name or model number. Read 
How To 6-1 for items to consider when selecting a processor for a computer.
In the past, chip manufacturers listed a processor’s clock speed in marketing literature and 
advertisements. As previously mentioned, though, clock speed is only one factor that impacts 
processing speed in today’s computers. To help consumers evaluate various processors, manu-
facturers such as Intel and AMD now use a numbering scheme that more accurately reflects the 
processing speed of their chips.
Select the Right Processor
When you are shopping for a new 
­computer, it is important to select one with 
a processor that will meet your needs. For 
example, some processors are designed for 
home users, some are designed for power 
users, and others are designed for mobile 
users. Performing basic research before 
you shop for a new computer can help you 
select the most appropriate processor. The 
following steps describe how to select the 
right processor.
1.	 Determine your needs. Think about 
how you will use your computer and the 
programs and applications you plan to 
run. If you will be using your computer 
for basic tasks, such as web browsing 
or checking email, you may require a 
less expensive processor than a user 
who will be running many programs and 
­applications simultaneously.
2.	 Determine your current processor. If 
you are replacing your existing computer 
with a new computer, determine the pro-
cessor in your existing computer so that 
you can make sure the new processor 
is better and faster than the one in use 
­currently.
3.	 Research processor models. While 
shopping for computers in your price 
range, pay attention to the types of pro-
cessors they include. Visit the processor 
manufacturer’s website and verify that 
the processor will meet your comput-
ing needs adequately. Reviewing the 
minimum system requirements on the 
programs and apps you wish to run 
may help you determine the proces-
sor you need. Choose a processor that 
exceeds the minimum system require-
ments of the programs and apps you 
wish to run, but remember that it is not 
always ­necessary to purchase the most 
­expensive computer with the fastest 
processor.
  Consider This: What type of processor 
is in your current computer? If you were to 
upgrade your processor, which one would 
you choose? Why?

Processor chips include technologies to improve processing performance (for example, to 
improve performance of media and 3-D graphics). Some also include technology to track com-
puter hardware and software, diagnose and resolve computer problems, and secure computers 
from outside threats. Processors for mobile computers also include technology to optimize and 
extend battery life and integrate wireless capabilities. Smaller mobile devices often use more 
compact processors that consume less power, yet offer high performance.

Mobile Device Cooling
Mobile devices often use 
low-voltage processors, 
which have such low 
power demands that 
they do not require 
additional cooling.
Consider This
Can you upgrade an existing computer’s processor?
You might be able to upgrade a processor to increase the computer’s performance. Be certain the processor you 
buy is compatible with your computer’s motherboard; otherwise, you will have to replace the motherboard, too.
	
Processor Cooling
Processor chips for laptops, desktops, and servers can generate quite a bit of heat, which 
could cause the chip to malfunction or fail. Although the power supply on some computers 
contains a main fan to generate airflow, today’s personal computer processors often require 
additional cooling. Some computer cases locate additional 
fans near certain components, such as a processor, to pro-
vide additional cooling. Heat sinks, liquid cooling tech-
nologies, and cooling mats often are used to help further 
dissipate processor heat.
A heat sink is a small ceramic or metal component with 
fins on its surface that absorbs and ­disperses heat produced 
by electrical components, such as a processor. Many heat 
sinks have fans to help distribute air dissipated by the heat 
sink. Some heat sinks are packaged as part of a ­processor 
chip. Others are installed on the top or the side of the chip 
(Figure 6-6).
Some computers use liquid cooling technology to reduce 
the ­temperature of a processor. Liquid cooling technology uses a 
continuous flow of fluid(s), such as water and glycol, in a pro-
cess that transfers the heated fluid away from the processor to a 
radiator-type grill, which cools the liquid, and then returns the 
cooled fluid to the processor.
Laptop users often use a cooling pad to help further 
reduce the heat generated by their ­computer. A cooling pad 
rests below a laptop and protects the computer from over-
heating and also the user’s lap from excessive heat (Figure 
6-7). Some cooling pads contain a small fan to transfer 
heat away from the laptop. These types of cooling pads 
often draw power from a USB port. Instead of using power, 
other pads absorb heat through a conductive material 
inside the pad.
Mini Feature 6-1: The Internet of Things
The Internet of Things (IoT) describes a computing 
­environment where everyday objects, or things, are con-

The Internet of Things
Analysts predict that the IoT will be a multitrillion-dollar 
business as the number of “smart” devices and things 
connected to the Internet continues to increase. As 
watches, thermostats, fitness trackers, appliances, 
­clothing, and other “things” become equipped with 
sensors that can transmit data to and from the Internet, 
keeping every “thing” connected could become one of 
the world’s largest industries. 
From Devices to Things
Computers and mobile devices are not the only things 
that connect to the Internet. You can buy a thermostat, 
such as the one from Nest Labs shown in the figure, that 
allows you to adjust 
the temperature 
of your home from 
anywhere using 
an app on your 
smartphone. The 
thermostat contains 
a temperature sen-
sor that can send 
and receive data. A 
wireless chip attached to your medicine bottle can send 
text messages to remind you to take your medication 
and then contact your pharmacy to refill the prescrip-
tion when it is due for a refill. Smart trash cans in public 
places have sensors that monitor the amount of trash 
deposited and then send a message notifying owners 
when the containers need to be emptied. This saves gar-
bage collectors from checking the containers every day; 
instead, they can empty the containers only when receiv-
ing a message that they are full.
Wearable ­technology, such as smartwatches and 
wristbands, can track your pulse and heart rate, as well as 
accept calls and display notifications from a smartphone. 
Many public buses and subways have GPS sensors that 
report their locations so that travelers can track them 
with mobile apps. Retailers can use beacons, which are 
devices that send low-energy Bluetooth signals to nearby 
smartphones, to notify customers who use a payment 
app such as Paypal, of personalized offers in their stores. 
Washers and dryers in many college 
­dormitory laundry rooms are connected 
to ­sensors that report the availability 
of an individual machine. Students can 
visit a website, use a mobile app, or 
request text message alerts to locate 
available machines before carrying 
their laundry to the laundry room.
Technologies Enable the IoT
The IoT brings together several 
recent technology developments. 
Communications technologies, such 
as Bluetooth, RFID tags, near-field 
communications (NFC) tags, and 
sensors tracking heat (temperature), 
light, weight, or location have become readily available. 
Sensors and tags can transmit messages to a server on 
the Internet over a wireless network at frequent intervals 
for analysis and storage. Developments in Big Data have 
made it possible to access, store, and process all of this 
data reported by sensors efficiently. (To learn more about 
Big Data, read Mini Feature 11-1 in Chapter 11.) Mobile 
service providers offer connectivity to a variety of devices 
at broadband speeds, so transmitting and retrieving 
data can take place quickly. The size and cost of wire-
less radios has decreased, enabling more things to have 
embedded sensors, tags, and transmitters.
The capability of computers, devices, and everyday 
objects to communicate with one another over the Internet 
has opened new possibilities for both consumers and the 
enterprise to be more productive, efficient, and informed.

Ethics & Issues 6-1
Does the Internet of Things Discriminate?
Technology experts expect that the 
­advantages brought by the expansion of 
the Internet of Things (IoT) will enhance the 
comfort, safety, and efficiency of a large 
population across the globe. Where does 
that leave people who are struggling to 
make ends meet? What about those who 
live in developing countries?
Among the IoT technologies that exist or 
are in development include the following 
examples. Students can find accurate 
information quickly and use cloud-based 
apps to store data so that it is accessible. The 
coordination of traffic lights based on GPS 
data will lead to a lessening of commute 
times. Wearable and implanted devices can 
collect and communicate health-related 
data. Sensors that monitor temperature, air 
and water quality and usage, and more, will 
reduce home ownership costs and security 
risks. Agricultural devices can monitor, track, 
and provide assessment of livestock and 
crops to lower costs and improve access 
to food.
Individuals or countries that cannot afford 
these and other IoT-related technologies 
may feel a negative impact as others 
take advantage of the effects brought 
by these technologies. Students without 
access to these technologies could be at a 
disadvantage. Workers with shorter travel 
times may enjoy a better quality of life. 
Those who cannot afford health-related 
devices may be at higher risk for illnesses or 
medical complications. Homeowners without 
IoT-enabled homes may be more prone to 
dangers, such as fires. Countries involved in 
agricultural exporting may lose business as 
others are able to reduce costs.
As costs of these technologies decrease, 
it is likely that the divide between the more 
and less fortunate will decrease. Awareness 
of the impact of the inequalities also may 
give rise to nonprofits or organizations that 
focus on providing IoT technologies to a 
larger population.
Consider This: In what other ways will IoT 
affect individuals and countries who cannot 
afford these technologies? What respon-
sibility exists to make IoT technologies 
­available to all?
Secure IT 6-3
Does the Internet of Things Encroach 
on Privacy?
Being digitally observed in the connected 
world is inescapable. Every day, smart electric 
meters, wearable technology, and vehicles’ 
black boxes submit data about us as part 
of the Internet of Things (IoT). Researchers 
predict billions of devices will be part of the 
IoT by the end of this decade. With all these 
devices in nearly every facet of our daily 
lives, data is being accumulated and sold to 
health care providers, home security busi-
nesses, utility companies, and researchers.
Savvy consumers can take some steps to 
attempt to limit exposure to data collection. 
They can enable privacy settings, for example, 
but that does not guarantee that data is not 
being gathered, transmitted, and compiled. 
The report of Smart TVs secretly collecting 
data about audiences’ viewing habits sparked 
privacy and security concerns. Consumers 
need to urge companies to design products 
with built-in privacy protections. These devices 
could have default settings that prevent the 
sharing of data until obtaining the consumer’s 
consent. Companies should explain what data 
is being collected and whether it will be used 
to help people live more productive lives or to 
create personal profiles that predict behavior. 
In addition, companies bear the responsibility 
of ensuring sensitive data being collected is 
kept secure and confidential.
Privacy and security concerns abound with 
the Internet of Things, but most consumers 
and technology experts believe that the 
security, health, and productivity benefits of 
this technology outweigh the potential risks.
  Consider This: Should companies inform 
consumers about the data being collected in 
homes, vehicles, schools, and workplaces? 
What role should governmental agencies, 
such as the Federal Trade Commission, play in 
overseeing companies’ secure products and 
commercial data collection techniques?

Cloud Computing
Recall that cloud computing refers to an environment of servers that house and provide access 
to resources users access via the Internet. Home and business users choose cloud computing for 
a variety of reasons:
• Accessibility: Data and/or applications are available worldwide from any computer or device 
with an Internet connection.
• Cost savings: The expense of software and high-end hardware, such as fast processors and 
high-capacity memory and storage devices, shifts away from the user.
• Space savings: Floor space required for servers, storages devices, and other hardware shifts 
away from the user.
• Scalability: Provides the flexibility to increase or decrease computing requirements as needed.
Cloud computing consists of a front end and a back end, connected to each other through 
a network. The front end includes the hardware and software with which a user interacts to 
access the cloud. For example, a user might access a resource on the cloud through a browser 
on a laptop. The back end consists of the servers and storage devices that manage and store the 
resources accessed by users.
Mini Feature 6-2: Cloud Computing Services
Cloud computing allows companies to outsource, or contract to third-party providers, 
­elements of their information technology infrastructure. They pay only for the ­computing 
power, storage, bandwidth, and access to applications that they actually use. As a result, 
­companies need not make large investments in equipment, or the staff to support it. Read Mini 
Feature 6-2 to learn about available types of cloud computing services.

Cloud Computing 
Services
Consumers and organizations rely on cloud computing 
services to manage IT infrastructure (infrastructure as 
a service), provide applications (software as a service), 
access online data (data as a service), and create, test, 
and deploy applications using web-based development 
tools (platform as a service).
Infrastructure as a Service
IaaS (infrastructure as a service) uses software to 
­emulate hardware capabilities, enabling companies to 
scale, or adjust up or down, storage, processing power, 
or bandwidth as needed. For example, retailers may 
need to increase these capabilities to accommodate 
additional traffic to their websites during busy holiday 
shopping seasons. When the season ends, retailers 
­easily can reduce these settings.
Two specific instances of IaaS are storage as a 
service and desktop as a service:
• Storage as a Service: Cloud storage providers 
offer file management services such as storing files 
online, system backup, and archiving earlier versions 
of files. Cloud storage is especially useful to tablet and 
­smartphone users, because it enables them to access 
their files from all of their devices.
• Desktop as a Service: Some companies specify 
the applications, security settings, and computing 
resources available to employees on their desktop 
computers. These images, or configurations, provide 
a common desktop work environment available to 
employees across an entire organization. Because the 
desktop and its applications appear to be installed 
on the user’s own computer, desktop as a service 
also is known as a virtual desktop.
Software as a Service
SaaS (software as a service) describes a ­computing 
environment where an Internet server hosts and deploys 
applications. Editing documents or photos, sending email 
messages, and managing finances are common con-
sumer tasks of SaaS applications. A pioneering provider 
of SaaS applications for companies is Salesforce (shown 
in the figure in this mini feature), which offers customer 
relationship management (CRM) software. Salesforce 
users subscribe to modules to handle tasks such as sales 
and marketing campaigns and customer services.

Chapter 6  Computing Components
Data Representation
To understand how a computer processes data, you should know how a computer represents 
data. People communicate through speech by combining words into sentences. Human speech is 
­analog because it uses continuous (wave form) signals that vary in strength and quality. Most com-
puters are digital. They recognize only two discrete states: on and off. This is because ­computers 
are electronic devices powered by electricity, which also has only two states: on and off.
Bits and Bytes
The two digits, 0 and 1, easily can represent these two states (Figure 6-8). 
The digit 0 ­represents the electronic state of off (absence of an elec-
tronic charge). The digit 1 represents the electronic state of on (pres-
ence of an electronic charge).
When people count, they use the 10 digits in the decimal system 
(0 through 9). The computer, by contrast, uses a binary system because 
it recognizes only two states. The binary system is a number system 
that has just two unique digits, 0 and 1, called bits. A bit (short for 
binary digit) is the smallest unit of data the computer can process. By 
itself, a bit is not very informative.
When 8 bits are grouped together as a unit, they form a byte. A 
byte provides enough ­different combinations of 0s and 1s to represent 
256 different characters. These characters include numbers, upper-
case and lowercase letters of the alphabet, punctuation marks, and 
other ­keyboard symbols, such as an asterisk (*), ampersand (&), and 
­dollar sign ($).
Data as a Service
Government agencies, companies, and social media 
sites make data available for developers to incorporate 
in applications or to use when making business deci-
sions and plans. DaaS (data as a service) allows users 
and applications to access a company’s data. Mashups 
are applications that incorporate data from multiple 
providers into a new application. Displaying homes or 
crime statistics on a map are examples of mashups 
that require data from real estate, police records, and 
­mapping providers.
Platform as a Service
Application developers need to maintain ­computers 
running specific hardware, operating systems, 
­development tools, databases, and other software. PaaS 
(platform as a service) allows developers to create, test, 
and run their solutions on a cloud platform without 
having to purchase or configure the underlying hard-
ware and software.

Coding Schemes
The combinations of 0s and 1s that represent uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and 
special symbols are defined by patterns called a coding scheme. Coding schemes map a set of 
alphanumeric characters (letters and 
numbers) and special symbols to a 
sequence of numeric values that a 
computer can process. ASCII (pro-
nounced ASK-ee), which stands 
for American Standard Code for 
Information Interchange, is the 
most widely used coding scheme 
to represent a set of characters. 
In the ASCII coding scheme, for 
example, the alphabetic character 
E is represented as 01000101; 
the symbolic character * is  
­represented as 00101010; the 
numeric character 6 is represented 
as 00110110 (Figure 6-9).
When you press a key on a 
keyboard, a chip in the keyboard converts the key’s electronic ­signal into a special code, called a scan 
code, that is sent to the electronic circuitry in the computer. Then, the electronic circuitry in the com-
puter converts the scan code into its ASCII binary form and stores it as a byte value in its memory for 
processing. When processing is ­finished, the computer converts the byte into a human-recognizable 
number, letter of the ­alphabet, or special character that is displayed on a screen or is printed 
(Figure 6-10). All of these ­conversions take place so quickly that you do not realize they are occurring.
Step 1
A user presses the capital letter 
T (SHIFT+T keys) on the keyboard,
which in turn creates a special code, 
called a scan code, for the capital 
letter T.
Step 2
The scan code for the capital letter 
T is sent to the electronic circuitry 
in the computer.
Step 3
The electronic circuitry in the 
computer converts the scan code for 
the capital letter T to its ASCII binary 
code (01010100) and stores it in 
memory for processing.
Step 4
After processing, the binary 
code for the capital letter T 
is converted to an image and 
displayed on the output 
device.

Chapter 6  Computing Components
Consider This
Why are coding schemes necessary?
Computers rely on logic circuits, which are controlled by electronic switches whose state can be either on or off. 
Each switch’s on/off state is represented by one bit, whose value is either 0 or 1. Coding schemes translate  
real-world data into a form that computers can process easily.
	
Memory
Memory consists of electronic components that store instructions waiting to be executed by the 
processor, data needed by those instructions, and the results of processing the data (information). 
Memory usually consists of one or more chips on the motherboard or some other circuit board 
in the computer. Memory stores three basic categories of items:
 1. The operating system and other programs that control or maintain the computer and its devices
 2. Applications that carry out a specific task, such as word processing
 3. The data being processed by the applications and the resulting information
This role of memory to store both data and programs is known as the stored program concept.
Bytes and Addressable Memory
A byte (character) is the basic storage unit in memory. When an application’s instructions and 
data are transferred to memory from storage devices, the instructions and data exist as bytes. Each 
byte resides temporarily in a location in memory that has an address. Simply put, an address is a 
unique number that identifies the location of a byte in memory. To access data or instructions in 
memory, the computer references the addresses that con-
tain bytes of data. The photo in Figure 6-11 shows how 
seats in a stadium are similar to addresses in memory: 
(1) a seat, which is identified by a unique seat number, 
holds one person at a time, and a location in memory, 
which is identified by a unique address, holds a single 
byte; and (2) both a seat, identified by a seat number, and 
a byte, ­identified by an address, can be empty.
Manufacturers state the size of memory in terms of the 
number of bytes it has available for storage. Common 
sizes for memory are in the gigabyte and terabyte range. 
A gigabyte (GB) equals approximately 1 billion bytes. A 
terabyte (TB) is equal to approximately 1 trillion bytes.
Types of Memory
Computers and mobile devices contain two types of 
memory: volatile and nonvolatile. When the computer’s 
power is turned off, volatile memory loses its contents. 
Nonvolatile memory, by contrast, does not lose its con-
tents when power is removed from the computer. Thus, 
volatile memory is temporary and nonvolatile memory is permanent. RAM is the most common 
type of volatile memory. Examples of nonvolatile memory include ROM, flash memory, and 
CMOS. The following sections discuss these types of memory.
RAM
Users typically are referring to RAM when discussing computer and mobile device memory. 
RAM (random access memory), also called main memory, consists of memory chips that can be read 
from and written to by the processor and other devices. When you turn on power to a computer 
or mobile device, certain operating system files (such as the files that determine how the desktop

or home screen appears) load into RAM from a storage device such as a hard drive. These files 
remain in RAM as long as the computer or mobile device has continuous power. As additional 
applications and data are requested, they also load into RAM from storage.
The processor interprets and executes a program or application’s instructions while the ­program 
or application is in RAM. During this time, the contents of RAM may change (Figure 6-12). RAM 
can accommodate multiple programs and applications simultaneously.
Most RAM is volatile, which means it loses its contents when the power is removed from the 
computer. For this reason, you must save any data, instructions, and information you may need 
in the future. Saving is the process of copying data, instructions, and information from RAM to 
a storage device such as a hard drive.

Determine Memory Requirements
If you are shopping for a new computer or 
looking to upgrade your existing computer, be 
sure that it will have sufficient memory. When 
a computer has insufficient memory, its per-
formance can slow significantly. On the other 
hand, it would be an unnecessary expense to 
purchase a computer with more memory than 
you will ever use. The following steps describe 
how to determine memory requirements.
1.	 If you are upgrading the memory in your 
existing computer, determine the following:
a.	 Amount of memory currently installed
b.	 Amount of memory the computer can 
support
c.	 Type of memory modules currently 
installed
d.	 Whether memory modules must be 
installed in pairs
e.	 Number of available slots for memory 
modules
2.	 Determine the amount of memory your 
computer requires by checking the memory 
requirements for the operating system and 
programs and applications you plan to run. 
You can find the system requirements, which 
will specify the memory requirements, on 
product packaging or on a software manu-
facturer’s website. If you are planning to 
upgrade your computer and the amount of 
memory you require exceeds the amount of 
memory your computer currently can sup-
port, you may need to purchase a new com-
puter. If you are purchasing a new computer, 
view the computer’s specifications to make 
sure it has sufficient memory. Some online 
vendors offer a web app that will check the 
configuration on your computer to deter-
mine the memory modules that are compat-
ible and offer options to you for purchase.
3.	 Once you have determined your memory 
requirements, you are ready to purchase 
the memory modules. Memory modules are 
available for purchase in many ­computer 
and electronic stores, directly from com-
puter manufacturers, and on ­various web-
sites. When you are ­purchasing memory 
modules, keep the ­following in mind:
a.	 Many types of memory modules are 
available. Purchase a type, size, and speed 
that is compatible with your computer.
b.	 If your computer requires that you 
install memory in pairs, be sure to 
­purchase two memory modules that 
are the same type, size, and speed.
c.	 Do not purchase more memory

How To 6-2
Types of RAM  Two common types of RAM are dynamic RAM and static RAM:
• Dynamic RAM (DRAM pronounced DEE-ram) chips must be reenergized constantly or they 
lose their contents. Many variations of DRAM chips exist, most of which are faster than the 
basic DRAM (Table 6-1).
• Static RAM (SRAM pronounced ESS-ram) chips are faster and more reliable than any variation 
of DRAM chips. These chips do not have to be reenergized as often as DRAM chips; hence, 
the term, static. SRAM chips, however, are much more expensive than DRAM chips. Special 
applications, such as cache, use SRAM chips. A later section in this chapter discusses cache.

Install Memory Modules
Installing additional memory modules in a 
desktop or laptop can be a relatively easy 
process. The following steps describe how 
to install new memory modules.
1.	 Turn off and unplug your computer from 
the power source. If you are using a lap-
top, remove its battery.
2.	 Wear an antistatic wristband to protect 
the computer from static electricity.
3.	 Remove or open the computer case. If you 
are upgrading a laptop, you may be able 
to locate the slots for the memory mod-
ules through an access panel.
4.	 If necessary, remove any existing memory 
modules you no longer need. If clips are 
holding the memory module in place, 
you may need to pull the clips away from 
the memory module before removing it. 
Remove the memory modules by lifting 
them out by the side edges.
5.	 Remove the new memory modules from 
the packaging.
6.	 Slowly and carefully insert the memory 
modules into the slots on your computer’s 
motherboard. Be sure they are facing 
the correct way as you insert them. The 
memory modules should “click” in place 
once they are inserted completely.
7.	 Close the computer case or any access 
panel you have opened.
8.	 Plug in the computer and turn it on.
9.	 Check the system information in the 
­operating system to make sure it is recog-
nizing the new amount of memory installed.

­possible to install memory modules in some 
types of computers?

Memory Modules  RAM chips usually reside on a memory module, which is a small circuit 
board. Memory slots on the motherboard hold memory modules.
Two types of memory modules are SIMMs and DIMMs (Figure 6-13). A SIMM (single inline 
memory module) has pins on opposite sides of the circuit board that connect together to form 
a single set of contacts. With a DIMM (dual inline memory module), by contrast, the pins on 
opposite sides of the circuit board do not connect and, thus, form two sets of contacts. Read 
How To 6-3 for instructions about installing memory modules.

Cache
Most of today’s computers improve their processing times with cache (pronounced cash), 
which is a temporary storage area. Two common types of cache are memory cache and disk 
cache. This chapter discusses memory cache. Chapter 8 discusses disk cache.

Chapter 6  Computing Components
Memory cache helps speed the processes of the computer because it stores frequently used 
instructions and data. Most personal computers today have two types of memory cache: Level 1 
(L1) cache and Level 2 (L2) cache. Some also have Level 3 (L3) cache.
• L1 cache is built directly on the processor chip. L1 cache usually has a very small capacity.
• L2 cache is slightly slower than L1 cache but has a much larger capacity. Current processors 
include advanced transfer cache (ATC), a type of L2 cache built directly on the processor chip. 
Processors that use ATC perform at much faster rates than those that do not use it.
• L3 cache is a cache on the motherboard that is separate from the processor chip. L3 cache 
exists only on computers that use L2 advanced transfer cache.
When the processor needs an instruction or data, it searches memory in this order: L1 cache, 
then L2 cache, then L3 cache (if it exists), then RAM — with a greater delay in processing for 
each level of memory it must search (Figure 6-14). If the instruction or data is not found in 
memory, then it must search a slower speed storage medium, such as a hard drive or optical disc.

BTW
L2 Cache
When discussing cache, 
most users are referring 
to L2 cache.
ROM
Read-only memory (ROM pronounced rahm) refers to memory chips storing ­permanent 
data and instructions. The data on most ROM chips cannot be modified — hence, the name 
read-only. ROM is nonvolatile, which means its contents are not lost when power is removed 
from the computer. In addition to computers and mobile devices, many peripheral devices con-
tain ROM chips. For example, ROM chips in printers contain data for fonts.
Manufacturers of ROM chips often record data, instructions, or information on the chips 
when they manufacture the chips. These ROM chips, called firmware, contain permanently 
written data, instructions, or information, such as a computer or mobile device’s start-up instruc-
tions. Read Ethics & Issues 6-2 to consider issues related to the manufacture of computer and 
mobile device components.

Wiping Mobile Phone Memory
If you ever have lent your smartphone to 
someone, left it sitting on your desk at school 
or work, or placed it in your car’s center 
console at valet parking, you might have 
provided someone access without your con-
sent to all your personal data stored on that 
device. A thief can plug a small device, called 
a Cellular Seizure Investigation (CSI) stick, 
into the phone and then download sensitive 
data in seconds.
While this unscrupulous activity seems 
alarming, a similar action occurs every day 
when smartphone users recycle or sell their 
devices without wiping all their personal 
records from memory. A person buying or 
acquiring the phone then can access the 
sensitive data left in memory. Some recyclers 
claim that 95 percent of the mobile phones 
they receive are not completely cleaned.
A kill switch allows smartphone owners to 
delete all data or to disable their devices remotely 
in the event of theft or loss. Since 2015, all 
smartphones sold in California must include this 
device, and federal and other state lawmakers 
have proposed requiring all manufacturers to 
include this switch in their products.
Deleting all data from a mobile phone’s 
memory is a relatively simple process, but it 
is not a universal procedure. Each device has 
its own set of steps described in the owner’s 
manual or online. In general, users must locate 
their device’s settings area on a menu and then 
look for a reset command. Most electronics 
manufacturers post instructions for this process 
on their websites. Mobile phone retailers often 
can offer help in clearing personal data; if you 
resort to this measure, be certain to watch 
the sales associate perform this action. If your 
mobile phone has a SIM or memory card, 
remove and destroy it if you are not going to 
transfer it to another phone. Employees who 
use their phone to access email messages on 
corporate servers sometimes are required to 
enter a passcode on the phone so that if it is 
lost or stolen, the data can be wiped remotely.
  Consider This: Have you ever wiped the 
memory of your mobile phone? What action 
would you take if you received or bought a 
used mobile phone and then discovered the 
previous owner’s personal information stored 
in memory? Should lawmakers require smart-
phone manufacturers to include a kill switch 
in their products? Why or why not?
Flash Memory
Flash memory is a type of nonvolatile memory that can be erased electronically and 
­rewritten. Most computers use flash memory to hold their start-up instructions because it allows 
the computer to update its contents easily. For example, when the computer changes from stan-
dard time to daylight savings time, the contents of a flash memory chip (and the real-time clock 
chip) change to reflect the new time.
Flash memory chips also store data and programs on many mobile devices and peripheral devices, 
such as smartphones, portable media players, printers, digital cameras, automotive devices, and 
digital voice recorders. When you enter names and addresses in a smartphone, for example, a flash 
memory chip stores the data. Some portable media players store music on flash memory chips; oth-
ers store music on tiny hard drives or memory cards. Memory cards contain flash memory on a 
removable device instead of a chip. Read Secure IT 6-4 for tips about deleting data on a smartphone.
Ethics & Issues 6-2
Should Companies Reveal Which 
Products They Manufacture Using Fair 
Trade Practices?
Despite the increased cost, many coffee and tea 
drinkers gladly purchase fair trade ­products. Fair 
trade labels indicate that the workers who pick 
the coffee beans or tea leaves work in humane 
conditions and receive fair pay for their labor.
With respect to technology, several cases of 
unfair labor practices exist. Some technology 
manufacturers use products or components 
made in areas of extreme poverty. In these 
cases, factory owners coerce workers, including 
children, to work long hours in unsafe or 
unsanitary conditions for little pay and without 
breaks. In another example, mining for the raw 
materials needed to manufacture technology 
components may occur in areas where military 
conflict exists. Those involved in the military 
conflict may use the revenue from mining this 
material, sometimes called conflict minerals, to 
fund the soldiers and continue the discord.
Under a rule recently adopted by the U.S. 
Securities and Exchange Committee (SEC), 
manufacturers must review their supply sources 
and file a form disclosing any materials mined 
in areas of conflict. Failure to disclose may 
have legal consequences, as well as attract the 
attention of human rights and environmental 
activists. Critics of this rule state that it does 
not address methods to ease situations of 
conflict, and may take jobs away from the 
workers. In addition, the rule applies only to 
manufacturers, not to retailers or distributors.
The Fair Labor Association (FLA) provides 
workplace standards for the environment 
and treatment of workers at all stages of 
product development. Many technology 
companies are making efforts to comply with 
the SEC ruling, as well as FLA guidelines. 
Providing a living wage, ensuring worker 
safety, and mandating that workers receive 
breaks are some of the guidelines.
Consider This: Would you pay more for a 
fair trade smartphone or laptop? Why or 
why not? Are retailers responsible for the 
source of the materials used in products 
they sell? Why or why not? Should the 
government require companies to comply 
with fair trade policies? Why or why not?

Chapter 6  Computing Components
CMOS
Some RAM chips, flash memory chips, and other memory chips use complementary 
­metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS pronounced SEE-moss) technology because it ­provides high 
speeds and consumes little power. CMOS technology uses battery power to retain ­information 
even when the power to the computer is off. Battery-backed CMOS memory chips, for example, 
can keep the calendar, date, and time current even when the computer is off. The flash memory 
chips that store a computer’s start-up information often use CMOS technology.
Memory Access Times
Access time is the amount of time it takes the processor to read data, instructions, and 
­information from memory. A computer’s access time directly affects how fast the computer 
­processes data. For example, accessing data in memory can be more than 200,000 times faster 
than accessing data on a hard disk because of the mechanical motion of the hard disk.
Today’s manufacturers use a variety of terminology to state access times (Table 6-2). Some use 
fractions of a second, which for memory occurs in nanoseconds. A nanosecond (abbreviated ns) is 
one billionth of a second. A nanosecond is extremely fast (Figure 6-15). In fact, electricity travels 
about one foot in a nanosecond.

Consider This
What if a manufacturer states access times in megahertz instead of fractions of a second?
Some manufacturers state access times in MHz; for example, 800 MHz DDR2 SDRAM. If a manufacturer states 
access time in megahertz, you can convert it to nanoseconds by dividing 1 billion ns by the megahertz number. For 
example, 800 MHz equals approximately 1.25 ns (1,000,000,000/800,000,000). The higher the megahertz, the 
faster the access time; conversely, the lower the nanoseconds, the faster the access time.
While access times of memory greatly affect overall computer performance, manufacturers and retailers often 
list a computer’s memory in terms of its size, not its access time. For example, an advertisement might describe a 
computer as having 8 GB of RAM.

Adapters
Although the circuitry in many of today’s computers integrates all the necessary functionality, 
some require additional capabilities in the form of adapters. Desktops and servers use adapter 
cards; mobile computers use USB adapters. Read How To 6-4 to learn about ports you might 
consider including in a computer or mobile device that can eliminate the need for adapters.
Adapter Cards
An adapter card, sometimes called an expansion card or 
adapter board, is a circuit board that enhances the functions of a 
component of a desktop or server system unit and/or provides 
connections to peripheral devices. An expansion slot is a socket 
on a desktop or server motherboard that can hold an adapter 
card. Figure 6-16 shows some adapter cards in expansion slots 
on a desktop motherboard.
Two popular adapter cards are sound cards and video cards. 
A sound card enhances the sound-generating capabilities of a 
­personal computer by allowing sound to be input through a 
Determine Which Ports You Need on a 
Computer or Mobile Device
When purchasing a computer or mobile 
device, it is important to make sure it has 
the correct ports so that you can connect 
your peripheral devices. The following list 
will help identify the ports you need on a 
computer or mobile device.
• Displays: If you plan to connect your 
computer or mobile device to a display 
such as a monitor or projector, make sure 
your computer or mobile device has a 
port that is compatible with the display. 
For example, if you plan to connect a lap-
top to a monitor that has an HDMI port, 
your computer or mobile device should 
have a port capable of HDMI output.
• Networking: If 
you plan to connect 
your computer or 
mobile device to 
a wired computer 
network, it should 
have an Ethernet port to which you can 
connect network cables.
• Audio: If you plan to connect your 
­computer or mobile device to an audio 
output device, such as speakers, head-
phones, or earbuds, your computer or 
mobile device should have a port for audio 
output. If you are connecting an external 
microphone or other device that provides 
audio, your computer or mobile device 
should have a port for audio input.
• Other Input, Output, and ­Storage 
­Devices: If you plan to connect other 
­devices, such as a keyboard, mouse, 
­external hard drive, or printer, look at the 
cable that connects this device to the 
computer, and make sure your computer 
has a port that will accept the connector 
on the cable. In many cases, these devices 
will connect to your computer using a 
USB connection. Make sure your computer 
has a sufficient number of USB ports to 
support the devices you want to connect. 
If you are unable to connect a computer 
with enough USB ports, you can purchase 
a USB hub.
If your computer or mobile device does not 
have the ports you need, you may be able 
to purchase an adapter that converts an 
existing port to one that can connect to the 
desired device.
  Consider This: In addition to the 
devices discussed in this box, what other 
devices might you connect to your computer 
or mobile device?

microphone and output through external ­speakers or ­headphones. A video card, also called 
a graphics card, converts computer output into a video signal that travels through a cable to 
the monitor, which displays an image on the screen. Table 6-3 identifies the purpose of some 
adapter cards. Sometimes, all functionality is built in the adapter card. With others, a cable 
connects the adapter card to a device, such as a digital video camera, outside the computer.
Today’s computers support Plug and Play technology, which means the computer automati-
cally can recognize peripheral devices as you install them. Plug and Play support means you can 
plug in a device and then immediately begin using it. Read Secure IT 6-5 for issues related to 
Plug and Play technology.

Plug and Play Security Flaws
Plug and Play technology allows your 
­computer to recognize peripheral devices 
and begin using them immediately after 
they are installed. This support permits com-
puters to connect and communicate with 
devices easily, but it also creates security 
flaws that allow hackers to take control of 
security ­systems, routers, Smart TVs, printers, 
­webcams, and other devices connected to 
the Internet.
According to Rapid7, a security firm that 
uncovered these defects, between 40 and 
50 million devices are susceptible to remote 
attacks. Rapid7 has developed a scanner tool 
to check vulnerabilities and identify affected 
hardware. Security experts recommend turning 
off or disabling any Plug and Play device not 
being used on a network that accesses the 
Internet.
  Consider This: Would you consider 
checking your home network to discover Plug 
and Play security weaknesses or disabling 
devices? What steps can manufacturers take 
to minimize these vulnerabilities?
USB Adapters
Because of their smaller size, mobile computers typically do not have expansion slots. Instead, 
users can purchase a USB adapter, which is a dongle that plugs into a USB port, enhances func-
tions of a mobile computer, and/or provides connections to peripheral devices (Figure 6-17). 
USB adapters can be used to add memory, communications, multimedia, security, and storage 
capabilities to mobile computers. A USB flash drive is a common USB adapter that provides 
computers and mobile devices with additional storage capability as long as it is plugged in. Read 
Ethics & Issues 6-3 to consider whether manufacturers should ­eliminate proprietary ­connectors.
Unlike adapter cards that require you to open the ­system unit and install the card on the 
motherboard, you can change a removable flash memory device without having to open the 
system unit or restart the computer. This feature, called hot plugging, allows you to insert and 
remove a device while the computer is running (be sure, though, to stop or eject the device 
before removing it).

Buses
As explained earlier in this chapter, a ­computer processes and stores data as a series of ­electronic 
bits. These bits transfer internally within the circuitry of the computer along electrical channels. 
Each channel, called a bus, allows the various devices both inside and attached to the system 
unit to communicate with one another. Just as vehicles travel on a highway to move from one 
destination to another, bits travel on a bus (Figure 6-18).
Ethics & Issues 6-3
Should Manufacturers Eliminate 
Proprietary Connectors?
If you need to replace the cable that con-
nects your mobile device to a USB port, you 
might have a choice of many makes, models, 
and prices. Some devices, however, require 
the use of proprietary connectors, limiting 
your options to those manufacturers who 
make connectors that match the port on 
your mobile device.
When Apple released the iPhone 5 in 
2012, for example, it required the use of a 
proprietary connector that was incompatible 
with connectors used with prior iPhone 
models and other Apple devices. Apple 
developed the connector, called Lightning, 
in part to eliminate problems caused by 
attempts to attach the cord the wrong way. 
With Lightning, users can attach the cord 
in either direction without causing damage 
to the port or device. Critics argue that 
requiring customers to purchase proprietary 
connectors increases the cost of purchasing 
or upgrading a mobile device.
The International Electronics Commission 
(IEC) is working with major technology 
providers to make micro USB the universal 
connector standard used to charge mobile 
devices. This type of universal standard has 
several advantages. It will save customers 
money because they will not have to 
purchase a new connector with their new 
device, even if it is a different brand. A 
universal standard connector also will enable 
users with different device models to share 
connectors. The environment will benefit 
because fewer outdated or incompatible 
cords will find their way into landfills. 
Further, the manufacturing process will 
generate less waste because fewer cords will 
be required.
Consider This: Should customers pressure 
manufacturers to use a universal connector 
standard? Why or why not? Would you con-
sider the connector type when purchasing a 
new phone? Why or why not?

Chapter 6  Computing Components
Buses are used to transfer bits from 
input devices to memory, from memory 
to the ­processor, from the processor to 
memory, and from memory to output or 
storage devices. Buses consist of a data bus 
and an address bus. The data bus is used to 
transfer actual data, and the address bus is 
used to transfer ­information about where 
the data should reside in memory.
Bus Width
The size of a bus, called the bus width, 
determines the number of bits that the 
computer can transmit at one time. For 
example, a 32-bit bus can transmit 32 bits 
(4 bytes) at a time. On a 64-bit bus, bits 
transmit from one location to another 
64 bits (8 bytes) at a time. The larger the 
number of bits handled by the bus, the 
faster the computer transfers data. Using 
the highway analogy again, assume that 
one lane on a highway can carry one bit. 
A 32-bit bus is like a 32-lane highway. 
A 64-bit bus is like a 64-lane highway.
If a number in memory occupies 
8 bytes, or 64 bits, the computer must 
transmit it in two separate steps when 
using a 32-bit bus: once for the first 
32 bits and once for the second 32 bits. 
Using a 64-bit bus, the computer can transmit the number in a single step, transferring all 
64 bits at once. The wider the bus, the fewer number of transfer steps required and the faster 
the transfer of data. Most personal computers today use a 64-bit bus.
In conjunction with the bus width, many computer professionals refer to a computer’s word 
size. Word size is the number of bits the processor can interpret and execute at a given time. 
That is, a 64-bit processor can manipulate 64 bits at a time. Computers with a larger word size 
can process more data in the same amount of time than computers with a smaller word size. In 
most computers, the word size is the same as the bus width.
Consider This
How is bus speed measured?
Every bus also has a clock speed. Just like the processor, manufacturers state the clock speed for a bus in hertz. The 
higher the bus clock speed, the faster the transmission of data, which results in programs running faster.
	
Types of Buses
A computer has a system bus, possibly a backside bus, and an expansion bus.
• A system bus, also called the front side bus (FSB), is part of the motherboard and connects the 
processor to main memory.
• A backside bus (BSB) connects the processor to cache.
• An expansion bus allows the processor to communicate with peripheral devices.
When computer professionals use the term, bus, by itself, they usually are referring to the ­system bus.

(AC) of 115 to 120 volts. This type of power is unsuitable for use with a computer or mobile 
device, which requires a direct current (DC) ranging from 5 to more than 15 volts. The 
power supply or laptop AC adapter converts the wall outlet AC power into DC power 
(Figure 6-19). Different motherboards and ­computers require different wattages on the 
power supply. If a power supply is not providing the necessary power, the computer will not 
function properly.
Consider This
How many fans are in a desktop case?
Most have at least three fans: one in the power supply, one in the case, and one on the processor heat sink. In 
addition, you also might find a fan on a video card or other adapter card. While some computers contain fans that 
are designed to be quiet or operate in quiet mode, others allow you to turn off noisy fans until they are needed. 
You also can purchase programs that slow or stop the fan until the temperature reaches a certain level.

Built into the power supply is a fan that keeps the power supply cool. Some have variable 
speed fans that change speed or stop running, depending on temperature in the case. Many 
newer computers have additional fans near certain components in the system unit, such as the 
processor, hard drive, and ports. Some users install more fans to help dissipate heat generated by 
the components of the computer.
Some external peripheral devices, such as a cable modem, speakers, or a printer, have an AC 
adapter, which is an external power supply. One end of the AC adapter plugs in the wall outlet 
and the other end attaches to the peripheral. The AC adapter converts the AC power into the 
DC power that the peripheral requires, and also often charges the battery in a mobile computer 
or device.
Mobile computers and devices can run using either a power supply or batteries. The ­batteries 
typically are rechargeable lithium-ion batteries (Figure 6-20). Some mobile devices and 
­computers, such as some ultrathin laptops, do not have removable ­batteries.

Mini Feature 6-3: Proper Care for Computers and Mobile Devices
Taking proper care of computers and mobile devices not only will help prolong their life, but 
also will keep them running optimally. Read Mini Feature 6-3 to learn about properly caring for 
computers and mobile devices.
Ethics & Issues 6-4
Should Businesses Be Allowed to Make 
Policies Regarding Customer Mobile 
Phone Use?
Diners who use mobile devices while at a 
restaurant or moviegoers whose devices 
make noise or light up an otherwise dark 
theater can cause distractions and frustra-
tions for employees and other patrons. One 
deli counter posted a sign that said it would 
not serve customers until they put away 
their phone. Another similar business said it 
would levy an additional charge to anyone 
using a phone while ordering, stating that 
“It’s rude.”
Restaurant owners who want to ban 
mobile phones insist that “distracted dining” 
adds considerably to the time a customer 
spends occupying a table, which results in 
more time elapsing before the restaurant can 
seat new customers. Food service may be 
slower because customers are not promptly 
reading the menu and deciding on their 
order. This has prompted many owners to 
adopt a zero tolerance policy for mobile 
phone use. One movie theater escorted a 
patron from the theater for refusing to turn 
off her phone. The theater argued that the 
purchase of a ticket, which states that it can 
refuse service without a refund for anyone 
causing disturbances, is a contract.
You can expect to see more and more 
restaurants, movie theaters, and other 
businesses posting or stating guidelines 
for use of mobile devices beyond asking 
customers to silence their devices. Some 
businesses institute rules that state 
acceptable use for mobile phones, rather 
than an outright ban. Many businesses 
designate mobile phone areas. Others give 
a discount for patrons who leave devices 
with the host or front desk. Still others allow 
use of photography, as long as no flash is 
involved. One etiquette blogger suggested 
that patrons dining in a group stack their 
phones in the middle of the table. Whoever 
first reaches for his or her phone must pay 
the entire bill.
Consider This: Do businesses have a right 
to refuse service or otherwise restrict phone 
usage by customers? Why or why not? Is it 
ever acceptable to use a mobile phone in a 
restaurant or theater? Under what circum-
stances? Have you ever been negatively 
affected by another person’s inappropri-
ate use of a mobile phone? How did you 
resolve the problem?
Consider This
How often do batteries for mobile computers and devices need to be replaced?
Battery life depends on usage. While some may last several years, you may need to replace a battery much 
sooner than that. When the battery no longer can hold a charge, you should replace it with a battery made by, 
or recommended by, the manufacturer of the computer or device. Read Ethics & Issues 6-4 to consider issues 
surrounding mobile phone policies.

Proper Care  
for Computers  
and Mobile Devices
Caring for a computer or mobile device requires 
­keeping hardware in good condition and maintaining 
programs and apps.
Hardware Maintenance
Before performing any of the following steps to care 
for your computer or mobile device, turn off and unplug 
the device from its power source. If the computer or 
mobile device has a removable battery, you also should 
remove the battery. All hardware maintenance should be 
performed in an area that is clean and free from clutter.
• Use a damp cloth to clean the screen gently. Do not 
use any special cleaners to clean the display, as they 
may damage the display. Water is sufficient to remove 
dust and most dirt. Read How To 6-5 for additional 
ways to protect screens and replace them if necessary.
•  If the computer or mobile device has a keyboard, use 
a can of compressed air to free the keyboard from 
any dirt and debris that might inter-
fere with the operation of the keys 
or pose a risk of getting inside the 
computer or mobile device. When 
using compressed air, hold the can 
upright, and not at an angle, when 
dispensing the air. Holding the can 
at an angle can cause the can to 
dispense a very cold liquid instead 
of air, which can damage compo-
nents in your computer or mobile 
device.
•  If you are transporting a laptop, 
be sure to store it in a case with 
plenty of padding. If you are using 
a mobile device, protect it with a 
case. A case will protect the device better in the event 
you drop it and may make it easier for you to grip the 
device while using it.
• If the computer or mobile device has an air vent where 
a fan removes heat, make sure the vent is free of dust 
and debris. A blocked vent can prohibit heat from 
escaping, which ultimately can cause the ­computer or 
mobile device to overheat. If the air vent is dirty, con-
tact a trained professional to have it cleaned properly. 
Improperly cleaning an air vent can result in more 
debris entering the computer or mobile device.
• When you insert media such as an optical disc, be 
sure the media is clean. Inserting dirty media can 
damage a computer or mobile device’s internal 
components.
Software Maintenance
Maintaining the software on your computers and 
mobile devices can help them run optimally. While no spe-
cific recommendation exists for the frequency with which 
you should perform the following actions, you should do 
so if you begin to notice a decline in your computer or 
mobile device’s performance.
• Uninstall programs and remove apps you no longer 
need on your computer or mobile device. These pro-
grams and apps may consume a significant amount 
of space on your storage medium and decrease the 
performance of your computer or mobile device. 
More information about uninstalling programs 
and removing apps can be found in How To 4-4 in 
Chapter 4.
• If you are using a desktop or laptop, defragment 
the computer’s hard disk if you notice a decline 
in the computer’s performance. More information 
about ­defragmenting can be found in the Disk 
­Defragmenter section in Chapter 4.
• Install programs and apps only from reputable 
­software manufacturers. In addition, make sure you 
are installing the program or app from the original 
installation media, the software manufacturer’s 
website, or from your mobile device’s app store 
or marketplace. You also should read reviews for 
programs and apps before you download and/or 
install them to make sure the program or app will 
meet your needs.

Protect and Replace Screens
One way to protect the screen on your 
mobile device is to use a screen protector. 
A screen protector is a thin plastic film 
that adheres to the screen of your device. 
While screen protectors may not protect 
the screen if you drop your device or an 
object impacts it with excessive force, it 
will protect the screen from minor scratches 
obtained through normal use. Screen pro-
tectors often can be purchased from the 
same place you bought your mobile device 
and also are available online. If you cannot 
find a screen protector that is the exact 
same size as the screen on your mobile 
device, you can purchase a larger one and 
then trim it to fit your screen.
In the event the screen on your 
mobile device breaks, the following 
steps will guide you through the process 
of replacing it. Even if your device 
continues to work with a broken screen, 
you still should replace it as soon as 
possible to avoid injury. NOTE: Screen 
replacement should be attempted 
only by advanced users. If you are 
uncomfortable following these steps, 
seek help from a trained professional. 
In addition, the exact steps to replace 
a broken screen can vary with each 
device. If the steps for your device 
vary from the steps listed below, 
follow the instructions from your 
device’s manufacturer.
1.	 Back up the data on your mobile device 
before starting a screen replacement. 
While a successful screen replacement 
should not threaten the data, it is a good 
idea to keep a backup in case a problem 
arises unexpectedly.
2.	 Turn off the mobile device and disconnect 
it from all power sources. If the device 
uses a removable battery, remove it.
3.	 Protect your hands and eyes before 
­beginning glass replacement.
4.	 If possible, carefully remove all pieces of 
broken glass. Consider using compressed 
air to remove any dust.
5.	 Remove the display assembly. Refer to 
your device’s documentation for informa-
tion about removing the display. You may 
need a small, nonmagnetic screwdriver 
and/or metal or plastic tool to remove 
the assembly. If the display assembly is 
­connected to the mobile device with a 
cable, carefully disconnect the cable.
6.	 Unpack the new screen and connect it to 
the mobile device, connecting any neces-
sary cables.
7.	 Reassemble the mobile device, reconnect 
the power source and/or the battery, and 
turn on the device.

a cracked screen instead of replacing the 
entire mobile device?

How does an antistatic wristband work?
When working with electronic components, such as a motherboard, you should wear an antistatic wristband. An 
antistatic wristband is a bracelet designed to protect electronics from an electrostatic discharge by preventing 
a buildup of static electricity on a user. The wristband has an attached clip that you connect to any bare metal 
surface, which acts as a ground.

Publishing
Today, virtually any printed material that you 
read exists additionally in electronic form. In 
publishing’s early years, and before comput-
ers existed, authors and writers recorded 
content using a typewriter, which then would 
be duplicated and bound into a publication. 
When word processors were introduced, 
writers not only could type their work, but 
also were able to apply basic formatting and 
check their spelling. While typewriters and 
word processors performed their tasks ade-
quately, they pale in comparison to the extent 
to which today’s computers and mobile 
devices have improved the publishing process.
Before computers and other related 
technological advances, publishing a 
book would be a very long process. After 
the authors wrote a manuscript, it was 
converted into a form that was ready to 
print; the printing process then could take 
several weeks to complete. Today, authors 
can use programs and apps to write material 
in a format that will require minimal, if any, 
conversion before it is ready to print.
Many book, magazine, and newspaper 
publishers are turning away from the 
print medium and encouraging consumers 
to read content electronically. In fact, 
some publishers are turning exclusively 
to publishing in electronic form and 
abandoning the print medium altogether. 
As mentioned previously in this book, you 
can read book content or magazine and 
newspaper articles either on the web or 
using an e-book reader. Content on the 
web usually is available free or for a fee. For 
example, some newspapers allow people 
to read articles for free, while others may 
charge a digital subscription fee. If you are 
using an e-book reader, you often have to 
pay to download and read content, although 
some items are available for free.
Programs and apps, including web apps, 
also are enabling individuals to publish 
content themselves. Individuals easily can 
publish content to a blog on the web, or 
they can use an app to create and publish 
an e-book for others to purchase and 
download.
Many libraries also are taking advantage 
of advances in technology by enabling 
users to check out books electronically. 
Similar to a print book, library patrons can 
reserve an e-book on their computer or 
mobile device. When the 
e-book is available, it will 
download to the user’s 
computer or mobile 
device automatically. 
When the e-book is due 
or when the user decides 
to return the book, it 
will remove itself from 
the user’s computer or 
mobile device. While 
many people believe 
that libraries can check 
out unlimited copies 
of the same e-book 
simultaneously, this 
is not true. Libraries 
are able to check out 
simultaneously only the 
number of copies, or licenses, of the e-book 
they purchase. For example, if a library 
purchases two licenses of an e-book, only 
two copies of that e-book can be checked 
out simultaneously. If a third user wants to 
check out this e-book, he or she must wait 
for one copy to be returned.
Technology has greatly improved the 
publishing industry. Not only is content 
published more quickly and in an easily 
accessible form, but it also now is less prone 
to errors because the development process 
is much more streamlined.

computers and technology play a role in the 
publishing industry?

1	 Conserve Battery Life of Mobile Computers 
and Devices
As consumers rely on mobile computers and devices 
more and more every day, it is increasingly important for 
the battery life on these devices to support high usage 
demands. Unfortunately, battery life on these devices 
often is not sufficient for many users to make it through-
out the day with moderate activity on their devices. For 
this reason, it is important to conserve battery life so that 
a mobile computer or device can remain functional until 
it is possible to connect it to a battery charger. The fol-
lowing steps guide you through the process of conserving 
battery life on mobile computers and devices:
a. When you first obtain a new mobile computer 
or device or purchase a new battery for your 
computer or mobile device, charge the battery 
completely. Most new mobile computers and 
devices will indicate how long to charge the battery 
before its first use. Refrain from using the device 
before the battery is fully charged.
b. Charge the battery only when it is drained 
completely. Many batteries on computers and 
mobile devices can be charged only a certain 
number of times before they fail completely. For 
this reason, you should charge batteries only when 
absolutely necessary.
c. When you charge your mobile computer or device, 
try not to unplug the battery charger until the 
battery is charged completely.
d. Use the battery charger supplied with the mobile 
computer or device. Connecting inexpensive 
battery chargers from other vendors may damage 
the battery.
e. If you want to use the mobile computer or device 
while it is plugged in to an external power source, 
remove the battery, if possible, if it is fully charged. 
Leaving the mobile computer or device connected 
to an external power source while the battery has a 
full charge can shorten the life of the battery.
f. If you are using a laptop or tablet, disable Wi-Fi 
and Bluetooth unless you are using them.
g. Adjust the display’s brightness. Brighter displays 
consume more battery life, so keep the display as 
dim as you can without having to strain your eyes.
h. Download and install an app that will inform you 
which other apps are running and consuming battery 
life. If an app does not need to run, you should exit it 
so that the app does not consume your battery.
i. Avoid turning your mobile computer or device on 
and off multiple times per day. The power-saving 
features on mobile computers and devices often 
require less power than turning on your computer 
or mobile device from a powered-off state.
j. Turn off automatic app update capabilities on your 
phone or mobile device, so that your device is not 
constantly checking for new apps and downloading 
them to your device.
Exercises
1. What other ways can you think of to conserve the 
battery life on your mobile computer or device?
2. Approximately how long do batteries on your mobile 
computers and devices last before they no longer are 
able to hold a charge?
3. What else can shorten the battery life on a mobile 
computer or device?
2	 Locate a Lost Mobile Computer or Device
Mobile computers and devices sometimes contain a 
­feature that can help you locate it in the event you lose 
it. If the device does not contain this feature, you may 
be able to download and install an app that can help 
you track its location. The following steps guide you 
through the ­process of locating a lost mobile computer 
or device.
Instructions: You often can complete tasks using technology in multiple ways. Figure out how to perform the tasks described in these exercises 
by using one or more resources available to you (such as a computer or mobile device, articles on the web or in print, online or program help, user 
guides, blogs, podcasts, videos, other individuals, trial and error, etc.). Summarize your ‘how to’ steps, along with the resource(s) used, in the format 
requested by your instructor (brief report, presentation, discussion, blog post, video, or other means).
How To: Your Turn 
The How To: Your Turn exercises present general guidelines for fundamental skills 
when using a computer or mobile device and then require that you determine how to 
apply these general guidelines to a specific program or situation.

3	 Run Diagnostic Tools and Check for 
Computer Hardware Errors
If your computer is not functioning properly and 
you believe the problem is related to the computer’s 
­hardware, you can run diagnostic tools to check for 
hardware errors. If the diagnostic tool identifies a 
hardware error, you then can communicate informa-
tion about the error to technical support personnel so 
that they either can correct the problem or suggest 
replacing the problematic hardware. The ­following 
steps guide you through the process of running 
­diagnostic tools and checking for hardware errors.
Obtain Diagnostic Tools
Your computer may have included diagnostic tools you 
can use to check for hardware errors. If it did not include 
diagnostic tools, follow these steps to download diagnostic 
tools from the computer manufacturer’s website:

b. Tap or click the necessary links to display 
information about the computer.
c. Tap or click the link to display a page containing 
drivers and/or downloads for the computer’s 
model.
d. Browse for a diagnostic tool that you can download 
to your computer.
e. Some diagnostic tools can run within the operating 
system, and some require that you copy them to 
an optical disc or USB flash drive so that you can 
start the computer from this media and run the 
diagnostic tools. If necessary, copy the diagnostic 
tools to an optical disc or USB flash drive.
Run Diagnostic Tools
a. Run the program containing the diagnostic tools. 
If you copied the diagnostic tools to an optical disc 
or USB flash drive, restart the computer with the 
optical disc or USB flash drive inserted, and be sure 
to select the option to boot (start) from that device.
b. Select the option to scan all computer hardware for 
errors.
c. Begin the scan. Please note that because the 
program is scanning all hardware, it may take some 
time to complete. Some specific tests during the 
scan will require input from you, so watch the 
computer closely while the scan is in progress.
d. When the scan is complete, note any errors 
and, if desired, report them to the computer 
manufacturer’s technical support team.
e. When the scan is complete, if necessary, restart the 
computer.
Exercises
1. What might cause you to use diagnostic tools to scan a 
computer for hardware errors?
2. After scanning your computer for hardware errors,

4	 Determine How Much Memory Is Being 
Used on Your Computer or Mobile Device
If your computer or mobile device is running slowly, it 
could be running low on memory. A number of factors 
can contribute to the slow performance, but checking 
the memory usage is fast and easy. If the computer or 
mobile device’s memory is almost all used, you may be 
able to determine which programs and apps are using 
the most memory. Exiting these programs and apps may 
make more memory available and increase a computer or 
mobile device’s performance. The following steps guide 
you through the process of determining how much mem-
ory is being used on a computer or mobile device.
a. Restart the computer or mobile device.
b. If necessary, sign in to the operating system.
c. Navigate to the window or screen showing a list of 
running tasks. On a computer, you may be able to 
search for the Task Manager or Activity Monitor. 
On a mobile device, a list of running processes may 
be found in the system settings.
d. Tap or click the option to show the list of running 
processes. This list will show you how much memory 
each process is using. This list also includes the 
programs and apps 
currently running. 
If you notice that a 
program or app is 
consuming a high 
amount of memory, 
consider exiting the 
program or app to 
make the memory 
available.
e.  When you are 
finished, return 
to the desktop or 
home screen.
Exercises
1. How much memory is installed on your computer or 
mobile device? How much currently is being used?
2. Which three processes are using the largest amount of 
memory on your computer or mobile device?
3. If the programs and apps you run consume nearly all 
available memory on your computer or mobile device, 
what additional steps might you be able to take?
5	 Check Your Computer’s Hardware 
Configuration
If you are experiencing a problem with a hardware 
­component on your computer, you can check the 
­computer’s hardware configuration to determine 
the manufacturer’s name and model number for the 
­hardware in question. With this information, you then 
can search for ways to correct the problem. Alternatively, 
if you reinstall the operating system on the computer, 
you may check the computer’s hardware configuration to 
make sure the operating system is recognizing correctly 
all hardware connected to the computer. The following 
steps guide you through the process of checking a com-
puter’s hardware configuration.
a. If you are using a Mac, display the Apple menu 
and then select the option to display information 
about the computer. If you are running Windows, 
display the Control Panel.
b. Navigate to the area that displays information 
about the hardware and devices currently 
connected to the computer. (Hint: In Windows, 
display the Device Manager. On a Mac, display the 
System Report.)
c. Tap or click the categories of hardware devices to 
see details related to those types of devices.
d. If you are familiar with the hardware devices on 
the computer, verify that the operating system is 
recognizing these devices correctly.
e. If you notice a problem with the operating system 
detecting any of these devices, you might need 
to run the installation software and/or install 
the drivers for the hardware device so that the 
operating system can communicate with the device. 
If necessary, contact the computer manufacturer’s 
technical support for assistance.
Exercises
1. List at least three hardware devices listed in the 
System Report or in the Device Manager.
2. In addition to the reasons mentioned above, what are 
some other reasons why you might want to check the 
hardware configuration on a computer?
3. What steps can you take if one or more hardware 
devices are not identified by your computer?

1	 Making Use of the Web 
Content Aggregation and Curation
Locating valuable information to read on particular 
­topics or to share with your online social network may 
take some effort. To help find material, you may want to 
use content aggregation, an automated process that uses 
keywords to gather and filter materials someone else has 
written or produced on the Internet. Another option is 
content curation, which is a manual process of acquiring 
this information and then expanding the content into 
original and useful material to post. A good content cura-
tor can edit the content to share, add annotations and 
notes, give attributions to the original source, and provide 
additional viewpoints. As a starting point, Twitter and 
blog feeds, bookmarking tools such as StumbleUpon, and 
services that provide email notifications, such as Google 
Alerts, provide the opportunity to view webpages, photos, 
videos, and additional material about celebrities, sports, 
politics, businesses, and other people and subjects.
Research This: (a) Visit StumbleUpon and two other 
bookmarking services. If necessary, sign in to these 
services and compare the features. How do users select 
the categories to view? What information is required 
to create a profile? What opportunities for feedback 
are provided? What procedure would users follow to 
delete their profiles and terminate their accounts?
(b) Visit Google Alerts and two other email alerting 
services. If necessary, create an alert for at least two 
words for which you would want to receive email 
notifications. What options are available to customize 
these alerts? For example, can you specify the frequency 
of the alerts, the types of websites to search, the 
geographical region, or the number of messages sent?
2	 Social Media 
Companies review the conversations, comments, 
complaints, and feedback written on online social net-
works to obtain valuable information that ultimately 
enhances developing or improving products and ser-
vices. In some cases, companies have asked consumers 
to view videos of product demonstrations, Tweet their 
immediate impressions, and suggest improvements. 
Small companies with limited marketing and adver-
tising budgets, in particular, increasingly view social 
media as an inexpensive means of building relation-
ships with and among customers. Social media users 
interact with others who have similar interests and 
exchange information about their experiences. In gen-
eral, companies have found that customers are eager 
to provide feedback and recommend improvements.
Research This: View at least two automotive ­websites 
and describe the social media that are ­featured. 
Choose one of the websites and review the content. 
What ­topics are being discussed? In which ways 
is the company encouraging participation, such as 
by ­sponsoring contests or providing ­opportunities 
for consumers to upload photos and videos? Can 
­consumers create an account to share advice, rate and 
review vehicles, and discuss mechanical issues?
3	 Search Skills 
Limiting Search Results by Website, Date, 
and Location
You can instruct a search engine to look for results 
on a specific website that match your search text. To 
do so, in your search text include the operator site: 
followed by a domain name you would like to search, 
with no spaces between the colon and the domain 
name. For example, to read articles from the Cnet 
website about solid state drives, type the search text, 
site:cnet.com "solid state drives".
Some search engines provide additional search tools 
to specify a date range such as the past day, week, or 
month, to limit your results. Limiting search results by 
date can help you to find current information because 
the search engine will return results published during 
Instructions: Use a search engine or another search tool to locate the information requested or answers to questions presented in the exercises. 
Describe your findings, along with the search term(s) you used and your web source(s), in the format requested by your instructor (brief report, 
presentation, discussion, blog post, video, or other means).

4	 Security 
More than 3 million smartphones are stolen each year, 
according to a Consumer Reports survey. In addition, 
1.4 million smartphone users never have recovered 
a lost phone. Secure IT 6-1 in this chapter describes 
categories of products that can help secure and track 
hardware that has been stolen or lost.
Research This: Which apps are available for 
your smartphone to erase data remotely? Which 
­location-tracking apps allow you to take a photo of 
the thief and then send an email message that ­contains 
the image to you automatically? If your device is 
lost and you file a police report, you will need the 
d­evice’s serial number. Locate that number now and 
write it on a piece of paper. Also, locate the phone’s 
15-digit ­International ­Mobile Equipment Identity 
(IMEI) ­number and record that number. Store the 
­document with these two ­numbers in a secure location. 
In ­addition, ­research the efforts by the U.S. Federal 
Communications ­Commission (FCC) and the Cellular 
­Telecommunications Industry ­Association (CTIA) to 
create a centralized database of lost and stolen ­mobile 
phones. What is the status of this ­database? What 
legislation has been proposed or passed that requires 
wireless carriers and phone ­manufacturers to develop 
technological solutions that can curb the growing 
­problem of violent smartphone theft?
5	 Cloud Services 
Public, Private, Hybrid, and Personal  
Clouds (IaaS)
When deciding how to host data and apps on the 
cloud, companies often choose between sharing a 
server on the cloud with other organizations, config-
uring a dedicated server on the cloud, or using both 
options. Companies must consider the type of data 
involved and the level of security required to keep it 
safe. Public, private, and hybrid clouds are examples 
of IaaS (infrastructure as a service), a service of cloud 
computing that uses a provider’s hardware to manage, 
store and access files and apps over the Internet. On a 
public cloud, several companies store data or apps on 
the same physical server on the cloud. On a private 
cloud, a company has its own servers in the cloud to 
host its apps and data. On a hybrid cloud, organiza-
tions may host confidential data on a private cloud and 
rely on a public cloud for information that does not 
require such a high degree of security.
Individual users may set up a personal cloud by 
purchasing a networked hard drive. A networked hard 
drive connects directly to a router, providing access to 
its files over the Internet. This is a useful solution for 
having access to files from several devices.
Research This: (1) Use a search engine to find IaaS 
providers that offer public, private, and hybrid cloud 
solutions. Summarize the different solutions they pro-
vide. (2) Under what circumstances might an individual 
or enterprise set up a public, private, or hybrid cloud? 
(3) Research networked hard drive models from differ-
ent manufacturers. Compare their costs, storage sizes, 
and additional features to consider when creating a 
personal cloud. (4) When might you create a personal 
cloud instead of using a cloud storage provider?

Critical Thinking
Instructions: Evaluate the situations below, using personal experiences and one or more resources available to you (such as articles on the web or 
in print, blogs, podcasts, videos, television, user guides, other individuals, electronics or computer stores, etc.). Perform the tasks requested in each 
­exercise and share your deliverables in the format requested by your instructor (brief report, presentation, discussion, blog post, video, or other means).
The Critical Thinking exercises challenge your assessment and decision-making skills by 
presenting real-world situations associated with chapter concepts. The Collaboration 
exercise should be completed with a team.
1.	Cloud Storage 
The owner of the motorcycle repair shop where you 
work as a part-time office manager is seeking alter-
natives to using a network server to store and back 
up files. She asks you to investigate the feasibility of 
using cloud storage, rather than purchasing additional 
storage media for the company’s computers, mobile 
devices, and network servers.
Do This: Analyze the advantages and disadvantages of 
using cloud storage. Include in your discussion security 
concerns, costs, and a comparison between two different 
cloud storage offerings. Which company offers the bet-
ter arrangement? Why? Explore one other area of cloud 
computing, such as SaaS (software as a service), and 
determine how the service might benefit the shop. Find 
three providers of the cloud service and compare prices, 
user reviews, and features. List the risks and benefits of 
using the cloud for storage and other services.
2.	Upgrading Memory 
You are an IT consultant at a bank. An analyst at the 
bank is complaining that her laptop is performing 
slowly. You determine that the laptop’s memory is 
insufficient for the complex calculations and reports 
the analyst is running.
Do This: Search the web to learn more about current 
memory modules available to increase memory capac-
ity. Evaluate the differences among various options, 
including type, size, speed, and price. Find articles 
from industry experts that list methods and recom-
mendations for upgrading a laptop’s memory. Also 
determine how to add memory to a laptop, obtain-
ing answers to the following questions: How can you 
determine the type and correct amount of memory to 
add? Why should you not purchase more memory than 
your ­computer can support? How do you determine 
the available slots for memory modules? What safety 
measures should you take when upgrading memory? 
Is it better to upgrade the memory or purchase a new 
laptop?
3.	Case Study
Amateur Sports League You are the new ­manager 
for a nonprofit amateur soccer league. You recently 
purchased replacement smartphones for yourself and 
another employee, along with an upgraded tablet that 
the staff can use. Because you are discarding the outdated 
devices, the league’s board of directors is concerned about 
how to secure and protect data when selling, donating, 
or recycling the devices. The board asked you to prepare 
information it can use in a press release to educate the 
league’s customers about keeping data secure when dis-
carding a device.
Do This: Determine the possible steps needed to 
wipe the memory and storage media in the devices. 
What kind of data is important to delete? Why? What 
are the risks of not wiping the memory and storage me-
dia in a device before you discard it? What responsibil-
ity does the league have to protect members’ personal 
data? Why? Does choosing whether to sell, donate, or 
recycle the devices change your approach and need to 
wipe the devices’ memory? Why or why not?

4.	Mobile Device Batteries  You work in the IT department for a large publishing company that just purchased new 
tablets for all employees. The department manager asked you to prepare information about how to conserve the battery 
life of the tablets.
Do This: Form a three-member team. Each member of your team should choose a different type of tablet. Find 
information about the battery life for each device type, including recommendations for use by the manufacturer and 
user reviews of the device and its chargers. Research apps that track battery life. Search for articles by industry experts 
that give tips on conserving the battery life of a tablet. Meet with your team, and discuss and compile your findings. 
Which tablet would you recommend? Why? How does the charger affect the battery life? What did you learn about 
battery conservation? Which apps would you recommend? Why?

What Is Input?
Input is any data and instructions entered into the memory of a computer. As shown in 
Figure 7-1, people have a variety of options for entering data and instructions into a computer.
As discussed in Chapter 1, data is a collection of unprocessed items, including text, numbers, 
images, audio, and video. Once data is in memory, a computer or mobile device interprets and 
executes instructions to process the data into information. Instructions that a computer or mobile 
device processes can be in the form of software (programs and apps), commands, and user responses.
• Software is a series of related instructions, organized for a common purpose, that tells a 
computer or mobile device what tasks to perform and how to perform them. When software 
developers write programs or apps, they usually enter the instructions into the computer or 
mobile device by using a keyboard, mouse, or other input method. The software developer 
then stores the program in a file that a user can execute (run). When a user runs a program 
or app, the computer or mobile device loads the program or app from a storage medium into 
memory. Thus, a program or app is entered into a computer’s or mobile device’s memory.
• A command is an instruction that causes a program or app to perform a specific action. 
Programs and apps respond to commands that a user issues. Users issue commands by 
touching an area on a screen, pressing keys on the keyboard, clicking a mouse button to 
control a pointer on the screen, or speaking into a microphone.
• A user response is an instruction a user issues by responding to a message displayed by a 
program or app. A response to the message instructs the program or app to perform certain 
actions. For example, when a program or app asks the question, ‘Do you want to save the 
changes made to this file?’, and you respond with the instruction of ‘Yes’, the program will 
save the file with the changes you made. If you respond with the instruction of ‘No’, the 
program will not save your changes before exiting.
Commonly used input methods include the keyboard, pointing devices, touch screens, pen 
input, motion input, voice input, video input, and scanners and reading devices. This chapter 
discusses each of these input methods.

Keyboards
Most computers and mobile devices include a keyboard or keyboarding capabilities. As discussed 
in previous chapters, a keyboard is an input device that contains keys you press to enter data and 
instructions into a computer or mobile device. Nearly all keyboards have a typing area, function keys, 
toggle keys, and navigation keys (Figure 7-2). Many also include media control buttons, Internet 
control buttons, and other special keys. Others may include a fingerprint reader or a pointing device.
• The typing area includes letters of the alphabet, numbers, punctuation marks, and other basic 
keys. Read Secure IT 7-1 to learn about software that can track your keystrokes.
• Function keys, which are labeled with the letter F followed by a number, are special keys 
programmed to issue commands to a computer. The command associated with a function key 
may vary, depending on the program you are using.
• A toggle key is a key that switches between two states each time a user presses the key. caps 
lock and num lock are examples of toggle keys. Many mobile devices have keys that 
toggle the display of alphabetic, numeric, and symbols on touch keyboards in order to display 
more characters and symbols on a keyboard with fewer keys.
• Users can press the navigation keys, such as arrow keys and page up/pg up and page down/
pg dn on the keyboard, to move the insertion point in an application left, right, up, or down.
• A keyboard shortcut is one or more keyboard keys that you press to perform an operating 
system or application-related task. Some keyboard shortcuts are unique to a particular 
application or operating system.
• Media control buttons allow you to control a media player program, access the computer’s 
optical disc drive, and adjust speaker volume.
• Internet control buttons allow you to run an email application, run a browser, and search the web.

Types of Keyboards
Desktops include a standard keyboard. Standard ­keyboards 
typically have from 101 to 105 keys, which include function 
keys along the top and a numeric keypad on the right (shown 
in the top keyboard in Figure 7-2).
As discussed in previous chapters, you have a variety of  
keyboard options for mobile computers and devices (Figure 7-3). 
These devices often use a compact keyboard, which is smaller 
than a standard keyboard and usually does not include the 
numeric keypad or navigation keys. Typically, the keys on a 
compact keyboard serve two or three purposes in order to pro-
vide the same functionality as standard keyboards. Some com-
pact keyboards are built into the computer or mobile device 
and/or are permanently attached with hinges, a sliding mecha-
nism, or some other technique. Other compact keyboards are 
separate devices that communicate wirelessly or attach to the 
computer or device with a magnet, clip, or other mechanism. 
Some users prefer to work with on-screen or virtual keyboards 
instead of a physical keyboard. Others, however, prefer to use 
a standard keyboard with their mobile devices because these 
keyboards provide added ­functionality and tactile comfort.
Secure IT 7-1
Keyboard Monitoring
Some employers and parents want to monitor 
everything that has been entered into a com-
puter to ensure that employees and children are 
using the computer for appropriate purposes. 
They may use keyboard monitoring software, 
also called keylogging software, to accomplish 
this task. This software runs undetected and 
stores every keystroke in a file for later retrieval.
These programs have both criminal and 
beneficial purposes. When used in a positive 
fashion, employers can measure the efficiency 
of data entry personnel. This software also 
can verify that employees are not releasing 
company secrets, are not viewing personal 
or inappropriate content on work computers, 
and are not engaging in activities that could 
subject the company to harassment, hacking, 
or other similar charges. Employers sometimes 
use the software to troubleshoot technical 
problems and to back up their networks. 
Parents, likewise, can verify their children are 
using the home computer safely and are not 
visiting inappropriate websites. Educators and 
researchers can capture students’ input to 
analyze how well they are learning a second 
language or improving their typing skills. This 
software also can monitor activity in chat 
rooms and other similar locations.
When used for malicious purposes, 
criminals use the programs on both public 
and private computers to capture user 
names, passwords, credit card numbers, and 
other sensitive data and then use this data 
to access financial accounts and private 
networks.
Many keylogging programs are available, 
and they perform a variety of functions. 
Some simply record keystrokes in a hidden 
file stored on the hard drive that can be 
accessed by supplying the correct password. 
More sophisticated programs record 
software used, websites visited, and periodic 
screenshots and then transmit this data to a 
remote computer.
It can be difficult to locate keylogging 
software on a computer, but taking these 
steps may help detect the programs:
• Run detection software regularly. ­Several 
antivirus and spyware detection programs 
check for known keylogging programs.
• Review hard drive files. Regularly look 
at the most recent files and note any that 
are updated continually. These files might 
be the keylogging software’s logs.
• Check running programs. Periodically 
examine which software is loaded from the 
computer’s hard drive into memory when you 
start the computer and which are running 
while you are using the computer. If you are 
uncertain of any program names, perform a 
search to learn the software’s function and if 
it is a known keylogging program.
  Consider This: Do you know anyone 
who has installed keylogging software or who 
has found keylogging software installed on 
his or her computer? Is keylogging software 
an invasion of privacy? Should employers 
inform employees if the software is installed? 
Why or why not?

What is the rationale for the arrangement of keys in the typing area?
The keys originally were arranged on old mechanical typewriters to separate frequently used keys, which caused 
typists to slow down. This arrangement, called a QWERTY keyboard because the six first letters on the top row of 
letter keys spell QWERTY, reduced the frequency with which the mechanical levers jammed.

An ergonomic keyboard has a design that reduces the chance of 
repetitive strain injuries (RSIs) of wrist and hand (Figure 7-4). 
Recall that the goal of ergonomics is to incorporate comfort, 
efficiency, and safety in the design of the workplace. Even 
­keyboards that are not ergonomically designed attempt to offer 
a user more comfort by including a wrist rest.
A gaming keyboard is a keyboard designed specifically for 
users who enjoy playing games on the computer. Gaming 
keyboards typically include programmable keys so that gam-
ers can customize the keyboard to the game being played. 
The keys on gaming keyboards light up so that the keys are visible in all lighting conditions. 
Some have small displays that show important game statistics, such as time or targets remaining.

Why use a wireless keyboard?
Although some keyboards connect via a cable to a USB port on the computer, some users choose a wireless 
keyboard to eliminate the clutter of a cord and/or to free USB ports for other uses. A wireless keyboard is a battery-
powered device that transmits data to the computer or mobile device using wireless technology. For example, 
Bluetooth keyboards are especially popular with tablets because they do not require a USB port and are easy to 
pair with computers and devices. Many vendors offer tablet cases with a built-in Bluetooth keyboard so that you 
easily can transport a keyboard with the tablet.
	
Pointing Devices
In a graphical user interface, a pointer is a small symbol on the screen whose location and 
shape change as a user moves a pointing device. A pointing device can enable you to select text, 
­graphics, and other objects, such as buttons, icons, links, and menu commands. The following 
pages discuss a variety of pointing devices.
Mouse
A mouse is a pointing device that fits under the palm of your hand comfortably. As you move 
a mouse, the pointer on the screen also moves. The bottom of a mouse is flat and contains a 
mechanism that detects movement of the mouse. Desktop users have an optical mouse or a 
touch mouse, both of which can be placed on nearly all types of flat surfaces (Figure 7-5).
An optical mouse uses optical sensors that emit and sense light to detect the mouse’s movement. 
Similarly, a laser mouse uses laser sensors that emit and sense light to detect the mouse’s movement. 
Some mouse devices use a combination of both technologies. The top and sides of an optical or laser 
mouse may have one to four buttons; some may also have a small wheel. Some are more sensitive 
than others for users requiring more precision, such as graphic artists, engineers, or game players.

A touch mouse is a touch-sensitive mouse that recognizes touch gestures, in addition to 
­detecting movement of the mouse and traditional click and scroll operations. For example, you 
press a location on a touch mouse to simulate a click, sweep your thumb on the mouse to scroll 
pages, or slide multiple fingers across the mouse to zoom.
As with keyboards, you can purchase an ergonomic mouse to help reduce the chance of RSIs 
or to reduce pain and discomfort associated with RSIs.

Why use a wireless mouse?
As with keyboards, some users choose a wireless mouse to eliminate the clutter of a cord. A wireless mouse is a 
battery-powered device that transmits data using wireless technology. A wireless mouse typically transmits data to 
a receiver that plugs in a USB port or uses Bluetooth technology to pair with the device.

What is a pointing stick?
Some mobile computer keyboards contain a pointing stick, which is a pressure-sensitive pointing device shaped like 
a pencil eraser positioned between its keys. To move the pointer using a pointing stick, you push the pointing stick

Touchpad
A touchpad is a small, flat, rectangular pointing device that is sensitive to pressure and motion 
(Figure 7-6). Touchpads are found most often on laptops and convertible tablets. Desktop users 
who prefer the convenience of a touchpad can purchase a separate touchpad, which usually 
­communicates wirelessly with the computer.
To move the pointer using a touchpad, slide your fingertip across the surface of the pad. Some 
touchpads have one or more buttons around the edge of the pad that work like mouse buttons; 
others have no buttons. On most touchpads, you also can tap the pad’s surface to imitate mouse 
operations, such as clicking. Some touchpads also recognize touch gestures, such as swipe, pinch, 
and stretch motions.

Trackpad
Apple uses the term, 
trackpad, to refer to the 
touchpad on its laptops.

Trackball
A trackball is a stationary pointing device with a ball on its top or side. The ball in most 
trackballs is about the size of a Ping-Pong ball. Some devices, called a trackball mouse, combine 
the functionality of both a trackball and a mouse (Figure 7-7).
To move the pointer using a ­trackball, you rotate the ball with your thumb, fingers, or the 
palm of your hand. In addition to the ball, a trackball usually has one or more buttons that work 
like mouse buttons.
Figure 7-7  Shown here is a trackball mouse, which is a single device that provides 
the functionality of both a trackball and a mouse.

Consider This
Why use a trackball instead of a mouse?
For users who have limited desk space, a trackball is a good alternative to a mouse because the device is 
stationary. Keep in mind, however, that a trackball requires frequent cleaning because it picks up oils from fingers 
and dust from the environment.
	
Touch Screens
A touch screen is a touch-sensitive display. Touch screens are convenient because they do not 
require a separate device for input. Smartphones and tablets, and many laptops and all-in-ones 
offer touch screens.
You can interact with a touch screen by touching areas of the screen with your finger or a 
­stylus to make selections or to begin typing. Many touch screens also respond to gestures.  
A gesture is a motion you make on a touch screen with the tip of one or more fingers or your 
hand. For example, you can slide your finger to drag an object or pinch your fingers to zoom 
out. (Read How To 1-1 in Chapter 1 for a description of widely used touch screen gestures.)
Touch screens that recognize multiple points of contact at the same time are known as 
­multi-touch. Because gestures often require the use of multiple fingers (points of contact), touch 
screens that support gestures are multi-touch.
Mini Feature 7-1: Touch Input

Touch Input
Devices that utilize touch input include monitors for 
desktops and screens on laptops and tablets, smart-
phones, wearable devices, portable media players, 
­digital cameras, tablets, kiosks, and navigation systems.
Desktop Monitors and Screens on Laptops 
and Tablets
An increasing number of 
desktop monitors and screens 
on laptops and tablets 
support touch input. These 
touch-enabled monitors and 
screens allow users to inter-
act with the operating system 
without a keyboard or point-
ing device. Instead of using a 
mouse to click an object on 
the screen, users simply can 
tap or double-tap the item 
they otherwise would have 
clicked. For example, users can tap or double-tap an icon 
to run a program or an application, slide their finger to 
scroll, or use their finger to drag items across the screen.
Smartphones
Smartphones are becoming more functional, lighter 
weight, and now often do not include a physical key-
board. Touch input can help smartphone manufacturers 
achieve all these goals. The gestures you might perform 
on a smartphone that supports touch input include 
tapping to run an app, sliding or swiping to scroll, and 
pinching and stretching to zoom. The absence of a 
physical keyboard makes it more difficult to type with-
out looking at the screen, so it is not advisable to use 
a smartphone when performing actions that require 
­undivided attention, such as driving a car or walking.
Wearable Devices
Wearable devices, such as smartwatches, do not have 
room for a physical keyboard, so they mainly rely on 
touch input. The gestures you might perform on a wear-
able device include tapping to make a selection, and 
sliding or swiping to scroll through the various screens.
Portable Media Players
Portable media players widely use touch as the 
­primary method of input so that the size of the screen 
on the device is maximized. That is, space on the device 
does not have to be dedicated to other controls, such 
as buttons or click wheels. Users slide and swipe to 
browse their music libraries on their portable media 
players and then tap to select the song they want to 
play. While songs are playing, users can tap the screen 
to display controls so that they can pause or stop the 
song, navigate to another song, or adjust the volume.
Digital Cameras
As digital cameras start to include built-in features 
to browse through and edit photos without requiring a 
computer, touch input helps digital camera users per-
form these functions with greater accuracy. For example, 
you can perform gestures such as swiping left and right 
on the screen to browse your photos, tapping the screen 
to identify the area on which you wish to focus when 
taking a picture, pinching and stretching to zoom while 
viewing photos, tapping areas of photos to remove 
­red-eye, and dragging borders of photos to crop them.
Kiosks
Touch input also is used on devices where a 
­keyboard and pointing device might not endure its 
high volume of use. Kiosks, such as those at an air-
port allowing you to check in for a flight, can be used 
by hundreds of people per day. Because kiosks are 
designed to help you perform a specific function as 
quickly as possible, touch input is ideal for their user-
friendly interfaces. Users typically interact with kiosks 
by tapping various areas of the screen to select options 
(as discussed in Chapter 3). If typing is required, an 
on-screen keyboard is displayed so that users can enter 
information, such as their name or a confirmation num-
ber. Kiosks requiring sensitive or a significant amount 
of input also might include a separate keyboard and 
pointing device. For example, ATMs with touch screens 
often have a separate keypad to enter your PIN so that 
others are not able to see what you are typing.
Navigation Systems
Navigation systems in cars and other vehicles use 
touch input because typing on a separate keyboard is not 
wise while in a vehicle. Navigation system users 
can perform actions such as tapping to enter a 
destination address, dragging to display different 
areas of the map, or pinching and stretching to 
zoom. Operating a navigation system with touch 
input requires you to take your eyes off the road 
to interact with the device, so you should oper-
ate a navigation system only while your vehicle 
is parked or stopped. To reduce the chances of driver 
distraction, some built-in navigation systems reduce func-
tionality while the vehicle is in motion. Read Ethics &  
Issues 7-1 to consider issues associated with using 
­navigation and other mobile devices while driving.

to learn more about operating systems, monitors, 
smartphones, portable media players, and navigation 
systems that use touch input.
  Consider This: Do you find it is easier to use 
touch input instead of using a keyboard or mouse? 
Does your answer depend on the type of device you are 
using or the task you are trying to accomplish? Why?

Chapter 7  Input and Output
Pen Input
Some displays and mobile devices support pen input. With pen input, you touch a stylus or 
digital pen on a flat surface to write, draw, or make selections.
Stylus
A stylus is a small metal or plastic device that looks like a tiny ink pen but uses pressure 
instead of ink (Figure 7-9). Nearly all tablets and mobile devices, some laptop screens, and a few 
desktop monitors have touch screens that support pen input, in addition to touch input. These 
computers and devices may include a stylus. Some stylus designs include buttons you can press 
to simulate clicking a mouse.
To capture a handwritten signature, a user writes his or her name on a signature capture pad 
with a stylus that is attached to the device. Software then transmits the signature to a central 
computer, where the signature is stored. Retailers use signature capture pads to record purchas-
ers’ signatures. Signature capture pads often work with POS terminals and include a magnetic 
stripe card reader, discussed later in the chapter.
Consider This
What is the purpose of a touch-sensitive pad?
Portable media players that do not have touch 
screens typically have a touch-sensitive pad. A 
touch-sensitive pad is an input device that contains 
buttons and/or wheels you operate with a thumb or 
other finger. Using the touch-sensitive pad, you can 
scroll through and play music; view photos; watch 
videos or movies; navigate through song, photo, 
or movie lists; display a menu; adjust volume; 
customize settings; and perform other actions. For 
example, users can rotate a portable media player’s 
touch-sensitive pad to browse through the device’s 
playlists and press the pad’s buttons to play or 
pause media (Figure 7-8).
	
Ethics & Issues 7-1
Should a Vehicle Be Able to Prevent 
User Input on a Mobile Device while 
the Vehicle is in Motion?
As you are driving, you receive a text 
message from a friend. Is it safe to read 
the text message? Is it legal? Should 
you respond to it? Millions of Americans 
acknowledge that they use mobile phones 
while driving. Today’s newer vehicles 
include sophisticated hands-free systems 
that use Bluetooth and other technologies 
to connect mobile devices to the vehicle’s 
sound system.
Other technologies restrict or block usage 
while a vehicle is moving. Motion sensors can 
detect if the car is in motion. A phone’s camera 
can tell whether the user is the driver or a 
passenger by the angle of the scenery in the 
background. Some cars will not start unless 
the mobile device is plugged into a socket that 
blocks all signals and can send a message to 
a parent if the device is removed. Parents can 
install apps on their children’s smartphones 
that use GPS, cameras, and motion sensors to 
track or restrict teens’ usage.
The debate about mobile phone safety 
while driving elicits different points of view 
from vehicle insurance companies, consumer 
safety groups, and the telecommunications 
industry. The U.S. Department of 
Transportation says that users who text while 
driving have a crash risk 23 times higher 
than those who refrain. In some states, it 
is illegal to send, read, or respond to text 
messages while driving. Other states have 
outlawed the use of mobile phones or they 
require drivers to use hands-free devices 
while driving. Many states have different 
laws for teens or new drivers.
A recent study stated that talking on a 
phone while driving affects drivers’ response 
times as much as if they had consumed 
alcohol. Critics of hands-free and signal 
blocking technology claim that drivers can be 
just as easily distracted if they are discussing 
business or emotional matters.
Consider This: Would you use t­echnology 
that limited your device usage while driv-
ing? Why or why not? Do you think laws 
that target teens or new ­drivers are fair? 
Why or why not? Do you believe hands-free 
devices are safe? Why or why not?

Digital Pen
A digital pen, which is slightly larger than a 
­stylus, is an input device that captures and ­converts a 
user’s handwriting or drawings into a digital format, 
which users can upload (transfer) to a computer or 
mobile device. Some require the user to write or 
draw on special paper or a tablet; others can write 
or draw on any surface (Figure 7-10).
Once uploaded, handwriting ­recognition software 
on the computer or mobile device translates 
the handwritten letters and symbols created on 
the screen into typed text or objects that the 
computer or device can process. For this reason, 
digital pens most often are used for taking notes. 
Some are battery operated or USB powered; 
­others use wireless technology, such as Bluetooth. 
Read Ethics & Issues 7-2 to consider whether 
you should take notes ­electronically or by hand.

Ethics& Issues 7-2
Is It More Efficient to Take Notes by 
Hand or with a Digital Device?
When an instructor starts a lecture, he or 
she looks out at the classroom to see some 
students bent over a tablet, others frantically 
typing on a laptop, and still others using pen 
and paper to take notes. Which method is 
most effective for retaining knowledge?
A recent study concluded that students 
who used traditional pen and paper to take 
notes in class and while studying had better 
understanding and recall of information. 
The study concluded that when taking notes 
on a laptop, students tended to write down 
the speaker’s exact words. Taking notes 
longhand required students to process the 
information, use their own words, and select 
what information is important enough to 
write down. Tablet users tended to have a 
mix of both transcribed and selected content. 
Regardless of the note-taking method, students 
performed equally when asked to recall factual 
information. Laptop users, however, were less 
able to answer conceptual or interpretive 
questions than those who took notes longhand.
Another concern when using laptops and 
mobile devices in a classroom is distractibility. 
Students may receive notifications about 
activity on an online social network, or use 
Internet messaging or text messaging to 
communicate with others about unrelated 
topics. Research shows that laptop users have 
unrelated programs or apps on their screen up 
to 40 percent of class time. Many instructors 
encourage students to use their computers 
and mobile devices for class related purposes.
For example, some encourage students to 
Tweet answers to questions or research 
articles to support a fact or opinion. Others 
provide access to online forums in order for 
students to communicate with one another 
during or after class. 
Consider This: Should instructors inform 
students about the benefits of longhand 
note taking? Why or why not? Should stu-
dents be required to take notes longhand? 
Why or why not? How else might you use 
your computer or mobile device during class 
time to further your own learning?

Graphics Tablet
To use pen input on a ­computer 
that does not have a touch screen, 
you can attach a graphics tablet to 
the computer. A graphics tablet, 
also called a ­digitizer, is an elec-
tronic plastic board that detects 
and converts movements of a stylus 
or digital pen into digital sig-
nals that are sent to the computer 
(Figure 7-11). Each ­location on 
the graphics tablet ­corresponds to 
a specific location on the screen. 
Architects, mapmakers, design-

Motion, Voice, and Video Input
Many of today’s computers, mobile devices, and game devices support motion, voice, and video 
input. The following sections discuss each of these input methods.
Mini Feature 7-2: Motion Input
With motion input, sometimes called gesture recognition, users can guide on-screen elements 
using air gestures. Air gestures involve moving your body or a handheld input device through the 
air. With motion input, a device containing a camera detects your gesture and then converts it 
to a digital signal that is sent to a computer, mobile, or game device. For example, gamers can 
swing their arm or a controller to simulate rolling a bowling ball down a lane toward the pins.

Motion Input
Until a few years ago, the idea of controlling a 
computer by waving your hands was seen only in 
Hollywood science fiction movies. Today, the entertain-
ment industry (such as for gaming and animating mov-
ies), the military, athletics, and the medical field have 
found uses for motion input.
Motion-sensing devices communicate with a game 
console or a personal computer using wired or wireless 
technology. The console or computer translates a play-
er’s natural gestures, facial movements, and full-body 
motion into input. Although these devices originally 
were intended for gaming, developers are working on 
adapting them or using similar technology outside of 
the gaming and entertainment industries.
Entertainment
Motion-sensing game controllers enable a user to guide 
on-screen elements by moving a handheld input device 
through the air. Examples include handheld devices that 
enable gamers to use sweeping arm movements to simulate 
sports activities, such as a golf swing (shown in the figure 
below), balance boards that judge stability and motion when 
holding yoga poses, and remote control attachments, such 
as a steering wheel used to guide a car along a race course.
Some controllers track peripheral motion within a 
­specific area. With these devices, users can move their fin-
ger to draw or move their whole body to dance or exercise. 
Some use a device that can track small finger gestures, 
enabling users to be more precise in their movements.
Facial motion capture converts people’s facial 
­movements into a digital format while they talk, smile, 
and more. Animators, for example, use the digital data 
to simulate facial movements to create realistic gaming 
avatars, or computer-generated characters in movies. 
Facial movements, however, are more subtle and dif-
ficult to detect. Thus, the technology used for capturing 
facial motions requires more precision and a higher 
resolution than that required by gaming devices.
Military
Military uses of motion input include training, such as 
flight simulation or weapon usage. To ensure safety, train-
ees maneuver a helicopter or other device using motion 
input from a remote location. Motion input also aids in 
physical rehabilitation for wounded soldiers by providing 
a method for conducting physical therapy exercises out-
side of a military hospital. Another use of motion input is 
to assist in recovery from post-traumatic stress disorder. 
Sufferers of this ailment can use avatars and simulators 
to work through scenarios in a comfortable environment.
Athletics
Coaches and sports trainers use motion input to 
improve athletes’ performance and to correct inefficient or 
injury-causing motions. Analyzing the arc of a pitcher’s arm, 
and factoring the speed of the motion and the trajectory of 
the ball, can help improve a pitcher’s accuracy and speed. 
Combining the athlete’s motion input with complex algo-
rithms can pinpoint areas in which the athlete can improve.
Medical Field
The medical field also uses motion input for 
training. For example, surgeons can practice new 
technologies in a simulated environment. Using motion 
input that enhances movements, surgeons also can 
operate less invasively. Surgeons even 
operate remotely, enabling experts to 
manipulate surgical devices and share 
their expertise to save lives around 
the world. Sports medicine specialists 
use motion input to assess injuries, 
determine treatment, and assist in 
physical therapy.

Chapter 7  Input and Output
Voice and Audio Input
Voice input is the process of entering input by speaking into a microphone. The microphone 
may be built in the computer or device, in a headset, or an external peripheral device that sits on 
top of a desk or other surface. Some external microphones have a cable that attaches to a port 
on a computer; others communicate using wireless technology, such as Bluetooth.
Uses of voice input include Internet messaging that supports voice ­conversations, chat rooms 
that support voice chats, video calls, videoconferencing, VoIP, and voice recognition. Recall that 
VoIP enables users to speak to other users via their Internet connection. Voice ­recognition, also 
called speech recognition, is the computer or mobile device’s capability of distinguishing spoken 
words. Some computers and mobile devices make use of built-in and third-party voice recog-
nition applications, which have a natural language interface (Figure 7-12). A voice recognition 
­application allows users to dictate text and enter instructions by speaking into a microphone. 
On mobile devices, these applications allow users to speak simple, task-based instructions 
to the device, such as setting an alarm, entering a calendar appointment, or making a call. 
Some mobile devices have a speech-to-text feature, which recognizes a user’s spoken words and 
enters them into email messages, text ­messages, or other 
­applications that support typed text entry.
Discover More: To learn how voice recognition 
works, visit the free resources in Chapter 3 and read 
the ­High-Tech Talk article on this topic.
Audio Input  Voice input is part of a larger category of 
input called audio input. Audio input is the process of enter-
ing any sound into the computer, such as speech, music, 
and sound effects. To enter high-quality sound into com-
puter, the computer uses a sound card or integrated sound 
capability. Users enter sound into computers and mobile 
devices via devices such as microphones, CD/DVD/Blu-ray 
Disc players, or radios, each of which plugs in a port on the 
­computer or device.
Some users also record live music and other sound 
effects into a computer by connecting external music 
devices, such as an electronic keyboard (Figure 7-13), 
­guitar, drums, harmonica, and microphones, to a computer. 
Music production software allows users to record, com-
pose, mix, and edit music and sounds. For example, music 
production software enables you to change the speed, add 
notes, or rearrange the score to produce an entirely new arrangement.

Digital Video Technology
Everywhere you look, people are capturing videos using 
DV (digital video) cameras and mobile devices with 
built-in digital cameras. Using DV technology, you 
can input, edit, manage, publish, and share your videos. 
You can enhance digital videos by adding scrolling 
titles and transitions, cutting out or adding scenes, and 
adding background music and voice-over narration. 
The following sections outline the steps involved in the 
process of using DV technology.
Step 1: Select a DV Camera
DV cameras range from inexpensive consumer 
­versions to high-end DV camera models that support 
Blu-ray or HDV standards. Many mobile devices allow 
you to record digital video that you later can transmit 
to your computer or email from the device. When 
selecting a DV camera, consider features such as zoom, 
sound quality, editing capabilities, and resolution.
Step 2: Record a Video
With most DV cameras, you have a choice of 
recording programs that include different combinations 
of camera settings. These programs enable you to 
adjust the exposure and other functions to match the 
recording environment. You also have the ability to 
select special digital effects, such as fade, wipe, and 
black and white.
Step 3: Transfer and Manage Videos
You can connect most video cameras and mobile 
devices to a computer using a USB port. With many 
devices, you can transfer the videos to a media 
sharing or an online social network. Before doing 
this, however, consider the frame rate and video 
file format. The frame rate of a video refers to the 
number of frames per second (fps). A smaller frame 
rate results in a smaller file size for the video, but 
playback of the video will not be as smooth as one 
recorded with a higher frame rate. A video 
file format holds the video information in 
a manner specified by a vendor.
Step 4: Edit a Video
When editing, you first split 
the video into smaller pieces, or 
scenes, that you can manipulate 
easily. Most video editing software 
automatically splits the video 
into scenes at locations that you 
specify. After splitting, you should 
delete, or prune, unwanted scenes 
or portions of scenes. You can crop 
(or resize) scenes, and add logos, special 
effects, or titles. Special effects include warping, 
changing from color to black and white, morphing, or 
zoom motion. Morphing transforms one video image 
into another image over the course of several frames 
of video.
The next step is to add audio effects, including 
voice-over narration and background music. Using 
many video editing programs, you can add more 
tracks, or layers, of sound to a video in addition to 
the sound that the video camera or mobile device 
recorded. Adding audio tracks enables you to set 
a mood by providing background music or sounds. 
In the final step, you use video editing software to 
combine the scenes into a complete video by ordering 
scenes and adding transition effects. Transition effect 
options include fades, wipes, blurs, bursts, ruptures, and 
erosions.
Step 5: Distribute a Video
Some mobile devices allow you to upload video 
directly to video sharing and online social networks, as 
well as to send a video message. You can save digital 
video to media such as a DVD or Blu-ray Disc and 
package it for individual distribution or sale.

standards, special digital effects, transferring videos 
to a computer or online site, video file formats, video 
editing software, and adding logos.
  Consider This: If your computer or mobile device 
is capable of recording video, how often and for what 
purposes do you generally record videos? What settings 
can you adjust to improve the quality of the video? 
Which file format does your mobile device use to save 
video files?

Webcams and Integrated DV Cameras
A webcam is a type of DV camera that 
enables you to capture video and still images, 
and usually audio input, for viewing or manipu-

webcams are separate peripheral devices, which 
usually attach to the top of a desktop moni-
tor. Many laptops, tablets, and smartphones 
have built-in webcams. Smartphones and other 
mobile devices have built-in integrated DV cam-

Using a webcam or integrated DV camera, you 
can send email messages with video attachments, 
­broadcast live images or video over the Internet, 
conduct ­videoconferences, and make video calls. 
During a video call, all parties see one another as 
they communicate over the Internet (Figure 7-14).

Integrated DV Cameras
As mentioned, webcams and DV cameras 
are used to record and/or send live video 
to others. Before you can record and send 
video to others, you must have a webcam 
or integrated DV camera on your com-
puter or mobile device. Some computers 
and mobile devices have integrated DV 
cameras; others require you to set up a 
separate webcam. The following steps 
describe how to set up a webcam, and use 
a webcam or integrated DV camera:
Setting Up a Webcam
1.	 If the webcam included software, install 
the software on your computer before 
connecting the webcam.
2.	 Connect the webcam to your ­computer or 
mobile device either when the ­software 
prompts you or after you have installed 
the necessary software. If no software 
accompanied your webcam, connect the 
webcam to the computer or mobile device.
3.	 When the computer or mobile device 
acknowledges that a webcam has been 
connected, you are ready to begin using it.
Using a Webcam or Integrated  
DV Camera
1.	 Run the app that will use the webcam or 
integrated DV camera.
2.	 Display the app’s settings and make  
sure the app recognizes the webcam or 
integrated DV camera.
3.	 If you are using the camera to record a 
video, record a short clip and then replay 
it to make sure the camera properly cap-
tured audio and video. If you are using 
the camera for a videoconference, place 
a call to somebody using the videocon-
ferencing app and make sure he or she is 
able to see and hear you.
4.	 If you experience problems with the 
camera capturing audio or video, try the 
­following:
	
a.	 Run the program that came with the 
camera and see if a troubleshooter 
can identify and correct the problem 
you are experiencing.
	
b.	 If you are using a webcam, ­disconnect 
the webcam from the computer, 
restart the computer or mobile device, 
and then reconnect the webcam.
	
c.	 If you are using a webcam, disconnect 
the webcam, uninstall the program(s) 
included with the webcam, restart the 
computer or mobile device, and then 
follow the previous steps to set up 
and use the webcam.
	
d.	 If you continue experiencing problems 
after attempting these steps, contact 
the technical support team for the 
camera’s manufacturer.

You can configure some webcams to display the images they capture remotely on a webpage, 
or via an app on a mobile device. This use of a webcam attracts website visitors by showing 
images that change regularly. Home or small business users might use webcams to show a 
work in progress, weather and traffic information, or employees at work; they also might use 
it as a security system. Some websites have live webcams that display still pictures and update 
the displayed image at a specified time or time intervals, such as every 15 seconds. A streaming 
cam has the illusion of moving images because it sends a continual stream of still images. Read 
Secure IT 7-2 to learn about security issues related to using webcams.

What is the purpose of a videoconference 
versus a video call?
Where video calls usually are for personal use, 
videoconferences typically are for business use. 
A videoconference is a meeting between two 
or more geographically separated people who 
use a network or the Internet to transmit audio 
and video data (Figure 7-15). To participate 
in a videoconference using a computer, you 
need videoconferencing software or access 
to a videoconferencing web app, along with 
a microphone, speakers, and a video camera 
attached to or built into a computer. As you 
speak, members of the meeting hear your voice 
on their speakers. Any image in front of the video 
camera, such as a person’s face, appears in a 
window on each participant’s screen.

Digital Video Security
Sales of home security systems are on the 
rise due to their low costs and easy setup. 
These systems use cameras and sensors 
to monitor activity, and most send a mes-
sage via mobile phone to alert a user of 
­movement and entrance or exit into the 
dwelling and send the webcam’s live feed  
of the scene.
This use of webcams serves a practical use 
in a private setting. Similarly, webcams in public 
areas, such as shopping malls, parking lots, 
and school cafeterias, help with surveillance 
measures and record everyday activity.
Webcam use, however, is criticized when 
the live feeds are used in a manner without 
the recorded parties’ consent. Ethics and 
Issues 3-1 in Chapter 3 discusses the 
appropriate punishment for webcam spying, 
citing examples of criminals who hacked into 
home computers and streamed live video 
feeds, school administrators who took 66,000 
pictures and screen captures of students 
using ­school-distributed laptops at home, and 
rent-to-own stores that rented laptops with 
spyware that captured photos of customers 
in their homes. Digital video recorders also 
are hidden in products resembling remote car 
keys, wall and desk clocks, sunglasses, smoke 
detectors, and electrical boxes.
If you have a webcam, follow these 
measures to prevent its unauthorized use:
• Unplug the webcam. This obvious ­ 
suggestion offers the most secure 
­solution. If the webcam is not connected 
to the ­computer, it cannot reveal what is 
­occurring in front of the lens.
• Cover the lens and plug the 
­microphone. Place a piece of black 
electrical tape over the lens, and insert a 
dummy plug in the microphone port. This 
solution is ideal for tablets and laptops 
equipped with cameras.
• Register the hardware. Hardware 
­manufacturers continually update their firm-
ware to fix issues. If you register your product, 
the companies can notify you of known 
security holes and offer updates to download.
• Use a strong password. When 
­connecting a webcam to a network, you 
may need to configure the device for 
features such as sending an email or text 
message when motion is detected. If you 
are prompted to create a password, be 
certain it can resist hackers and malicious 
software. Read Secure IT 1-3 in Chapter 1 
for tips about creating strong passwords.
  Consider This: If you have a webcam, 
what actions will you take to protect your 
privacy? Should you be warned of webcam 
use when you are in a public area? If so, how 
can these warnings be given? Would you 
consider buying a digital video recorder for 
­surveillance purposes?

Chapter 7  Input and Output
Scanners and Reading Devices
Some input devices save users time by capturing data directly from a source document, which is 
the original form of the data. Examples of source documents include time cards, order forms, 
invoices, paychecks, advertisements, brochures, photos, inventory tags, or any other document 
that contains data to be processed.
Devices that can capture data directly from a source document include optical scanners, 
­optical readers, bar code readers, RFID (radio frequency identification) readers, magnetic stripe 
card readers, and MICR (magnetic-ink character recognition) readers.
Optical Scanners
An optical scanner, usually called a scanner, is a light-sensing input device that reads printed 
text and graphics and then translates the results into a form the computer can process. A flatbed 
scanner works in a manner similar to a copy machine except it creates a file of the document in 
memory instead of a paper copy (Figure 7-16). Once you scan a picture or document, you can 
display the scanned object on the screen, modify its appearance, store it on a storage medium, 
print it, attach it to an email message, include it in another document, or post it on a website or 
photo community for everyone to see.
The quality of a scanner is measured by its resolution, that is, the number of bits it stores in a 
pixel and the number of pixels per inch. The higher each number, the better the quality, but the 
more expensive the scanner.
Many scanners include OCR (optical character recognition) software, which can read and 
­convert text documents into electronic files. OCR software converts a scanned image into a text 
file that can be edited, for example, with a word processing application.
Figure 7-16  This figure shows how a flatbed scanner works.

Step 1
Place the document to be scanned face down on
the glass window. Using buttons on the scanner
or the scanner program, start the scanning process.
Step 2 
The scanner converts the document content to 
digital information, which is transmitted through
the cable to the computer’s memory and saved
on the computer’s hard drive.
Step 3
Once in the computer, users can display the image, print it,
send it in an email message, include it in a document,
or place it on a webpage.

How can you improve the quality of scanned documents?
Place a blank sheet of paper behind translucent papers, newspapers, and other transparent types of paper. If the 
original is crooked, draw a line on the back at the bottom of the image. Use that mark to align the original on the 
scanner. Use photo editing software to fix imperfections in images.

Optical Readers
An optical reader is a device that uses a light source to read characters, marks, and codes and 
then converts them into digital data that a computer can process. Two technologies used by 
optical readers are optical character recognition (OCR) and optical mark recognition (OMR).
• Most OCR devices include a small optical scanner for reading characters and sophisticated 
software to analyze what is read. OCR devices range from large machines that can read 
thousands of documents per minute to handheld wands that read one document at a time. 
OCR devices read printed characters in a special font.
• OMR devices read hand-drawn marks, such as small circles or rectangles. A person places 
these marks on a form, such as a test, survey, or questionnaire answer sheet (shown in 
Figure 7-1 at the beginning of this chapter).
Bar Code Readers
A bar code reader, also called a bar 
code scanner, is an optical reader that 
uses laser beams to read bar codes 
(Figure 7-17). A bar code is an identifi-
cation code that consists of either a set 
of vertical lines and spaces of differ­ent 
widths or a two-dimensional ­pattern of 
dots, squares, and other images. The 
bar code represents data that iden­tifies 
the manufacturer and the item.
Manufacturers print a bar code 
either on a product’s package or on a 
label that is affixed to a product, such 
as groceries, books, clothing, vehicles, 
mail, and packages. Each industry uses 
its own type of bar code. The United 
States Postal Service (USPS) uses 
a POSTNET bar code. Retail and 
grocery stores use the UPC (Universal 
Product Code) bar code.
A QR code (quick response code) is known as a 2-D bar code because it stores information in 
both a vertical and horizontal direction (Figure 7-18). The information it stores can correspond to 
a web address or other content, such as 
contacts or phone numbers. QR codes 
can be read with a QR bar code reader 
or a QR code reader app on a smart-
phone or other mobile device. All types 
of material, from posters to textbooks 
to merchandise, include QR codes that 
consumers scan to obtain additional 
information, which may be in the form 
of a website or may display text for the 
user to read. For information about safely 
scanning QR codes, read Secure IT 7-3.

RFID Readers
RFID (radio frequency identification) is a technology that uses radio signals to 
­communicate with a tag placed in or attached to an object, an animal, or a person. RFID 
tags, which contain a memory chip and an 
antenna, are available in many shapes and sizes. 
An RFID reader reads information on the tag 
via radio waves. RFID readers can be handheld 
devices or mounted in a stationary object, such as 
a doorway.
Many retailers see RFID as an alternative to bar 
code identification because it does not require direct 
contact or line-of-site transmission. Each product 
in a store would contain a tag that identifies the 
product. As consumers remove products from the 
store shelves and walk through a checkout area, an 
RFID reader reads the tag(s) and communicates 
with a computer that calculates the amount due and 
updates inventory.
Other uses of RFID include tracking times of 
runners in a marathon; tracking location of people, 
airline baggage, and misplaced or stolen goods; 
checking lift tickets of skiers; managing inven-
tory; gauging temperature and pressure of tires on 
a vehicle; checking out library books; providing 
access to rooms or buildings (Figure 7-19); manag-
ing purchases; and tracking payment as vehicles pass 
through booths on tollway systems.
Secure IT 7-3
Safely Scanning QR Codes
QR codes have come a long way since their 
first use, which was in tracking parts used 
to manufacture Japanese cars. Now they are 
used to market, educate, and entertain. Every 
industry has found some benefit of using 
­innovative and creative QR technology to ben-
efit workers and the public. They have become 
a necessary method of providing additional 
information about exhibits, downloading 
apps, displaying videos, advertising items, and 
performing thousands of other functions.
As with most computer applications, 
however, users must be cautious by 
scrutinizing the QR codes they see, in an 
attempt to thwart malicious attacks. Follow 
these guidelines to use QR codes safely:
• Scan trustworthy sources. In ­general, 
QR codes in books, magazines, and 
newspapers are safe. Posters on the street 
or on leaflets handed out on street corners, 
however, may not be as secure. Verify the 
source of the codes before scanning them.
• Verify the web address. Most QR 
code reader apps show the address of the 
­website that will be displayed. If you do 
not recognize the domain name or the 
web address looks suspicious, do not grant 
permission.
• Choose a reputable QR scanner. Visit 
trustworthy Android marketplaces and 
the iTunes Store for safe QR apps. Look 
for safety features that will check the 
authenticity of destination websites, issue 
warnings for malicious QR codes, display 
a preview of each code, and block unsafe 
websites.
• Do not supply personal information. 
If the QR code directs you to a website 
­displaying a form, do not enter personal 
or financial data unless you are certain 
that the website is safe, secure, and 
authentic.
• Check for tampering. Verify the QR  
code is original. Unscrupulous people 
may place a fraudulent sticker over the 
printed code. 
  Consider This: Where have you seen 
QR codes? Have you scanned any? If so, 
what information have you obtained? Have 
you followed any of the security precautions 
listed above? If not, which will you now 
­follow?

Magstripe Readers
A magstripe reader, short for magnetic stripe card reader, reads the magnetic stripe on the 
back of credit cards, entertainment cards, bank cards, identification cards, and other similar cards 
(Figure 7-20). The stripe contains information identifying you and the card issuer. Some infor-
mation stored in the stripe may include your name, account number, the card’s expiration date, 
and a country code.
Most magstripe readers are separate devices that communicate with a POS (point-of-sale) 
terminal, such as those in retail stores. Home or small business users, however, may attach a 
small plastic magstripe reader to a smartphone or tablet so that they can accept payments using 
a mobile app. When a credit card is swiped through a magstripe reader, it reads the information 
stored on the magnetic stripe on the card. Read Secure IT 7-4 for tips about how to protect 
credit cards from scanning devices.
Secure IT 7-4
Protecting Credit Cards from 
Scanning Devices
One-third of the 775 million credit and debit 
cards issued in the United States are likely 
targets for high-tech thieves who can steal 
the account information quickly and silently. 
RFID technology embedded in these cards 
transmits signals with the coded account 
information to scanners, which thieves place 
in their coat pockets, purses, and other 
nonmetallic containers. Some signals have a 
range as far as 30 feet, so that the electronic 
pickpockets simply walk among crowds in 
search of obtaining these radio waves.
The RFID technology embedded in the credit 
cards is approximately the size of a postage 
stamp. It consists of a coil of wire connected to 
an electronic circuit that generates a pattern of 
electrical pulses with coded account information 
unique to a specific card. An antenna transmits 
these radio waves to a scanner.
The radio waves do not penetrate metal or 
water easily. You, consequently, can protect 
these cards and documents by wrapping them 
in aluminum foil or placing them near water 
bottles. Security experts also recommend 
stacking several credit cards in an attempt to 
scramble the signals. Place the cards in your 
wallet with the magnetic strip facing inside. 
RFID-blocking wallets also are manufactured 
to prevent scanners from obtaining the 
emitted signals.
To determine if your credit or debit card 
has this RFID technology, look for the words, 
PayPass, PayWave, Blink, or a radio wave 
symbol, as shown in the figure. If you do not 
see this information, call customer service or 
search the company’s website. This technology 
also is found in passports, driver’s licenses, 
hotel room keys, and university and employee 
identification cards, so you may need to 
protect these documents and cards from 
electronic pickpockets, too.

MICR Readers
MICR (magnetic-ink character ­recognition) devices 
read text printed with magnetized ink. An MICR reader 
converts MICR characters into a form the computer can 
­process. The banking industry almost exclusively uses 
MICR for check processing. Each check in your check-
book has precoded MICR characters beginning at the 
lower-left edge (Figure 7-21).
When a bank receives a check for payment, it uses 
an MICR inscriber to print the amount of the check in 
MICR characters in the lower-right corner. Each check 
is inserted in an MICR reader, which sends the check 
information — including the amount of the check — to a 
computer for processing.
Data Collection Devices
Instead of reading or scanning data from a source ­document, a data collection device 
obtains data directly at the location where the transaction or event takes place. For 
example, employees use bar code readers, handheld computers, or other mobile 
devices to collect data wirelessly (Figure 7-22). These types of data collection 
devices are used in restaurants, grocery stores, factories, warehouses, the outdoors, 
or other locations where heat, humidity, and cleanliness are not easy to control. For 
example, factories and retail stores use data collection devices to take inventory and 
order products.
Data collection devices and many mobile computers and devices have the 
­capability of wirelessly transmitting data over a network or the Internet. 
Increasingly more users today send data wirelessly to central office computers 
using these devices.
Consider This
Why are some magnetic stripes not readable by a magstripe reader?
If the magstripe reader rejects the card, it is possible that the magnetic stripe is scratched, dirty, or erased. 
Exposure to a magnet or magnetic field can erase the contents of a card’s magnetic stripe.

What Is Output?
Output is data that has been processed into a useful form. Recall that computers process data (input) 
into information (output). The form of output varies, depending on the hardware and software being 
used and the requirements of the user. Users view or watch output on a screen, print it, or hear it 
through speakers, headphones, or earbuds. While working with a computer or mobile device, a user 
encounters four basic types of output: text, graphics, audio, and video (Figure 7-23). Very often, a 
single form of output, such as a webpage, includes more than one of these types of output.

• Text: Examples of output that primarily contain text are text messages, Internet messages, 
memos, letters, press releases, reports, classified advertisements, envelopes, and mailing labels. 
On the web, users read blogs, news and magazine articles, books, television show transcripts, 
stock quotes, speeches, and lectures.
• Graphics: Many forms of output include graphics to enhance visual appeal and convey information. 
Business letters have logos. Reports include charts. Newsletters use drawings, clip art, and photos. 
Users print high-quality photos taken with a digital camera. Many websites use animation.
• Audio: Users download their favorite songs and listen to the music. Software, such as games, 
encyclopedias, and simulations, often include musical accompaniments and audio clips, such 
as narrations and speeches. On the web, users listen to radio broadcasts, audio clips, podcasts, 
sporting events, news, music, and concerts. They also use VoIP.
• Video: As with audio, software and websites often include video clips and video blogs. Users 
watch news reports, movies, sporting events, weather conditions, and live performances on a 
computer or mobile device. They attach a video camera to a computer or mobile device to 
watch video or programs.

Are storage devices categorized as input or output devices?
When storage devices write on storage media, they are creating output. Similarly, when storage devices read from 
storage media, they function as a source of input. Nevertheless, they are categorized as storage devices, not as 
input or output devices.
	
Common methods of output include displays, printers, speakers, headphones and earbuds, data 
projectors, interactive whiteboards, and force-feedback game controllers and tactile output. The 
following sections discuss each of these output devices.
Displays
A display device, or simply display, is an output device that visually conveys text, graphics, and video 
information. Sometimes called soft copy, information on a display exists electronically and appears 
for a temporary period. Displays 
consist of a screen and the 
components that produce the 
information on the screen. Most 
current displays are a type of 
flat-panel display, which means 
they have a shallow depth 
and a flat screen. Figure 7-24 
shows displays for a variety of 
­computers and mobile devices.
Desktops often use a 
­monitor as their display. A 
monitor is a display that is 
packaged as a separate periph-
eral device. Some monitors 
have a tilt-and-swivel base, 
which allows you to adjust the 
angle of the screen to mini-
mize neck strain and reduce 
glare from overhead light-
ing. With some, you also can 
rotate the screen. Adjustable 
monitor stands allow you to

built-in webcam. Today’s monitors have a small footprint; that is, they do not take up much desk 
space. For additional space savings, some monitors are wall mountable.
Most mobile computers and devices integrate the display and other components into the case. 
Size of these displays varies depending on the mobile computer or device. Some mobile comput-
ers and many mobile devices have touch screens. Traditional laptops have a display that attaches 
with a hinge to the case. (Read How To 7-2 to learn how to connect a laptop to an external dis-
play.) Tablets are available with two types of displays: one that attaches with a hinge and one built 
into the top of the case. Some smartphone and digital camera displays also attach with a hinge to 
the device. On other smartphones and most portable media players, digital cameras, and hand-
held game consoles, the display is built into the case. Newer vehicles integrate a display in the 
dashboard, enabling drivers to control audio, video, navigation, temperature, and other settings.

Measuring Displays
You measure the screen 
on a monitor, laptop, 
tablet, smartphone, or 
other mobile device the 
same way you measure 
a television; that is, you 
measure diagonally from 
one corner to the other.
Connect a Laptop to an 
External Display
When you are using a laptop, you may 
need to connect it to an external display 
for a variety of reasons. If you are giving 
a presentation, connecting a laptop to a 
projector or television will allow attendees 
to view presentation slides or other media 
content. If you use your laptop at a desk, 
you might want to connect it to a larger 
display so that you can more easily see the 
content without straining your eyes, or you 
may want to work with two open programs 
simultaneously with one displaying on the 
laptop screen and the other on the external 
display. The following steps describe how 
to connect a laptop to an external display.
1.	 Verify that your laptop is compatible with 
the external display.
2.	 Make sure that you have a cable that can 
connect from a port on your laptop to a 
port or cable connected to the external 
display. If not, you may need to purchase 
an adapter.
3.	 Verify that your laptop supports a screen 
resolution that the external display also 
supports.
4.	 Use the cable to connect your laptop’s 
video port to the video input port for the 
external display.
5.	 External displays often have multiple video 
input ports; make sure the external ­display 
is configured to display the ­content 
from the port to which your laptop is 
­connected.
6.	 If necessary, configure the laptop to 
­display content on the external display. 
This often can be done by pressing a 
key on the keyboard or accessing the 
operating system’s display settings.
7.	 If necessary, change the screen resolution 
on the laptop so that the contents display 
properly on the external display.

Display Technologies
Many desktop monitors, along with the screens on mobile computers and devices, use some 
type of LCD technology. A liquid crystal display (LCD) sandwiches a liquid compound between 
two sheets of material that presents sharp, flicker-free images on a screen when illuminated. 
The light source, called the backlight, often uses either CCFL (cold cathode fluorescent lamp) or 
LED (light-emitting diode) technology.

Chapter 7  Input and Output
A display that uses LED for the backlight often is called an LED display or an LED LCD 
­display. LED displays consume less power, last longer, and are thinner, lighter, and brighter than 
a display that uses CCFL technology, but they also may be more expensive. Screens in laptops 
and mobile devices often use LED backlight technology.
LCD displays typically produce color using active-matrix, or TFT (thin-film transistor), 
­technology, which uses a separate transistor to apply charges to each liquid crystal cell and, 
thus, displays high-quality color that is viewable from all angles. Several types of active matrix 
­displays, or panels, are available, with some providing higher quality than others.
Instead of LCD or traditional LED, some displays use OLED technology. OLED (organic 
LED) uses organic molecules that are self-illuminating and, thus, do not require a backlight. 
OLED displays consume less power and produce an even brighter, easier-to-read display than 
LCD or LED displays, but they can have a shorter life span. OLEDs also can be fabricated on 
thin, flexible surfaces.
Many mobile computers and devices use either AMOLED or Retina Display technology. 
An AMOLED (active-matrix OLED) screen uses both active-matrix and OLED technologies, 
combining the benefits of high-quality viewing from all angles with lower power consumption. 
Variations of AMOLED provide different levels of viewing quality. Retina Display, developed by 
Apple, produces vibrant colors and supports viewing from all angles because the LCD technol-
ogy is built into the screen instead of behind it and contains more pixels per inch of display. 
Recall that a pixel (short for picture element) is a single point in an electronic image.

Display Quality
The quality of a display depends primarily on its resolution, response time, brightness, dot 
pitch, and contrast ratio.
• Resolution is the number of horizontal and vertical pixels in a display. For example, a monitor 
or screen that has a 1600 3 900 resolution displays up to 1600 pixels per horizontal row and 
900 pixels per vertical row, for a total of 1,440,000 pixels to create a screen image. A higher 
resolution uses a greater number of pixels and, thus, provides a smoother, sharper, and clearer 
image. As the resolution increases, however, some items on the screen appear smaller.
Displays are optimized for a specific resolution, called the native resolution. Although you 
can change the resolution to any setting, for best results, use the monitor or screen’s native 
­resolution setting.
• Response time of a display refers to the time in milliseconds (ms) that it takes to turn a pixel on 
or off. Response times of displays range from 2 to 16 ms. The lower the number, the faster the 
response time.
• Brightness of a display is measured in nits. A nit is a unit of visible light intensity equal to 
one candela (formerly called candlepower) per square meter. The candela is the standard unit 
of luminous intensity. Displays today range from 250 to 550 nits. The higher the nits, the 
brighter the images.
• Dot pitch, sometimes called pixel pitch, is the distance in millimeters between pixels on a 
display. Text created with a smaller dot pitch is easier to read. Advertisements normally specify 
a display’s dot pitch or pixel pitch. Average dot pitch on a display should be .30 mm or lower. 
The lower the number, the sharper the image.
• Contrast ratio describes the difference in light intensity between the brightest white and 
darkest black that can be produced on a display. Contrast ratios today range from 500:1 to 
2000:1. Higher contrast ratios represent colors better.
Graphics Chips, Ports, and Flat-Panel Monitors  A cable on a monitor plugs in a port on the 
computer, which enables communications from a graphics chip. This chip, called the graphics 
processing unit (GPU), controls the manipulation and display of graphics on a display device. 
The GPU either is integrated on the motherboard or resides on a video card in a slot on the 
motherboard.

Today’s monitors use a digital signal to produce a picture. To display the highest quality 
images, the monitor should plug in a DVI port, an HDMI port, or a DisplayPort.
• A DVI (Digital Video Interface) port enables digital signals to transmit directly to a monitor.
• An HDMI (High-Definition Media Interface) port combines DVI with high-definition (HD) 
television, audio, and video. Some ultrathin laptops have mini-HDMI ports that require the 
use of an adapter (or dongle) when connecting to a standard-size HDMI display.
• A DisplayPort is an alternative to DVI that also supports high-definition audio and video.
Over the years, several video standards have been developed to define the resolution, aspect 
ratio, number of colors, and other display properties. The aspect ratio defines a display’s width 
relative to its height. A 2:1 aspect ratio, for example, means the display is twice as wide as it is 
tall. The aspect ratio for a widescreen monitor is 16:9 or 16:10. Some displays support multiple 
video standards. For a display to show images as defined by a video standard, both the display 
and GPU must support the same video standard.

DTVs and Smart TVs
Home users sometimes use a digital television (DTV) as a display. 
Gamers also use a television as their output device. They plug one end 
of a cable in the game console and the other end in the video port on 
the television.
HDTV (high-definition television) is the most advanced form of digital 
television, working with digital broadcast signals, transmitting digital 
sound, supporting wide screens, and providing high resolutions. A Smart 
TV is an Internet-enabled HDTV from which you can browse the 
web, stream video from online media services, listen to Internet radio, 
communicate with others on online social media, play online games, 
and more — all while watching a television show (Figure 7-25). Using 
a SmartTV, you can stream content from the TV to other Internet-
enabled devices, such as a tablet or smartphone, and use cloud storage 
services to share content. Read How To 7-3 to learn how to show media 
on a Smart TV from your computer or device.

Show Media on a Smart TV from Your 
Computer or Device
Smart TVs can connect to the network in 
your home using a wired or wireless con-
nection. Compatible computers and devices 
connected to the same network can display 
content on the Smart TV. For example if 
you connect your smartphone to the same 
network as the Smart TV, you can display 
pictures from the phone on the Smart TV. 
The following steps describe how to show 
media on a Smart TV from a computer or 
device.
1.	 Verify that your computer or device is 
capable of displaying content on the 
Smart TV.
2.	 Make sure that the computer or device 
is connected to the same network as the 
Smart TV.
3.	 Navigate to the settings on the computer 
or device and specify that you want to 
mirror the display on the Smart TV.
4.	 Navigate to the settings on the Smart 
TV, if necessary, and enable the setting 
that allows content from computers and 
devices to be displayed.
5.	 Continue to use the computer or 
device when the video from your 
­computer or device is displayed on 
the Smart TV.
6.	 When you no longer wish to display the 
content from your computer or device on 
the Smart TV, change the setting on your 
computer or mobile device to disable this 
feature.

Chapter 7  Input and Output
DTVs often use LCD, LED, or plasma technology. A plasma display uses gas plasma 
­technology, which sandwiches a layer of gas between two glass plates. When voltage is applied, 
the gas releases ultraviolet (UV) light. This UV light causes the pixels on the screen to glow and 
form an image. Read Ethics & Issues 7-3 to consider the effects of radiation from monitors and 
other devices.
Ethics& Issues 7-3
Should We Be Concerned with 
Hardware Radiation?
When you work on a computer or talk on 
a mobile phone, could you be at risk from 
harmful radiation? Every electronic device 
emits some level of radiation. While the 
amounts for computers and mobile devices 
may not be harmful in low doses, some 
critics argue that constant exposure, such 
as sitting in an office all day or wearing 
a Bluetooth headset for several hours at 
a time, can cause levels of radiation that, 
over time, may cause cancer or other health 
concerns. In addition to the computer 
itself, peripheral devices, such as printers, 
along with the wireless or cordless meth-
ods to connect the devices, emit radiation. 
Research is inconclusive about safe levels 
and long-term risks. Most agree that it is 
not the level from any one device, but rather 
the cumulative effect from long-term expo-
sure (several hours a day over many years) 
to multiple devices simultaneously that 
causes harm.
You can protect yourself and minimize 
your risks. Replace older equipment, such 
as CRT (cathode-ray tube) monitors, with 
devices such as LCD monitors, which meet 
current emission standards. Sit back from 
your monitor as far as possible, and place a 
barrier between your computer and your lap. 
Move other electronic sources, such as hard 
drives and printers, as far away as possible. 
Minimize your wireless connections, such 
as a wireless keyboard or a wireless mouse. 
Remove your Bluetooth headset when not in 
use, and frequently switch the headset from 
one ear to the other. Turn off devices when 
not in use. Recycle or donate older, unused 
devices to eliminate any radiation exposure 
from older devices, even when they are 
not in use.
Consider This: Do you consider ­computers 
and mobile devices to be ­harmful to 
your health? Why or why not? Would 
you change your electronic device usage, 
change your habits, or rearrange your 
­computer work area to minimize your risk? 
Why or why not? What modifications can 
you make?

Printers
A printer is an output device that produces text and graphics on a physical medium, such as 
paper. Printed information (hard copy) exists physically and is a more permanent form of output 
than that presented on a display (soft copy).
A hard copy, also called a printout, is either in portrait or landscape orientation. A printout 
in portrait orientation is taller than it is wide, with information printed across the shorter width 
of the paper. A printout in landscape orientation is wider than it is tall, with information printed 
across the widest part of the paper. Letters, reports, and books typically use portrait orientation. 
Spreadsheets, slide shows, and graphics often use landscape orientation.

To meet the range of printing needs from 
home users to enterprise users, many different 
types and styles of printers exist with vary-
ing speeds, capabilities, and printing methods. 
Figure 7-26 presents a list of questions to help 
you determine the printer best suited to your 
needs.
Nonimpact Printers
A nonimpact printer forms characters and 
graphics on a piece of paper without actually 
­contacting the paper. Some spray ink, while 
­others use heat or pressure to create images.
Commonly used nonimpact printers are 
­ink-jet printers, photo printers, laser print-
ers, all-in-one printers, thermal printers, 
mobile printers, label printers, plotters, and 
­large-­format printers.
Ink-Jet Printers
An ink-jet printer is a type of nonimpact 
printer that forms characters and graphics  
by ­spraying tiny drops of liquid ink onto a  
piece of paper. Ink-jet printers have become  
a popular type of color printer for use in  
the home.
Ink-jet printers produce text and graphics in both 
black-and-white and color on a variety of paper types 
and sizes (Figure 7-27). These printers normally 
use individual sheets of paper stored in one or two 
removable or stationary trays. Most ink-jet print-
ers can print lab-quality photos. Ink-jet printers also 
print on other materials, such as envelopes, labels, 
index cards, greeting card paper (card stock), trans-
parencies, and iron-on T-shirt transfers. Many ink-jet 
printers include software for creating greeting cards, 
banners, business cards, and ­letterhead.
The speed of an ink-jet printer is measured by the 
number of pages per minute (ppm) it can print. Graphics 
and colors print at a slower rate than text.

learn more about ink-jet printers.
Consider This
Can you print documents and photos from a mobile computer and device without physically 
connecting to the printer with a cable?
Yes. Many printers contain memory card slots, so that you can remove the memory card from a camera, insert it in 
the printer, and print photos directly from the card. You also can connect a printer to a wireless network so that 
devices with a Wi-Fi connection can print wirelessly. With Bluetooth printing, a computer or other device transmits 
output to a printer via radio waves. The computer or other device and the printer do not have to be aligned with 
each other; rather, they need to be within an approximate 30-foot range.

Chapter 7  Input and Output
Ink Cartridges  The printhead mechanism in an ink-jet printer contains ink-filled cartridges. 
Each cartridge has fifty to several hundred small ink holes, or nozzles. The steps in Figure 7-28 
illustrate how a drop of ink appears on a page. The ink propels through any combination of the 
nozzles to form a character or image on the paper.
When the cartridge runs out of ink, you simply replace the cartridge. Most ink-jet printers use 
two or more ink cartridges, one containing black ink and the other(s) containing colors. Some 
color cartridges contain a variety of ink colors; others contain only a single color. Consider the 
number of ink cartridges a printer requires, along with the cost of the cartridges, when purchas-
ing a printer. To reduce the expense of purchasing cartridges, some users opt to purchase refilled 
cartridges or have empty cartridges refilled by a third-party vendor.
Consider This
How does resolution affect print quality?
As with many other input and output devices, one factor that determines the quality of an ink-jet printer is its 
resolution. Printer resolution is measured by the number of dots per inch (dpi ) a printer can print. With an ink-jet 
printer, a dot is a drop of ink. A higher dpi means the print quality is higher because the drops of ink are smaller 
and more drops fit in an area.
The difference in quality becomes noticeable when the size of the printed image increases. That is, a wallet-sized 
image printed at 1200 dpi may look similar in quality to one printed at 2400 dpi. When you increase the size of 
the image, to 8 3 10 for example, the printout of the 1200 dpi resolution may look grainier than the one printed 
using a 2400 dpi resolution.

Photo Printers
A photo printer is a color printer that produces 
lab-quality photos (Figure 7-29). Some photo print-
ers print just one or two sizes of photos, for exam-
ple, 3 3 5 inches and 4 3 6 inches. Others print 
up to 8 3 10 or even larger. Some even print pan-
oramic photos. Generally, the more sizes the printer 
prints, the more expensive the printer.
Many photo printers use ink-jet technology. With 
models that can print letter-sized documents, users 
connect the photo printer to their computer and 
use it for all their printing needs. For a few hundred 
dollars, this type of photo printer is ideal for the 
home or small business user.
Most photo printers are PictBridge enabled, 
so that you can print photos without a computer. 
PictBridge is a standard technology that allows you 
to print photos directly from a digital camera by 
connecting a cable from the digital camera to a USB 
port on the printer. Photo printers also usually have a built-in card slot(s) so that the printer 
can print digital photos directly from a memory card. Read How To 7-4 for instructions about 
­printing from a smartphone or tablet.
Discover More: Visit this chapter’s free resources to learn more about photo printers.
Print from a Smartphone or Tablet
As smartphones and tablets become more 
widely used and packed with features, you 
may need to print items stored on these 
devices. For example, you may capture a 
great photo while spending time with your 
family and want to print the photo to place 
on your desk, or you may take notes on 
your tablet and want to print a hard copy. 
You have several options available to print 
from a smartphone or tablet. The method 
you use will depend primarily on the type 
of mobile device and printer you are using, 
and the printer must support printing 
from a mobile device. The following steps 
describe how to print from a smartphone 
or tablet:
1.	 Verify your mobile device or tablet is 
­connected to the same network as the 
printer.
2.	 If necessary, download and install an app 
on your device or tablet to enable you 
to print. The printer’s documentation will 
inform you if you need an app and, if so, 
where to obtain it.
3.	 When you are viewing the item that you 
want to print on your smartphone or 
tablet, select the option to print on your 
printer and then retrieve the printout.
In addition to using an app or built-in 
­features on your mobile device or computer 
to print, you may be able to configure your 
printer so that you can attach files and 
send them to a specified email address. The 
following steps describe how to use this 
feature on supported printers:
1.	 Access your printer’s settings and make sure 
the printer is connected to your ­network.
2.	 Configure the option to set up an email 
address for receiving print jobs and write 
down that email address.
3.	 On your computer or mobile device, send 
the file you want to print as an attach-
ment to an email message addressed to 
the email address determined in Step 2.
4.	 When the printer receives the email ­message 
with the file attachment, it will print the file.
If your mobile device or printer does not 
support wireless printing, you also can print 
by transferring the file from your ­smartphone 
or tablet to your laptop, ­desktop, or printer. 
The following steps describe how to print 
from a smartphone or tablet when wireless 
printing is not ­supported:
1.	 Remove the memory card from your 
smartphone or tablet and insert it into 
your laptop, desktop, or printer. Note: 
If your smartphone or tablet does not 
have a removable memory card, you can 
­connect the smartphone or tablet to a 
desktop, laptop, or printer using the USB 
cable included with your device.
2.	 On the laptop, desktop, or printer, 
­navigate to and select the file you want to 
print, and then select the option to print 
the file.
3.	 When the printer stops, safely remove the 
memory card from the laptop, desktop, or 
printer and insert it in your smartphone or 
tablet.

Laser Printers
A laser printer is a high-speed, high-quality 
­nonimpact printer (Figure 7-30). Laser printers are 
available in both black-and-white and color models. 
A laser printer for personal computers ordinarily uses 
individual 8 1/2 3 11-inch sheets of paper stored in one 
or more removable trays that slide in the printer case.
Laser printers print text and graphics in ­high-quality 
resolutions. While laser printers usually cost more than 
ink-jet printers, many models are available at afford-
able prices for the home user. Laser printers ­usually 
print at faster speeds than ink-jet printers.
Depending on the quality, speed, and type of laser 
printer, the cost ranges from a few hundred to a few 
thousand dollars for the home and small office user, and 
several hundred thousand dollars for the enterprise user.
When printing a document, laser printers process 
and store the entire page before they actually print 
it. For this reason, laser printers sometimes are called 
page printers. Storing a page before printing requires 
that the laser printer has a certain amount of memory 
in the device. The more memory in the printer, the 
faster it usually can print.
Operating in a manner similar to a copy machine, 
a laser printer creates images using a laser beam and powdered ink, called toner. The laser 
beam produces an image on a drum inside the printer. The light of the laser alters the electri-
cal charge on the drum wherever it hits. When this occurs, the toner sticks to the drum and 
then transfers to the paper through a combination of pressure and heat (Figure 7-31). When 
the toner runs out, you replace the toner cartridge.

All-in-One Printers
An all-in-one printer, also called a ­multifunction 
printer (MFP), is a single device that looks like 
a printer or a copy machine but provides the 
­functionality of a printer, scanner, copy machine, and 
perhaps a fax machine (Figure 7-32). Some use color 
ink-jet printer technology, while others use laser 
technology.

Consider This
Who uses all-in-one printers?
Small/home office users have all-in-one printers because these devices require less space than having a separate 
printer, scanner, copy machine, and fax machine. Another advantage of these devices is they are significantly 
less expensive than if you purchase each device separately. If the device breaks down, however, you lose all four 
functions, which is the primary disadvantage.
	
3-D Printers
A 3-D printer uses a process called additive manufacturing 
to create an object by adding ­material to a three-dimensional 
object, one horizontal layer at a time. 3-D printers can print 
solid objects, such as clothing, prosthetics, eyewear, implants, 
toys, parts, ­prototypes, and more (Figure 7-33).
Using a digital model created with CAD (computer-aided 
design) software, 3-D printers begin creating an object at 
the ­bottom and add layers of material to the object until it 
is ­complete. Depending on the type of printer, the layers are 
built with liquid polymer, gel, or resin.
In the past, 3-D printers were quite expensive and used 
only by large corporations. Today, home and small business 
users work with more affordable desktop 3-D printers.
Thermal Printers
A thermal printer generates images by pushing electrically heated pins 
against heat-sensitive paper. Basic thermal printers are inexpensive, but 
the print quality is low, the images tend to fade over time, and thermal 
paper can be expensive. Self-service gas pumps often print gas receipts 
using a built-in, lower-quality thermal printer. Many point-­of-sale 
­terminals in retail and ­grocery stores also print purchase receipts on 
­thermal paper.
Some thermal printers have high print quality and can print at much 
faster rates than ink-jet and laser printers. A dye-sublimation printer, some-
times called a digital photo printer, uses heat to transfer colored dye to 
specially coated paper. Photography studios, medical labs, security identi-
fication systems, and other professional applications requiring high image 
quality use dye-sublimation printers that can cost thousands of dollars 
(Figure 7-34). Dye-sublimation printers for the home or small business 
user, by contrast, typically are much slower and less expensive than their 
professional counterparts. Some are small enough for the mobile user to 
carry in a briefcase.

Chapter 7  Input and Output
Mobile Printers
A mobile printer is a small, 
­lightweight, battery-powered printer 
that allows a mobile user to print from 
a laptop, smartphone, or other mobile 
device while traveling (Figure 7-35). 
Barely wider than the paper on which 
they print, mobile printers fit easily in a 
briefcase ­alongside a laptop.
Mobile printers mainly use ink-jet or 
thermal technology. Many connect to a USB port. Others have a built-in wireless port through 
which they communicate with the ­computer.
Label Printers
A label printer is a small printer that prints on an adhesive-type material that can be placed on 
a variety of items, such as envelopes, packages, optical discs, photos, and file folders (Figure 7-36). 
Most label printers also print bar codes. Label printers typically use 
­thermal technology.
Plotters and Large-Format Printers
Plotters are sophisticated printers used to produce high-quality 
drawings, such as blueprints, maps, and circuit diagrams. These print-
ers are used in specialized fields such as engineering and drafting and 
usually are very costly. Current plotters use a row of charged wires 
(called styli) to draw an electrostatic pattern on specially coated paper 
and then fuse toner to the pattern. The printed image consists of a 
series of very small dots, which provides high-quality output.
Using ink-jet printer technology, but on a much larger scale, a 
large-format printer creates photo-realistic-quality color prints. 
Graphic artists use these high-cost, high-performance printers for 
signs, posters, and other professional quality displays (Figure 7-37).

Impact Printers
An impact printer forms characters and graphics 
on a piece of paper by striking a mechanism against 
an inked ribbon that physically contacts the paper. 
Impact printers characteristically are noisy because 
of this striking activity (Figure 7-38). Impact print-
ers are ideal for printing multipart forms because 
they print through many layers of paper easily. 
Factories, warehouses, and retail counters may 
use impact printers because these printers with-
stand dusty environments, vibrations, and extreme 
­temperatures.
Discover More: Visit this chapter’s free resources 
to learn more about impact printers.
Other Output Devices
In addition to displays and printers, other output 
devices are available for specific uses and applica-
tions. These include speakers, headphones and 
­earbuds, data projectors, interactive ­whiteboards, 
and force-feedback game controllers and tactile output.
Speakers
Most personal computers and mobile devices have a small internal speaker that usually emits 
only low-quality sound. Thus, many users attach surround sound speakers or speaker systems 
to their computers, game consoles, and mobile devices to 
­generate higher-quality sounds for playing games, interact-
ing with multimedia presentations, listening to music, and 
viewing movies (Figure 7-39).
Most surround sound computer speaker systems include 
one or two center speakers and two or more satellite 
­speakers that are positioned so that sound emits from all 
directions. Speakers typically have tone and volume con-
trols, allowing users to adjust settings. To boost the low 
bass sounds, ­surround sound speaker systems also include 
a subwoofer.
In some configurations, a cable connects the speakers or 
the subwoofer to a port on the computer or device. With 
wireless speakers, however, a ­transmitter connects to a 
port on the computer, which wirelessly communicates with 
the ­speakers.

Consider This
What do the numbers mean in surround sound configurations?
The first number refers to the number of speakers, and the second number refers to the number of subwoofers. 
For example, a 2.1 speaker system contains two speakers and one subwoofer. A 5.1 speaker system has 
five speakers (i.e., four satellite speakers, one center speaker) and one subwoofer. A 7.2 speaker system has seven 
speakers (i.e., four satellite speakers, two side speakers, one center speaker) and two subwoofers.

Chapter 7  Input and Output
Headphones and Earbuds
When using speakers, anyone in listening distance 
can hear the output. In a computer ­laboratory or other 
crowded environment, speakers might not be practical. 
Instead, users can listen through headphones or ear-
buds so that only the individual wearing the headphones 
or earbuds hears the sound from the computer. The 
­difference is that headphones cover or are placed outside 
of the ear (Figure 7-40), whereas earbuds (shown with 
the audio output devices in Figure 7-23 earlier in the 
chapter) rest inside the ear canal. Both headphones and 
earbuds usually include noise-cancelling technology to 
reduce the interference of sounds from the ­surrounding 
environment.
A headset is a device that functions as both headphones 
and a microphone (shown in Figure 7-1 at the begin-
ning of the chapter). Computer and smartphone users 
wear a headset to free their hands for typing and other 
activities while talking or listening to audio output. Many 
headsets communicate wirelessly with the computer or 
mobile device.
As an alternative to headphones, earbuds, or headsets, you can listen to audio from mobile 
devices, such as a portable media player or smartphone, through speakers in a vehicle or on a 
stereo system at home or work. Or, you can purchase speakers specifically designed to play audio 
from the device.
Data Projectors
A data projector is a device that projects the text and images displaying on a computer 
or mobile device screen on a larger screen so that an audience can see the image clearly 
(Figure 7-41). For example, many classrooms use data projectors so that all students easily can 
see an instructor’s presentation on the screen.
Some data projectors are large devices that 
attach to a ceiling or wall in an auditorium. 
Others, designed for the mobile user, are 
small portable devices that can be transported 
easily. Two types of smaller, lower-cost units 
are LCD projectors and DLP projectors.
•  An LCD projector, which uses liquid 
crystal display technology, attaches 
directly to a computer or mobile device 
and uses its own light source to display 
the information shown on the computer 
screen. Because LCD projectors tend to 
produce lower-quality images, users often 
prefer DLP projectors for their sharper, 
brighter images.
•  A digital light processing (DLP) projector 
uses tiny mirrors to reflect light, which 
produces crisp, bright, colorful images 
that remain in focus and can be seen 
clearly, even in a well-lit room. Some 
newer televisions use DLP instead of 
LCD or plasma technology.

Interactive Whiteboards
An interactive whiteboard is a touch-sensitive device, 
resembling a dry-erase board, that displays the image 
on a connected computer screen, usually via a projector. 
A presenter controls the program by clicking a remote 
control, touching the whiteboard, drawing on or erasing 
the whiteboard with a special digital pen and eraser, or 
writing on a special tablet. Notes written on the interac-
tive whiteboard can be saved directly on the computer 
and/or printed. Interactive whiteboards are used fre-
quently in classrooms as a teaching tool (Figure 7-42), 
during ­meetings as a collaboration tool, and to enhance 
delivery of presentations.
Force-Feedback Game Controllers 
and Tactile Output
Joysticks, wheels, gamepads, and motion-sensing game 
controllers are input devices used to control movements 
and actions of a player or object in computer games, 
simulations, and video games. These devices also func-
tion as output devices when they include force feedback, 
which is a technology that sends resistance to the device 
in response to actions of the user (Figure 7-43). For 
example, as you use the simulation software to drive 
from a smooth road onto a gravel alley, the steering 
wheel trembles or vibrates, making the driving experience as realistic as possible. These devices 
also are used in practical training applications, such as in the military and aviation.
Some input devices, such as a mouse, and mobile devices, such as a smartphone, include tactile 
output that provides the user with a physical response from the device. For example, users may 
sense a bumping feeling on their hand while scrolling through a smartphone’s contact list.
Figure 7-42  Teachers and students can write directly on 
an interactive whiteboard, or they can write on a slate that 
communicates wirelessly with the whiteboard.

Assistive Technology Input and Output
The ever-increasing presence of computers in everyone’s lives has generated an awareness of the 
need to address computing requirements for those who have or may develop physical limita-
tions. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requires any company with 15 or more 
­employees to make reasonable attempts to accommodate the needs of physically challenged 
workers. Read Ethics & Issues 7-4 to consider who should pay for assistive technologies.

Chapter 7  Input and Output
Besides voice recognition, which is ideal for blind or 
­visually impaired users, several other input options are avail-
able. Users with limited hand mobility who want to use a 
keyboard can use an on-screen keyboard or a keyboard with 
larger keys. Users with limited hand movement can use a 
head-mounted pointer to control the pointer or insertion 
point (Figure 7-44). To simulate the functions of a mouse 
button, a user works with switches that control the pointer. 
The switch might be a hand pad, a foot pedal, a recep-
tor that detects facial motions, or a pneumatic instrument 
­controlled by puffs of air.
For users with 
mobility, hear-
ing, or vision 
disabilities, many 
different types of 
output options 
are available. Hearing-impaired users, for example, 
can instruct programs to display words instead of 
sounds. Visually impaired users can change screen 
settings, such as increasing the size or changing the 
color of the text to make the words easier to read. 
Instead of using a monitor, blind users can work 
with voice output. That is, the computer speaks out 
loud the information that appears on the screen. 
Another alternative is a Braille printer, which prints 
­information on paper in Braille (Figure 7-45).
Ethics& Issues 7-4
Who Should Pay for Assistive 
Technologies?
Public institutions, such as schools and 
libraries, are required to accommodate visi-
tors or students who require wheelchairs or 
other devices to enter and move about the 
building.These institutions install wide doors 
and ramps and modify restroom facilities to 
ensure accessibility. Should the same accom-
modations be available for those who need 
assistive technologies?
Assistive technologies include devices you 
can operate with your foot; one example 
is a mouse. Braille keyboards, printers, and 
display devices exist for visually impaired 
users. Several sources are available to fund 
assistive technologies. Health insurance 
covers many assistive technologies. 
Government programs, such as Medicare, 
Medicaid, or Social Security, offer some 
funding. In addition, private or nonprofit 
groups may provide grants or donations.
Many libraries offer digital versions of 
books, including digital Braille and audio, 
for those with visual impairments or 
dyslexia. Patrons must submit a request that 
includes recommendations from a doctor. 
The Individuals with Disabilities Education 
Act (IDEA) requires that public schools 
provide free and appropriate education for 
all students. Technology increasingly is an 
important part of a student’s education. 
Thus, schools are required to purchase or 
acquire funding for adaptive technologies 
for students who need them. If a student’s 
parents provide an assistive technology that 
a student uses at school, the school must 
pay to repair and service the device.
Consider This: Should parents of children 
who need assistive technology devices 
be required to provide funding or partial 
funding? Why or why not? What resources 
should public libraries provide to patrons 
with disabilities?

Finance
Watching the television, you notice a ticker at 
the bottom of the screen showing how various 
stocks currently are performing. You realize 
that the price of a stock you own has risen 
significantly, most likely the result of a recent 
press release about a new product they plan 
to release. A notification on your smartphone 
also alerts you of the sharp rise, and you 
decide to keep a closer eye on the price for the 
rest of the day in case you wish to sell some 
shares. You then use the app on your smart-
phone to check the balances in your accounts.
Because timely decisions often are 
important in the financial industry, technology 
helps provide important information to 
all who participate in various financial 
transactions. In the stock market, large 
displays on the trading floors of various 
exchanges help provide timely information 
to those buying and selling shares of stock. 
With the advancements in technology, stock 
traders now can see up-to-the-minute stock 
information on their computers and mobile 
devices using various finance programs and 
apps. Users can configure these programs 
and apps to display notifications when a 
certain stock’s price reaches a certain value 
so that they can decide whether they want 
to buy or sell shares. The program or app 
then can facilitate the sale or purchase of 
stock shares, all within seconds. Technology 
also enables users to buy or sell stock shares 
automatically when they reach a certain price, 
all without additional user intervention.
In addition to technology playing a role 
in the stock market, it also helps with 
banking for individuals and businesses. In 
fact, technology makes it possible to perform 
the majority of banking transactions, all 
without having to visit a bank teller. ATMs 
allow people the flexibility to deposit and 
withdraw funds from many locations around 
the globe. Web and mobile apps also are 
available and provide users with the ability 
to access account information, transfer funds 
between accounts, pay bills electronically, 
apply for loans, and complete the necessary 
information to open new accounts. Some 
financial institutions allow their users to use 
a mobile app on their smartphone to deposit 
checks by taking a picture of the front and 
back of an endorsed check. The next time you 
are able to perform a financial transaction 
easily with little or no human intervention, 
think about all the ways technology has made 
this possible.

Chapter 7  Input and Output
Personal
1.	Assistive Technologies  You have just purchased a 
new computer and, because of a visual impairment, 
you are having trouble reading the information on the 
screen. What are your next steps?
2.	Smart TV Issues  You are watching a movie on 
your Smart TV using a streaming media service. 
Every few 
minutes, a message 
is displayed on 
the TV stating 
that the movie is 
buffering. Why 
might this be 
happening, and 
what can you do 
to resolve this 
issue?
3.	Touch Gestures Not Working  You are using the 
stretch touch gesture to zoom on your mobile 
device. Each time you perform the gesture, however, 
instead of zooming, one of your fingers appears to 
be dragging an item around the screen. What might 
be the problem?
4.	Dim Screen  While using your laptop, the screen 
suddenly becomes dim. You set the brightness to its 
highest setting before it dimmed and wonder why it 
suddenly changed. After resetting the brightness to its 
highest setting, you continue working. What might 
have caused the screen to dim?
5.	Malfunctioning Earbud  While listening to music 
on your portable media player, one side of the 
earbuds suddenly stops working. What might have 
caused this?
Professional
6.	Printer Problem  You are attempting to print on a 
wireless printer from your laptop, but each time you tap or 
click the Print button, you receive an error message that 
the printer is not connected. What are your next steps?
7.	Projector Resolution Issue  You are preparing for a 
meeting in your company’s conference room and have 
connected your laptop to the projector. When the 
projector displays the information from your laptop 
screen, the resolution drops significantly and not 
everything fits on the screen. What steps can you take 
to correct this problem?
8.	Fingerprints Not Recognized  To increase security, 
your company now requires employees to sign in to 
their computer accounts using a fingerprint reader 
instead of entering a user name and password. This 
past weekend, you cut the finger you use to sign in, 
and your computer now does not recognize your 
fingerprint. As a result, you are unable to access your 
computer. What are your next steps?
9.	Access Denied  Your company uses security badges 
with embedded RFID tags to authenticate the rooms 
to which employees have access. This badge also grants 
employees access to the company’s parking lot. When 
arriving at work one morning, you wave your badge in 
front of the RFID reader, but the gate that allows access 
to the parking lot does not open. In addition, a red light 
blinks on the RFID reader. What are your next steps?
10.	Monitors Reversed  You have two monitors on your 
desk at work: the monitor on the left is your primary 
monitor and displays the taskbar and the applications 
you are currently using, and you typically use the 
monitor on the right to display an email program. 
When you arrive at work and sign in to your Windows 
account, you realize that the monitor on the right is 
now the primary monitor. What might have happened?
Instructions: You often can solve problems with technology in multiple ways. Determine a solution to the problems in these exercises by using 
one or more resources available to you (such as a computer or mobile device, articles on the web or in print, blogs, podcasts, videos, television, user 
guides, other individuals, electronics or computer stores, etc.). Describe your solution, along with the resource(s) used, in the format requested by 
your instructor (brief report, presentation, discussion, blog post, video, or other means).
 Problem Solving
The Problem Solving exercises extend your knowledge of chapter concepts by seeking 
­solutions to practical problems with technology that you may encounter at home, school, 
or work. The Collaboration exercise should be completed with a team.

11.	Technology in Finance  Technology enables individuals and businesses to conduct transactions in the finance 
industry with great convenience and speed; however, many individuals do not realize the extent to which technology 
impacts the industry. Form a team of three people to learn more about the important role that technology plays in 
today’s finance industry. One team member should research the different ways that technology impacts and improves 
personal financial transactions, such as home banking. Another team member should research how large businesses 
use technology to manage their finances, and the other team member should research the different ways technology 
has helped improve the stock market. Write a brief report summarizing your findings.

Work with QR Codes
QR codes initially were used in the automotive 
­industry to track vehicles during the production pro-
cess. Today, QR codes often are used in publications 
and advertisements to convey information, direct users 
to a website, suggest users download a file, or direct 
users to an app store or marketplace to download 
an app. Exercise caution when scanning QR codes, 
because they may direct your mobile computer or 
device to a malicious website or file. For example, it 
probably is wise to avoid scanning QR codes ­appearing 
on homemade flyers and other similar sources.
Scanning QR Codes
When you encounter a QR code that you want to 
scan, you should use an app capable of reading QR 
codes. The following steps guide you through the 
process of scanning QR codes.
a. Download and install an app that can read QR codes.
b. When you see a QR code you want to scan, run 
the app on your mobile computer or device. If 
necessary, select the option to scan a QR code.
c. Hold the device still and point its camera toward 
the QR code to scan it.
d. Once your device scans the QR code, it will 
display the associated information. If the QR 
code represents a web address, the app will run a 
browser and navigate to that address.
Generating QR Codes
If you want to generate a QR code to make it easier for 
others to navigate to a particular location or perform an 
action, you should use a QR code generator. The fol-
lowing steps describe how to generate QR codes:
a. Use a search engine to locate a website that contains 
a QR code generator and then navigate to it.
b. Enter the information, such as a web address, 
phone number, word, or short phrase, that you 
want the QR code to contain, and then tap or click 
the button to generate the QR code.
c. Copy the generated QR code image and then paste 
it in the desired location.
d. Scan the QR code to make sure it displays the 
results you expect.
Exercises
1. Compare and contrast at least three apps that can scan 
QR codes. Which one is your favorite? Why?
2. Compare and contrast at least three websites or apps 
that can generate QR codes. Which app would you use 
to generate QR codes? Why?
3. List at least three places you remember seeing QR 
codes. Did you scan them? Why or why not?

Record and Edit a Video
Once you have finished recording a video, you may 
want to edit it before sharing it with others. For exam-
ple, you might want to remove portions of the video, 
add ­special effects, or play an audio track instead of 
the audio recorded with the video. The following steps 
guide you through the ­process of recording and editing 
a video.
Record a Video
a. Verify your camera’s battery is charged and that 
the device has sufficient space available to store the 
video you are about to record.
b. If you plan to record the video from one location, 
consider placing the camera on a stable surface so 
that it does not move.
c. If you intend to record outside where it is windy, 
shield the camera from the wind.
d. Start the recording.
Instructions: You often can complete tasks using technology in multiple ways. Figure out how to perform the tasks described in these exercises 
by using one or more resources available to you (such as a computer or mobile device, articles on the web or in print, online or program help, user 
guides, blogs, podcasts, videos, other individuals, trial and error, etc.). Summarize your ‘how to’ steps, along with the resource(s) used, in the format 
requested by your instructor (brief report, presentation, discussion, blog post, video, or other means).
How To: Your Turn 
The How To: Your Turn exercises present general guidelines for fundamental skills 
when using a computer or mobile device and then require that you determine how to 
apply these general guidelines to a specific program or situation.

3	 Save as or Print to a PDF File
In an effort to conserve paper, people today think 
twice before printing a hard copy of a document. 
Instead of printing a hard copy of a document, many 
applications have a built-in feature enabling you to 
print soft copies in various formats, such as PDF. You 
can print to a PDF file from many apps, including 
Microsoft Office. When you save as or print to a PDF 
file (both saving as or printing to PDF produce the 
same results), anyone with an app capable of reading 
PDF files will be able the view the file without neces-
sarily having to open it in the same program from 
which it was created. Several free apps you can use to 
view PDF files are ­available. The following steps guide 
you through the ­process of printing to a PDF file.
a. Verify the app from which you want to print has a 
built-in feature to save files in or print files to PDF 
format. If this feature is not available, search for 
and install an app that enables you to save files to 
or print files in PDF format.
b. Open the file you want to save in or print to PDF 
format.
c. If you want to save the file as a PDF format, 
display the app’s Save As dialog box and check if 
PDF is one of the available file types.
d. If you want to print the file to a PDF, display the 
screen to print the file and select the appropriate 
printer to print the file to PDF.
e. Tap or click the button to save or print the file.
f. Specify a file name and save location for the PDF file.
Exercises
1. What are some applications you can use to view PDF 
files?
2. In addition to saving paper, what are some other 
reasons why you might save or print to a PDF?
4	 Take Screenshots
Many computer and mobile device operating systems 
allow you to take screenshots, which are snapshots 
of the screen that are saved as an image. In addition, 
third-party programs and apps also allow you to take 
screenshots. The following steps guide you through 
the process of taking a screenshot on your computer 
or mobile device.

On mobile devices, you may need to press specific 
buttons at the same time (such as the Home button 
and the Power button) or perform a specific hand 
gesture (such as swiping your hand across the 
screen).
d. Locate the screenshot. If you used a third-party 
app, it may be displayed immediately upon taking 
the screenshot. If you used an operating system 
such as Windows or Mac OS, you may need to 
run another app (such as Microsoft Word) and 
paste the image into the document. If you took the 
screenshot on a mobile device, you may be able to 
locate the screenshot in the image gallery.
Exercises
1. What are at least three reasons why you may need to 
take a screenshot?
2. Why might you want to use a third-party program or 
app to take a screenshot instead of using the built-in 
function in your computer or device’s operating 
system?
3. If you take a screenshot of an entire screen but require 
information in only one window on the screen, what 
steps can you take to manipulate the screenshot so that 
it shows only the portions of the screen you desire?
5	 Share a Photo or Video from Your Mobile 
Device with an Online Social Network
If you take a photo or record a video on your mobile 
device and want to share it with your friends, you 
might consider uploading it to an online social net-
work. You can share a photo or video from your 
mobile device with an online social network in several 
ways, depending upon the online social network and 
how your mobile device is configured. This exercise 
describes two common ways to share a photo or video 
from your mobile device to an online social network.
Share Button
You may be able to share photos or videos with 
an online social network easily by using the Share 
­button. To use the Share button, you must have the 
online social network account to which you want to 
share properly configured on your mobile device. 
The ­following steps guide you through the pro-
cess of ­sharing a photo or video from your mobile 
device with an online social network using the

the photo or video.
e. Tap the necessary button to share the photo or 
video.
Uploading Photos or Videos Manually
If you are unable to share your photo or video using 
the Share button, you can sign in to the online social 
network and upload it manually. The following steps 
guide you through the process of sharing a photo or 
video on an online social network by uploading it 
manually to your online social network account.
a. If necessary, take a photo or record a video you 
want to share.
b. Using an app installed on your mobile device or 
the online social network’s website, sign in to your 
account on the online social network on which you 
want to share the photo or video.
c. Tap the appropriate button to post or share a photo 
or video.
d. Navigate to and select the photo or video you want 
to share.
e. If desired, type a caption or message to share with 
the photo or video.
f. Tap the necessary button to share the photo or 
video.
Exercises
1. What types of photos or videos do you share with 
online social networks?

Chapter 7  Input and Output
1	 Making Use of the Web 
Health and Fitness
More than 70 percent of Internet users search online 
for health information, and their most commonly 
researched topics are specific diseases or conditions, 
treatments and procedures, and doctors or other health 
professionals. One-half of these online diagnosticians 
say that the information they found for themselves or 
someone else led them to seek medical attention.
Fitness websites and apps can provide guidance and 
motivation for all fitness levels and lifestyles. Expert ­advice 
is offered for designing customized workout routines, 
maintaining a nutritious diet, and buying equipment. 
Other features include downloadable MP3 workouts, 
videos demonstrating correct exercise techniques, and the 
ability to locate a virtual supportive workout buddy. Users 
often can set goals and then track their performance and 
overall progress with logs and detailed graphs.
Research This: (a) Visit WebMD and two other 
health websites and describe the features of each. 
Which of the three is the most user-friendly? Why? 
Search for the difference between the flu and a cold. 
Describe the symptoms of each and the recommended 
foods to eat when you are suffering from either ailment.
(b) Visit WebMD and two fitness websites. What 
similar features do these websites have, such as fitness 
tools, effective exercises, and food planners? Which 
website is the easiest to navigate? Why? Which articles, 
planners, and tools would you use to start or continue 
your fitness routines?
2	 Social Media
Aspiring musicians have turned to online social 
networks to break into the music business and to 
promote their material. Musical artists are urged to 
develop accounts on YouTube, Facebook, OurStage, 
MP3.com, Ourwave, Twitter, Myspace, Last.fm, 
PureVolume, and other online social networks to 
interact and stay connected with their fans. They can 
post information about concerts and album releases 
and sell concert tickets. They also can add music that 
fans can listen to, download at no charge, or pur-
chase. Some online social networks sponsor contests 
for bands to showcase their talents and vie for fans’ 
votes to play live at a local venue. Others are crowd-
funding websites where bands can ask fans to pledge 
a ­specific amount of money to support the artists’ 
­creative efforts.
Research This: View at least two websites that 
­allow listeners to recommend music and share 
playlists. What similarities and differences do these 
websites have? Locate one of your favorite artists 
on an online social network and describe the con-
tent displayed. For example, are concerts and new 
releases being promoted? Then, search for and then 
view at least two musician websites. What types of 
music are available? Which new artists and songs did 
you hear?
Instructions: Use a search engine or another search tool to locate the information requested or answers to questions presented in the exercises. 
Describe your findings, along with the search term(s) you used and your web source(s), in the format requested by your instructor (brief report, 
presentation, discussion, blog post, video, or other means).

3	 Search Skills 
News Search
Performing a news search using a search engine will 
limit search results to news stories that appeared 
recently or in the past in newspapers and magazines, 
news ­websites, and other electronic media news sources. 
To search for news articles about assistive technology 
devices, for example, type the search text, assistive tech-
nology devices, in the search engine’s search box and 
then tap or click the News link on the search page. You 
may narrow the results by specifying a date range or 
location. Tap or click the search button to see the results.
Research This: Create search text using the 
­techniques described above or in previous Search 
Skills exercises, and type it into a search engine to 
answer these questions. Present a summary of your 
findings. (1) Find news articles about the enterprise 
uses of 3-D printing. (2) Find news articles suggesting 
capabilities to be included in the next iPhone. (3) Find 
a news story published within the past week describing 
how any company uses QR codes. (4) Select a tech-
nology company and then find news stories about its 
financial earnings during the past three months.
4	 Security 
The Office of Cyber and Infrastructure Analysis 
(OCIA), a division of the U.S. Department of Homeland 
Security, strives to thwart and respond to physical or 
cyberthreats and hazards. Part of the office’s role is to 
implement two policies: (1) Presidential Policy Directive 
21 - Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience, 
and (2) Executive Order 13636 - Improving Critical 
Infrastructure Cybersecurity. These two policies are 
designed to strengthen and secure the country’s critical 
physical assets and services, such as air traffic control, 
natural gas supplies, water treatment, power plants, and 
finance, which are likely targets of cyberattacks. Federal 
agencies must comply with and routinely assess privacy 
standards and civil liberties protections. The government 
must share information regarding the cyberthreats, such 
as malicious code found on networks, but not contents 
of personal email messages. The private companies are 
urged to adopt the security incentives and increase their 
security ­systems, but participation is voluntary.
Research This: Locate Presidential Policy Directive 
21 - Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience 
and Executive Order 13636 - Improving Critical 
Infrastructure Cybersecurity and read their contents. 
Then, research news articles describing lawmakers’ and 
businesses’ support and criticism of these orders. What 
components are proposed to increase the nation’s 
cybersecurity? What positions do the Internet Security 
Alliance and The Internet Association take on this mat-
ter? What efforts has Congress made to pass legislation 
addressing computer security?
5	 Cloud Services 
Virtualization (IaaS)
An online business’s website receives higher traffic 
during peak holiday shopping times. Purchasing and 
configuring additional servers to meet this demand for 
the short term can be an expensive task for compa-
nies managing complex computing environments. To 
minimize cost and maximize performance, companies 
often use virtualization software rather than purchasing 
and installing additional memory, storage, or process-
ing power. Virtualization software allows one physical 
machine to emulate the capabilities of one or more 
servers. Virtualization is an example of infrastructure as 
a service (IaaS), a service of cloud computing that allows 
users to configure a computing environment’s hardware, 
devices, storage, and operating systems using software. 
Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure are two 
cloud providers of virtualization services. (To learn more 
about virtualization, visit Chapter 9’s free resources and 
read the High-Tech Talk article on this topic.)
Research This: (1) Use a search engine to find 
current articles, websites, or reviews of the virtualiza-
tion offerings of Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web 
Services. (2) Find a case study about a company using 
Microsoft Azure or Amazon’s virtualization services, 
summarize the problem the company was trying to 
solve, and describe how virtualization played a part in 
solving it. (3) Refer to the Chapter 6 Internet Research 
activity on private, public, and hybrid clouds. Why is 
running a private cloud in a virtualized environment a 
popular cloud computing solution?

Critical Thinking
Instructions: Evaluate the situations below, using personal experiences and one or more resources available to you (such as articles on the web or 
in print, blogs, podcasts, videos, television, user guides, other individuals, electronics or computer stores, etc.). Perform the tasks requested in each 
­exercise and share your deliverables in the format requested by your instructor (brief report, presentation, discussion, blog post, video, or other means).
The Critical Thinking exercises challenge your assessment and decision-making skills by 
presenting real-world situations associated with chapter concepts. The Collaboration 
exercise should be completed with a team.
1.	Bar Codes versus RFID  
You work as an efficiency analyst at one of the largest 
retail companies in the world, with multiple stores in 
every state, as well as in many other countries. For 
the past 25 years, the company has used bar code 
readers at checkout counters that scan the bar code 
on products to determine from a database the price to 
charge customers and to keep a record of inventory. 
The company is considering replacing the bar codes 
and bar code readers with RFID.
Do This: Analyze and discuss the impact such a change 
would have on the company, its suppliers, and its custom-
ers. Include in your discussion any security risks. Find 
two examples of RFID readers and compare prices, user 
reviews, and features. Are handheld options for RFID 
readers available for store clerks to use on the store floor 
or for customer checkout? Compile your findings. List 
advantages and disadvantages of implementing RFID. 
Include information about reliability and costs.
2.	Carpal Tunnel Syndrome  
While attending college for the past two years, 
you have worked part-time as a data entry clerk. 
Recently, you began to feel a pain in your right wrist. 
Your doctor diagnosed the problem as carpal tunnel 
syndrome, which is the most well-known of a series of 
musculoskeletal disorders that fall under the umbrella 
of repetitive strain injuries (RSIs). Your doctor made 
several recommendations to relieve the pain. You want 
to learn more about this debilitating injury.
Do This: Use the web to investigate carpal ­tunnel 
syndrome. Research the carpal tunnel syndrome 
warning signs and risk factors. Find suggestions about 
proper workstation ergonomics to avoid carpal tunnel 
syndrome. Evaluate the differences among various 
treatment options. Does insurance typically cover 
treatment? Include in your discussion the average 
length of time of recovery. How should you change 
your workspace to help heal and prevent further 
­damage? Should the company’s insurance pay for 
changes to your workspace? Why or why not?
3.	Case Study
Amateur Sports League  You are the new manager for 
a nonprofit amateur soccer league. You recently hired 
a part-time employee who is visually impaired. The 
league’s board of directors has asked you to assess your 
current input and output devices and make recommen-
dations for assistive technologies. The new employee 
will need to enter data and review on-screen and printed 
information to ensure accuracy and identify trends.
Do This: Use the web to find information about ­assistive 
input devices, such as voice recognition and larger key-
boards. Research output devices, such as large-screen mon-
itors and Braille printers. In 
addition to devices, research 
assistive software that you 
can install on existing com-
puters and devices shared by 
others. Find reviews from  
users of these assistive 
devices. Research costs for 
implementation, and find 
information about any grants 
your company can apply for 
as a nonprofit to ease the 
costs. Compile your findings.
4.	Printer Comparison  You work for a local real estate agency as an IT consultant. The agency needs a new, 
networked printer it can use to print high-quality, custom color brochures for the homes it is showing. Each 
brochure is printed double-sided on glossy paper, and the agency prints an average of 200 per week.
Do This: Form a three-member team. Refer to Figure 7-26 in this chapter, which lists several questions to consider 
when choosing a printer, and divide the questions among your team. Each team member should answer each question 
according to what the employer needs. Then, each team member should use the web to research at least two printers 
that meet the requirements. Meet with your team, and discuss and compile your findings. Share information about 
the printers you researched, describe their features, and evaluate their advantages and disadvantages. Identify any 
additional questions you might have for the employer, such as needs for wireless printing and printing from mobile 
devices. Which printer you would recommend? Why?

Storage
A storage medium, also called secondary storage, is the physical material on which a computer 
keeps data, information, programs, and applications. Examples of storage media include hard 
disks, solid-state drives (both of which can be internal or external), memory cards, USB flash 
drives, optical discs, network attached storage devices, magnetic stripe cards, smart cards, RFID 
tags, and NFC tags. Another storage option is cloud storage, which keeps information on servers 
on the Internet. Because the user accesses files on cloud storage through a browser using an app 
from the storage provider, the actual media on which the files are stored are transparent to the 
user. Figure 8-1 shows a variety of storage options.
In addition to programs and apps, users store a variety of data and information on storage media 
in their computers and mobile devices or on cloud storage. For example, many users store digital 
photos, appointments, schedules, contacts, email messages, and tax records. A home user also might 
store budgets, bank statements, a household inventory, stock purchase records, homework assign-
ments, recipes, music, and videos. In addition or instead, a business user stores reports, ­financial 
records, travel records, customer orders and invoices, vendor payments, payroll records, inventory 
records, presentations, quotations, and contracts. Business and power users store diagrams, draw-
ings, blueprints, designs, marketing literature, corporate newsletters, and product catalogs.
A storage device is the hardware that records and/or retrieves items to and from storage 
media. Writing is the process of transferring data, instructions, and information from memory 
to a storage medium. Reading is the process of transferring these items from a storage medium 
into memory. When storage devices write on storage media, they are creating output. Similarly, 
when storage devices read from storage media, they function as a source of input. Nevertheless, 
they are categorized as storage devices, not as input or output devices.
Objectives
Consider This
Does the amount of storage on a computer or mobile device affect the speed at which it operates?
Although the amount of storage does not directly affect the speed of a processor in a computer or mobile device, 
storage capacity (discussed next) could indirectly affect the overall performance. For example, a computer or mobile 
device with extra available storage may perform faster because the unused space can be used to hold temporary 
files while you browse the web and for virtual memory, discussed later in this chapter. Storage access times are 
discussed in more depth later in this chapter.

Chapter 8  Digital Storage
Storage Capacity
Capacity is the number of bytes (characters) a storage medium can hold. Table 8-1 identifies 
the terms manufacturers may use to define the capacity of storage media. For example, a storage 
medium with a capacity of 750 GB can hold approximately 750 billion bytes.
Storage requirements among users vary greatly. Home users, small/home office users, and 
mobile users typically have much smaller storage requirements than enterprise users. For 
­example, home users may need 1 to 2 TB (terabytes, or trillions of bytes) of storage for all 
of their digital content, while enterprises may require 20 to 40 PB (petabytes, or quadrillions of 
bytes) of storage.

Consider This
How do storage and memory interact?
When you turn on a computer or mobile device, it locates the operating system on its storage medium and loads 
the operating system into its memory (specifically, RAM). When you issue a command to run an application, such 
as a browser, the operating system locates the application on a storage medium and loads it into memory (RAM). 
When you are finished using the application, the operating system removes it from RAM, but the application 
remains on the storage medium.
A storage medium is similar to a filing cabinet that holds file folders, and memory is similar to the top of your 
desk. When you want to work with a file, you remove it from the filing cabinet (storage medium) and place it on 
your desk (memory). When you are finished with the file, you remove it from your desk (memory) and return it to 
the filing cabinet (storage medium).
	
Storage versus Memory
Items on a storage medium remain intact even when you turn off a computer or mobile 
device. Thus, a storage medium is nonvolatile. Most memory (i.e., RAM), by contrast, holds 
data and instructions temporarily and, thus, is volatile. Figure 8-2 illustrates this concept of 
volatility.
Consider This
What can a gigabyte store?
The total number of items that can be stored in a gigabyte will vary, depending on file size, quality of media,  
and a variety of other factors. As a general guide, though, a gigabyte can hold approximately 500,000 pages 
of text, 600 medium-resolution photos, 250 songs (2 to 3 minutes each), 4 hours of low-resolution video, or 15 
minutes of ­high-definition video.

Figure 8-2  A screen display is considered volatile because its contents disappear when power is removed. Likewise, most RAM 
is volatile. That is, its contents are erased when power is removed from a computer or mobile device. Storage, by contrast, is 
nonvolatile. Its contents remain when power is off.

Storage Access Times
The speed of storage devices and memory is defined by access 
time. Access time measures (1) the amount of time it takes a stor-
age device to locate an item on a storage medium or (2) the time 
required to deliver an item from memory to the processor. The 
access time of storage devices is slow, compared with the access 
time of memory. Memory (chips) accesses items in billionths of a 
second (nanoseconds). Storage devices, by contrast, access items in 
thousandths of a second (milliseconds) or millionths of a second 
(­microseconds).
Instead of, or in addition to, access time, some manufacturers state 
a storage device’s transfer rate because it affects access time. Transfer 
rate is the speed with which data, instructions, and information 
transfer to and from a device. Transfer rates for storage are stated in 
KBps (kilobytes per second), MBps (megabytes per second), and GBps 
(gigabytes per second).
Numerous types of storage media and storage devices exist to 
meet a variety of users’ needs. Figure 8-3 shows how different types 
of storage media and memory compare in terms of ­transfer rates 
and uses. This chapter discusses these and other storage media.

Chapter 8  Digital Storage
Media Sharing
Online services offer a host of tools for sharing ­photos, 
video, and music with friends and family. When 
researching locations to share media files, ask yourself 
the following questions:
• Where do my original files need to reside? Can 
I upload from my computer, mobile device, or camera? 
Can I send via text message or email?
• What is the cost? Is the service free, or must I pay a 
monthly or annual fee? What happens to my files if I 
miss a payment or cancel my account?
• How do I access and share the files safely? Is 
the service password protected? Can I use Facebook, 
Twitter, blogs, and email to share the files?
• What privacy rights are available? Can I 
determine who can access the files and see my 
profile? Can I use a geotag, which is geographical 
data that can pinpoint where a photo was taken?

Photos
Some photo sharing sites have millions of images 
to view and possibly download. When deciding which 
websites to use, consider the following factors:
• Services: Many services allow users to print the 
­images. They also offer photo-customizing products.
• Tools: Owners can create webpages and keep photos 
organized by using albums, titles, and tags. They also 
can join forums to share experiences.
• Features: It is efficient if you can upload many files 
simultaneously in one batch. Many websites allow 
visitors to write comments on uploaded photos.
• Storage space: Some services offer unlimited storage, 
while others may limit members to a maximum number 
of stored photos or limit the total storage space.
Video
With video recording available on most smartphones 
and cameras, virtually anyone who owns these devices 
can produce videos to distribute. The following features 
are found on popular video sharing sites:
• Video creation: Editing tools allow special effects, 
editing, titles, and descriptions.
• Audience interaction: On-screen and keyboard 
controls allow viewers to play, pause, fast-forward, and 
stop the videos. Audience members can rate the videos 
and browse specific categories.
• Features: Most services accept 
files saved in a variety of file 
formats, but the maximum file size 
may be restricted or limited.
• Genre: Some websites accept a 
wide variety of content, while others 
require original work.
Music
Online social networks and personal radio stations 
are popular sources of music. Some of these ­services 
are for listening only, while others sell songs to 
download. The following features are found on music 
­sharing sites:
• Playlists: Musicians and 
listeners can organize the 
songs and albums into specific 
categories, such as by artist or 
genre. In a playlist, each song 
can be played sequentially or 
shuffled to play in random order.
• Compatibility: Some file types will not play on 
specific mobile devices, so check permissible formats 
before attempting to upload or download songs.
• Features: Services show the album cover, list artist 
information, and provide song previews.
• Titles: Musicians use music hosting websites as a 
convenient method of distributing their works.

Hard Drives
The term, hard drive, refers collectively to hard disks and SSDs. Hard drives can be internal or 
external. That is, they can reside inside a computer or mobile device, or they can be an external 
device that connects to a computer or some mobile devices. The following sections discuss the 
characteristics of internal and external hard disks and SSDs.
Hard Disk
A hard disk, also called a hard disk drive (HDD), is a storage device that contains one or 
more inflexible, circular platters that use magnetic particles to store data, instructions, and infor-
mation. Depending on how the magnetic particles are aligned, they represent either a 0 bit or a 
1 bit. Recall from Chapter 7 that a bit (binary digit) is the smallest unit of data a computer can 
process. Thus, the alignment of the magnetic particles represents the data.
Desktops and laptops often contain at least one hard disk. The entire hard disk is enclosed in 
an airtight, sealed case to protect it from contamination (Figure 8-4). Read Ethics & Issues 8-1 
to consider whether governments should be able to confiscate computers and mobile devices to 
search the content of hard drives and other media.

Chapter 8  Digital Storage
The storage capacity of hard disks varies and is determined by the number of platters the 
hard disk contains, the composition of the magnetic coating on the platters, whether it uses 
­longitudinal or perpendicular recording, and its density.
• A platter is made of aluminum, glass, or ceramic and has a thin coating of alloy material that 
allows items to be recorded magnetically on its surface.
• Longitudinal recording aligns the magnetic particles horizontally around the surface of the disk. 
With perpendicular recording, by contrast, hard disks align the magnetic particles vertically, or 
perpendicular to the disk’s surface, making 
much greater storage capacities possible.
• Density is the number of bits in an area on a 
storage medium. A higher density means more 
storage capacity.
Hard disks are read/write storage media. 
That is, you can read from and write on a hard 
disk any number of times. Before any data can 
be read from or written on a hard disk, how-
ever, the disk must be formatted. Formatting 
is the process of dividing the disk into tracks 
and sectors (Figure 8-5) so that the operating 
system can store and locate data and informa-
tion on the disk. A track is a narrow recording 
band that forms a full circle on the surface of 
the disk. The disk’s storage locations consist of 
wedge-shaped sections, which break the tracks 
into small arcs called sectors. On a hard disk, a 
sector typically stores up to 512 bytes of data. 
Sometimes, a sector has a flaw and cannot 
store data. When you format a disk, the operat-
ing system marks these bad sectors as unusable.

Is Government Search and Seizure 
of Computers Ethical?
In the interest of national security, the 
Department of Homeland Security may 
search and seize any computer or mobile 
device belonging to anyone arriving in 
the United States. Authorities can conduct 
the sometimes random searches without 
a ­warrant or even a reason. Additionally, 
the government has taken computers from 
schools and libraries in a similar manner. 
Authorities who confiscate computers and 
mobile devices for an off-site inspection may 
hold them for any amount of time.
The Fourth Amendment protects against 
unreasonable search and seizure. Yet 
sometimes, authorities do not return the 
devices and provide little or no reason for 
the seizure. At airports and other points 
of entry to the country, the government 
considers computers and mobile devices to 
be containers, just as a piece of luggage is a 
container. Authorities, therefore, can search 
and seize computers and mobile devices 
without reasonable suspicion, just as they 
can with luggage.
Opponents claim that users may be 
unaware of some of the contents of a hard 
drive, such as with a shared or repurposed 
computer or device. Users also may not 
realize that the media on the computer 
or mobile device contains Internet search 
history, access to cloud storage, online social 
network activity, deleted email messages and 
documents, and drafts of email messages or 
documents that they never sent or saved. 
Opponents also claim that the government 
should be able to inspect the hardware but 
not the contents of memory or a hard drive. 
Librarians and school administrators have 
stated that the government is invading the 
privacy of patrons and students. Privacy 
experts warn that, even without physically 
inspecting a computer or device, the 
government may still be able to access 
digital content you save, search for, or post.
Consider This: Is government search and 
seizure of computers without a warrant 
­ethical? Why or why not? Do you believe 
a government employee should have the 
power to inspect the data on your mobile 
computer or device? Why or why not? 
If memories or thoughts someday are 
­decipherable by a computer at a secu-
rity checkpoint, should it be legal for the 
­government to scan them? Why or why not?

On desktops, the platters most often have a 
form factor (size) of approximately 3.5 inches 
in diameter. On laptops, mobile devices, and 
some servers, the form factor is 2.5 inches or 
less. A typical hard disk has multiple platters 
stacked on top of one another. Each platter has 
two read/write heads, one for each side. A read/
write head is the mechanism that reads items 
and writes items in the drive as it barely touches 
the disk’s recording surface. A head actuator on 
the hard disk attaches to arms that move the 
read/write heads to the proper location on the 
platter (Figure 8-6).
While the computer is running, the ­platters 
in the hard disk rotate at a high rate of speed. 
This spinning, which usually is 5,400 to 15,000 
revolutions per minute (rpm), allows nearly 
instant access to all tracks and sectors on the 
platters. The platters may continue to spin 
until power is removed from the computer, 
or more commonly today, the platters stop 
­spinning or slow down after a specified 
time to save power. The spinning motion 
­creates a cushion of air between the plat-
ter and its read/write head. This cushion 
ensures that the read/write head floats above the platter instead of making direct contact 
with the platter surface. The distance between the read/write head and the platter is about 
­two-millionths of one inch.
How a Hard Disk Works

Consider This
What happens if dust touches the surface of a platter on a hard disk?
Because of the close clearance between the read/write head and the platter on a hard disk, dust, dirt, hair, smoke, 
or any other contaminant could cause a disk to crash (Figure 8-7). A head crash occurs when a read/write head 
touches the surface of a platter, usually resulting in a loss of data or sometimes loss of the entire disk.
Although current internal hard disks are built to withstand shocks and are sealed tightly to keep out 
contaminants, head crashes occasionally still do occur. Thus, it is crucial that you back up a hard disk regularly.

Defragment a Hard Disk
As discussed in Chapter 4, defragmenting 
a hard disk can improve your computer’s 
performance by storing all related files for 
a particular program together. This can 
reduce the amount of time it takes the hard 
disk to locate and access the files neces-
sary for programs to run. Windows has a 
built-in tool to defragment a computer’s 
hard disk. Because the Mac OS defrag-
ments files automatically and writes smaller 
files closer together, Mac users generally 
do not have to defragment their hard 
disks. The following steps describe how to 
defragment a hard disk using the Windows 
operating system.
1.	 Open the Control Panel window.
2.	 Tap or click the Control Panel link on the 
Settings menu to display the Control Panel.
3.	 Tap or click the ‘System and Security’ link.
4.	 If necessary, scroll to display the 
‘Defragment and optimize your drives’ 
link.
5.	 Tap or click the ‘Defragment and optimize 
your drives’ link.
6.	 Tap or click the hard disk you wish to 
defragment.
7.	 Tap or click the Optimize button to begin 
defragmenting the selected hard disk. This 
process may take from several minutes to 
more than one hour.

Ssds
An SSD (solid-state drive) is a flash memory storage device that contains its own ­processor 
to manage its storage (Figure 8-8). As discussed in Chapter 6, flash memory is a type of non-
volatile memory that can be erased electronically and rewritten. Flash memory chips are a 
type of solid-state media, which means they consist entirely of electronic components, such as 
integrated circuits, and contain no moving parts. The lack of moving parts makes flash memory

Transfer Files from One Internal Hard 
Drive to Another
If you are replacing an existing internal 
hard drive (hard disk or SSD), you may 
want to transfer the files from one internal 
hard drive to another one. The following list 
describes ways to transfer files from one 
internal hard drive to another.
• Connect the new internal hard drive 
as a second internal hard drive in your 
computer (refer to your computer’s docu-
mentation to learn more about how to 
purchase and install a hard drive). When 
the operating system finishes loading, use 
the file manager in the operating system 
to drag the files you want to transfer from 
the original internal hard drive to the 
second one.
• Use a docking station or an external enclo-
sure to connect the second internal hard drive 
to the computer that contains the original 
internal hard drive. (An enclosure is a case 
that contains the same adapters found on 
a motherboard with which to connect the 
internal hard drive. The enclosure usually 
connects to a computer through a USB port. 
Be sure to select an enclosure that matches 
the dimensions and connections of your hard 
drive.) Use the file manager in the operating 
system to move or copy files from the original 
internal hard drive to the new one.
• Move or copy the files you want to 
transfer from the original internal hard 
drive to a separate storage device, such 
as a USB flash drive, or to a cloud stor-
age provider. Next, connect the second 
internal hard drive and then move or 
copy the files from the storage device 
or cloud storage provider to the second 
internal hard drive.
• Install and run a program designed to 
transfer files from an old internal hard 
drive to a new one. Some programs not 
only will transfer files but also may transfer 
programs and settings.
  Consider This: If you are purchasing a 
new internal hard drive, what types of files 
might you want to transfer from your existing 
internal hard drive? What types of files would 
you not transfer? Why?

SSDs have several advantages over traditional (magnetic) hard disks, including the  
following:
• Faster access times (can be more than 100 times faster)
• Faster transfer rates
• Quieter operation
• More durable
• Lighter weight
• Less power consumption (leads to longer battery life)
• Less heat generation
• Longer life (more than 10 times longer)
• Defragmentation is not required
Internet Research
Where might you buy a 
hard drive enclosure?
Search for: purchase hard 
drive enclosure
Consider This
Why do ssds have faster access times than hard disks?
Access time on a hard disk depends on the location of the data. That is, the data on the platter near the 
read/write head is accessed faster. The data on an SSD, by contrast, can be accessed almost instantly 
­wherever it is located because the drive contains no moving parts.
	
Consider This
Which should you use, a hard disk or ssd?
You may want to opt for a hard disk if you are looking for a looking for the lowest-cost option, use the 
­computer or mobile device only for basic tasks at one location, or if you require a large amount of storage 
space on a hard drive, such as for high-end media. If you transport the computer or mobile device frequently, 
want faster access to stored items, need a quieter drive (such as for audio recording), you may want to 
choose an SSD. Another option is a dual-drive computer, that is, one that includes both a hard disk and SSD, 
so that you can take advantage of the benefits of both drives.
	
BTW
Ssd Access Times
You do not need to 
defragment an SSD 
because the location 
of the stored data has 
no impact on its access 
times.
The disadvantages of SSDs are that they typically have lower storage capacities than 
hard disks, data recovery in the event of failure can be more difficult than for traditional 
hard disks, and their cost is higher per gigabyte. In order to keep the price of a laptop 
affordable, laptops with SSDs usually have a lower storage capacity than laptops with a 
­traditional hard disk.

External Hard Drives
An external hard drive is a separate freestanding storage device that connects with a cable 
to a USB port or other port on a computer or mobile device (Figure 8-9). Both hard disks and 
SSDs are available as external hard drives.
Sizes and storage capacities of external hard drives vary, with some having greater 
­capacities than internal hard drives. Smaller external hard drives are portable and enable 
mobile users to transport photos and other files from one computer to another easily. As with 
an internal hard drive, an entire external hard drive is enclosed in an airtight, sealed case. 
External hard drives units can include multiple hard drives that you can use for different 
­purposes, if desired.

Consider This
Why would you use an external hard drive instead of a second internal hard drive?
Although the transfer rate of external hard drives usually is slower than that of internal hard drives, external 
hard drives do offer many advantages over internal hard drives:
• Transport a large number of files.
• Back up important files or an entire internal hard drive (most external hard drive models include backup software).
• Easily store large audio and video files.
• Secure your data; for example, at the end of a work session, you can relocate or lock up an external hard drive, 
leaving no data in a computer. Read Secure IT 8-1 for instructions about encrypting files or drives to protect data.
• Add storage space to a mobile computer, such as a laptop or tablet.
• Add storage space to a desktop without having to open the case or connect to a network.

Encrypting Data and Files on Storage 
Devices
Hard drives and other storage devices are 
necessary tools for keeping, backing up, and 
transporting data and files. If they fall into 
the wrong hands, however, the data may 
be unprotected and subject to unrestricted 
access. Encryption encodes the data so that 
only authorized people can access the data.
Some operating systems provide a feature 
allowing users to encrypt individual files, 
folders, or the entire contents of a hard drive 
or external storage device. In addition, third-
party programs are designed to encrypt data. 
While each program may use a different 
method of encrypting files, they all use 
the process of cryptography. Mathematical 
functions, called algorithms, scramble the 
data. A password generally is needed to 
decrypt, or reassemble, this data. If this 
password is lost, the program or operating 
system’s documentation may identify a 
procedure that allows users to access the 
encrypted files. In some cases, however, the 
software will not decrypt the files without 
the password, so people might reconsider 
encryption if they anticipate great risk when 
losing access to these files.
Encrypted files offer security, but users 
might notice that the operating system 
may require more time to open and access 
encrypted files. While no encryption program 
is infallible, security experts recommend using 
this process to protect individual files, folders, 
or entire storage media with personal or 
sensitive information.
  Consider This: What types of files 
would you encrypt on media in or attached to 
your computer or mobile device? Would you 
consider not using encryption in the chance 
that you might lose the password?

Raid
Some personal computer manufacturers provide a hard drive 
configuration that connects multiple smaller hard disks or 
SSDs into a single unit that acts like a single large hard drive. A 
group of two or more integrated hard drives is called a RAID 
(redundant array of independent disks). RAID is an ideal storage 
solution in situations where uninterrupted access to the data is 
critical (Figure 8-10). Because enterprises often use RAID, the 
characteristics of these devices are discussed in more depth in 
the ­enterprise storage section of this chapter.

How do drives connect to a computer?
A controller, formerly called a disk controller, consists of a special-purpose chip and electronic circuits that 
control the transfer of data, instructions, and information from a drive to and from the system bus and other 
components in the computer. The controller may be part of a drive, may be on the motherboard, or may be a 
separate adapter card inside the computer.
In personal computer advertisements, vendors usually state the type of interface supported by the controller. In 
addition to USB, which can function as an interface for an external hard drive, four other types of interfaces for use in 
personal computers are EIDE, SCSI, SAS, and SATA.
• EIDE (Enhanced Integrated Drive Electronics) is an interface that uses parallel signals to transfer data, 
­instructions, and information. EIDE interfaces provide connections for hard disks, SSDs, RAID, optical disc drives, 
and tape drives.
• Like EIDE, SCSI (Small Computer System Interface) also uses parallel signals, but can support up to 8 or 15 
peripheral devices. Supported devices include hard disks, SSDs, RAID, optical disc drives, tape drives, printers, 
scanners, network cards, and more.
• SAS (serial-attached SCSI) is a type of SCSI that uses serial signals to transfer data, instructions, and information. 
Advantages of SAS over parallel SCSI include thinner, longer cables; reduced interference; lower cost; support for 
many more connected devices at once; and faster speeds. SAS interfaces support connections to hard disks, SSDs, 
RAID, optical disc drives, printers, scanners, digital cameras, and other devices.
• SATA (Serial Advanced Technology Attachment) uses serial signals to transfer data, instructions, and information. 
The primary advantage of SATA interfaces is that their cables are thinner, longer, more flexible, and less suscep-
tible to interference than cables that use parallel signals. SATA interfaces support connections to hard disks, SSDs, 
RAID, and optical disc drives. External drives can use the eSATA (external SATA) interface, which is much faster 
than USB.

Portable Flash Memory Storage
In addition to SSDs discussed in the previous section, two other widely used types of flash 
­memory storage include memory cards and USB flash drives. Users opt for memory cards and 
USB flash drives because they are portable.
Memory Cards
Memory cards enable mobile users easily to transport digital photos, music, videos, or other 
files to and from mobile devices and computers or other devices. As mentioned in Chapter 1, 
a memory card is a removable flash memory storage device, usually no bigger than 1.5 inches in 
height or width, that you insert in and remove from a slot in a computer, mobile device, or card 
reader/writer (Figure 8-11).

Common types of memory cards include SDHC (Secure Digital High Capacity), 
SDXC (Secure Digital Expanded Capacity), miniSD, microSDHC, microSDXC, CF 
(CompactFlash), xD Picture Card, Memory Stick PRO Duo, and M2 (Memory Stick 
Micro). Capacities of memory cards vary. A slot on a computer or device often accepts multiple 
types of cards. For example, an SD slot will accept an SDHC and SDXC card. To read a mini 
or micro card in a computer, you insert it in an adapter that fits in a standard-sized slot on the 
computer or device (shown in Figure 8-1 at the beginning of this chapter).
If your computer or printer does not have a built-in card slot, you can purchase a card reader/
writer, which is a device that reads from and writes on memory cards. Card reader/writers usually 
connect to the USB port on a computer. The type of card determines the type of card reader/
writer needed. Some accept multiple types of cards; others accept one type. Figure 8-12 shows 
how one type of memory card works with a card reader/writer.

Usb Flash Drives
As mentioned in Chapter 1, a USB flash drive, sometimes called a thumb drive, is a flash ­memory 
storage device that plugs in a USB port on a computer or mobile device (Figure 8-13). USB 
flash drives are convenient for mobile users because they are small and lightweight enough to be 
­transported on a keychain or in a pocket. With a USB flash drive, users easily transfer documents, 
photos, music, and videos from one computer to another. Storage capacities of USB flash drives 
vary. Read Secure IT 8-2 for pointers about safely removing a USB flash drive and other media.

Step 3
Flash memory chips store photos and other types of data 
and information. When requested, the controller transfers items 
stored on the ﬂash memory chips to the metallic conductors, 
using registers for temporary storage, as needed.
Step 1
When you insert a memory card in a card reader/writer 
or card slot, the memory card’s metallic conductors make 
contact with connectors in the card reader/writer or card 
slot, allowing the transfer of photos and other items 
between the card and the reading/writing device.
Step 2
A notch on the side of the 
memory card prevents the 
card from accidentally slipping 
out of the card reader/writer 
or card slot.
Step 4
Some memory cards 
contain write-protect 
switches, which prevent you 
from accidentally erasing 
photos and other items 
stored on the ﬂash memory 
chips.

What is the life span of a memory card?
Depending on the card, manufacturers claim their media can last from 10 to 100 years with proper care, 
including the following:
• Do not bend the card.
• Avoid dropping the card.
• Keep cards away from direct sunlight.
• Do not expose cards to extreme temperatures.
• Do not remove the card while data is transferring to or from it.

Safely Remove Media
If you are using portable flash memory 
­storage with your computer or mobile 
device, you should not remove the device or 
media while it is in use. Likewise, you should 
not remove a smartphone, digital camera, 
or portable media player that actively is 
connected to your computer. Although you 
might not be accessing files, the operating 
system still might be accessing the device, 
and disconnecting it may damage the files.
Operating systems typically provide an 
option to remove or eject the device or media 
safely and then will notify you when the 
device or media no longer is in use and can 
be removed. To remove or eject removable 
storage media, follow these steps:
1.	 Close any files or exit any programs that 
are open or running on the media.
2.	 Open the window displaying all the drives 
and media connected to your computer or 
mobile device and then select the drive or 
media you want to remove safely.
3.	 Tap or click the command to safely 
remove or eject the removable storage 
media. (If you are unable to locate this 
command, you may need to press and 
hold or right-click the icon representing 
the device or media to display a shortcut 
menu and then tap or click the command 
to remove or eject the device or media 
safely.)
4.	 When the notification appears stating 
that the device or media is safe to remove 
or eject, disconnect or remove it from 
your computer. If a notification does not 
appear, you can disconnect or remove the 
device or media once it no longer appears 
in your operating system as connected to 
your computer.
These guidelines generally apply to all 
types of portable flash memory storage, 
including USB flash drives, memory cards, 
and solid-state drives. When handling these 
storage devices, do not subject them to 
extreme temperatures, moisture, dust, or static 
electricity. Store them in cases, and try to 
avoid dropping them.
  Consider This: Do you follow the 
­guidelines described here before discon-
necting ­portable flash memory storage, 
­smartphones, digital cameras, and portable 
media players from your computer? If not, 
have you encountered ­damaged files on your 
storage devices? Should ­storage companies 
provide ­instructions on their ­packaging 
­materials about how to remove media safely?
Cloud Storage
Some users choose cloud storage in addition to storing data locally on a hard disk, SSD, or other 
media. As discussed in previous chapters, cloud storage is an Internet service that provides 
­storage to computer or mobile device users.
Cloud storage is available for home and business users, with various levels of storage services 
available. Cloud storage fee arrangements vary, depending on the user’s storage requirements.

Mini Feature 8-2: Services Offered by Cloud Storage Providers
Cloud storage provides access to your files across many devices. Read Mini Feature 8-2 to 
learn about services provided by cloud storage providers.
Consider This
What are some advantages of cloud storage?
Users subscribe to cloud storage for a variety of reasons:
• To access files on the Internet from any computer or device that has Internet access
• To store large audio, video, and graphics files on the Internet instantaneously, instead of spending time 
­downloading to a local hard drive or other media
• To allow others to access their files on the Internet so that others can listen to an audio file, watch a video 
clip, or view a photo — instead of sending the file to them via an email message
• To view time-critical data and images immediately while away from the main office or location; for example, 
doctors can view X-ray images from another hospital, home, or office, or while on vacation
• To store off-site backups of data
• To provide data center functions, relieving enterprises of this task
	
Consider This
What is a personal cloud?
Some hard drive manufacturers sell networked hard drives that make your data available on a cloud that 
exists within your home or office. That is, the networked hard drive connects directly to your router, creating 
a personal cloud that allows you to access its files over the Internet. With a personal cloud, you maintain the 
storage device on which the files are located versus a cloud storage provider where your files are stored on 
servers on the Internet that a cloud storage provider configures, maintains, and backs up.

Services Offered by 
Cloud Storage Providers
Microsoft OneDrive, Google Drive, Apple’s iCloud, 
Amazon Cloud Drive, Dropbox, and Box are among 
the many options that consumers consider for cloud 
storage. These and other cloud 
storage providers enable you 
to synchronize files, write docu-
ments, back up files on your 
computer or mobile device, 
share project work, stream 
music, post photos, and play 
games online. Many offer a 
limited amount of free storage 
and make additional storage 
available for a fee.
Synchronize Files
Many cloud storage providers place a folder on your 
computer with contents you can synchronize across 
multiple devices. Other providers allow you to upload 
files for storage online, and download them via a web 
app or mobile app. Cloud storage providers often retain 
previous versions of your files, in case you need to 
revert to an earlier one.
Write Documents
Google Drive and OneDrive provide integrated web 
apps to edit documents in a browser and store them on 
the cloud. Some third-party tools such as Evernote, an 
online note taking application, synchronize your notes 
with popular cloud storage providers.
Back Up Files
Storing files on the cloud is an easy way to back 
them up in case the hard drive on your computer fails 
or your mobile device is lost, stolen, or damaged. Some 
cloud backup services, such as Carbonite, automatically 
copy a computer or mobile device’s new or changed 
files to the cloud, freeing users of performing backups 
themselves. Backup providers generally do not synchro-
nize files across a user’s multiple devices, but only pro-
vide capabilities to store and retrieve files on the cloud.
Stream Music
You can play music and videos stored offline (i.e., 
on your computer or mobile devices) in places without 
Internet access. Many people also store their media files 
on the cloud, so as not to use up the limited internal 
storage available on mobile devices. Some services, 
such as Google Play, support streaming music stored on 
the cloud to Android, iOS, and other devices.

Post Photos
Photo sharing sites and online social networks 
­provide apps that support uploading photos taken with 
a smartphone or tablet to the cloud.
Play Games
Internet-connected game consoles enable you to 
save games in progress. Because game information is 
stored on the cloud, you can continue playing where 
you left off, regardless of whether you are using your 
own or another’s game console.
Evaluating Providers
With so many providers offering free and paid cloud 
storage services, it is important to compare features to 
take advantage of the capabilities that each offers. Criteria 
to consider include the amount of free storage offered, 
the cost to purchase more if needed, and the maximum 
file size that each service allows you to upload. Keep the 
files you use most on the service on which you have the 
most storage space; use services that support streaming to 
store and play media files. Photos, songs, and videos take 
longer to upload than smaller text or webpage files, so it 
is important to select a provider whose servers have suf-
ficient bandwidth to support large file transfers.
It also is important to read a cloud ­storage provider’s pri-
vacy policy and terms of agreement to which you must con-
sent before using its services. Some cloud storage providers 
may not guarantee the protection of the files you upload, so 
you still should keep a backup of the files you stored on the 
cloud. Read How To 8-3 to learn about selecting a cloud 
storage provider and deciding what to upload.

  Consider This: What are advantages of storing your 
files on the cloud? When does it make sense to use physical 
storage media, such as a USB flash drive, to store your 
files? Storing files on the cloud encourages collaboration 
and sharing. How can you share files stored on the cloud 
with your team members? Are you concerned about the 
security of your files when stored on the cloud? What 
information, if any, would you not store on the cloud?

Select a Cloud Storage Provider and 
Decide What to Upload to the Cloud
Many people are choosing to back up data 
to the cloud in addition to, or instead of, 
backing up to storage media such as exter-
nal hard drives and optical discs. Cloud 
storage providers enable you to synchro-
nize data on your computers and mobile 
devices effortlessly to one or more servers 
in remote locations. Various cloud storage 
providers exist, and it is important to select 
one that adequately meets your needs. 
In addition to selecting a cloud storage 
provider, you also should decide what to 
upload to the cloud.
Selecting a Cloud Storage Provider
Consider the following guidelines when 
selecting a cloud storage provider:
•	 Verify the company is reputable and has 
been in business for an extended period 
of time.
•	 Choose a provider that encrypts your files.
•	 Make sure the company has not fallen 
victim to major security breaches.
•	 Determine whether the provider’s service 
is compatible with your computer(s) and 
mobile device(s).
•	 Compare the price of various storage 
plans and choose a provider that offers 
competitive pricing.
•	 Verify the cloud storage provider will 
­support the types of files you want to 
back up. For example, some cloud storage 
providers might allow you only to back 
up photos, so they would not be a good 
choice to back up your personal files, such 
as documents and spreadsheets.
•	 If desired, choose a cloud storage provider that 
allows you to share selected files with others.
•	 Consider whether the provider offers a 
mobile app that you can use to access 
your files using a mobile device.
Deciding What to Upload to the Cloud
Consider the following guidelines when 
determining what to upload to the cloud. 
Before ultimately deciding what to upload, 
make sure the cloud storage provider you 
choose will adequately protect your files.
• Consider uploading files that you cannot 
afford to lose, such as financial documents 
or scanned copies of insurance paperwork.
•	 Upload files that might have sentimental 
value, such as photos and video. In the 
unlikely event of a disaster that ruins your 
computer, mobile device, and backups you 
possess, the cloud storage provider will 
retain these files.
•	 Do not back up programs and apps if you 
have access to the installation media or 
files.
•	 If your cloud storage provider offers only a 
limited amount of storage space, back up 
only the files you are sure you will need 
again in the future.
•	 Routinely review the files you have stored 
on the cloud storage provider and remove 
files you no longer need.
  Consider This: Which of your files would 
you back up to the cloud? Why? After review-
ing at least three cloud storage ­providers, 
which one would you choose? Why?

Chapter 8  Digital Storage
Optical Discs
An optical disc is a type of storage medium that consists of a flat, round, portable disc 
made of metal, plastic, and lacquer that is written and read by a laser. Optical discs used in 
computers typically are 4.75 inches in diameter and less than 1/20 of an inch thick. Game 
consoles and mobile devices, however, may use a mini disc that has a diameter of 3 inches 
or less; mini discs also work in standard-sized optical disc drives. 
Three widely used types of optical discs are CDs (compact discs), 
DVDs (digital versatile discs or sometimes digital video discs), and 
­Blu-ray Discs.
On some computers, you push a button to slide out a tray, insert the 
disc, and then push the same button to close the tray; others are slot 
loaded, which means you insert the disc in a narrow opening on the 
drive (Figure 8-14). When you insert the disc, the operating system 
automatically may run a program, play music, or start a video on the 
disc. Desktops and traditional laptops usually have an optical disc drive. 
Ultrathin laptops, tablets, and mobile devices typically do not have an 
optical disc drive.
Many different formats of optical discs are available today. Some are 
read only, meaning users cannot write (save) on the media. Others are 
read/write, which allows users to save on the disc just as they save on a 
hard drive. With most discs, you can read and/or write on one side only. 
Manufacturers usually place a silk-screened label on the top layer of these single-sided discs. You 
insert a single-sided disc in the drive with the label side up.
Characteristics of Optical Discs
Optical discs store items by using microscopic pits (indentations) and lands (flat areas) that 
are in the middle layer of the disc (Figure 8-15). A high-powered laser light creates the pits. A 
lower-powered laser light reads items from the disc by reflecting light through the bottom of 
optical disc

series of bits the computer can process. A land 
causes light to reflect, which is read as binary 
digit 1. Pits absorb the light; this absence of light 
is read as binary digit 0.
Optical discs commonly store items in a single 
track that spirals from the center of the disc to 
the edge of the disc. As with a hard disk, this 
single track is divided into evenly sized sectors 
on which items are stored (Figure 8-16).

What is the life span of an optical disc?
Manufacturers claim that a properly cared for, high-quality optical disc will last 5 years but could last up to 
100 years. Tips for proper care of optical discs include the following:
• Never bend a disc; it may break.
• Do not expose discs to extreme temperatures or humidity. The ideal temperature range for disc storage is  
50 to 70 degrees Fahrenheit.
• Stacking discs, touching the underside of discs, or exposing them to any type of contaminant may scratch a disc. 
Read How To 8-4 for instructions about cleaning and fixing scratches on a disc.
• Place an optical disc in its protective case, called a jewel case, when you are finished using it, and store it in an 
upright (vertical) position.
	
Clean an Optical Disc and Fix Scratches
If you are having trouble accessing programs 
and files on an optical disc, such as a CD or 
DVD, you may need to clean the disc or fix 
scratches on its surface. To avoid the risk of not 
being able to access a disc because it is dirty, 
you should clean a disc when you first notice 
dirt on its surface. The following steps describe 
how to clean or fix scratches on an optical disc:
Cleaning an Optical Disc
1.	 While holding the disc by its edges, use 
compressed air to blow excess dust off of 
its surface. Hold the can of compressed air 
upright while using it.
2.	 Use a soft, nonabrasive cloth to gently 
wipe debris off of the disc’s surface. Wipe 
the disc from the center out to its edges.
3.	 If any dirt remains on the disc, dip a soft 
cloth or cotton ball in isopropyl alcohol (or 
a cleaner designed for optical discs) and 
then gently wipe the soiled areas.
4.	 Use a soft cloth to dry the disc’s surface or 
allow it to air dry. You never should insert 
a wet disc in a computer.
Fixing Scratches on an Optical Disc
1.	 Complete the previous Steps 1 – 4 to 
clean the disc. If it still contains scratches, 
follow the remaining steps.
2.	 As with any maintenance you perform, 
risks are associated with attempting to fix 
scratches on an optical disc. For this reason, 
if possible, you should back up the data on 
the disc before attempting to fix a scratch.
3.	 Place a very small amount of rubbing 
compound (available at a hardware store) 
on a soft, nonabrasive cloth and rub the 
compound on the disc from its center 
outward at the location of the scratch. If 
rubbing compound is not available, place 
a small amount of toothpaste (not a gel) 
on the scratched area and rub from the 
inside of the disc outward.
4.	 Test the disc. If you still are ­experiencing 
problems because of the scratch(es), 
­consider having a professional remove 
the scratch.

Chapter 8  Digital Storage
CDs
CDs are available in three basic formats: read-only, recordable, and rewritable.
• A CD-ROM  (CD-read-only memory) is a type of optical disc that users can read but not 
write on (record) or erase — hence, the name read-only. Manufacturers write the contents 
of standard CD-ROMs and distribute them to consumers. A standard CD-ROM is called 
a single-session disc because manufacturers write all items on the disc at one time. Software 
manufacturers sometimes distribute their programs using CD-ROMs. The term, photo CD, 
sometimes is used to refer to CDs that contain only photos.
• A CD-R (CD-recordable) is an optical disc on which users can write once, but not erase, their 
own items, such as text, graphics, and audio. Because a CD-R can be written on only one time, 
the format of these discs sometimes is called WORM (write once, read many). Some CD-Rs 
are multisession, which means you can write on part of the disc at one time and another part at 
a later time — if the disc has free space.
• A CD-RW (CD-rewritable) is an erasable multisession disc users can write on multiple times. 
CD-RW overcomes the major disadvantage of CD-R because it allows users to write and 
rewrite data, instructions, and information on the CD-RW disc multiple times — instead of 
just once. Reliability of the disc tends to drop, however, with each successive rewrite.
A popular use of CD-RW and CD-R discs is to create audio CDs. For example, you can 
record your own music and save it on a CD, purchase and download songs from the web, or 
rearrange tracks on a purchased music CD.
BTW
Burning and Ripping
The process of writing 
on an optical disc is 
called burning. The 
process of copying audio 
and/or video data from 
a purchased disc and 
saving it on your own 
media is called ripping.
BTW
Dvd/cd-rw
Some drives, called 
DVD/CD-RW drives, are 
combination drives that 
read and write on DVD 
and CD media. Current 
computers that include 
optical drives often 
use these combination 
drives.
DVDs
DVD quality for storing videos far surpasses that of CDs because items are stored in a slightly 
different manner, which enables DVDs to have greater storage capacities and higher resolu-
tions than CDs. The first storage technique involves making the disc denser by packing the pits 
closer together. The second involves using two layers of pits. This technique doubles the capac-
ity of the disc because the lower layer of pits is semitransparent, which allows the laser to read 
through it to the upper layer. Finally, some DVDs are double-sided. A more expensive DVD 
format is Blu-ray, which has a higher capacity and better quality than standard DVDs, especially 
for high-definition audio and video.
As with CDs, DVDs are available in three basic formats: read-only, recordable, and rewritable.
• A DVD-ROM (DVD-read-only memory) is a high-capacity optical disc that users can read 
but not write on or erase. Manufacturers write the contents of DVD-ROMs and distribute 
them to consumers. DVD-ROMs store movies, music, music videos, huge databases, and 
applications you install on a computer.
• DVD-R and DVD1R are competing DVD-recordable WORM formats, on which users

Can all Cd drives read all Cd formats?
A CD-ROM drive or a CD player may be able to read only CD-ROMs and sometimes CD-Rs. Because audio CDs and 
CD-ROMs use the same laser technology, you may be able to use a CD-ROM drive to listen to an audio CD while 
using the computer.
Most CD-R drives can read audio CDs, CD-ROMs, CD-Rs, and sometimes CD-RWs. Most CD-RW drives can read 
audio CDs, CD-ROMs, CD-Rs, and CD-RWs. To write on a CD-R disc, you must have a CD-R drive. Similarly, to write 
on a CD-RW disc, you must have a CD-RW drive.

Enterprise Storage
Enterprise hardware allows large organizations to manage and store data and information using 
devices intended for heavy use, maximum efficiency, and maximum availability. The availability 
of hardware to users is a measure of how often it is online. Highly available hardware is acces-
sible 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. To meet these needs, enterprise hardware often includes 
levels of redundancy, which means that if one component fails or malfunctions, another can 
assume its tasks.
Some organizations manage an enterprise storage system in-house. Others elect to offload all (or 
at least the backup) storage management to an outside organization or a cloud storage provider, a 
practice known as outsourcing. Enterprises use a combination of storage techniques to meet their 
large-scale needs, including cloud storage and some of the other previously discussed methods, along 
with RAID, network attached storage, storage area networks, and tape. Read Ethics & Issues 8-2 to 
consider issues with employees bringing their own devices into an ­enterprise.
Consider This
Can all DVD drives read all DVD formats?
No. In addition to DVD-ROMs, most DVD-ROM drives also can read audio CDs, CD-ROMs, CD-Rs, and CD-RWs. 
Recordable and rewritable DVD drives usually can read a variety of DVD and CD media. Blu-ray Disc (BD) drives 
and players are backward compatible with DVD and CD formats. Before investing in equipment, check to be sure it 
is compatible with the media on which you intend to record.

Are Businesses Vulnerable when 
Employees Use Their Own Devices 
to Access Company Data?
BYOD (bring your own device) strategies 
enable employees to access company data 
from a personal smartphone, tablet, or 
laptop. Companies might adopt or allow a 
BYOD policy to save money on the cost of 
buying and maintaining devices. Employers 
might increase productivity by allowing 
employees to work in the environment in 
which they are most comfortable.
BYOD raises many privacy and security 
concerns. IT managers, security experts, and 
human resource directors work together to 
create and enforce a BYOD policy. BYOD 
guidelines should balance securing company 
data and preventing unauthorized network 
access with ensuring personal autonomy and 
privacy over employees’ personal data. IT 
managers express concern over the potential 
need to service many different types of 
devices, if the company policy requires it to 
troubleshoot or secure employee devices. 
A company’s security team must protect 
company data. In some cases, employees 
must install a tool to remotely wipe data, 
including personal data, if the device is lost, 
damaged, or stolen. Human resource directors 
help devise guidelines regarding cost-sharing 
and how to protect employees’ private data 
and activities. Some industries may not be 
able to allow BYOD, as it may violate data 
privacy laws.
Many companies ban certain apps, such as 
gaming or file sharing, because of concerns 
over malware risks. In many cases, employees 
must agree to back up data. Employees 
should protect the device with a password or 
biometric security feature. Some companies 
employ a geofence, which is a virtual 
perimeter or boundary, to disable certain apps 
or cameras in secure areas, such as labs or 
meeting rooms.
Consider This: If you use your own device 
for work, would you be willing to give some 
control over the device to your company? 
Why or why not? Should companies be able 
to punish employees who violate BYOD 
policies? Why or why not?

Chapter 8  Digital Storage
Enterprise storage often uses Fibre Channel (FC) technology as the interface that connects the 
devices to the network because FC technology has much faster transmission rates than SCSI and 
other previously discussed interfaces.

RAID
For applications that depend on reliable data 
access, users must have the data available when they 
attempt to access it. Some manufacturers provide 
a type of hard drive system that connects several 
smaller drives into a single unit that acts like a 
single large hard drive. As mentioned earlier in this 
chapter, a group of two or more integrated hard 
drives is called a RAID (Figure 8-17). Although 
RAID can be more expensive than traditional hard 
drives, it is more reliable. Computers and enterprise 
storage devices often use RAID.
RAID duplicates data, instructions, and ­information 
to improve data reliability. RAID ­implements this 
duplication in different ways, depending on the stor-
age design, or level, being used. The simplest RAID 
storage design is level 1, called mirroring, which writes 
data on two drives at the same time to duplicate the 
data (Figure 8-18a). A level 1 configuration enhances 
storage reliability because, if a drive should fail, a 
duplicate of the requested item is available ­elsewhere 
within the array of drives.
Other RAID levels use a technique called striping, which splits data, instructions, and 
­information across multiple drives in the array (Figure 8-18b). Striping improves drive access 
times, but does not offer data duplication. For this reason, some RAID levels combine both 
­mirroring and striping.

integrated hard disks.

NAS and SAN
Network attached storage (NAS) is a server that is placed on a network with the sole ­purpose 
of providing storage to users, computers, and devices attached to the network (Figure 8-19). A 
network attached storage server, often called a storage appliance, has its own IP address, usually 
does not have a ­keyboard or display, and contains at least one hard drive, often configured in a 
RAID. Administrators can add storage to an existing network quickly by connecting a network 
attached storage server to a network.

A storage area network (SAN) is a high-speed network with the sole purpose of providing storage 
to other attached servers (Figure 8-20). In fact, a storage area network includes only storage devices. 
High-speed fiber-optic cable usually connects other networks and servers to the storage area network, 
so that the networks and servers have fast access to large storage capacities. A storage area network 
can connect to networks and other servers that are miles away using high-speed network connections.
Both network attached storage and storage area network solutions offer easy management 
of storage, fast access to storage, sharing of storage, and isolation of storage from other serv-
ers. Isolating the storage enables the other servers to concentrate on performing a specific task, 
rather than consuming resources involved in the tasks related to storage. Both storage solutions 
include disk, optical disc, and magnetic tape types of storage.

Chapter 8  Digital Storage
Magnetic Tape
One of the first storage media used with enterprise 
computers was tape. Tape is a ­magnetically coated 
ribbon of plastic that is capable of storing large 
amounts of data and information at a low cost. Before 
the use of digital music players became widespread, 
cassette tapes were a popular medium to store music. 
Tape no longer is used as a primary method of stor-
age. Instead, ­businesses use tape most often for long-
term storage and backup.
Comparable to a cassette recorder, a tape 
drive reads from and writes on a magnetic tape. 
Although older computers used reel-to-reel tape 
drives, today’s tape drives use tape cartridges. A 
tape cartridge is a small, rectangular, plastic hous-
ing for tape. Enterprises typically use a tape library, 
where individual tape cartridges are mounted in a 
separate cabinet. Often, a tape robot automatically 
retrieves tape cartridges (Figure 8-21), which are 
identified by ­location or bar code.
Consider This
Which do enterprises typically use, network attached storage or storage area networks?
Enterprises sometimes choose to implement both network attached storage and storage area network solutions. 
A network attached storage server is better suited for adding storage to an existing network, such as a department’s 
file server. A company typically implements a storage area network solution as central storage for an entire 
enterprise.
	
Consider This
Is tape as fast as other storage techniques?
No. Tape storage requires sequential access, which refers to reading or writing data consecutively. In much the 
same way you would find a specific song on a cassette tape or videotape, you must forward or rewind to a specific 
position to access a specific piece of data. On a tape, for example, to access items ordered A, B, C, and D, you must 
pass through items A, B, and C sequentially before you can access item D.
Hard drives, flash memory storage, and optical discs all use direct access. Direct access, also called random 
access, means that the device can locate a particular data item or file immediately, without having to move 
consecutively through items stored in front of the desired data item or file. When writing or reading specific data, 
direct access is much faster than sequential access.
	
Other Types of Storage
In addition to the previously discussed types of storage, other options are available for specific 
uses and applications. These include magnetic stripe cards, smart cards, RFID tags, and NFC 
chips and tags. Read Ethics & Issues 8-3 to consider the ramifications of devices not secured 
after product development.

Magnetic Stripe Cards
A magnetic stripe card is a credit card, entertainment card, 
bank card, or other similar card with a stripe that contains 
­information identifying you and the card (Figure 8-22). The card 
issuer, such as a financial organization, encodes information in the 
stripe. The information in the stripe often includes your name, 
account number, and the card’s expiration date. When you swipe 
the card through a magstripe reader, discussed in the ­previous 
chapter, it reads information stored on the stripe.
Smart Cards
A smart card, which is an alternative to a magnetic stripe card, 
stores data on an integrated circuit embedded in the card (Figure 8-23). 
Two types of smart cards, also called chip cards, are contact and contactless. When you insert a 
contact smart card in a specialized card reader, the information on the smart card is read and, if 
necessary, updated. Contactless smart cards communicate with a reader using a radio frequency, 
which means the user simply places the card near the reader.
Ethics & Issues 8-3
Should Manufacturers Be Required 
to Close Back Doors after Product 
Development?
As discussed in Chapter 5, a back door is a 
program or set of instructions that allows 
users to bypass security controls when access-
ing a program, computer, or network. Software 
developers often include a back door during 
product development to modify program code 
when troubleshooting. In these instances, a 
back door is necessary. What happens, though, 
when a hacker finds or creates a back door?
Hackers look for known security issues 
in software to access a computer or mobile 
device through a back door. If a hacker is 
unable to find and use a back door, they 
use trojan horses (previously discussed in 
Chapter 5) to deliver a payload that creates 
a back door. Hackers use back doors to gain 
control over a computer or mobile device 
so that they can use its resources to mount 
further malware attacks or to send spam. 
Using an unsuspecting user’s resources to 
distribute spam or malware enables the hacker 
to avoid detection from and identification by 
authorities.
Back doors pose a serious security risk 
because they allow unauthorized access to your 
computer or mobile device’s resources, files, 
and network whenever you are on the Internet. 
Not only can hackers control your computer 
or mobile device, but they can look through 
your files to find and steal your personal 
information. Users often are unaware of a back 
door’s existence and do not know when it is 
breached. If your computer acts strangely or 
performance decreases, you may have been 
the victim of a hacker. Do not connect to the 
Internet until you run an antivirus program.
Consider This: Should software develop-
ers close back doors created during product 
development? Why or why not? Has your 
computer or device ever been hacked using 
a back door? If so, how did you detect and 
resolve the issue?

Uses of smart cards include storing medical records, vaccination data, and other health care and ­identification 
information; tracking information, such as employee attendance or customer purchases; storing a prepaid amount 
of money, such as for student purchases on campus or fares for public transportation; and ­authenticating users, 
such as for Internet purchases or building access. In addition, a smart card can double as an ID card or credit card.

Chapter 8  Digital Storage
RFID Tags
Recall that RFID is a technology that uses radio signals to 
­communicate with a tag placed in or attached to an object, an ­animal, 
or a person. The RFID tag consists of an antenna and a memory 
chip that contains the information to be transmitted via radio waves 
(Figure 8-24). An RFID reader reads the radio signals and transfers the 
information to a computer or computing device.
RFID tags are either passive or active. An active RFID tag contains 
a battery that runs the chip’s circuitry and broadcasts a signal to the 
RFID reader. A passive RFID tag does not contain a battery and, thus, 
cannot send a signal until the reader activates the tag’s antenna by 
sending out electromagnetic waves. Because passive RFID tags con-
tain no battery, these can be small enough to be embedded in skin.
Consider This
How do RFID tags differ from contactless smart cards?
The physical size of the chip and storage capacities in an RFID tag typically are much smaller than the chips 
in contactless smart cards. The chips in RFID tags usually are read only, whereas the chips in contactless smart 
cards can function as a processor. Also, RFID tags often are not as secure as contactless smart cards. Thus, 
credit cards that contain RFID tags, called RFID-enabled credit cards, may not be as secure as those that use 
­contactless technology.
	
Secure IT 8-3 
Using Credit Cards Safely
Consumers in the United States own more 
than 775 million credit and debit cards, and 
the average cardholder has multiple cards 
available to use. With this widespread use, 
the potential for theft is high.
The newest smart cards have embedded 
RFID tags that allow vendors to obtain the 
account number without physically touching 
the card. While this technology is convenient 
for both the merchant and consumer, it also 
enables thieves with remote scanners to 
capture the card’s information without the 
owner’s knowledge.
Thieves also use a handheld device to 
swipe the card and then obtain and store 
account details. This action, called skimming, 
is prevalent at gas stations, restaurants, and 
lounges, where unscrupulous employees sell 
the information to criminals who then spend 
your money or steal your identity.
Follow these tips to help keep your credit 
card account safe:
Do
• Use a card with added security features, 
such as a photo.
• Draw a line through blank areas on 
­restaurant charge slips. If you have left a 
cash tip on the table, write the words, On 
Table, in the slip’s tip amount section.
• Cover the keypad when entering a PIN.
• Save charge receipts and check them against 
monthly statements or online postings.
• Keep a record in a safe place of all your 
credit card numbers, expiration dates, and 
toll-free numbers to call if you need to 
report a lost or stolen card.
• Purchase an RFID-proof wallet to shield 
smart cards from remote readers.
• Shred new credit account mail solicitations.
• Look for skimmers, which can capture a 
credit card number. (Read Secure IT 3-2 in 
Chapter 3 for information about skimmers 
at ATMs and other self-service stations.)
Do Not
• Reveal your account number during a 
phone call unless you have initiated the 
call.
• Write your PIN on the card or on the 
protective envelope.
• Sign a blank charge slip.
• Carry extra cards, especially when traveling 
to unfamiliar locations.
• Let your card out of sight. While you may 
not be able to follow this advice at a 
restaurant when you hand the card to a 
server, you can be observant of employees’ 
behaviors.

device, such as a smartphone, contains an NFC chip (Figure 8-25). Other objects, 
such as credit cards and tickets, can contain an NFC chip. An NFC tag, similar to 
RFID tag, contains a chip and an antenna that contains information to be trans-
mitted (shown in Figure 8-1 at the beginning of the chapter). Most NFC tags are 
self-adhesive, so that they can be attached to any location.
When a user places the NFC-enabled device close to another ­NFC-enabled 
device or an NFC tag, radio waves enable communications between the chips 
in the NFC-enabled devices or the chip in the NFC-enabled device and the 
NFC tag. Uses of NFC ­communications includes using a mobile device to 
pay for goods or services, displaying a ­webpage, making a phone call, sending 
a text message, or exchange contact information. Read Secure IT 8-4 for  
how to secure NFC transactions.

Secure IT 8-4 
Keeping NFC Transactions Safe
NFC-enabled phones offer convenience when 
making contactless payments at the point of 
sale. A user simply waves his or her smart-
phone above a reader attached to a register, 
and money is deducted from a credit card 
or account that is registered when the NFC 
application is installed. The security of this 
technology, however, raises major issues.
Eavesdropping is one concern. The phones 
and the merchant’s receivers need to be less 
than 8 inches apart to communicate with 
each other and complete the wireless data 
transfer, but even this short distance leads to 
vulnerabilities that allow cyberthieves to steal 
financial and other personal data. Attackers 
can stand near the sales counter to intercept 
the smartphone’s signals or use antennas to 
extend the signal’s range. Another issue is data 
corruption and modification, when the ­high-tech 
criminals change or delete communications 
between the devices. Customers also are uneasy 
when the technology allows merchants to load 
coupons, advertisements, and other adware on 
the phone during the NFC transaction without 
the shopper’s permission.
Hardware manufacturers and software 
engineers are working to improve security 
between the smartphones and the readers 
that receive the signals, but consumers need 
to exercise common sense and be proactive 
in protecting their sensitive information. They 
should follow these procedures in an attempt 
to avoid security breaches:
• Use a strong passcode on the phone and a 
PIN for the NFC transaction.
• Lock the phone when it has not been used 
for several minutes.
• Install antivirus software.
• Install an app that takes a photograph of 
a person trying to access a phone without 
permission and then sends a message to 
another mobile device when the phone has 
been stolen, or uses the phone’s GPS to 
track its locations.
• Turn off Bluetooth discoverable status 
when not using this feature.
  Consider This: Have you used NFC 
­transactions? If so, did you take any ­precautions 
to keep your data safe? If not, would you con-
sider using NFC technology to pay for goods 
and services? Why or why not?
Mini Feature 8-3: Backup Plans
To protect against data loss, users should back up the contents of their storage devices 
­regularly. Read Mini Feature 8-3 to learn about backup plans.
Backup Plans
Data loss or corruption can cause many issues. A user 
who accidentally misplaces a mobile device may lose 
contact information. A small business owner whose 
hard drive is infected with a virus may lose financial 
data, making billing and tax preparation difficult. A 
power user whose office floods and ruins a desktop 
not only may lose work completed on complex projects 
but also may need to replace expensive software. The 
best method for protecting against data loss from these 
types of unforeseen circumstances is to back up data.
A backup plan specifies a regular schedule for copy-
ing and storing important data, information, apps, and 
programs. Organizations should state their backup plans 
clearly, document them in writing, and follow them con-
sistently. Home and small business users can use a cal-
endar app or other reminder to keep a backup schedule 
for their computers or mobile devices, or use a program 
or app that performs automatic backups. Backup plans 
should weigh the time and expense of performing a 
backup against the value of the data, information, apps, 
and programs. For example, a small business may perform 
one type of backup daily, while a home user may find that 
monthly backups are sufficient. Read Ethics & Issues 8-4 
to consider storage requirements for public companies.
As briefly discussed in Chapter 5, business and home 
users can use four methods for backup: full, differential,

incremental, or selective. Typically, only large enterprises 
uses a fifth type, continuous data protection. Cloud 
backup services, a sixth option, provide continuous 
data protection capabilities at a lower cost. Users can 
choose to backup to external media, or, as increasingly 
more are choosing to do, to the cloud.
• A full backup, sometimes called an archival backup, 
provides the best protection against data loss because it 
copies all program and data files. Generally, users should 
perform a full backup at regular intervals, such as at the 
end of each week and at the end of the month.
• Between full backups, you can perform differential 
or incremental backups. A differential backup copies 
only the files that have changed since the last full 
backup. An incremental backup copies only the 
files that have changed since the last full or last 
incremental backup.
• A selective backup, sometimes called a partial 
backup, allows the user to choose specific files to 
back up, regardless of whether or not the files have 
changed since the last incremental backup.
Backup software enables you to schedule backups, 
select the appropriate backup type, and choose the 
storage media for the backup. Traditional storage media 
includes CDs or DVDs, external hard drives, or remov-
able SSDs, including USB flash drives or memory cards. 
Whichever storage media you choose, it should be stored 
separately from the device you are backing up to ensure 
it is available in case of theft or disaster. When choosing 
storage media, consider price and reliability. A USB flash 
drive may be inexpensive, but it also could be corrupted 
or lost easily. Cloud storage may be more expensive, but 
your data will be in a remote location and accessible 
from anywhere at any time.
Many smartphones and other mobile devices include 
services that sync data to a computer or to a cloud ser-
vice. To sync data to a computer, the mobile device either 
requires cables to connect via a USB port or uses wire-
less methods, such as Wi-Fi or Bluetooth. Many mobile 
apps sync data to web apps automatically, which means 
you may not need to schedule a procedure to back up 
items on a mobile device, such as contacts, calendars, 
email messages, notes, and apps. For additional protec-
tion, however, some users still back up certain mobile 
data for easy retrieval if the device is lost or corrupted.

Ethics & Issues 8-4
How Much Data Should Companies 
Be Required to Keep?
More than a decade ago, after a string of 
corporate scandals, lawmakers enacted the 
Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) Act. SOX provides a 
myriad of financial reporting requirements 
and guidelines for publicly traded compa-
nies. A main focus of SOX is the retention of 
­business records. Because of SOX, companies 
have been confronted with massive new 
data storage requirements. For example, a 
company must retain all of its email mes-
sages just as it would other business records. 
Deleting stored email messages can result in a 
destruction of evidence infraction. Employees 
face penalties of up to 20 years in prison for 
altering or destroying records or documents. 
IT ­departments must not only understand 
this complex law, but they also must ensure 
­accuracy of financial data, determine ­policies 
for record retention, and provide storage 
capacity to hold all of the data.
Supporters of SOX state that it is essential 
to avoid corporate scandals caused by lack 
of accuracy in financial reporting. They also 
say that consumer confidence has increased 
because the financial statements are more 
transparent. Further, the financial costs 
for complying with SOX have decreased 
since companies have implemented 
plans. Opponents claim that the law is 
overreaching and costs too much for the 
added benefits. In addition, opponents 
blame the law for a decline in the number 
of IPOs (initial public offerings), as well 
as the transfer of several large companies 
to foreign countries. Recently, the U.S. 
government passed the Jumpstart Our 
Business Startup (JOBS) Act. Supported by 
technology companies, startup businesses, 
and venture capitalists, the JOBS Act aims 
to support smaller and emerging companies. 
By redefining the size of companies, as well 
as tiers of responsibilities related to SOX, 
supporters of the JOBS Act hope to help new 
businesses grow.
Consider This: Is the Sarbanes-Oxley Act 
an unfair burden on companies? Why or 
why not? Should the government distin-
guish between large and smaller com-
panies? Why or why not? Are such laws 
necessary in order to protect the public? 
Why or why not?

Automotive
The automotive industry plays a crucial 
role in today’s society. To keep up with our 
growing population’s increasing demand for 
transportation, organizations explore ways 
to streamline manufacturing processes in the 
automotive industry while simultaneously 
minimizing costs. These organizations often 
find that using technology in the manufactur-
ing process requires fewer people-hours, and 
automobiles are manufactured with greater 
accuracy and less waste.
Automakers manufacture cars on an assem-
bly line. In the early years of car manufactur-
ing, people were involved at all stages of the 
manufacturing process. It was not uncommon 
to find hundreds or thousands of individuals 
working along the line. Although the assembly 
line allowed individuals to manufacture cars 
as quickly as they could, companies soon 
realized that computer-aided manufacturing 
(CAM) would increase output and decrease 
labor costs. In fact, CAM proved to be most 
effective when used in conjunction with 
computer-aided design (CAD). CAD designs an 
item, such as a car, to manufacture; CAM then 
manufactures the car according to the original 
design. Computers also determine the exact 
amount of material necessary to build the car, 
as well as the expected output.
Communications during the assembly 
process is critical. Computers automatically 
communicate with each other along the 
assembly line and provide alerts when 
factors arise that can interrupt the process. 
For example, running out of hinges that 
attach the door to the car’s body will halt 
the line until someone replenishes the 
hinges. Computers, however, often alert 
individuals to low supplies before they 
run out and the assembly halts. Failure to 
detect the missing hinges might result in 
the machinery attempting to manufacture 
the car without hinges. This could result in 
damage to the door and/or the car’s body 
further along the assembly line.
Today, technology helps create quality 
automobiles efficiently. Although some 
might argue that computers perform jobs 
that people once held, their introduction has 
helped to meet society’s increased demand 
for products and desire for low prices.
  Consider This: How else might 
­computers and technology be used in the 
automotive industry?

Instructions: You often can complete tasks using technology in multiple ways. Figure out how to perform the tasks described in these exercises by 
using one or more resources available to you (such as a computer or mobile device, articles on the web or in print, online or program help, user guides, 
blogs, podcasts, videos, other individuals, trial and error, etc.). Summarize your ‘how to’ steps, along with the resource(s) used, in the format requested 
by your instructor (brief report, presentation, discussion, blog post, video, or other means).
1	 Determine Your Device’s Storage Capacity
It may be necessary to determine your device’s storage 
capacity before you decide to install a new operating 
system, program, or app, or if you want to transfer 
a large number of files to your computer or mobile 
device. For example, a new program you want to 
install may state that it requires a certain amount 
of storage capacity, so you should verify the storage 
capacity available on your device before deciding to 
purchase and install the program. One way to deter-
mine a device’s total storage capacity is to review the 
documentation or specifications that were included 
with your computer or mobile device. The following 
steps guide you through the process of determining 
your device’s storage capacity using other methods.
Computers
a. Open the window that shows the available storage 
devices on the computer.
b. Press and hold or right-click the drive for which 
you want to display the total storage capacity 
and then select the option to display the drive 
properties.
c. Navigate to the location showing the total storage 
capacity and available storage space.
or
a. Some operating systems allow you to hover your 
pointer over the icon representing the drive for 
which you want to determine the storage capacity, 
and the storage information will appear.
Mobile Devices
a. Display the device settings.
b. Navigate to the storage settings.
c. If necessary, navigate to the screen showing the 
total storage capacity and available storage space.
Exercises
1. What are other reasons why you might need 
to determine the total storage capacity or 
available storage space on your computer or 
mobile device?
2. Does the total storage capacity displayed on your 
computer or mobile device match the exact amount 
advertised when you purchased your computer 
or mobile device? If not, what might cause the 
discrepancy?
3. How much storage space is available on your computer 
or mobile device? What steps can you take if the 
storage on your device is almost completely used?
2	 Organize Files on a Storage Device Using Folders
Organizing the files on a storage device not only can 
improve your computer’s performance, but it also can 
make your files easy to locate. If you are accustomed 
to saving files to your desktop or to a folder on your 
storage device, you should consider organizing the 
files by storing them in appropriate folders. The fol-
lowing steps guide you through the process of using 
folders to organize files on a storage device.
a. Review the types of files you currently store on 
your device.
How To: Your Turn 
The How To: Your Turn exercises present general guidelines for fundamental skills 
when using a computer or mobile device and then require that you determine how to 
apply these general guidelines to a specific program or situation.

Chapter 8  Digital Storage
b. Current operating systems, such as Windows and 
Mac OS, include locations for storing different 
types of files, such as documents, music, video, 
and photos. Within these locations, however, you 
should create additional folders to further organize 
these file types. The method you use to organize 
each file type might vary.
1. Create folders to store your documents by the 
type of content they contain. For example, 
you might create separate folders to store 
files related to academics, finances, and 
entertainment. Then, consider whether you 
should create folders within these folders. For 
instance, you might create additional folders 
within the Academics folder to organize your 
files by subject.
2. Create folders to store your music by genre. 
Within each genre, create additional folders 
to sort your music by artist. If you have many 
songs for a particular artist, consider creating 
folders within the artist’s folder to store the 
songs by album.
3. Create folders to store your photos and videos 
either by date, event, or a combination of the 
two. For example, you could have a folder for 
a particular year, and then within that folder, 
create additional folders for all events that 
occurred within that year.
c. Although the desktop seems to be a convenient 
location to store files, it quickly can become 
cluttered. The only files you should store on 
the desktop are the ones you will need in the 
immediate future. If will not need a file again for at 
least several days, consider storing it in one of the 
folders mentioned previously.
d. Review the files on your storage device 
periodically and delete the ones you no longer 
need. Delete only the files you have placed on 
your storage device; be careful not to delete files 
that any programs or the operating system may 
need to run.
Exercises
1. Review the files and folders on your storage device. 
In your opinion, do you feel they are organized 
effectively? Why or why not?
2. How are the files and folders on your storage device 
organized?
3. When you take photos on a digital camera, the camera 
often generates a file name consisting of a generic 
prefix and sequential number. What are some ways 
to identify the photos easily on your digital camera’s 
memory card?

Copy Individual Files to Another Storage Device,  
and Copy Files to Cloud Storage
If you save a file on your computer or mobile device 
and later will need to access it on another device, 
you likely will have to copy the file to another stor-
age device or to the cloud so that you can access the 
file on the other device. The following steps guide 
you through the process of copying files to another 
­storage device or to the cloud.
Copying Files to Another Storage Device
a. Navigate to the location containing the file you 
want to copy. If the file is on an external storage 
device or memory card, connect the storage 
device to your computer or insert the memory 
card into your computer’s card reader. Next, 
navigate to the location containing the file you 
want to copy.
b. Navigate to the location to which you want to 
copy the file. If the location to which you want to 
copy the file is on an external storage device or 
on a memory card, connect the external storage 
device to your computer or insert the memory 
card into your computer’s card reader. Next, 
navigate to the location to which you want to 
copy the file.
c. Drag the file you want to copy to the destination 
location. After you drag the file, make sure the 
file exists both in the source and destination 
location.

Copying Files to the Cloud
a. If necessary, sign up for an account with an  
online service that can store your files. Some online 
services store only photos and videos, while other 
services store all types of files, such as documents 
and other media files.
b. Sign in to the online service and navigate to the 
page where you can upload files.
c. Tap or click the button or link to upload a file.
d. Navigate to and then tap or click the file you want 
to upload.
e. Tap or click the button or link to upload the file.
Exercises
1. What types of files might you want to copy to the 
cloud? Why would you copy files to the cloud instead 
of copying them to an external storage device?
2. What are at least three online services that allow you 
to store files? Are they free, or do they charge a fee? 
How much space do they provide? How do you obtain 
more storage space?
3. What steps would you take to copy a file from the 
cloud to your computer or mobile device?

Manage Space on a Storage Device
As you use your computer or mobile device, chances 
are that you are storing more files and installing addi-
tional programs and apps. At some point, you might 
require additional space or need to improve perfor-
mance on your storage device. While purchasing an 
additional storage device might seem like the best 
option, ways may be available to help you manage the 
space on your existing storage device so that an addi-
tional purchase is not necessary. The following steps 
guide you through the process of managing space on a 
storage device.
a. Review the files on your storage device and identify 
unused files you might be able to delete. Be careful 
not to remove files that the operating system, 
programs, or apps require to run properly.
b. View the list of programs and apps you have 
installed on your computer or mobile device. 
If you no longer need a program or app, 
uninstall it.
c. If you have files you may need in the future but 
not immediately, consider compressing them or 
copying them to an external storage device or to 
cloud storage. Verify the files have copied properly 
and then remove the files from your primary 
storage device.
d. If possible, defragment the storage device. If 
the storage device has not been defragmented 
recently, this process might improve performance 
significantly.
e. Search for and use any other tools that might be 
available in your operating system to maximize 
available space or improve performance. Note that 
some programs that claim to increase free space by 
compressing the files on your hard drive may slow 
your computer’s performance.
f. If the above options do not increase performance 
enough or create sufficient free space, you might 
need to purchase an additional storage device.
Exercises
1. What files on your storage device might you consider 
deleting to save space? Why?
2. Does your computer or mobile device contain any 
programs or apps that you no longer need? How can 
you uninstall programs and apps from your computer 
or mobile device?
3. How does defragmentation help increase performance 
on your computer?

Chapter 8  Digital Storage
1	 Making Use of the Web
Educational and Science
General reference websites, which include online 
encyclopedias, almanacs, and reference collections, 
are excellent sources of comprehensive, accurate, and 
organized facts on specific topics. For example, his-
tory and literary buffs can appreciate the websites 
that translate text, contain thousands of free books to 
download, and provide literary analyses. Among the 
more comprehensive websites are those sponsored by 
the American Library Association and the Library of 
Congress.
Answers to perplexing science questions and math 
problems are available on several educational web-
sites that include practice tests, conversion tables, and 
current news articles. Environmental websites seek to 
educate and often persuade citizens to become aware 
of issues. The information helps consumers to make 
environmentally responsible purchasing decisions and 
urges people to become involved in solving global 
environmental problems. Scientists’ research efforts 
­extend beyond investigating this planet to exploring  
the great frontier of space. Their science websites 
contain information about current studies, conferences, 
and breakthroughs in such areas as biology, earth and 
ocean sciences, physics, and chemistry.
Research This: (a) Visit a general reference website 
and locate any free resources that you can download 
to your computer or mobile device. What materi-
als are available to download? Which general topics 
are available? For which classes would you find the 
contents useful? Are you able to browse and search the 
collections? What types of current news articles are 
displayed? Are links to news stories or research articles 
shown? How often are they updated? Are previous 
stories archived so that you can research these events?
(b) Visit two environmental or science websites 
or apps, such as NASA, and browse their contents 
or download related apps. Which general topics are 
available for students? What types of current news 
articles are displayed? Are additional resources, such 
as videos and photos, available? Are online social 
network ­accounts listed to interact with scientists and 
­researchers?
2	 Social Media
Digital footprints tracking your Internet activity are 
relatively easy to find. Maintaining online anonymity 
is difficult to achieve once you have established online 
social network accounts with your actual name. While 
deleting an online social network account is a fairly 
easy process, deleting all remnants of information 
relating to the account can be a more difficult task. 
Just because you no longer can sign in to the account 
does not mean your posts, photos, and personal 
­information do not exist somewhere on a website.
If you desire to remove an Internet presence for 
security or personal reasons, begin by searching for your 
name or account user names. Remove your profiles from 
any online social network account that is displayed in the 
search results. Each of the online social network web-
sites has a process to close an account, generally through 
the account’s settings page. Next, contact the websites 
listed in the search results and ask that your name be 
removed. Many companies have a form to complete and 
submit. A third place to hunt for your information is 
on websites listing public records and people searches. 
Again, attempt to contact these companies and request 
that your personal information be removed. As a last 
resort, some services will perform these tasks for a fee.
Research This: Use a search engine to locate instances of 
your name or user names. Did the search results list these 
names? If so, which online social networks or companies 
have records of your name? Then, search for your name 
on at least two websites that have public records or people 
databases. Did you see your name on these websites? If 
so, do you want the details, such as a phone number or 
address, available for anyone to see? If not, attempt to 
remove this data and write a report of the steps you took 
and your success in deleting the personal information.
Instructions: Use a search engine or another search tool to locate the information requested or answers to questions presented in the exercises. 
Describe your findings, along with the search term(s) you used and your web source(s), in the format requested by your instructor (brief report, 
­presentation, discussion, blog post, video, or other means).

3	 Search Skills 
Image Search
An image search locates photos and images related to 
your search text or similar to other images. Tap or click 
the Images link on a search engine’s home page and 
then type the search text describing images you would 
like to find. For example, type the search text, solid 
state drive, to find photos of solid state drives. Search 
engines allow you to narrow your results by specifying 
additional conditions on the images found. These may 
include size (icon, wallpaper, or dimensions in pixels), 
color, time taken (past day, week, or month), type 
(photo, clip art, face, animation, or drawing), shape 
(wide, tall, square), usage rights (whether a photo may 
be reused, and under what conditions), and safe search. 
Safe search filters content inappropriate for minors.
Some search engines allow you to upload or specify 
the web address for an image, so that the search engine 
can locate images with similar features. Searching 
for similar images can be effective if the image is of a 
­well-known person, place, or object.
Image search results usually display an arrangement 
of thumbnail images; tap or click each thumbnail to 
see it in full size, download it, or obtain its web address 
from the browser’s address bar.
Research This: Create search text using the techniques 
described above or in previous Search Skills exercises 
and then type it in a search engine to find these images: 
(1) an RFID tag, exactly 400 x 400; (2) an external DVD 
drive, with a transparent background; (3) an internal 
hard drive, labeled for noncommercial reuse; (4) a 
person holding an SD card; and (5) images similar to a 
photo of a laptop computer (take a photo of a laptop and 
upload it). How successful was your image search?
Create a document containing each image, its web 
address, and the name or web address of the website on 
which it appears.
4	 Security
Permanently destroying files on storage media is 
recommended when donating or selling a computer. 
Federal laws have imposed strict requirements and pen-
alties for data security, particularly regarding health and 
insurance records and credit transactions. While proce-
dures exist to restore deleted files or erased media, often 
companies and individuals truly desire that the data 
never can be recovered. Sensitive medical and financial 
information, in particular, should be erased so that savvy 
criminals and digital forensics examiners cannot recover 
deleted files. The U.S. Department of Defense and the 
National Security Agency set standards for sanitizing 
magnetic media and specify that degaussing, or demag-
netizing, is the preferred method in lieu of permanently 
destroying the storage medium.
Research This: What types of degaussers are 
­available? How do they wipe a drive’s contents? How 
are Gauss and Oersted ratings applied? What length of 
time is required to degauss a drive? Some companies 
offer degaussing services. What procedures do they use 
to ensure secure practices?
5	 Cloud Services 
Cloud Backups (IaaS)
Backing up files to the cloud provides a systematic way for 
organizations and individuals to create off-site copies of 
their files. Backing up files to the cloud is an example of 
infrastructure as a service (IaaS), a service of cloud com-
puting which allows users to access and store files online.
Cloud backup providers offer continuous backup of 
new and changed files, transmitting them over a secure 
Internet connection. Like many cloud services, they 
offer a “pay as you go” pricing model, where customers 
subscribe to a service for a period, and pay for the fea-
tures or storage they use. Many cloud backup providers 
offer web and mobile apps to access and restore files.
Cloud backup services differ from cloud storage 
services. Cloud backup services offer the software and 
infrastructure to back up and restore files only. They 
generally do not support synchronizing files across 
devices or sharing files with many users, which are 
common features of cloud storage services.
Research This: (1) Use a search engine to find two 
­different cloud backup providers. Compare their pric-
ing plans, storage offered, file types backed up, security 
­features, and other services offered. (2) Why are cloud 
backup services attractive options for small to medium-
sized businesses? (3) When is it practical to use cloud 
backup services, and when is it practical to use cloud 
storage?

Critical Thinking
Instructions: Evaluate the situations below, using personal experiences and one or more resources available to you (such as articles on the web or in 
print, blogs, podcasts, videos, television, user guides, other individuals, electronics or computer stores, etc.). Perform the tasks requested in each 
­exercise and share your deliverables in the format requested by your instructor (brief report, presentation, discussion, blog post, video, or other means).
The Critical Thinking exercises challenge your assessment and decision-making skills by 
­presenting real-world situations associated with chapter concepts. The Collaboration 
­exercise should be completed with a team.
1.	Increasing Storage Capacity 
You are the office manager at a local boutique. The 
store needs to increase its storage capacity, and so 
decides to buy an external hard drive. Your boss asks 
you to research access times and storage capacities of 
various external hard drives.
Do This: Use the web to learn more about available 
hard drive options. What other factors should you 
evaluate when determining the appropriate hard drive 
to purchase? Analyze the advantages and disadvantages 
of using external hard drives for storage. Include in your 
discussion backup plans, costs, and alternate options. 
Recommend two hard drives to your boss. Include user 
reviews and any information by industry experts in 
your comparison between the two different hard drives. 
Which is the best option? Why? Compile your findings.
2.	NFC 
Your new smartphone includes NFC capabilities. You 
are curious about its uses but are concerned about 
potential risks. Before you enable NFC and install 
apps that can use this technology, you want to do some 
research.
Do This: Use the web to find and then list current 
and developing uses of NFC. If possible, find reviews 
or blog posts about these technologies. Describe any 
safety issues you found in your research. List ways 
you can protect yourself when using NFC technol-
ogy. Locate apps that can use NFC. For what purposes 
can you use this new technology? What ­disadvantages 
and risks exist? How can you avoid any negative 
­experiences and protect your data? Do any current 
laws govern or restrict the use of NFC for data col-
lection? What are they? Can you provide additional 
potential uses for NFC at home, school, or work?
3.	Case Study 
Amateur Sports League  You are the new manager 
for a nonprofit amateur soccer league. The board of 
directors has asked you to create a backup plan for the 
league’s computers and devices. The employees in the 
league office have access to multiple shared laptops, a 
desktop, and a tablet. Several employees use their own 
smartphones and tablets for work, according to the 
league office’s BYOD policy.
Do This: Use the web to find industry experts’ 
recommendations for backing up data. Write a sample 
backup plan and schedule for the board, and include 
types of backups you will use. Describe each backup 
type you propose and why you recommend it. Is 
any special software required to back up the differ-
ent devices? The board asked you to present reasons 
for using cloud storage as part of your backup plan. 
­Research the benefits of using cloud storage over 
other backup methods. Why would you choose cloud 
storage? What are the cost differences? Compare 
three cloud storage providers, ranking them by cost 
and storage capacity.
4.	Computers in Telemarketing  Your team is performing IT research for a ­magazine-subscription telemarketing 
company. The company’s 150 telemarketers must make a minimum of 100 calls a day. If telemarketers do not meet 
the minimum number, they must finish the calls from home. The company must decide 
on the type of storage device to provide the telemarketers so that they can take the 
necessary data home. Management has narrowed the choice to three storage options: 
rewritable optical discs, cloud storage, or USB flash drives.
Do This: Form a three-member team and assign an option to each member. Each team 
member should evaluate the advantages and disadvantages. Include features such as 
­capacity, access time, durability of media, ease of transporting between home and office, 
and cost. Meet with your team, and discuss and compile your findings. Which method 
would you recommend? Why? What are the advantages of each? Share your findings with the class.

Chapter 9  Operating Systems
Operating Systems
When you purchase a computer or mobile device, it usually has an operating system and other 
tools installed. As previously discussed, the operating system and related tools collectively are 
known as system software because they consist of the programs that control or maintain the 
operations of the computer and its devices. An operating system (OS) is a set of programs that 
coordinate all the activities among computer or mobile device hardware. Other tools, which 
were discussed in Chapter 4, enable you to perform maintenance-type tasks usually related to 
managing devices, media, and programs used by computers and mobile devices.
Most operating systems perform similar functions that include starting and shutting down a 
computer or mobile device, providing a user interface, managing programs, managing memory, 
coordinating tasks, configuring devices, monitoring performance, establishing an Internet 
connection, providing file management and other device or media-related tasks, and updating 
operating system software. Some operating systems also allow users to control a network and 
administer security (Figure 9-1).
Although an operating system often can run from a USB flash drive, media in an optical drive, 
or an external drive, in most cases, an operating system resides inside a computer or mobile 
device. For example, it is installed on a hard drive in a laptop or desktop. On mobile devices, the 
operating system may reside on firmware in the device. Firmware consists of ROM chips or flash 
memory chips that store permanent instructions.
Operating systems often are written to run on specific types of computers, based on their 
computing needs and capabilities. That is, servers do not run the same operating system as 
tablets or laptops because these computers perform different computing tasks. For example, a 
tablet or laptop operating system might have a feature to turn the device off after a few min-
utes of inactivity in order to conserve battery power. A server, by contrast, always is plugged in 
and generally remains on all of the time, which means its operating system would not need this 
power-saving feature. The same types of computers, such as laptops, may run different operating 
systems. It also is possible to run more than one operating system on the same computer.
After completing this chapter, you will be able to:
1	 Explain the purpose of an operating system
2	 Describe the start-up process and shutdown options on computers and mobile devices
3	 Explain how an operating system provides a user interface, manages programs, manages memory, 
and coordinates tasks
4	 Describe how an operating system enables users to configure devices, establish an Internet connection, 
and monitor performance
5	 Identify file management and other tools included with an operating system, along with ways to update 
operating system software
6	 Explain how an operating system enables users to control a network or administer security
7	 Summarize the features of several desktop operating systems: Windows, OS X, UNIX, Linux, and Chrome OS
8	 Briefly describe various server operating systems: Windows Server, OS X Server, UNIX, and Linux
9	 Summarize the features and uses of several mobile operating systems: Google Android, Apple iOS, 
and Windows Phone

Chapter 9  Operating Systems
When purchasing a program or an application, you must ensure that it works with the 
­operating system installed on your computer or mobile device. The operating system that a 
­computer uses sometimes is called the platform because applications are said to run “on top of” it, 
or because the platform supports the applications. With purchased applications, their specifica-
tions will identify the required platform(s), or the operating system(s), on which they will run. 
A cross-platform application is an application that runs the same way on multiple operating systems.
Operating System Functions
Every computer and mobile device has an operating system. Regardless of the type of the 
­computer or device, however, their operating systems provide many similar functions. The 
­following sections discuss functions common to most operating systems. These functions include 
starting and shutting down computers and mobile devices, providing a user interface, managing 
programs, managing memory, coordinating tasks, configuring devices, monitoring performance, 
establishing an Internet connection, updating operating system software, providing file and disk 
management tools, controlling a network, and administering security.
Starting Computers and Mobile Devices
If a computer or mobile device is off, you press a power 
button to turn it on (Figure 9-2). If it is on, you may need 
to restart (also called reboot) the computer or mobile device 
for a variety of reasons. For example, you might install a 
new program or app, update existing software, or experience 
network or Internet connectivity problems. Alternatively, 
you might notice that the performance of the computer 
or device is sluggish, or it may stop responding altogether. 
The method you use to restart a computer or device dif-
fers, depending on the situation and also the hardware. You 
may be able to use operating system instructions or press 
keys on the keyboard to restart the computer or device. Or, 
you might be required to respond to on-screen prompts. 
Sometimes, the computer or device restarts automatically.
When you start or restart a computer or mobile device, 
a series of messages may appear on the screen. The actual 
information displayed varies depending on the make and 
type of the computer or mobile device and the equip-
ment installed. The start-up process, however, is similar for large and small computers and 
mobile devices, as described in the following steps.
Step 1: When you turn on the computer or mobile device, the power supply or battery sends an 
electrical current to circuitry in the computer or mobile device.
Step 2: The charge of electricity causes the processor chip to reset itself and finds the firmware 
that contains start-up instructions.
Step 3: The start-up process executes a series of tests to check the various components. These 
tests vary depending on the type of computer or devices and can include checking the 
buses, system clock, adapter cards, RAM chips, mouse, keyboard, and drives. It also 
includes making sure that any peripheral devices are connected properly and operating 
correctly. If any problems are identified, the computer or device may beep, display error 
messages, or cease operating — depending on the severity of the problem.
Step 4: If the tests are successful, the kernel of the operating system and other frequently used 
instructions load from the computer or mobile device’s internal storage media to its 
memory (RAM). The kernel is the core of an operating system that manages memory 
and devices, maintains the internal clock, runs programs, and assigns the resources, such

as devices, programs, apps, data, and information. The kernel is memory resident, which 
means it remains in memory while the computer or mobile device is running. Other 
parts of the operating system are ­nonresident; that is, nonresident instructions remain on a 
storage medium until they are needed, at which time they transfer into memory (RAM).
Step 5: The operating system in memory takes control of the computer or mobile device and loads 
system configuration information. The operating system may verify that the person attempt-
ing to use the computer or mobile device is a legitimate user. Finally, the user interface 
appears on the screen, and any start-up applications, such as antivirus software, run.

What is meant by the phrase, booting a computer?
The process of starting or restarting a computer or mobile device is called booting. Some people use the term cold 
boot to refer to the process of starting a computer or mobile device from a state when it is powered off completely. 
Similarly, warm boot refers to the process of restarting a computer or mobile device while it remains powered on.
A warm boot generally is faster than a cold boot because it skips some of the operating system start-up instructions 
that are included as part of a cold boot. If you suspect a hardware problem, it is recommended that you use a cold 
boot to start a computer or device because this process detects and checks connected hardware devices. If a program 
or app stops working, a warm boot often is sufficient to restart the device because this process clears memory.
A boot drive is the drive from which your personal computer starts, which typically is an internal hard drive, 
such as a hard disk or SSD. Sometimes, an internal hard drive becomes damaged and the computer cannot boot 
from it, or you may want to preview another operating system without installing it. In these cases, you can start 
the computer from a boot disk, which is removable media, such as a CD or USB flash drive, that contains only the 
necessary operating system files required to start the computer.
When you purchase a computer, it may include recovery media in the form of a CD. If it does not, the operating 
system usually provides a means to create one. When the word, live, is used with a type of media, such as Live USB 
or Live CD, this usually means the media can be used to start the computer.

and mobile devices.
Shutting Down Computers and Mobile Devices
Some users choose to leave their computers or mobile devices running continually and rarely 
turn them off. Computers and devices that are left on always are available, and users often run 
back up or other similar programs while the computer or device is not being used. These users 
also do not need to wait for the boot process, which can be time consuming on older computers. 
Other users choose to shut down their computers and mobile devices regularly. These users might 
be concerned with security, want to reduce energy costs, or prefer to clear memory often. To turn 
off a computer or mobile device, you may be required to use operating system commands, press 
keyboard key(s), push a power button, or a combination of these methods. Read Secure IT 8-2 in 
Chapter 8 for tips on safely removing media before shutting down a computer or mobile device.
Power options include shutting down (powering off) the computer or mobile device, ­placing 
it in sleep mode, or placing it in hibernate mode. Both sleep mode and hibernate mode are 
designed to save time when you resume work on the computer or device. Sleep mode saves any 
open documents and running programs or apps to RAM, turns off all unneeded functions, and 
then places the computer in a low-power state. If, for some reason, power is removed from a 
computer or device that is in sleep mode, any unsaved work could be lost. Hibernate mode, by 
contrast, saves any open documents and running programs or apps to an internal hard drive 
before removing power from the computer or device.
The function of the power button on a computer or mobile device varies, and users typically 
are able to configure its default behavior. For example, you typically can place a computer or 
mobile device in sleep mode by quickly pressing its power button or closing its lid or cover (for 
example, on a laptop or a tablet). Pressing and holding down the power button may remove all 
power from the computer or mobile device.
BTW
Recovery Media 
In situations when a 
boot disk is required 
to restart a computer 
or device that will not 
start from its boot drive, 
the boot disk often is 
referred to as recovery 
media.

Chapter 9  Operating Systems
Providing a User Interface
You interact with an operating system through its user interface. That is, a user ­interface 
(UI) controls how you enter data and instructions and how information is displayed on 
the screen. Two types of operating system user interfaces are graphical and command line. 
Operating system user interfaces often use a combination of these techniques to define how a 
user interacts with a computer or mobile device.
Graphical User Interface  Most users today work with a graphical user interface. With a 
­graphical user interface (GUI), you interact with menus and visual images by touching, pointing, 
tapping, or clicking buttons and other objects to issue commands (Figure 9-3). Many current 
GUI operating systems incorporate features similar to those of a browser, such as links and 
­navigation buttons (i.e., Back button and Forward button) when navigating the computer or 
mobile device’s storage media to locate files.
A graphical user interface designed for touch input sometimes is called a touch user ­interface. 
Some operating systems for desktops and laptops and many operating systems for mobile 
devices have a touch user interface.

What is a natural user interface?
With a natural user interface (NUI), users interact with the software through ordinary, intuitive behavior. NUIs 
are implemented in a variety of ways: touch screens (touch input), gesture recognition (motion input), speech 
recognition (voice input), and virtual reality (simulations).
	
Command-Line Interface  To configure devices, manage system resources, automate system 
management tasks, and troubleshoot network connections, network administrators and other 
technical users work with a command-line interface. In a command-line interface, a user types 
commands represented by short keywords or abbreviations (such as dir to view a directory, or 
list of files) or presses special keys on the keyboard (such as function keys or key combinations) 
to enter data and instructions (Figure 9-4).

Some people consider command-line 
­interfaces difficult to use because they require 
exact spelling, form, and punctuation. Minor 
errors, such as a missing period, generate an 
error message. Command-line interfaces, how-
ever, give a user more control to manage detailed 
settings. When working with a command-line 
interface, the set of commands used to control 
actions is called the command language.
Managing Programs
How an operating system handles programs 
directly affects your productivity. An operating 
system can be single tasking or multitasking:
• A single tasking operating system allows only one program or app to run at a time. For 
example, if you are using a browser and want to check email messages, you must exit the 
browser before you can run the email program. Operating systems on embedded computers 
and some mobile devices use a single tasking operating system.
• Most operating systems today are multitasking. A multitasking operating system allows two or 
more programs or apps to reside in memory at the same time. Using the example just cited, if 
you are working with a multitasking operating system, you do not have to exit the browser to 
run the email program. Both programs can run concurrently.
When a computer is running multiple programs concurrently, one program is in the foreground 
and the others are in the background (Figure 9-5). The one in the foreground is the active program, 
that is, the one you currently are using. The other programs running but not in use are in the 
background. The foreground program typically is displayed on the screen, and the background pro-
grams are hidden partially or completely behind the foreground program. A multitasking operating 
system’s user interface easily allows you to switch between foreground and background programs.

spelling, form, and punctuation.

Chapter 9  Operating Systems
In addition to managing applications, an 
operating system manages other processes. 
These processes include programs or routines 
that provide support to other programs or 
hardware. Some are memory resident. Others 
run as they are required. Figure 9-6 shows a 
list of some processes running on a Windows 
computer; notice the list contains the applica-
tions running in Figure 9-5, as well as other 
programs and processes.
Some operating systems support a single 
user; others support thousands of users run-
ning multiple programs. A multiuser operating 
system enables two or more users to run pro-
grams simultaneously. Networks, servers, and 
supercomputers allow hundreds to thousands of 
users to connect at the same time and, thus, use 
multiuser operating systems.
Through the operating system, you also can 
install programs and apps, as well as remove 
them. For instructions on installing programs 
and apps, refer to How To 1-4 in Chapter 1. 
Read How To 9-1 for instructions on removing 
a program or app.

Remove a Program or App
If you are running low on space on your 
computer or mobile device, you may want 
to remove programs and apps you no 
­longer use. The following steps describe 
how to remove a program or app from your 
computer or mobile device:
1.	 Sign in to a user account that has 
administrative privileges; that is, the 
user account should have the capability 
to ­perform functions such as removing 
­programs or apps.
2.	 Make sure the program or app you want 
to remove is not running.
3.	 Display the list of programs or apps installed 
on your computer or mobile device.
4.	 Select the program or app you wish to 
remove.
5.	 Tap or click the button to remove the 
­program or app.
6.	 If necessary, when the installation is 
­complete, restart your computer or device.
7.	 Verify the program or app you removed 
no longer is on your computer or mobile 
device.

reasons why you might want to remove 
a program or app from your computer or

Managing Memory
The purpose of memory management is to optimize the use of a computer or device’s ­internal 
memory, i.e., RAM. As Chapter 6 discussed, RAM (random access memory) consists of one 
or more chips on the motherboard that hold items such as data and instructions while the 
­processor interprets and executes them. The operating system allocates, or assigns, data and 
instructions to an area of memory while they are being processed. Then, it carefully monitors 
the contents of memory. Finally, the operating system releases these items from being monitored 
in memory when the processor no longer requires them.

If several programs or apps are running simultaneously, your computer or mobile device may use 
up its available RAM. For example, assume an operating system requires 2 GB of RAM to run, an 
antivirus program — 256 MB, a browser — 512 MB, a productivity software suite — 1 GB, and a 
photo editing program — 512 MB. With all these programs running simultaneously, the total RAM 
required would be 4.352 GB (2048 MB 1 256 MB 1 512 MB 1 1024 MB 1 512 MB) (Figure 9-7). 
If the computer has only 4 GB of RAM, the operating system may have to use virtual memory in 
order to run all of the applications at the same time. When a computer or mobile device runs low 
on available RAM, this often results in the computer or mobile device running sluggishly.

With virtual memory, the operating system allocates a portion of a storage medium, such as 
a hard drive or a USB flash drive, to function as additional RAM (Figure 9-8). As you interact 
with a program, part of it may be in physical RAM, while the rest of the program is on the hard 
drive as virtual memory. Because virtual memory is slower than RAM, users may notice the 
computer slowing down while it uses virtual memory.

Chapter 9  Operating Systems
The area of the hard drive used for virtual memory is called a swap file because it swaps (exchanges) 
data, information, and instructions between memory and storage. A page is the amount of data and 
program instructions that can swap at a given time. The technique of ­swapping items between mem-
ory and storage, called paging, is a time-consuming process for the computer. When an operating sys-
tem spends much of its time paging, instead of executing ­application software, it is said to be thrashing.
Consider This
What happens if an application stops responding or the computer appears to run sluggishly?
If an application, such as a browser, has stopped responding, the operating system may be thrashing. When this 
occurs, try to exit the program. If that does not work, try a warm boot and then a cold boot. To help prevent future 
occurrences of thrashing, you might consider the following:
1.	 Remove unnecessary files and uninstall seldom used programs and apps. (Read How To 9-1 earlier in this 
­chapter for instructions about removing programs and apps.)
2.	 If your computer has a hard disk (instead of an SSD), try defragmenting the hard disk. (Read How To 8-1 in 
Chapter 8 for instructions about defragmenting a hard disk.)
3.	 Purchase and install additional RAM. (Read How To 6-3 in Chapter 6 for instructions about installing 
­memory modules.)
	
Consider This
What if my smartphone runs out of memory?
If your smartphone or other mobile device displays a message that it is running low on memory, try the following:
1.	 Exit unnecessary applications that are running.
2.	 Restart the smartphone or mobile device.
3.	 Uninstall seldom used applications. (Read How To 9-1 earlier in this chapter for instructions about removing 
programs and apps.)
4.	 Remove unnecessary files, including photos and videos (you may want to copy them to cloud storage, a 
­computer, or a memory card first).
5.	 If your smartphone supports the use of a memory card, specify that applications, photos, videos, or downloaded 
files should be saved on a memory card instead of the smartphone’s internal memory.
	
Coordinating Tasks
The operating system determines the order in which tasks are processed. A task, or job, is an 
operation the processor manages. Tasks include receiving data from an input device, processing 
instructions, sending information to an output device, and transferring items from storage to 
memory and from memory to storage.
Sometimes, a device already may be busy processing one task when it receives a request to 
perform a second task. For example, if a printer is printing a document when the ­operating 
­system sends it a request to print another document, the printer must store the second 
­document in memory until the first document has completed printing.
While waiting for devices to become idle, the operating system places items in buffers. 
A ­buffer is a segment of memory or storage in which items are placed while waiting to be 
­transferred from an input device or to an output device.
An operating system commonly uses buffers with printed documents. This process, called 
spooling, sends documents to be printed to a buffer instead of sending them immediately to the 
printer. If a printer does not have its own internal memory or if its memory is full, the operating 
system’s buffer holds the documents waiting to print while the printer prints from the buffer at 
its own rate of speed. By spooling documents to a buffer, the computer or mobile device’s pro-
cessor can continue interpreting and executing instructions while the printer prints. This allows 
users to perform other activities on the computer while a printer is printing. Multiple documents 
line up in a queue (pronounced Q) in the buffer. A program, called a print spooler, intercepts 
documents to be printed from the operating system and places them in the queue (Figure 9-9).
BTW
Higher-Priority Tasks
A multiuser operating 
system does not always 
process tasks on a first-
come, first-served basis. 
If a user or task has 
been assigned a higher 
priority than others by the 
network administrator, 
the operating system 
performs higher-priority 
tasks first. For example, 
an operating system on 
a corporate server may 
process tasks to check 
for incoming email 
more frequently than it 
processes tasks to access 
archived documents.

Configuring Devices
A driver, short for device driver, is a small program that tells the operating system how to 
communicate with a specific device. Each device connected to a computer, such as a mouse, 
keyboard, monitor, printer, card reader/writer, digital camera, webcam, portable media player, or 
smartphone, has its own specialized set of commands and, thus, requires its own specific driver. 
When you start a computer or connect a device via a USB port, the operating system loads the 
device’s driver. Drivers must be installed for each connected device in order for the device to 
function properly. Read How To 9-2 for instructions about finding the latest drivers for devices.
If you attach a new device, such as a portable media player or smartphone, to a computer, 
its driver must be installed before you can use the device. Today, most devices and operating 
systems support Plug and Play. As discussed in Chapter 6, Plug and Play means the operating 
system automatically configures new devices as you install or connect them. Specifically, it assists 
you in the device’s installation by loading the necessary drivers automatically from the device 
and checking for conflicts with other devices. With Plug and Play, a user plugs in a device and 
then immediately can begin using the device without having to configure it manually.

Find the Latest Drivers for Devices
Device manufacturers sometimes release 
updated driver versions either to correct 
problems with previous drivers, enhance a 
device’s functionality, or increase compat-
ibility with new operating system versions. 
The following steps describe how to find 
the latest drivers for devices:
1.	 Search for and navigate to the device 
manufacturer’s website.
2.	 Tap or click the link on the website to 
display the webpage containing technical 
support information.
3.	 Select or enter the device’s model number to 
display support information for the device.
4.	 Browse the device’s support information 
and then tap or click the link or button 
to download the most current driver. 
Manufacturers often create different 
­versions of drivers for different ­operating 
systems, so make sure you download 
the driver that is compatible with the 
­operating system you currently are using.
5.	 When the download is complete, follow 
the instructions that accompanied the 
driver to install it.
  Consider This: What might you do if 
you are unable to locate your device’s driver 
on the manufacturer’s website?

Monitoring Performance
Operating systems typically include a performance monitor. A performance monitor is a program 
that assesses and reports information about various computer resources and devices (Figure 9-10). 
For example, users can monitor the processor, drives, network, and ­memory usage.
The information in performance reports helps users and administrators identify a problem 
with resources so that they can try to resolve any issues. If a computer is running extremely slow, 
for example, the performance monitor may determine that the computer’s memory is being used 
to its maximum. Thus, you might consider installing additional memory in the computer.

band, and satellite. Some connections are configured automatically as soon as you connect to the 
Internet. With others, you may need to set up a connection manually (Figure 9-11).

Some operating systems also include a browser and an email program, enabling you to begin 
using the web and communicating with others as soon as you set up an Internet connection. 
Operating systems also sometimes include firewalls and other tools to protect computers and 
mobile devices from unauthorized intrusions and unwanted software. Read Ethics & Issues 9-1 
to consider whether operating systems should include antivirus and other programs.
Ethics & Issues 9-1
Should Manufacturers Include Extra 
Programs in Operating Systems for 
Computers and Mobile Devices?
OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) 
often include and profit from including 
extra programs installed with a computer or 
device’s operating system. These additional 
programs and apps, often called bloatware, 
mostly are harmless. Users object to their 
inclusion, however, because these programs 
and apps take up space, may slow start-up 
time, and can decrease the computer or 
device’s overall efficiency.
Bloatware can come in many forms: 
antivirus programs, games, productivity 
apps, and more. Some programs or apps 
cause nuisances for the user, such as those 
that display alarming messages about 
a computer’s virus protection and then 
offer more protection for additional costs. 
Programs that run when the operating 
system starts or run in the background cause 
unnecessary slowdowns. Websites exist that 
you can use to check your installed programs 
or apps against a list of those other users 
commonly have uninstalled, as well as 
the reasons for uninstalling. Independent 
computer programmers post fixes to remove 
bloatware. These fixes may or may not be 
legal, depending on your license agreement, 
and could violate any warranties for which 
you may be eligible.
Critics of this practice state that OEMs 
and operating system manufacturers 
should offer users the option to purchase a 
computer or device with a clean installation 
(without bloatware) of the operating system. 
A clean install may lead to an increased 
cost to make up for the lost revenue the 
manufacturer receives by including the extra 
programs or apps. Many say that charging 
more for a clean installation is unethical. 
Some recommend giving users the option 
to install the programs or apps that provide 
additional functionality as plug-ins or add-
ons. Open source software advocates state 
that these versions offer more options to 
avoid bloatware.
Consider This: Should OEMs be able to 
install programs and apps to run ­alongside 
capabilities built into a computer or mobile 
device’s operating system? Why or why 
not? Would you pay more for a clean 
­installation of your operating system? Why 
or why not?

Updating Operating System Software
Many programs, including operating systems, include an 
­automatic update feature that ­regularly provides new features 
or corrections to the program. That is, the operating system 
automatically checks to see if new updates are available, and if 
so, downloads them from the Internet and installs them on your 
computer. With an operating system, these updates can include 
­fixing program errors, improving program functionality, expanding 
program features, enhancing security, and modifying device drivers 
(Figure 9-12).

Chapter 9  Operating Systems
Many software makers provide free downloadable updates, ­sometimes called a service pack, to 
users who have registered and/or activated their software. With operating systems, the automatic 
update feature can be configured to alert users when an update is available or to download and 
install the update automatically. Users without an Internet connection usually can order the 
updates on an optical disc for a minimal shipping fee. Read Secure IT 9-1 for issues related to 
automatic updates.
Secure IT 9-1
Automatic Updates — Safe or Not?
Software updates often improve security and 
reliability, and they also may add signifi-
cant features that optimize the computer’s 
performance. In most cases, you have the 
choice either to allow the software to update 
automatically or to assess and then decide 
whether to install each update individu-
ally. Software manufacturers often recom-
mend you download and install all available 
updates when they become available.
The automatic update option occasionally 
has caused problems. In one case, people 
preparing their income tax returns were 
unable to print forms when a leading 
software company issued an automatic 
update one week before the filing deadline. 
In another situation, an automatic update 
was installed on all computers — even those 
with this feature disabled. The company 
claimed that the update was harmless 
and was for the benefit of its customers. 
Only later did some users realize that this 
secret update caused serious problems. One 
problem, ironically, was that updates no 
longer could be installed on the affected 
computers. Customers were furious about the 
issues, especially because the company made 
the changes without informing the computer 
owners. One consequence of the ensuing 
outrage was that many people turned off the 
automatic update feature, fearing that future 
updates might cause even more ­damage.
  Consider This: Is the automatic update 
feature enabled or disabled on your ­computer? 
Why? Should software companies be able 
to send automatic updates to your computer 
without your knowledge? Why or why not?
Providing File, Disk, and System Management Tools
Operating systems often provide users with a variety of tools related to managing a computer, 
its devices, or its ­programs. These file, disk, and system management tools were discussed 
in Chapter 4 and are summarized in Table 9-1. Read Secure IT 9-2 to learn more about an 
operating system’s built-in security tools.

Controlling a Network
Some operating systems are designed to work with a server on a network. These multiuser 
operating systems allow multiple users to share a printer, Internet access, files, and programs.
Some operating systems have network features built into them. In other cases, the ­operating 
system for the network is a set of programs that are separate from the operating system on 
the client computers or mobile devices that access the network. When not connected to the 
­network, the client computers use their own operating system. When connected to the network, 
the operating system on the network may assume some of the operating system functions on the 
­client computers or mobile devices.
The network administrator, the person overseeing network operations, uses the server ­operating 
system to add and remove users, computers, and other devices to and from the network. The 
network administrator also uses the operating system on the network to configure the network, 
install software, and administer network security.
Administering Security
Network administrators, as well as owners of 
­computers, typically have an administrator account that 
enables them to access all files and programs, install 
programs, and specify settings that affect all users on a 
computer, mobile device, or network. Settings include 
creating user accounts and establishing permissions. 
These permissions define who can access certain 
resources and when they can access those resources.
For each user, the network administrator or 
­computer owner establishes a user account. A user 
account enables a user to sign in to, or access 
resources on, a network or computer (Figure 9-13). 
Each user account typically consists of a user name 
and password. Recall that a user name, or user ID, is a 
unique combination of characters, such as letters of the 
alphabet and/or numbers, that identifies a specific user.
Secure IT 9-2
Using and Evaluating an Operating 
System’s Built-In Security Tools
Security software must run constantly to 
protect against new viruses and malware 
and spyware attacks. Operating systems can 
include the following security tools:
• Firewall: Security experts recommend 
­using a firewall and configuring it to turn 
on or off automatically.
• Automatic updating: Security updates 
are issued at least once daily, and other 
updates are generated on an as-needed 
basis. Many people enjoy the conven­
ience offered by allowing these fixes to 
install automatically instead of continu-
ally checking for new files to download. 
Users can view the update history to see 
when specific updates were installed. If an 
­update caused a problem to occur, a user 
can uninstall these new files.
• Antivirus software: Many ­operating 
systems include antivirus programs that are 
updated regularly. Some users mistakenly 
think they should install and run another 
antivirus program simultaneously for more 
protection. They should not run more 
than one antivirus program on a com-
puter because multiple programs might 
conflict with one another and slow overall 
­performance.
• Spyware and malware detection 
­software: Sophisticated malware and 
spyware threats are emerging at an 
unparalleled rate, so comprehensive 
spyware and malware detection software 
is ­mandatory to fend off attacks on the 
computer or device.
The operating system generally is 
scheduled to scan and update when the 
computer is idle, such as in the middle of the 
night. Overall, the security tools should run 
constantly and quietly in the background to 
ensure a safe computing experience.
  Consider This: Does your operating 
system have a firewall and protection against 
spyware and malware? Do updates occur 
automatically or manually? Which operating 
systems are more susceptible to malware 
attacks? Why?
Figure 9-13  Most multiuser operating systems allow each user to sign 
in, which is the process of entering a user name and a password into the 
computer. Single-user operating systems often use a password to lock an 
entire device or computer.

Chapter 9  Operating Systems
A password is a private combination of characters associated with the user name that allows 
access to certain computer, mobile device, or network resources. Some operating systems allow 
the network administrator to assign passwords to files and commands, restricting access to only 
authorized users. Mobile device owners often assign a password to the entire device, restrict-
ing all access until the correct password is entered. Read Secure IT 1-3 in Chapter 1 for tips on 
­creating strong passwords.
To prevent unauthorized users from accessing computer resources, keep your password 
­confidential. After entering a user name and/or password, the operating system compares the 
user’s entry with the authorized user name(s) and password(s). If the entry matches the user 
name and/or password stored in a file, the operating system grants the user access. If the entry 
does not match, the operating system denies access to the user.
The operating system on a network records successful and unsuccessful sign-in attempts in a 
file. This allows the network administrator to review who is using or attempting to use the com-
puter. The administrators also use these files to monitor computer usage. Read Ethics & Issues 9-2 
to consider who is responsible for operating system security flaws.
BTW
Passwords
While users type 
a password, most 
computers and mobile 
devices hide the actual 
password characters by 
displaying some other 
characters, such as 
asterisks (*) or dots.
Ethics & Issues 9-2
Should Operating System 
Manufacturers Be Liable for 
Breaches Due to Security Flaws?
If you purchase a household device with a 
warranty, you can hold the ­manufacturer 
responsible for replacing and fixing it. Some 
argue that the same product ­liability laws that 
protect consumers in other industries should 
apply to software. Users’ devices and data are 
vulnerable when security flaws exist in operat-
ing systems for computers and mobile devices. 
A flaw in an operating system can affect the 
performance of the computer or mobile device 
and subject data to corruption or unauthorized 
use. A user may not even be aware when a 
computer or mobile device is corrupted.
Hackers look for ways to break into a 
computer or mobile device using flaws in 
the operating system. An operating system 
is complex software that includes millions 
of lines of code. Developers write code as 
securely as possible, but with the volume 
of code, mistakes are bound to occur. Users 
sometimes are unaware of their own role 
in infecting their own computer or mobile 
device. Perhaps a hacker took advantage of a 
user with an unsecured Wi-Fi connection, or 
the user did not install or enable the latest 
updates to the operating system.
Some argue that making software 
manufacturers ­responsible for flaws will 
inhibit innovation. If a company spends 
more time looking for potential ­security 
flaws, it has less time to spend enhancing 
the software. In addition, some of the same 
features that enhance an operating system, 
such as web integration, increase the 
software’s vulnerability.
Consider This: Has your computer or 
mobile device become infected with 
malware due to a flaw in the operating 
system? How did you know? What respon-
sibility does a software manufacturer have 
for preventing and fixing operating system 
flaws? Should users expect their software 
to be perfect? Why or why not?
Consider This
What are some alternatives to passwords?
Many computers and mobile devices offer alternatives to setting and entering a password in order to gain access. 
Alternatives to passwords include specifying passcodes containing only numeric characters, swiping or touching 
areas of the screen in a specified order or pattern, or fingerprint or facial recognition.
	
Consider This
Do operating systems encrypt data and files?
To protect sensitive data and information further as it travels over a network, the operating system may encrypt 
it. Recall that encryption is the process of encoding data and information into an unreadable form. Administrators 
can specify that data be encrypted as it travels over a network to prevent unauthorized users from reading the 
data. When an authorized user attempts to read the data, it is automatically decrypted, or converted back into a 
readable form.

Types of Operating Systems
Many of the first operating systems were device dependent and proprietary. A device-­dependent 
program is one that runs only on a specific type or make of computer or mobile device. Proprietary 
software is privately owned and limited to a specific vendor or computer or device model. 
Some operating systems still are device dependent. The trend today, however, is toward device-­
independent operating systems that run on computers and mobile devices provided by a variety of 
manufacturers. The advantage of device-independent operating systems is you can retain existing 
applications and data files even if you change computer or mobile device models or vendors.
When you purchase a new computer or mobile device, it typically has an operating system 
preinstalled. As new versions of the operating system are released, users often upgrade their 
existing computers and mobile devices to incorporate features of the new versions. Some 
upgrades are free; some offer an upgrade price that is less than the cost of purchasing the entire 
operating system. Read Ethics & Issues 9-3 to consider when you should upgrade.

­operating systems.
Ethics & Issues 9-3
Should You Be an Early Adopter 
of a New Technology?
Consumers’ reactions to the release of a new 
device, program or app, or operating system 
fall into two camps: those who cannot wait, 
and those who exercise caution. Early adopters 
is the term given to users who sleep in line on 
the street outside a store in order to be one 
of the first to own a new device, or those who 
stay up until midnight to start the download of 
a program or app the moment it is released.
Some early adopters of new technology 
do so for the same reasons one might 
purchase a new item of clothing — to 
make a statement. Others do so out of 
curiosity, or for a desire to Tweet, blog, or 
post on social media his or her experiences. 
Manufacturers and developers rely on early 
adopters to provide valuable feedback and 
insight into the user experience, as well as 
to help generate excitement. In some cases, 
early adopters receive additional customer 
assistance in exchange for feedback. As 
one manufacturer said, the more people 
who initially use the product, the better the 
resulting product will be.
Critics of early adoption cite security risks 
and usability issues that may be uncovered. 
Many feel that waiting until the initial reviews, 
and subsequent patches or updated releases, 
are available is prudent. Others are concerned 
with compatibility issues between syncing the 
new technology with the user’s current devices, 
data, or apps. Another factor in waiting is 
that the price of the new technology often 
drops within a few months of its release. 
Early adopters may have paid more for a less 
satisfying experience than those who wait.
Consider This: Have you ever been an 
early adopter of a new technology? What 
was your experience? Will you be an early 
adopter in the future? Why or why not? 
Should manufacturers give benefits to early 
adopters? Why or why not?
New versions of an operating system ­usually 
are backward compatible, which means they 
­recognize and work with applications written 
for an earlier version of the operating system 
(or platform). The application, by contrast, 
may or may not be upward compatible, meaning 
it may or may not run on new versions of the 
operating system.
The three basic categories of operating 
systems on computers and mobile devices are 
desktop, server, and mobile. Table 9-2 lists 
­examples in each of these categories, which 
are discussed on the ­following pages.

Desktop Operating Systems
A desktop operating system, sometimes called a stand-alone operating ­system, is a complete 
operating system that works on desktops, laptops, and some tablets. Desktop operating systems 
sometimes are called client ­operating systems because they also work in conjunction with a server 
operating system. Client operating systems can operate with or without a network.
Examples of the more widely used desktop operating systems are Windows, Mac OS, UNIX, 
Linux, and Chrome OS.
Windows/Mini Feature 9-1
In the mid-1980s, Microsoft developed its first version of Windows, which provided a

Unix
UNIX (pronounced YOU-nix) is a multitasking operating system developed in the early 
1970s by scientists at Bell Laboratories. Bell Labs (a subsidiary of AT&T) was prohibited from 
actively promoting UNIX in the commercial marketplace because of federal regulations. Bell 
Labs instead licensed UNIX for a low fee to numerous colleges and universities, where UNIX 
obtained a wide following. UNIX was implemented on many different types of computers. In 
the 1980s, the source code for UNIX was licensed to many hardware and software companies to 
customize for their devices and applications. As a result, several versions of this operating system 
exist, each with slightly different features or capabilities.
Today, a version of UNIX is available for most computers of all sizes. Although some versions 
of UNIX have a command-line interface, most versions of UNIX offer a graphical user interface 
(Figure 9-14). Power users often work with UNIX because of its flexibility and capabilities. An 
industry standards organization, The Open Group, now owns UNIX as a trademark.
BTW
OS X
OS X is a UNIX-based 
operating system.
Linux
Linux (pronounced LINN-uks), introduced in 1991, is a popular, multitasking UNIX-based 
operating system that runs on a variety of personal computers, servers, and devices. In addition 
to the basic operating system, Linux also includes many free tools and programming languages.
Linux is not proprietary software like the operating systems discussed thus far. Instead, Linux 
is open source software, which means its code is provided for use, modification, and redistribution. 
Many programmers have donated time to modify and redistribute Linux to make it the most 
popular UNIX-based operating system.

Why use open source software?
Open source software has no restrictions from the copyright holder regarding modification of the software’s internal 
instructions and redistribution of the software. Promoters of open source software state two main advantages: users 
who modify the software share their improvements with others, and customers can personalize the software to 
meet their needs. Read Secure IT 9-3 to consider security issues associated with open and closed source programs.

Chapter 9  Operating Systems
Linux is available in a variety of forms, known as 
distributions. Some distributions of Linux are com-
mand line. Others are GUI (Figure 9-15). Some 
companies market software that runs on their own 
distribution of Linux. Many application programs, 
tools, and plug-ins have Linux ­distributions.
Users obtain versions of Linux in a variety of ways. 
Some download it free from a provider’s website and 
create media to install it on a computer, or they cre-
ate a Live CD or Live USB from which to preview it. 
Others purchase optical discs from vendors who may 
bundle their own software with the operating system 
or download it from their websites. Some retailers 
will preinstall Linux on a new computer on request.

CDs/Live USBs.
Chrome Os
Chrome OS, introduced by Google, is a Linux-based operating system designed to work 
­primarily with web apps (Figure 9-16). Apps are available through the Chrome Web Store, 
and data is stored on Google Drive. The only apps typically installed on the computer are the 
Chrome browser, a media player, and a file manager. A specialized laptop that runs Chrome OS 
is called a Chromebook, and a specialized desktop that runs Chrome OS is called a Chromebox. 
Chromebooks and Chromeboxes typically use SSDs for internal storage. Users also can run 
Chrome OS as a virtual machine (which is discussed in the next section).
Because computers running Chrome OS work mostly with web apps, they do not require 
as much internal storage capacity as other desktop operating systems discussed in this section. 
Their start-up and shutdown time also is considerably less than other desktop operating systems 
because Chrome OS uses a streamlined start-up procedure.

Secure IT 9-3
Open Source or Closed Source — Which 
Is More Secure?
Supporters of open source software maintain 
that this operating system enables develop-
ers to create high-quality programs. Source 
code, along with any changes, remains pub-
lic, so communities of open source program-
mers can examine, correct, and enhance 
programs. They also can make changes 
immediately when security issues arise.
Many proponents of open source software 
use Linux, which is known for its speed and 
stability. Of the 500 fastest supercomputers, 
more than 90 percent use variants of Linux. 
Many of these computers perform high-
performance tasks, including detecting and 
preventing fraud. Companies and nonprofit 
organizations can distribute and sell their 
versions of Linux, which enables those 
without the expertise to modify open source 
software and to benefit from the creative 
efforts of the Linux community.
Developers of closed source operating 
systems, on the other hand, refuse to share 
some or all of the code. They believe that 
companies and developers should be able 
to control, and profit from, the operating 
systems they create. Their philosophy may 
hinder third-party software developers 
who create programs and apps for the 
operating system.
Fear of viruses and other security concerns 
can lead some to question about whether 
open source software is worthwhile. While 
dishonest and anonymous developers can use 
open source software to create programs that 
may be or may include malware, cryptography 
experts emphasize that Linux systems have 
fewer reported security exposures than 
Windows-based systems. In general, Linux 
systems do not run antivirus software, but 
they do use detection programs that check for 
signs of attacks and probes.
  Consider This: Are the security concerns 
about open source software legitimate? Why 
or why not? Why is antivirus software not 
needed on Linux-based systems? Does the 
open source model lead to higher-quality 
software? Why or why not?

Running Multiple Desktop Operating Systems
If you want to run multiple operating systems on the same computer, you could partition the 
hard drive or you could create a virtual machine. Partitioning divides a hard drive in separate 
logical storage areas (partitions) that appear as distinct drives. When you partition a drive, you 
can install a separate operating system in each partition, sometimes called a dual boot. Because 
partitioning requires advanced skills, users often opt to create a virtual machine instead. A virtual 
machine (VM) is an environment on a computer in which you can install and run an operating 
system and programs. VMs enable you to install a second operating system on a computer. Read 
How To 9-3 for instructions about creating a virtual machine. Another option for Mac users 
who want to run Windows programs is a program called Boot Camp. Read How To 9-4 for 
instructions about installing the Windows operating system on a Mac computer.

Set Up and Use a Virtual Machine
A virtual machine enables a computer to run 
another operating system in addition to the 
one installed. Various reasons exist for using a 
virtual machine. For example, if you are running 
the latest version of Windows on a computer 
but require an app that runs only in a previ-
ous version of Windows, you might set up a 
virtual machine running the previous version of 
Windows so that you can run the desired app. 
The computer still will have the latest version of 
Windows installed, but you easily will be able to 
switch to the previous version when necessary.
To set up a virtual machine, you will need 
the required software, as well as installation 
media for the operating system you want to 
install in the virtual machine. The following 
steps describe how to set up a virtual machine:
1.	 Obtain and install an app that creates and 
runs virtual machines.
2.	 Run the app and select the option to 
­create a new virtual machine.
3.	 Specify the settings for the new virtual 
machine.
4.	 If necessary, insert the installation media 
for the operating system you want to run 
in the virtual machine.
5.	 Run the virtual machine. Follow the steps 
to install the operating system in the 
­virtual machine.
6.	 When the operating system has finished 
installing, remove the installation media.
7.	 While the virtual machine is running, if 
desired, install any apps you want to run.
8.	 When you are finished using the ­virtual 
machine, shut down the operating 
­system in the same manner you would 
shut down your computer.
9.	 Exit the virtual machine software.
After you set up the virtual machine, you 
can use the virtual machine any time by 
performing the following steps:
1.	 Run the virtual machine software.
2.	 Select the virtual machine you want to run.
3.	 Tap or click the button to run the virtual 
machine.
4.	 When you are finished using the virtual 
machine, shut down the operating system 
similar to how you would shut down your 
computer.
5.	 Exit the virtual machine software.
  Consider This: What are some other 
reasons that might require you to set up and 
use a virtual machine on a computer?

Chapter 9  Operating Systems
Server Operating Systems
A server operating system is a multiuser operating system that organizes and coordinates how 
multiple users access and share resources on a network. Client computers on a network rely on 
server(s) for access to resources.
Many of the desktop operating systems discussed in the previous section function as clients 
and work in conjunction with a server operating system. Although desktop operating systems 
may include networking capability, server operating systems are designed specifically to sup-
port all sizes of networks, including medium- to large-sized businesses and web servers. Server 
operating systems can handle high numbers of transactions, support large-scale messaging and 
­communications, and have enhanced security and backup capabilities.
Many also support virtualization. Recall that virtualization is the practice of sharing or ­pooling 
computing resources, such as servers or storage devices. Through virtualization, for example, 
server operating systems can separate a physical server into several virtual servers. Each virtual 
server then can perform independent, separate functions.
Examples of server operating systems include the following:
• Windows Server: Developed by Microsoft, Windows Server enables organizations to manage 
applications and websites on-site and/or on the cloud.
• OS X Server: Developed by Apple, OS X Server enables organizations to collaborate, share 
files, host websites and mail servers, and more on Mac computers and iOS devices.
Use Boot Camp to Install the Windows 
Operating System on a Mac
If you are using an Apple computer, such 
as an iMac or MacBook Pro, you may 
encounter instances where you need to 
run apps in the Windows operating system. 
Newer versions of Mac OS enable you to 
install Windows on a computer using a 
program called Boot Camp. The following 
steps describe how to use Boot Camp to 
install the Windows operating system on 
a Mac:
1.	 Obtain the installation media for the 
­version of Windows you want to install.
2.	 Use the operating system’s search ­feature 
to locate the Boot Camp Assistant 
­application. (Hint: Use the search text, 
boot camp.)
3.	 Click the search result for the Boot Camp 
Assistant application.
4.	 When the Boot Camp Assistant runs, 
read the introduction and then click the 
Continue button.
5.	 Next, you create a partition, which is a 
section of storage or memory reserved 
for a specific program or application. 
Partitions enable a single drive to be 
treated as multiple drives. Follow the 
remaining steps to create a Windows 
­partition and install Windows:
a.  Specify the amount of disk space to use 
for the Windows partition. The partition 
should be large enough to store all 
operating system files, apps you want 
to run in Windows, and any files you 
want to store using Windows.
b.  Complete the steps described in the 
Windows installation process.
6.  When the installation is complete and 
Windows starts, if necessary, enter your 
user name and password to sign in to 
Windows.
If you want to switch between Mac OS 
and Windows, press and hold the option 
key on the keyboard while turning on or 
restarting the computer. When the list of 
operating systems is displayed, select the 
operating system you want to run.
  Consider This: What apps might 
­someone want to run in Windows that are 
unavailable in Mac OS? How does Boot 
Camp differ from a virtual machine?

Ethics & Issues 9-4
Should Text Messages Sent by 
Employees Be Private?
When an employer asks a worker to disclose 
work-related text messages, is the employee 
legally required to reveal all messages, even per-
sonal ones? Is the employer liable for ­damages 
caused by inappropriate messages sent by an 
employee?
Many companies provide employees with 
mobile devices, such as smartphones, for work 
communications. Employers typically create 
acceptable use policies. These policies address 
ownership of electronic communications, 
including email messages, voice mail messages, 
and text messages. Regardless of the policy, 
employees may believe they have the rights of 
privacy and self-expression when they use a 
company-issued mobile device for personal use. 
The issue is complicated further when companies 
employ BYOD (bring your own device) policies. 
When an employee uses a personal device for 
business-related communications, it is unclear 
who owns the communications, and who takes 
responsibility for any misuse. Read Secure IT 9-4 
for security issues associated with BYOD.
The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that an 
employer can read workers’ text messages on 
company-owned devices if the employer has 
reason to believe the text messages violate 
workplace rules. The Court held that employees 
can purchase their own mobile devices for 
personal use. Critics state that employees have 
a reasonable expectation of privacy. Supporters 
of the decision argue that employers own 
the devices because they provide the devices 
and pay for the service for the employee. They 
claim, therefore, that employers have a right to 
view the content of all text messages.
Consider This: Should text messages sent 
by employees be private? Why or why not? 
How can employers impose policies ­regarding 
text messages sent on company-issued 
mobile devices? Should employers be able to 
access work-related ­communications on an 
employee-owned device? Why or why not?
Secure IT 9-4
BYOD Security Issues
Effective BYOD (bring your own device) ­policies 
can lead to many benefits for businesses, but 
they also give rise to many issues that affect 
information security and data protection. 
When employees bring their smartphones, 
tablets, and laptops into the workplaces, the 
companies surrender much control over this 
hardware compared to devices they own.
One of the biggest problems is that 
employees can carry their devices everywhere 
outside of work. If these devices are lost or 
stolen, the company’s sensitive information can 
land in the hands of criminals. Many of these 
allegedly lost devices are sold on online auctions 
and other services websites, even if the original 
owners have wiped their devices remotely.
Companies need to educate employees 
on mobile device management (MDM). One 
point they need employees to know is that 
phishing scams abound in email messages, 
text messages, Facebook posts, and Tweets. 
Other security measures to emphasize are the 
need to use strong passwords, to not reveal 
these passwords to other employees, and to 
avoid apps that collect information about 
the user, especially those that monitor the 
employee’s location and shopping habits.
BYOD policies should be developed that 
address technical, legal, and human resources 
issues. The language in these policies should 
cover these topics:
• Ensuring that work data will not be merged 
with the employee’s personal data
• Requiring that nonemployees, such as 
­family members who use the device, will 
not access work data
• Following procedures when an employee 
resigns or is terminated
• Alerting management immediately when 
the device is lost or stolen
  Consider This: Do you or people you 
know work at a business that allow employees 
to bring their own devices to work? If so, do 
these businesses have a BYOD policy? If so, 
how were the policy’s terms communicated? 
For example, were they explained verbally and 
available in written form?

Mobile versus Desktop 
Operating Systems
An operating system has the same role, whether for 
a desktop or mobile device. It manages operations 
and provides a user interface. Because of this shared 
role, many similarities exist between the functions of 
desktop and mobile operating systems. From a user’s 
perspective, operating systems enable you to work with 
apps and to monitor and maintain the functions of the 
computer or device. Typical functions included in mobile 
operating systems include the following:
• Main areas, such as a desktop or home screen, 
­enable you to access and organize apps
• Methods to return to the main area quickly
• The ability to organize the app icons or tiles in the 
main areas easily by moving them to pages or folders 
or by adding them to menus
• System tools, such as to manage battery power and 
Internet connections
• Options for security settings
Whether you are purchasing a computer or mobile 
device, the choice of an operating system plays an 
important role.
Historically, the two types of operating systems 
have had different uses and capabilities. The 
differences are due in part to the disparity in screen 
size, keyboards, and processing power. Because of 
convergence, as well as the increased reliance on 
mobile devices for communications and productivity, 
the use and function of mobile and desktop operating 
systems are becoming more similar. The prevalence 
of web apps and cloud storage services enables 
users to access the same programs and files they 
work with on their desktop from a mobile device. 
Some developers now create operating systems that 
share code and have common features, regardless of 
whether they are installed on a computer or mobile 
device. Features, such as tiles and icons (typically used 
in mobile devices), make the transition between using 
a mobile device and computer easier. For example, 
mobile device operating systems include capabilities 
that allow users to take advantage of the touch 
screen displays. As more computer desktop monitors 
today are touch enabled, computer users can take 
advantage of this feature. 
Many differences exist in the way a user interacts 
with a mobile operating system.

Meteorology
With the television tuned to the local weather 
station, you anxiously are awaiting to see 
the projected path of a hurricane in the 
tropics. Having experienced hurricanes in 
the past, you rely heavily on the accuracy of 
weather forecasts so that you can prepare 
adequately if a storm travels through the 
area. Technology allows meteorologists to 
better estimate the severity and path of 
storms, enabling people to make potentially 
life-saving preparations.
The National Hurricane Center uses 
powerful computers to generate multiple 
computer models to determine a storm’s 
path. These models consider factors such as 
the storm’s current strength, the effects of 
nearby weather systems, the storm’s central 
pressure, and whether the storm may travel 
over land. These models also may consider 
previous storms that traveled a similar path. 
While these models are not 100 percent 
accurate, they do ensure that everyone who 
may be affected by the storm has enough 
time to prepare.
Violent, rotating thunderstorms potentially 
can spawn tornadoes, which sometimes 
cause catastrophic damage. For this reason, 
it is important for everyone to watch 
or listen closely to the weather during 
the storm. Meteorologists can monitor 
weather systems on multiple radars and 
send additional severe weather warnings 
automatically to weather radios and apps. 
Technology enables these messages to be 
broadcast automatically to weather radios 
and apps only in areas that may be affected.
In addition to computers helping us stay 
safe during severe storms, they also assist 
with day-to-day weather forecasting. Several 
years ago, meteorologists could predict 
the weather for only a few days into the 
future. Beyond that point, the forecast was 
very uncertain. Meteorologists presently 
are able to predict the weather, including 
temperature and chance of precipitation, 
one week or more into the future with 
much greater accuracy because computers 
create models using historical weather data 
and behavior to predict the future path of 
various weather systems.
News and weather stations have weather 
apps and also post their weather forecasts 
online. In fact, several websites have 
interactive radars that allow visitors to zoom 
in and view how weather is affecting their 
immediate neighborhood.
The meteorology field has made 
significant advancements because of 
computer technologies. Weather forecasts 
are more accurate, which not only helps us 
prepare on land, but also helps to protect 
those traveling by air or by sea.
  Consider This: In what other ways do 
computers and technology play a role in the 
meteorology field?

Determine Your Operating System Version
Companies such as Microsoft, Apple, and Google release 
new versions of operating systems periodically. Software 
and drivers sometimes are designed for specific oper-
ating system versions, which means you may need to 
determine your operating system version so that you can 
obtain the proper software. The following steps describe 
how to determine your operating system version.
a. If necessary, turn on your computer or mobile device 
and, if necessary, sign in to the operating system. 
Some operating systems will display the version 
when they run. If the operating system version is not 
displayed, continue following these steps.
b. If you are using a Mac computer, click the command 
on the Apple menu to display information about 
the computer to determine the operating system 
version. If you are running an operating system 
other than Mac OS, continue following these steps.
c. Display the control panel or settings for your 
computer or mobile device.
d. Navigate to and then tap or click the command to 
display system information about the computer or 
device, and then locate the operating system version.
Exercises
 1. What operating system are you running?
 2. What are some other reasons why you might need to 
know the operating system version on your computer 
or mobile device?
 3. What might happen if you attempt to install a program or 
app that is not designed for your operating system version?
2	 Search for Files on a Computer
Advances in technology enable users to store a large 
number of files, such as documents, photos, videos, 
and music, on their computers. Users store contacts, 
appointments, email messages, and other informa-
tion on mobile devices to retrieve at a later time. With 
all the information you can store on computers and 
mobile devices, it sometimes can be difficult to locate 
an item you need to access. Today’s operating systems 
contain a search tool that provides an easy way to 
locate files stored on a computer or mobile device. To 
search for an item on a computer or mobile device, you 
should know information about the item for which you 
are searching. The following steps guide you through 
the process of searching a computer or mobile device.
a. If necessary, run the search tool on your computer 
or mobile device. If you are using a mobile device, 
such as a smartphone or tablet, you may be able to 
access the search tool by pressing a search button 
on the phone or tablet.
Instructions: You often can complete tasks using technology in multiple ways. Figure out how to perform the tasks described in these exercises 
by using one or more resources available to you (such as a computer or mobile device, articles on the web or in print, online or program help, user 
guides, blogs, podcasts, videos, other individuals, trial and error, etc.). Summarize your ‘how to’ steps, along with the resource(s) used, in the format 
requested by your instructor (brief report, presentation, discussion, blog post, video, or other means).
How To: Your Turn 
The How To: Your Turn exercises present general guidelines for fundamental skills 
when using a computer or mobile device and then require that you determine how to 
apply these general guidelines to a specific program or situation.

3	 Personalize Your Operating 
Environment
When you purchase a new computer 
or mobile device, the first task you 
might want to complete is to per-
sonalize the operating environment 
to suit your tastes. For example, you 
might want to have your favorite 
sports team’s logo as your desktop 
background, a screen saver consist-
ing of a slide show containing photos 
of your recent vacation, or specific 
sounds that play when certain events 
occur. The following steps guide you 
through the process of personalizing 
your operating environment.

4	 Configure Accessibility Settings
Many modern operating systems allow users to 
­configure accessibility settings to make it easier for 
some individuals to interact with them. Accessibility 
features can perform functions such as enhancing 
the contrast between colors on the display device, 
­narrating text that is displayed on the screen, and 
­allowing the user to control the pointer using keys on

features for accessibility?
3. Do you feel that the accessibility features in your 
computer or mobile device’s operating system are 
sufficient? Why or why not?
5	 Add Users to an Operating System
If you share your computer with others, you can add 
more user accounts to the operating system. When 
users sign in to their accounts, they can customize 
their settings and store files in locations that may not 
be accessible to other users on the computer. The 
­following steps guide you through the process of 
­adding users to an operating system.

­privileges; that is the user account should have the 
­capability to perform functions such as adding users.
b.  Display the operating system settings.
c.  Tap or click the option to display user accounts.
d.  Tap or click the option to add a new user account.
e.  Specify the options for the new user account:
• Enter a name to identify the user account.
• Specify a default password for the user account.
• Select the type of user account (administrative, 
standard, etc.). You should create user accounts 
with administrative access only if you want the 
user to be able to perform tasks such as change 
computer settings; add or remove programs and 
apps; and add, modify, or remove a user account.
• If necessary, set parental controls for the user 
account.
f. Save the settings for the new user account.
g. Sign out of the existing user account.
h. Sign in to the newly created user account and make 
sure everything works as intended.
Exercises
1. Do you have multiple user accounts on your 
computer? Why or why not?
2. Do you think it is a good idea for students in a school 
computer lab to have administrative access to the 
computers? Why or why not?
3. What types of parental controls can you enable using 
your operating system? Do you think these controls 
are relevant only to parents, or can you determine 
other people who might benefit from using parental 
controls? What parental controls might those other 
people use, and why?

Making Use of the Web 
Banking and Finance
Managing money and making wise investments and 
are among the most important skills consumers need 
to master. Abundant advice is available on a variety of 
banking and financial websites. More than 80 percent 
of Americans who manage household finances have 
enrolled in online banking programs, and 20 percent 
have used a banking app on their smartphones or 
mobile devices. Whether their financial institutions 
are a retail bank, a virtual bank, or a credit union, they 
enjoy the convenience of monitoring account bal-
ances, depositing checks, transferring funds, receiving 
text message alerts, and paying bills.
Personal finance websites provide information on 
portfolio management, tax preparation, real estate 
­investing, mortgage rates, retirement planning, credit 
card and student loan advice, and a host of other lifestyle 
and educational topics. Also available are calculators to 
help make saving, spending, and real estate ­decisions. 
Business finance websites include market data, company 
earnings, interest rates, and corporate news.
Research This: (a) Visit two online banking 
websites: one for a financial institution that has a 
physical presence in your community and another 
that is virtual. Compare the services and featured 
products. For ­example, do they offer bill payment, 
retirement accounts, and mobile banking apps? 
What fees are charged for these services? Which 
bank has the highest money market and certificate 
of deposit rates?
(b) Visit two financial websites, such as Yahoo! 
Finance, that feature information about managing 
personal credit and debt. Read two stories discuss-
ing student loans, credit card debt, overspending, or 
retirement planning. According to these articles, what 
mistakes do people make managing their money? 
Who are the economic professionals writing or being 
quoted in the articles? What advice is given that can 
help you handle your expenses?

Social Media
Operating systems constantly evolve as developers 
add new features, fix security issues, and modify func-
tions. Computer and mobile device users need to stay 
abreast of these changes, especially when the updates 
affect performance and safety. Many blogs feature 
content about operating systems. Their posts cover 
industry news, photos, product reviews, previews of 
forthcoming software and hardware, and management 
changes. Most of these blogs are unofficial, meaning 
that the writers are not necessarily employees of the 
companies that develop the operating systems. The 
bloggers generally have extensive 
experience in the technology field 
and desire to share their expertise 
with others.
Research This: Search online 
for a blog that tracks ­features or 
updates to a mobile, desktop, or 
other operating system that you 
use or about which you would like 
more information. Report the web 
address of the blog, along with 
a summary of the most recent 
blog post.
Instructions: Use a search engine or another search tool to locate the information requested or answers to questions presented in the exercises. 
Describe your findings, along with the search term(s) you used and your web source(s), in the format requested by your instructor (brief report, 
presentation, discussion, blog post, video, or other means).
 Internet Research
The Internet Research exercises broaden your understanding of chapter concepts by 
requiring that you search for information on the web.

Search Skills 
Video, Audio, and Voice Search
A video search allows you to locate video files posted 
or shared online. Tap or click the Videos link on a 
search engine’s home page and then type the search 
text. For example, type the search text, linux tutorial, 
in the search box to find videos for learning about 
Linux. You can narrow your results by specifying addi-
tional conditions. These may include length (in min-
utes), time taken (such as past day, week, or month), 
quality, popularity (based on number of views), and 
source (YouTube or other websites).
To search for audio files, type the search text, 
­audio search, in a search engine’s search box and 
look for a search engine that specializes in finding 
audio clips, streaming audio, and other audio files. 
Alternatively, visit a website for sharing audio and 
music files, and search that site directly. For example, 
type the search text, ios podcast, in an audio shar-
ing site’s search box to find podcasts about Apple’s 
mobile operating system.
Some search apps allow you to speak your search 
text. For example, using Google, tap or click the 
­microphone button in the search box or say the 
phrase, “ok google” to activate voice search and then 
speak your question. The app will convert your speech 
to text and provide the search results.
Research This: Using a search app that accepts 
voice input, either speak the search text or find an 
audio sharing site in which to type search text to find 
podcasts, audio files, or videos about these topics: (1) a 
video about how to manage security settings on your 
computer posted within the past month; (2) a video 
tutorial about how to use the Mac Finder, shorter 
than four minutes in length; (3) a video that was not 
posted on YouTube, describing how to partition a hard 
drive; and (4) audio files of Windows operating system 
­start-up sounds.
Create a document containing the web address 
of each audio or video clip and the name or web 
­address of the website on which it appears. Watch or 
listen to comments on how accurately they reflect your 
search text.

Security
An operating system should include antivirus and 
­spyware and malware detection software to fend 
off intrusions. The use of this security software is 
discussed in Secure IT 9-2 in this chapter. Major 
companies that provide this software often include 
information on their websites about recently discov-
ered virus threats and hoaxes. They also track sched-
uled virus payload strikes and map global and regional 
virus attacks.
Research This: Visit at least two virus protection 
­websites to obtain virus information. When were the 
latest active threats discovered and updated? What 
are their names and risk levels? When is the next virus 
payload strike scheduled? What type of malware is 
spreading via mobile device use? Which virus removal 
tools and resources are available?
5	
Cloud Services 
Cloud Development Platforms (PaaS)
Developers have many choices for the programming 
languages, operating systems, databases, and tools 
they use to create apps hosted on the cloud. Microsoft 
Azure, Amazon Web Services, and Google App 
Engine are providers of platform as a service (PaaS), 
a service of cloud computing that delivers tools for 
developing, testing, and deploying apps on the cloud.
A PaaS provider manages the computing resources 
required to run apps on the cloud so that developers 
can concentrate on writing the code, logic, interfaces, 
and operations of the software.
Research This: (1) Read a customer case study 
about Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services, or 
Google App Engine. In what industry is the customer 
­involved? What was the challenge for which the 
­customer was seeking a PaaS solution? How did this 
solution meet their needs? (2) Research one of these 
PaaS providers. Which operating systems and devel-
opment tools does it support? How does it support 
scalability when additional computing resources are 
required? What pricing model is in place?

Critical Thinking
1.	Using Operating System Tools  
You are the office manager at a social media consulting 
business. The office recently upgraded and replaced 
several computers. You now are running the latest 
version of Windows on all of your computers. Your boss 
asks you to explore the various tools that are included 
with the operating system and to evaluate any additional 
needs you might have.
Do This: Use the web to learn more about the 
­following Windows operating system tools: firewalls,  
automatic updates, and software that scans for  
viruses, spyware, and other malware. Read reviews by 
industry experts and users. Analyze the advantages 
and disadvantages of using built-in operating system 
tools. Do any built-in operating system tools present 
security concerns? If so, 
what would you recom-
mend? ­Explore alterna-
tives for each of the tools, 
and determine whether 
you should disable the 
Windows tool and if any 
risks exist. Compile your 
findings.
2.	Complete Security Solutions  
Your neighbor started a new construction business. 
He would like to hire you to set up his new computers. 
His business will use the Internet to communicate 
with clients via email, store backups of data, and access 
cloud-based accounting software. The office will include 
two networked computers, which will share a printer 
and an Internet connection. In addition, he will use a 
tablet so that he can access the cloud-based accounting 
software using Wi-Fi. Because of security concerns with 
using the Internet, he first would like you to install a 
program(s) designed to protect his computers from 
various security threats.
Do This: Use the web to find answers to the 
­following questions. What types of security threats 
exist on the Internet that could impact his business? 
What types of security measures should he use? 
Evaluate two programs that provide a comprehensive 
security solution. What are the programs’ functions? 
What are their costs? Do the services charge subscrip-
tion fees in order to receive automatic updates? Which 
would you recommend? Why?
3.	Case Study 
Amateur Sports League  You are the new manager 
for a nonprofit amateur soccer league. The board of 
directors has asked you to recommend options for 
­mobile operating systems for the new smartphones 
they would like to purchase.
Do This: Select two mobile operating systems to 
explore (such as Android, iOS, and Windows Phone). 
Use the web to find industry experts’ recommenda-
tions and user reviews for each operating system. 
­Include the different device types for which each is 
available. Examine differences in security, features, 
speed, and reliability. What security concerns ­exist? 
What security features enable you to protect the 
smartphone and its data? Which mobile operating 
system offers the best features? Which is considered 
faster and/or more reliable? Your office computers 
run the Mac OS operating system. Do compatibility 
issues exist with any of the mobile operating sys-
tems? If so, what are the issues? Can you find solu-
tions that would ­enable you to sync data? Compile 
your findings.
The Critical Thinking exercises challenge your assessment and decision-making skills by 
­presenting real-world situations associated with chapter concepts. The Collaboration 
­exercise should be completed with a team.
Instructions: Evaluate the situations below, using personal experiences and one or more resources available to you (such as articles on the web or in 
print, blogs, podcasts, videos, television, user guides, other individuals, electronics or computer stores, etc.). Perform the tasks requested in each exercise 
and share your deliverables in the format requested by your instructor (brief report, presentation, discussion, blog post, video, or other means).
4.	Desktop Operating Systems  You are an analyst for a large manufacturer of laundry soaps. The company currently 
uses an early version of the Windows operating system on its 5,000 desktops. This year, the company plans to upgrade 
the operating system and, if necessary, its desktops. The company asks your team to compare the latest versions of the 
Windows, Mac OS, and Linux operating systems.
Do This: Form a three-member team and assign each member an operating system. Each member should use the 
web to develop a feature/benefit analysis and answer the following questions. What is the initial cost of the ­operating 
system per computer? What are the memory and storage requirements? Will the operating system require the com-
pany to purchase new computers? Which is best at protecting against viruses, spam, and spyware? Which support 
touch input? As a team, compile your findings and share your recommendation with the class.

Objectives
Communications
The process in which two or more computers or devices transfer data, instructions, and 
i­nformation is known as digital communications. Today, even the smallest computers and 
devices can communicate directly with one another, with hundreds of computers on a corporate 
­network, or with millions of other computers around the globe — often via the Internet.
Figure 10-1 shows a sample communications system. Some communications involve cables 
and wires; others are sent wirelessly through the air. For successful communications, you need 
the following:
• A sending device that initiates an instruction to transmit data, instructions, or information
• A communications device that connects the sending device to transmission media
• Transmission media, or a communications channel, on which the data, instructions, or 
information travel
• A communications device that connects the transmission media to a receiving device
• A receiving device that accepts the transmission of data, instructions, or information
As shown in Figure 10-1, all types of computers and mobile devices serve as sending and 
receiving devices in a communications system. This includes servers, desktops, laptops, 
tablets, smartphones, portable media players, handheld game devices, and GPS receivers. 
Communications devices, such as modems, wireless access points, and routers, connect  
transmission media to a sending or receiving device. Transmission media can be wired or 
­wireless.
This chapter presents types of networks, along with various types of communications lines and 
devices, and transmission media.

Chapter 10  Communicating Digital Content
Networks
As discussed in Chapter 1, a network is a collection of computers and devices connected 
together via communications devices and transmission media. A network can be internal to an 
organization or span the world by connecting to the Internet. Many home and business users 
create a network to facilitate communications, share hardware, share data and information, share 
software, and transfer funds (Figure 10-2):
• Facilitate communications. Using a network, people communicate efficiently and easily 
via email, Internet messaging, chat rooms, blogs, wikis, online social networks, video 
calls, online meetings, videoconferences, VoIP, text messaging, and more. Some of these 
communications occur within an internal network. Other times, they occur globally over the 
Internet.
• Share hardware. Each computer or device on a network can be provided access to hardware 
on the network. For example, each computer and mobile device user can access a printer on 
the network, as they need it. Thus, home and business users create networks to save money on 
hardware expenses.
Figure 10-2  Networks facilitate communications; enable sharing of hardware, data and information, and software; and provide a means 
for transferring funds.

• Share data and information. Any authorized user can access data and information stored on 
a network. A large company, for example, might have a database of customer information. Any 
authorized employee can access the database using a computer or mobile device connected to 
the network.
Most businesses use a standard, such as EDI (electronic data interchange), that defines how 
­business documents travel across transmission media. For example, businesses use EDI to send 
bids and proposals, place and track orders, and send invoices.
• Share software. Users connected to a network can access software on the network. To 
support multiple users’ software access, vendors often sell versions of their software designed 
to run on a network or as a web app on the Internet. These network and Internet subscription 
versions usually cost less than buying individual copies of the software for each computer. The 
license fees for these programs typically are based on the number of users or the number of 
computers or mobile devices attached to the network.
• Transfer funds. Electronic funds transfer (EFT) allows users connected to a network to 
exchange money from one account to another via transmission media. Both businesses and 
consumers use EFT. Examples include wire transfers, use of credit cards and debit cards, 
direct deposit of funds into bank accounts, online banking, and online bill payment.
Instead of using the Internet or investing in and administering an internal network, some 
companies hire a value-added network provider for network functions. A value-added network 
(VAN) provider is a third-party business that provides networking services such as EDI services, 
secure data and information transfer, storage, or email. Some VANs, such as PayPal, charge an 
annual or monthly fee; others charge by the service used.

and information.

Sharing Network 
Software
When you use a network 
to share software, you 
sometimes have to install 
the software on your 
computer, and a server 
on the network manages 
the licenses.

What is an intranet?
Recognizing the efficiency and power of the Internet, many organizations apply Internet and web technologies to 
their internal networks. An intranet (intra means within) is an internal network that uses Internet technologies. 
Intranets generally make company information accessible to employees and facilitate collaboration within an 
organization. Files on an intranet generally are not accessible from the Internet.
One or more servers on an intranet host an organization’s internal webpages, applications, email messages, files, 
and more. Users locate information, access resources, and update content on an intranet using methods similar 
to those used on the Internet. A company hosts its intranet on servers different from those used to host its public 
webpages, apps, and files.
Sometimes a company uses an extranet (extra means outside or beyond), which allows customers or suppliers to 
access part of its intranet. Package shipping companies, for example, allow customers to access their intranet via an 
extranet to print air bills, schedule pickups, and track shipped packages as the packages travel to their destinations.
	
LANs, MANs, WANs, and PANs
Networks usually are classified as a local area network, metropolitan area network, wide area 
network, or personal area network. The main difference among these classifications is their area 
of coverage.
LAN  A local area network (LAN) is a network that connects computers and devices in a 
limited geographical area, such as a home, school, office building (Figure 10-3), or closely 
positioned group of buildings. Each computer or device on the network, called a node, often 
shares resources, such as printers, large hard drives, and programs. Often, the nodes are 
­connected via cables.

A wireless LAN (WLAN) is a LAN that uses no physical wires. Computers and devices that 
access a wireless LAN must have built-in wireless capability or the appropriate wireless network 
card, USB adapter, or other wireless device. A WLAN may communicate with a wired LAN for 
access to its resources, such as software, hardware, and the Internet (Figure 10-4). Read How To 
10-1 for instructions about adding mobile computers or devices to wireless networks.

MAN  A metropolitan area network (MAN) is 
a high-speed network that connects local area 
networks in a metropolitan area, such as a city 
or town, and handles the bulk of communica-
tions activity across that region. A MAN typi-
cally includes one or more LANs, but covers a 
smaller geographic area than a WAN.
A MAN usually is managed by a ­consortium 
of users or by a single network provider that 
sells the service to the users. Local and state 
governments, for example, regulate some 
MANs. Phone companies, cable television 
­providers, and other organizations provide 
users with connections to the MAN.
WAN  A wide area network (WAN) is a 
­network that covers a large geographic area 
(such as a city, country, or the world) using 
a variety of wired and wireless transmission 
media (Figure 10-5). A WAN can be one large 
network or can consist of multiple LANs con-
nected together. The Internet is the world’s 
largest WAN.
PAN  A personal area network (PAN) 
is a network that connects computers and 
devices in an individual’s workspace using 
wired and wireless technology. Devices 
Add a Computer or Mobile Device to a 
Wi-Fi Network
If you are using a mobile computer or 
device, such as a tablet or smartphone, 
in a location that has a Wi-Fi network, 
you might want to add the device to the 
­network. When a mobile device is ­connected 
to a Wi-Fi network, you not only can 
­transfer data and information more quickly, 
but you also might save charges imposed 
by a mobile service provider if you subscribe 
to a mobile data plan. The ­following steps 
describe how to add a mobile computer or 
device to a Wi-Fi network:
1.	 Obtain the necessary network information 
required to connect. This might include 
the network’s SSID and password. Read 
How To 5-3 in Chapter 5 for additional 
­information about SSIDs.
2.	 If necessary, enable the device’s capability 
of connecting to Wi-Fi networks.
3.	 If necessary, display the list of available 
Wi-Fi networks that are in range of the 
mobile computer or device.
4.	 Select the Wi-Fi network to which you 
want to connect.
5.	 If necessary, enter the required password 
for the network.
6.	 If desired, disconnect from the 
mobile ­network so that your device 
­communicates using only the Wi-Fi 
­network.
7.	 Run a browser and navigate to 
a ­webpage to verify that the device 
is ­connected to the network  
properly.

include ­smartphones, digital cameras, printers, and more. A PAN may connect devices 
through a router using network cables or directly using special USB cables. PANs also may 
use Bluetooth or Wi-Fi technology. A body area network (BAN), sometimes called a body 
­sensor network (BSN), is a type of PAN that wirelessly connects sensors worn by, carried by, 
implanted in, or attached to a human body. Read Ethics & Issues 10-1 to consider how BANs 
are used to monitor medical data.
Ethics & Issues 10-1
Would You Use a BAN to Monitor 
Medical Data?
By wearing, carrying, implanting, or 
­attaching small devices to a person’s body, 
medical professionals can track vital signs 
and monitor heart rhythms, breathing rates, 
and much more via a BAN, which uses low-
powered sensors to collect data. The BAN 
sends the collected data wirelessly to an 
Internet-connected device, which relays the 
data to a medical data server. In some cases, 
the data transmits directly to emergency 
­services. Some devices also automatically 
can dispense medications based on the 
data collected.
Because of these devices, a patient may 
not have to visit a medical facility to receive 
treatment. Heart patients, diabetics, or those 
with asthma or other similar conditions can 
perform regular daily activities while wearing 
the device. If it collects any unusual data, 
the patient can receive medical resources 
immediately. First responders also use these 
devices. A fire chief, for example, can monitor 
firefighters’ body temperature and oxygen 
levels as they battle a fire.
The disadvantages of BANs include data 
validity and security. What happens if a 
device stops working or its data becomes 
corrupt? Serious health complications 
could result if the patient is not monitoring 
conditions via another technique. For 
example, devices that administer medication 
could cause an overdose or underdose if 
not working properly. Medical data is highly 
sensitive. An unscrupulous individual could 
intercept vital signs and other personal 
data during transfer, violating a patient’s 
confidentiality. Privacy advocates also 
have concerns about nonmedical uses of 
BANs. The FCC (Federal Communications 
Commission) controls the registration of 
MBANs (medical BANs). The FCC regulates 
the radio frequency in which an MBAN can 
transmit data. Some types of MBANs are 
restricted to be used only within a licensed 
medical facility.
Consider This: Should insurance 
­companies be required to pay for BANs? 
Why or why not? Would you use a BAN for 
a medical condition? Why or why not?
Network Architectures
The configuration of computers, devices, and media on a ­network 
is sometimes called the ­network architecture. Two examples of ­network 
architectures are client/server or peer-to-peer.
Client/Server  On a client/server network, one or more 
­computers act as a server, and the other computers on the network 
request services from the server (Figure 10-6). A server, sometimes 
called a host computer, controls access to the hardware, software, 
and other resources on the network and provides a centralized 
storage area for programs, data, and information. The clients 
are other computers and mobile devices on the network that rely 
on the server for its resources. For example, a server might store 
an organization’s email messages. Clients on the network, which 
include any users’ connected computers or mobile devices, access 
email messages on the server. Both wired and wireless networks 
can be ­configured as a client/server network.
Although it can connect a smaller number of computers, a client/
server network architecture typically provides an efficient means to 
connect 10 or more computers. Most client/server networks require 
a person to serve as a network administrator because of the large size 
of the network.
As discussed in Chapter 3, some servers are dedicated servers 
that perform a specific task. For example, a network server man-
ages ­network traffic (activity), and a web server delivers requested 
­webpages to computers or mobile devices.

Peer-to-Peer  A peer-to-peer (P2P) network is a simple, 
inexpensive network architecture that typically connects 
fewer than 10 computers. Each computer or mobile 
device, called a peer, has equal responsibilities and capa-
bilities, sharing hardware (such as a printer), data, or 
information with other computers and mobile devices 
on the peer-to-peer network (Figure 10-7). ­Peer-to-peer 
­networks allow users to share resources and files located 
on their computers and to access shared resources 
found on other computers on the network. Peer-to-peer 
­networks do not have a common file server. Instead, all 
computers can use any of the resources available on other 
computers on the network. For example, you might set up 
a P2P network between an Android tablet and a Windows 
laptop so that they can share files using Bluetooth or so 
that you can print from the tablet to a printer accessible 
to all devices on the network. Both wired and wireless 
networks can be configured as a peer-to-peer network.
P2P networks are ideal for very small businesses and 
home users. Some operating systems include a P2P 
­networking tool that allows users to set up a peer-to-peer 
network. Many businesses also see an advantage to using 
P2P. That is, companies and employees can exchange files using P2P, freeing the company from 
­maintaining a network server for this purpose. Business-to-business e-commerce websites find 
that P2P easily allows buyers and sellers to share company information such as product databases.
Figure 10-7  As illustrated by the communications in this 
simplified diagram, each computer or mobile device on a P2P 
network shares its hardware and software with other computers 
and mobile devices on the network. Connections can be wired or 
wireless and may occur through a communications device.

Consider This
What is P2P file sharing?
P2P file sharing, sometimes called a file sharing network, describes a network configuration on which users access 
one another’s hard drives and exchange files directly via a file sharing program. As more users connect to the 
network, each user has access to shared files on other users’ hard drives. When users sign out of the network, 
others no longer have access to their hard drives.

Communications Software
Communications software consists of programs and apps that (1) help users establish a 
­connection to another computer, mobile device, or network; (2) manage the transmission of 
data, instructions, and information; and (3) provide an interface for users to communicate with 
one another. The first two often are provided by or included as tools with an operating system 
or bundled with a communications device. The third is provided by applications such as email, 
FTP, browser, discussion boards, chat rooms, Internet messaging, videoconferencing, and VoIP.
Sometimes, communications devices are preprogrammed to accomplish communications 
tasks. Some routers, for example, contain firmware for various protocols. Other communica-
tions devices require separate communications software to ensure proper transmission of data. 
Communications software works with the network standards and protocols (presented in a later 
section) to ensure data moves through the network or the Internet correctly.

Chapter 10  Communicating Digital Content
Mobile Communications
After visiting your parents for the weekend, you receive 
an email message from your mom asking about your trip 
home. You respond that it was fine and that you were 
able to send text messages over the Internet to your sister 
because the bus had a Wi-Fi connection. Meanwhile, your 
roommate sends you a text message with directions to the 
restaurant where you are meeting for dinner. That night, you 
chat on Facebook with a classmate about your homework 
and catch up on your friends’ updates. You see your brother 
is online, so you invite him to a video call where you talk 
about the ball game streaming on your phone. From email 
and text messages to voice and video calls, computers and 
mobile devices offer many ways to communicate.
Email is best for sharing longer, detailed messages. 
For shorter or time-sensitive messages, consider using 
the following forms of immediate communications.
Text/Picture/Video Messaging
Text, picture, and video messages often take the place 
of phone conversations among many people, who find 
exchanging these messages to be less intrusive and more 
efficient than voice conversations. SMS (short message 
service) text messages are messages of 300 or fewer 
characters sent from one user to another through a 
mobile service provider’s cell phone tower. With MMS 
(multimedia message service), users also can send and 
receive photos, videos, and audio files. Occasional users 
might subscribe to a text-messaging plan, where provid-
ers charge a small fee for each message sent or received. 
In contrast, avid users, who send frequent text, picture, or 
video messages, might subscribe to an unlimited plan. To 
avoid paying fees to mobile service providers for sending 
text messages, some people opt for free messaging apps 
and services available via third-party providers. These 
services send messages over the Internet rather than 
a provider’s network. Some of these services are free 
when both parties subscribe. Free messaging apps often 
include advertising content alongside the messages.
Internet Messaging
With Internet messaging services, you can send text 
or media messages in real time to other online users. To 
access an Internet messaging service, you need the ser-
vice’s desktop, web, or mobile app, and an Internet con-
nection on your computer or mobile device. Users with 
accounts on multiple Internet messaging services often 
use an Internet messaging aggregator app to manage 
contact lists and chat on different Internet messaging 
networks simultaneously.
Some providers allow you to merge your text/­ 
picture/video (SMS and MMS) and Internet messages so 
that you can see messages of both types from the same 
contact in a single conversation.
Voice and Video Calling
VoIP services, such as Skype and FaceTime, also 
­provide voice and video calling services over the 
Internet. These often are much less expensive than 
making phone calls over a mobile service provider’s 
network. It also is possible to make calls from a VoIP 
program to a mobile or landline phone. Voice and 
video calling require large amounts of bandwidth. As a 
result, some carriers prohibit the use of calling services 
over their networks, requiring users to connect via 
Wi-Fi to make these calls. Read Ethics & Issues 10-2 to 
consider video calling and other issues associated with 
­communications technologies and medical care.
Data Plans
Your mobile device’s data plan enables you to 
access the Internet through your mobile service 
­provider’s network when Wi-Fi is not available. 
Without a data plan, you must use Wi-Fi or a wired 
connection to access the Internet on your computer or 
mobile device. Some mobile service providers offer an 
unlimited data plan for your device, while many offer 
limited data plans. If you exceed your data limit in a 
given month, additional fees apply. By monitoring your 
data usage to see how much you use on average over 
a few months, you can decide on the best plan for 
you. Some carriers offer a shared data plan that pro-
vides an allotted amount of data to be shared across 
several smartphones, tablets, laptops, gaming devices, 
and mobile hot spots. Using Wi-Fi when available to 
access the Internet will save on data usage charges if 
you have a limited data plan.

  Consider This: Think about how you use different 
forms of mobile communications to share information 
or communicate with your family, friends, or coworkers 
as part of your daily routine. For what purposes do 
you generally send email messages or text messages? 
After exchanging text messages, when might you 
make a phone call or use VoIP service to talk in real 
time? Under what circumstances is each form of 
communication most efficient?

Network Communications Standards and Protocols
Today’s networks connect terminals, devices, and computers from many different manufacturers 
across many types of networks. For the different devices on various types of networks to be able 
to communicate, the network must use similar techniques of moving data through the network 
from one application to another.
To alleviate the problems of incompatibility and ensure that hardware and software 
­components can be integrated into any network, various organizations such as ANSI 
(American National Standards Institute) and IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics 
Engineers) propose, develop, and approve network standards. A network standard defines 
guidelines that specify the way computers access the medium to which they are connected, 
the type(s) of medium used, the speeds used on different types of networks, and the type(s)

Do the Benefits of Telemedicine 
Outweigh the Risks?
After your doctor asks you several ­questions, 
she gives you a diagnosis and sends 
a prescription to your local pharmacy 
­electronically. Instead of walking out of 
the exam room, you turn off your tablet’s 
webcam, receiving medical care without 
leaving your home. Telemedicine is the use 
of communications and information technol-
ogy to provide and assist with medical care. 
Patients use telemedicine to communicate 
with a doctor, nurse, or pharmacist from their 
home or workplace. Healthcare professionals 
­benefit from collaborating and consulting 
with specialized physicians in other locations.
Proponents of telemedicine state that 
its use can provide healthcare access to 
patients in remote areas, or those who 
are unable to leave their home safely. The 
Mayo Clinic is testing in-office kiosks which 
enable employees to videoconference with a 
medical professional to diagnose minor health 
conditions without the employee having to 
leave work. Another benefit of telemedicine is 
in cases where spread of infectious disease is 
a concern.
Some healthcare experts state that the 
cost of the equipment and time spent 
training healthcare professionals outweighs 
the benefits. The inability of healthcare 
professionals to perform hands-on tasks, 
such as take a temperature or examine 
the patient’s ears or throat, can lead to 
misdiagnosis or an incomplete exam. If a 
patient requires immediate care, such as for 
an allergic reaction, a medical professional 
is not on hand to give treatment, causing 
delays. Insurance companies may require 
physicians to have medical licenses in the 
state where the patient resides in order to 
cover the expenses. Privacy advocates warn 
that hackers can access shared data or spy 
on videoconferences between doctors and 
patients.
Consider This: Have you ever used 
telemedicine to communicate with your 
healthcare provider? Why or why not? 
Would you use a kiosk at your workplace to 
communicate with a healthcare provider? 
Why or why not? Is it practical to relay on 
telemedicine to provide care to people in 
remote areas? Why or why not?

of physical cable and/or the wireless technology 
used. Hardware and software manufacturers design 
their products to meet the guidelines specified in a 
particular standard, so that their devices can com-
municate with the network. A standard that outlines 
characteristics of how two devices communicate on 
a ­network is called a protocol. Specifically, a proto-
col may define data format, coding schemes, error 
­handling, and the sequence in which data transfers 
over a network.
Table 10-1 identifies some of the more widely

Do network standards and protocols work together?
Network standards and protocols often work together to move data through a network. Some of these standards define 
how a network is arranged physically, while others specify how messages travel along a network. Thus, as data moves 
through a network from one program to another, it may use one or more of these standards.
	
Ethernet
Ethernet is a network standard that specifies no central computer or device on the network 
(nodes) should control when data can be transmitted. That is, each node attempts to transmit 
data when it determines the network is available to receive communications. If two ­computers 
or devices on an Ethernet network attempt to send data at the same time, a collision will occur. 
When this happens, the computers or devices resend their messages until data transfer is 
­successful.
The Ethernet standard defines guidelines for the physical configuration of a network (e.g., 
cabling, network devices, and nodes). Ethernet currently is the most popular network standard 
for LANs because it is relatively inexpensive and easy to install and maintain. Depending on the 
transmission media used, Ethernet networks have data transfer rates that range from 10 Mbps 
for home/small office users to 100 Gbps for enterprise users.
Token Ring
The token ring standard specifies that computers and devices on the network share or pass a 
special signal, called a token, in a unidirectional manner and in a preset order. A token is a special 
series of bits that functions like a ticket. The device with the token can transmit data over the 
network. Only one token exists per network. This ensures that only one computer transmits data 
at a time. Although token ring is not as widely used today, many networks use the concept of a 
token.
The token ring standard defines guidelines for the physical configuration of a network 
(e.g., cabling, network cards, and devices). Some token ring networks connect up to 72 devices. 
Others use a special type of wiring that allows up to 260 connections. The data transfer rate on 
a token ring network ranges from 4 Mbps to 1 Gbps.

TCP/IP
Short for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol, TCP/IP is a network protocol 
that defines how messages (data) are routed from one end of a network to the other, ­ensuring 
the data arrives correctly. TCP/IP describes rules for dividing messages into small pieces, called 
packets; providing addresses for each packet; checking for and detecting errors; sequencing 
­packets; and regulating the flow of messages along the network.
TCP/IP has been adopted as the network standard for Internet communications. Thus, all 
hosts on the Internet follow the rules defined in this standard. As shown in Figure 10-8, Internet 
communications also use other standards, such as the Ethernet standard, as data is routed to its 
destination.
When a computer sends data over the Internet, the data is divided into packets. Each packet 
contains the data, as well as the recipient (destination), the origin (sender), and the sequence 
information used to reassemble the data at the destination. Each packet travels along the fastest 
individual available path to the recipient’s computer or mobile device via routers. This technique 
of breaking a message into individual packets, sending the packets along the best route available, 
and then reassembling the data is called packet switching. Read Secure IT 10-1 for another use 
of packets.
Figure 10-8  This figure illustrates how Internet communications use TCP/IP and Ethernet to ensure that data travels correctly to 
its destination.

Chapter 10  Communicating Digital Content
Wi-Fi
Computers and devices that have the appropriate wireless capability can communicate via 
radio waves with other computers or devices using Wi-Fi (wireless fidelity), which identifies 
any network based on the 802.11 standards. Developed by IEEE, 802.11 is a series of net-
work standards that specifies how two wireless devices communicate over the air with each 
other. Common standards include 802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g, 802.11n, 802.11ac, 802.11ad, 
and 802.11af, with data transfer rates ranging from 11 Mbps to 7 Gbps. Many devices support 
multiple standards. For example, a designation of 802.11 ac/b/g/n on a computer, router, or 
other device indicates it supports those four standards (ac, b, g, and n).
Wi-Fi sometimes is referred to as wireless Ethernet because it uses techniques similar to the 
Ethernet standard to specify how physically to configure a wireless network. Thus, Wi-Fi net-
works easily can be integrated with wired Ethernet networks. When a Wi-Fi network accesses 
the Internet, it works in conjunction with the TCP/IP network standard.
One popular use of the Wi-Fi network standard is in hot spots that offer mobile users the 
ability to connect to the Internet with their Wi-Fi-enabled wireless computers and devices. 
Many homes and small businesses also use Wi-Fi to network computers and devices wirelessly. 
In open or outdoor areas free from interference, the computers or devices should be within 
300 feet of a wireless access point or hot spot. In closed areas, the wireless network range is 
about 100 feet. To obtain communications at the maximum distances, you may need to install 
extra hardware to extend or strengthen a wireless signal.

LTE
LTE (Long Term Evolution) is a network standard that defines how high-speed cellular 
­transmissions use broadcast radio to transmit data for mobile communications. Developed by the 
Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), LTE has the potential of 100 Mbps ­downstream rate 
Secure IT 10-1
Monitoring Network Traffic
Network monitoring software constantly 
assesses the status of a network and sends 
an email or text message, usually to the 
network administrator, when it detects a 
problem. These messages may state that an 
outage has occurred, the server’s available 
memory space is near capacity, a new user 
account has been added, or some other 
­critical event has developed.
Monitoring software can measure the 
amount of network traffic, graph network 
usage, determine when a specific program 
uses the network, and show the bandwidth 
used by each computer or mobile device. On 
networks that use the TCP/IP protocol, for 
example, packet sniffer software monitors and 
logs packet traffic for later analysis. Packet 
sniffing can detect problems, such as why 
traffic is flowing slowly.
The software also can play a security role, 
including identifying unusual or excessive 
network activity. For example, it can flag 
a remote computer always connected to 
the network or someone making repeated 
attempts to sign in to an account. Hackers 
use packet sniffer software to hijack a 
computer, which means they capture a user’s 
packets and then reconstruct the contents 
of webpages that were visited, obtain user 
names and passwords, and trace photos and 
videos viewed.
  Consider This: How would you ­determine 
if your employer or school has network 
monitoring software? Would you change your 
computer activities, including browsing certain 
websites, if you knew the software could track 
your computer or mobile device usage?
Consider This
Can IP addresses be used to determine a computer or device’s location?
In many cases, you can determine a computer or a device’s location from its IP address. For example, if an 
IP address begins with 132.170, a small amount of research will uncover that the University of Central Florida 
assigns IP addresses beginning with these numbers; however, additional research would be necessary to determine 
where the computer or mobile device is located on the network. Certain websites allow visitors to find a location 
by entering an IP address. Some web apps infer your approximate location from your IP address when GPS is not 
available in order to provide you with local information or nearby search results.

LTE supports data, messaging, voice, and video transmissions. Many mobile service providers, 
including AT&T and Verizon Wireless, offer LTE service.

Bluetooth/Mini Feature 10-2
Bluetooth is a network protocol that defines how two Bluetooth devices use short-range 
radio waves to transmit data. The data transfers between devices at a rate of up to 3 Mbps. To 
communicate with each other, Bluetooth devices often must be within about 33 feet but can be 
extended to about 325 feet with additional equipment.
A Bluetooth device contains a small chip that allows it to communicate with other Bluetooth 
devices. For computers and devices not Bluetooth-enabled, you can purchase a Bluetooth wire-
less port adapter that will convert an existing USB port into a Bluetooth port. Most ­current 
operating systems have built-in Bluetooth support. When connecting two devices using 
Bluetooth, the originating device sends a code to the connecting device. The codes must match 
to establish the connection. Devices that share a Bluetooth connection are said to be paired.

Bluetooth Technology
Most mobile devices and computers manufactured today 
are equipped with Bluetooth capability. One of the earli-
est and most popular uses of Bluetooth is to connect 
hands-free headsets to a mobile phone. Bluetooth has 
many additional uses, and device manufacturers are 
increasingly including Bluetooth technology.
Uses
You can use Bluetooth-enabled or Bluetooth-enhanced 
devices in many ways, including the following:
• Connect devices, such as mobile phones, portable media 
players, or GPS devices, with vehicle stereos, which use 
the vehicle’s speakers to project 
sound (shown in the figure).
• Use GPS receivers to send 
directions to a mobile phone or 
GPS-enabled device.
• Transfer photos wirelessly from 
a digital camera to a laptop or 
server.
• Play music on a 
smartphone through the 
speakers on a computer or 
other ­Bluetooth-enabled  
device.
• Send signals between video 
game accessories, video game 
devices, and a television.
• Establish a PAN (personal area 
network).
• Allow communications between a computer and 
devices, such as a keyboard, printer, Smart TV, or mobile 
phone. Connecting these devices enables you to print 
documents, share calendar appointments, and more.
• Replace wired communications devices, such as bar code 
readers, with wireless devices to enhance portability.
• Transmit data from a medical device, such as a blood 
glucose monitor, to a mobile phone or other device.
• Change the channel, pause a program, or schedule a 
recording using a Bluetooth-compatible or Bluetooth-
enabled television and remote control.
• Track objects that include tags or nodes used to send 
wireless signals read by a real-time location system.

Advantages and Disadvantages
Advantages of using Bluetooth technology include 
the following:
• If a device has Bluetooth capability, using Bluetooth 
technology is free.
• Although Bluetooth devices need to be near each 
other, they do not have to be in the same room, 
within the same line of sight, or facing each other.
• Bluetooth devices typically require low processing 
power and use little energy, so using Bluetooth 
technology will not drain a device’s batteries.
• Establishing a wireless Bluetooth connection is easy. 
With most Bluetooth-enabled devices, you simply tap or 
click a Bluetooth shortcut or icon to enable Bluetooth. 
Once enabled, the devices usually immediately recog-
nize a connection. (Before initial use, you may need to 
pair two Bluetooth devices so that they can communi-
cate with each other. Read How To 3-1 in Chapter 3 for 
instructions about pairing Bluetooth devices.)
• Bluetooth connections have low security risks. If 
you want to secure a Bluetooth channel, you would 
define an identification number for the connection 
and create a PIN that you can distribute as needed. If 
the secured computer or device detects an unknown 
Bluetooth connection, you can choose to accept or 
reject it. Read Secure IT 10-2 to learn about security 
risks associated with using Bluetooth technology.
• Bluetooth technology is standardized globally, 
meaning it can be used to connect devices that are 
not the same make or model.
• Bluetooth connections have little risk of interference 
with other wireless networks because the strength 
of the wireless signals is weak and because of 
frequency hopping, which changes frequency 
channels periodically.
One disadvantage of Bluetooth technology is its low 
bandwidth. Because of its slow data transfer speeds, 
Bluetooth technology is not an ideal solution for replac-
ing a LAN. Because Bluetooth-enabled mobile pay-
ment services are new, security risks may exist. Most 
agree that the advantages of Bluetooth technology far 
­outweigh the disadvantages.

  Consider This: Have you used Bluetooth 
technology to connect two devices? What devices did 
you connect, and what was your experience? In your 
opinion, what is the best reason to use Bluetooth? 
Why? What devices do you think will include Bluetooth 
technology in the future?
Secure IT 10-2
Preventing Bluebugging
One reason why Bluetooth technology is 
so popular is because connections gener-
ally have low security risks, as described in 
Mini Feature 10-2. Despite this advantage, 
security experts have seen an increase 
in Bluebugging, which occurs when 
cyberthieves exploit Bluetooth devices that 
have been paired. Smartphones and other 
mobile devices are discoverable to other 
Bluetooth devices only for a short period 
when they first are turned on, but dur-
ing this time the hackers can intercept the 
signals or use hardware that has the same 
identifying characteristics as the smartphone 
or other mobile device. Once hackers have 
intercepted a device, they take control and 
read or download personal data, place calls, 
monitor conversations, review text and email 
messages, and modify contacts.
Security experts recommend following these 
practices to prevent Bluebugging:
• Turn off Bluetooth capability if it is not 
required. Use a Bluetooth earpiece only 
when you need to be hands free.
• Use your device in a remote area. 
­Bluebuggers often work in crowded and 
public places, such as shopping centers, 
parks, and public transportation, and they 
can intercept signals up to 30 feet away 
from the device.
• Prevent hackers from intercepting your 
device by pairing it for the first time in a 
secure location, such as your home.
• If Bluetooth is required, be certain the 
device’s visibility setting is hidden and 
all paired devices are set to unauthor-
ized so that the user must authorize each 
­connection request.
• Upgrade your phone. Older devices are 
more vulnerable to these intrusions.
  Consider This: Have you paired your 
phone with any Bluetooth devices? If so, did 
you pair them in a private location? Which of 
these guidelines will you follow to attempt to 
prevent Bluebugging?
UWB
UWB, which stands for ultra-wideband, is a network standard that specifies how two UWB 
devices use short-range radio waves to communicate at high speeds with each other. At distances 
of about 33 feet, the data transfer rate is 110 Mbps. At closer distances, such as about 6.5 feet, 
the transfer rate is at least 480 Mbps. UWB can transmit signals through doors and other obsta-
cles. Because of its high transfer rates, UWB is best suited for transmission of large files, such 
as video, graphics, and audio. Examples of UWB uses include locating and tracking inventory, 
equipment, or personnel (especially in remote or dangerous areas).

IrDA
Some devices, such as television remote controls, use the IrDA (Infrared Data Association) ­standard 
to transmit data wirelessly to each other via infrared (IR) light waves. The devices transfer data 
at rates from 115 Kbps (thousand bits per second) to 4 Mbps between their IrDA ports. Infrared 
requires line-of-sight transmission; that is, the sending device and the receiving device must be in line 
with each other so that nothing obstructs the path of the infrared light wave. Because Bluetooth and 
UWB do not require line-of-sight transmission, these technologies are more widespread than IrDA.
RFID
RFID (radio frequency identification) is a protocol that defines how a network uses radio signals 
to communicate with a tag placed in or attached to an object, an animal, or a person. The tag, 
called a transponder, consists of an antenna and a memory chip that contains the information to 
be transmitted via radio waves. Through an antenna, an RFID reader, also called a transceiver, 
reads the radio signals and transfers the information to a computer or computing device. Read 
Secure IT 6-2 in Chapter 6 for uses of animal implants.
Depending on the type of RFID reader, the distance between the tag and the reader ranges 
from 5 inches to 300 feet or more. Readers can be handheld or embedded in an object, such as a 
doorway or a tollbooth (Figure 10-9).

How Electronic RFID Toll Collection Works
high-speed camera
RFID
reader
RFID tag
Step 1 
Motorist purchases an RFID transponder
or RFID tag and attaches it to the
vehicle’s windshield.
Step 2 
As the vehicle approaches the tollbooth, the RFID reader in the tollbooth 
sends a radio wave that activates the windshield-mounted RFID tag. 
The activated tag sends vehicle information to the RFID reader.
Step 3 
The RFID reader sends the vehicle 
information to the lane controller. 
The lane controller, which is part 
of a local area network, transmits 
the vehicle information to a 
central computer that subtracts 
the toll from the motorist’s 
account. If the vehicle does not 
have an RFID tag, a high-speed 
camera takes a picture of the 
license plate and the computer 
prints a violation notice,
which is mailed to the motorist.

NFC
NFC (near field communications) is a protocol, based on 
RFID, that defines how a network uses close-range radio 
­signals to communicate between two devices or objects 
equipped with NFC technology (Figure 10-10). Examples of 
NFC-enabled devices include smartphones, digital cameras, 
televisions, and terminals. Credit cards, tickets, and NFC tags 
are examples of objects that also use NFC technology. An 
NFC tag is a chip that can store small amounts of data. NFC 
tags are in a variety of objects, such as posters, ski lift tickets, 
business cards, stickers, and wristbands.
For successful communications, the devices or objects 
touch or are placed within an inch or two of each other. For 
example, you can touch two NFC-enabled phones together to 
transfer contacts, touch an NFC-enabled phone to an NFC 
tag to display a map, or hold an NFC-enabled phone near 
a parking meter to pay for parking. Contactless payment, 
such as the parking meter example, is a popular use of NFC 
technology. Other uses of NFC technology include sharing 
contacts or photos, downloading apps, and gaining access or 
admittance.

Can you buy a blank NFC tag?
Yes. Consumers can purchase blank NFC tags (shown in the bottom photo in Figure 10-10) at a reasonable cost 
and easily program them to perform certain actions. For example, you can program an NFC tag to contain your 
home network user name and password. Visitors to your home can touch their phones to the NFC tag to access 
your home network without entering the user name and password.

Communications Lines
A dedicated line is a type of always-on physical connection that is established between two 
communications devices. Businesses often use dedicated lines to connect geographically distant 
offices. Dedicated lines can be either analog or digital. Digital lines 
increasingly are connecting home and business users to networks 
around the globe because they transmit data and information at 
faster rates than analog lines.
Digital dedicated lines include cable television lines, DSL, ISDN 
lines, FTTP, T-carrier lines, and ATM. Table 10-2 shows speeds of 
various dedicated digital lines.
Cable
The cable television (CATV) network provides high-speed Internet 
connections, called cable Internet service. The CATV signal enters 
a building through a single line, usually a coaxial cable. This cable 
connects to a modem (discussed in the next section), which typically 
attaches to your computer via an Ethernet cable. Home and small 
business users often subscribe to cable Internet service.

DSL
DSL (Digital Subscriber Line) transmits on existing standard copper phone wiring. Some DSL 
installations include a dial tone, providing users with both voice and data communications. 
These DSL installations often require that filters be installed to reduce noise interference when 
voice communications share the same line. DSL is a popular digital line alternative for the small 
business or home user.
ADSL is a popular type of DSL. As shown in Figure 10-11, ADSL (asymmetric digital ­subscriber 
line) is a type of DSL that supports faster downstream rates than upstream rates. ADSL is ideal for 
Internet access because most users download more information from the Internet than they upload.
Consider This
Which is a better choice, DSL or cable Internet service?
Each has its own advantages. DSL uses a line that is not shared with other users in the neighborhood. With 
cable Internet service, by contrast, users might share the node with up to hundreds of other cable Internet users. 
Simultaneous access by many users can cause the cable Internet service to slow down. Cable Internet service, 
however, has widespread availability and usually has faster transmission rates.

ISDN
Not as widely used today as in the past, ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network) is a set 
of standards for digital transmission of data over standard copper phone lines. With ISDN, the 
same phone line that could carry only one computer signal now can carry three or more signals 
at once through the same line, using a technique called multiplexing.
FTTP
FTTP, which stands for Fiber to the Premises, uses fiber-optic cable to provide extremely 
high-speed Internet access to a user’s physical permanent location.
• FTTH (Fiber to the Home) provides home users with Internet access via fiber-optic cable.
• FTTB (Fiber to the Building) refers to small businesses that use fiber-optic cables to access the 
Internet.
With FTTP service, an optical terminal at your location receives the signals and transfers 
them to a router connected to a computer. As the cost of installing fiber decreases, more homes 
and businesses are expected to choose FTTP.

Chapter 10  Communicating Digital Content
T-Carrier
A T-carrier line is any of several types of long-distance digital phone lines that carry ­multiple 
signals over a single communications line. Whereas a standard phone line carries only one 
­signal, digital T-carrier lines use multiplexing so that multiple signals share the line. T-carrier 
lines provide very fast data transfer rates. Only medium to large companies usually can afford 
the investment in T-carrier lines because these lines are so expensive.
The most popular T-carrier line is the T1 line. Businesses often use T1 lines to connect to the 
Internet. Home and small business users purchase fractional T1, in which they share a ­connection 
to the T1 line with other users. Fractional T1 is slower than a dedicated T1 line, but it also is 
less expensive. Users who do not have other high-speed Internet access in their areas can opt for 
fractional T1. With fractional T1 lines, the data transfer rates become slower as additional users 
are added.
A T3 line is equal in speed to 28 T1 lines. T3 lines are quite expensive. Main users of T3 lines 
include large corporations, phone companies, and ISPs connecting to the Internet backbone. 
The Internet backbone itself also uses T3 lines.
ATM
ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) is a service that carries voice, data, video, and media at 
very high speeds. Phone networks, the Internet, and other networks with large amounts of traffic 
use ATM. Some experts predict that ATM eventually will become the Internet standard for data 
transmission, replacing T3 lines.

Communications Devices
A communications device is any type of hardware capable of transmitting data, ­instructions, 
and information between a sending device and a receiving device. At the sending end, a 
­communications device sends the data, instructions, or information from the sending device to 
transmission media. At the receiving end, a communications device receives the signals from the 
transmission media.
The following pages describe a variety of communications devices: modems, wireless access 
points, routers, network cards, and hubs and switches.
Digital Modems: Cable, DSL, and ISDN
A broadband modem, also called a digital modem, is a communications device that sends and 
receives data and information to and from a digital line. Three types of broadband modems are 
cable modems, DSL modems, and ISDN modems. These modems typically include built-in 
Wi-Fi connectivity.

Transmission Media
Computers process 
data as digital signals. 
Data, instructions, and 
information travel along 
transmission media in 
either analog or digital 
form, depending on the 
transmission media.

A cable modem is a broadband modem that sends 
and receives digital data over the CATV network. To 
access the Internet using the CATV service, as shown 
in Figure 10-12, the CATV provider installs a split-
ter inside your house. From the splitter, one part of 
the cable runs to your televisions and the other part 
connects to the cable modem. Many CATV provid-
ers include a cable modem as part of the installation; 
some offer a rental plan, and others require that you 
purchase one separately. A cable modem usually is an 
external device, in which one end of a cable connects 
to a CATV wall outlet and the other end plugs in a 
port on a computer.
A DSL modem is a broadband modem that 
sends digital data and information from a com-
puter to a DSL line and receives digital data and 
information from a DSL line. Similarly, an ISDN 
modem is a broadband modem that sends digital 
data and information from a computer to an ISDN 
line and receives digital data and information 
from an ISDN line. DSL and ISDN modems usually are external devices, in which one end 
­connects to the phone line and the other end connects to a port on the computer.

What are dial-up modems?
A dial-up modem is a communications device that converts digital signals to analog signals and analog signals to 
digital signals, so that data can travel along an analog phone line. For example, a dial-up modem connected to a 
sending computer converts the computer’s digital signals into analog signals. The analog signals then can travel 
over a standard phone line. A dial-up modem connected to a receiving computer converts the analog signals from 
a standard phone line into digital signals that the computer can process.
A dial-up connection must be reestablished each time the modem is used. With transfer rates of only up to 
56 Kbps, dial-up connections also are much slower than broadband connections. For these reasons, dial-up 
connections are used only in remote areas or where high-speed or wireless options are not available.

Cable and DSL
Cable and DSL are more 
widely used than ISDN.
Wireless Modems
Some mobile users have a wireless modem 
that uses a mobile service provider’s network to 
connect to the Internet wirelessly from a com-
puter or mobile device (Figure 10-13). Wireless 
modems, which have an external or built-in 
antenna, are available as USB adapters and 
other devices.
Some smartphones also can function as 
a wireless modem, called a mobile hot spot, 
when tethered to a personal computer 
or mobile device. Read How To 10-2 for 
­instructions about using your phone as a 
mobile hot spot.

Wireless Access Points
A wireless access point (WAP) is a central 
­communications device that allows computers 
and devices to transfer data wirelessly among 
themselves or to a wired network using wire-
less technologies, such as Wi-Fi (Figure 10-14). 
Wireless access points have high-quality internal 
or external antennas for optimal signals. For the 
best signal, some manufacturers suggest position-
ing the wireless access point at the highest pos-
sible location and using a device to strengthen 
your wireless signal. Read How To 10-3 for 
tips to strengthen your wireless signal. A wireless access point either connects to a router via 
an Ethernet or other cable or is part of a router.
Use Your Phone as a Mobile Hot Spot
If you are in a location without a wireless 
Internet connection, you may be able to 
access the Internet from your desktop or 
mobile computer if you enable your smart-
phone as a mobile hot spot. When you 
enable a phone as a mobile hot spot, the 
phone acts as a wireless access point. You 
then can connect your desktop or mobile 
computer to the phone and utilize the data 
plan on your phone to access the Internet. 
If you have a limited data plan with your 
mobile service provider, you should be care-
ful not to use your phone as a hot spot too 
often. While the speed from a mobile hot 
spot might not be as fast as your home or 
office network, it should be more than suf-
ficient for performing tasks such as brows-
ing the web or sending and receiving email 
messages that contain mostly text. The next 
steps describe how to use your phone as a 
mobile hot spot:
1.	 Contact your mobile service provider 
and determine whether your plan 
allows for your phone to be used as a 
mobile hot spot. Using your phone as a 
mobile hot spot may carry an additional 
monthly charge.
2.	 Determine whether your phone has 
­built-in functionality to be used as a 
mobile hot spot. If not and if ­supported 
by your service plan, you may be able to 
download a separate app that allows your 
phone to function as a mobile hot spot.
3.	 Access your phone’s settings and enable 
the mobile hot spot. Your phone should dis-
play the SSID and password to access the 
hot spot. Read How To 5-3 in Chapter 5 for 
additional information about SSIDs.
4.	 Connect to the mobile hot spot on 
a ­computer or mobile device using 
the SSID and password displayed in the 
­previous step.
5.	 When you are finished using the hot spot, 
disconnect from the wireless network on 
your computer and disable the hot spot 
feature on your phone.

how much data you are using on your

Routers
A router is a communications device 
that connects multiple computers or 
other routers together and transmits data 
to its correct destination on a network. 
A router can be used on a network of any 
size. On the largest scale, routers along 
the Internet backbone forward data pack-
ets to their destination using the fastest 
available path. For smaller business and 
home networks, a router allows multiple 
computers and mobile devices to share 
a single broadband Internet connection, 
such as through a cable modem or DSL 
modem (Figure 10-15).
If the network has a separate router, 
it connects to the router via a cable. 
Similarly, if the ­network has a separate 
wireless access point, it connects to the 
router via a cable. Many users, however, 
opt for routers that provide additional 
functionality:
• A wireless router is a device that 
performs the functions of a router and 
also a wireless access point.
• A broadband router is a device that 
performs the functions of a router and 
also a broadband modem.
Strengthen Your Wireless Signal
If you reside in a large apartment or house 
and use a wireless network, you may find 
that you either experience poor network 
performance or you are unable to access the 
network in certain locations. These problems 
may be related to a weak wireless signal 
in your home. Various options are available 
to strengthen a wireless signal to increase 
network performance and ensure you have 
a wireless connection throughout your 
home. The following points describe how to 
strengthen a wireless signal:
• If your wireless router or wireless access 
point has an antenna(s), make sure the 
antenna(s) is extended completely.
• If you are able to remove the antenna(s) from 
your wireless router or wireless access point, 
consider replacing it with a wireless signal 
booster. Check your device’s and the wireless 
signal booster’s documentation to determine 
whether it will work with your device.
• If possible, position the wireless router or 
wireless access point in a central location 
of your home and away from appliances or 
other electronic devices that may degrade the 
signal.
• Purchase a range extender for your wireless 
router or wireless access point. Some range 
extenders are compatible only with specific 
wireless routers or wireless access points, and 
others are universal. Make sure the range 
extender you purchase is compatible with 
your device. Once installed, follow the range 
extender’s instructions to enable it on your 
network.
• If you still experience problems with the 
strength of your wireless signal after follow-
ing the suggestions above, consider replacing 
your wireless router or wireless access point 
with a newer model.
  Consider This: What problems may 
arise if your wireless network’s range 
extends beyond the confines of your 
home? How can you determine the range 
of your wireless network?

Network cards are available in a 
­variety of styles. A ­network card for a 
desktop is an adapter card that has a port 
to which a cable connects (Figure 10-17). 
A network card for mobile c­omputers

follows the guidelines of a particular 
­network communications standard, such 
as Ethernet or token ring.
Hubs and Switches
Today, thousands of computer ­networks 
exist, ranging from small networks oper-
ated by home users to global networks operated by widespread telecommunications firms. 
Interconnecting these many types of networks requires various types of communications devices. 
A hub or switch is a device that provides a central point for cables in a network (Figure 10-18). 
Larger networks typically use a hub, while smaller networks use a switch. Some hubs and/or 
switches include routers. That is, the hub or switch receives data from many directions and then 
forwards it to one or more ­destinations.

Mini Feature 10-3: Planning and Designing Your Home Network
As with any network, a home network’s basic purpose is to share resources and connect devices. 
You can use a home network to share files and folders or to allow multiple devices to share a 
printer. Read Mini Feature 10-3 to learn about planning and designing your home ­network.
Secure IT 10-3
Detecting an Intruder Accessing 
Your Wireless Home Network
One of the largest Internet security threats is 
IP hijacking, which occurs when cyberthieves 
tap into home routers or cable modems or 
other Internet access point to intercept a paid 
Internet service. Some cyberthieves use the 
connection to commit illegal acts; others just 
steal the Internet connection. The incidences of 
IP hijacking are growing, and catching thieves 
is a difficult task for law enforcement officials.
Unscrupulous people hijack Internet service 
in one of two ways. Either the network has no 
security, or the thieves determine the network 
name and password and then reprogram their 
modem’s settings to duplicate the network’s 
settings. The Electronic Communications 
Privacy Act (ECPA) and a lack of funding 
prevent fraud examiners from investigating 
and prosecuting many IP hijackers.
Experts recommend using the following 
steps to determine if someone is accessing a 
wireless network without permission:
• Sign in to the administrative interface. 
The modem’s user’s guide will provide instruc-
tions to view wireless clients actively using a 
wireless access point.
• Count the number of connected 
­devices. Each device connected ­wirelessly 
to the network should be displayed in 
a table that shows, at a minimum, the 
device’s name, MAC address, and IP 
address. (Read How To 5-3 in Chapter 5 
for additional information about MAC 
address controls.) Wireless devices that 
might be connected to the network include 
smartphones, game consoles, DVD players, 
and other hardware. If the number of 
devices seems extraordinarily high, use a 
MAC lookup website, which can help you 
to determine the manufacturer of wireless 
devices in the list.
• Secure the network. The router’s 
manufacturer’s website should provide 
instructions about upgrading the security 
strength. Change the default network name 
and password, and be certain to use the latest 
wireless encryption technology. Enable the 
router’s firewall and, if possible, use “stealth 
mode” to make the network less visible to 
outsiders. Disable the feature that allows 
users to administer the router wirelessly, so 
that changes can be made only when using a 
physical connection with an Ethernet cable.
  Consider This: If you use a wireless 
router, have you taken any of these steps to 
prevent IP hijacking? Which steps will you 
now take? Do you know anyone who has had 
a cyberthief access his or her network?
Planning and Designing 
Your Home Network
A home network enables you to use a common Internet 
connection among many computers and mobile devices. 
Other uses include connecting entertainment devices, 
such as digital video recorders (DVRs) and televisions, 
to the Internet and establishing a connection between 
devices in order to play multiplayer games.
Before purchasing hardware, or contracting a 
network expert to set up your network, consider how 
your network will be used, and by whom. Ask yourself 
the following questions:
• What devices will connect to the network? The number 
of devices, as well as the operating system or platform 
on which the devices operate will determine the speed 
and strength needed to run your wireless network.
• How large of a range do you need, and where will 
most of the use take place? If you have a small apart-
ment, your needs will differ from those with a large home.
• How many users typically will be ­using the ­network, 
how will they use it, and for what ­purposes? The 
number of users affects the ­capabilities of the 
­network and determines ­whether you need to define 
permissions for certain users or devices.
• How secure do you need your network? ­Hiding the 
network name, requiring passwords, or ­having a user 
with network administration ­capabilities can help 
ensure your network is safe from ­unauthorized use.
A home network can be as simple as using a cable 
to connect two devices. More complex home networks 
include wireless technologies that connect several 
devices to one another and to the Internet. Hardware 
needed for a wireless, Internet-connected home 
network includes the following:
• A modem, such as a cable or DSL modem, that 
connects to an ISP and establishes the Internet 
­connection for the network
• A router, which establishes the connection between 
the Internet and all computers and devices on the 
home network and also enables the devices to 
­communicate with one another
• A wireless access point, often included as part of the 
router, in order to connect wireless devices
• Computers and devices, such as desktops, laptops, 
­tablets, smartphones, televisions, cable set-top boxes, or 
a VoIP phone, that you connect to the home network

Create a Home Network
If you have multiple computers and mobile 
devices in your home and want to share 
resources, you can create a home network. 
The following steps describe how to create a 
home network:
1.	 Establish a connection to the Internet. In 
many cases, your ISP will provide a modem 
that serves as the connection between 
the computers and mobile devices in your 
home and the Internet connection.
2.	 Most modems allow you to connect only 
one computer or mobile device and may not 
have the capability to serve also as a wireless 
access point. If you intend to use more than 
one computer or mobile device with your 
Internet connection, purchase and connect a 
router with a sufficient number of ports and 
then connect it to the modem. If you want 
wireless access in your home, purchase and 
connect a wireless router or mobile hot spot.
3.	 For computers that will use a wired network 
connection, connect a network cable from the 
computer to an available port on the router.
4.	 Follow the router’s instructions to configure 
it. If you are configuring wireless access, you 
may need to perform the following steps:
a.	 Set an SSID to uniquely identify your 
wireless network.
b.	 Select an encryption method and 
choose an encryption key that will be 
easy for you to remember but very 
­difficult for others to guess.
c.	 Connect the wireless devices to the 
network by enabling the wireless card 
if necessary, selecting the SSID of your 
wireless network, and specifying the 
proper encryption key. Read How To 5-3 
in Chapter 5 for additional information 
about SSIDs and encryption methods.
5.	 Test the connection on all devices, whether 
wired or wireless, that are connected to the 
network. You can verify that your network 
is working properly by running a browser 
and navigating to a webpage.
6.	 If desired, enable file sharing so that you can 
share files among the computers and mobile 
devices on your home network. Operating 
systems today typically include a feature 
that allows you to enable sharing with other 
computers on the same network. For another 
computer or mobile device to access shared 
files on your computer, the user will need 
to know the IP address or name of your 
­computer, as well as the location of the files.
7.	 For maximum security, disable Internet 
and network connections when you are 
not using them.

benefits of creating a home network? What 
disadvantages might be associated with

you can create user names and user groups. Names and 
groups establish network users, who can share files (such 
as documents, music, and photos), as well as devices 
(such as printers), with others connected to the network.
Maintaining the network involves monitoring the 
security settings and network activity, establishing 
connections to new devices as needed, and enhancing 
the wireless signal if necessary. Wireless home network 
speeds and ranges vary. The strength of the wireless signal 
affects the range of the network. Read How To 10-3 earlier

Transmission Media
Transmission media consist of ­materials 
or substances capable of carrying one 
or more ­communications signals. When 
you send data from a computer or 
mobile device, the signal that carries the 
data may travel over various transmis-
sion media. This is especially true when 
the transmission spans a long distance. 
Figure 10-19 illustrates the variety of 
transmission media, including both 
physical and wireless, used to complete a 
data request over the Internet. Although 
many media and devices are involved, 
the entire communications process could 
take less than one second.
Broadband media transmit multiple 
signals simultaneously. The amount 
of data, instructions, and information 
that can travel over transmission media 
sometimes is called the bandwidth. The 
higher the bandwidth, the more data 
transmitted. For transmission of text 
only, a lower bandwidth is acceptable. 
For transmission of music, ­graphics, 
­photos, virtual reality images, or 3-D 
games, however, you need a higher 
bandwidth. When the bandwidth is too 
low for the application, you will notice 
a considerable slowdown in system 
­performance.
Latency, with respect to 
­communications, is the time it takes a 
signal to travel from one location to 
another on a network. Several factors that 
negatively can affect latency include the 
distance between the two points, the type 
of transmission media, and the number of 
nodes through which the data must travel 
over the network. For best performance, 
bandwidth should be high and latency 
low. Read Ethics & Issues 10-3 to consider 
whether ISPs should be able to control 
Internet usage.

Physical Transmission Media
Physical transmission media use wire, cable, and other 
tangible materials to send ­communications signals. These 
wires and cables typically are used underground or within 
or between buildings. Ethernet and token ring LANs often 
use physical transmission media.
Table 10-3 lists the transfer rates of LANs using various 
physical transmission media. The ­following sections discuss 
each of these types.
Twisted-Pair Cable
One of the more widely used transmission media for 
network cabling and landline phone systems is twisted-
pair cable. Twisted-pair cable consists of one or more 
­twisted-pair wires bundled together (Figure 10-20). Each 
twisted-pair wire consists of two separate insulated cop-
per wires that are twisted together. The wires are twisted 
together to reduce noise, which is an electrical disturbance 
that can degrade communications.
Ethics & Issues 10-3
Should ISPs Be Allowed to Control 
Your Internet Usage?
People often compare the early days of the 
Internet and web to a wild frontier. ISPs simply 
offered customers an Internet connection and 
exerted no control over how the customer used 
the connection. This is similar to a phone com-
pany, which does not control who a customer 
calls, the length of a call, or the reason for the 
call. Online gaming, VoIP, video and audio stream-
ing, and the use of web apps and cloud services 
led to an increased reliance on the Internet. 
Because of these increases, ISPs are attempting to 
regulate and limit their customers’ usage.
Capping is a practice ISPs use that provides 
a certain amount of data usage at the optimal 
speed. Once a customer has used his or her 
allotted amount, the customer’s Internet access 
is restricted, is slowed, or incurs additional 
costs. Throttling occurs when a network reduces 
upload and download speeds of certain high-
data users at peak times in order not to tie up 
network resources for a small pool of users.
Controversy surrounds capping and 
throttling practices. Providers argue that 
caps are necessary to regulate traffic and 
ensure equal access to the Internet for all of 
its users. Critics argue that ISPs use limits to 
unfairly increase customer fees. Legislators are 
attempting to resolve the issues surrounding 
net neutrality, which is the concept of an 
open Internet, accessible to all users, without 
interference from ISPs or other third-parties. 
Proposals include standardizing how data 
transfer rates are measured and involving the 
Federal Communications Commission (FCC). 
The FCC would evaluate the regulations to 
ensure that ISPs intend merely to regulate 
traffic, rather than make a profit. It would 
examine whether caps or throttling are 
appropriate for low-usage times, such as in the 
middle of the night, and other related issues.
Consider This: Should ISPs control your 
Internet usage? Why or why not? Are data 
caps at peak usage times reasonable? Why 
or why not? Should the government enforce 
net neutrality? Why or why not?

Coaxial Cable
Coaxial cable, often referred to as coax 
(pronounced KO-ax), consists of a single 
copper wire surrounded by at least three lay-
ers: (1) an insulating material, (2) a woven or 
braided metal, and (3) a plastic outer coating 
(Figure 10-21).
CATV network wiring often uses coaxial 
cable because it can be cabled over longer 
distances than twisted-pair cable. Most of 
today’s computer networks, however, do not 
use coaxial cable because other transmission 
media, such as fiber-optic cable, transmit 
­signals at faster rates.
Fiber-Optic Cable
The core of a fiber-optic cable consists 
of dozens or hundreds of thin strands of 
glass or ­plastic that use light to transmit 
­signals. Each strand, called an optical fiber, 
is as thin as a human hair. Inside the fiber-optic cable, an insulating glass cladding and a 
­protective coating surround each optical fiber (Figure 10-22).
Fiber-optic cables have the following advantages over cables that use wire, such as twisted-pair 
and coaxial cables:
•  Capability of carrying significantly more 
signals than wire cables
•  Faster data transmission
•  Less susceptible to noise (interference) 
from other devices, such as a copy machine
•  Better security for signals during 
transmission because they are less 
susceptible to noise
•  Smaller size (much thinner and lighter 
weight)
Disadvantages of fiber-optic cable are it 
costs more than twisted-pair or coaxial cable 
and can be difficult to install and modify. 
Despite these limitations, many phone 
­companies replaced original analog phone 
lines with fiber-optic cables, enabling them 
to offer fiber-optic Internet access to home 
and business users. Businesses also use fiber-
optic cables in high-traffic networks or as the 
­backbone in a network.
Wireless Transmission Media
Wireless transmission media send communications signals through the air or space. Many users 
opt for wireless transmission media because it is more convenient than installing cables. In addi-
tion to convenience, businesses use wireless transmission media in locations where it is impossible 
to install cables. Read How To 10-5 for instructions about adding a printer to a wireless network.

Types of wireless transmission media used in 
­communications include infrared, broadcast radio, 
­cellular radio, microwaves, and communications satellites. 
Table 10-4 lists transfer rates of various wireless transmis-
sion media, which are discussed in the following sections.
Infrared
As discussed earlier in the chapter, infrared (IR) is a 
wireless transmission medium that sends signals using 
infrared light waves. Mobile computers and devices, such 
as a mouse, printer, and smartphone, may have an IrDA 
port that enables the transfer of data from one device to 
another using infrared light waves.
Broadcast Radio
Broadcast radio is a wireless transmission medium 
that distributes radio signals through the air over long 
distances, such as between cities, regions, and countries, 
and short distances, such as within an office or home.
For radio transmissions, you need a transmitter to 
send the broadcast radio signal and a receiver to accept 
it. To receive the broadcast radio signal, the receiver 
has an antenna that is located in the range of the signal. 
Some networks use a transceiver, which both sends and receives signals from wireless devices. 
Broadcast radio is slower and more susceptible to noise than physical transmission media, but it 
provides flexibility and portability.
Bluetooth, UWB, and Wi-Fi communications technologies discussed earlier in this chapter 
use broadcast radio signals. Bluetooth and UWB are alternatives to infrared communications, 
with the latter designed for high-bandwidth transmissions. Hot spots use Wi-Fi.
Add a Wireless Printer to a Home/Small 
Office Network
Adding a wireless printer to a home or 
small office network has several advan-
tages. For example, multiple computers and 
mobile devices on the network can use 
the printer. You also can place the printer 
anywhere in the home or office, as long 
as it is within range of the wireless signal. 
For example, a wireless router can be on 
the first floor of your house, and a wireless 
printer can be on the second floor. The fol-
lowing steps describe how to add a wire-
less printer to a home/small office network:
1.	 Determine the location to install the 
­wireless printer. This location must have 
an electrical outlet for the printer and also 
be within range of the wireless network. 
You can check the strength of wireless 
signals in your home or office by walking 
around with a mobile computer or device 
while connected to the network and 
monitoring the signal strength.
2.	 Be sure to place the printer on a stable 
surface.
3.	 Access the printer’s settings and navigate 
to the network settings.
4.	 Connect to the wireless network in your 
home or small office. If necessary, specify 
the encryption key for your network.
5.	 Enter any remaining required information.
6.	 Install the printer software on the 
computer(s) from which you want to print 
to the wireless printer. During the instal-
lation process, you will select the wireless 
printer that you have connected and 
configured. If the printer does not appear, 
return to Step 4 and try connecting the 
printer to the wireless network again. If 
the problem persists, consider contacting 
the printer’s manufacturer.
7.	 Verify the computers are able to print 
­successfully to the wireless printer.
  Consider This: What are some ways to 
­prevent some computers or mobile devices on 
your network from printing on your wireless 
printer?

Cellular Radio
Cellular radio is a form of broadcast radio that is in wide use for mobile communications, 
specifically wireless modems and mobile phones (Figure 10-23). A mobile phone uses high-­
frequency radio waves to transmit voice and digital data messages. Because only a limited 
number of radio frequencies exist, mobile service providers reuse frequencies so that they can 
accommodate the large number of users. Some users install an amplifier or booster to improve 
the signal strength. Read Secure IT 10-4 to consider issues related to fake cell towers.

Fake Cell Towers Are Tracking Devices
At least 17 cell towers located throughout 
the United States are intercepting mobile 
phone calls, according to technical security 
company ESD America. The company has 
identified these towers but does not know 
who owns them. It does know, however, 
that they do not belong to a mobile ser-
vice provider or to the National Security 
Agency (NSA).
Every mobile device has a unique 
International Mobile Subscriber Identity 
(IMSI ) that allows it to communicate with 
a cell tower. The interceptor technology on 
fake towers grasps, or catches, this IMSI 
signal; hence, it is known as an IMSI catcher. 
According to some reports, cyberthieves can 
purchase IMSI catchers for $1,800 or can 
build the devices themselves. The interceptors, 
also called stingrays, slow the protocol, so 
consumers may notice that the display on their 
smartphone shows that the 4G connection 
has dropped to 2G and that the performance 
has degraded. Higher-quality interceptors, 
however, will not change the phone’s display 
when the phone has been attacked.
The Federal Communications Commission 
(FCC) is investigating these fake towers to 
determine who or what entity is intercepting 
the calls. It has established a task force to 
protect cellular networks and to address 
the threat of illicit IMSI catcher technology. 
It also is working with several industry 
organizations to develop new, secure 
cybersecurity standards. In addition, the FCC 
urges consumers to update their mobile 
devices’ operating systems and apps because 
the latest software often addresses security 
vulnerabilities.
  Consider This: Have you read any 
articles or publications disclosing the illicit 
and unauthorized use of IMSI catchers? Who 
or what organization do you think is using 
these interceptors?

force customers to switch from landlines to mobile phones.
Ethics & Issues 10-4
Should Phone Companies Be Allowed 
to Force Customers to Switch from 
Landlines to Mobile Phones?
Many people today rely solely on a mobile 
phone and have no need for a traditional 
landline installed in their home. A mobile 
phone enables users to keep their same 
phone number if they move and ensures 
that they can receive communications when 
not at home. Around 100 million Americans 
still rely on a landline for phone access, 
especially in rural areas. As the copper lines 
that connect these phones deteriorate from 
age and rust, phone companies are push-
ing customers to purchase VoIP or mobile 
­services instead of a landline.
Critics of these measures cite that mobile 
phones are less reliable in certain areas and 
during extended power failures, and may 
or may not properly connect to emergency 
services. The elderly and people with certain 
illnesses rely on medical devices that use a 
landline to send medical information or alerts. 
The FCC (Federal Communications Commission) 
would need to approve the phone companies’ 
plans to eliminate landline service. Because of 
rules known as ‘common carrier’ guidelines, 
phone companies must provide phone access 
to all users, at a fair price. Different pricing 
rules exist for Internet usage and mobile 
phones, which some fear may lead phone 
companies to raise prices unfairly.
Phone companies argue that the current 
landlines are expensive to maintain. Many 
feel that they have a right to refuse to repair, 
install, or continue service to areas for which 
they do not see a profit. They argue that uses 
of satellites and Internet technologies can 
provide service to even the most rural areas. 
Two major phone providers have proposed 
eliminating landline service by 2020.
Consider This: Do you have a landline? 
Why or why not? Should phone companies 
require users to switch to mobile phones? 
Why or why not? Should the government 
force phone companies to provide service 
without a profit? Why or why not?

Microwaves
Microwaves are radio waves that provide a high-speed signal transmission. Microwave 
­transmission, often called fixed wireless, involves sending signals from one microwave station 
to another (Figure 10-24). A microwave station is an earth-based reflective dish that contains 
the antenna, transceivers, and other equipment necessary for microwave communications. As 
with infrared, microwaves use line-of-sight transmission. To avoid possible obstructions, such 
as buildings or mountains, microwave stations often sit on the tops of buildings, towers, or 
­mountains.
Microwave transmission typically is used in environments where installing physical 
­transmission media is difficult or impossible and where line-of-sight transmission is avail-
able. For example, microwave transmission is used in wide-open areas, such as deserts or lakes, 
between buildings in a close geographic area, or to communicate with a satellite. Current users 
of microwave transmission include universities, hospitals, city governments, CATV providers, 
and phone companies. Homes and small businesses that do not have other high-speed Internet 
connections available in their area also opt for lower-cost fixed wireless plans.

microwave communications.

Communications Satellite
A communications satellite is a space station that receives microwave signals from an 
­e­arth-based station, amplifies (strengthens) the signals, and broadcasts the signals back over 
a wide area to any number of earth-based stations (Figure 10-25). These earth-based stations 
often are microwave stations. Other devices, such as smartphones and GPS receivers, also can 
function as earth-based stations. Transmission from an earth-based station to a satellite is an 
uplink. Transmission from a satellite to an earth-based station is a downlink.
Applications such as air navigation, television and radio broadcasts, weather forecasting, 
­videoconferencing, paging, GPS, and Internet connections use communications satellites. With 
the proper satellite dish and a satellite modem, consumers can access the Internet using satellite 
technology. With satellite Internet connections, however, uplink transmissions usually are slower

GPS  As described previously, a GPS (global positioning system) is a navigation system that 
­consists of one or more earth-based receivers that accept and analyze signals sent by satellites 
in order to determine the receiver’s geographic location.
Many mobile devices, such as smartphones, have GPS capability built into the device or as an 
add-on feature. Some users carry a handheld GPS receiver; others mount a receiver to an object 
such as an automobile, a boat, an airplane, farm and construction equipment, or a ­computer 
or mobile device. A GPS receiver is a handheld, mountable, or embedded device that contains 
an antenna, a radio receiver, and a processor. Many include a screen display that shows an 
­individual’s location on a map. Figure 10-26 shows how a GPS works.

than downlink transmissions. This difference in speeds usually is acceptable to most Internet 
satellite users because they download much more data than they upload. Although a satellite 
Internet connection is more expensive than cable Internet or DSL connections, sometimes it is 
the only high-speed Internet option in remote areas.

What are uses of GPS?
The first and most used application of GPS technology is to assist people with determining where they are located. 
The data obtained from a GPS, however, can be applied to a variety of other uses: creating a map, ascertaining the 
best route between two points, locating a lost person or stolen object, monitoring the movement of a person or 
object, determining altitude, and calculating speed.
Many vehicles use GPSs to provide drivers with directions or other information, such as alternate traffic routes, 
automatically call for help if the airbag is deployed, dispatch roadside assistance, unlock the driver’s side door if 
keys are locked in the car, and track the vehicle if it is stolen. Newer GPS receivers also give drivers information 
about nearby points of interest, such as gas stations, restaurants, and hotels. Hikers and remote campers may carry 
GPS receivers in case they need emergency help or directions.
Some GPS receivers work in conjunction with a cellular radio network. Parents, for example, can locate the 
whereabouts of a child who carries a mobile phone with GPS capability or other GPS-enabled device.
How a GPS Works
Other Examples of GPS Receivers
Step 1
GPS satellites orbit Earth. Every thousandth of a second,
each satellite sends a signal that indicates its current
position to a GPS receiver.
Step 2
A GPS receiver (such as in a car, a smartphone, a wearable device, a handheld device, or a dog collar)
determines its location on Earth by analyzing at least 3 separate satellite signals from the 24 satellites in orbit.

Agriculture
The world’s dependence on the agriculture 
industry is enormous. The demand to keep 
food prices affordable encourages those 
working in this industry to operate as effi-
ciently as possible. Although people have 
worked in agriculture for more than 10,000 
years, advances in technology assist with 
maintaining and protecting land and crops.
Almost all individuals and organizations 
in this industry have many acres of land that 
they must maintain. It is not always feasible 
for farmers to take frequent trips around 
the property to perform basic tasks, such as 
watering soil in the absence of rain. The number 
of people-hours required to water soil manually 
on several thousand acres of land might result 
in businesses spending thousands of dollars in 
labor and utility costs. If an irrigation system is 
installed instead, one or more individuals still 
are responsible for deciding when to water 
and how long to water. If the irrigation process 
is automated, sensors detect how much rain 
has fallen recently, as well as whether the soil 
is in need of watering. The sensors then send 
this data to a computer that processes it and 
decides when and how much to water. Many 
automated home irrigation systems also are 
programmable and use rain sensors, which 
regulate operation of the irrigation system.
In addition to keeping the soil moist and 
reducing maintenance costs, computers also 
can use sensors to analyze the condition of 
crops in the field and determine whether 
pests or diseases are affecting the crops. 
If sensors detect pests and/or diseases, 
computers send a notification to the 
appropriate individual to take corrective 
action. In some cases, the discovery of pests 
might trigger a pesticide to discharge in the 
affected area automatically.
Until recently, the lack of adequate cellular 
and wireless network signals in the fields 
made communications difficult for farmers. 
Mobile cellular antennas and amplifiers 
stretch mobile broadband coverage across 
entire farms, enabling farmers to receive 
wireless signals up to eight times farther from 
the cellular tower than they would without 
the antennas and amplifiers. Wireless access 
throughout the farm also allows farmers to 
monitor their farms and communicate with 
colleagues from remote locations.
The next time you take a bite of a delicious 
carrot or juicy cucumber, you can appreciate 
how technology has helped to maintain an 
ideal environment for these vegetables to 
grow and protected them from unwanted 
pests, all for a reasonable price when you 
purchase them from your local supermarket.

­computers and technology be used in the 
agriculture industry?

1	 Evaluate Internet Access Plans
If you are planning to connect to the Internet from 
your computer or mobile device, you will need to 
subscribe to an Internet access plan. Cable companies, 
phone companies, and mobile service providers all 
offer Internet access plans, so it is important to evalu-
ate the plans in your area to determine which one is 
best for you. The following steps guide you through 
the process of evaluating Internet access plans.
a. Create a budget. Internet access plans are available for 
a monthly fee, so determine how much money you are 
able to spend for Internet access on a monthly basis.
b. Locate and list the Internet access plans available in 
your area. To determine Internet access plans that are 
available, check the local cable or phone company’s 
website and search for available plans. You may have 
to enter your ZIP code to determine whether certain 
plans are available in your area. Alternatively, visit 
a local electronics store and inquire about wireless 
Internet access plans available in your area.
c. Compare Internet access speeds. Each Internet 
access plan may offer a different speed, so determine 
which speed is sufficient for you. If you mainly 
browse webpages and send or receive email 
messages, you may not need a plan that offers 
the fastest transfer rates. If you plan to download 
files, play online games, and watch movies on the 
Internet, you should consider a plan with faster 
transfer rates. You also should consider a plan with 
faster transfer rates if you will have multiple devices 
accessing the Internet simultaneously in your 
household. If an ISP offers multiple plans with a 
variety of transfer rates, it often will let you switch 
back and forth between plans without penalty so 
that you can find the one with the transfer rate that 
is best for you.
d. Check for package deals. If you already have service 
with an existing CATV or phone provider, they 
may be able to add Internet access to your current 
services at a reduced rate. Bundling multiple 
services can make each service (such as Internet 
access) less expensive, but you should be careful not 
to sign up for services you do not need.
e. Think about how much data you intend to transfer 
each month. Some Internet access plans limit the 
amount of data you can upload or download each 
month. While it can be difficult to determine 
how much data you will upload or download, you 
first should purchase a plan that might allow you 
to transfer more than you think you will need. 
Monitor your data usage each month and consider 
downgrading to a plan that provides the amount of 
data transfer that better represents your use.
f. Determine where you require Internet access. 
Some ISPs will allow you to use their hot spots 
for free in locations such as shopping malls, 
coffeehouses, and airports. Consider the additional 
locations from where you can access the Internet 
for free, and determine whether it makes the 
Internet access plan more desirable.
g. Consider whether a wireless Internet access plan is 
appropriate. While these plans can cost more and 
transfer rates often are not as fast, they do provide 
the flexibility of allowing you to connect to the 
Internet from almost anywhere. If you often travel 
and regularly need to access the Internet while 
away from home, a wireless Internet access plan 
might be right for you.
Exercises
1. What Internet access plans are available in your area?
2. Prepare a table comparing the Internet access plans in 
your area. Based on your current Internet usage, which 
plan appears to be the best? Why?
3. How can you determine approximately how much data 
you will transfer each month?
2	 Locate Hot Spots
If you are using a mobile computer or device and need 
to access the Internet, you will need to locate a hot 
spot. Hot spots are available in a variety of locations, 
such as coffeehouses, shopping malls, public librar-
ies, airports, and educational institutions. Once you 
locate a hot spot, be sure to use it safely. Read Secure 
IT 2-1 in Chapter 2 for more information about using 
public Wi-Fi hot spots safely. If you plan to connect 
Instructions: You often can complete tasks using technology in multiple ways. Figure out how to perform the tasks described in these exercises 
by using one or more resources available to you (such as a computer or mobile device, articles on the web or in print, online or program help, user 
guides, blogs, podcasts, videos, other individuals, trial and error, etc.). Summarize your ‘how to’ steps, along with the resource(s) used, in the format 
requested by your instructor (brief report, presentation, discussion, blog post, video, or other means).

Chapter 10  Communicating Digital Content
to a wireless hot spot, make sure you are authorized 
to connect. For example, you should not connect to 
people’s or businesses’ hot spots without their knowl-
edge or consent. If you are unsure of whether you are 
authorized to connect to a hot spot, contact someone 
representing the residence or business providing the 
hot spot. The following are guidelines that can assist 
you in locating a hot spot:
• Enable (turn on) your mobile computer or device’s 
Wi-Fi and see whether it automatically detects any 
wireless networks. If one or more wireless networks 
are detected, connect to the one with the SSID that 
accurately describes your location. For example, if you 
are at a coffeehouse, the SSID of the wireless network 
might be the coffeehouse’s name. If you unsure of 
the wireless network to which you should connect, 
contact an employee at the location and inquire. If 
the wireless network is protected with a password, the 
employee may be able to provide the password.
• You can check the location’s website or app in 
advance to determine whether it has free Wi-Fi. 
For example, if you are flying out of your local 
airport, the airport’s website might indicate 
whether Wi-Fi is available.
• Businesses offering free Wi-Fi sometimes have a 
decal on a front door or window indicating the 
location has Wi-Fi. If necessary, contact an employee 
to determine how to connect to the wireless network.
• Search for and navigate 
to a website that lists 
Wi-Fi hot spots in a 
particular area. These 
websites sometimes 
do not provide the 
most up-to-date 
information, so do not 
rely completely on the 
information you locate.
Exercises
1. What public hot spots are available near where you live?
2. Have you connected to a public hot spot before? If so, 
when?
3. What security risks may be associated with connecting 
to a public hot spot?
3	 Test Your Internet Speed
Internet connection speeds will vary depending on the 
type of Internet connection you currently are using. 
If you believe your Internet speed is not what was 
­promised by your Internet access provider, you can 
test your Internet speed to see how it is performing. 
The following steps guide you through the process of 
testing your Internet speed:
a. Turn off any computers or mobile devices that 
might be accessing the Internet, except for 
the computer on which you want to test your 
broadband speed.
b. If your broadband Internet service is provided 
through your phone company, do not talk on the 
phone during the test. If your CATV company 
provides your broadband Internet service, turn 
off all devices accessing the cable television. If 
you have cable boxes or converters, disconnect 
them from their power source so that they cannot 
communicate using the Internet connection while 
you are testing your broadband speed.
c. Run the browser.
d. Search for and navigate to a website that can test 
your Internet speed.
e. Tap or click the button to start the test. The test 
may take up to one minute to complete before 
displaying results.
f. Internet speeds sometimes can vary with the time of 
day or day of the week. Repeat the previous steps to 
test your Internet speed at various times throughout 
the day, as well as on weekdays and weekends.
g. If you have any concerns regarding your Internet 
speed, contact your Internet access provider.
Exercises
1. What is the speed of the Internet connection on the 
computer or mobile device you currently are using?
2. Test your Internet speed while other computers and 
mobile devices also are using the Internet connection. 
How do the results vary from when your other devices 
are turned off?
3. Do you see differences in the Internet speed when you 
test it during the day versus at night? If so, what might 
explain these differences in speed?

between computers and mobile devices via Bluetooth. 
Before you are able to transfer files between devices, 
you first must enable Bluetooth and pair the devices so 
that they can communicate.
Connecting Your Computer and Mobile Device
The following steps guide you through the process 
of connecting your computer and mobile device via 
Bluetooth:
a. If necessary, display the settings on your computer 
and enable (turn on) Bluetooth.
b. If necessary, display the settings on your mobile device 
and enable (turn on) Bluetooth. Configure the mobile 
device so that it is discoverable to other Bluetooth 
devices. The mobile device must be discoverable so 
that your computer will be able to locate it.
c. In the Bluetooth settings on the computer, select 
the option to add a device.
d. When the computer has finished locating nearby 
discoverable Bluetooth devices, select your mobile 
device.
e. When the devices communicate with each other, 
the computer will display a passcode. Enter the 
passcode into your mobile device to complete the 
pairing, or verify the passcode on the computer 
and the mobile device match. The steps required to 
connect Bluetooth devices will vary, depending on 
the types of devices and operating system in use. Be 
sure to follow all instructions on the screen while 
connecting the computer to the mobile device.
Exchanging Files between Devices
When the computer and mobile device have been paired 
successfully, you are able to transfer files between the 
devices. The following steps guide you through the process 
of exchanging files between devices.
Transferring Files from a Mobile Device to a Computer
a. Display the file on the mobile device that you want 
to transfer to the computer.
b. Tap the button to share the file.
c. Select the option to share the file via Bluetooth.
d. Select the device to which you want to send the file.
e. Tap the button to begin the transfer.
f. On the computer, verify that you want to receive 
the incoming file. If necessary, specify a name and 
location for the file.
g. When the file has finished transferring, locate 
the file and open it so that you can verify it has 
transferred properly.
Transferring Files from a Computer to a Mobile Device
a. Display the location containing the file you want  
to transfer to the mobile device.
b. Select the file you want to transfer to the mobile 
device.
c. Select the command to send the file via Bluetooth 
(this command may be on a shortcut menu, so you 
may need to press and hold or right-click the file).
d. Select the device to which you want to send 
the file.
e. On the mobile device, verify that you want to 
receive the incoming file and, if necessary, specify a 
name and location for the file.
f. When the file has finished transferring, locate 
the file and open it so that you can verify it has 
transferred properly.
When you have finished transferring files between your 
computer and mobile device, disable Bluetooth if you do 
not intend to use it.
Exercises
1. In addition to using Bluetooth to connect a computer 
to a mobile device, what other types of devices can you 
connect to your mobile device?
2. Are any risks associated with leaving Bluetooth 
enabled (turned on) even when you are not using it?
3. What types of files might you want to transfer 
between your computer and mobile device using 
Bluetooth?

1	 Making Use of the Web 
Blogs, Wikis, and Collaboration
Writers can publish their views and share their interests 
using blogs, as you learned in Chapter 2. The blogo-
sphere began as an easy way for individuals to express 
their opinions on the web. Today, this communications 
vehicle has become a powerful tool for individuals, 
groups, and corporations to promote their ideas and to 
advertise their products. Individuals easily may set up 
a blog free or for a fee, and they do not need to have 
knowledge of web design or programming.
Wikis are collaborative websites. As discussed in 
Chapter 2, users can develop, modify, and delete content 
on these public or private websites. This information 
can include articles, documents, photos, and videos. 
Other collaboration websites, such as Google Docs, 
allow users to share documents and to work together in 
real time. All files are stored online, so participants can 
access these documents everywhere at any time.
Research This: (a) Visit two blogging services, 
such as Tumblr, WordPress, or Blogger. What steps 
are ­required to start a blog? Do these services have 
­monthly or annual fees? Do storage limitations exist? 
What options are available to customize the design? 
Can products or services be sold or advertised? If you 
were to set up a blog, which topics would you cover? 
Could you assign your own domain name to your blog?
(b) Visit two reference wikis. Which subjects are 
featured? Which organizations host the websites? How 
are the wikis funded? Are they public or private? Who 
may edit the content? What procedure is used to add, 
modify, or delete information?
(c) Visit two collaboration websites. What features 
are available for sharing content, such as managing 
projects, scheduling, blogging, discussing forum topics, 
publishing information, delivering announcements, or 
uploading photos and videos? Are chat windows and 
whiteboards offered? What is the charge for using these 
services? Do they offer a mobile app? Do ­members 
receive notifications when content is updated?
2	 Social Media
Using social media can be an excellent opportunity 
to unite with people who share similar interests. In 
some cases, local groups form for members to improve 
themselves and their communities. Dog owners, run-
ners, photographers, entrepreneurs, parents, and 
travelers are among the thousands of groups with 
members who met online. In addition, more than 41 
million people in the United States have subscribed to 
at least one of the 2,500 online dating services. Online 
dating can offer a safe opportunity to meet a variety of 
people if some practical advice is followed. Reputable 
dating services keep information confidential and have 
many members. Some have niche dating demograph-
ics, such as age, professions, religion, cultural interests, 
or geographical regions, and members can search for 
matches with desired criteria.
Research This: Search at least two online dating 
­websites for information about these services. How 
many members do they have? What is the cost to join? 
What are the monthly membership fees? What claims 
do their privacy statements make about not disclosing 
personal information? What policies are in place to 
report members who have acted inappropriately?
3	 Search Skills 
Map Search
Search engines provide capabilities to search for maps, 
directions, and local attractions. Type search text in a 
search engine and then tap or click the Maps link on 
a search engine’s home page to see a map of locations 
for your search text. For example, type the search text, 
verizon wireless chicago, in the search box to find loca-
tions of Verizon Wireless stores in Chicago. Type the 
search text, cisco boston, to view the location of the 
Boston Cisco office on a map. To obtain directions, 
type the address to or from which to obtain directions, 
and specify walking, driving, or by public transporta-
tion. On mobile devices with GPS ­capability, you can

specify to use your current location as a starting or 
ending location. You also can search near a location. 
For example, type the search text, pizza near 125 high 
street boston, to display the names of pizza restaurants 
near that location. Some mapping search tools allow 
you to zoom, pan, and navigate a map in aerial view or 
street view, showing the location when looking from 
above or on the street.
Research This: Create search text using the techniques 
described above or in previous Search Skills exercises, 
and type it in a search engine to create maps that provide 
this information: (1) aerial and street view of your home, 
(2) directions to a local store that sells wireless networking 
equipment, (3) locations of your mobile service provider’s 
retail stores in your current city, and (4) distance between 
Microsoft’s headquarters in Redmond, Washington and 
Apple’s headquarters in Cupertino, California. Take 
­screenshots to capture and document your results.
4	 Security
The Social Media exercise in this section discusses 
online dating websites. According to some of these 
dating services, 20 percent of people currently in com-
mitted relationships met online. While using these 
dating websites may result in a positive experience, the 
Better Business Bureau and other consumer-oriented 
organizations receive thousands of complaints each 
year about these services. Online dating fraud is rising, 
so security experts caution online dating members to 
follow safe practices, including the following:
• Compose a profile carefully, and be certain it reflects 
the image you want to portray. Do not post your full 
name, phone number, or home or work location.
• Use the service’s messaging system before 
sending email or text messages or having a phone 
conversation.
• When arranging a first date, meet in a safe location, 
such as a restaurant during a busy time of the day. 
Share your plans with a friend, and keep a mobile 
phone handy.
• Trust your instincts. If you feel uncomfortable or 
threatened, leave the location and call a friend.
Research This: Visit at least two websites providing 
advice for online dating members. What guidance is 
provided in addition to the four safe practices listed 
above? What behaviors may signal potentially danger-
ous situations? Where can members verify other mem-
bers’ reputations? How can members report fraud and 
inappropriate behavior?
5	 Cloud Services 
Streaming Media from the Cloud (SaaS)
Streaming media allows users to play music or videos 
from the cloud without having to wait for the entire 
file to download. Streaming media is an example of 
software as a service (SaaS), a service of cloud comput-
ing that allows access to software apps using a browser, 
without the need to install software on a computer or 
device. Streaming media has become popular because 
of the decreasing cost of cloud storage; the increasing 
download speeds for business, home, and mobile users; 
and the growing number of devices available to play 
downloaded content.
When streaming, a provider sends the media to the 
user’s device over the Internet in a compressed format. 
The user runs a media player app to uncompress the 
data as it arrives and then play the resulting audio data 
as sound; or, the user can display the resulting video 
data on mobile devices, computers, Smart TVs, and 
other devices that have an appropriate player.
Content providers, such as Netflix, Hulu, and 
Amazon, allow users to subscribe to their services for a 
monthly fee and watch videos on demand, or instantly, 
by streaming them to Internet-connected devices.
Individuals and businesses use streaming services to 
broadcast video of their events live, on the Internet in 
high definition. Many will use this service to broadcast 
presentations, product demonstrations, performances, 
and other events online.
Research This: (1) What file formats are used 
to ­compress audio and video files for streaming? 
(2) Compare the offerings of Netflix, Hulu, and 
Amazon for providing video on demand. Do you use 
any of these services? Which would you choose? Why? 
(3) Find a television or radio broadcast that is streamed 
live on the Internet and simultaneously broadcast “on 
air.” Watch or listen to part of the live stream and then 
do the same for the broadcast on television or radio. 
How do the experiences and ­quality compare? What 
other events often are streamed live online?

Critical Thinking
Instructions: Evaluate the situations below, using personal experiences and one or more resources available to you (such as articles on the web or 
in print, blogs, podcasts, videos, television, user guides, other individuals, electronics or computer stores, etc.). Perform the tasks requested in each 
­exercise and share your deliverables in the format requested by your instructor (brief report, presentation, discussion, blog post, video, or other means).
The Critical Thinking exercises challenge your assessment and decision-making skills by 
­presenting real-world situations associated with chapter concepts. The Collaboration 
­exercise should be completed with a team.
1.		Transmission Media  
You work as an intern in the IT department for a local 
newspaper. The newspaper’s management team recently 
approved a budget for redesigning the interior of its 
century-old building as part of an urban rehabilitation 
project. Because the employees at the newspaper more 
often use mobile devices and laptops than desktops, the 
newspaper plans to set up a wireless LAN.
Do This: Prepare information that summarizes the 
issues surrounding wireless network setup. Include 
the following information: What hardware is required 
for a wireless network? Could the thick walls in the 
building present a problem? If so, how can the issue be 
resolved? Does a wireless network present any health 
hazards? What security concerns exist for a wireless 
network? What advantages does a wireless network 
have over a wired network for the newspaper’s needs?
2.	Wireless Networking Standards  
Several networking standards exist for wireless 
networks, including 802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g, 802.11n, 
802.11ac, 802.11ad, and 802.11af. You want to install a 
wireless network in your house and want to ensure that 
you choose the standard that best meets your needs.
Do This: Use the web to research the various ­wireless 
networking standards and answer the following 
­questions: Which was the first developed standard? Are 
any of the standards more susceptible to ­interference 
from other wireless devices in your home, such as 
alarm systems and mobile phones? Which standard is 
the fastest? Is the fastest standard always the best, or 
do other factors on your wireless network or on the 
­Internet affect performance? Is equipment to support  
one standard more expensive than the equipment 
that supports the other standards? Which would you 
recommend? Why? Address the answers to those 
questions, as well as any other information you find 
pertinent. Compile your findings.
3.	Case Study
Amateur Sports League  You are the new manager 
for a nonprofit amateur soccer league. The league’s 
office equipment consists of a few laptops and tablets, 
a printer, and several smartphones. The board of direc-
tors has asked you to investigate how the league might 
use Bluetooth technology in its offices.
Do This: Review the uses of Bluetooth technology 
listed in Mini Feature 10-2 in this chapter. Which uses 
might apply to the league? Can you think of other 
ways the league might use Bluetooth technology? 
What are the advantages of using Bluetooth technol-
ogy? Use the web to find industry experts’ recom-
mendations for Bluetooth use in a small office. What 
other wireless technologies might the league’s office 
use? Examine issues related to bandwidth, speed, and 
reliability. What security concerns exist? What mea-
sures should the league take to prevent Bluebugging? 
Would you recommend the league use Bluetooth in its 
offices? Why or why not? Should the league replace 
its LAN with Bluetooth? Why or why not? Compile 
your findings.
4.	Network Security  You are a network administrator for a small security firm. The company’s main office includes 
20 workers, most of whom use laptops. This year, the company plans to upgrade the network. The company asks your 
team to create a list of common network security issues, to make recommendations for hardware and software, and to 
create guidelines to secure the network.
Do This: Form a three-member team. As a team, list different networking security risks discussed in this chapter. 
Each member should choose a different risk to research. Members should determine the following: Describe the risk. 
Find an example of an industry article or blog post describing an experience with the risk. What damage was done? 
What steps did the network administrator take to recover from the damage, and/or prevent future attacks? What 
hardware or software can be used to safeguard against the risk? What guidelines for network users should be in place 
to help avoid the risk? As a team, compile your findings and share your recommendation with the class.

Databases, Data, and Information
As presented in Chapter 4, a database is a collection of data organized in a manner that allows 
access, retrieval, and use of that data. As discussed in previous chapters, data is a collection of 
unprocessed items, which can include text, numbers, images, audio, and video. Information is 
processed data; that is, it is organized, meaningful, and useful.
Computers process data in a database to generate information for users. A database at a 
school, for example, contains data about its students and classes. When students are accepted 
to a school, they typically complete an online admission form that is displayed as a form in a 
browser. Students type their personal information into an online form and, at a later date, stop 
by the school to have their photo taken. Upon submitting the form, the page uploads the stu-
dent’s personal information in a database on a server at the school. When the school takes the 
student’s photo, it also is stored in the school’s database. The school’s admission system assigns 
an ID number to the student and stores it in the database. The system then sends the student an 
email message with advising information. When the student’s photo is taken on campus, r­elevant 
information is sent to an ID card printer, where the student’s photo, name, and address is 
printed on the front of the card and the ID number is encoded on a magnetic stripe on the back 
of the card. Figure 11-1 illustrates this process.
With database software, often called a database management system (DBMS), users ­create 
a computerized database; add, modify, and delete data in the database; sort and retrieve data 
from the database; and create forms and reports from the data in the database.
After completing this chapter, you will be able to:
1	 Differentiate among a character, field, record, and data file and describe validation techniques
2	 Differentiate between file processing systems and the database approach
3	 Describe uses of web databases, types of databases, and Big Data
4	 Discuss functions common to most database management systems: data dictionary, file retrieval and 
maintenance, data security, and backup and recovery
5	 Define system development, list the system development phases, and identify the guidelines for system 
development
6	 Discuss the importance of project management, feasibility assessment, documentation, and data and 
information gathering techniques
7	 Discuss the purpose of and tasks conducted in each system development phase
8	 Differentiate between low-level languages and procedural languages
9	 Identify the benefits of object-oriented programming languages and application development tools
10	 Describe various ways to develop webpages and web applications

The Hierarchy of Data
Data is organized in levels. Information technology (IT) professionals classify data in a ­hierarchy. 
Each higher level of data consists of one or more items from the lower level. Depending on the 
application and the user, different terms describe the various levels of the hierarchy.
As shown in Figure 11-2, a database contains a group of related data files. A data file contains 
records, a record contains fields, and a field is composed of one or more characters. This sample School 
database contains four data files: Student, Instructor, Schedule of Classes, and Student Schedule.
• The Student file contains records about enrolled students.
• The Instructor file contains records about current instructors.
• The Schedule of Classes file contains records about class offerings in a particular semester.
• The Student Schedule file contains records about the classes in which a student is enrolled for 
a given semester.
Figure 11-2  A sample 
school database with 
four data files: Student, 
Instructor, Schedule of 
Classes, and Student 
Schedule. The sample 
Instructor file contains 
four records. Each record 
contains six fields. The 
Instructor ID field can 
contain a maximum of 
six characters (bytes).

Tables
In some database 
programs, a data file is 
referred to as a table 
(i.e., Student table, 
Instructor table, etc.).
Characters  As discussed in Chapter 6, a bit is the smallest unit of data 
the computer can ­process. Eight bits grouped together in a unit consti-
tute a byte. In the ASCII coding scheme, each byte represents a single 
c­haracter, which can be a number (4), letter (R), blank space (spacebar), 
punctuation mark (?), or other symbol (&).
Fields  A field is a combination of one or more related characters 
or bytes and is the ­smallest unit of data a user accesses. A field name 
uniquely identifies each field. When searching for data in a database, you 
often specify the field name. For example, field names for the data in 
the Instructor file are Instructor ID, First Name, Last Name, Extension, 
Office, and Email Address.
A database uses a variety of characteristics, such as field size and data 
type, to define each field. The field size defines the maximum number of 
characters a field can contain. For example, the Instructor ID field con-
tains 6 characters and thus has a field size of 6 (shown in Figure 11-2).
The data type specifies the kind of data a field can contain and how 
the field is used. Figure 11-3 identifies the data types for fields in the 
Instructor and Student files.

Records  A record is a group of related fields. For example, a student record includes a set 
of fields about one student. A primary key is a field that uniquely identifies each record in a 
file. The data in a primary key is unique to a specific record. For example, the Student ID field 
uniquely identifies each student because no two students can have the same student ID. In 
some files, the primary key consists of multiple fields, called a composite key. For example, the 
primary key for the Schedule of Classes file could consist of the fields Semester Code, Class 
Code, and Class Section, which together would uniquely identify each class listed in a schedule.
Data Files  A data file, often simply called a file, is a collection of related records stored on 
a ­storage medium, such as a hard drive, or on cloud storage. A Student file at a school might 
consist of thousands of individual student records. Each student record in the file contains 
the same fields. Each field, however, contains different data. Figure 11-4 shows a small sample 
Student file that ­contains four student records, each with eleven fields. A database includes a 
group of related data files.
BTW
Field Names
Some database 
programs do not allow 
the use of the space 
character in field names. 
For example, you may 
see the Last Name 
field name written as 
LastName or last_name.
Consider This
What are common data types?
Common data types include the following:
• Text: Letters, numeric characters, or special characters
• Number (also called numeric values): Positive or negative numbers, and the number zero, with or without decimal points
• AutoNumber: Unique number automatically assigned by the DBMS to each added record, which provides a value 
that identifies the record (such as a student ID)
• Currency: Dollar and cent amounts or numbers containing decimal values
• Date (also called date/time): Month, day, year, and sometimes time
• Memo (also called long text): Lengthy text entries, which may or may not include separate paragraphs
• Yes/No (also called Boolean): Only the values Yes or No (or True or False)
• Hyperlink: Email address or web address that links to a webpage on the Internet or document on a network
• Object (also called BLOB, for binary large object): Photo, audio, video, or a document created in other programs 
or apps, such as word processing or spreadsheet, stored as a sequence of bytes in the database
• Attachment: Document or image that is attached to the field, which can be opened in the program that created 
the document or image (functions similarly to email attachments)
	
Consider This
Why do some fields that store only numbers have a text data type?
Fields that contain numeric characters whose values will not be used in calculations, such as postal codes or phone 
numbers, usually are assigned a text data type.

File Maintenance
File maintenance refers to the procedures that keep data current. File maintenance includes 
adding records to, modifying records in, and deleting records from a file. Users add new records 
to a file when they obtain additional data that should be stored, such as data about a new student 
admitted to a school. Generally, users modify a record in a file for two reasons: (1) to correct 
inaccurate data or (2) to update old data with new data, such as replacing a student’s address 
when she moves to a new address. When a record no longer is needed, a user deletes it from a 
file. For example, if a student was accepted for admission but later notifies the school that he 
chose to attend another college, the school might delete the student’s records from its database. 
Read Ethics & Issues 11-1 to consider how organizations use data they collect.
Ethics & Issues 11-1
Should Companies Inform Consumers 
about How Collected Data Is Used?
A department store came under scrutiny 
recently for using customers’ shopping hab-
its and purchases to determine whether a 
customer was pregnant. The store used the 
data to send ads for baby products before 
some customers even announced that they 
were expecting. If you willingly purchase 
products at a store, can the business analyze 
your purchases to create a profile to use for 
marketing purposes? Can it sell that data to 
a third party?
Function creep occurs when a company 
uses the technology intended for one 
purpose for an entirely different purpose. 
One example of function creep is when 
companies use or sell customer data 
collected through sales transactions using 
customer loyalty cards or other customer 
tracking methods. While some companies use 
data for their own purposes, such as to plan 
inventory or identify sales trends, others sell 
to data brokers or businesses that perform 
marketing surveys or generate credit reports. 
Privacy advocates are concerned about any 
use of personal data for purposes other than 
what the customer intended.
Online social networks and search 
engines often use activities, such as posts, 
pages viewed, and search terms, to suggest 
sponsored ads. Online vendors state that 
the data enables them to provide custom 
product suggestions and streamline ordering 
processes. Some customers acknowledge 
that a company has the right to use data 
to enhance the customers’ experience or to 
make business decisions.
Many consumers would like more control 
over their data. The FTC Fair Information 
Practices (FIP) attempt to address data 
privacy concerns. FIP states that companies 
must inform customers of their data use and 
must allow customers to provide or deny 
consent. Privacy advocates argue further 
that limits should be imposed regarding the 
amount and type of data a company can 
collect and that the customer has a right to 
access the information.
Consider This: Have you experienced 
examples of a company using your personal 
data? For what purpose? Do you read a 
company’s data privacy policy before using 
its website or service? Why or why not? 
How should the government enforce data 
privacy laws?
DBMSs use a variety of techniques to manage deleted or obsolete records. Sometimes, the 
DBMS removes the record from the file immediately, which means the deleted record cannot 
be restored. Other times, the record is flagged, or marked, so that the DBMS will not process 
it again. In this case, the DBMS places an asterisk (*) or some other character at the begin-
ning of the record to indicate that it was deleted. DBMSs that maintain inactive data for an 
extended period commonly flag records. For example, a school might flag courses no longer 
offered or former employees no longer employed. When a DBMS flags a deleted record, the 
record remains physically on the drive. The record, however, is deleted logically because the 
DBMS will not process it. DBMSs will ignore flagged records unless an instruction is issued to 
process them.
Consider This
Can you permanently delete flagged records?
From time to time, users should run a program that removes flagged records and reorganizes current records. 
For example, the school may remove from the drive the names of applicants who chose to attend other schools 
instead. Deleting unneeded records reduces the size of files, thereby freeing up storage space.

Validating Data
Validation is the process of comparing data with a set of rules or values to determine if the 
data meets certain criteria. Many programs perform a validity check that analyzes data, either 
as you enter the data or after you enter it, to help ensure that it is valid. For instance, when an 
admissions department specialist adds or modifies data in a student record, the DBMS tests the 
entered data to verify it meets certain criteria.
If the data fails a validity check, the computer either should not allow the invalid data to be 
stored, or it should display an error message that instructs the user to enter the data again. 
Validity checks, sometimes called validation rules, reduce data entry errors and thus enhance the 
data’s integrity.
Alphabetic/Numeric Check  An alphabetic check ensures that users enter only alphabetic 
data into a field. A numeric check ensures that users enter only numeric data into a field. For 
example, data in a First Name field should contain only characters from the alphabet. Data in 
a Current Enrollment field should contain integers.
Range Check  A range check determines whether a number is within a specified range. Assume 
the lowest per credit hour fee at the school is $75.00 and the highest is $370.75. A range 
check for the Credit Hour Fee field ensures it is a value between $75.00 and $370.75.
Consistency Check  A consistency check tests the data in two or more associated fields to 
ensure that the relationship is logical and their data is in the correct format. For example, the 
value in a Date Admitted field cannot occur earlier in time than a value in a Birth Date field.
Completeness Check  A completeness check verifies that a required field contains data. For 
example, some fields cannot be left blank; others require a minimum number of characters. 
One completeness check can ensure that data exists in a Last Name field. Another can ensure 
that a day, month, and year are included in a Birth Date field.
Check Digit  A check digit is a number(s) or character(s) that is appended to or inserted in 
a primary key value. A check digit often confirms the accuracy of a primary key value. Bank 
account, credit card, and other identification numbers often include one or more check digits.
Discover More: Visit this chapter’s free resources to learn more about check digits.
Other Checks  DBMSs that include the hyperlink and attachment data types can perform 
validity checks on data entered in those fields. Hyperlink entries (web addresses and email 
addresses) can be tested to ensure that the address follows the correct format. Similarly, an 
attachment entry can be validated by confirming that the file exists.
Table 11-1 illustrates some of the validity checks just discussed and shows valid data that 
passes the check and invalid data that fails the check.

Chapter 11  Building Solutions
File Processing Systems and Databases
Almost all applications use the file processing approach, the database approach, or a combination 
of both approaches to store and manage data. The next sections discuss these two approaches.
File Processing Systems
In the past, many organizations exclusively used file processing systems to store and manage 
data. In a typical file processing system, each department or area within an organization has its 
own set of files. The records in one file may not relate to the records in any other file. Many of 
these systems have two major weaknesses: redundant data and isolated data.
• Redundant data: Because each department or area in an organization has its own files in a 
file processing system, the same fields are stored in multiple files. If a file processing system is 
used at a school, for example, the Student file and the Student Schedule file both might store 
the same students’ names and addresses.
Duplicating data in this manner can increase the chance of errors. If a student changes 
his or her address, for example, the school must update the address in each file in which it 
appears. If the Address field is not changed in all the files where it is stored or is changed 
incorrectly in one location, then discrepancies among the files exist. This duplication also 
wastes resources, such as storage space and time. When new students are added or student 
data is modified, file maintenance tasks consume additional time because employees must 
update multiple files that contain the same data.
• Isolated data: It often is difficult to access data that is stored in separate files in different 
departments. Assume, for example, that the student email addresses exist in the Student files and 
class room numbers (locations) are in the Schedule of Classes file. To send an email message 
informing students about a room change, data is needed from both the Student file and the Schedule 
of Classes file. Sharing data from multiple, separate files to generate such a list in a file processing 
system often is a complicated procedure and usually requires an experienced programmer.
The Database Approach
When an organization uses a database approach, many programs and users share the data in 
the database. A school’s database most likely, at a minimum, contains data about students, instruc-
tors, schedule of classes, and student schedules. As shown in Figure 11-5, various areas within 
the school share and interact with the data in this database. The database does secure its data, 
however, so that only authorized users can access certain data items. Read Ethics & Issues 11-2 to 
consider whether criminal databases are useful for law enforcement.
Figure 11-5  In a school’s database, the computer used by the registrar and the computers used by advisors access data in the 
same database through the DBMS.

While a user is working with the database, the DBMS resides in the computer’s memory. Instead 
of working directly with the DBMS, some users interact with a front end. A front end is a program 
that generally has a more user-friendly interface than the DBMS. For example, a registration 
department specialist interacts with the 
Class Registration program by filling out a 
form. This front-end program interacts with 
the DBMS, which, in turn, interacts with the 
database. Many programs today use forms 
on a webpage as their front end. An applica-
tion that supports a front-end program by 
interacting directly with the database some-
times is called the back end. In this case, the 
DBMS is the back end.
Advantages of a Database 
Approach  The database approach 
addresses many of the ­weaknesses asso-
ciated with file processing systems. 
Advantages of the database approach 
include the ­following:
• Reduced data redundancy: Most 
data items are stored in only one file, 
which greatly reduces duplicate data. 
For example, a school’s database would 
record a student’s name and address 
only once. When student data is entered 
or changed, one employee makes the 
change once. Figure 11-6 demonstrates 
the differences between how a file 
processing application and a database 
application might store data.
Ethics & Issues 11-2 
Does the Use of Criminal Databases 
Help or Hinder Investigations?
On television, detectives use databases 
to quickly compile a list of suspects for 
a crime. In these depictions, the list is 
complete, accurate, and leads to a speedy 
conviction. In reality, criminal databases 
are a helpful tool in solving crimes, but 
they are not without limitations. As with 
any database, the value depends on the 
quality of its information. If a criminal 
database contains data that is incomplete, 
inaccurate, or outdated, is it useful for law 
enforcement?
Many criminal databases exist at the 
county, state, and federal levels. Some 
information is mandatory, but other 
contributions to databases are voluntary 
or require only periodic updates. States’ 
departments of correction record and share 
arrest records and jail time, but county 
or local jail records may not be included. 
Some courts and law enforcement use these 
databases for background checks to narrow 
a list of suspects or when determining 
sentencing. Others allow the use during an 
investigation, but findings are not admissible 
in court.
Megan’s Law refers to a group of U.S. 
laws that require law enforcement agencies 
to share information in a national database 
about criminals who commit unlawful acts 
on children. States decide which information 
to make public and how to distribute the 
information. Often, states release criminals’ 
names, photos, addresses, and information 
about the crime on a searchable, public 
website. Some states share information with 
one another regarding almost all criminals, 
and a few allow citizens to search for 
convicted criminals by name. Privacy experts 
feel that publishing this information makes 
it impossible for an offender who has served 
time to lead a normal life. Proponents state 
that the public’s right to know outweighs the 
rights of privacy of those convicted.
Consider This: Are criminal databases 
­useful in law enforcement? Why or why 
not? Should information from criminal 
databases be admissible in court? Why or 
why not? What information should states 
provide to the public regarding people 
­convicted of crimes? Why?

Chapter 11  Building Solutions
• Improved data integrity: When users modify data in the database, they make changes to 
one file instead of multiple files. Thus, the database approach increases the data’s integrity by 
reducing the possibility of introducing inconsistencies.
• Shared data: The data in a database environment belongs to and is shared, usually over 
a network, by the entire organization. This data is independent of, or separate from, the 
programs that access the data. Organizations that use databases typically have security settings 
to define who can access, add, modify, and delete the data in a database.
• Easier access: The database approach allows nontechnical users to access and maintain data, 
provided they have the necessary privileges. Many computer users also can develop smaller 
databases themselves, without professional assistance.
• Reduced development time: It often is easier and faster to develop programs that use the 
database approach. Many DBMSs include several tools to assist in developing programs, which 
further reduces the development time.
Consider This
Can a database eliminate redundant data completely?
No. A database reduces redundant data; it does not eliminate it. Key fields link data together in a database. For 
example, a Student ID field will exist in any database file that requires access to student data. Thus, a student ID is 
duplicated (exists in more than one file) in the database.
	
Disadvantages of a Database Approach  A database can be more complex than a file 
processing system. People with special training usually develop larger databases and their 
associated applications. Databases also require more memory and processing power than file 
processing systems.
Data in a database can be more vulnerable than data in file processing systems because it can 
store a lot of data in a single physical file. Many users and programs share and depend on this 
data. If the database is not operating properly or is damaged or destroyed, users may not be 
able to perform their jobs. Further, unauthorized users potentially could gain access to a single 
database file that contains several data files of personal and confidential data. To protect their 
­database resource, individuals and companies should establish and follow security procedures.
Despite these limitations, business and home users often work with databases because of their 
numerous advantages.
Mini Feature 11-1: Web Databases
The web offers information about jobs, travel destinations, television programming, photos, 
movies, videos, local and national weather, sporting events, and legislative information. You 
can shop for just about any product or service, buy or sell stocks, and make airline reserva-
tions. Much of this and other information exists in databases that are stored on or are accessible 
through the web. Some web databases are collaborative databases, where users store and share 
photos, videos, recordings, and other personal media with other registered users.
To access data in a web database, you fill in a form on a webpage. The webpage is the front 
end to the database. Many search engines use databases to store and index content from websites 
for rapid retrieval. Thus, the search engine’s home page, containing a form in which to type 
search text, is the front end to the database. To access the search engine’s database, you enter 
search text in a search form and then tap or click a search button that instructs the form to send 
the search text to the search engine.
A web database for an organization usually resides on a database server. A database server is 
a computer that stores and provides access to a database. For smaller databases, many desktop 
database programs provide a variety of web publishing tools that enable users without computer 
programming experience to create a home or small office database. Read Mini Feature 11-1 to 
learn about types of web databases.

Web Databases
A database service, or a website that acts as a portal 
for a database, enables government agencies, schools, 
and companies to share information with a wide audi-
ence. Some web databases are accessible to the public. 
Examples of public databases include shopping and 
travel databases. Other databases contain information 
accessible only to authorized users. Examples of pro-
tected databases include certain government databases 
or entertainment and research databases that are 
­subscription based.
Government
Government web database services can provide 
access to information about the government, as well as 
information created and used by government agencies. 
Some information that government agencies publish 
in databases is available to the public. Through these 
database services, for example, users can locate infor-
mation about current laws. Other database services, 
such as those for criminal databases, allow access 
only to those individuals with necessary clearance. 
Government database services also enable officials 
around the world to share data.
Entertainment
You can search an entertainment web database 
service to find out who guest-starred on your favorite 
television program or locate video or audio clips. Using 
a subscription-based entertainment web database 
service allows you to access media content, such as 
music. These database services often enable you to 
create and share playlists. Entertainment professionals 
use subscription-based web databases to view and post 
casting notices or update artist profiles.
Travel
Booking online travel through a travel web ­database 
service enables you to view multiple vendors and 
options. You can limit a search to desired locations 
and dates. These database services help you find deals 
on air travel, car rentals, hotel rooms, and vacation 
packages. Travel web database services can save your 
personal data and travel history. These services will 
send notifications about upcoming travel deals and 
­communicate changes or updates to your travel plans.
Shopping
Shopping web database services enable you to 
locate the right size and color, sort by price or featured 
products, and more. Vendors can use a web database 
service to show photos of items they sell and track 
inventory. Some shopping database services search for 
bargains, presenting a variety of purchasing options so 
that you can find the lowest price. These database ser-
vices also use your search and order history to suggest 
products in their databases that you may be interested 
in buying.
Research
You can interact with web databases to research 
product information when shopping for a new appli-
ance or car. Information accessible through these web 
database services includes costs, safety concerns, and 
industry and user reviews. Some research web database 
services provide financial information for potential 
investors, including company histories and stock analy-
sis. Research web database services are available to 
help you find a college or university and then provide 
information about admission requirements, financial 
information, and application advice.
Education
Teachers can search education web database 
­services to locate and share curricula, worksheets, and 
lesson plans. Schools use web database services to 
store and distribute student contact information and 
grades. Students interact with web database services 
when signing up for their courses online. Using these 
services during enrollment helps a school determine 
when a class has reached its maximum size.

Types of Databases
Every database and DBMS is based on a specific data model. A data model consists of rules 
and standards that define how the database organizes data. A data model defines how users view 
the organization of the data. It does not define how the operating system actually arranges the 
data on the storage media. A database typically is based on one data model. Three popular data 
models in use today are relational, object-oriented, and multidimensional.
Relational Database  A relational database is a database that stores data in tables that ­consist 
of rows and columns. In addition to storing data, a relational database also stores data rela-
tionships. A relationship is a link within the data. Applications best suited for relational 
databases are those whose data can be organized into a two-dimensional table, that is, tables 
with rows and columns. Many organizations use relational databases for payroll, accounts 
receivable, accounts payable, general ledger, inventory, order entry, invoicing, and other 
­business-related functions.
Object-Oriented Database  An object-oriented database (OODB) stores data in objects. 
An object is an item that contains data, as well as the actions that read or process the 
data. Examples of applications appropriate for an object-oriented database include media 
databases that store images, audio clips, and/or video clips; groupware databases that 
store documents, such as schedules, calendars, manuals, memos, and reports; and CAD 
(computer-aided design) ­databases that store data about engineering, architectural, and 
­scientific designs.
Multidimensional and Other Database Types  A multidimensional database stores data in 
dimensions. Whereas a relational database is a two-dimensional table, a multidimensional 
database can store more than two dimensions of data. These multiple dimensions allow 
users to access and analyze any view of the database data. One application that uses multi­
dimensional databases is a data warehouse. A data warehouse is a huge database that stores and 
manages the data required to analyze historical and current transactions. The database in a 
data warehouse often is distributed. The data in a distributed database exists in many separate 
locations throughout a network or the Internet. Although the data is accessible through a 
single server, the physical location of the server on which it is stored is transparent and often 
unknown, to the user.
Mini Feature 11-2: Big Data
Recent technology trends have resulted in activities that generate large quantities of data. 
These trends include the following:
• Growth of online commerce, social, and government applications
• Increased use of mobile devices
• Emergence of the Internet of Things
• Development of cloud computing
• Availability of Internet connectivity through wired and wireless networks
Online business transactions, posts on social networks, government agencies, media and text 
messages from tablets and smartphones, and automated sensors produce data that is stored in 
databases located stored on servers distributed across the Internet. Big Data refers to large-scale 
data sets that require advanced technologies beyond the capabilities of typical database soft-
ware to gather, store, process, retrieve, or analyze. Read Mini Feature 11-2 to learn more about 
characteristics and sources of Big Data, and technologies that facilitate working with large-scale 
distributed databases.

Characteristics of Big Data
Analysts often refer to the three V’s when describing 
characteristics of Big Data: volume, velocity, and variety. 
Large-scale data sets grow in volume (how much data 
is generated), velocity (the rate at which data is gener-
ated), and variety (the different formats in which data 
can appear). 
Volume refers to the amount of data that individuals 
and organizations generate. As data formats expand 
from text to images, files, audio, and video, it is com-
mon to need storage for multiple terabytes (1,000 
gigabytes) of data. In the future, some organizations 
may require storage for petabytes (1,000 terabytes) and 
exabytes (1,000 petabytes) of data. 
Velocity refers to the rate at which data is processed. 
In one day, for example, Google performs more than 6 
billion searches, Facebook records more than 4.5 billion 
“likes,” Twitter receives more than 500 million Tweets, 
and temperature and barometric sensors located across 
the world gather and transmit more than 200 mil-
lion observations. In one minute, YouTube processes 
100 hours of uploaded video. In one second, Amazon 
processes more than 400 transactions from customers 
during the holiday shopping period. 
Variety refers to the different formats to represent or 
store data for use by humans and computer applica-
tions. Some data, such as census records, stock values, 
and corporate sales, is structured, meaning it can be 
organized neatly in tables. Unstructured data generally 
is more complex and may include items such as Tweets, 
media files, Wikipedia articles, and fingerprints. 
Some analysts have expanded the three V’s to 
include veracity (how accurate the data is), value (how 
organizations use their data), and viability (whether 
organizations can make predictions based on this data).
Sources and Uses of Big Data
One way businesses generate Big Data is by capturing  
customer behaviors. For example, in addition to storing  
information about a customer’s purchase, some ­shopping 
websites also gather data about how much time 
­customers spend on a webpage, how many items they 
view before making a purchase, and which pages on the 
company’s website that customers visited, in order to 
create a more customized experience. Amazon and other 
retailers compile data from customer ­purchases in process 
called collaborative filtering to recommend 
related products. For example, Amazon rec-
ommends that customers who purchase a 
digital camera might also want to purchase 
a storage card or a camera case.
Government agencies generate large 
amounts of data in real time from satellite 
images, social media posts, and media. 
By analyzing this data, they can moni-
tor transportation systems, dispatch first 
responders in emergencies, and provide 
consumers with information to make 
informed choices about health care, 
schools, and community services. 
Temperature and barometric sensors, 
wearable devices, and buses and trains 
equipped with GPS capability all transmit 
data over the Internet to be used in a 
­variety of web and mobile ­applications.
Data Visualization
Data visualization is the process of ­presenting data 
graphically as charts, maps, or other pictorial formats 
in order to understand the resulting information eas-
ily. As the size of databases grows, data visualizations 
make it possible to interpret complex data sets, find 
­relationships 
among data items, 
and discover pat-
terns that can 
provide useful 
information. The 
“Racial Dot Map” 
shown in the figure 
is a visualization 
that displays one 
dot per person in 
the United States. 
Each dot is colored 
by ethnicity. The 
figure shows the 
map zoomed in on 
the Boston area.

Database Management Systems
As previously discussed, a database management system (DBMS), or database program, is 
­software that allows you to create, access, and manage a database. Managing a company’s 
­databases requires a great deal of coordination. The database administrator (DBA) is the person 
in the organization who is responsible for managing and coordinating all database activities, 
including development, maintenance, and permissions.
DBMSs are available for many sizes and types of computers. Whether designed for a small or large 
computer, most DBMSs perform common functions. The following pages discuss these functions.
Discover More: Visit this chapter’s free resources to learn more about specific database 
­management systems.
Data Dictionary
A data dictionary, sometimes called a repository, contains data about each file in the database and 
each field in those files. For each file, it stores details such as the file name, a description, the file’s 
relationship to other files, and the 
number of records in the file. For 
each field, it stores details such as the 
field name, description, field type, 
field size, default value, validation 
rules, and the field’s relationship to 
other fields. Figure 11-7 shows how 
a data dictionary might list data for a 
Student file.
A DBMS uses the data ­dictionary 
to perform validation checks to 
maintain the integrity of the data. 
When users enter data, the data dic-
tionary verifies that the entered data 
matches the field’s data type. For 
example, the data dictionary allows 
only dates to be entered in a Date 
Admitted field. The data diction-
ary also can limit the type of data 
that can be entered, often allow-
ing a user to select from a list. For 
example, the data dictionary ensures 
that the State field contains a valid 
two-letter state code, such as IN, by 
presenting a list of valid state codes 
to the user.

File Retrieval and Maintenance
A DBMS provides several tools that allow users and programs to retrieve and maintain data 
in the database. To retrieve or select data in a database, you query it. A query is a request for 
specific data from the database. Users can instruct the DBMS to return or store the results of a 
query. The capability of querying a database is one of the more powerful database features.
A DBMS offers several methods to retrieve and maintain its data. The four more commonly 
used are query languages, query by example, forms, and report writers. Another method is by 
importing data. Read How To 11-1 for instructions about importing spreadsheet data into a 
database and vice versa.
Import Spreadsheet Data  
into a Database and Export  
Database Data to a Spreadsheet
If you periodically use spreadsheets and 
­databases, you may find it beneficial to 
import data from a spreadsheet into a 
database or export data from a database to 
a spreadsheet. As mentioned in this book, 
spreadsheet applications and database 
applications each have unique advantages; 
therefore, you may need to convert the data 
from one application’s format to use in the 
other. For example, if you have a spreadsheet 
with many rows of customer data, you might 
want to import the data from the spreadsheet 
into a database so that you can perform 
simple or complex queries on the data. If you 
have a database with many records and you 
want to perform calculations or a statistical 
analysis of the data, you might export data 
from the database to a spreadsheet. If you 
are exporting data from a relational database 
to a spreadsheet, the relationships will not 
be reflected in the spreadsheet. The following 
steps describe how to accomplish these tasks.
Import Data from a Spreadsheet  
into a Database
1.	 Run the spreadsheet application. Open 
the spreadsheet you want to import to 
the database and make sure your data 
is organized properly. For example, each 
column should represent a field, 
and each row should represent a 
record. The first row in the spread-
sheet should contain the field 
names for each respective column. 
Make the necessary changes to 
the spreadsheet.
2.	 Save and close the spreadsheet.
3.	 Run the database application.
4.	 Create a new database or open the 
­database to which you want to import  
the spreadsheet.
5.	 Navigate to and then tap or click the 
­command to import data from an 
­external file.
6.	 Select the type of file you want to import 
(spreadsheet, in this case). Some database 
applications may identify types of files 
by the name of the program that created 
them. For example, if you are import-
ing an Excel spreadsheet into an Access 
database, you would select the option in 
Access to import an Excel file.
7.	 Navigate through the remaining steps to 
verify that the data in the spreadsheet will 
import properly. This includes:
• Choosing the table into which you 
want to import the data in the 
­spreadsheet
• Verifying field names
• Setting a field to act as a primary key
• Choosing data types for each field
8.	 Tap or click the button or command to 
­finish the import.
9.	 Open the table in the database with the 
data you just imported, and verify it all 
was imported properly.
Export Data from a Database  
to a Spreadsheet
1.	 Run the database application. Open the 
database containing the data you want to 
export.
2.	 Open the table containing the data you 
want to export.
3.	 Navigate to and then tap or click the 
option to export the data.
4.	 Select the option to export the database 
to a spreadsheet. Some database appli-
cations might require you to select the 
name of the spreadsheet application to 
which you want to export the database. 
For example, in Microsoft Access, you 
should specify that you want to export to 
a Microsoft Excel file.
5.	 Specify a file name for the spreadsheet.
6.	 Tap or click the button or command to 
complete the export.
7.	 Run the spreadsheet application and open 
the file you have just created. Verify the 
data has been exported properly from the 
database.

reasons why you might want to import data 
from a spreadsheet into a database or export 
data from a database to a spreadsheet?

Query Language  A query language 
consists of simple, English-like statements 
that allow users to specify the data they 
want to display, print, store, update, or 
delete. Each query ­language has its own 
formats and vocabulary.
Structured Query Language (SQL 
pronounced S-Q-L or sequel) is a ­popular 
query ­language that allows users to 
­manage, update, and retrieve data. SQL 
has special keywords and rules that users 
include in SQL statements. Figure 11-8a 
shows an SQL statement that creates the 
results shown in Figure 11-8b.

resources to learn about query wizards.
Query by Example  Most DBMSs include query by example (QBE), a feature that has a 
­graphical user interface to assist users with retrieving data. Figure 11-9 shows a sample QBE 
screen for a query that searches for and lists students majoring in sociology; that is, their 
Major field value is equal to SOC.

Form  A form, sometimes called a data entry form, is a window on the screen that ­provides 
areas for entering or modifying data in a database. You use forms (such as the Student 
Maintenance Form in Figure 11-1 at the beginning of this chapter) to retrieve and maintain 
the data in a database. To reduce data entry errors, well-designed forms should validate data as 
it is entered.

Report Writer  A report writer, also 
called a report generator, allows users to 
design a report on the screen, retrieve 
data into the report design, and then dis-
play or print the report (Figure 11-10). 
Unlike a form, you use a report writer 
only to retrieve data. Report writers usu-
ally allow you to format page numbers 
and dates; titles and column headings; 
subtotals and totals; and fonts, font sizes, 
color, and shading; and to include images. 
Some report writers allow you to create a 
report as a webpage.
Data Security
Most organizations and people ­realize 
that data is one of their more valuable 
assets. To ensure that data is accessible on demand, an organization must manage and protect 
its data just as it would any other resource. Thus, it is vital that the data is kept secure. For 
example, data in a database often is encrypted to prevent unauthorized users from reading its 
contents, and its access is restricted to only those who need to process the data.
A DBMS provides means to ensure that only authorized users can access data. In addition, 
most DBMSs allow different levels of access privileges to be identified for each field in the data-
base. Access privileges define the actions that a specific user or group of users can perform on the 
data. For example, in the Schedule of Classes file, the student would have read-only privileges. 
That is, the student could view the list of classes offered in a semester but could not change 
them. A department head, by contrast, would have full-update privileges to classes offered during 
a particular semester, meaning he or she can view and modify the data. Finally, some users have 
no access privileges to the data; that is, they cannot view or modify any data in the database. Read 
How To 11-2 for ways to secure and maintain a database. Read Ethics and Issues 11-3 to consider 
issues surrounding users who accidentally access confidential data. Read Secure IT 11-1 for steps 
to take if you become a victim of identity theft due to your personal data being compromised.

Principle of Least 
Privilege
Many organizations 
adopt a principle of least 
privilege policy, where 
users’ access privileges 
are limited to the lowest 
level necessary to perform 
required tasks to prevent 
accidental or intentional 
misuse of the data.
Secure and Maintain a Database
As you add and delete tables and records 
from your database, you should secure and 
maintain the database so that it can con-
tinue operating securely and efficiently. If 
you neglect to secure and maintain a data-
base, chances increase that the data can 
become compromised or inaccessible. The 
following guidelines describe how to secure 
and maintain a database.
Secure the Database
• Each person accessing the database 
should have a profile that includes a 
user name, a strong password that must 
be changed frequently, and limits on 
­database system-level access.
• Only administrators should have access to 
create and delete tables.
• Consider allowing typical users only to 
view or modify records.
• Restrict users to accessing only database 
tables and records that are necessary to 
perform their job function(s).
• Limit the number of unsuccessful sign-in 
attempts in a specified period, and record 
when users access the database.
Maintain the Database
• If the database contains a table that you 
do not need (and you do not foresee a 
future need for the data in that table), 
remove the table from the database.
• Evaluate the fields in all remaining tables 
and make sure they are assigned the 
proper data type. Make any necessary 
adjustments.
• Remove fields you no longer need from 
the tables in your database.
• If the database contains a large number 
of records, consider deleting records you 
no longer need.
• Navigate to and then tap or click 
the ­command to compact and repair 
the ­database (if available).
• If you want to protect the data in the 
database, consider selecting the option to 
encrypt the database.

What Should the Consequences 
Be If a User Accidentally Accesses 
Confidential Data?
A student discovered private student data 
on a publicly accessible area of a university 
computer. Instead of notifying authorities, he 
took the information to the student news-
paper. The newspaper advisor authorized the 
publication of an article about the situation. 
Although the article did not include any 
student names or personal information, the 
administration fired the newspaper’s adviser 
for violating the university’s computer poli-
cies and nearly expelled the student. Was the 
student obligated to report the vulnerability 
to the administration? Was the school right to 
fire the advisor for not reporting the breach?
In another case, a student accessed 
personal data for school employees from 
the school’s network. In this instance, 
the student allegedly attempted to profit 
from the data. Administrators charged 
the high school student with criminal 
trespassing. Other examples include 
students attempting to alter grades, access 
test questions, or disrupt or trace a school’s 
network activity.
Institutions often attempt to resolve 
security breaches quietly. Some fear that 
publicity may cause financial loss and may 
encourage hackers to target the institution. 
In some cases, an institution may file 
lawsuits against those who make security 
breaches public, including reporters. Some 
feel that protecting data privacy partially 
is the responsibility of the person who 
uncovers the breach. Others feel that it 
is the responsibility of the institution or 
organization to secure its servers and 
educate employees about protection of 
confidential data.
Consider This: Is an institution responsible 
for unauthorized access of its personal data, 
or is the person who accessed it respon-
sible? Why? Even if a person is not trying 
to profit from a data breach, is he or she 
still responsible for the discovery? Why or 
why not? Are journalists wrong to expose 
breaches, even if they do not publish the 
accessed data? Why or why not?
Secure It 11-1 
Recovering from Identity Theft
In the past 10 years, more than 640 ­million 
Americans fell victim to identity theft, 
according to the Identity Theft Resource 
Center. Data breaches in businesses, banks, 
medical centers, and schools have affected 
nearly 39 percent of Americans. This crime 
is the complaint most often reported to the 
Federal Trade Commission (FTC).
On average, victims of identity theft 
spend 25 hours settling the resulting issues. 
Experts recommend that people who have 
experienced identity theft should follow this 
advice as part of their resolution efforts:
• Request a fraud alert. Contact the fraud 
department at the three national credit 
reporting companies: Experian, Equifax, 
and TransUnion. (Refer to the How To: 
Your Turn student assignment in this 
chapter for details about contacting these 
agencies.) One agency should report the 
theft to the other two companies, but 
you might want to contact all three to be 
certain the fraud has been noted. Request 
that a fraud alert be placed on your 
­accounts to help prevent credit accounts 
from being opened in your name. This free 
service requires lenders to contact the 
account owners if a new request for credit 
is submitted. This fraud alert must be 
renewed every 90 days.
• Order credit reports. Once you file a 
fraud alert, you are entitled to receive a 
free credit report. Wait at least 30 days 
from the theft to obtain the report, how-
ever, because creditors may report activity 
on a monthly basis, and your most current 
report may not include current information. 
Request that only the last four digits of 
your Social Security number are shown on 
the report.
• Obtain an FTC affidavit and file it 
with law enforcement agencies. The 
FTC’s Identity Theft Victim’s Complaint 
and Affidavit is accepted as proof of your 
identity. Download the form from the FTC’s 
website and then file it with the police. The 
form also can be used to dispute claims 
with creditors.
• Report Internet crime to the Internet 
Crime Complaint Center. Report stolen 
finances or identities and other cybercrime 
to the Internet Crime Complaint Center. 
This organization is a partnership between 
the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the 
National White Collar Crime Center.
• Keep records of your actions. Create 
a journal that records the names of people 
you called, phone numbers, dates, and 
­correspondence sent.
• Review financial accounts. Look for 
unusual activity, and check to see if any 
accounts were opened recently. Continue 
reviewing the accounts even if you do not 
see any questionable transactions.
• Enroll in a credit monitoring service. 
Each of the three national credit reporting 
agencies and many credit card companies 
provide this service. The companies send 
messages to subscribers when unusual 
activity is detected on a credit card account 
to alert consumers to possible identity 
theft. This service can be useful for people 
who have large balances in savings and 
checking accounts, travel frequently, or fail 
to check their bank statements and credit 
reports regularly.
  Consider This: Do you know someone 
who has been a victim of identity theft? 
If so, which type of fraud occurred? What 
activity did this person take to report this 
crime and to restore personal records and 
accounts?

Backup and Recovery
Occasionally, a database is damaged or destroyed because of hardware failure, a problem with 
the software, human error, or a catastrophe, such as fire or flood. A DBMS provides a variety of 
techniques to restore the database to a usable form in case it is damaged or destroyed.
• A backup, or copy, of the entire database should be made on a regular basis. Some DBMSs 
have their own built-in backup tools. Others require users to purchase a separate backup 
program, or use one included with the operating system.
• More complex DBMSs maintain a log, which is a listing of activities that modify the contents 
of the database. If a registration department specialist modifies a student’s address, for 
example, the change appears in the log.
• A DBMS recovery utility uses logs and/or backups, and either a rollforward or a 
rollback technique, to restore a database when it becomes damaged or destroyed. In 
a rollforward, also called forward recovery, the DBMS uses the log to reenter changes 
made to the database since the last save or backup. In a rollback, also called backward 
recovery, the DBMS uses the log to undo any changes made to the database during a 
certain period. The rollback restores the database to its condition prior to the failure. 
Depending on the type of failure, the DBMS determines which type of recovery 
technique to use.
• Continuous backup is a backup plan in which changes are backed up as they are made. This 
backup technique can cost more than other backup strategies but is growing in popularity for 
businesses whose data must be available at all times, because it provides recovery of damaged 
data in a matter of seconds. Organizations such as hospitals, communications companies, and 
financial institutions often use continuous backup.

System Development
An information system is a collection of hardware, software, data, people, and procedures that 
work together to produce information. As a user of technology in a business, you someday 
may participate in the modification of an existing information system or the development of a 
new one. Thus, it is important that you understand system development. 
System development is a set of activities used to build an information system. System 
­development activities often are grouped into larger categories called phases. This collection 
of phases sometimes is called the system development life cycle (SDLC). Many traditional 
SDLCs contain five phases (Figure 11-11):
 1. Planning
 2. Analysis
 3. Design
 4. Implementation
 5. Support and Security
Each system development phase consists of a series of activities, and the phases form a loop. In 
theory, the five system development phases often appear sequentially, as shown in Figure 11-11. 
In reality, activities within adjacent phases often interact with one another, making system 
­development a dynamic, iterative process.

life cycles.

System Development Guidelines
System development should follow three general guidelines: group activities into phases, 
involve users, and define standards.
 1. Group activities into phases. Many SDLCs contain the same phases shown in Figure 11-11. 
Others have more or fewer phases. Regardless, all system development cycles have similar 
activities and tasks.
 2. Involve users. Users include anyone for whom the system is being built. Customers, 
employees, students, data entry specialists, accountants, sales managers, and owners all are 
examples of users. Users are more apt to accept a new system if they contribute to its design.
 3. Define standards. Standards are sets of rules and procedures an organization expects 
employees to accept and follow. Standards help people working on the same project produce 
consistent results.
Who Participates in System Development?
System development should involve representatives from each department in which 
the ­proposed system will be used. This includes both nontechnical users and IT professionals. 
Although the roles and responsibilities of members of the system development team may change 
from organization to organization, this chapter presents general descriptions of tasks for various 
team members.
During system development, the systems analyst meets and works with a variety of people. 
A systems analyst is responsible for designing and developing an information system. The 
systems analyst is the users’ primary contact person. Depending on the size of the organiza-
tion, the tasks performed by the systems analyst may vary. Smaller organizations may have one 
systems analyst or even one person who assumes the roles of both systems analyst and software 
developer. Larger organizations often have multiple systems analysts who discuss various aspects 
of the development project with users, management, other analysts, database analysts, database 
administrators, network administrators, web developers, software developers, vendors, and the 
steering committee.
For each system development project, an organization usually forms a project team to work on 
the project from beginning to end. The project team consists of users, the systems analyst, and 
other IT professionals.

Project Management
Project management is the process of planning, scheduling, and then controlling the 
­activities during system development. The goal of project management is to deliver an accept-
able system to the user in an agreed-upon time frame, while maintaining costs.
In smaller organizations or projects, one person manages the entire project. For larger 
­projects, the project management activities often are separated between a project manager and a 
project leader. In this situation, the project leader manages and controls the budget and schedule 
of the project, and the project manager controls the activities during system development. Project 
leaders and/or project managers are part of the project team. If the systems analyst is not the 
project manager, he or she works closely with the project manager.
To plan and schedule a project effectively, the project leader identifies the following elements:
• Goals, objectives, and expectations of the project, collectively called the scope
• Required activities
• Time estimates for each activity
• Cost estimates for each activity
• Order of activities
• Activities that can take place at the same time

Chapter 11  Building Solutions
After these items are identified, the project leader usually records them in a project plan. 
Project leaders can use project management software to assist them in planning, scheduling, 
and controlling development projects. One aspect of managing projects is to ensure that every-
one submits deliverables on time and according to plan. A deliverable is any tangible item, such as 
a chart, diagram, report, or program file.
Gantt and PERT Charts  Popular tools used to plan and schedule the time relationships 
among project activities are Gantt and PERT charts (Figure 11-12).
• A Gantt chart, developed by Henry L. Gantt, is a bar chart that uses horizontal bars to show 
project phases or activities. The left side, or vertical axis, displays the list of required activities. 
A horizontal axis across the top or bottom of the chart represents time.
• Developed by the U.S. Department of Defense, a PERT chart, short for Program Evaluation 
and Review Technique chart, analyzes the time required to complete a task and identifies the 
minimum time required for an entire project.
PERT charts, sometimes called network diagrams, can be more complicated to create 
than Gantt charts, but are better suited than Gantt charts for planning and scheduling large, 
­complex projects.

Feasibility Assessment
Feasibility is a measure of how suitable the development of a system will be to the ­organization. 
A project that is feasible at one point during system development might become infeasible at 
a later point. Systems analysts, therefore, frequently reevaluate feasibility during the system 
­development project.
A systems analyst typically uses at least four tests to evaluate feasibility of a project: 
­operational feasibility, schedule feasibility, technical feasibility, and economic feasibility.
• Operational feasibility measures how well the proposed information system will work. Will the 
users like the new system? Will they use it? Will it meet their requirements? Will it cause any 
changes in their work environment? Is it secure?
• Schedule feasibility measures whether the established deadlines for the project are reasonable. 
If a deadline is not reasonable, the project leader might make a new schedule. If a deadline 
cannot be extended, then the scope of the project might be reduced to meet a mandatory 
deadline.
• Technical feasibility measures whether the organization has or can obtain the computing 
resources, software services, and qualified people needed to develop, deliver, and then support 
the proposed information system. For most information system projects, hardware, software, 
and people typically are available to support an information system. An organization’s choice 
for using computing resources and software services in-house or on the cloud may impact a 
system’s technical feasibility.
• Economic feasibility, also called cost/benefit feasibility, measures whether the lifetime benefits of 
the proposed information system will be greater than its lifetime costs. A systems analyst often 
consults the advice of a business analyst, who uses many financial techniques, such as return 
on investment (ROI) and payback analysis, to perform a cost/benefit analysis.
Documentation
During system development, project members produce a large amount of documentation. 
Documentation is the collection and summarization of data, information, and deliverables. It is 
important that all documentation be well written, thorough, consistent, and understandable. The 
final information system should be reflected accurately and completely in documentation devel-
oped throughout the development project. Maintaining up-to-date documentation should be an 
ongoing part of system development. Too often, project team members put off documentation 
until the end of the project because it is time consuming, but these practices typically result in 
lower-quality documentation.
Consider This
How do project leaders adjust when a project changes?
After the project features and deadlines have been set, the project leader monitors and controls the project. Some 
activities take less time than originally planned. Others take longer. The project leader may realize that an activity 
is taking excessive time or that scope creep has begun. Scope creep, also called feature creep, occurs when one 
activity has led to another that was not planned originally; thus, the scope of the project now has grown.
Project leaders should use change management, which is the process of recognizing when a change in 
the project has occurred, taking actions to react to the change, and planning for opportunities because of 
the change. For example, the project leader may recognize the team will not be able to meet the original 
deadline of the project due to scope creep. Thus, the project leader may extend the deadline or may reduce 
the scope of the system development. If the latter occurs, the users will receive a less comprehensive system 
at the original deadline. In either case, the project leader revises the first project plan and presents the new 
plan to users for approval. It is crucial that everyone is aware of and agrees on any changes made to the 
project plan.

Data and Information Gathering Techniques
During system development, members of the project team gather data and information. 
They need accurate and timely data and information for many reasons. They must keep a 
project on schedule, evaluate feasibility, and be sure the system meets requirements. Systems 
analysts and other IT professionals use several techniques to gather data and information. 
They review documentation, observe, survey, interview, conduct joint-application design 
­sessions, and research.
• Review documentation: By reviewing documentation such as organization charts, memos, 
and meeting minutes, systems analysts learn about the history of a project. Documentation 
also provides information about the organization, such as its operations, weaknesses, and 
strengths.
• Observe: Observing people helps systems analysts understand exactly how they perform a 
task. Likewise, observing a machine allows you to see how it works.
• Survey: To obtain data and information from a large number of people, systems analysts 
distribute surveys.
• Interview: The interview is the most important data and information gathering technique  
for the systems analyst. It allows the systems analyst to clarify responses and probe during 
face-­to-face feedback.
•  JAD sessions: Instead of a single  
one-on-one interview, analysts often use 
joint-application design sessions to gather 
data and information. A joint-application 
design (JAD) session, or focus group, 
consists of a series of lengthy, structured 
group meetings in which users and IT 
professionals work together to design or 
develop an application (Figure 11-13).
•  Research: Newspapers, technology 
magazines and journals, reference 
books, trade shows, the web, vendors, 
and consultants are excellent sources of 
information. These sources can provide the 
systems analyst with information, such as 
the latest hardware and software products 
and explanations of new processes and 
procedures. In addition, systems analysts 
often collect website statistics, such as 
the number of visitors and most-visited 
webpages, etc., and then evaluate these 
statistics as part of their research.

How do team members collaborate?
Conferencing software includes tools that enable users to share documents via online meetings and communicate 
with other connected users. When a meeting takes place on the web, it is called a web conference. In an online 
meeting, the facilitator may share a document for all participants to see at the same time. This allows the 
participants to edit a document and see the changes being made. Many conferencing software apps allow the 
facilitator to share his or her computer’s desktop screen to demonstrate software apps or show webpages in real 
time to meeting participants. During the online meeting, participants have the ability to open a chat window and 
type messages to one another. Conferencing software also usually includes audio and video capabilities.

Planning Phase
The planning phase for a project begins when the steering committee receives a project 
request. This committee usually consists of five to nine people and typically includes a mix of 
vice presidents, managers, nonmanagement users, and IT personnel.
During the planning phase, four major activities are performed: (1) review and approve the 
­project requests, (2) prioritize the project requests, (3) allocate resources, such as money, people, and 
equipment to approved projects, and (4) form a project development team for each approved project.
Consider This
How are projects prioritized?
The projects that receive the highest priority are those mandated by management or some other governing body. 
These requests are given immediate attention. The steering committee evaluates the remaining project requests 
based on their value to the organization. The steering committee approves some projects and rejects others. Of the 
approved projects, it is likely that only a few will begin system development immediately. Others will have to wait 
for additional funds or resources to become available.
	
Consider This
What circumstances initiate system development?
A user may request a new or modified information system for a variety of reasons. The most obvious reason is to correct 
a problem, such as an incorrect calculation or a security breach. Another reason is to improve the information system. 
Organizations may want to improve hardware, software, or other technology to enhance an information system.
Sometimes, situations outside the control of an organization require a modification to an information system. 
Corporate management or some other governing body may mandate a change. Mergers, reorganizations, and 
competition also can lead to change.
A user may request a new or modified information system verbally in a phone conversation or written as an 
email message. In larger organizations, users write a formal request for a new or modified information system, 
which is called a project request or request for system services. The project request becomes the first item of 
documentation for the project. It also triggers the first phase of system development: planning.

Analysis Phase
The analysis phase consists of two major activities: (1) conduct a preliminary investigation 
and (2) perform detailed analysis.
The Preliminary Investigation  The main purpose of the preliminary investigation, 
­sometimes called the feasibility study, is to determine the exact nature of the problem or 
­improvement and decide whether it is worth pursuing. Should the organization continue 
to assign resources to this project? To answer this question, the systems analyst conducts a 
­general study of the project.
The first task in the preliminary investigation is to interview the user who submitted the 
­project request. Depending on the nature of the request, project team members may inter-
view other users, too. In addition to interviewing, members of the project team may use other 
data gathering techniques, such as reviewing existing documentation. Often, the preliminary 
­investigation is completed in just a few days.
Upon completion of the preliminary investigation, the systems analyst writes the feasibility 
report. This report presents the team’s findings to the steering committee.

Consider This
Does the feasibility report always recommend that the project be continued?
In some cases, the project team may recommend to cancel the project. If the steering committee agrees, the 
project ends at this point. If the project team recommends continuing and the steering committee approves this 
recommendation, then detailed analysis begins.
	
Detailed Analysis  Detailed analysis involves three major activities: (1) study how the current 
system works, (2) determine the users’ wants, needs, and requirements, and (3) recommend a 
solution. Detailed analysis sometimes is called logical design because the systems analysts develop 
the proposed solution without regard to any specific hardware or software. That is, they make no 
attempt to identify the procedures that should be automated and those that should be manual.
While studying the current system and identifying user requirements, the systems analyst 
­collects a great deal of data and information. A major task for the systems analyst is to document 
these findings in a way that can be understood by everyone. Systems analysts use diagrams to 
describe the processes that transform inputs into outputs and diagrams that graphically show the 
flow of data in the system. Both users and IT professionals refer to this documentation.
The System Proposal  After the systems analyst has studied the current system and 
­determined all user requirements, the next step is to communicate possible solutions for the 
project in a system proposal. The purpose of the system proposal is to assess the feasibility 
of each alternative solution and then recommend the most feasible solution for the project, 
which often involves modifying or expanding the current system. The systems analyst presents 
the system proposal to the steering committee. If the steering committee approves a solution, 
the project enters the design phase.
When the steering committee discusses the system proposal and decides which alternative to 
pursue, it considers whether to modify the existing system, buy retail software from an outside 
source, use web apps, build its own custom software, and/or outsource some or all of its IT 
needs to an outside firm. The final decision often is a mix of these options. Read Secure IT 11-2 
for issues related to outsourcing.

Security Issues Arising from 
Outsourcing
Businesses outsource noncore functions 
because third-party vendors may be more 
efficient and more cost effective than the 
businesses trying to perform the functions 
on their own. Noncore functions often 
include general business tasks, such as 
maintaining and supporting an organiza-
tion’s information systems and processing 
customer payments on websites.
Sometimes, however, when a business 
outsources, the external vendors are not as 
careful with security and customer information 
as the business itself might be. The business 
that outsources this task has spent time 
and effort to cultivate and then forge a 
relationship with its customers, and it is in the 
company’s best interest to treat its customers 
well. The outside vendor, however, has no such 
bond with the customers.
Security breaches might occur when work 
is contracted to third parties. For example, 
personal and confidential information about 
customers and employees, payroll, credit 
card numbers, and health records can be 
transferred to external hard drives or other 
storage media and taken outside the building. 
Companies should develop a computer 
security plan that requires safeguards on the 
part of the outside vendors. These procedures 
might include running background checks 
on personnel, closely monitoring the level 
of database access and email messages, 
replacing Social Security numbers with 
another unique identifier, and conducting 
security audits. The plan also should include 
penalties if a security breach occurs.
  Consider This: Does outsourcing lead 
to a lower level of security and privacy for 
­customers? Why or why not? What can an 
organization do to ensure that vendors prac-
tice the same level of care with customer 
information as the organization practices? 
Should customers hold organizations or 
their vendors responsible for leaks of private 
­customer information? Why?

Design Phase
The design phase consists of two major activities: (1) if necessary, acquire hardware and 
­software and (2) develop all of the details of the new or modified information system. The 
­systems analyst often performs these two activities at the same time instead of sequentially.
When the steering committee approves a solution, the systems analyst begins the activity of 
obtaining additional hardware or software or evaluating cloud providers that offer the comput-
ing services to meet the organization’s needs. The systems analyst may skip this activity if the 
approved solution does not require new hardware or software. If this activity is required, it con-
sists of four major tasks: (1) identify technical specifications, (2) solicit vendor proposals, (3) test 
and evaluate vendor proposals, and (4) make a decision.
Discover More: Visit this chapter’s free resources to learn more about cloud providers.
Identify Technical Specifications  The first step in acquiring necessary hardware and 
­software is to identify all the hardware and software requirements of the new or modified 
system. To do this, systems analysts use a variety of research techniques. They talk with other 
systems analysts, visit vendors’ stores, and search the web. Many trade journals, newspapers, 
and magazines provide some or all of their printed content online.
After the systems analyst defines the technical requirements, the next step is to summarize 
these requirements for potential vendors. The systems analyst can use three basic types of 
­documents for this purpose: an RFQ, an RFP, or an RFI.
• A request for quotation (RFQ) identifies the required product(s). With an RFQ, the vendor 
quotes a price for the listed product(s).
• With a request for proposal (RFP), the vendor selects the product(s) that meets specified 
requirements and then quotes the price(s).
• A request for information (RFI) is a less formal method that uses a standard form to request 
information about a product or service.
Solicit Vendor Proposals  Systems analysts 
send the RFQ, RFP, or RFI to potential hard-
ware and software vendors. Another source 
for hardware and software products is a value-
added reseller. A value-added reseller (VAR) is 
an organization that purchases products from 
manufacturers and then resells these products 
to the public — offering additional services 
with the product (Figure 11-14).
Instead of using vendors, some ­organizations 
hire an IT consultant or a group of IT 
­consultants. An IT consultant is a professional 
who is hired based on technical expertise, 
including service and advice.
Test and Evaluate Vendor Proposals  After 
sending RFQs, RFPs, or RFIs to potential 
­vendors, the systems analyst will receive com-
pleted quotations and proposals. Evaluating 
the proposals and then selecting the best one 
often is a difficult task.
Systems analysts use many techniques to 
test the various software products from ven-
dors. They obtain a list of user references from the software vendors. They also talk to ­current 
users of the software to solicit their opinions. Some vendors will provide a demonstration of 
the product(s) specified. Others supply demonstration copies or trial versions, allowing the 
­organizations to test the software themselves.

Chapter 11  Building Solutions
Sometimes it is important to know whether the software can process a certain volume of 
­transactions efficiently. In this case, the systems analyst conducts a benchmark test. A benchmark test 
measures the performance of hardware or software. For example, a benchmark test could measure the 
time it takes a payroll program to print 50 paychecks. Comparing the time it takes various accounting 
programs to print the same 50 paychecks is one way of measuring each ­program’s performance.
Make a Decision  Having rated the proposals, the systems analyst presents a recommendation 
to the steering committee. The recommendation could be to award a contract to a vendor or 
to not make any purchases at this time.
Discover More: Visit this chapter’s free resources for a discussion 
of the hardware acquisition process in the design phase in a system 
development case study.
Detailed Design  The next step is to develop detailed design 
­specifications for the components in the proposed solution. The 
activities to be performed include developing designs for the 
­databases, inputs, outputs, and programs.
•  During database design, the systems analyst works closely with 
the database administrators to identify those data elements that 
currently exist within the organization and those that are new. The 
systems analyst also addresses user access privileges.
•  During detailed design of inputs and outputs, the systems analyst 
carefully designs every menu, screen, and report specified in the 
requirements. The outputs often are designed first because they 
help define the requirements for the inputs.
  The systems analyst may develop a mock-up and/or a layout 
chart for each input and output. A mock-up is a sample of the input 
or output that contains actual data (Figure 11-15). The systems 
analyst shows mock-ups to users for their approval. After users 
approve the mock-up, the systems analyst develops a layout chart 
for the software developer. A layout chart is more technical and 
contains programming-like notations. Many database programs 
provide tools for technical design (Figure 11-16).
  Other issues that must be addressed during input and output 
design include the types of media to use (paper, video, or audio); 
formats (graphical or narrative); and data entry validation 
techniques, which include making sure the entered data is correct 
(for example, a state code has to be one of the fifty valid two-letter 
state abbreviations).
•  During program design, the systems analyst prepares the program 
specification package, which identifies required programs and the 
relationship among each program, as well as the input, output, and 
database specifications.

How can systems analysts build relationships with users?
Systems analysts have much more credibility with users if the analysts understand 
user concerns and have empathy for how the workers are feeling. If users are 
involved, they are more likely to accept and use the new system — called user 
buy-in. One reason systems fail is because some systems analysts create or modify 
systems with little or no user participation.

Prototyping  Many systems analysts today use prototypes during detailed design. A 
­prototype, sometimes called a proof of concept, is a working model of the proposed system’s 
essential functionality. The systems analyst actually builds a functional form of the solution 
during design. The main advantage of a prototype is users can work with the system before it 
is completed to make sure it meets their needs. As soon as users approve a prototype, systems 
analysts can implement a solution more quickly than without a prototype.
Consider This
Who reviews the detailed design?
Many people should review the detailed design specifications before they are given to the programming team. The 
purpose of their review is to ensure the design represents a finished product that will work for the user and the 
development is feasible. Reviewers should include users, systems analysts, managers, IT staff, and members of the 
system development team. If the steering committee decides the project still is feasible, which usually is the case, 
the project enters the implementation phase.
	
Consider This
What is a sandbox?
A sandbox is an environment that allows software developers to test their programs with fictitious data without 
adversely affecting other programs, information systems, or data. Sandboxes are used for testing purposes both 
by developers and users. Users often work with a sandbox to familiarize themselves with a new program or 
information system before they use it.

­process in a system development case study.
Implementation Phase
The purpose of the implementation phase is to construct, or build, the new or modified 
system and then deliver it to the users. Members of the system development team perform four 
major activities in this phase: (1) develop programs and apps, (2) install and test the new system, 
(3) train users, and (4) convert to the new system.
Develop Programs and Apps  If the organization purchases retail software or no 
­modifications to existing custom software are required, the development team may skip this 
activity. For custom software that is new or requires modification, however, programs and 
apps are developed or modified either by an outside firm or in-house.
Software developers write or modify programs and apps from the program specification 
­package created during the analysis phase. Just as system development follows an organized set 
of activities, so does program development. These program development activities are known as 
the program development life cycle.

Install and Test the New System  If the organization acquires new hardware or software, 
someone must install and test it. The systems analysts should test individual programs. They 
also should be sure that all the programs work together in the system.
Systems analysts and users develop test data so that they can perform various tests.
• A unit test verifies that each individual program or object works by itself.
• A systems test verifies that all programs in an application work together properly.
• An integration test verifies that an application works with other applications.
• An acceptance test is performed by end users and checks the new system to ensure that it works 
with actual data.

Train Users  Training involves showing users exactly 
how they will use the new hardware and software in 
the system. Some training takes place as one-on-one 
sessions or classroom-style lectures (Figure 11-17). 
Other organizations use web-based training, which is 
a self-directed, self-paced online instruction method. 
Whichever technique is used, it should include 
hands-on sessions with realistic sample data. Users 
should practice on the actual system during training. 
Users also should be provided access to printed or 
online user manuals for reference. It is the systems 
analyst’s responsibility to create user manuals.
Convert to the New System  The final 
­implementation activity is to change from the old 
system to the new system. This change can take 
place using one or more of the following conversion 
strategies: direct, parallel, phased, or pilot.
• With direct conversion, the user stops using the old system and begins using the new system 
on a certain date. The advantage of this strategy is that it requires no transition costs and is a 
quick implementation technique. The disadvantage is that it is extremely risky and can disrupt 
operations seriously if the new system does not work correctly the first time.
• Parallel conversion consists of running the old system alongside the new system for a specified 
time. Results from both systems are compared. The advantage of this strategy is that you can 
fix any problems in the new system before you terminate the old system. The disadvantage is 
that it is costly to operate two systems at the same time.
• In a phased conversion, each location converts at a separate time. For example, an accounting 
system might convert its accounts receivable, accounts payable, general ledger, and payroll 
sites in separate phases. Each site can use a direct or parallel conversion. Larger systems with 
multiple sites may use a phased conversion.
• With a pilot conversion, only one location in the organization uses the new system — so that it 
can be tested. After the pilot site approves the new system, other sites convert using one of the 
other conversion strategies.

phase in a system development case study.
Support and Security Phase
The purpose of the support and security phase is to provide ongoing assistance for an 
­information system and its users after the system is implemented. The support and security 
phase consists of three major activities: (1) perform maintenance activities, (2) monitor system 
performance, and (3) assess system security.
Information system maintenance activities include fixing errors in, as well as improving, a 
system’s operations. To determine initial maintenance needs, the systems analyst should meet 
with users. The purpose of this meeting, often called the post-implementation system review, is to 
discover whether the information system is performing according to the users’ expectations. 
In some cases, users would like the system to do more. Maybe they have enhancements or 
­additional requirements that involve modifying or expanding an existing information system.
During this phase, the systems analyst monitors performance of the new or modified 
­information system. The purpose of performance monitoring is to determine whether the ­system 
is inefficient or unstable at any point. If it is, the systems analyst must investigate ­solutions to 
make the information system more efficient and reliable — back to the planning phase.
Figure 11-17  Organizations must ensure that users are trained properly 
on the new system. One training method uses hands-on classes to learn 
the new system.

Most organizations must deal with complex technology security issues. All elements of an 
information system — hardware, software, data, people, and procedures — must be secure from 
threats both inside and outside the enterprise. Read Secure IT 11-3 for information about an 
organization’s technology security plan.
Secure IT 11-3
Technology Security Plan Components
If an organization experiences a major 
information system disaster, a computer 
security plan will guide the recovery pro-
cess. The document should identify all the 
security risks that may cause an information 
system asset loss and include all possible 
safeguards to detect, prevent, and recover 
from losses. It should identify all of the orga-
nization’s information assets, which include 
hardware, software, documentation, proce-
dures, people, data, facilities, and supplies. 
Key components should include securing 
equipment, especially laptops and mobile 
devices, creating a strong disaster ­recovery 
strategy, developing a security breach 
­detection and response plan, and providing 
for ongoing training.
One of the responsibilities of a chief 
security officer (CSO) is to protect the 
organization’s information assets. The goal 
of the computer security plan is to match 
an appropriate level of safeguards against 
the identified risks. The CSO must realize 
that some degree of risk is unavoidable 
and that the more secure a system is, the 
more difficult it is for everyone to use. The 
security plan should be evaluated annually, 
or more frequently if information assets 
have changed dramatically. Microsoft has 
developed a Security Development Lifecycle to 
guide the development, implementation, and 
review process. Its seven security practices 
phases — training, requirements, design, 
implementation, verification, release, and 
response — help increase security while 
reducing costs.
  Consider This: What method should be 
used to communicate the plan to all employ-
ees and provide adequate training to ensure 
continued compliance? How can a CSO be 
assured that employees will comply with the 
computer security plan?
Application Development Languages and Tools
The previous sections discussed the system development phases. One activity during the 
­implementation phase is to develop programs and apps. Although you may never write a pro-
gram or app, information you request may require a software developer to create or modify 
a program or app. Thus, you should understand how software developers, sometimes called 
­programmers, create programs and apps to meet information requirements.
To create a program, software developers sometimes write a program’s instructions using a 
programming language. A programming language is a set of words, abbreviations, and symbols 
that enables a software developer to communicate instructions to a computer or mobile device. 
Other times, software developers use a program development tool to create a program or app. 
Software that provides a user-friendly environment for building programs and apps often is called 
an application development tool. An application development tool provides a means for ­creating, 
designing, editing, testing, and distributing programs and apps. Software developers use a variety 
of ­programming languages and application development tools to create programs and apps.

Chapter 11  Building Solutions
Several hundred programming languages exist today. Each language has its own rules, or 
syntax, for writing the instructions. Languages often are designed for specific purposes, such as 
scientific applications, business solutions, or webpage development. When solving a problem or 
building a solution, software developers often use more than one language; that is, they integrate 
the languages. Read Ethics & Issues 11-4 to consider whether programming courses should 
teach students how hackers write programs.
Ethics & Issues 11-4 
Should Colleges Teach Hacking?
Investigators often try to understand 
­criminal minds in an attempt to identify 
what motivates criminals to commit crimes. 
Similarly, to allow students to experience the 
mind-set of a hacker, some colleges teach 
students how to write computer viruses and 
other malware. Hacking sometimes is taught 
as part of an advanced programming course 
or as a stand-alone course. One instructor 
teaches students how to thwart antivirus 
software and how to generate anonymous 
email spam. He claims that if college 
­students easily bypass antivirus software, 
then the products clearly are deficient. Does 
any benefit exist from teaching students 
to hack?
Proponents of such courses claim 
that these hacking skills enable the next 
generation of security experts to think like 
malicious hackers, thereby helping to stop 
the spread of malware. They liken the gained 
skills to physics students who learn about 
atomic weapons or biology students who 
learn how poisons work. One software 
company supports teaching hacking to 
help software developers evaluate code for 
security risks.
Critics claim that this practice only 
encourages more virus authoring and 
hacking. Some developers of malware 
detection software have said they would 
not hire a student who had taken a hacking 
course. Others claim that knowing how to 
write malware does not make someone more 
capable of stopping malware. Questions 
remain about who is responsible legally, 
financially, and morally if a student uses the 
knowledge acquired in the course to release 
malicious code to the Internet or purposely 
infect other computers.
Consider This: Should colleges teach 
­hacking? Why or why not? Should 
­companies hire people who are trained in 
creating malware and computer hacking? 
Why or why not? What precautions should 
schools take if they plan to offer such 
courses? Who is responsible if a student in 
such a course releases malware? Why?
Procedural Languages
With a procedural language, a software developer writes instructions using English-like 
words that tell the computer what to accomplish and how to do it. For example, ADD stands for 
addition, or PRINT means to print. Many procedural languages also use arithmetic ­operators, 
such as * (asterisk) for multiplication and 1 
(plus sign) for addition. Hundreds of procedural 
­languages exist. Only a few, however, are used 
widely enough for the industry to recognize them 
as standards.
One example of a widely used procedural 
language is C. The C programming language, 
­developed in the early 1970s by Dennis Ritchie at 
Bell Laboratories, originally was designed for writ-
ing system software. Today, many programs are 
written in C (Figure 11-18). C runs on almost any 
type of computer with any operating system, but 
it is used most often with the UNIX and Linux 
operating systems.

Compilers and Interpreters  Before a ­computer or mobile device can run (execute) a 
­program or app created with a procedural language, system developers must convert 
the program into machine language, which is the only language the computer directly 
­recognizes. That is, the computer cannot execute the procedural language source 
­program. A source ­program contains 
the language instructions, or code, to 
be converted to machine language. 
For procedural languages, software 
developers typically use either a com-
piler or an interpreter to perform the 
­conversion.
• A compiler is a separate program that 
converts the entire source program into 
machine language before executing it. 
The machine language version that 
results from compiling the procedural 
language is called the object program 
or object code. The compiler stores the 
object program on storage media for 
execution later.
While it is compiling the source 
program into the object program, the 
compiler checks the source program for 
errors. The compiler then produces a 
program listing that contains the source 
code and a list of any errors. This list-
ing helps the software developer make 
necessary changes to the source code 
and correct errors in the program. 
Figure 11-19 shows the process of 
­compiling a source program.
• An interpreter, by contrast, translates 
and executes one instruction at 
a time. An interpreter reads an 
instruction, converts it to one or more machine language 
instructions, and then executes those machine language 
instructions. It does this all before moving to the 
next instruction in the program. Each time the source 
program runs, the interpreter translates and executes 
it, instruction by instruction. An interpreter does not 
produce an object program. Figure 11-20 shows the 
process of interpreting a program.
One advantage of an interpreter is that when it finds 
errors, it displays feedback immediately. The software 
developer can correct any errors before the interpreter 
translates the next instruction. The disadvantage is that 
interpreted programs do not run as fast as compiled 
­programs.

Object-Oriented Programming Languages and Application Development Tools
System developers use an object-oriented programming (OOP) language or object-­oriented 
application development tool to implement objects in a program. Recall that an object is an 
item that can contain both data and the procedures that read or manipulate that data. An object 
­represents a real person, place, event, or transaction.
A major benefit of OOP is the ability to reuse and modify existing objects. For example, 
once a system developer creates an Employee object, it is ­available for use by any other existing 
or future program. Thus, system developers repeatedly reuse existing objects. For example, a 
payroll program and health benefits program both would use an Employee object. That is, the 
payroll program would use it to process employee paychecks, and the health benefits program 
would use it to process health insurance payments.
Programs developed using the object-oriented programming languages and application 
­development tools have several advantages. The objects can be reused in many systems, are 
designed for repeated use, and become stable over time. In addition, developers create applications 
faster because they design programs using existing objects. Programming languages, such as Java 
and C++, and the latest versions of Visual Basic are complete OOP languages. Most object-oriented 
application development tools, such as Visual Studio, are referred to as an ­integrated ­development 
environment (IDE) because they include tools for building graphical ­interfaces, an editor for enter-
ing program code, a compiler and/or interpreter, and a debugger (to remove errors). Some work 
with a single programming language, and others support multiple languages. Read How To 
11-3 for instructions about selecting the object-oriented programming language and application 
­development tools best suited to your needs.

Determine Which Object-Oriented 
Programming Language or Application 
Development Tool to Use
Software developers can choose from a 
variety of object-oriented programming lan-
guages and application development tools 
to write a program or app for a computer 
or mobile device. The following guidelines 
describe how to determine which language 
or tool to use:
•	 Determine the types of devices on which 
your program or app will run. For example, 
if you are writing an app for a mobile 
device, limited languages and tools may be 
available for you to use. If you are writing a 
program or app that will run on a computer, 
more options will be available. Perform 
research and determine which types of 
programming languages can be used for 
various devices and operating systems.
•	 Determine the capabilities of the 
­programming languages you are consider-
ing using. Some programming languages 
have greater capabilities than others.
•	 Consider the speed at which programs 
and apps run that are written in a 
­particular programming language. For 
example, a program or app might run 
faster if it is written in one language as 
opposed to another.
•	 Consider whether you want to write a 
program using a text editor or an IDE. 
If you want to use an IDE, your choices 
of programming languages may be 
­limited.
•	 Solicit recommendations from other 
­developers. Explain the type of program 
or app you plan to write, and consider 
­suggestions they might offer.
  Consider This: If you are forced to 
write a program or app using a ­programming 
­language with which you are not very 
­familiar, what resources can you utilize to 
obtain assistance?

What is rapid application development?
RAD (rapid application development) is a method of developing software in which the software developer writes 
and implements a program in segments instead of waiting until the entire program is completed. An important 
concept in RAD is the use of prebuilt components. For example, software developers do not have to write code  
for buttons and text boxes on Windows forms because they already exist in the programming language or 
application development tools provided with the language. Object-oriented programming languages and 
application development tools work well in a RAD environment.

C++  Developed in the 1980s by Bjarne Sroustrup at Bell Laboratories, C++ (pronounced 
SEE-plus-plus) is an object-oriented programming language that is an extension of the C 
programming language. C++ includes all the elements of the C language, plus it has addi-
tional features for working with objects. Software developers commonly use C++ to develop 
­database and web applications.
Visual Studio  Developed by Microsoft, Visual Studio contains a suite of object-oriented 
application development tools that assists software developers in building programs and 
apps for Windows or any operating system that supports the Microsoft .NET Framework. 
Visual Studio also includes a set of tools for developing programs and apps that work with 
Microsoft’s Office suite. OOPs included in the Visual Studio suite are Visual Basic, Visual

Other Languages and Application Development Tools
The following sections discuss a variety of other programming languages and application 
development tools.
4GLs  A 4GL (fourth-generation language) is a nonprocedural language that enables users and 
software developers to access data in a database. With a nonprocedural language, the ­software 
developer writes English-like instructions or interacts with a graphical ­environment to 
retrieve data from files or a database. Many object-oriented application development tools use 
4GLs. One popular 4GL is SQL. As discussed earlier in this chapter, SQL is a query language 
that allows users to manage, update, and retrieve data in a relational DBMS.
Classic Programming Languages  In addition to the programming languages discussed 
on the previous pages, software developers sometimes use the languages to maintain legacy 
­systems. These languages, which include BASIC, COBOL, FORTRAN, and RPG, were more 
widely used in the past than they are today.
Discover More: Visit this chapter’s free resources to learn more about classic programming 
languages.
Application Generators  An application generator is a program that creates source code 
or machine code from a specification of the required functionality. When using an applica-
tion generator, a software developer or user works with menu-driven tools and graphical user 
interfaces to define the desired specifications. Application generators most often are bundled 
with or are included as part of a DBMS. An application generator typically consists of a report 
writer and forms (discussed earlier in this chapter), and a menu generator. A menu generator 
enables you to create a menu for the application options.
Macros  A macro is a series of statements that instructs a program or app how to complete 
a task. Macros allow users to automate routine, repetitive, or difficult tasks in application 
software, such as word processing, spreadsheet (Figure 11-22), or database programs. That is, 
users can create simple programs within the application by writing macros. You usually create 
a macro in one of two ways: (1) record the macro or (2) write the macro.

What is a visual programming language?
A visual programming language is a language that uses a visual or graphical interface for creating all source code. 
The graphical interface, called a visual programming environment (VPE), allows system developers to drag and 
drop objects to build programs and apps.

Why and how would you record a macro?
If you want to automate a routine or repetitive task such as formatting or editing, you would record a macro. 
A macro recorder is similar to a movie camera because both record all actions until turned off. To record a macro, 
start the macro recorder in the software. Then, perform the steps to be part of the macro, such as taps, clicks, 
or keystrokes. Once the macro is recorded, you can run it any time you want to perform that same sequence 
of actions. For example, if you always print three copies of certain documents, you could record the actions 
required to print three copies. To print three copies, you would run the macro called PrintThreeCopies. When you 
become familiar with programming techniques, you can write your own macros instead of recording them. Read 
Secure IT 11-4 for security issues related to macros.

Web Development
The designers of webpages, known as web developers, use a variety of techniques to create 
and publish webpages. The following sections discuss these techniques. Read How To 11-4 for 
instructions about publishing webpages.
Publish a Webpage
After creating a webpage, you will need 
to publish it on a web server so that it is 
accessible online. The method you use to 
publish a webpage can vary, depending 
upon a number of factors. For example, if 
you created a webpage using a content 
management system or web app, the web-
page may be available online automatically, 
or you may be able to use a feature in the 
content management system or web app 
to publish the webpage. If you created the 
webpage using a program or app on your 
computer, the following sections describe 
various ways to publish the webpage.
1.	 Identify the web hosting company you 
want to use.
2.	 Navigate to and review the 
­documentation explaining how to­ 
­publish your webpage. Some web host-
ing ­companies require you to publish the 
webpage using a specific set of steps, 
while others are more flexible.
3.	 Publish the webpage using one of the web 
hosting company’s recommended methods:
• Some web hosting companies will 
allow you to publish your webpage 
­using a web app or file transfer 
­program that is part of their web-
site. Select the files you want to 
­transfer from your computer, select 
the ­destination (if necessary), and 
then tap or click the appropriate 
button or link that will initiate the 
transfer.
• Some web hosting companies, 
­businesses, or universities allow you 
to publish webpages using FTP or 
SFTP (secure FTP). Download and 
install a program or app that sup-
ports the required protocol (FTP or 
SFTP). Run the program and enter 
the required information to connect 
to the web hosting company’s server. 
(The required information, such as 
the server address, user name, and 
password, is available from the web 
hosting company.) Next, connect 
to the server, select the file(s) you 
want to transfer from your computer 
and the location on the web hosting 
company’s server where you want to 
transfer the files, and then initiate 
the transfer.
4.	 Once the transfer has completed, run a 
browser.
5.	 Navigate to your webpage. Your web 
­hosting company should have provided 
the web address for accessing the 
­webpage.
6.	 If your webpage does not display 
­properly, verify that you entered the 
­correct web address and ensure the 
web server is functional. Lastly, consider 
contacting your web hosting company’s 
technical support staff for additional 
­assistance.

Protection from Macro Viruses
More than 20 years ago, the first macro 
viruses wreaked havoc with personal 
­computers. Now, the same macro coding 
techniques are being used to create ­malware 
infecting smartphones. For example, the 
Selfmite worm sends text messages with 
malicious links to the owner’s contacts.
As the name implies, a macro virus hides in 
a program’s macro language. Malware authors 
find that one of the easiest methods of 
spreading viruses and worms is by distributing 
apps and files containing macro viruses. This 
type of virus is easy to write, and the damage 
that results from infecting smartphones and 
computers can exceed millions of dollars.
Because many computers and 
smartphones have acquired damaging 
macro viruses, antivirus and productivity 
software companies have strengthened 
their efforts to prevent this malware from 
infecting their products. One method, 
for example, disables the macros, which 
prohibits users from running once-
automated tasks on their computers. The 
users, however, are frustrated when they 
now must perform routines manually. Other 
prevention measures include setting the 
software’s macro security level to high, not 
installing apps from unknown sources, not 
opening unexpected file attachments, and 
holding down the shift key when opening 
a file that may be infected by a macro 
virus so that any automatic macros are 
prevented from running.
Many smartphone and computer users 
claim the software companies should make 
it impossible for malware authors to take 
advantage of security problems in the 
software. The software companies, however, 
place the blame on users who install apps and 
open files from unknown sources.
  Consider This: Should users or software 
companies be held accountable for macro 
security threats? Why? How can smartphone 
and computer users best be educated about 
opening text messages and documents from 
unknown sources?

Scripting and Other Web Development Languages  To add interactivity on webpages and 
to add special media effects, such as animated graphics, scrolling messages, calendars, and 
advertisements, web developers write small programs called scripts using a variety of script-
ing languages. Although some use languages previously discussed, such as Java and C++, many 
developers instead use scripting languages. A scripting language is an interpreted language that 
typically is easy to learn and use. Popular scripting and other web development languages 
include JavaScript (Figure 11-24), Perl, PHP, Python, and Ruby.

Mini Feature 11-3: Web Application Development
Three technologies form the foundation for many web applications: HTML5 specifies the 
structure of content displayed on a webpage; CSS (cascading style sheets) describes the design 
and appearance of information on a webpage; and JavaScript is a scripting language that allows 
users to interact with a webpage’s content. Many web applications also access applications 
­running on a server, connect to a database, or access third-party content from online sources. 
Together, these technologies enable developers to create browser-independent web applications 
that run on a variety of devices.
As discussed in an earlier chapter, the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) is an 
­international organization that sets the standards for the technologies and operation of the web. 
In addition, it defines the standards for HTML5 and CSS. Read Mini Feature 11-3 to learn 
about technologies that enable developers to create browser-independent web applications.
Consider This
What are some applications of XML?
Two applications of XML are the RSS 2.0 and ATOM specifications. RSS 2.0, which stands for Really Simple 
Syndication, and ATOM are specifications that content aggregators use to distribute content to subscribers. The 
online publisher creates an RSS or ATOM document, called a web feed, that is made available to websites for 
publication. News websites, blogs, and podcasts often use web feeds to publish headlines and stories. Most 
browsers can read web feeds, meaning they can display titles, links, descriptions, and other information about 
pages identified in the feed.

XML  XML (Extensible Markup Language) is an increasingly popular format for sharing data 
that allows web developers to create tags that describe the structure of information. XML 
separates the webpage content from its format, allowing the browser to display the contents 
of a webpage in a form appropriate for the display device. For example, RSS feeds (web feeds) 
are represented as XML. A webpage can read the feed’s content as described by XML and 
then apply styles and consistent formatting to each element (title, link, description) to display 
it within a browser.
Wireless devices use a subset of XML called WML. WML (wireless markup language) allows 
web developers to design pages specifically for microbrowsers. Many smartphones and other 
mobile devices use WML as their markup language.
Consider This
Is HTML a programming language?
HTML is not actually a programming language. It is, however, a language that has specific rules for defining the 
placement and format of text, graphics, video, and audio on a webpage. HTML uses tags or elements, which are 
words, abbreviations, and symbols that specify links to other documents and indicate how a webpage is displayed 
when viewed on the web.

Web Application 
Development
To develop a web application, web developers use 
HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript.
HTML5
HTML5 is the current HTML standard for creating 
websites and applications. HTML uses a set of codes 
called tags to instruct a browser how to structure a 
webpage’s content. HTML tags specify the structure of 
content on a webpage, such as headings, paragraphs, 
links, or images. HTML5 includes tags for playing 
audio and video files without relying on the use of 
third-party plug-ins or modules, such as Adobe Flash, 
to perform these tasks. Some mobile devices and 
computers, such as Apple’s iPhone and iPad, do not 
support displaying media content that requires Flash. 
Instead, they rely on HTML5-compliant ­browsers, 
which are capable of interpreting HTML5 tags, to 
handle these tasks.
Additional HTML5 features include recognizing 
gestures, such as swipe or drag-and-drop, on mobile 
devices; dynamically creating graphics, such as 
progress bars, charts, and animations; geolocation 
(determining a user’s location based on a device’s GPS 
or connection to a cell tower); and offline storage. For 
example, Google Drive uses HTML5’s drag-and-drop 
feature so that you can organize documents and uses 
its offline storage feature to allow you to work with 
your documents when you do not have an Internet 
connection. Twitter makes use of HTML5’s geolocation 
feature when users search for Tweets that originate 
near a specific location.

Chapter 11  Building Solutions
These HTML5 features enable web developers to 
build applications that address the needs of how people 
use the web today and provide richer user experiences. 
Each browser implements the HTML5 specification 
differently and may not support all of its features.
CSS
While HTML describes the structure of a ­webpage’s 
content as a collection of elements (such as headings, 
paragraphs, images, and links), CSS allows web design-
ers to separate the code that specifies a webpage’s 
content from the code that specifies the webpage’s 
appearance. For example, a webpage may contain two 
paragraphs of text that are presented using a variety 
of fonts and sizes, styles, colors, borders, thicknesses, 
columns, or backgrounds. CSS provides web design-
ers with precise control over a webpage’s layout and 
allows the designers to apply different layouts to the 
same information for printing or for viewing in brows-
ers on smartphones, tablets, or computers with varying 
screen sizes. The current version of CSS is known as 
CSS3 (cascading style sheets, version 3).
JavaScript
JavaScript is a programming language that adds 
­interactivity to webpages. It often is used to check for 
appropriate values on web forms, display alert messages, 
display menus on webpages, control the appearance of 
a browser window, read and write cookies, display alert 
boxes, and detect the browser version in order to display a 
webpage especially designed for that browser. JavaScript 
code is loaded with a webpage and runs in the browser.
Developing Websites and Applications  
with HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript
Web developers often use tools, such as the one shown 
in the figure, to create their code and visualize what it will 
look like in a browser. In this example, HTML5 specifies a 
heading, a paragraph, and a link; CSS specifies the page 
background color and fonts, while JavaScript instructs the 
page to display an alert box when it loads.

Sports
While watching your local football team play 
an out-of-state game on television, you notice 
various player and game statistics appear on 
the screen, alerting you to how many yards 
the offense must travel before making a first 
down. The camera then focuses on the large, 
colorful, high-resolution scoreboard at the 
stadium. While sports, such as football, have 
been around for many decades, the integra-
tion of technology has added significantly to 
the viewing experience.
While watching a baseball game, you 
notice that the scoreboard shows the 
number of balls and strikes for the player at 
bat, as well as other statistics. Behind home 
plate, an electronic radar gun calculates 
and records the speed of each pitch. This 
recorded data, along with the umpire’s call 
(ball or strike) and the player’s performance 
at bat (hit, home run, strike out, etc.) are 
entered in a computer, which updates the 
player’s batting average automatically. 
A database stores information about the 
individual players and other aspects of the 
baseball game. During this entire time, the 
video display on the stadium’s scoreboard 
plays audio and video to entertain the fans. 
The computer storing the player and game 
statistics, audio, and video communicates 
with the scoreboard and video display using 
either a wired or wireless connection. At the 
same time, these computers send updated 
scores and statistics to webpages and 
mobile devices.
Technology not only is used to keep 
track of athlete statistics and communicate 
with scoreboards, but also in racing to help 
measure a vehicle’s performance before 
a race. Sensors installed on a vehicle can 
measure throttle inputs, airflow over the 
body, the distance between the vehicle’s 
frame and the track, and more. The racing 
teams then can modify the vehicle so that 
it achieves maximum performance during 
a race.
Overall, technology adds enjoyment to 
various sporting events for many individuals. 
While waiting for a pitcher to throw the next 
ball or for a football team to start its next 
play, keep in mind that the integration of 
technology entertains you with interesting 
statistics and replays between the action.
  Consider This: How else might 
­computers and technology be used in sports?

1	 Obtain and Verify the Accuracy  
of a Credit Report 
As discussed in this chapter, you might need to 
obtain or verify the accuracy of your credit report 
for a variety of reasons. It is important to obtain 
your credit report at least one time per year to 
verify its accuracy, as imperfections on a credit 
report can lead to problems such as financing being 
declined or higher interest rates on loans. The 
following steps guide you through the process of 
obtaining and verifying the accuracy of a credit 
report.
a. Run a browser and then navigate to 
annualcreditreport.com.
b. When you arrive at the website, verify that the 
browser is using the “https” protocol, indicating a 
secure connection.
c. Tap or click the button to request the report.
d. Provide the necessary personal information.
e. Select the agency or agencies from which you 
want a copy of your credit report.

information to validate your request.
h. Follow the remaining instructions on the 
website to finish obtaining a copy of your credit 
report.
i. Save and/or print a copy of the credit report.
After you have obtained a copy of your credit ­report, 
you should verify it for accuracy. The ­following 
points describe what to look for when reviewing the 
report:
• Verify the list of accounts is accurate.
• Verify your payment history.
• Verify current balances are accurate.
• Review your personal information, and report any 
inconsistencies to the credit reporting agency.
• Review your rights under the Fair Credit 
Reporting Act.
Exercises
1. In addition to the reasons mentioned in this exercise, 
why else might you want to obtain a copy of your 
credit report?

credit score? What are the highest and lowest possible 
credit scores?
3. If you find erroneous information on your credit 
report, what steps can you take to make the necessary 
corrections?
2	 Use a Research Database
Students often use one or more research databases to 
locate information about a particular topic. Research 
databases often can be accessed in a public or school 
library, through a library’s website, or through the 
research database’s website. The following steps guide 
you through the process of using a research database:
a. Locate and then navigate to the research database 
that contains the information you are seeking. 
Consult a librarian if you need assistance in 
determining the exact database you should use.
b. Determine the location from which you can access 
the research database. For instance, you may need 
to access some research databases from a library 
computer. Other databases are accessible from 
anywhere if you can verify your identity as a library 
patron or a student. Some databases are available to 
the public at no charge or with no other restrictions.
Instructions: You often can complete tasks using technology in multiple ways. Figure out how to perform the tasks described in these exercises 
by using one or more resources available to you (such as a computer or mobile device, articles on the web or in print, online or program help, user 
guides, blogs, podcasts, videos, other individuals, trial and error, etc.). Summarize your ‘how to’ steps, along with the resource(s) used, in the format 
requested by your instructor (brief report, presentation, discussion, blog post, video, or other means).

3	 Protect Your Data If Your Device Is Lost 
or Stolen
If you misplace your device or it is stolen, you can use 
another device to help find yours. Certain apps will 
help you locate your device, cause your phone to ring, 
display an alert message, take a photo using the front 
or back camera, or remotely lock the device so that 
your data will be safe. Some apps require purchasing 
the full version to access advanced features, such as 
remotely locking or wiping your device. The following 
steps guide you through the process of protecting your 
data if your device is lost or stolen.
a. Determine whether your device has a built-in 
feature or app you can use to locate it in the event 
it is lost or stolen. If not, locate, install, and run 
an app that can perform this service. The app you 
locate and install should meet the following criteria:
1. The app should be reputable and have good 
reviews.
2. Reviews should contain no indication that the 
app is malicious.
3. The app should be able to locate, lock, and erase 
data from your device in the event it is lost or 
stolen.
4. You should be able to access or control your 
phone from a variety of devices (such as 
smartphones, tablets, laptops, and desktops) and 
operating systems (such as iOS, Android, Mac 
OS, and Windows).
5. The app should be secure so that others 
cannot inadvertently or maliciously control your 
device.
b. From the app’s home screen, configure the 
necessary settings so that you will be able to locate 
and control your device in the event that it is lost 
or stolen. Consider configuring the following 
settings:
1. Determine which ringer or sound you want to 
use if you are attempting to locate a lost device.
2. Specify how to instruct the device to take an 
appropriate action. For example, you may be 
able to instruct a device to play a sound (such 
as a siren) by sending a text message to it with 
certain wording, or by tapping or clicking a 
button on a specific website.
3. Enable the GPS feature on the device so that 
you will be able to see its location.
c. Make sure the data on your device is backed up 
regularly. You can back up your data either to a 
computer or to the cloud. Some devices have a 
feature (or apps available) to automatically back up 
your data in the event it is erased from your device.
d. Test the features of the app to make sure it works 
as intended.
e. In the event the device is lost or stolen, perform 
the following steps as soon as possible for the best 
chance at retrieving the device and its data:
1. Issue a command to the device to lock it.
2. If you are attempting to locate a phone, call it 
to see if someone answers. If so, try to retrieve 
the phone.
3. If possible, send a text message to the device 
with your contact information to see if someone 
contacts you.

4. Activate the ringer or sound on the device so 
that you can hear it if it is nearby.
5. If possible, sign in to a web app or access an app 
on another device to track the device’s location 
using GPS.
6. If possible, take a photo with the device’s front 
and back cameras to see if you can determine 
where it is located.
7. If you are unsuccessful and you think the data 
on the device is at risk, issue a command to the 
device to erase all data. You also might consider 
contacting law enforcement if you think the 
device was stolen.
Exercises
1. Have you ever lost or misplaced a device? If so, did 
you locate it? How?
2.  Evaluate at least three apps that 
can locate and remove data from 
a lost or stolen device. Which 
ones did you evaluate? Which is 
your favorite? Why?
3.  Some devices offer a feature that 
allows you to encrypt the data. 
Would you encrypt the data 
on your device? Why or why 
not? What are the benefits of 
doing so? What drawbacks exist, 
if any?
4	 Create and View a Text File
Word processing programs and apps allow you to enter 
small or large amounts of text into documents; however, 
these apps apply additional formatting to the document 
that may not be necessary. For example, if you are writ-
ing a program or creating a webpage with HTML, you 
would not be able to enter the code in a word process-
ing program or app because it would apply additional 
formatting (such as the font and size used, information 
about margins, colors, and line spacing) to the file that 
would interfere with the code you write. A text file stores 
only the text you write without any additional formatting. 
For this reason, you are not able to format the text that 
you enter in a text file. The following steps guide you 
through the process of creating and viewing a text file.
Creating a Text File
a. Locate and run a text editor, for example, the 
Notepad app in Windows or the TextEdit app on 
a Mac. Some word processing programs and apps 
can save documents as plain text files.
b. If necessary, create a new text file.
c. Enter the desired text, such as HTML or program 
code, in the file.
d. When you have finished entering the text, save 
the file with the appropriate file extension for the 
type of file you are creating, and verify that you are 
saving it as a text file. If you used a word processing 
program or app to create the text file and find that 
it will not save your file as a plain text file, you can 
copy the text from the word processing program or 
app and paste it into a text editor and then save the 
file from the text editor.
e. If necessary, exit the text editor.
Viewing a Text File
a. Run a text editor.
b. Select the option to open a file.
c. Navigate to the text file you want to view.
d. Select the text file you want to view and then tap 
or click the button to open the file.
e. When you are done viewing the file, close the file 
and then exit the text editor.
or
a. Navigate to the text file you want to view.
b. Press and hold or right-click the text file’s icon to 
display a shortcut menu.
c. Select the option on the shortcut menu to open the 
file in the desired text editor.
Note: You should not attempt to view a text file by 
double-clicking its icon because it may not open in 
a text editor by default. For example if you ­create 
a text file and save it with an .html file extension, 
­double-clicking the file may open it in a browser.
Exercises
1. Have you ever created a file in a text editor? Why? If 
not, what types of files might you need to create in a 
text editor?
2. How do file sizes of text files compare with similar 
files created in a word processing program or app? 
Why do you think this is the case?
3. Evaluate one 
third-party text 
editor that is 
compatible with 
your operating 
system. How 
does it compare 
to the one that is 
included with your 
operating system? 
What is the same? 
What is different?

Chapter 11  Building Solutions
1	 Making Use of the Web 
Entertainment
Americans, on average, spend nearly six percent 
of their income on entertainment, which includes 
tickets for concerts and movies, electronic equip-
ment, hobbies, and services. They have scaled back 
their away-from-home activities in favor of in-home 
entertainment as they have invested in home theaters, 
­high-speed Internet, and game consoles.
Many websites satisfy our cravings for amusement. For 
example, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum 
has videos, stories, and a comprehensive “The Story of 
Rock” to enjoy. The Internet Movie Database (IMDb) 
has facts about more than 2.7 million movies, television 
shows, and entertainment programs. It also has video 
highlights, quotes, quizzes, and movie showtimes. Other 
entertainment websites have a variety of content aimed at 
amusing visitors and relieving boredom.
Research This: (a) Locate the Rock and Roll Hall of 
Fame and Museum website and view the information 
about the latest inductees. What is the total number of 
inductees? Which artists have been inducted more than 
once? Describe two upcoming events. Which classes are 
being offered in the Rock and Roll Night School?
(b) Locate the Internet Movie Database website. Take 
the IMDb Internet Icon Quiz. What score did you earn? 
What are three movies opening this week? What is the 
top news story of the day?
(c)Visit an entertainment website. What content 
is ­featured, such as humorous and sports video clips, 
photos, animations, and audio clips? What categories 
are available? Are advertisements included in the con-
tent? Which content is available at no cost, and which 
requires a fee to access?
2	
Social Media 
Companies collect data as people browse websites. 
Just seconds after individuals visit a specific webpage, 
advertisements are displayed matching their shopping 
patterns and favorite products. This tracking is preva-
lent in online social networks, too, as marketers match 
users’ profiles and other posted information, such as 
status updates, with specific businesses. Facebook, for 
example, allows retailers to upload their databases 
containing email addresses, phone numbers, and other 
personal facts. This data then is compared with the 
Facebook users’ data. When a match is found, specific 
advertisements are displayed. Social media may charge 
the advertisers each time a user clicks an ad, called 
CPC (cost per click) or PPC (pay per click), which 
could range from a few cents to several dollars. Another 
option is to charge for a specific number of times an ad 
is displayed, called CPI (cost per impression).
Research This: Locate at least two articles discussing 
targeting ads on online social networks. How do the 
businesses place their ads based on the users’ online 
identities and profiles? What steps are taken to ensure 
the users’ privacy? Should users expect companies to 
collect data about some of their online behaviors in 
return for using the websites at no charge?

Search Skills 
Verifying Your Search Results
Even though a link to a website or other online 
resource may appear first in your list of search results, 
the information it presents may not be accurate. 
Several strategies exist to help you determine the 
credibility of search results. Verify the information 
you read by finding supporting information on other 
websites or by comparing search results from differ-
ent search engines. Often authors will provide links 
to sources within or at the end of an article. Search 
for information about the author to help determine 
his or her credibility, authenticity, or objectivity. Some 
articles may present opinions, not facts.
If you do not recognize or have doubts about 
the domain name of a website you are reading, type 
the search text, whois, in a search engine to locate the 
Instructions: Use a search engine or another search tool to locate the information requested or answers to questions presented in the exercises. 
Describe your findings, along with the search term(s) you used and your web source(s), in the format requested by your instructor (brief report, 
presentation, discussion, blog post, video, or other means).
 Internet Research

WhoIs database. Then type the domain name of the 
website in question (such as cengagebrain.com) in 
the WhoIs search box to find its owner. You then can 
search for more information about the website’s owner. 
If you are looking for time-sensitive information, check 
the date when the links or pages were updated. If a 
webpage is filled with ads or pop-ups, it may be a scam.
Research This: Use a search engine to answer these 
questions and report your findings. (1) Find an article 
on Wikipedia about relational databases. What refer-
ences reinforce the statements in the article? (2) Find 
a popular blog about CRM systems and use WhoIs 
to determine the blog’s owner. (3) Search for a news 
article about web databases and then find two addi-
tional articles by the same author on a similar topic. 
(4) Search for information about the five most popular 
content management systems in use today. Do different 
websites give you different results? How was ­popularity 
determined?

When you use supermarket loyalty cards, enter 
contests, complete warranty registrations, apply 
for credit cards, and subscribe to newsletters, busi-
nesses automatically store personal data about you, 
your transactions, and your preferences in their 
marketing databases. They often use this data to 
analyze sales, develop advertising campaigns, and 
solicit more business from you. Unbeknownst 
to many ­consumers, some companies also sell or 
rent this data to other businesses for the purpose 
of ­developing ­interest-based or online behavioral 
advertising. Consumers can refuse to receive tar-
geted email ­messages and marketing materials, but 
they often must search the websites or paper forms 
for check boxes to indicate these opt-out prefer-
ences. Some consumer advocates view this practice 
as an invasion of privacy and urge businesses to 
default to not adding consumers’ information to 
databases unless the consumer opts in to receive 
­additional materials.
Research This: Visit at least two websites that include 
opt-in or opt-out provisions and read the disclosure 
notices. What steps can you take to remove yourself 
from databases? Which organizations help protect 
consumers and offer information on maintaining 
online privacy? Then, search for at least two market-
ing companies that provide online direct advertising 
campaigns. How do these companies use databases to 
match consumers’ buying preferences with targeted 
offers?

Cloud Services 
Online Databases (DaaS)
Accessing information from online databases is an 
­example of data as a service (DaaS), a service of cloud 
computing that provides data on demand for use in 
applications or visualizations. Federal, state, and local 
governments provide data online to promote trans-
parency and enable users to perform research online. 
Independent data markets are websites that aggregate 
and offer data from leading providers, along with web-
based tools for exploring, analyzing, and visualizing 
online data. Data providers make the data available to 
developers through an API (application programming 
interface), who incorporate the data in new products, 
such as web or mobile apps. Users often can explore 
the data through a web interface.
Research This: (1) Use a search engine to find and 
visit the open data site for your city, state, or country’s 
government. Select a topic for which data is available, 
and use the online tools provided to explore a data 
set and create a visualization in the form of a map or 
graph. (2) Use a search engine to find and visit an inde-
pendent data market website, and browse the data sets 
listed. Select one of the data sets and read about the 
data it contains. How might an app make use of this 
data? What pricing models are available for developers 
who wish to incorporate this data into their apps?

Chapter 11  Building Solutions
Critical Thinking
Instructions: Evaluate the situations below, using personal experiences and one or more resources available to you (such as articles on the web or 
in print, blogs, podcasts, videos, television, user guides, other individuals, electronics or computer stores, etc.). Perform the tasks requested in each 
­exercise and share your deliverables in the format requested by your instructor (brief report, presentation, discussion, blog post, video, or other means).
The Critical Thinking exercises challenge your assessment and decision-making skills by 
presenting real-world situations associated with chapter concepts. The Collaboration 
exercise should be completed with a team.
1.	Online Movie Reviews  
Information about movie titles and television shows 
is available from the web database IMDb (Internet 
Movie Database). Visitors can search IMDb using by 
title, cast member, year produced, characters, genre, 
awards, or other criteria. Each movie or show’s listing 
offers a brief description and rating and includes links 
to such items as summary, trivia, reviews, quotes, and 
even streaming video options.
Do This: Visit imdb.com and search for both recently 
released and classic movies. Explain the steps you used 
to query the movie database. Assess how complete the 
information provided was. Who would benefit most 
from using the movie database? Why? Answer the 
following questions about your experiences. Did the 
information provided differ when viewing recently 
released titles versus classic movies? What did you 
learn from your queries? Can you identify a few fields 
that are included in the records for each movie? What 
interactive features can you identify? Can you find any 
HTML5 features that have been incorporated?
2.	Spreadsheets versus Databases  
Some individuals and small organizations prefer 
using spreadsheets instead of databases. People who 
use spreadsheets might argue that similar to databases, 
spreadsheets have columns and rows, and you can keep 
track of different sets of data in individual worksheets. 
This is similar to how you would use tables in a 
database to store different data sets. In addition, some 
find it easier to install, use, and maintain spreadsheet 
software than database software. After reading this 
chapter, you are convinced that databases have 
additional advantages, such as the capability of storing 
more data and more quickly searching for data, as well 
as generating reports.
Do This: Prepare information aimed toward ­individuals 
who prefer spreadsheets to databases. Include reasons 
why it is not advisable to store large amounts of data in 
spreadsheets, as well as 
the reporting and query-
ing capabilities of data-
bases. Explain benefits 
for using a database for 
collaborating and shar-
ing information among 
­departments in a business.
3.	Case Study
Amateur Sports League  You are the new manager 
for a nonprofit amateur soccer league. The league 
uses a database to store information about its players, 
teams, schedules, and statistics. The league’s website 
uses information stored in the database to display 
team rosters, league standings, and events. The board 
of directors has asked you to investigate how the 
league should secure its database.
Do This: Using information learned in the ­chapter 
as well as performing additional research, prepare 
­information about securing a database. What risks 
­exist for databases? Who should determine the secu-
rity measures to take? What should you include in the 
database security policy? Include recommendations for 
backing up data, validation, maintenance, and assign-
ing different access levels to employees, coaches, and 
players. Is the league responsible for security breaches 
that put players’ personal data at risk? Why or why 
not? Compile your findings.
4.	System Development Life Cycle  A major retail company has hired your team to create and implement the steps in 
the system development life cycle (SDLC) to create custom inventory software.
Do This: Assign SDLC steps to different teammates and compile a plan for each step. Share your findings. Does the 
plan contain gaps? Do any steps or tasks overlap? What guidelines should you follow during system development? 
What roles are needed? How might you use project management software? As a team, answer the following questions 
to share with the retail company: Would you use a compiler or an interpreter? Why? Would you use an object-orient-
ed programming language? Why or why not? What types of information gathering techniques would be most effec-
tive? Why? Would you recommend outsourcing parts of the process? Why or why not? What is necessary to create a 
prototype of the project? Search for popular programming languages. Find industry experts’ reviews of each language. 
Can you find an example of a program that uses each language? Which language might be best suited to this project? 
Why? As a team, compile your findings and share your recommendation with the class.

Chapter 12  Working in the Enterprise
Information Systems in the Enterprise
Businesses, and their employees, use many types of systems. A system is a set of ­components 
that interact to achieve a common goal. A billing system, for example, allows a company 
to send invoices and receive payments from customers. Through a payroll system, employ-
ees receive paychecks — often deposited directly into their bank accounts. A manufac-
turing ­system ­produces the goods that customers order. Very often, these systems also 
are ­information ­systems. Recall from Chapter 11 that an information system is a set of 
­hardware, ­software, data, ­people, and procedures that work together to produce information. 
Information systems support daily, short-term, and long-range information requirements of 
users in a company.
To assist with sound decision making, information must have value. For it to be valuable, 
information should be accurate, verifiable, timely, organized, accessible, useful, and cost 
­effective.
• Accurate information is error free. Inaccurate information can lead to incorrect decisions. 
For example, consumers assume their credit reports are accurate. If your credit report 
incorrectly shows past-due payments, a bank may not lend you money for a vehicle or 
a house.
• Verifiable information can be proven as correct or incorrect. For example, security personnel 
at an airport usually request some type of photo identification to verify that you are the 
person named on the ticket.
• Timely information is useful only within a specific time period. A decision to build additional 
schools in a particular district should be based on the most recent census report — not on one 
that is 10 years old. Most information loses value with time. Some information, however, such 
as information about trends, gains value as time passes and more information is obtained. For 
example, your transcript gains value as you take more classes.
• Organized information is arranged to suit the needs and requirements of the decision maker. 
Two different people may need the same information presented in a different manner. For 
example, an inventory manager may want an inventory report to list out-of-stock items first. 
The purchasing agent, instead, wants the report alphabetized by vendor.
• Accessible information is available when the decision maker needs it. Having to wait for 
information may delay an important decision. For example, a sales manager cannot decide 
which sales representative deserves the award for highest annual sales if the December sales 
have not been entered in the database yet.
• Useful information has meaning to the person who receives it. Most information is 
important only to certain people or groups of people. Always consider the audience when 
collecting and reporting information. Avoid distributing useless information. For example, 
an announcement of an alumni association meeting is not useful to students who have not 
graduated yet.
• Cost-effective information should provide more value than it costs to produce. An organization 
occasionally should review the information it produces to determine if it still is cost effective to 
produce. Some organizations create information only on demand, that is, as people request it, 
instead of on a regular basis. Many make information available online so that users can access it 
as they need it.

Functional Units
A large organization, commonly referred to as an enterprise, requires special ­computing 
­solutions because of its size and geographic distribution. A typical enterprise consists of 
a wide variety of departments, centers, and divisions — collectively known as ­functional 
units. Examples of functional units include human resources, manufacturing, and ­customer ­service.

Enterprise Resource Planning
Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) integrates MRP II with the information flow across 
an organization to manage and coordinate the ongoing activities of the enterprise, ­including 
product planning, manufacturing and distribution, accounting and finance, sales, human 
resources, and customer support.
Advantages of ERP include complete integration of information systems across departments, 
better project management, and improved customer service. Complete integration means 
­information is shared rapidly, and management receives a more complete and timely view of 
the organization through the information. Project management software often is standardized 
across an enterprise so that different parts of the enterprise easily can integrate and collaborate 
on their planning and logistics. Figure 12-2 illustrates how ERP encompasses all major activities 
of an enterprise.

•  Manufacturing Resource Planning II (MRP II) is an extension of MRP 
that also includes product packaging and shipping, machine scheduling, 
financial planning, demand forecasting, tracking labor productivity, and 
monitoring product quality.
Marketing
•  Market research systems analyze data gathered from demographics and

•  Customer relationship management (CRM) manages information about 
customers, past purchases, interests, and the day-to-day interactions, 
such as phone calls, email messages, web communications, and Internet 
messaging sessions.

Some information systems are used exclusively by only one type of functional unit within 
the enterprise. Table 12-1 lists some of the more common information systems that are used 
by functional units in a typical enterprise. Other information systems that support activities of 
­several functional units include enterprise resource planning, document management systems, 
and content management systems.

Document Management Systems
Some organizations use document management systems to make collaboration possible among 
employees. A document management system (DMS) allows for storage and management of 
a company’s documents, such as word processing documents, presentations, and spreadsheets. 
A central library stores all documents within a company or department. The system supports 
access control, security, version tracking of documents, and search capabilities; it also gives users 
the ability to check out documents to review or edit them and then check them back in when 
finished. This information can be used for searches within the document repository. Web-based 
application document management systems allow individuals and any organization to enjoy 
the benefits of document management systems as applications running in a browser. Users are 
granted access to certain parts of the repository, depending on their needs.

Content Management Systems
A content management system (CMS) enables and manages the publishing, ­modification, 
organization, and access of various forms of documents and other files, including media 
and webpages, on a network or the web. CMSs include information about the files and data 
­(metadata). For example, the metadata for a company’s employee manual may include the 
author’s name, revision number, a brief summary, and last revision date. A CMS also provides 
security controls for the content, such as who is allowed to add, view, and modify content and on 
which content the user is allowed to perform those operations.
Users add content to a CMS through a graphical user interface or webpage. Based on the 
user’s actions, the CMS processes content, categorizes the content, indexes the content so that it 
later can be searched, and stores the content. Users then access the content stored in the system 
through a website, company portal, or other application. Read Secure IT 12-1 for security issues 
related to CMSs.

How Secure Are Content  
Management Systems?
Content management systems (CMSs) 
­control many websites and online 
­applications. Much of their popularity is 
due to their ease of use, especially because 
CMS operators need minimal technical skills 
to organize and update documents and 
files. This simplicity, however, is one reason 
cyberthieves can accomplish malicious 
attacks. The operators’ lack of networking 
and security knowledge exposes the CMSs 
to security risks, especially distributed denial 
of service attacks (discussed in Chapter 5).
The United States Computer Emergency 
Readiness Team (US-CERT) and other 
organizations assess CMS vulnerabilities 
and offer specific actions for operators to 
follow. These practices include limiting the 
amount of website content that is displayed 
automatically, installing updates regularly, 
changing passwords, removing unused files, 
and using antivirus programs.
Because of the CMS’s vulnerabilities, some 
security experts recommend the alternative 
of using HTML and uploading webpages to 
a web server. HTML allows the programmer 
to specify precisely how the custom page will 
be displayed instead of relying on the CMS’s 
templates. It also alleviates the need to install 
software upgrades and security updates. A 
person skilled in HTML programming may be 
able to develop and maintain a small, static 
website more quickly than having to conquer 
the steep learning curve that is associated 
with some CMSs.
  Consider This: Under which 
­circumstances would a company ­consider 
coding HTML directly, rather than maintain-
ing a CMS to develop its website? How 
would a company evaluate and select 
a ­particular CMS?
Other Enterprise-Wide Information Systems
Some enterprise-wide information systems focus on the collection, organization, and sharing 
of information so that users can make decisions based on an up-to-date and accurate view of the 
information. The following sections discuss these information systems.
Transaction Processing Systems  A transaction processing system (TPS) is an information 
­system that captures and processes data from day-to-day business activities. Examples of 
transactions are deposits, payments, orders, and reservations. When you use a credit card 
to purchase an item, you are interacting with a transaction processing system.
Consider This
What are uses of a CMS?
Publishing entities, such as news services, use CMSs to keep websites and web feeds up to date. As news or 
information is published, it is categorized and updated on the appropriate sections of the website. For example, 
a sportswriter may submit a story to the CMS and add metadata that indicates the story is a headline story. The 
CMS categorizes the story so that it is displayed as the first item with a large headline on the sports section of 
the website and included in the sports section’s web feed. The CMS indexes the information in the story so that 
users who search the website based on keywords in the story will find a link to the story. Bloggers use CMSs to 
post to their blogs without having to format each entry manually in HTML. Blog posts can be categorized so that 
readers can search by category for posts on the same topic. Blogs also are searchable. Readers can use the CMS 
to comment on blog posts, and the blog owner may need to approve the comments before they are published.
	
BTW
TPS
Transaction processing 
systems were among 
the first computerized 
systems that processed 
business data. Many 
people initially used the 
term, data processing, to 
refer to the functions of 
these systems.

Chapter 12  Working in the Enterprise
Information systems use batch or online transaction processing systems (Figure 12-3). With 
batch processing, the computer collects data over time and processes all transactions later, as a 
group. With online transaction processing (OLTP), the computer processes each transaction as it 
is entered. For example, when you book a flight on the web, the airline probably uses OLTP to 
schedule the flight, book the flight, and send you a ­confirmation message.
Most transaction processing systems today use OLTP because users need information 
­immediately. For some routine processing tasks, such as printing monthly invoices or weekly 
paychecks, they use batch processing.

Management Information Systems  A management information system (MIS) is an 
­information system that generates accurate, timely, and organized information, so that ­managers 
and other users can make decisions, solve problems, supervise ­activities, and track progress. 
Management information systems often are integrated with transaction processing systems and 
focus on creating information that managers and other users need to perform their jobs.
A management information system creates three basic types of reports: detailed, summary, and 
exception (Figure 12-4). A detailed report usually lists just transactions. For example, a Detailed 
Flight Report lists the number of passengers booked for a given flight. A summary report consoli-
dates data usually with totals, tables, or graphs, so that managers can review it quickly and ­easily. 
An exception report identifies data outside of a normal condition. These out-of-the-ordinary 
conditions, called the exception criteria, define the normal activity or ­status range. For example, a 
Premier Club Booking Exception Report notifies the airline’s marketing department that some 
flights have not met minimum goals for booking Premier Club members.

Decision Support Systems  A ­decision 
support system (DSS) helps users 
­analyze ­information and make decisions 
(Figure 12-5). Some decision support systems 
are company specific and designed solely for 
managers. Others are available to everyone 
on the web. Programs that analyze data, 
such as those in a decision support system, 
sometimes are called online analytical processing 
(OLAP) programs.
A decision support system uses data 
from internal and external sources. 
Internal sources of data might include 
databases, sales orders, MRP and MRP II 
results, inventory records, or ­financial data 
from accounting and financial analyses. 
Data from external sources could include 
­interest rates, population trends, or raw 
material pricing.
Some decision support systems include 
their own query languages, statistical analy-
ses, ­spreadsheets, and graphics that help users retrieve data and analyze the results. Some also 
allow managers to create a model of the factors affecting a decision.

Expert Systems  An expert system is an information system that captures and stores 
the knowledge of human experts and then imitates human reasoning and decision ­making 
(Figure 12-6). Expert systems consist of two main components: a knowledge base and 
­inference rules. A knowledge base is the combined subject knowledge and experiences of 
the human experts. The inference rules are a set of logical judgments that are applied to the 
knowledge base each time a user describes a situation to the expert system.
Expert systems help all levels of users make decisions. Enterprises employ expert systems in 
a variety of roles, such as answering customer questions, training new employees, and analyz-
ing data. Expert systems also successfully have resolved such diverse problems as diagnosing 
­illnesses, searching for oil, and making soup.

How do expert systems relate to artificial intelligence?
Expert systems are a component of artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence (AI) is the ­application 
of human intelligence to computers. Artificial intelligence technology senses a person’s actions and, 
based on logical assumptions and prior experience, takes the appropriate action to complete the task. 
Artificial ­intelligence has a variety of capabilities, including speech recognition, logical reasoning, and 
­creative responses.

Information Literacy
Managing the vast amount of information inundating 
us daily can be an overwhelming task, not only for 
those involved in technology careers, but also for any 
digital citizen. This twenty-first century skill set, called 
information literacy, prepares students, employees, and 
citizens to manage information so that they can be 
knowledgeable decision makers.
Defining Information Literacy
More than 25 years ago, the American Library 
Association was the first organization to recognize the 
importance of information literate citizens. As the web 
and the Internet became a mainstay in education, busi-
ness, and home environments, experts realized that the 
traditional basic literacy skills of reading, writing, and 
arithmetic were insufficient for living a productive life. 
According to the Association of College & Research 
Libraries, also needed are lifelong skills “to locate, 
­evaluate, and use effectively the needed information.”
Information Literacy Components
An individual’s quality of existence depends upon 
obtaining quality information. Information literate peo-
ple know how to locate meaningful sources that can be 
used to solve problems, make decisions, and set goals. 
The following five categories are recognized as integral 
literacy components:
•	 Digital literacy: Using computers, mobile devices, 
the Internet, and related technologies effectively is a 
necessity in business and society. Also important is 
an understanding of the general concerns of having 
computers in the world, including their integration 
in employment and education and their effects on 
national and personal security.
•	 Library instruction: Undergraduates rarely seek the 
help of librarians when performing academic research. 
This lack of help may be due, in part, to the fact that 
the students misunderstand the role of the reference 
librarian. Information literate individuals use the librar-
ians’ expertise in locating relevant sources. They also 
understand the necessity of using citations, how infor-
mation is cataloged and organized, search strategies, 
and the process of locating and evaluating resources.
•	 Media literacy: Skills needed to understand how mass 
communication and popular culture affect learning and 
entertainment include the ability to evaluate and ­analyze 
how music, film, video, television, and other nonprint 
media are used effectively to persuade and inform.
•	 Numerical literacy: The ability to use basic math 
skills and interpret data is essential to ­solving ­problems 
and communicating information. Also ­important are 
­understanding how data is gathered and presented in 
graphs, charts, and other visuals and how to interpret 
and verify information presented in media.
•	 Traditional literacy: Individuals who can read and 
­understand a variety of documents are likely to complete 
their educations, obtain employment, and participate 
in community groups. They also need to think critically 
about the material they have read and to ­express their 
thoughts by writing and speaking coherently.
Steps in Effective Research and Composition
Locating appropriate material, organizing these 
sources, and producing the final document require effort 
and careful thought. The following paragraphs discuss 
steps you should take when crafting research, thinking 
critically, and drafting strategies:
•	 Establish an appropriate topic. Identify the purpose 
and audience. Determine an effective method of com-
municating the information, such as a written paper, 
oral presentation, or blog. Explore and narrow the 
topic so that it is manageable within time and logistical 
constraints. Determine the audience’s familiarity with 
the topic and the need to find reference materials.
•	 Identify sources. Determine where to locate 
­electronic and print resources, including web-
sites, media, databases, and printed materials. 
Differentiate between primary and secondary 
sources, popular and scholarly articles, and 
current and historical materials.
•	 Evaluate materials. Analyze the sources to 
determine reliability, accuracy, timeliness, and 
bias. Compare the materials to determine if 
the authors agree or disagree with topics.
•	 Create the final work. Organize and 
integrate the source material using direct 
quotations, paraphrases, and summaries. 
Document the work to credit sources and 
avoid plagiarism. Integrate photos, charts, 
and graphs when necessary to clarify the 
message. Use the writing process to ­create, 
review, revise, and proofread.

  Consider This: Test your skills at effective 
research by examining a website for a vehicle you 
would consider purchasing. Describe the photos, colors, 
placement of objects, and description. Who is the 
intended audience? Is any information missing from the 
website? What message is the company attempting to 
send? Do you think the message achieves its purpose?

Technology Careers
With billions of dollars in annual revenue, the technology industry is a major source of career 
opportunities worldwide. This industry has created thousands of high-tech career opportuni-
ties, even in organizations whose primary business is not technology-related. As technology 
changes, so do the available careers and requirements. New careers are available in social media 
and mobile technologies that did not exist a few years ago. For this reason, you should stay up to 
date with technology developments.
General Business and Government Organizations and Their IT Departments
Business and government organizations of all sizes use a variety of computers, mobile devices, 
and other technology. Most use networks to ensure seamless communications among employees, 
vendors, and customers. They 
also use webpages, email, mobile 
apps, online social networks, 
and more to communicate with 
the public.
Larger organizations use 
­computers and other technology 
to answer and route phone calls, 
process orders, update inventory, 
and manage accounts receiv-
able, accounts payable, billing, 
and payroll activities. Many use 
mobile devices, web conferenc-
ing, and VPNs (virtual private 
networks) to stay connected 
with employees who work in 
other locations or who tele-
commute (Figure 12-7). Read

Set Up Your Home Office  
for Telecommuting
Telecommuting mutually benefits ­employers 
and employees. Employers do not have to 
pay for the physical infrastructure (includ-
ing office space and parking) for the 
employee, and telecommuters often work 
more hours than those who physically 
­commute to an office. Employees benefit 
from not having to commute and from 
­having a comfortable work environment. 
The following guidelines describe how to 
set up your home office for telecommuting:
•	 Choose a location in your home that is free 
from noise and distractions. If your home 
is occupied by others during the hours you 
plan to telecommute, your office should be 
located away from potentially noisy areas. 
For example, an office next to a room 
where someone else is watching television 
may not be an ideal choice.
•	 Make sure your office has a comfortable 
desk and chair. Although it may be tempt-
ing to sit on your couch with your laptop 
while you work, having a professional 
workspace will increase productivity.
•	 Consider acquiring additional furniture, 
such as a file cabinet and bookshelf, espe-
cially if you plan to store files and books 
for reference.
•	 If required, verify your office has a 
­sufficient Internet connection. If you are 
using a wired connection, one should be 
available near your desk. If you are using 
a wireless network, make sure the signal 
strength is sufficient in your office.
•	 Make sure the office has a phone to 
place and receive calls. If you will be 
­relying on a mobile phone, verify your 
phone can receive a strong signal and 
has a ­conveniently located charger and 
power outlet.
•	 Use a headset with your phone to 
­minimize background noise.
•	 Obtain supplies that typically are found in 
an office setting, such as writing utensils, 
paper, tape, a stapler, paper clips, and 
sticky notes.
•	 If your employer does not provide a 
computer for your use, make sure your 
computer is sufficiently equipped to 
complete your job tasks. Make sure you 
also have accessories, such as USB flash 
drives and other external storage media, 
if necessary.
•	 Consider obtaining an all-in-one printer that 
can print scan, copy, and fax (if necessary), 
as well as extra printer cartridges.
  Consider This: What other ­equipment, 
supplies, and furniture would you ­prefer 
to have in an office from where you 
­telecommute?
How To 12-1
Ethics & Issues 12-1
Is Telecommuting Good or Bad  
for Business?
Studies show that nearly 80 percent of 
­workers dream of leaving the confines of an 
office to work from the comfort of home, 
at least part of the time. Although employ-
ees may view working from home as an 
ideal ­situation, some bosses do not agree. 
An Internet CEO, for example, made news 
when she reviewed data such as employees’ 
­sign-ins to the company’s VPN (virtual private 
­network) and discovered that many employ-
ees were not working during company hours. 
As a result, the CEO made the decision to 
end telecommuting at her company.
Supporters cite reduced pollution and 
commuting time. Other benefits include 
increased productivity due to lack of 
office gossip and politics. Many feel that 
they could not be as dedicated to their 
jobs without telecommuting because 
of the flexible hours and closeness to 
home. Others feel that trusted employees 
should have the privilege if they earn it. 
Companies benefit by saving on resources, 
such as office space.
Opponents claim that some lack the 
self-discipline to work remotely. Employees 
may be distracted more easily without 
direct management supervision. Some 
workers have difficulty setting appropriate 
boundaries regarding childcare or other 
family obligations. Additionally, productivity 
actually may decrease if employees stagger 
work hours to fit their schedule, limiting times 
when employees can schedule meetings.
Many experienced workers agree that 
telecommuting cannot replace valuable 
face-to-face time with coworkers, vendors, 
and customers. Some workers fear 
telecommuting because they feel that 
the lack of a personal relationship with 
managers puts them at the top of the list 
for downsizing.
Consider This: Is telecommuting good 
or bad for business? Why? Are some 
­businesses or positions better suited for 
telecommuting? If so, which ones? Do 
some people lack the self-discipline to be 
­productive while telecommuting? If so, 
how should managers determine whether 
to allow this practice and who may 
­participate?

Chapter 12  Working in the Enterprise
Most medium and large businesses and government organizations have an IT (information 
­technology) department. IT staff are responsible for ensuring that all the computer operations, 
mobile devices, and networks run smoothly. They also determine when and if the organiza-
tion requires new hardware, mobile devices, or software. Usually, these jobs are divided into the 
­following areas:
• Management — directs the planning, research, development, evaluation, and integration of 
technology.
• Research and software development — analyzes, designs, develops, and implements new 
information technology and maintains and improves existing systems.
• Technical support services — evaluates and integrates new technologies, administers the 
organization’s data resources, and supports the centralized computer operating system and servers.
• Operations — operates the centralized computer equipment and administers the network, 
including both data and voice communications.
• Training/Support — teaches employees how to use components of the information system or 
answers specific user questions.
• Information security services — develops and enforces policies that are designed to safeguard 
an organization’s data and information from unauthorized users.
• Marketing/Strategy — directs and implements Internet and social media marketing, and 
manages customer relationships.
Technology Equipment
The technology equipment field consists of manufacturers and distributors of ­computers, 
mobile devices, and other hardware, such as magnetic and optical drives, monitors, ­printers, 
and communications and networking devices. In addition to the companies that make 
­end-user ­equipment, thousands of companies manufacture components used inside a com-
puter or mobile device, such as chips, motherboards, cables and 
connectors, and power ­supplies.
Available careers in this field include positions with ­companies 
that design, manufacture, and produce computers and input, 
­output, communications, mobile, and networking devices. Careers 
include designing and fabricating chips, testing internal com-
ponents (Figure 12-8), assembling computers and devices, and 
­packing finished products.

about technology equipment manufacturers.
Software and Apps
The software and apps field consists of companies that develop, 
manufacture, and support a wide range of software and apps 
for computers, the web, and mobile devices. Some companies 
specialize in a particular type, such as productivity software or 
tools, or focus on a device type. Other companies — especially 
larger firms, such as Microsoft — produce and sell many types of 
­software that work with both computers and mobile devices and 
may use Internet services to sync data among devices or provide 
­collaborative features.
Some employees develop desktop, web, and mobile apps, such 
as productivity software, games, simulations, and more; ­others 
develop operating systems and related tools. Read Secure IT 12-2

Secure It 12-2 
Using Unlicensed Software Is a Crime
Software publishers own the copyright to 
their products. These companies are on the 
lookout for copies of their software that 
have been duplicated, distributed, or used 
without their permission. The pirated soft-
ware denies these publishers revenue they 
would have earned from sales, which they 
could have used to produce new products 
and improve current products. A recent 
Business Software Alliance (BSA) Global 
Software Survey revealed that 43 percent 
of all software has been installed without 
proper licensing, including one in five 
pieces in the United States. This software is 
valued at more than $62 billion.
Software may be considered unlicensed 
in a number of circumstances: it could have 
been downloaded illegally from file-sharing 
websites, it could have an expired license, or 
it could be installed on multiple computers 
when the license specifies use on only one 
computer. Using unlicensed software violates 
copyright laws and is subject to serious 
criminal and civil penalties up to $150,000 
for each illegal copy. It is important, 
therefore, to understand when software can 
be copied legally. In most circumstances, the 
software owner can make one copy of the 
software for backup purposes. Many people 
make multiple copies, however, either to 
share or to sell. Often the sharing is done 
online. In one survey, more than 50 percent 
of students and 25 percent of instructors 
admitted that they have copied or would 
copy software illegally.
People and companies copy software 
illegally for a variety of reasons, insisting 
that software prices are too high, that 
software often is copied for educational 
or other altruistic purposes, that copied 
software makes people more productive, 
that no restrictions should be placed on 
the use of software after it is purchased, 
and that software copying is a widespread 
practice. They also may not be aware that 
their actions are illegal, but ignorance is 
not an excuse for illegal actions.
Along with the risk of facing litigation, 
people and businesses using unlicensed 
software risk data theft and unauthorized 
access to their information because 
they are not receiving program updates 
and patches that could prevent hacking 
attempts. If people discover unlicensed 
software being used on a computer at 
work or at school, the best practice is to 
report this situation to managers or IT 
authorities. The Business Software Alliance 
encourages people to call its hotline 
and promises to keep the information 
confidential.
  Consider This: What penalties should 
be imposed for using unlicensed software? 
Why? Can you counter the reasons people 
give for copying software illegally? How? 
Would you copy software illegally, even if 
your boss told you to copy it? Why or why 
not? Should software vendors be allowed 
to probe your computer secretly for illegally 
installed software? Why or why not?
Technology Service and Repair
The technology service and repair field provides preventive 
­maintenance, component installation, and repair services to 
­customers (Figure 12-9). Some technology service technicians 
­possess ­general knowledge that enables them to work with a variety 
of devices from different manufacturers. Other technicians receive 
training and ­certifications directly from manufacturers to specialize 
in devices from that manufacturer. This work is best suited for those 
individuals who like to troubleshoot and solve problems and who have 
a strong ­background in electronics.
Many technology equipment manufacturers include diagnostic 
software with their computers and devices that assists technicians 
in identifying problems. Today’s technology also allows technicians 
to diagnose and repair software problems from a remote location; 
that is, the technician accesses the user’s hard drive or smartphone 
from a different location. Read Ethics & Issues 12-2 to consider the 
trustworthiness of computer repair services.

Technology Sales
Technology salespeople must possess a general understanding of technology and a specific 
knowledge of the product they are selling. Strong people skills are important, including a 
keen listening ability and superior verbal communications. Technology salespeople ­generally 
­determine buyers’ needs and direct buyers toward devices, computers, and apps that meet 
their needs.
Some salespeople work 
directly for technology equip-
ment manufacturers, mobile 
device manufacturers, or soft-
ware manufacturers. Others 
work for resellers, including 
retailers that sell personal 
computer products. The 
technology salesperson in a 
retail store often is a suitable 
entry-level job for students 
working toward a certificate 
or degree in computer-related 
fields (Figure 12-10). Before 
consulting the opinion of a 
salesperson, be sure to inde-
pendently research the prod-
uct so that you can better 
determine whether answers to 
your ­questions are unbiased. 
Read How To 12-2 to learn 
how to evaluate extended 
­warranty options.
Ethics & Issues 12-2
Can You Trust Data Recovery or 
Computer Repair Services?
While doing legitimate data recovery and 
device support tasks, IT workers and com-
puter repair technicians often have access 
to confidential information. Most often 
you need to provide your password and 
access to your network, computer, or device 
during service. In doing so, you also give 
access to financial information, confidential 
records, email and other communications, 
and ­passwords. The result could be leaked 
­information or identity theft.
IT workers often sign agreements with 
organizations stating that they will not 
access any information that is not critical 
to their jobs. Information systems at many 
government agencies and some organizations 
log all access to sensitive information. In 
some high-profile cases, organizations fired 
or suspended workers after log information 
proved they violated policies.
In one state, the law requires computer 
repair technicians who review or analyze 
data to have a private investigator license. 
The law implies that the technician is 
performing an investigation, in a sense, when 
business managers and parents hire them 
to analyze the computer usage habits of 
employees or children.
Privacy experts recommend backing up 
and wiping all data before turning over your 
computer or device to an IT or computer 
repair technician. You may assume that 
these professionals likely will follow ethical 
guidelines. It can be difficult, however, to 
repair the effects of unauthorized access, use, 
or distribution of your data.
Consider This: What should the 
­consequences be for IT or computer repair 
technicians who access unauthorized 
data? Why? Would licensing and requiring 
­training lessen the impact of unauthor-
ized access? Why or why not? How can

Evaluate Extended Warranty Options
When you purchase electronic devices, such as 
computers and mobile devices, retailers and 
third-party vendors typically offer an extended 
warranty on the computer or device. These 
warranties, which are available for a fee, offer 
services that extend beyond what the device’s 
manufacturer’s warranty covers. For example, 
extended warranties may include replacing 
parts that break after the manufacturer’s war-
ranty expires, accidental damage, or replacing 
parts that become worn as a result of normal 
wear and tear. The following guidelines describe 
how to evaluate extended ­warranty options:
•	 Extended warranties can be offered by 
the manufacturer, retailer, or a third party. 
Extended warranties offered by a third party 
sometimes can be less expensive, but it may 
be more difficult to obtain service for your 
device. With an extended warranty that is 
offered by the manufacturer or retailer, it may 
be easier and faster to obtain service.
•	 Evaluate the manufacturer’s warranty 
and what it covers. You may find that the 
additional coverage an extended warranty 
provides may not be worth the cost, so do 
your research first on the manufacturer’s war-
ranty. Do not rely on a salesperson to inform 
you of what a manufacturer’s warranty does 
and does not cover.
•	 Determine an appropriate length for the 
extended warranty. For example, if you 
believe the device will be used for only three 
years before you will consider replacing it, do 
not purchase an warranty that extends longer 
than three years.
•	 Compare the cost of the warranty with costs 
associated with repairing or replacing the 
device. It may be less expensive to pay for 
one or two repairs instead of purchasing an 
extended warranty.
•	 Carefully research devices before you 
purchase them. Read reviews from people 
who have purchased the same device, and 
stay away from devices that are prone to 
problems. By purchasing a reliable d­evice, you 
reduce the need for an ­extended warranty.
•	 Consider purchasing accidental damage 
protection. This protection offers either 
a repair or replacement of devices that 
are damaged accidentally. For example, 
if you drop your phone and the screen 
cracks, accidental damage protection may 
cover the repair. The number of repairs 
or replacements offered through an 
accidental damage protection plan may 
be limited, so do your research before 
purchasing it.
•	 Do not fall for sales tactics. Salespeople often 
earn commission or receive incentives for sell-
ing extended warranties. For this reason, they 
will make every effort to convince you of the 
possibility that something could go wrong. 
Educating yourself and determining the risk 
you want to take before purchasing your 
device will help you make a more informed 
decision about purchasing an extended 
warranty.
  Consider This: Have you ever purchased 
an extended warranty? What other factors do 
you consider when determining whether to 
purchase an extended warranty?

Technology Education, Training, and Support
Schools, colleges, universities, and private companies all need qualified educators to provide 
technology-related education and training. The high demand in this field has led to a shortage 
of qualified instructors at the college level as instructors increasingly move to careers in private 
industry, which offers the promise of higher pay.
Corporate trainers teach employees how to use software and apps, design and develop 
­systems, write programs, integrate and sync data from apps used on multiple devices, and 
­perform other technology-related activities (Figure 12-11). Many large companies use their 
own training departments. 
Corporations usually require less 
educational background for train-
ers than educational institutions 
require for instructors.
In a more informal setting, a help 
desk specialist answers hardware, 
software, and networking ­questions 
in person, over the phone, or elec-
tronically via email or a chat room. 
Educational requirements for help 
desk specialists are less stringent 
than they are for other careers 
in the technology field. The help 
desk specialist position is an ideal 
­entryway into the IT field.
BTW
Instructors
Your instructors may be 
helpful resources when 
you are looking for a 
job. Because of their 
professional experience, 
they may be able to 
connect you with 
potential employers, 
recommend classes you 
should take, or suggest 
internship opportunities.

IT Consulting
Technology professionals sometimes become IT consultants after gaining experience in one or 
more technology-related areas, such as software development, systems analysis and design, network 
configuration, developing mobile devices, using social media, or web development. An IT consultant, 
typically hired based on expertise, provides technology services to his or her clients. Large enter-
prises often hire teams of consultants to offer advice about technology-related concerns. IT consul-
tants must possess strong technical skills in their specialized area and must be able to communicate 
effectively to clients. Read Ethics & Issues 12-3 to consider the effects of outsourcing IT jobs.
Ethics & Issues 12-3
Is Outsourcing Jobs Wrong?
Companies have a long history of ­outsourcing, 
or relying on outside companies to perform 
certain tasks. Outsourcing enables companies 
to find workers with specialized experience 
and to control costs. When a company sends 
jobs overseas, outsourcing becomes offshoring. 
A skilled computer professional in the United 
States typically commands a higher salary than 
an IT worker in other countries. To remain com-
petitive, many companies have chosen to send 
computer jobs abroad.
Proponents say that the United States 
has a long history of outsourcing all types of 
work when the economics of the situation 
demands it. Companies feel that they have 
a right to choose to send business tasks 
abroad if it saves costs. Foreign economies 
benefit when companies hire and pay 
workers a fair wage and provide benefits. 
American consumers benefit from the 
reduced cost of goods.
Opponents say that offshoring results in 
unemployment and harms the economy. 
Others are concerned that sensitive work, such 
as health record maintenance or weapons 
manufacturing, could place U.S. citizens at risk. 
Some experts state that the work done abroad 
should be easy to manage and quantifiable in 
order to ensure it meets company standards. 
Some companies have received negative 
press due to inefficiencies in call centers and 
customer support located abroad.
Government officials and lawmakers 
struggle with policies regarding offshoring, 
especially with regard to taxing workers. 
Politicians debate whether or not companies 
who keep business in the United States 
should receive tax breaks. Many argue that 
the Unites States should require companies 
who hire foreign workers to pay a fair salary 
and provide benefits comparable to those for 
American workers.
Consider This: Should the government 
limit a company’s ability to outsource 
computer jobs to other countries? Why 
or why not? Should companies receive 
criticism for outsourcing jobs? Why or 
why not? What are some possible alter-
natives to outsourcing that would help 
to keep a company competitive? What 
steps can people take in their careers to 
avoid becoming a victim of outsourcing? 
Would you pay more money for goods 
manufactured in the United States? Why 
or why not?

Mobile App 
Development
Developers and technology managers should evaluate 
several possible approaches for creating mobile apps, 
and make a decision based on both technical and 
business considerations. Should they invest the time 
and money it takes to develop high-performing native 
apps for many different mobile operating systems? 
Would they be better off creating mobile web apps, 
written using standard web technologies, to run in a 
mobile browser? Or should they use a hybrid, or mixed, 
approach that can simplify the development process 
and lower development costs at the expense of a 
­possible inconsistent user experience across platforms?
Native Apps
A native app is written for mobile devices running a 
­particular mobile phone operating system, such as Google’s 
Android, Apple’s iOS, or Microsoft’s Windows Phone. They 
offer fast performance and can store data for offline use. 
Native apps can access all of a device’s content, including 
its contacts, calendar, and photos, and can interact with 
its hardware, including the microphone, camera, or 
accelerometer to measure movement and motion. For 
example, the native Instagram app shown in the figure 
below can access the device’s camera to take photos.
Apps developed 
for a specific mobile 
platform or device 
generally will not work 
on another without 
significant modification. 
Creating native apps 
requires programming 
languages, presentation 
technologies, and 
development tools 
particular to each 
platform.
After testing to be 
sure it works properly, 
developers deploy, or 
submit, a native app 
to an app store for 
approval and distribution. When deploying native apps 
to Google Play, Apple’s App Store, or the Windows Store, 
developers must ensure that their apps follow rules and 
conditions that their publishers issue. For example, apps 
must run properly, may not contain offensive content, 
and should notify the user when requesting the current 
location or access to information stored on the device. 
Developers pay an annual fee to publish apps in an app 
store. The store retains a percentage of the sales price of 
any apps sold as a commission.
Mobile Web Apps
Mobile web apps are actually websites that provide 
a user experience similar to native apps. Developers 
write them using standard web technologies including 
HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. Mobile web apps are not 
deployed to an app store; rather, they are deployed to a 
web server and users access them in a mobile browser. 
Users, therefore, always have access to the most recent 
version of an app. Creating a shortcut to the app’s 
website and saving it as an icon or tile on a device’s 
home screen provides easy access to the mobile web 
app. Many mobile web apps have a responsive web 
design, so that they will be displayed properly on 
devices with screens of different sizes.
Some companies choose to develop mobile web 
apps so that they can write one app that works on 
all devices that is not subject to the rules of an app 
store. Mobile web apps can access a limited set 
of device features, such as basic gestures, working 
offline, tap-to-call, and GPS, but do not have access 
to native features, such as the camera, microphone, 
accelerometer, and device notifications. For example, 
the Instagram mobile web app shown in the figure 
to the right runs in a browser and only displays 
photos, but does not allow you to take photos 
using your device’s camera.
Hybrid Apps
A hybrid app combines features of native and 
mobile web apps. Like native apps, hybrid apps are 
developed for specific platforms and deployed to 
an app store. They can access many of a device’s 
hardware features, such as its camera. Like mobile 
web apps, they are built with HTML5, CSS, and 
JavaScript. Developers use development tools to 
package this code with a browser and prepare it as 
a native app to deploy to popular app stores. In this 
way, hybrid apps are cross-platform, meaning the 
same code can run on many mobile platforms. This 
approach often saves development time and costs, 
but may not provide a consistent user experience or 
fast performance on all devices.
Discover More: Visit this chapter’s free resources 
to learn more about development technologies for 
creating mobile apps.
  Consider This: If an app is available as both 
a mobile web app and in an app store for you to 
download, which would you be more likely to use? 
Why? Suppose you have a great idea for an app, 
and you raise enough money to hire an experienced 
developer to build it for you. Would you ask the 
developer to code it as a web, hybrid, or native app? 
Why? Does your choice depend on the capabilities 
and requirements of the app?

Technology Certifications
A certification demonstrates your knowledge in a specific area to employers or potential 
employers. Organizations often require technology certification to ensure quality standards and 
to confirm their workforce remains up to date with respect to technology.
Most certification programs do not require academic 
­coursework. Test results alone determine certification. 
Few professionals, however, have the experience and 
skill set to take a certification exam without preparation.
To assist in preparing for a certification exam, several 
training options are available: self-study, online training, 
instructor-led training, and web resources. Authorized 
testing centers provide most certification exams for a 
fee. The exam sponsor’s website ­typically lists testing 
centers near you. On the website, you can schedule and 
pay for your exam (Figure 12-12). At a testing center, 
you may use a computer to take the examination, or you 
may mark your answers on a form that will be read by 
a ­scanner for grading. You likely will know before you 
leave the testing center whether you passed the examina-
tion. Some tests are in a multiple-choice format. Others 
are skill based. If you do not pass an exam, you may have 
to pay the fee again to retake it.
Obtaining a certification requires time and money. Certifications ­demonstrate your commitment 
to your chosen area. When deciding whether to obtain a certification, consider your long-term 
career goals, as well as your current experience. Read evaluations of the certification to determine 
its value in the industry you have chosen. Examine employment ­projections and available job 
opportunities to determine if it is worth obtaining the certification.
Technology certifications are available in many areas, some of which are discussed next.
Application Software Certifications
Although numerous types of application software exist, several programs have achieved national 
recognition for use as business and graphics tools. Most sponsors of application software certifica-
tions have a partner training program and encourage computer-training centers to be authorized 
training representatives. A popular application software certification includes Microsoft Office 
Specialist, which tests a user’s skills of Microsoft Office programs.
As with most other certifications, ­vendor-authorized testing facilities take registrations and 
administer the certification test. People with the following jobs may be interested in application 
software certification:

Secure It 12-3 
Risks of Jailbreaking and Rooting
Copyrights protect creators of original works, 
and digital rights management (DRM) strate-
gies were developed to prevent people from 
pirating the owners’ digital content. (Refer to 
Chapter 5 for details about copyrights and 
piracy.) Hardware manufacturers include DRM 
software on their products to control the apps 
and other programs that can be installed. 
When users want to run unapproved apps and 
customize their smartphones or mobile devices, 
they can make unauthorized modifications to 
the operating system and bypass the DRM 
restrictions. This process, called ­jailbreaking, 
generally refers to ­hacking into Apple’s iPhones 
and iPads, whereas a similar term, rooting, 
refers to products ­running Android and other 
operating systems.
When software developers create apps for 
Apple’s iOS, Apple scrutinizes the software 
to ensure it adheres to strict guidelines. This 
review process helps maintain integrity and 
security. When the phone or mobile device 
is jailbroken, however, this reliability no 
longer exists. Apple states that jailbreaking 
causes these issues: security vulnerabilities, 
instability, shortened battery life, unreliable 
voice and data, disruptions of services, and 
the inability to apply future software updates. 
The unauthorized modification violates the 
end-user license agreement (EULA), so the 
device may no longer be covered by the 
manufacturer’s warranty.
 Consider This: Do you know anyone 
with a jailbroken smartphone or mobile 
device? Should Apple ease the limitations 
that are placed on changing iOS default 
­settings or installing apps and other ­software 
from ­websites other than the App Store?

Programmer/Developer Certifications
Various certifications are available in the programmer/developer area. These certifications 
usually are supported with training programs that prepare applicants for the certification test. 
A popular specific programmer/developer certification includes Google Apps Certified Specialist, 
which tests a user’s skills of administering, selling, and deploying Google Apps. A more broad 
development certification includes Project Management Professional (PMP), which tests knowledge 
of tasks required during system development.
If you are interested in developing applications, you also may benefit from certifications in 
networking and web design. These certifications are closely tied to programming and may 
broaden employment opportunities. People with the following jobs may be interested in a 
­programmer/developer certification:
• Game developers
• IT consultants

Security Certifications
Security certifications measure a candidate’s ability to identify and control security risks 
­associated with any event or action that could cause a loss of or damage to computer ­hardware, 
software, data, information, or processing capability. (Read Secure IT 12-4 to ­consider the 
effects of inadequately protected customer data.) While some security certifications focus solely 
on network and Internet security, others include measures to secure operating systems, applica-
tion programs, and information systems, as well as the physical facility and its people. A popular 
specific security certification includes Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP), 
which tests in-depth knowledge of access control methods, information systems development, 
cryptography, operations security, physical security, and network and Internet security. Some 
security certifications relate specifically to the area of digital forensics.
People in the following careers may be interested in security certification:
• Information security officers and managers
• Law enforcement officials
• Military intelligence officers
• Network administrators
• Wireless network administrators
• Network security specialists
• Security administrators

Protecting Customer Data
Many for-profit and nonprofit companies and 
organizations have been affected by malware 
intrusions into their point-of-sale systems. 
Hackers have broken into retail servers and 
accessed data for millions of credit and 
debit card accounts. In one situation, they 
broke into a large entertainment company’s 
server, disrupting service to its customers 
and publishing personal data for millions of 
customers, including passwords and possibly 
credit card information. The breached com-
pany allegedly waited one week to inform 
customers about the attack. The hackers who 
exposed this company’s data were part of 
a well-known activist group that routinely 
targets large corporations and government 
agencies to expose data vulnerabilities and to 
protest policies. The group claimed that the 
company had not encrypted the exposed data 
properly. The group’s members are unknown, 
so ­officials are unable to hold them respon-
sible for their actions.
Customers, however, sued the company 
for the breach. One lawsuit stated that the 
company’s lack of encryption and adequate 
firewalls makes it responsible for the hackers’ 
actions. Officials agreed, with one stating, “If 
you are responsible for so many payment card 
details and log-in details, then keeping that 
personal data secure has to be your priority.” 
Customers held the company responsible for 
the delay in notification. The attack ultimately 
cost the company an estimated $170 million. 
Since the breach, the company changed its 
user agreement policies. The new policy states 
that by agreeing to use its products, users give 
up the right to sue for security breaches.
Thousands of other corporate security 
breaches have ranged from email phishing 
schemes to stolen equipment. Cybersecurity 
risks affect all businesses because criminals 
know how to manipulate technology to 
compromise the networks and install 
malware. The U.S. Department of Homeland 
Security, U.S. Secret Service, and the National 
Cybersecurity and Communications Integration 
Center work to locate organized criminal 
groups, warn organizations about potential 
unauthorized access, and detect intrusions. 
They provide information about performing 
risk assessments, installing backup systems, 
and establishing security policies.
 Consider This: Should hackers be 
punished for exposing customer data? Why 
or why not? What expectations of security 
should customers have when they enter 
personal data on a website or form? Should 
companies be able to prevent customers from 
suing them? Why or why not?

Job Searching and Career Planning
Many job opportunities may exist in your industry, so it is important to narrow down the available 
jobs to ones for which you are qualified and in which you are interested. Tools at your disposal 
include the career service department at your school (Figure 12-13), career planning websites, and 
online social networks. Read How To 12-3 to learn how to start your job search online.
Whether you are seeking a new job or currently are employed, you may find a career planning 
website useful. Career planning websites often allow you to post your resume online or enter 
your resume information in a form at the website for potential employers to review. Many also 
offer mobile apps. Examples of popular career planning websites include CareerBuilder, Dice, and 
Monster. Use a search engine to locate these career planning websites and their mobile apps.
Discover More: Visit this chapter’s free resources to learn more about career planning 
­websites.
BTW
Counselors and Alumni
If your school has 
a career center or 
alumni network, take 
advantage of these 
valuable resources. 
Career counselors and 
experienced alumni can 
help you prepare for 
and secure an interview 
in your chosen field. 
They also might provide 
references to potential 
employers.
Start Your Job Search Online
Starting your job search online will help you 
locate available jobs and determine whether 
you are qualified to apply. Performing your 
research online will save time applying and 
interviewing for jobs for which you are not 
qualified. The following steps describe how to 
start your job search online.
1.	 Begin your job search by reviewing the 
information on online social networks, 
job search websites, and organizations’ 
­websites. On these websites, you can learn 
about career opportunities and ­prepare 
for an interview.
2.	 Follow an organization’s activity on 
Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and other 
social media channels.
3.	 Research a company’s online activity to 
become familiar with some of the products, 
services, and opportunities that they provide.
4.	 Visit career services websites hosted by 
your college or university. These websites 
often contain information about career 
fairs, resume planning workshops, and 
campus recruitment activities.
5.	 Consider visiting a career planning 
­website. These websites offer information 
about available jobs and local salaries. You 
also can use them to research corporate 
work environments, technology news, and 
opportunities for professional networking.
6.	 Upload your resume to career planning 
websites and job search websites. Create 
the resume in a word processing program 
and then save it in the PDF format so that it 
has a consistent appearance when viewed 
on a variety of computers or mobile devices.
   Consider This: Have you ever searched 
for a job online? Why or why not? If so, were 
you successful in finding a job for which you 
were qualified?

Mini Feature 12-3: Creating a Professional Online Presence
In addition to the information provided in a job application and resume, many employers will 
search the web to learn more about job candidates. For this reason, both beginning and estab-
lished technology professionals promote themselves online. Read Mini Feature 12-3 to learn 
about creating a professional online presence.
BTW
Online Social Networks
Online social networks 
revise their privacy settings 
often. Periodically revisit 
your privacy settings on 
all personal social media 
accounts to ensure you 
have chosen the most 
current options that will 
secure your privacy.
Creating a Professional 
Online Presence
An understanding of the web, digital media, and 
online social networks, such as LinkedIn, is beneficial 
in creating your online presence.
Recommended Online Strategies
A professional online presence that positively 
conveys your accomplishments, skills, interests, 
and personality offers potential employers a more 
complete picture of you beyond what can be conveyed 
in a resume.
•	 Register a form of your name as a domain name and 
host a blog or website at that web address. If your 
name is not available or you do not have access to 
a web server, include your name as part of the web 
address for your website on a free service, such as 
Blogger or WordPress.
•	 Avoid informal or humorous names for your account 
profiles, blog title, or domain name.
•	 Include a photo of yourself that presents your 
best self.
•	 Use a webcam to create a 30-second video 
in which you introduce yourself. In the video, 
­summarize your skills and professional interests. 
Post the video on YouTube or another video 
­sharing site and include a link to it on your blog 
or website.
•	 Upload a PDF file of your resume, and include a link 
to it on your blog or website.
•	 Include links to your LinkedIn and Twitter profiles on 
your blog or website.
•	 Include links to any other publications, articles, 
videos, or digital content you have created.
•	 Create consistent accounts on online social networks. 
Read Ethics & Issues 12-4 to consider ways that 
social media can help in your job search.
•	 Post appropriate content to your blog, website, or 
online social networks regularly.
•	 Before uploading your resume or publishing your 
blog or website, ask at least two people to proofread 
content for any spelling and grammar mistakes. Keep 
the language professional.
Using LinkedIn
LinkedIn is an online social network where 
professionals, such as Reid Hoffman, founder of 
LinkedIn, can create 
profiles and connect with 
coworkers and industry 
colleagues. LinkedIn uses 
the term, contacts, to 
describe the individuals in 
your professional network 
and also stores your 
relationship with each 
contact in your network. 
Read How To 12-4 for 
steps to create a LinkedIn 
profile.
Use LinkedIn to:
•	 Connect with or stay in touch with current and former 
coworkers and classmates.
•	 Follow companies on LinkedIn to stay informed of job 
openings.
•	 Use LinkedIn’s employment database to learn about 
career opportunities. View the job listing to find 
the name of the person who posted the job and to 
determine the connections between you and those 
members you might want to contact in order to learn 
about a company or open jobs.
•	 Join groups of people with similar interests or 
experiences. For example, your school’s alumni group, 
people who work at the same company, people look-
ing to share experiences they had when starting their 
own businesses, and people who use specific apps 
might be willing to share their expertise.
•	 Consider expanding your network by connecting with 
your contacts’ connections. If you invite an extended 
contact to connect, be sure to include a note that 
introduces yourself and indicates your professional 
reason for connecting.

presence and using LinkedIn.
  Consider This: What online resources should you 
use to create a professional online presence? Why? 
What groups or companies should you join or follow 
on LinkedIn? What steps will you take to enhance your 
professional online presence?

Ethics & Issues 12-4 
How Can Social Media Help 
Your Job Search?
It is no secret that what you do or say 
on social media can affect you in the job 
search. As previously mentioned, many 
employers check potential employees’ 
social media profiles, including Facebook, 
Twitter, Google+, and LinkedIn, as part of 
the screening process. You likely are aware 
that you should use privacy settings and to 
be careful what you post, but how can you 
use social media tools to aid you in your 
job search?
Employers not only look for red flags 
(inappropriate or inflammatory posts, 
typographical errors, poor grammar, or 
photos that show unsavory or unethical 
activities), but also for reasons to offer the 
candidate a position. A social media profile 
that presents you as professional and lists 
your qualifications can lead an employer to 
put you ahead of others. Employers also use 
social media to determine if a candidate’s 
personality would fit into the corporate 
culture.
Instead of hiding all information behind 
privacy settings, employment experts 
recommend several social media strategies 
for job seekers. Create a profile that 
shows an interest in topics relevant to 
your profession. Use LinkedIn and other 
resources to follow companies and industry 
professionals to be aware of events, news, 
or job openings. Network with students, 
colleagues, and industry contacts. Present 
consistent information, especially regarding 
education and experience, across all social 
media platforms. Consider using Twitter to 
share industry news, to demonstrate not 
only your interest, but your enthusiasm for 
the field.
Consider This: Does your social media 
presence reflect your interest in your 
desired field? What changes can you 
make so that your profile stands out 
among other job candidates? How does 
your profile compare to ­others in your 
industry? What can you gain by using 
social media to network or find industry 
information?
Create a Professional Presence 
on LinkedIn
Building a professional profile and network 
on LinkedIn can help you locate profession-
als who can introduce you to employees at 
companies where you might like to work. 
In addition, LinkedIn also helps prospec-
tive employers locate you. Upon joining 
LinkedIn, you specify a profile that allows 
contacts, prospective contacts, and others 
to learn about you. The following steps 
describe how to create a professional 
­presence on LinkedIn.
1.	 Include your full name, and avoid using 
nicknames.
2.	 Select and upload a professional photo. 
Consider using a high-quality photo that 
clearly shows your face, and make certain 
you are dressed professionally in the 
photo.
3.	 Include comprehensive information about 
your work experience, education, and 
skills.
4.	 If you have any professional publications, 
websites, or blogs, be sure to list them 
and provide web addresses.
5.	 Build your network on LinkedIn by 
­finding other LinkedIn members to add 
to your network. To see if any of your 
current acquaintances are on LinkedIn, 
you can import email addresses from 
your email address book or import pro-
files of friends from other online social 
networks. LinkedIn also may suggest 
people you may know from a school 
you attended or company for which you 
work(ed).
6.	 Ask other members to provide 
­recommendations about your skills.
7.	 Review your extended contacts (the 
network of your contacts’ contacts) and 
determine whether you should connect 
directly with any of them.
8.	 As your work experience, education, or 
skills change, be sure to promptly update 
your LinkedIn profile.
  Consider This: What professional 
­information is, or will you put, in your 
LinkedIn profile?

Architecture and Design
While walking down the city street, you 
stop to admire a new skyscraper with the 
most striking architectural features you ever 
have seen. You think to yourself that those 
responsible for designing the building are 
nothing less than brilliant. While a great 
deal of time is spent by people designing 
the building, computers and technology also 
play an important role in making the process 
more efficient. Today’s tools allow architects 
and designers to see exactly what a finished 
building will look like before construction 
even begins.
During the preliminary design process, 
architects and design firms use CAD 
software to design the appearance and 
layout of a new building and can provide 
clients with a 3-D walk-through of a 
building so that they can determine whether 
the proposed design will meet their needs. 
Later, the program can be used to include 
the placement of support beams, walls, 
roof shape, and so on, and also conform to 
building codes.
CAD software also allows engineers 
in various fields, such as mechanical 
and electrical, to design separate layers 
in a structure. The software then can 
superimpose the designs to check for 
interactions and conflicts, such as if a 
structural beam in one layer interferes with 
a drain in another layer. The CAD software 
makes it easy to modify and correct the 
structure before it is built, which can save 
time and money during the construction 
process. This software also eliminates most, 
if not all, of the manual drafting required.
Engineers use computers to determine 
the type of foundation required to support 
the building and its occupants; the heating, 
ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC); 
the electrical requirements; and how the 
building may withstand external threats, 
such as hurricanes and tornadoes.
At the conclusion of the architecture and 
design process, contractors can use the 
information from computers to estimate the 
total cost to build the structure. If, while 
construction is ongoing, a need arises to 
modify the building’s design in some way, 
computers can incorporate a change and 
quickly provide plans for the new design.
The next time you notice a building 
under construction, stop to think about how 
computers and technology have increased 
the efficiency of the architecture and design 
process.
  Consider This: How else might 
­computers and technology be used in 
­architecture and design?

1	 Conduct an Effective Interview
Gathering information is an important task, whether 
you are trying to assess whether a job candidate would 
be a good fit for an open position, or if you need to 
gather feedback about a new system you are develop-
ing. An important means of gathering information is 
the personal interview. Interviews must be thorough 
and comprehensive. Prior to conducting an inter-
view, you must determine that an interview is the 
best means for obtaining the information you seek. 
You have learned a variety of ways to obtain informa-
tion, and you should use each of them appropriately. 
Because an interview may interrupt a person’s ­schedule 
and takes time, you must be sure the information 
gained in the interview justifies this interruption. Once 
you have determined you should conduct an interview 
to gather information, plan to ask questions that will 
generate useful answers. The following steps guide you 
through the process of conducting an interview that 
ultimately will generate useful answers.
a. Your questions should directly address the goals 
of the interview. Do not expect the person being 
interviewed to provide a tutorial. Your questions 
must generate answers that supply you with the 
information you need to make a decision.
b. Your questions should be thought-provoking. In 
general, do not ask questions requiring a yes or 
no answer. Your questions should not lead the 
interviewee to an answer — rather, the questions 
should be open-ended and allow the person to 
develop the answer. As an interviewer, never argue 
with the person being interviewed, do not suggest 
answers or give opinions, ask straightforward 
questions rather than compound questions, never 
assign blame for any circumstance that might come 
up in the interview, and never interrupt while the 
person is talking. Finally, you, as the interviewer, 
should not talk much. Remember, you are 
conducting the interview to gain information, and 
it is the person you are interviewing who has that 
information. Let him or her talk.
c. Pay attention carefully, with your ears and your 
eyes. What you hear normally is most important, 
but body language and other movements often 
convey information as well. Concentrate on the 
interviewee — expect that you will make much 
more eye contact with the person than he or 
she will with you. Allow silences to linger — the 
normal impulse in a conversation is to fill the 
silence quickly; in an interview, however, if you are 
quiet, the person being interviewed might think of 
additional information.
d. As you listen, concentrate on the interviewee. 
When points are being made, do not take notes 
because that will distract from what the person 
is saying; stay focused. Once the information has 
been conveyed, jot down a note so that you will 
remember.
e. Throughout the interview, offer reinforcing 
comments, such as, “The way I understand what 
you just said is …” Make sure when you leave the 
interview that no misunderstandings exist between 
you and the person you interviewed.
f. Before you conclude the interview, be sure all your 
goals have been met. You may not have another 
opportunity to interview the person, so ensure 
you have asked sufficient questions to gain the 
information you need to make a decision.
g. After the interview, it is recommended you send a 
follow-up email message or letter to the person you 
interviewed to review the information you learned. 
This message or letter should invite the interviewee 
to correct any errors you made in summing up 
your findings. In addition, for all the people you 
interview, keep a record of the time and place of 
the interview. In this way, if any questions arise 
regarding the interview, you will have a record.
Interviewing Online
If you are not in the same physical location as the people 
you want to interview, it may be better to conduct the 
interview online. If you plan to conduct the interview 
online, consider the following advice:
How To: Your Turn 
 
Instructions: You often can complete tasks using technology in multiple ways. Figure out how to perform the tasks described in these exercises by 
using one or more resources available to you (such as a computer or mobile device, articles on the web or in print, online or program help, user guides, 
blogs, podcasts, videos, other individuals, trial and error, etc.). Summarize your ‘how to’ steps, along with the resource(s) used, in the format requested 
by your instructor (brief report, presentation, discussion, blog post, video, or other means).

 How To: Your Turn
• Plug in the computer or device so that you do not 
have to rely on battery power. If you must rely on 
battery power, be sure that the battery is fully charged.
• Use a wired Internet connection, rather than 
connecting to a wireless network, to minimize the risk 
of losing Internet connectivity during the interview.
• Select a location for the video call that has a neutral 
background and is free from distractions.
• Know how to initiate or receive a video call.
• Exit your email, chat, and other unnecessary 
applications during the interview so that you 
are not distracted or interrupted by alerts and 
notification messages.
• Test the videoconferencing software in advance to 
ensure the configuration works.
• Adjust the microphone, webcam, and speakers before 
the actual interview to ensure optimum call quality.
• Practice switching between the videoconferencing 
app’s chat window and your desktop or a browser 
window, in case you want to share a link, send a file, 
or type a message during the interview.
• Keep your eyes focused on the webcam so that you 
will appear attentive.
Exercises
1. Think about the last time you were involved in an 
interview (either as an interviewer or an interviewee). 
What types of questions were you asked? Do you feel 
the questions solicited useful answers?
2. If you were to interview a candidate for a technology-
related position, what types of questions would you ask?
3. What advantages do open-ended questions have? When 
might a question requiring a brief answer be appropriate?
2	 Create a Video Resume
Resumes are used to inform potential employers about 
your experience, education, qualifications, and other 
important information. When using job search services 
on the web, such as Monster, CareerBuilder, and Dice, 
you often will submit your resume ­electronically.
A video resume contains a video of you speaking to 
your potential employer, explaining your interest in 
the job and why you think you are the best qualified 
candidate. The following steps guide you through the 
process of creating a video resume.
Record the Video
When you record the video resume, you must be aware of 
several important elements:
a. Make sure you have access to a computer with a 
webcam. Alternatively, you can record the video 
with a more sophisticated camera.
b. Prepare your script. Before you start recording, write 
and memorize the words you will say in the video. 
The video should be no longer than one minute, 
so write your script accordingly. Remember — you 
are trying to impress your potential employer.
c. Set the stage. The lighting and image in the video 
are critical to making a professional-appearing 
video. You should use adequate light so that the 
video is clear. Generally, you should arrange the 
camera for a head-and-shoulders shot.
d. Practice. You must practice your presentation in 
front of the camera. You can record and play back 
your practice recordings until you feel confident 
about your presentation.
e. Dress for the part. When on camera, the impression 
you make will be influenced by your attire and your 
personal grooming. You should dress as if you were 
doing a live interview.
f. Record the video. Your video should be no longer 
than one minute, but you might want to divide it 
into segments. For example, you could separate 
your statement about why you want to work 
for a company from your statement about your 
educational background.
Capture the Video
After you have recorded the video on a video camera, 
attach the video camera to the computer or insert the 
memory card from the camera into the computer and 
then complete the following steps:
a. Run a program or app to capture the video.
b. Select the option to import a video from the location 
on which it was stored.
c. If necessary, navigate to the location of and select 
the video to import.
d. Specify a name to identify the imported video.
e. Start the import process. This process may take 
several minutes to complete.
f. When the import process is complete, display the 
contents from the camera and verify the video has 
imported correctly.
Edit the Video
After recording the video, you normally should edit it and 
save it in a format that can be placed in your resume. To 
dit the video, complete the following steps:
a. Import the video clip(s) that will comprise 
your video resume into a new project in 
the program or app you are using to create 
your video.
b. If you are working with multiple video clips, 
arrange them in the correct order.

How To: Your Turn 
 
c. View the video clips in the order you desire to 
make sure the transition from one video clip to the 
next is not obvious. If it is obvious, you either can 
use editing features in the program or app to make 
the transition less obvious, or you may need to 
record one or more video clips again.
d. Review the audio quality to make sure it is clear 
and that the volume is adequate. If necessary, use 
editing features in the program or app to reduce or 
eliminate background noise.
e. Avoid using special effects, such as sound effects, 
transitions, or other visual effects. The purpose of 
the video resume is to advertise you as a potential 
employee, so do not include anything that may 
distract from that.
f. After you have edited the video, play the video from 
beginning to end to make sure you are pleased with it.
g. Save, but do not close, the project.
h. Export the video to an appropriate format. Because 
you will be distributing this resume and possibly 
publishing it on the web, use a format that is 
of acceptable quality but does not generate an 
excessively large file. 
Share Your Resume
Now that you have edited your resume and exported 
it, you are ready to share your video resume with 
potential employers.
Saving in a Document
a. Open the document on your computer.
b. Use the commands in the word processing program 
to insert the video resume at the desired location.
c. Verify the video plays properly.
d. Save the document.
e. Open the document on another computer and 
make sure the video plays properly.
Saving on the Web
a. Connect to your web hosting company.
b. Upload the video to the folder that contains your 
website’s files.
c. Modify the webpage that you want to include the 
video resume. You either can update the webpage so 
that the video plays on the page itself, or so that the 
webpage visitor has to tap or click a link to open 
and play the video in a new window.
d. Save the changes to the webpage.
e. Run a browser, navigate to the webpage containing 
the video resume, and make sure the video resume 
plays as intended. You should test your video 
resume from multiple computers and devices using 
multiple browsers.
Exercises
1. What type of information would you include in your 
video resume?
2. Compare and contrast three programs or apps that can 
edit a video. Which one do you like the most? Why? 
Which one do you like the least? Why?
3	 Create an Online Survey
If you want to collect information from a group of 
people, one way is to use an online survey. Online sur-
veys can be sent to many individuals across the globe, 
allowing you to collect responses in a timely manner. 
Multiple web apps exist that allow you to create and 
distribute online surveys either for free or for a fee. 
Each web app has slightly different features, so evalu-
ate various options before deciding which one to use. 
The following steps guide you through the process of 
creating an online survey.
a. Navigate to the website you want to use to create 
the online survey.
b. If necessary, create an account on the website 
hosting the web app.
c. Select the option to create a new survey.
d. Enter a descriptive title for the survey.
e. Add the appropriate instructions to the survey.
f. Add the questions to your survey. This includes:
• Choosing the correct question type
• Entering a descriptive question
• If necessary, specifying the answer choices
• Selecting whether the question is required
• Specifying whether certain answers should 
prompt additional questions to appear
g. Save the survey.
h. Test the survey to make sure it functions as 
intended.
i. Distribute the survey to intended recipients.
j. When the due date for the survey passes, collect the 
survey results.
Exercises
1. What are at least three reasons you might need to 
distribute an online survey in your desired field?
2. Compare and contrast at least three online tools that 
can create and distribute surveys. Which one was your 
favorite? Why? Which one was your least favorite? 
Why? What are the differences between their free and 
fee-based accounts?

 Internet Research
1	 Making Use of the Web 
Careers and Employment
It is a good idea to acquire information before ­graduation 
about the industry in which you would like to work. 
While your teachers provide valuable training and 
knowledge to prepare you for a career, they rarely 
teach you how to begin a job search. You can broaden 
your horizon by searching online for career information 
and job openings.
Career websites provide details about training and 
education requirements, employment outlook, industry 
trends, and salary data. They also offer advice on writ-
ing a cover letter and resume, applying for jobs online, 
networking, and preparing for an interview. When you 
are offered a job, turn to these websites to obtain in-
dustry salary comparisons and negotiation techniques.
Job seekers can search employment websites, such as 
CareerBuilder, Dice, and Monster, for specific posi-
tion openings worldwide. The jobs can be sorted by 
category, industry, location, date posted, job title, and 
keywords. Some websites list job fairs and separate the 
listings by categories, such as entry level, part time, 
summer, and temporary.
Research This: (a) Visit at least two career ­websites 
and review the resources. What type of career advice 
is given? Are aptitude tests available? What tools 
are provided to manage a job search, such as tips 
for ­writing a cover letter and resume, job search 
mistakes to avoid, search strategies, and online 
­social network tips?
(b) Use at least two employment websites to search 
for three job openings in your field. Which ­positions 
are available? What are their salaries, locations, 
­required education and experience, and job descrip-
tions? Can job seekers post a resume? Are company 
profiles and salary comparison available? Do these 
websites have mobile apps?
2	 Social Media
Companies have created policies that employees 
must follow when participating in social media and 
online social networks. Intel, for example, considers 
participation in social media to be an opportunity, not 
a right, and requires its employees to disclose their 
identity, protect the company’s confidential and classi-
fied information, and use common sense when writing 
and airing opinions. Apple employees are urged to use 
good judgment when using online social networks and 
are barred from discussing the company on their own 
websites and from commenting on or posting mes-
sages regarding the company and its products on any 
related websites.
Research This: Locate at least two corporate ­policies 
for social media participation and summarize the 
­requirements. Do you agree with the companies’ 
guidelines? Are the policies too lenient or too strict? 
What actions are taken if an employee fails to abide by 
the policies? In what ways may policies differ among 
various fields, such as in health care and education?
3	 Search Skills 
Using the Web for Research
A search engine may provide targeted results from 
news websites, blogs, corporate websites, and other 
sources. In addition, research websites, digital libraries,

­professionals’ press releases, analysis, and case studies 
about ­companies, technologies, and industries. These 
­sources often present valuable background informa-
tion, and they offer IT professionals relevant business 
­information to guide their decision-making.
Academic search engines, such as Google Scholar, 
and digital libraries, such as JSTOR (Journal Storage), 
provide access to academic journals and conference 
publications that can be useful when doing academic 
research. Navigating to these websites from campus 
may give you additional access to online research 
­databases to which your library has a paid subscription.
Research This: Complete these tasks and report 
your findings. (1) Use your school library’s website to 
find articles in online newspapers about information 
­literacy. (2) Use a research database available from your 
school library’s website to find an article about the 
fastest-growing IT careers. (3) Use a research database 
available from your school library’s website to find an 
article about a company or technology discussed in 
this chapter. (4) Use Google Scholar or JSTOR to find 
a recent scholarly publication about rapid application 
development.
4	 Security
Microsoft, Apple, Facebook, and Twitter are among 
the technology companies that have experienced 
a series of attacks exploiting security flaws in the 
Java plug-in for browsers. These security intrusions 
appear to have originated from hackers in China, 
Russia, or Eastern Europe who were attempting to 
obtain the companies’ intellectual property, sensi-
tive data, and users’ personal information. The 
cyberthieves bypassed Java’s built-in protections and 
installed malware on the compromised computers. 
Kaspersky Security estimates that more than ­one-half 
of the security threats can originate from Java flaws. 
Oracle, the company that develops Java, issues 
patches to address known security vulnerabilities, but 
the Department of Homeland Security and other 
experts recommend not using Java until it is needed 
in ­browsers because new attacks may occur in the 
popular ­programming language.
Research This: Locate at least two articles discussing 
Java security flaws. How do Oracle and other com-
panies inform users about the need to obtain updates 
to fix security holes? How many devices worldwide 
have Java installed? How can users discover if Java is 
installed on their computer or mobile device and, if it 
is, learn how to uninstall it?
5	 Cloud Services 
Enterprise Software Apps
Many companies make use of enterprise software apps 
to manage customer relationship management (CRM) 
and Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP). The rise of 
cloud computing in the enterprise has resulted in these 
and other enterprise software apps being hosted and 
managed on the cloud, rather than being purchased 
and installed in house. Software as a service (SaaS), 
a service of cloud computing, provides the delivery 
of software applications that are stored and deployed 
from servers on the Internet.
Enterprise software applications are popular SaaS 
­offerings because IT departments do not need to ­install 
the software or manage the servers on which they run; 
instead, they can concentrate on configuring and speci-
fying the services that these apps provide. Their "pay 
as you go" model, where customers are charged only 
for the capabilities they use, make SaaS apps attractive 
from a financial perspective. Users always interact with 
the most up-to-date version, and because the apps are 
accessed in a browser, it is easy to maintain the app 
across large organizations.
Research This: (1) Read about Salesforce, a pioneer 
in cloud-based CRM applications. What services does 
Salesforce provide? Find a case study about Salesforce, 
and describe how Salesforce’s cloud solutions met 
one of its customer’s needs. (2) Read about enterprise 
SaaS offerings to manage business operations and 
customer relations. Select or compare cloud services 
from ­companies such as SAP, Microsoft, and Oracle, 
and prepare a summary of their offerings. What are 
advantages and disadvantages to companies running 
these apps on the cloud?

Chapter 12  Working in the Enterprise
Critical Thinking
1.	Offshoring and Outsourcing  
The consulting company where you work as a 
systems analyst has refused to use offshoring, claiming 
management prefers to employ homeland citizens. The 
company’s competitors have been using offshoring 
for some time. Your company’s management team 
wants to discuss outsourcing the company’s accounting 
system to an overseas firm.
Do This: Research laws, guidelines, and ­opinions 
­regarding outsourcing. Address the following 
­questions: Do you think systems should be developed 
­entirely overseas? Why or why not? What are the 
­major advantages and disadvantages of developing 
­systems offshore? What security issues exist when 
using offshore developments? Does the United States 
have an obligation to help with employment overseas 
or in developing nations? Why or why not? What 
factors should a company consider when determining 
whether to use offshore developers?
2.	Mobile App Development  
Your company creates digital quizzes and study guides 
for nursing students. Currently you deliver these 
quizzes and other materials through a subscription-
based website. Customers have been asking for an app 
that is optimized for smartphones and tablets. You 
have been asked to gather necessary information to 
start the project.
Do This: Determine which type of mobile app might 
be best suited to this type of product and explain why. 
Research other quiz and study guide apps. Read user 
­reviews to determine what features customers might 
find valuable. List common features of the most 
­highly-rated apps. What skills, hardware, and soft-
ware are necessary to develop this type of app? What 
resources might your company have to purchase or 
use to ­develop the app? Research mobile app develop-
ment jobs on an employment website to find examples 
of requirements for this type of job. What certifica-
tions might you look for when hiring a mobile app 
­developer?
3.	Case Study 
Amateur Sports League  You are the new manager 
for a nonprofit amateur soccer league. Several 
employees of the league have expressed interest in 
telecommuting a few days per week. You need to 
present a telecommuting proposal for the next meeting 
of the board of directors.
Do This: Research benefits and disadvantages 
of ­allowing telecommuting. List requirements for 
­employees to be able to work from home, including 
types of ­Internet ­access and hardware. Discuss secu-
rity ­issues with allowing employees to telecommute. 
How can you address security concerns? List guide-
lines employees should ­follow when working from 
home. Should you implement a method for evaluating 
employee efficiency or productivity when telecommut-
ing? Why or why not? How would you assess ­individual 
employee performance? What jobs are better suited to 
telecommuting? Why? Would you recommend that the 
league allow telecommuting? Why or why not?
The Critical Thinking exercises challenge your assessment and decision-making skills by 
­presenting real-world situations associated with chapter concepts. The Collaboration 
­exercise should be completed with a team.
Instructions: Evaluate the situations below, using personal experiences and one or more resources available to you (such as articles on the web or in 
print, blogs, podcasts, videos, television, user guides, other individuals, electronics or computer stores, etc.). Perform the tasks requested in each exercise 
and share your deliverables in the format requested by your instructor (brief report, presentation, discussion, blog post, video, or other means).
4.	Job Search  You work in the human resources department of a network security company. 
You currently have several openings for positions, including a network administrator, a security 
expert, and a help desk technician.
Do This: Form a three-member team and have each team member choose a different ­position. 
As a team, discuss any common requirements or background necessary for all of the positions 
based on the type of company. Each team member should list the educational background, 
available certifications, and other requirements for the position. Find listings for available jobs 
in your area. What responsibilities are listed for the position? What salary ­information can 
you locate? Create a list of information potential employees should have as part of their online 
profile. As a team, meet to discuss and compile your findings.

Tools for Creating a Website
As discussed in Chapter 2, a website is a collection of related webpages and associated 
items that usually are hosted on the same web server. A web developer often creates 
simple websites by designing its layout, creating the content for each page, and 
typing the HTML codes, called tags, for each page using a text editor.  When 
creating  complex websites with hundreds or thousands of pages, web developers rely 
on content management systems to specify the design and content of each page.

Text Editors
A text editor is similar to a word processing program, but it lacks most text 
formatting features, such as fonts, colors, margins, and paragraphs, and it saves files 
in a text format. A browser interprets the text file and displays the content using the 
formatting codes specified in the file.
Operating systems typically include a text editor. For example, Windows users 
may use Notepad, and MacOS users may use TextEdit as their text editors. Most text 
editors save files in a text format automatically. Others may require additional steps to 
save documents in a text format.
A code editor is a type of text editor that has additional features to help web 
developers write the code used to develop websites and applications accurately and 
efficiently. For example, some code editors can display HTML code in different colors 
(tags might be displayed in one color, while document content is displayed in another 
color). In addition, code editors might improve readability of your code by applying 
appropriate indenting and line spacing or automatically completing HTML tags or 
styles as you type them. Many web developers opt to download a free or fee-based 
code editor with these features.
Many of the figures in this Focus On show HTML code as it appears in 
Brackets, a modern, open source editor built for web developers. Brackets is available 
for computers running both Windows and MacOS. You can download Brackets or 
another editor to install on your computer. Figure 1 shows several text and code 
editors.

Content Management Systems
Creators of complex websites with hundreds or thousands of frequently updated 
pages, such as those of a university or online business, often make use of a content 
management system (CMS) to enter, modify, or delete content. A CMS enables and 
manages the publishing, modification, organization, and access of various forms of 
documents and other files, including media and webpages, on a network or the web. 
A CMS allows web developers to specify the parts of a page that are common to a 
website (such as a banner graphic, navigation menu, or footer information that appear 
on every page) so that they need to be specified only once. Many CMSs allow web 
developers to customize their websites by including plug-ins, which provide additional 
capabilities, such as displaying a slide show of images or navigation menus.
When using a CMS, a web developer creates the theme, or design of a website, 
and one or more website content administrators enters its content. The CMS uses 
a database to store both the design and content of the website. The CMS will query 
the database, assemble the different parts of the page as HTML code, and then send 
the HTML to the user’s browser for display. Many CMSs provide a variety of themes 
from which to choose when creating a website. Often, a web developer can customize 
a theme by specifying colors, banner graphics, placement of navigation menus, and 
other characteristics. By applying different themes, developers easily can alter the 
appearance of a website without modifying its content. For example, one theme may 
be optimized for displaying on a large screen, while another theme might display only 
images and text, so the website displays quickly on mobile devices. Figure 2 shows 
options for selecting a theme or configuring the appearance of a website created with 
the WordPress CMS.
If you are using a Mac, do you have to do anything special to use TextEdit to create webpages?
Yes. Depending on the version of TextEdit you are using, you may need to set preferences in TextEdit to save your webpage files 
in a text format. Ask your instructor, or consider using a search engine to locate websites that provide the instructions necessary 
for your computer. Consider using search text that includes words such as textedit, edit, and html.
CONSIDER THIS
Where can you find out more about text editors and code editors that run on your computer?
Use a search engine to locate websites that provide this information. Consider using the words, text editor web design,  
followed by the name of your operating system, such as Windows or MacOS, as your search text. If you are looking for only 
free text editors, consider adding the word, free, to your search text. If you need assistance selecting, downloading, and  
installing an editor, contact your instructor.

Website Technologies
Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) uses a set of codes called tags to format 
documents for display in a browser. The current version of HTML is HTML5. 
HTML tags describe the structure of the content on a webpage, including headings, 
paragraphs, images, and links.These tags generally occur in pairs in an HTML 
document, one before a content item and another after it.
A complementary technology called cascading style sheets (CSS) contains 
specifications for the fonts, colors, layout, and placement of these HTML elements on 
a webpage. The current version of CSS is CSS3.
JavaScript is a programming language for creating programs that a browser 
can run to generate content for a website. Uses for JavaScript include obtaining the 
current date and time, formatting alert boxes, performing calculations, and dynamically 
displaying this content on a webpage.

Because screens on computers and mobile devices are of different sizes, many 
web developers will create webpages that are responsive. Responsive webpages 
automatically adjust the size of their content to display appropriately relative to the 
size of the screen of the device on which it is displayed. Figure 4 shows a webpage 
displayed in a browser on full-size screen and the same webpage when viewed in a 
browser on a mobile device.

Structure of a Webpage
A webpage’s source code contains text marked up with HTML tags that instruct a 
browser how to display that content. HTML tags are written in lowercase characters 
and are enclosed within angle brackets (< >). Almost all HTML tags are written in 
pairs, with an opening tag and a closing tag. An opening tag contains the tag name 
followed by any attributes or additional information needed to completely specify the 
tag. A closing tag begins with a forward slash (/) followed by the tag name. Figure 5 
shows the structure of a webpage coded in HTML.
Figure 5 Structure of a webpage.
• As shown in Figure 5, the first line of code in an HTML5 webpage contains the 
line,   <!DOCTYPE html>.   These words identify that the document type of this 
page is HTML5. When viewing the source code for a webpage, if you see different 
values after the word DOCTYPE, or no DOCTYPE line at all, the webpage 
probably was written to conform to standards of an earlier version of HTML.
• The next line of code in a webpage file is always an   <html>   tag to indicate 
that the content is written using HTML. This is the opening   <html>   tag.  The 
file ends with the corresponding closing   </html>   tag.
• The head section, located between the   <head>   and   </head>   tags, includes 
tags for the title of the webpage that appears in the browser tab displaying this 
webpage; it also may include styles and JavaScript. The body section, located 
between the   <body>   and   </body>   tags, contains the content of the 
webpage marked up with HTML tags.
• Sometimes a web developer will indent tags when typing them in a text editor so 
that opening tags and their corresponding closing tags line up, in order to make 
the HTML code easier for a human to read.
• The content of a webpage is placed between the   <body>   and   </body>   
tags. In Figure 5, this area is marked with comments to indicate where the page 
content begins and ends. Comments look similar to HTML tags, except that they 
have an exclamation point and two dashes (!--) after the opening bracket and 
two dashes before the closing bracket. The dashes are not required, but they help 
improve readability. Web developers often include comments to make it easier to 
read and interpret the HTML code.

A browser ignores the spacing of the HTML code and any comments included 
in the file and renders, or displays, a webpage’s content based on the meaning of the 
tags used to mark it up.
The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) oversees the specification of HTML 
standards, and as HTML evolves, the W3C identifies some tags as deprecated, or 
obsolete. For example, in earlier versions of HTML the   <font>   tag was used to 
specify the font of text on a webpage. With the development of CSS, the W3C has 
deprecated the   <font>   tag. While the   <font>   tag still may display text in 
a particular font correctly in some browsers, the preferred way to display text in a 
specific font is using CSS.
The W3C provides a free, online HTML5 validator application to ensure that a 
webpage’s HTML tags follow the specifications, or rules, for HTML5. The HTML5 
validator will identify any misaligned tags, deprecated tags, required attributes, or 
information that may be missing, as shown in Figure 6.
How can you find and use an HTML5 validator?
Use a search engine with the search text, W3C HTML validator, to locate the W3C Markup Validator Service. Navigate to  
the W3C Markup Validation Service website, and specify the web address of a webpage, upload an HTML file, or paste in 
the HTML code to be validated. Review the output to determine any code that needs to be corrected for the page to pass  
inspection. Using a validator will ensure that the code complies with HTML5 standards and that the page displays correctly  
in all HTML5-compliant browsers.

Developing a Website
This section will guide you through the steps of creating a simple website. You will 
need to select, download, and install a text editor, or use Notepad for Windows or 
TextEdit for MacOS. The website you will create in this Focus On will include various 
headings, paragraphs of text, links, styles, images, an embedded video, and the current 
time and date (Figure 7).

To Create the index.html File
To perform the steps in this Focus On, you will need to download to the starter files for this Focus On 
from the online companion website for this book. If you need assistance accessing these files, contact your 
instructor. Download and uncompress these files. Create a folder named website on your computer that will 
contain all of the files and images used in your website. Move the template.html, startertext.txt files, and the 
images folder to the website folder.
The template.html data file includes the webpage structure. You will open this file in a text editor and save 
it as index.html. The index.html file usually is the first file to be displayed when you navigate to a website. Why? 
The .html file extension indicates to the browser that the file stores the content for a webpage, so that it can open the file and 
display its contents. The webpage structure helps the browser identify the file as a webpage so that it can display it properly. 
The following steps open the template.html file in a text editor and save it with the file name, index.html.
1
• Run the text editor 
of your choice.
• Navigate to and open 
the template.html 
file.
• If necessary, enable 
the word wrap 
feature so that 
you can view all 
the webpage text 
without scrolling 
horizontally  
(Figure 8).
Can I just navigate 
to the template.html 
file and double-click 
it so that it opens in 
a text editor? 
By default, most 
operating systems 
are configured to 
open files with  
an .html extension in 
a browser. If you double-click the .html file icon in a file explorer application, it is likely that the template.html file 
will open in your default browser instead of a text editor. 
2
• Save the file using the file name, index.html. Do not exit the text editor. If you are running Notepad on a Windows 
computer, change the file type in the Save As dialog box in Notepad to All Files so that Notepad saves the file with 
the proper .html extension.
Q&A
Are all webpages coded in HTML?
Yes. Many simple websites make use of static webpages, whose content changes only when a web developer updates the 
HTML code for each page. More complex websites often have dynamic webpages. Dynamic webpages obtain their content by 
running programs on a web server or in a browser. These programs often perform calculations or interact with a database to 
access requested information and then generate the HTML code to display that content in a browser.

To Copy the Starter Text from a Source File and Paste It in the index.html File
The startertext.txt file data file includes all the text the webpage will display. Why? For the purposes of this 
exercise, copying and pasting text from an existing file will save you from having to type all the webpage text manually. 
The following steps copy the starter text from  the startertext.txt file and paste it in the   <body>   section of the 
index.html file so that it appears in the browser’s display area.

• Select all the text in the 
startertext.txt file.
• Copy the text.
• Close the startertext.txt file.
• Display the text editor window

• Position the insertion point on 
blank line after the line that says, 
<!—Page content begins here -->

is a comment; its only purpose 
is to make it easier for a web

To Add the Webpage Title
As mentioned previously, the webpage title helps identify the webpage. For example, if you have multiple 
webpages open in the browser, each webpage’s title will appear in its respective browser tab. If you save a 
webpage as a bookmark or favorite, by default, the browser will identify the webpage by its title. You always 
should assign a meaningful title to each webpage you create. Why? A descriptive webpage title can help you identify 
a webpage without having to view its contents and also will help search engines locate the page. The following steps add a 
meaningful title to the index.html webpage.

• Select the text, 
Page Title, that 
appears between 
the   <title>   and

Headings
Headings indicate the different sections of a webpage. HTML supports six 
levels of headings, which are identified by the following tags:  <h1>, <h2>, <h3>, 
<h4>, <h5>, and <h6>. The   <h1>   tag displays text in the largest font size for 
headings, and the   <h6>   tag displays text in the smallest font size for headings 
(Figure 14).
To Identify the Headings in the index.html File
The index.html file in this example will contain four headings: a heading at the top that identifies the 
webpage, as well as three additional headings that identify each of the three sections. Why? Using webpage 
headings helps visitors identify the content they would like to read. The following steps identify the headings in the

• When you are finished viewing the webpage in the browser, minimize the browser window 
and redisplay the text editor containing the index.html file.
Paragraphs
The   <p>   and   </p>   tags are used to identify the beginning and ending of 
paragraphs. If you have several paragraphs of text on your webpage, these tags will inform 
the browser to insert additional line spacing above and below the paragraph so that the 
text is easier to read when displayed in the browser. The browser ignores line breaks and 
line spacing in the HTML file, so it is important to properly define the paragraphs using 
the   <p>   and   </p>   tags. For example, even if the HTML file appears to have five 
distinct paragraphs, each separated by a blank line, the browser will ignore the blank lines 
and display everything as one, long paragraph. To display the text correctly in a browser, 
place   <p>   and   </p>   tags around each paragraph. Each   <p>   tag must have a 
corresponding   </p>   tag so that the code is HTML5-compliant.
The index.html file in this example has eight paragraphs: three below the webpage 
title, two below the HTML5 heading, two below the CSS heading, and one below the 
JavaScript heading.

I keep attempting to refresh, but my page does not change. What can I do?
Some browsers keep the content of previously loaded pages in local storage so that they will load faster when 
a user returns to them. Try pressing the ctrl key on the keyboard while reloading the page in order to clear any 
pages previously stored by the browser. 
Q&A
Images
Most webpages contain one or more images that add visual appeal. Images can 
be either photos or graphics. Some websites include a banner, or graphic that identifies 
the website, at the top of each page so that they are easily recognizable. While images 
can make a website more attractive, or help to deliver its message, remember that not 
all viewers may be able to see these images. For example, someone who is visually 
impaired or someone who has configured his or her browser so that it does not display 
images may be unable to view the images. For this reason, it is not advisable to use 
images as the only method of conveying information to website visitors.
Images always are stored as separate files, and references to the images appear 
in the HTML code using the   <img>   tag. When identifying an image to include 
on a webpage, choose one that has appropriate dimensions for the webpage and has 
a relatively small file size. Images load at the same time the webpage loads in the 
browser, so having images with large file sizes, or too many images, can increase the 
time it takes for the webpage to load. For this reason, you should use images sparingly. 
In addition, choose images in the JPEG, GIF, or PNG format (identified with a .jpg, 
.gif, or .png file extension), as they are the formats supported by most browsers.
The Web Development webpage you are creating in this example will contain 
three images: one under the HTML5 heading, one under the CSS heading, and one 
under the JavaScript heading. When adding the HTML code for these images, you 
will specify attributes for each   <img>   tag to provide additional information needed 
for the browser to display the image. Attributes are coded within an HTML tag. Many 
HTML tags have attributes associated with them. See Table 2 at the end of this Focus 
On for a summary of common tags and their attributes.
Common attributes for the   <img>   tag describe the location of an image 
file, alternate text for the image, and a style that indicates how to position the image. 
For example, the src attribute of the   <img>   tag specifies the source location of the 
image, the alt attribute specifies alternate text, or alt text, associated with an image, and 
the   style   attribute provides information regarding the placement or display of an 
image.
This example stores its images in a folder named images in the website folder. 
The   src   attribute refers to the images folder when specifying the location of an 
image to display.
BTW
If you are trying to display 
photos from a digital camera 
or smartphone camera on your 
website, you should use image 
editing software to shrink the 
photos to an appropriate size, 
such as 300 × 400 pixels or 
600 × 800 pixels. The size, or 
resolution, of a photo taken 
with an 8 megapixel camera 
can be approixmately 2447 ×  
3264 pixels, which is larger 
than the resolution of the 
screens on many devices or 
monitors.
<img src="images/html5_logo.png" alt="HTML5 Logo" style="float:left">
Is it required to specify text for the alt attribute?
The alt attribute is a required part of the   <img>   tag in HTML5. Many browsers display the alternate text in place of an  
image when they are not set to load images automatically or the file containing the image is not found. Alternate text also 
helps visually impaired users, who use screen reading software to navigate a website, identify the purpose of an image. Most 
screen reading apps will read aloud the alternate text for each image.

FO 18   Focus On: Web Development
To Insert Images in the index.html File
As shown in Figure 18, this example stores images used in this website in a folder named images, located in 
the same folder as the index.html file. It is a good practice to store images used in a website in a folder separate 
from the HTML pages of a website so that they can be located easily.  The following steps insert three images, 
which are located in the images folder, in the index.html file. Why? You will insert these images to add visual appeal 
to the webpage.
How does the float:left style display?
The   float:left   style displays the image at the upper-left corner of a block of text and displays the text around the image.
CONSIDER THIS
Where is the closing tag to correspond with   <img>?
Some tags do not have a corresponding closing tag. When no additional information is required between an opening tag and 
its closing tag, HTML5 omits the closing tag. In this case, the image is specified entirely by its attributes, so HTML5 does not 
specify a tag to close the   <img>   tag. HTML5 tags that do not require a closing tag are sometimes called one-sided tags. 
Other one-sided tags include   <br>   (line break) and   <hr>   (horizontal rule).

FO 20   Focus On: Web Development
Links
A link, or hyperlink, can be text or an image in a webpage that a user clicks 
to navigate to another webpage, download a file, or perform another action, such as 
running an email app and addressing an email message. If you want webpage visitors to 
be able to access other webpages in the website easily, you should include links to those 
pages. In addition to providing links to other pages in the website, you also can provide 
links to other websites. Webpages always are stored as separate files, and hypertext 
references to the files appear in the HTML code using the   <a>   (anchor) tag. The   
<a>   tag’s   href   (hypertext reference) attribute often refers to the location of the file 
or webpage that you want to view or download.
The   href   attribute’s value references a link’s location using either a relative 
reference or an absolute reference. Relative references identify the location of 
webpages and files on the current website. Absolute references are used to identify the 
location of webpages or files stored on other websites.
An absolute reference includes the full path, including the protocol and domain 
name containing the webpage, image, or file you are attempting to access (for example, 
the code,   <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a>,   is a hyperlink 
to the Google website). If the http:// protocol is missing from an absolute reference, 
the desired webpage, image, or file may not load. (This also is known as a broken link.) 
While an absolute reference must include http://, some browsers may not display the 
http:// prefix in the address bar when navigating to a webpage.
When creating a link, the   target   attribute of the   <a>   tag specifies the tab 
or window in which the resulting webpage, image, or file will open. Use the attribute   
target="_blank"   to open the linked document in a new window or tab. If you exclude 
the target attribute, the link’s destination will open in the same browser tab or window. It 
is a good idea to open links to other websites in a new browser tab or window so that the 
visitor easily can return to the webpage by redisplaying the original tab or window.
You also can use absolute and relative references in an   <img>   tag to specify 
the location from where a browser should access an image to display on a website. In 
the HTML code,   <img src="images/html5_image.png" alt="HTML  
Image">,   from the previous step, the   src   attribute references a file named html5_
image.png file located in the images folder, and the images folder is located in the same 
folder as the current file (index.html, in this case). This is a relative reference, as the 
location is given relative to the location of the file requesting the resource.
To display an image stored on another website, specify an absolute reference, 
including the http:// protocol, as part of the  src  attribute. For example, if you add the code,   
<img src="http://dscov.com/quiz/correct.png" alt="Correct">,   to a 
webpage, it would display an image of a checkmark (indicating a correct answer) stored on 
the web server hosting the website at dscov.com. The image is not located in your website’s 
images folder because it will be accessed from the website specified in the absolute reference.
The index.html page in this example will contain four links: three links to websites 
about HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript, for which you will use absolute references, and one 
link to another webpage you will be creating as part of this website, for which you will 
use a relative reference.
BTW
Images
Be cautious when you include 
images or other content from 
another website on your own 
website, as it is possible that 
such content always may not 
be displayed correctly. If the 
owner of the other website 
modifies the location or 
removes the content entirely, 
the image will not appear, or 
a broken link will result on 
your website.

To Insert a Link with an Absolute Reference
The following steps add links with absolute references to three different locations. Why? Links with 
absolute references are required in this case because the webpages to which you are linking are not on the same website or 
web server as the index.html file.
1
• In the second paragraph beginning, HTML5 specifies the structure, position the insertion point immediately before 
the H in HTML5.
• Type   <a href="http://www.w3.org/html/logo" target="_blank">   to specify the link destination 
and that the resulting webpage should open in a new, blank window.
• Position the insertion point after HTML5 and then type   </a>   to indicate the end of the link (Figure 25).
2
• In the same paragraph, position the insertion point immediately before CSS and type   <a href="http://www.
w3.org/Style/Examples/011/firstcss" target="_blank">   to specify the link destination and that 
the resulting webpage should open in a new, blank window.
• Position the insertion point after CSS and then type   </a>   to indicate the end of the link.
• Save the changes to the index.html file.
• Refresh or reload the webpage in the browser window to verify the changes are displayed properly.
• In the same paragraph, position the insertion point immediately before JavaScript and type   <a href="http://
javascript.com" target="_blank">   to specify the link destination and that the resulting webpage 
should open in a new, blank window.
• Position the insertion point after JavaScript and then type   </a>   to indicate the end of the link (Figure 26).
• Save the changes to the index.html file.
• Refresh or reload the webpage in the browser window to verify the changes are displayed properly.

Webpage names should 
contain letters, numbers, and 
underscores. Avoid using 
special characters and spaces 
in webpage names. Although 
not required, it is good 
practice to use filenames with 
all lowercase letters.
To Insert a Link with a Relative Reference
The link with a relative reference to the Video webpage on the Web Development website will navigate to 
the video.html webpage you created in the previous set of steps. Why? Because the webpage to which you are linking 
is located in the same folder as the file from which you are linking, it will be easier to create a link with a relative reference 
so that you do not have to indicate the entire path of the file. The following step inserts a link with a relative reference 
that points to the video.html file.
Figure 27
1
• Display the index.html file.
• Position the insertion point immediately before the W in the paragraph beginning, Watch a video.
• Type   <a href="video.html">   to indicate the beginning of the link that will point to video.html, 
which is in the same folder as index.html.
• Position the insertion point after the word, video, in the same sentence and then type   </a>   to 
indicate the end of the link (Figure 27).
• Save the changes to the index.html file.
• Refresh or reload the webpage in the browser window to verify the changes are displayed properly.
How can I add an image so that a user can click it, instead of text, to navigate to another webpage?
Create the link, but include the HTML for the image tag between the   <a>   and   </a>   tags.  
For example:
<a href="video.html"><img src="images/video.png" alt="video icon"></a>
will display a video icon for the user to click to navigate to the video.html page. Be sure the video icon 
(video.png) is located in the website’s images folder.

Unordered and Ordered Lists
Two types of lists that HTML supports are unordered and ordered. Unordered lists display 
a collection of items in a list format, with each list item identified by default with a bullet. Ordered 
lists, by default, identify each list item with a number (Figure 28).
To Add an Ordered List
The following steps convert the text in the first paragraph in the Web Development webpage to an 
ordered list. The list will contain three list items, each identified by a number. Why? An ordered list will display the 
information in this paragraph with greater visual appeal than a long, multi-line paragraph.
1
• The items in this ordered list will include the three links for HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. To change the first 
paragraph into an ordered list, change the first   <p>   to   <ol>   and the corresponding    
</p>   to   </ol>.
• Position the insertion point before the   <a>   tag for the HTML5 link, press the enter key, press the spacebar two 
times to create an indent, and then type   <li>   to indicate the beginning of a list item, and then press the enter 
key.
• Position the insertion point immediately after the semicolon in the HTML5 sentence, press the enter key, press the 
spacebar until the insertion point lines up with the opening   <li>   tag, and then type   </li>   to indicate the 
end of the first list item. Adjust the line spacing and indentation as necessary to match Figure 29.
• Press the enter key so that the next list item will begin on a new line in the file (Figure 29).

Is the spacing and indentation important?
As stated previously, browsers ignore extra blank spaces and line spaces when rendering HTML 
content. The spacing and indentation you are creating in the index.html file only improves the file’s 
readability for anyone reviewing the HTML. Some text editors automatically will align or indent these 
tags for you.
Q&A
Figure 30
Applying Styles with CSS
While a main advantage of HTML is its capability to define webpage structure, 
it is not as easy to apply style elements such as fonts, font sizes, font styles, and colors. 
Although it is possible to customize these elements of webpages using HTML, CSS 
makes it easier to specify the appearance of similar elements in the same webpage or 
same website. For example, in a previous section you used the   <h1>   and   <h2>   
tags to create four headings on the Web Development webpage. You can use CSS to 
specify the font, background color, and font color for all headings identified by the   
<h2>   tag in the index.html webpage.
When you inserted the images previously in this Focus On, you used the   
style   attribute of the   <img>   tag to indicate that you wanted the images to appear 
either to the left of the text or to the right of the text. (Recall that the HTML5 and 
JavaScript images appear to the left of the text in their respective sections, and the CSS 
image appears to the right of the text in the CSS section.) The styles you indicated in 
the   <img>   tags are called inline styles. Inline styles are identified by the   style   
attribute in an HTML tag, and these styles apply only to the specific tag in which they 
are defined.
Embedded styles, which define styles in the   <head>   section of the index.html 
document, apply to the entire webpage on which they are defined. In this section, you 
will define styles for several tags in the index.html file. Figure 31 shows the styles you 
will define.

CONSIDER THIS
Where can you find more information about CSS styles and their values?
You can use a search engine to locate websites that provide complete documentation about CSS, such as w3schools.com.  
Consider including words such as w3schools, css, and reference in your search text.
CONSIDER THIS
How can you specify colors to use for backgrounds or text in an HTML file?
Most browsers recognize common color names, such as red, orange, green, and blue, along with other predefined color names, 
such as navy, lime green, and papaya whip. To find a list of all available color names for use on the web, type the words, web 
color names, as search text in a search engine.
You can use the   rgb()   function to specify colors by providing their red, green, and blue components as decimal values 
between 0 and 255, or you can use hexadecimal (base 16) values between 00 and FF. A value of 0 means the absence of a 
color; 255, or FF in hexadecimal, means complete fullness of a color. For example, black is specified by   rgb(0,0,0)   or the 
hexadecimal value   #000000,   red is rgb(255,0,0)   or the hexadecimal value   #FF0000,   a shade of gray is indi-
cated by the value   rgb(200,200,200)   or the hexadecimal value   #C8C8C8,   and white is represented by the value   
rgb(255,255,255)   or the hexadecimal value   #FFFFFF.
CONSIDER THIS
Is it possible to use the same styles on all of the webpages of a website?
Yes. When creating websites with several webpages, web developers often place CSS declarations in a separate text file, called 
an external style sheet, so that each webpage of the website can access the same style information. External styles typically are 
used on large websites where web developers want a consistent style on each webpage. You can find more information about 
external style sheets by using a search engine with the search text, create external style sheet CSS.

To Add CSS to the index.html File
You have added all text and images to the index.html webpage and are ready to begin formatting the page 
using CSS. Why? Formatting a webpage with CSS makes it more attractive and is likely to capture website visitors’ 
attention for a longer period of time. The following step adds embedded styles to the index.html webpage.
1
• Position the 
insertion point  
at the end of the   
</title>   tag  
and then press  
the enter key.
• Type the text in 
Figure 31. Make sure 
you pay attention 
to the spacing and 
indentation to 
maximize readability 
(Figure 32).
• Save the changes to 
the webpage.
• Refresh or reload 
the webpage in the 
browser window to 
verify the changes are 
displayed properly.
To Add the fancy Style to the index.html File
In the previous set of steps, you specified a custom style, called fancy, which combines several styles to 
apply at the same time. When you specify a custom style name, you also must specify where in the webpage you 
want to apply this style. Why? Using a custom style name allows you to specify exactly where you want to use the style 
in the webpage. The style is not applied automatically to specific tags, as was the case with the   <h1>, <h2>, <p>, <ol>,   
and   <body>   tags in the previous set of steps. The following steps use the   <span>   tag with the class attribute to 
specify two different phrases on the page where the fancy style is to be applied.
1
• Position the insertion 
point immediately 
before the word, 
current, in the first 
paragraph below  
the HTML5 heading.
• Type   <span 
class="fancy">   
to indicate where you 
want to begin applying 
the fancy style.
• Position the insertion point immediately after the word, HTML, in the same sentence.
• Type   </span>   to indicate where you want to stop applying the fancy style (Figure 33).

JavaScript
JavaScript is code that can be added to HTML documents to enhance the 
webpage by adding interactivity or dynamic content. JavaScript can perform simple 
actions, such as retrieving and displaying the current date and time, to more complex 
actions, such as performing calculations. In many cases, the JavaScript code appears 
between opening and closing   <script>   tags in the   <head>   section of an HTML 
document. In the   <body>   section, you simply reference the JavaScript code where 
you want the resulting content to display.
To Use JavaScript to Add the Current Date and Time
Adding the current date and time to the index.html file requires you to add code in two sections of the webpage. 
The following steps type the code to retrieve the current date in the   <head>   section of the index.html file, and the 
code to display the retrieved date and time will be located in the   <body>   section (Figure 35). Why? Displaying the 
current date and time on a webpage indicates to visitors that the version of the webpage they are viewing is current.
<script>
function showDateAndTime() {
document.getElementById("current_date").innerHTML= Date();
}
</script>

Adding a YouTube Video to a Webpage
YouTube, a popular website with more than one billion users, contains videos about 
almost any topic imaginable. In addition to watching a YouTube video in a browser or 
using the YouTube app on a mobile device, you also can embed YouTube videos directly on 
a webpage. When you locate a video on that you want to include on a webpage, YouTube 
provides HTML code you can use to add the video to the webpage (Figure 38). This 
section adds a video about Web Development to the video.html file.
Figure 38
To Embed a YouTube Video in the video.html Webpage
The following steps locate a video on YouTube and embed the video in the video.html webpage. Why? 
Embedding a video can add appeal to a webpage by presenting content in a format other than text and images.
1
• Open a new browser tab and navigate to youtube.com.
• Use the search box on the youtube.com webpage to locate a video about web development.
• Locate the embed code. Hint: click the Share link and then click the Embed link.
• Select the embed code in its entirety and then copy it to the clipboard.

To Add a Link Back to the index.html Webpage
	 Earlier in this Focus On, you created a link from the index.html file to the 
video.html file. You now will provide a link that will navigate users back to the index.
html file from the video.html file. The following steps add a link to the index.html file.
	1	
Position the insertion point on the blank line after the code pasted in from YouTube, 
immediately above the   </html>   tag, and then press the enter key.
	2	
Type   <br>   to add a line break after the code to display the video.
	3	
Press the enter key two times and then type   <a href="index.html">Home</a>   
to add a link back to the website’s home page referenced in index.html (Figure 40).
CONSIDER THIS
What other online content can you embed on a website?
In addition to embedding videos on a website, you also may include media content, such as online calendars and documents, 
social media posts, images or slideshows from photo sharing websites, and maps positioned at preset locations. To include this 
content on a website, look for a link labeled Share or Embed or an icon displaying HTML brackets (< >) on the website con-
taining the content. Click this link or icon, copy the embed code displayed in the browser, and paste it at the desired location  
in the HTML file.
Figure 40
To Add a Background Style to the video.html Webpage
When choosing a background image for a webpage, be sure to choose one that does not detract from 
the webpage content. Background images create a pattern behind a webpage’s content. By default, most 
browsers repeat the background image both horizontally and vertically in the content area to form a tiled 
pattern.  The following step adds an embedded style that will display a background image on the video.html 
webpage (Figure 41). Why? A background image is another way to add visual appeal to a webpage. A webpage with a 
plain white or colored background might be less attractive than a webpage with a texture or pattern in the background.

To Exit the Text Editor and Preview the Webpages
When you have finished creating the webpages, the next step is to preview them in a browser before 
publishing them online. Why? It is important to thoroughly preview the webpages you create to make sure all links work, 
all images are displayed, and the overall webpage is displayed as you intend. The following steps exit the text editor and 
then load the webpages in the browser for you to preview.
1
• Close the video.html file in the text editor. If necessary, save the changes to the file.
• Close the index.html file in the text editor. If necessary, save the changes to the file.

To Publish a Website Online
When you have finished testing the pages in your website, you are ready to publish them so that anyone can 
access them on a device connected to the Internet. Why? Websites published on a web server are accessible online for all to see.
To transfer the files from your local computer to a remote web server, you will need to connect to the remote 
web server using the File Transfer Protocol (FTP). FTP specifies rules for transferring files from one computer to 
another on the Internet. While it is possible to enter FTP text commands in a command window to specify how to 
transfer files to and from a server, most users opt to download a free FTP application such as FileZilla or CuteFTP, 
which has a graphical user interface, to simplify the process.
You also will need an account on a web server in order to publish a website. If your school provides you 
with space to host a website, ask your instructor for the settings to connect to your account on the school’s web 
server. In general, you will need to know the host or web server name, your user name, and password to publish 
the files, and the web address of the website’s home page to view it online. You should publish only those files 
related to your website assignment on your school’s web server.
The following steps connect to a remote web server using an FTP application.
1
• Type the host name (the name of the web server) and the user name and password for the account, or set up a 
profile containing this information using an FTP application.
• Click the connect button to connect to the server (Figure 45).

How do I know if my files transferred correctly? 
Check the time and date and the size of the files on the server. The sizes should match the  
sizes of the files in your website folder. A file’s time and date shows the time and date that the  
web server received the file.
Q&A
To View a Website Online
When you have finished transferring the files from a website to a web server, you can view the website on 
any device connected to the Internet. You can type the web address of a specific webpage on a website to view 
it. Why? Uploading webpages to a web server allows anyone connected to the Internet to view them by entering their web 
address. You should view the website online to make sure it is displayed as you intend. The following step displays the 
published website in a browser.
Where can I find an FTP program?
Use a search engine with the search text, free ftp program. If you wish to find a program specific to your computer’s operating 
system, include the name of the operating system in the search text.

• Open a new browser or browser tab.
• In the address bar, type the absolute address of the website hosted on a web server. (This begins with http:// and 
includes the name of the server hosting the site.) The website will appear (Figure 47).
Do I need to type index.html in the web address to view my website’s home page in a browser?
No. You often can omit index.html when entering a web address in a browser. Because index.html often is the 
name of the first, or home, page that many websites display, a web server will look for a page with that name by 
default if no page name is specified in the request to locate a webpage.
What if I need or want to make changes to a website once it is published online?
Type the changes you want to make in the text editor, verify them locally in a browser, and then upload the 
changed files to the web server using an FTP program. Refresh or revisit the webpages in a browser to verify the 
changes were uploaded correctly.

Summary of Tags and Styles
This section summarizes tags and styles presented in this Focus On, as well as 
additional tags and styles often used when authoring webpages.
HTML5 Tags
Table 2 lists several HTML5 tags and notes about their usage. When a tag takes  
an attribute, the format is each attribute name followed by an equal sign (=), followed 
by its value in quotation marks, as in   <a href="http://www.google.com" 
target="_blank">Google</a>. Use a search engine with the search text, basic 
HTML tags, to locate complete documentation online. You can add a   style   
attribute to many of these tags.

Styles may appear in the   <style>   section or as part of a   style   attribute in 
almost all HTML tags, or in an external style sheet. The format for a style declaration 
is the style name, followed by a colon, followed by the value for the style. If more than 
one style is used, separate each style with a semicolon. Use a search engine with the 
search text, css styles reference, to locate complete documentation online.
