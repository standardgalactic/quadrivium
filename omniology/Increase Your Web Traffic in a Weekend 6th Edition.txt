Introduction
These days, everyone seems to have a home page or a Web site. However,
just because you create and publish a Web site doesn’t mean anyone will
visit it. Competition to attract visitors is extreme. The reality is that of the
millions of Web pages out there, only a handful actually attract a steady
readership; and these same Web pages are the ones that attract advertisers.
In order to compete, you need to develop and implement a Web site pro-
motion plan.
What can you do when you build a home page that no one visits? What
can you do to earn money on your Web site? Is there an easy way to
attract readers and advertisers without spending a fortune? Increase Your
Web Traffic In a Weekend, Sixth Edition answers these questions. It is designed
to take the mystery out of Web promotion and to help you make your
Web site stand out and get noticed.
What’s This Book About?
With users from countries around the world, the Web has an extremely
diverse audience. Trying to tap into the tremendous potential of the Web
can be a daunting task. Enter Increase Your Web Traffic In a Weekend, Sixth
Edition. The goal of this book is to lay out a cost-effective, comprehensive
plan that both Web beginners and experts can use to build an audience
for a home page or Web site.

niques collected from years of practical experience. These secrets could save

Introduction

What Do You Need to Use This Book?
The most important ingredients for using this book are a connection to
the Internet and a home page or Web site that you want to promote.
You’ll also need to set aside a little time to implement some of the Web
site promotion techniques that you will learn about in this book. A major
goal of this book is to present you with free and low-cost Web site pro-
motion techniques. Depending on how eager you are to see increased
Web traffic, you may want to set aside a small budget, anywhere from
$50 to a few hundred dollars, to support your Web site promotion plan.
However, 99 percent of the Web site promotion techniques that you will
learn about as you go through this book can be implemented at no cost.
So, setting aside a small budget is optional. 
What Do You Need to Know?
Increase Your Web Traffic In a Weekend, Sixth Edition guides you through
everything you need to successfully promote your Web site or home page.
It is assumed that you already have a Web site that you are ready to
promote. Although you certainly don’t need to be an HTML expert, you
should know at least the basics of HTML. If you don’t know HTML, a
good “how to” guide is Course Technology’s HTML, XHTML, and CSS for
the Absolute Beginner (ISBN: 1435454235). Finally, you should also know
the basics of Web browsing. If this is all true, you’re on the right track.
Conventions Used in This Book
This book uses a number of conventions to help make it easier for you to
work with, including: 
Notes. Enhance a discussion in the text by drawing your attention to a particular point
that needs emphasis.

Getting Your Web Site Noticed

This page intentionally left blank 

T
housands of Web publishers have created home pages to sell products
and services or to simply share ideas. Often they are disappointed
with the results, receiving only a few visitors. These publishers
might think that their ideas, interests, and products aren’t interesting, but
nothing could be further from the truth. The real problem is not the content
of the Web site but a lack of visibility. You could have the best site in the
world, but if no one knows about it, they can’t visit it. Capitalizing on
available resources and knowing how to promote your site are the keys to
increasing your Web traffic. By the end of this weekend, you’ll know a great
deal more about how to do that and will be well on your way to having
your site seen, visited, and explored.
So go ahead—get started. It’s Friday evening (at least if you’re following
the schedule). This evening’s session provides an overview of what you
need to get started, and it gets you acquainted with crucial issues and
resources you’ll focus on to get your Web site noticed by the masses.
Increase Your Web Traffic In a Weekend, Sixth Edition is designed as a guide
to everything you need to successfully promote your Web site or home
page. In this book, promotion encompasses publicizing, marketing, adver-
tising, and all the other techniques that help bring traffic to a Web site.
Although promotion is 35 percent inspiration and 65 percent perspira-
tion, promoting your Web site can be an awful lot of fun.
3

You Built It, but Will They Come?
As incredible as it might seem, cyberspace contains hundreds of millions
of Web pages. As if this competition wasn’t stiff enough, there are no Web
maps—and there are relatively few signposts—to guide readers anywhere.
So how can anyone find your Web site? Unfortunately, no easy answer to
this question exists.
After you’ve spent hours of your time and possibly hundreds or thousands
of dollars creating a home page, it is certainly disheartening when no one
visits your site—or the traffic is so minimal that it might as well be non-
existent. Usually, the next step for many Web publishers is to launch their
own promotion campaign. They register with all the search engines they
can find, blanket newsgroups and mailing lists with information about
their home pages, tell everyone they know to visit their site—in other
words, they explore all the promotion avenues they’ve heard and read
about.
You could register with search engines till your fingers won’t type any
more, but unless you truly understand how search engines work and how
to use their indexing features, you may not get the results you are looking
for. You could send out tons of e-mail through mailing lists and news-
groups, but unless you know what you are doing, you will get so much
hate mail that you will truly wish you had never published a home page
in the first place.
In the end, when the euphoria over getting a new Web page noticed wears
off, many Web publishers wake up to the cruel reality that creating a Web
page doesn’t automatically draw visitors to it. Fortunately, there are reliable,
low-cost and free ways to get your Web site noticed, as well as to sub-
stantially increase traffic to your Web site. By the end of this book, you
will have everything you need to successfully attract a following to your
Web site, gain an audience for your ideas, and promote your Web site to
the world.
4
Increase Your Web Traffic In a Weekend, Sixth Edition

Can You Really Promote Your Web Site 
without Spending a Fortune?
Invariably, people ask “How much will it cost?” If you’ve been publishing
on the Web for a while, or if you have done some considerable browsing,
you have probably come across sales pitches like these:

Get 325 e-mail addresses for the top magazine, newspapers, and 
e-zines—only $325

We’ll submit your site everywhere for $275

Send e-mail promotions to millions for pennies apiece!

Get listed in 1,500+ search engines and directories for $99.95
Unfortunately, whether these types of pitches sell you on a pennies-apiece
concept or a flat-fee-per-use concept, they are usually nothing more than
cleverly designed ways to get you to open your pocketbook. For example,
out of the list of 325 top magazines, newspapers, and e-zines, usually only
a handful are really interested in the topic that your site covers, and you
could get these e-mail addresses simply by visiting the related Web sites
yourself. So why pay $325 for a few e-mail addresses that you could get
yourself in less than an hour?
Most of the techniques or concepts presented in this book are cost-free. That said, the Web
is constantly changing and what may be free or low-cost today may not be tomorrow.
Making the Web Work for You
Making the Web work for you means conducting your own Web pro-
motion campaign. As with any campaign, your promotion efforts start
with careful planning—such as Web site promotion through search engines.
Few people truly understand how search engines do what they do. Now
it is time to make these search engines work for you. Rather than visit
FRIDAY EVENING  Promoting Your Web Site to the World
5
NOTE

Google’s Web site (www.google.com), shown in Figure 1.1, to find other
Web sites, you will use Google to bring visitors to your Web site.
You start by learning to take advantage of the way search engines find and
retrieve information. Although the inner workings of search engines aren’t
exactly state secrets, each search engine does things differently, which is
why you should use many different techniques to make your Web pages
friendlier to search engines. Web pages that are optimized for search
engines using the techniques covered in the Saturday Morning session,
“Capitalizing on Search Engine Fundamentals,” will help put your Web
site on the map. These techniques ease the burden of obtaining references
to your Web pages.
After you gain a firm understanding of how search engines work, you should
register your Web site with the search engines used by the majority of
Web users. Although your promotion efforts begin with search engines,

engines.

you don’t stop there. Afterward, you move on to Web guides, lists, and
directories, such as the Open Directory (dmoz.org), shown in Figure 1.2.
Just as few people understand how search engines work, few people take
the time to plot out how to get the most out of Web guides, lists, and
directories. You will create your own personal plan of attack in the Satur-
day Morning session, in the section called “Submitting Your Web Site to
the Top Guides, Lists, and Directories.”
The reason for targeting the best directories is to encourage you to use
your time and resources wisely. Why waste your time registering with
every single search engine and directory on the planet when 90 percent
of Web users find what they are looking for by using the top 10 percent
of the Web search and directory sites?
FRIDAY EVENING  Promoting Your Web Site to the World

Figure 1.2
Open Directory—
one of the top 
Web directories.

You will find many other search sites and directories that focus on specific
types of information. These include Yellow Pages directories, category-
specific directories, and specialty directories. Although these search and
directory sites generally have narrow focuses, they are popular and fre-
quently used to find information. For example, anyone looking for a
business listing can use a Yellow Pages directory, such as yellowbook
(www.yellowbook.com), as shown in Figure 1.3.
Including social media sites as part of your Web campaign is just as impor-
tant as including search engines and directories. In recent years, social
media sites have garnered the attention of hundreds of millions of people
around the world, making them among the most frequented locations on
the Web. Social media sites are different from traditional Web sites in that
site members and visitors can directly interact with one another and are

Social media sites form the basis of virtual communities that you are free
to join and interact. By becoming a valued member of these sites, you can
build up a loyal following and there is no end of the amount of traffic 
you can ultimately drive to your Web site. An example of one extremely
popular social media Web site is Facebook, shown in Figure 1.4. You will
learn all about Web marketing through social media based Web sites in
Saturday Morning’s session “Attracting Visitors Using Social Media.”
Leveraging Search Engines, Directories, and
Social Media Web Sites
One of the major themes in any successful Web site promotion campaign
is leveraging the search engines and directories to your advantage.
However, because there are literally hundreds of search engines and direc-
tories out there, it is important that you choose wisely when selecting

which search engines and directories to use. As you work your way through
this book, you’ll be introduced to the best search engines and directories.
Crawler-Based Search Engines
A search engine is a tool that assists people in locating Web sites on the
Internet. Search engines seek out and locate new Web sites and then
index their contents, storing the results in a search engine database.
Search engine databases are repositories where search engines store infor-
mation about the Web sites that they discover. 
There have been many changes on the Internet since the first edition of
this book was published. New search engines, such as Google and Bing
have appeared on the scene while many others are no longer available.
Rather than try to find and register your Web site with every search
engine on the Internet, you will be better served by focusing your atten-
tion on the major search engines presented in this book.
Today, Google, Yahoo!, and Bing are by far the three most popular search
engines on the Web. In fact, these three search engines handle over 90
percent of all searches. Beyond these three search engines, there are plenty
of other significant search engines that you may wish to work with. These
search engines include: AOL, Ask, Netscape, AltaVista, and Snap.
Many search engine sites no longer maintain their own search engine
databases. Instead, they retrieve their search engine results from other
search engines. For example, AltaVista is actually owned by Yahoo. Search
results retrieved at AltaVista are actually pulled from the Yahoo! search
engine database. So if you get your Web site registered with Yahoo, your
Web site will also appear in the search results retrieved from AltaVista.
Part of the mission of this book is to help you wade through the complex
set of interrelationships that have been established between search engines
in order to identify the key search engines with which you will want to
register your Web site.
10
Increase Your Web Traffic In a Weekend, Sixth Edition

Human-Powered Directories
Like search engines, there are many directories on the Web that people
visit when looking for information. Human-powered directories are
created and maintained by editors who manually review and add Web
sites to the directory, as opposed to search engines, which use automated
tools to locate and collect information about Web sites. Of the directo-
ries on the Web, Yahoo and Open Directory are the two biggest.
Yahoo! now operates its own search engine from which main results are
retrieved when someone performs a search. However, Yahoo! still maintains
its own Yahoo! Directory. The Open Directory, on the other hand, is a vast
directory, created and maintained by a global community of volunteers.
Getting listed in a directory is important, because once listed there you’ll
find that some search engines will automatically discover your Web site
and add you to their search engine database.
Hybrid Sites
The differences between search engines and directories have become blurred
over the years. That’s because many search sites pull information from
search engines as well as directories. For example, AOL and Netscape
retrieve their primary search results from Google. In addition, AOL and
Netscape also pull results from the Open Directory.
In addition, another breed of search sites known as meta search engines
retrieve their results by passing queries on to multiple search engines and
then combining all the results that are returned back into a single listing.
Examples of popular meta search engines include Mamma and Dogpile.
Paid Inclusion and Paid Placement
A primary focus of this book is to show you how to register for free with
all the major search engines and directories. Generally speaking, it can
take somewhere between 4 to 6 weeks for your Web site to appear in a
search engine’s listings once you initially register with it. 
FRIDAY EVENING  Promoting Your Web Site to the World
11

However, every major search engine on the Web also provides an option
for paid inclusion and paid placement. These two options will cost you a
few dollars but can be important when you are in a hurry to get your site
noticed on the Web. Paid placement is a service in which you are guar-
anteed a high ranking for your Web site for certain search keywords. Paid
inclusion is a service that guarantees you a place in a search engine’s list-
ings but does not guarantee you a high ranking. These two services can
be very useful because they provide you with the ability to get your Web
site registered and noticed within a few days.
Social Media Sites
Social media sites represent a new generation of Web sites based on new
Web development and design techniques collectively referred to as Web
2.0. These Web sites are helping to transform the Web from a platform
where Web site owners dictate content and discussion to one in which Web
site visitors provide the content and interact directly with one another.
Social media sites comes in many different forms, including social net-
working sites like Facebook, Twitter, and MySpace, wikis like Wikipedia,
video sharing like YouTube, as well as blog sites. These sites attract hundreds
of millions of people. They facilitate the creation of virtual communities,
allowing people with common interests to connect with one another.
By signing up with these sites and investing time joining and participat-
ing in communities and groups that attract and build relationships with
the very same types of people your Web sites should interest, you can
develop a reputation of knowledge and expertise. As a result, you’ll drive
high-quality traffic to your Web site.
Promoting Your Web Site to Joe Surfer
Joe Web Surfer is your average person browsing the Web. He’s been there
and done that. Now he’s out looking for a bit of excitement or trying to
find something—gasp!—useful. He’s looking for a site like yours. He just
12
Increase Your Web Traffic In a Weekend, Sixth Edition

doesn’t know it yet. Well, to help Joe on his way, you have to give him a
bit of prodding and grab his attention.
In the real world, you could grab Joe’s attention by putting up a flashing
neon sign that says, “Hey, Joe, over here!” In cyberspace, you grab Joe’s
attention using the tools of the Web promotion trade.
If Joe is looking for something cool, you grab his attention by getting
your site listed as the Cool Site of the Day. Although Cool Site of the Day
is one of the key awards that will get your Web site noticed, many other
awards exist that will get him to notice your site as well. He may be
looking for sites like those featured as Bizarre, Strange, Unusual, or
Weird, such as the site shown in Figure 1.5 (www.webweirdness.com).
You’ll find more information on these and other awards in the Saturday Afternoon
session, under “Getting Your Site Listed as the Cool Site of the Day.”
FRIDAY EVENING  Promoting Your Web Site to the World

NOTE

Definitely not a

If Joe is looking to get something for nothing, you grab his attention with
freebies, such as a giveaway. Then again, Joe may be interested in some other
type of freebie, such as a contest, sweepstakes, or treasure hunt. Catching his
eye when he’s looking for freebies is covered on Sunday Morning under
“Attracting the Masses with Giveaways, Contests, Sweepstakes, and More.”
If Joe enjoys interacting with others, sharing information about himself
and his interests, he may frequent Web sites like Facebook, MySpace, and
Twitter. If Joe is interested in the same things you are, you can catch his
attention by participating on these sites and providing information that
will attract Joe. You can also get Joe to notice you by commenting on the
content that he posts. Once you have his attention, you can encourage
him to visit your Web site.
Other ways to grab Joe’s attention include using straightforward Web
advertising. Most Web users have a newsgroup or mailing list they like to
follow, and Joe is no exception. So to get to Joe where he lives, you have to
visit the discussion groups and forums where he hangs out. If Joe is inter-
ested in topics similar to those covered at your Web site, chances are good
that you will find him hanging out in a like-minded newsgroup or mailing
list. Web site promotion through newsgroups and mailing lists is featured
on Sunday Morning under “Selling Your Web Site through E-mail.”
Sometimes, the best way to get Joe’s attention is to use good old-
fashioned advertising. On the Web, this means using a banner advertise-
ment. You have to admit that sometimes you do click on them, and so
does Joe. If something grabs his eye, he’s going to click on it, and when
he does, you want it to be your site that he visits. To help Joe on his way,
you can use the free advertising techniques that you’ll explore on Sunday
Morning under “Free Banner Advertising: No Joke.”
Determining Who Is Visiting Your Web Site
Increasing your Web site traffic means taking a closer look at your Web
site to understand the big picture—who is visiting your Web site and why.
14
Increase Your Web Traffic In a Weekend, Sixth Edition

Trying to promote your Web site without understanding the big picture
is like trying to play baseball without a ball—you just can’t do it.
To get your hands on the “big picture,” you will need to collect and
analyze statistical data regarding who is visiting your Web site, which you
will learn how to do on Sunday Afternoon’s session “Discovering Who’s
Visiting Your Site and Why.” With this data in hand, you will be able to
examine your Web site with an honest eye and take a look at problem
areas within your Web site. By examining your Web site’s statistical data,
you will see firsthand the pages at your Web site that get the most visitors
and those that don’t get any visitors. 
When you examine your site’s traffic, you will move beyond tracking file
accesses and zero in on the things that matter, such as page views and the
actual number of visitors. When you look at page views and visitor counts,
you can answer many of the following questions about your Web site.

What are the busiest days of the week?

What are the busiest hours of the day?

What are the most requested pages?

Where do visitors live and work?

What is the average number of page views per day?

What is the average number of visitors per day?

What is the average number of page views per visitor?

What is the length of the average visit?

What is the total number of visitors?
You will use stats not only to understand who is visiting your Web site
right now and why, but also to help put together a promotion campaign
for your Web site. By digging deeper through the stats, you can find out
whether people like what they see or are just racing through your Web site.
You also can discover problem areas at your Web site that may cause you to
lose visitors who otherwise might come back to your Web site repeatedly.
FRIDAY EVENING  Promoting Your Web Site to the World
15

After you develop a clear understanding of your Web site, you will learn how
to put your Web site’s stats to work. The first step is to summarize the stats
and transform them into meaningful data. Then you will use the stats to
make your Web site a better place to visit by taking care of the following:

Cleaning up unused pages

Clearing out dead ends

Fixing errors
You can use the stats to build cross-traffic to attract users to popular areas
of your Web site.
Wrapping Up and Looking Ahead
Registering with search engines is a terrific way to build Web site traffic,
especially when you consider that millions of people use search engines to
find information every day. Social media sites are another integral compo-
nent of any good Web marketing effort. As with search engines, you’ll get
more bang for your buck if you focus your time and attention on the most
popular social media Web sites. Guides, lists, and directories can also help
get your Web site noticed. Of course, to make the best use of your available
time, make sure that you focus your attention on the best search engines,
guides, lists, and directories. Although you aren’t guaranteed a listing in a
guide to the best of the Web, your time is still well spent when you con-
sider that a single award could bring thousands of visitors to your site.
That’s enough for this evening. It’s time to put this book down and relax
your mind and body. Tomorrow you’ll learn how to start registering with
search engines and how to submit your Web site for inclusion in the
major guides, lists, and directories. You’ll also learn about a number of
specialty directories and how to get listed in What’s New directories and
what steps to take to get your Web site listed as Cool Site of the Day. 
In addition, you will learn the basics of Web promotion using social media
Web sites. So, watch a little TV and get a good night’s sleep. Tomorrow
will be a busy day.

egistering with search engines is a terrific way to build traffic to
your Web site, especially when you consider that millions of people
use search engines to find information every day. Guides, lists, and
directories can also help your Web site get noticed. Although you aren’t
guaranteed a listing in a guide to the best of the Web, your time is still well
spent when you consider that a single award could bring thousands of 
visitors to your site.
Capitalizing on Search Engine Fundamentals
Finding Web sites would be nearly impossible without sites that let you
quickly and easily search for information. These so-called search engines
provide a service that puts all the resources of the Web within reach.
Search engines allow Web publishers to register their pages so that they
will be added to the list of resources the search engine knows about.
Search engines also allow Web users to find pages using keywords and
keyword phrases that identify the information the users want to find.
Although search engines provide a great tool that you can use to get your
Web site noticed by users around the world, few people truly understand
how they work. That is, people rarely get the most out of search engines
and often waste their time and resources when they register their site with
search engines. In this session, you will learn how search engines work
and how you can make the most of the techniques that search engines use
to index and reference your Web site.
19

Millions of Users Are but a Search Away
Millions of people are just a click away from your Web site. They just
need to follow the references that lead to you. The only problem is that
your Web site probably doesn’t show up in the results retrieved by the
search engine they are using. Or on the rare occasion when the results
show your site, users lack the information necessary to make the decision
to visit your site. At that point, they head off to some other site. Day in
and day out, this scenario plays out repeatedly at hundreds of search
engines on the Web. The result is that your Web site doesn’t get the level
of traffic it deserves.
Because few people truly understand how search engines work, Web site
publishers often get frustrated when they try to attract visitors using
search engines. Usually, the Web site publisher will register the site with
a few search engines, then sit back and wait for visitors to come. When
visitors don’t come, the Web site publisher registers with more search
engines. Eventually, the Web site publisher might even turn to commer-
cial services that promise to bring visitors to the Web site.
Search engines are one of the least understood Internet tools, and a lack
of understanding can be a golden opportunity for someone to make a
buck at your expense. You’ll find services trying to sell you the Holy Grail
for hundreds of dollars. These services tell you that they will register your
site with every search engine available, get your site listed in the top 10
search results every time, or trick search engines into displaying your site
more often. Don’t buy whatever they’re selling unless you’ve got money
to burn. Instead, take the time to learn how search engines work, and use
this information to get your site noticed by millions of Web users.
Indexers, Spiders, Crawlers, and 
Other Web Beasties
In the Web’s early days, search engines were simply tools for finding infor-
mation using indexes. Much like the index of your favorite computer
book, the purpose of the index was to make finding information possible
20
Increase Your Web Traffic In a Weekend, Sixth Edition

by using keywords. Rather than page references used in traditional indexes,
Web indexes have hypertext links that you click on to access the infor-
mation at Web sites around the world.
Over the years, search engines evolved. Today, the best search engines are
complex applications that use advanced techniques to put millions of
Web pages at the fingertips of Web users.
Working with Search Engines
No matter what label you use to identify a search engine, the fundamen-
tal purpose of a search engine is to index Web sites in a way that allows
people to use keywords to find Web pages that interest them. To do this,
search engines rely on a computer called an indexer, spider, or crawler to
ferret out the pages at your site and then create indexed references to
those pages in the search engine’s database. After the pages are indexed,
anyone can use the front-end search process to find the pages.
If you jaunt over to Excite at www.excite.com, you will find that the main
page has an area called Search the Web. As shown in Figure 2.1, Search
contains an input field for entering the keywords or keyword phrases on
which you want to search. When you click on the Search button, the search
engine uses the parameters you’ve entered to find matching references.
When you search using the keywords “central drive” and click on the
Search button, you get a list of results like those shown in Figure 2.2.
Typically, the results of a search are displayed according to their relevance
to the search parameters that you entered. The first couple of results listed
by the search engine will be sponsored results. The rest of the listing will
consist of results that the search engine believes best match your search.
Most search engines display reference to the top 10 or 20 pages that
match your search parameters. Successive groups of matching pages are
also available, but you have to follow a link to another results page. At
Excite, you can click on the Next link found at the bottom of the results
page to see additional pages that might be matches for your search.

a search.

Often, the matching pages are described using the page title and a brief
description taken from the page itself. Most commercial search engines
allow you to customize the search and results displayed. The search engine
at Excite lets you customize the search in many different ways. For example,
you can specify the number of results that are listed at a time or specify
one of several safe search settings.
Comparing Search Engines and Directory Lists
Search engines and directory lists are very different. When you look for
information with a search engine, you use keywords. When you look for
information at a directory listing, you search by following links to pages
within the directory site. You start your search by clicking on a broad cat-
egory, such as entertainment, and eventually drill down to a very specific
subject, such as movie reviews. One of the best-known directory lists is
maintained by Yahoo! (dir.yahoo.com).
When you visit Yahoo’s Directory page (shown in Figure 2.3), you are
greeted by a listing of top-level categories of information available at the
site. Under the top-level categories are more focused categories of infor-
mation. If you select the News and Media category, you jump to the page
shown in Figure 2.4. As you can see, this page shows many different
broad categories of news. By selecting another link, you can get to a more
narrowly focused category, such as business news or technology news.
Directory lists are covered extensively later in this session under the heading,
“Submitting Your Web Site to the Top Guides, Lists, and Directories.”
Who Powers Whom?
In order to make the best use of your time, it is important for you to
know which search engines people use the most. This way you can target
your efforts at the search engines that will help get your Web site noticed
by the largest number of people.

Today, the three most popular general-purpose search engines are Google
(www.google.com), Yahoo! (www.yahoo.com), and Bing (www.bing.com).
Bing is Microsoft’s new search engine. Together these three search engines
account for over 90 percent of all search engine queries. Perhaps even
more importantly, many other search engines retrieve at least part of their
results from these three search engines.
The search engine business is highly competitive, and things are constantly
changing. As of the writing of the sixth edition of this book, Microsoft
and Yahoo! had entered into a 10-year agreement, the result of which is
that Bing will eventually serve as Yahoo!’s search engine. As of August
2010, all of Yahoo!’s U.S. and Canadian searches were being powered 
by Bing. By combining forces, Microsoft and Yahoo! hope to build an
alliance that rivals Google’s dominant position as a search provider.
In addition to providing its own search results, Yahoo! provides search
results to AltaVista (www.altavista.com), which is owned by Yahoo!.
Google is also a major source used by numerous search engines, includ-
ing AOL (www.aol.com), Netscape (www.netscape.com), and Excite
(www.excite.com). Excite also retrieves search results from Yahoo!, Bing,
and Ask.
There are plenty of other good search engines of which you need to be
aware. In addition, there are a number of special-purpose search engines,
such as child-oriented search engines, that may also fit well into your Web
promotion plan. You’ll learn about these later in this session in the section
named “Increasing Your Web Traffic with the Top Search Engines.”
Search Engine Fundamentals
Before you run off and start registering your Web site with the different
search engines, it is important that you understand exactly what search
engines are and how they work. Although we’ve come to think of search
engines as giant applications that find information, a search engine is
really three different applications that work together to find and retrieve
information. 
SATURDAY MORNING  Putting the Motion in Promotion
25

The applications are as follows:

An indexer. The back-end application that finds and indexes pages
for inclusion in a database; other names for this type of application
include spider, crawler, and robot.

A database. The application that stores the index references to Web
pages.

A query interface. The application that handles the queries submitted
by users.
Search engines can’t find or index your Web site without a little help,
which is why people register their sites. Another way for a search engine
to find your Web site is through a link to one of your pages from someone
else’s site. After a search engine finds your Web site, it uses the links
within your pages to find additional pages at your site. In this way, the
search engine navigates its way through your Web site one link at a time
and adds the information from your Web site into its database
What Do Search Engines Look For?
Search engines don’t store all the data in your Web pages. Instead, they
create indexed references to your pages. Most of the time, such an
indexed reference contains the following information.

Page title. From the <title> tag element of your Web page.

Page URL. The absolute URL to your Web page.

Summary description. A description taken from the Web page.

Keyword list. A list of keywords taken from the Web page, 
accompanied by a relevancy index that explains how relevant 
each indexed word is to other indexed words and how relevant 
the indexed words are to the page title.
Most search engines create indexed references to your Web pages, although
almost every search engine gathers this information from different areas
of your Web page. Whereas one search engine might gather the summary
description for your Web page from the first few hundred characters,
26
Increase Your Web Traffic In a Weekend, Sixth Edition

another search engine might look for common words or phrases in the
page to use in the summary description.
The various search engines use the summary information in different
ways as well. Some search engines make all the information available to
user queries. Other search engines store all the information categories, yet
user queries are performed only against specific categories of data, such as
the page title and keyword list.
What Does the Indexed Reference Look Like for
a Real Page?
To get a better understanding of what indexers do, look at the code
shown in Listing 2.1. As you examine the sample Web page, note the title
and the use of the <meta> tag to describe the page and identify keywords.
Also, note that the page contains lots of text.

Here, the search engine takes most of the information it needs directly

weighed for relevancy and inclusion in the keyword list. You learn more
about relevancy later in this session. Also, note that the summary descrip-
tion for this page is truncated at a preset number of characters, which
means that the last sentence isn’t complete in this case. For search engine

Here, the search engine obtains the page description from a <meta> tag,
and then combines the keyword information provided in another <meta>
tag with words used in the page to come up with a keyword list. Although
this technique might seem unusual, many search engines that take advan-
tage of meta-information combine the description and keywords that you
provide with information taken from the body of the page.

Here, the search engine only makes use of the page title and a summary
description obtained from the first 100 characters of text found in the
page. Although the streamlined entries in the database aren’t desirable for
the Web page publisher, the search engine designers probably chose this
format because it drastically reduces the size of the database, which in
turn reduces overhead and speeds up database queries.
What Happens After Your Web Site Is Indexed?
Indexing a Web site is not a one-time deal. After a search engine initially
indexes your site, it is usually scheduled for reindexing at periodic inter-
vals. By reindexing Web sites, search engines keep up with the ever-
changing face of the Web. That said, not all search engines automatically
reindex your site, and some search engines reindex your Web site so infre-
quently that you end up with outdated references.
Additionally, the way that a search engine reindexes your Web site might
not be what you expect. Some search engines simply check to see whether
the page still exists but don’t update the actual reference to the Web page.
Other search engines check the page header to see whether the page has
changed, so if you changed text at the bottom of the page, the search engine
won’t reindex the page. Still other search engines use the modification
date on the page to determine whether the page should be reindexed. The
search engine then either reindexes the page immediately or schedules 
the page for reindexing at a later date.
32

NOTE

Another problem with search engines is that Web pages you deleted
months ago might still be listed. Although some search engines let you
remove outdated references from the database, the best way to solve these
and other problems you might encounter is to periodically resubmit your
Web site to the search engine. For problems related to pages you’ve moved
to different locations, you might also want to use placeholder documents
and the redirection techniques examined in the Sunday Afternoon session
under “Redirecting Lost Readers.” In this way, you direct readers from
the old page to the new page, and eventually the search engine will pick
up on this and update the references to your Web site.
Determining Popular Keywords
Keyword selection is an important consideration in the preparation of
your Web pages for search engine registration. People surfing the Web
using search engines enter keywords or keyword phrases to generate lists
of links to related topics. The better the keywords and keyword phrases
on your Web pages match up against the keywords or keyword phrases
entered by the people you are trying to attract, the more your Web site
will get noticed.
Keyword Creation Tips
There are a number of different things that you need to think about when
determining what keywords to use on your Web pages. For starters, think
about the search words or phrases you think people will use when search-
ing for the topic covered on your Web pages. These words and phrases
should be your keywords and keyword phrases. For example, if you have
a Web page that covers rock climbing, then “rock climbing” should be
one of your keyword phrases.
A good way to come up with keyword phrases is to think of magazine and newspaper
headlines. A good headline helps attract your attention and guides you to articles that
are of interest to you. A good headline is short, to the point, and descriptive.

33
TIP

34
Increase Your Web Traffic In a Weekend, Sixth Edition
In fact, it is better to use keyword phrases made up of two to three words
than to specify single word keywords. For one thing, lots of sites specify
single word keywords, making competition for these keywords intense.
Instead, by creating phrases specific to your topic, you greatly increase the
chances that your keyword phrases will be viewed by the search engines
as being more relevant.
If your Web site covers a number of different topics, then you will want to generate 
different keywords and keyword phrases for each unique Web page.
Some search engines are case-sensitive. Therefore, searches on “Rock
Climbing” and “rock climbing” may generate different results from the
same search engine. One way around this is to specify different variations
of capitalization when specifying your Web page keywords, such as “Rock
Climbing,” “Rock climbing,” “rock Climbing,” “rock climbing,” or even
“ROCK CLIMBING.” However, since almost everybody searches the
Web using lowercase typing, it is usually not worth the trouble trying to
come up with every possible keyword variation. In addition, by attempt-
ing to anticipate every possible keyword capitalization variation, you run
the risk of accidentally spamming search engines, as discussed in the next
couple pages.
Researching Popular Search Engine Keywords
Another way to come up with good keywords is to take a few minutes to
visit each of the major search engines to see what keywords are being used
most often by people. Google provides a listing of top search engine
queries on a daily basis at www.google.com/trends/hottrends, as shown
in Figure 2.5.

The following list shows where you can go to research popular keywords
for other major search engines.

Free Keyword Generation Tools
If you are still uncertain as to what keywords you want to create for your
Web pages, you might want to try the keyword generator tool provided
by Google. This tool is designed to help paying customers select keywords
for ads. However, this service is free and you can use it to help generate
your own keywords.

Be On Guard Against Accidental Spamming
Keywords are an important tool used to help attract visitors to your Web
pages. However, it is important that you do not get too overzealous. If,
for example, you repeat the same keywords, search engines may pick up
on it and identify your Web page as attempting to spam the engines in an
effort to achieve a high relevancy for certain keywords. If this happens,
then either your Web page’s ranking may be reduced or your Web page
may even be removed from the search engine’s index. So tread carefully
in regards to how many times you repeat your keywords.

Boosting Visits with Ordinary Descriptions
To a search engine, text is the most important part of the page. Search
engines use ordinary text to describe the page, build the keyword list, and
determine the relevance of the page to particular subjects. Although
search engines treat text in different ways, they share some common
themes concerning how text is indexed and referenced.
Images are gaining importance with all of the major search engines. Search engines like
Google, Yahoo!, Bing, Ask, and AOL all have added graphic search services to their
search engine. Using these services, surfers can perform keyword search for images, and
when they click on these images, they’ll be transported directly to the Web site that 
displays them. You will learn more about graphic search services later in “Using Graphic
Search Services to Increase Traffic.”
Understanding Summary Descriptions
Whenever a search engine displays results, the main thing that sells your
page to the reader is the summary description, which usually comes from
the first 100 to 200 characters in the Web page. When you look at your
Web page to see what the description might look like, be sure to include
all text in headers, paragraphs, and other text elements on the page.
Search engines have very specific parameters for obtaining the summary
description. Text at the top of the page is usually given more weight than
text at the bottom of the page. Thus, if you have a short description at
the top of your page followed by several graphic elements, tables, or
linked lists, the search engine might not use text from later sections of the
page. You can see why some page descriptions are short and others fill out
the full 100 to 200 characters used by the search engine.
To help your Web site get noticed, create clear summary statements for
your key Web pages, which include the home page and top-level pages at
your Web site. The summary statement should be the first text element
in the page, perhaps directly following your graphical banner. If you keep
SATURDAY MORNING  Putting the Motion in Promotion
37
TIP

the summary statement short but descriptive, it will usually flow well
with the rest of the page.
Whenever possible, try to end your summary statement with proper punctuation. Believe
it or not, a few search engines look for complete statements. Phrases without punctuation
are considered ambiguous; phrases with punctuation are considered relevant.
Understanding Relevancy
The position of text in your Web page often determines its relevancy.
Because of the variations in how search engines use text, relevancy is one
of the hardest search engine terms to pin down. In general terms, the rel-
evancy of text describes

How a word relates to other words.

The proximity of one word to another.

The position of the word within the page.

Whether the word is presented as part of a complete statement.

How many times the word is used in the page.
The concept of relevancy explains why some of the techniques that pub-
lishers use to get their pages listed at the top of search results lists have
little effect, as well as why a technique might work for one search engine
and not for others. In the end, the varying definition of relevancy makes
optimizing your Web pages for each and every search engine almost impos-
sible. In fact, you’d probably be wasting your time if you tried to optimize
your Web pages for all the search engines.
Have you ever come across a Web page that repeated a word over and over
again? Well, the Web site publisher was probably trying to get the page
listed as the top choice for searches using this keyword. Although this
technique might work for a particular search engine, most other search
engines will completely ignore the repeated use of the word, which causes
the page to appear lower in their search results lists.
38
Increase Your Web Traffic In a Weekend, Sixth Edition
TIP

Have you ever come across a Web page that used phrases that didn’t seem
to fit in the Web page, yet the phrases were there just the same? Here, the
Web site publisher was probably trying to get the page to show up when
someone searched for a hot topic, such as news, entertainment, or sports.
Again, this technique might work for a particular search engine, but other
search engines will give the entire page lower relevancy because it’s full of
ambiguous phrases and doesn’t seem to have a common thread.
Rather than haphazardly repeat keywords or use ambiguous phrases in your
Web page, use sound organizational techniques that bolster the relevancy
of your page’s theme. Focus your attention on your home page and your
top-level pages first. When you look at your home page or top-level page,
ask yourself these questions:

Is the subject of the page clear?

Can I weave the main subject(s) of the page throughout the main
text in such a way that it builds relevancy?

Does the page build the relationship between the main subject and
related topics?

Can I add descriptions to lists of links to clearly define what the
link points to?

Are the statements made in the page clear and complete?

Can I transform ambiguous phrases into clear statements that relate
to the main theme on the page?
Using Page Titles to Your Advantage
A good Web page title will bring visitors to your Web site. Most search
engines display Web pages according to their titles, making the page title
one of the most important elements for bringing visitors to your Web
site. Additionally, your browser displays the title at the top of its window,
as demonstrated in Figure 2.7, and when you bookmark a Web page, the
title is used to differentiate the Web page from other Web pages that
you’ve marked, as shown in Figure 2.8.
SATURDAY MORNING  Putting the Motion in Promotion
39

Beyond its job of grabbing the reader’s attention, the title also plays an
important role in determining the relevancy of the Web page to the
reader’s search parameters. Specifically, the keywords in the title often
receive greater emphasis than other keywords on the page.
The best titles describe the subject of the page in a clear and meaningful
way. Instead of a title that says, “Welcome to my home page,” use a title

that says “Bill’s Home Page: Find Sports Memorabilia, Sports Records, &
Player Stats.” In this way, search engines that use the page title to deter-
mine relevance will have a clear understanding of the page’s subject and
the most important keywords.
Getting Your Frame-Enhanced or Graphics-Intensive
Page Noticed
Pages with frames, scripts, tables, and lots of graphics present special
problems to Web site publishers and search engines. With frame-
enhanced Web pages, the main document usually contains only refer-
ences to the files that a browser loads into each frame. With scripts, the
code is often located at the top of the code for the Web page in the place
of the all-important descriptive text. With graphics-intensive pages, room
for text on the page is limited.
Although some search engines are smart enough to understand and prop-
erly handle frame-enhanced pages, scripts, and graphics-intensive pages,
such search engines are more the exception than the rule. Fortunately,
you can get your Web page noticed without eliminating frames, scripts,
or your wonderful graphics. One way for you to try to do this is through
use of meta-information, which is discussed in a couple pages. However,
there are a few element-specific tricks that you may want to consider as
well, including:

Dealing with frame issues

Dealing with scripts

Managing your tables

Keeping graphics under control
Not every search engine provides the same level of support for meta-information. So
while helpful, meta-information alone may not be enough to accommodate your frames,
scripts, tables, and graphics on every search engine.

41
NOTE

Handling Problems with Frames
Frames present a bit of a challenge for many search engines. When you
create a Web site based on frames, you define a frameset and frames. The
frameset specifies the location and dimension of each frame. However,
some search engines are unable to see past the frameset page, meaning
that they cannot locate the associate frame pages. At this point the rest of
your Web site becomes effectively invisible to the search engine.
One way to deal with frames is to always remember to include a
<noframes> tag. Using this tag, you can specify text that search engines
and visitors with old browsers can see. The <noframes> tag allows
browsers and search engines that can’t understand frames to display other
text so the page doesn’t become a dead end. An example of how to apply
the <noframes> tag is shown in Listing 2.2.
Listing 2.2  Using a <noframes> Area in a Web Page
<html>
<head>
<title>Las Vegas Virtual Tour Guide</title>

<noframes>
<body>
Add text and links here for version of Web page without
frames.
</body>
</noframes>
</html>
42

If you include links along with the descriptive information, you can provide
search engines with the ability to view the other pages in your Web site.
Unfortunately, this approach opens up the possibility that a visitor may
arrive at one of your frame pages, and because it is not presented within the
overall context of your frameset, things begin to break down. However, you
can easily fix this using just a few lines of JavaScript, as demonstrated here:
<script language= “JavaScript”
<!—
If (top == self) self.location.href = “frameset-url”
//—>
</script>
Modify this code by replacing the frameset-url parameter with the name
of your frameset page and then copy and paste the code into the head or
body section of your HTML for each of your frame pages. If a visitor
attempts to directly access any of your frame’s pages, this code will auto-
matically execute and load your frameset page as you intended.
Working Around Scripts
Embedding large scripts into your Web pages presents another problem
for search engines. Since most people place their scripts at the top of their
Web pages, the script pushes the content for the rest of the Web page down.
Unfortunately, many search engines don’t scan your entire page when
indexing your Web site. This can result in the search engine missing out
on most of your Web page’s content.
One way to deal with this issue is to move your scripts, when possible,
further down in your Web pages. Another option to consider is to exter-
nalize your scripts and call them from within your HTML Web pages.
Preventing Problems with Your Tables
Tables present search engines with a similar obstacle to that presented by
scripts. For example, you may include a table about rock climbing equipment
at the top of your Web page that visually displays like the one shown in
Table 2.1.

As mentioned, the best way to deal with this situation is to try to move
your tables further down in your pages and to make sure that, when pos-
sible, your tables include references to your keywords and phrases.
Working Around Your Graphics and Image Maps
As if frames, scripts, and tables weren’t enough, search engines also have
trouble with graphics. From a search engine’s point of view, the only
thing that matters on your Web pages is text. Graphics are ignored. You
can create stunning Web pages that present all sorts of information in the
form of graphics, and search engines won’t see a bit of it.
Consider the importance of balancing presentation with content when
you are designing your Web pages, because it’s the text-based content that
search engines see and use to rate the relevancy of your Web pages. One
way to help mitigate the effectiveness of graphics is to always supply a
descriptive <alt> tag that includes keyword phrases for every graphic on
your Web pages. This way search engines will be able to read and index
alternative information regarding the content of your Web pages.
If you make use of image maps as a navigation tool for providing access
to your Web pages, you are presenting another problem for search
engines. Once again, the search engine won’t be able to view links that
you’ve established via your image map and therefore will not be able to
locate and index your other Web pages. One good way of working around
this problem is to provide a text-based set of links to your Web pages at
the bottom of each of your Web pages. As Figure 2.9 demonstrates, the
text links don’t need to be anything fancy. The important thing is to give
search engines a way to find your other Web pages.
One other technique that you may want to consider is to create a site map
for your Web site and to submit the site map to each search engine along
with your main Web pages. A site map is a Web page that contains links to
every Web page that makes up your Web site. By creating and submitting
a site map, you ensure that the search engines will be able to locate every
page on your Web site.

Graphics take time to load. They take even longer for people that visit your Web site
using a dial-up connection. Many visitors will leave your Web site if it takes too long for
your graphics to load. To prevent this from happening, try keeping the total size of your
main page and any other high-level pages below 50 KB.
Getting the Most from Keywords
and Meta-Information
Meta-information is data that is included in a Web page header but is
hidden from the reader. Usually, meta-information contains instructions
or special notes for Web clients, such as your browser or the indexer used
by a search engine. To provide meta-information to a Web client, you use
the <meta> tag. The information that you can provide to search engines
with the <meta> tag includes a very specific description of the page as well
as additional keywords for the page.
TIP

<meta> tags alone are not enough to guarantee that your Web pages will
get a top-10 ranking with any search engine. However, when used prop-
erly, they can help give you some control over the manner in which search
engines describe your Web site.
Working with Meta-Information
Before you add meta-information to your Web pages, you should know
that not all search engines make use of the <meta> tag. A search engine
that doesn’t use the meta-information simply ignores the information.
For example, Google ignores the <meta> description tag and generates its
own description of your Web page based on the content that it finds.
Additionally, most of the search engines that use meta-information still
index the entire contents of your Web page. Thus, you use the <meta> tag
to give search engines additional information, not to replace the infor-
mation that they’ve already gathered from the Web page.
You use the following two main attributes when you use the <meta> tag:

name: Used to describe the type of meta-information that you are
providing, such as name=”description” or name=”keywords”.

content: Used to supply the actual meta-information, such as the
description of your Web page or a list of keywords for the Web
page.
You can add a description to your page using meta-information as
follows:
<meta name=”description” content=”Writer’s Gallery is a place
for anyone who loves the written word. You’ll find links to
hundreds of writing-related resources as well as new works of 
fiction published at our site. “>
SATURDAY MORNING  Putting the Motion in Promotion
47

48
Increase Your Web Traffic In a Weekend, Sixth Edition
You can add a keyword list to your page using meta-information as
follows:
<meta name=”keywords” content=”writing, reading, write, read,
book, author, story, fiction, nonfiction, literary,
mythology, medieval, biblical, renaissance, library, Dante, 
dickens, Faulkner, Shakespeare, news, world news,
entertainment news, business news, current events,
publishing, dictionary, encyclopedia, bookshelf”>
Most search engines ignore the <meta> keywords tag. However, some don’t, so this tag
is still worth including in your Web pages.
In a Web page, the meta-information is always added to the page header
inside the <head> and </head> tags, as in this example:
<html>
<head>
<title>Writer’s Gallery: Resources for Writers and Readers</title>
<meta name=”description” content=”Writer’s Gallery is a place
for anyone who loves the written word. You’ll find links to
hundreds of writing-related resources as well as new works of 
fiction published at our site. “>
<meta name=”keywords” content=”writing, reading, write,
read, book, author, story, fiction, nonfiction, literary,
mythology, medieval, biblical, renaissance, library,
Dante, Dickens, Faulkner, Shakespeare, news, world news,
Entertainment news, business news, current events,
publishing, dictionary, encyclopedia, bookshelf”>
NOTE

</head>
<body>
. . .
</body>
</html>
If you do not use words located in your <meta> keywords tag elsewhere in your Web
page, you won’t see any boost in your search engine ranking, and if you repeat your key-
words too many times in your <meta> keywords tag of your Web page, you run the risk
of hurting your ranking or getting removed from the search engine’s database.
Using Meta-Information in Your Web Page
The description of your page in the <meta> tag can be every bit as impor-
tant as the summary description in the main text of the page. The advan-
tage to describing a page in the <meta> tag is that you provide the exact
description you want to use, rather than have the search engine extrapo-
late the description from the main text of the page. A good <meta> tag
description summarizes the main selling points of the page in 200 char-
acters or less. Because some search engines use page descriptions that are
fewer than 200 characters, try to put the most relevant information first.
When it comes to finding your Web page in a search engine, a <meta>
tag keywords list may give your Web page a definite edge over a page that
doesn’t use meta-information (for search engines that support it). The
main thing to remember is that the <meta> tag keywords list is normally
used in addition to the keywords that the search engine gathers from the
main text of the page. Thus, rather than simply repeating keywords that
appear in the main text, you might want to concentrate on related topics
or variations of the primary keywords. For example, if the keyword is
writer, you can use variations such as write, writing, and written.
SATURDAY MORNING  Putting the Motion in Promotion
49
NOTE

50
Increase Your Web Traffic In a Weekend, Sixth Edition
It is better to create keywords that are two or more words long. This makes them more
relevant to your Web site.
You can also create various combinations of keywords or phrases in the
keyword list. This doesn’t mean that you should repeat the keyword several
times. Instead, create working combinations, such as business news, enter-
tainment news, and sports news. Keep in mind that some search engines
penalize you for repeating specific keywords too many times. In fact, the
search engine might disregard the keyword list entirely if you repeat key-
words too many times, as in the following example
<meta name=”keywords” content=”news, news, news, news,
news, news, news, news, news, news,
business, business, business, business, business, business,
business, entertainment, entertainment, entertainment, 
entertainment, entertainment, entertainment, sports, sports,
sports, sports, sports, sports, sports”>
The following example instead uses word combinations and variations of
the topic for the keyword list.
<meta name=”keywords” content=”news, business, entertainment,
sports, current events, business news, entertainments news,
sports news”>
Just as the length of your description is important, the length of your
keyword list is important as well. Generally speaking, limit the keyword
list to fewer than 1,000 characters. Further, try to restrict the number of
times that you repeat any word in the keyword list. A good rule of thumb
is to use a keyword or a word combination that uses the keyword no more
than seven times. In the previous example, the keyword “news” was
repeated four times.
TIP

After you update your home page and top-level pages with meta-information,
consider adding meta-information to the rest of your Web pages. Although
this might be a mammoth undertaking, the payoff makes the time invest-
ment worthwhile. Also, tailor your meta-information to each individual
page rather than the site as a whole.
Meta Tag Generators
If you want a little help with the generation of your <meta> tags, to
ensure that they have the correct syntax, help is just a few clicks away.
There are a number of Web sites where you can go for assistance. You’ll
still have to supply the actual description and keywords that you wish to
use for your Web site. These sites will take this information and generate
<meta> tags, which you can then copy and insert into your Web 
pages. For example, look at the meta tag generator provided at

good your tags are. You can do this by visiting any number of Web sites
that provide free <meta> tag analysis, such as the Meta Tag Analyzer pro-
vided at www.submitexpress.com/analyzer/ (shown in Figure 2.11).

Leveraging Your alt Tags and Comments
As has already been stated, search engines cannot read or gain informa-
tion from graphics embedded in a Web page. Therefore, it is important
to add an <alt> tag for each image. Obviously, each <alt> tag should
provide a description of its associated image. Search engines read <alt>
tags. Therefore, you can use them to help you increase your ranking for
specific keywords and keyword phrases. To avoid accidental spamming,
it’s a good idea to limit the number of keywords used in your <alt> tags
to 3-5 instances.
Search engines also read any HTML comments that you embed in your
Web pages. HTML comments provide you with another opportunity to
present your keywords and keyword phrases. Just don’t go overboard and
abuse them.
Inspecting Your Web Page’s Body Text
Adding keywords and keyword phrases to your <title> and <meta> tags
is an important step in your effort to achieve a high search engine ranking
for your Web pages. However, in order for your keywords and keyword
phrases to have their full effect, you must also include them in the text
located in the body of your Web pages.
Many search engines add extra weight to keywords found at the begin-
ning of a Web page over those found at the end of the Web page. There-
fore, it’s a good idea to make the integration of keywords and keyword
phrases at the beginning of your Web page a primary objective.
SATURDAY MORNING  Putting the Motion in Promotion

Some search engines build all or part of the description for your Web site from the text
at the beginning of your Web pages. Therefore, it’s a good idea to consider making the
first sentence on your Web page match the text that you added to your <meta> tag
description statement. This will increase the chances of you getting the description you
want with some of the major search engines.
If the design of your Web page depends on the use of graphics at the
beginning of your page, that’s okay too. Just make sure that you find a
way to include some text just above, below, or beside your graphics and
that you remember to include keywords and keyword phrases.
A Last Look at Search Engine Fundamentals
As you have seen, you can do many things to improve the odds of
someone finding your Web page through a search engine. The idea here
is not to trick the search engine into displaying references to your pages.
Instead, you are structuring your pages so the search engine can clearly
identify the subjects your pages cover and index the appropriate keywords
for those subjects. You are also using techniques that make it easier for
your readers to identify the subjects covered in your pages. Figure 2.12
shows the main design concepts to follow when you optimize your Web
pages for search engines.
If you haven’t done so already, create descriptive blurbs for your Web site.
Start by identifying the most popular areas at your Web site, and then use
the subjects covered in these areas to come up with a brief description
that identifies your site’s niche. Next, create separate descriptions for each
popular area at your Web site. When you finish this, take a few minutes
to apply the concepts discussed in the search engine fundamentals section
to your home page and other top-level pages at your Web site. This will
prepare you to register with search engines of all types.

Using Graphic Search Services 
to Increase Traffic
In recent years all of the major search engines have placed more and more
importance on images, which makes perfect sense given that people are
far more likely to be attracted to images than text. A good image may
result in attracting a surfer that might otherwise pass on visiting a Web
page based on its text description.
Recognizing the power of graphics, search engines have added image
search services to their search engines. Google Images, shown in Figure
2.13 is by far the best known and most popular, servicing over a billion
views every day.
Image search services allow surfers to perform keyword searches on image
files, returning results as a thumbnail listing, as demonstrated in Figure
2.14. By clicking on a thumbnail, surfers are transferred to the Web page
where the image is displayed. Obviously, this makes image search services
an important source of Web traffic.

Here is a list of search engines and their associated image search service:

Google: images.google.com

Yahoo!: http://images.search.yahoo.com

Bing: http://www.bing.com/images

ASK: http://www.ask.com/pictureslanding

AOL: http://search.aol.com/aol/imagehome
Keyword searches are based on image file names, the text included in links
to the images, and the text that is published adjacent to those images. To
take advantage of image search services to improve the traffic to your Web
site, you must do several things. First, you must make sure that your
images are worth viewing. They must have attractive subject matter and
should be of good quality. Second, you should assign meaningful names
to your image files. Avoid using names such as PCT12043.JGP and instead
use names that include keywords that you think surfers are most likely 
to use when searching for an image like yours. To further strengthen the
searchability of your images, make sure that the text in the links also con-
tains keywords. Lastly, make sure that the text displayed adjacent to your
Web page images also contain keywords.
As the old saying goes, a picture can speak a thousand words. By adding
really interesting images to your Web pages and making them search engine
friendly, you may be able to make them worth a thousand visits as well!
Take a Break
Okay, this is a good place to take a quick break. You’ve already accom-
plished a lot. Stretch. Relax for a moment and let things soak in. Go get a
cup of coffee or tea and when you return you will review additional search
engines and directories where you may also want to register your Web site.

Registering with the Top Search Engines
on the Planet
Once you have optimized your Web pages for indexing, you are ready to
submit them to search engines. Although hundreds of search engines are
out there, trying to submit your Web site to every single one of them is
not practical or worthwhile. Instead, you should start by registering your
site with the major search engines. Because the search engines covered in
this section index tens of millions of Web pages, they are the ones used
most often to search the Web, and you can make the most of your time
and resources by focusing your efforts on these search engines.
Submitting Your Site to a Search Engine
When you register with a search engine, you let the search engine know
that your Web site exists. Many search engines take a preliminary look at
your site immediately after you submit it and verify that the address you
provided is valid. Afterward, the search engine schedules your site for
indexing.
Although several days might pass before the indexing begins, the actual
time you have to wait to get into the database depends on the backlog of
new sites waiting to be entered and the efficiency of the indexer. Some
search engines might index your Web site within hours, while others
might not index your site for weeks.
How Does Indexing Work?
Most search engines use the URL you submit to find other pages at your
Web site. Give the search engine the URL to your home page in this form:
http://www.your_isp.com/~you/.
The indexer uses this page as a launching pad to all the other pages at
your Web site. Generally, the indexer creates an indexed reference to the
current page and then searches all the links on the page one by one. If 
the first link the indexer finds is to a page called background.html, the
indexer accesses the background.html page, creates an indexed reference,
58
Increase Your Web Traffic In a Weekend, Sixth Edition

and then searches all the links on this page one by one. Eventually, the
indexer crawls through every page of your Web site.
If an area of your Web site is not linked to a main page that the indexer can find, that
area will not be indexed. The solution is to add a link on a top-level page that the indexer
can find or to register the area separately.
How Can You Exclude Directories and Pages?
Although indexing your site is a good thing, sometimes you might not
want the search engine to index your entire site. There are a couple of dif-
ferent ways that you can control what pages are indexed and what pages
aren’t indexed. One option is to use a robot exclusion file. The exclusion
file is a plain-text file placed in the top-level directory for your Web server.
In the exclusion file, you specify the directories or pages that search engines
are not allowed to index. The name of the exclusion file must be robots.txt.
Because you will generally want the exclusion to apply to all search
engines, the first line of the file should read as follows:
User-agent: *
Here, user-agent refers to the search engine accessing the file, and the
asterisk (*) is a commonly used symbol that means all. After telling the
search engine to make the exclusions, you specify the directories or pages
to exclude. Alternatively, you can exclude an entire directory as follows:
Disallow: /cgi-bin/
Or
Disallow: /images/
You can use the free online robots.txt analysis tool located at http://tools.seobook.com/
robots-txt/analyzer/ to scan and verify the contents of your Web server’s robots.txt file.
SATURDAY MORNING  Putting the Motion in Promotion
59
NOTE
TIP

If you prefer, you can exclude an individual single page as follows:
Disallow: /prg/webstat.html
You can put all these entries into an exclusion file as follows:
User-agent: *
Disallow: /cgi-bin/
Disallow: /images/
Disallow: /prg/webstat.html
If you publish a large Web site or publish your Web site as part of a larger domain, you
should strongly consider using an exclusion list. With so many Web pages, search engines
are finding it harder and harder to index everything at a Web site. For this reason, some
search engines index only 500-700 pages per domain.
Another option available to you is the Robots <meta> tag. By placing an
instance of this tag in the head section of a Web page, you can specify
whether it should be indexed and whether the search engine should
follow any links that it might find in the page. This option is particularly
useful when you don’t have access to the robots.txt file.
The Robots <meta> tag supports 4 different parameters (or directives), as
listed below.

index: Instructs the search engine to index the page.

noindex: Instructs the search engine not to index the page.

follow: Instructs the search engine to follow any links that it finds
on the page.

nofollow: Instructs the search engine not to follow any links that it
finds on the page.
The following example shows a Robots <meta> tag that instructs the
search engine not to index the Web page’s content or follow any of its links.
<meta name=”Robots” content=”noindex,nofollow”>
60
Increase Your Web Traffic In a Weekend, Sixth Edition
TIP

Similarly, the following example instructs the search engine to index the
page but not to follow any of it links.
<meta name=”Robots” content=”index,nofollow”>
How Often Is Your Site Reindexed?
Indexing your Web site is not a one-time deal. Most search engines peri-
odically reindex your pages. By reindexing your pages, the search engine
can verify that the pages still exist and update the database reference to
your page if necessary.
In an ideal world, search engines would rapidly remove references to Web
pages that no longer exist and just as rapidly create references to new 
Web pages that you build. In reality, search engines do not remove Web
pages or find new Web pages as quickly as we would like. Whenever your
site is busy, down, or can’t respond to a request, the search engine simply
marks the Web pages and moves on. If the server can’t find the Web page
on several occasions, the Web page is removed from the database.
Search engines don’t add new Web pages as fast as one would like because
they often don’t reindex the entire site and all its contents. Instead, the
search engine might check only for changes by comparing Web page
headers or modification dates. The result is that the search engine might
need several visits to find and index a new area of your Web site.
Why Won’t This Search Engine List Your Site?
Sometimes you register with a search engine only to find, days or weeks
later, that you can’t locate your site anywhere in the search engine’s data-
base. A search engine might not list your site for several reasons, but the
main reason is usually that the URL you provided couldn’t be read or
used. To avoid this problem, ensure that you type the complete URL to
your Web site. Because URLs can be case-sensitive (depending on the
Web server), make sure that your URL uses the proper case. For example,
some Web servers might consider the URLs http://www.tvpress.com/
HOME.htm and http://www.tvpress.com/Home.htm as being differ-
ent Web pages.
SATURDAY MORNING  Putting the Motion in Promotion
61

You should also watch the syntax of the URL. Some search engines will
not use a URL that includes reserved characters, such as:
=
The equals sign
$
The dollar sign
?
The question mark
A search engine may not index your site if you use frames and the search
engine doesn’t know how to deal with them. To ensure that the search engine
can find your page links, add a <noframe> tag that contains the text and
links to the Web page. 
Scripts and graphics-only pages can also present problems for search
engines. Use the techniques discussed previously this morning under
“Capitalizing on Search Engine Fundamentals” to make sure your Web
page has a description and keywords.
Additionally, if you don’t have your own domain, a robots.txt file might
be the cause of your problems. As discussed previously, the robots.txt file
can be used to keep search engines out of specific directories. To check
the contents of the robots.txt file for your domain, use this URL:
http://www.your-domain.com/robots.txt
in which “your-domain” is your actual domain. If the robots.txt file
excludes your directory or all public directories on the server, you’ve
found the cause of the problem. If you find that your files are excluded
in the robots.txt file, ask the Web server administrator whether this can
be changed.
Search Engine Tricks to Avoid
One of the goals of this book is to show you proven techniques for
improving your standing in the search engines. There are other uncon-
ventional tricks that you can also employ to try to dupe search engines
into giving your Web site a better standing. You may have seen some of
these tricks applied at other Web sites or read about them on the Web.
62
Increase Your Web Traffic In a Weekend, Sixth Edition

Use of these tricks is dubious at best and you should avoid using them.
Search engine developers consider these tricks to be a form of spam, and
when you use spam, you have to expect a penalty. The penalty is often
delisting from a search engine. Delisting means that none of your Web
pages will be available in the search engine.
The next several sections point out some of these tricks (or traps) so that
you won’t fall prey to using them on your Web pages.
Title Tricks
Page titles are a very important means of improving your standing with
search engines. Some Web site publishers try to get more oomph out 
of their titles using a technique called keyword loading. Using a form of
keyword loading, you add multiple instances of the <title> tag to your
Web pages and load them with keywords to try to improve keyword rel-
evance. For example:
<title>Daily News: finance news, business news, current events</title>
<title>Sports Connection: baseball, football, basketball</title>
<title>Book Nook: rare book, collector book, first print book</title>
While it might be tempting to list lots of keywords in this manner, it is
better to stick with the top 10 or so. This will give the keywords greater
importance. 
Having more than one <title> tag isn’t considered proper HTML, but
it doesn’t cause any errors. Another trick that you may come across is
<title> tag duplication. When you repeat a page title, you take a stan-
dard title (without keyword loading) and copy it several times. The
thought here is that by repeating the same <title> tag statement, Web
site publishers may be able to give their site better standing on some
search engines.
SATURDAY MORNING  Putting the Motion in Promotion
63

For example, instead of 
<head>
<title>Daily News: Your news source</title>
</head>
You could use
<head>
<title>Daily News: Your news source</title>
<title>Daily News: Your news source</title>
<title>Daily News: Your news source</title>
</head>
Modern browsers are smart enough to look only at the first instance of a
<title> tag in a Web page and to skip over any duplicate tags that may
follow. However, just because your visitors cannot tell the difference that
does not mean the search engines won’t identify the use of this trick and
delist the offending Web site.
Hidden Text and Fields
Earlier, you read about adding descriptive summaries to your Web pages
as a way of improving your standing. While this works in many cases,
sometimes you don’t want a summary paragraph in the midst of your pol-
ished page. Because of the importance of this text, you might be tempted
to try to hide the text from visitors. You might also want to load up the
page with additional descriptions or keywords that are all hidden from
your visitors.
One way that some Web site publishers try to hide text from visitors is to
add descriptions or keywords that use the same color as the background
for the page. For example, if the background color is black, they might
add hidden text by setting the font color to black. In addition, to give this
text as small a footprint as possible on the page, the Web site publisher
might set the font size to 1, as demonstrated here:
64
Increase Your Web Traffic In a Weekend, Sixth Edition

<font color =”#000000” size=”1”> Writer’s Gallery is a 
place for anyone who loves the written word. You’ll find
links to hundreds of writing-related resources as well as
new works of fiction published at our site.</font>
To avoid the watchful eye of search engines, some Web site publishers try to use a color
that is close to the background color but doesn’t match it exactly. However, most modern
search engines now look for these types of tricks and may delist Web sites that use the
same or similar color for both the font and background. Another technique to avoid a
penalty is to use a background image with colors that your hidden text can blend into.
HTML comments also let you hide text from readers. With HTML com-
ments, you can place text on the page that the search engine can see but
your readers can’t:
<!— Entertainment news, business news, current events —>
<!— Rare book, collector book, first print book —>
While it is perfectly acceptable to add keywords into your HTML
comment statements, avoid loading them up. Otherwise, you’ll run the
risk that some search engines will view the comments as spam. Some
search engines also read values associated with input fields. Some Web site
publishers try to use hidden input fields to boost their standings, as
demonstrated in the following example.
<input type=”hidden” value=”baseball, football, basketball, hockey”>
Here, input type hidden and its associated value attribute were used to
store additional descriptive text or keywords. Clearly, using hidden input
fields in this manner puts any Web site that tries this at risk.
Setting Up Multiple Versions of Your Pages
Mirror sites have long been used to provide additional ways to access
popular Web resources. What many Web site publishers have discovered
SATURDAY MORNING  Putting the Motion in Promotion
65
TIP

is that if they mirror individual pages, they can drive additional traffic to
their Web site. When you mirror a page, you create copies of a page.
To give the mirrored pages greater importance, the Web site publishers
keep their mirrored pages short and stick with text descriptions and key-
words. They use different descriptions and keywords to tailor the pages to
specific audiences and search engines and then save the pages with unique
names. For example, pages might be named sequentially, such as
index1.htm, index2.htm, index3.htm, and so on. Once finished, each
individual page is registered.
The idea here isn’t to dazzle readers with these mirror pages, but rather to
get the readers to visit the main Web site. Each of the mirrored Web pages
contains links that directs them to the main page or will automatically
redirect visitors to the main page via a <meta> tag. (Redirecting readers
to a new page is discussed in the Sunday Afternoon session titled “Redi-
recting Lost Readers.”)
Search engines and directories look unfavorably on any Web site that tries
to manipulate things in this manner, and visitors often don’t appreciate
being redirected like this. The bottom line here is not to use this trick.
Increasing Your Web Traffic with 
the Top Search Engines
Registering with the major search engines is one of the best ways to
increase traffic to your Web site. If you’ve followed the techniques for
optimizing your Web site for search engines as discussed previously under
“Capitalizing on Search Engine Fundamentals,” you should see marked
improvements in your Web traffic simply by registering with the search
engines listed in this section. Don’t expect a flood of traffic the day after
you register your Web site; rather, you should see a steady increase in the
level of traffic your Web site receives over time. The actual increase you
see will depend on the subject of your site, its size and quality, and your
use of search engine optimization techniques.
66
Increase Your Web Traffic In a Weekend, Sixth Edition

Although you could use the techniques discussed here to register with
hundreds of other search engines, the reward for all your hard work
usually isn’t worth the effort. Millions of people use only the major search
engines to find what they need. Every day, these search engines collec-
tively handle about 95 percent of the searches performed by general
search engines. Obviously, this means that the hundreds of other general
search engines handle only 5 percent of the search transactions. Do you
really want to spend countless hours registering with hundreds of other
search engines when you can potentially reach the vast majority of users
simply by registering with the most-used search engines? Probably not.
When you register with a search engine, you generally provide the URL
to your top-level page. The search engine uses this single URL to find all
the other resources at your site. You should also register the URLs of the
top-level pages that cannot be reached from your home page.
The material that follows is designed as a quick reference resource that
you can use time and again. The idea is to provide only the information
you need. With this in mind, the sections are organized alphabetically
based on the name of the search engine. You’ll also find the URL to the
main page and the relevant registration page (if available). If you find that
the URL for the registration page is no longer valid, go to the main page
and follow the submission link to the appropriate page. Usually, the sub-
mission link is labeled “Add URL,” “Add a Page,” or something similar.
Keep in mind that these are general search engines, not specialized or category-specific
search engines. In upcoming sections, you will learn how to increase your traffic using
other types of search engines. Note also that there are many popular alternatives to
search engines, such as directories and guides, which are discussed later in the book 
as well.

Metasearch Engines
In recent years, a new type of Internet search Web site has emerged called
a metasearch engine. A metasearch engine doesn’t crawl the Internet
looking for content to maintain its own database. Instead, metasearch
engines retrieve search results by passing search queries on to a number of
search engines and directories and correlating the results returned from
each source into a single, combined results listing.
Figure 2.21
Netscape’s search
results include its
own paid listings
combined with

retrieved from
Google.

Metasearch engines are generally best used when performing general
searches because they return a broad set of results from different sources.
Web surfers like metasearch engines because they can save time when
looking for information.
The Mechanics Going on Behind the Scenes
Metasearch engines collect user queries and format them as appropriate
for various search engines and directories. After submitting a query, the
metasearch engine collects results from each source in a virtual database,
from which it then removes duplicate results. Some metasearch engines
display their results in one consolidated list while other metasearch
engines display results by category or by source. Regardless of how a
metasearch engine chooses to display its results, the results are ultimately
sorted according to relevance.
Dogpile, Mamma, and Other Sites
Like search engines, not all metasearch engines are equal, some being
more popular than others. In this section, you will find information
about some of the most commonly used search engines.
Metasearch engines do not maintain their own databases. Therefore, they
are not able to accept free URL submissions. However, most offer paid
listings. To help ensure that your Web site is listed in the results returned
by a metasearch engine, make sure that you get listed with at least one of
the search engines or directories from which it retrieves results.
Dogpile
Dogpile (www.dogpile.com), shown in Figure 2.22, sends queries to a
number of search engines and directories, including Google, Yahoo!,
Bing, and Ask. The results returned from these sources are displayed in a
single list according to relevancy. The name of the search engine or direc-
tory from which results were retrieved is also listed.

vancy, along with the name of the search engines and directories from
which results originated. Mamma offers paid listings, which you can

Targeting Shoppers Using Comparison
Shopping Engines and Directories
Today more and more people are using the Internet not just to find infor-
mation or for personal amusement but for shopping. While there is no
doubt that the majority of surfers on the Internet use the major search
engines to find what they are looking for, a growing number of online
shoppers are turning to a new type of specialized search engine, designed
explicitly to assist shoppers find the best deal for their money. These new
search engines retrieve product and pricing information from numerous
vendors, allowing for product comparisons.
The comparison shopping engines or CSEs are focused exclusively on mer-
chandising. The focus is on the sale of products. As a result, online shoppers
only get what they are looking for, something to buy. If you have a product
that you are selling from your Web site, comparison shopping engines
may be exactly the tool you need to bring the people to your Web site.

Unlike regular search engines, you have a great deal of control over how
the comparison shopping engines display the information retrieved from
your Web pages. You can generally specify what you want presented and
how it is displayed. Traditional search engines do not provide anything like
this. Comparison shopping engines provide a lot of information besides
just product names and prices. They typically provide detailed product
descriptions, photos, product reviews, and tax and shipping information.
In order to get listed with a comparison shopping engine, your site must
meet certain criteria. For starters, you’ll need a shopping cart. If you do
not have one, some comparison shopping engines, such as Google
Product Search, will be happy to provide you with one. In addition, you
must post the prices for all of the products that you are selling. If your
Web site meets these basic criteria, it is a candidate for inclusion.
There are dozens of comparison shopping engines. However, just as with
regular search engines, not all are equal. You’ll get the best value out of
your time and effort if you target the comparison shopping engines that
people use most. Not all comparison search engines are the same. Some
are free and others are not. Some charge an initial set up fee while others
do not. Some make you pay based on the number of times visitors click
on your links while others charge you based on a percentage of sales.
Comparison Shopping Engines
The following sections introduce you to a number of popular comparison
shopping engines. The first two comparison shopping engines, Google
Product Search and PriceScan, both accept free submissions. The remain-
ing comparison shopping engines will charge you for their services. In
addition, you’ll be introduced to a number of comparison shopping
directories as well, each of which accepts free submissions.
Google Product Search
Google Product Search, formally named Froogle, is a free shopping search
engine located at www.google.com/products, as shown in Figure 2.24.
76

Google also uses Web sites registered with Google Product Search as a
feed for its regular search engine results.
To register with Google Product Search you will have to sign up for a free
Google account and for Google’s merchant services, which is also free. If
your Web site does not have the ability to make online sales, you can take
advantage of Google’s Checkout feature, which allows you to accept and
process credit card sales for a low fee (2% of sales or 2 cents per transaction,
as of the publishing of this book). To learn more about Google Product
Search and to set up your Web site, visit http://www.google.com/base/
help/sellongoogle.html.
PriceScan
PriceScan (www.priceScan.com), shown in Figure 2.25, is another com-
parison shopping search engine that does not charge merchants for listings.

PriceScan makes its money through the sale of online advertising. In order
to get your products listed on PriceScan, you must post your products
online and have your own shopping card and payment system. PriceScan
does not provide these services for you. To register with PriceScan, send
an e-mail to vendors@pricescan.com.
Other Comparison Shopping Engines
There are dozens of comparison shopping engines available on the Inter-
net, a number of which are identified in the following list. Each of these
comparison search engines involves some sort of set up fee or ongoing
expense. Still, inclusion in their database can result in bringing masses of
visitors to your Web sites, and since the people that will be brought in are
looking for the types of products you sell, chances of making sales and
generating return customers are very good.

Comparison Shopping Directories
In addition to comparison shopping engines, there are a number of com-
parison shopping directories available on the Internet. Some accept free
listings and others do not. As with comparison shopping engines, compar-
ison shopping directories require that you have a shopping cart in place and
that you post your prices online. ShoppingSpot (www.shoppingspot.com),
shown in Figure 2.26, is a small but growing comparison shopping direc-
tory that accepts free product listings. You can register your Web site and

Submitting Your Web Site to the Top Guides,
Lists, and Directories
The phenomenal popularity of resource directories such as Open Directory
ushered in a whole new era of guides, lists, and directories designed to
help people find things on the Web. Whereas the focus of Web guides is
usually on the top or best sites, lists and directories focus on categorizing
information found on the Web.
Just as hundreds of search engines are available, you can find hundreds of
guides, lists, and directories on the Web as well. Unfortunately, trying to
submit your site to every guide, list, and directory is a waste of your time
and resources. Instead, you should focus on the top resources you find in
this section.
Submitting Your Site to Lists and Directories
Guides, lists, and directories are all terms used to describe Web resources
that provide links to Web pages. Web guides usually provide pointers to
the best or top sites. Think of a guide as something you might buy at the
bookstore to help you learn about a country you are visiting. Lists are
exactly what the name implies: Lists of Web sites that are usually organ-
ized into several major categories. Think of a list as something you might
put together before you go grocery shopping. Beyond lists, you will find
directories, which usually have rather extensive listings of Web sites
divided into many categories. When you think of a directory, think of the
Yellow Pages directory, that huge yellow tome that lists tons of businesses.
Although size is usually the major factor that distinguishes a list from a
directory, don’t get hung up on the terminology. Generally speaking, lists
and directories serve the same purpose and often the terms are used inter-
changeably.
Web site listings in guides and directories are very different from the
results returned by a typical search engine. Guides and directories do not
index your Web pages at all; they simply use the information you provide
to create a listing for your Web site.
80
Increase Your Web Traffic In a Weekend, Sixth Edition

When you submit your Web site to a list or directory, you submit the
URL for your home page or other top-level pages at your site. Along with
the page URL, you usually are asked to submit the Web page title, a brief
description of the Web page, and a specific category for the Web page.
The Web page category should always be tailored to the specific directory
to which you are submitting your page. Some directory sites have hun-
dreds of narrowly focused categories, such as entertainment news for kids
and computer book reviews. Other directory sites have only a few broadly
focused categories such as entertainment and travel.
Most directory sites screen all new submissions rigorously. If the same
page has been submitted previously, the site usually disregards the sub-
mission. The site might also disregard the submission if the page was sub-
mitted to the wrong category.
Rather than place your listing in a category that you think is popular, you
should place your listing in a category that strongly relates to the topic your
site covers. Placing your site in a category that fits your content ensures
that readers who are looking for a site like yours will be able to find it.
Trying to submit the same Web page to multiple categories will usually
get you in trouble. Rather than submit the same Web page to multiple
categories, examine the type of content that you publish to see whether
different areas of your Web site fall into different categories. For example,
you could list your home page in one category, your writing area in
another category, and your job center in yet another category. Whenever
possible, list each of the major areas of your Web site separately in direc-
tories. This gives your Web site a better chance of getting noticed. And
the more your Web site is noticed, the more your Web traffic will increase.
The Open Directory and Yahoo!
On the Internet, a directory is a human-edited collection of information
about Web sites. People all over the world regularly visit the major Web
directories to look for information regarding specific subjects. This makes
getting listed in a Web directory very important to any Web site publisher.
SATURDAY MORNING  Putting the Motion in Promotion
81

Being listed in the major Web directories is even more important because
just being listed in them is often all that it takes for your site to eventu-
ally get noticed by and then indexed by some major search engines.
While there are many Web directories out there, two are particularly well
known and popular, the Open Directory and Yahoo!’s directory. As a
result, they merit a little extra attention.
The Open Directory is the only major directory that is and always has been
100 percent free. Some directories only accept paid inclusion, whereas
many others offer both free and paid inclusion. A global community of
volunteer editors manages the Open Directory. One of the reasons that
getting listed in the Open Directory is so important is because results
from the Open Directory are retrieved by numerous search engines on
the Internet, including Google, Netscape, and AOL. In addition, many
search engines provide direct access to the Open Directory. For example,
Google provides access to the open directory at directory.google.com.
Yahoo! is one of the Internet’s largest search engines. Yahoo! also main-
tains its own directory (search.yahoo.com/dir). Yahoo! provides for free
registration for non-commercial submission. Like the Open Directory,
Yahoo!’s directory serves as a feed for numerous search engines, making it
all the more attractive.
Before you run out and start registering with the various directories, it’s best to do a little
preparation. For starters, prepare a well written description of your Web site that is around
25 words long and be sure to include at least a few of your keywords or keyword phrases.
Submitting Your Site to Web Guides
The focus on the top or best sites puts Web guides in a league of their
own. When you submit your site to a guide, you are betting that the
guide’s reviewers will find your site useful, informative, or well presented.
82
Increase Your Web Traffic In a Weekend, Sixth Edition
TIP

If the guide’s reviewers count your site among the best, they will write a
review of your site, and your site will show up in their database of the Web’s
top sites. If your guide’s reviewers don’t like your site for whatever reason,
they will move on to the next site in their long list of sites to review.
Contrary to what you might think, the Web sites with the fancy graphics
and multimedia don’t always have the best ratings. In fact, some of the
highest rated Web sites have mostly text.
You can improve your odds of getting your site reviewed by taking the
time to learn what the guide looks for and what the guide’s reviews look
like. When you have gained a clear understanding of how the guide
works, submit your site with descriptive information that will catch the
eyes of the reviewers. Along with the summary information, you might
want to include a rating for your Web site. If this rating is realistic, you
might give the reviewer a reason to visit your Web site.
Another way to improve your odds with Web guides is to focus on the
top-level areas of your Web site. For example, if your primary Web site
publishes two key resources, Writers Gallery and Internet Job Center, you
could submit entries for both of these areas rather than the Web site as a
whole. The reason for this is that these areas have very different focuses—
creative writing and jobs—and can’t be realistically rated in the same
review.
As a final note, remember that reviewers are real people. With thousands
of Web sites to review, several weeks or even a month could elapse before
a reviewer gets a chance to look at your Web site. If reviewers don’t review
your site, there isn’t much point in inundating them with e-mail or
repeated submissions. Instead, wait a few months and then try again.
How Do People Find Your Listing in a Guide
or Directory?
Most guides and directories can be searched in two ways: by category or
by keyword.
SATURDAY MORNING  Putting the Motion in Promotion
83

When you search by category, you follow links from a broad category to
a progressively more focused category. In a category search, the categories
themselves are the main elements driving users to your listing. Yet when
users finally get to the detailed page that shows your listing, it is the page
title and summary description that will influence their decision to visit
your Web site.
A keyword search in a guide or directory is handled in a very different
manner. Rather than follow links, you use a search interface to find cate-
gories and lists within the guide. If the keywords you enter lead to several
categories, you see category headers. If the keywords you enter lead to a
specific listing, you see either the listing itself or the page of which the
listing is part.
How Often Is Your Site’s Listing Updated?
Unlike search engines that periodically schedule your site for reindexing,
most guides and directories rarely update their listings. The problem with
updating listings is a logistical one. To update a list in a Web guide, a
reviewer needs to take another look at the Web site. To update a listing in
a directory, the directory site needs to have someone check the validity of
the link and the description. Both actions require time and resources that
could be directed at new listings.
Don’t rely on someone from the guide or directory site to update your
listing in six months or a year; take a proactive stance instead. If you move
the furniture around a bit and add a new edition to your Web home,
inform the folks who run the guide or directory site. Generally, you
should send a message to the people who maintain the directory or guide.
The key things to tell them are what the old information looked like and
what the new information should look like.

Increasing Your Web Traffic with Guides and
Directories
Getting your Web site listed in a popular guide or directory will definitely
increase the traffic to your site. As with search engines, you will find that
you get the most out of your time investment when you submit your site
to the top guides and directories, which is why this session focuses on the
best guides and directories.
Although you know that a Web page or area within your Web site will be
listed in the directory, there is no assurance that you will get listed in a
Web guide. Still, submitting your site to the guides listed in this section
is worthwhile, especially when you consider that getting your site listed
in any one of these guides could bring thousands of visitors to your Web
site every single day. For many Web sites, an extra thousand visitors a day
would effectively double or triple the site’s traffic. Doubling or tripling
your Web traffic from a single listing might seem like a pipe dream, but
the reality is that people often seek out the best that the Web has to offer.
After all, do you settle for bronze, when silver, gold, and platinum are
waiting in the wings?
You should submit your Web site to the featured guides and directories.
As discussed earlier, directories often ask for detailed information, which
can include page URL, page title, keywords, description, contact infor-
mation, and categories/topics. Before you submit your listing, you should
have this information plotted out.

Offline Marketing
Getting the most out of your marketing campaign also means going
beyond the confines of the cyber world into the real world. As addictive
as the Internet can be, people spend a lot more time moving about and
interacting in the real world than they do online. So, to get to these people
where they live, work, and play, you need to expand your promotional
efforts.
Promoting Your URL Everywhere
You need to get the word out that you have created one of the Web’s best
and most useful sites. One of the best ways of accomplishing this goal is
to get your URL out there for everyone to see. For starters, tell your
friends and ask them to tell their friends. Tell your co-workers as well. If
you are part of a sports club or social club, do your associates a favor and
clue them in on the great Web site you have created. After all, if you don’t
spread the word, who will?
Updating Your Business Cards
If you use them, one of the easiest things that you can do to spread the
word about your Web site is to add your URL to your business cards. The
inclusion of your URL does not have to be anything fancy, just list it at
the bottom of your card beneath your phone number and e-mail address
and people will pick up on it easily enough.
Don’t be like so many people that order a box of 250 business cards and
a year later are still in possession of 240 of the cards. You took the time
to design your card and have paid for it, now take advantage of them and
pass them around. This doesn’t mean standing out on the street corner
and giving them away to complete strangers. Rather, anytime you are
around people that you believe might be interested in your Web site, tell
them about it and give them a copy of your card. Then ask them to visit
and to provide you with their feedback. Many people like to be asked for
their thoughts because it tells them that you value their opinion. 
90
Increase Your Web Traffic In a Weekend, Sixth Edition

Modifying Your Letterhead
Never send out a personal letter or correspondence without writing it on
your own letterhead, and make sure your letterhead includes your URL.
This will not only let people know you have a Web site but it also gives
you the chance to suggest they visit. For example, if your letter involves
something related to what is on your Web site, you can reference your
Web site as a place to go to get more information. Since most people
know that Web sites generally provide information about contact site
owners, including your URL on your Web site gives the recipient another
means of getting in touch with you.
Integrating Offline Advertising
If you are currently involved in promoting your products or services
offline, start including your Web site’s URL in your promotional efforts.
If you occasionally post fliers, start adding your URL to them. If you
display information about your company on the side of your automobile,
add your URL and turn your car, truck, or SUV into a rolling billboard
that promotes your Web site. If you do radio, television, or newspaper
advertising, don’t forget to plug your URL every chance you get. Be cre-
ative in looking for different ways to integrate the promotion of your
Web site with your offline advertising.
If you are running a contest on your Web site or giving something away, you
might want to focus on promoting the contest or giveaway instead of your
Web site. This lets you plug your Web site without actually plugging it.
Promoting Your URL Alongside Your 
Products and Services
If you sell anything, be it a product or a service, you should use a sale 
as an opportunity to plug your Web site. For example, if you have ever 
purchased a book from Amazon.com, you’ve probably noticed that when
your book arrives, the book always includes one or more promotional
fliers. You should do the same thing. Encourage your customers to learn
more about whatever it is that you do from your Web site.
SATURDAY MORNING  Putting the Motion in Promotion
91

Put your URL on the package, on the invoice, and in any promotional
materials that you include. If you provide services instead of a product,
make sure that you leave a copy of your business card behind whenever
you come into contact with your customers and include your URL on
any invoices and receipts.
Wrapping Up and Looking Ahead
Millions of people use search engines to find information every day, and
one of the best ways to build traffic to your Web site is to register with
search engines. Guides, lists, and directories can also help your Web site
get noticed. Keep in mind, you aren’t guaranteed a listing in a guide to
the best of the Web. Still, your time is well spent if you manage to garner
one or more such listings for your site.
This afternoon, you’ll examine many different types of search engines and
Web directories. You’ll learn about the best directories and search engines
for business-oriented Web sites, industry- and category-specific directories,
getting more mileage from What’s New? directories, and a whole lot more.

of these sites so that you can get the most exposure for your time
investment. If you have time, make use of these resources as you learn
about them; that is, proceed with the registration process as you go through
this section. If you don’t have time to get to them all now, come back
when you do. It will be worth your while.
Later this afternoon, you’ll find out how to vie for awards that will help
your site get noticed by cyberspace travelers. Awards abound on the Web,
and your site can sizzle as Hot Site of the Day or freeze out the competi-
tion as Cool Site of the Week. Some awards are more likely to increase your
Web traffic than others, though, and this afternoon’s session introduces
you to some of the best. You will also learn how to leverage the popular-
ity of social networking sites, using them to your advantage in your Web
promotion plan.
The Best Business Search Engines 
and Yellow Pages Directories
Business search engines and Yellow Pages directories provide great
resources for anyone who offers products, services, or business-related
information on the Web. Most business-oriented search engines and
directories provide much more detailed information than other search
sites and directories. These detailed entries allow you to list your Web site
and tout your products and services as well.
95

Submitting Your Site to Business Search 
and Directory Sites
Hundreds of thousands of businesses offer products and services on the
Web. The sites that help Web users make sense of all these offerings are the
business search engines and Yellow Pages directories. Because these search
and directory sites are tailored for businesses, you can search for specific
businesses by company name, location, and industry, as well as by the
products and services that the companies offer. Although they are similar
to traditional search engines, most business search engines do not index
your Web site or the pages that you submit for listing at the search site.
Instead, these search engines create an indexed reference to your site based
solely on the information you submit, which doesn’t necessarily include
the URL to your Web site. In this respect, this type of business search
engine is more like a directory listing than a traditional search engine.
Because business search engines don’t actually index your site, many busi-
ness search sites are called Yellow Pages directories. Although some Yellow
Pages directories are modeled after the Yellow Pages of your phone book,
most Web-based Yellow Pages directories have features of both traditional
directory sites and traditional search engine sites.
Due to their very direct focus, business search sites and directories often
want a great deal of information from anyone registering with the site.
For this reason, before you register with these sites, you should have all
the following information at hand:

What subject category you want to be listed under

How you want company contact information to read

Who you will list as the contact name at the company

What keywords you want associated with your site

What Web pages’ URLs you want listed

What e-mail address you want to use for inquiries

What description you will use for your company, products, and
services
96
Increase Your Web Traffic In a Weekend, Sixth Edition

You should also know that, by their very nature, business search sites and
directories are out to make a profit. The worst of these sites exist only to
push paid services on unwitting souls who want to get listed at the site.
However, there is no need to sign up for anything that will cost you money.
Plenty of sites are happy just to have your listing and will list you without
charge. These sites get their money from advertising rather than listings.
Increasing Your Web Traffic with Yellow Pages
Directories
Just as the top search engines and directories receive millions of visitors
every day, so do the top Yellow Pages directories. Accordingly, registering
your Web site with Yellow Pages directories will increase the traffic to
your Web site. That said, Yellow Pages directories generally don’t drive
thousands of visitors to a particular Web site; rather, you can reasonably
expect relatively modest increases in your Web traffic over time.
The traffic depends, of course, on the types of products and services you
offer. Right now you might be wondering if it’s really worth the effort.
The answer is yes—as long as you focus your efforts on the top Yellow
Pages directories listed in this section.
Although Yellow Pages directories are popular and receive millions of vis-
itors every day, they are business oriented. Visitors to these directories are
usually looking for very specific types of information (for example, infor-
mation on a management consulting service). Furthermore, because Yellow
Pages listings contain addresses, phone numbers, and other contact infor-
mation, people visiting the Yellow Pages directory might not visit your Web
site at all. Instead, they might visit your physical storefront or contact you
by phone, fax, or e-mail.
Whether visitors to a Yellow Pages directory go to your storefront, contact
you, or visit your Web site, you have managed to bring in the all-important
consumers who are actively looking for a business that offers products or
services like yours. With a listing in a traditional search engine or directory
site, you simply cannot bring in this type of visitor on a consistent basis.

Directories by Industry and Category
The major search engines and directories are great for getting your Web
site noticed by the masses, but you also want your site to be accessible to
people looking for specific types of information. This is where industry-
and category-specific directories come into the picture. Whether your site
covers fine dining in Seattle, outdoor sports activities in Australia, or one
of thousands of other topics, there are directories devoted to your subject.
This section will show you how to find and use them.

Some of these directories have a fairly narrow focus. Be sure to read through the
detailed descriptions before you submit a listing.
Getting the Most Out of Industry and 
Category Directories
Whereas industry directories focus on major industries, such as real estate
or travel, category directories focus on specific topics, such as resources
for writers or outdoor sports. People looking for specialized or tailored
information seek out industry and category directories. This makes these
directories the perfect place for your Web site to get noticed.
As with most directories, industry and category directories focus on pages
rather than entire Web sites. Thus you generally submit the URL of a spe-
cific page or area that strongly relates to the topic of the directory. Along
with the URL, you usually submit the page title and a summary descrip-
tion. Although the description of your page might not be published with
your listing, the directory maintainer uses the description to determine
whether the page is appropriate for the directory.
Because industry and category directories have a very specific focus, they
are great for increasing the traffic to your Web site. In a way, getting listed
in these directories is like conducting an advertising campaign that targets
readers who are interested in the exact type of Web site you publish.
Before you submit your Web site to industry or category directories, you
should take a few minutes to plot out the industries or categories that fit
your Web site. Although the first industry or category you think of is
probably the best, a typical Web site will fit into several categories or
industries. Your collection of articles on Spain would probably fit in per-
fectly with a travel or tourism directory. But you could also look for
metro or city guides that cover Spain. Additionally, your articles might
cover the best restaurants in Madrid, making these pages suitable for a
listing in a directory to restaurants, fine dining, or food.

Community Guides
Community guides are becoming increasingly popular. By focusing a
directory on a specific city, state, or country, users can find information
directly relating to an area of the world in which they are interested. If
you want to find an Italian restaurant in Denver, you access a city guide
featuring Denver. If you want to find a Web design firm in the Seattle
area, you access a guide to the Seattle metropolitan area.
Every single Web site in cyberspace has a place in a community guide.
After all, we all live somewhere. For this reason, you should register your
site in a directory that covers your metro area, state, or country.
Unfortunately, only a few community guides actually let you submit list-
ings. This section will highlight a number of excellent guides that accept
submissions.
Creating a Listing in EscapeArtist
EscapeArtist (www.escapeartist.com) is a different kind of community
guide. Instead of focusing on a particular city or state, EscapeArtist offers
guides to a particular country or region.
EscapeArtist has hundreds of country- and region-specific guides. The
easiest way to access these guides is to visit the main site and then follow
the links to the guide with which you want to work. As shown in Figure
3.6, much of what you’ll find at EscapeArtist is about travel and living in
different countries.
To submit a listing to EscapeArtist, visit the guide for the appropriate cat-
egory and click on the Add URL link at the bottom of the page. Provide
the required information and submit the form. There is a $5 charge for
new registrations.

Yahoo! Country and Metro Guides
Millions of people are lost in the endless sea of the Web. They are looking
for tailored information they can access easily and quickly, which is
exactly what city guides provide. The growing trend to tailor information
based on geographic boundaries is clearly evident when you visit the
major search sites. Many of the major search engine sites have a city or
metro guide. Yahoo! is no exception.
Yahoo! has set up separate areas for major metros and countries through-
out the world. The Web site for Yahoo! Seattle (seattle.yahoo.com) is
shown in Figure 3.8. If you want to register your Washington-based busi-
ness or Web site in the Seattle metro guide, visit Yahoo! Seattle and go
through the same submission process that you would for the main Yahoo!
Directory. If you want to register your Web site in any other Yahoo! city
guide, visit the city guide and go through its submission process as well.

Real Estate Directories and Guides
When you think of real estate, you probably think of real estate agents
and brokers. Although agents and brokers are the cornerstones of real
estate, the real estate industry encompasses many other professions and
organizations. At one end of the spectrum are the construction companies,
developers, engineers, planners, workers, and service organizations whose
efforts create the homes in which we live and the office buildings in which
we work. At the other end of the spectrum are the property managers,
asset managers, trust companies, and holding companies that manage the
construction and the properties. In between are the financial institutions,
the appraisers, the investors, and the property owners who make the con-
struction possible.
With dozens of professions and organizations that make up the real estate
industry, it is no surprise that this industry has a dominant presence in
cyberspace. In fact, real estate directories are some of the best designed
sites you’ll find online. If your Web site or business covers any of the pro-
fessions or organizations related to the real estate industry, you should
add a listing to the directories in this section. Further, if you publish any
information that relates to the real estate industry, you should consider
adding a listing in the real estate directories as well.
Getting Listed at REALTOR.org
REALTOR.org (www.realtor.org), shown in Figure 3.9, is a real estate
directory published by the National Association of Realtors. The direc-
tory covers many different aspects of the real estate industry. You’ll find
listings of real estate companies, retailers, products, and services. You’ll
also find listings of associations that are related to the industry.
REALTOR.org focuses on the U.S. real estate industry. It provides a
built-in search capability for searching for real estate agents and offices. If
your Web site has something to do with the real estate industry, you
should consider registering with REALTOR.org.

Getting Listed in Estates Today
Estates Today (www.estatestoday.co.uk/i_site.html), shown in Figure
3.10, is a terrific directory for the commercial real estate industry. Its
primary focus is on real estate services for the UK and Europe. Unlike
some real estate directories that focus only on providing listings to com-
panies, agencies, and brokers, Estates Today provides specific Internet
services to the commercial real estate industry. In addition, it maintains a
directory named CityOffices.
The CityOffices directory provides links to information about commer-
cial properties and is organized by major cities in the UK and Europe.
Before you submit a listing to Estates Today, you should determine which
directory best fits your Web site or company. Then submit an e-mail
message to the e-mail address listed on the Web site’s Contact Us page.
The message should provide your company Web site title and the cate-
gory in which you want your site listed.

Other Real Estate Directories
In addition to the real estate directories already discussed, many other real
estate directories also exist. Some of the others you might want to con-
sider include the Real Estate Cyberspace Society, Open House America,
and Real-Estate-Agents.
The Real Estate Cyberspace Society (www.recyber.com) provides services
for real estate professionals. You can become a member of the Real Estate
Cyberspace Society by clicking on the SponsorLink link at the bottom of
the page and then selecting the type of program you are interested in.
Real-Estate-Agents (real-estate-agents.com) maintains a comprehensive
directory of commercial and residential real estate agents. Real estate
agents can submit free listings by visiting the appropriate area within the
directory and clicking on the Add Your Agency link.

Travel and Tourism: Guides and Directories
The travel industry covers many different professions and organizations.
There are travel agents to book tickets and airlines, and cruise lines, train
companies, and bus companies to provide transportation. Hotels offer a
place to stay, and car rental agencies give you flexible mobility. Recreation
and amusement businesses provide entertainment.
Because travel and tourism is a big business, the industry is well represented
online. As with the real estate industry, many high-profile travel directo-
ries can help you build traffic to your Web site. If your Web site covers
any of the professions or organizations related to the travel industry, you
should consider adding a listing to the directories in this section. If you
publish any information that relates to travel and tourism, you should
consider adding a listing in the travel directories as well.
Getting Listed in HotelsTravel
HotelsTravel (www.hotelstravel.com) is an international directory for
the travel and tourism industry. This comprehensive directory contains
hundreds of thousands of listings.
You can search HotelsTravel by keyword or by following links to specific
categories of information. Categories within the directory include hotels,
airlines, airports, travel-related products, travel-related services, and travel
references. Most of the major hotel chains have areas within the site as
well.
Entries in HotelsTravel cluster around hotels, airports, and airlines.
Figure 3.11 shows listings for hotels whose locations are identified graph-
ically on a map of the Tampa area. 
If your site features travel-related information, you can add a listing to
HotelsTravel for a fee of $99. The URL for this page is www.hotelstravel.com/
addsite.html. Fill out only the information that pertains to your Web
site. If you are submitting a travel-related site, be sure to specify the city
or country that your site services.

Other Travel and Tourism Directories
After you submit listings to HotelsTravel, you might want to try other
travel directories as well. After all, you want to build traffic to your travel-
related Web site, and the best way to do this is to spread the word about
your Web site through the key directories for the travel industry. Some of
the other travel directories to which you might want to submit your site
include WorldWeb and TravelHub.
WorldWeb (www.usa.worldweb.com) provides a search interface to
thousands of hotel listings. To submit a listing to this site, click on the
Add a Business link at the bottom of the page and provide the required
information.
TravelHub (www.travelhub.com) is a directory of travel agencies. If you
are a travel agent, TravelHub provides a number of free services that can
help you build traffic and boost your company’s bottom line. To find out

More Guides and Directories by Category
Company-specific guides and directories are great ways to get your site
noticed. The usefulness of category guides is apparent when you want to
find specific types of information without having to wade through search
engine results. Because category guides are so useful, they are also extremely
popular. The Web contains thousands of category-specific guides covering
every imaginable topic. If you are looking for a very specific category
guide, one of the best places to find it is Yahoo! (dir.yahoo.com/Business_
and_Economy/Directories/Companies/), shown in Figure 3.12.
Before you go on to the next part in this section, look for additional
directories that relate to topics or industries discussed at your site. Rather
than try to submit your site in dozens of categories, focus on the top
three. After you’ve identified these categories, submit your site to the best
directories related to them.

Children’s Directories: Getting Noticed 
by One of the Web’s Biggest Audiences
The Internet is as popular with young people as it is with adults. If your
Web site in any way caters to children, then you ought to take advantage
of the major kids’ directories. These directories are different from other
Web directories in that their content is filtered to weed out potentially
objectionable sites. Their primary focus is to provide kids with a safe but
still fun and interesting experience.
Unlike search engines, which provide tools that parents can use to
attempt to block out objectionable material, kids directories are much
safer places. One of the best known of the kids’ directories is Yahoo! Kids
(kids.yahoo.com), as shown in Figure 3.13.
Just like the regular Yahoo! Directory, Yahoo! Kids organizes everything
into major high-level categories, which kids can drill down into to find
Web sites with specific information. You can submit your Web site to
Yahoo! Kids by clicking on the Suggest a Site link located at the bottom
of the main page. You’ll be asked to pick a category and then to supply a
title, URL, and a 25 or less word description of your Web site.
There are a number of other online directories dedicated exclusively to
kids that you might want to investigate further. These sites include:

AskKids—www.askkids.com

KidsClick!—www.kidsclick.org

Dibdabdoo—www.dibdabdoo.com

Getting More Mileage out of What’s New?
Directories
Announcement sites are an effort to capture the euphoria surrounding
the exponential growth of the Web, and simultaneously tap into the usual
excitement over things that are new and fresh. One of the first What’s
New? directories was maintained by NCSA (National Center for Super-
computing Applications)—the same folks who gave the world the Mosaic
browser. At its peak, the list received thousands of submissions for new
Web sites every day. Today, it is no longer updated. However, many other
sites publish extensive What’s New? directories. When you visit the major
What’s New? directories, you will find that these Web sites are tremen-
dously popular.
This popularity will help drive visitors to your Web site. What’s New?
directories are organized much like other directories, with specific broad

directories.

categories, such as business and entertainment. Listings within a specific
category are usually arranged alphabetically by title and often chronolog-
ically as well.
By nature, What’s New? lists are guides to new sites. Still, if you’ve never
submitted your site to a specific list before, your site is new to the list and
therefore you can certainly submit a listing.
When you register with What’s New? directories, you will generally see
short-term increases in your Web traffic. The reason for this is that your
site usually will be featured in the What’s New? directory for only one or
two days. Afterward, your listing will appear only in the site’s archive
files—provided that the site has archive files. If you are interested in
short-term increases in Web traffic, What’s New? directories are definitely
for you. Considering that people often bookmark sites they like, a listing
in a What’s New? directory can provide a modest increase in traffic over
the long haul as well.
Exploring the Starting Point Directory
Starting Point (www.stpt.com) is a directory service that has reinvented
itself several times over the years. Whereas Starting Point once strove to
become a major directory à la Yahoo!, the service now focuses on provid-
ing a guide to the best Web sites. Despite the change of focus, Starting
Point still maintains one of the top guides to new sites. The Starting Point
What’s New? list is organized into 16 categories that range from business
to health and fitness.
Within each category, listings are organized chronologically, with the
most recent listings displayed first. Because Starting Point receives so
many submissions, the directory displays only the most recent listings.
Figure 3.14 shows a partial directory listing at Starting Point. To get the
most out of your listing, be sure to select a category that fits your Web
site. You should also provide a descriptive title and a clear summary for
the listing.
SATURDAY AFTERNOON  The Coolest, the Hottest, and the Best

Starting Point charges a $99 fee. You can submit your site to Starting Point
by clicking on the Add a Site link located on the Web site’s main page.
Other What’s New? Directories
Finding the new and the interesting is what announcement directories are
all about. Two additional What’s New? directories for you to consider are
Yahoo!’s What’s New? area and the New Web Directory. Yahoo!’s What’s
New? area (dir.yahoo.com/new) lists new Web sites that are added to
Yahoo!’s Directory. Listings are organized into groups, as shown in Figure
3.15. To submit your Web site, click on the Suggest a Site link at the 
top of the page. To see if your site has been listed in the What’s New? 
area, drill down into the category for which you submitted your Web site.
If it is not there yet, come back later. Yahoo! always has a backlog of 
submissions.

Getting Your Site Listed as the Cool Site 
of the Day
One of the most famous awards on the Web is the Cool Site of the Day
award. Getting named the Cool Site of the Day is an accomplishment
that gets your Web site noticed. But the Cool Site of the Day award is
only the icing on the cake as far as awards go. There are dozens of other
awards that range from the fleeting to the everlasting. Making sense of all
these awards and finding the ones that truly make a difference is what this
section is all about.

Increase Your Web Traffic In a Weekend, Sixth Edition
Nothing makes your Web site stand out from the crowd like an award.
Awards are stamps of approval that tell the masses your site is worth their
time. Not just any old award will do, though. The Web has more than a
thousand different types of site awards. These awards range from some-
body’s individual Web site’s Cool Site of the Day award to PC Magazine’s
annual Top 100 Web sites list. Bunches of small awards might do
wonders for your ego but the actual awards themselves may do very little
for your Web site’s traffic. On the other hand, an award like making it
onto PC Magazine’s Top 100 list can dramatically increase traffic to your
Web site.
Wandering in the Maze of Web Awards
Awards can work miracles when it comes to building traffic to your Web
site, but they can also be mere self-serving trophies that you place in a glass
case to brag about your achievements. The simple truth is that displaying
your awards prominently doesn’t build traffic to your Web site, no matter
what the sites granting the awards want you to think.
When your Web site wins an award, you are usually required to display an icon repre-
senting the award somewhere on your Web site. This icon contains a link to the Web site
that granted you the award. You might want to consider placing the icon for the award
somewhere other than your main Web page because the icon is, after all, a link away from
your Web site. If your Web site wins multiple awards, why not create an awards page? 
The number of awards doesn’t matter, either. You could have hundreds of
small awards and it wouldn’t make much of a difference as far as your
Web site’s traffic is concerned. The reality is that these days it seems every-
one is offering a Web award of some type or another. There are dozens of
variations of Cool Site of the Day awards. These awards are for Cool Site
of the Moment, Cool Site of the Hour, Cool Site of the Week, Cool Site of
the Month, and Cool Site of the Year as well. Beyond the cool site awards,
there are the Hot Site of the Day, Hour, Week, Month, and Year awards.
TIP

Next comes the Crazy Site of the Day, Hour, Week, Month, and Year
awards. There are so many awards that Web neophytes have started offer-
ing backward awards, such as the Mediocre Site of the Day, Ugly Site of
the Day, and the Bottom 95 Percent of the Web.
Another way to get your Web site noticed is to create your own award. That way, the
more sites that you give your award to, the more links there will be pointing back to your
Web site and the higher your Web site’s ranking will become. However, creating and
managing an awards site is a lot of work. You have to come up with formal criteria for
judging Web sites and add supporting Web pages to your Web site to manage the award
process. In addition, you have to be prepared to handle all of the entries that you may
receive. In the event that the entries don’t measure up, you may need to be prepared to
set aside time to go surfing and looking for sites that you can offer the award to. 
If displaying your awards or the number of awards doesn’t matter, you are
probably wondering what does matter. Well, the true equalizers are the
underlying meaning of the award and the strength of the award giver’s
announcement medium. When an organization, such as PC Magazine,
recognizes your Web site as one of the Top 100 of the year, you can expect
your traffic to skyrocket. Again, the reason for this isn’t so much the
award itself as the significance of the award and the channels through
which it is announced. 
PC Magazine is well respected in the industry. The Top 100 of the Year
award (http://www.pcmag.com/top-web-sites-2010/) is bestowed upon
sites only after thorough research and extensive review. The list of recipi-
ents of the Top 100 is published in PC Magazine, which has several
million readers. After publishing the list in its print edition, PC Magazine
publishes the list in its online edition (see Figure 3.16), where it is avail-
able to the Web community throughout the year. The longevity of the
print edition coupled with the continued traffic to PC Magazine’s Web
site and Top 100 list itself are what drives traffic to the Web sites of the
recipients.

NOTE

Finding the Right Award
The right award can make all the difference in the world when it comes
to increasing traffic to your Web site. To find the right award, you really
need to visit the home of the organization or person granting the award.
When you get to the Web site, spend some time reviewing the site and
the techniques used to display awards.
Ideally, current awards are showcased at the site for at least a day and then
later put into an archive that can be searched. Because the popularity of
the award site is also important, you should try to gauge the level of traffic
at the Web site. The busier the award site, the better the chances that it
will increase traffic to your Web site.
All this talk of finding the right award might seem strange. After all, these
sites are giving away an award! Unfortunately, with more than a thousand
120

Figure 3.16

place your Web site
in front of millions
of potential visitors.

different organizations offering awards of one type or another, you really
do need to make sure the award is meaningful and worthwhile before you
take the time to submit your Web site. Fortunately, you don’t have to look
too far; this section already identifies some of the best awards sites.
Submitting Your Site
Receiving an award depends largely upon the personal tastes of the
reviewer and the philosophy of the award site as a whole. Some award
sites look for truly cool sites based on graphic design or coverage of zany
issues. Other award sites look for great resources, with no consideration
going to whether the site uses mostly text or a cutting-edge graphic
design. Because personal opinion weighs heavily in the decision, truly
great sites are sometimes passed by.
To improve your odds of being selected, take the time to get to know the
types of sites that the reviewers prefer. If they review mostly entertain-
ment sites and you have a business-oriented site, the odds are high that
you will get passed by. So rather than submit the URL of your main busi-
ness page, submit the URL for that fun area where you let customers
interact with your products online, or highlight this area in the summary
description you supply with the submission.
You can also improve your odds of winning by submitting each of the key
areas within your Web site separately. If your site has three different areas,
you might submit each of these areas. Ideally, these areas would cover
unrelated topics, such as sports memorabilia, music singles from the ’50s,
and multi-media DVDs for the Mac. In this way, you are truly submit-
ting something different.
The adage, “If at first you don’t succeed, try, try again,” certainly applies
to awards. Don’t abuse the submission process by submitting your site
every few days or weeks, though. Instead, wait a few months before sub-
mitting your site again. In the interim, you might also want to work on
the design, flow, and content of your Web site.

Cool Site of the Day
Cool Site of the Day is one of the most popular awards. To help you make
sense of the many offerings, you will find the top Cool Site of the Day
awards in this section. These sites are the best of the best when it comes to
the Cool Site of the Day award because they follow guidelines for a good
award, discussed previously. For the most part, the awards are showcased
for at least a day. Then, because they are archived, the awards can continue
to generate traffic to your site over the long haul. The sites are also popular,
which will help to improve your chances of increasing your Web traffic.
One of the best Cool Site of the Day awards is the original award at
www.coolsiteoftheday.com. Along with the Cool Site of the Day award,
this site has many other features that make the site a great destination (see
Figure 3.17). All sites that receive the Cool Site of the Day award are
showcased on the day of the award. Afterward, they move the reference
to the Web site to an archive featuring all past awards.
You can submit your Web site by clicking on the Submit Your Site! link
at the top of the site’s main page.

will your URL get listed on www.komando.com for the day, but a nice
little introduction of your Web site will be provided as well. Be warned,
however, that after a mention on www.komando.com, some sites are
actually unable to handle the barrage of new traffic. So make sure your

Best of the Web
Many Web guides offer insights into the best sites on the Web. Two in
particular are worth taking a look at: World Best Websites and the Webby
Awards.
The World Best Websites Award
The World Best Websites award (www.worldbestwebsites.com) is pre-
sented to Web sites that implement “best practices” in their design and
communications. Particular emphasis is placed on Web sites that are on
the leading edge of design and technology. See Figure 3.19.
Sites that are submitted as candidates compete for a number of different
awards starting with Merit, and then advancing to Bronze, Silver, and
Gold. Once nominated, a Web site is visited repeatedly over a 12-week
period. 
Figure 3.19

The Webby Awards
Perhaps the most prestigious award any Web site publisher can get is a
Webby Award (www.webbyawards.com), as shown in Figure 3.21. This
award is to be taken very seriously. It is awarded to the best Web site in
60 different categories and operates very much like the Academy Awards,
including a once-a-year gala celebration event.
The Webby Awards are presented by the International Academy of
Digital Arts and Sciences in order to honor Web sites that excel in design,
functionality, usability, and creativity. Five Web sites are selected for each
category judged by the academy.

The Webby Awards is an annual event. There is a nomination period, fol-
lowed by an evaluation period. To nominate your Web site for a Webby
Award or to find out when the nomination period opens up, click on the
Enter Now link at the top of the Webby Awards main page. If nomina-
tions are not being accepted yet, you will be presented with a form that
allows you to sign up for a notification message.
Nominating your Web site for a Webby Award is not cheap. As of the
writing of the sixth edition of this book, the entry fee for a Web site was
$255. The entry fee goes down if you want to enter additional Web sites.
If you really think that your Web site is good enough to win a Webby
Award, you should seriously consider taking a chance and submit your
Web site. If you win, or even if you garner a “Webby Worthy” designa-
tion, your Web traffic could sky rocket.
Getting Social to Drive More Web Traffic
In Chapter 2 you learned all about search engine optimization. This
included learning how to formulate your Web pages to make them as
search-engine friendly as possible. In addition, you learned how to regis-
ter with many of the most popular search engines and directories on the
Web. In recent years, online social networking has grown to great promi-
nence on the Web, so much so that that Social Media Marketing, or
Social Media Optimization (SMO) as it is often referred, has become an
important component of most Web marketing campaigns. Therefore,
including social media sites as part of your Web campaign is just as
important as including search engines and directories.
Over the last several years social networking sites have grown from small
Web sites where teenagers and young adults liked to hang into global
communities made up of hundreds of millions of people of all ages and
interests. Today, social media sites are among the most frequented loca-
tions on the Web.
128
Increase Your Web Traffic In a Weekend, Sixth Edition

Social media sites are different from traditional Web sites in that visitors
are able to interact with one another and are largely responsible for the
content that is provided. This differs significantly from traditional one-
way communication that has always been the hallmark, where Web site
owners exercised total control over what was provided on their sites.
Social media sites are made possible through a new generation of Web
development and design techniques collectively referred to as Web 2.0.
Social media Web sites come in many different forms, including social
networking sites like Facebook, Twitter, and MySpace, as well as photo
and video sharing sites like Flickr and YouTube.
If you invest a little time participating in social communities, you can
develop a reputation of knowledge and expertise and ultimately drive
high-quality traffic to your Web site. Therefore, social media sites are an
important part of any good Web marketing effort. As with search engines
and directories, your time will be better spent if you focus your efforts on
the most popular social Web sites. The rest of this chapter will focus on
introducing you to the major categories of social Web sites and provide
advice and instruction on how to best go about working with them.
Participation in a social community takes time and effort, and while a lot of social sites
will be explored here, don’t think that you have to join and participate in all of them. As
you make your way through the rest of this chapter, consider which social Web sites will
work best for you. Think about which ones are most likely to put you in touch with the
people you are trying to reach and put your efforts into those sites. If, as time goes on,
you like the results you are getting and have a little extra time, you can always pick an
additional social community or two in which to participate and promote your Web site.
Social Networking Sites
The fifth edition of this book talked about how to promote Web sites
using MySpace, which at the time was a leading player in social Web sites.
SATURDAY AFTERNOON  The Coolest, the Hottest, and the Best
129
NOTE

A lot has changed over the last several years. MySpace is still a major social
network. However, it has been supplanted by Facebook in terms of overall
size and prominence. In addition, Twitter has emerged as a rival to both
of these sites and is rapidly building large communities.
Given that these three sites are among the most popular of all social net-
working sites, let’s begin with them.
Generating Traffic Using MySpace
At the time of this writing, MySpace (www.myspace.com) is the eighth
most popular Web site in the world. MySpace members intermingle by
developing networks of friends. In the process, they post and share infor-
mation using blogs, video, photos, and private messaging. Musicians were
among the first to realize the viral marketing capabilities of MySpace,
quickly finding groups of friends interested in their music. Authors,
amateur movie and video creators, and artists have all found MySpace to
be an incredibly powerful tool for sharing their work and collaborating
with others. There is no reason that you cannot leverage MySpace as a
means of putting the word out about your Web site and using it to deliver
new Web traffic made up of people interested in what you have to share
or sell.
MySpace, shown in Figure 3.22, is totally free to join, which you can do
by going to www.myspace.com and clicking on the Sign Up link. The
first thing that you will want to do is create your profile. Keep things fun,
perky, and interesting. Next, you can begin adding content to your
MySpace page. Adding an interesting background or a cool piece of music
will help to set the mood. While you are at it, consider adding a banner
that links back to your real Web page. Of course, you want to add content
that others will find interesting. You also want to add information about
your Web site and encourage people to visit. Include a picture of yourself
or your logo. This will help you to begin to develop your own brand.
MySpace also provides you with access to your own blog. Use it to provide
regular updates to your MySpace page. Give people a reason to return and
read it.
130
Increase Your Web Traffic In a Weekend, Sixth Edition

Once you have set up your profile and added whatever content you want
to share, you need to begin building your list of friends. For starters, add
everyone you know at MySpace to your list of friends. Next, examine the
profiles of your friends to see who they have added to their friend’s lists
and send those people messages asking for permission to add them to
your list. After all, MySpace is about social networking and a never-
ending quest to meet new friends. After a while, once you have met plenty
of people, you’ll find that people will start soliciting you as a friend.
With your profile in place, your MySpace page created, and your list of
friends increasing, your next step should be to search MySpace for people
with interests similar to the content that you are providing on your Web
site. If these people have blogs, look for opportunities to post an inter-
esting comment. Everyone who visits that page will see your posting and
your link. Don’t do anything commercial or just blatantly start plugging
your Web page. If you make this mistake, you’ll lose friends faster than
you can make them. Instead, when you post a comment, keep it inter-
esting and on point. Most of all, make sure it provides value or at the very

least is entertaining. If people like what you have to say, they’ll look up
your profile to find out about your Web site and where more information
can be attained. As you look for blogs on which to post comments, focus
on finding the most popular people that you can because this will result
in more people reading what you have to say.
Generating Traffic Using Facebook
The largest and most popular social networking site on the Web is Face-
book (www.facebook.com), shown in Figure 3.23. As of the writing of
the sixth edition of this book, Facebook has more than 500 million users.
The first thing you should do after signing up for a free Facebook account
is to make sure you fill out your profile because the data you enter into
your Facebook profile is made available to search engines. Complete pro-
files are more interesting than sparsely filled in profiles. When adding
your URL, make sure that you include http:// as part of the URL name.
This will turn it into a clickable link. Also upload your picture or your
Web page logo to help you build up your brand. 
132
Increase Your Web Traffic In a Weekend, Sixth Edition
Figure 3.23
Facebook is the
world’s largest
social networking
Web site.

Once your profile is complete, you have a couple of options: create a face
group, a page, or both. Both have value and are worth doing. Groups focus
more on bringing people together who have common interests. Groups
work sort of like mini-forums. To help get your group page off to a good
start, consider setting up a contest and giving a prize away.
However, between the two choices, pages are generally more important to
your marketing efforts. Facebook pages are where most people go to
interact. One advantage of Facebook pages is that they are indexed by 
the major search engines, whereas groups are not indexed. To gain further
benefit from your Facebook pages, make them more search-engine friendly
by including keywords in your page name.
As you get started, make sure that you add valuable and entertaining
content to your Facebook pages. Take advantage of Facebook’s free appli-
cations. You can use them to share your Flickr pictures and YouTube
videos, as well as to display your blog feed. 
Be careful not to jump right into Web site promotion. If you do so, you’ll
drive your friends away and get nowhere really fast. Instead, focus on pro-
viding something that people will find beneficial. Once you have estab-
lished yourself as an expert and a trusted friend, you can start publishing
links to pages on your Web site that your Facebook friends might also
find useful. Just don’t overdo it.
Once you have your profile defined and have created your Facebook
group page, you need to find yourself some friends. Begin by inviting
everyone that you already know on Facebook to become your friend.
Next, join a few groups related to the same types of topics covered on
your Web site. Ask people that you meet in these groups to be your
friend. You can also have Facebook suggest new friends to you. When you
ask people to become your friend, make sure you give them a good reason
to do so, referring to the value of information that you’ve placed on your
group or page. But in your zest to add new friends, don’t get carried away
trying to add hundreds of friends every day. If you do so, you run the risk
of being seen as a spammer. If your Facebook page or group is good, it
should not take long for you to amass a considerable group of friends. 
SATURDAY AFTERNOON  The Coolest, the Hottest, and the Best
133

Also, regularly visit other people’s groups and pages, and whenever you
have something of value to share, do so by posting a comment. This will
make group and page owners want to be your friend. Once you have a
good following of friends, you need to make sure you regularly update
your Facebook page or group so that your friends will continue to visit
you and ultimately your Web site.
Generating Traffic Using Twitter
Twitter (www.twitter.com) is a fast rising up-and-comer in the world of
social Web sites. At the time of writing the sixth edition of this book,
Twitter had over 145 million members. Twitter, shown in Figure 3.24,
supports what is known as micro-blogging, where member post short mes-
sages, referred to as tweets, that are 140 characters or less. A big part of
Twitter’s success is its support for mobile users, which allows them to
tweet anytime and anywhere using mobile devices like their cell phone.
Your tweets are sent to other Twitter members who subscribe to them.
These members are referred to as your followers. One of your goals is to
get as many people as you can to follow you. 
Today, most major companies around the world, like Apple and
Microsoft, use Twitter as a means for quickly getting the word out about
new products, promotions, and so on. You can do the same. Another
advantage of using Twitter is that search engines index the site. As a result,
your Twitter page may show up in search engine results, even if your Web
page does not.
You can join Twitter by signing up for a free account at www.twitter.com.
Here again, the first thing you should do after joining is to fully fill out
your profile information. Include your picture or Web site logo as well as
your URL, prefixed with http:// so that it will be clickable. Spend some
time looking for other members who you think will be interested in what
you have to share and follow them. Odds are they will follow you back.
You can find these people by searching Twitter directories or by searching
member profiles.
134
Increase Your Web Traffic In a Weekend, Sixth Edition

Remember, Twitter is a social networking site and not a marketing site, so
don’t start blatantly marketing your Web site. Make sure you are a good
community member and that you follow other members and stay active
in the community. When you post, make sure that your postings are useful
or entertaining. Each time you make a posting, include an invitation at
the end inviting people to follow you. When you provide postings that
are especially useful, you can direct your followers back to your Web site.
Social Bookmarking Sites
Social bookmarking is an online community service in which members
create, describe, organize, and search for bookmarks online that they wish
to share with others. Unless explicitly marked as private, social book-
marks are publically searchable. There’s an important distinction between
bookmarking sites and other sites that allow people to share resources—
social bookmarking sites don’t share resources, they only link to them.
SATURDAY AFTERNOON  The Coolest, the Hottest, and the Best
135
Figure 3.24
Twitter is the Web’s

micro-blogging
Web site.

Social bookmarking sites allow members to do more than simply create
links to Web sites. Social bookmarks also include detailed descriptions of
the sites to which they are linked. Descriptions may consist of text or votes
in support of or against the target Web page’s quality. Bookmarks can also
include tags (keywords) collaboratively generated by the bookmark’s
creator as well as comments later added by others through a process known
as social tagging.
Social bookmarks can be searched via social networking sites. They can
be searched chronologically by tag or browsed via category. Because the
major search engines index social bookmarks, they also appear inside search
results. Social bookmark sites also track bookmark popularity and usually
display the number of people who have bookmarked the same URL.
Social bookmarking can be used to help promote your Web pages. You
should generate social bookmarks for your Web site’s landing page as well
as for each of the major topic pages. Do not create more than one book-
mark for the same page, and do not create bookmarks for every page in
your Web site. If you do, you run the risk of being labeled as a spammer
and having all of your bookmarks removed.
In addition to creating your own bookmarks, make sure that you spend
time writing comments on other people’s bookmarks. This will increase
the likelihood that they will reciprocate and add comments to your book-
marks, including the bookmarks you’ve added for you own site. If your
bookmarks are compelling enough, people will be motivated to click on
them and visit your Web pages.
Social bookmarks represent links to Web sites, so any links that you add
to your Web pages will increase your Web page’s search engine ranking.
Since people must decide to click on the social bookmarks to your Web
pages, the traffic you get from these will be of higher quality because the
people who click on them are obviously interested.
If you want to make social bookmarking a part of your Web marketing
campaign, a good place to start is www.delicious.com, as shown in
Figure 3.25. Delicious is a social bookmarking site owned by Yahoo!.

Social Review Sites
Social review sites are Web sites where members and users post their opin-
ions about products and services covering pretty much any topic they
wish. The primary objective of social review sites is to provide visitors
with feedback on products and services they may be considering pur-
chasing. Examples of the kind of reviews you may come across include
television shows, movies, restaurants, toys, cars, and so on.
One of the most popular social review sites is Epinions.com. Shown in
Figure 3.26, Epinions.com is a general consumer review site owned by
Ebay.
At Epinions.com, members can post reviews on any product or service they
wish. Visitors can then read these reviews and use them as input on their
purchasing decisions. Members provide these reviews for free. In return, they
have the opportunity to earn money and recognition of their expertise.

Epinions.com allows members to submit two types of reviews: express
and regular. An express review consists of 20-199 words, whereas regular
reviews are 200 words or more. Members can also rate opinions, thus adding
additional value to them. When rating a regular review, members can rate
their opinions using any of the following:

VH—Very Helpful

H—Helpful

SH—Somewhat Helpful

NH—Not Helpful

OT—Off Topic
When rating an express review, members can rate opinions using either
of the following:

S—Show

DS—Don’t Show
138
Increase Your Web Traffic In a Weekend, Sixth Edition
Figure 3.26
Epinions.com is a
social review site
where members
share their opinions
on just about
everything.

The first thing you should do after joining Epinions.com is to completely
fill out your profile. This includes supplying a photo and your Web site’s
logo. Make sure you specify your URL, as this is important in generating
referral traffic back to your Web site.
Once your profile has been established, you should begin writing reviews
about products and services with which you have experience and expert-
ise. Include some reviews about your own Web pages and the content
provided there. Once you have written some reviews, the next thing you
should work on is to gain the trust of other members.
At Epinions.com, members can decide to trust or block one another. The
accumulation of trust and block relationships form what is called a Web
of Trust, or WOT. Your WOT, along with the ratings assigned to your
reviews, will determine the order in which reviews are displayed to visi-
tors. Reviewers who write a lot of reviews and whose reviews are well
rated may be assigned Top Reviewer or Category Lead status, in which
case their reviews are placed at the top of review listings.
By becoming a member of Epinions.com, you can write reviews about the
information available on your Web pages and, as a result, generate refer-
ral traffic back to your Web site. By building a large Web of Trust, you
can generate more referrals. Another advantage of participating at Epin-
ions.com is that their review pages are indexed by the major search
engines, so this can also improve your search engine ranking.
Social News Sites
Social news sites are Web sites where members submit and then vote on
news stories and related content. Voter results impact the order in which
news sites are displayed in searches. Social news site reviews are generally
indexed by the major search engines, and any links to your pages that you
add at these sites will help increase your Web site’s popularity. There are
numerous social news Web sites out there, but two of the very best are Digg
and StumbleUpon.

Getting Your Web Pages Dugg at Digg
Digg allows members to submit news stories (videos, pictures, and so on),
which other members can then vote up or down through a process known
as digging or burying. Submissions include a custom description of the
material being submitted. The most “dugg” stories end up on the front
page of www.digg.com, as demonstrated in Figure 3.27. People visit Digg
to read up on the most interesting news stories of the day, generally focus-
ing their time and attention only on the must dugg stories.
Membership at Digg is free. The first thing you must do when signing up
is establish your profile, after which you should add anybody you know
at Digg to your list of friends. You can find additional friends quickly by
examining your friends’ friends and making those people your friends as
well. Next, add a few entries for the most interesting pages on your Web
site and “digg” them. Hopefully, other people will review and “digg” your
pages as well, driving lots of traffic back to your Web site. Whenever you
update content on your Web pages, make sure you log into Digg and
send out “shouts” to all your friends. And don’t forget to ask your friends
to tell others if they like what they find.
Figure 3.27
Digg is a social
news site where

(digg) or vote down
(bury) content.

Ensuring Web Surfers Stumble Upon Your Web
Pages
StumbleUpon (www.stumbleupon.com), shown in Figure 3.28, puts a
slightly different twist on things by using its personalized recommenda-
tion engine to present members with Web pages to view based on infor-
mation retrieved from their profiles, previous ratings of other news stories,
and ratings assigned by their friends. All members need do is download
and install a free StumbleUpon toolbar and click on the Stumble! button
located in the StumbleUpon toolbar to begin. As they review stories,
members are encourages to share their opinions.
Like Digg, you can submit your own Web pages for review, knowing that
people of similar interest will stumble upon them as well. If your pages
are good, you should see plenty of new traffic at your Web site.

Social Photo and Video Sharing Sites
Also incredibly popular are Web sites built around communities of people
who share their photos and videos, made possible through the advent of
broadband technologies. For example, one of the most popular photo
sharing social media sites is Flickr, where people can upload and share
pictures with their friends, relatives, and people around the world. When
it comes to video sharing, YouTube remains the top dog.
Publishing Your Photos at Flickr
At Flickr (www.flickr.com), shown in Figure 3.29, photos are shared with
Flickr members and are also made available through search engines like
Google and Yahoo!.
Every photo that you add to Flickr results in a link back to your Flickr
page so make sure you optimize your photos for search engines, assigning
them relevant keywords that will help people find them. People who
admire your photos and follow these links will be able to view your Flickr
profile and use it to locate your Web site, thus driving more traffic to it.
142
Increase Your Web Traffic In a Weekend, Sixth Edition
Figure 3.29
Flickr is a photo

Flickr provides both free and Pro accounts (a Pro account costs $29.95 a
year), the difference being that free accounts have a 100MB per month
bandwidth limit. Begin by signing up for a free account and see if the
results merit later converting to a Pro account. When you sign up, be sure
to completely fill out your profile and to upload your picture or Web site
logo. Every user has to define a screen name for his picture and you may
want to include your Web site URL in that name. Don’t forget to link
back to your Web site. Lastly, you get to create your own Flickr URL,
which you can customize just about any way you want. Consider includ-
ing your Web site’s URL into your Flick URL. For example, if your Web
site’s URL is www.photofanatic.com then you might make your Flickr
URL www.flickr.com/photos/photofanatic/.
Also, don’t forget that Flickr is a social community. To get as much
benefit from it as you can, you need to participate. To do so, join a couple
of groups, submit your photos to them, and take time to comment on
other people’s photos. Even better, create your own group and allow others
to join you.
Using Video to Promote Your Web Site 
and Products
In recent years, video has exploded all over the Internet. People just
cannot seem to get enough of it. If you know how to create and edit your
own videos using your computer, then you can take advantage of this new
communication medium and use it to increase your own Web traffic.
Without a doubt, one of the best places to post your videos and get 
attention is on YouTube (www.youtube.com), as shown in Figure 3.30.
YouTube is a video sharing Web site where visitors can view and comment
on video clips uploaded by anyone who is a member of YouTube. Anyone
can register and join YouTube.
YouTube was created in 2005 and within one year was purchased by
Google for 1.65 billion dollars. YouTube’s astoundingly rapid growth was
SATURDAY AFTERNOON  The Coolest, the Hottest, and the Best
143

due in no small part to viral marketing. By uploading videos of your own,
you can tap into YouTube’s viral marketing and draw people to your own
Web site.
To upload a video to YouTube, you must first register, after which you can
click on the Upload link located on www.youtube.com and start upload-
ing your videos. For each video that you upload, you get to supply a title,
description, and category. Make sure you include keywords that will help
people find your video. By adding credits to the end of your video,
including your Web site’s URL, you can encourage people to visit your
Web site to find other videos and related content. You can also display
information about your Web site, including its URL, so that anyone
watching your video can learn more about where it came from. Make sure
you leave your URL visible for at least five seconds. YouTube likes to tran-
sition quickly between videos, so unless you build in a long pause, people
won’t have time to see it.
144

People go to YouTube and other similar video sharing sites to have fun. Do not submit
videos that are nothing more than commercials and marketing hype. Instead, make sure
that your videos are entertaining. This doesn’t mean that you cannot mention your Web
site in your video or work it in somehow. As a general rule, try to keep your video under
five minutes long and focus on making it as funny or entertaining as possible.
Social Question-and-Answer Sites
Community-driven question-and-answer (Q&A) Web sites are yet
another new type of social networking Web site gaining rapid popularity.
These sites allow members to submit questions and answers posed by others.
Two of the most popular Q&A sites are Yahoo! Answers and Answers.com.
Figure 3.31 shows the Yahoo! Answers main page. At the time of writing
the sixth edition of this book, Yahoo! Answers boasts a membership of
over 200 million users with more than 15 million visits per day.

NOTE
Figure 3.31
Yahoo! Answers is
an online question-
and-answer site.

To participate, you must have a Yahoo! account. When you set up your
account, take advantage of the ability to upload your photo or Web logo
in order to promote your brand. Although you can, you do not have to
use your login account as your user name. Instead, give yourself a user
name that sounds real. It will add credibility.
As soon as you sign up, you can begin answering questions posted by
other community members. Just go to http://answers.yahoo.com/ and
browse or search for questions that you can answer. Make sure your
answers are of the highest quality. Each time you answer a question, make
sure you include a link back to your Web site. Note, however, that your
link will not be posted until you have earned 200 points.
By default, questions are left open for four days, although the person who
posts the question can elect to close the answer period sooner or extend
it for an additional period of time. In order to ask questions, you must
have a balance of at least five points. Yahoo! Answers uses a point system
that is designed to encourage members to answers questions. Once a
member has demonstrated expertise in an area and has answered a suffi-
cient number of questions, a label of Top Contributor is displayed under
their avatar. Yahoo! does not publish the formula used to determine Top
Contributor status. It does, however, publish information about its point

knowledge and expertise. As you do so, you’ll begin generating quality
traffic for your Web site.
Blogging Sites
The term blog is short for Web log. It is a Web site or a part of a Web site
where the owner is able to post entries that others can read. Blog entries
may consist of text and graphics, and are typically displayed in reverse
chronological order. Most blogs are interactive, allowing visitors to
comment on the entries.
If you have a Facebook or MySpace account, then you already have access
to your own blog. Your Web site provider may also give you access to a
free blogging service. In addition, there are plenty of online blogging
services you can try, including Blogger (www.blogger.com) shown in
Figure 3.32.
Blogs are frequently indexed by the major search engines. Blogs can help
you build your reputation and brand as well as drive traffic back to your
Web site. You can also draw traffic to your Web site by visiting other
people’s blogs and posting comments, along with your URL. Obviously,
to get the most out of this approach, your comments will need to show
that you have something interesting or useful to share; otherwise, people
won’t click on your URL.
Not all blogs are equal. Finding and commenting on the most popular
blogs will drive more traffic your way than commenting on less popular
blogs. Blogging provides you with the opportunity to interact directly
with your visitors and to adapt how you do things based on their com-
ments. 
SATURDAY AFTERNOON  The Coolest, the Hottest, and the Best
147

Another way of effectively using blogs to help bring traffic to your Web
site is to guest blog. In guest blogging, you submit blog entries on
someone else’s blog. This gives you the opportunity to reach out to new
readers and to further increase your link popularity when you include
your URL as part of your blog entry.
As a slight variation of traditional blogging, you should also join and par-
ticipate at Squidoo (www.squidoo.com), shown in Figure 3.33. Squidoo
is a social community where members create Web pages known as lenses.
Lenses are very similar to blog posts, except they are focused on a single
topic. When you join Squidoo and start creating lenses, you become a
Lensmaster. Lenses are indexed by all the major search engines, so when
you create new lenses make sure that you use appropriate keywords.
Squidoo is a good place for finding people with interests similar to your
own. By posting high-quality lenses, you can generate a reputation of

expertise. Each lens you make can be linked back to your Web site,
increasing your link popularity and Web traffic. Squidoo also supports
the formulation of community groups. By joining groups and making
useful comments on other people’s lenses, you can drive even more traffic,
especially if you target groups that are popular.
Demonstrating Expertise through Wikis 
and Article Sites
Another final category of social networking Web sites that merit attention
are wikis and articles. Wikis and related sites allow you to submit and
contribute to online articles. Article directories, on the other hand, accept
your published articles, which are then made available for free for posting
on other Web sites. Both wikis and article sites provide you with the
opportunity to demonstrate expertise and develop name recognition. At
the same time, you can increase your link popularity and improve your
search engine results position.

Sharing Authoritive Information through Wikipedia
If you believe that your Web site is truly an authoritative source of infor-
mation on a particular topic, you may want to consider sharing some 
of this information with the rest of the world using Wikipedia
(www.wikipedia.org). Wikipedia, shown in Figure 3.34, is an online col-
laborative encyclopedia. Anyone is welcome to add content to Wikipedia,
provided they follow Wikipedia’s editing policies and rules.
For starters, begin by searching Wikipedia to see if the topic that your
Web site covers already exists. If it does not, then you can create a new
Wikipedia page on that topic. In doing so, you can even provide a link to
your Web site. But you must do so carefully. If the information you
provide comes across as commercial, it will quickly be pulled. It is absolutely
critical that you provide content that is totally objective and factual. In
addition, it is expected that you reference other resources as part of your
topic, including other related topics already in Wikipedia.
150
Increase Your Web Traffic In a Weekend, Sixth Edition
Figure 3.34
Wikipedia is 
an online
community-driven
encyclopedia.

By being objective and providing material that is factual and informative,
your topic should pass editorial scrutiny. Of course, you can use your Web
site as an external reference. However, if your Web site is too commercial,
you should avoid listing your site’s main page’s URL and instead list the
URL of a page that is not designed to plug your Web site and its products
and services. If Wikipedia readers find your topic interesting, they will
follow the link to your Web site, and once there, they will almost certainly
look around.
Reaching Out to Users through Online E-zines
Another way of bringing new traffic to your Web sites is to leverage the
power of e-zines. An e-zine is an electronic publication or newsletter 
distributed over the Internet. To receive an e-zine, readers must sign up
for it. Most e-zines are distributed via e-mail. However, some are posted
on Web sites or in blogs, and an e-mail is sent to notify subscribers when
new editions are available.
Finding e-zines is easy. All you have to do is perform a quick search using
“e-zine” as the keyword in any search engine. Alternatively, you can search
for e-zines of interest using The Ezine Directory (www.ezine-dir.com).
This directory, shown in Figure 3.35, provides access to hundreds of dif-
ferent e-zines.
You can leverage the marketing power of e-zines by contacting those that
cover topics closely related to the material on your Web site, and then 
pay to place an advertisement. Alternatively, you can contact an e-zine
and submit your own articles to them for publication. Two other good
directories to which you can submit your articles include Recent Articles
(www.recent-articles.com) and ArticleTrader (www.articletrader.com).
When you write and submit articles, you do so with the hope that people
will visit the article directory with which you register, and then display a
copy of your article on their own Web site. This will help increase your
link popularity and help drive high-quality traffic directly to your Web
site when readers click on the link that you include with your articles.

Wrapping Up and Looking Ahead
If you offer products, services, or business information at your Web site,
you should definitely list your site with business search sites and directo-
ries. Business search engines and Yellow Pages directories offer unique
places to get your business and your business-oriented Web site noticed.
After submitting your site to these search engines, you should go on to
submit your site to search engines and directories that focus on specific
industries. These guides can also help your Web site stand out from the
crowd, especially when you consider that the major category guides
attract millions of visitors, yet have considerably fewer listings than main-
stream directories, such as Yahoo!.
Kids’ directories and award sites are also important. Kids represent a sig-
nificant segment of the Internet community. Thousands of organizations
are offering Web awards. Web awards range from daily awards, such as

the Cool Site of the Day award, to yearly awards, such as PC Magazine’s
Top 100. Lastly, let’s not forget about social networking. The incorpora-
tion of promotion aimed at taking advantage of social networking Web
sites is also essential to any Web promotion.
Now, put this book down and relax a bit. First thing tomorrow morning
you’ll learn how to submit your site to many search engines and directo-
ries simultaneously. As always, the focus will be on using resources that
are low-cost or free.

M
any companies offer services that allow you to register with mul-
tiple search engines and directories. These so-called registration
services are great if you want to quickly spread the word about
many different Web page URLs. You’ll spend this morning learning
about these and other valuable means of promoting your Web site.
Registering with Many Search Engines 
and Directories Simultaneously
Like search engines and directories, registration services have different
submission processes. This session covers registration services: how they
operate, what to watch out for, and how to use these services without
paying a dime.
Introducing Web Registration Services
Registration services are one of the most innovative types of Web services
to come along. The idea is that instead of having to register with search
engines and directories one by one, you can use the service to register
with many different search engines and directories at once. Although one
central interface for registering your Web site is wonderful, you still
sometimes have to go through a rather lengthy submission process.
157

While registration services can certainly save you some time, it’s best if
you go through each search engine or directory site’s submission process
yourself. When you work hands-on with a search engine or directory site,
you get a clear idea of how the site works. When you work with a registra-
tion service, you rely on the service to take advantage of how a site works.
Using Registration Services
The registration process usually starts with you entering information into
a form. This information may include all the elements you would nor-
mally enter into the submission form of a search engine or directory, such
as the page title, page description, and personal contract information.
Next, you select the search engines and directories to which you want to
submit your site. Afterward, you begin the submission process, which
often involves having to register each site separately by clicking on indi-
vidual submission buttons that will send your information to a specific
search engine or directory.
Because most search engines and directories use unique categories or
require you to fill out other information, you usually enter this additional
information during the submission process. For example, before you can
submit your page to the Yahoo! Web directory, you need to select a cate-
gory.
All these intermediate stops along the road mean that the registration
process isn’t always as easy as the registration services would like for you
to believe. Still, the process is an improvement over manual submission if
you are in a rush.
Working with Registration Services
Like any service-oriented business, registration services are for-profit
enterprises. You can’t blame these services for trying to make a buck off
their hard work. The cost of registering your site can jump to hundreds
of dollars, however, and most registration services base their charges on
the number of URLs that you want to register and the number of places
158
Increase Your Web Traffic In a Weekend, Sixth Edition

to which you submit your URLs. For example, a registration service
might charge $30 to submit a single URL to 50 search engines, $60 to
submit two URLs to 50 search engines, or $100 to submit one URL to
150 search engines.
But before you shell out your hard-earned cash or corporate money, you
should know what you are buying. The first thing you might notice when
you examine the resources provided by a registration service is that you’ve
probably never heard of most of these sites. Some of the sites are small
and receive very little Web traffic at all. Worse, you might find that some
of the sites don’t even function.
Additionally, you should note that resource sites are frequently for
restricted types of search engines and directories. You will find Yellow
Pages directories that take only business listings. You will find directories
for Web sites covering specific geographic areas, such as Canada, Europe,
or Asia. You will also find specialty directories, such as What’s New?
directories, award sites, and guides to the best of the Web.
In the end, whether you can register with 50 or 500 search engines
doesn’t really matter. What matters is the number of search engines that
you can use out of those available. Fortunately, the best sites are usually
those included in the first 50. Because of this, you get more bang for your
buck if you stick to the basics—and the free services covered in this
chapter are the ultimate in getting your money’s worth.
The most important thing to consider when you use registration services
is the type of site with which you are registering. As you learned in pre-
vious chapters, there is a huge difference between a search engine and a
Web directory.
Search engines use the URL that you specify to crawl through your entire
site and will usually schedule your site for periodic reindexing. Because
search engines reindex your site, you only need to register with a search
engine once. And because search engines crawl through your entire site,
you only need to register the URL to your top-level home page. That
SUNDAY MORNING  Attracting the Masses
159

said, it is still a good idea to register your Web site with search engines
once every six months. This protects your site from being dropped or not
being reindexed automatically.
On the other hand, Web directories create a listing only for the page you
specify, and they rarely update the listing. Because Web directories focus
on pages rather than entire sites, you can register multiple URLs for the
same site. The URLs that you submit should be for separate areas that
cover different topics.
Because Web directories rarely update listings, you are responsible for
updating your listing in the directory if you move the furniture around at
your Web site, which doesn’t necessarily mean that you should reregister
with the directory. Instead, you should check the directory to see whether
it has an update or change process. To make life easier on yourself and to
avoid having to submit changes for your listings, you can use the redirection
techniques discussed in the Sunday Afternoon session under “Gaining
Lost Readers from Error Analysis.”
While this chapter focuses on providing you with a list of online registration services,
there are also a number of software products that you can purchase and install on your
computer in order to set up your own registration process. However, unlike the free 
services listed in this chapter, these software products will cost you a few dollars. If you
are interested in learning more about these software products, check out Appendix A,
“Additional Resources on the Web.”
In the end, if you use a registration service, don’t waste your time rereg-
istering with search engines and directories you’ve already signed up with.
Concentrate on the search engines and directories with which you haven’t
registered.

Checking on Your Listings
Once you have finished submitting your Web site to the search engines
on your list, you are going to want to keep tabs on how each search
engine is managing its links to your Web pages. You’ll want to know
when your Web site is listed and if anyone is linking to it. This way, if
something goes wrong and a particular search engine doesn’t add your
Web pages to its database within 4 to 6 weeks, you’ll know about it and
can submit your Web site again.
If your Web site doesn’t get listed in a particular search engine’s database, it may be the
result of a simple oversight. Or it could be that you mistyped your URL during the sub-
mission process, and the search engine couldn’t find your Web site. However, it could also
be that the search engine found something objectionable at your Web site. Before resub-
mitting, review your Web pages and make sure that you haven’t added any content that
might be interpreted as spam.

Determining Whether Your Web Site Has Been
Listed
There are a number of ways that you can go about checking on the status
of your Web pages at various search engines. At a minimum, you will
want to keep tabs on things at Google, Yahoo!, and Bing, since they are
the three most popular search engines.
Perhaps the most simple and obvious option is to visit each search engine
and enter the URL of your Web site’s main page and any other Web pages
that you wish to check on. You can also use this option to find out if 
any of your competitors are listed in a given search engine’s database. 
For example, to see if the Bing engine has listed any Web pages for
www.tvpress.com, you would do a search as shown in Figure 4.4.
If only your URL is listed in the search engine’s output results, then the search engine has
most likely added an entry for your Web site to its index, but it hasn’t crawled your Web
site yet. In this case, be patient but keep checking.

NOTE

Finding Out Which of Your Web Pages Are Listed
Once you know that your Web site has been added to a search engine’s
database, you’ll want to check and see which of your pages have been
indexed. You can do this by using your browser to open the search
engine’s Web page and entering the site: command, as demonstrated in
Figure 4.5.
As Figure 4.5 demonstrates, you execute the site: command by keying
it into the search engine’s search field. Take note that there is no blank
space between the site: command and the specified URL.
Google, Yahoo!, and Bing all support the site: command. Other search engines may
support this command or provide a different command to produce the same results. You
can usually find out specific information regarding the search commands for a given
search engine by consulting the search engine’s Help area.

NOTE

After verifying that your Web site is listed in each of the big three search
engines and checking to see which of your Web pages were added to each
search engine’s database, it is a good idea to check and see if anybody else’s
Web pages have links to your Web site. After all, the number of good
links to your Web pages has a lot to do with how close your Web pages
come to making the top 10 search results. Hopefully, you will find that
the number of links will grow over time. Otherwise, you may want to
investigate different ways of improving the situation, such as by signing
up with a link exchange service, as will be discussed later this morning.
To check on links to your Web site using Google and Bing, you can use
the link: command. For example, to check on the number of links to
www.tvpress.com, you would enter link:www.tvpress.com into either
search engine’s search field as demonstrated in Figure 4.6.

In addition to directly querying specific searches regarding the link 
popularity of your Web site, there are a number of Web sites that provide
free link checking. For example, at AddMe.com (www.addme.com/
popularity.htm) you can submit your URL and e-mail address and gen-
erate a report showing how popular your Web site is in terms of how many
links there are to it. As Figure 4.7 shows, results are retrieved from Ask,
Google, Yahoo!, AltaVista, and AllTheWeb. By clicking on the Details link
associated with each search engine, you can view additional information
about your links.
Selling Your Web Site through E-mail
Plain old e-mail is an extraordinary means of promoting your Web site.
Every day, people send more messages by e-mail than by standard mail,
and why not? Messages sent by e-mail are usually free. The millions of
daily e-mail messages bounce around the globe in one of three forms:
messages sent from person to person, messages posted to a newsgroup,
and messages submitted to a mailing list.

In your promotional efforts, you can use all three ways of distributing e-
mail to promote your Web site. However, nothing will get you into hot
water quicker than sending unsolicited or unwanted e-mail. To help you
steer clear of the pitfalls of e-mail promotion and get the most out of your
efforts, this section shows you the right ways to sell your Web sites through
e-mail.
Web Site Promotion through Direct E-mail,
Newsgroups, and Mailing Lists
E-mail has been around since the earliest days of the Internet. The wide-
spread popularity of e-mail comes from the fact that it is so compulsively
usable. Unlike standard mail, you can use e-mail to quickly and easily
send the same message to hundreds, thousands, or millions of recipients.
Unlike limitations presented by using a telephone, you can send e-mail at
any time of the day or night without fear of waking the recipient. Unlike
using a fax machine, you can send a message without having to worry
whether the recipient has stocked the fax machine with paper or whether
the fax line will be busy.
Just as most people don’t want to receive calls from telemarketers, unso-
licited faxes, or junk mail, most people don’t want to receive unsolicited
e-mail either. In the world of electronic mail, no four-letter word is more
odious than spam. Spamming is the electronic equivalent of junk mail.
Any time you send unsolicited or unwanted messages, you are guilty of
spamming. Sure, Web advertising agencies will try to sell you on the
concept of bulk e-mail by telling you that the word spam applies only to
unsolicited messages sent to multiple recipients, multiple discussion groups,
or multiple mailing lists. In the end, however, an unsolicited message is
an unsolicited message, whether it is sent to one or a thousand recipients.
As anyone who has ever sent unsolicited e-mail will tell you, the conse-
quences can be severe. Your e-mail box might be bombarded with hate mail.
Your Internet service provider (ISP) might pull your account. You might
even run into legal difficulties. Despite these potential pitfalls, people all
168
Increase Your Web Traffic In a Weekend, Sixth Edition

over the world continue to spam the electronic byways. The reason is the
tremendous value of being able to send messages to anyone, anywhere, at
any time.
Although you can certainly take a haphazard approach to Web site pro-
motion through e-mail, there are ways to work within the system and
current guidelines for newsgroups and mailing lists without rocking the
boat. Working within the guidelines allows you to tap into the wonder-
ful potential of e-mail, newsgroups, and mailing lists while minimizing
the risk of backlash.
You can do your best to work within the system while minimizing the risk, but you won’t
be able to please all the people all of the time. The simple truth is that some people like
to huff and puff. When you encounter someone who cries foul for no apparent reason,
you should do one of two things: simply ignore the person or send a brief apology and
move on.
The following section offers a look at how you can effectively promote your
Web site through direct communications, newsgroups, and mailing lists.
Establishing a Privacy Policy
Before you begin soliciting visitors to your Web site for permission to
send them e-mail, you need to earn their trust. After all, very few people
are going to give you their name and e-mail address if they think you
might abuse their information. In the context of this discussion, abuse
refers to spamming visitors with unexpected or unsolicited e-mail or
sharing their personal information with other parties. To alleviate these
types of concerns and to make your visitors feel comfortable giving you
their contact information, it is essential that you develop a privacy policy
and that you display it prominently in a location where visitors can easily
find it. For example, most Web sites put a link to their privacy policy
right at the bottom of their Web pages.
SUNDAY MORNING  Attracting the Masses
169
NOTE

When you formulate your privacy policy, make sure that you tell your vis-
itors exactly what type of information you are collecting about them and
exactly how this information will be used. Also, it is a good idea to mention
that you respect each individual’s right to privacy and will conform to and
respect anti-spam laws.
One way to begin putting together your own privacy policy is to take a
look at how somebody else has already done it. For example, Figure 4.8
shows the beginning of Amazon.com’s privacy notice.
If you want a little help in putting together your own privacy policy, you
can get it from www.privacyaffiliates.com. All you do is answer a few
multiple-choice questions about your customers and your Web site, and
a custom privacy policy will be created for you. However, this service is
not free. At the time the sixth edition of this book was written, the fee for
creating a privacy policy was $19.95.

Promoting Your Web Site Directly
When you send a message to people using their e-mail address, you are using
the most direct e-mail method: person to person. As a rule, you should
never send e-mail to anyone who doesn’t want it. Instead, you should put
together a promotional campaign that is responsive rather than proactive.
Don’t send unsolicited e-mail; instead, ask your visitors—and anyone else
who contacts you—whether they want to receive promotional material.
Sending Promotional Material
Promotional material that you send to subscribers can take many differ-
ent forms. For a straightforward marketing approach, you can use adver-
tisements and press releases pertaining to your organization as well as
your products and services. You can also use an approach that focuses less
on marketing and more on information. With this approach, you send
subscribers information on what’s new at the Web site, clips from recently
published pages, or highlights of interesting places within the Web site.
The best way to invite participation is to add a subscription field to the
HTML forms that are already at your Web site. In previous chapters, you
saw that many forms used by search sites and directories have subscrip-
tion fields. These fields ask whether you want to receive information or
other promotional material by e-mail.
Subscription fields are often selected by default, which in itself isn’t a bad
thing, but some search sites go out of their way to ensure that most
people who submit their forms join the subscription service. It is a decep-
tive practice to try and hide the subscription field or to blur the wording
so that it is isn’t clear.
Tips for Direct Mailings
To ensure that you receive subscriptions only from people who are truly
interested in what you have to offer, place the subscription field so that it
can be clearly seen, use clear wording, and deselect the field by default.
Doing so makes subscribing an active process that requires a conscious
effort from the reader.
SUNDAY MORNING  Attracting the Masses
171

Consider adding a subscription field if you use forms at your Web site
that allow visitors to submit comments, sign a guest log, or enter any
other type of data. The subscription field can be as simple as the option
buttons shown in Figure 4.9. Here, the subscription field asks visitors
whether they want to sign up for various mailing lists.
Some other more general subscription field questions that might be useful
include these:

172

Figure 4.9
Soliciting
permission to 
send e-mail to 
your visitors.

The important thing here is to keep things short and sweet. The more
information that you ask for, the less likely your visitors will take the time
to provide it. Also, you want to make it as easy as possible for your visi-
tors to sign up.
Examine your Web site and look for opportunities to offer email to your
visitors. For example, if you run a regular contest, you might want to
offer to send your visitors an e-mail each time the contest deadline
approaches. Or you might offer to send an e-mail to announce who won
the contest or what the next contest prize might be. Likewise, if you give
away freebies or downloads, you should consider each of these events as
opportunities to remind your visitors of your newsletters and e-mail lists. 
Another way to encourage your visitors to sign up for your newsletters
and e-mail is to create a Members Only area on your Web site where addi-
tional content is available. You could provide free access to this area to
any visitor who signs up for your mailing list. Think of these types of
opportunities as giving you the chance to build a relationship with your
visitors and to encourage repeat traffic and loyalty.
Always make sure that any e-mail or newsletters you send out include a link back to
your Web site and that you give your visitors a reason to visit. For example, you might
mention that more information is available back on your Web site about a particular
product, service, or topic. In addition, consider encouraging the recipients of your e-mail
to pass them on to their friends and colleagues. This will allow you to reach out to new
visitors without risking being seen as sending out spam.
Promoting Your Web Site through Newsgroups
Newsgroups are popular places for people with common interests. When
you send a message to a newsgroup, you submit the message to a discussion
area where everyone who follows the newsgroup can see it. Newsgroups,
like Web sites, cover just about every imaginable subject, and whether

TIP

your Web site discusses cats or conspiracy theories, a newsgroup relating
to your Web site topic exists.
Finding Newsgroups You Can Use to Promote
Your Web Site
With thousands of newsgroups available, trying to find one without a little
help is very time consuming. Rather than browse newsgroups individually,
you should visit a newsgroup archive site such as Google Groups (see Figure
4.10). Google Groups is a Web service provided by Google.
At Google Groups (groups.google.com), you can search through millions
of current postings to newsgroups by keyword. You can also browse your
way through the hierarchy of existing groups. If you don’t see a group that
fits your Web site topic, you can create a new newsgroup to get things
started.
174

Figure 4.10
Finding newsgroups
at Google Groups.

As shown in Figure 4.11, if you did a search on cats, you would find
thousands of messages featuring this keyword. By clicking on the message
subject line, you could access the most recent messages posted to the spec-
ified newsgroup. You’ll also find a list of groups related to cats at the top
of the page. If you find discussion groups related to topics you want to
promote or participate in, write down the name of the groups.
Posting Tips for Newsgroups
After you have compiled a list of all the newsgroups that might be of
interest, you should familiarize yourself with the groups by reading some
of the recent postings. Nothing enrages newsgroup participants more than
a promotional message that doesn’t relate to the topic at hand. Going a step
further, some newsgroup participants loathe all advertisements. 
SUNDAY MORNING  Attracting the Masses
175
Figure 4.11
Messages using 
the keyword 
are shown. 

For this reason, you should do the following:

Spend some time getting to know the group.

Ensure that your promotional message strongly relates to the
subject at hand.

Use a conversational style without a lot of hype.

Keep the promotional message short—a few paragraphs at most.

Post a message to a specific group one time and one time only; if
people are interested, they’ll respond.
As with direct promotion to individual users, you might want to focus
less on marketing and more on information. For example, if a newsgroup
participant asks about feline pneumonia and you have a terrific article on
this very subject at your Web site, you might want to reply with a message
like this one:
Feline pneumonia is a serious illness that affects thousands of cats
every year. Because my own cat nearly died from pneumonia, I
put together an article detailing the symptoms pet owners can look
for and the treatments that my veterinarian discussed with me.
You can find this article at. . . 
Promoting Your Web Site through Mailing Lists
Mailing lists are similar to newsgroups, but they are organized in a dif-
ferent manner. Whereas a message sent to a newsgroup goes to a central
discussion area, mailing list messages are sent via e-mail directly to all the
people who join the list. Because of the way lists work, you must subscribe
to a list before you can participate in it. After you subscribe, you can read
messages posted to the list and post your own messages.
The simple act of posting a message to a mailing list doesn’t ensure that
it will be sent to list members. Many mailing lists have moderators who
review messages before they are actually distributed to the list members.
If the message contains anything inappropriate, the moderator might cut
out the questionable parts or remove the message entirely.
176

Finding Mailing Lists You Can Use to Promote
Your Web Site
You can find mailing lists by visiting one of the many mailing list archive
or index sites. One of the best mailing list directories is available at
Tile.net. You can search through the directory using keywords or browse
the lists alphabetically (see Figure 4.12).
When you search through the mailing list directory, you will notice that
mailing lists aren’t organized into hierarchies. In place of hierarchies,
mailing lists use a naming system based loosely on the topic of the list or
the name of the organization sponsoring the list.
When you find a mailing list in Tile.net, you will see a brief description of
the list (see Figure 4.13) as well as the information you need to subscribe
to the list.
SUNDAY MORNING  Attracting the Masses
177
Figure 4.12
You can perform 
a keyword search
in order to locate
interesting 
mailing lists.

Mailing lists are one of the most fluid resources on the Internet. Every
day, dozens of new mailing lists are born, and dozens of old mailing lists
fade away into oblivion. Keeping up with this constant change is a chore
made possible only with help from the list creators and moderators.
Because of the constant changeover in mailing lists, it is a good idea to
check several different mailing list directories before making a decision
about which you would like to participate in and possibly use to promote
your Web site.
Posting Tips for Mailing Lists
As with newsgroups, you should read some of the postings to a mailing
list before you submit anything. With thousands of people on the receiv-
ing end of your promotional message, you have to be very careful about
the marketing approach you use. Nothing will generate hate mail faster
than a blatant advertisement posted to a mailing list.
Rather than post an advertisement, you might want to focus more on
information. Ideally, your posting should be helpful and useful to those

who read it. For specific tips on creating your posting, refer back to the
posting tips for newsgroups.
Almost every mailing list out there has a set of rules. Usually, these rules
are outlined in a set of FAQs (Frequently Asked Questions) for the list.
Definitely try to find and read the FAQs before you participate in a
mailing list. To make it easier to know and follow the rules, most mailing
lists send out a confirmation message after you subscribe. In this message,
you will usually find a list of the rules and lots of other good information.
Save this message; you might need it later.
“Tell a Friend” Marketing
Direct mail, newsgroups, and mailing lists all provide you with powerful
marketing tools. However, viral marketing or word-of-mouth marketing can
be even more powerful because it leverages the opinions and efforts of your
most important resources—your visitors. Let’s face it, there are very few
marketing techniques that are more powerful than the advice of a friend. By
encouraging your visitors to pass on information about your Web site,
product, or service, you increase the odds of bringing in new Web traffic.
Whether you realize it or not, you see viral marketing techniques imple-
mented all over the Web. For example, Amazon.com implements this
referral technique extensively, as demonstrated in Figure 4.14. Somewhere
on every page where a book (or product) is displayed at Amazon.com is
a Tell a Friend button.
You can implement your own word-of-mouth promotion by placing a link
or button next to a product, service description, or on a Web page that you
want more people to know about. Make sure your link or button stands
out prominently and uses an active voice to encourage visitors to act upon
your request. When clicked, you can open up the visitor’s e-mail applica-
tion and fill out the subject title and main body fields with information
about your Web site, product, or service. Alternately, you could look to a
free service on the Internet to set up and run your referral efforts for you.
For example, 1-Hit.com (www.1-hit.com) provides a free Tell-a-Friend
SUNDAY MORNING  Attracting the Masses

service at www.1-hit.com/all-in-one/tell-a-friend.htm, as shown in Figure

Announcing Your Web Site, Products, and Services
by E-mail
Promoting your Web site through topical discussions is a terrific way to
build traffic over the long term. Another way to build traffic is to
announce your Web site, products, and services through e-mail. Although
you can certainly announce your Web site in newsgroups that discuss
topics similar to those at your Web site, you can use several additional
avenues for making announcements. These avenues include:

Using newsgroups specifically for announcements.

Using business-oriented newsgroups.

Using marketplace, commerce, and for-sale newsgroups.
You can browse current postings to any of the newsgroups discussed in
this section by visiting Google Groups (groups.google.com). After you
read some of the postings and are sure that the list is right for you, you
can post your announcement. The key is to style your message in a
manner that is appropriate for the discussion group.
When you make an announcement, you might want to organize your
message like a press release that covers your Web site or the products and
services that you discuss at your Web site. Ideally, your message will only
be a few paragraphs long and fewer than 500 words. Brevity is important
because most readers won’t spend more than a few seconds glancing at
your message.
In the body of the message, you should include the URL to your Web site
or the particular area within your Web site that you are promoting. It’s a
good idea to repeat a URL at the top and bottom of the message, or to
direct readers to different URLs within the Web site. This way, anyone
scanning the message can zero in on the all-important URLs.
SUNDAY MORNING  Attracting the Masses

Announcement Newsgroups
Just as you can list your Web site in a What’s New? directory, you can also
list your Web site in discussion groups that are devoted to Web announce-
ments. Although most announcement groups focus on announcements
for new Web sites, some discussion groups focus on products and services.
Newsgroups that you can use to announce your Web site include:
alt.biz.misc
biz.marketplace
comp.infosystems.www.announce
comp.internet.net-happenings
misc.news.internet.announce
Business Newsgroups for Making Announcements
If you have ever wondered whether a place exists where blatant advertis-
ing and capitalism rule the day, look no further than the biz.* newsgroup
hierarchy. In the biz.* newsgroup hierarchy, you will find dozens of news-
groups devoted to announcements for products and services. Although
many of the announcements in biz.* newsgroups are filled with hype, the
most successful announcements are the ones that focus less on marketing
and more on information.
The primary newsgroups in the biz.* hierarchy that might be of interest
in your promotion efforts include:
alt.biz
alt.biz.misc
biz.books.technical
biz.general
biz.digital.announce
biz.marketplace.computers.discussion
bis.marketplace.discussion

More Newsgroups for Announcements
With thousands of discussion groups available, the listings in this chapter
are only the tip of the iceberg. If you know what to look for, you can find
dozens of other places to post announcements.
With newsgroups, searching the hierarchy listings for keywords is usually
the best way to find what you are looking for. You can do this at
groups.google.com. 
To find business-related newsgroups that might accept your announce-
ments, try using some of these keywords in your search:

Setting Up Autoresponders
Communication is an important component of any Web campaign. After
all, if you do not effectively get the word out and communicate your
message about your Web site, no one will visit. E-mail can certainly be an
important component of your overall Web campaign. Depending on how
you use it, you may find yourself the recipient of quite a bit of e-mail as well.
People like to feel that when they take the time to say something, they are
being heard. With e-mail, this means getting a message back. Depending
on the amount of incoming e-mail you find yourself faced with, this may
become a challenging task. One way to help you deal with this challenge
is to employ an autoresponder. Autoresponders automatically send out
predefined e-mails in response to incoming mail. Using an autorespon-
der, you could for example, thank the person for sending you the e-mail
and perhaps provide them with some additional information about your
Web site.
SUNDAY MORNING  Attracting the Masses
183

One of the nice features of autoresponders is that they work all the time,
allowing you to provide a quick response to any e-mail, no matter what
time of day it arrives. Using an autoresponder can also help to give you a
more professional image. There are a number of autoresponder services
available on the Internet. For example, FreeAutobot (www.freeautobot.com)
provides a free autoresponder service that allows you to set up both plain
text and HTML-based e-mail. Each time the service sends out an auto-
mated response on your behalf, it tacks a small line onto the end of your
e-mail that provides a link back to FreeAutobot.
Other autoresponder services that you may want to check out include
GetResponse E-mail Marketing and SendFree. GetResponse E-mail Mar-
keting (www.getresponse.com) is free for the first 30 days. SendFree
(www.sendfree.com) is also free for the first month.
Creating a Professional Image Using Multiple 
E-mail Accounts
One way of generating a more professional image is to set up and use
multiple e-mail addresses for your Web site. Using this approach, you can
set up e-mail addresses for different topics. For example, you might set up
an e-mail account to respond to all inquiries for more information, a
second e-mail account to deal with contests, and a third e-mail account
to handle all other issues.
Consider setting up an autoresponder for each of the e-mail accounts that you set up.
This will make it easy to automatically send out customized e-mail to people requesting
more information or entering a contest.
By defining multiple e-mail addresses, you will give your Web site the
same professional look and feel as  larger Web sites, like Amazon.com.
Setting up multiple e-mail accounts shouldn’t cost you anything. Most
Web site hosts provide you with the ability to set up and manage any
number of e-mail accounts.
184
Increase Your Web Traffic In a Weekend, Sixth Edition
NOTE

Using e-mail forwarding, a service provided by most Web site hosts, you can forward all
the e-mail from your various e-mail accounts to a single account, making it easier for
you to view and manage all incoming e-mail.
Creative Signature Files
An e-mail signature is an extra you can add to the end of all your e-mail
messages. This trailer can help you promote your Web site as well as your
products and services each time you send an e-mail message. Your signa-
ture can be styled as a mini-promotion for your Web site or anything else
that you want to highlight.
Although you might see e-mail signatures that run 10 to 20 lines, most
signatures are fewer than 5 lines. As a rule of thumb, 3 to 5 lines are usually
a good length. Because your e-mail signature will go out with all your
mail unless you delete the signature, it’s a good idea to limit the hype.
Listing 4.1 demonstrates how you might want to format your own e-mail
signatures. This should give you an idea of how you can create a signature
that is effective yet doesn’t look like an advertisement. If your e-mail
application allows you to create a signature using fancy fonts or special
formatting, keep in mind that this formatting is created with HTML and
may not be displayed with any special formatting in another e-mail appli-
cation. Additionally, you can improve readability in compliant e-mail
applications by using simple font types and readable font sizes.

NOTE

Most e-mail applications allow you to create a signature file. In some cases
you do so using an ordinary text file. After you create and save the signature
file, you can use the standard features of your favorite e-mail applications
to add the e-mail signature to all your outgoing messages. Most modern
e-mail applications also provide you with a built-in editor to assist you in
creating your custom signature. For example, if you used an online e-mail
service such as Yahoo! mail, you would set up your signature as outlined
here:
1. Open you browser and log in to mail.yahoo.com.
2. Click on the Options link located in the upper-right corner of the
screen, and then click on More Options.
3. Next, click on the Signature link in the left side panel.
4. Type in the text for your signature file in the space provided.
5. Select the Show a Signature on All Outgoing Messages option.
6. Click on Save Changes to save your signature.
If you use a desktop e-mail application, such as Windows Live Mail, the
process is pretty much the same. 
Developing an Online Business Card
In addition to communicating with Web surfers through e-mail and pro-
moting your Web site through a signature file, you may also want to con-
sider creating and distributing an online business card. An online
business card is simply the electronic equivalent of a traditional business
card, only instead of giving away a paper card, you give away the URL of
your business card, allowing anyone with whom you share it to look it up
and get your contact information and Web site URL.
If an online business card sounds like something that you can use as part
of your Web marketing campaign, you can set one up for free by visiting
Triumph PC at www.triumphpc.com/netcard, as shown in Figure 4.16. 
186

By filling in a simple form, you can create a business card that displays
your name, company name, job title, phone numbers, e-mail addresses,
and your URL. Best of all, your URL will show up as an active link that
when clicked will open your Web page.

Advertising on eBay
There is no doubt that eBay has become a major force on the Web. It pro-
vides a Web service that facilitates the buying and selling of products all
over the world. For individuals and companies with something to sell,
eBay provides a service known as an eBay store, as shown in Figure 4.17.
If your Web site has something to sell or if you plan on selling something,
eBay may be your ticket to success. At the time that the sixth edition of
this book was written, you could set up a new eBay store starting at just
$15.95 a month. This automatically puts you in front of millions of eBay
shoppers. You’ll have total control over how your online store looks. You
decide on the content, graphics, and colors. Your store will get its own
URL, and your customers will even be able to pay online via credit card.
In order to open a store, you must open an eBay account and place your
credit card on file. You can then open up a new store by logging in to
eBay, going to stores.ebay.com, and clicking on the Open a Store link.
188

Figure 4.17
eBay makes setting
up an online 
store a snap.

Once opened, you can set up your store as demonstrated in Figure 4.18.
As you can see, the store shown belongs to Midwest Sports Tennis and
Sandals.
As you can see in the figure, Midwest Sports has a considerable inventory
of tennis products for sale. You can click on any of the items shown in the
store to learn more information, purchase it, or place a bid on it, as
demonstrated in Figure 4.19.
If you return to the Midwest Sports store and click on the Me link, a page
with information about the store is displayed. Scroll down further on this
page, and you will see a section labeled Favorite Links. If you click on the
Midwest Sports Supply link, you will be taken to the store owner’s real
Web site (www.midwestsports.com). This will encourage customers to
visit them on the Web (see Figure 4.20) and potentially make purchases
directly from this Web site, thus bypassing eBay completely.

Get Noticed on Craigslist
Another amazingly popular Web site is Craigslist. At Craigslist, people
from all over the world gather to buy and sell things through an enormous
collection of classified ads. As shown in Figure 4.21, Craigslist is organized
into sections that are devoted to community matters, housing, jobs, per-
sonals, for sale, and services. Discussion forums are also hosted.
Within the Community section, there is a link labeled General. This is a
good place to advertise whatever you want to give away or sell. Make sure
you add a URL back to one of your Web site.  However, if you have any-
thing that properly fits into any of the more specific community cate-
gories, then place your ad there instead.
You can also generate quality Web traffic  by participating in discussion
forums that address the same topics covered on your Web site. When you
add postings, make sure that they are relevant to the discussion topic and
have plenty of value. This is not the place to make an obvious sales pitch,
but do mention that your URL is a good place where additional relevant
information can be found.
SUNDAY MORNING  Attracting the Masses
191
Figure 4.21
When used
effectively,
Craigslist can drive
a lot of traffic to
your Web site.

If you have items to sell, the categories listed in the For Sale section are
the place to market them. Here you can freely promote your stuff and
provide your URL without worrying about breaking any rules. Similarly,
if your Web site promotes a specific service, you can advertise it and your
URL in the in the appropriate Services category.
Craigslist looks for duplicate adds, preventing you from posting the same
add in several different categories. However, by making slightly different
versions of your ads, you can avoid being labeled as a spammer if you
want to post ads in different categories. In order to get the most out of
Craigslist, it’s a good idea to generate several versions of your ads and to
rotate them regularly. Make small changes to each ad each time you post
it. This way you’ll keep things fresh and avoid being viewed as a spammer.
As long as you play by the rules and don’t try to oversell your stuff or your
URL, you can drive some high-quality traffic back to your Web site.
Setting Up a Cybermall Shop
If you have products to sell, another way to reach out to online customers
is to add your Web site store front to a cybermall. A cybermall is an online
virtual shopping center that brings together the home pages of multiple
storefronts from across the Internet to provide buyers with a unified
shopping experience. The idea behind cybermalls is very much the same
as the idea behind traditional shopping malls, namely that by grouping
stores together and providing shoppers with a convenient way of moving
from store to store, you can attract more customers than member stores
could do on their own. 
Benefits
Cybermalls provide an obvious convenience for shoppers by providing
everything that they need in one place. Cybermalls also make shopping
easier by providing buyers with a single shopping cart that allows them to
visit different stores and to put everything into a single cart. Later, when
192
Increase Your Web Traffic In a Weekend, Sixth Edition

the buyer is done shopping and ready to pay for his purchases, he can do so
in a single transaction managed by the cybermall. This is a lot more con-
venient than having to purchase products from each store individually.
Finding the Right Place for Your Web Site
Cybermalls are becoming very popular. There are a number of very large
cybermalls, like buy.com (www.buy.com). Getting your Web store into
one of these cybermalls may be quite challenging if you are just starting
out. You may instead want to start by targeting a smaller cybermall, such
as the Slowtowne Market Place (www.slowtownemarketplace.com) as
shown in Figure 4.22.
Begin by spending a little time browsing the other stores at the cybermall,
and if you think that your Web store is a good fit, click on the Contact
Our Webmaster link on the main page. This will open your default e-mail
application and create a new e-mail with a subject line of “add retailer”
addressed to webmaster@slowtownemarketplace.com.

Getting Access to Millions of Customers
Working with Amazon.com
Amazon.com is one of the most popular destinations on the Internet with
tens of millions of customers. Even Web surfers who are not comfortable
with making online purchases often shop Amazon.com because of its
strong reputation. Amazon.com provides a number of different ways in
which you can align your Web site with Amazon.com and access its cus-
tomer base, hopefully turning your Web site into a profit-earning
resource.
Becoming an Affiliate and Setting Up Your Own
Store Front
One way to work with Amazon.com is to join its affiliate or associates
program. Doing so will allow you to set up links to Amazon.com that
allow you to advertise and sell different Amazon.com products directly
from your Web site. For example, if your Web site is dedicated to spread-
ing the word about the importance of global warming, you might want
to make your Web site more interesting by selling books that address this
subject on your Web site. In doing so, you can provide your visitors with
a more complete experience and also provide them with convenient
access to current literature on the subject. Best of all, any time a visitor
makes a purchase with Amazon.com through a link on your Web site,
you get a piece of the action.
To learn about and join Amazon.com’s affiliate program, visit
www.amazon.com and click on the Join Associates link located at the
bottom of the page.
Sell Your Products via Amazon.com’s Marketplace
If you create and sell books, CDs, or DVDs through your Web site, you
should seriously consider signing up with Amazon.com’s Advantage program.
This program allows authors, musicians, and video content providers to
list and sell their products alongside similar Amazon.com items.
194
Increase Your Web Traffic In a Weekend, Sixth Edition

To sell products through this program, you must be able to provide
Amazon.com with a scanable ISBN/EAN/UPC barcode on every item.
As of the writing of the sixth edition of this book, Amazon.com charged
a one-time fee of $29.95 to join its Advantage program. Any items you
list with Amazon.com gain instant access to millions of customers. Your
products are displayed right along with other Amazon.com products.
Amazon.com lets you specify your product’s description. Amazon.com
manages all your sales and sends you payments as your items sell.
If you brand your products with information about your Web site, you
can invite visits directly to your site, where you can encourage additional
purchases, this time directly from you. To learn more about
Amazon.com’s Advantage program, visit www.amazon.com/advantage.
Attracting the Masses with Giveaways,
Contests, Sweepstakes, and More
Traditional marketers have used giveaways, contests, and sweepstakes for
years to make their sponsors stand out from the crowd. The simple truth
is that we all love the chance to win something for nothing, and when-
ever we have the opportunity to enter a contest or giveaway, we usually
go for the gusto. Web advertisers have pushed traditional giveaways and
contests onto the World Wide Web, where the quest for freebies can truly
bring the masses to the sponsor’s Web site.
Can’t Get ’Em Any Other Way? Give It Away!
Giving things away is a great way to build traffic to your Web site.
Whether you want to pass out bumper stickers or trips to Europe, people
will want to enter your giveaway. Beyond outright giveaways are contests
and sweepstakes that ask the participants to answer questions or enter a
creative work, such as a poem or a jingle for a commercial.
Giveaways, contests, and sweepstakes promoted on the Web are often direct
tie-ins to similar promotions running in print media. If your organization
SUNDAY MORNING  Attracting the Masses
195

is already planning a giveaway or contest, advertising it on the Web can
bring your message to an eager audience of millions.
Universal Studios (www.universalstudios.com) is a company that under-
stands the promotional power of giveaways. Universal Studios (whose
sweepstakes have been referenced in six editions of this book) follows the
pointers offered in this book and understands how to promote contests
that tie-in with company products (see Figure 4.23).
If you have the clout of a major corporation behind you, promotional tie-
ins between your Web site and a giveaway or contest running in the print
media will work well. But even if you are not part of a major corporation,
you can benefit tremendously from running a contest or sweepstakes at
your Web site.

all the time.

Although many traditional promotional campaigns center around give-
aways, contests, and sweepstakes, savvy marketers know that the interac-
tive and dynamic nature of the Web opens doors and removes the
traditional boundaries and restrictions of print media. On the Web, your
giveaway can become part of an interactive trivia quiz with questions that
change dynamically each time the page is visited. You can even create an
interactive treasure hunt with clues scattered throughout your Web site.
The Web allows you to conduct other types of promotions as well, such
as online games that give something away to participants with the best
scores. With an online game, contestants get to have fun while trying to win
prizes. Online games can range from simple puzzles and teasers to actual
video games programmed in Java or another programming language.
Using a giveaway, contest, or sweepstakes to increase traffic at your Web
site is a good idea, but it’s definitely not the only reason to give things
away. By using a giveaway, contest, or sweepstakes, you can also:

Build awareness for your products and services.

Familiarize readers with other areas of your Web site.

Build a profile of your readers based on a survey or questionnaire
that is part of the submission form.
Later in this session, you’ll learn about different types of giveaways and
contests that you might want to use in your promotional efforts. These
include:

Free-for-all giveaways and sweepstakes.

Contests for artists, writers, and other creative people.

Trivia quizzes, games, puzzles, and teasers.
Although giveaways and contests are great for increasing your Web traffic,
the actual amount of traffic increase you see at your Web site will depend
on what you are giving away and how well you promote the giveaway.
Keep in mind that they key to success isn’t so much what you give away,
but how you give it away. If your hook is great, your giveaway or contest
SUNDAY MORNING  Attracting the Masses

will attract the masses. To help you promote your giveaway or contest, this
book will introduce you to Web sites that specialize in freebies, giveaways,
and contests. After all, people need to find your giveaway or contest in
order to participate.
Free Samples
One point to keep in mind when giving stuff away is that you do not
have to give away a full copy of your product to satisfy people’s never-
ending appetite for free stuff. Many times free samples will do quite
nicely. Giving away free samples can save you money while still giving
you the opportunity to show your visitors how good your product is. Of
course, if giving away free samples means mailing visitors your products,
you may need to require visitors to pay postage and handling. Otherwise,
giving away free samples may be cost prohibitive.
If, however, you are selling software programs, your sample might be a
smaller demo version of your product, which you can distribute via e-
mail (giving you the opportunity to further promote your Web site).
Likewise, if your product is an online service, you might provide a week
of free access to your online service.
Give Away the Junk in Your Closet
What if you don’t have any expensive prizes or free samples to give away?
One really good source of free stuff that you may want to consider is to
use the things that you no longer want or need that are currently taking
up space in your closets, attic, and garage. Just because these things no
longer hold any value for you does not mean that others won’t anxiously
want to get their hands on them. Be creative!
Free Articles
If you have a knack for writing, you may want to consider using this skill
as another means of driving traffic to your Web site. By writing short arti-
cles on subjects that are of interest to your target audience and providing
free access to copies of those articles on your Web site, you can bring in
198
Increase Your Web Traffic In a Weekend, Sixth Edition

droves of readers. Once you have written your articles, you might let
everybody know about them by posting an entry in a newsgroup. When
visitors show up at your Web pages to get copies of your articles, you can
take the opportunity to prompt them to join your mailing list and
encourage them to bookmark and visit the rest of your Web site.
Free Advertising on Your Web Site
Another freebie you can give away that will cost you absolutely nothing
is free advertising on your Web site. You might, for example, offer a day
or week of free advertising. You can bet that people will show up to make
sure that their advertising has been posted on their assigned day or week,
and their friends may show up as well.
Free T-shirts and Bumper Stickers
If you can afford it, you might want to consider giving away free t-shirts
or bumper stickers with your URL on it. This way, your contest and
sweepstakes winners will turn into walking and driving billboards, adver-
tising your Web site wherever they go.
Creating your own custom t-shirt or bumper sticker is easier than you
might think. You can even do it online. For example, the following Web
sites will be happy to you help you create your own custom t-shirt with
prices starting at less than $10:

Likewise, the following Web sites specialize in the creation of custom
bumper stickers. Prices vary, depending on how many you purchase,
ranging from one bumper sticker for $3.00 to 100 bumper stickers for
$100:

What to Watch Out For: The Legalities
Although nothing builds traffic like a good giveaway or contest, there are
many things you should consider before you get started. Your primary
concern should be the legal ramifications of publishing your giveaway or
contest on the Web.
By putting your contest on the Web, you make it available to participants
throughout the world, which might make your contest subject to certain
laws. Every country has its own laws, and these laws often vary by region
within the country as well. For example, each state in the U.S. has its own
rules regarding giveaways and contests.
Before you publish your contest or distribute any information related to
your contest, you should check applicable federal, state, and local laws
regarding contests and giveaways. The best places to research global laws are
the Law Library of Congress ( http://www.loc.gov/law/index.php) and the
Guide to Law Online ( http://www.loc.gov/law/help/guide.php).
Disclaimers for Age and Residency
Because of the extreme diversity of international laws, most organizations
that run contests and giveaways restrict their promotions to specific coun-
tries. When you restrict your contest to a specific country or countries,
you should post a clear disclaimer along with any contest information.
The purpose of the disclaimer is to protect your interests and ensure that
you don’t accidentally violate the laws of another country.
If you’ve browsed Web sites that run contests or giveaways, you have
probably seen a disclaimer that says “U.S. and Canadian residents only”
or “U.S. residents only.” By restricting a contest to the U.S. and Canada,
or the U.S. only, you limit your liability—which is always a good idea.
Another thing to consider is the age of the participants. Because many
U.S. states require that participants in contests be at least 18 years old,
you should place an age restriction on the contest. You can blend the age
restriction right into your original disclaimer, such as “U.S. and Canadian
residents 18 and older only” or “U.S. residents 18 and older only.”
200
Increase Your Web Traffic In a Weekend, Sixth Edition

Granted, verifying a person’s age over the Internet is difficult; however,
clearly marking the age restriction can only serve your best interest.
Other Disclaimers
Generally, within the U.S. and Canada, your sweepstakes or giveaway
should be free, meaning that you shouldn’t require entrants to purchase
something in order to enter and win. In this way, your sweepstakes or
giveaway is truly giving something away for nothing. You should post a
clear disclaimer at the contest site notifying readers that no purchase is
necessary to enter the contest. An exception is a creative contest, such as
an art contest or writing contest, that charges an entry fee.
You should also publish a statement to ensure participants know that
local laws apply to the contest and that the contest is void where prohib-
ited. Voiding the contest where prohibited protects you from inadver-
tently violating the local laws.
Putting the Rules Together
Now that you have made a start on the rules for your contest or giveaway,
you should put these rules together in an official form that you can publish
on your Web site. In the official rules, you should spell out exactly what
you will be giving away and the value of the prizes. If you will be giving
away one Sony 19-inch TV valued at $399, specify this exactly.
After you’ve decided on the rules for your contest or giveaway, you should
publish them for the entire world to see. Ideally, you will place a summary
of the rules on all the contest pages and make the detailed rules available
with a hypertext link.
The following is an example set of rules for a fictitious contest called the
Happy Peacock Sweepstakes. As you read it, keep in mind that this is a
made-up example that serves only to illustrate some of the points made
in this section.

TIP

Boosting Traffic with Giveaways and Sweepstakes
Giveaways and sweepstakes are great for boosting traffic at your Web site.
Every day, thousands of people search the Web looking for the latest give-
aways and sweepstakes—and why not? They can win hats, T-shirts, books,
jewelry, trips, and much more, simply by filling out a form. Although
there is not much difference between a giveaway and a sweepstakes, the term
sweepstakes is often used when sponsors and advertisers donate prizes.
Creating a Giveaway or Sweepstakes
When you put together a giveaway or sweepstakes, remember that the
prizes themselves are not what attract readers as much as your execution.
As a matter of fact, you could give away T-shirts and get more visitors
than a site giving away trips to Europe.
Although the organization giving away trips to Europe would argue their
case heatedly, the reality is that a well-designed and well-promoted give-
away will be successful regardless of the prizes. Well-designed giveaways
and sweepstakes have a professional polish that makes them fun, easy to
enter, and visually appealing. Well-promoted giveaways and sweepstakes
are announced in all the right places, which includes key pages at your
Web site and Web guides that promote freebies.
You’ll learn all about guides that promote freebies shortly, under the heading “Sites That
Promote Your Freebies.”
The best giveaways and sweepstakes have a theme that helps sell people
on the idea of the giveaway or sweepstakes. If you are giving away trips,
it is not just a “trip,” but a “passport to adventure.” If you are giving away
cruises, it is not just a “cruise,” but “barefoot strolls along windswept
beaches, romantic dinners for two, and quiet, moonlit evenings topside.”

NOTE

After you decide on the type of giveaway or sweepstakes to run, consider
the prizes that you will award. As stated earlier, the prizes don’t have to be
extravagant, but they should be worth the time and effort it takes to enter
the contest. Additionally, entering the giveaway or sweepstakes should be
as easy as filling out an entry form that asks for contact information, such
as name, address, and phone number.
You might also want to add a questionnaire or survey to the entry form.
Questionnaires can help you learn more about the type of people who
visit your Web site. You can find out whether they use your products and
services. You can also learn about visitor preferences, such as their favorite
area within your Web site, or their interests.
Looking at an Actual Sweepstakes
A good case study for a well-designed and well-promoted sweepstakes is
Frommer’s monthly sweepstakes. The sweepstakes ties in with Frommer’s
travel magazine and books, and is a featured part of Arthur Frommer’s
Budget Travel Online Web site (see Figure 4.24). The sweepstakes has
sponsors who advertise on the contest pages and on the Web site. The
sweepstakes serves several purposes:

The sweepstakes builds traffic to the Web site by inviting visitors to
return to the site regularly. Prizes are given away regularly and visi-
tors must return to register each month.

The sweepstakes highlights sponsors by providing direct links to
the Web sites of the sponsors.

The sweepstakes entry form asks visitors to provide contact infor-
mation and to answer a questionnaire, which provides valuable 
geographic and demographic information that the publishers might
not be able to otherwise obtain.

Information entered by visitors is often sold to companies that are
interested in reaching this target audience. This sale can provide
secondary income for the company.
204
Increase Your Web Traffic In a Weekend, Sixth Edition

Never sell information without prior notification. If you plan to sell information gathered
through the sweepstakes, you should state this explicitly in the contest rules and in your
site’s privacy policy.
Frommer’s enhances the main sweepstakes entry form by adding input
fields that allow visitors to provide the e-mail addresses of up to 6 other
people who may be interested in the contest. The entry form also pro-
vides subscription fields that allow visitors to sign up for a number of
newsletters. All in all, it’s a well-rounded effort to invite visitor participa-
tion, collect visitor information, and increase Web traffic.
Gaining Readers with Contests
Contests reward people for their talents or creativity. Because contests
often require judging and extensive work on the part of the producer,
some contests charge a nominal fee, such as $5, to enter. Charging an

The secret is in the
presentation and
promotion.
NOTE

entry fee for something like a writing contest that offers prestige, publi-
cation, and cash rewards to the winners makes sense. Charging an entry
fee for a contest that is meant more for fun than to be a career builder
doesn’t make sense.
Running a Contest
Contests can be just as much fun for you as they are for the participants.
Your goal should be to use the contest to build traffic to your Web site.
Ideally, your contest will tie in to and promote your business, products,
and services. For example, developers of word processing applications
might want to sponsor a write-off for the most creative or bizarre adver-
tising gimmick for their product.
The type of contest that you run will depend largely on your interests. If
you are interested in comedy, you might want to have a contest that
rewards the funniest submissions. If you are interested in graphic design,
you might want to have a design contest. If you love poetry, you might
want to have a poetry contest.
To keep your contest as hassle-free as possible, you will want to decide on
the specific formats that are acceptable for submissions. For a writing or
poetry contest, you might want to specify in the rules that all submissions
must be saved as standard ASCII text files with a .txt file extension. Sim-
ilarly, for a design or art contest, you might want to specify that all sub-
missions must be saved in either PNG or JPEG format.
Additionally, any time you ask for creative submissions, you should set
limits on the size or length of entries. For a writing contest, you might want
to limit entries to 5,000 words. For a design contest, you might want to
limit the size of artwork to 1280  1024, with a file size of less than 2MB.
After you decide on the type of contest you want to run, you need to
think about how you will judge the contest. Most small contests are
judged exclusively by the contest developer. Creative contests, such as
writing, art, or design contests, are usually voted on by a panel of judges.
206
Increase Your Web Traffic In a Weekend, Sixth Edition

Alternatively, you can remove yourself from the judging process entirely
by letting visitors to your Web site vote for the best submission. The
bottom line is that your judging process should be fair yet manageable
using your current resources.
As with giveaways, you can use an entry form to accept submission for
the contest, and you might want to add a questionnaire to the entry form
as well. Keep in mind that if you run a creative contest, many participants
will have their entry in separate text or graphic files. Currently, the easiest
way to submit files is as an attachment to an e-mail message. For this
reason, you might simply want to supply an e-mail address for submis-
sion rather than use an entry form.
You should state explicitly how many times visitors can enter and how many times they
can win. Put this information in the official rules. For example, if visitors can enter only
once and win only one prize, state this as a contest rule.
With creative works, you must consider one more thing: U.S. and inter-
national copyright law. Creative works are the property of the creator
unless the rights are granted or sold. Thus if you plan to publish the
winning works at your Web site, you need permission, and you should
ask for this permission right in the entry form. The minimum rights that
you will want to retain are one-time world-electronic rights to the
winning entries. Furthermore, you should state that winning entries will
be published at your Web site.
Looking at an Actual Contest
An example of a Web site that uses contests to promote itself and its prod-
ucts is iWon (www.iwon.com), shown in Figure 4.25. The Words “I”
and “Won” have a wonderful ring that describes the site’s theme. The idea
behind the site is to attract visitors with the promise of a chance to win
great sums of cash. The entire theme of the Web site is built around the
contests being offered rather than the products being advertised.
SUNDAY MORNING  Attracting the Masses
207
TIP

iWon takes the contest site concept to a new level, making it possible for
visitors to win huge amounts of money just by visiting the site. Every-
where you look there are graphical and text links trying to lead you to
other areas of the Web site. These links and graphics are reminders that
the site has more to offer and that the real goal is to sell you something.
Using Games, Puzzles, and Teasers to Attract
Visitors
Games, puzzles, and teasers can bring in the masses simply because they
are entertaining. People of all ages love to play games that are challeng-
ing, fun, or stimulating. Games, puzzles, and teasers are good ways to
keep visitors coming back to your Web site again and again. Many game
sites take game playing to another level by offering additional incentives,
such as prizes. In this way, the game sites make a good thing better by
rewarding people for playing. When rewards are involved, you can bet

that visitors will come back again and again. Keep in mind that your prize
doesn’t have to be anything of monetary value. You could simply publish
the winner’s name prominently on your home page, grant the winner a
free home page, or something else that doesn’t really cost you anything.
Use your games, puzzles, and teasers as an opportunity to encourage Tell-a-Friend viral
marketing by prominently displaying a button or link that opens the visitor’s e-mail
application and encourages them to send a preformatted message about your product,
service, or Web site to a friend or colleague.
Creating a Game, Puzzle, or Teaser
When you think of games, you probably imagine the zippy video games
you see in the arcades. You could certainly spend months programming a
truly awesome game for your Web site, like the folks at Cartoon Network
(www.cartoonnetwork.com), as shown in Figure 4.26. However, some
of the best games are those that are simple and compulsively playable.
Most card games, such as poker or solitaire, aren’t popular because of rip-
roaring action; they are popular because they are easy to learn yet chal-
lenging to play.
One game to consider is a treasure hunt. Treasure hunts are really popular
during the holidays, especially at Easter. In a treasure hunt, you hide clues
or treasures throughout your Web site and sometimes at participating
Web sites. You can display clues or treasures directly on your Web pages
using text and graphics. You can also link standardized treasure icons to
secret pages at your Web site that describe an item in the treasure hunt.
With a treasure hunt, you need a submission page that lets participants
submit a list of all clues or treasures they’ve collected. Usually, prizes in a
treasure hunt are awarded to the participants who find all the treasures
first. To ensure fair play, you might want to periodically change the clues
and treasures during the hunt.
SUNDAY MORNING  Attracting the Masses
209
TIP

A trivia quiz is another game that is a lot of fun and easy to produce.
Although trivia quizzes cover any topic, you might want to link the quiz
to the theme or topic of your Web site. The best trivia quizzes have at
least five challenging questions to which participants can get answers
immediately. To keep visitors coming back, you might want to make the
trivia quiz a weekly or monthly feature.
If you are giving away prizes on a trivia quiz, you can post answers with
a list of winners at a later date. Because many people might know the
answers to your trivia questions, you really don’t want to award prizes to
everyone who submits the right answers. Instead, you might want to
award prizes randomly from the list of participants who submitted the
right answers.
Another type of game to consider is a puzzle. The best puzzles are word-
based brainteasers, such as a crossword puzzle or a word association game.
210

Figure 4.26
Cartoon Network
provides free access
to professional-
quality online
computer games.

With a puzzle, you will probably want to reward participants simply for
playing and submitting their answers.
A great way to build steady traffic with a puzzle is to change the puzzle
often and award prizes randomly to the participants who answer a certain
number of puzzles correctly in a given period of time. For example, you
can publish a different puzzle every week and award prizes randomly to
anyone who gets the answer to four different puzzles in a particular month.
Finding Free Online Games to Add to Your Web
Pages
There are a number of Web sites where you can go to find free games that
you can add to your Web site. For example, you’ll find a free version of a
JavaScript-based hangman game at hangman.bappy.com. Figure 4.27
shows how the game will look when a visitor starts it from your Web site.

Another site where you can find an assortment of free JavaScript games is
javascript.internet.com. All you have to do is add the free JavaScript
code to your Web pages to get these games up and running.
Looking at an Actual Treasure Hunt
Museum Mania (www.museummania.com) features a number of online
treasure hunts (see Figure 4.28). The goal of the treasure hunt is to follow
a set of clues located at the links embedded in your questions. Once you
find the items referenced in the clues, you can submit an entry to see how
well you did.
Before visitors submit their answers to any of the many treasure hunts,
they are asked to submit information about themselves, including their
name, age, school, and city. Museum Mania is able to use this informa-
tion to track detailed statistics related to the contest participants. These
statistics are used to determine the effectiveness of the Web site’s effort to
interest young people in learning more about history.

Sites That Promote Your Freebies
You need to promote your giveaway, contest, or sweepstakes to make it
successful. Although your promotion efforts should definitely begin at key
areas within your Web site, you should also promote the contest through
guides and directories that specialize in freebies.
In this section, you will find a brief review of some of the most popular
contest directories. When you submit your freebie to a contest directory,
be sure to provide the URL to the main contest page and a brief descrip-
tion of the contest. The contest description should specify when the
contest ends as well as any age and residency requirements.
Promoting Your Freebie at TheFreeSite.com
TheFreeSite.com (www.thefreesite.com) is an extensive guide to just
about everything that is free on the Web. Features in the catalog include free
games, services, samples, screen savers, newsletters, and so on (see Figure
4.29).

own Web site. Be sure to include the URL to your freebie page, a descrip-
tion for the contest, the contest’s start and end dates, and any other
requirements.
Other Places to Promote Your Freebies
With thousands of organizations giving away freebies, it’s no surprise
there are dozens of Web guides to free stuff. Other freebie guides that you
might want to submit a listing to include Free-n-Cool, ContestGuide,
FreebieList, and 1FreeStuffSite.
Free-n-Cool (www.free-n-cool.com) is a guide to everything on the Web
that is free and—per the judgment of the site’s creators—cool. The guide
is divided into several key sections, including New Totally Free Stuff,
New Almost-Free Stuff, New Contests and Giveaways, and New Cool
Sites (see Figure 4.30). To promote your contest or giveaway, check out
the New Totally Free Stuff and New Almost-Free Stuff sections. The dis-
tinction here is between outright giveaways and contests that award prizes
to participants.
You can submit your freebie to Free-n-Cool by sending e-mail to linkrequest
@free-n-cool.com. If you want to increase your chances of getting listed or
being more prominently listed, add a link on your page to Free-n-Cool. 
ContestGuide.com (www.contestguide.com) is a fairly comprehensive
guide to contests. This site has a unique focus in that it organizes listings
according to how often you can enter a contest (see Figure 4.31). It has
listings for contests that let you enter one time only, daily, weekly, and
monthly. You can submit a listing to ContestGuide by filling out the sub-
mission form at www.contestguide.com/webmasters.html.

Other Ideas for Attracting the Masses
Just in case you don’t feel that you have enough ideas on your list to help
your Web site attract more attention, here are a few more. These ideas are
targeted at adding more content to your Web pages in order to encour-
age repeat traffic.
Providing a Tip of the Day
One idea that you can use to keep your visitors coming back over and
over again is to create a Tip of the Day (or week). If your tips offer really
useful information, your visitors will return to learn more. In addition, by
offering tips, you position yourself as a subject matter expert on whatever
topic you are covering. For example, the folks at WUGNET
(www.wugnet.com) encourage repeat traffic by providing a computing
tip of the day, as shown in Figure 4.34.
SUNDAY MORNING  Attracting the Masses

Of course, you’ll need to set aside enough time and effort to really make
your Tip of the Day worth coming back to. If you are willing to put forth
the effort, your tips may help you build up a steady following.
Adding External Content to Your Web Pages
For whatever reason, people like to participate in short surveys or polls
that cover topics of interest to them. For example, at www.vote.com, you
will find a new political poll each day. People who are interested in poli-
tics and current events enjoy going to Vote.com just to express their opin-
ions on a given survey question and to see how their opinions stack up
with other people’s opinions.
Your poll doesn’t have to be very long. A single well-formed true/false or
multiple choice question will do just fine. For example, take a look at Figure
4.35, which shows a typical poll posted each day on www.foxnews.com.

Figure 4.36. Here you’ll find everything you need to put a poll (for up to
50 respondents) on your Web site and to provide instant results. If the

larger audiences.

Setting Up a Survey
Coming up with fresh content every day may represent more of an effort
than you have time to commit to. If this is the case, then you should inves-
tigate opportunities for posting other people’s content on your Web site.
Newspapers have been doing this for years, with columns like Dear Abby
and comics like the Family Circle. You can travel to any major city in the
U.S. and pick up a newspaper and expect to find both of these resources.
Well, you can do the same thing on your Web site. For example, let’s say
that you want to add a little lighthearted humor. You could certainly sit
down once a day and draw your own funny cartoon. But what do you do
when you don’t have the time or cannot come up with a funny new idea?
The answer might be to sign up at Etoon.com (www.etoon.com) for the
free daily cartoon service, as shown in Figure 4.37. 
All you have to do to get up and running is fill in a form at
http://www.etoon.com/cartoon-store/free-cartoons.php. You’ll receive
an e-mail with a little HTML to add to one of your Web pages, and you’ll
be ready to go.

Generating Repeat Visits with a What’s New Page
Sometimes people will return to your Web site after having been away for
a while just to see what’s new and different. However, if your main page
has not changed since their last visit, these folks may assume that nothing
else has changed and click on their browser’s Back button, leaving as
quickly as they arrived. One way of avoiding the loss of this type of visitor
is to add and prominently display a link to a What’s New page.
Your What’s New page does not have to be anything too fancy. It could
be something as simple as a short series of links to recently updated Web
pages at your site along with a brief description of what has changed. The
important thing is to let visitors know that you have new information and
content for them to look at. You might also want to post dates beside each
entry on your What’s New page so that your visitors can quickly ascertain
if anything has changed since their last visit.
Keep Your Visitors Informed with a Calendar 
of Events
Another great tool for generating return visits is to post a calendar on
your Web site that informs your visitors of upcoming events. This way,
they know that if they return in the future on a date specified, that some-
thing new will be waiting for them. This might be the release of a new
product or a new set of Web pages covering a particular subject of inter-
est. Regardless, the point is to give your visitors a reason for returning.
While you can certainly create and post your own calendar pages on your
Web site, an easy way to do so with minimal effort is to look for and take
advantage of free calendaring services. One such service is the online 
calendar service provided by Bravenet (www.bravenet.com), shown in
Figure 4.38. This free service lets you create calendars with daily, weekly,
or monthly views. It lets you post messages and, if you want, will also post
entries representing major holidays. You can even set up calendars on which
your visitors can post entries.
SUNDAY MORNING  Attracting the Masses

To take advantage of the calendar service provided by Bravenet, you will
need to sign up for a free Bravenet account and then fill out a simple form,
specifying a calendar title and the URL to which your visitors should be
directed when they click on the calendar’s built-in Return to Home Page
link. Once you have finished filling out the form, you’ll be given some
HTML statements to copy and paste onto one of your Web pages. Once
created, you can customize the appearance of your calendar by adding
graphics in order to make the calendar look like it is a part of your Web
site.
Reward Loyal Visitors with a Members Only Area
As your Web site begins to catch on and gain a following, you will begin
to get repeat visitors. One way to keep those visitors coming back is to
create a members only area and restrict access to just those visitors who
register or who meet certain criteria, such as spending a certain amount
of money in a given month.
222

Figure 4.38

One way to set up a members only area is to password protect the main
page for the area of your Web site that you want to restrict access to, and
then assign passwords to visitors who register for access to the pages (via
a form or by e-mail). Begin by checking with your Web host to see if a
password protect service is provided as part of your service agreement. If
one is not, then check out www.bravenet.com/webtools/passwd. This
free service lets you password protect any Web page by embedding a little
HTML that is provided to you. You have full control over the number of
accounts that you want to be able to access your password-protected page.
You can even view visitor statistics that show you who is accessing your
page and how many times they have done so.
Setting Up Your Own Affiliate Program
One way to increase your Web traffic is to solicit others to help bring
traffic to your site. You can do this by setting up your own affiliate
program. Affiliate programs have been around on the Web since 1996
when Amazon.com started offering a commission-based sales program
(see Figure 4.39).
SUNDAY MORNING  Attracting the Masses
223
Figure 4.39
Amazon.com runs

oldest and most
successful affiliate
programs.

In addition to helping you sell your products or services, an affiliate program
can help to strengthen your search engine ranking because of the links
that each of your affiliates will place on their Web pages back to your site.
There are many different types of affiliate programs out there. Some, like
Amazon.com’s, are commission based. Others, such as eBay, pay a flat fee
whenever an affiliate brings in a new customer or a returning customer
that makes a bid or purchase (see Figure 4.40).
Other affiliate programs are click-through based, like Google’s AdSense
program (see Figure 4.41). In this program, Google displays text- and
graphic-based content on affiliate Web pages that are deliberately
matched up to provide complementary content to the subject covered on
affiliate Web pages.
224
Increase Your Web Traffic In a Weekend, Sixth Edition
Figure 4.40
Some affiliate
programs, like
eBay’s, pay

To create your own affiliate program, you will need to create a process for
accepting and processing new affiliate applications, come up with eye-
catching graphics and links, and develop a system for making payments
based on results. To set up something like this from scratch can be a
daunting task. Fortunately, there are a number of online affiliate program
services that can help you get your affiliate program going. One such Web
site is AffiliateShop (www.affiliateshop.com), shown in Figure 4.42. This
service won’t be free, though. At the time that the sixth edition of this
book was written, AffiliateShop was charging a $45 monthly service fee.
For this fee you get the HTML you need to add to your Web page, along
with all kinds of other goodies, like ad tracking, support for an unlimited
number of affiliates, and support for a tiered commission system.

Sponsoring a Web Site Launch
No matter how long your Web site has been around, it’s never too late to
spruce it up a little bit and re-launch it. There’s no better way to get the
ball rolling than to host your own Web site launch. To make your launch
successful, you need to spread the word. Not only this, but you need to
coordinate your various Web site invitations/announcements so that they
all take effect in plenty of time to notify everyone. This means getting
your information posted on What’s New? sites, updating your banners,
sending out your newsletters, posting your invitations in newsgroups,
updating your Facebook page, and getting your email campaign all going
at the same time.
Your Web site launch shouldn’t be too different from the types of
launches that you see businesses and stores do all the time. For example,
you might want to set up a contest or give something away to the first 10
people who register.

Free Banner Advertising: No Joke
If you have browsed the Web, you have probably seen hundreds of
banners. The banner is the most frequently used advertising method on
the Web. A typical banner ad is placed at the top or bottom of a Web page
so that it can catch the viewer’s eye and possibly prompt the viewer to
click on it. Most advertisers pay thousands of dollars to display a banner
ad. Why pay thousands of dollars, though, when you can advertise for
free? By becoming a member of a banner exchange, you can advertise at
thousands of member Web sites without spending a dime—no joke.
What the Heck Is a Banner Exchange?
Ever since the first one sprang onto the scene in 1996, banner exchanges
have spread like wildfire. Most banner exchanges have a broad focus that
allows just about any type of banner advertising. There are also specialty
banner exchanges that focus on specific communities of interest, such as
travel Web sites.
You can think of a banner exchange as a cooperative advertising program
in which participants work together to advertise each other’s Web sites,
products, or services using banner advertising. The amount of free adver-
tising you receive is directly related to the amount of advertising you give
to other participants.
Although cooperative advertising isn’t exactly a new concept, it is defi-
nitely a breakthrough for anyone who wants to get his or her Web site
noticed. Because most banner exchanges have a network of thousands of
participants, you can use the exchange to promote your Web site, prod-
ucts, and services to a massive and extremely diverse audience.
SUNDAY MORNING  Attracting the Masses
227

How Do Banner Exchanges Work?
The wonderful thing about banner exchanges is that the exchange is
responsible for managing the network. To accomplish this, most
exchanges have a banner management system that tracks when and where
banners are displayed throughout the network. Every time you display
the banner of another member, you receive a credit. Based on these
credits, the management system ensures that your banner is displayed at
other sites in the network.
If you had to manually edit your Web pages to change banners, the
banner exchange wouldn’t be of much use. Fortunately, the banner man-
agement system is responsible for rotating the banners as well. To enable
automatic banner rotation, exchange members are given a section of
HTML code that allows the management system to dynamically update
banners when the page is loaded. The code snippet also includes an
account number that allows the management system to track where and
when a banner is displayed and to give credit appropriately.
An added benefit of the banner exchange is the ability to track and view
the performance statistics for your banner. Depending on the banner
exchange, your performance statistics can range from up-to-the-minute
accounting to weekly account summaries. Either way, the stats usually tell
you how many times your banner was displayed as well as how many
times someone clicked on your banner. Generally, you will need to visit
the banner exchange to view the stats.
In Web lingo, the word impression describes the instances in which your
banner is displayed. The number of times that someone clicks on your
banner is called the click through. When you divide the total click through
by the total impressions, you come up with a click-through ratio. Some
banner exchanges use the click-through ratio to determine the effective-
ness of your banner advertising.
228
Increase Your Web Traffic In a Weekend, Sixth Edition

To get a better understanding of click-through ratios, consider the fol-
lowing examples:

Joe’s home page displays a banner ad at the top of the page. Last
week 5,000 people visited Joe’s home page and 150 clicked on the
banner ad. Joe’s click-through ratio was 3% (150 / 5000 = .03).

Ziggy’s White Pages display banner ads at the top and bottom of
every page. Last week 25,000 people visited the site and there were
a total of 100,000 page views (with 200,000 total impressions).
Banners were clicked on 5,000 times. Ziggy’s click-through rate for
all ads was 2.5% (5,000 / 200,000 = .025).
Exchanging Your Banner
Before you can participate in a banner exchange, you must become a
member, which usually involves filling out detailed contact information
on yourself, your Web site, and your business. You are also asked ques-
tions about the type of material you publish at your Web site and the
types of sites that can be promoted at your site. Although most banner
exchanges unanimously prohibit promoting explicit or offensive Web
sites, a rating system usually is in place that covers everything from kids-
only sites to sites for mature audiences.
The purpose of the rating system is to protect the interests of the
exchange members. After all, if your Web site is for kids, you don’t want
someone to display a banner that is directed at adults. By the same token,
you might not want to display advertising for kids at your adult-oriented
Web site.
After you complete the membership process, you will be given a section
of HTML code that you can add to any pages at your Web site. The
purpose of this code is to display the banner advertising of other exchange
members. Your unique account number for the exchange is a part of the
HTML code. For this reason, you should copy the code that the exchange
gives you and paste it directly into your Web pages without making any
changes.
SUNDAY MORNING  Attracting the Masses
229

230
Increase Your Web Traffic In a Weekend, Sixth Edition
Because you receive a credit each time someone views a banner advertise-
ment at your Web site, your first instinct might be to add the banner code
to every page at your Web site. Instead, consider limiting your banner
placement in well-visited areas of your Web site and primarily on top-level
pages. You shouldn’t inundate visitors with advertising or make them wait
for banners to load on every page.
Banner exchanges have many checks and balances in place to ensure that the exchange
system is fair. For example, exchanges typically prohibit the use of more than one banner
from a single exchange on a single page. In most cases, however, nothing stops you from
putting banners from other exchanges on a single page.
After you receive the banner code, the next step is to submit your banner
to the exchange. Most exchanges have a form that you can use to submit
your banner. Otherwise, you might have to send your banner to the
exchange as an e-mail attachment.
Creating a Banner Advertisement
The banner exchange process starts with creating a banner to be displayed
at other Web sites. Your banner doesn’t have to be designed by a profes-
sional but should entice people to read it and click on it. Catchy graph-
ics can attract the viewer’s eye as much as the information. Including
useful information is also key to a successful banner, especially when the
file size of your banner is limited by the banner exchange.
If you want to work with multiple banner exchanges, you should note the limits of file
and image sizes for each. Then you should design your banner with these limits in mind.
By resizing your banner to fit the requirements of each exchange, you can use the same
banner repeatedly.
NOTE
TIP

Selecting a Banner Exchange
No two banner exchanges are the same. When you select a banner
exchange, you need to look past the gilded doorways that say you can
promote your Web site for free. Instead, look into the heart of the
exchange’s management system.
Banner exchanges use what is called an exchange ratio to indicate the
display-to-credit ratio offered by the exchange. The most common
exchange ratio is 2 to 1. If an exchange has a 2 to 1 ratio, this means that
for every two times that someone views a banner on your Web site, your
banner will be displayed at a member site one time.
A quick check of the math tells you that, at an exchange ratio of 2 to 1,
half of the impressions are going somewhere other than to banner
exchange members. Here is where sponsorship comes into the picture. To
make up for the costs of running the exchange, most banner exchanges
sell the additional space to sponsors. With the average banner exchange
racking up millions of impressions every day, a 2 to 1 exchange ratio has
a pretty hefty profit margin.
Beyond the exchange ratio, you should look at the features of the
exchange’s banner management system. Everything that you do at an
exchange should be handled through a password-protected account. Stan-
dard features of the account should be to view your current statistics,
modify your account profile, and submit a banner. What’s more, you
should be able to access any of these features directly at the exchange’s Web
site, and the management system should handle updates automatically.
Some exchanges offer additional features, such as targeting. With target-
ing you can select the specific categories of Web sites that will display
your banner and, often, the categories of banners displayed at your own
Web site. In this way, your banner is seen only by audiences that you
select, which includes audiences that are interested in products, services,
or information similar to what you offer at your Web site.
SUNDAY MORNING  Attracting the Masses
231

Finally, you should look at the total membership of the exchange and 
the throughput of the exchange’s Web connection. Throughput refers to the
transfer rate between the server and the client computers. Together, the
number of members and the throughput can suggest an average through-
put, which in turn tells you how long your visitors will wait for banner
ads to display. For example, a banner exchange with 25,000 member sites
and a T1 connection to the Web is probably overloaded. As a result, vis-
itors to your Web site might experience longer-than-normal delays while
the banner loads.
Without getting into specific measurement criteria, one way to check the
performance of a banner exchange is simply to visit pages of current
members and see how long banners take to load. To get a solid assessment,
you should check on several different days and at different times of day.
Keep in mind that peak usage times are typically during the week and
specifically at midday.
Banner Exchanges for the Masses
Now that you know the ins and outs of banner swapping, you are ready to
take the next step and join the exchanges of your choice. To help you on
your way, this section lists some of the most popular banner exchanges.

LinkBuddies (www.linkbuddies.com) manages an exchange service con-
sisting of more than 50,000 member sites (see Figure 4.43). It supports
targeted advertising with over 150 categories. Although targeted advertis-
ing is one of the key reasons for the success of LinkBuddies, the exchange
has many other features that make it a winner.
LinkBuddies offers a 2 to 1 exchange ratio to its members. When other
member banners are not displayed, the exchange displays its own banner
as well as the banners of paid sponsors. LinkBuddies provides detailed
reporting, including hourly, daily, and monthly data.

Analyzing Off-Page Factors
The major search engines have had plenty of time to figure out various
ways of dealing with spamming techniques employed by less than scrupu-
lous Web site publishers. Part of the arsenal employed by search engines
is off-page ranking analysis.
What makes off-page factors attractive to search engines is that Web site
publishers have very little ability to manipulate them. One of the major
off-page factors is link analysis. Using link analysis, search engines gauge
a Web page’s relevance by examining both the number of links to the Web
page and the quality of those links. Quality, in this context, refers to the
ranking of the Web pages that provide the links. The higher ranked a
Web page is, the higher the quality of its link.
Another off-page analysis tool employed by search engines is click-through
analysis. In click-through analysis, the search engine counts the number
of times that Web surfers click on a link when presented with it (com-
pared to links for competing Web sites).

Building a Strong Ranking through Links
Increasing the ranking of your Web page should be a major goal of your
Web site promotion plans. One way to do this is to contact other Web
sites and ask them to trade links with your Web site. To come up with a
list of sites to contact, open up your Web browser, visit one of your pre-
ferred search engines, and then do a search using your keywords and keyword
phrases. Make a list of the top Web sites that appear in the results.
Getting links from quality Web sites is one of the keys to improving your
own Web site’s ranking. So rather than trying to get every Tom, Dick, and
Harry to trade links with you, focus on the top sites that show up in your
search engine results. Since many of the sites that will appear in your search
results may be direct competitors, they may not take you up on your offer
to exchange links. However, if you are lucky, some Web sites will agree (in
order to try and increase their own ranking).
Of course, just because you find other Web site owners who say that they
will exchange links with you, that doesn’t mean that they will hold up
their end of the bargain. So, from time to time you will want to check on
these Web sites and send an e-mail to their owners if you don’t see a link
to your Web site. Alternatively, you might want to check out Link Checker
Pro (www.link-checker-pro.com). Link Checker Pro is a software program
that you can download, install, and then configure to automate the
process of checking on the status of all your reciprocal links.
Avoiding Link Farms
Be careful to make sure that in your enthusiasm to improve your Web
page’s rankings you don’t get caught up in a link farm scam. A link farm
is a large group of Web pages created for the sole purpose of trying to
trick search engines into increasing the Web page’s ranking. While it is
perfectly legitimate to exchange links with other Web sites (which is one
of the basic principles that makes the Web work), it is not at all proper to
set up Web pages just so you can establish links with them to your real
Web site.
SUNDAY MORNING  Attracting the Masses

Increasing Your Traffic with Web Rings
One of the problems with looking for information on the Web by per-
forming keyword searches using search engines is that the results usually
include superfluous and unrelated links. You must sift through any super-
fluous results to get to the Web sites that actually contain the type of
information that is being looked for.
Directories offer an alternative to search engines. One particular and
popular type of directory that more and more Web surfers are turning to
is Web rings. A Web ring is a free service that organizes related Web sites
into groups based on common subject matter.
What makes Web rings popular is that, once a site in the ring is found
that contains the type of information a Web surfer likes, there is a really
good chance that the rest of the Web sites in the ring will also be exactly
what the Web surfer is looking for.
How Do Web Rings Work?
Web rings are organized into major categories, each of which contains
any number of subcategories. Drill down far enough, and you will find
individual Web rings. Each Web ring is started by an individual owner. It
is up to the owner to accept or reject requests by Web site owners to join
the Web ring. Each Web site in the Web ring contains navigational con-
trols for moving around in the ring, as demonstrated in Figure 4.45.
A central Web ring server controls Web ring navigation. This server pre-
vents dead ends from breaking the ring by automatically forwarding a
Web surfer on to the next available Web site in a ring.
Working with the Major Web Rings
There are currently two major Web rings:

WebRing: http://dir.webring.com/rw

RingSurf: www.ringsurf.com
236
Increase Your Web Traffic In a Weekend, Sixth Edition

RingSurf and WebRing are both 100% free. To join a ring, you just sign
up with the hosting Web ring service and fill out a request form. If the
Web ring owner approves, you will be sent a little HTML along with
instructions on what to do with it. If you don’t see a ring that covers your
topic, you can start up your own ring. However, you’ll have to find four
other Web sites to join your ring before the hosting Web ring services will
add your Web ring to its directory listings.
Post Company Job Openings on Your Web Site
If the Web site that you are promoting belongs to a company, you can
increase Web traffic by posting job openings on your Web site. Nothing
gets people’s attention like the prospect of finding a good-paying job.
Once people interested in your line of work learn that your Web site
includes job postings, they will keep coming back week after week
looking for the perfect job. Better yet, they’ll share your Web site with
their friends and co-workers. Even if your visitors never find a job with
you, they may turn into your best customers and provide you with all
kinds of viral marketing referrals.

Short on Time? Try Paid Inclusion
If you are in a hurry to get your Web site noticed and don’t have 4 to 6
weeks to wait for the major search engines and directories to get you listed,
you can always spend a few dollars and go with paid inclusion services.
Every major search engine accepts some sort of paid listing. This means
that within 1 to 2 days, your Web site could start appearing in the top
results for a search that uses your specified keywords.
Locating Sponsored Links
Google and other search engines like Yahoo! and Ask typically display
paid links at the top of the screen and along the right-hand side of their
search results, as demonstrated in Figure 4.46. To identify them even further,
paid results appearing at the top of the screen are usually displayed with
a different background color, whereas paid results on the right-hand side
of the screen are separated from the rest of the results by a vertical bar. In
addition, both areas usually display a label like “Sponsored Links,” “Sponsor
Results,” or something similar.
238
Increase Your Web Traffic In a Weekend, Sixth Edition
Figure 4.46
Search engines use
various techniques
to help make 
their paid listings
stand out.

Google AdWords
Google administers its paid listings through its AdWords program
(adwords.google.com). Paid listings will also appear on some of the sites
that retrieve results from Google, including AOL and Ask. This program
charges customers a per-click fee, meaning that you only have to pay when
somebody actually clicks on your paid link (as opposed to simply seeing
it). As of the time that the sixth edition of the book was written, there is a
one-time $5 activation fee, and you are required to pay a maximum 10-cent
per-click fee. For $50, you ought to be able to get a good 4 to 6 weeks’
worth of advertising. 
By the end of this 4 to 6 week period, your free search engine and directory listings
should start to appear, and you might then want to stop paying for this service.
Yahoo! Search Marketing
While Google AdWords represents the biggest bang for your advertising
dollars, Yahoo! provides an attractive second choice. Yahoo! refers to a
paid inclusion as a sponsored search. You can sign up for Yahoo!’s program
at advertisingcentral.yahoo.com/smallbusiness/ysm. Yahoo! requires a
$30 initial deposit and there is no monthly spending requirement. Again,
just as with Google’s AdWords program, you only pay when someone
actually clicks on your paid links. And you can count on your listing
appearing in the search results of other search engines. For example, in
the case of Yahoo!, you could expect to see your listing appear in
AltaVista.
Other Paid Inclusion Programs
While Google and Yahoo! may be the two most popular paid inclusion
programs, there are plenty of other good programs out there that can help
you reach an even larger audience.

search engines. In addition, the major metasearch engines also accept
paid listings.
Keep ’Em Coming Back
Have you ever visited a Web site that contained some incredibly useful or
entertaining content, only to realize a few days later that you have no idea
how to get back? Perhaps you can’t remember the full URL or the Web
site’s name. Surely, this is something that has happened to everybody a
time or two.
Given that every major Web browser has a bookmarking capability, there
is no reason why anyone should ever lose track of an important Web site.
Still, it happens all the time, and it is not always the Web surfer’s fault.
Much of the time this predicament could be averted if only the Web site
owner would place a friendly reminder on his or her Web page. This
reminder need not be complex; it could be something as simple as a well-
placed piece of text that says, “Bookmark this page.” Figure 4.47 demon-
strates the application of this simple strategy at ComputerHope.com
(www.computerhope.com/startp.htm). 
Wrapping Up and Looking Ahead
Now that you know how to attract the masses to your Web site, it is time
to take a look at who’s visiting your Web site and how you can improve
it, which is exactly what you’ll learn in the next session. The first step to
understanding your site’s visitors is to examine your Web site’s statistics.
240
Increase Your Web Traffic In a Weekend, Sixth Edition

Web site statistics provide just about everything you need to determine
who is visiting your site and why. Once you know who’s visiting and why
they’re visiting, don’t forget to keep the pages and links at your site up to
date. Every visitor counts, especially when you are trying to increase
traffic to your Web site. You need to do everything within your power to
build a steady readership. To attract and maintain an audience over the
long haul, you need to maintain your site and provide visitors with life-
lines when you move or delete files.

our Web site’s statistics are the single most important means for
discovering what people really think about your Web site, and you
might be surprised when you discover which of your resources are
bringing in visitors, and which resources aren’t. If you’re tempted to pay
only cursory attention to this section, ask yourself this: What do I really
know about the flow of traffic to my Web site? How do I know which
pages are drawing visitors and which ones are being skipped? If you make
assumptions about your visitors that the stats don’t support, then your
lack of awareness could cost you dearly.
So settle in with a good cup of coffee or some juice to keep you alert—
it’s Sunday afternoon and time to roll. By the end of the afternoon, you’ll
know how to find out who is visiting your site and why. You’ll also know
how to use your Web site’s statistics to begin increasing your Web traffic.
Using Web Stats to Understand Your Site’s
Visitors
Web site stats tell you much more than which pages at your Web site
interest visitors. By tracking stats, you also learn many things about the
people who visit your Web site, such as how long they visit, whether they
really read the pages that you present or just skip on by, what days of the
week are the most popular, what time of day is the best time to make
updates, and a whole lot of other things.

For example, Web site statistics typically reveal:

How many people are visiting your Web site each day, week, and
month.

The type and versions of browsers being used by your visitors so
that you can determine which types of technologies are best
deployed. 

The IP address of each visitor, allowing you to discover where they
come from.

The time and date of each visit, allowing you to determine the best
time for making changes to your Web pages.

The keywords visitors are using to locate your Web site so that you
can fine-tune your keywords and keyword phrases.
You need to know who is being drawn to your Web site so that you can
keep them coming back for more and attract others like them. You need
to know about errors and other circumstances that could make your site
an obstacle course, which could prevent visitors from coming or staying.
You need to get your hands on some useful information so that you can
make informed decisions.
Traditional retailers have been tracking information about their cus-
tomers for a long time, using the information they gather to customize
their marketing and advertising plans. Likewise, online retailers and Web
sites do their best to track customer habits and to learn as much as possi-
ble about the likes and dislikes of the Web surfers who visit their sites.
Take Amazon.com for example. Amazon.com places a great deal of
emphasis on learning everything it can about each customer’s likes and
dislikes. By tracking individual habits, Amazon.com is able to create cus-
tomized Web pages that it thinks each customer will find helpful.
Amazon.com displays these custom pages as shown in Figure 5.1.

As Figure 5.1 shows, Amazon.com has created a customized page to
present merchandise that Amazon.com thinks may be of interest to Jerry
based on the information that has been collected on him. By tracking
visitor activity, Amazon.com is able to fine-tune the way it runs its Web
site in order to make it more successful. Similarly, you can begin collect-
ing and tracking user activity on your Web site. One way to do this is by
asking visitors to tell you something about themselves when they fill out
forms or send you e-mails in order to sign up for your contests, newslet-
ters, sweepstakes, and so on. Web site statistics can be just as valuable to
you when it comes to learning more about your visitors. Best of all, Web
site statistics allow you to collect data without depending on your visitors
to take the time to provide it to you. By collecting and analyzing Web site
stats, you empower yourself with information that you can use to make your
Web site a better place to visit. This effort will remove your site from the
ranks of hit-or-miss Web sites and give it the stamp of professionalism.

Options for Collecting Web Site Statistics
When it comes to collecting and analyzing Web site statistics, you have
two options: software based and on demand. With the software-based
option, you install an application on your Web server and use it to
process the contents of your Web server log files. With the on-demand
option, you sign up with a Web-based service that collects and presents
your Web traffic data. Perhaps the best, and certainly the most popular,
on-demand option is Google Analytics (www.google.com/analytics).
Which of these two options you decide to go with will depend on a number
of different factors.
Of course, depending on the service provider you are using, your options when it comes
to installing custom software may be limited. If your service provider is too restrictive,
the on-demand option is probably going to work best for you.
The software-based option works best when you want total control over
your Web site’s data. This option is viable when you have a talented IT
staff capable of running the software. This option requires that you pur-
chase a copy of the software, which involves a one-time cost. With this
option, you will also have to make sure that your Web server is capable of
accommodating the overhead of running the additional software. Other-
wise, you may need to upgrade or replace your Web server.
If you are paying an ISP to host your Web site, you may find that the ISP has already
purchased and installed Web site analysis software on the Web server, in which case you
may be able to use it for a small additional fee. 
On the other hand, if you are comfortable with allowing a third party to
collect and process your Web statistics, you may want to go with an on-
demand service, especially if you don’t have available in-house IT staff to
do the job. While this option avoids a potentially hefty one-time cost, it
NOTE
TIP

typically requires a monthly service fee. An exception to this is Google
Analytics, which is 100-percent free. Google Analytics is also different
from many other on-demand service offerings in that it is focused on
Web marketers as opposed to Webmasters. 
Whether you choose Google Analytics or one of the other on-demand services
discussed in this chapter, the primary advantage of on-demand Web mon-
itoring it that it allows you to get up and running almost immediately.
As you will see in the sections that follow, there are plenty of software 
programs that you can use to analyze your Web server’s log files. There is
no shortage of on-demand Web services either. In addition to software
and on-demand services that perform specialized tasks, there are also
companies that have developed versions of their Web site analysis tool
that you can either purchase as a stand-alone software program or sign up
and use as an on-demand Web service. Two of the best are Webtrends
(www.webtrends.com/Products/Analytics), as shown in Figure 5.2, and
Unica NetInsight (www.unica.com/products/enterprise-web-analytics.htm),
as shown in Figure 5.3.

Selecting Your Web Traffic Analysis Tool
Before continuing, you should install a Web traffic analyzer and locate your
server log files. Alternately, you should find and register with an on-demand
Web service that will collect and present your Web statistics to you.
If you choose to install Web site traffic analysis software on your Web
server, you will need to start by getting your hands on the software. In
addition to the Web site traffic analysis applications just discussed, you
may want to review the list of software presented in the book’s Appendix,
“Additional Resources on the Web.” Here you will find information
about a number of other Web site traffic analysis applications. If any of
these applications suit your fancy, pick one and then download and install
a free trial copy. Then, if after taking a test run you find you like it, pur-
chase a licensed copy.

The sections that follow provide essential details for making sense of the
reports that you’ll be able to generate and also provide high-level instruc-
tion on how to use the information found on these reports to understand
and improve your Web site.
Web Site Stats Are a Necessary Evil
Yes, Web stats truly are a necessary evil. Everyone hates the thought of
statistics. However, if you don’t track the status of your Web site, you will
never truly understand who is visiting and, more importantly, why. The
following list shows a few more reasons why you should take the time to
track your Web site’s stats:

To discover popular and unpopular resources.

To learn more about the people who visit your site.

To learn more about the effectiveness of your banner advertising.

To obtain information on search engine usage and referring sites.

To determine which browsers and platforms people use when visiting
your site.

Increase Your Web Traffic In a Weekend, Sixth Edition
Before you start having flashbacks of high-school algebra class, you should
know that tracking and analyzing Web site stats isn’t rocket science. As a
matter of fact, tracking and analyzing stats is fairly easy as long as you
follow the advice presented in this afternoon’s session.
If you decide to go with the option of processing your own log files located on your Web
server, you’ll need to know where they are stored. The location of the Web server log files
is defined when a server is installed. The best way to find these files is to ask your service
provider or the Webmaster they are stored.
Keep in mind that if you have your own domain, such as www.yourname.com, you
should have separate log files regardless of whether you actually have your own server
or you use someone else’s server. If the same server handles multiple domains, the logs
probably have a prefix that indicates the domain. Otherwise, you—like anyone using a
service provider—will share server logs with everyone else using the server.
Regardless of whether you analyze your own Web site’s log files or use an
on-demand Web service to collect and process your stats, you can expect
to get the same basic information. The following sections provide you
with an overview of the types of data and reports that you can expect and
provides you with insight on how to analyze this data in order to make
improvements to your Web site.
Discovering Popular and Unpopular Resources
By tracking and analyzing stats, you can discover which of the pages at
your Web site are visited most often. Although you might think that your
top-level home page is the most popular, this isn’t always the case. In fact,
your analysis might reveal that most people visit some other page at your
Web site. This is because the Web allows anyone to visit any page at your Web
site, and visitors don’t have to start at your home page.
NOTE

One report that you will want to generate is one that tracks popular Web
pages. Depending on which Web traffic analysis tool you use, the name
of this report will vary. You should look for a report named something
like Most Requested Pages or Most Popular Pages.
Another report that you might want to look for is one that depicts how
much traffic each major area of your Web site receives, as shown in Figure
5.4. Using a report like this, you can determine which area of your Web
site needs additional attention versus which pages you may wish to
further exploit by using viral and permission marketing techniques. 
You might also be interested in generating reports that show which Web
pages are visited most often and which Web pages receive the least atten-
tion. These reports might be called something like the Most Requested
Pages and Least Requested Pages reports.
SUNDAY AFTERNOON  Discovering Who’s Visiting Your Web Site and Why
253

report to see which
areas within a Web
site are being
visited most often.

Other types of reports that can tell you about the popularity of your Web
pages include:

Most Accessed Directories: Identifies which directories were most
frequently accessed. This report is useful when you want to identify
popular areas of your Web site.

Most Downloaded File Types: Identifies the most popular type of
downloaded file.

Most Downloaded Files: Identifies the executable or document
files that are most frequently downloaded.

Top Entry Pages: Identifies which pages were most frequently the
first page requested at the site. You can use this report to better
understand why people visit your site.

Top Exit Pages: Identifies which pages were most frequently the
last page requested at the site. You can use this report to help
understand why users leave your site.

Top Paths through the Site: Identifies paths users most frequently
take through the site. You can use this report to better understand
how users navigate pages at your site.
The main purpose of generating all of these different types of reports is
to gain an insight as to how people are visiting your Web site. Using the
information presented in these reports, you can determine what content
your visitors appreciate most and try to provide more of it. You can also
find out which pages your visitors are just skimming through and try to
improve them in order to give your visitors a reason to slow down and
look around. Finally, by looking for common exit points in your Web
site, you can focus your efforts on trying to find ways to redirect your vis-
itors back to other parts of your Web site and increase your overall level
of stickiness.

Learn More about the People Who Visit Your Site
By tracking your Web site’s stats, you also can learn more about the
people who visit, such as where they live, where they work, and how they
access your Web site. One of the best ways to learn more about your Web
site is to track visitor demographics. For example, you can expect to find
reports that identify which countries your visitors are coming from.
Depending on which Web traffic analysis tool you use, you may also find
that there are other types of demographic information you might be able
to track, such as:

User profiles by region

The U.S. state or Canadian province from which users most 
frequently visit

The organizations your visitors are most frequently from, such 
as whether they are from government, military, education, or 
commercial organizations

Whether a particular visitor is a new user or is returning for a 
subsequent visit

Session information for top users

The number of visits per user
Find Out When People Visit
Finding out when people visit your Web site is extremely useful, espe-
cially if you use this information to plan updates for your Web pages. As
Figure 5.5 shows, you can use stats to determine the activity level at your
Web site throughout the week. For example, you might discover that
Friday is your busiest day of the week in terms of the number of times
your pages receive hits or the amount of data that is transferred. At the same
time, you might determine that Sunday is the slowest day of the week.
SUNDAY AFTERNOON  Discovering Who’s Visiting Your Web Site and Why
255

Using this information, you could better determine when to post updates
to your Web site and when not to post updates. For example, assuming
that Friday was your busiest day, you might want to post updates on
Sunday in order to provide your biggest audience with the most up-to-
date information.
Other types of activity reports that you might want to look for include:

Bandwidth Usage: Shows the volume of activity according to the
amount of data transferred.

Activity Level by Hour of Day: Shows the busiest hours of the
day.

Activity Level by Time Interval: Summarizes activity by week or
month.

Learn More about On-line Advertising
These days most Web sites have banner ads, and your site is probably no
exception. Yet do you know if the banner exchange you are using is telling
you the truth about click-through rates? Well, your Web site stats can tell
you exactly how many people are viewing banner ads on your site and
how many people are clicking on those ads.
Normally, you’ll need to tell your analysis software about the specific
campaigns you are running. For example, you might have the following
three ongoing ad campaigns running:

Apple Laptop Giveaway Ad

Dell Laptop Giveaway Ad

Sony Laptop Giveaway Ad
Assuming that these ad campaigns are linked to specific banners, each
time a particular banner ad is displayed or clicked on, information would
be recorded. Again, depending on which Web traffic analysis tool you are
working with, reports will be named differently. Regardless, you should
be able to find reports based on banner ads viewed and banner ads
clicked. You should also be able to analyze data showing the ratio of ad
views to ad clicks (e.g., the click-through rate).
You can use this valuable information to determine which of your adver-
tising efforts is the most successful and which efforts are not working out.
You can then use it to help you make the best use of your limited time,
effort, and dollars. As an example, check out Figure 5.6, which shows an
example of a Campaign Summary report.

257

Obtaining Information about Referring Sites,
Search Engines, and More
The analysis of your Web site statistics can tell you exactly how users got
to your Web site. A key report you’ll want to obtain is a Referrer report
(or Referring Site report). The report tells you how visitors find their way
to your site. This report will show you the search engines and directories
from which most of your visitors are coming. In addition, you may see an
entry for No Referrer, which indentifies the number of visitors who enter
your Web site by directly entering the URL of one of your Web pages into
their browser. 
The referrer information can also be used to obtain information on which
search engines are used to find your Web site. This information will provide
you with a list of the top search engines being used as well as the keywords
or keyword phrases entered as search parameters.

Determining the Browsers and Platforms 
Being Used
Often, Web sites are designed with specific types of users in mind. These
users probably fit a specific demographic or geographic target, and you’ve
probably made some assumptions as to how tech-savvy these users are as
well. For example, in your design guidelines, you might have stipulated
that the Web site is designed for users with the newest generation of
browsers. You might have even taken this a step further by saying that the
Web site was designed for users with the most modern browsers and
Windows-based operating systems. To validate the technology assump-
tions that you’ve made, or to help establish future guidelines, you’ll want
to track browser and platform usage.
Most Web site tracking software provides reports for tracking browsers by
type and version. A Browser by Type report will tell you the types of
browsers being used but won’t necessarily tell you the browser versions
being used. This information is typically provided in a Browser by
Version report. 
Zeroing In on Visits
Perhaps the visit is the most meaningful Web site statistic. A visit is a col-
lection of hits and page views that pertain to a specific person who
requests files from your Web site. When you count visits, you are count-
ing the number of people who stopped by your Web site.
A hit is a term that represents a file access. If a Web page contains five graphics, then
six hits would be registered. That’s one hit for each graphic that is loaded and one hit for
the Web page itself. A page view is a representation of a Web page that is accessed. By
tracking page views you can determine which pages are visited most and which receive
the least amount of visits.
SUNDAY AFTERNOON  Discovering Who’s Visiting Your Web Site and Why
259
NOTE

Putting Visits Together
Just as there’s a big difference between someone shopping at your store 1
time and 50 times, so there is a big difference between someone visiting
a Web site 1 time and 50 times. You need to limit the scope of visits to a
specific time period, such as all consecutive file requests that are separated
by no more than 30 minutes. Following this, you would say that if a
person browsed your site for 5 minutes one day and 15 minutes the next
day, you’d have two visits. On the other hand, if a person browsed your
site for 10 minutes, went away, and then came back 15 minutes later,
you’d have a single visit. 
Tracking Visits
Tracking software counts visits by limiting the scope of visits to specific
time frames. When you track individual visits, you are mostly interested
in the summary information, such as:

How long did the person visit?

What page did the person start on?

What areas did the person visit?

How long did the person stay in each area?

What was the total number of hits for this visitor?

What was the total number of page views for this visitor?
For example, let’s look at a scenario in which a Web site has had three
visits. A summary of the first visit is outlined here: 
Minimum length of visit:
12 minutes, 4 seconds
Start page:

Getting the Big Picture
The big picture takes into account all visits to the Web site during a spe-
cific period of time, such as the 15-minute time slice. When you put
together the big picture, you must ask yourself many important ques-
tions. The answers to these questions will help you understand who is vis-
iting your Web site and why. The main questions that you will want to
ask include:

What was the total number of visitors for this time period?

What was the length of the average visit?

What was the average duration of a page view?

What was the average number of page views per visitor?

What was the average number of hits per visitor?

What domain classes and geographic areas are represented?
When you examine your Web site over a period of days or weeks, you will
want to ask these additional questions:

What are the busiest hours of the day?

What are the busiest days of the week?

What are the most requested pages?

What are the most common last pages requested?
To put this in perspective, let’s go back to the three visits summarized pre-
viously and create the big picture. When you answer the main questions,
you come up with stats that look like this:
Visitor count:
3
Duration of analysis:
15 minutes
Length of the average visit:
7 minutes, 3 seconds
Average duration of page views per visitor:
10.67
262
Increase Your Web Traffic In a Weekend, Sixth Edition

Average number of hits per visitor:
38.3
Domain classes and geographic areas:
50% Net
50% Com
With these stats in hand, you can now answer the all-important questions
concerning who is visiting and why. The list that follows provides descrip-
tions that can help you make sense out of the stats discussed so far. Keep
in mind that these are generalities meant to get you started thinking
about how you can use these stats to promote your Web site and to make
your Web site a better place to visit.

Visitor count: Tells you how many people are visiting. You can use
this to gauge the true popularity of your Web site. Whereas a new
or low-traffic Web site might get 5 to 100 visitors a day, a popular
Web site might get 5,000 to 10,000 visitors a day.

Length of the average visit: This is an indicator of whether people
are really reading pages at your Web site or just browsing. It can
also be an indicator of whether people like what they see. The
longer the average visit, the more information the visitor is finding
and reading.

Average duration of page view: This can be an indicator of
whether people are reading or just browsing. When you examine
this statistic, you also need to keep in mind the length and style 
of pages that you have at your Web site. Are they highly textual,
highly graphical, or both?

Average number of views per visitor: Generally, the more pages
people view, the happier they are; and if people are viewing many
pages at your Web site, they are finding information that interests
them. 

Average number of hits per visitor: Over time, you can use this
information to estimate the number of visitors.
SUNDAY AFTERNOON  Discovering Who’s Visiting Your Web Site and Why
263


Domain classes and geographic areas: This can tell you where
people visiting your Web site live and work, which is great infor-
mation to have if you want to attract advertisers.

Busiest hours of the day: Tells you the time of day when most
people visit your Web site. This statistic can help you plan daily
updates, promotion campaigns, and advertising.

Busiest days of the week: Tells you the day of the week when
most people visit your Web site. This statistic can also help you
plan weekly updates, promotional campaigns, and advertising.

Most requested pages: Tells you the pages that visitors find most
interesting and/or useful. Can be used to tailor your Web site to
visitors’ needs and to help you determine which pages should
receive most of your attention.

Most commonly requested last pages: Can help you spot trends
and bad pages. If the last page requested has lots of links to external
Web sites, this statistic tells you that this is the point from which
most visitors are leaving. If the last page requested doesn’t have links
to external Web sites, you might want to examine the page in ques-
tion.
You’ll find that Web site traffic analyzers can put together all the reports
you’ll need for the big picture. Once such report is the Visitor Profile
Summary report (see Figure 5.7), which focuses on showing which areas
of a Web site are visited, the average length of a visit, the number of visits,
and the number of repeat visits.
Take a Break
If you haven’t created traffic reports for your Web site, you should do so
now. Once you generate the reports, ask yourself the questions previously
pointed out. The next part of this session covers how to gain visitors who
otherwise would have been lost because of bad links at your site or bad
references from other sites. But before you dive in, take a break! You
deserve it. Grab yourself a cup of coffee or tea.

Gaining Lost Readers from Error Analysis
After pouring time and resources into your Web site, do you really want
to risk losing people who visit your Web site but don’t get to where they
expected? Not really, especially when every visitor is someone who could
help spread the news about your terrific Web site. Don’t lose visitors once
they’ve found a doorway into your slice of cyberspace. Nothing stops
would-be visitors dead in their tracks like an error. They see errors as
brick walls and often race off as quickly as they can click on the mouse.
How many times have you seen the dreaded 404 File Not Found error
message? Did you hang around the Web site that you tried to access, or
did you just click on your browser’s Back button and head off in some
other direction?
Errors are often the result of bad links in your Web pages or bad refer-
ences to your pages from other Web sites. When it comes to finding and
fixing bad links, you have total control and can easily track down the
SUNDAY AFTERNOON  Discovering Who’s Visiting Your Web Site and Why

of visitor activity.

problems—if you know how. When it comes to bad references to the
pages at your Web site, you might think that finding and fixing these
problems is beyond your control. However, nothing could be further
from the truth. You can fix errors regardless of their source, and you’re
about to find out how.
Errors: We All Hate Them
We all hate errors, yet we’ve grown so accustomed to them that they seem
like an everyday part of the quest to browse the Web. Stop and think for
a moment about your reaction when you encounter a File Not Found
error. Your reaction, be it restrained contempt or outright indignation, is
mirrored thousands of times every day around the world.
After your initial outrage passes, what is your next reaction? You proba-
bly click on your browser’s Back button to return to the site that sent you
to the wrong address. Or perhaps you enter a new URL into your browser
and head off into another direction. Web surfers are seldom persistent
enough to puzzle through the error to figure out another way to get at the
information using the bad URL. As a result, just about every time your
server displays an error, you lose a visitor—maybe forever.
When you are trying to increase traffic at your Web site, the last thing
you want to do is lose visitors. Thus one of the keys to increasing and
maintaining traffic to your Web site is to reduce errors and help visitors
find their way, which is exactly what you’re about to learn.
There are three major trouble spots that can cause you to lose potential
visitors forever. They are:

Missing files

Lost connections

Server time-outs
All of these trouble spots can be identified and tracked by your Web site
traffic analysis tool.
266
Increase Your Web Traffic In a Weekend, Sixth Edition

Missing Files
The most common errors are those that relate to files the server can’t find.
Bad links are a key reason for the File Not Found error. When you create
a Web page, you add hypertext links that relate to pages at your Web site
as well as other Web sites. Although all your links might work perfectly
when you first create your Web site, things change over time. You update
your Web pages. You move your pages to different locations. You
combine some pages. You delete other pages.
Unfortunately, every time that you move or delete Web pages, you might
unwittingly start an avalanche of errors. A visitor who bookmarked one
of the Web pages that you moved or deleted can’t get to the Web page
anymore. Another visitor who created a page showing links to her favorite
Web sites now has an invalid link pointing to your Web site. Worse, the
search engines with which you registered haven’t reindexed your Web site;
now hundreds of people who look for resources like yours can’t find your
pages anymore.
How Can You Fix the Problems?
Use your Web site analysis tool to generate a Page Not Found report. You
can then use the report to help you find trouble spots at your Web site.
Start by printing the report. Next, compare the file names in the report
to the actual files on your Web site. If you find a file that is in the report
and available on your Web site, use your browser to retrieve the file 
from your Web server. Be sure to use the same URL that the user entered.
If the file loads without problems, there was probably an intermittent
problem with the user’s Internet connection, which doesn’t necessarily
mean that anything is wrong on your Web site. Cross that file off the list
and move on to the next one.
If the file doesn’t load in your browser, check the file name. Does the file
name on the server exactly match the URL you entered? Most servers are
case-sensitive, meaning that the mixture of uppercase and lowercase
letters must match exactly. When you find a naming problem, you have
SUNDAY AFTERNOON  Discovering Who’s Visiting Your Web Site and Why
267

268
Increase Your Web Traffic In a Weekend, Sixth Edition
a bad reference in one of your Web pages that you need to fix. The easiest
way to find the problem page—and possibly other pages that contain the
bad reference—is to search your Web directories for the bad reference.
For example, a bad reference to a Web page called welcome.htm that
should have been referenced as welcome.html could be fixed as follows:

Change to the directory containing your Web pages. If you have
multiple document directories, examine each in turn.

Search for references to the file name welcome.htm.

Record the list of file names containing the bad reference.

Edit the files and correct the bad references.
If you don’t have a naming problem, you might have a permission problem.
On most Web servers, the directory and the file must have specific per-
mission before visitors can access your files. Generally, the directory needs
to be executable, and the file needs to have read access. If you don’t know
how to check or set file permissions, ask your Internet service provider.
Next, highlight all the files that don’t relate to Web pages of other docu-
ment files, such as references to image files. Most likely, the highlighted
list of files points to broken references in your Web pages. Fix these ref-
erences either by updating the related page or by moving the file to where
it is supposed to be.
Now that you’ve narrowed the list a bit, look for URLs that belong to files
that you’ve moved or deleted. When you find a reference to a file that you
moved, jot down the new name of the file. When you find a reference to
a file that you deleted, make a note to yourself that the file was deleted.
Because users are looking for these files and you want to build—rather
than lose—readership, you will want to redirect these lost visitors to the
new location of the resource. Alternatively, you can create a placeholder
document with the old URL, telling visitors that the resource is no longer
available and then redirecting them to another area of your Web site. The
job of the placeholder page would be to direct lost visitors to the resource

for which they were looking. This redirection could be done simply by
providing instructions explaining that things have changed and providing
the visitor with the correct URL. Alternatively, although it involves some
pitfalls, you could consider automating the redirection process. For
details on how to redirect users to new locations, see the upcoming
section titled “Redirecting Lost Readers.”
Although the remaining files on your list should pertain to true errors on
the part of the user or someone else, you don’t want to discard the list just
yet. Take a look one more time and ask yourself whether any patterns
exist. For example, you might find that a number of visitors are consis-
tently mistyping the name of one of your Web pages. If you think there
is a chance that the spelling of your page’s name is confusing to some of
your visitors, change it.
Lost Connections
Lost connections are often the result of impatient visitors not wanting to
wait for your page, its graphics, and other multimedia files to finish
loading. Consequently, if you find a page that has lots of lost connections
related to it, you might want to change the page so that it either loads
more quickly or follows sound design techniques that allow the visitor to
use or peruse the page before it finishes loading.
If you have pages with lots of text, graphics, or multimedia, you might
want to periodically check for lost connections. To do this, create a Lost
Connection report using your Web site traffic analysis tool. For example,
Figure 5.8 shows a Page Delivery Summary report, which lists, among
other things, information about the number of aborted requests for
various Web pages.
Unfortunately, sometimes the connection is lost after the server completely
transfers the file but before the client completely processes the data. In
this case, you might not be able to determine the cause of the error and
should just move on to the next item on the list.

269

Time-Outs
Although time-outs are rather rare on Web servers, this section would be
incomplete without at least mentioning how to spot them. A time-out is
sort of like the server getting impatient with the client and wanting to
move on. You probably won’t see time-outs unless you have large multi-
media or compressed files that are retrieved using the standard Web file
transfer protocol, HTTP.
The first step in dealing with time-outs is to generate a Client Error
report. If you see time-outs frequently for the same file, you might want
to tell your Internet service provider about the problem. Although the
service provider should be able to set the time-out ratio higher, the service
provider might also tell you that the byte site for the offending files is
unreasonably large. In the latter case, you might want to break the large
file down into several smaller parts.

Improve Your Web Site with Visitor Feedback
In order to keep visitors coming back to your Web site, it is important
that you determine what your visitors think about your Web site and its
products and services. There are a number of different ways that you can
go about collecting this information, including:

Blogs

Guestbooks

Message forums

E-mail forms
Setting Up Your Own Blog
As already discussed, a blog is an online Web log that allows the blog
owner to share her thoughts on a particular subject. Blogs can display
text, graphics, and links to other Web pages. Blogs can also be used to
collect visitor feedback. There are many different ways to go about setting
up your own blog. Your Web service provider may provide you with
access to a blogging service. If you have a MySpace account, then you
already have a blog. Many other types of social networking sites are also
eager to provide you with your own blog. All you have to do is pick one
and begin posting to it.
If you have not started your social media optimization campaign yet and
don’t have a blog, all hope is not lost. You can set up a new blog for free
at www.bravenet.com/webtools/journal/, as shown in Figure 5.9. This
service lets you create a new blog just by answering a few questions. You
can specify a title for your blog, select a design theme, and specify whether
you want to be notified by e-mail whenever someone posts a comment
on your blog.
SUNDAY AFTERNOON  Discovering Who’s Visiting Your Web Site and Why

Setting Up a Guestbook
A guestbook is a logging system that lets visitors leave comments on what
they think about your Web site, products, and services. Guestbooks allow
you to display information about visitors, including information about
where in the world they are from. Your Web service provider may provide
you with access to a guestbook service. If not, you can set up a guestbook
using a third-party provider. For example, you can sign up for one such
service at www.bravenet.com/webtools/guestbook/, as shown in Figure
5.10.
To set up a guestbook using Bravenet’s guestbook service, all you have to
do is specify a title, pick a theme, and then copy and paste the HTML
code that is provided into a page on your Web site. You can even specify
whether you want to prevent guestbook messages from being displayed
until after you have reviewed and approved them.
272

you share your
thoughts, opinions,

Setting Up a Message Forum
A message forum is a service that facilitates an online discussion between
you and the people that visit your Web site. Your Web service provider
may provide you with access to a message forum service. If not, you can
set up a message forum using a third-party provider. For example, you 
can sign up for one such service at www.bravenet.com/webtools/forum/,
as shown in Figure 5.11.
Bravenet’s message forum service lets you select a title and a theme, and
then provides you with the HTML code that you can copy and paste
onto a page on your Web site. You can even specify whether you want to
be notified by e-mail when message postings are made.

Collecting and Posting Positive Visitor Feedback
Another way of collecting visitor input that you can use to improve your
Web site, products, and services is to employ an e-mail form that allows
visitors to send you their thoughts and feedback. Using this feedback, you
can continue to tweak and improve your Web site to encourage repeat visits.
One easy way to set up e-mail forms is to take advantage of Bravenet’s 
e-mail forms service (www.bravenet.com/webtools/emailfwd/), as shown
in Figure 5.12.
Bravenet’s e-mail forms service lets you select from predefined forms that
specialize in collecting visitor feedback, contest entry, and survey infor-
mation. Alternatively, you can elect to create your own form from scratch.
Once you have designed a form that suits your needs, you can implement
your form by copying and pasting the HTML code that is provided onto
a page on your Web site.

Redirecting Lost Readers
As you learned earlier, every time you move or delete a Web page, you can
start an avalanche of errors. Anyone who has bookmarked the page that
you moved or removed will get an error. Anyone who has created a link
to the page from his or her own Web site will be unwittingly directing
people to a dead end. Anyone who uses a search engine to find resources
might also get a retrieval containing references to the pages that you’ve
moved or removed.
The result is that lots of people who otherwise would have visited your won-
derful niche of cyberspace get lost. They hit the proverbial brick wall and run
off in some other direction. And they might never return. When a user gets
all the way to your Web site through the maze of cyberspace, do you really
want to risk losing that user because of something that you can fix?

275
Figure 5.12
E-mail forms let

information from

276
Increase Your Web Traffic In a Weekend, Sixth Edition
To remedy this situation, you should create a placeholder document. The
key to a placeholder document is that it takes the place of a Web page or
other document that you moved or deleted, and then redirects the user to
a different location at your Web site. If you have a list of documents that
you’ve moved or deleted, why not create a few placeholder documents
right now? Every visitor counts.
The way to avoid brick walls and placeholder documents altogether is to plan out your
Web site before your build it. The simplest planning rule is to give each area of your Web
site its own directory to start with, and to make the default document for this directory
the home page for the area. Unfortunately, in the real world, most Web publishers don’t
like to plan things out before they dive in, which means they should use placeholder
documents to help direct traffic whenever necessary.
Redirection Basics
The technique you use to redirect visitors can be as simple as the one
shown in Figure 5.13. Here, you tell visitors that the resource has been
moved or deleted. Next, you provide them with the URL of the new
resource or an escape route to another location at your Web site. The
source for the redirection page is shown in Listing 5.1.

277
Figure 5.13
A simple but highly
effective redirection
technique.

When you redirect visitors as shown in Listing 5.1, you come as close as
possible to ensuring that 100 percent of your misdirected visitors have the
ability to find their way back to your Web page. This technique should
work regardless of what type of Web browser visitors may use. This is
important because more and more often, visitors may show up at your
doorstep using game consoles like the Wii and Playstation 3 and portable
wireless hand-held devices like smartphones. 
More Redirection Techniques
One problem with the previous redirection solution is that it requires vis-
itors to click on an extra link on their way to your Web pages. For some
visitors, this extra effort is enough to drive them away. Another option
available for redirecting lost visitors is to automate the redirection process
using client pull technologies. With client pull, you insert an instruction
in the Web page that tells the visitor’s browser to retrieve a different Web
page. This way, the visitors can get to your Web page without having to
make an extra click.
When it comes to client pull technologies, your choices are somewhat
limited. Your primary options are the META Refresh tag or a client-side
scripting language, such as JavaScript. Unfortunately, as you are about to
learn, both of these options have their issues.
The META Refresh Tag
Previous editions of this book taught readers about using the META Refresh
tag as an effective means of redirecting lost visitors. However, a lot has
changed on the Web in recent years, making this option a questionable
choice.
The META Refresh tag is placed in the head section of an HTML page.
You use the http-equiv attribute of the <meta> tag to tell the browser
that you want to refresh the browser window. You use the content attrib-
ute of the <meta> tag to tell the browser two things: how long to wait and
what document to load.
278
Increase Your Web Traffic In a Weekend, Sixth Edition

An example of the <meta> tag is:
<meta http-equiv=”refresh” content=”2 url=http://www.tvpress.com/
writing/”>
Here, the http-equiv attribute is assigned the keyword refresh, which
tells the browser that you want to prepare to refresh the current window.
The content attribute has two parts separated by a semicolon and a
space. The 2 tells the browser to wait 2 seconds before refreshing the
browser window. The next part of the content attribute tells the browser
the URL of the page that you want to load into the refreshed window.
The URL must have the full path specified, including http://.
Figure 5.14 shows an example of a page that redirects the visitor to a new
location at a Web site. As you can see, the page displays an information
message explaining what will happen. Just in case the user’s browser
doesn’t support the technology, the appropriate links are placed on the
page as well. The markup for the sample page is shown in Listing 5.2.
SUNDAY AFTERNOON  Discovering Who’s Visiting Your Web Site and Why
279
Figure 5.14
Although this looks
similar to the
previous redirection
technique, the
auto-redirect will
take the visitor to
the new location
automatically.

</a>
</div>
</body>
</html>
Unfortunately, this seemingly innocent use of the META Refresh tag can
end up getting you into trouble. The reason for this is that some less-
than-scrupulous Web site publishers have used a variation of this redirec-
tion technique, referred to as doorway pages, to try and spam search
engines. They do this by creating a number of simple Web pages that are
exact copies of one another, except that each Web page is overloaded with
a specific keyword phrase and designed to achieve high keyword relevance
for a specific search engine.
280
Increase Your Web Traffic In a Weekend, Sixth Edition

SUNDAY AFTERNOON  Discovering Who’s Visiting Your Web Site and Why
281
In many cases, the keyword phrase for which each page has been opti-
mized may have little if anything to do with the content of the Web sites
that these Web pages are redirecting visitors to. For example, one of these
Web pages may be designed to attract Web servers doing a search on rock
music while another is designed to match up against a search for science
fiction. Spamming occurs when all these Web pages redirect the Web
surfer to a site that has nothing to do with these keyword phrases, as
might be the case if the Web site where surfers are being sent was an
online discount shop.
Because of misuses like this, many search engines now consider any use
of the META Refresh tag as spam. As a result, if you employ this redi-
rection technique in your Web pages, you run the risk of your pages being
lowered in rank or even being removed from the search engine’s database.
Scripted Client-Side Redirection
A safer option for automatically redirecting Web pages is to use a Web
scripting language, such as JavaScript. Currently, none of the major
search engines open or inspect the content of externally referenced files.
To avoid any possible misinterpretation of your code as being spam, you
can place your JavaScript code in an external file and call the external
JavaScript from within your Web page. For example, Listing 5.3 shows an
example of how to set up a Web page to use an external JavaScript to
control Web page redirection.
Listing 5.3  A JavaScript Redirection Example
<html>
<head>
<title>William’s Bio and FAQ Pages Have Moved</title>

</a>
</h2>
</div>
</body>
</html>
Highlighted in bold is a JavaScript statement that tells browsers to open
and execute an external JavaScript file named TestRedirect.js, which
is located in the same directory as was the Web page. The code that
resides in this external JavaScript file consists of a single statement as
shown here:
location.href(“http://www.tvpress.com/writing/”)
This statement loads the specified Web page into the browser, while still
leaving an entry for the original URL listed in the browser’s history file.
The net effect is that the Web surfer should automatically be redirected
to the appropriate Web page. However, in the event that the Web surfer’s
browser does not support JavaScript or has its JavaScript support dis-
abled, the Web surfer will still be able to find his or her way to your Web
pages by clicking on the URL link that will be displayed.

283
NOTE
Despite being supported by every major Web browser, JavaScript is not universally sup-
ported. For example, some visitors may disable JavaScript support in an effort to defend
against computer viruses. Handicapped visitors may use text-only browsers in conjunction
with text-to-speech software and not be able to support JavaScript. In addition, many small
hand-held portable Web connection devices don’t support JavaScript either. However,
despite these exceptions, JavaScript redirection should be effective 99 percent of the time.
Redirection Using Your Web Server
Although these client-side redirection techniques work well, more and
more Web servers are starting to support automatic redirection. With
automatic server-side redirection, the Web server takes over and maps the
old URL to the new one, which makes the redirection completely trans-
parent to the visitor. For example, you could tell the Web server to map
all requests for www.tvpress.com/fun/ to www.tvpress.com/summer/.
Most commercial Web servers support URL redirection. You’ll find, for
example, that Microsoft IIS makes this task fairly easy to accomplish.
However, you’ll need access to the Web server’s administrative tools, which
you might not have if you use a service provider.
No More 404 File Not Found Errors
The typical errors servers report are meaningless to most people, and even
the people who know what the status codes mean probably would much
rather have a helpful pointer than an error that says 404 File Not Found.
Fortunately, there are ways to fix it so that the nondescriptive and mean-
ingless errors reported by servers go the way of the dinosaur. 
When the Web server software was installed, the technician who set up
the server defined specific parameters that told the server how to report
errors and which error documents to display. Because the default error
documents are rarely replaced, chances are good that visitors to your Web
site see the standard non-descript error messages. 

You can confirm this by entering an invalid URL that refers to your Web
site, such as:
http://www.myserver.com/nothingatall.html
For example, take a look at Figure 5.15, which shows how the 404 File
Not Found error is typically displayed. As you can see, it’s not particularly
friendly or helpful to lost Web surfers.
If your server reports a vague error message, don’t worry; this can be
changed by defining new error documents. On most servers, regardless of
operating system, you can define the documents to retrieve when an error
occurs. For example, with Microsoft IIS, you can tell the server the name
and location of the page you want to load when a certain error occurs.
With the thought of eliminating forever the dreaded 404 File Not Found
error, take a chance and talk to the head technician or Webmaster who
works for your Internet service provider. The question to ask is, “Can you
help me set up unique error documents for my domain, or, at the very
least, is it possible to create some informative error messages for everyone
284

who uses the Web server?” For example, take a look at Figure 5.16, which
shows how the folks at www.oracle.com have enhanced their 404 File Not
Found Error message. The new message not only apologizes to visitors, but
it also provides navigation that gives their would-be visitors alternative
paths into the Web site.
Taking Advantage of Free URL Analyzers
Of course, the best possible way to handle a 404 File Not Found error is
to correct it. To do this you must know where the errors are occurring.
One way to make this determination is to visit each of your Web pages
and to test the validity of each link by clicking on it. If your Web site is
fairly small, this shouldn’t be a problem. But if your Web site has grown
to more than a handful of Web pages, this exercise can quickly become
tiresome.

So the question is, “Are there free tools available on the Internet to help
automate this task?” The answer, as you no doubt now expect, is yes. For
starters, check out Link Valet (www.htmlhelp.com/tools/valet), as shown
in Figure 5.17. Link Valet begins by spidering your Web site. Once it is
done, it can present its findings in either a summary or a full report. In
addition to reporting on your 404 File Not Found errors, it will also
point out any links that are being redirected. 
Another validation option that you may want to consider is REL Link
Checker Lite, which is available as a freeware application that you can
download from www.relsoftware.com/rlc/ and install on your computer,
as shown in Figure 5.18.
REL Link Checker Lite is designed to spider Web sites that contain 1,000
or fewer links. If your Web site contains more links than this, you might
want to look into trying a free trial of Web Link Validator (available at
www.relsoftware.com/wlv/).

A Few Last Words on Errors
Errors are showstoppers. Don’t let your visitors think that your Web site
is gone. Every visitor counts, especially when you are trying to increase
traffic to your site. But the reason for fixing trouble spots goes well
beyond preventing the loss of wayward visitors. To attract and maintain
an audience over the long haul, you need to maintain your site and
provide visitors with lifelines when you move or delete files.
Finally You Know What to Do—So What’s Next?
Right about now, you are probably wondering why this book keeps
saying that you can use the Web site reports to make your Web site a
better place to visit as well as to increase your Web traffic. After all, the

The simple truth is that the long-term success of your Web site is based
upon understanding your Web site’s good points and bad points. By
understanding your site’s good points, you learn how to market your Web
site to the world. By understanding your Web site’s bad points, you learn
what you need to do to fix any problems. If you don’t fix the problems at
your Web site, you might lose visitors just as fast as you find new ones.
The following steps will make your Web site a better place to visit:

Direct users to popular areas

Clean up unused pages

Avoid dead-ends

Fix errors
After you take a close look at your Web site, you can move on to the next
step, which is to find your niche in cyberspace and formulate a plan that
uses your niche to market your Web site to the world.
Web Site Analyzers
Now, given that you have most likely made all sorts of modifications to
your Web pages, this might also be a good time to take a few minutes to
get a third party’s opinion on the overall construction of your Web pages.
There are any number of Web sites that provide Web page analysis. For
example, there is the Web Page Analyzer (www.websiteoptimization.com/
services/analyze/), shown in Figure 5.19. 
The Web Page Analyzer will evaluate your Web page’s size, composition,
and download time. To use this free service, enter your URL and click on
the Submit Query button.
Directing Users to Popular Areas
Every road sign you can add to the Web makes cyberspace just a little bit
more enjoyable, so why not create a few road signs that direct visitors to
popular areas at your Web site? Your road signs don’t need to be extravagant.
You can use plain-old text to create links to other pages at your Web site.
288
Increase Your Web Traffic In a Weekend, Sixth Edition

Obviously, you don’t want to tell visitors about every single Web page
you’ve published. Instead, you want to direct visitors to the popular areas
of your Web site by creating links to the top-level page within the specific
areas you want to promote. The idea here is that people visiting your
sports information page, for example, might also be interested in your
sports equipment page. However, they can’t get to the sports equipment
page if you don’t tell them it exists.
Say that your Web site’s statistics show that seven pages at the Web site
get the most traffic. The URLs for the hypothetical pages are:

http://www.verycooldays.com/—Your main home page.

http://www.verycooldays.com/summer/—A page that promotes

When you examine the seven most visited pages, you might see that three
specific areas of the Web site are getting the most traffic:

The main home page

The summertime activities area

The sports equipment area
The home page is the place to toot your horn about the main areas at
your Web site, but you also need to do so on all of the top-level pages
within the Web site. Although you might think that most visitors start on
the site’s home page, this isn’t always true. In fact, most people probably
start their visit on some other page. For this reason, you should tell
anyone visiting the summertime activities area that you have this won-
derful sports equipment area, and vice versa.
By promoting both areas, you increase page views at your site and let vis-
itors know that your site really does have a lot to offer. On the Web page
at http://www.verycooldays.com/summer/, you could add a clear road
sign that directs visitors to the sports equipment area, such as:
Sports Equipment
*  Find the best bargains on the Web
*  Get money-saving tips
*  Post your own for sale ad
290
Increase Your Web Traffic In a Weekend, Sixth Edition

Then, on the Web page at http://www.verycooldays.com/equipment/,
you add another road sign that directs visitors to the summertime activi-
ties area. The markup for the road sign is as follows:
Fun in the Sun
Interested in summer-time sports like scuba diving,
water skiing, and surfing? Why not stop by
our Fun in the Sun headquarters? 
Cleaning Up Unused Pages
After studying your Web site to see how you can direct traffic to popular
areas, you should take a hard look at pages that rarely get visitors.
Although your first impulse might be to delete these pages or stop updat-
ing these pages, this might not be the right solution. Rather than remove
or neglect these pages, you should ensure that other pages at your Web
site have clear road signs that tell people what these pages are all about.
You might also want to consider combining the information on this page
with information on another page.
Say that your site’s stats show that two pages at the Web site rarely receive
visitors. The URLs for these pages are:

http://www.verycooldays.com/summer/background.html—
A background page for the summertime activities area.

http://www.verycooldays.com/summer/scuba/deepwater.html—
A page that promotes deep-water scuba driving.
After examining the background page, you might discover that you can
summarize the information and place it on the top-level Web page for the
summertime activities area. In this way, visitors to this area of the Web
site get a quick summary without having to visit the background page. By
adding the information to the top-level Web page, you make the area a
better place to visit.
SUNDAY AFTERNOON  Discovering Who’s Visiting Your Web Site and Why
291

Next, you look at the page that promotes deep-water scuba diving. Your
scuba diving pages are divided into three categories: fresh water, salt water,
and deep water. Although the fresh-water and salt-water scuba pages attract
lots of visitors, the deep-water page is rarely visited. The problem here
might be organization; perhaps your top-level page needs to explain that
deep water refers to deep-sea scuba diving with submersibles and that you
also feature video from a Galapagos undersea expedition.
Avoiding Dead Ends
Dead ends are showstoppers. All your Web pages should end with links
that lead back to a main page, the previous page, or the next page in a
series of pages. Links at the bottom of a Web page are subtle reminders
that the Web site has more to offer. By adding links to the bottom of your
Web pages, you make navigating your Web site easier, thereby helping to
retain your Web traffic. Remember, if Web surfers visit your sports-
related Web site, they are interested in sports; why not help them find the
information they are looking for?
Links at the bottom of a Web page can be as basic as
Back to Fun in the Sun
Or you can use mini-menus that tell visitors about other areas of your
Web site, such as
Our Home Page  |  Fun in the Sun  |  Sports Equipment
Another form of dead end is a page that causes the visitor to lose interest
in your Web site. For example, a page full of errors or inconsistencies
might make visitors think the rest of your Web site isn’t worth visiting.
For this reason, you might want to look for pages that are often the last
page people visit and see if they need updating.
Understanding Your Niche
After you use a Web site analyzer to track your site’s stats, you should have
a better understanding of what attracts visitors to your Web site. Under-
standing your niche and using it to your advantage are the keys to success
292
Increase Your Web Traffic In a Weekend, Sixth Edition

when you try to promote your Web site to the world. By taking the time
to learn exactly why people visit your Web site, you save yourself a barrel
full of heartaches.
Before they started tracking their stats, the creators of www.verycooldays.
com thought that the underwater video sequences they published online
were the main events at their Web site. As it turned out, the Web pages
covering deep-sea scuba diving were the least visited. Although you could
say that the problem was poor organization, it turns out that the Web site
had lots of other things to offer visitors.
Although the creators of the Web site started out building a resource for
scuba divers, they ended up with a Web site that covered many different
water sports, including water skiing and surfing. They also created a won-
derful guide to buying sports equipment online. Looking back, they saw
their niche covered two different areas:

Resources for anyone who loved water sports

Resources for buying and selling sports equipment online
Unfortunately, the site’s banners and logos promoted the site as “a great
place for anyone who loves scuba diving.” Worse, the developers of the
site used this same slogan whenever they had an opportunity to promote
the Web site. When they registered with search engines, they hyped their
great scuba-diving center and forgot the other areas. When they traded
links with other sites, they asked the other Web site publishers to be sure
to tell people about the site’s scuba-diving resources. Even though they did
indeed attract visitors who were interested in scuba diving, they missed
out on many other opportunities to increase the traffic to other areas of
their Web site.
As you can see, the creators of www.verycooldays.com should have taken
the time to put together a better picture of their Web site before they
started promoting their site only as a great place for anyone who loves
scuba diving. 
SUNDAY AFTERNOON  Discovering Who’s Visiting Your Web Site and Why
293

A better description of their Web site would have been this:
A terrific site for anyone who loves water sports! We have tons of
resources covering scuba diving, water skiing, surfing, and many
other water sports. We also have a great guide to sites that sell sports
equipment. Our buying tips might save you a bundle.
The creators of www.verycooldays.com could also create separate descrip-
tions for each popular area at the Web site. This would allow them to
promote the Web site as a whole and each area separately. For example,
the next time they register with a search engine, they could use the com-
bined description and then register each area separately as well.
Before you continue, create descriptive blurbs for your Web site. Start by
identifying the most popular areas, then use the subjects that these cover to
come up with a brief description that identifies your Web site’s niche. After-
ward, create separate descriptions for each popular area at your Web site. 
Reviewing Your Progress and Planning More
for Next Weekend
Wow, the weekend is over already! Hopefully, after reading the sessions
and following along, you have a great start on the long-term improvement
of your Web site’s traffic.
What Have You Done This Weekend?
The first step to putting the motion in promotion is to register your Web
site in all the right places. Because search engines are the primary means
of getting your site noticed, this book offered you an extensive look at
how search engines work and how you can optimize your Web pages for
indexing. Although there are hundreds of search engines, it is not practi-
cal or worthwhile to submit your Web site to every single one of them.
Instead, make the most of your time and resources by registering with the
major search engines.
294
Increase Your Web Traffic In a Weekend, Sixth Edition

But registering with the major search engines is only the beginning of the
promotion process. Next you need to look at Web directories. Just as
there are hundreds of search engines, there are hundreds of Web directo-
ries as well. As with search engines, you should focus your efforts on the
major Web directories. Afterward, you should look to business search
engines and Yellow Pages directories. These business-oriented search and
directory sites are great places to tout your products, services, and com-
mercial Web site.
Because you also want your Web site to be accessible to people for specific
types of information, the next step is to register with industry- and category-
specific directories. Beyond these directories, you’ll find specialty directories.
Whether your site covers home decorating or famous poets, there are 
specialty directories that will want your listing.
Awards can make all the difference in the world when it comes to increas-
ing traffic to your Web site. Not just any old award will do, though. The
best awards are those that are long lasting and meaningful. Still, when all
is said and done, the popularity of the award site is the most important
factor in determining whether the award will help increase the level of
traffic at your Web site. The busier the award site, the better the chances
that the site’s award will increase traffic to your Web site.
Social networking should play a key role in your Web marketing plan. Web
sites like Facebook and MySpace can help you to develop new contacts.
Sites like YouTube and Flickr can be used to further garner attention.
Social Networking sites are among the most popular places on the Internet.
By investing a little time and effort participating in social communities,
you can drive high-quality traffic back to your Web site.
One way to spread the word quickly about your Web site is through a reg-
istration service that allows you to register with multiple search engines and
directories. Although registration services are useful for registering multiple
URLs with directories, you get the most out of your Web site’s listing by
registering your site with individual search engines and directories.
SUNDAY AFTERNOON  Discovering Who’s Visiting Your Web Site and Why
295

In the final parts of the book, you saw many additional ways to increase
your Web traffic, such as e-mail and freebies. Believe it or not, e-mail is a
terrific way to promote your Web site. When you promote your Web site
through e-mail, you can use the direct, person-to-person method as well
as newsgroups and mailing lists. Beyond e-mail, you can steal the thunder
of traditional marketers by using giveaways, contests, and sweepstakes.
Because everyone loves the chance to win something for nothing, freebies
can truly bring the masses to your Web site.
You also learned different ways to compete in the big leagues with banner
advertising. The banner is the most heavily used advertising method on
the Web. Although most advertisers pay thousands of dollars to display a
banner ad, you can advertise through a banner exchange network without
spending a dime.
You want visitors to remain at your site, and you want them to return.
These are two of the biggest reasons not only to promote your Web site,
but also to improve it. After people have found the doorway into your
slice of cyberspace, you want to give them every reason to stay. Nothing
stops visitors dead in their tracks like an error. Errors are often the result
of bad links in your Web pages or bad references to your Web pages from
other Web sites. Using Web traffic analyzers you can fix errors regardless
of their source.
After you gather stats for your Web site and know who is visiting your site
and why, the next step is to put the stats to work. Not only can you use
the stats to make your Web site a better place to visit, you can use them
to find your niche in the wonderful world of cyberspace. Enhancing your
Web site based on what the stats tell you and using your site’s niche to
your advantage are key ingredients that will help you attract the masses.
Keeping Up with the Latest Web 
Promotion Techniques
The Web is in a constant state of change. In order to stay on top of things,
it is important that you stay up to date with the latest developments. 
296
Increase Your Web Traffic In a Weekend, Sixth Edition

One way of doing this is to keep an eye on what is being discussed in dif-
ferent Web page marketing forums. One such forum is the IM4Newbies
Internet Marketing Forum (www.im4newbies.com/forum/) as shown in
Figure 5.20.
Another forum that you might want to keep an eye on is Digital Point
located at forums.digitalpoint.com. Here you will find postings on
topics relating to Web site promotion.
Keeping an Eye on Your Competition
Checking out your competition is another indispensable source of infor-
mation that you can use to help fine-tune your Web site promotion efforts
and better meet the needs of your visitors. This means regularly visiting
their Web sites and observing what they are doing right and doing wrong.

298
Increase Your Web Traffic In a Weekend, Sixth Edition
You want to make sure that your Web site is and remains more interesting,
more useful, and more popular than your competitors’ sites.
If your competition makes use of message forums and guestbooks, be sure
to keep an eye on the feedback they are getting from their visitors and use
that to determine what changes you might need to make to your own
Web site. The bottom line here is to remain ever diligent in your efforts
to ensure that your Web site is the best of its kind. This will keep visitors
coming back and will ensure that when new visitors arrive at your Web
site what they find is not just a lot of hype.
A Final Note
Just because you’ve reached the end of this book doesn’t mean that your
promotion efforts should end. Next weekend, if you have some time, go
back and revisit any sessions or topics in the book that you might not
have explored as much as you’d like.
After you take another look at the session, use the main topics in this
book to outline a long-term promotion plan. Your plan should focus on
the items that you will need to periodically address, such as:

Tracking Web site stats (weekly or monthly)

Looking for problem areas at your Web site (weekly or monthly)

Updating your listings in directories if you move the furniture
around (only as necessary)

Resubmitting your site for awards (wait two or three months
between submissions)

Participating in mailing lists and newsgroups (daily or weekly)

Updating your ad banner (monthly)
That’s it. Have some fun this evening. On the other hand, if you’re enjoying
this creative brainstorming, you might want to keep at it for a while.
