Acknowledgement
This book couldn't have been possible without the help of Cass Brookes, who gave 
her time and again helped me to structure my work; I'm truly indebted to her! I'd 
also like to thank the other two-thirds of my WordPress 3 amigos, Alex Moss and 
Shane Jones (they are two of my closest friends with whom I share ideas) as well as 
Alex. I'd also like to thank Anna Moss, Paul Gladstone, and Marc Levy along with 
the other members of the staff of 3 Door Digital, with whom I have the pleasure of 
working on a daily basis. Collectively, they have increased my confidence over the 
last year or so. Thanks also to the incredibly talented bunch at BVWC, the WordPress 
Coders Facebook Group (shout out to Jem and Carly!), and Manchester WordPress 
Users Group, whose founder, Mike Little, also helped in creating WordPress. I'm 
lucky to know that there are such talented people at my doorstep!
Also, huge thanks to Packt Publishing, especially Esha, Sruthi, Maria, and Anish, for 
giving me the opportunity to write this book. I hope you have enjoyed it as much as 
I have!
Finally, this book is dedicated to Mum (Jane), Dad (Alun), Richard, Aled, and 
Bonnie (the latter is immortalized in this book!), and my immediate family. They 
have always been very supportive in whatever I do and I'm lucky to have such a 
wonderful family. I love you all.

What you need for this book
For this book you simply need WordPress installed and working ideally on a Linux 
server, though you can have it set up on a local machine connected to the Internet.
Who this book is for
This book is aimed at anyone who wishes to set up a forum on their site. Ideally, they 
will be familiar with WordPress, but it's not necessary.
For some of the more advanced topics discussed later in the book, a working 
knowledge of PHP, HTML, and CSS is desirable as well as confidence in using FTP.
Conventions
In this book, you will find a number of styles of text that distinguish between 
different kinds of information. Here are some examples of these styles, and an 
explanation of their meaning.
Code words in text are shown as follows: " Select the bbpress folder, and then right-
click to delete it."
New terms and important words are shown in bold. Words that you see  
on the screen, in menus or dialog boxes for example, appear in the text like this: 
"Select Delete all posts, and then click on Confirm Deletion."
Warnings or important notes appear in a box like this.
Tips and tricks appear like this.
A block of code is set as follows:
    'name' => __( 'Forum Sidebar', 'bbpress' ),
    'id' => 'sidebar-forum',
    'before_widget' => '<aside id="%1$s" class="widget %2$s">',

Getting Started with bbPress
bbPress, which is a popular forum management plugin for WordPress, is relatively 
simple to install and run. However, if you are not familiar with the WordPress 
installation environment, it could be a bit daunting. This chapter will serve as an 
introduction to bbPress and will guide you through the installation of bbPress onto 
your WordPress-based website.
By the end of the chapter, you will have an understanding of bbPress and will have 
learned the following:
•	
What bbPress is, its history, and why it is popular
•	
The prerequisites for installing it—what you need to have on your website 
before installing bbPress
•	
How to install bbPress
•	
How to log in to the administration area of bbPress
What is bbPress?
bbPress is a template-driven forum management plugin built to be used with 
WordPress. It is designed to be a light plugin, with additional features being added 
through extensions known as plugins should you want more functionality.
Forums have been around for almost as long as the Internet and are a great way for 
people with similar interests to connect over the Internet. Examples of the types of 
sites that can benefit from a forum include:
•	
Community websites such as local news portals, where members can discuss 
pressing issues
•	
Computer software that requires an area to provide technical support

Getting Started with bbPress
[ 6 ]
•	
Clubs, such as sport clubs or youth clubs
•	
Educational websites, where students can get extracurricular support
Forums can be a lot of work to get started but can eventually become a valuable asset 
to your website and often will drive a lot of traffic to it. Furthermore, forums can also 
be a great asset to your online presence, building a community around your services. 
A brief history of bbPress
bbPress was created when the co-founder of WordPress, Matt Mullenweg, was 
frustrated with the forum management software that ran the official WordPress 
support forums after a hosting upgrade broke them. Due to this, a WordPress-
based forum software was proposed and coded. On December 28, 2004, new forum 
software was rolled out to the official WordPress support forum; this was later 
released as bbPress v0.7.2.
Originally, for most of its development, bbPress was a standalone piece of software 
with its own database tables and was a fork (making a copy of the code and starting 
independent development on it) of WordPress's source code. This meant that it 
was relatively stable, but as bugs were discovered in WordPress, it became harder 
to maintain. With the release of bbPress 2.0 on September 12, 2011, a decision was 
made, that bbPress 2.0 would change from being a standalone piece of software 
to a plugin for WordPress. This generated a few problems; one in particular was 
that many plugins were designed with early versions of bbPress, and are now 
incompatible with bbPress 2.0 and many others are no longer maintained. However, 
an entire library of WordPress plugins was now available from within WordPress.
Today, the project is maintained by the bbPress community and owned by the 
WordPress Foundation, a charitable organization founded to maintain the interests 
of open source software. Ownership of the project was given to the WordPress 
Foundation by Automattic, a commercial development firm, on September 9, 2010.
Benefits of using bbPress
There are many pieces of software that can manage forums, so why should you pick 
bbPress? Many reasons exist, but here are a few of the key reasons:
•	
It is free, meaning you never have to pay a penny to use the software.
•	
It is open source, meaning that all code associated with the software is 
available for you to download and modify.
•	
It is a community project, rather than having a small team of developers 
working on the project, a large number of people can be working on it, from 
commercial developers to hobby programmers.

Chapter 1
[ 7 ]
•	
It is light. Out of the box, it can be seen to be lacking features, but it has 
relatively little code to run the forum, which makes it faster and more secure 
than many of its competitors.
•	
It is extensible. There are over 100 dedicated bbPress plugins currently 
released adding functionality to your site. Furthermore, many WordPress 
plugins are also compatible with bbPress.
•	
It is modular. When you install bbPress, it creates all the pages you need, 
meaning you're ready to run your forum straight away. However, if you 
decide you don't want to run a bbPress forum anymore, deleting the plugin 
will not break the rest of your site.
•	
It runs on WordPress, which means that if you use WordPress to run your 
website, your site will have a familiar look, as coding templates and plugins 
in bbPress are very similar.
If you wish to see examples of what you can create in bbPress, bbPress keeps 
examples of quality, active forums that run on their software on their site. You can 
see this list at http://bbpress.org/about/examples/.
Have you decided to use bbPress then? Great! Let's get started!
Prerequisites for installing bbPress
At the time of writing in March 2013, bbPress 2.2.4 requires a Linux server with the 
following to run:
•	
PHP Version 5.2.4 or higher
•	
MySQL Version 5.0 or higher
It is also recommended that a server has Apache with mod_rewrite installed; 
however, this is not a necessity. Don't worry too much about these requirements 
as an e-mail to your web host, or any potential web host should give you this 
information. However, many Linux-based web hosts run these services as standard.
At the time of writing, the requirements for bbPress are exactly the same as WordPress, 
so if you are running the latest version of WordPress, you can run bbPress.
Installing WordPress
The final prerequisite for bbPress is WordPress. As bbPress is a plugin of  
WordPress, you need to have WordPress installed and running on your server  
before activating bbPress.
www.allitebooks.com

Getting Started with bbPress
[ 8 ]
This book assumes you already have WordPress installed; however, if you haven't 
gone through WordPress's Famous 5-Minute Install article, which you can read at 
http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress.
Many hosts provide a one-click installation service for 
WordPress. I would recommend that you do not go through this 
process. Often, the versions of WordPress on this service are one 
or two versions older than the current version, leaving you open 
to possible security exploits.
Installing bbPress
As bbPress is a WordPress plugin, we will need to install it like a plugin. Thankfully, 
this is relatively straightforward and there are three ways to install plugins, which 
are described as follows:
Method 1 – downloading and installing the 
plugin from the WordPress repository
The following are the steps to be performed for downloading and installing the 
plugin from the WordPress repository:
1.	 In your WordPress installation, visit your login page, which will look similar 
to http://www.yourwordpressdomain.com/wp-admin/. Log in with your 
username and password, and you will be taken to the WordPress Dashboard.

Chapter 1
[ 9 ]
 
On the Dashboard screen, down the left-hand side, you should see a menu titled 
Plugins. If you hover over Plugins, a pop-up menu should appear, with one of the 
options being Add New. Click on this option.
You will be taken to a screen that has a search box. This will allow you to search the 
WordPress plugin repository for any plugin that is present within it. As bbPress is 
a WordPress plugin, we can find bbPress using this method. Type in bbPress and 
click on the Search Plugins button.

Getting Started with bbPress
[ 10 ]
From here, you should see a list of plugins returned in the search for bbPress.  
One will be the proper bbPress plugin. It should be fairly obvious; however, it  
looks similar to the following screenshot:
2.	 If the plugin name is bbPress, and its author is The bbPress Community, 
you have found the correct plugin! Click on the Install Now link beneath the 
plugin name, and the plugin will be installed.
3.	 If the installation is successful, you will be given two options: Activate 
Plugin and Return to Plugin Installer.
4.	 If you click on Activate Plugin, the plugin will be activated.
5.	 Alternatively, if you click on Return to Plugin Installer, you'll be taken  
back to the Plugin Installation Screen. From here, click on Plugins in the  
left-hand menu, search for bbPress in the list, and click on Activate to 
activate bbPress.
Method 2 – uploading a ZIP file of bbPress  
to WordPress
The following are the steps to be performed while uploading a ZIP file of bbPress  
to WordPress:
1.	 Visit the URL http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/bbpress/  
and click on the download button; you will download the latest version  
of bbPress, which you should save to an easy-to-find location, such as  
the desktop.
2.	 Then, log in to your WordPress administration site, and in the left  
navigation hover over Plugins and select Add New; you should be taken 
to the Add New Plugins screen. Along the top, you should see a link called 
Upload; click on this, and you're taken to the upload screen shown in the 
following screenshot:

Chapter 1
[ 11 ]
3.	 Click on Choose File, and then navigate to where you saved the bbPress.
zip file. Make sure the ZIP file's name is in the box (as seen in the preceding 
screenshot), and then click on Install Now. If successful, you will be given 
the choice to activate the plugin as described previously.
Method 3 – uploading the unzipped bbPress 
plugin via FTP
This method is the trickiest, and it will be well worth trying it at least once so you're 
familiar with the installation process.
Before beginning with this installation method, you'll need the following:
•	
A file transfer protocol (FTP) program such as FileZilla, available to 
download for free at http://filezilla-project.org/.
•	
The FTP address for your website
•	
Your FTP username
•	
Your FTP password

Getting Started with bbPress
[ 12 ]
You should have received these details when you signed up for your hosting 
package; however, if you don't have them, speak to your host and they will provide 
these details.
The following are the steps to be performed while uploading the unzipped bbPress 
plugin via FTP:
1.	 Visit the bbpress plugin URL, http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/
bbpress/ and download it to an easy-to-find location.
2.	 Head to that location and find the bbpress.zip file.
3.	 Extract these files to a folder named bbpress.
You should have a folder now with the following files inside it:
4.	 Download and install FileZilla.
When you open Filezilla, you should be presented with a screen similar  
to this:

Chapter 1
[ 13 ]
5.	 In the Host textbox, type in the FTP address for your website.
6.	 In the Username and Password fields, type in your FTP username and FTP 
password, respectively.
7.	 Ignore the Port field and click on Quickconnect.
8.	 In the left window of the screen will be the files on your computer  
(Local site), and on the right-hand side will be your server navigation 
(Remote Site).
9.	 In the Local site window, navigate to the folder that contains the bbPress 
folder, which you extracted earlier. When found, navigate to the plugins 
folder in the Remote site window. This will be located in the wp-content 
folder, which will be in the folder where WordPress is installed.
10.	 Drag the bbPress folder into the plugins folder, and when fully copied 
over, log in to your WordPress Dashboard and click on the Plugins page.  
If bbPress is listed among the plugins, click to activate it.
If you notice three more menus appearing in the sidebar—Forums, Topics, and 
Replies, congratulations, your installation of bbPress was successful!

Installations should go fine, but nothing is perfect. Here are a few common 
installation problems and the solutions for them:
•	
There isn't a menu titled Plugins!
If you don't have a menu titled Plugins, your account with which you log 
in to WordPress isn't the administrator of your site. There will be a login 
with the level "administrator", every WordPress site requires one. Speak to 
anybody who could have had access to your site, for example designers, as to 
what the administrator login could be.
•	
Dialog box asking FTP details on clicking Install Now?
Depending on how your host has set up your server, you may not have the 
ability to install plugins over hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP), which is 
the method of installation that WordPress uses to install plugins. However, 
it does have a backup method, which requires you to authorize WordPress 
to install the plugin on your behalf. To do this, you will need three pieces of 
information:
°°
The FTP address for your website
°°
Your FTP username
°°
Your FTP password
All of that you can obtain from your host. Repeat the installation process, 
and then type in your FTP address, username and password into the relevant 
textboxes, and the installation should continue as normal.
•	
White screen on installing and activating the plugin, and the site doesn't 
work. Help!
Most of the time when installing plugins, there aren't any issues. However, 
there are occasionally conflicts that occur. For security reasons, WordPress 
usually hides these conflicts but displays a blank white page instead. The 
only way to fix this is to log in to your server through FTP and delete the 
bbPress plugin, which will automatically remove it from the site. To do this, 
perform the following steps:
1.	 Log on to your FTP server (as described in the Method 3 – uploading 
the unzipped bbPress plugin via FTP section) and navigate to the / 
wp-content/plugins/ folder.
2.	 Select the bbpress folder and right-click to delete it. Then, return to 
your WordPress administration page and go to the Plugins page.

Chapter 1
[ 15 ]
You should see the following message appear in red:
You will have to reinstall bbPress, but before activating the plugin, 
deactivate all other plugins that you have running on the site. One by one, 
activate each plugin until you activate the one that breaks your site again. 
This will be the plugin that is conflicting with your site; either find a fix or 
find a replacement for that plugin.
•	
My question wasn't answered here: Luckily, there is a dedicated bbPress 
forum available, where people can answer questions to issues you are 
having. Many people volunteer to provide help on these forums. You can 
visit them at http://bbpress.org/forums/.
Summary
Congratulations! You have taken the first step in activating your bbPress forum. 
By now, you should have an idea of the benefits of using bbPress to run your 
forum along WordPress. You should also be competent in installing bbPress on any 
WordPress installation. It may be confusing for the first time, but the more number 
of installations you do, the easier it gets. You can also spot common issues that could 
be affecting your site.
In the next chapter, we will look into setting up forums for you, encouraging people 
to register, and how to create, edit, or delete posts.


Taking Your First Steps  
with bbPress
Congratulations! You have now successfully installed bbPress. If it was complicated 
to begin with, do not worry. It will eventually become easier for you as you continue 
installing and working on bbPress. Now let's get on to the fun stuff.
This chapter will give you the basics on how to set up a forum on bbPress, so that by 
the end of this chapter you will have a forum to share with your community.
This chapter will therefore cover the following:
•	
Settings in WordPress to get your forums displayed
•	
The bbPress settings page
•	
How to create, modify, and delete a forum
•	
How to create, modify, and delete posts
Setting up WordPress correctly
Before beginning to set up bbPress, you need to make sure that two of the settings 
for your site are correct. These, while not essential, do assist you in the running of 
a bbPress forum. These settings will allow visitors to find your site more easily in 
search engines, navigate through your site more easily, and also actually register for 
the site.

Allowing user registration in WordPress
By default, user registration in WordPress is turned off. This is to prevent spam bots 
from registering on your site, which could lead to them commenting on your site and 
writing posts you wouldn't approve of. However, if you want the users to register on 
your site and post on your forum like on most forums, please do the following:
First of all, in your WordPress Administration at http://www.
yourwordpressdomain.com/wp-admin/, click on Settings. Halfway down the page, 
you should see the following two options:
You will want to tick the checkbox allowing anybody to register and set the New 
User Default Role option to Subscriber. This applies only to the blog, so that they 
cannot write posts on your blog. We will set them up on the forum later. Click on 
Save Changes to save the changes.
If you are worried about spam, please don't be! We will 
discuss ways of preventing spam in a later chapter, which 
will allow genuine users to post and block spammers.
Setting up Pretty Permalinks
By default, WordPress uses a permalink structure that has, by its own admission, 
"question marks and lots of numbers in them". The reason for this is that it's the only 
structure that works with every type of service out there.
It isn't perfect though; for one, it's difficult to remember post names and pages. 
For example, which of the following two links is easier to remember: http://www.
yourwordpressdomain.com/?p=1204892 or http://www.yourwordpressdomain.
com/my-brand-new-post/? The latter is much easier to remember and share with 
users, isn't it? Also, having words in URLs helps search engines, as they use the page 
URL as a guide to what is on the page. Having an easy-to-remember URL is what is 
known in WordPress as Pretty Permalinks, and is a good practice for any site to be 
search engine friendly (SEF).

Chapter 2
[ 19 ]
To set these up is simple. If you remember, in Chapter 1, Getting Started with bbPress, 
we asked our host if they had a service called "mod_rewrite". This service allows 
WordPress to have these Pretty Permalinks, and it's incredibly easy to set up, so 
much so that many blogs or WordPress installations already have it set up.
If you haven't already done so, head to the Permalinks section in your WordPress 
Administration (it's a submenu under Settings) and you should be greeted with this 
page, as shown in the following screenshot, with the top option checked:
Select any other radio button apart from Default. I recommend the Post Name or 
Month and name radio button as shown in the preceding screenshot, as then, the 
URL will contain the name of the post, helping search engines find it easier, and 
people to remember it easier. Then, click on Save Changes.
This will change all the URLs on your site; so on established sites, I would 
recommend that you check all your most important pages to see if they still appear. 
The old URLs will still work, but will redirect to the new, prettier URLs.

Taking Your First Steps with bbPress
[ 20 ]
A lot of the rest of this book will talk about the forums and posts in Pretty 
Permalink format, so while not essential, it will make understanding this 
book easier.
To test that your forum works now, visit http://www.yourwordpressdomain.com/
forums/, and you should see the following screen:
There isn't much to see yet, but don't worry, we'll soon be filling this page out with 
forums, posts, and topics.
The bbPress settings page
Before you launch any forum, it's important to visit the bbPress settings page and 
check over the options to make sure they are according to your requirements.
By default, bbPress populates the options with the most common settings.  
However, it may not be suitable for all, so it's a worthwhile check to make.

Chapter 2
[ 21 ]
To view this page, within the WordPress Administration Dashboard, head to the 
Forums options page, which is a subpage of Settings. It is not the Forums page you 
see in the sidebar. To make sure you are viewing the correct screen, you should 
check with the following screenshot:
This section is split into four subsections, Main Settings, which sets global settings 
to the forum, Per Page, which sets up the forum's display settings on the page, and 
Archive and Single Slugs, which sets up the forum's Pretty Permalinks, as discussed 
earlier in this chapter.
Main Settings
This sets up the global settings of the forums. Most forums will want to keep the 
settings the same or similar to the default settings. However, we will go through 
each setting to explain what each one does and what should be the likely value.

Taking Your First Steps with bbPress
[ 22 ]
Disallow editing after (x) minutes
This setting allows users to edit for a short period of time after posting. This is 
primarily done to allow users to correct spelling mistakes or confusions. As such, most 
corrections would probably be done within five minutes, which is the default value.
I would recommend keeping it at five minutes. For forums 
that constantly receive posts from users (for example, 
suppose a user is editing a post, then another user quotes 
that post, then they both will quote the original post, and so 
on), I would recommend reducing it further.
Throttle posting every (x) seconds
This setting sets the time between each user's posts. This is done to prevent users 
from creating duplicate topics as a result of clicking on the Submit button multiple 
times. By default, users can post once every 10 seconds.
I would recommend increasing it to 30 seconds, as on many 
forums, users won't be able to write a post or reply within 30 
seconds, and it also stops manual spammers (people posting 
the same post over and over again).
Allow topic and reply revision logging
This keeps a record of each topic and reply that is edited. Only Keymasters will be 
able to view this and make changes. It's worthwhile keeping this on, unless your 
forum gets exceptionally large, as it could make your site slow. However, for most 
forums, it's a good idea to keep this switched on, which is its default value.
Favorites and Subscriptions
The next two options allow the users to set topics as Favorites or Subscriptions. 
Favorites is a list of favorite topics that the users have, and it is displayed in the 
user's profile. Subscriptions are also publicly accessible in the user's profile; however, 
users will be notified whenever a new post is made in a subscribed topic. Both are on 
by default, and are recommended to be kept on.

Chapter 2
[ 23 ]
Allow topics to have tags
You can "tag" topics. Tags are words associated with each topic, and can be used to 
quickly find relevant posts. Say for example, you have a forum with two sections, 
"Travel" and "Sport". The Travel section could have posts tagged with the word 
"Spain" (for example, a post that tells about travelling to Spain). The Sport section 
could have posts tagged with the word "Sport" (for example, a post that tells about 
Spanish football). It can be a good way to help users on busy forums navigate to 
relevant topics easily, but it can also be open to abuse. It's a good idea to set this on 
to begin with, and then see what happens on your forum.
Anonymous posting
If checked, this setting will allow the users that are not logged in to post on your site. 
I would leave this setting switched off, as the amount of spam that will come  
to your forum will be almost unmanageable if switched on.
The default user role
This is the default role of users when they first visit the site. We will talk in more 
detail about user roles in the next chapter, but for now, if you want users to join 
the site and post straight away, set it to Participant. If you want to approve new 
members, set it to Spectator.
The auto role
By default, any new member who registers for the site will have no role assigned, 
and therefore assumes the "default" user role as defined previously. Rather than 
leaving the role for each user empty, this option actually assigns the user the  
default role.
It's a good idea to switch this option off. This enables you to change the default  
role at any time. But then, you will have to go through every user and change this. 
Also, it has been known to cause problems with certain installations.
The fancy editor
This changes the editor box from a blank textbox to the one with a toolbar, which 
allows rich text (such as bold, italicized, and underlining text) to be easily added.  
It is on by default and should be left on.

Taking Your First Steps with bbPress
[ 24 ]
Auto-embed links
This option will allow users to embed content (such as tweets, YouTube videos, and 
Flickr images) into the posts by simply adding the URL to that content on a new 
line. You can read a full description of how this works as well as a full and updated 
list of services supported, at http://codex.wordpress.org/Embeds, but as a rule 
of thumb, if you want the users to embed Youtube videos into the forum, leave this 
option switched on; alternatively, you can switch this off.
Per page settings
This is quite simple. This setting allows you to specify how many topics you can 
have on each page of the forum, and how many replies you should have on each 
page of the topic. A number between 10 and 25 is usually the standard.
Archive and single Slugs
Remember we talked about Pretty Permalinks earlier? Well, Slugs are a part of the 
URL that occurs between slashes after the domain name. This will allow you to have 
a hierarchical structure in your forum. So, for example, your "Travel" forum we 
discussed earlier may have a URL structure of http://www.yourwordpressdomain.
com/forums/forum/travel/. This makes it easy for users  
to remember and find, and can also help to find the post through search engines.
By default, you should probably leave these settings as they are. The only 
reason you should change this is if you have any post or page on your site with 
the URL http://www.yourwordpressdomain.com/forums/ or http://www.
yourwordpressdomain.com/topics/, as this can cause conflict issues between 
WordPress and bbPress.
When satisfied, click on Save Changes and the changes should be saved.
Forums
Now that bbPress is set up exactly how you want it, we're now going to create a few 
forums. Most forums, even those that are extremely specialized, have a variety of 
sections to help users navigate through the site. bbPress makes it easy to create and 
manage sections, but for now, let us first create a brand new forum.

Chapter 2
[ 25 ]
Creating a new forum
In the WordPress Administration, click on New Forum, which is a subpage of the 
Forums menu item on the sidebar. You will be taken to a screen that is quite similar 
to a WordPress post creation page, but slightly different with a few extra areas:
If you are not familiar with the WordPress post creation page, the following is a list 
of the page's features:
The Enter Title Here box
The long box on the top of the page is your forum title. This, on the forum page, 
will be what is clicked on, and will also provide the basis for the forum's URL Slug 
with some changes, as URL Slugs generally have to be letters, numbers, and dashes. 
So for example, if your forum title is My Product's Support Section, your Slug will 
probably be my-products-support-section.

Taking Your First Steps with bbPress
[ 26 ]
When you insert the forum title, the URL Slug will be generated below. However, if 
you wish to change it, click on the yellow highlighted section to change the Slug, and 
then click on OK.
The Post box
Beneath the title box is the post box. This should contain your forum description. 
This will be shown beneath your forum's name on the forum index page. You can 
add rich text to this, such as bold or italicized text, but my advice is to keep this 
short. One or two lines of text would suffice, otherwise it could make your forum 
look peculiar.
Forum attributes
Towards the right-hand side of the screen, you should see a Forum Attributes 
section. bbPress allows to set a number of different attributes for your created  
forum. The attributes are explained in detail as follows:
•	
Forum type: Your forum can be one of two types: "Forum" or "Category". 
Category is a section of the site where you cannot post, but forums are 
grouped in. So for example, if you have forums for "Football", "Cricket",  
and "Athletics", you may group them into a "Sport" category.
•	
Unless you have a large forum with a number of different areas, you 
shouldn't need many categories. Normally you would begin with a few 
forums, but then as your forums grow, you would introduce categories.
If you create a category, any forum you create must be a subforum of the 
category. We will talk about creating subforums later in this chapter.
•	
Status: Your forum's status indicates if other users can post in the forum. If 
the status is "Open", any user can post in the forum. If the forum is "Closed", 
nobody can contribute other than Keymasters. Unless one of  
your forums is a "Forum Rules" forum, you would probably keep all  
forums as Open.

Chapter 2
[ 27 ]
•	
Visibility: bbPress allows three types of forum visibility. These, as the names 
suggest, decide who gets to see the forums. The three options are as follows:
°°
Public: This type allows anybody visiting the site to see the forum 
and its contents.
°°
Private: This type allows users who are logged in to view and 
contribute to the forum, but the forum is hidden from users that are 
not logged in or users that are blocked. Private forums are prefixed 
with the word "Private".
°°
Hidden: This type allows only Moderators and Keymasters to view 
the forum.
Most forums will probably have majority of their forums set to Public, but 
have selections that are Private or Hidden. Usually, having a Hidden forum 
to discuss forum matters with Administrators or Moderators is a good thing. 
You can have a private forum as well that could help encourage people to 
register on the site.
•	
Parent: You can have subforums of forums. By giving a parent to the forum, 
you make it a subforum. An example of this would be if you had a "Travel" 
forum, you can have subforums dedicated to "Europe", "Australia", and 
"Asia". Again, you will probably start with just a few forums, but over time, 
you will probably grow your forum to include subforums.
•	
Order: The Order field helps define the order in which your forums are 
listed. By default, or if unspecified, the order is always alphabetical. 
However, if you give a number, then the order of the forum will be 
determined by the Order number, from smallest to largest. It is good to put 
important forums at the top, and less important forums towards the bottom 
of the page.
It's a good idea to number your orders in multiples of 10, rather 
than 1, 2, 3, and so on. That way, if you want to add a forum to 
your site that will be between two other forums, you can add it in 
with a number between the two multiples of 10, thus saving time.
Now that you have set up a forum, click on publish, and congratulations, you 
should have a forum!

Editing and deleting forums
Forums are a community, and like all good communities, they evolve over time 
depending on their user's needs. As such, over time, you may need to restructure or 
delete forums. Luckily, this is easily done. First, click on Forums in the sidebar of the 
WordPress Administration. You should see a list of all the current forums you have 
on your site:
If you hover over a forum, two options will appear: Edit, which will allow you to 
edit the forum. A screen similar to the New Forum page will appear, which will 
allow you to make changes to your forum.
The second option is Trash, which will move your forum into Trash. After a while, it 
will be deleted from your site.
When you click on Trash, you will trash everything associated with 
your forum (any topics, replies, or tags will be deleted). Be careful!

Chapter 2
[ 29 ]
Forum posts – topics and replies
Having a number of forums on your site is all well and good, but for a forum to be 
successful, you need to have some posts and discussions in there.
To begin with, you will probably have to start with a few discussions and reply a fair 
bit as well. It will take time, but eventually some of your members will contribute, 
meaning you can take a step back as the forum continues to grow.
There are a couple of ways for adding forum posts to the site. However, I'm going to 
show you the easiest and more common way of adding posts, which is the same way 
through which your readers will add posts.
Adding new posts
Go to http://www.yourwordpressdomain.com/forums/ and navigate to the forum 
that you want to add a post to. Beneath any posts already made, you should see a 
box with the title Create New Topic in… and then your forum's name.

Taking Your First Steps with bbPress
[ 30 ]
The Topic Title textbox and post box are fairly self explanatory, and you should 
be familiar with what this will contain. However, Topic Tags is a new section. We 
discussed tags previously as being a list of keyword phrases used to help users find 
similar topics within different forums. Include a list of comma-separated words to 
help users find related posts.
The Notify me of follow-up replies via email checkbox will subscribe you to the 
topic, so that when somebody replies, you will receive an e-mail alerting you to the 
new replies.
Finally, if you are a Moderator or a Keymaster, you will have an extra box:  
Topic type. Topics can be one of three types:
•	
Normal: This is your standard topic useful for pretty much all topics.
•	
Sticky: The Sticky topic will be "stuck" to the top of the page. By default, 
whenever new topics get added, or replies are added to topics, they go above 
older discussions. Sticky topics are kept permanently at the top of the forum. 
This is useful for definitions, links to major forum discussions or frequently 
asked questions, as well as major forum events such as offline meet ups.
•	
Super Sticky: These topics will be displayed on the top of all the forums, 
above all the Sticky topics and the Normal topics. This is useful for posts that 
are universal throughout the site, such as forum rules.
When you are ready, click on Publish and then your post will be published. 
Congratulations! You have just published your first post.
Replying to topics
When you have created a topic and clicked on Publish, your topic goes live and is 
open to replies from users. You can also reply to your own topic; this is handy if  
you have run out of time to edit the original topic and need to add something to your 
original post.
To reply to a topic, navigate to any topic whose discussion is still open. Beneath any 
post, you will see a reply box. The only difference will be that you cannot provide it 
with a title as the title of the topic is set at the beginning.

Chapter 2
[ 31 ]
You can add your reply in the post box and also add any extra tags to it. You also 
have the option in the checkbox to subscribe to the post again. When you are happy, 
click on Submit and you will be taken back to the post page, with your reply added 
to the topic.
Topic and Reply Management
If you are either a Keymaster or a Moderator, you will have access to the advanced 
features for topics. These are presented to you when you are browsing the forum 
so that they can be easily accessed. You will be able to see these options by default 
above each post, and they are crucial to know about, if you are managing your 
forum. They are shown in the following screenshot:

Taking Your First Steps with bbPress
[ 32 ]
Edit
Edit is available to all the users depending on how far you limit them to edit 
their posts. However, Moderators and Keymasters can edit posts at any point of 
time. Clicking on Edit will take you to a page where you can make changes to the 
post. However, at the bottom, there is a Keep a Log Of this Edit checkbox and an 
Optional Reason for Editing textbox. Tick the checkbox and give a reason if needed. 
If you have kept a log, it will be displayed under the edited post as shown in the 
following screenshot:
If you want your forum to be a success, then you would have to be 
open with your community. Editing posts and not giving reasons, or 
even worse, editing them without any visual notification to let people 
know that their posts have been edited, can lead to members leaving 
forums. So try to justify your actions.
Closed/open topics
This option will close or open the topic to new replies. Generally, if a discussion ends 
up going wildly off the topic with only few people adding valuable posts, or if it 
descends into an argument, it's a good idea to close the discussion for new replies.

Chapter 2
[ 33 ]
Stick/unstick (to front)
This option will stick the topic to the top of the page. Generally, users will 
probably ask you to do this if they have an important discussion or event going on. 
Alternatively, you may do this if the topic proves useful to the new users, and you 
want them to see this.
You can also make it a Super Sticky topic by clicking on To Front.
Merge topics
Occasionally, users will accidentally create two topics asking exactly the same thing 
at the same time. It may therefore be necessary to merge the two topics together.  
This can be done using "Merge".
Clicking on Merge will take you to a screen that looks something like this:

Taking Your First Steps with bbPress
[ 34 ]
Any page where you click on Merge will merge that topic with the destination topic. 
You may want to click on Merge for a later post or for a topic that has the least 
activity. In the drop-down list under Destination, select the post on your forum, and 
then click on Submit. This will merge the two topics together, maintaining the order 
in which replies were posted. Remember, this process cannot be undone.
You can only merge topics within a forum, and cannot cross forums.
Trash
Trashing a post removes it from the forum. It's a good idea to trash posts that  
are just taking up space, for example, posts from the same user that are accidentally 
posted twice.
Spam
If you click on Spam, it removes the post from the forum, marks it for deletion, and 
also marks it as spam. Therefore, any future posts by that user may also be marked 
as spam. This is done if users are deliberately posting topics that are hateful, overly 
advertising, or are full of links to their other sites.
Summary
You should now have the beginning of a successful forum. It's a good idea before 
starting a forum to post a few topics to give your new users something to reply to.
You should also begin now to advertise your forum around. By doing so, you will 
begin to get people to visit your forum. People need to be managed though. In the 
next chapter, we will talk about user management.

User Management in bbPress
By now you should be getting more traffic on your site, and also begin to see people 
signing up to your site and participating in your forum. While this is a great thing 
and the majority of people visiting your site will be welcomed, it can cause a few 
issues every now and again, with troublesome users.
Thankfully, bbPress does come with a multitude of features on how to deal with the 
most important asset to your forum—its members. Members can make or break your 
forum, so it is vital you manage them effectively. As such, this chapter will give you 
all the tools to help you manage your members and present them in the best light, 
and will cover the following topics:
•	
Gravatars – what are they and how to create one
•	
Your user profile – what it contains and how to make changes to it
•	
User roles – what each role is and what capabilities they have
•	
How to set users to each of the roles in question
By the end of the chapter, you should have all the tools you need to manage your 
forum effectively. Now let's begin by giving you the tools that will help you to set up 
your profile perfectly.
Setting up your administration profile
As it is your forum, you will be seen as the leader of it, and as such it's a good idea to 
set up your profile as thoroughly as possible, and include as many ways as possible 
for users to get in contact with you with grievances or suggestions. This first section 
of the chapter will guide you through how to set up your profile.

User Management in bbPress
[ 36 ]
Signing up for Gravatar
The easiest way to stand out in your forum is to use a Gravatar. Gravatar stands for 
Globally Recognised Avatar and it's a service owned by Automattic, which allows 
you to use the same avatar (a picture associated with yourself) on any Gravatar-
enabled site—effectively, any WordPress site. It is automatic, so set this up once and 
then any site that is Gravatar-enabled will show your Gravatar if you use your e-mail 
address on it.
All Gravatars are tied to an e-mail address, so make 
sure you use the same e-mail address that is associated 
with your administration account with bbPress.
To set up your Gravatar, please follow these steps:
1.	 Go to http://www.gravatar.com, and halfway down the page you should 
have a box where you can enter your e-mail address. Enter it and click on the 
Get Your Gravatar button.

Chapter 3
[ 37 ]
2.	 An e-mail will be sent to the address, containing a link for you to click on. 
Click on it and set up your profile with a username and password. You will 
then be taken to the Manage Gravatars screen.
3.	 On this screen, there will be a link halfway down the page that will prompt 
you to upload an image. Click on this link and choose an image source (be 
it your computer, the Internet, or a previously uploaded image). Find or 
upload your image and then you'll be given the opportunity to crop or size 
your image. When finished, click on Crop and Finish! and you'll be taken to 
a screen asking you to choose the rating of your image.
www.allitebooks.com

User Management in bbPress
[ 38 ]
4.	 Give your image an appropriate rating (most will be a G or PG, unless your 
image is likely to offend) and you will be taken back to the home screen, with 
your avatar displayed next to your default e-mail address (if you have only 
one e-mail address and only one image).
5.	 Now return to your bbPress forum and log in. If you visit any of your posts, 
you should see your Gravatar displayed next to your posts, as shown in the 
following screenshot:
6.	 You can change the avatar at any time by going back to  
http://www.gravatar.com/, logging in with your Gravatar username  
and password, and uploading a replacement to be associated with your 
e-mail address.
Adding and amending details to your user 
profile
There are two ways in which changes can be made to your profile. We will look at 
the second way later, as it is related to administrating the forum, but as we are just 
dealing with a user profile, we'll edit the profile in a more conventional manner to 
those familiar with WordPress.
When you have logged in to your bbPress account on your bbPress forum, a black 
bar will appear along the top of the screen. Towards the right of the bar is your 
designated bbPress name. If you hover over your name, a drop-down menu will 
appear similar to the one shown in the following screenshot. Click on the Edit My 
Profile link to edit your profile.

Chapter 3
[ 39 ]
You will be taken to a page within the WordPress administration that allows you 
to edit your profile. This page is split into three sections by default and depending 
on the plugins that you add to the site, you could have more options than the ones 
that we are going to see. The following sections detail the information that you can 
change or edit on this page (these are the ones available by default).
Personal Options
The Personal Options section includes largely the display options for your 
administration sections, and are therefore personal preferences, and not  
displayed to anybody else.
Admin Color Scheme
The Admin Color Scheme section allows you to change the color scheme for the 
administration section. With the exception of the toolbar, you won't see this usually, 
so unless you want to color-coordinate your toolbar with the rest of the site, it 
shouldn't matter.
Toolbar
The Toolbar option allows you to hide the toolbar. This could be handy if the toolbar 
covers up menus or other items, but usually I leave this switched on.
This option hides the toolbar from your whole WordPress site, 
not just the bbPress forum. This is worth bearing in mind.

[ 40 ]
Name
The Name section allows you to set your first and last name, as well as a nickname 
and the option to display your name publicly. Please note that any information you 
place here could be displayed on the site, so don't place anything here that you don't 
want to display publicly.
It's a good idea to either use your first name or a nickname as 
your display name, rather than your username.
Contact Info
The Contact Info section allows you to fill in your contact details for various online 
services such as AOL Instant Messenger, Yahoo! Instant Messenger, and Google 
Talk, as well as specify a website and your e-mail address.
If you run a website, it's probably a good idea to include your website as this will be 
listed on your profile. The most important section, however, is your e-mail address. 
This is because it is the point of contact if you ever forget your password and need to 
reset your password. Therefore, you need to make sure your e-mail address is correct 
and you have access to it. When you change your e-mail address, I recommend you 
either attempt to reset your password or send yourself an e-mail, to make sure that 
your e-mail address is correct.
About Yourself
The About Yourself section allows you to enter a short biography about yourself. 
This information is displayed on your profile if anyone views your profile, so include 
whatever you wish and wouldn't mind being displayed publicly.
New password
The final couple of boxes on your Dashboard page will allow you to change your 
password. This should be the first thing you do when you sign up to a bbPress 
forum, as the passwords are automatically generated and are difficult to remember. 
Make your new password easy for you to remember, yet make sure the password 
is strong with letters, numbers, and punctuation marks. The strength indicator will 
give you an idea of how strong the password is.
If you change your password, you will be prompted to log in to your site again; 
when logged in again, you should notice that your profile has been saved with all 
your new details.

Chapter 3
[ 41 ]
If you are signing up to somebody else's bbPress forum, you 
may want to check what information is displayed publicly 
and what information isn't. bbPress does allow details to be 
displayed easily, so a general rule of thumb is to not include 
anything that you wouldn't tell somebody publicly.
User roles
Not every forum user is created equal, and I've already mentioned words that may 
have confused you, such as "Moderator" and "Keymaster". The User Roles section 
will talk about the different roles each user can have and their capabilities.
It should be noted that since bbPress 2.2, the user roles of bbPress have been separate 
from the user roles of WordPress, so rest assured that setting user roles will allow 
users to access the forum separately from the rest of the site.
Keymaster
Keymaster is the role every administrator of your site is assigned. Keymasters have 
full control over everything associated with your forum. They have the ability to 
change the user levels of all other users. Keymasters also have the ability to create, 
edit, and delete all forums, and create, edit, and delete all forum topics and replies. 
They can manage tags as well as have access to all forum moderation tools, such as 
merging posts, making posts sticky, and closing posts.
They can also block members, and are also the only ones who can undo deleted posts 
should they still be in the trash.
Keymasters also have access to hidden forums.
As it is a powerful role, you really should have only one Keymaster (yourself).
It is also a good, secure tactic if the Keymaster account isn't used 
for posting on your forum, as users will then know the username 
of the Keymaster account; and if you have an unsecure password, 
the Keymaster account could easily be accessed.

User Management in bbPress
[ 42 ]
Moderator
Moderator is the next level, and they can do quite a lot. Moderators can create and 
edit their own forums, and can also create, edit, and delete other users' topics and 
replies. They can also manage tags as well as have access to all forum-moderation 
tools such as merging posts, making posts sticky, and closing posts.
They are unable to block members or promote members to moderators.  
However, they can access hidden forums.
If you regularly post on your forum (which you should), you should probably do 
it under a Moderator account rather than a Keymaster account. However, when 
you are just beginning your forum, you should probably only have one Moderator 
account. However, as the forum grows and workload increases, you should promote 
some trusted members to Moderators. For most forums, Moderators won't have 
much work to do, but it is a good idea to have a couple to cover eventualities on 
moderately busy forums.
Participant
A Participant is the default role for most forums, and will be assigned the level of 
new users if you do not change the default settings.
Participants can create their own topics and replies, as well as edit their own topics 
and replies within the time limit set in the forum.
Participants cannot access the hidden forums and cannot see them either. However, 
they can see and post in private forums, which are assigned the suffix Private:.
As stated earlier, if you want new members to post straight away, set the default user 
role for new members to Participant.
Spectator
Spectators are members who can read all forums (including private forums when 
logged in). However, they are unable to post. They can edit their profile details, and 
so will have a page on the site available to them.
Unless you explicitly set new members to be spectators (who only have the ability to 
post after you approve each member and turn them into a Participant), you probably 
will not use the Spectator level too much.
One use of the Spectator level though is for temporarily banning members for 24 
hours, say for a warning, for spamming, or for being offensive. However, you will 
have to manually return them to the Participant level once their ban is complete.

Chapter 3
[ 43 ]
Blocked
Blocked members have no access whatsoever to the forum; instead, the page shown 
will be a Page not found page. An example of what a Blocked member sees is shown 
in the following screenshot:
They still have access to their user profile and can fill information on it, but they will 
be unable to access the forum.
The Blocked role should be reserved for members who are disruptive and cause 
trouble, rather than spambots who sign up to the forum. Spam bots should be 
deleted and their posts marked as spam, as if you have an Akismet account (which 
will be discussed in the next chapter), marking posts as spam will contribute to a 
global database of spam posts, which will help prevent bots spamming your forum 
and other forums in the future.
By blocking members, you block their e-mail address, preventing them from signing 
up to your forum again.

User Management in bbPress
[ 44 ]
It's worth noting that Blocked members can still read the forum if they are logged 
out of their account, but are unable to contribute. The only way to prevent this is by 
making every one of your forums private, but that will affect signups, as potential 
members won't be able to read the forum before signing up. It isn't worth sabotaging 
your forum's growth in order to stop a small number of Blocked members from 
reading your posts.
You can get an up-to-date guide to each user role and their 
capabilities at http://codex.bbpress.org/bbpress-
user-roles-and-capabilities/.
Changing user levels on a large scale
Sometimes there may be a need to change user levels on a mass scale, such  
as blocking a large number of accounts or changing accounts from Spectator  
to Participant.
In the WordPress administration, while logged in as a Keymaster, click on the Users 
menu item, and you'll be taken to a page similar to the following screenshot, with a 
list of all users and e-mail addresses associated with the users:

Chapter 3
[ 45 ]
Along the left-hand side of the screen, you'll see a checkbox next to each name. Select 
the checkbox next to each user whose role you wish to change, and then in the third 
drop-down box above the Username heading (next to the Change forum role to… 
dropdown) select the forum role you wish to change the user accounts to; now click 
on the Change button to the right. This will change all selected users' roles to the 
forum role selected.
Changing user levels individually
The mass-changing method described previously is fine for changing multiple users, 
but what if you are browsing the forum and want to quickly block or upgrade a 
user? Luckily, there's an easy way to do this from within the forum itself.
On browsing the forum, you will notice that any mention of a user's name is 
hyperlinked. This links to their profile page (similar to the one you set up for yourself 
at the beginning of this chapter). There will be links in the sidebar of the profile page, 
and if you are logged in as a Keymaster you will see an Edit link. Click it and you will 
be taken to a page where you can edit any information given for the user. Near the 
bottom, you will see a User Role section as shown in the following screenshot:
The second drop-down box will allow you to select a forum role for the user. Select 
the chosen forum role and then click on Update User. This will update that user to 
the selected forum role.

User Management in bbPress
[ 46 ]
While you can edit a fair amount of a user's account on this page, 
it is recommended that unless asked by the user, you don't change 
anything as long as it doesn't break your forum's rules. If so, tell the 
user. Changing user information can lead to mistrust and people 
leaving your forum. Sometimes, even broken rules are better fixed 
with a notice asking the user to change it before you do.
Deleting spam accounts
Spam accounts are not wanted on any forum, and are better dealt with when they are 
deleted for good.
We will get into dealing with spam in the next chapter, with two methods on how to 
prevent it; however, even with these two methods enabled, some spam may occur 
and it accumulates over time. In reality, the best way to deal with it is to delete it.
In your WordPress administration, visit the Users page, and just like the method 
described previously for mass editing, click on the checkbox next to every user you 
wish to delete.
In the Bulk Actions dropbox, which is located above the checkboxes, select Delete 
and click on Apply. You will then be offered a choice on what to do with the posts 
this user has made, as shown in the following screenshot:

Chapter 3
[ 47 ]
As it is a spam account, select Delete all posts and then click on Confirm Deletion. 
The user will then be deleted. Spam users don't get a notification when they are 
classified as spam accounts.

[ 48 ]
Summary
Right now, you should have a bustling forum, ably overseen by yourself and maybe 
even a couple of Moderators.
Remember that all I have described so far has been how to use bbPress to manage 
your forum, and not how to manage your forum. Each forum will have its own rules 
and guidelines, and you will eventually learn how to manage your bbPress forum 
with more and more members joining in.
A general rule of thumb, though, is set out your rules at the start of your forum, 
welcome change, act quickly on violations, and most importantly, treat your users 
with respect. As without users, you will have a very quiet forum.
That's it! We have discussed all that bbPress can do as a plugin. However, bbPress is 
a WordPress plugin, and in itself can be extensible and can take advantage of plugins 
and themes, both specifically designed for bbPress or even those that work with 
WordPress.
In the next chapter we will look at a range of plugins—some of which have 
specifically designed with bbPress in mind—designed to extend your forum, making 
it similar to other more expensive forum management systems. Now the fun starts!

Extending bbPress  
Using Plugins
One of the reasons why bbPress is popular is because when installed on your 
website, it is light. bbPress is designed so that when installed, it doesn't corrupt your 
current site or slow it down. However that does come at a small price as straight out 
of the box, bbPress doesn't quite have the multitude of features that other solutions 
offer. This is easily fixed by plugins.
Plugins are additional modules designed to expand the functionality of WordPress 
and bbPress. In fact, bbPress itself is a plugin of WordPress. As WordPress is 
open source, the majority of the WordPress and bbPress plugins are made by 
communities. Some are unsupported, whereas others have full support. As such, this 
chapter will help you navigate the vast WordPress plugin library as well as the 100 
plus or so bbPress plugins; by the end of the chapter, you will learn the following 
topics:
•	
How to use plugins to add the following features to your bbPress forum
•	
How to prevent your forum from being spammed
•	
Adding signatures to your posts
•	
Adding attachments to your posts
•

•	
Highlighting unread posts
•	
How to create a User(s) online section of the site allowing you to see who is 
online at any time on your forum
•	
Questions to ask yourself before adding a bbPress plugin to your site
•	
Common bbPress functions on how to make your own plugin

Extending bbPress Using Plugins
[ 50 ]
By the end of this chapter, you should have a much more feature-rich forum, know 
all about the plugin library on WordPress, and may even be confident enough to 
build your own plugins.
As we have a lot to cover in this chapter, I'm going to skip 
explaining how to install and activate plugins. Both processes 
were covered in Chapter 1, Getting Started with bbPress, where we 
discussed installing and activating bbPress. A similar process is 
involved here. I will tell you what I search for in each plugin.
Spam protection
A crucial component, on which many successful forums are judged, is the ability to 
deal with spam posts. Spam is unfortunately a fact of life on the Internet these days, 
but luckily, tools are getting better at combating this. WordPress has two bbPress 
compatible tools that can be used to combat spam.
Blocking spam posts – Akismet
Akismet is written by Automattic to help prevent spam posts. It collects anonymous 
data from your site via a key, collates it with all other Akismet activated services, 
and analyzes comments and posts to find a common connection on spam and use 
that to automatically mark future posts as spam.
Akismet comes with WordPress, so activate it (if not, you can find an installation of 
it if you search for the plugin repository for Akismet). You will be prompted to enter 
your Akismet key, as shown in the following screenshot:
The following steps are to be taken to reduce spam:
1.	 Go to http://www.akismet.com and click on Get a WordPress Key. Pick 
a plan, either Pro (if you run a commercial site) or Personal (if your site 
is nonprofit), and you will be encouraged to sign up via WordPress.com. 
Remember when you created an account for your Gravatar? The same details 
work here.
2.	 Click on I already have a WordPress.com account! and log in with the same 
username and password associated with your Gravatar account.

Chapter 4
[ 51 ]
3.	 Fill in some details, including payment details if needed, and then click on 
Finish. You will then receive an e-mail with the API key. Keep this safe, as 
you should use it only on your sites.
4.	 Click on Akismet, which is located as a subitem of Plugins in your 
WordPress dashboard, and enter your Akismet key in the box on the screen. 
Check Auto-delete spam submitted on posts more than a month old, and 
then click on Update Options. The warning should now disappear and you 
should receive a message saying your key has been verified. Your forum's 
spam has been reduced, saving you time.
Blocking spam registrations – WP-reCAPTCHA
Blocking posts is fine, but even if they can't post, they can still register for your site. 
These accounts place links in their profile, which means that they could harm your 
site in the eyes of Google. Also, checking each profile and then removing all the links 
and blocking users can take time.

Extending bbPress Using Plugins
[ 52 ]
An easy way to block users signing up for spam accounts is to use WP-reCAPTCHA. 
This plugin uses the reCAPTCHA technology (a familiar sight for many Internet 
users) to block users who are unable to fill in an extra field (which many bots 
cannot). reCAPTCHA is a technology owned by Google and is free and relatively 
easy to set up.
The following are the steps to be performed for using the reCAPTCHA technology:
1.	 Search for WP-reCAPTCHA and install the one by Jorge Pena (it should be called 
WP-reCAPTCHA). Upon activation, its menu will appear as a submenu of 
Settings. Click on WP-reCAPTCHA, and a warning will appear as you need 
to enter your reCAPTCHA API keys.
2.	 To get your API keys, go to https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin/, 
and then sign in to the site using your Google account. Click on Add a New 
Site and you should get a screen similar to the following screenshot:

Chapter 4
[ 53 ]
3.	 Fill in your domain and click on Create Key. You will be given a public 
key and a private key. Both keys should not be shared. Copy these to 
somewhere safe, and then return to the WP-reCAPTCHA options page and 
enter the public and private keys in the relevant boxes under authentication. 
Uncheck the Enable form for Comments option, unless you get a lot of spam 
comments, and then click on Save reCAPTCHA Settings.
4.	 The notification should now disappear, but you should check to see if the 
plugin is working. Log out of your site and go to your login URL and click on 
the Register button located at the bottom of the login page. You should see 
something that looks similar to the following screenshot:
GD bbPress Tools
One of the most advanced and useful plugins out there at the moment for bbPress 
is GD bbPress Tools. It does quite a lot to expand bbPress, so you should look at 
installing this now. Install it by searching for GD bbPress Tools to begin with.

Extending bbPress Using Plugins
[ 54 ]
Click on the Tools submenu item, which is located beneath Forums, and you should 
see a large page of options as shown in the following screenshot:
You can leave the JavaScript and CSS settings checked, but here's what each major 
heading does, as well as any option that needs further explanation.
Quote Topics and Replies
The Quote Topics and Replies feature allows you to quote other member's posts. 
Quoting can be useful if you are referencing another member's post in your post 
because it helps aid discussion, as people can follow conversations very easily as 
shown in the following screenshot:

Chapter 4
[ 55 ]
This section adds a button to the top bar, clearly seen in the preceding screenshot, 
to various user levels. By default this is switched on, located above all posts, and 
available to all users. There's no reason you should change any of this, as it adds a 
useful feature to your forum.
Toolbar Menu
The Toolbar Menu option adds on an item, Forums, to the top of the Dashboard 
toolbar, which shows up for logged in users. This gives users the ability to quickly 
access the forums from anywhere on the site, and can be activated for all users and is 
switched on by default. Again, there's no reason to turn this off.
User Signatures
The User Signatures option is split into two sections, and the result is the ability to 
display signatures beneath users' posts similar to the following screenshot:
The first set of options allows you to define the ability for each user level to create 
signatures and also how long the signature should be. 512 characters is the default, 
and in reality you shouldn't change this much, as we don't want large signatures that 
dominate the discussion.

Extending bbPress Using Plugins
[ 56 ]
The second set of options allows users to use either BBCode or HTML in their 
signatures, which will allow people to post images or links in their signatures.  
It's generally quite a good idea for security reasons to either set this to BBCode or 
disable this feature, as rogue HTML could affect the look of the forum. Also, if too 
many members post spam links in their footer, or show very large images, you can 
disable this so that only Moderators and Keymasters can have access to rich content 
in their signatures.
Limit bbPress access on admin side
The Limit bbPress access on admin side feature controls which users, dependent 
on their role, can see and access bbPress administration panels. For security reasons, 
leave this option switched off.
BBCodes
BBCodes is a universal forum notation for displaying rich content. By default, 
bbPress uses HTML via a rich text editor; however, if you have a large forum of 
experienced users, it could be worthwhile enabling BBCodes.
BBCodes uses slightly different notation than HTML using square brackets to 
display data. So for example, if you wish to display a link to Google with the anchor 
text "Google", you would use the following BBCode:
[url=http://www.google.com]Google[/url]
There are two reasons to use BBCode over HTML. First, it's slightly easier to use 
than HTML so can be useful for less technically advanced members. Secondly, it 
is slightly more secure than raw HTML; however, bbPress does strip out a lot of 
misformatted HTML.
In GD bbPress Tools, click on the BBCodes tab along the top of the screen, and you 
will be taken to the BBCodes option page. We will discuss each option individually 
and its recommended setting.
BBCodes support
The BBCodes support option switches on or off BBCode support throughout the 
site. By default it is switched on. If you don't wish for your forum to have BBCode 
support, uncheck this box.

Chapter 4
[ 57 ]
BBCodes new topic/reply notice
The BBCodes new topic/reply notice option displays a notice above new posts and 
replies informing users that they can post BBCodes to format their content. There 
really isn't much more to add to this, and it's entirely up to you whether you display 
this message or not.
However, one issue is that the message displayed in the following screenshot isn't 
exactly the most helpful:
Therefore, it's a good idea to create a page on your site with a list of the BBCodes you 
can use. A list is available on this option page to the right of the screen.
Limit to bbPress only
The Limit to bbPress only option, when checked, allows BBCodes to be used 
throughout the site (for example, in comments). Generally it's a bad idea to add 
BBCodes to comment forms, as it increases the success rate of spambots, so  
leave this unchecked.
Advanced BBCodes
The Advanced BBCodes option allows you to set the user level in which advanced 
BBCodes (such as URL, YouTube, Vimeo, Google, Image, and Note) are used on the 
site. Generally I'd leave this, since here, every user level can post all types of content; 
however, if it becomes unmanageable, you can set this so that only Moderators and 
Keymasters can post rich content.
Views
GD bbPress Tools also adds on a couple of Views pages. These are useful when 
building out your forum and integrating it with your bbPress theme, as these 
provide a customized list of posts that you can place within your theme.
To access the views settings on the GD bbPress Tools option page, click the Views 
tab located along the top.

Extending bbPress Using Plugins
[ 58 ]
The following are the views you can edit:
•	
Topics With The Most Replies: This is the list of the most popular topics on 
the forum sorted by those with the most replies.
•	
Topics Search: This page is the search results page. A widget is added to 
bbPress, which we will discuss later, and it allows you to search topics.  
This view is the search results page.
•	
Latest Topics: This will show all the latest topics on the forum, organized by 
date, with the latest first.
There is really no reason whatsoever to switch any of these off, so leave these  
options checked.
In addition to the three views you can switch on and off, there is 
another view added, Topics With No Replies, which will allow you 
to view all the topics with no replies. It's a good idea when growing 
the forum to answer all topics, so this can help you find unanswered 
topics and reply to them.
Attachments – GD bbPress attachments
On some forums, you can upload attachments to posts allowing you to share extra 
information to registered users (such as an image or a text file). It's not for every 
forum, but for some forums, you may wish for users to upload attachments.
Luckily there's a plugin called GD bbPress attachments that handles this—the safest 
and the most secure of every plugin I've seen—as it uses WordPress' inbuilt media 
uploader to manage the attachments. To install this plugin, search for GD bbPress 
Attachments in the plugin library. When installed, go to the Attachments page 
located as a submenu of Forums. When visited, there's quite a large Settings page 
that does need setting up before using the plugin.
Global Attachment Settings
The Global Attachment Settings section allows you to set up the global  
attachment settings for the forum. These settings apply to all uploads,  
no matter the type or the location.

Chapter 4
[ 59 ]
Maximum File Size
Maximum File Size allows you to set the maximum file size of each upload.  
By default, each upload is half a megabyte (512 KB) in size. It's quite a good idea 
to leave this the same, as it prevents people from uploading huge files, such as 
unoptimized photos. Each uploaded file contributes to your limit on your site,  
so be careful.
Maximum Files To Upload
The Maximum Files To Upload option allows you to set the maximum number of 
files to upload per topic or reply. By default, the most files you can upload is four.
I would consider dropping the number of files people 
can upload to one or two, especially for busy forums.
Hide The List Of Attached Files From Visitors
The Hide The List Of Attached Files From Visitors option helps you to hide the 
list of files attached to each post by visitors. By default, the box is checked, and I 
recommend you keep it checked. Visitors accessing files could at best increase your 
bandwidth costs, or at worse access sensitive information uploaded by native users.
Users Upload Restrictions
The Users Upload Restrictions option sets the user level, where the Upload option 
will be displayed. Depending on the forum, you may wish that only Moderators or 
Keymasters have access to the Upload option. If this isn't the case, it's a good idea to 
leave this option the same.
Topic and Reply Deleting
Topic and Reply Deleting sets the fate of uploaded files if their parent topic or reply 
is deleted. By default, they are set to be left in the media library. I'd recommend that 
to save space, they should be deleted. You can select Do Nothing, which deletes a 
post, yet leaves the attachment present on the post. I don't recommend this option.

Extending bbPress Using Plugins
[ 60 ]
JavaScript and CSS Settings
This JavaScript and CSS Settings option allows you to disable JavaScript and CSS 
for styling attachments. This should only be unchecked if you want to include the 
site's JavaScript or CSS anyway; however, I'd recommend leaving these checked.
If you are embedding your forum elsewhere on your site, I'd also recommend 
checking the box below, which will enable JavaScript and CSS on all pages (not just 
bbPress forums).
Error Logging
Error Logging allows you to log upload errors. This can be useful for 
troubleshooting upload issues that the users have. There's no reason to switch these 
options off, unless the forum becomes so big and bloated with people making errors 
and uploading these errors that it becomes troublesome. Most forums should leave 
these settings on though.
Deleting Attachments
The Deleting Attachments settings allow you to delete and detach attachments. 
Deleting removes them completely from the site, and detaching removes them from 
the topic or reply yet leaves them in the media library. You can choose whether 
Keymasters, Moderators, or post authors have this option.
I recommend allowing Keymasters and Moderators to have the 
ability to delete and detach, and authors only have the ability to 
detach. Giving authors "delete" capabilities could be troublesome, but 
allowing them to detach files can't cause harm.
Forums Integration
The Forums Integration option allows you to display icons for common file types that 
aren't images. To aid usability, I'd recommend keeping these options switched on.
Display of Image Attachments
Rather than display icons for image attachments, you can display images as 
thumbnails. If you activate this, you will see a thumbnail of the image beneath the 
forum post as shown in the following screenshot:

Chapter 4
[ 61 ]
I recommend activating this but hiding the caption (as you can see in my picture, 
the "caption" is the filename). You can give this a CSS class to give some CSS 
styling to the image, and give it a REL attribute. By default, the REL attribute is 
lightbox. If you have a jQuery lightbox plugin activated on the site (for example 
"jQuerylightbox"), you will be able to get the image to open in a lightbox window 
when clicked.
Image Thumbnails Size
The Image Thumbnails Size option will change the thumbnail size of the image 
located beneath the post. It is recommended that though you set this to a size when 
you first launch the forum, and never change this, to keep this uniform throughout  
the site.

Improved e-mail notifications – bbPress 
Email Notifications
Although without any plugins, bbPress does provide pretty good e-mail 
notifications; it is missing quite a lot of functionality, particularly when it comes 
to merge and split topics. To rectify this, search for and install the bbPress Email 
Notifications in the WordPress plugin repository.
This plugin requires no setup, but adds on a section within the user's profile page 
that allows you to set up whether or not they should receive e-mail notifications from 
the forum as shown in the following screenshot:
These settings are only for one user rather than for all users, so users subscribed to 
topics can disable e-mails using this plugin. This is useful for busy forums, so well 
worth installing.

Viewing unread topics – bbPress  
unread posts
On many forums, you will be able to see topics with unread replies allowing users to 
browse their forum more quickly and easily than normal. Thankfully, there are lots 
of plugins out there with lots of different functionalities on how to display unread 
topics. A personal favorite of mine is bbPress unread posts. Search for bbPress 
Unread Posts in the WordPress plugin repository and install it.
There is no setup for this plugin, and when installed, an icon next to each of the posts 
will be displayed. The icon will change depending on whether you have read all the 
replies in that topic or not, as shown in the following screenshot:
Beneath the forums, as you can see in the screenshot, there is a Mark all topics as 
Read button. Clicking this marks all the topics in the forum as read, saving time.

View users online – WP-UserOnline
For busy forums, it can be great to see the users who are currently online. Having a 
list of users currently online can help generate more topics and replies, as users can 
see other people logged on and browsing the forum at the same time, and therefore 
could post more. A good plugin to use for this is actually a WordPress plugin, 
WP-UserOnline. Search and install WP-UserOnline from the WordPress plugin 
repository and visit the UserOnline Settings page located under the Settings menu.
Here are each of the options and their values. By default, the plugin is set up 
perfectly for our forum, but here's what each option does.
Time Out
Time Out displays how long a user appears in the UsersOnline Options page 
without any changes before they are removed. By default it's 300 seconds; I 
recommend using this.

Chapter 4
[ 65 ]
UserOnline URL
If you create a blank page, you can create a page that will display the current users 
online. As most of the time we will be using the Widget function to display the users 
online, we don't really need to worry about this URL.
Link User Names To Their Author Page
The Link User Names To Their Author Page option needs to be unchecked for 
bbPress. Very few, if any of the users of your site will be authors, so this will lead to 
a lot of blank pages. It's far easier to leave this unchecked.
Naming Conventions / UserOnline Templates
The Naming Conventions/UserOnline Templates settings are aimed at how to 
display the user lists on the site. By default the language used is English, so if you  
are creating a foreign language site, you may wish to change this.
This page uses a lot of variables that are replaced with text. Here is the list of the 
variables used and what it is replaced with on the site:
Variable
Explanation
%COUNT%
Displays the number of users, guests, or bots on the site
%USERS%
This variable displays the total number of users, guests, and 
bots on the site
%PAGE_URL%
This variable displays the URL to the UsersOnline page
%MOSTONLINE_COUNT%
This variable displays the total number of the most frequent 
users, guests, and bots online
%MOSTONLINE_DATE%
The date when most of the regular users, guests, and bots 
were online
%MEMBERS%
Displays the members' text (by default %COUNT% Members)
%MEMBER_NAMES%
The display name of all members, separated by a comma by 
default
%GUESTS_SEPARATOR%
The separator associated with guests, default comma
%GUESTS%
Displays the guests' text (defined earlier in the  
page – the default is %COUNT% Guests)
%BOTS_SEPARATOR%
The separator associated with bots, default comma
%BOTS%
Displays the bots' text (defined earlier in the page – the 
default is %COUNT% Bots)

If you are not using a UserOnline URL for a separate page, remove the link from the 
Users Online template. The following code explains how to do this before removing 
the link:
<a href="%PAGE_URL%"><strong>%USERS%</strong> Online</a>
In order to remove the link, change the preceding code to the following code:
<strong>%USERS%</strong> Online
Plugin checks – what to look for when 
installing plugins?
Although plugins are great in expanding the functionality of blogs, unfortunately 
it stands to reason that the more number of plugins you install on your website, the 
more likely you develop issues on your site.
With WordPress (and therefore bbPress) being open source, the beauty is that 
although plugins and themes can be developed by everybody, somebody has 
probably made a plugin with what you want to do. Unfortunately, because plugins 
can be developed by everybody, and not everybody may adhere to the strictest 
guidelines, they may develop issues.
Issues can take a multitude of forms, but the following are the most common  
key issues:
•	
The plugin causes conflicts. This happens because of poor coding on the part 
of one of the plugin's coders, and it conflicts with another plugin or with 
WordPress itself.
•	
The plugin is depreciated. This means that the plugin's author doesn't 
support the plugin anymore, and as such WordPress may have changed a 
function that the plugin uses or is no longer within WordPress (this can cause 
errors).
They are the two main issues that strike many plugins. There are occasional cases 
whereby the plugin has fallen into malicious hands, but generally the community is 
great at dealing with this sort of issue and removing malicious plugins.
However for the other two issues, you are unlikely to get much support, and as 
such you need to rely on your own judgement. Here are a few questions you can ask 
yourself before installing a plugin to your site.

Chapter 4
[ 67 ]
Question 1 – when was the plugin  
last updated?
When you view a potential plugin on WordPress.org through a Google search, you 
can see when the plugin was last updated. Generally this is a good indication of how 
well the plugin is supported. The plugins that are most supported are updated to 
work with the latest version before the latest version is usually released, and many 
plugins are updated after a version is released; it's only when the plugin's author has 
lost interest and it is no longer updated when this can be dangerous.
Some plugins actively state they are no longer being updated, but down the  
right-hand side of the plugin page (for example, http://wordpress.org/extend/
plugins/incomment-referrer/), you can see the date the plugin was last updated. 
Furthermore, on plugins that are not updated since last two years, you get the 
following notification:
Generally try to avoid installing the plugins that are over two years old since their 
last update, as WordPress generally operates on about 3 to 4 month development 
cycles. So these plugins were in all likelihood tested on versions that are between 6 
and 8 versions behind the current ones.
Plugins that are over two years old do not appear in any 
of WordPress' internal plugin searches.

Extending bbPress Using Plugins
[ 68 ]
Question 2 – how well is the  
plugin supported?
Beneath the plugin's author details, in the right-hand column, is the Support  
section; the following screenshot gives you an idea of how active the support is  
on each plugin:
Authors of plugins can mark threads as being resolved, and as such you can see how 
active the author is at fixing faults with the plugin. An actively supported plugin 
generally means you will have fewer problems with it.
You are able to release a plugin into the community 
unsupported if it's specified, or you can also offer paid 
support. As such, this question should be asked in 
conjunction with other questions, rather than on its own.
Question 3 – does the community say  
it works?
The bottom box in the right-hand column contains anonymous community feedback 
on whether a plugin works or not. Quite simply, if the plugin either says Works!  
(as shown in the following screenshot), or there's inconclusive data, it's worth trying:

Chapter 4
[ 69 ]
This requires quite a lot of data to work, and as such, many plugins 
have Inconclusive or No Data as an answer. Nevertheless, it can be 
worth checking particularly for popular plugins.
Question 4 – anything incriminating on  
search engines?
Probably one of the best things you can do is search for the plugin in a search engine. 
Generally, security issues or anything that breaks it usually results in a blog post 
appearing online from a disgruntled individual or a support thread on a forum.  
Try searching for the plugin name before installation.
Please don't let this section put you off from installing plugins. 
The majority of WordPress and bbPress plugins adhere to high 
coding standards and very rarely things go wrong; however, 
just be aware that such issues can happen. If they do happen 
with your site, log in to the FTP area of your site, and then 
delete the offending plugin and your site will return to its 
previous state without any issues.

Actions and filters – developing your 
own bbPress plugins!
Still cannot find a solution to your issue? Want to get your hands dirty and fix an 
issue in someone else's plugin? Why not create your own plugin. Creating your own 
plugin, which is not only beneficial for the community, but can also have a positive 
effect on yourself, as it can lead to opportunities and help stake a claim for yourself 
in a great community.
As bbPress plugin development is an offshoot of WordPress plugin development, 
it is beyond the scope of this book. Check out WordPress Plugin Development: A 
Beginners Guide, Vladamir Prelovac, Packt Publishing at http://www.packtpub.com/
wordpress-plug-in-development/ for more in-depth information on developing 
WordPress plugins. However, we can cover some basics of plugin development, 
which anybody with a rudimentary knowledge of PHP should be familiar with.
Before beginning WordPress Plugin Development, please read the 
WordPress Coding Standards located at http://codex.wordpress.
org/WordPress_Coding_Standards; by doing so, you'll ensure 
that your plugin causes as little conflict as possible.
bbPress API – actions and functions
bbPress API has two features to it: actions and functions.
•	
Actions: These are the series of functions that are run at certain times during 
a page's execution. You can add your functions into these actions. These are 
used by template designers so that instead of repeating lines of code (for 
example, say the display of the author's name and Gravatar), they use one 
line of code.
•	
Functions: These are the pieces of code that allow you to do a certain task 
by using one line of code. bbPress functions allow you to interact with the 
bbPress page in question and also the database very easily.

Chapter 4
[ 71 ]
Adding your plugin's function to bbPress 
using action hooks
Suppose you have written a function called my_bbpress_function, and you want 
it to run before the forum description is displayed on the page. As such, you use the 
following code to run this:
add_action('bbp_theme_before_forum_description', 'my_bbpress_
function', $priority,$accepted_args );
The add_action call tells WordPress that the my_bbpress_function function is to 
be run whenever bbp_theme_before_description is run. Two optional variables 
are included in the call as well. $priority is a number in which the priority of the 
function is run in ascending numerical order (so a function with priority 1 is ran 
before a function with priority 10), and $accepted_args allows you to specify the 
amount of accepted arguments that are included in the function (so if your function 
is defined with two arguments, your $accepted_args must be set to 2)

allow developers to interact with the bbPress database without having to write  
their own functions.
The following table details the most common API functions. Before writing a 
function from scratch, check the following table to see if a similar function  
already exists:
Function Reference
Function Description
bbp_author_link

The preceding descriptions and references are taken from the 
bbPress Codex, which has full examples on how each action should 
be used. This codex is updated more often than this book, and 
you can see it at http://codex.bbpress.org.
Summary
By now, you should have a great, feature-rich forum and may even be interested 
in developing your own bbPress plugins. I strongly encourage you to do so, even 
if it is a case of releasing some code designed for your forum or possibly a client 
out in the public domain. This community, that I have been a part of, is one of the 
most wholesome and friendly communities, and has also led me to some great 
opportunities including writing this book that you are reading.
Even though the functionality is great, your forum may appear a little disjointed 
with the rest of your site. However, we will look into integrating your forum into 
your theme in the next and final chapter.


Adding bbPress to Your 
WordPress Theme
Everything in this book until now has been focused on functions in WordPress. 
We have learned various ways of making bbPress work and making it work well; 
however, the Internet is a visual tool, and as such to help present the information 
and help sell your forum to new members, it needs to look good.
This chapter will talk about adding style to your substance. bbPress uses WordPress 
themes, so we will look at how to integrate your theme with bbPress and examine 
each of the ways in which you can get your theme to display bbPress content. We 
will cover the following topics in this chapter:
•	
How to add bbPress widgets to your WordPress sidebar, as well as an 
explanation of each bbPress widget and how to add more
•	
The bbPress (and WordPress) template structure, and how it works
•	
How to make your template bbPress ready, and showing your visitors your 
forum for the first time
•	
How to create a forum-specific sidebar for your theme, which shows 
different content on the blog
By the end of this chapter, you'll have a complete understanding of bbPress's 
template structure and be confident to make changes to your site to make it look 
great. Your forum will be fully integrated with the rest of your site, and you can 
begin running your forum and promoting it.

Adding bbPress widgets to WordPress
WordPress uses a widget system to display sidebar content. Widgets allow users 
to add content and information to sidebars easily using a drag-and-drop system. 
Therefore, any user that has no experience in coding can easily change the look of 
a widget-enabled template without much work. Although traditionally used in 
sidebars, template designers can add widgets anywhere they please (something we 
will do later in this chapter).
To add widgets to WordPress, within the WordPress dashboard, click on Widgets, 
which is a submenu of the Appearance tab. You will see a screen similar to the 
following screenshot:
On the left-hand side of the screen, you will see the Available Widgets box. This box 
contains all the widgets that are currently installed and available to be used, either 
installed by plugins or by the theme itself. The right-hand side of the screen will have 
all the "widgetized" areas of your WordPress site. Good theme developers will give 
a short description above each widgetized area, but others may not. Either way, it 
should be fairly clear where the widget is located by the name of it.

Chapter 5
[ 77 ]
To install a widget, drag the widget from the left-hand column to the right-hand one.
Having problems accessing and modifying widgets? If you click 
on Screen Options (located in the top right-hand corner of the 
screen) and click on Enable Accessibility Mode, you will be able 
to use a more accessible menu system for creating widgets, which 
is compatible with all devices.
If present, there may be options associated with each widget, shown as follows:
Fill in these options if present and then click on Save to save the widget. Check your 
site and your widget should be present on the site.
You can now drag the widget in order to reorder it in the sidebar, or click on its title 
to open or close the options for that widget.
To delete a widget, click on the Delete option located in the bottom left-hand  
corner of the widget. This deletes everything associated with the widget, so be careful. 
A much safer option is to make the widget inactive. This removes it from the display 
area but keeps the settings intact.
To make the widget inactive, there is a box beneath Available Widgets on the  
left-hand side of the screen called Inactive Widgets. Drag the widget you want into 
this box to disable it. This will save the widget for a later date should you need to 
reactivate it.

Available bbPress widgets
bbPress comes with a number of widgets preinstalled. Here is what each widget 
does, and their options:
•	
(bbPress) Forums List: This adds on a list of forums to the sidebar. You can 
define a title for this widget, as well as define what forums are present. If you 
leave the default option, 0, the list will show only the parent forums and no 
subforums. Giving a forum ID number will display only that forum and any 
subforum of that forum. Typing any will show all forums.
•	
(bbPress) Login Widget: This will present a login widget and basic 
information if logged in. Like many other WordPress widgets, you can give 
a title, but you also need to provide a Register URI and a Lost Password 
URI. If unsure what to put here, place the following values (replacing 
mybbpressdomain.com with your domain name):
°°
Register URI: http://mybbpressdomain.com/wp-login.
php?action=register
°°
Lost Password URI: http://mybbpressdomain.com/wp-login.
php?action=lostpassword
•	
(bbPress) Recent Replies: This shows the most recent replies to the forum. 
You can specify a title as well as the number of replies to show, and also if 
you want to show the post date and author name.
•	
(bbPress) Recent Topics: This displays the most recent topics on the forum. 
You can specify a title, the number of topics to show, if the post's date and 
author are shown, and the order of the topics that are displayed.
•	
(bbPress) Topic Views: This allows you to display some preset views for the 
forum. These views are topics with no replies, topics with the most replies, 
the latest topics, and the search results.
Adding more widgets with GD  
bbPress widgets
There is a useful plugin called GD bbPress widgets that is worth installing, which 
you can do by searching and installing GD bbPress widgets from the plugin 
repository. It adds the following two widgets to bbPress:
•	
bbPress: Search Topics: This adds on a search field that allows you to search 
the forums. This is better than the default search field included in WordPress, 
as it searches the forum exclusively (rather than the topics, replies, posts, and 
pages). You can give it a title, as well as display this to everybody, or only 
users or visitors.

Chapter 5
[ 79 ]
•	
bbPress: Topics Views: This is very similar to the default Topics Views that 
is provided with bbPress. However, this will allow you to choose which topic 
views to display, and who to display them to.
I do recommend this version of Topics Views over the one 
that is included in bbPress, as you have more control; the 
Search Topics Views, for example, is almost completely 
redundant in the sidebar.
The bbPress (and WordPress)  
template structure
WordPress follows quite a simple principle for templating. In short, the minimum 
number of files needed to run a template is two, the index.php and style.css files. 
However, you can add on a number of template files so that individual pages or 
posts can have their own style. If a template file isn't present, WordPress reverts to 
the previous file in the template hierarchy; a full guide to the template hierarchy can 
be seen at http://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Hierarchy.
bbPress follows a similar structure, and up until now you probably haven't played 
much with the template yet still seen the forums. The reason is that bbPress not only 
follows its own template structure but also integrates into WordPress's structure.
Should you wish to change the templates in bbPress, there are five files that bbPress 
accesses; they are presented here in order of importance:
•	
forum.php: This template is used for each individual forum
•	
forums.php: This template is used for all forum pages, be it individual (if 
forum.php isn't present) or a list of forums
•	
bbpress.php: This template is used for all bbPress pages when any of the 
previous two aren't present, as well as pages such as profile pages or login 
screens
•	
page.php: This template is used for all WordPress pages generated by 
bbPress or by another plugin or created by the user
•	
index.php: This template is the default template used by WordPress posts, 
pages, categories, and any post type or taxonomy
The templates work in descending order, so if forum.php isn't present, each 
individual forum will revert to forums.php; if that isn't present, the template file 
used for individual forums will be bbpress.php; and so on.

Adding bbPress to Your WordPress Theme
[ 80 ]
Should your theme not have any of these files (most won't), you need to create them. 
In FTP, visit your theme's folder (located at /wp-content/themes/[theme-name]/) 
and find a file called page.php. Almost all themes have this file; if not, use index.
php. Copy this file and save it as either forum.php, forums.php, or bbpress.php in 
the same location as page.php. WordPress will then recognize these files as being 
bbPress files, and use these rather than WordPress files to display the forum.
Editing individual elements of bbPress
Apart from editing the templates, you can also edit individual elements of the forum. 
These elements help display the forum and various elements are used on every page 
in bbPress. These adhere to a different template hierarchy to WordPress, in that if 
any of the files are not present, the file located at /wp-content/plugins/bbPress/
templates/default/ is used.
Adding individual elements of bbPress to 
your theme
Should you wish to edit any of these files, the best and most secure way is by adding 
these files to your theme. To do this, log in to your FTP folder and navigate to your 
folder at /wp-content/plugins/bbPress/templates/default/ on the remote 
view, and also to the root of your template in the local view.

Chapter 5
[ 81 ]
Copy the entire contents of the template folder to the root of your template folder, 
leaving the files in bbpress/templates/default intact.
bbPress will now use the files within your template to render the individual elements 
of these items. Should they not be present, the corresponding file located in the 
default folder of bbPress is used.

Individual bbPress elements and  
their functions
The bbPress template files, now residing in your theme's folder (as stated before), all 
do a different task. The following list of templates will help you locate the template 
you wish to edit to change the look of your site.

Miscellaneous templates: These templates don't fit into any of the  
previous categories.
Filename
Function
bbpress-functions.php
This template loads functions purely designed to 
run with bbPress. You shouldn't delete anything 
in this file, as it handles the default structure; so 
if any file is missing, this file tells bbPress what to 
look for and how to display the new file.
However, if you are careful, you can add functions 
at the bottom of this file, which will only be loaded 
when a bbPress page is displayed. This is handy if 
you have a large website and want to increase the 
loading speed.
As you can see, there are a lot of templates used to display bbPress data. Many of 
them are intertwined, but how can we use these to make changes? I'm going to talk 
you through two simple examples on how to edit the forums templates to display 
more information.
Adding the Recent Topics section beneath the 
home page
In bbPress Version 1.x, the home page of the forums had, at the bottom, a list of 
recent topics. This was removed in bbPress Version 2.x, but you can mimic this 
functionality if you want to.
To do so, open up the /bbpress/content-archive-forum.php file located in your 
theme and locate the following lines:
<?php if ( bbp_has_forums() ) : ?>
<?php bbp_get_template_part( 'loop',     'forums'    ); ?>
<?php else : ?>
Change these lines to the following:
<?php if ( bbp_has_forums() ) : ?>
<?php bbp_get_template_part( 'loop',     'forums'    ); ?>
<?php if ( bbp_has_topics() ) { ?>
    <h2><?php _e('Recent Topics','bbpress'); ?></h2>
    <?php bbp_get_template_part( 'bbpress/content', 'archive-topic' ); 
?>
<?php } ?>
<?php else : ?>

Chapter 5
[ 87 ]
Save and upload the file to your server.
What this code does is it first checks if there are any topics located in the forum 
with the if ( bbp_has_topics() ) call. If so, it displays the bbpress/content-
archive-topic.php template part, which is designed to display an archive of the 
topics (the bbp_get_template_part( 'bbpress/content', 'archive-topic' ); 
line). The section will have a header Recent Topics, wrapped in an <h2> HTML tag 
(the <h2><?php _e('Recent Topics','bbpress'); ?></h2> line).
If you have been using HTML for any length of time, you may have 
wondered why <h2>Recent Topics</h2> wasn't used. By using 
WordPress _e function to display text, you are telling WordPress that 
it is a display string. This will allow ease of translation should you 
ever wish to change the language of your site or deploy the template 
on a site in another language.
Open up your bbPress forum; you should see a list of recent topics beneath the 
forum list:

Adding bbPress to Your WordPress Theme
[ 88 ]
Adding a Return To The Forum link on a 
user's profile page
One small usability issue I've noticed when designing bbPress templates in the past 
has been the user's profile page: there is rarely an easy way back to your forum from 
the user's page. I like to add a Return To The Forum link at the bottom of the user's 
page so that users can return to the forum's home page after viewing a user's details.
To achieve this, open up the bbpress/user-details.php file within your theme. 
Towards the end, you should see the following lines of code:
</ul>
</div><!-- #bbp-user-navigation -->
</div><!-- #bbp-single-user-details -->
<?php do_action( 'bbp_template_after_user_details' ); ?>
Immediately above the </ul> tag, add the following lines of highlighted code. The 
end of the file looks something similar to this:
    <li>
      <span class="bbp-user-edit-link">
      <a href=" <?php echo home_url('/forums/'); ?> " title="<?php 
_e( 'Return To The Forum', 'bbpress' ); ?>"><?php _e( 'Return To The 
Forum', 'bbpress' ); ?></a>
      </span>
    </li>
  </ul>
</div><!-- #bbp-user-navigation -->
</div><!-- #bbp-single-user-details -->
<?php do_action( 'bbp_template_after_user_details' ); ?>
This code adds a list item to the unordered list. The item is styled using a <span> 
element of the bbp-user-edit-link class. The link element uses the WordPress 
function home_url to get the URL of the home page of your website. As we want 
the forum home URL, we add a variable of /forums/ so that the URL for the link is 
http://www.mybbpressdomain.com/forums/. The link has an anchor text and the 
title Return To The Forum.
Please note that this code will only work if you haven't changed 
the URL slug of the forums home page. If you have, replace /
forums/ in home_url with whatever your URL slug is.

Chapter 5
[ 89 ]
Save and upload and head to a profile page. You should see a Return To The Forum 
link at the bottom of a profile, such as the one in the following screenshot:
Integrating bbPress functionality into 
WordPress with shortcodes
bbPress, like many other plugins, adds shortcodes to WordPress. Shortcodes are 
small one- or two-word phrases or codes that tell WordPress to replace the code with 
some other functionality. It is very similar in structure to BBCode; so, for example, 
the BBCode for bold text is [b]Bold[/b].
You can give any function a shortcode, and it is useful for displaying rich data within 
posts or pages without having the security risk of placing code within posts or 
pages. bbPress allows you to create your own pages or posts within WordPress with 
bbPress functionality; so, for example, you can include forum replies within posts 
about threads. You can also use shortcodes to create more user friendly forms.

Chapter 5
[ 91 ]
Again, if you have used WordPress for any length of time, you should be  
familiar with shortcodes; but if you have not, we'll go through a tutorial to help  
you create more user friendly registration forms and integrate them with your 
bbPress template.
Creating more user friendly login forms with 
shortcodes
Earlier in this chapter, we created a widget that allowed the user to log in from the 
sidebar. We added two URLs for the Register and Lost Password? pages. While 
those pages were perfectly adequate, to aid user friendliness, we can style the Lost 
Password? and Register pages in a similar way to the rest of the site. This does 
require the creation of a few pages though.
From the Dashboard page in WordPress Administration, click on the Add New 
submenu item located under the Pages menu item. Entitle the page Login and 
then in the main content box, simply put [bbp-login] and publish the page. Log 
out of WordPress and visit the page in question. You should see a page that looks 
something similar to this:

Adding bbPress to Your WordPress Theme
[ 92 ]
Log in again and create a page called Register, with [bbp-register] in the page 
content, and a page called Lost Password?, with [bbp-lost-pass] in the page 
content. Publish both these pages and make sure they work. You should see similar 
pages to the one in the preceding screenshot, with slightly different forms.
Note down the URLs of both the pages and return to the widget screen. Find any 
login widget and replace the default WordPress Lost Password URI with the URL to 
the Lost Password? page and the default WordPress Register URI with the URL to 
the Register we recently created.
Now return to your forum and log out. Find your (bbPress) Login Widget and 
click on either the Register URI or Lost Password URI link rather than seeing the 
WordPress-branded pages for either; you should see your blog's pages with the 
forms embedded in it.
For ease, we have created very simple pages. You can go back and 
add content to any of the pages discussed previously. I recommend 
adding either a link, or displaying the forum's ground rules or 
terms and conditions on the Register page.

Chapter 5
[ 93 ]
Adding your forum to navigation areas 
using custom menus
If you are new to WordPress, or developing a site as you read this book, you may 
have noticed towards the conclusion of the previous chapter that as you created each 
individual page, it was added to the navigation menu.
This is because WordPress, by default, creates a navigation menu with the names of 
all pages. As sites grow, this area can become very cluttered and you may not want 
all pages to be displayed.
Luckily, you can easily prevent this by using custom menus.
Custom menus are a WordPress feature that allow users to easily create menus 
without knowing anything about coding. While not strictly a bbPress function, it can 
be useful for forum owners to know how to create and manage one.
Creating a custom menu and adding links to 
your bbPress forums
To begin adding your custom menu, from the WordPress Administration 
Dashboard, click on Menus, which is a submenu item underneath the Appearance 
menu item. You should be greeted with a screen similar to the following:

Adding bbPress to Your WordPress Theme
[ 94 ]
Click on the Menu Name box to give your menu a name and then click on Create 
Menu to create a new menu.
Unfortunately, bbPress doesn't have the easiest method of adding menu items, like 
you can add WordPress pages or categories, so they need to be added to the Custom 
Links window. Get the URL of any forum you want to add to the menu and add it 
to the URL field in the Custom Links box. The Label field is the link you click on to 
access that menu, so give it a descriptive name. Click on Add To Menu to add it to 
the menu.
A box with your label name should appear on the right-hand side of the screen. You 
can then drag it to reposition it in the menu, or drag left-to-right to reposition it as a 
submenu of another menu.
After creating and reordering a number of menu items, you should have a menu that 
looks like the following screenshot:

Chapter 5
[ 95 ]
Click on Save Menu to save the menu.
Towards the left-hand side of the screen, there should be a drop-down box entitled 
Theme Locations. These are usually (one or more) sections in a theme, where you 
can select which menu is displayed.
Select in the drop-down menu, which menu you wish to display and click on Save; 
then return to your site's home page. You should see the menu you have just created 
prominently on the page.
Adding an area for custom menus in 
WordPress
Most themes do have an area already built in that displays custom menus.  
However, if you have a WordPress site that isn't coded to high standards, or you 
have an old theme, you may see the following message when you try to add your 
menu to a theme:

Adding bbPress to Your WordPress Theme
[ 96 ]
In short, the issue here is that your theme doesn't have any areas to add menus. 
Luckily, you can easily fix this with two lines of code.
Open up your theme's functions.php file and add the following line of code at  
the bottom:
register_nav_menu( 'primary', __( 'Primary Menu', 'bbpress' ) );
This line of code tells WordPress to register a navigational menu with the name 
primary and the display name Primary Menu. Upload the changed functions.php 
file and refresh the page; you should be able to select any menu to be assigned as the 
Primary Menu of that page.
While you can assign any menu as the Primary Menu, it won't be displayed 
anywhere on your site yet.
To do this, you will need to add the following line of code somewhere on your page. 
Unfortunately, due to the nature of themes, I cannot say exactly where as every 
theme will be different, but my advice would be trial and error. A great place to start 
would be your WordPress theme's header.php file.
<?php wp_nav_menu(); ?>
The wp_nav_menu function creates a new navigation menu. If you only have one 
navigation menu, this will work. Alternatively, you may need to use some of the 
extended arrays. A full guide on using this function is available at http://codex.
wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_nav_menu.
Creating a forum-only widget sidebar
If you have visited a number of forums, you will notice that forums generally have 
a sidebar area that stays static compared to the rest of the site. With WordPress's 
templating system, it is quite straightforward to create a sidebar widget area that is 
separate from the rest of the site.
Registering the widget area
First of all, we need to register the sidebar. Open up your theme's functions.php 
file and place the following code at the bottom:
function mybbpressforum_widgets_init() {
  register_sidebar( array(
    'name' => __( 'Forum Sidebar', 'bbpress' ),
    'id' => 'sidebar-forum',
    'before_widget' => '<aside id="%1$s" class="widget %2$s">',

Chapter 5
[ 97 ]
    'after_widget' => '</aside>',
    'before_title' => '<h3 class="widget-title">',
    'after_title' => '</h3>',
  ) );
}
add_action( 'widgets_init', 'mybbpressforum_widgets_init' );
This creates a function called mybbpressforum_widgets_init(). The function then, 
using the command register_sidebar, registers a widget area. Its options are 
passed in an array() function. The following is a list of available options:
•	
name: This is the display name of the widget area (in this case, Forum 
Sidebar). This is the name that the user sees in the Widget area of the site.
•	
Id: This is the name of the WordPress sidebar. You use the ID to display 
the sidebar on the site (more of that later). In our example, we've named the 
sidebar sidebar-forum.
•	
before_widget and after_widget: Both of them define what style each 
widget is wrapped around. This helps styling as you can define the IDs and 
the class each widget has.
•	
before_title and after_title: Both of them define the code the title 
of each widget is wrapped around. In our example, we will have widgets 
wrapped with <h3 class="widget-title">Title of the Widget</h3>. 
Again, this helps in styling the widgets.
Upload your modified functions.php file to your site, and visit the Widgets page in 
the Dashboard page of WordPress Administration. You should now see the Forum 
Sidebar displayed on the right hand side of the screen.

Adding bbPress to Your WordPress Theme
[ 98 ]
While you can add widgets to the Forum Sidebar, the sidebar will not be displayed 
as you haven't created the custom sidebar template yet.
Creating a forum sidebar template
To create a custom sidebar template, make a copy of the sidebar.php file within 
your theme. The copy should be named sidebar-forum.php and saved in the same 
location as sidebar.php.
Open sidebar-forum.php and look for any mention of the dynamic_sidebar 
function. When found, change the function dynamic_sidebar to the following:
dynamic_sidebar('sidebar-forum');
The dynamic_sidebar function tells WordPress to display the sidebar with the 
sidebar name given in brackets. As we have defined our forum sidebar with the 
name sidebar-forum earlier on in this chapter, we tell WordPress to use this sidebar 
whenever sidebar-forum.php is displayed. The only issue at the moment is that the 
sidebar-forum.php file is not being used anywhere in your theme.
Adding the custom sidebar template to 
your forum template
To integrate sidebar-forum.php in your template, you need to open every template 
file that your forum uses. As defined earlier in the chapter, they are the following:
•	
forum.php
•	
forums.php
•	
bbpress.php
If you don't have any of these files, make a copy of your theme's page.php file (or if 
there isn't a page.php file, make a copy of index.php), call it forum.php, and look 
for the following line of code:
<?php get_sidebar(); ?>
This WordPress function calls any sidebar; by default, sidebar.php. However, we 
can define the sidebar called by changing the line to the following:
<?php get_sidebar('forum'); ?>

Chapter 5
[ 99 ]
This function displays the sidebar, sidebar-forum.php. By changing the name 
between the brackets, you can have any name you wish for the file (with the  
sidebar prefix).
Upload the sidebar-forum.php and forum.php files to your site and visit your 
home page before visiting your forum pages. You should see a different sidebar on 
each of these pages.
Summary
You should now have a forum integrated within your site. Now is the time  
that you can focus on the most important aspect of building a forum: building  
a community around it. This is the hardest aspect, as building a community  
around your website is not something you can learn in a book. However, by  
making connections, working hard, and thinking creatively, you can help your 
forum grow into something remarkable.
bbPress is an aid to help you grow. As you're now familiar with bbPress, you can 
manage your forum effectively, add on features with plugins to make it attractive, 
and integrate it with your site using themes. You should also be in a position where 
you can set up forums in bbPress for your colleagues and hopefully train them to 
manage the forum well.
If you get stuck, remember you're part of two larger communities now: bbPress 
and WordPress. Both communities are among the most helpful and supportive 
communities I've ever been a part of. They are forward-thinking (at the time of 
writing this book, bbPress Version 2.3 had just been released), and are helpful in 
a way that only the open source community can be. Reach out to people, show off 
your site, and make friends, because you are just beginning your journey with open 
source software. My genuine hope is that you continue it for as long as possible, as 
through it I've made a living and made friends doing so.

About Packt Publishing
Packt, pronounced 'packed', published its first book "Mastering phpMyAdmin for Effective 
MySQL Management" in April 2004 and subsequently continued to specialize in publishing 
highly focused books on specific technologies and solutions.
Our books and publications share the experiences of your fellow IT professionals in adapting 
and customizing today's systems, applications, and frameworks. Our solution based books 
give you the knowledge and power to customize the software and technologies you're using 
to get the job done. Packt books are more specific and less general than the IT books you have 
seen in the past. Our unique business model allows us to bring you more focused information, 
giving you more of what you need to know, and less of what you don't.
Packt is a modern, yet unique publishing company, which focuses on producing quality, 
cutting-edge books for communities of developers, administrators, and newbies alike. For 
more information, please visit our website: www.packtpub.com.
About Packt Open Source
In 2010, Packt launched two new brands, Packt Open Source and Packt Enterprise, in order to 
continue its focus on specialization. This book is part of the Packt Open Source brand, home 
to books published on software built around Open Source licences, and offering information 
to anybody from advanced developers to budding web designers. The Open Source brand 
also runs Packt's Open Source Royalty Scheme, by which Packt gives a royalty to each Open 
Source project about whose software a book is sold.
Writing for Packt
We welcome all inquiries from people who are interested in authoring. Book proposals 
should be sent to author@packtpub.com. If your book idea is still at an early stage and you 
would like to discuss it first before writing a formal book proposal, contact us; one of our 
commissioning editors will get in touch with you. 
We're not just looking for published authors; if you have strong technical skills but no writing 
experience, our experienced editors can help you develop a writing career, or simply get some 
additional reward for your expertise.
