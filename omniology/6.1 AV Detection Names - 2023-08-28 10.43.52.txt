Specific vs unspecific detection names
SPECIFIC
more likely true positive
most specific: identify malware family, e.g., 
WannaCry
medium specific: name characteristics of 
malware, e.g., FakeAdobe
UNSPECIFIC
more false positive prone
mostly automatically created, without 
knowledge about the malware underneath
blocklist entries
machine learning
heuristic detection technologies
10

Specific vs unspecific detection names
SPECIFIC
tend to have small Variant component
tend to have a concrete Type
do not use Agent as Family/Umbrella component
small variant: MSIL.Trojan-Spy.Cyborg.C
long variant: MSIL.Trojan-Spy.Cyborg.LDJFSB
UNSPECIFIC - KEYWORDS
@gen, Gen, GEN, Generic

Myth 1
Detection names are mappings to Antivirus signatures or 
Antivirus technologies.
They often do not identify malware at all and sometimes 
incorrectly.
DETECTION NAMES ARE A FORM 
OF MALWARE CLASSIFICATION
15

Myth 2
For most AV vendors "Trojan" is the default value for the Type 
component.
Whenever the actual malware type is unknown, "Trojan" is 
used.
"Trojan" in a detection name has no meaning.
"TROJAN" MEANS THE MALWARE 
IS A TROJAN HORSE
16

Myth 3
The CARO naming conventions were an attempt to classify 
malware but they are not applicable for today's malware 
landscape.
Today's detection names are influenced by CARO but have 
their own naming schemes.
