Preface
Excel 2016 for Advertising Statistics: A Guide to Solving Practical Problems is
intended for anyone looking to learn the basics of applying Excel’s powerful
statistical tools to their advertising courses or work activities. If understanding
statistics isn’t your strongest suit, you are not especially mathematically inclined, or
if you are wary of computers, then this is the right book for you.
Here you’ll learn how to use key statistical tests using Excel without being
overpowered by the underlying statistical theory. This book clearly and methodi-
cally shows and explains how to create and use these statistical tests to solve
practical problems in advertising.
Excel is an easily available computer program for students, instructors, and man-
agers. It is also an effective teaching and learning tool for quantitative analyses in
advertising courses. The powerful numerical computational ability and the graphical
functions available in Excel make learning statistics much easier than in years past.
However, this is the ﬁrst book to show Excel’s capabilities to more effectively teach
advertising statistics; it also focuses exclusively on this topic in an effort to render the
subject matter not only applicable and practical but also easy to comprehend and apply.
Unique features of this book:
•
This book is appropriate for use in any course in Advertising Statistics (at both
undergraduate and graduate levels) as well as for managers who want to improve
the usefulness of their Excel skills.
•
Includes 167 color screenshots so that you can be sure you are performing the
Excel steps correctly.
•
You will be told each step of the way, not only how to use Excel but also why you
are doing each step so that you can understand what you are doing, and not
merely learn how to use statistical tests by rote.
•
Includes speciﬁc objectives embedded in the text for each concept, so you can
know the purpose of the Excel steps.
•
This book is a tool that can be used either by itself or along with any good
statistics book.
vii

•
Statistical theory and formulas are explained in clear language without bogging
you down in mathematical ﬁne points.
•
You will learn both how to write statistical formulas using Excel and how to use
Excel’s drop-down menus that will create the formulas for you.
•
This book does not come with a CD of Excel ﬁles which you can upload to your
computer. Instead, you’ll be shown how to create each Excel ﬁle yourself. In a
work situation, your colleagues will not give you an Excel ﬁle; you will be
expected to create your own. This book will give you ample practice in devel-
oping this important skill.
•
Each chapter presents the steps needed to solve a practical advertising problem
using Excel. In addition, there are three practice problems at the end of each
chapter so you can test your new knowledge of statistics. The answers to these
problems appear in Appendix A.
•
A “Practice Test” is given in Appendix B to test your knowledge at the end of
the book. The answers to these practical advertising problems appear in
Appendix C.

Preface

Acknowledgments
Excel 2016 for Advertising Statistics: A Guide to Solving Practical Problems is the
result of inspiration from three important people: my two daughters and my wife.
Jennifer Quirk McLaughlin invited me to visit her M.B.A. classes several times at
the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, South Africa. These visits to a
ﬁrst-rate M.B.A. program convinced me there was a need for a book to teach
students how to solve practical problems using Excel. Meghan Quirk-Horton’s
dogged dedication to learning the many statistical techniques needed to complete
her Ph.D. dissertation illustrated the need for a statistics book that would make this
daunting task more user-friendly. And Lynne Buckley-Quirk was the number-one
cheerleader for this project from the beginning, always encouraging me and helping
me remain dedicated to completing it.
Thomas J. Quirk
I would like to acknowledge Tom Quirk, who not only as a former professor of
mine but also as a wonderful colleague has always been a fantastic mentor con-
stantly encouraging me. Furthermore, I would like to acknowledge the St. Louis
University (SLU) Ph.D. Program as well as SLU and Webster University adminis-
trators, faculty colleagues, and staff. You all are always there for me and I could not
ask for a better work family.
Eric Rhiney
Mike Penn, our Editor at Springer, caught the spirit of this idea in our ﬁrst
communication and shepherded this book through the idea stages until it reached
its ﬁnal form. His encouragement and support were vital to this book seeing the
light of day. We thank him for being such an outstanding product champion
throughout this process.

Chapter 1
Sample Size, Mean, Standard Deviation,
and Standard Error of the Mean
This chapter deals with how you can use Excel to ﬁnd the average (i.e., “mean”) of a
set of scores, the standard deviation of these scores (STDEV), and the standard error
of the mean (s.e.) of these scores. All three of these statistics are used frequently and
form the basis for additional statistical tests.
1.1
Mean
The mean is the “arithmetic average” of a set of scores. When my daughter was in
the ﬁfth grade, she came home from school with a sad face and said that she didn’t
get “averages.” The book she was using described how to ﬁnd the mean of a set of
scores, and so I said to her:
“Jennifer, you add up all the scores and divide by the number of numbers that you have.”
She gave me “that look,” and said: “Dad, this is serious!” She thought I was teasing her.
So I said:
“See these numbers in your book; add them up. What is the answer?” (She did that.)
“Now, how many numbers do you have?” (She answered that question.)
“Then, take the number you got when you added up the numbers, and divide that
number by the number of numbers that you have.”
She did that, and found the correct answer. You will use that same reasoning
now, but it will be much easier for you because Excel will do all of the steps for you.
We will call this average of the scores the “mean” which we will symbolize as:
X, and we will pronounce it as: “Xbar.”
The formula for ﬁnding the mean with your calculator looks like this:
X ¼ ΣX
n
ð1:1Þ

https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-72104-0_1
1

The symbol Σ is the Greek letter sigma, which stands for “sum.” It tells you to
add up all the scores that are indicated by the letter X, and then to divide your
answer by n (the number of numbers that you have).
Let’s give a simple example:
Suppose that you had these six scores:
6
4
5
3
2
5
To ﬁnd the mean of these scores, you add them up, and then divide by the
number of scores. So, the mean is: 25/6 ¼ 4.17.
1.2
Standard Deviation
The standard deviation tells you “how close the scores are to the mean.” If the
standard deviation is a small number, this tells you that the scores are “bunched
together” close to the mean. If the standard deviation is a large number, this tells
you that the scores are “spread out” a greater distance from the mean. The formula
for the standard deviation (which we will call STDEV) and use the letter, S, to
symbolize is:
STDEV ¼ S ¼
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
Σ

X  X
2
n  1
s
ð1:2Þ
The formula look complicated, but what it asks you to do is this:
1. Subtract the mean from each score

X  X

.
2. Then, square the resulting number to make it a positive number.
3. Then, add up these squared numbers to get a total score.
4. Then, take this total score and divide it by n – 1 (where n stands for the number
of numbers that you have).
5. The ﬁnal step is to take the square root of the number you found in step 4.
You will not be asked to compute the standard deviation using your calculator in
this book, but you could see examples of how it is computed in any basic statistics
book. Instead, we will use Excel to ﬁnd the standard deviation of a set of scores.
When we use Excel on the six numbers we gave in the description of the mean
above, you will ﬁnd that the STDEV of these numbers, S, is 1.47.

Sample Size, Mean, Standard Deviation, and Standard Error of the Mean

1.3
Standard Error of the Mean
The formula for the standard error of the mean (s.e., which we will use SX to
symbolize) is:
s:e: ¼ SX ¼ Sﬃﬃﬃn
p
ð1:3Þ
To ﬁnd s.e., all you need to do is to take the standard deviation, STDEV, and
divide it by the square root of n, where n stands for the “number of numbers” that
you have in your data set. In the example under the standard deviation description
above, the s.e. ¼ 0.60. (You can check this on your calculator.)
If you want to learn more about the mean, the standard deviation, and the
standard error of the mean, see Davis (2012), Triola (2014), and Jugenheimer
et al. (2014).
Now, let’s learn how to use Excel to ﬁnd the sample size, the mean, the standard
deviation, and the standard error or the mean using a problem from advertising:
Suppose that you work for an advertising ﬁrm that has just landed a new and
important client, and that you have been asked to prepare a spreadsheet listing the
advertising dollars spent by this client on one of this client’s products during the
past 2 years in terms of each of eight quarters. (You may remember, that in
accounting, a “quarter” is a time period of three months, such as Jan–Mar,
Apr–June, Jul–Sept, and Oct–Dec). You want to test your Excel skills for this
assignment, and you have prepared a table by hand of hypothetical data given in
Fig. 1.1. To make the computations simpler, you have decided to record the data in
thousands of dollars ($000) rounded off to whole numbers:
Note that the Advertising Dollars Spent are in thousands of dollars ($000), so
that 10 means that the ﬁrst-quarter advertising dollars spent for that product were
really $10,000.

Sample Size, Mean, Standard Deviation, and Standard
Error of the Mean
Objective: To ﬁnd the sample size (n), mean, standard deviation (STDEV), and
standard error of the mean (s.e.) for these data
Start your computer, and click on the Excel 2016 icon to open a blank Excel
spreadsheet.
Click on: Blank workbook
Enter the data in this way:
A3:

1.4.1
Using the Fill/Series/Columns Commands
Objective: To add the quarters 2–8 in a column underneath Quarter 1
Put pointer in A4
Home (top left of screen)
Important note: The “Paste” icon should be on the top of your screen on the far
left of the screen.
Important note: Notice the Excel commands at the top of your computer screen:
File ! Home ! Insert ! Page Layout ! Formulas ! etc.
If these commands ever “disappear” when you are using Excel,
you need to click on “Home” at the top of your screen to make
them reappear!

Step value: 1
Stop value: 8 (see Fig. 1.3)
OK
The quarters should be identiﬁed as 1–8, with 8 in cell A11.
Now, enter the quarterly Advertising Dollars Spent ﬁgures in cells B4: B11
using the above table.
Since your computer screen shows the information in a format that does not look
professional, you need to learn how to “widen the column width” and how to
“center the information” in a group of cells. Here is how you can do those two steps:

1.4.2
Changing the Width of a Column
Objective: To make a column width wider so that all of the information ﬁts
inside that column
If you look at your computer screen, you can see that Column B is not wide enough so
that all of the information ﬁts inside this column. To make Column B wider:
Click on the letter, B, at the top of your computer screen
Place your mouse pointer at the far right corner of B until you create a “cross sign”
on that corner
Left-click on your mouse, hold it down, and move this corner to the right until it is
“wide enough to ﬁt all of the data”
Take your ﬁnger off the mouse to set the new column width (see Fig. 1.4)
Then, click on any empty cell (i.e., any blank cell) to “deselect” column B so that
it is no longer a darker color on your screen.
When you widen a column, you will make all of the cells in all of the rows of this
column that same width.
Now, let’s go through the steps to center the information in both Column A and
Column B.

1.4.3
Centering Information in a Range of Cells
Objective: To center the information in a group of cells
In order to make the information in the cells look “more professional,” you can
center the information using the following steps:
Left-click your mouse on A3 and drag it to the right and down to highlight cells
A3: B11 so that these cells appear in a darker color
Home
At the top of your computer screen, you will see a set of “lines” in which all of
the lines are “centered” to the same width under “Alignment” (it is the second icon
at the bottom left of the Alignment box; see Fig. 1.5).

to Center Information
Within Cells

Click on this icon to center the information in the selected cells (see Fig. 1.6)
Since you will need to refer to the Advertising Dollars Spent ﬁgures in your
formulas, it will be much easier to do this if you “name the range of data” with a
name instead of having to remember the exact cells (B4: B11) in which these ﬁgures
are located. Let’s call that group of cells: Product, but we could give them any name
that you want to use.
1.4.4
Naming a Range of Cells
Objective: To name the range of data for the Advertising Dollars Spent ﬁgures
with the name: Product
Highlight cells B4: B11 by left-clicking your mouse on B4 and dragging it down
to B11

OK
Then, click on any cell of your spreadsheet that does not have any information in it
(i.e., it is an “empty cell”) to deselect cells B4:B11
Now, add the following labels to your spreadsheet:
E6:
n
E9:
Mean
E12:
STDEV
E15:

Note: Whenever you use a formula, you must add an equal sign (¼) at the beginning
of the name of the function so that Excel knows that you intend to use a
formula.
1.4.5
Finding the Sample Size Using the ¼COUNT Function
Objective: To ﬁnd the sample size (n) for these data using the ¼COUNT
function
F6:
¼COUNT(Product)
Hit the Enter key, and this command should insert the number 8 into cell F6 since
there are eight quarterly ﬁgures.
1.4.6
Finding the Mean Score Using the ¼AVERAGE
Function
Objective: To ﬁnd the mean Advertising Dollars ﬁgure using ¼AVERAGE
function

This command should insert the number 23.125 into cell F9.
1.4.7
Finding the Standard Deviation Using the ¼STDEV
Function
Objective: To ﬁnd the standard deviation (STDEV) using the ¼STDEV function
F12:
¼STDEV(Product)
This command should insert the number 14.02485 into cell F12.
1.4.8
Finding the Standard Error of the Mean
Objective: To ﬁnd the standard error of the mean using a formula for these
eight data points
F15:
¼F12/SQRT(8)
This command should insert the number 4.958533 into cell F15 (see Fig. 1.9).

Important note: Throughout this book, be sure to double-check all of the ﬁgures in
your spreadsheet to make sure that they are in the correct cells, or
the formulas will not work correctly!
1.4.8.1
Formatting Numbers in Number Format (Two Decimal Places)
Objective: To convert the mean, STDEV, and s.e. to two decimal places
Highlight cells F9:F15
Home (top left of screen)
Look under “Number” at the top center of your screen. In the bottom right corner,
gently place your mouse pointer on your screen at the bottom of the .00.0 until it
says: “Decrease Decimal” (see Fig. 1.10)
Click on this icon once and notice that the cells F9:F15 are now all in just two
decimal places (see Fig. 1.11)

Important note: The quarterly ﬁgures are in thousands of dollars ($000), so that the
mean is $23,130, the standard deviation is $14,020, and the stan-
dard error of the mean is $4,960.
Now, click on any “empty cell” on your spreadsheet to deselect cells F9:F15.
1.5
Saving a Spreadsheet
Objective: To save this spreadsheet with the name:
Product6
In order to save your spreadsheet so that you can retrieve it sometime in the future,
your ﬁrst decision is to decide “where” you want to save it. That is your decision
and you have several choices. If it is your own computer, you can save it onto your
hard drive (you need to ask someone how to do that on your computer). Or, you can
save it onto a “CD” or onto a “ﬂash drive.” You then need to complete these steps:

End-of-Chapter Practice Problems
1. Suppose that you work for an advertising ﬁrm that does research about potential
television commercials by having members of a panel view the commercials and
comment on how effective the commercials are in encouraging them to purchase
the product that is described in the ad. Note that a “panel” is a group of people
who have agreed to participate in research studies over the Web. There are
different panels for different target market segments. Suppose that you have
been asked to analyze the date for a possible TV ad for a new product based on
the survey responses of male college students (ages 18–24) in the panel. The
survey has ten items in it, but you have decided to create some hypothetical data
for just Item #10 which asks about purchase intent based on the TV ad. These
hypothetical data appear in Fig. 1.17:

Sample Size, Mean, Standard Deviation, and Standard Error of the Mean

(a) Use Excel to the right of the table to ﬁnd the sample size, mean, standard
deviation, and standard error of the mean for these data. Label your answers,
and round off the mean, standard deviation, and standard error of the mean to
two decimal places; use number format for these three ﬁgures.
(b) Print the result on a separate page.
(c) Save the ﬁle as:

2. The American Marketing Association (AMA) is a professional association for
marketing professionals with more than 30,000 members. AMA hosts an annual
Marketing and Public Policy Conference that brings together professors, mar-
keting professionals, and public policy makers from around the world. Suppose
that you have been asked to develop an online survey that can be sent to
participants who attend next year’s conference and to analyze the data resulting

from this survey. You have not yet decided on all of the items on this survey, but
you do want to include Item #10 (see Fig. 1.18). You want to test your Excel
skills to see if you can do the data analysis correctly, and you have prepared the
following hypothetical data for this item:
(a) Use Excel to create a table of these ratings, and at the right of the table use
Excel to ﬁnd the sample size, mean, standard deviation, and standard error of
the mean for these data. Label your answers, and round off the mean,
standard deviation, and standard error of the mean to two decimal places
using number format.
(b) Print the result on a separate page.
(c) Save the ﬁle as:

3. Suppose that you work for Ford Motor Company that that you have been asked
to do data analysis for a panel of female college students to determine their
importance of possible features for a new Ford Focus that is on the drawing
board. You want to test your Excel skills and so you have created a table of
hypothetical data for Item #12 in the Survey that will be administered to the
panel over the Web. These data are given in Fig. 1.19:

Random Number Generator
The University of Illinois-Urbana has a graduate program that confers a Master’s
degree (MS) in Advertising. Started in 1946, this program is the oldest advertising
program in the US, and it is consistently ranked in the top-ﬁve advertising programs
in the US. Suppose that you work for an ad agency that has just taken on this program
as a client, and that you have been asked to take a random sample of students in this
program two months before they are scheduled to graduate to obtain their ideas as to
how the University of Illinois should advertise this program to prospective students.
You want to be sure that you can select a random sample correctly using Excel, and
so you have decided to create a hypothetical situation in which you want to interview
5 of 32 hypothetical students who ﬁt this target market description to see if you can
correctly use Excel to select a random sample of graduating students.
To do that, you need to deﬁne a “sampling frame.” A sampling frame is a list of
people from which you want to select a random sample. This frame starts with the
identiﬁcation code (ID) of the number 1 that is assigned to the name of the ﬁrst
student in your list of 32 students in the program. The second student has a code
number of 2, the third a code number of 3, and so forth, until the last student has a
code number of 32.
Since your example has 32 students, your sampling frame would go from 1 to
32 with each student having a unique ID number.
We will ﬁrst create the frame numbers as follows in a new Excel worksheet:

A3:
FRAME NO.
A4:

Now, create the frame numbers in column A with the Home/Fill commands that
were explained in the ﬁrst chapter of this book (see Sect. 1.4.1) so that the frame
numbers go from 1 to 32, with the number 32 in cell A35. If you need to be
reminded about how to do that, here are the steps:
Click on cell A4 to select this cell
Home
Fill (then click on the “down arrow” next to this command and select)
Series (see Fig. 2.1)
OK
Columns
Step value: 1
Stop value: 32 (see Fig. 2.2)
OK
Then, save this ﬁle as: Random2. You should obtain the result in Fig. 2.3.

Now, create a column next to these frame numbers in this manner:
B3:
DUPLICATE FRAME NO.
B4:
1
Next, use the Home/Fill command again, so that the 32 frame numbers begin in
cell B4 and end in cell B35. Be sure to widen the columns A and B so that all of the
information in these columns ﬁts inside the column width. Then, center the infor-
mation inside both Column A and Column B on your spreadsheet. You should
obtain the information given in Fig. 2.4.

Save this ﬁle as:

You are probably wondering why you created the same information in both
Column A and Column B of your spreadsheet. This is to make sure that before you
sort the frame numbers that you have exactly 32 of them when you ﬁnish sorting
them into a random sequence of 32 numbers.
Now, let’s add a random number to each of the duplicate frame numbers as
follows:

C3:
RANDOM NO.
(then widen columns A, B, C so that their labels ﬁt inside the columns; then
center the information in A3:C35)
C4:
¼RAND()
Next, hit the Enter key to add a random number to cell C4.
Note that you need both an open parenthesis and a closed parenthesis after
¼RAND(). The RAND command “looks to the left of the cell with the RAND()
COMMAND in it” and assigns a random number to that cell.
Now, put the pointer using your mouse in cell C4 and then move the pointer to
the bottom right corner of that cell until you see a “plus sign” in that cell. Then,
click and drag the pointer down to cell C35 to add a random number to all 32 ID
frame numbers (see Fig. 2.5).

Then, click on any empty cell to deselect C4:C35 to remove the dark color

Sorting Frame Numbers into a Random Sequence
29

Important note: Because Excel randomly assigns these random numbers, your
Excel commands will produce a different sequence of random
numbers from everyone else who reads this book!
Because your objective at the beginning of this chapter was to select randomly
5 of 32 graduate students for a personal interview, you now can do that by selecting
the ﬁrst ﬁve ID numbers in DUPLICATE FRAME NO. column after the sort.
Although your ﬁrst ﬁve random numbers will be different from those we have
selected in the random sort that we did in this chapter, we would select these ﬁve
IDs of students to interview using Fig. 2.9.

Remember, your ﬁve ID numbers selected after your random sort will be
different from the ﬁve ID numbers in Fig. 2.9 because Excel assigns a different
random number each time the ¼RAND() command is given.
Before we leave this chapter, you need to learn how to print a ﬁle so that all of
the information on that ﬁle ﬁts onto a single page without “dribbling over” onto a
second or third page.

Printing an Excel File So That All of the Information
Fits Onto One Page
Objective: To print a ﬁle so that all of the information ﬁts onto one page

2.4

31

Note that the three practice problems at the end of this chapter require you to sort
random numbers when the ﬁles contain 63 car dealers, 114 counties of the state of
Missouri, and 76 key accounts, respectively. These ﬁles will be “too big” to ﬁt onto
one page when you print them unless you format these ﬁles so that they ﬁt onto a
single page when you print them.
Let’s create a situation where the ﬁle does not ﬁt onto one printed page unless
you format it ﬁrst to do that.
Go back to the ﬁle you just created, Random 4, and enter the name: Jennifer into
cell: A52.
If you printed this ﬁle now, the name, Jennifer, would be printed onto a second
page because it “dribbles over” outside of the page range for this ﬁle in its current
format.
So, you would need to change the page format so that all of the information,
including the name, Jennifer, ﬁts onto just one page when you print this ﬁle by using
the following steps:
Page Layout (top left of the computer screen)
(Notice the “Scale to Fit” section in the center of your screen; see Fig. 2.10)
Hit the down arrow to the right of 100% once to reduce the size of the page to
95%
Now, note that the name, Jennifer, is still on a second page on your screen
because her name is below the horizontal dotted line on your screen in Fig. 2.11 (the
dotted lines tell you outline dimensions of the ﬁle if you printed it now).

So, you need to repeat the “scale change steps” by hitting the down arrow on the
right once more to reduce the size of the worksheet to 90% of its normal size.
Notice that the “dotted lines” on your computer screen in Fig. 2.12 are now
below Jennifer’s name to indicate that all of the information, including her name, is
now formatted to ﬁt onto just one page when you print this ﬁle.

End-of-Chapter Practice Problems
1. Suppose that your ad agency represents 63 Honda car dealers in your state and
that you want to do a “dealer satisfaction phone survey” of 15 of these 63 car
dealers to get their ideas as to how you can advertise Hondas more effectively.
(a) Set up a spreadsheet of frame numbers for these dealers with the heading:
FRAME NUMBERS using the Home/Fill commands.
(b) Then, create a separate column to the right of these frame numbers which
duplicates these frame numbers with the title: Duplicate frame numbers
(c) Then, create a separate column to the right of these duplicate frame numbers
and use the ¼RAND() function to assign random numbers to all of the frame
numbers in the duplicate frame numbers column, and change this column
format so that three decimal places appear for each random number
(d) Sort the duplicate frame numbers and random numbers into a random order
(e) Print the result so that the spreadsheet ﬁts onto one page
(f) Circle on your printout the I.D. number of the ﬁrst 15 dealers that you would
call in your phone survey
(g) Save the ﬁle as:
RAND9
Important note: Note that everyone who does this problem will generate a
different random order of dealer ID numbers since Excel
assigns a different random number each time the RAND()
command is used. For this reason, the answer to this prob-
lem given in this Excel Guide will have a completely differ-
ent sequence of random numbers from the random sequence
that you generate. This is normal and what is to be
expected.
2. Suppose that you wanted to do a random sample of 10 of the 114 counties in the
state of Missouri as requested by a political pollster who wants to select
registered voters by county in Missouri for a phone survey of their voting
preferences in the next election so that an advertising program can be planned
for candidates that your agency represents. You know that there are 114 counties
in Missouri because you have accessed the Web site for the U.S. census
(U.S. Census Bureau 2000). For your information, the United States has a total
of 3,140 counties in its 50 states (U.S. Census Bureau 2000).
(a) Set up a spreadsheet of frame numbers for these counties with the
heading:
FRAME NO.
(b) Then, create a separate column to the right of these frame numbers which
duplicates these frame numbers with the title: Duplicate frame no.
(c) Then, create a separate column to the right of these duplicate frame numbers
entitled “Random number” and use the ¼RAND() function to assign random
numbers to all of the frame numbers in the duplicate frame numbers column.
Then, change this column format so that three decimal places appear for
each random number

Survey” of 20 of your agency’s 76 “key accounts.”

entitled “Random number” and use the ¼RAND() function to assign random
numbers to all of the frame numbers in the duplicate frame numbers column.
Then, change this column format so that three decimal places appear for
each random number

Chapter 3
Conﬁdence Interval About the Mean Using
the TINV Function and Hypothesis Testing
This chapter focuses on two ideas: (1) ﬁnding the 95% conﬁdence interval about the
mean, and (2) hypothesis testing.
Let’s talk about the conﬁdence interval ﬁrst.
3.1
Conﬁdence Interval About the Mean
In statistics, we are always interested in estimating the population mean. How do
we do that?
3.1.1
How to Estimate the Population Mean
Objective: To estimate the population mean, μ
Remember that the population mean is the average of all of the people in the target
population. For example, if we were interested in how well adults ages 25–44 liked
a new ﬂavor of Ben & Jerry’s ice cream, we could never ask this question of all of
the people in the U.S. who were in that age group. Such a research study would take
way too much time to complete and the cost of doing that study would be
prohibitive.
So, instead of testing everyone in the population, we take a sample of people in
the population and use the results of this sample to estimate the mean of the entire
population. This saves both time and money. When we use the results of a sample to
estimate the population mean, this is called “inferential statistics” because we are
inferring the population mean from the sample mean.

When we study a sample of people in advertising research, we know the size of
our sample (n), the mean of our sample

X

, and the standard deviation of our
sample (STDEV). We use these ﬁgures to estimate the population mean with a test
called the “conﬁdence interval about the mean.”
3.1.2
Estimating the Lower Limit and the Upper Limit
of the 95% Conﬁdence Interval About the Mean
The theoretical background of this test is beyond the scope of this book, and you can
learn more about this test from studying any good statistics textbook (e.g. Zikmund
et al. 2013; Levine et al. 2016), but the basic ideas are as follows.
We assume that the population mean is somewhere in an interval which has a
“lower limit” and an “upper limit” to it. We also assume in this book that we want to
be “95% conﬁdent” that the population mean is inside this interval somewhere. So,
we intend to make the following type of statement:
“We are 95% conﬁdent that the population mean in miles per gallon (mpg) for the Chevy
Impala automobile is between 26.92 miles per gallon and 29.42 miles per gallon.”
If we want to create a billboard for this car that claims that this car gets 28 miles
per gallon (mpg), we can do that because 28 is inside the 95% conﬁdence interval in
our research study in the above example. We do not know exactly what the
population mean is, only that it is somewhere between 26.92 and 29.42 mpg, and
28 is inside this interval.
But we are only 95% conﬁdent that the population mean is inside this interval,
and 5% of the time we will be wrong in assuming that the population mean is
28 mpg.
But, for our purposes in business research, we are happy to be 95% conﬁdent that
our assumption is accurate. We should also point out that 95% is an arbitrary level
of conﬁdence for our results. We could choose to be 80% conﬁdent, or 90%
conﬁdent, or even 99% conﬁdent in our results if we wanted to do that. But, in
this book, we will always assume that we want to be 95% conﬁdent of our results.
That way, you will not have to guess on how conﬁdent you want to be in any of the
problems in this book. We will always want to be 95% conﬁdent of our results in
this book.
So how do we ﬁnd the 95% conﬁdence interval about the mean for our data?
In words, we will ﬁnd this interval this way:
“Take the sample mean

X

, and add to it 1.96 times the standard error of the mean (s.e.) to
get the upper limit of the conﬁdence interval. Then, take the sample mean, and subtract
from it 1.96 times the standard error of the mean to get the lower limit of the conﬁdence
interval.”
You will remember (see Sect. 1.3) that the standard error of the mean (s.e.) is
found by dividing the standard deviation of our sample (STDEV) by the square root
of our sample size, n.
40
3
Conﬁdence Interval About the Mean Using the TINV Function and Hypothesis. . .

In mathematical terms, the formula for the 95% conﬁdence interval about the
mean is:
X  1:96 s:e:
ð3:1Þ
Note that the “ sign” stands for “plus or minus,” and this means that you ﬁrst
add 1.96 times the s.e. to the mean to get the upper limit of the conﬁdence interval,
and then subtract 1.96 times the s.e. from the mean to get the lower limit of the
conﬁdence interval. Also, the symbol 1.96 s.e. means that you multiply 1.96 times
the standard error of the mean to get this part of the formula for the conﬁdence
interval.
Note: We will explain shortly where the number 1.96 came from.
Let’s try a simple example to illustrate this formula.
3.1.3
Estimating the Conﬁdence Interval for the Chevy
Impala in Miles Per Gallon
Let’s suppose that you asked owners of the Chevy Impala to keep track of their
mileage and the number of gallons used for two tanks of gas. Let’s suppose that
49 owners did this, and that they average 27.83 miles per gallon (mpg) with a
standard deviation of 3.01 mpg. The standard error (s.e.) would be 3.01 divided by
the square root of 49 (i.e., 7) which gives a s.e. equal to 0.43.
The 95% conﬁdence interval for these data would be:
27:83  1:96 0:43
ð
Þ
The upper limit of this conﬁdence interval uses the plus sign of the  sign in the
formula. Therefore, the upper limit would be:
27:83 þ 1:96 0:43
ð
Þ ¼ 27:83 þ 0:84 ¼ 28:67 mpg
Similarly, the lower limit of this conﬁdence interval uses the minus sign of the 
sign in the formula. Therefore, the lower limit would be:
27:83  1:96 0:43
ð
Þ ¼ 27:83  0:84 ¼ 26:99 mpg
The result of our research study would, therefore, be the following:
“We are 95% conﬁdent that the population mean for the Chevy Impala is somewhere
between 26.99 mpg and 28.67 mpg.”
3.1
Conﬁdence Interval About the Mean
41

If we were planning to create a billboard that claimed that this car got 28 mpg,
we would be able to do that based on our data, since 28 is inside of this 95%
conﬁdence interval for the population mean.
You are probably asking yourself: “Where did that 1.96 in the formula come
from?”
3.1.4
Where Did the Number “1.96” Come From?
A detailed mathematical answer to that question is beyond the scope of this book,
but here is the basic idea.
We make an assumption that the data in the population are “normally distrib-
uted” in the sense that the population data would take the shape of a “normal curve”
if we could test all of the people in the population. The normal curve looks like the
outline of the Liberty Bell that sits in front of Independence Hall in Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania. The normal curve is “symmetric” in the sense that if we cut it down
the middle, and folded it over to one side, the half that we folded over would ﬁt
perfectly onto the half on the other side.
A discussion of integral calculus is beyond the scope of this book, but essentially
we want to ﬁnd the lower limit and the upper limit of the population data in the
normal curve so that 95% of the area under this curve is between these two limits. If
we have more than 40 people in our research study, the value of these limits is plus
or minus 1.96 times the standard error of the mean (s.e.) of our sample. The number
1.96 times the s.e. of our sample gives us the upper limit and the lower limit of our
conﬁdence interval. If you want to learn more about this idea, you can consult a
good statistics book (e.g. Salkind 2010).
The number 1.96 would change if we wanted to be conﬁdent of our results at a
different level from 95% as long as we have more than 40 people in our research
study.
For example:
1. If we wanted to be 80% conﬁdent of our results, this number would be 1.282.
2. If we wanted to be 90% conﬁdent of our results, this number would be 1.645.
3. If we wanted to be 99% conﬁdent of our results, this number would be 2.576.
But since we always want to be 95% conﬁdent of our results in this book, we will
always use 1.96 in this book whenever we have more than 40 people in our research
study.
By now, you are probably asking yourself: “Is this number in the conﬁdence
interval about the mean always 1.96?” The answer is: “No!”, and we will explain
why this is true now.

3.1.5
Finding the Value for t in the Conﬁdence
Interval Formula
Objective: To ﬁnd the value for t in the conﬁdence interval formula
The correct formula for the conﬁdence interval about the mean for different sample
sizes is the following:
X  t s:e:
ð3:2Þ
To use this formula, you ﬁnd the sample mean, X, and add to it the value of t
times the s.e. to get the upper limit of this 95% conﬁdence interval. Also, you take
the sample mean, X, and subtract from it the value of t times the s.e. to get the lower
limit of this 95% conﬁdence interval. And, you ﬁnd the value of t in the table given
in Appendix E of this book in the following way:
Objective: To ﬁnd the value of t in the t-table in Appendix E
Before we get into an explanation of what is meant by “the value of t,” let’s give
you practice in ﬁnding the value of t by using the t-table in Appendix E.
Keep your ﬁnger on Appendix E as we explain how you need to “read” that
table.
Since the test in this chapter is called the “conﬁdence interval about the mean
test,” you will use the ﬁrst column on the left in Appendix E to ﬁnd the critical value
of t for your research study (note that this column is headed: “ sample size n” ).
To ﬁnd the value of t, you go down this ﬁrst column until you ﬁnd the sample
size in your research study, and then you go to the right and read the value of t for
that sample size in the “critical t column” of the table (note that this column is the
column that you would use for the 95% conﬁdence interval about the mean).
For example, if you have 14 people or events in your research study, the value of
t is 2.160.
If you have 26 people or events in your research study, the value of t is 2.060.
If you have more than 40 people or events in your research study, the value of t is
always 1.96.
Note that the “critical t column” in Appendix E represents the value of t that you
need to use to obtain to be 95% conﬁdent of your results as “signiﬁcant” results.
Throughout this book, we are assuming that you want to be 95% conﬁdent in the
results of your statistical tests. Therefore, the value for t in the t-table in Appendix E
tells you which value you should use for t when you use the formula for the 95%
conﬁdence interval about the mean.
Now that you know how to ﬁnd the value of t in the formula for the conﬁdence
interval about the mean, let’s explore how you ﬁnd this conﬁdence interval using
Excel.

3.1.6
Using Excel’s TINV Function to Find the Conﬁdence
Interval About the Mean
Objective: To use the TINV function in Excel to ﬁnd the conﬁdence interval
about the mean
When you use Excel, the formulas for ﬁnding the conﬁdence interval are:
Lower limit: ¼ X  TINV 1  0:95; n  1
ð
Þ*s:e: no spaces between these symbols
ð
Þ
ð3:3Þ
Upper limit: ¼ X þ TINV 1  0:95; n  1
ð
Þ*s:e: no spaces between these symbols
ð
Þ
ð3:4Þ
Note that the “* symbol” in this formula tells Excel to use the multiplication step
in the formula, and it stands for “times” in the way we talk about multiplication.
You will recall from Chap. 1 that n stands for the sample size, and so n  1
stands for the sample size minus one.
You will also recall from Chapter 1 that the standard error of the mean, s.e.,
equals the STDEV divided by the square root of the sample size, n (see Sect. 1.3).
Let’s try a sample problem using Excel to ﬁnd the 95% conﬁdence interval about
the mean for a problem.
Suppose that General Motors wanted to claim that its Chevy Impala gets
28 miles per gallon (mpg), and that it wanted to advertise on a billboard in
St. Louis at the Vandeventer entrance to Route 44: “The new Chevy Impala gets
28 miles to the gallon.” Let’s call 28 mpg the “reference value” for this car.
Suppose that you work for Ford Motor Co. and that you want to check this claim
to see is it holds up based on some research evidence. You decide to collect some
data and to use a two-side 95% conﬁdence interval about the mean to test your
results:
3.1.7
Using Excel to Find the 95% Conﬁdence Interval
for a Car’s mpg Claim
Objective: To analyze the data using a two-side 95% conﬁdence interval about
the mean
You select a sample of new car owners for this car and they agree to keep track of
their mileage for two tanks of gas and to record the average miles per gallon they
achieve on these two tanks of gas. Your research study produces the results given in
Fig. 3.1:

Create a spreadsheet with these data and use Excel to ﬁnd the sample size (n), the
mean, the standard deviation (STDEV), and the standard error of the mean (s.e.) for
these data using the following cell references.

Enter the other mpg data in cells A7:A30
Now, highlight cells A6:A30 and format these numbers in number format (one

by making both of them twice as wide as the original width of column A. Then,
widen column C so that it is three times as wide as the original width of column A
so that your table looks more professional.

Now, you need to ﬁnd the lower limit and the upper limit of the 95% conﬁdence
interval for this study.
We will use Excel’s TINV function to do this. We will assume that you want to
be 95% conﬁdent of your results.

Note that this TINV formula uses 24 since 24 is one less than the sample size of
25 (i.e., 24 is n  1). Note that D10 is the mean, while D16 is the standard error of
the mean. The above formula gives the lower limit of the conﬁdence interval, 26.92.
F23 :

The above formula gives the upper limit of the conﬁdence interval, 29.42.
Now, use number format (two decimal places) in your Excel spreadsheet for the
mean, standard deviation, standard error of the mean, and for both the lower limit
and the upper limit of your conﬁdence interval. If you printed this spreadsheet now,
the lower limit of the conﬁdence interval (26.92) and the upper limit of the
conﬁdence interval (29.42) would “dribble over” onto a second printed page
because the information on the spreadsheet is too large to ﬁt onto one page in its
present format.
So, you need to use Excel’s “Scale to Fit” commands that we discussed in
Chap. 2 (see Sect. 2.4) to reduce the size of the spreadsheet to 95% of its current
size using the Page Layout/Scale to Fit function. Do that now, and notice that the
dotted line to the right of 26.92 and 29.42 indicates that these numbers would now
ﬁt onto one page when the spreadsheet is printed out (see Fig. 3.4)

Note that you have drawn a picture of the 95% conﬁdence interval beneath cell
B26, including the lower limit, the upper limit, the mean, and the reference value of
28 mpg given in the claim that the company wants to make about the car’s miles per
gallon performance.
Now, let’s write the conclusion to your research study on your spreadsheet:
C33:
Since the reference value of 28 is inside
C34:
the conﬁdence interval, we accept that
C35:
the Chevy Impala does get 28 mpg.
Your research study accepted the claim that the Chevy Impala did get 28 miles
per gallon. The average miles per gallon in your study was 28.17 (see Fig. 3.5).

3.2
Hypothesis Testing
One of the important activities of researchers, whether they are in business research,
marketing research, psychological research, educational research, or in any of the
social sciences is that they attempt to “check” their assumptions about the world by
testing these assumptions in the form of hypotheses.
A typical hypothesis is in the form: “If x, then y.”
Some examples would be:
1. “If we develop a Web site where customers can order directly over the Web for
our products, then our company’s annual sales dollars will increase by
8 percent.”
2. “If we increase our advertising budget by $400,000 for our product, then our
market share will go up by two points.”
3. “If we use this new method of teaching mathematics to ninth graders in algebra,
then our math achievement scores will go up by 10 percent.”
4. “If we raise the price for Product A by 5 percent, then our annual unit sales for
this product will decrease by 4 percent, but our annual dollar proﬁt for this
product will increase by 7 percent.”
A hypothesis, then, to a social science researcher is a “guess” about what we
think is true in the real world. We can test these guesses using statistical formulas to
see if our predictions come true in the real world.
So, in order to perform these statistical tests, we must ﬁrst state our hypotheses
so that we can test our results against our hypotheses to see if our hypotheses match
reality.
So, how do we generate hypotheses in business?
3.2.1
Hypotheses Always Refer to the Population of People
or Events That You Are Studying
The ﬁrst step is to understand that our hypotheses always refer to the population of
people under study.
For example, if we are interested in studying 18–24 year-olds in St. Louis as our
target market, and we select a sample of people in this age group in St. Louis,
depending on how we select our sample, we are hoping that our results of this study
are useful in generalizing our ﬁndings to all 18–24 year-olds in St. Louis, and not
just to the particular people in our sample.
The entire group of 18–24 year-olds in St. Louis would be the population that we
are interested in studying, while the particular group of people in our study are
called the sample from this population.
50
3
Conﬁdence Interval About the Mean Using the TINV Function and Hypothesis. . .

Since our sample sizes typically contain only a few people, we interested in the
results of our sample only insofar as the results of our sample can be “generalized”
to the population in which we are really interested.
That is why our hypotheses always refer to the population, and never to the
sample of people in our study.
You will recall from Chap. 1 that we used the symbol: X to refer to the mean of
the sample we use in our research study (see Sect. 1.1).
We will use the symbol: μ (the Greek letter “mu”) to refer to the population
mean.
In testing our hypotheses, we are trying to decide which one of two competing
hypotheses about the population mean we should accept given our data set.
3.2.2
The Null Hypothesis and the Research (Alternative)
Hypothesis
These two hypotheses are called the null hypothesis and the research hypothesis.
Statistics textbooks typically refer to the null hypothesis with the notation: H0.
The research hypothesis is typically referred to with the notation: H1, and it is
sometimes called the alternative hypothesis.
Let’s explain ﬁrst what is meant by the null hypothesis and the research
hypothesis:
(1) The null hypothesis is what we accept as true unless we have compelling
evidence that it is not true.
(2) The research hypothesis is what we accept as true whenever we reject the null
hypothesis as true.
This is similar to our legal system in America where we assume that a supposed
criminal is innocent until he or she is proven guilty in the eyes of a jury. Our null
hypothesis is that this defendant is innocent, while the research hypothesis is that he
or she is guilty.
In the great state of Missouri, every license plate has the state slogan: “Show
me.” This means that people in Missouri think of themselves as not gullible enough
to accept everything that someone says as true unless that person’s actions indicate
the truth of his or her claim. In other words, people in Missouri believe strongly that
a person’s actions speak much louder than that person’s words.
Since both the null hypothesis and the research hypothesis cannot both be true,
the task of hypothesis testing using statistical formulas is to decide which one you
will accept as true, and which one you will reject as true.
Sometimes in marketing research a series of rating scales is used to measure
people’s attitudes toward a company, toward one of its products, or toward their
intention-to-buy that company’s products. These rating scales are typically 5-point,
7-point, or 10-point scales, although other scale values are often used as well.
3.2

51

3.2.2.1
Determining the Null Hypothesis and the Research Hypothesis
When Rating Scales Are Used
Here is a typical example of a 7-point scale in attitude research in customer
satisfaction studies (see Fig. 3.6):
So, how do we decide what to use as the null hypothesis and the research
hypothesis whenever rating scales are used?
Objective: To decide on the null hypothesis and the research hypothesis when-
ever rating scales are used.
In order to make this determination, we will use a simple rule:
Rule: Whenever rating scales are used, we will use the “middle” of the scale as the
null hypothesis and the research hypothesis.
In the above example, since 4 is the number in the middle of the scale (i.e., three
numbers are below it, and three numbers are above it), our hypotheses become:
Null hypothesis:
μ ¼ 4
Research hypothesis:
μ 6¼ 4
In the above rating scale example, if the result of our statistical test for this one
attitude scale item indicates that our population mean is “close to 4,” we say that we
accept the null hypothesis that our new car purchase experience was neither positive
nor negative.
In the above example, if the result of our statistical test indicates that the
population mean is signiﬁcantly different from 4, we reject the null hypothesis
and accept the research hypothesis by stating either that:
“The new car purchase experience was signiﬁcantly positive” (this is true
whenever our sample mean is signiﬁcantly greater than our expected population
mean of 4).
or
“The new car purchase experience was signiﬁcantly negative” (this is accepted
as true whenever our sample mean is signiﬁcantly less than our expected population
mean of 4).
Fig. 3.6 Example of a Rating Scale Item for a New Car Purchase (Practical Example)
52
3
Conﬁdence Interval About the Mean Using the TINV Function and Hypothesis. . .

Both of these conclusions cannot be true. We accept one of the hypotheses as
“true” based on the data set in our research study, and the other one as “not true”
based on our data set.
The job of the marketing researcher, then, is to decide which of these two
hypotheses, the null hypothesis or the research hypothesis, he or she will accept
as true given the data set in the research study.
Let’s try some examples of rating scales so that you can practice ﬁguring out
what the null hypothesis and the research hypothesis are for each rating scale.
In the spaces in Fig. 3.7, write in the null hypothesis and the research hypothesis
for the rating scales:
How did you do?
Here are the answers to these three questions:
1. The null hypothesis is 3, and the research hypothesis is not equal to 3 on this
5-point scale (i.e. the “middle” of the scale is 3).
Fig. 3.7 Examples of Rating Scales for Determining the Null Hypothesis and the Research
Hypothesis
3.2
Hypothesis Testing
53

2. The null hypothesis is 4, and the research hypothesis is not equal to 4 on this
7-point scale (i.e., the “middle” of the scale is 4).
3. The null hypothesis is 5.5, and the research hypothesis is not equal to 5.5 on this
10-point scale (i.e., the “middle” of the scale is 5.5 since there are 5 numbers
below 5.5 and 5 numbers above 5.5).
As another example, Holiday Inn Express in its Stay Smart Experience Survey
uses 4-point scales where:
1 ¼ Not So Good
2 ¼ Average
3 ¼ Very Good
4 ¼ Great
On this scale, the null hypothesis is: μ ¼ 2.5 and the research hypothesis is:
μ 6¼ 2.5, because there are two numbers below 2.5, and two numbers above 2.5 on
that rating scale.
Now, let’s discuss the seven STEPS of hypothesis testing for using the conﬁ-
dence interval about the mean.
3.2.3
The Seven Steps for Hypothesis-Testing Using
the Conﬁdence Interval About the Mean
Objective: To learn the seven steps of hypothesis-testing using the conﬁdence
interval about the mean
There are seven basic steps of hypothesis-testing for this statistical test.
3.2.3.1
STEP 1: State the Null Hypothesis and the Research Hypothesis
If you are using numerical scales in your survey, you need to remember that these
hypotheses refer to the “middle” of the numerical scale. For example, if you are
using 7-point scales with 1 ¼ poor and 7 ¼ excellent, these hypotheses would refer
to the middle of these scales and would be:
Null hypothesis H0:
μ ¼ 4
Research hypothesis H1:
μ 6¼ 4
3.2.3.2
STEP 2: Select the Appropriate Statistical Test
In this chapter we are studying the conﬁdence interval about the mean, and so we
will select that test.
54
3
Conﬁdence Interval About the Mean Using the TINV Function and Hypothesis. . .

3.2.3.3
STEP 3: Calculate the Formula for the Statistical Test
You will recall (see Sect. 3.1.5) that the formula for the conﬁdence interval about
the mean is:
X  t s:e:
ð3:2Þ
We discussed the procedure for computing this formula for the conﬁdence
interval about the mean using Excel earlier in this chapter, and the steps involved
in using that formula are:
1. Use Excel’s ¼COUNT function to ﬁnd the sample size.
2. Use Excel’s ¼AVERAGE function to ﬁnd the sample mean, X.
3. Use Excel’s ¼STDEV function to ﬁnd the standard deviation, STDEV.
4. Find the standard error of the mean (s.e.) by dividing the standard deviation
(STDEV) by the square root of the sample size, n.
5. Use Excel’s TINV function to ﬁnd the lower limit of the conﬁdence interval.
6. Use Excel’s TINV function to ﬁnd the upper limit of the conﬁdence interval.
3.2.3.4
STEP 4: Draw a Picture of the Conﬁdence Interval About
the Mean, Including the Mean, the Lower Limit of the Interval,
the Upper Limit of the Interval, and the Reference Value Given
in the Null Hypothesis, H0
We will give several examples of this step later in this chapter.
3.2.3.5
STEP 5: Decide on a Decision Rule
(a) If the reference value is inside the conﬁdence interval, accept the null hypoth-
esis, H0
(b) If the reference value is outside the conﬁdence interval, reject the null hypoth-
esis, H0, and accept the research hypothesis, H1
3.2.3.6
STEP 6: State the Result of Your Statistical Test
There are two possible results when you use the conﬁdence interval about the mean,
and only one of them can be accepted as “true.” So your result would be one of the
following:
Either: Since the reference value is inside the conﬁdence interval, we accept the
null hypothesis, H0
Or: Since the reference value is outside the conﬁdence interval, we reject the
null hypothesis, H0, and accept the research hypothesis, H1
3.2
Hypothesis Testing
55

3.2.3.7
STEP 7: State the Conclusion of Your Statistical Test
in Plain English!
In practice, this is more difﬁcult than it sounds because you are trying to summarize
the result of your statistical test in simple English that is both concise and accurate
so that someone who has never had a statistics course (such as your boss, perhaps)
can understand the conclusion of your test. This is a difﬁcult task, and we will give
you lots of practice doing this last and most important step throughout this book.
Objective: To write the conclusion of the conﬁdence interval about the mean test
Let’s set some basic rules for stating the conclusion of a hypothesis test.
Rule #1: Whenever you reject H0 and accept H1, you must use the word “signiﬁ-
cantly” in the conclusion to alert the reader that this test found an
important result.
Rule #2: Create an outline in words of the “key terms” you want to include in your
conclusion so that you do not forget to include some of them.
Rule #3: Write the conclusion in plain English so that the reader can understand it
even if that reader has never taken a statistics course.
Let’s practice these rules using the Chevy Impala Excel spreadsheet that you
created earlier in this chapter, but ﬁrst we need to state the hypotheses for that car.
Since the billboard wants to claim that the Chevy Impala gets 28 miles per
gallon, the hypotheses would be:
H0 :
μ ¼ 28 mpg
H1 :
μ 6¼ 28 mpg
You will remember that the reference value of 28 mpg was inside the 95%
conﬁdence interval about the mean for your data, so we would accept H0 for the
Chevy Impala that the car does get 28 mpg.
Objective: To state the result when you accept H0
Result: Since the reference value of 28 mpg is inside the conﬁdence interval, we
accept the null hypothesis, H0
Let’s try our three rules now:
Objective: To write the conclusion when you accept H0
56
3
Conﬁdence Interval About the Mean Using the TINV Function and Hypothesis. . .

Rule #1: Since the reference value was inside the conﬁdence interval, we cannot
use the word “signiﬁcantly” in the conclusion. This is a basic rule we are
using in this chapter for every problem.
Rule #2: The key terms in the conclusion would be:
– Chevy Impala
– reference value of 28 mpg
Rule #3: The Chevy Impala did get 28 mpg.
The process of writing the conclusion when you accept H0 is relatively straight-
forward since you put into words what you said when you wrote the null hypothesis.
However, the process of stating the conclusion when you reject H0 and accept H1
is more difﬁcult, so let’s practice writing that type of conclusion with three practice
case examples:
Objective: To write the result and conclusion when you reject H0
CASE #1: Suppose that an ad in Business Week claimed that the Ford Escape
Hybrid got 34 miles per gallon. The hypotheses would be:
H0 :
μ ¼ 34 mpg
H1 :
μ 6¼ 34 mpg
Suppose that your research yields the following conﬁdence interval:
30__________31__________32__________34
lower
Mean
upper
Ref.
limit
limit
Value
Result: Since the reference value is outside the conﬁdence interval, we reject the
null hypothesis and accept the research hypothesis
The three rules for stating the conclusion would be:
Rule #1: We must include the word “signiﬁcantly” since the reference value of 34 is
outside the conﬁdence interval.
Rule #2: The key terms would be:
– Ford Escape Hybrid
– signiﬁcantly
– either “more than” or “less than”
– and probably closer to
Rule #3: The Ford Escape Hybrid got signiﬁcantly less than 34 mpg, and it was
probably closer to 31 mpg.
Note that this conclusion says that the mpg was less than 34 mpg because the
sample mean was only 31 mpg. Note, also, that when you ﬁnd a signiﬁcant result by
rejecting the null hypothesis, it is not sufﬁcient to say only: “signiﬁcantly less than
3.2
Hypothesis Testing
57

34 mpg,” because that does not tell the reader “how much less than 34 mpg” the
sample mean was from 34 mpg. To make the conclusion clear, you need to add:
“probably closer to 31 mpg” since the sample mean was only 31 mpg.
CASE #2: Suppose that you have been hired as a consultant by the St. Louis
Symphony Orchestra (SLSO) to analyze the data from an Internet
survey of attendees for a concert in Powell Symphony Hall in
St. Louis last month. You have decided to practice your data analysis
skills on Question #7 given in Fig. 3.8:
The hypotheses for this one item would be:
H0 :
μ ¼ 4
H1 :
μ 6¼ 4
Essentially, the null hypothesis equal to 4 states that if the obtained mean score
for this question is not signiﬁcantly different from 4 on the rating scale, then
attendees, overall, were neither satisﬁed nor dissatisﬁed with their SLSO concerts.
Suppose that your analysis produced the following conﬁdence interval for this
item on the survey.
1.8_________2.8_________3.8__________4
lower
Mean
upper
Ref.
limit
limit
Value
Result: Since the reference value is outside the conﬁdence interval, we reject the
null hypothesis and accept the research hypothesis.
Rule #1: You must include the word “signiﬁcantly” since the reference value is
outside the conﬁdence interval
Rule #2: The key terms would be:
– attendees
– SLSO Internet survey
– signiﬁcantly
– last month
– either satisﬁed or dissatisﬁed (since the result is signiﬁcant)
– experiences at concerts
– overall

Conﬁdence Interval About the Mean Using the TINV Function and Hypothesis. . .

Rule #3: Attendees were signiﬁcantly dissatisﬁed, overall, on last month’s Internet
survey with their experiences at concerts of the SLSO.
Note that you need to use the word “dissatisﬁed” since the sample mean of 2.8
was on the dissatisﬁed side of the middle of the rating scale.
CASE #3: Suppose that Marriott Hotel at the St. Louis Airport location had the
results of one item in its Guest Satisfaction Survey from last week’s
customers that was the following (see Fig. 3.9):
This item would have the following hypotheses:
H0 :
μ ¼ 5.5
H1 :
μ 6¼ 5.5
Suppose that your research produced the following conﬁdence interval for this
item on the survey:
5.5__________5.7_________5.8__________5.9
Ref.
lower
Mean
upper
Value
limit
limit
Result: Since the reference value is outside the conﬁdence interval, we reject the
null hypothesis and accept the research hypothesis
The three rules for stating the conclusion would be:
Rule #1: You must include the word “signiﬁcantly” since the reference value is
outside the conﬁdence interval
Rule #2: The key terms would be:
– Marriott Hotel
– St. Louis Airport
– signiﬁcantly
– check-in speed
– survey
– last week
– customers
– either “positive” or “negative” (we will explain this)
Rule #3: Customers at the St. Louis Airport Marriott Hotel last week rated their
check-in speed in a survey as signiﬁcantly positive.
Fig. 3.9 Example of a Survey Item from Marriott Hotels

59

Note two important things about this conclusion above: (1) people when
speaking English do not normally say “signiﬁcantly excellent” since something
is either excellent or is not excellent without any modiﬁer, and (2) since the mean
rating of the check-in speed (5.8) was signiﬁcantly greater than 5.5 on the
positive side of the scale, we would say “signiﬁcantly positive” to indicate
this fact.
The three practice problems at the end of this chapter will give you additional
practice in stating the conclusion of your result, and this book will include many
more examples that will help you to write a clear and accurate conclusion to your
research ﬁndings.
3.3
Alternative Ways to Summarize the Result
of a Hypothesis Test
It is important for you to understand that in this book we are summarizing an
hypothesis test in one of two ways: (1) We accept the null hypothesis, or (2) We
reject the null hypothesis and accept the research hypothesis. We are consistent in
the use of these words so that you can understand the concept underlying hypothesis
testing.
However, there are many other ways to summarize the result of an hypothesis
test, and all of them are correct theoretically, even though the terminology differs. If
you are taking a course with a professor who wants you to summarize the results of
a statistical test of hypotheses in language which is different from the language we
are using in this book, do not panic! If you understand the concept of hypothesis
testing as described in this book, you can then translate your understanding to use
the terms that your professor wants you to use to reach the same conclusion to the
hypothesis test.
Statisticians and professors of business statistics all have their own language that
they like to use to summarize the results of an hypothesis test. There is no one set of
words that these statisticians and professors will ever agree on, and so we have
chosen the one that we believe to be easier to understand in terms of the concept of
hypothesis testing.
To convince you that there are many ways to summarize the results of an
hypothesis test, we present the following quotes from prominent statistics and
research books to give you an idea of the different ways that are possible.
3.3.1
Different Ways to Accept the Null Hypothesis
The following quotes are typical of the language used in statistics and research
books when the null hypothesis is accepted:
60
3
Conﬁdence Interval About the Mean Using the TINV Function and Hypothesis. . .

“The null hypothesis is not rejected.” (Black 2010, p. 310)
“The null hypothesis cannot be rejected.” (McDaniel and Gates 2010, p. 545)
“The null hypothesis . . . claims that there is no difference between groups.” (Salkind 2010,
p. 193)
“The difference is not statistically signiﬁcant.” (McDaniel and Gates 2010, p. 545)
“ . . . the obtained value is not extreme enough for us to say that the difference between
Groups 1 and 2 occurred by anything other than chance.” (Salkind 2010, p. 225)
“If we do not reject the null hypothesis, we conclude that there is not enough statistical
evidence to infer that the alternative (hypothesis) is true.” (Keller 2009, p. 358)
“The research hypothesis is not supported.” (Zikmund and Babin 2010, p. 552)
3.3.2
Different Ways to Reject the Null Hypothesis
The following quotes are typical of the quotes used in statistics and research books
when the null hypothesis is rejected:
“The null hypothesis is rejected.” (McDaniel and Gates 2010, p. 546)
“If we reject the null hypothesis, we conclude that there is enough statistical evidence to
infer that the alternative hypothesis is true.” (Keller 2009, p. 358)
“If the test statistic’s value is inconsistent with the null hypothesis, we reject the null
hypothesis and infer that the alternative hypothesis is true.” (Keller 2009, p. 348)
“Because the observed value . . . is greater than the critical value . . ., the decision is to reject
the null hypothesis.” (Black 2010, p. 359)
“If the obtained value is more extreme than the critical value, the null hypothesis cannot be
accepted.” (Salkind 2010, p. 243)
“The critical t-value . . . must be surpassed by the observed t-value if the hypothesis test is
to be statistically signiﬁcant . . . .” (Zikmund and Babin 2010, p. 567)
“The calculated test statistic . . . exceeds the upper boundary and falls into this rejection
region. The null hypothesis is rejected.” (Weiers 2011, p. 330)
You should note that all of the above quotes are used by statisticians and
professors when discussing the results of an hypothesis test, and so you should
not be surprised if someone asks you to summarize the results of a statistical test
using a different language than the one we are using in this book.

Chapter 4
One-Group t-Test for the Mean
In this chapter, you will learn how to use one of the most popular and most helpful
statistical tests in advertising research: the one-group t-test for the mean.
The formula for the one-group t-test is as follows:
t ¼ X  μ
SX
where
ð4:1Þ
s:e: ¼ SX ¼ Sﬃﬃﬃn
p
ð4:2Þ
This formula asks you to take the mean (X) and subtract the population mean (μ)
from it, and then divide the answer by the standard error of the mean (s.e.). The
standard error of the mean equals the standard deviation divided by the square root
of n (the sample size).
Let’s discuss the seven STEPS of hypothesis testing using the one-group t-test so
that you can understand how this test is used.
4.1
The Seven STEPS for Hypothesis-Testing Using
the One-Group t-Test
Objective: To learn the seven steps of hypothesis-testing using the one-group
t-test
Before you can try out your Excel skills on the one-group t-test, you need to
learn the basic steps of hypothesis-testing for this statistical test. There are seven
steps in this process:

4.1.1
STEP 1: State the Null Hypothesis
and the Research Hypothesis
If you are using numerical scales in your survey, you need to remember that these
hypotheses refer to the “middle” of the numerical scale. For example, if you are
using 7-point scales with 1 ¼ poor and 7 ¼ excellent, these hypotheses would refer
to the middle of these scales and would be:
Null hypothesis H0 :
μ ¼ 4
Research hypothesis H1 :
μ 6¼ 4
As a second example, suppose that you worked for Honda Motor Company and
that you wanted to place a magazine ad that claimed that the new Honda Fit got
35 miles per gallon (mpg). The hypotheses for testing this claim on actual data
would be:
H0 :
μ ¼ 35 mpg
H1 :
μ 6¼ 35 mpg
4.1.2
STEP 2: Select the Appropriate Statistical Test
In this chapter we will be studying the one-group t-test, and so we will select
that test.
4.1.3
STEP 3: Decide on a Decision Rule
for the One-Group t-Test
(a) If the absolute value of t is less than the critical value of t, accept the null
hypothesis.
(b) If the absolute value of t is greater than the critical value of t, reject the null
hypothesis and accept the research hypothesis.
You are probably saying to yourself: “That sounds ﬁne, but how do I ﬁnd the
absolute value of t?”
4.1.3.1
Finding the Absolute Value of a Number
To do that, we need another objective:
Objective: To ﬁnd the absolute value of a number
68
4
One-Group t-Test for the Mean

If you took a basic algebra course in high school, you may remember the concept
of “absolute value.” In mathematical terms, the absolute value of any number is
always that number expressed as a positive number.
For example, the absolute value of 2.35 is +2.35.
And the absolute value of minus 2.35 (i.e. 2.35) is also +2.35.
This becomes important when you are using the t-table in Appendix E of this
book. We will discuss this table later when we get to Step 5 of the one-group t-test
where we explain how to ﬁnd the critical value of t using Appendix E.
4.1.4
STEP 4: Calculate the Formula for the One-Group
t-Test
Objective: To learn how to use the formula for the one-group t-test
The formula for the one-group t-test is as follows:
t ¼ X  μ
SX
where
ð4:1Þ
s:e: ¼ SX ¼ Sﬃﬃﬃn
p
ð4:2Þ
This formula makes the following assumptions about the data (Foster et al.
1998): (1) The data are independent of each other (i.e., each person receives only
one score), (2) the population of the data is normally distributed, and (3) the data
have a constant variance (note that the standard deviation is the square root of the
variance).
To use this formula, you need to follow these steps:
1. Take the sample mean in your research study and subtract the population mean μ
from it (remember that the population mean for a study involving numerical
rating scales is the “middle” number in the scale).
2. Then take your answer from the above step, and divide your answer by the
standard error of the mean for your research study (you will remember that you
learned how to ﬁnd the standard error of the mean in Chap. 1; to ﬁnd the standard
error of the mean, just take the standard deviation of your research study and
divide it by the square root of n, where n is the number of people or events used
in your research study).
3. The number you get after you complete the above step is the value for t that
results when you use the formula stated above.
4.1
The Seven STEPS for Hypothesis-Testing Using the One-Group t-Test
69

4.1.5
STEP 5: Find the Critical Value of t
in the t-Table in Appendix E
Objective: To ﬁnd the critical value of t in the t-table in Appendix E
Before we get into an explanation of what is meant by “the critical value of t,”
let’s give you practice in ﬁnding the critical value of t by using the t-table in
Appendix E.
Keep your ﬁnger on Appendix E as we explain how you need to “read” that
table.
Since the test in this chapter is called the “one-group t-test,” you will use the ﬁrst
column on the left in Appendix E to ﬁnd the critical value of t for your research
study (note that this column is headed: “sample size n”).
To ﬁnd the critical value of t, you go down this ﬁrst column until you ﬁnd the
sample size in your research study, and then you go to the right and read the critical
value of t for that sample size in the critical t column in the table (note that this is the
column that you would use for both the one-group t-test and the 95% conﬁdence
interval about the mean).
For example, if you have 27 people or events in your research study, the critical
value of t is 2.056.
If you have 38 people or events in your research study, the critical value of t is
2.026.
If you have more than 40 people or events in your research study, the critical
value of t is always 1.96.
Note that the “critical t column” in Appendix E represents the value of t that you
need to obtain to be 95% conﬁdent of your results as “signiﬁcant” results.
The critical value of t is the value that tells you whether or not you have found a
“signiﬁcant result” in your statistical test.
The t-table in Appendix E represents a series of “bell-shaped normal curves”
(they are called bell-shaped because they look like the outline of the Liberty Bell
that you can see in Philadelphia outside of Independence Hall).
The “middle” of these normal curves is treated as if it were zero point on the
x-axis (the technical explanation of this fact is beyond the scope of this book, but
any good statistics book (e.g. Zikmund and Babin 2010) will explain this concept to
you if you are interested in learning more about it).
Thus, values of t that are to the right of this zero point are positive values that use
a plus sign before them, and values of t that are to the left of this zero point are
negative values that use a minus sign before them. Thus, some values of t are
positive, and some are negative.
However, every statistics book that includes a t-table only reprints the positive
side of the t-curves because the negative side is the mirror image of the positive
side; this means that the negative side contains the exact same numbers as the
positive side, but the negative numbers all have a minus sign in front of them.
70
4
One-Group t-Test for the Mean

Therefore, to use the t-table in Appendix E, you need to take the absolute value
of the t-value you found when you use the t-test formula since the t-table in
Appendix E only has the values of t that are the positive values for t.
Throughout this book, we are assuming that you want to be 95% conﬁdent in the
results of your statistical tests. Therefore, the value for t in the t-table in Appendix E
tells you whether or not the t-value you obtained when you used the formula for the
one-group t-test is within the 95% interval of the t-curve range which that t-value
would be expected to occur with 95% conﬁdence.
If the t-value you obtained when you used the formula for the one-group t-test is
inside of the 95% conﬁdence range, we say that the result you found is not
signiﬁcant (note that this is equivalent to accepting the null hypothesis!).
If the t-value you found when you used the formula for the one-group t-test is
outside of this 95% conﬁdence range, we say that you have found a signiﬁcant
result that would be expected to occur less than 5% of the time (note that this is
equivalent to rejecting the null hypothesis and accepting the research hypothesis).
4.1.6
STEP 6: State the Result of Your Statistical Test
There are two possible results when you use the one-group t-test, and only one of
them can be accepted as “true.”
Either: Since the absolute value of t that you found in the t-test formula is less than
the critical value of t in Appendix E, you accept the null hypothesis.
Or: Since the absolute value of t that you found in the t-test formula is greater
than the critical value of t in Appendix E, you reject the null hypothesis, and
accept the research hypothesis.
4.1.7
STEP 7: State the Conclusion of Your Statistical
Test in Plain English!
In practice, this is more difﬁcult than it sounds because you are trying to summarize
the result of your statistical test in simple English that is both concise and accurate
so that someone who has never had a statistics course (such as your boss, perhaps)
can understand the result of your test. This is a difﬁcult task, and we will give you
lots of practice doing this last and most important step throughout this book.
If you have read this far, you are ready to sit down at your computer and perform
the one-group t-test using Excel on some hypothetical data from Focus Group
discussions of adult women who were asked for their opinion about a possible
new type of laundry detergent.
Let’s give this a try.
4.1
The Seven STEPS for Hypothesis-Testing Using the One-Group t-Test
71

4.2
One-Group t-Test for the Mean
Suppose that you have been hired as a statistical consultant by a large consumer
packaged-goods company to analyze the data from a survey that was given to focus
group participants at the end of a 90-minute discussion, led by a moderator, about
their likelihood of purchasing a new type of concentrated laundry detergent.
Intention-to-buy by the target market segment (also called purchase intent) is one
of the most important factors in the decision to launch a new product to the
marketplace. The focus groups consisted of adult women (ages 25–35) who
discussed a possible new laundry detergent that claimed to be “more concentrated”.
Focus groups consisted of groups of 6–10 women in each group. (For more
information about focus groups, see Davis 2012 and Jugenheimer et al. 2014.)
The survey consisted of 12 items, and Item #12 is given in Fig. 4.1:
Suppose, further, that you have decided to analyze the data from these focus
groups using the one-group t-test.
Important note: You would need to use this test for each of the survey items
separately.
Suppose that some hypothetical data for Item #12 from these focus groups were
based on a sample size of 124 adult women who had a mean score on this item of
6.58 and a standard deviation on this item of 2.44.
Objective: To analyze the data for each question separately using the one-group
t-test for each survey item.
Create an Excel spreadsheet with the following information:
B11:
Null hypothesis:
B14:
Research hypothesis:

One-Group t-Test for the Mean

Note: Remember that when you are using a rating scale item, both the null
hypothesis and the research hypothesis refer to the “middle of the scale.”
In the 10-point scale in this example, the middle of the scale is 5.5 since ﬁve
numbers are below 5.5 (i.e., 1–5) and ﬁve numbers are above 5.5 (i.e. 6–10).
Therefore, the hypotheses for this rating scale item are:
H0 :
μ ¼ 5.5

μ 6¼ 5.5

D26:

D29:
ﬁnd the critical t value of t in the t-table in Appendix E
Now, enter the following formula in cell D32 to ﬁnd the t-test result:
¼(D20  5.5)/D26
(no spaces between symbols)
This formula takes the sample mean (D20) and subtracts the population hypoth-
esized mean of 5.5 from the sample mean, and THEN divides the answer by the
standard error of the mean (D26). Note that you need to enter D20  5.5 with an
open-parenthesis before D20 and a closed-parenthesis after 5.5 so that the answer of
1.08 is THEN divided by the standard error of 0.22 to get the t-test result of 4.93.
Now, use two decimal places for both the s.e. and the t-test result (see Fig. 4.3).

One-Group t-Test for the Mean

IMPORTANT NOTE: It is important for you to understand that “technically” the
above conclusion in statistical terms should state:
“Adult women (ages 25–35) reported that they were likely to
purchase this new type of laundry detergent, and this result
was probably not obtained by chance.”
However, throughout this book, we are using the term “sig-
niﬁcantly” in writing the conclusion of statistical tests to
alert the reader that the result of the statistical test was
probably not a chance ﬁnding, but instead of writing all of
those words each time, we use the word “signiﬁcantly” as a
shorthand to the longer explanation. This makes it much
easier for the reader to understand the conclusion when it
is written “in plain English,” instead of technical, statistical
language.
4.3
Can You Use Either the 95% Conﬁdence Interval
About the Mean OR the One-Group t-Test When
Testing Hypotheses?
You are probably asking yourself:
“It sounds like you could use either the 95% conﬁdence interval about the mean
or the one-group t-test to analyze the results of the types of problems described so
far in this book? Is this a correct statement?”
The answer is a resounding: “Yes!”
Both the conﬁdence interval about the mean and the one-group t-test are used
often in advertising research on the types of problems described so far in this book.
Both of these tests produce the same result and the same conclusion from the data
set!
Both of these tests are explained in this book because some managers prefer the
conﬁdence interval about the mean test, others prefer the one-group t-test, and still
others prefer to use both tests on the same data to make their results and conclusions
clearer to the reader of their research reports. Since we do not know which of these
tests your manager prefers, we have explained both of them so that you are
competent in the use of both tests in the analysis of statistical data.
Now, let’s try your Excel skills on the one-group t-test on these three problems at
the end of this chapter.

One-Group t-Test for the Mean

Chapter 5
Two-Group t-Test of the Difference
of the Means for Independent Groups
Up until now in this book, you have been dealing with the situation in which you
have had only one group of people in your research study and only one measure-
ment “number” on each of these people. We will now change gears and deal with
the situation in which you are measuring two groups of people instead of only one
group of people.
Whenever you have two completely different groups of people (i.e., no one
person is in both groups, but every person is measured on only one variable to
produce one “number” for each person), we say that the two groups are “indepen-
dent of one another” This chapter deals with just that situation and that is why it is
called the two-group t-test for independent groups.
The assumptions underlying the two-group t-test are the following (Zikmund
and Babin 2010): (1) both groups are sampled from a normal population, and (2) the
variances of the two populations are approximately equal. Note that the standard
deviation is merely the square root of the variance. (There are different formulas to
use when each person is measured twice to create two groups of data, and this
situation is called “dependent,” but those formulas are beyond the scope of this
book.) This book only deals with two groups that are independent of one another so
that no person is in both groups of data.
When you are testing for the difference between the means for two groups, it is
important to remember that there are two different formulas that you need to use
depending on the sample sizes of the two groups:
1. Use Formula #1 in this chapter when both of the groups have more than 30 people
in them, and
2. Use Formula #2 in this chapter when either one group, or both groups, have
sample sizes less than 30 people in them.
We will illustrate both of these situations in this chapter.
But, ﬁrst, we need to understand the steps involved in hypothesis-testing when
two groups of people are involved before we dive into the formulas for this test.

5.1
The Nine STEPS for Hypothesis-Testing
Using the Two-Group t-Test
Objective: To learn the nine steps of hypothesis-testing using two groups of
people and the two-group t-test
You will see that these steps parallel the steps used in the previous chapter that dealt
with the one-group t-test, but there are some important differences between the
steps that you need to understand clearly before we dive into the formulas for the
two-group t-test.
5.1.1
STEP 1: Name One Group, Group 1, and the Other
Group, Group 2
The formulas used in this chapter will use the numbers 1 and 2 to distinguish
between the two groups. If you deﬁne which group is Group 1 and which group is
Group 2, you can use these numbers in your computations without having to write
out the names of the groups.
For example, if you are testing teenage boys on their preference for the taste of
Coke or Pepsi, you could call the groups: “Coke” and “Pepsi.” but this would
require your writing out the words “Coke” or “Pepsi” whenever you wanted to refer
to one of these groups. If you call the Coke group, Group 1, and the Pepsi group,
Group 2, this makes it much easier to refer to the groups because it saves you
writing time.
As a second example, you could be comparing the test market results for Kansas
City versus Indianapolis, but if you had to write out the names of those cities
whenever you wanted to refer to them, it would take you more time than it would if,
instead, you named one city, Group 1, and the other city, Group 2.
Note, also, that it is completely arbitrary which group you call Group 1, and
which Group you call Group 2. You will achieve the same result and the same
conclusion from the formulas however you decide to deﬁne these two groups.
5.1.2
STEP 2: Create a Table That Summarizes
the Sample Size, Mean Score, and Standard
Deviation of Each Group
This step makes it easier for you to make sure that you are using the correct numbers
in the formulas for the two-group t-test. If you get the numbers “mixed-up,” your
entire formula work will be incorrect and you will botch the problem terribly.

Two-Group t-Test of the Difference of the Means for Independent Groups

For example, suppose that you tested teenage boys on their preference for the
taste of Coke versus Pepsi in which the boys were randomly assigned to taste just
one of these brands and then rate its taste on a 100-point scale from 0 ¼ poor to
100 ¼ excellent. After the research study was completed, suppose that the Coke
group had 52 boys in it, their mean taste rating was 55 with a standard deviation of
7, while the Pepsi group had 57 boys in it and their average taste rating was 64 with
a standard deviation of 13.
The formulas for analyzing these data to determine if there was a signiﬁcant
difference in the taste rating for teenage boys for these two brands require you to
use six numbers correctly in the formulas: the sample size, the mean, and the
standard deviation of each of the two groups. All six of these numbers must be
used correctly in the formulas if you are to analyze the data correctly.
If you create a table to summarize these data, a good example of the table, using
both Steps 1 and 2, would be the data presented in Fig. 5.1:
For example, if you decide to call Group 1 the Coke group and Group 2 the Pepsi
group, the following table would place the six numbers from your research study
into the proper cells of the table as in Fig. 5.2:
You can now use the formulas for the two-group t-test with more conﬁdence that
the six numbers will be placed in the proper place in the formulas.
Note that you could just as easily call Group 1 the Pepsi group and Group 2 the
Coke group; it makes no difference how you decide to name the two groups; this
decision is up to you.

5.1.3
STEP 3: State the Null Hypothesis and the Research
Hypothesis for the Two-Group t-Test
If you have completed Step 1 above, this step is very easy because the null
hypothesis and the research hypothesis will always be stated in the same way for
the two-group t-test. The null hypothesis states that the population means of the two
groups are equal, while the research hypothesis states that the population means of
the two groups are not equal. In notation format, this becomes:
H0 :
μ1 ¼ μ2
H1 :
μ1 6¼ μ2
You can now see that this notation is much simpler than having to write out the
names of the two groups in all of your formulas.
5.1.4
STEP 4: Select the Appropriate Statistical Test
Since this chapter deals with the situation in which you have two groups of people
or events but only one measurement on each person or event in each group, we will
use the two-group t-test throughout this chapter.
5.1.5
STEP 5: Decide on a Decision Rule
for the Two-Group t-Test
The decision rule is exactly what it was in the previous chapter (see Sect. 4.1.3)
when we dealt with the one-group t-test.
(a) If the absolute value of t is less than the critical value of t, accept the null
hypothesis.
(b) If the absolute value of t is greater than the critical value of t, reject the null
hypothesis and accept the research hypothesis.
Since you learned how to ﬁnd the absolute value of t in the previous chapter (see
Sect. 4.1.3.1), you can use that knowledge in this chapter.
5.1.6
STEP 6: Calculate the Formula for the Two-Group
t-Test
Since we are using two different formulas in this chapter for the two-group t-test
depending on the sample size of the people or events in the two groups, we will
explain how to use those formulas later in this chapter.
86

Two-Group t-Test of the Difference of the Means for Independent Groups

5.1.7
STEP 7: Find the Critical Value of t
in the t-Table in Appendix E
In the previous chapter where we were dealing with the one-group t-test, you found
the critical value of t in the t-table in Appendix E by ﬁnding the sample size for the
one group of people in the ﬁrst column of the table, and then reading the critical
value of t across from it on the right in the “critical t column” in the table (see Sect.
4.1.5). This process was fairly simple once you have had some practice in doing
this step.
However, for the two-group t-test, the procedure for ﬁnding the critical value of t
is more complicated because you have two different groups of people in your study,
and they often have different sample sizes in each group.
To use Appendix E correctly in this chapter, you need to learn how to ﬁnd the
“degrees of freedom” for your study. We will discuss that process now.
5.1.7.1
Finding the Degrees of Freedom (df) for the Two-Group t-Test
Objective: To ﬁnd the degrees of freedom for the two-group t-test and to use it to
ﬁnd the critical value of t in the t-table in Appendix E
The mathematical explanation of the concept of the “degrees of freedom” is beyond
the scope of this book, but you can ﬁnd out more about this concept by reading any
good statistics book (e.g. Keller 2009). For our purposes, you can easily understand
how to ﬁnd the degrees of freedom and to use it to ﬁnd the critical value of t in
Appendix E. The formula for the degrees of freedom (df) is:
degrees of freedom ¼ df ¼ n1 þ n2  2
ð5:1Þ
In other words, you add the sample size for Group 1 to the sample size for Group
2 and then subtract 2 from this total to get the number of degrees of freedom to use
in Appendix E.
Take a look at Appendix E.
Instead of using the ﬁrst column as we did in the one-group t-test that is based on
the sample size, n, of one group of people, we need to use the second-column of this
table (df) to ﬁnd the critical value of t for the two-group t-test.
For example, if you had 13 people in Group 1 and 17 people in Group 2, the
degrees of freedom would be: 13 + 17 – 2 ¼ 28, and the critical value of t would be
2.048 since you look down the second column which contains the degrees of
freedom until you come to the number 28, and then read 2.048 in the “critical t
column” in the table to ﬁnd the critical value of t when df ¼ 28.
As a second example, if you had 52 people in Group 1 and 57 people in Group
2, the degrees of freedom would be: 52 + 57 – 2 ¼ 107. When you go down the
5.1
The Nine STEPS for Hypothesis-Testing Using the Two-Group t-Test
87

second column in Appendix E for the degrees of freedom, you ﬁnd that once you go
beyond the degrees of freedom equal to 39, the critical value of t is always 1.96, and
that is the value you would use for the critical t with this example.
5.1.8
STEP 8: State the Result of Your Statistical Test
The result follows the exact same result format that you found for the one-group
t-test in the previous chapter (see Sect. 4.1.6):
Either: Since the absolute value of t that you found in the t-test formula is less than
the critical value of t in Appendix E, you accept the null hypothesis.
Or: Since the absolute value of t that you found in the t-test formula is greater
than the critical value of t in Appendix E, you reject the null hypothesis and
accept the research hypothesis.
5.1.9
STEP 9: State the Conclusion of Your Statistical Test
in Plain English!
Writing the conclusion for the two-group t-test is more difﬁcult than writing the
conclusion for the one-group t-test because you have to decide what the difference
was between the two groups.
When you accept the null hypothesis, the conclusion is simple to write: “There is
no difference between the two groups in the variable that was measured.”
But when you reject the null hypothesis and accept the research hypothesis, you
need to be careful about writing the conclusion so that it is both accurate and
concise.
Let’s give you some practice in writing the conclusion of a two-group t-test.
5.1.9.1
Writing the Conclusion of the Two-Group t-Test When You
Accept the Null Hypothesis
Objective: To write the conclusion of the two-group t- test when you have
accepted the null hypothesis.
Suppose that you have been hired as a statistical consultant by the Director of the
University of Illinois MS in Advertising program to analyze the data from the
student evaluations of the course in “Quantitative Research Methods in Advertis-
ing” that was offered last semester.
88
5
Two-Group t-Test of the Difference of the Means for Independent Groups

The survey contained a number of items, but suppose Item #7 is the one in
Fig. 5.3:
Suppose further, that you have decided to analyze the data from last semester’s
students comparing men and women in the course using the two-group t-test.
Important note: You would need to use this test for each of the survey items
separately.
Suppose that the hypothetical data for Item #7 from last semester were based on
a sample size of 124 men who had a mean score on this item of 6.58 and a standard
deviation on this item of 2.44. Suppose that you also had data from 86 women from
last semester who had a mean score of 6.45 with a standard deviation of 1.86.
We will explain later in this chapter how to produce the results of the two-group
t-test using its formulas, but, for now, let’s “cut to the chase” and tell you that those
formulas would produce the following in Fig. 5.4:
degrees of freedom:
208
critical t:
1.96 (in Appendix E)
t-test formula:
0.44 (when you use your calculator!)
Result:
Since the absolute value of 0.44 is less than the critical t of
1.96, we accept the null hypothesis.
Conclusion:
There was no difference between male and female students
last semester in their rating of the instructor in terms of
his/her ability to apply the course material by using real-
life examples of the advertising concepts.
Now, let’s see what happens when you reject the null hypothesis (H0) and accept
the research hypothesis (H1).

Item #7 for Accepting the
Null Hypothesis

The Nine STEPS for Hypothesis-Testing Using the Two-Group t-Test
89

5.1.9.2
Writing the Conclusion of the Two-Group t-Test When You
Reject the Null Hypothesis and Accept the Research Hypothesis
Objective: To write the conclusion of the two-group t-test when you have
rejected the null hypothesis and accepted the research hypothesis
Let’s continue with this same example of the Quantitative Research Methods in
Advertising course, but with the result that we reject the null hypothesis and accept
the research hypothesis.
Let’s assume that this time you have data on 85 males from last semester and
their mean score on this question was 7.26 with a standard deviation of 2.35. Let’s
further suppose that you also have data on 48 females from last semester and their
mean score on this question was 4.37 with a standard deviation of 3.26.
Without going into the details of the formulas for the two-group t-test, these data
would produce the following result and conclusion based on Fig. 5.5:
Null Hypothesis:
μ1 ¼ μ2
Research Hypothesis:
μ1 6¼ μ2
degrees of freedom:
131
critical t:
1.96 (in Appendix E)
t-test formula:
5.40 (when you use your calculator!)
Result:
Since the absolute value of 5.40 is greater than the critical t
of 1.96, we reject the null hypothesis and accept the
research hypothesis.
Now, you need to compare the ratings of the men and women students to ﬁnd out
which group had the more positive rating of the instructor in terms of the instruc-
tor’s ability to apply the course material by using real-life examples of the adver-
tising concepts in the course using the following rule:
Rule: To summarize the conclusion of the two-group t-test, just compare the means
of the two groups, and be sure to use the word “signiﬁcantly” in your
conclusion if you rejected the null hypothesis and accepted the research
hypothesis.
A good way to prepare to write the conclusion of the two-group t-test when you
are using a rating scale is to place the mean scores of the two groups on a drawing of
the scale so that you can visualize the difference of the mean scores. For example,
Fig. 5.5 Worksheet Data
for Item #7 for Obtaining a
Signiﬁcant Difference
between Males and Females
90
5
Two-Group t-Test of the Difference of the Means for Independent Groups

for our Quantitative Research Methods in Advertising course example above, you
would draw this “picture” of the scale in Fig. 5.6:
This drawing tells you visually that males had a higher positive rating than
females on this item (7.26 vs. 4.37). And, since you rejected the null hypothesis and
accepted the research hypothesis, you know that you have found a signiﬁcant
difference between the two mean scores.
So, our conclusion needs to contain the following key words:
– Male students
– Female students
– Quantitative Research Methods in Advertising
– course
– last semester
– signiﬁcantly
– instructor
– ability to apply the course material by using real-life examples of the advertising
concepts
– higher or lower
– either (7.26 vs. 4.37) or (4.37 vs. 7.26)
We can use these key words to write the either of two conclusions which are
logically identical:
Either: Male students in the Quantitative Research Methods in Advertising course
last semester rated the instructor’s ability to apply the course material by
using real-life examples of the advertising concepts as signiﬁcantly higher
than female students (7.26 vs. 4.37).
Or: Female students in the Quantitative Research Methods in Advertising
course last semester rated the instructor’s ability to apply the course
material by using real-life examples of the advertising concepts as
signiﬁcantly lower than male students (4.37 vs. 7.26).
Both of these conclusions are accurate, so you can decide which one you want to
write. It is your choice.
Fig. 5.6 Example of Drawing a “Picture” of the Means of the Two Groups on the Rating Scale
5.1
The Nine STEPS for Hypothesis-Testing Using the Two-Group t-Test
91

Also, note that the mean scores in parentheses at the end of these conclusions
must match the sequence of the two groups in your conclusion. For example, if you
say that: “Male students rated the instructor’s ability . . . as signiﬁcantly higher than
female students,” the end of this conclusion should be: (7.26 vs. 4.37) since you
mentioned males ﬁrst, and females second.
Alternately, if you wrote that: “Female students rated the instructor’s ability . . .
as signiﬁcantly lower than male students,” the end of this conclusion should be:
(4.37 vs. 7.26) since you mentioned females ﬁrst, and males second.
Putting the two mean scores at the end of your conclusion saves the reader from
having to turn back to the table in your research report to ﬁnd these mean scores to
see how far apart the mean scores were.
Now, let’s discuss FORMULA #1 that deals with the situation in which both
groups have more than 30 people in them.
Objective: To use FORMULA #1 for the two-group t-test when both groups
have a sample size greater than 30 people
5.2
Formula #1: Both Groups Have More Than
30 People in Them
The ﬁrst formula we will discuss will be used when you have two groups of people
with more than 30 people in each group and one measurement on each person in
each group. This formula for the two-group t-test is:
t ¼ X1  X2
SX1X2
ð5:2Þ
where SX1X2 ¼
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
S12
n1
þ S22
n2
s
ð5:3Þ
and where degrees of freedom ¼ df ¼ n1 þ n2  2
ð5:1Þ
This formula looks daunting when you ﬁrst see it, but let’s explain some of the
parts of this formula:
We have explained the concept of “degrees of freedom” earlier in this chapter,
and so you should be able to ﬁnd the degrees of freedom needed for this formula in
order to ﬁnd the critical value of t in Appendix E.
In the previous chapter, the formula for the one-group t-test was the following:
t ¼ X  μ
SX
ð4:1Þ
where s:e: ¼ SX ¼ Sﬃﬃﬃn
p
ð4:2Þ
92
5
Two-Group t-Test of the Difference of the Means for Independent Groups

For the one-group t-test, you found the mean score and subtracted the population
mean from it, and then divided the result by the standard error of the mean (s.e.) to
get the result of the t-test. You then compared the t-test result to the critical value of
t to see if you either accepted the null hypothesis, or rejected the null hypothesis and
accepted the research hypothesis.
The two-group t-test requires a different formula because you have two groups
of people, each with a mean score on some variable. You are trying to determine
whether to accept the null hypothesis that the population means of the two groups
are equal (in other words, there is no difference statistically between these two
means), or whether the difference between the means of the two groups is “sufﬁ-
ciently large” that you would accept that there is a signiﬁcant difference in the
mean scores of the two groups.
The numerator of the two-group t-test asks you to ﬁnd the difference of the
means of the two groups:
X1  X2
ð5:4Þ
The next step in the formula for the two-group t-test is to divide the answer you
get when you subtract the two means by the standard error of the difference of the
two means, and this is a different standard error of the mean that you found for the
one-group t-test because there are two means in the two-group t-test.
The standard error of the mean when you have two groups of people is called the
“standard error of the difference of the means” between the two groups. This
formula looks less scary when you break it down into four steps:
1. Square the standard deviation of Group 1, and divide this result by the sample
size for Group 1 (n1).
2. Square the standard deviation of Group 2, and divide this result by the sample
size for Group 2 (n2).
3. Add the results of the above two steps to get a total score.
4. Take the square root of this total score to ﬁnd the standard error of the difference
of the means between the two groups, SX1X2 ¼
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
S12
n1 þ S22
n2
q
This last step is the one that gives students the most difﬁculty when they are
ﬁnding this standard error using their calculator, because they are in such a hurry to
get to the answer that they forget to carry the square root sign down to the last step,
and thus get a larger number than they should for the standard error.
5.2.1
An Example of Formula #1 for the Two-Group t-Test
Now, let’s use Formula #1 in a situation in which both groups have a sample size
greater than 30 people.
Suppose that you have been hired by PepsiCo to do a taste test with teenage boys
(ages 13–18) to determine if they like the taste of Pepsi the same as the taste of
Coke. The boys are not told the brand name of the soft drink that they taste.
5.2
Formula #1: Both Groups Have More Than 30 People in Them
93

You select a group of boys in this age range, and randomly assign them to one of
two groups: (1) Group 1 tastes Coke, and (2) Group 2 tastes Pepsi. Each group rates
the taste of their soft drink on a 100-point scale using the following scale in Fig. 5.7:
Suppose you collect these ratings and determine (using your new Excel skills)
that the 52 boys in the Coke group had a mean rating of 55 with a standard deviation
of 7, while the 57 boys in the Pepsi group had a mean rating of 64 with a standard
deviation of 13.
Note that the two-group t-test does not require that both groups have the same
sample size. This is another way of saying that the two-group t-test is “robust”
(a fancy term that statisticians like to use).
Your data then produce the following table in Fig. 5.8:
Create an Excel spreadsheet, and enter the following information:

Formula #2: One or Both Groups Have Less Than
30 People in Them
Suppose that your ad agency is trying to decide on which of two new Website
designs (X and Y) produces “more page views per visit”, and that you have been
asked to do an analysis of the data to see which Website design is more successful.
The research design includes randomly assigning visitors to the company’s
Website to either Design X or Design Y. Suppose, further, that you have created
some hypothetical data to test your Excel skills such that Website X had 7 visitors
with a mean score of 7.1 and a standard deviation of 4.6.
In addition, your hypothetical data states that Website Y had eight visitors with a
mean of 4.9 and a standard deviation of 3.5.
Important note: In the real world, you would never design a research study with
such a small number of visitors to each Website, but, for compu-
tational purposes, we have deliberately deﬁned two very small
sample sizes to make the computations much easier for readers
who want to check their thinking using their calculator.
You want to test to see if the two Website designs produced a signiﬁcant
difference in the average number of page views per visit.
You have decided to use the two-group t-test for independent samples, and the
following data resulted in Fig. 5.13:

You now need to compute the values of the above formulas in the following
cells:
E13:
the result of the formula needed to compute cell B13 ( use two decimals)
E16:
the result of the formula needed to compute cell B16 (use two decimals)

E22:
the result of the formula needed to compute cell B22 (use two decimals)
E25:
¼SQRT(((E13+E16)/E19) * E22) (no spaces between symbols)
Note the three open-parentheses after SQRT, and the three closed parentheses
on the right side of this formula. You need three open parentheses and three closed
parentheses in this formula or the formula will not work correctly.
The above formula gives a standard error of the difference of the means equal to
2.09 (two decimals).

enter the critical t value from the t-table in Appendix E in this cell using:
df ¼ n1 + n2 – 2 to ﬁnd the critical t value
E31:

Note that you need an open-parenthesis before D4 and a closed-parenthesis after
D5 so that this answer of 2.2 is THEN divided by the standard error of the difference
of the means of 2.09, to give a t-test value of 1.05. Use two decimal places for the
t-test result (see Fig. 5.16).

manufacturer to run several focus groups of adult males (ages 18–24)
who claimed that they played 18 holes of golf at least six times in the previous
year and to have these respondents watch one of two TV commercials (Ad A vs.
Ad B) for a new type of golf club. You plan to randomly assign the respondents
to focus groups and also to randomly assign which TV ad each group will watch
of these commercials. You are responsible for the data analysis of this research
study. The survey that will be administered to these respondents has not been
completed yet, but you are sure that Item #10 of the survey will ask the
respondents how believable the claims of the commercial were for these new
golf clubs. You plan to use a 5-point rating scale for believability where 1 ¼ very
unbelievable and 5 ¼ very believable.
You have created some hypothetical data to test your Excel statistics skills for
this one item, and you have created a Table in which 47 respondents watched TV
Ad A with a mean rating of 3.6 and a standard deviation of 1.1. You also have
included 52 respondents who watched TV Ad B with a mean rating of 4.4 and a
standard deviation of 1.2.

2. Massachusetts Mutual Financial Group (2010) placed a full-page color ad in The
Wall Street Journal in which it used a male model hugging a two-year old
daughter. The ad had the headline and sub-headline:
WHAT IS THE SIGN OF A GOOD DECISION?
It’s knowing your life insurance can help provide income for retirement.
And peace of mind until you get there.
Since the majority of the subscribers to The Wall Street Journal are men, an
interesting research question would be the following:
Research question: “Does a male model in a magazine ad affect adult men’s or
adult women’s willingness to learn more about how life
insurance can provide income for retirement?”

Chapter 6
Correlation and Simple Linear Regression
There are many different types of “correlation coefﬁcients,” but the one we will use
in this book is the Pearson product-moment correlation which we will call: r.
6.1
What Is a “Correlation?”
Basically, a correlation is a number between 1 and +1 that summarizes the
relationship between two variables, which we will call X and Y.
A correlation can be either positive or negative. A positive correlation means
that as X increases, Y increases. A negative correlation means that as X increases, Y
decreases. In statistics books, this part of the relationship is called the direction of
the relationship (i.e., it is either positive or negative).
The correlation also tells us the magnitude of the relationship between X and
Y. As the correlation approaches closer to +1, we say that the relationship is strong
and positive.
As the correlation approaches closer to 1, we say that the relationship is strong
and negative.
A zero correlation means that there is no relationship between X and Y. This
means that neither X nor Y can be used as a predictor of the other.
A good way to understand what a correlation means is to see a “picture” of the
scatterplot of points produced in a chart by the data points. Let’s suppose that you
want to know if variable X can be used to predict variable Y. We will place the
predictor variable X on the x-axis (the horizontal axis of a chart) and the criterion
variable Y on the y-axis (the vertical axis of a chart). Suppose, further, that you have
collected data given in the scatterplots below (see Figs. 6.1 through 6.6).
Figure 6.1 shows the scatterplot for a perfect positive correlation of r ¼ +1.0.
This means that you can perfectly predict each y-value from each x-value because
the data points move “upward-and-to-the-right” along a perfectly-ﬁtting straight
line (see Fig. 6.1).

Figure 6.2 shows the scatterplot for a moderately positive correlation of
r ¼ +.53. This means that each x-value can predict each y-value moderately well
because you can draw a picture of a “football” around the outside of the data points
that move upward-and-to-the-right, but not along a straight line (see Fig. 6.2).
Figure 6.3 shows the scatterplot for a low, positive correlation of r ¼ +.23. This
means that each x-value is a poor predictor of each y-value because the “picture”
you could draw around the outside of the data points approaches a circle in shape
(see Fig. 6.3).

Correlation and Simple Linear Regression

We have not shown a ﬁgure of a zero correlation because it is easy to imagine
what it looks like as a scatterplot. A zero correlation of r ¼ .00 means that there is
no relationship between X and Y and the “picture” drawn around the data points
would be a perfect circle in shape, indicating that you cannot use X to predict Y
because these two variables are not correlated with one another.
Figure 6.4 shows the scatterplot for a low, negative correlation of r ¼ .22
which means that each X is a poor predictor of Y in an inverse relationship,
meaning that as X increases, Y decreases (see Fig. 6.4). In this case, it is a negative
correlation because the “football” you could draw around the data points slopes
down and to the right.

113

Figure 6.5 shows the scatterplot for a moderate, negative correlation of r ¼ .39
which means that X is a moderately good predictor of Y, although there is an
inverse relationship between X and Y (i.e., as X increases, Y decreases; see
Fig. 6.5). In this case, it is a negative correlation because the “football” you could
draw around the data points slopes down and to the right.
Figure 6.6 shows a perfect negative correlation of r ¼ 1.0 which means that X
is a perfect predictor of Y, although in an inverse relationship such that as X
increases, Y decreases. The data points ﬁt perfectly along a downward-sloping
straight line (see Fig. 6.6).

Correlation and Simple Linear Regression

Let’s explain the formula for computing the correlation r so that you can
understand where the number summarizing the correlation came from.
In order to help you to understand where the correlation number that ranges from
─1.0 to +1.0 comes from, we will walk you through the steps involved to use the
formula as if you were using a pocket calculator. This is the one time in this book
that we will ask you to use your pocket calculator to ﬁnd a correlation, but knowing
how the correlation is computed step-by-step will give you the opportunity to
understand how the formula works in practice.
To do that, let’s create a situation in which you need to ﬁnd the correlation
between two variables.
Suppose that you have been hired by a manager of a supermarket chain to ﬁnd
the relationship between the amount of money spent weekly by the chain on
television ads and the weekly sales of the supermarket chain in St. Louis. You
collect the data from the past eight weeks given in Fig. 6.7.
For the purposes of explanation, let’s call the weekly cost of TV ads as the
predictor variable X, and the weekly sales as the criterion variable Y. Notice that
the data for the cost of TV ads for each week is in thousands of dollars ($000). For
example, the TV ads for week 6 cost $3300, and when we “move the decimal place
three places to the left to change the amount to thousands of dollars,” this becomes
3.3. Similarly, the weekly sales for week 6 were really $92,000 as those data are
also in thousands of dollars format ($000).
Notice also that we have used Excel to ﬁnd the sample size for both variables, X
and Y, and the MEAN and STDEV of both variables. (You can practice your Excel
skills by seeing if you get this same results when you create an Excel spreadsheet
for these data.)

Now, let’s use the above table to compute the correlation r between the weekly
cost of TV ads and the weekly sales of this supermarket chain using your pocket
calculator.

The nine steps are as follows:

2
Divide the number 1 by the sample size minus 1 (i.e., 1/7)
0.14286
3
For each week, take the cost of TV ads for that week and subtract the
mean cost of TV ads for the 8 weeks and call this X  X (For
example, for week 6, this would be: 3.3  3.03)
0.27
Note: With your calculator, this difference is 0.27, but when Excel uses
16 decimal places for every computation, this result will be 0.28
instead of 0.27.
4
For each week, take the weekly sales for that week and subtract the
mean weekly sales for the 8 weeks and call this Y  Y (For
example, for week 6, this would be: 92  91.50)
0.50

Then, for each week , multiply (X  X) times (Y  Y) (For example, for
week 6 this would be: 0.27  0.50)
0.135

Add the results of (X  X) times (Y  Y) for the 8 weeks

Correlation and Simple Linear Regression

Steps 1–6 would produce the Excel table given in Fig. 6.8.
Notice that when Excel multiplies a minus number by a minus number, the result
is a plus number (for example for week 2: (1.13)  (4.50) ¼ þ5.06). And when
Excel multiplies a minus number by a plus number, the result is a negative number
(for example for week 5: (0.13)  (þ 0.50) ¼ 0.06).
Note: Excel computes all computation to 16 decimal places. So, when you check
your work with a calculator, you frequently get a slightly different answer
than Excel’s answer.
For example, when you compute above:
(X  X)  (Y  Y) for Week 2, your calculator gives:
1:13
ð
Þ  4:50
ð
Þ ¼ þ5:085,
ð6:2Þ
But, as you can see from the table, Excel’s answer of 5.06 is more accurate
because Excel uses 16 decimal places for every number.
You should also note that when you do Step 6, you have to be careful to add all of
the positive numbers ﬁrst to get +12.61 and then add all of the negative numbers
second to get 1.11, so that when you subtract these two numbers you get +11.50 as
your answer to Step 6.
Step
7
Multiply the answer for step 2 above by the answer for step 6
(0.14286  11.5)
1.6429
8
Multiply the STDEV of X times the STDEV of Y (0.93  2.33)
2.1669
9
Finally, divide the answer from step 7 by the answer from step 8
(1.6429 divided by 2.1669)
+0.76
This number of 0.76 is the correlation between the weekly cost of TV ads (X) and
the weekly sales in this supermarket chain (Y) over this 8-week period. The number

+0.76 means that there is a strong, positive correlation between these two variables.
That is, as the chain increases its spending on TV ads, its sales for that week increase.
For a more detailed discussion of correlation, see Zikmund and Babin (2010).
You could also use the results of the above table in the formula for computing the
correlation r in the following way:

variables in a much simpler, and much faster, fashion than using your calculator.
6.2
Using Excel to Compute a Correlation
Between Two Variables
Objective: To use Excel to ﬁnd the correlation between two variables
Suppose that you have been hired by the owner of a supermarket chain in St. Louis
to make a recommendation as to how many shelf facings of Kellogg’s Corn Flakes
this chain should use. A “shelf facing” is the number of boxes of the cereal that are
stacked beside one another. Thus a shelf facing of 3 means that 3 boxes of Kellogg’s
Corn Flakes are stacked beside each other on the supermarket shelf in the cereals
section.
You randomly assign supermarket locations to your study, and you randomly
select the number of facings used in each supermarket location, where the number
of facings range from 1 to 3 facings. You track the weekly sales (in thousands of
dollars) of this cereal over a ten-week period, and the resulting sales ﬁgures are
given in Fig. 6.9.

Correlation and Simple Linear Regression

You want to determine if there is a relationship between the number of facings
of Kellogg’s Corn Flakes and the weekly sales of this cereal, and you decide to use a
correlation to determine this relationship. Let’s call the number of facings, X, and
the sales ﬁgures, Y.
Create an Excel spreadsheet with the following information:
A2:
Week
B2:
No. of facings
C2:
Sales ($000)
A3:
1
Next, change the width of Columns B and C so that the information ﬁts inside the
cells.
Now, complete the remaining ﬁgures in the table given above so that A12 is 10,
B12 is 3, and C12 is 4.5 (Be sure to double-check your ﬁgures to make sure that
they are correct!) Then, center the information in all of these cells.
A14:
n
A15:
mean
A16:

Next, deﬁne the “name” to the range of data from B3:B12 as: facings
We discussed earlier in this book (see Sect. 1.4.4) how to “name a range of data,”
but here is a reminder of how to do that:
To give a “name” to a range of data:
Click on the top number in the range of data and drag the mouse down to the bottom
number of the range.
For example, to give the name: “facings” to the cells: B3:B12, click on B3, and
drag the pointer down to B12 so that the cells B3:B12 are highlighted on your
computer screen. Then, click on:

Now, repeat these steps to give the name: sales to C3:C12
Finally, click on any blank cell on your spreadsheet to “deselect” cells C3:C12

Now, complete the data for these sample sizes, means, and standard deviations in
columns B and C so that B16 is 0.79, and C16 is 1.47 (use two decimals for the
means and standard deviations; see Fig. 6.11).

strong relationship between these two variables. In effect, the more facings (when
1, 2, 3 facings are used), the higher the weekly sales dollars generated for this
cereal.

Creating a Chart and Drawing the Regression Line
onto the Chart
This section deals with the concept of “linear regression.” Technically, the use of a
simple linear regression model (i.e., the word “simple” means that only one
predictor, X, is used to predict the criterion, Y) requires that the data meet the
following four assumptions if that statistical model is to be used:
1. The underlying relationship between the two variables under study (X and Y) is
linear in the sense that a straight line, and not a curved line, can ﬁt among the
data points on the chart.

Correlation and Simple Linear Regression

2. The errors of measurement are independent of each other (e.g. the errors from a
speciﬁc time period are sometimes correlated with the errors in a previous time
period).
3. The errors ﬁt a normal distribution of Y-values at each of the X-values.
4. The variance of the errors is the same for all X-values (i.e., the variability of the
Y-values is the same for both low and high values of X).
A detailed explanation of these assumptions is beyond the scope of this book, but
the interested reader can ﬁnd a detailed discussion of these assumptions in Levine
et al. (2011, pp. 529–530).
Now, let’s create a chart summarizing these data.
Important note: Whenever you draw a chart, it is ESSENTIAL that you put the
predictor variable (X) on the left, and the criterion variable
(Y) on the right in your Excel spreadsheet, so that you know
which variable is the predictor variable and which variable is the
criterion variable. If you do this, you will save yourself a lot of
grief whenever you do a problem involving correlation and
simple linear regression using Excel!
Important note: You need to understand that in any chart that has one predictor
and a criterion that there are really TWO LINES that can be
drawn between the data points:
(1) One line uses X as the predictor, and Y as the criterion
(2) A second line uses Y as the predictor, and X as the criterion
This means that you have to be very careful to note in your input
data the cells that contain X as the predictor, and Y as the
criterion. If you get these cells mixed up and reverse them, you
will create the wrong line for your data and you will have botched
the problem terribly.
This is why we STRONGLY RECOMMEND IN THIS BOOK that
you always put the X data (i.e., the predictor variable) on the
LEFT of your table, and the Y data (i.e., the criterion variable) on
the RIGHT of your table on your spreadsheet so that you don’t get
these variables mixed up.
Also note that the correlation, r, will be exactly the same correlation no matter
which variable you call the predictor variable and which variable you call the
criterion variable. The correlation coefﬁcient just summarizes the relationship
between two variables, and doesn’t care which one is the predictor and which
one is the criterion.
Let’s suppose that you would like to use the number of facings of Corn Flakes as
the predictor variable, and that you would like to use it to predict the weekly sales
dollars of this cereal. Since the correlation between these two variables is +.83, this
shows that there is a strong, positive relationship and that the number of facings is a
good predictor of the weekly sales for this cereal.

Finding the Regression Equation
The main reason for charting the relationship between X and Y (i.e., No. of facings
as X and Sales ($000) as Y in our example) is to see if there is a strong relationship
between X and Y so that the regression equation that summarizes this relationship
can be used to predict Y for a given value of X.
Since we know that the correlation between the number of facings and sales is
+.83, this tells us that it makes sense to use the number of facings to predict the
weekly sales that we can expect based on past data.

Using Excel to Find the SUMMARY OUTPUT
of Regression
You have now installed ToolPak, and you are ready to ﬁnd the regression equation
for the “best-ﬁtting straight line” through the data points by using the following
steps:
Open the Excel ﬁle: FACINGS8 (if it is not already open on your screen)
Note: If this ﬁle is already open, and there is a gray border around the chart, you
need to click on any empty cell outside of the chart to deselect the chart.
Now that you have installed Toolpak, you are ready to ﬁnd the regression
equation summarizing the relationship between the number of shelf facings of
Kellogg’s Corn Flakes and the sales dollars in your data set.
Remember that you gave the name: facings to the X data (the predictor), and the
name: sales to the Y data (the criterion) in a previous section of this chapter (see
Sect. 6.2)

OK
Input Y Range: sales
Input X Range: facings
Click on the “button” to the left of Output Range to select this, and enter A44 in the
box as the place on your spreadsheet to insert the Regression analysis in cell A44
OK
The SUMMARY OUTPUT should now be in cells: A44:
I61
Widen Column A so that all of the words in the SUMMARY OUTPUT are
readable.
Now, change the data in the following three cells to Number format (two
decimal places) by ﬁrst clicking on “Home” at the top left of your screen:
B47
B60
B61
Now, change the format for all other numbers that are in decimal format to
number format, three decimal places.
Next, widen all columns so that all of the labels ﬁt inside the column widths.
Then, center all numbers in their cells.
Print the ﬁle so that it ﬁts onto one page. (Hint: Change the scale under “Page
Layout” to 70% to make it ﬁt.) Your ﬁle should be like the ﬁle in Fig. 6.30.

Note the following problem with the summary output.
Whoever wrote the computer program for this version of Excel made a mistake
and gave the name: “Multiple R” to cell A47.
Fig. 6.30 Final Spreadsheet of Correlation and Simple Linear Regression including the SUM-
MARY OUTPUT for the Data
140
6
Correlation and Simple Linear Regression

This is not correct. Instead, cell A47 should say: “correlation r” since this is the
notation that we are using for the correlation between X and Y.
You can now use your printout of the regression analysis to ﬁnd the regression
equation that is the best-ﬁtting straight line through the data points.
But ﬁrst, let’s review some basic terms.
6.5.2.1
Finding the y-Intercept, a, of the Regression Line
The point on the y-axis that the regression line would intersect the y-axis if it were
extended to reach the y-axis is called the “y-intercept” and we will use the letter “a”
to stand for the y-intercept of the regression line. The y-intercept on the SUM-
MARY OUTPUT on the previous page is 0.65 and appears in cell B60 (note the
minus sign). This means that if you were to draw an imaginary line continuing
down the regression line toward the y-axis that this imaginary line would cross the
y-axis at 0.65. This is why a is called the “y-intercept.”
6.5.2.2
Finding the Slope, b, of the Regression Line
The “tilt” of the regression line is called the “slope” of the regression line. It
summarizes to what degree the regression line is either above or below a horizontal
line through the data points. If the correlation between X and Y were zero, the
regression line would be exactly horizontal to the X-axis and would have a zero
slope.
If the correlation between X and Y is positive, the regression line would “slope
upward to the right” above the X-axis. Since the regression line in Fig. 6.30 slopes
upward to the right, the slope of the regression line is +1.54 as given in cell B61. We
will use the notation “b” to stand for the slope of the regression line. (Note that
Excel calls the slope of the line: “X Variable 1” in the Excel printout.)
Since the correlation between the number of facings and the weekly sales dollars
was +.83, you can see that the regression line for these data “slopes upward to the
right” through the data. Note that the SUMMARY OUTPUT of the regression line
in Fig. 6.30 gives a correlation, r, of +.83 in cell B47.
If the correlation between X and Y were negative, the regression line would
“slope down to the right” above the X-axis. This would happen whenever the
correlation between X and Y is a negative correlation that is between zero and
minus one (0 and 1).
6.5
Finding the Regression Equation
141

6.5.3
Finding the Equation for the Regression Line
To ﬁnd the regression equation for the straight line that can be used to predict
weekly sales from the number of facings, we only need two numbers in the
SUMMARY OUTPUT in Fig. 6.30: B60 and B61.
The format for the regression line is :
Y ¼ a þ b X
ð6:3Þ
where a ¼ the y-intercept (0.65 in our example in cell B60)
and b ¼ the slope of the line (+1.54 in our example in cell B61)
Therefore, the equation for the best-ﬁtting regression line for our example is:
Y ¼ a þ bX
Y ¼ 0:65 þ 1:54X
Remember that Y is the weekly sales ($000) that we are trying to predict, using
the number of facings as the predictor, X.
Let’s try an example using this formula to predict the weekly sales.
6.5.4
Using the Regression Line to Predict the y-Value
for a Given x-Value
Objective: Find the weekly sales predicted from one facing of Kellogg’s Corn
Flakes on the supermarket shelf.
Since the number of facings is one (i.e., X ¼ 1), substituting this number into our
regression equation gives:
Y ¼ 0:65 þ 1:54 1
ð Þ
Y ¼ 0:65 þ 1:54
Y ¼ 0:89
Important note: If you look at your chart, if you go directly upwards from one facing
until you hit the regression line, you see that you hit this line just
under the number 1 on the y-axis to the left (actually, it is 0.89), the
result above for predicting sales from one shelf facing.
But since weekly sales are recorded in thousands of dollars ($000), we need to
multiply our answer above by 1,000 to ﬁnd the weekly sales ﬁgure.
When we do that, this gives an estimated weekly sales of $890 (0.89  1,000)
when we use one facing of this cereal.
Now, let’s do a second example and predict what the weekly sales ﬁgure would
be is we used 3 facings of Kellogg’s Corn Flakes on the supermarket shelf.
142

Correlation and Simple Linear Regression

Y ¼ 0:65 þ 1:54X
Y ¼ 0:65 þ 1:54 3
ð Þ
Y ¼ 0:65 þ 4:62
Y ¼ 3:97
Important note: If you look at your chart, if you go directly upwards from three
facings until you hit the regression line, you see that you hit this
line just under the number 4 on the y-axis to the left (actually it is
3.97), the result above for predicting sales from three shelf facings.
But since weekly sales are recorded in thousands of dollars ($000), we need to
multiply our answer above by 1,000 to ﬁnd the weekly sales ﬁgure.
When we do that, this gives an estimated weekly sales of $3,970 when we use
three facings of the cereal.
For a more detailed discussion of regression, see Black (2010) and Sharpe
et al. (2017).
6.6
Adding the Regression Equation to the Chart
Objective: To Add the Regression Equation to the Chart
If you want to include the regression equation within the chart next to the regression
line, you can do that, but a word of caution ﬁrst.
Throughout this book, we are using the regression equation for one predictor and
one criterion to be the following:
Y ¼ a þ b X
ð6:3Þ
where a ¼ y-intercept and
b ¼ slope of the line
See, for example, the regression equation in Sect. 6.5.3 where the y-intercept
was a ¼ 0.65 and the slope of the line was b ¼ +1.54 to generate the following
regression equation:
Y ¼ 0:65 þ 1:54X
However, Excel 2016 uses a slightly different regression equation (which is
logically identical to the one used in this book) when you add a regression equation
to a chart:
Y ¼ bX þ a
ð6:4Þ
where a ¼ y-intercept and b ¼ slope of the line
6.6
Adding the Regression Equation to the Chart
143

Note that this equation is identical to the one we are using in this book with the
terms arranged in a different sequence.
For the example we used in Sect. 6.5.3, Excel 2016 would write the regression
equation on the chart as:
Y ¼ 1:54X  0:65
This is the format that will result when you add the regression equation to the
chart using Excel 2016 using the following steps:
Open the ﬁle: FACINGS9 (that you saved in Sect. 6.5.2)
Click just inside the outer border of the chart in the top right corner to add the
“border” around the chart in order to “select the chart” for changes you are about to
make
Right-click on any of the data-points in the chart
Highlight: Add Trendline, and click on it to select this command
The “Linear button” near the top of the dialog box will already be selected (on its
left)
Scroll down this dialog box, and click on: Display Equation on chart (near the
bottom of the dialog box; see Fig. 6.31)

6.7
How to Recognize Negative Correlations
in the SUMMARY OUTPUT Table
Important note: Since Excel does not recognize negative correlations in the SUM-
MARY OUTPUT results, but treats all correlations as if they were
positive correlations (this was a mistake made by the program-
mer), you need to be careful to note that there may be a negative
correlation between X and Y even if the printout says that the
correlation is a positive correlation.
You will know that the correlation between X and Y is a negative
correlation when these two things occur:
(1) THE SLOPE, b, IS A NEGATIVE NUMBER. This can only
occur when there is a negative correlation.
(2) THE CHART CLEARLY SHOWS A DOWNWARD SLOPE IN
THE REGRESSION LINE, which can only occur when the
correlation between X and Y is negative.
6.8
Printing Only Part of a Spreadsheet Instead
of the Entire Spreadsheet
Objective: To print part of a spreadsheet separately instead of printing the entire
spreadsheet
There will be many occasions when your spreadsheet is so large in the number of
cells used for your data and charts that you only want to print part of the spreadsheet
separately so that the print will not be so small that you cannot read it easily.
We will now explain how to print only part of a spreadsheet onto a separate page
by using three examples of how to do that using the ﬁle, FACINGS10, that you
created in Sect. 6.6: (1) printing only the table and the chart on a separate page,
(2) printing only the chart on a separate page, and (3) printing only the SUMMARY
OUTPUT of the regression analysis on a separate page.
Note: If the ﬁle: FACINGS10 is not open on your screen, you need to open it now.
If the “border” is around the outside of the chart, click on any white space
outside of the chart to deselect the chart.
Let’s describe how to do these three goals with three separate objectives:

Objective: To print only the table and the chart on a separate page
1. Left-click your mouse starting at the top left of the table in cell A2 and drag the
mouse down and to the right so that all of the table and all of the chart are
highlighted in light blue on your computer screen from cell A2 to cell I43 (the
highlighted cells are called the “selection” cells).
2. File

The resulting printout should contain only the table of the data and the chart
resulting from the data.
Then, click on any empty cell in your spreadsheet to deselect the table and chart.
6.8.2
Printing Only the Chart on a Separate Page
Objective: To print only the chart on a separate page
1. Click on any “white space” just inside the outside border of the chart in the top
right corner of the chart to create the border around all of the borders of the chart
in order to “select” the chart.
2. File
Print
Print Selected chart
Print selected chart (again)
Print
The resulting printout should contain only the chart resulting from the data.
Important note: After each time you print a chart by itself on a separate page, you
should immediately click on any white space OUTSIDE the chart
to remove the gray border from the border of the chart. When the
gray border is on the borders of the chart, this tells Excel that you
want to print only the chart by itself. Do this now!

Printing Only Part of a Spreadsheet Instead of the Entire Spreadsheet
147

6.8.3
Printing Only the SUMMARY OUTPUT
of the Regression Analysis on a Separate Page
Objective: To print only the SUMMARY OUTPUT of the regression analysis on
a separate page
1. Left-click your mouse at the cell just above SUMMARY OUTPUT in cell A43
on the left of your spreadsheet and drag the mouse down and to the right until all
of the regression output is highlighted in dark blue on your screen from A43 to
I62. (Change the “Scale to Fit” to 75% so that the SUMMARY OUTPUT will ﬁt

End-of-Chapter Practice Problems
1. Suppose that Schnuck’s Supermarket in Webster Groves, Missouri wanted to
study the relationship between the amount of money it was spending weekly in
the Webster-Kirkwood Times newspaper ads and the weekly sales ($000) of its
store in Webster Groves. You have decided to use a correlation and simple linear
regression analysis, and to test your Excel skills, you have collected the data for
this comparison. These hypothetical data appear in Fig. 6.33:
148

Correlation and Simple Linear Regression

Create an Excel spreadsheet and enter the data using NEWSPAPER AD ($) as the
independent variable (predictor) and WEEKLY SALES ($000) as the dependent
variable (criterion).
Important note: When you are trying to ﬁnd a correlation between two variables, it
is important that you place the predictor, X, ON THE LEFT
COLUMN in your Excel spreadsheet, and the criterion, Y, IMME-
DIATELY TO THE RIGHT OF THE X COLUMN. You should do
this every time that you want to use Excel to ﬁnd a correlation
between two variables to check your thinking.
(a) Create an Excel spreadsheet using WEEKLY SALES ($000) as the criterion
and NEWSPAPER AD ($) as the predictor using the following format:
• Top title: RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN NEWSPAPER AD ($) AND
WEEKLY SALES ($000)
• x-axis title: NEWSPAPER AD ($)
• y-axis title: WEEKLY SALES ($000)
• Re-size the chart so that it is 7 columns wide and 25 rows long
(b) Create the least-squares regression line for these data on the scatterplot.
(c) Use Excel’s regression function to ﬁnd the equation for the least-squares
regression line for these data and display the results below the chart on your
spreadsheet. Add the regression line and the regression equation to the chart.
(d) Use number format (two decimal places) for the correlation, the y-intercept,
and the slope of the line on the SUMMARY OUTPUT, and use number

SUMMARY OUTPUT.
(e) Print the input data and the chart so that this information ﬁts onto one page.
(f) Then, print the regression output table so that this information ﬁts onto a

its advertising expenses in 20 states compared to the advertising expenses of its
major competitor in those states in terms of the annual sales of both companies.
The chain’s advertising expenses were compared to the advertising expenses of
its major competitor, where both the competitor’s expenses and its annual sales
dollars are scored as 100, and both the chain’s expenses and dollar sales are
scored as a percentage of the 100 of its competitor’s expenses and sales dollars.
For example, if the chain’s advertising expenses were 95 percent of the

Chapter 7
Multiple Correlation and Multiple Regression
There are many times in advertising research when you want to predict a criterion, Y,
but you want to ﬁnd out if you can develop a better prediction model by using several
predictors in combination (e.g. X1, X2, X3, etc.) instead of a single predictor, X.
The resulting statistical procedure is called “multiple correlation” because it uses
two or more predictors in combination to predict Y, instead of a single predictor,
X. Each predictor is “weighted” differently based on its separate correlation with Y
and its correlation with the other predictors. The job of multiple correlation is to
produce a regression equation that will weight each predictor differently and in such
a way that the combination of predictors does a better job of predicting Y than any
single predictor by itself. We will call the multiple correlation: Rxy.
Important note: You will remember from Chap. 6 (see Sect. 6.1) that the correla-
tion, r, ranges from 1 to +1, and, therefore, can be a negative
number.
However, the multiple correlation, Rxy, only ranges from zero to
+1 (0 to +1), and can never be negative! It is very important that
you remember this fact.
You will recall (see Sect. 6.5.3) that the regression equation that predicts Y when
only one predictor, X, is used is:
Y ¼ a þ bX
ð7:1Þ
7.1
Multiple Regression Equation
The multiple regression equation follows a similar format and is:
Y ¼ a þ b1X1 þ b2X2 þ b3X3 þ etc: depending on the
number of predictors used

The “weight” given to each predictor in the equation is represented by the letter
“b” with a subscript to correspond to the same subscript on the predictors.
Important note: In order to do multiple regression, you need to have installed
the “Data Analysis TookPak” that was described in Chap. 6
(see Sect. 6.5.1). If you did not install this, you need to do so now.
Let’s try a practice problem.
The Graduate Record Examinations (GRE) are frequently used to predict the
ﬁrst-year GPA of graduate students. The GRE is a standardized test that is an
admissions requirement for many US graduate schools. The GRE is intended to
measure general academic preparedness, regardless of specialization ﬁeld. The
GRE produces three subtest scores: (1) GRE VERBAL REASONING (scale
130–170), (2) GRE QUANTITATIVE REASONING (scale 130–170), and
(3) GRE ANALYTICAL WRITING (scale 0–6).
Suppose that you have been hired by the Director of the Master of Science in
Customer Analytics (MSCA) program at Washington University in St. Louis, MO
(US) to see if you could predict the ﬁrst-year grade-point average of students based
on their GRE QUANTITATIVE scores and their GRE WRITING scores. This
program is designed to prepare students for careers in “big data”, and the program
also has a STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics)
designation.
Let’s use the following notation:
Y
FIRST-YEAR GPA
X1
GRE QUANTITATIVE
X2
GRE WRITING
Suppose, further, that, to test your Excel skills, you have created the following
hypothetical data from the previous year’s entering class (see Fig. 7.1):
158

Create an Excel spreadsheet for these data using the following cell reference:

Next, change the column width to match the above table.
Now, ﬁll in the additional data in the chart such that:
A21:

Important note: Be sure to double-check all of your numbers in your table to be sure
that they are correct, or your spreadsheets will be incorrect.

Before we do the multiple regression analysis, we need to try to make one
important point very clear:
Important: When we used one predictor, X, to predict one criterion, Y, we said that
you need to make sure that the X variable is ON THE LEFT in your
table, and the Y variable is ON THE RIGHT in your table so that you
know which variable is the predictor, and which variable is the criterion
(see Sect. 6.3).
However, in multiple regression, you need to follow this rule which is
exactly the opposite:
When you use several predictors in multiple regression, it is essential
that the criterion you are trying to predict, Y, be ON THE FAR LEFT,
and all of the predictors are TO THE RIGHT of the criterion, Y, in your
table so that you know which variable is the criterion, Y, and which
variables are the predictors.
Notice in the table above, that the criterion Y (FIRST-YEAR GPA) is on the far
left of the table, and the two predictors (GRE QUANTITATIVE and GRE WRIT-
ING) are to the right of the criterion variable. You must follow this rule or your
regression equation will be completely wrong.

Important note: Excel automatically assigns a dollar sign $ in front of each column
letter and each row number so that you can keep these ranges of
data constant for the regression analysis.
OK (see Fig. 7.4 to see the resulting SUMMARY OUTPUT)
Next, format the following four cells in Number format (two decimal places):
B28
B41
B42
B43
Note that both the input Y Range and the Input X Range above both include the
label at the top of the columns.
Save the ﬁle as: GRE11
Now, print the ﬁle so that it ﬁts onto one page by changing the scale to 60% size.
The resulting regression analysis is given in Fig. 7.5.

Multiple Correlation and Multiple Regression

Once you have the SUMMARY OUTPUT, you can determine the multiple
correlation and the regression equation that is the best-ﬁt line through the data
points using GRE QUANTITATIVE and GRE WRITING as the two predictors,
and FIRST-YEAR GPA as the criterion.
Note on the SUMMARY OUTPUT where it says: “Multiple R.” This term is
correct since this is the term Excel uses for the multiple correlation, which is +0.88.
This means, that from these data, that the combination of GRE QUANTITATIVE
and GRE WRITING together form a very strong positive relationship in predicting
FIRST-YEAR GPA.
To ﬁnd the regression equation, notice the coefﬁcients at the bottom of the
SUMMARY OUTPUT:
Intercept: a (this is the y-intercept)
–2.69
GRE QUANTITATIVE: b1
0.03
GRE WRITING: b2

Since the general form of the multiple regression equation is:
Y ¼ a þ b1X1 þ b2X2
ð7:2Þ
we can now write the multiple regression equation for these data:
Y ¼ 2:69 þ 0:03X1 þ 0:14X2

Y ¼ 2:69 þ 4:95 þ 0:7

7.4
Using Excel to Create a Correlation Matrix in Multiple
Regression
The ﬁnal step in multiple regression is to ﬁnd the correlation between all of the
variables that appear in the regression equation.
In our example, this means that we need to ﬁnd the correlation between each of
the three pairs of variables:
(1) GRE QUANTITATIVE and FIRST-YEAR GPA
(2) GRE WRITING and FIRST-YEAR GPA
(3) GRE QUANTITATIVE and GRE WRITING
To do this, we need to use Excel to create a “correlation matrix.” This matrix
summarizes the three correlations above.
164

Multiple Correlation and Multiple Regression

Objective: To use Excel to create a correlation matrix between the three vari-
ables in this example.
To use Excel to do this, use these steps:
Data (top of screen under “Home” at the top left of screen)
Data Analysis
Correlation (scroll up to highlight this formula; see Fig. 7.6)
OK
Input range:
A6:C21
(Note that this input range includes the labels at the top of the three variables in row
6 of the spreadsheet (FIRST-YEAR GPA, GRE QUANTITATIVE, and GRE
WRITING) as well as all of the ﬁgures in the original data set.)
Grouped by: Columns
Put a check in the box for: Labels in the First Row (since you included the labels at
the top of the columns in your input range of data above)
Output range (click on the button to its left, and enter): A47 (see Fig. 7.7)

7.4
Using Excel to Create a Correlation Matrix in Multiple Regression
165

OK
The resulting correlation matrix appears in A47:D50 (see Fig. 7.8).
Next, format the three numbers in the correlation matrix that are in decimals to two
decimals places. And, also, make column C wider so that the GRE QUANTI-
TATIVE label ﬁts inside cell C47. Center all numbers in the correlation matrix.
Save this Excel ﬁle as:
GRE12
The ﬁnal spreadsheet for these data appears in Fig. 7.9.

Multiple Correlation and Multiple Regression

Print the ﬁnal spreadsheet to ﬁt onto one page by reducing the Scale to Fit to 55%.
Note that the number “1” along the diagonal of the correlation matrix means that
the correlation of each variable with itself is a perfect, positive correlation of 1.0.
Correlation coefﬁcients are always expressed in just two decimal places.
You are now ready to read the correlation between the three pairs of variables:
The correlation between GRE QUANTITATIVE and FIRST-YEAR GPA is: +.81
The correlation between GRE WRITING and FIRST-YEAR GPAs:
+.85
The correlation between GRE QUANTITATIVE and GRE WRITING is:
+.78
Fig. 7.9 Final Spreadsheet for the MSCA program Regression and the Correlation Matrix
7.4
Using Excel to Create a Correlation Matrix in Multiple Regression
167

This means that the better predictor of FIRST-YEAR GPA is GRE WRITING
with a correlation of +.85. Adding the second predictor variable, GRE QUANTI-
TATIVE, improved the prediction by .03 to 0.88. GRE WRITING is an excellent
prediction of FIRST-YEAR GPA all by itself.
If you want to learn more about the correlation matrix, see Levine et al. (2011).

One-Way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)
So far in this 2016 Excel Guide, you have learned how to use a one-group t-test to
compare the sample mean to the population mean, and a two-group t-test to test for
the difference between two sample means. But what should you do when you have
more than two groups and you want to determine if there is a signiﬁcant difference
between the means of these groups?
The answer to this question is: Analysis of Variance (ANOVA).
The ANOVA test allows you to test for the difference between the means when
you have three or more groups in your research study.
Important note: In order to do One-way Analysis of Variance, you need to have
installed the “Data Analysis Toolpak” that was described in
Chap. 6 (see Sect. 6.5.1). If you did not install this, you need to
do that now.
One of the good things about advertising in the US is that you can’t make wild
claims in ads about how your product/service is “better than the competition” when
you name your competitors in the ad, or you can face very expensive legal action
and ﬁnes. This is called “comparative advertising.” If you wanted to claim in an ad
that “Our prices are lower than the competition”, and you wanted to name your
competitors in the ad, you need evidence that your claim is truthful. Let’s suppose
that you have been hired to do a comparative pricing study and that you are
interested in comparing prices between three major supermarket chains in
St. Louis: (1) Dierberg’s, (2) Schnuck’s, and (3) Shop ‘n Save. Suppose, further,
that you have selected the 28 speciﬁc items listed in the table below as your “market
basket of products” to compare prices at these three supermarkets. You have also
speciﬁed the package size of each of these items in your checklist. Item #14, for
example, might be: Tide Liquid laundry detergent, 20 ounces.
Suppose that you have selected zip code 63119 in St. Louis, as this zip code has
one store of each of these three supermarket chains and that you want to do a small
pilot study of this research project. Let’s suppose that you drive to each of these

Now, let’s discuss how you should interpret this table:
8.2
How to Interpret the ANOVA Table Correctly
Objective: To interpret the ANOVA table correctly
ANOVA allows you to test for the differences between means when you have three
or more groups of data. This ANOVA test is called the F-test statistic, and is
typically identiﬁed with the letter: F.
The formula for the F-test is this:
F ¼ Mean Square between groups MSb
ð
Þ divided by Mean Square
within groups MSw
ð
Þ
F ¼ MSb=MSw
ð8:1Þ

8.2
How to Interpret the ANOVA Table Correctly
179

The derivation and explanation of this formula is beyond the scope of this Excel
Guide. In this Excel Guide, we are attempting to teach you how to use Excel, and we
are not attempting to teach you the statistical theory that is behind the ANOVA
formulas. For a detailed explanation of ANOVA, see Weiers (2011).
Note that cell D47 contains MSb ¼ 4.17, while cell D48 contains MSw ¼ 1.23.
When you divide these two ﬁgures using their cell references in Excel, you get
the answer for the F-test of 3.40 which is in cell E47. Let’s discuss now the meaning
of the ﬁgure: F ¼ 3.40.
In order to determine whether this ﬁgure for F of 3.40 indicates a signiﬁcant
difference between the means of the three groups, the ﬁrst step is to write the null
hypothesis and the research hypothesis for the three groups of prices.
In our supermarket price comparisons, the null hypothesis states that the popu-
lation means of the three groups are equal, while the research hypothesis states that
the population means of the three groups are not equal and that there is, therefore, a
signiﬁcant difference between the population means of the three groups. Which of
these two hypotheses should you accept based on the ANOVA results?
8.3
Using the Decision Rule for the ANOVA F-Test
To state the hypotheses, let’s call Dierberg’s as Group 1, Schnuck’s as Group 2, and
Shop ‘n Save as Group 3. The hypotheses would then be:
H0 :
μ1 ¼ μ2 ¼ μ3
H1 :
μ1 6¼ μ2 6¼ μ3
The answer to this question is analogous to the decision rule used in this book for
both the one-group t-test and the two-group t-test. You will recall that this rule (see
Sects. 4.1.6 and 5.1.8) was:
If the absolute value of t is less than the critical t, you accept the null hypothesis.
or
If the absolute value of t is greater than the critical t, you reject the null
hypothesis, and accept the research hypothesis.
Now, here is the decision rule for ANOVA:
Objective: To learn the decision rule for the ANOVA F-test
The decision rule for the ANOVA F-test is the following:
If the value for F is less than the critical F-value, accept the null hypothesis.
or
If the value of F is greater than the critical F-value, reject the null hypothesis,
and accept the research hypothesis.
180
8
One-Way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)

Note that Excel tells you the critical F-value in cell G47: 3.11
Therefore, our decision rule for the supermarket ANOVA test is this:
Since the value of F of 3.40 is greater than the critical F-value of 3.11, we reject
the null hypothesis and accept the research hypothesis.
Therefore, our conclusion, in plain English, is:
There is a signiﬁcant difference between the population means of the three
supermarket prices.
Note that it is not necessary to take the absolute value of F of 3.40. The F-value
can never be less than one, and so it can never be a negative value which requires us
to take its absolute value in order to treat it as a positive value.
It is important to note that ANOVA tells us that there was a signiﬁcant difference
between the population means of the three groups, but it does not tell us which pairs
of groups were signiﬁcantly different from each other.
8.4
Testing the Difference Between Two Groups Using
the ANOVA t-Test
To answer that question, we need to do a different test called the ANOVA t-test.
Objective: To test the difference between the means of two groups using an
ANOVA t-test when the ANOVA results indicate a signiﬁcant
difference between the population means.
Since we have three groups of data (one group for each of the three supermarkets),
we would have to perform three separate ANOVA t-tests to determine which pairs
of groups were signiﬁcantly different. This means that we would have to perform a
separate ANOVA t-test for the following pairs of groups:
1. Dierberg’s vs. Schnuck’s
2. Dierberg’s vs. Shop ‘n Save
3. Schnuck’s vs. Shop ‘n Save
We will do just one of these pairs of tests, Dierberg’s vs. Shop ‘n Save, to
illustrate the way to perform an ANOVA t-test comparing these two supermarkets.
The ANOVA t-test for the other two pairs of groups would be done in the same way.

8.4.1
Comparing Dierberg’s vs. Shop ‘n Save in Their Prices
Using the ANOVA t-Test
Objective: To compare Dierberg’s vs. Shop ‘n Save in their prices for the
28 items in the shopping basket using the ANOVA t-test.
The ﬁrst step is to write the null hypothesis and the research hypothesis for these
two supermarkets.
For the ANOVA t-test, the null hypothesis is that the population means of the
two groups are equal, while the research hypothesis is that the population means of
the two groups are not equal (i.e., there is a signiﬁcant difference between these two
means). Since we are comparing Dierberg’s (Group 1) vs. Shop ‘n Save (Group 3),
these hypotheses would be:
H0 :
μ1 ¼ μ3
H1 :
μ1 6¼ μ3
For Group 1 vs. Group 3, the formula for the ANOVA t-test is:
ANOVA t ¼

ð8:3Þ
The steps involved in computing this ANOVA t-test are:
1. Find the difference of the sample means for the two groups (2.44 – 1.69 ¼ 0.75).
2. Find 1/n1 + 1/n3 (since both groups have 28 supermarket items in them, this
becomes: 1/28 + 1/28 ¼ 0.0357 + 0.0357 ¼ 0.0714)
3. Multiply MSw times the answer for step 2 (1.23  0.0714 ¼ 0.0878)
4. Take the square root of step 3 (SQRT (0.0878) ¼ 0.30)
5. Divide Step 1 by Step 4 to ﬁnd ANOVA t (0.75/0.30 ¼ 2.50)
Note: Since Excel computes all calculations to 16 decimal places, when you use
Excel for the above computations, your answer will be 2.54 instead of 2.50
that you will obtain if you use your calculator.
Now, what do we do with this ANOVA t-test result of 2.50? In order to interpret
this value of 2.50 correctly, we need to determine the critical value of t for the
ANOVA t-test. To do that, we need to ﬁnd the degrees of freedom for the ANOVA
t-test as follows:
182
8
One-Way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)

8.4.1.1
Finding the Degrees of Freedom for the ANOVA t-Test
Objective: To ﬁnd the degrees of freedom for the ANOVA t-test.
The degrees of freedom (df) for the ANOVA t-test is found as follows:
df ¼ take the total sample size of all of the groups and subtract the number of
groups in your study (nTOTAL  k where k ¼ the number of groups)
In our example, the total sample size of the three groups is 84 since there are
28 prices for each of the three supermarkets, and since there are three groups,
84  3 gives a degrees of freedom for the ANOVA t-test of 81.
If you look up df ¼ 81 in the t-table in Appendix E in the degrees of freedom
column (df), which is the second column on the left of this table, you will ﬁnd that
the critical t-value is 1.96.
Important note: Be sure to use the degrees of freedom column (df) in Appendix E
for the ANOVA t-test critical t value
8.4.1.2
Stating the Decision Rule for the ANOVA t-Test
Objective: To learn the decision rule for the ANOVA t-test
Interpreting the result of the ANOVA t-test follows the same decision rule that we
used for both the one-group t-test (see Sect. 4.1.6) and the two-group t-test (see
Sect. 5.1.8):
If the absolute value of t is less than the critical value of t, we accept the null
hypothesis.
or
If the absolute value of t is greater than the critical value of t, we reject the null
hypothesis and accept the research hypothesis.
Since we are using a type of t-test, we need to take the absolute value of t. Since
the absolute value of 2.50 is greater than the critical t-value of 1.96, we reject the
null hypothesis (that the population means of the two groups are equal) and accept
the research hypothesis (that the population means of the two groups are signiﬁ-
cantly different from one another).
This means that our conclusion, in plain English, is as follows:
The average prices of our market basket of items at Dierberg’s were signiﬁcantly
higher than the average prices at Shop ‘n Save ($2.44 vs. $1.69).
Note that this difference in average prices of $0.75 might not seem like much,
but in practical terms, this means that the average prices at Dierberg’s are 44%
8.4

higher than the average prices at Shop ‘n Save. This, clearly, is an important
difference in prices from these two supermarkets based on our hypothetical data.
8.4.1.3
Performing an ANOVA t-Test Using Excel Commands
Now, let’s do these calculations for the ANOVA t-test using Excel with the ﬁle you
created earlier in this chapter: SUPER6

You should now have the following results in these cells when you round off all
these ﬁgures in the ANOVA t-test to two decimal points:

Testing the Difference Between Two Groups Using the ANOVA t-Test
185

For a more detailed explanation of the ANOVA t-test, see Black (2010) and
Stine and Foster (2018).
Important note: You are only allowed to perform an ANOVA t-test comparing the
population means of two groups when the F-test produces a sig-
niﬁcant difference between the population means of all of the
groups in your study.
It is improper to do any ANOVA t-test when the value of F is less
than the critical value of F. Whenever F is less than the critical F,
this means that there was no difference between the population
means of the groups, and, therefore, that you cannot test to see if
there is a difference between the means of any two groups since this
would capitalize on chance differences between these two groups.

1. Suppose that your advertising agency has been hired to compare Company A’s
premium brand of tire in “miles driven” (Brand A) to two major competitors’
brands (B and C) as part of a possible new advertising campaign. You have been
asked to “run the data” to determine if company A’s new tires “last longer” than
your competitors’ premium tires. Suppose, further, that you have set up a
laboratory test of the three types of tires, and you have measured the number of
simulated miles driven before the tread length reached a pre-determined amount.
The hypothetical results are given in Fig. 8.6. Note that the data are in thousands
of miles driven (000), so, for example, 63 is really 63,000 miles driven.

Very important: If you obtained very different answers for this problem, it is
probably because you mixed up the x-axis and the y-axis ﬁgures.
The original data for this problem purposely gave you the x-axis
and the y-axis data backwards so that you had to reverse these
data to create your spreadsheet. Be very careful you do not make
this mistake in your job or you will be in very big trouble!

35. Brand C was driven signiﬁcantly more miles than both Brand A and Brand
B. There was no difference in the number of miles driven between Brand A and
Brand B.
36. Since our company’s Brand A was driven signiﬁcantly less miles than Brand C,
we should never claim in our advertising for Brand A that we last more miles
than Brand C. Since our Brand A and Brand B were driven the same number of
miles, we should never claim that our tires last longer than Brand B.

Chapter 1: Practice Test
A “spokesperson” is someone who participates in an advertisement (TV, Radio,
Internet, Direct Mail, Magazines, etc.) who tries to convince you that the product/
service that this spokesperson is representing is one that you should purchase. In
order for the spokesperson to be effective, the target market of potential customers
needs to believe that the spokesperson is trustworthy, informative, sincere, quali-
ﬁed, and so forth, in these and in other dimensions so that target market ﬁnds this
spokesperson credible in his or her claims about the product/service.
An important part of advertising research involving spokespersons is to study the
effectiveness of the spokesperson on the target market’s perceptions of both the
spokesperson and what the ad is saying about the product/service.
One type of measurement scale that is frequently used in this type of advertising
research is called the semantic differential scale. This type of scale is frequently
described as containing bipolar adjectives as the end-points of a 7-point rating
scale. For example, the target market might be asked to describe what part of the
rating scale the spokesperson fell on items such as trustworthy/untrustworthy,
informative/uninformative, sincere/insincere, qualiﬁed/unqualiﬁed, and so forth.
Suppose that you have been asked to analyze the data from a target market that
consisted of female undergraduate college students (ages 18–24) who were shown a
possible television ad for a new type of cosmetic product that is being developed by
a major manufacturer of these types of products. Before diving into the data, you
want to try your Excel skills on a set of hypothetical data for Item #12 of this survey
to make sure that you can do this type of analysis correctly. The data appear in
Fig. B.1:

heading:
FRAME NUMBERS
(b) Then, create a separate column to the right of these frame numbers which
duplicates these frame numbers with the title: Duplicate frame numbers.
(c) Then, create a separate column to the right of these duplicate frame numbers
called RAND NO. and use the ¼RAND() function to assign random numbers to
all of the frame numbers in the duplicate frame numbers column, and change
this column format so that three decimal places appear for each random
number.

Important note: Note that everyone who does this problem will generate a
different random order of advertising manager ID numbers
since Excel assigns a different random number each time the
RAND() command is used. For this reason, the answer to this
problem given in this Excel Guide will have a completely
different sequence of random numbers from the random
sequence that you generate. This is normal and what is to be
expected.

Many US airlines charge a “change fee” if a passenger cancels a scheduled ﬂight
and wants to change the date/time of that ﬂight. This fee typically ranges from $150
to $200. It is typical that if the airline cancels a ﬂight due to inclement weather or
mechanical problems with the aircraft that this fee is waived.
Suppose that you purchased a ticket on Delta Airlines to ﬂy from St. Louis,
Missouri (US) to Boston, Massachusetts (US) and that Delta cancelled your ﬂight
because a major winter storm came up the east coast of the US and resulted in many
ﬂights being cancelled. Suppose, further, that you called the Customer Service
Department of Delta and asked to change your ﬂight to a different date. At the
present time, when you do that, a computer recording asks you to stay on the line at
the end of your phone call to answer a one-item 5-point survey. This survey item

Massachusetts Mutual Financial Group (2010) placed a full-page color ad in The
Wall Street Journal in which it used a male model hugging a two-year old daughter.
The ad had the headline and sub-headline:
WHAT IS THE SIGN OF A GOOD DECISION?
It’s knowing your life insurance can help provide income for retirement.
And peace of mind until you get there.
Since the majority of the subscribers to The Wall Street Journal are men, an
interesting research question would be the following:
Research question: “Does the gender of the model affect adult men’s willingness to
learn more about how life insurance can provide income for
retirement?”
Suppose that you have shown two groups of adult males (ages 25–44) a mockup of
an ad such one group of males saw the ad with a male model, while another group of
males saw the identical ad except that it had a female model in the ad. (You
randomly assigned these males to one of the two experimental groups.) The two
groups were kept separate during the experiment and could not interact with one
another.
At the end of a one-hour discussion of the mockup ad, the respondents were
asked the question given in Fig. B.4.

Suppose that you work in a marketing research department for a weight-watchers
national company and that you have been asked to “run the data” to determine the
relationship between DIET (measured in calories allowed per day) and WEIGHT
LOSS (measured in kilograms, kg) for adult women between the ages of 30 and
40 who are overweight for their height and body structure, and who all weigh
roughly the same number of kilograms before undertaking the weight loss program.
The results of this study might be considered for a future advertising campaign for
this company. You want to test your Excel skills on a random sample of these
women based on their weight change over the past four months to make sure that
you can do this type of research. The hypothetical data appear in Fig. B.6:
Fig. B.6 Worksheet Data

Appendices

Create an Excel spreadsheet and enter the data using DIET (calories allowed per
day) as the independent variable (predictor) and WEIGHT LOSS (kg) as the
dependent variable (criterion). Underneath the table, use Excel’s ¼correl function
to ﬁnd the correlation between these two variables. Label the correlation and place
it underneath the table; then round off the correlation to two decimal places.
(a) create an XY scatterplot of these two sets of data such that:
• top title: RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DIET AND WEIGHT LOSS
• x-axis title: DIET (calories allowed per day)
• y-axis title: WEIGHT LOSS (kg)
• move the chart below the table
• re-size the chart so that it is 8 columns wide and 25 rows long
(b) Create the least-squares regression line for these data on the scatterplot, and
add the regression equation to the chart.
(c) Use Excel to run the regression statistics to ﬁnd the equation for the least-
squares regression line for these data and display the results below the chart on
your spreadsheet. Use number format (two decimal places) for the correlation
and three decimal places for all other decimal ﬁgures, including the coefﬁcients.
(d) Print just the input data and the chart so that this information ﬁts onto one page.
Then, print the regression output table on a separate page so that it ﬁts onto that
separate page.

Chapter 7: Practice Test
The performance rating given to an advertising manager at an organization is
frequently a basis for that manager’s promotion opportunities, perceived value to
the organization, and, sometimes, even that advertising manager’s salary raise.
Suppose that you want to study the relationship between the number of years of
relevant business experience of an advertising manager, the number of undergrad-
uate or graduate degrees earned by that manager, and that manager’s performance
rating (rated on a scale where 1 ¼ Poor and 7 ¼ Excellent) at a large, high-tech
company. You decide to test your Excel skills on a small sample of mid-level
advertising managers at your company to study this relationship.

Chapter 8: Practice Test
Suppose that you have been asked to analyze the data from a test marketing study in
which three cities with comparable household income levels, population, and other
key demographic variables were tested in terms of TV ads run on local channels that
stressed just one of the characteristics of a new product in each city: (1) Price,
(2) Quality, and (3) Convenience-of-use. You have been asked to determine if there
was a signiﬁcant difference in the number of units of this product that were sold in
these three cities during test marketing. You decide to test your Excel skills on the
hypothetical data given in Fig. B.8:
Appendices
239

(a) Enter these data on an Excel spreadsheet.
(b) On your spreadsheet, write the null hypothesis and the research hypothesis for
these data
(c) Perform a one-way ANOVA test on these data, and show the resulting ANOVA
table underneath the input data for the three cities.
(d) If the F-value in the ANOVA table is signiﬁcant, create an Excel formula to
compute the ANOVA t-test comparing the number of units sold when Price
was stressed in the TV ad against the number of units sold when Convenience-
of-use was stressed in the TV ad, and show the results below the ANOVA table
on the spreadsheet (put the standard error and the ANOVA t-test value on
separate lines of your spreadsheet, and use two decimal places for each value)
(e) Print out the resulting spreadsheet so that all of the information ﬁts onto one
page
(f) On your printout, label by hand the MS (between groups) and the MS (within
groups)
(g) Circle and label the value for F on your printout for the ANOVA of the input
data
(h) Label by hand on the printout the mean for Price and the mean for
Convenience-of-use that were produced by your ANOVA formulas

On a separate sheet of paper, now answer the following questions:
(i) What is the critical value of F in the ANOVA Single Factor table that you
created?
(j) Write a summary of the results of the ANOVA test for the input data.
(k) Write a summary of the conclusion of the ANOVA test in plain English for the
input data.
(l) Write the null hypothesis and the research hypothesis comparing Price versus
Convenience-of-use.
(m) Compute the degrees of freedom for the ANOVA t-test.
(n) Write the critical value of t for the ANOVA t-test using the table in Appendix E
(o) write a summary of the result of the ANOVA t-test
(p) write a summary of the conclusion of the ANOVA t-test in plain English

F ¼ 50.30
(h) Mean Price ¼ 460.50, and Mean Convenience of use ¼ 311.80
(i)
critical F ¼ 3.23
(j)
Results: Since 50.30 is greater than the critical F of 3.23, we reject the null
hypothesis and accept the research hypothesis.
(k) Conclusion: There was a signiﬁcant difference in the number of units sold of
the new product in the three cities between the three types of TV ads.
(l)
Null hypothesis:
μ1 ¼ μ3
Research hypothesis:
μ1 6¼ μ3
(m) df ¼ n TOTAL  k ¼ 44  3 ¼ 41
(n)
critical t ¼ 1.96
(o)
Result: Since the absolute value of 7.02 is greater than the critical t of 1.96, we
reject the null hypothesis and accept the research hypothesis.
(p)
Conclusion: TV ads that stressed Price sold signiﬁcantly more units than TV
ads that stressed Convenience-of-use (461 units vs. 312 units).
