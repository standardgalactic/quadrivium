About the Author
Eliot Greenspan is a poet, journalist, musician, and travel writer 
who took his backpack, mandolin, and typewriter the length of 
Mesoamerica before settling in Costa Rica in 1992. Since then, he 
has worked steadily as a travel writer, freelance journalist, and 
translator, and continued his travels in the region. He is also the 
author of Frommer’s Costa Rica, Frommer’s Belize, Frommer’s 
Guatemala, Frommer’s Ecuador, and The Tico Times Restaurant 
Guide to Costa Rica, as well as the chapter on Venezuela in 
Frommer’s South America.
Dedication
As with previous editions, I’d like to again dedicate this book to 
Allen Ginsberg, Fielding Dawson, and Jane Faigao — three dear 
friends and teachers whom I treasure and miss.
Author’s Acknowledgments
Here’s to all the industry insiders, longtime locals, and everyday 
tourists, whose thoughts and impressions add immeasurably to 
my own wanderings, adventures, test runs, and site inspections. 
I’d also like to thank Mayling Charpentier for her help on the road 
and phones, as well as Myka Carroll and Jennifer Reilly for their 
editorial diligence.

Introduction
C
osta Rica is one of the top vacation destinations in the Americas. 
Aside from sun-drenched beaches, steamy jungles, and abundant 
wildlife, Costa Rica has a wealth of attractions and adventures to please 
a wide range of travelers. Whether you’re a family looking for something 
new, a snow bunny working on a winter tan, or an avid naturalist itching 
to delve into the wonderful world of the tropical rain forest, there’s a 
Costa Rican vacation waiting just for you.
Costa Rica For Dummies, 3rd Edition, makes planning a vacation easy. 
Instead of an endless list with encyclopedic entries, this book focuses on 
the best that Costa Rica has to offer.
About This Book
Costa Rica For Dummies is a concise and precise guide to the top vaca-
tion options in Costa Rica. I’ve done the legwork for you and weeded out 
the unnecessary and overrated. I’ve tried to anticipate your every ques-
tion, without bogging you down with superfluous details.
I give honest and accurate descriptions of Costa Rica’s various hotels, 
restaurants, and attractions. I’m not afraid to take a stand to help you 
decide what to include in your Costa Rican vacation — and, even more 
important, what not to include.
Feel free to jump around or skip certain sections altogether. Use the 
index and table of contents — and the brief intro that I include here — 
to zero in and find the information most important to help you plan and 
enjoy a perfect vacation.
Please be advised that travel information is subject to change at any 
time — and this is especially true of prices. You may want to write or 
call ahead for confirmation when making your travel plans.
Conventions Used in This Book
In this book, hotels and restaurants are listed alphabetically with actual 
prices and frank evaluations. I include lists of hotels, restaurants, and 
attractions. As I describe each one, I often include abbreviations for 
commonly accepted credit cards:

Costa Rica For Dummies, 3rd Edition 
2
AE: American Express
DC: Diners Club
MC: MasterCard
V: Visa
I also include some general pricing information to help you as you 
decide where to unpack your bags or dine on the local cuisine. I’ve used 
a system of U.S. dollar signs to show a range of costs for one night in a 
hotel (double occupancy) or a full meal for one at a restaurant (includ-
ing a soup or salad, an entree, a dessert, and a nonalcoholic drink).
Check out the following table to decipher the dollar signs.
Cost 
Hotel 
Restaurant
$ 
Less than $75 
 Less than $10
$$ 
$75–$125 
 $10–$20
$$$ 
$126–$200 
 $21–$30
$$$$ 
$201–$350 
 $31–$45
$$$$$ 
More than $350 
More than $45
The dollar-sign ratings allow you to make quick comparisons of the 
costs of various establishments. However, I also list specific and detailed 
pricing information in every listing.
Throughout this book, I use the exchange rate of 560 colones to $1. 
However, the Costa Rican colón is in a steady rate of devaluation, while 
the dollar and British pound also are in flux. To check the very latest 
exchange rates before you leave home, point your browser to www.
xe.com/ucc.
For those hotels, restaurants, and attractions that are plotted on a map, 
a page reference is provided in the listing information. If a hotel, restau-
rant, or attraction is outside the city limits or in an out-of-the-way area, 
it may not be mapped.
Foolish Assumptions
As I wrote this book, I made some assumptions about you and what your 
needs as a traveler may be. Here’s what I assumed about you:
 
✓ You may be an experienced traveler who hasn’t had much time to 
explore Costa Rica and wants expert advice when you finally do get 
a chance to enjoy the country.
 
✓ You may be an inexperienced traveler looking for guidance when 
determining whether to take a trip to Costa Rica and how to plan 
for it.

 Introduction 3
 
✓ You’re not looking for a book that provides all the information 
available about Costa Rica or that lists every hotel, restaurant, or 
attraction available to you. Instead, you’re looking for a book that 
focuses on the places that will give you the best or most unique 
experiences in Costa Rica.
How This Book Is Organized
Costa Rica For Dummies contains eight parts. Parts I and II provide the 
nuts-and-bolts information to help you choose where and when to go 
and how to plan your trip. Parts III, IV, V, VI, and VII give detailed infor-
mation on the best hotels, restaurants, and attractions to be found at 
the various destinations across Costa Rica. Part VIII provides some 
quick and clear final recommendations and important facts.
Part I: Introducing Costa Rica
Part I is an overview of Costa Rica’s various destinations and attractions. 
There is an easy-to-scan list of the very best of the best — my personal 
picks of Costa Rica’s top hotels, nature lodges, restaurants, beaches, 
adventures, and more. I take a quick look into Costa Rica’s history, cul-
ture, and cuisine, and offer straightforward advice on how to budget 
your time and decide where and when to visit.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Costa Rica
Here is where I lay out everything you need to make all the arrangements 
for your trip. I get down to the serious trip preparation, including how 
much you can expect your trip to cost. I weigh the pros and cons of 
planning your trip on your own, using a travel agent, and buying an all-
inclusive package deal. I also offer special trip-planning advice for fami-
lies, singles, gay and lesbian travelers, seniors, and travelers who are 
physically challenged. Finally, I take you through all the ins and outs of 
other vacation essentials, from getting a passport and considering travel 
insurance to staying safe.
Part III: San José and the Central Valley
A vast majority of visitors to Costa Rica spend some time in San José 
(Costa Rica’s capital city) and its environs, whether as a transportation 
hub or as an initial base for their trip. Part III tells you all you need to 
know about settling in and dining in style in San José and the surround-
ing Central Valley. It also includes advice on must-see attractions and 
exciting day trips.
Part IV: Guanacaste and Environs
Costa Rica’s “Gold Coast” is where to discover the beaches of the north-
western province of Guanacaste. Part IV delves into a variety of these 
beach towns and nearby destinations, with recommendations for 

Costa Rica For Dummies, 3rd Edition 
4
everything from small boutique hotels to large, full-scale resorts. I 
describe the many tour and adventure options available in Guanacaste, 
including side trips to the inland Rincón de la Vieja National Park.
Part V: Manuel Antonio and Environs
Part V explores Costa Rica’s most popular ecotourism destination, the 
lovely Manuel Antonio National Park. It also covers the surrounding cen-
tral Pacific coast, both north and south of Manuel Antonio, touching on 
the beach destinations of playas Jacó, Herradura, and Hermosa, as well 
as Dominical.
Part VI: Monteverde and Environs
Monteverde, with its misty cloud forests, and Arenal, with its active vol-
cano, are Costa Rica’s principal inland attractions. This part covers both 
of these major attractions, while also introducing you to the area sur-
rounding Lake Arenal. You’ll find ample information about nature hikes, 
rafting trips, volcano viewing, hot springs, and more in this rich region.
Part VII: Touring the Rest of Costa Rica
If you want to explore the farther flung and less visited — although no 
less spectacular or interesting — Costa Rican destinations Part VII is 
where to find information. I give you recommendations and planning 
advice for trips to the remote beach destinations of the southern Nicoya 
Peninsula, the lush rain forests of southern Costa Rica, and the coun-
try’s unique Caribbean coast.
Part VIII: The Part of Tens
Every For Dummies book has a Part of Tens. These two fun and pithy 
chapters are a little gift to you. Chapter 22 dispels some common myths 
and misconceptions about Costa Rica. Chapter 23 provides a concise list 
of some of the top experiences, attractions, and activities to be had in 
this beautiful country.
Appendix: Quick Concierge
In the back of this book, I’ve included an appendix — your Quick 
Concierge — containing lots of handy information you may need when 
traveling in Costa Rica. This one-stop reference section includes impor-
tant phone numbers and Web addresses, as well as the inside scoop on 
issues running from safety to water quality. Check out this appendix 
when searching for answers to lots of little questions that may come up 
as you plan or travel. You can find the Quick Concierge easily because 
it’s printed on yellow paper.

 Introduction 5
Icons Used in This Book
Think of the following icons as signposts. I use them to highlight espe-
cially useful advice, to draw your attention to things you won’t want to 
miss, and to introduce a variety of topics.
 
 Keep an eye out for the Bargain Alert icon as you seek out money-saving 
tips and/or great deals.
 
 The Best of the Best icon highlights the best the destination has to offer 
in all categories — hotels, restaurants, attractions, activities, shopping, 
and nightlife.
 
 Watch for the Heads Up icon to identify annoying or potentially danger-
ous situations such as tourist traps, unsafe neighborhoods, budgetary 
rip-offs, and other things to beware.
 
 Find out useful advice on things to do and ways to schedule your time 
when you see the Tip icon.
 Look to the Kid Friendly icon for attractions, hotels, restaurants, and 
activities that are particularly hospitable to children or people traveling 
with kids.
 
 This icon points out secret little finds or useful resources that are worth 
the extra bit of effort to get to or track down.
Where to Go from Here
A Costa Rican vacation can be many things to many people. Options 
range from bird-watching and rain-forest hiking to high-octane adventur-
ing to simply settling into a chaise lounge on a quiet beach and sipping 
cool cocktails.
Don’t think of choosing your Costa Rican destinations and solidifying the 
details as a burden or a bore. Let this book help make the process an 
exciting time of discovery and opportunity. Enjoy and savor the plan-
ning. And then have a great trip!

Part I
Introducing 
Costa Rica

In this part . . .
S
o you want to begin fi nding out about Costa Rica? In this 
part, I provide all the basic information you need to start 
planning a perfect vacation particularly suited to your needs 
and interests.
Chapter 1 tells you briefl y about the best places, experiences, 
and attractions in Costa Rica. Additional information and 
detailed descriptions can be found later on, but this is the 
place to come for a condensed listing of the highlights.
If you want some historical background, cultural insight, or 
local language tips, Chapter 2 offers that up, and more.
Chapter 3 describes the various regions and destinations to 
help you choose where to go. In addition, if you want to fi nd 
out about the local weather patterns and seasons, and some 
interesting Costa Rican holidays, celebrations, and events, 
this chapter is for you.
Finally, Chapter 4 lays out several potential itineraries that 
you can either follow to the letter or use as a rough draft in 
designing your perfect trip to Costa Rica.

Chapter 1
Discovering the Best 
of Costa Rica
In This Chapter
▶ Scoping out Costa Rica’s top accommodations
▶ Finding the finest restaurants
▶ Exploring the best beaches, adventures, and attractions
F
or such a compact country, Costa Rica is a marvelous and multifac-
eted destination. You can visit rain forests, cloud forests, and active 
volcanoes. You can walk along miles of beautiful beaches on either the 
Pacific or the Caribbean coast. And, you can stay at luxurious large 
resorts or romantic little getaways.
Adventure hounds will have their fill choosing from an exciting array of 
activities, and those just looking for some rest and relaxation can grab a 
chaise lounge or hammock and a good book.
 
 This chapter is designed as an at-a-glance reference to the absolute “best 
of the best” that Costa Rica has to offer, which are listed in the order they 
appear in the book. These attractions are highlighted by — what else — a 
Best of the Best icon when they appear elsewhere in this book.
The Best High-End Hotels and Luxury Resorts
Not too long ago, finding anything to fit in this category was difficult. 
Now, it’s a breeze. Costa Rica boasts quite a few top-notch luxury prop-
erties ranging from isolated and unique boutique hotels to large beach 
resorts. The following are the best of the best:
 
✓ Costa Rica Marriott (San José): The Marriott is hands down the 
best of the large resort and business-class hotels in the San José 
area. Everything is in great shape, the service is bend-over-back-
wards, the restaurants are excellent, and the hotel features all the 
facilities and amenities you could want, save a golf course. See 
Chapter 11.

Part I: Introducing Costa Rica 
10
 
✓ Finca Rosa Blanca Country Inn (Heredia): My favorite boutique 
hotel in the San José metropolitan area. If the cookie-cutter rooms 
of large hotels leave you cold, then the unique rooms of this artistic 
inn may be up your alley. Finca Rosa Blanca is set among the lush 
hillsides and coffee plantations of Heredia, just 20 minutes from 
San José. See Chapter 11.
 
✓ Peace Lodge (north of Varablanca): The rooms here abound in 
beautiful design touches, and the bathrooms in the deluxe units are 
the most spectacular in the country. Each room comes with at least 
one custom-tiled Jacuzzi on a private balcony. The hotel adjoins 
the popular La Paz Waterfall Gardens. See Chapter 11.
 
✓ Arenas del Mar (Manuel Antonio): This boutique resort combines 
beautiful views with easy beach access, a rare commodity in 
Manuel Antonio. With large and ample rooms, excellent service and 
amenities, a fabulous restaurant, and a beautiful little spa, this 
place has a lot to offer. See Chapter 13.
 
✓ Four Seasons Resort (Papagayo Peninsula): The Four Seasons is 
currently the only major resort to really address the ultra-high-end 
luxury market in Costa Rica. Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, Madonna, 
and Michael Jordan are just a few of the notable guests who have 
come here. A beautiful setting, wonderful installations, a world-
class golf course, and stellar service make this the current king of 
the hill in the upscale market. See Chapter 13.
 
✓ JW Marriott Guanacaste Resort & Spa (Hacienda Pinilla): With 
beautiful rooms, ample facilities, top-notch service, and the largest 
pool in Central America, this new resort has quickly established 
itself as one of the top upscale properties in the country. The ocean 
is just steps away, and there are several other excellent beaches 
nearby. See Chapter 13.
 
✓ Makanda by the Sea (Manuel Antonio): The large and luxurious 
villas here are superbly decorated and set on a forested hillside 
with wonderful views out to the sea. The overall vibe here is inti-
mate and romantic, and the service and food are excellent. See 
Chapter 15.
 
✓ Villa Caletas (north of Jacó): Spread out over a steep hillside, high 
above the Pacific Ocean, these large and luxurious individual villas 
have a Mediterranean feel. The “infinity pool” here was one of the 
first in Costa Rica and is still my favorite. Sitting in a lounge chair at 
the pool’s edge, you’ll swear that it joins the sea. See Chapter 16.
 
✓ Tabacón Grand Spa Thermal Resort (Arenal volcano): In addition 
to having the most lush and luxurious natural hot springs and adja-
cent spa, this resort offers up stylish rooms with excellent views 
and proximity to the active Arenal volcano. Service and food here 
are top-notch as well. See Chapter 18.
 
✓ The Springs Resort & Spa (Arenal volcano): This new resort fea-
tures opulent rooms with extravagant bathrooms, a series of 

 Chapter 1: Discovering the Best of Costa Rica 11
sculpted hot-spring pools, excellent restaurants, extensive facili-
ties, and fabulous views. See Chapter 18.
 
✓ Hotel Punta Islita (Nicoya Peninsula): Perched on a high, flat bluff 
overlooking the Pacific Ocean, Punta Islita is very popular with 
honeymooners, and rightly so. The rooms are large and luxurious, 
the food is excellent, and the setting is stunning. If you venture 
beyond your room and the hotel’s inviting hillside pool, there’s a 
long, almost always deserted beach for you to explore, as well as a 
wealth of activities for the more adventurous. See Chapter 19.
 
✓ Flor Blanca Resort (Playa Santa Teresa): The individual villas at 
this boutique resort are some of the largest and most beautiful in 
the country. The service and food are outstanding, and the location 
is breathtaking, spread over a lushly planted hillside just steps off 
Playa Santa Teresa. See Chapter 19.
 
✓ Tree House Lodge (Punta Uva): A unique and beautifully designed 
collection of private houses offers one of the most creative and lux-
urious accommodations on the Caribbean coast. I like the name-
sake Tree House suite, where a live tree occupies a central part of 
the living area, although the Beach House suite is also quite spec-
tacular. See Chapter 21.
The Best Accommodations Values
Not looking to spend a fortune? No problem. Costa Rica is chock-full of 
excellent hotel and lodging values. Get the most for your accommoda-
tions dollar by booking into one of these fine establishments:
 
✓ Hotel Grano de Oro (San José): San José boasts dozens of old 
homes that have been converted into hotels, but few offer the luxu-
rious accommodations or professional service that can be found at 
the Grano de Oro — and all at a great price. See Chapter 11.
 
✓ Hotel Le Bergerac (San José): This classy little hotel has been 
pleasing diplomats, dignitaries, and other discerning travelers for 
years. Ask for one of the garden rooms, or get the old master bed-
room with its small private balcony. See Chapter 11.
 
✓ Hotel Aranjuez (San José): True budget seekers should look no fur-
ther when looking to crash in San José. Great location, clean rooms, 
ample common areas, and plenty of perks make this a perennially 
popular choice. See Chapter 11.
 
✓ El Velero Hotel (Playa Hermosa): Set right on the beach, this little 
hotel offers cozy, upbeat rooms at a great price. A small pool and 
excellent restaurant round out the offerings here. See Chapter 13.
 
✓ Hotel Verde Mar (Manuel Antonio): One of Manuel Antonio’s few 
true beachfront hotels is also one of its best bargains. Rooms are 
large and attractive and, most important, just a short walk from the 
surf. See Chapter 15.

Part I: Introducing Costa Rica 
12
 
✓ Hotel Fonda Vela (Monteverde): Many of the cozy and contempo-
rary rooms here have views of the Nicoya Gulf. The restaurant here 
is excellent, and this is one of the closest lodgings to the famed 
Monteverde Cloud Forest Preserve. See Chapter 17.
 
✓ Amor de Mar (Montezuma): The rooms here are simple, but 
they’re also clean, comfortable, and well maintained. And the set-
ting is superb. A long, grassy lawn leads down to the rocky coast, 
where you’ll find a swimming-pool-size tide pool carved into a coral 
rock outcropping. See Chapter 19.
 
✓ Cabinas Sol y Mar (Playa Zancudo): These beachfront rooms are a 
real bargain. Cozy and well-equipped, they’re set just steps from 
the surf, surrounded by lush gardens and shady palm trees. The 
bar and restaurant here are excellent, lively, and justifiably popu-
lar. See Chapter 20.
 
✓ Casa Verde Lodge (Puerto Viejo): Lush gardens, tidy rooms, amia-
ble hosts, and great prices make this my favorite hotel in the tiny 
town of Puerto Viejo. The refreshing pool and close proximity to 
everything are nice perks as well. See Chapter 21.
 
✓ La Costa de Papito (Playa Cocles): This place features large and 
lovely independent and duplex wooden bungalows spread around 
lush grounds. Just 90m (295 ft.) or so away, however, are the warm 
waves of the Caribbean Sea. See Chapter 21.
The Best Ecolodges
Costa Rica is a major ecotourism destination, and you’ll find a wealth of 
wonderfully run ecolodges and nature resorts. Some of them, including 
several listed here, make a strong case for being listed among the top 
luxury hotels in the country:
 
✓ Monteverde Lodge (Monteverde): Run by the folks at Costa Rica 
Expeditions, this was one of the first ecolodges to open in 
Monteverde, and it remains one of the best. Beyond the comfort-
able accommodations and great food, the excellent guides are the 
greatest asset here. See Chapter 17.
 
✓ Arenal Observatory Lodge (La Fortuna): Originally a rustic research 
facility, this lodge has upgraded quite a bit over the years and now 
features comfortable rooms with impressive views of the Arenal 
volcano. There are also excellent trails to nearby lava flows and a 
beautiful waterfall. Toucans frequent the trees near the lodge, and 
howler monkeys provide the wake-up calls. See Chapter 18.
 
✓ La Paloma Lodge (Drake Bay): If your idea of the perfect nature 
lodge is one where your front porch provides some prime-time 
viewing of flora and fauna, this place is for you. If you decide to 
leave the comfort of your porch, the Osa Peninsula’s lowland rain 
forests are just outside your door. See Chapter 20.

 Chapter 1: Discovering the Best of Costa Rica 13
 
✓ Bosque del Cabo Rainforest Lodge (Osa Peninsula): Large and 
comfortable private cabins perched on the edge of a cliff overlook-
ing the Pacific Ocean and surrounded by lush rain forest make this 
one of my favorite spots in the country. There’s plenty to do, and 
there are always great guides here. See Chapter 20.
 
✓ Lapa Rios (Osa Peninsula): Costa Rica’s first upscale ecolodge has 
aged well. The duplex bungalow rooms all have spectacular views 
and are set into a lush forest. A number of tours are available for 
guests, and the guides are often local residents who are intimately 
familiar with the environment. See Chapter 20.
 
✓ Playa Nicuesa Rainforest Lodge (Golfo Dulce): This lodge is by far 
the best option on the Golfo Dulce. Set in deep forest, the individ-
ual bungalows here are a beguiling blend of rusticity and luxury. 
See Chapter 20.
 
✓ Selva Bananito Lodge (inland from the Caribbean coast): This is 
one of the few lodges providing direct access to the southern 
Caribbean lowland rain forests. There’s no electricity here, but that 
doesn’t mean it’s not plush. Hike along a riverbed, ride horses 
through the rain forest, climb 30m (100 ft.) up a ceiba tree, or 
rappel down a jungle waterfall. See Chapter 21.
 
✓ Tortuga Lodge (Tortuguero): Run by pioneering ecotourism opera-
tor Costa Rica Expeditions, this is the most comfortable and best 
equipped lodge in the Tortuguero area. The hotel has lush grounds, 
a beautiful pool, and excellent naturalist guides. See Chapter 21.
The Best Restaurants
Although Costa Rica is not known for its fine food, you’ll have no trouble 
dining well. The following restaurants run the gamut in terms of cuisine 
and ambience, from local fresh seafood served on plastic lawn chairs set 
in the sand to top-notch Pacific Rim fusion served in an elegant and 
refined setting. If your travels take you near any of these restaurants, 
don’t pass up the chance for a meal:
 
✓ Park Café (San José): The creative cooking of a 2-star Michelin chef 
combine with elegant décor and a romantic ambience in this court-
yard treasure. The menu changes regularly, but never disappoints. 
See Chapter 11.
 
✓ Grano de Oro Restaurant (San José): This elegant little hotel has a 
similarly elegant restaurant serving delicious Continental dishes 
and decadent desserts. The open-air seating in the lushly planted 
central courtyard is delightful, especially for lunch. See Chapter 11.
 
✓ Bacchus (Santa Ana): Set in a wonderfully restored and updated 
ancient adobe home, this restaurant serves up the best Italian fare 
in the metropolitan area. The setting is elegant and the service is 
refined. See Chapter 11.

Part I: Introducing Costa Rica

✓ Dragonfly Bar & Grill (Tamarindo): It’s almost always packed at this 
popular Tamarindo eatery. Southwestern American and Pacific Rim 
fusion cuisines are the primary culinary influences here. Portions are 
massive, service excellent, and the prices fair. See Chapter 13.
 
✓ Lola’s (Playa Avellanas): Fresh fruit juices, flash-grilled tuna, excel-
lent salads, crisp Belgian fries, and more are served up at this 
delightful beachfront restaurant. Hammocks are hung from coconut 
trees, and the waves are just steps away. See Chapter 13.
 
✓ Ginger (Playa Hermosa): Serving an eclectic mix of traditional and 
Pan-Asian-influenced tapas, this sophisticated little joint is taking 
this part of Guanacaste by storm. Ginger even has a list of creative 
cocktails to match the inventive dishes. See Chapter 13.
 
✓ Sunspot Bar & Grill (Manuel Antonio): The menu changes regu-
larly at this elegant restaurant housed under canvas tents poolside 
at one of Manuel Antonio’s top hotels. There are precious few 
tables here, so be sure to reserve in advance. See Chapter 15.
 
✓ El Patio Bistro Latino (Quepos): This casual but elegant little place 
is a welcome oasis in the somewhat seedy city of Quepos. The 
chef’s creative concoctions take full advantage of fresh local ingre-
dients. See Chapter 15.
 
✓ Sophia (Monteverde): This place serves excellent Latin fusion fare 
in an intimate setting about halfway along the rough dirt road 
between Santa Elena and the Monteverde Cloud Forest Preserve. 
See Chapter 17.
 
✓ Nectar (at Flor Blanca Resort, Santa Teresa): Guanacaste’s best 
boutique resort also has one of its best restaurants. The menu 
changes nightly but always has a heavy Pan-Asian-fusion flavor to 
it. The setting is romantic and subdued, in open-air space just steps 
from the sand. See Chapter 19.
 
✓ Playa de los Artistas (Montezuma): Whether you choose a seat on 
a tatami mat on the sand or one of their more traditional tables, 
this place is the perfect blend of refined cuisine and beachside 
funkiness. Fresh grilled seafood is the specialty here, and it’s done 
to perfection. See Chapter 19.
 
✓ La Pecora Nera (Puerto Viejo): I’m not sure that a tiny surfer town 
on the remote Caribbean coast deserves such fine Italian food, but 
it’s got it. Your best bet here is to allow yourself to be taken on a 
culinary roller-coaster ride with a mixed feast of the chef’s nightly 
specials and suggestions. See Chapter 21.
The Best Beaches
With more than 1,200km (750 miles) of shoreline on its Pacific and 
Caribbean coasts, Costa Rica offers beachgoers an embarrassment of 
riches:

 Chapter 1: Discovering the Best of Costa Rica 15
 
✓ Playa Tamarindo: Although some people may find Tamarindo 
overdeveloped, crowded, and chaotic, it’s still one of Costa Rica’s 
best beach destinations. Tamarindo has ample lodgings to suit every 
budget, as well as excellent restaurants at almost every turn. The 
beach here is long and broad, with sections calm enough for swim-
mers and others just right for surfers. Located about midway along 
the beaches of Guanacaste province, Tamarindo also has one of the 
liveliest nightlife scenes on this coast. See Chapters 13 and 14.
 
✓ Playa Nacascolo: This narrow band of soft white sand is a rare trea-
sure on this coast, which is typified by coarser dark-sand beaches. 
Although it’s within the grounds of the massive Four Seasons 
Resort, it’s public property and open to all. See Chapter 14.
 
✓ Playa Manuel Antonio: Costa Rica’s original rain forest–meets–
beach destination retains its charms despite burgeoning crowds 
and mushrooming hotels. The beaches inside the national park are 
idyllic, and the views from the hills outside the park are enchant-
ing. This is one of the few remaining habitats for the endangered 
squirrel monkey. See Chapter 15.
 
✓ Playa Montezuma: This little beach town at the southern tip of 
the Nicoya Peninsula has weathered fame and infamy and yet 
retains a funky sense of individuality. The nearby waterfalls are 
what set it apart from the competition, but the beach stretches for 
miles, with plenty of isolated spots to plop down your towel or mat. 
Also nearby are the Cabo Blanco and Curu wildlife preserves. See 
Chapter 19.
 
✓ Malpaís: If you’re looking to visit Costa Rica’s newest hot spot 
before the throngs discover it, head out to Malpaís. Here you’ll find 
miles of nearly deserted beaches, great surf, and just a smattering 
of lodges, surf camps, and simple cabinas. If Malpaís is too crowded 
for you, head farther on down the road to Santa Teresa, Playa 
Hermosa, or Manzanillo. See Chapter 19.
 
✓ Punta Uva and Manzanillo: Below Puerto Viejo, the beaches of 
Costa Rica’s eastern coast take on true Caribbean splendor, with 
turquoise waters, coral reefs, and palm-lined stretches of nearly 
deserted white-sand beach. Punta Uva and Manzanillo are the two 
most sparkling gems of this coastline. Tall coconut palms line the 
shore, providing shady respite for those who like to spend a full 
day on the sand, and the water is usually quite calm and good for 
swimming. See Chapter 21.
The Best Adventures and Activities
Costa Rica is a top-notch destination for adventure travel. The options 
and activities are many. Here are some of the best activities and adven-
tures awaiting you:

Part I: Introducing Costa Rica 
16
 
✓ Rafting the Pacuare River (near Turrialba): This class III and IV 
river passes through primary and secondary forests and a beautiful 
steep gorge that, sadly, may be dammed soon. Get there quick! 
Ríos Tropicales can take you on this river. See Chapter 12.
 
✓ Surfing Guanacaste Province: This northwestern province has 
dozens of respectable beach and reef breaks, from Witch’s Rock up 
near the Nicaraguan border to Playa Nosara more than 100km (62 
miles) away. In addition to these two prime spots, try a turn at 
Playa Grande and playas Negra and Avellanas. Or, find your own 
secret spot. Rent a 4×4 with a roof rack, pile on the boards, and 
explore. If you want to learn, most of the popular surf beaches up 
here have surf schools. See Chapter 14.
 
✓ Battling a billfish off the Pacific coast: Billfish are plentiful all 
along Costa Rica’s Pacific coast, and boats operate from most 
coastal beach and port towns. Go to Quepos (just outside Manuel 
Antonio) for the best fish scene, or head down to Drake Bay, the 
Osa Peninsula, or Golfo Dulce, if you want some isolation. See 
Chapters 15 and 20.
 
✓ Swinging through the treetops on a canopy tour: This unique 
adventure is becoming quite the rage. In most cases, after a strenu-
ous climb using ascenders, you strap on a harness and zip from 
treetop to treetop while dangling from a cable. There are canopy 
tours all around Costa Rica. Check the various destination chapters 
to find a canopy tour operation near you.
 
✓ Mountain-biking the back roads of Costa Rica: The lack of paved 
roads that most folks bemoan is a huge boon for mountain bikers. 
There are endless back roads and cattle paths to explore. Tours of 
differing lengths and all difficulty levels are available. The area 
around Lake Arenal and the Arenal volcano is a perfect place to 
ride some fat-track bikes. Contact Bike Arenal. See Chapter 18.
 
✓ Trying the sport of canyoning: A new and nonstandardized adven-
ture sport, canyoning usually involves hiking along and through the 
rivers and creeks of steep mountain canyons, with periodic breaks 
to rappel down the face of a waterfall, jump off a rock into a jungle 
pool, or float down a small rapid. Pure Trek Canyoning and 
Desafío Expeditions in La Fortuna, and Psycho Tours near Puerto 
Jiménez, are the prime operators. See Chapters 18 and 20.
 
✓ Kayaking around the Golfo Dulce: Slipping through the waters 
of the Golfo Dulce by kayak gets you intimately in touch with the 
raw beauty of this underdeveloped region. In addition to the open 
gulf waters where dolphins often frolic, Escondido Trex takes 
folks on trips into mangrove swamps and into river estuaries. See 
Chapter 20.

 Chapter 1: Discovering the Best of Costa Rica 17
The Best Family Spots
Costa Rica’s rugged reputation should not discourage family travel. Here 
are a few of the ample attractions and activities available to please tour-
ists of all ages, as well as some of the hotels, resorts, and destinations 
perfectly suited to family travel:
 
✓ La Paz Waterfall Gardens: This multifaceted attraction features 
paths and suspended walkways alongside a series of impressive 
jungle waterfalls. Kids love the variety of natural attractions, from 
the immense butterfly garden to the hummingbird garden. The 
rooms at the Peace Lodge here are some of the best in the country. 
See Chapter 12.
 
✓ Playa Tamarindo: This lively surf town has a bit of something for 
everyone. This is a great spot for teens to learn how to surf or boo-
gie-board, and there are a host of tours and activities to please the 
entire family. Hotel Capitán Suizo has an excellent location on a 
calm section of beach, spacious rooms, and a great pool for kids 
and adults alike. See Chapters 13 and 14.
 
✓ Manuel Antonio: Manuel Antonio has a little bit of everything: 
miles of gorgeous beaches, tons of wildlife (with monkey sightings 
almost guaranteed), and plenty of active tour options. Numerous 
lodging options are available, but Hotel Sí Como No with its large 
suites, two pools, water slide, and nightly movies, is probably your 
best bet. See Chapter 15.
 
✓ Playa Hermosa: The broad stretch of sand and protected waters of 
this Pacific beach make it a family favorite. However, just because 
the waters are calm doesn’t mean it’s boring here. I recommend 
staying at Hotel Playa Hermosa Bosque del Mar and checking in at 
Aqua Sport, where you can rent sea kayaks, sailboards, paddle-
boats, beach umbrellas, and bicycles. See Chapter 16.
 
✓ Monteverde: Monteverde not only boasts the country’s most 
famous cloud forest but also sports a wide variety of related attrac-
tions and activities. After hiking through the reserve, you should be 
able to keep most kids happy and occupied riding horses; squirm-
ing at the local serpentarium; or visiting the butterfly farm, frog 
pond, and hummingbird gallery. More adventurous families can 
take one of the local zip-line canopy tours. See Chapter 17.

Digging Deeper 
into Costa Rica
In This Chapter
▶ Discovering Costa Rica’s past
▶ Experiencing Costa Rican cuisine and the dining scene
▶ Finding additional background materials — in print and on film
T
his chapter gives you some handy background information and a 
glimpse into Tico (Costa Rican) culture, cuisine, and idiomatic idio-
syncrasies, so you can take better advantage of your time in this beauti-
ful country. I also recommend a list of excellent books, if you want to 
delve deeper into Costa Rica.
History 101: The Main Events
Costa Rica enjoyed thousands of years of human occupation before it 
was “discovered” by Christopher Columbus in 1502. Its history includes 
a civil war, the abolition of its standing army, and the building of a 
banana exporting empire. The country’s stability, adherence to the dem-
ocratic process, and the staunch position of neutrality are a source of 
great pride to Costa Ricans, who like to think of their country as the 
“Switzerland of Central America.”
The early years
Little is known of Costa Rica’s history before its colonization by Spanish 
settlers. The pre-Columbian Indians who made their home in this region 
of Central America never developed the large cities or advanced culture 
that flowered to the north and south. Still, ancient artifacts demonstrat-
ing a strong sense of aesthetics have been found at excavations around 
the country, primarily in the northwest. Beautiful gold and jade jewelry, 
intricately carved grinding stones, and artistically painted terra-cotta 
objects point to a small but highly skilled population.

 Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into Costa Rica 19
Colonizing Costa Rica
On his fourth and final voyage to the New World, in 1502, Christopher 
Columbus anchored just offshore from present-day Limón. Whether he 
actually gave the country its name is open to discussion, but it wasn’t 
long before the moniker took hold.
The early Spanish settlers found that, unlike the Indians farther north, 
the native population of Costa Rica was unwilling to submit to slavery. 
Despite their small numbers, scattered villages, and tribal differences, 
they fought back against the Spanish until they were overcome by supe-
rior firepower and European diseases. When the fighting was finished, 
however, very few Indians were left for the settlers to force into servi-
tude. The few settlers who braved this outpost were often forced to till 
their own lands, a situation unheard of in other parts of Central America. 
Costa Rica was nearly forgotten, as the Spanish crown looked elsewhere 
for riches to plunder and souls to convert.
It didn’t take long for Costa Rica’s few Spanish settlers to head for the 
hills, where they found rich volcanic soil and a climate that was less 
oppressive than in the lowlands. Cartago, the colony’s first capital, was 
founded in 1563, but it was not until the 1700s that additional cities were 
established in this agriculturally rich region. In the late 18th century, the 
first coffee plants were introduced. These plants thrived in the high-
lands, and Costa Rica had its first and foremost cash crop.
Staking out independence
In 1821, Spain granted independence to its colonies in Central America. 
Costa Rica joined with its neighbors to form the Central American 
Federation, but in 1838, it withdrew to form a new nation and pursue its 
own interests. By the mid-1800s, coffee was the country’s main export. 
Free land was given to anyone willing to plant coffee on it, and planta-
tion owners soon grew wealthy and powerful, creating Costa Rica’s first 
elite class. Coffee plantation owners were powerful enough to elect their 
own representatives to the presidency.
This period was a stormy one in Costa Rican history. In 1856, the coun-
try was invaded by William Walker, an ambitious Tennessee mercenary 
who, with the backing of U.S. President James Buchanan and prominent 
early industrialists, was attempting to fulfill his grandiose dreams of pre-
siding over a slave state in Central America. (Before his invasion of Costa 
Rica, he had invaded Nicaragua and Baja California.) The people of Costa 
Rica, led by their own president, Juan Rafael Mora, rose up against Walker 
and chased him back to Nicaragua. In 1860, Walker was defeated and cap-
tured for the last time in Honduras, where he was promptly executed.
In the 1870s, Costa Rica began construction of a railway from San José 
to the Caribbean coast, in order to facilitate the transport of coffee to 

Part I: Introducing Costa Rica 
20
European markets. It took nearly 20 years and cost more than 4,000 
workers their lives constructing the railway. Partway through the proj-
ect, as funds were dwindling, the second chief engineer, Minor Keith, 
proposed an idea that not only enhanced his fortunes but also changed 
the course of Central American history. Banana plantations would be 
developed along the railway right of way (land on either side of the 
tracks). The export of this crop would help to finance the railway, and, 
in exchange, Keith would get a 99-year lease on the land with a 20-year 
tax deferment. The Costa Rican government gave its consent, and, in 
1878, the first bananas were shipped from the country. In 1899, Keith 
and a partner formed the United Fruit Company, a business that eventu-
ally became the largest landholder in Central America and was the cause 
of political disputes and wars throughout the region.
Growing democracy in Central America
In 1889, Costa Rica held what is considered the first free election in 
Central American history. The opposition candidate won the election, 
and the control of the government passed from the hands of one politi-
cal party to those of another without bloodshed or hostilities. This pat-
tern of peaceful democracy continued for the next 60 years.
In 1948, however, Rafael Angel Calderón, who had served as the coun-
try’s president from 1940 to 1944, refused to concede the country’s lead-
ership to the rightfully elected president, Otillio Ulate. Civil war ensued. 
Calderón was defeated by forces led by José “Pepe” Figueres. Following 
the civil war, a new constitution was drafted; among other changes, it 
abolished Costa Rica’s army, so that such a revolution could never 
happen again.
In 1994, history seemed to repeat itself — peacefully this time — when 
José María Figueres took the reins of government from the son of his 
father’s adversary, Rafael Angel Calderón.
In 2001, the Partido Acción Ciudadana (Citizens’ Action Party, or PAC) 
forced the presidential elections into a second round, opening a crack in 
a two-party system that had become seemingly entrenched for good.
In 2004, major corruption scandals landed two former presidents, Miguel 
Angel Rodriguez and Rafael Angel Calderón, in jail; another, José Maria 
Figueres, remains abroad, avoiding calls for his return to face corruption 
allegations. These former presidents, as well as a long list of other high-
level government employees and deputies, are implicated in various 
financial scandals and bribery cases. However, justice moves slowly in 
Costa Rica, and at press time only Calderón had been brought to trial.
In 2006, former president Oscar Arias Sánchez, who is a Nobel Peace 
Prize laureate and was president during the mid-1980s, was reelected. 
The election was historic on two fronts. First, Arias needed to amend 
national law prohibiting reelection — it still prohibits consecutive terms. 
But, perhaps more important, runner-up Otton Solis’s upstart PAC, 

 Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into Costa Rica 21
which placed second by an extremely slim margin, forever changed a 
seemingly entrenched two-party system, which had shared governance 
of Costa Rica for decades.
The most dramatic event during the early years of Arias’s presidency 
was the October 2007 national referendum on whether to allow approval 
of a free trade agreement between Costa Rica and the United States and 
other Central American nations. That approval was passed by a very 
slim margin.
The global economic crisis of 2008 was slow to hit Costa Rica. Because 
credit here has historically been so tight, there was no major mortgage 
or banking crisis in the country. Still, early anecdotal reports show tour-
ism down substantially in 2009, and it’s unclear how profound an impact 
on the economy this and other global factors will have.
Building Blocks: Local Architecture
Costa Rica lacks the grand cities and distinctive Spanish-influenced 
architecture of other former Spanish colonial cities. You can still find 
some old examples of adobe buildings with high doorways and large 
windows, all topped with red tile roofs, especially in Liberia, Cartago, 
and some of the country’s older, smaller cities.
Modern Costa Rica is being overrun with strip malls and commercial 
centers and nondescript housing built of concrete block and other 
modern materials. Perhaps the most noticeable and striking architec-
tural feature you’ll find almost universally across the country is the use 
of metal grating over all exterior windows and doors. Unfortunately, 
though occasionally ornate, this metal grating is a direct response to 
rampant petty crime and theft.
A Taste of Costa Rica: Local Cuisine
Simply put, Costa Rican cuisine is unspectacular. Rice and beans are 
standard Tico fare and are often served at all three meals a day. Mixed 
together, they’re called gallo pinto. Either as gallo pinto, or served sepa-
rately, rice and beans are an integral part of most Costa Rican meals.
 
 If you’re looking for typical (and cheap) eats, you’ll find them in little 
restaurants known as sodas, which are the equivalent of diners in the 
United States. Your best bet at a soda is a casado (which translates as 
“married” and is the name for the local version of a blue-plate special). A 
casado usually consists of cabbage-and-tomato salad; fried plantains; 
and a chicken, fish, or meat dish of some sort. A casado also often comes 
with a hard-boiled egg and/or a slab of fresh cheese.
Costa Rica has two coasts, and, as you’d expect, plenty of seafood is 
available everywhere in the country. Corvina (sea bass) is the most 

Part I: Introducing Costa Rica 
22
commonly served fish. You’ll also come across pargo (red snapper), 
dorado (mahimahi), and atún (tuna) on most menus, especially along the 
coasts. Although Costa Rica is a major exporter of shrimp and lobster, 
both are less common and more expensive than you may expect.
 
 Corvina is one of my least favorite fish options. Costa Rican corvina is a 
distant cousin to the cold-water Chilean and other sea basses served in 
restaurants across the United States and Europe. In many cheaper res-
taurants, particularly in San José, shark meat is sometimes even sold as 
corvina. I highly recommend sticking with red snapper, mahimahi, and 
tuna, whenever possible.
Costa Rica is a major producer and exporter of beef. Unfortunately, 
quantity doesn’t mean quality. Unless you go to one of the better restau-
rants or steakhouses, you’ll probably be served rather tough steaks, cut 
rather thin.
Still, all is not lost. With an increase in international tourism, not to men-
tion the need to please more sophisticated palates, some local chefs 
have begun to create a “nouvelle Costa Rican cuisine,” updating time-
worn recipes and using traditional ingredients in creative ways. At many 
of the better hotels and local restaurants, you’ll find chefs doing inter-
esting and tasty things with the local fruits and vegetables and fresh sea-
food, meats, and poultry.
You can also get good international cuisine at a host of Italian, Peruvian, 
Mexican, Pan-Asian, and other restaurants across the country.
Getting the most out of eating in Costa Rica: 
Bocas and fresh fruit
Appetizers, known as bocas, are served with drinks in most bars. Often 
the bocas are free, but even if they aren’t, they’re very inexpensive. 
Popular bocas include gallos (tortillas piled with meat, chicken, cheese, 
or beans), ceviche (a marinated seafood salad), tamales (stuffed corn-
meal patties wrapped and steamed inside banana leaves), patacones 
(fried green plantain chips), and fried yuca. Tacos, tamales, and empana-
das (turnovers) also are quite common. Making an evening and a full 
meal out of a long list of bocas is easy and enjoyable.
Costa Rica has a wealth of delicious tropical fruits. The most common 
are mangoes (the season begins in May), papayas, pineapples, melons, 
and bananas. Other fruits include the marañón, which is the fruit of the 
cashew tree and has orange or yellow glossy skin; the granadilla, or mar-
acuyá (passion fruit); the mamón chino, which Asian travelers will imme-
diately recognize as the rambutan; and the carambola (star fruit).
All these fruits are readily available in markets across the country and 
are sold at roadside stands on most major highways and thoroughfares.

 Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into Costa Rica 23
Fresh fruits are also served in drinks made in a blender en agua (with 
water) or con leche (with milk). Named frescos, refrescos, or jugos natura-
les, these drinks are my favorites in Costa Rica. Among the more 
common fruits used are mangoes, papayas, blackberries (mora), and 
pineapples (piña); you’ll also come across passion fruit (maracuyá) and 
star fruit juices.
Enjoying a cup of joe
If you’re a coffee drinker, you may be surprisingly disappointed in Costa 
Rica. Most of the best coffee has traditionally been saved for export, and 
Ticos tend to prefer their coffee weak and sugary. The better hotels and 
restaurants cater to gringo and European tastes and serve up superior 
blends.
If you want black coffee, ask for café negro; if you want it with milk, order 
café con leche. Most restaurants serve the milk warmed and in a sepa-
rate container. If you want to ensure your milk comes separately, ask for 
con leche aparte. 
If you want to try something different for your morning beverage, ask for 
agua dulce, a warm drink made from melted sugar cane and served with 
milk or lemon, or straight.
A Word to the Wise: The Local Language
Spanish is the official language of Costa Rica. Most hotel and restaurant 
staff have some functional knowledge of English, and all guides and 
higher-level tourism workers speak respectable English.
Costa Rican Spanish is neither the easiest nor the most difficult dialect 
to understand. Costa Ricans speak at a relatively relaxed speed and tend 
to enunciate clearly, without dropping too many final consonants. The y 
and ll sounds are very subtly pronounced — almost inaudible. Perhaps 
the most defining idiosyncrasy of Costa Rican Spanish is the way Ticos 
have of overemphasizing — almost chewing — their r’s.
For a glossary of Costa Rican terms, see the Cheat Sheet in the front of 
this book, or check out Spanish For Dummies, by Susana Wald (Wiley 
Publishing).
 
 Throughout the book you’ll see the term Tico. This is the common local 
slang for a Costa Rican and, by inference, all things Costa Rican. The 
name comes from the Costa Rican habit of adding a diminutive suffix to 
the end of many words and phrases. Poquito becomes poquitico. Chiquito 
becomes chiquitico. A Costa Rican woman is a Tica. Never use the term 
Tican, though; it’s just wrong.

Background Check: Recommended Books 
and Movies
If you’re looking to find out more on Costa Rica, a wealth of excellent 
resources is available. In this section, I list some of my favorite books, as 
well as a couple of films you should check out to round out your under-
standing of Costa Rica.
Costa Rica on paper
A couple of the books mentioned in this section may be difficult to track 
down in U.S. bookstores, but you’ll find them all in abundance in Costa 
Rica. If you’re in San José, a good place to peruse is Seventh Street 
Books, on Calle 7 between avenidas 1 and Central (% 2256-8251).
For a readable look into Costa Rican society, check out The Ticos: 
Culture and Social Change, by Mavis Hiltunen Biesanz, Richard 
Biesanz, and Karen Zubris Biesanz (Lynne Rienner Publishers), an exam-
ination of the country’s politics and culture, by the authors of the out-of-
print The Costa Ricans.
Another good choice is The Costa Rica Reader: History, Culture, 
Politics, a broad selection of stories, essays, and excerpts edited by 
Steven Palmer and Iván Molina (Duke University Press).
To find out more about the life and culture of Costa Rica’s Talamanca 
coast, an area populated by Afro-Caribbean people whose forebears emi-
grated from Caribbean islands in the early 19th century, pick up a copy 
of What Happen: A Folk-History of Costa Rica’s Talamanca Coast, 
by Paula Palmer (Zona Tropical).
If you’re looking for literature, Costa Rica: A Traveler’s Literary 
Companion, edited by Barbara Ras, with a foreword by Oscar Arias 
(Whereabouts Press), is a collection of short stories by Costa Rican writ-
ers, organized by country regions. If you’re lucky, you may find and pick 
up a copy of Stories of Tatamundo, by Fabian Dobles (University of 
Costa Rica Press); this collection of short stories is based on the charac-
ter Tata Mundo, a rural peasant, who has come to embody and repre-
sent much of Costa Rica’s national identity, or at least the idealized 
version of that identity — simple, kind, open, joyful, and wise.
Young adults will enjoy Kristin Joy Pratt’s A Walk in the Rainforest 
(Dawn Publications), while younger children will like the beautifully 
illustrated The Forest in the Clouds, by Sneed B. Collard III and illus-
trated by Michael Rothman (Charlesbridge Publishing), and The 
Umbrella by Jan Brett (Putnam Juvenile).
Pachanga Kids (www.pachangakids.com) has published several illus-
trated bilingual children’s books with delightful illustrations by Ruth 
Angulo, including Mar Azucarada/Sugar Sea, by Roberto Boccanera, 

 Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into Costa Rica 25
and El Coyote y la Luciernaga/The Coyote and the Firefly, by Yazmin 
Ross, which (full disclosure) I translated, and which includes a musical 
CD that features your humble author’s singing.
A host of field guides are available for wildlife enthusiasts. Perhaps, the 
best all-around option is Costa Rica: Traveller’s Wildlife Guides, by 
Les Beletsky (Interlink Books). Most ecolodges have a copy or two of 
one of the major bird books. Still, avid bird-watchers will want to pick up 
a copy of A Guide to the Birds of Costa Rica, by F. Gary Stiles and 
Alexander Skutch (Cornell University Press), or the more recent Birds 
of Costa Rica, by Richard Garrigues and Robert Dean (Cornell 
University Press).
I think that everyone coming to Costa Rica should read Tropical 
Nature: Life and Death in the Rain Forests of Central and South 
America, by Adrian Forsyth and Ken Miyata, with a foreword by Dr. 
Thomas Lovejoy (Touchstone Books). My all-time favorite book on tropi-
cal biology, this is a wonderfully written and lively collection of tales and 
adventures by two Neotropical biologists who spent quite some time in 
the forests of Costa Rica.
Costa Rica on film
Be forewarned: Even though it is set in Costa Rica, Jurassic Park was not 
filmed here. For a glimpse of Costa Rica on film, you can check out 
Ridley Scott’s 1492, which was filmed here but is set in Hispaniola.
For films in which Costa Rica plays a more prominent role, you can look 
for The Blue Butterfly, starring William Hurt, or either of the small inde-
pendent films Tropix or Caribe, both of which were written, set, and shot 
in the country. The former is in English, while the latter is in Spanish.

A
lthough not an especially large country, Costa Rica offers a wealth 
of distinct destinations. Understanding a bit about the climate, as 
well as the geography, will help you choose where and when to go and 
how much to try to fit into your time here. In addition to giving you the 
lowdown on Costa Rican life during the distinct wet and dry seasons 
(which coincide nearly exactly with high and low tourism seasons) and 
a description of the different regions and the various attractions to be 
found around the country, this chapter also includes a calendar of 
events if you’d like to plan your visit around a particular activity.
Going Everywhere You Want to Be
Visitors to Costa Rica come for a variety of reasons. Some come to just 
crash on a beautiful beach and unwind, others want to experience the 
wonders of the tropical rain forests and cloud forests, and some come to 
partake in an adventure or two. Combining one or more of these options 
into a perfect and personalized vacation is easy.
But first you’ll want to know a little something about the country’s geog-
raphy and what each destination has to offer.
Seeking the center: San José and the Central Valley
Unless you’re flying in and out of Liberia, San José will serve as a default 
hub or transfer point. In many ways and for most visitors, San José is 
little more than a rough-and-tumble, overcrowded, Central American 
metropolis. The downtown area is a congested mess — for pedestrians 
and drivers alike. Sidewalks are poorly maintained and claustrophobic, 

 Chapter 3: Deciding Where and When to Go 27
and street crime is a problem. Most visitors quickly seek the sanctuary 
of their hotel rooms and the first chance to escape the city.
Still, San José is one of the most cosmopolitan cities in Central America, 
with several decent museums, some very good restaurants, and a hand-
ful of excellent hotel options.
San José also makes a great base for a variety of day trips and excursions. 
Within an hour or two, you can climb a volcano, go white-water rafting, 
hike through a cloud forest, and stroll through a butterfly garden — 
among many, many other activities.
San José sits in the center of the Valle Central (Central Valley). The cli-
mate is mild and springlike year-round, and this is Costa Rica’s primary 
agricultural region, with coffee farms making up the majority of land-
holdings. However, the Central Valley is also densely populated, contain-
ing three of the country’s largest cities: San José, Alajuela, and Heredia.
The rolling green hills and peaks that form the rim of this valley rise to 
heights between 900m and 1,200m (2,952–3,936 ft.) above sea level. Several 
of these are volcanoes, including Poás and Irazú, which are both active.
Going for gold in Guanacaste
Guanacaste province occupies the northwestern corner of Costa Rica. It 
is home to many of the country’s sunniest and most popular beaches 
and has earned its reputation as Costa Rica’s Gold Coast.
With about 165cm (65 in.) of rain a year, this region is by far the driest in 
the country and has been likened to west Texas, with much better 
beaches and more monkeys. Guanacaste province borders Nicaragua 
and is named after the shady trees that still shelter the herds of cattle 
that roam the dusty savanna here. In addition to the beaches and cattle 
ranches, Guanacaste boasts several volcanoes and one of the last rem-
nants of tropical dry forest left in Central America.
Guanacaste is the only place in Costa Rica where you’ll find several 
large-scale resort hotels. However, you’ll also find scores of excellent 
smaller beach resorts and hotels, and I list the best of each category in 
the chapters that follow. Guanacaste currently boasts four champion-
ship golf courses, and more are allegedly in the works.
 
 Guanacaste also has the country’s only other international airport, aside 
from San José. The number of direct flights and charters arriving here 
increases every year. If you want to spend your entire vacation in this 
area, be sure to book a direct flight into and out of Liberia.
Enjoying magnificent Manuel Antonio
Manuel Antonio is the name of a coastal national park, as well as the 
resort area that surrounds it. Many first-time visitors to Costa Rica plan 

Part I: Introducing Costa Rica 
28
their vacation around a visit here. The hills just outside the national 
park are covered in thick rain forest. The whole thing seems to gently 
tumble down to the sea. The views from these hills are spectacular, and 
the beaches are beautiful.
There’s no real town of Manuel Antonio. The closest thing is the small 
fishing and port city of Quepos. Between Quepos and the national park 
entrance runs a 7km (41⁄3-mile) stretch of narrow road that winds 
through the forested green hills here. Along this road, and in Quepos, 
you’ll find all the area’s hotels, restaurants, and shops.
However, Manuel Antonio’s popularity has brought with it more crowds 
and a growing sense of overdevelopment. On weekends, the beaches are 
filled with people, and the dance club near the park entrance blares its 
music until early morning.
Living the luxe life on the central Pacific coast
Costa Rica’s central Pacific coast lies relatively close to San José and 
is, for the most part, less developed than the northern province of 
Guanacaste. The beaches here are long, wide, and often nearly deserted. 
Most are backed by densely forested hills and mountains.
Although Manuel Antonio is the crown jewel of Costa Rica’s central 
Pacific coast, the nearby beaches to the north and south are beginning 
to come into their own.
To the north of Manuel Antonio, the beach towns of Jacó and Playa 
Herradura are two of the closest to San José. Jacó is a bustling surf town 
popular with itinerant surfers, foreign snowbirds, and young Ticos and 
Costa Rican families looking for a close and inexpensive getaway.
Playa Herradura is home to a large and luxurious Marriott resort, featur-
ing the area’s only 18-hole golf course. On the hills above Playa 
Herradura sits Villa Caletas, one of the country’s top boutique hotels.
Meanwhile, toward the southern end of this coast lies the funky little 
surfer town of Dominical, which is the gateway to Ballena National 
Marine Park and several barely discovered beautiful beaches.
Visiting the cloud forests of Monteverde
Monteverde sits high on the mountainous spine that runs down the 
center of Costa Rica. Monteverde translates as “green mountain,” and 
this is an area of lush and luxurious rain and cloud forests.
Cloud forests are a unique phenomenon. The mountaintops and forests 
of Monteverde are blanketed almost daily in dense clouds. For reasons 
that I explain in more detail in Chapter 17, this unique climatic phenome-
non forms an ecosystem that is incredibly rich in biodiversity. Within 
this small area are more than 2,500 species of plants, including 400 types 

 Chapter 3: Deciding Where and When to Go 29
of orchids, 400 species of birds (including the spectacular Resplendent 
Quetzal), and 100 different species of mammals.
The tiny villages of Santa Elena and Monteverde are gateways to the 
Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve. You won’t find any large resorts in 
Santa Elena or Monteverde. What you will find here are scores of small 
mountain lodges and ecolodges that run the gamut from decidedly 
rustic to nearly luxurious.
In addition to hiking and visiting the cloud forest, a host of activities are 
offered in the area, including horseback riding, canopy tours, ATV out-
ings, and canyoning.
Watching the lava flow from Arenal volcano
Rising to a near-perfect cone, Arenal volcano is Costa Rica’s most consis-
tently active and pyrotechnically impressive volcano. Volcano viewing is 
the major attraction and activity here, although there’s plenty more to do.
La Fortuna is a small rural town set at the foot of the volcano. La Fortuna 
has several hotels and is the base for most of the area’s tour and adven-
ture companies. From here, a road skirts along the edge of the base of 
the volcano heading toward Lake Arenal. You’ll find the best hotels and 
restaurants along this stretch of road.
Lake Arenal sits below the volcano and is the country’s largest body 
of fresh water. It’s a great spot for fishing and boating. During the 
winter months, it’s also a world-class and world-renowned windsurfing 
destination.
Also near the foot of the volcano are several beautiful and soothing hot 
springs, as well as the impressive La Fortuna waterfall. All around the 
lake and volcano are large expanses of rain forest and cloud forest, with 
ample opportunities for myriad tours and activities.
Because they’re both located in the north-central part of the country, 
combining a couple of days each at Monteverde and Arenal is easy and 
common.
Seeking solitude on the Nicoya Peninsula
South of Guanacaste lies the Nicoya Peninsula. Although this area is sim-
ilar in terms of geography and climate, and has nearly as many beautiful 
beaches, it’s much less developed and populated.
This is a great place to come for some solitude and a true sense of get-
ting away from it all. You’ll find several very lovely boutique hotels along 
the southern coasts of the Nicoya Peninsula.
The two main beach towns and vacation destinations in this area are 
Montezuma and Malpaís. Between them lies the Cabo Blanco Absolute 
Nature Reserve, Costa Rica’s oldest official nature reserve.

Part I: Introducing Costa Rica 
30
Montezuma is a long-standing beach destination popular with backpack-
ers and adventurous travelers. Montezuma sits just on the inside of the 
Golfo de Nicoya (Nicoya Gulf), and its beaches are relatively calm and 
protected. It also features two lovely waterfalls.
Malpaís, Santa Teresa, and a series of neighboring beaches are Costa 
Rica’s up-and-coming hot spots. Both Malpais and Santa Teresa boast 
long expanses of white-sand beaches backed by lush forests, and both 
are popular with surfers.
Farther north up the Nicoya Peninsula coast lies Punta Islita, one of the 
country’s most exclusive, isolated, boutique beach resorts.
Exploring southern Costa Rica
The hot, humid southern region of Costa Rica is remote and undevel-
oped. It’s characterized by dense rain forests and rugged coastlines. 
Much of the area is protected in Corcovado National Park, the largest 
single expanse of lowland tropical rain forest in Central America, and its 
nearby sister the Piedras Blancas National Park.
On the inside of the Osa Peninsula lies the Golfo Dulce, or “Sweet Gulf.” 
This large and beautiful body of water is a great place for fishing, kayak-
ing, and dolphin spotting.
Several wonderful remote ecolodges are spread around the shores of 
the Golfo Dulce and on the Osa Peninsula, bordering Corcovado National 
Park. Some people find the area solitary, but if you like your ecotourism 
raw, pure, and challenging, you’ll want to visit this region.
Chilling on the Caribbean coast
Most of the Caribbean coast is wide, steamy lowland laced with rivers 
and blanketed with rain forests and banana plantations. The culture 
here is predominantly Afro-Caribbean, with many residents speaking 
English or a Caribbean dialect as their first language. The northern sec-
tion of this coast is accessible only by boat or small plane and is home 
to Tortuguero National Park, which is known for its nesting sea turtles 
and riverboat trips through its network of jungle canals and lagoons.
The towns of Cahuita and Puerto Viejo, on the southern half of the 
Caribbean coast, are popular beach destinations. They’re home to, or 
close to, some of the best and least crowded beaches in the country. 
Small coral reefs also dot the coastlines off each town, giving this region 
some of the best snorkeling in Costa Rica.
No large resorts are yet to be found here, and although the towns of 
Cahuita and Puerto Viejo can bustle at times, this area is remote and iso-
lated and will really give you a sense of getting away from it all.

 Chapter 3: Deciding Where and When to Go 31
Scheduling Your Time
Although visiting several destinations during one trip is certainly possi-
ble, Costa Rica doesn’t lend itself well to stringing together, say, five des-
tinations in a week. If you want to visit several destinations, you have to 
factor in travel time. It takes four to eight hours to drive between San 
José and most popular destinations and approximately the same amount 
of time to drive between these different spots.
Commuter flights cut down the travel time considerably, but they add 
on cost and some logistical challenges because you often have to fly in 
and out of San José as a hub. So, if the flights don’t line up, you may end 
up adding an extra overnight in San José.
Many folks are content to spend a week or more at one resort, and this 
is a good option in Costa Rica, especially up in Guanacaste, where you 
can enjoy the comforts of a beach resort combined with the ability to 
take day trips that range from horseback rides near the Rincón de la 
Vieja volcano to rafting trips on the Corobicí River to sailboat outings, 
hikes, and canopy tours. A similar amount of activities and tour options 
are available in Manuel Antonio and, to a slightly lesser extent, from the 
remote ecolodges of the Osa Peninsula.
If you’re looking for some unadulterated beach time and plenty of sun 
and fun, Guanacaste is often your best choice. If you want to mix your 
beach time with a bit more adventure and a trip into the rain forest, 
Manuel Antonio is a great option.
For a more intense exploration of the tropical rain forests and cloud 
forests, you should visit one or more of the following destinations: 
Monteverde, the Osa Peninsula and Golfo Dulce, or Tortuguero.
For a simple loop that hits three major and distinct destinations, I 
always recommend that folks head straight for La Fortuna and the 
Arenal volcano, then head over to Monteverde, and finish by dropping 
down to the coast at Manuel Antonio.
In Chapter 4, I outline several possible itineraries to help you plan the 
perfect trip to Costa Rica, given your particular interests, budget, and 
time constraints.
Revealing the Secrets of the Seasons
Costa Rica’s high season runs from mid-December to late April, which 
coincides almost perfectly with the chill of winter in the United States, 
Canada, and Europe. The high season also coincides almost perfectly 
with the country’s dry season. If you want some unadulterated time on a 

Part I: Introducing Costa Rica 
32
tropical beach and less rain during your rain-forest experience, this is the 
time to come. During this period (and especially around the Christmas 
holidays), tourism is in full swing — prices are higher, attractions are 
more crowded, and reservations need to be made in advance.
In order to drum up business during the rainy season, locals sometimes 
refer to it as the green season. The adjective is appropriate. At this time 
of year, even brown and barren Guanacaste becomes lush and verdant. 
I love traveling around Costa Rica during the rainy season (but then 
again, I’m not trying to flee winter in Chicago); finding (or at least negoti-
ating) reduced rates is easy, there are far fewer fellow travelers, and the 
rain is often limited to a few hours each afternoon (although you can 
occasionally get socked in for a week at a time).
Understanding Costa Rica’s climate
Costa Rica is a tropical country with distinct wet and dry seasons. 
However, some regions receive rain all year, and others are very dry and 
sunny for most of the year. Temperatures in Costa Rica are rarely as 
extreme. The average annual daytime temperature for much of the coun-
try ranges between 71°F and 81°F (22°C–27°C). Moreover, temperatures 
vary primarily with elevation, not with seasons: On the coasts, it’s hot 
all year, with daytime temperatures hovering between 90°F and 96°F 
(32°C–36°C). But up in the mountains, it can be cool at night any time of 
year, with temperatures dipping into the mid-60s (15°C–17°C). At the 
highest elevations (3,000–3,600m/9,840–11,808 ft.), frost is common.
The dry season, considered summer by Costa Ricans, is from mid-
November to April. In Guanacaste, the dry northwestern province, the 
dry season lasts several weeks longer than in other places. Even in the 
rainy season, days often start sunny, with rain falling in the afternoon 
and evening. The wet or rainy season (or green season) is from May to 
mid-November. Costa Ricans call this time of year their winter.
 
 For most of the wet season, the rains are often limited to a brief but sub-
stantial downpour during the late afternoon. However, from mid-August 
through October, the rain can be hard, heavy, and seemingly relentless 
for long stretches.
In general, the best time of year to visit weather-wise is in December and 
early January, when everything is still green from the rains, but the sky 
is clear.
Costa Rica’s Caribbean coast breaks all the rules mentioned in this section. 
It can rain pretty much any time of the year here. However, the one semi-
dependable period, when the Caribbean coast often enjoys clear skies and 
calm seas, is between mid-September and late October, when the rest of 
the country is experiencing some of the worst effects of the rainy season.
 
 Some of the country’s rugged dirt roads become downright impassable 
without four-wheel-drive during the rainy season.

 Chapter 3: Deciding Where and When to Go 33
Avoiding the crowds
 
 Keep in mind that tourism in Costa Rica peaks during the Christmas holi-
days, spring break, and Easter week. Stay at home during these seasons 
if you don’t want to fight crowds and pay top dollar. However, you’ll gen-
erally get good weather, uncrowded beaches and resorts, and decent 
price breaks, if you visit from late April through early June, or from late 
November through mid-December.
Perusing a Calendar of Events
Some of the events listed here may be considered more of a happening 
than a well-organized event — there’s not, for instance, a Virgin of 
Los Angeles PR committee that readily dispenses information. If I 
haven’t listed a contact number, your best bet is to call the Costa 
Rican Tourist Board (Instituto Costarricense de Turismo, or ICT) at 
% 800-343-6332 in the United States, 2223-1733 in Costa Rica, or visit 
www.visitcostarica.com.
January
Some of the best young tennis players from around the region and 
around the world come to San José and the Copa del Café (Coffee Cup). 
Matches are held at the Costa Rica Country Club (% 2228-9333). First 
week in January.
March
Orchid growers throughout the world gather to show their wares, trade 
tales and secrets, and admire the hundreds of species on display at the 
National Orchid Show. The show takes place at a different venue each 
year in the Central Valley. Contact the Costa Rican Tourist Board for 
precise location and dates.
April
Costa Rica is a predominantly Roman Catholic country and Holy Week 
is celebrated with fervor. Religious processions are held in cities and 
towns throughout the country. The week before Easter.
July
Annexation of Guanacaste Day is celebrated each year in Liberia with 
Tico-style bullfights, folk dancing, horseback parades, rodeos, concerts, 
and other events. On and around July 25.
August
Over 100,000 people make the annual pilgrimage from San José to the 
basilica in Cartago every year in honor of the Fiesta of the Virgin of Los 

Part I: Introducing Costa Rica 
34
Angeles. Even those who don’t make the 24km (15-mile) trek take the 
day off to honor the country’s virgin saint. August 2.
September
School children across the country take to the streets in marching 
bands heavy on xylophones and snare drums to celebrate Costa Rica’s 
Independence Day. Many of the parades are nighttime affairs, replete 
with fireworks. September 15.
If you’re visiting Costa Rica this time of year, International Coastal 
Cleanup Day is a good excuse to chip in and help clean up the Costa 
Rican shoreline. Third Saturday of September.
October
Limón’s Carnaval, or Día de la Raza, is a miniature Mardi Gras, com-
plete with floats and dancing in the streets, which commemorates 
Columbus’s dropping anchor off this Caribbean port city in 1502. The 
weekend closest to October 12.
December
The streets of downtown San José belong to horses and their riders 
for El Tope, each December 26. The next day, those same streets are 
taken over by carnival floats, marching bands, and street dancers, for 
Carnaval.
Costa Rican bullfights and a hodgepodge of carnival rides, games of 
chance, and fast-food stands are set up at the fairgrounds in Zapote, a 
San José neighborhood. The Festejos Populares (Popular Fiestas) are a 
rowdy and raucous affair. Last week in December.

osta Rica boasts a veritable bounty of things to see and do. You can 
use the following itineraries as precise guides or as rough outlines 
to help you structure your time and plan your trip.
Seeing Costa Rica’s Highlights in One Week
The timing is tight, but this itinerary packs a lot into a weeklong 
vacation.
Day 1
Arrive and get settled in San José. If you have time, visit the Centro 
Nacional de Arte y Cultura (National Arts and Culture Center), the 
Museo de Oro Banco Central (Gold Museum), and/or the Teatro 
Nacional (National Theater). Have dinner at Café Mundo in Barrio 
Amón. See Chapters 11 and 12.
Day 2
Rent a car and head to the Arenal volcano. Settle into your hotel and 
spend the afternoon at the hot springs of the Tabacón Grand Spa 
Thermal Resort, working out the kinks from the road. In the evening, 
either sign up for a volcano-watching tour or view it yourself (from the 
comfort of your hotel room balcony or from one of the better volcano-
viewing spots I lay out for you in Chapter 18).
Day 3
Spend the morning doing something adventurous, such as white-water 
rafting, mountain-biking, canyoning, or horseback-riding and then 

Part I: Introducing Costa Rica 
36
hiking to the La Fortuna waterfall. Make sure you give yourself at 
least four hours of daylight, though, to drive around Lake Arenal to 
Monteverde. Stop to shop for gifts, artwork, and souvenirs at the Lucky 
Bug Gallery, which is located just outside of Nuevo Arenal. After you get 
to Monteverde, settle into your hotel and head for a sunset drink at El 
Sapo Dorado. See Chapters 17 and 18.
Day 4
Wake up early and take a guided tour of the Monteverde Cloud Forest 
Reserve. Be sure to stop in at the Hummingbird Gallery next-door to 
the entrance after your tour. Spend the afternoon visiting several of the 
area’s attractions, which include the Butterfly Garden, Bat Jungle, 
Orchid Garden, Monteverde Serpentarium, Frog Pond of Monteverde, 
and World of Insects. See Chapter 17.
Day 5
Use the morning to take one of the zip-line canopy tours here, but be 
sure to schedule it early enough that you can hit the road by noon for 
your drive to Manuel Antonio. Settle into your hotel and head for a 
sunset drink at one of the several roadside restaurants with spectacular 
views over the rain forest to the sea. You can drop off your car at any

point now and just rely on taxis and tours. Adobe, Alamo, Economy, 
Hertz, National, and Payless all have offices in downtown Quepos, but 
check with your car-rental company in advance about any drop-off fees. 
See Chapter 15.
Day 6
In the morning, take a boat tour of the Damas Island Estuary, and then 
reward yourself for all this hard touring with an afternoon lazing on one 
of the beautiful beaches inside Manuel Antonio National Park. If you 
just can’t lie still, be sure to hike the loop trail through the rain forest 
here and around Cathedral Point. See Chapter 15.
Day 7
Fly back to San José in time to connect with your departing flight home.
Touring the Best of Costa Rica in Two Weeks
If you have two weeks, you’ll be able to hit all the highlights mentioned 
in the preceding section and more, all at a more relaxed pace, to boot.
 
 It’s a real judgment call, but you may want to substitute a two- to three-
day trip to Tortuguero for either the Guanacaste or southern zone sec-
tion listed here, or whittle down a day here or there along the way in 
order to squeeze in Tortuguero.
Days 1 and 2
Spend these days the same as you would in days 1 and 2 of “Seeing 
Costa Rica’s Highlights in One Week,” earlier in this chapter.
Day 3
Spend the morning doing something adventurous, such as white-water 
rafting, mountain biking, canyoning, or horseback riding and then 
hiking to the La Fortuna waterfall. If you’re really active, you can sched-
ule a second adventure for the afternoon or simply take some time to 
stroll around the little town of La Fortuna. In the evening, return to the 
Hot Springs, spend more time watching the volcano, or combine both. 
See Chapters 17 and 18.
Day 4
Drive around Lake Arenal to Monteverde. Stop to shop for gifts, art-
work, and souvenirs at Casa Delagua and the Lucky Bug Gallery, both 
of which are located on the road between Tabacón and Tilaran. After 
you get to Monteverde, settle into your hotel and head to El Sapo 
Dorado for a sunset drink. See Chapters 17 and 18.

of the beautiful beaches inside Manuel Antonio National Park. If you 
just can’t lie still, be sure to hike the loop trail through the rain forest 
here and around Cathedral Point. See Chapters 15 and 16.
Days 8, 9, and 10
Fly from Quepos and Manuel Antonio to Golfito, Puerto Jiménez, or 
Drake Bay, and settle into one of the remote ecolodges of the southern 
zone. You’ll need these three days to really experience the many natural 
wonders of this region. Aside from hiking in the rain forest, you’ll be 
able to take scuba or snorkel outings, sportfishing trips, kayak adven-
tures, and surfing lessons. See Chapter 20.
Days 11, 12, and 13
You’ve had enough nature and adventure — it’s time to enjoy some 
pampering. From the southern zone, fly straight up to Guanacaste and 
spend your final days enjoying the pleasures of one of Costa Rica’s Gold 
Coast beaches. If just lying on the beach or poolside is too mellow, you 
can take advantage of the scores of tour and activity options. Otherwise, 
break out that novel you’ve been too busy to open, and enjoy. See 
Chapters 13 and 14.
Day 14
Fly back to San José in time to connect with your departing flight home.
Discovering Costa Rica with Kids
Costa Rica is becoming a more kid-friendly destination every year. Still, 
very few attractions or activities are geared toward the very young, and 
the country has precious few resorts with well-developed children’s pro-
grams. Youngsters and teens, especially those with strong adventurous 
and inquisitive traits, will do great here.
 
 The biggest challenges for families traveling with children are travel dis-
tances and the time it takes to move around within the country, which is 
why I recommend flying in and out of Liberia, and basing yourself in 
Guanacaste. The Guanacaste area is ripe with activities, adventures, and 
attractions for the entire family. And everyone will enjoy the fact that 
this option drastically cuts down on travel time.
Day 1
Fly into Liberia. From here, it’s a 30- to 45-minute drive to any of the 
many area beach resorts. I recommend either the Four Seasons or the 
Hilton Papagayo. Both have excellent children’s programs, as well as 
tons of activity and tour options. See Chapter 13.

Part I: Introducing Costa Rica 
40
Day 2
Get to know and enjoy the facilities and activities offered up at your 
hotel or resort. Check out the children’s program and any scheduled 
activities or tours that particularly appeal to anyone in your family. Feel 
free to adapt the following days’ suggestions accordingly. See Chapters 
13 and 14.
Day 3
The entire family will enjoy a rafting tour on the gentle Corobicí River. 
This trip is appropriate for all ages except infants. There’ll be plenty of 
opportunities to watch birds and other wildlife along the way. If you 
schedule this properly, you can combine it with a visit to Africa Mia, an 
African-themed open-air animal park. See Chapter 14.
Day 4
Drop off the kids with the children’s program at your hotel or resort for 
at least one full day, and treat yourselves to a sailboat cruise. You’ll 
spend some time cruising the coast, take a break or two to snorkel, and 
probably stop for lunch at a deserted beach. See Chapter 14.

Day 5
It’s time to head for the hills, which are mostly volcanoes in this neck of 
the woods. Book a full-day outing to Hacienda Guachipilin, near the 
Rincón de la Vieja volcano. Older and more adventurous children can 
sign up for a horseback ride or canopy tour. Younger children should 
get a kick out of visiting this working farm and cattle ranch. See Chapter 14.
Day 6
Use this day to satisfy any lingering whims. Some will want to just laze 
on the beach or by the pool. Others may want to try a surf or boogie-
board lesson. If the kids feel left out, taking the whole brood out on a 
boat may be a good idea. You won’t want for options. See Chapter 14.
Day 7
Use any spare time you have before your flight to buy last-minute souve-
nirs at your resort or in town, or just laze on the beach or by the pool. 
Fly home out of Liberia.
Having a High-Octane Week of Adventures
Costa Rica is a major adventure-tourism destination. Adventure opportuni-
ties range from white-water rafting and kayaking to zip-line canopy tours 
and canyoning adventures. The following itinerary packs a lot of punch 
into one week but doesn’t even scratch the surface. You can also find 
excellent mountain biking, windsurfing, kiteboarding, and sportfishing. Feel 
free to modify the following itinerary to include any of these activities.
Day 1
Arrive and get settled in San José. If you have time, visit the Centro 
Nacional de Arte y Cultura (National Arts and Culture Center), the 
Museo de Oro Banco Central (Gold Museum), and/or the Teatro 
Nacional (National Theater). See Chapter 12.
Day 2
Begin a two-day white-water rafting expedition on the Pacuare River, 
and then camp out at a rustic lodge on the river’s edge. See Chapter 12.
Day 3
Finish running the Pacuare River, and arrange for a transfer to La Fortuna 
at the end of your rafting trip. Settle into your hotel and head to the hot 
springs at the Tabacón Grand Spa Thermal Resort for a soothing soak 
and to watch the volcano. See Chapter 18.

Part I: Introducing Costa Rica 
42
Day 4
Go canyoning with Pure Trek Canyoning in the morning, and then hop 
on some horses or mountain bikes in the afternoon and be sure to stop 
at the La Fortuna Waterfall. Take the short hike down to the base of the 
falls, and take a dip in one of the pools there. See Chapter 18.
Day 5
Arrange a taxi-to-boat-to-horse transfer over to Monteverde. Settle in 
quickly at your hotel and take a zip-line canopy tour in the afternoon. 
See Chapter 17.
Day 6
Wake up early and take a guided tour of the Monteverde Cloud Forest 
Reserve. Be sure to bring a packed lunch. After the guided tour, spend 
the next few hours continuing to explore the trails through the cloud 
forest here. See if you can spot a Quetzal on your own. Take a late-after-
noon bus or transfer back to San José. See Chapter 17.
Day 7
Unfortunately, you’ll most likely be on an early flight home from San 
José. If you have a few hours to kill, head for a hike or jog around the La

Getting the Most out of a 
Week on the Gold Coast
Face it, for many people, the idea of touring around from place to place 
and checking in and out of a different hotel every day or two is just too 
much work for a vacation.
If you want to be able to settle into one hotel or resort, yet still have an 
adventure-packed, fun, and relaxing vacation, the following itinerary 
should be right up your alley.
Day 1
Fly into Liberia. From here it’s a 30- to 45-minute drive to any of the 
area’s many beach resorts. Choose one according to your budget, 
making sure to plan on taking a variety of tours during your stay. Check 
into your hotel, and use the rest of the day to unwind and shake off the 
weariness of travel. See Chapter 13.
Day 2
Get to know and enjoy the facilities and activities offered up at your 
hotel or resort. Take advantage of any free classes or water-sports 
equipment, and be sure to take a nice long walk on the beach. If your 
hotel is near a town, spend the afternoon exploring the local scene, and 
scope out a good spot for a sunset drink. See Chapter 13.
Day 3
It’s time to head for the hills, which are mostly volcanoes in this neck of 
the woods. Book a full-day outing to the Rincón de la Vieja volcano. Be 
sure to hike the short loop trail around the bubbling mud pots here, and 
sign on for either a horseback ride or canopy tour. See Chapter 14.
Day 4
Shopping options are very limited in Costa Rica, but one of the most 
interesting outings is to the small Guanacaste village of Guaitil, where 
the locals have developed a unique ceramic style, using local mud, dyes, 
and wood-burning kilns. In the afternoon, rent a scooter and explore 
some of the other beaches near your resort. See Chapter 14.
Day 5
Take a rafting trip on the gentle Corobicí River. You’ll have plenty of 
opportunities to watch birds and other wildlife on this outing. If it’s 

Part I: Introducing Costa Rica 
44
turtle nesting season, take a night tour to Playa Grande to see the giant 
leatherback turtles nest. See Chapter 14.
Day 6
You’re at the ocean, so take advantage of it. Book a sailing tour, sport-
fishing outing, or surf lesson, or just laze on the beach or by the pool. 
See Chapter 14.
Day 7
Use any spare time you have before your flight home from Liberia to buy 
last-minute souvenirs, or continue to laze on the beach or by the pool. 
See Chapter 13.

In This Chapter
▶ Planning a budget
▶ Solving the mystery of the colón
▶ Zeroing in on cost-cutting tips
“S
o, how much is this trip to Costa Rica going to cost me, 
anyway?” is an important question, and one you’ll want to 
address before packing your bags. As far as destinations go, Costa Rica 
is neither a budget hound’s paradise nor a break-the-bank budget killer. 
In fact, you can tailor your vacation to meet just about any budget here. 
Although bargains can be found, and moderately prices hotels and 
resorts abound, there are also plenty of places to lap up the luxury.
In this chapter, I tell you how much things cost and offer you tips that 
can help you save big on some of the major expenses.
Planning Your Budget
With a little planning, mapping out a trip to Costa Rica to fit any budget 
is easy. Airfare and hotels will probably end up being your largest cash 
outlays. Other things, like rental cars and dining, are relatively inexpen-
sive in Costa Rica.
Your choice of activities will also determine how much you spend: 
Relaxing on the beach and taking self-guided hikes in one of Costa Rica’s 
national parks are both easy on the wallet. But guided tours and orga-
nized activities — such as white-water rafting trips, sportfishing outings, 
and zip-line canopy tours — can quickly add substantial costs to your 
vacation (see Table 5-1).

Transportation
The cost of your flight to Costa Rica will be one of your major expenses, 
especially during the high season. Airfares are almost impossible to 
predict and can change at the drop of a hat. Still, to give you an idea of 
what to expect, here’s a sampling of potential fares from season to 
season: If you’re going to Costa Rica in the off season — say, May or any-
time between September and November — you may be able to snag a 
round-trip ticket for as little as $400 or $450 from any major U.S. hub. If 
you’re traveling in the high season (late Dec–Apr, July–Aug), you’ll pay 
more — probably in the $500 to $800 range.

 Chapter 5: Managing Your Money 49
Expect to pay a little more if you’re departing from a city that’s not a 
major airline hub. If you’re traveling to Costa Rica over the Christmas 
holidays or during other peak periods, expect to pay full fare. After you 
get to Costa Rica, your in-country transportation costs should be low.
 
 You can score any number of money-saving deals, especially if you con-
sider an all-inclusive package. See Chapter 6 for more details on travel 
packages. I also tell you how to save on airfares in that chapter.
Internal Costa Rican flights
Many popular destinations inside Costa Rica are a four- to eight-hour 
drive from San José. Luckily, the country is served by a dependable net-
work of internal commuter flights. One-way fares from San José to most 
other destinations run from $75 to $120. See Chapter 7 for details.
Rental cars
Rental cars are relatively inexpensive in Costa Rica. You can often get a 
compact for as little as $35 to $45 a day, or even less if you visit during 
the off season. If you need a larger car, or a four-wheel-drive vehicle, 
expect to pay more like $60 to $90 per day. Weekly rates almost always 
save you a bundle.
Because driving distances to most destinations are substantial, don’t 
forget to factor in the cost of gas. Currently, a liter of premium gas costs 
435 colones, or roughly $2.95 per gallon.
 
 You’ll seldom save by waiting to rent your car; generally, prices only go 
up as your pickup date approaches — especially in the busy travel sea-
sons. Book as far in advance as possible for the best rate. Also, see 
“Cutting Costs — But Not the Fun,” later in this chapter, as well as 
Chapter 7, for additional money-saving tips.
Lodging
Although Costa Rica has a few luxury resorts and several excellent high-
end boutique hotels, its strong suit is affordable small to midsize hotels. 
Real budget hounds will have no problem finding clean and comfortable 
accommodations for under $75 per night. The best deals, though, can be 
found in the per-night range of $80 to $140.
In this book, I recommend a range of lodging choices in each destination 
to suit just about any budget. I also include many helpful tips on how to 
save money, regardless of your budget. For one thing, booking a package 
deal can be a huge money saver when it comes to hotels. For more infor-
mation on packages, see Chapter 6. For additional cost-cutting mea-
sures, see “Cutting Costs — But Not the Fun,” later in this chapter.
 
 So that you don’t encounter any unwanted surprises at checkout time, 
be sure to account for the 13 percent in taxes that will be added to your 
final hotel bill when planning your budget.

Dining
As tourism has boomed, dining options and quality have improved dra-
matically in Costa Rica. What’s more, prices remain relatively low to 
downright cheap when compared to those found in the United States 
and Europe.
Even at some of the best restaurants in Costa Rica, main dishes rarely 
cost over $20, and most average between $10 and $15. Things get much 
more affordable at the local Tico restaurants, where full meals can often 
be had for under $7.
At any of the beach destinations, fresh seafood is plentiful and cheap. A 
grilled whole snapper should run you only $10 to $15 at most seaside 
restaurants.
 
 If you’re staying in one spot for an extended stay, a good way to save on 
dining expenses is to book a room with a kitchenette. Kitchen facilities 
are a virtual must if you’re traveling with kids.
Sightseeing
This is an area where you have to budget carefully. Most of the tours 
and activities in Costa Rica require an individual guide or guided tour. 
Options include guided hikes through the rain forests or cloud forests, 
white-water rafting tours, sail and snorkel outings, and zip-line canopy 
tours. Rates on these range from $30 to $55 for a half-day outing, to $60 
to $120 for full-day tours.
Other popular attractions found at various destinations include butterfly 
farms, serpentariums, and botanical gardens. Admission fees to these 
attractions run from $5 to $15 per person. Admission to most national 
parks costs $10, although there are a few exceptions, with the actual 
range running from $6 to $15.
The only real museums in the country are found in San José, and admis-
sion to these is generally between $3 and $8.
This book lists exact prices for activities, entertainment, admission fees, 
and the like, so you can budget your money realistically. If there’s a way 
to land a bargain, I include that information, too.
Shopping and nightlife
These two areas are the most flexible parts of your budget. Your shop-
ping options will be very limited in Costa Rica. Most of what you’ll be 
able to buy are simple souvenirs and inexpensive handcrafts.
Costa Rica also has very limited nightlife options. There are virtually no 
major shows or theaters to tempt you. And tickets to those shows are 
very inexpensive, in any case. Most bars and dance clubs charge a very 
modest admission fee, or none at all.

 Chapter 5: Managing Your Money 51
Cutting Costs — But Not the Fun
I don’t care how much money you have — you don’t want to spend more 
than you have to. In this section, I give you some tips on how to avoid 
spending more of your hard-earned cash than is necessary.
Getting the best airfares
Getting the best airfare to Costa Rica is such a huge topic that I dedicate 
the better part of a chapter to it. Before you even start scanning for 
fares, see Chapter 6. That chapter also discusses how to find money-
saving package deals.
Avoiding paying full price for your hotel room
A huge gap often exists between hotels’ official rack rates (the published, 
full-price rates) and what you actually pay, so don’t be scared off at first 
glance. What’s more, savvy travelers can find ways to further widen the 
margin.
 
 The best way to avoid paying the full rack rate when booking your hotel 
is stunningly simple: Book directly with the hotel and ask for a cheaper 
or discounted rate. You may be pleasantly surprised — I have been, many 
times. Remember: Hotels sell the majority of their rooms for far below 
their rack rates. Moreover, they’re accustomed to paying travel agents 
and wholesalers hefty commissions. If you book directly, they’re saving 
that commission (as much as 30 percent). But you have to take the initia-
tive and ask because no one is going to volunteer to save you money.
 
 Here are a few more potentially money-saving tips on hotels:
 
✓ Rates are generally lowest in spring and fall. The time of year you 
decide to visit may affect your bargaining power more than any-
thing else. During the peak seasons — basically mid-December 
through mid-April and throughout the summer — demand is high 
and hotels are less likely to offer discounted rates. In the slower 
seasons — generally mid-April through mid-June and September 
through mid-December — when demand is down, they’re often 
very willing to negotiate. In fact, many places drop rates by 10 per-
cent to 30 percent automatically in the less-busy times of year. (If 
you haven’t decided when you want to visit Costa Rica yet, see 
Chapter 3.)
 
✓ Inquire about the hotel’s own package deals. Even if you’re not 
traveling on an all-inclusive package (see Chapter 6), you may be 
able to take advantage of packages offered by hotels, resorts, and 
condos directly. Properties often list these deals on their Web 
sites, but not always, so it never hurts to ask additional questions 
about available specials.
 
✓ If you’re booking a hotel that belongs to a chain, contact the 
hotel directly in addition to going through central reservations. 

Part II: Planning Your Trip to Costa Rica 
52
See which one gives you the better deal. Sometimes, the local res-
ervationist knows about packages or special rates, but the hotel 
may neglect to tell the central booking line.
 
✓ Reserve a hotel room with a kitchenette, or a condo with a full 
kitchen, and do your own cooking. You may miss the pampering 
that room service provides, but you can save lots of money. Even if 
you prepare only breakfast and an occasional picnic lunch in the 
kitchen, you’ll save significantly in the long run. Plus, if the beach is 
right outside your door, you won’t ever have to leave it to go on 
restaurant runs.
 
✓ Surf the Web to save. A surprising number of hotels advertise 
great packages via their Web sites, and some even offer Internet-
only special rates. In addition to surfing the hotel’s own sites, you 
may want to try using a general travel-booking site such as Expedia 
(www.expedia.com), Hotels.com, Orbitz (www.orbitz.com), or 
Travelocity (www.travelocity.com) to book your hotel or a pay-
one-price package that also includes airfare. Acting much like air-
line consolidators, these sites can sometimes offer big discounts on 
rooms as well. See Chapter 8 for a more complete discussion of 
how to use the Web to find a great hotel bargain.
Cutting other costs
 
 Here are a few more useful money-saving tips:
 
✓ Surf the Web to save on your rental car. In addition to surfing 
car-rental agencies’ own sites, you may want to try comparing 
rates through a general travel booking site such as Expedia.com, 
Travelocity.com, Orbitz.com, or Sidestep.com. This one-stop-
shopping method can save you more than money — it can save 
you time, too.
 
✓ Travel midweek. If you can travel on a Tuesday, Wednesday, 
or Thursday, you may find cheaper flights to your destination. 
When you ask about airfares, see if you can get a cheaper rate by 
flying on a different day. For more tips on getting a good fare, see 
Chapter 6.
 
✓ Reserve a room with a refrigerator and coffeemaker. You don’t 
have to slave over a hot stove to cut a few costs; many hotels have 
minifridges and coffeemakers. Buying supplies for breakfast will 
save you money — and probably calories.
 
✓ Always ask for discount rates. Membership in AAA, frequent-flier 
plans, trade unions, AARP, or other groups may qualify you for sav-
ings on rental cars, plane tickets, hotel rooms, and even meals. Ask 
about everything; you may be pleasantly surprised.

 Chapter 5: Managing Your Money 53
Handling Money
You’re the best judge of how much cash you feel comfortable carrying 
or what alternative form of currency is your favorite. That’s not going to 
change much on your vacation. True, you’ll probably be moving around 
more and incurring more expenses than you generally do (unless you 
happen to eat out every meal when you’re at home), and you may let 
your mind slip into vacation gear and not be as vigilant about your 
safety as when you’re in work mode. But, those factors aside, the only 
type of payment that won’t be quite as available to you away from home 
is your personal checkbook.
Unlocking the mystery of the colón
The unit of currency in Costa Rica is the colón. In mid-2009, there were 
approximately 560 colones to the U.S. dollar, but because the colón is in 
a constant state of devaluation, you can expect this rate to change. 
Because of this devaluation and accompanying inflation, this book lists 
prices in U.S. dollars. To check the very latest exchange rates before you 
leave home, point your browser to www.xe.com/ucc.
There are paper notes in denominations of 1,000; 2,000; 5,000; and 10,000 
colones. Currently, two types of coins are in circulation. The older and 
larger nickel-alloy coins come in denominations of 5, 10, and 20 colones. 
There are even smaller denominations, but because of their evaporating 
value, you’ll probably never see or have to handle them. In 1997, the 
government introduced gold-hued 5-, 10-, 25-, 50-, 100-, and 500-colón 
coins. They’re smaller and heavier than the older coins, and the govern-
ment is supposed to eventually phase out the other currency, although 
that plan has seemingly stalled. See Table 5-2 for currency conversions 
for the colón, U.S. dollars, Euro, and British pound.

 You’ll hear people refer to a rojo or tucán, which are slang terms for the 
1,000- and 5,000-colón bills, respectively. One-hundred-colón denomina-
tions are called tejas, so cinco tejas is 500 colones.
Exchanging money
If you fly into the Juan Santamaria International Airport in San José, 
you’ll find a Global Exchange money-exchange booth just as you clear 
customs and immigration. However, these folks shave a good 10 percent 
off the official bank rate.
Several ATMs are available at the airport, including one inside the 
baggage-claim area. These will give you the current official bank 
exchange rate. However, the local machines charge between $1 and $2 
per transaction, and, depending upon your card, bank, and type of 
account, you may face an additional charge from your home bank.
You can also change money at any bank in Costa Rica. I recommend the 
many private banks over the more cumbersome and crowded state-run 
banks.
Hotels will often exchange money and cash traveler’s checks as well; 
there usually isn’t much of a line, but they’ll almost invariably give a less 
favorable exchange rate than you would get at a bank or ATM.
 
 When you change money, ask for some small bills and some 100-colón 
coins. Petty cash will come in handy for tipping and public transporta-
tion. Consider keeping the change separate from your larger bills so it’s 
readily accessible and so you’re less of a target for theft.
Unless you can secure a decent exchange rate, you really don’t need to 
change dollars into colones in advance of your trip because the airport 
taxis all accept U.S. dollars.
 
 Be very careful about exchanging money on the streets; doing so is 
extremely risky. In addition to forged bills and short counts, street 
money-changers frequently work in teams that can leave you holding 

 Chapter 5: Managing Your Money 55
neither colones nor dollars. When receiving change in colones, checking 
the larger-denomination bills is a good idea; they should have protective 
bands or hidden images that appear when held up to the light.
Using ATMs and carrying cash
The easiest and best way to get cash away from home is from an ATM, 
sometimes referred to as a “cash machine” or “cashpoint.” ATMs are 
quite common throughout Costa Rica, particularly in San José, and at 
most major tourist destinations around the country. You’ll find them at 
almost all banks and most shopping centers. Still, make sure you have 
some cash at the start of your trip, never let yourself run totally out of 
spending money, and definitely stock up on funds before heading to any 
of the more remote destinations in the country. Outside San José and 
any of the more developed beach destinations, it’s still best to think of 
your ATM card as a backup measure, because machines are not nearly 
as readily available or dependable as you may be accustomed to and 
you may encounter compatibility problems.
The Cirrus (% 800-424-7787; www.mastercard.com) and PLUS (% 800-
843-7587; www.visa.com) networks span the globe. Look at the back 
of your bank card to see which network you’re on; then call or check 
online for ATM locations at your destination. Be sure you know your 
personal identification number (PIN) before you leave home and be sure 
to find out your daily withdrawal limit before you depart. Also, keep in 
mind that many banks impose a fee every time your card is used at a dif-
ferent bank’s ATM, and that fee can be higher for international transac-
tions (up to $5 or more) than it is for domestic transaction (where fees 
are rarely more than $1.50). On top of this, the bank from which you 
withdraw cash may charge its own fee. To compare banks’ ATM fees 
within the U.S., use www.bankrate.com. For international withdrawal 
fees, ask your bank.
 
 In many international destinations, ATMs offer the best exchange rates, 
even taking into account the extra withdrawal fees you may be charged. 
Avoid exchanging money at commercial exchange bureaus and hotels, 
which often have the highest transaction fees.
 
 In 2009, in response to a rash of “express kidnapping” in San José, in 
which folks are taken at gunpoint to an ATM to clean out their bank 
accounts, both Banco Nacional and Banco de Costa Rica stopped ATM 
service between the hours of 10 p.m. and 5 a.m. Other networks still dis-
pense money 24 hours a day.
See the Quick Concierge for additional information on ATMs.
Charging ahead with credit cards
Credit cards are a safe way to carry money: They also provide a conve-
nient record of all your expenses, and they generally offer relatively 
good exchange rates. You can also withdraw cash advances from your 

Part II: Planning Your Trip to Costa Rica 
56
credit cards at banks or ATMs, provided you know your PIN. If you’ve 
forgotten yours, or didn’t even know you had one, call the number on 
the back of your credit card and ask the bank to send it to you. It usually 
takes five to seven business days, though some banks will provide the 
number over the phone if you tell them your mother’s maiden name or 
some other personal information.
Keep in mind that when you use your credit card abroad, many banks now 
assess a 1 percent to 3 percent transaction fee on all charges you incur 
abroad (whether you’re using the local currency or your native currency).
 
 Some credit card companies recommend that you notify them of any 
impending trip abroad so that they don’t become suspicious when the 
card is used numerous times in a foreign destination and block your 
charges. Even if you don’t call your credit card company in advance, 
you can always call the card’s toll-free emergency number if a charge is 
refused — a good reason to carry the phone number with you. But per-
haps the most important lesson here is to carry more than one card with 
you on your trip; a card might not work for any number of reasons, so 
having a backup is the smart way to go.
Toting traveler’s checks
In Costa Rica, traveler’s checks are accepted only by the larger hotels 
and restaurants, and primarily in the principal tourist destinations. 
Moreover, some hotels and restaurants even charge a service fee for the 
use of traveler’s checks.
You can buy traveler’s checks at most banks. They’re offered in denomina-
tions of $20, $50, $100, $500, and sometimes $1,000. Generally, you’ll pay 
a service charge ranging from 1 percent to 4 percent. The most popular 
traveler’s checks are offered by American Express (% 800-807-6233 or 
% 800-221-7282 for card holders — this number accepts collect calls, 
offers service in several foreign languages, and exempts Amex gold and 
platinum cardholders from the 1 percent fee); Visa (% 800-732-1322); 
and MasterCard (% 800-223-9920).
 
 If you choose to carry traveler’s checks, be sure to keep a record of their 
serial numbers separate from your checks in case they’re stolen or lost. 
You’ll get a refund faster if you know the numbers.
Taking Taxes into Account
There is a 13 percent tax on most goods and services in Costa Rica. 
Restaurants charge 13 percent tax and also add on a 10 percent service 
charge, for a total of 23 percent more on your bill. On restaurant menus, 
look for the letters i.v.i. next to the prices, which means the tax is 
included or factored into the listed price. Otherwise, tax may be added 
onto your bill later. All hotels charge 16.3 percent tax, which is the 13 
percent tax, plus a 3.3 percent special hotel tax.

 Chapter 5: Managing Your Money 57
There is a $26 departure tax (payable in cash at the airport) for all visi-
tors leaving Costa Rica by air.
Dealing with a Lost or Stolen Wallet
Be sure to contact all your credit card companies the minute you dis-
cover your wallet has been lost or stolen and file a report at the nearest 
police precinct. Your credit card company or insurer may require a 
police report number or record of the loss. Most credit card companies 
have an emergency toll-free number to call if your card is lost or stolen; 
they may be able to wire you a cash advance immediately or deliver an 
emergency credit card in a day or two. Call the following emergency 
numbers in Costa Rica:
 
✓ American Express (for lost cards): % 0800-012-3211
 
✓ American Express (for lost traveler’s checks): % 2242-8585
 
✓ MasterCard: % 0800-011-0184
 
✓ Visa: % 0800-011-0030
For other credit cards, or for a local representative of these companies, 
call Credomatic (% 2295-9898) in Costa Rica.
 
 Most credit cards carry a phone number you can call collect 24 hours a 
day from anywhere on the globe. Jotting down this number and keeping 
it in a safe place, separate from your wallet and valuables, before you 
travel is a good idea.
If your ATM card doesn’t work and you need cash in a hurry, Western 
Union (% 800-777-7777 in Costa Rica; www.westernunion.com) has 
numerous offices around San José and in several major towns and cities 
around the country.
Identity theft and fraud are potential complications of losing your wallet, 
especially if you’ve lost your driver’s license along with your cash and 
credit cards. Notify the major credit-reporting bureaus immediately; plac-
ing a fraud alert on your records may protect you against liability for crim-
inal activity. The three major U.S. credit-reporting agencies are Equifax 
(% 800-766-0008; www.equifax.com), Experian (% 888-397-3742; 
www.experian.com), and TransUnion (% 800-680-7289; www.trans
union.com). Finally, if you’ve lost all forms of photo ID, call your airline 
and explain the situation; they might allow you to board the plane if you 
have a copy of your passport or birth certificate and a copy of the police 
report you’ve filed.

G
etting there may not really be half the fun, but it’s a necessary 
step — and a big part of the planning process. How can you beat 
the high cost of international airfares? Should you reserve a package 
deal or book the elements of your vacation separately?
In this chapter, I give you all the information you need to make the trip 
decision that’s right for you.
Flying to Costa Rica
The majority of international flights arrive at San José’s Juan Santamaria 
International Airport, but an increasing number are landing in Liberia 
at the Daniel Olduber International Airport in the northern province 
of Guanacaste.
The following major airlines fly between mainland North America and 
one of Costa Rica’s two airports.
 
✓ Air Canada (% 888-247-2262; www.aircanada.ca) flies from 
Toronto to San José.
 
✓ American Airlines (% 800-433-7300; www.aa.com) flies direct to 
San José from Fort Lauderdale, Miami, and Dallas–Ft. Worth and, 
direct from Miami and Dallas–Ft. Worth to Liberia.
 
✓ Continental Airlines (% 800-231-0856; www.continental.com) 
has direct flights from Houston and Newark to both San José and 
Liberia.
 
✓ Delta Air Lines (% 800-221-1212; www.delta.com) flies from 
Atlanta to both San José and Liberia.

 Chapter 6: Getting to Costa Rica 59
 
✓ Frontier (% 800-432-1359; www.frontierairlines.com) flies 
daily direct from Denver to San José.
 
✓ JetBlue Airways (% 800-538-2583; www.jetblue.com) flies once 
daily direct from Orlando to San José.
 
✓ Spirit Air (% 800-772-7117; www.spiritair.com) flies once daily 
direct between Ft. Lauderdale and San José.
 
✓ US Airways (% 800-622-1015; www.usairways.com) has direct 
flights between both Phoenix, Arizona, and Charlotte, North 
Carolina, and San José, one weekly flight between Charlotte and 
Liberia.
 
✓ United Airlines (% 800-538-2929; www.united.com) flies direct 
from Los Angeles, Miami, and New York’s JFK to San José, and once 
weekly direct from Chicago to Liberia.
Getting the best airfare
Competition among the major airlines is unlike that of any other indus-
try. Every airline offers virtually the same product (basically, a coach 
seat is a coach seat is a . . .), yet prices can vary by hundreds of dollars.
 
 Business travelers who need the flexibility to buy their tickets at the last 
minute and change their itineraries at a moment’s notice –– and who 
want to get home before the weekend –– pay (or at least their companies 
pay) the premium rate, known as the full fare. But if you can book your 
ticket far in advance and stay over Saturday night, and if you’re willing 
to travel midweek (Tues–Thurs), you can qualify for the least expensive 
price –– usually a fraction of the full fare. Obviously, planning ahead 
pays.
The airlines also periodically hold sales, in which they lower the prices 
on their most popular routes. These fares have advance-purchase 
requirements and date-of-travel restrictions, but you can’t beat the 
prices. As you plan your vacation, keep your eyes open for these sales, 
which tend to take place in seasons of low travel volume — mid-April 
through mid-June and September through mid-December. You almost 
never see a sale around the peak summer vacation months of July and 
August, or around Thanksgiving or Christmas, when many people fly, 
regardless of the fare they have to pay.
Consolidators, also known as bucket shops, are great sources for interna-
tional tickets, although they usually can’t beat the Internet on fares 
within North America. Start by looking in Sunday newspaper travel sec-
tions; U.S. travelers should focus on the New York Times, Los Angeles 
Times, and Miami Herald. For a less-developed destination such as Costa 
Rica, small travel agencies that cater to immigrant communities in large 
cities often have the best deals.

Part II: Planning Your Trip to Costa Rica 
60
 
 Bucket-shop tickets are usually nonrefundable or rigged with stiff can-
cellation penalties, often as high as 50 percent to 75 percent of the ticket 
price, and some put you on charter airlines with questionable safety 
records.
One consolidator specializing in travel to Latin America is Latin Air 
Discount (% 213-383-8906; www.latindiscountair.com). STA 
Travel (% 800-781-4040; www.statravel.com), the world’s leader in 
student travel, offers good fares for travelers of all ages.
Booking your flight online
Search the Internet for cheap fares. The most popular online travel agen-
cies are Expedia (www.expedia.com); Orbitz (www.orbitz.com), and 
Travelocity (www.travelocity.com). In the U.K., go to travelsupermarket 
(% 0845-345-5708; www.travelsupermarket.com), a flight search 
engine that offers flight comparisons for the budget airlines whose 
seats often end up in bucket-shop sales. Other Web sites for booking 
airline tickets online include Cheapflights (www.cheapflights.com), 
SmarterTravel.com, Priceline.com, and Opodo (www.opodo.co.uk). 
Meta search sites (which find and then direct you to airline and hotel 
Web sites for booking) include SideStep (www.sidestep.com) and 
Kayak (www.kayak.com) — the latter includes fares for budget carriers 
like JetBlue and Spirit as well as the major airlines. Lastminute.com is a 
great source for last-minute flights and getaways. In addition, most air-
lines offer online-only fares that even their phone agents know nothing 
about. Also, keep an eye on price fluctuations and deals at Web sites 
such as Airfarewatchdog.com.
Frommers.com: The complete 
travel resource

Frequent-flier membership doesn’t cost a cent, but membership may 
entitle you to better seats, faster response to phone inquiries, and 
prompter service if your luggage is stolen or your flight is canceled or 
delayed, or if you want to change your seat (especially after you’ve 
racked up some miles). And you don’t have to fly to earn points; fre-
quent-flier credit cards can earn you thousands of miles for doing your 
everyday shopping. With more than 70 mileage rewards programs on 
the market, consumers have never had more options. To play the fre-
quent-flier game to your best advantage, consult the community bulletin 
boards on FlyerTalk (www.flyertalk.com) or go to InsideFlyer (www.
insideflyer.com).
Cruising to Costa Rica
Some 200 cruise ships stop each year in Costa Rica, calling at Limón on 
the Caribbean coast, and at Puerto Caldera and Puntarenas on the Pacific 
coast. Many are part of routes that cruise through the Panama Canal. 
Cruise lines that offer stops in Costa Rica include Crystal Cruises (% 888-
722-0021; www.crystalcruises.com), Celebrity Cruises (% 800-760-
0654; www.celebritycruises.com), Holland America (% 877-932-4259; 
www.hollandamerica.com), Norwegian Cruise Line (% 866-234-7650; 
www.ncl.com), Royal Caribbean (% 866-562-7625; www.rccl.com), 
Radisson Seven Seas Cruises (% 877-505-5370; www.rssc.com), and 
Silver Sea Cruises (% 800-722-9955; www.silversea.com).
It might pay to book through a travel agency that specializes in 
cruises; these companies buy in bulk and stay on top of the latest 
specials and promotions. Try the Cruise Company (% 800-289-5505; 
www.thecruisecompany.com) or World Wide Cruises (% 800-882-
9000; www.wwcruises.com).
Joining an Escorted Tour
Pay-one-price discount package tours are one thing, but escorted tours 
are a different animal altogether. Costa Rica is a friendly and accessible 
country for independent travel, but in some instances an escorted tour 
can be helpful. Many escorted tours to Costa Rica are built around a spe-
cific theme or adventure — bird-watching or mountain biking, for exam-
ple. They’re often led by knowledgeable and experienced guides.
You may be one of the many people who love escorted tours. The tour 
company takes care of all the details, and tells you what to expect at 
each leg of your journey. You know your costs upfront and, in the case 
of the tame ones, you don’t get many surprises. Escorted tours can take 
you to the maximum number of sights in the minimum amount of time 
with the least amount of hassle.

Part II: Planning Your Trip to Costa Rica 
62
 
 If you decide to go with an escorted tour, I strongly recommend pur-
chasing travel insurance, especially if the tour operator asks to you pay 
upfront. But don’t buy insurance from the tour operator! If the tour oper-
ator doesn’t fulfill its obligation to provide you with the vacation you 
paid for, there’s no reason to think that it’ll fulfill its insurance obliga-
tions either. Get travel insurance through an independent agency. (I tell 
you more about the ins and outs of travel insurance in Chapter 10.)
Depending on your recreational passions, I recommend one of the fol-
lowing tour companies:
 
✓ Abercrombie & Kent (% 800-554-7016; www.abercrombiekent.
com) is a luxury-tour company that offers several tours to Costa 
Rica. It specializes in nine-day highlight tours hitting Monteverde, 
Arenal, and Tortuguero. Service is personalized and the guides are 
top-notch.
 
✓ Caravan Tours (% 800-227-2826; www.caravan.com) is a large 
wholesaler specializing in fully escorted tours. A ten-day fully 
escorted tour around the country begins at around $995 per 
person, not including airfare.
 
✓ Costa Rica Expeditions (% 2257-0766; www.costarica
expeditions.com) is a Costa Rica–based company that offers 
everything from a ten-day escorted tour covering the whole coun-
try, to three-day/two-night and two-day/one-night tours of 
Monteverde Biological Cloud Forest Reserve and Tortuguero 
National Park, where it runs its own lodges. It also offers one- to 
two-day white-water rafting trips and other excursions.
 
 
✓ Overseas Adventure Travel (% 800-493-6824; www.oattravel.
com) offers good-value natural history and soft adventure itinerar-
ies, with optional add-on excursions. Tours are limited to 16 people 
and are guided by naturalists. All accommodations are in small 
hotels, lodges, or tent camps. The “Real Affordable Costa Rica” 
13-day package lives up to its name beginning at $1,895 per person 
(including round-trip airfare from Miami).
For more information on Escorted General-Interest Tours, including ques-
tions to ask before booking your trip, see www.frommers.com/planning.
Choosing a Package Tour
For lots of destinations, package tours can be a smart way to go. In many 
cases, a package tour that includes airfare, hotel, and transportation to 
and from the airport costs less than the hotel alone on a tour you book 
yourself. That’s because packages are sold in bulk to tour operators, 
who resell them to the public. It’s kind of like buying your vacation at a 
buy-in-bulk store –– except the tour operator is the one who buys the 
1,000-count box of garbage bags and resells them 10 at a time at a cost 
that undercuts the local supermarket.

 Chapter 6: Getting to Costa Rica 63
The quality of package tours can vary widely. Every destination, includ-
ing Costa Rica, usually has a few packagers that are better than the rest 
because they buy in even bigger bulk. The time you spend shopping 
around is likely to be well rewarded. The following is a list of top packag-
ers to explore:
 
✓ Costa Rica Experts (% 800-827-9046 or 773-935-1009; www.
crexpert.com) offers a large menu of a la carte and scheduled 
departures, as well as day trips and adventure packages.
 
✓ Liberty Travel (% 888-271-1584; www.libertytravel.com) is 
one of the biggest packagers in the Northeast. Liberty offers several 
value packages, with or without air, to various upscale all-inclusive 
and boutique properties in Costa Rica. Calling the toll-free number 
immediately connects you to the Liberty Travel store nearest your 
home.
 
✓ Vacation Express (% 800-309-4717; www.vacationexpress.
com) is a large packager with excellent deals on air-only, air-and-
hotel, and all-inclusive options to Costa Rica.
Several of the big online travel agencies — Expedia (www.expedia.com), 
Orbitz (www.orbitz.com), Travelocity (www.travelocity.com) — 
also do a brisk business in packages. If you’re unsure about the pedigree 
of a smaller packager, check with the Better Business Bureau in the city 
where the company is based, or go online to www.bbb.org. If a pack-
ager won’t tell you where it’s based, walk away.
 
 If you’re booking a last-minute getaway, you may be able to score a stel-
lar deal through Lastminute.com, which books all-inclusive travel pack-
ages as much as 60 percent off what the major packagers charge. The 
catch? You can only price and purchase your trip between 3 hours and 14 
days before your departure, and all destinations are not available from all 
departure points. Still, if you’re just dying to get away on the spur of the 
moment, it’s worth checking out. You may also want to check out Travel 
HUB (www.travelhub.com) for last-minute package deals.
 
 Be aware that some travel packagers are likely to book you on their own 
charter flights rather than on commercial flights on major airlines. 
Which airline the packager uses doesn’t really make a difference, unless 
you have a particular allegiance to a specific airline (or to collecting 
miles in a frequent-flier program). Be sure that you know which airline 
you’re flying when you book. If you really do want to fly with a specific 
airline, that doesn’t rule out a packager. In fact, just about any packager 
will be happy to book you a land-only vacation that lets you book your 
own airfare separately (even the airline packagers will do this; see the 
list of packagers mentioned earlier).
For more information on package tours and for tips on booking your 
trip, see www.frommers.com/planning.

Chapter 7
Getting Around Costa Rica
In This Chapter
▶ Flying to your destination
▶ Renting a car
▶ Busing it around Costa Rica
G
etting around Costa Rica is pretty simple and you have plentiful 
options. In this chapter, I give you the general lowdown on how to 
book and save money on rental cars, as well as the scoop on commuter 
airlines and local buses.
To visit many of the top spots in Costa Rica, taking a quick little com-
muter flight is the best, and sometimes only, option. Luckily, an excel-
lent network of commuter flights is serviced by two reliable local 
airlines.
If you’re going to crash on the beach for the week or visit just one area, 
you probably won’t need to rent a car. But if you want to travel around 
the country and explore a few different destinations, renting a car is 
inexpensive and easy.
Finally, if you really want to keep your budget in line, local buses, and a 
couple of regularly scheduled minivan lines, are the way to go. That 
said, buses are by far the slowest and least comfortable means of 
transportation.
Flying Is Fastest
Many of Costa Rica’s most popular destinations are a four- to eight-hour 
drive from San José. Luckily, excellent and affordable commuter airline 
service is offered to all these spots.
One-way fares from San José to most popular destinations run between 
$75 and $120. Flight times are generally between 20 minutes and a little 
over an hour.
Costa Rica’s two principal local commuter airlines are

 Chapter 7: Getting Around Costa Rica 65
 
✓ Sansa (% 877-767-2672 in the U.S. and Canada, 2290-4100 in Costa 
Rica; www.flysansa.com)
 
✓ Nature Air (% 800-235-9272 in the U.S. or Canada, 2299-6000 in 
Costa Rica; www.natureair.com)
Sansa operates from a separate terminal at San José’s Juan Santamaría 
International Airport, and offers a free shuttle bus from its downtown 
San José office to the airport. Nature Air operates from the small Tobís 
Bolaños International Airport in Pavas, 6.4km (4 miles) from San José. 
The ride from downtown to Pavas takes about ten minutes, and a 
metered taxi fare should cost $10 to $20.
Renting a Car
Renting a car in Costa Rica is no idle proposition. The roads are riddled 
with potholes, most rural intersections are unmarked, and, for some 
reason, sitting behind the wheel of a car seems to turn peaceful Ticos 
into homicidal maniacs.
This reality check isn’t meant to scare you off from driving in Costa Rica. 
If you plan to visit more than one destination, and you’re comfortable 
facing the aforementioned challenges, renting a car is a great way to go.
 
 Despite what you may have heard, you probably don’t absolutely need a 
four-wheel-drive vehicle in Costa Rica. Monteverde is the only major 
destination where four-wheel-drive is more or less mandatory, because 
roads generally aren’t paved there. The rest of the country can be 
reached by paved roads.
Still, many visitors enjoy the extra clearance afforded by a four-wheel-
drive vehicle. Moreover, a four-wheel-drive vehicle does allow you more 
freedom to venture off the beaten path.
The following companies rent cars in Costa Rica:
 
✓ Adobe: % 800-769-8422; www.adobecar.com
 
✓ Alamo: % 877-222-9075; www.alamo.com
 
✓ Avis: % 800-331-1212; www.avis.com

Part II: Planning Your Trip to Costa Rica 
66
 
 Before driving off with a rental car, be sure that you inspect the exterior 
and point out every tiny scratch, dent, tear, or any other damage. It’s a 
common practice with many Costa Rican car-rental companies to claim 
that you owe payment for minor dings and dents that the company finds 
when you return the car.
 
 Although rental cars no longer bear special license plates, they’re still 
readily identifiable to thieves and frequently targeted. (Nothing is ever 
safe in a car in Costa Rica, although parking in guarded parking lots 
helps.) Transit police also sometimes target tourists. Never pay money 
directly to a police officer who stops you for any traffic violation.
Busing It Around Costa Rica
Buses are by far the most economical way to get around the country, 
but they can be slow, uncomfortable, and a hassle if you have a lot of 
luggage. Costa Rican buses are inexpensive and they go nearly every-
where. There are two types:
 
✓ Local buses are the cheapest and slowest; they stop frequently and 
are generally a bit dilapidated.
 
✓ Express buses run between San José and most beach towns and 
major cities; these tend to be newer units and more comfortable, 
although very few are so new or modern as to have bathroom 
facilities.
Gray Line (% 2220-2126; www.graylinecostarica.com) and 
Interbus (% 2283-5573; www.interbusonline.com) run regularly 
scheduled departures in passenger vans and small buses to and from 
most of the major tourist destinations in the country. Both charge 
between $27 and $45 for a one-way trip, depending on the distance to 
your destination.
For more detailed information on how to get to various destinations, see 
the various destination chapters that follow.
 
 Both Gray Line and Interbus offer pickup and drop-off at a wide range of 
hotels. This means that if you’re the first person picked up or the last 
person dropped off, you may have to sit through a long period of subse-
quent stops before finally hitting the road or reaching your destination. 
I’ve heard some horror stories about both lines concerning missed or 
severely delayed connections and rude drivers.
 
 Be very careful with your bags and belongings on public buses and 
around public bus stations. Tourists are prime targets for thieves and 
pickpockets, and these are places where they’re easy picking. Try to 
always keep an eye on your belongings. If you must store your luggage 
out of sight, check on it during intermediary stops when others are load-
ing and offloading more baggage, just to be safe.

H
otel choices in Costa Rica are extensive and extremely varied. You 
can spend a week of utter luxury at a full-service beach resort, or 
some time trekking through the cloud forest while staying at an isolated 
ecolodge. You can even sleep in deluxe tent on the edge of a deserted 
beach surrounded by rain forest. This chapter helps you zero in on the 
type of accommodation best suited to your needs and tastes.
Costa Rica offers excellent options for every budget if you just know 
where to look — and I include the best of them in the chapters that 
follow. At the end of this chapter, I give specific tips on how to find the 
best rate and best room, no matter what your budget is. For more 
general tips on how to save, check out Chapter 5.
Getting to Know Your Options
Before you book your accommodations, you need to figure out what 
kind of place you want and how much you want to spend. Your options 
range from large-scale luxury resorts to basic budget cabinas (simple, 
rustic, Costa Rican hotels). In between these extremes, you’ll find 
numerous small to midsize hotels, ranging from moderate to downright 
decadent, as well as a whole host of ecolodges in remote, wild 
destinations.
Table 8-1 gives you an idea of what you can expect to pay in each price 
category.

Key to Hotel Dollar Signs*
Dollar Sign(s)
Price Range
What to Expect
$
Less than 
$75 per night
Budget — in this range you’ll find everything 
from very basic to quite comfortable options, 
but sometimes lacking amenities such as air-
conditioning, televisions, and in-room telephones.
$$
$75–$124
Moderate — a midpriced room, often in a 
charming small to midsize hotel. You’ll start to 
get more amenities in this price range, but air-
conditioning, televisions, and in-room phones 
may still be missing.
$$$
$125–$199
Expensive — a high-quality hotel room with 
plenty of amenities.
$$$$
$200–$349
Very expensive — a high-quality room in a full-
service resort, or intimate boutique hotel.
$$$$$
$350 or more 
per night
Ultraluxurious — only a few properties in Costa 
Rica charge this much. For this price, you’ll get 
a huge room, suite, or private bungalow; an 
impressive view; and excellent service.
* Each range of dollar signs, from one ($) to five ($$$$$), represents the median rack-rate 
price range for a double room, per night, during the high season; this does not factor in 
the 13 percent hotel tax.
Relaxing at a large resort
Relatively few large-scale resorts exist in Costa Rica. Only the Four 
Seasons and JW Marriott resorts cater to the ultra-high-end traveler.
Aside from a few exceptions in San José, most of the large resorts are 
beach resorts. (There are still none in the remote rain-forest and cloud-
forest destinations.) Most are located in the northwestern province of 
Guanacaste.
A resort (or resort hotel) offers everything that your average hotel offers — 
plus much more. Every resort hotel is different, of course, but you can 
expect such amenities as pools (often more than one) with poolside bar 
service; an activities desk; a fitness center and often a full-service spa; a 
variety of restaurants, bars, and lounges; a 24-hour front desk; con-
cierge, valet, and bell services; twice-daily maid service; room service; 
tennis and sometimes golf; a business center; extensive children’s pro-
grams; and more comforts. Beach resorts all offer direct beach access, 
with beach chairs and umbrellas, and often beach-toy rentals and a host 
of ocean activities.

 Chapter 8: Booking Your Accommodations 69
Many luxury resorts also boast an increasing slate of in-room extras, 
such as CD players and big TVs with Nintendo systems, on-screen Web 
access, VCRs or DVD players, and Internet access.
Although large resorts often carry the heftiest rack rates, you can often 
score good deals if you book these as part of a package (see Chapter 6) 
because the large resorts often presell a chunk of their rooms in bulk to 
packagers and wholesalers. Many large resorts also feature special 
offers and package deals on their own Web sites.
Hanging at a hotel
Most hotels in Costa Rica tend to be smaller and have fewer facilities 
than your typical resort. In many cases, midpriced hotels don’t offer air-
conditioning. Still, most are very comfortable and feature a whole host 
of facilities, amenities, and activity options. Although many have a small 
swimming pool, in general, you shouldn’t expect more than one restau-
rant or bar, or the myriad amenities that come with a full-fledged resort.
 
 Unless otherwise noted, hotel pools and tennis courts are outdoors.
You’ll find proportionally few chain hotels in Costa Rica, although 
Barceló, Best Western, Clarion, Comfort, Crowne Plaza, Hilton, Holiday 
Inn, InterContinental, Marriott, Meliá, Occidental, Radisson, and Ramada 
are all represented.
Enjoying intimacy at a boutique hotel or B&B
Boutique hotels are smaller — with maybe 10 to 40 rooms — and more 
intimate than your average hotel. Bed-and-breakfasts are usually even 
smaller still. In both cases, the rooms are often more stylish and less 
cookie-cutter and usually have more amenities than those found at simi-
larly priced hotels. The service also tends to be more attentive and 
personalized.
Throughout the book, I list the best boutique hotels Costa Rica has 
to offer. Several of these have banded together under the banner 
of Small Distinctive Hotels of Costa Rica (% 2258-0150; www.
distinctivehotels.com).
Getting close to nature at an ecolodge
Costa Rica is one of the world’s great natural destinations. Bird-
watchers, neophyte naturalists, and professional biologists flock here to 
spot wildlife and learn about the natural wonders of Costa Rica’s many 
national parks and bioreserves. Ecosystems range from the high-altitude 
cloud forests of Monteverde, to the lowland rain forests of Manuel 
Antonio and the Osa Peninsula, to the jungle canals of Tortuguero. In all 
these remote destinations, you’ll find small, isolated nature lodges or 
ecolodges. Some rival any accommodation in the country for a sense of 

Part II: Planning Your Trip to Costa Rica 
70
style and personal attention, with a fair amount of luxury thrown in 
besides. (However, very few have air-conditioning or televisions in the 
rooms. In general, you shouldn’t need the former and should be able to 
do without the latter here.) All have on-staff naturalist guides and a host 
of tour and hiking options.
Choosing a cabina
Cabinas are Costa Rica’s cut-rate accommodations. Many are simple 
cinder-block rooms, with concrete floors, and no air-conditioning. The 
better ones, however, can be quite cozy, and may have wood or tile 
floors, firm beds, plenty of space, an overhead fan, and perhaps even air-
conditioning and/or a television. Many cabinas feature either communal 
or private cooking areas, or laundry facilities. Cabinas are also great 
places to mingle with Costa Ricans. Throughout the book, I only include 
the cream of the crop of the cabina field.
 
 An ever increasing number of hotels are offering Wi-Fi connections, usu-
ally for free. In most instances, I mention this in the review, but more 
and more hotels are adding this perk all the time. If staying connected is 
important to you, be sure to ask before booking.
Finding the Best Room Rate
The rack rate is the maximum rate a hotel charges for a room. It’s the 
rate you get if you walk in off the street and ask for a room for the night. 
You sometimes see these rates printed on the fire/emergency exit dia-
grams posted on the back of your door.
Hotels are happy to charge you the rack rate, but you can almost always 
do better. Perhaps the best way to avoid paying the rack rate is surpris-
ingly simple: Just ask for a cheaper or discounted rate. You may be 
pleasantly surprised.
In all but the smallest accommodations, the rate you pay for a room 
depends on many factors –– chief among them being how you make your 
reservation. A travel agent may be able to negotiate a better price with 
certain hotels than you can get by yourself. (That’s because the hotel 
often gives the agent a discount in exchange for steering his business 
toward that hotel.)
 
 Reserving a room through the hotel’s toll-free number may also result in 
a lower rate than calling the hotel directly. On the other hand, the cen-
tral reservations number may not know about discount rates at specific 
locations. For example, a local franchise may offer a special group rate 
for a wedding or family reunion, but it may neglect to tell the central 
booking line. Your best bet is to call both the local number and the toll-
free number and see which one gives you a better deal.

 Chapter 8: Booking Your Accommodations 71
Room rates (even rack rates) change with the season, as occupancy 
rates rise and fall. But even within a given season, room prices are sub-
ject to change without notice, so the rates quoted in this book may be 
different from the actual rate you receive when you make your reserva-
tion. Be sure to mention membership in AAA, AARP, frequent-flier pro-
grams, and any other corporate rewards programs you can think of — or 
your Uncle Joe’s Elks lodge in which you’re an honorary inductee, for 
that matter — when you call to book. You never know when the affilia-
tion may be worth a few dollars off your room rate.
 
 A great way to get a great deal on a hotel room, especially at the large 
resorts, is to book it as part of an all-inclusive travel package that 
includes airfare and hotel, and sometimes other extras, in one low price. 
For details on how to find the best package deals, see Chapter 6.
Surfing the Web for Hotel Deals
Shopping online for hotels is generally done one of two ways: by booking 
through the hotel’s own Web site or through an independent booking 
agency (or a fare-service agency like Priceline). These Internet hotel 
agencies have multiplied in mind-boggling numbers of late, competing 
for the business of millions of consumers surfing for accommodations 
around the world. This competitiveness can be a boon to consumers 
who have the patience and time to shop and compare the online sites 
for good deals — but shop they must, for prices can vary considerably 
from site to site. And keep in mind that hotels at the top of a site’s listing 
may be there for no other reason than that they paid money to get the 
placement.
In addition to the online travel booking sites Expedia (www.expedia.
com), Hotwire (www.hotwire.com), Orbitz (www.orbitz.com), 
Priceline.com, and Travelocity (www.travelocity.com), you can 
book hotels through Hotels.com, Quikbook (www.quikbook.com), 
and Travelaxe (www.travelaxe.net). 
HotelChatter (www.hotelchatter.com) is a daily webzine offering 
smart coverage and critiques of hotels worldwide. Go to TripAdvisor 
(www.tripadvisor.com), or hotelshark (www.hotelshark.com) for 
helpful independent consumer reviews of hotels and resort properties.
It’s a good idea to get a confirmation number and make a printout of 
any online booking transaction.
 
 Your best bet in Costa Rica may be negotiating directly with the hotels 
themselves, especially the smaller hotels. In this day and age, almost 
every hotel in Costa Rica has e-mail, if not its own Web site, and you’ll 
find the contact information right there. However, be aware that 
response times may be slower than you’d like, and many of the smaller 
hotels may have some trouble communicating back and forth in English.

Reserving the Best Room
 
 After you make your reservation, asking one or two more pointed ques-
tions can go a long way toward making sure you get the best room in the 
house.
 
✓ Always ask for a corner room. They’re usually larger, quieter, and 
have more windows and light than standard rooms, and they don’t 
always cost more.
 
✓ Ask if the hotel is renovating. If it is, request a room away from 
the renovation work.
 
✓ Inquire about the location of the restaurants, bars, and discos in 
the hotel — all sources of annoying noise.
If you aren’t happy with your room when you arrive, talk to the front-
desk staff. If they have another room, they should be happy to accom-
modate you, within reason.

C
osta Rica is an exotic and diverse destination that is well suited to 
all sorts of travelers. Travelers come in a variety of ages, sizes, and 
types. You may wonder how Costa Rica is for families traveling with 
kids. What will it be like for same-sex couples? Is it hospitable to older 
travelers or those with disabilities? Can I get married there? If you have 
any of these questions, you’ve turned to the right chapter. In the follow-
ing pages, I give you the details of what to expect and how best to pre-
pare for any or all of these circumstances.
Traveling with the Brood: Advice for Families
Costa Rica is an excellent destination for children, especially those who 
are inquisitive and adventurous. Most children will be fascinated by the 
wildlife. Imagine: This is a place where grown adults come to study and 
collect insects, frogs, and snakes. So kids will feel right at home. Older 
children can learn to surf and fly through the air on a zip-line canopy tour.
Most hotels in Costa Rica give discounts for children under 12, and chil-
dren under 3 or 4 are usually allowed to stay for free. Discounts for chil-
dren and the cutoff ages vary according to the hotel. In general, don’t 
assume that your kids can stay in your room for free, but be sure to ask.
 
 Many hotels, villas, and cabinas come equipped with kitchenettes or full 
kitchen facilities. These can be a real money saver for those traveling 
with children, and I list many of these accommodations in the destina-
tion chapters that follow.

Part II: Planning Your Trip to Costa Rica

 Cabinas are Costa Rica’s version of cheap lodging. They’re very inexpen-
sive and very basic — often just cinder-block buildings divided into 
small rooms. They cater primarily to Tico families on vacation. (See 
Chapter 8 for more information.)
 
 Hotels offering regular, dependable baby-sitting service are few and far 
between. If you’ll need baby-sitting, make sure that your hotel offers it, 
and be sure to ask whether the baby sitters are bilingual. In many cases, 
they aren’t; this language difference usually isn’t a problem with infants 
and toddlers, but it can cause problems with older children.
 Look for the Kid Friendly icon as you flip through this book. I use it to 
highlight hotels, restaurants, and attractions that are particularly wel-
coming or suited to families traveling with kids. Zeroing in on these list-
ings can help you more efficiently plan your trip.
 
 All visitors to Costa Rica, including children, need to have a current 
passport.

Making Age Work for You: Tips for Seniors
Although senior citizens are respected and honored in Costa Rican soci-
ety, they’re seldom offered official discounts or perks. Still, mention the 
fact that you’re a senior citizen when you make your travel reservations. 
Although all the major U.S. airlines except America West have cancelled 
their senior discount and coupon-book programs, many hotel chains 
still offer discounts for seniors.
Always carry an ID card with you, especially if you’ve kept your youthful 
glow.
 
 Members of AARP, 601 E St. NW, Washington, DC 20049 (% 888-687-
2277 or 202-434-2277; www.aarp.org), get discounts on hotels (includ-
ing chains represented in Costa Rica), airfares, and rental cars. AARP 
offers members a wide range of benefits, including AARP: The Magazine 
and a monthly newsletter. Anyone over 50 can join.
Many reliable agencies and organizations target the 50-plus market. 
Elderhostel (% 800-454-5768; www.elderhostel.org) arranges Costa 
Rica study programs for those ages 55 and older, as well as intergenera-
tional trips good for families. ElderTreks (% 800-741-7956, or 416-558-
5000 outside North America; www.eldertreks.com) offers small-group 
tours to Costa Rica, restricted to travelers 50 and older.

Accessing Costa Rica: Advice for 
Travelers with Disabilities
Most disabilities shouldn’t stop anyone from traveling. There are more 
options and resources out there than ever before. Still, Costa Rica does 
present specific challenges to travelers with disabilities. Although Costa 
Rica has an Equality of Opportunities for People with Disabilities law, 
and some facilities have been adapted, in general, there are relatively 
few wheelchair-accessible buildings. In San José or elsewhere, sidewalks 
are crowded and uneven. Only a small number of hotels offer wheel-
chair-accessible accommodations, and there are no public buses thus 
equipped. In short, people with disabilities often have difficulty getting 
around in Costa Rica.
Many travel agencies offer customized tours and itineraries for 
travelers with disabilities. Flying Wheels Travel (% 507-451-5005; 
www.flyingwheelstravel.com) offers escorted tours and cruises 
that emphasize sports and private tours in minivans with lifts. Another 
good operator offering tours in Costa Rica is Accessible Journeys 
(% 800-846-4537 or 610-521-0339; www.disabilitytravel.com). 
Access-Able Travel Source (% 303-232-2979; www.access-able.com) 
offers extensive access information and advice for traveling around the 
world with disabilities.
 
 One local agency specializes in tours for travelers with disabilities and 
restricted mobility. Vaya Con Silla de Ruedas (%/fax 2454-2810; 
www.gowithwheelchairs.com) has a ramp- and elevator-equipped 
van and knowledgeable, bilingual guides. It charges very reasonable 
prices and can provide anything from simple airport transfers to com-
plete multiday tours.

Following the Rainbow: Resources for 
Gay and Lesbian Travelers
Costa Rica is a conservative Catholic country where public displays of 
same-sex affection are rare and considered somewhat shocking. Aside 
from the large resort hotels, some smaller hotels, a handful of bars and 
clubs, and one section of beach in Manuel Antonio, there are few places 
where same-sex shows of affection and contact are widely accepted. 
Still, gay and lesbian tourism to Costa Rica is robust, and gay and 
lesbian travelers are generally treated with respect. If you take into 
account the local mores, you should not experience any harassment.

events or meetings, and up-to-date information, www.gaycostarica.

and lesbian-friendly travel businesses and tour operators.
Two agencies specializing in gay and lesbian travel are Gay Adventure 
Tours, Inc. (% 207-239-6559; www.gayadventuretours.com), which 
focuses solely on tours to Costa Rica, and Above and Beyond Tours

Planning a Costa Rican Wedding
Getting married in Costa Rica is simple and straightforward. In most 
cases, all you need are current passports. You’ll have to provide some 
basic information, including a copy of each passport, your dates of birth, 
your occupations, your current address, and the names and addresses 
of your parents. Two witnesses are required to be present at the cere-
mony. If you’re traveling alone, your hotel or wedding consultant will 
provide the required witnesses.
 
 Things are slightly more complicated if one or more of the partners was 
previously married. In such a case, the previously married partner must 
provide an official copy of the divorce decree.
A note for female travelers
For lack of better phrasing, Costa Rica is a typically “macho” Latin American nation. 
Single women can expect a nearly constant stream of catcalls, hisses, whistles, and 
car horns, especially in San José. The best advice is to ignore the unwanted attention 
rather than try to come up with a witty rejoinder. Women should also be careful walking 
alone at night, both in San José and in more remote destinations. I definitely don’t 
recommend hitchhiking. You may want to check out the award-winning Web site 
Journeywoman (www.journeywoman.com), a women’s travel information network 
where you can sign up for a free e-mail newsletter and get advice on everything from 
etiquette and dress to safety.

 Chapter 9: Catering to Special Travel Needs or Interests 77
Most travelers who get married in Costa Rica do so in a civil ceremony 
officiated by a local lawyer. After the ceremony, the lawyer records the 
marriage with Costa Rica’s National Registry, which issues an official 
marriage certificate. This process generally takes between four and six 
weeks. Most lawyers or wedding coordinators then have the document 
translated and certified by the Costa Rican Foreign Ministry and at the 
embassy or consulate of your home country within Costa Rica before 
mailing it to you. From here, it’s a matter of bringing this document to 
your local civil or religious authorities, if necessary.
Because Costa Rica is more than 90 percent Roman Catholic, arranging 
for a church wedding is usually easy in all but the most isolated and 
remote locations. To a lesser extent, a variety of denominational 
Christian churches and priests are often available to perform or host 
the ceremony. If you’re Jewish, Muslim, Buddhist, or a follower of some 
other religion, bringing your own officiant is a good idea.
 
 Officially, the lawyer must read all or parts of the Costa Rican civil code 
on marriage during your ceremony. This is a rather uninspired and 
somewhat dated legal code that, at some weddings, can take as much as 
20 minutes to slog through. Most lawyers and wedding coordinators are 
quite flexible and can work with you to design a ceremony and text that 
fits your needs and desires. Insist on this.
Most of the higher-end and romantic hotels in Costa Rica have ample 
experience in hosting weddings. Many have an in-house wedding plan-
ner. Narrowing the list is tough, but I’d say the top choices include Hotel 
Punta Islita (Chapter 19), Villa Caletas (Chapter 16), Makanda-by-the-
Sea (Chapter 15), Flor Blanca Resort (Chapter 19), and the Four Seasons 
(Chapter 13). If you want a remote, yet luxurious, rain-forest lodge to 
serve as host and backdrop, try La Paloma Lodge (Chapter 20), Bosque 
del Cabo Rainforest Lodge (Chapter 20), or Lapa Ríos (Chapter 20). 
Another interesting option is Punta Coral, a private reserve owned by 
Calypso Tours (% 800-887-1969; www.calypsotours.com).
If you’re looking for service beyond what your hotel can offer, or if 
you want to do it yourself, check out www.weddings.co.cr, www.

Volunteering and Studying in Costa Rica
“Working” vacations have become more and more popular over the last 
few years and several ecologically oriented volunteer and study pro-
grams are available throughout Costa Rica. These programs can be a 
unique and rewarding way to spend your vacation time.
 
 Be warned: These “volunteer” experiences do not come cheap. You must 
pay for your transportation and there is sometimes a program fee, 

Part II: Planning Your Trip to Costa Rica 
78
which can be hefty. (The cost will be the same as, or more than, a tradi-
tional vacation.)
If you’d like to explore ways to spend your vacation time a little differ-
ently, here is a list of some institutions and organizations that are work-
ing on ecology and sustainable development projects:
 
✓ Association for the Preservation of the Wild Flora and Fauna 
(APREFLOFAS; % 2574-6816; www.preserveplanet.org) is a 
pioneering local conservation organization that accepts volunteers 
and runs environmentally sound educational tours around the 
country.
 
✓ Asociación de Voluntarios para el Servicio en las Areas 
Protegidas (ASVO; % 2258-4430; www.asvocr.com) organizes 
volunteers to work in Costa Rican national parks. A two-week mini-
mum commitment is required, as is a basic ability to converse in 
Spanish. Housing is provided at a basic ranger station, and there is 
a $17 daily fee to cover food, which is basic Tico fare.
 
✓ Earthwatch Institute (% 800-776-0188 in the U.S.; www.
earthwatch.org) organizes volunteers to go on research trips 
to help scientists collect data and conduct field experiments in a 
number of scientific fields and a wide range of settings. Expeditions 
to Costa Rica range from studies of the nesting habits of leather-
back sea turtles to research into sustainable coffee-growing 
methods.
 
✓ Global Volunteers (% 800-487-1074 in the U.S.; www.global
volunteers.org) is a U.S.-based organization that offers a 
unique opportunity to travelers who’ve always wanted a Peace 
Corps–like experience but can’t make a two-year commitment. For 
two to three weeks, you can join one of its working vacations in 
Costa Rica.
 
✓ Habitat for Humanity International (% 2296-3436; www.
habitatcostarica.org) has several chapters in Costa Rica and 
sometimes runs organized Global Village programs here.
 
✓ Vida (% 2221-8367; www.vida.org) is a local nongovernmental 
organization working on sustainable development and conserva-
tion issues; it can often place volunteers.

T
his chapter helps you shore up the final details — from getting a 
passport to purchasing travel insurance to mapping out strategies to 
stay connected while you’re in Costa Rica.
Getting a Passport
A valid passport is required of all travelers entering Costa Rica.
Applying for a U.S. passport
The U.S. State Department Web site (http://travel.state.gov) 
provides downloadable passport applications as well as the current fees 
for processing applications. Note: Children are required to present a 
passport when entering the United States at airports. More information 
on obtaining a passport for a minor can be found at http://travel.
state.gov.
 
 Allow plenty of time before your trip to apply for a passport; processing 
normally takes four to six weeks (3 weeks for expedited service) but can 
take longer during busy periods (especially spring). And keep in mind 
that if you need a passport in a hurry, you’ll pay a higher processing fee.
Applying for other passports
The following list offers more information for citizens of Australia, 
Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom.

Part II: Planning Your Trip to Costa Rica 
80
 
✓ Australians can pick up an application from their local post office or 
any branch of Passports Australia, but they must schedule an inter-
view at the passport office to present their application materials. 
Call the Australian Passport Information Service at % 131-232, or 
visit the government Web site at www.passports.gov.au.
 
✓ Canadians can pick up applications at travel agencies throughout 
Canada or from the central Passport Office, Department of Foreign 
Affairs and International Trade, Ottawa, ON K1A 0G3 (% 800-567-
6868; www.ppt.gc.ca). Note: Canadian children who travel must 
have their own passports. However, if you hold a valid Canadian 
passport issued before December 11, 2001, that bears the name of 
your child, the passport remains valid for you and your child until 
it expires.
 
✓ Residents of Ireland can apply for a ten-year passport at the 
Passport Office, Setanta Centre, Molesworth Street, Dublin 2 
(% 01-671-1633; www.irlgov.ie/iveagh). Those under age 18 
and over 65 must apply for a three-year passport. You can also 
apply at 1A South Mall, Cork (% 21-494-4700) or at most main post 
offices.
 
✓ New Zealanders can pick up a passport application at any New 
Zealand Passports Office or download it from their Web site. 
Contact the Passports Office at % 0800-225-050 in New Zealand or 
04-474-8100, or log on to www.passports.govt.nz.
 
✓ United Kingdom residents can pick up applications for a standard 
ten-year passport (5-year passport for children under 16) at pass-
port offices, major post offices, or a travel agency. For information, 
contact the United Kingdom Passport Service (% 0870-521-0410; 
www.ukpa.gov.uk).
Playing It Safe with Travel 
and Medical Insurance
The types of insurance travelers are most likely to need are trip-
cancellation insurance and medical insurance. The cost of travel insur-
ance varies widely, depending on the cost and length of your trip, your 
age and health, and the type of trip you’re taking. You can get estimates 
from various providers through InsureMyTrip.com. Enter your trip cost 
and dates, your age, and other information, for prices from more than a 
dozen companies.
U.K. citizens and their families who make more than one trip abroad 
per year may find an annual travel insurance policy works out cheaper. 
Check moneysupermarket.com, which compares prices across a wide 
range of providers for single- and multi-trip policies.

 Chapter 10: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 81
Most big travel agents offer their own insurance and will probably try to 
sell you their packages when you book a holiday. Think before you sign. 
Britain’s Consumers’ Association recommends that you insist on seeing 
the policy and reading the fine print before buying travel insurance. The 
Association of British Insurers (% 020-7600-3333; www.abi.org.uk) 
gives advice by phone and publishes Holiday Insurance, a free guide to 
policy provisions and prices. You might also shop around for better deals: 
Try Columbus Direct (% 0870-033- 9988; www.columbusdirect.net).
Here is my advice on trip-cancellation and medical insurance:
 
✓ Trip-cancellation insurance will help retrieve your money if 
you have to back out of a trip or depart early, or if your travel 
supplier goes bankrupt. Trip cancellation traditionally covers 
such events as sickness, natural disasters, and State Department 
advisories. The latest news in trip-cancellation insurance is the 
availability of expanded hurricane coverage and the “any-reason” 
cancellation coverage, the latter of which costs more than other 
types of insurance but covers cancellations made for any reason. 
You won’t get back 100 percent of your prepaid trip cost, but 
you’ll be refunded a substantial portion. TravelSafe (% 888-885-
7233; www.travelsafe.com) offers both types of coverage. 
Expedia (www.expedia.com) also offers any-reason cancellation 
coverage for its air-hotel packages. You can also try one of the 
following recommended insurers: Access America (% 866-807-
3982; www.accessamerica.com); Travel Guard International 
(% 800-826-4919; www.travelguard.com); Travel Insured 
International (% 800-243-3174; www.travelinsured.com); 
and Travelex Insurance Services (% 888-457-4602; www.
travelex-insurance.com).
 
 For travel overseas, you may want to look into medical insurance. 
Most U.S. health plans (including Medicare and Medicaid) do not 
provide coverage, and the ones that do often require you to pay for 
services upfront and reimburse you only after you return home.
 
 If you require additional medical insurance, try MEDEX Assistance 
(% 410-453-6300; www.medexassist.com) or Travel Assistance 
International (% 800-821-2828; www.travelassistance.com; 
for general information on services, call the company’s Worldwide 
Assistance Services, Inc., at % 800-777-8710).
 
 Canadians should check with their provincial health-plan offices or 
call Health Canada (% 866-225-0709; www.hc-sc.gc.ca) to find 
out the extent of their coverage and what documentation and 
receipts they must take home in case they’re treated overseas.
 
 Travelers from the U.K. should carry their European Health 
Insurance Card (EHIC), which replaced the E111 form as proof 
of entitlement to free/reduced-cost medical treatment abroad 

Part II: Planning Your Trip to Costa Rica 
82
(% 0845-606-2030; www.ehic.org.uk). Note, however, that the 
EHIC only covers “necessary medical treatment”; for repatriation 
costs, lost money, baggage, or cancellation, you should buy travel 
insurance from a reputable company.
Staying Healthy When You Travel
Getting sick will ruin your vacation, so I strongly advise against it. (Of 
course, last time I checked, the bugs weren’t listening to me any more 
than they probably listen to you.)
Staying healthy on a trip to Costa Rica is predominantly a matter of 
being a little cautious about what you eat and drink and using common 
sense. Know your physical limits, and don’t overexert yourself in the 
ocean, on hikes, or in athletic activities. Respect the tropical sun and 
protect yourself from it. 
 
 For information on purchasing additional medical insurance for your trip, 
see the preceding section.
Talk to your doctor before leaving on a trip if you have a serious and/or 
chronic illness. For conditions such as epilepsy, diabetes, or heart 
problems, wear a MedicAlert identification tag (% 888-633-4298; www.
medicalert.org), which immediately alerts doctors to your condition 
and gives them access to your records through MedicAlert’s 24-hour 
hotline. Contact the International Association for Medical Assistance 
to Travelers (IAMAT; % 716-754-4883, or 416-652-0137 in Canada; www.
iamat.org) for tips on travel and health concerns in the countries 
you’re visiting, and lists of local, English-speaking doctors. The U.S. 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (% 800-311-3435; www.
cdc.gov) provides up-to-date information on health hazards by region 
or country and offers tips on food safety. Travel Health Online (www.
tripprep.com), sponsored by a consortium of travel medicine practi-
tioners, may also offer helpful advice on traveling abroad. You can find 
listings of reliable clinics overseas at the International Society of Travel 
Medicine (www.istm.org)
Tropical illnesses
Your chance of contracting any serious tropical disease in Costa Rica is 
slim, especially if you stick to the beaches or traditional spots for visi-
tors. However, malaria, dengue fever, and leptospirosis all exist in Costa 
Rica, so knowing what they are is a good idea.
Although not widespread, malaria is found in the lowlands on both 
coasts and in the northern zone. Although rarely found in urban areas, 
it’s still a problem in some remote rural regions and along the Caribbean 
coast. Malaria prophylaxes are available, but several have side effects, 
and others are of questionable effectiveness. Consult your doctor regard-
ing what is currently considered the best preventive treatment for 

 Chapter 10: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 83
malaria. Be sure to ask whether a recommended drug will cause you to 
be hypersensitive to the sun; it would be a shame to come down here for 
the beaches and then have to hide under an umbrella the entire time. 
Because malaria-carrying mosquitoes usually come out at night, you 
should do as much as possible to avoid being bitten after dark. If you are 
in a malarial area, wear long pants and long sleeves, use insect repellent, 
and either sleep under a mosquito net or burn mosquito coils (similar to 
incense, but with pesticide).
Of greater concern, perhaps, is dengue fever, which has had periodic 
outbreaks in Latin America since the mid-1990s. Dengue fever is similar 
to malaria and is spread by an aggressive daytime mosquito. This 
mosquito seems to be most common in lowland urban areas, and 
Puntarenas, Liberia, and Limón have been the worst-hit cities in Costa 
Rica. Dengue is also known as “bone-break fever” because it’s usually 
accompanied by severe body aches. The first infection with dengue 
fever will make you very sick but should cause no serious damage. 
However, a second infection with a different strain of the dengue virus 
can lead to internal hemorrhaging and could be life threatening.
 
 Many people are convinced that taking B-complex vitamins daily will 
help prevent mosquitoes from biting you. I don’t think the American 
Medical Association has endorsed this idea yet, but I’ve run across it in 
enough places to think that there may be something to it.
One final tropical fever that I think you should know about (because I 
got it myself) is leptospirosis. There are more than 200 strains of lepto-
spiri, which are animal-borne bacteria transmitted to humans via contact 
with drinking, swimming, or bathing water. This bacterial infection is 
easily treated with antibiotics; however, it can quickly cause very high 
fever and chills and should be treated promptly.
If you develop a high fever accompanied by severe body aches, nausea, 
diarrhea, or vomiting during or shortly after a visit to Costa Rica, con-
sult a physician as soon as possible.
Costa Rica has been relatively free of the cholera epidemic that has 
spread through much of Latin America in recent years. This is largely 
due to an extensive public-awareness campaign that has promoted good 
hygiene and increased sanitation. Your chances of contracting cholera 
while you’re here are very slim.
Dietary red flags
Because many folks experience minor gastrointestinal weirdness when 
visiting a foreign country, I recommend buying and drinking bottled 
water or soft drinks, but the water in San José and in most of the heavily 
visited spots in Costa Rica is safe to drink. If your stomach is very sensi-
tive, drink straight from the bottle or can (wiping it off first), avoid 
drinks with ice, and don’t eat fruits or vegetables that you don’t peel 
first, except at the better hotels and restaurants.

Part II: Planning Your Trip to Costa Rica 
84
Even though the water in San José and most popular destinations in 
Costa Rica is generally safe, and even though you’ve been careful to buy 
bottled water, order frescos en leche (fruit shakes made with milk rather 
than water), and drink your soft drink warm (without ice cubes — which 
are made from water, after all), you still might encounter some intestinal 
difficulties. Most of this is just due to tender northern stomachs coming 
into contact with slightly more aggressive Latin American intestinal 
flora. In extreme cases of diarrhea or intestinal discomfort, it’s worth 
taking a stool sample to a lab for analysis. The results will usually pin-
point the amoebic or parasitic culprit, which can then be readily treated 
with available over-the-counter medicines.
Except in the most established and hygienic of restaurants, it’s also 
advisable to avoid ceviche, a raw seafood salad, especially if it has any 
shellfish in it. It could be home to any number of bacterial critters.
Bugs, bites, and other wildlife concerns
Although Costa Rica has Africanized bees (the notorious “killer bees” of 
fact and fable) and several species of venomous snakes, your chances of 
being bitten are minimal, especially if you refrain from sticking your 
hands into hives or under rocks in the forest. If you know that you’re 
allergic to bee stings, consult your doctor before traveling.
Snake sightings, much less snakebites, are very rare. Moreover, the 
majority of snakes in Costa Rica are nonpoisonous. If you do encounter 
a snake, stay calm, don’t make any sudden movements, and don’t try 
to handle it. Avoid sticking your hands under rocks, branches, and 
fallen trees.
Scorpions, black widow spiders, tarantulas, bullet ants, and biting 
insects of many types can all be found in Costa Rica. In general, they 
aren’t nearly the danger or nuisance most visitors fear. Watch where 
you stick your hands. In addition, you might want to shake out your 
clothes and shoes before putting them on to avoid any unpleasant and 
painful surprises.
Tropical sun
Limit your exposure to the sun, especially during the first few days of 
your trip and, thereafter, from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Use a sunscreen with a 
high SPF, and apply it liberally. Remember that children need more pro-
tection than adults.
What to do if you get sick away from home
Your hotel front desk should be your best source of information and 
assistance if you get sick while in Costa Rica. In addition, your local con-
sulate in Costa Rica can provide a list of area doctors who speak English. 
The local English-language newspaper, the Tico Times, is another good 
resource.

 Chapter 10: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 85
In general, Costa Rica has a high level of medical care and services for a 
developing nation. The better private hospitals and doctors in San José 
are very good. In fact, given the relatively low-cost nature of care and 
treatment, a sizeable number of Americans come to Costa Rica each 
year for elective surgery and other care.
Most state-run hospitals and walk-in clinics around the country have 
emergency rooms that can treat most conditions, although I highly rec-
ommend the private hospitals in San José if your condition is not life-
threatening and can wait for treatment until you reach one of them.
In San José, try Clínica Bíblica, Avenida 14 between calles Central and 1 
(% 2522-1000; www.clinicabiblica.com), which offers emergency 
services to foreign visitors at reasonable prices, or the Hospital CIMA 
(% 2208-1000; www.hospitalsanjose.net), which has the most 
modern facilities in the country and is located in Escazú on the Próspero 
Fernández Highway that connects San José and the western suburb of 
Santa Ana.
Staying Connected
Costa Rica primarily uses GSM (Global System for Mobile Communica-
tions) networks. If your cellphone is on a GSM system and you have 
a world-capable multiband phone such as many Sony Ericsson, LG, 
Motorola, or Samsung models, you can make and receive calls across 
civilized areas around much of the globe. Just call your wireless opera-
tor and ask for international roaming to be activated on your account. 
Per-minute charges can be high, though — up to $5 in Costa Rica, 
depending upon your plan.
 
 Unfortunately, those with unlocked tri- and quad-band GSM phones still 
cannot simply buy a local SIM card in Costa Rica. However, a free trade 
agreement with the United States and other Central American nations is 
expected to open up the state monopoly on telecommunications during 
2010, and this should change.
Several local firms rent cellphones to visiting tourists and business 
travelers. However, none of the rental companies has a booth or office 
at the airport, so you’ll have to contact a rental company either before-
hand or from your hotel. Most will deliver the phone to your hotel. 
Cell Service (% 2296-5553; www.cellservicecr.com), Costa Rica 
Cellular Connection (% 800-372-3183 in the U.S. and Canada, 8876-1776 
in Costa Rica; www.costaricacellularconnection.com), and GSM 
Rent A Cell (% 2231-5410; www.gsmrentacell.com) all rent cell-
phones. Rates range from $5 to $10 per day or $30 to $50 per week for 
the rental, with charges of 50¢ to $1.50 per minute for local calls and $1 
to $3 per minute for international calls.

Part II: Planning Your Trip to Costa Rica 
86
In addition to these companies, most of the major car-rental agencies 
are offering cellphone rentals, for rates similar to those listed earlier.
Voice over Internet protocol (VOIP)
If you have Web access while traveling, consider a broadband-based 
telephone service (in technical terms, voice over Internet protocol, or 
VOIP) such as Skype (www.skype.com) or Vonage (www.vonage.com), 
which allow you to make free international calls from your laptop or in a 
cybercafe. Neither service requires the people you’re calling to also 
have that service (though there are fees if they don’t). Check the Web 
sites for details.
Accessing the Internet away from home
Most major tourist destinations in Costa Rica have one or more cyber-
cafes, and in those destinations that don’t, most hotels will let you check 
your e-mail and surf the Web either for free or for a nominal charge.
If you have your own computer, you can use the high-speed Wi-Fi access 
offered by more and more hotels, resorts, cafes, and retailers around 
Costa Rica, either free or for a small fee.
Costa Rica uses standard U.S.-style two- and three-prong electric outlets 
with 110-volt AC current, and standard U.S.-style phone jacks. Wherever 
you go, bring a connection kit with power and phone adapters, a spare 
phone cord, and a spare Ethernet network cable — or find out whether 
your hotel supplies them to guests.
Keeping Up with Airline Security Measures
With the federalization of airport security, security procedures at U.S. 
airports are more stable and consistent than ever. Generally, you’ll be 
fine if you arrive at the airport one hour before a domestic flight and 
two hours before an international flight; if you show up late, tell an air-
line employee and she’ll probably whisk you to the front of the line.
Bring a current, government-issued photo ID such as a driver’s license 
or passport. Keep your ID at the ready to show at check-in, the security 
checkpoint, and sometimes even the gate. (Children under 18 do not 
need government-issued photo IDs for domestic flights, but they do for 
international flights to most countries.)
E-tickets have made paper tickets nearly obsolete. If you have an 
E-ticket, you can beat the ticket-counter lines by using airport electronic 
kiosks or even online check-in from your home computer. Online check-
in involves logging on to your airline’s Web site, accessing your reserva-
tion, and printing out your boarding pass — and the airline may even 
offer you bonus miles to do so! If you’re using a kiosk at the airport, 
bring the credit card you used to book the ticket or your frequent-flier 

 Chapter 10: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 87
card. Print out your boarding pass from the kiosk and simply proceed to 
the security checkpoint with your pass and a photo ID. Curbside check-
in is also a good way to avoid lines, although a few airlines still ban 
curbside check-in; call the airline or check the airline’s Web site before 
you go.
Speed up security by not wearing metal objects such as big belt buck-
les. If you have metallic body parts, a note from your doctor can prevent 
a long chat with the security screeners. Keep in mind that only ticketed 
passengers are allowed past security, except for folks escorting disabled 
passengers or children.
Federalization has stabilized what you can carry on and what you can’t. 
Travelers in the U.S. are allowed one carry-on bag, plus a “personal 
item” such as a purse, briefcase, or laptop bag. Carry-on hoarders can 
stuff all sorts of things into a laptop bag; as long as it has a laptop in it, 
it’s still considered a personal item. The Transportation Security 
Administration (TSA) has issued a list of restricted items; check www.
tsa.gov for details.
Airport screeners may decide that your checked luggage needs to 
be searched by hand. You can purchase luggage locks that allow screen-
ers to open and relock a checked bag if hand-searching is necessary. 
Look for Travel Sentry–certified locks at luggage or travel shops and 
Brookstone stores (or online at www.brookstone.com). For more infor-
mation on the locks, visit www.travelsentry.org.

Part III
San José and the 
Central Valley

In this part . . .
L
ocated more or less in the geographic center of the coun-
try, San José is also the political, social, cultural, and 
transportation center of Costa Rica. This part tells you what 
to see and what to avoid in the city. It lists the best hotels 
and restaurants in San José in a range of price categories and 
a variety of locations.
After you’re settled in, orientated, and well fed, you can take 
advantage of a wide range of attractions and day trips in the 
city and surrounding Central Valley to keep you busy. I fi ll 
you in on your numerous options in this part.

Settling into San José

▶ Taking in the view from a mirador
T
he prevailing rap is that San José is an unattractive, uninspiring, and 
somewhat dangerous city, and you should make every effort to get 
out of the city as quickly as possible. This is, in part, true: Streets are 
burdened by traffic in a near-constant state of gridlock, sidewalks are 
poorly maintained and claustrophobic, and street crime is a problem.
Still, San José is one of the most cosmopolitan cities in Central America. 
Several very respectable museums are in town. And you can find a broad 
selection of small, elegant hotels in renovated historic buildings, as well 
as innovative restaurants serving a wide range of international cuisines.
Things have been improving, however. Mayor Johnny Araya has led 
ambitious and controversial campaigns to rid the narrow sidewalks of 
illegal vendors, to reduce the clutter of billboards and overhead signs, 
and to bury a good share of the city’s electrical and phone cables. A 
move to more efficiently regulate bus and commuter traffic has also 
begun, although much more needs to be done in this area.
San José makes a great base for a variety of day trips and excursions. 
Within an hour or two, you can climb a volcano, go white-water rafting, 
hike through a cloud forest, and stroll through a butterfly garden — 
among many, many other activities.
For many visitors to Costa Rica, San José invariably serves as a default 
hub or transfer point, unless you’re flying in and out of Liberia (see 
Chapter 6 for more information). This chapter helps you plan your time 
in the capital and helps ease your way through the aforementioned 
pitfalls.

92
Part III: San José and the Central Valley 
Getting There
With the increasing number of direct flights into Liberia, San José is no 
longer the de facto transportation hub for all tourists coming to Costa 
Rica. Still, a vast majority of travelers do fly in and out of the country’s 
capital, because for most airlines, San José is the gateway to Costa Rica.
Flying is clearly the fastest and most comfortable way to get to San José. 
This section also covers arriving by bus and car. However, these options 
are far less common, given the long travel times involved and the often 
shabby conditions of the buses and roads.
Arriving by air
A great majority of international flights to Costa Rica land at the Juan 
Santamaría International Airport (% 2437-2626 for 24-hour airport 
information; www.alterra.co.cr; airport code: SJO), which is located 
near the city of Alajuela, about 20 minutes from downtown San José.
At press time the airport was still in the midst of a major renovation and 
expansion, a process that has been plagued by work stoppages, delays, 
contract disputes, bickering between the government and the interna-
tional company in charge of the work, and financing problems. It’s hard 
to be specific, but work is expected to be completed sometime in 2010.
So far, one of two new terminal buildings have been completed, and all 
the major airlines have moved their desks into this terminal. However, 
the new baggage claim and Customs and Immigration areas, which are 
modern and spacious, are not particularly fast and efficient. Moreover, 
despite the major remodeling, chaos and confusion continue to greet 
arriving passengers the second they step out of the terminal. As in the 
past, you must abandon your luggage carts just before exiting the build-
ing and then face a gauntlet of aggressive taxi drivers and people offer-
ing to carry your bags. Fortunately, all the major car-rental companies, 
and the official airport taxi service (see later in this section) have booths 
inside the terminal after you clear Customs.
Most porters or skycaps wear a uniform identifying them as such, but 
sometimes “improvised” porters will try to earn a few dollars by carry-
ing your bags. (Because the line of waiting taxis and shuttles is just steps 
away, your bags probably won’t have to be carried.)
 
 Tip porters about 50¢ per bag.
 
 Keep a watchful eye on your bags. In the past, thieves have preyed on 
newly arrived passengers and their luggage.
Getting from the airport to your hotel
You can get to and from the airport in several different ways, but I list 
them here, starting with what’s easiest:

 Chapter 11: Settling into San José 93
 
✓ By taxi: If you have a lot of luggage, a cab is your best option. 
Try to stick with Taxis Unidos Aeropuerto (% 2221-6865; www.
taxiaeropuerto.com), which operates a fleet of orange vans and 
sedans out of the airport. You no longer have to buy a prepaid 
voucher, as these taxis now use official meters. It costs between 
$18 and $22 to most hotels downtown.
 
 In addition to Taxis Unidos, you’ll also find regular cabs (marked 
red sedans) and pirata (pirate) cabs, freelance drivers using their 
own vehicles. A handful of these drivers and their touts await all 
arriving flights, and will be screaming “Taxi, my friend,” or some-
thing similar, as you exit the terminal. You could use either of these 
latter options. Piratas tend to charge a dollar or two less, but I rec-
ommend using the official service for safety and standardized 
prices.
 
 
 Don’t worry if you haven’t been able to exchange money for colo-
nes. The official taxi company, and most of the piratas, accept U.S. 
dollars.
 
✓ By shuttle: A couple of the large chain hotels, including the 
Marriott and Hampton Inn, have regular free shuttles to and from 
the airport.
 
 You can also take the Gray Line (% 2220-2126; www.grayline
costarica.com) or Interbus (% 2283-5573; www.interbus
online.com) shuttle-bus services. Gray Line runs approximately 
every 30 minutes and charges $15 per person to most downtown 
hotels. You can either book in advance or catch the bus at the curb 
just beyond the exit for international arriving passengers. Interbus 
charges between $7 and $10 per person and will arrange specific 
pickup times. With Interbus, reserving in advance is best.
 
✓ By bus: Alajuela–San José buses stop right at the airport, run fre-
quently, and will drop you off anywhere along Paseo Colón, or at a 
station downtown near Parque de la Merced (La Merced Park) 
between calles 12 and 14 and avenidas 2 and 4. You can take one of 
two separate lines: Tuasa buses are red; Station Wagon buses are 
beige/yellow. At the airport, you’ll find the bus stop directly in 
front of the main terminal. Be sure to ask whether the bus is going 
to San José, or you may end up in Alajuela.
 
✓ By rental car: Quite a few car-rental agencies with desks and 
offices can be found at the airport, although if you’re planning to 
spend a few days in San José itself, a car is a liability. (If you’re 
heading immediately to the beach, though, picking up your car 
here is much easier than having to get it at a downtown office.)
 
 Various car-rental agencies already have desks inside the new ter-
minal, right where you exit Customs and Immigration; other agen-
cies are still in limbo, awaiting completion of airport remodeling, so 
be sure to contact them first to confirm that they’ll have an agent 
or an office at the airport when you arrive.

Part III: San José and the Central Valley 
94
 
 The airport sits right off the main Interamerican Highway, and the 
only exit will put you right on the highway. Follow signs to San José 
if you’re going downtown. Follow signs to Alajuela and San Ramón 
if you’re heading straight to the beach or to a hotel either in 
Alajuela or north of the Interamerican Highway.
Arriving by bus
San José is connected to all other major Central American hub cities by 
a couple of bus lines. Transnica (% 2223-4242; www.transnica.com; 
Calle 22, between avenidas 3 and 5) and Tica Bus Company (% 2221-
0006; www.ticabus.com; Avenida 3 and Calle 26) both service San José 
directly from Panama City and Managua, with onward connections to 
most other major Central American cities. Buy your ticket in advance — 
several days in advance if you plan to travel on weekends or holidays.
Buses arriving from Panama pass first through Cartago and San Pedro 
before letting passengers off in downtown San José; buses arriving from 
Nicaragua generally enter the city on the west end of town, on Paseo 
Colón. If you’re staying here, you can ask to be let off before the final 
stop.
Arriving by car
If you’re intrepid enough to be arriving by car, you’ll be entering San 
José via the Interamerican Highway. If you arrive from Nicaragua and 
the north, you’ll find that the highway brings you first past the airport 
and the city of Alajuela, to the western edge of downtown, right at the 
end of Paseo Colón, where it hits Parque La Sabana (La Sabana Park). 
This area is well marked with large road signs, which direct you either 
to the downtown (centro) or to the western suburbs of Rhormerser, 
Pavas, and Escazú. If you’re heading downtown, just follow the flow of 
traffic and turn left on Paseo Colón.
If you’re entering from Panama and the south, things get a little more 
complicated. The Interamerican Highway first passes through the city of 
Cartago and then through the San José suburbs of Curridabat and San 
Pedro before reaching downtown. This route is relatively well marked, 
and if you stick with the major flow of traffic, you should find San José 
without any problem. If you get lost, feel free to stop and ask directions. 
If you don’t speak any Spanish, repeating the phrase San José centro 
should get you pointed toward downtown.
Orienting Yourself in San José
Downtown San José is laid out on a grid. Avenidas (avenues) run east 
and west, while calles (streets) run north and south. The center of the 
city is at Avenida Central and Calle Central. To the north of Avenida 
Central, the avenidas have odd numbers beginning with Avenida 1; to 
the south, they have even numbers beginning with Avenida 2. Likewise, 

 Chapter 11: Settling into San José 95
calles to the east of Calle Central have odd numbers, and those to the 
west have even numbers.
The main downtown artery is Avenida 2, which merges with Avenida 
Central on either side of the downtown area. West of downtown, Avenida 
Central becomes Paseo Colón, which ends at Parque La Sabana and feeds 
into the highway to Alajuela, the airport, and the Pacific coast. East of 
downtown, Avenida Central leads to San Pedro and then to Cartago and the 
Interamerican Highway heading south. Calle 3 takes you out of town to the 
north and puts you on the Guápiles Highway out to the Caribbean coast.
Introducing the neighborhoods
San José is spread out and sprawling. It’s divided into dozens of neigh-
borhoods known as barrios. Only a handful of these are of any interest 
or concern for visitors. This section gives you a quick rundown of the 
major barrios or neighborhoods in San José. I mention only the best-
known barrios — meaning the ones that you’re most likely to stay in or 
visit. Most are close to the central downtown area, but some are located 
on the outskirts or are considered close-in suburbs.
Downtown
In San José’s busy downtown, you’ll find most of the city’s museums, as 
well as a handful of small urban parks and open-air plazas. Many tour 
companies, restaurants, and hotels are also located here. Unfortunately, 
gridlocked traffic and heavy exhaust fumes make this one of the least 
pleasant parts of the city. Streets and avenues are usually bustling and 
crowded with pedestrians and vehicular traffic, and street crime is most 
rampant here. The sections of Avenida Central between calles 6 and 7, 
as well as Avenida 4 between calles 9 and 14, have been converted into a 
pedestrian malls, slightly improving things on these stretches.
Barrio Amón and Barrio Otoya
These two picturesque neighborhoods, just north and east of down-
town, are the site of the greatest concentration of historic buildings in 
San José. Some of these have been renovated and turned into hotels and 
restaurants. If you’re looking for character and don’t mind the noise and 
exhaust fumes from passing cars and buses, this neighborhood makes a 
good base for exploring the city.
La Sabana/Paseo Colón
Paseo Colón, a wide boulevard west of downtown, is an extension of 
Avenida Central and ends at Parque La Sabana. It has several good, 
small hotels and numerous restaurants. This is also where several of the 
city’s car-rental agencies have their in-town offices. Once the site of the 
city’s main airport, the Parque La Sabana is San José’s largest public 
park, with ample green areas, jogging paths, an urban “canopy tour,” 
sport facilities, and a couple of small ponds. At the juncture of Paseo 
Colón and Parque La Sabana sits the Costa Rican Art Museum.

Part III: San José and the Central Valley 
98
San Pedro, Los Yoses, and Barrio Escalante
Located just east of downtown, Los Yoses and Barrio Escalante are 
upper-middle-class neighborhoods that are home to many diplomatic 
missions and embassies. San Pedro is a little farther east and is the site 
of the University of Costa Rica. There are numerous college-type bars 
and restaurants all around the edge of the campus, as well as several 
good restaurants and small hotels in both neighborhoods.
Escazú, Santa Ana, and Ciudad Colón
Located in the hills west of San José, Escazú, Santa Ana, and Ciudad 
Colón are fast-growing, mostly affluent suburbs. Although the area is 
only 10 to 20 minutes from San José by taxi, it feels much farther away 
because of its slightly more rural atmosphere. This area has a large 
expatriate community, with many bed-and-breakfast establishments and 
excellent restaurants.
“I know a number is here somewhere . . .”: 
The arcane art of finding an address in 
San José
Finding an address is one of the most confusing aspects of visiting Costa Rica in gen-
eral, and San José in particular. Although street addresses and occasional building 
numbers are often listed for locations in downtown San José, they’re almost never 
used. Addresses are given as a set of coordinates such as “Calle 3 between avenidas 
Central and 1.” It’s then up to you to locate the building within that block, keeping in 
mind that the building could be on either side of the street.
Many addresses or directions forego street names and numbers altogether and rely on 
more colloquial information, such as the number of meters from a specified intersection 
or some other well-known landmark. (Don’t get hung up on exact measurements; in 
Costa Rica, 100m = 1 block, 200m = 2 blocks, and so on.) The landmarks are what 
become truly confusing for visitors to Costa Rica because they’re often simply restau-
rants, bars, and shops that would be familiar only to locals.
Things get even more confusing when the landmark in question no longer exists. The 
classic example of this is “the Coca-Cola,” one of the most common landmarks used in 
addresses in the blocks surrounding San José’s main market. The trouble is, the Coca-
Cola bottling plant that it refers to is no longer there; the edifice is long gone, and one 
of the principal downtown bus depots stands in its place. Old habits die hard, though, 
and the address description remains.
You may also try to find some place near the antiguo higuerón (old fig tree) in San Pedro. 
This tree was felled years ago. In outlying neighborhoods, addresses can become long 
directions such as “50m south of the old church, then 100m east, then 20m south.” 
Luckily for the visitor, most downtown addresses are more straightforward.

 Chapter 11: Settling into San José 99
Heredia, Alajuela, and the airport area
Heredia and Alajuela are two colonial-era cities that lie closer to the 
airport than San José. Alajuela is the closest city to the airport, with 
Heredia lying about midway between Alajuela and the capital. Several 
quite beautiful high-end boutique hotels are found here. Several large, 
modern hotels are located on, or just off, the Interamerican Highway 
close to the airport.
Finding information after you arrive
The Costa Rican Tourism Institute, or Instituto Costarricense de 
Turismo (ICT; % 2443-1535; www.visitcostarica.com) has a desk at 
the Juan Santamaría International Airport, located in the baggage claims 
area, just before Customs. You can pick up maps and browse brochures, 
and they may even lend you a phone to make or confirm a reservation. 
It’s open daily from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m.
If you’re looking for the main ICT visitor information center in San 
José, it’s located below the Plaza de la Cultura, at the entrance to the 
Oro Museum (Gold Museum), on Calle 5 between avenidas Central and 2 
(% 2222-1090). The people there are helpful, although the information 
they have to offer is rather limited. This office is open Monday through 
Friday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Getting Around San José
You’ve got plenty of options for getting around San José. In most 
instances, a taxi will be your best bet. But in this section, I also tell you 
how to navigate the city by bus, rental car, and foot.
By taxi
Taxis are an easy and inexpensive way to get around San José. Although 
taxis in San José have marías (meters), the drivers sometimes refuse to 
use them, particularly with foreigners, so you’ll occasionally have to 
negotiate the price. Always try to get them to use the meter first (say, 
“Ponga la maría, por favor”). The official rate at press time is around 80¢ 
for the first kilometer (1⁄2 mile) and around 60¢ for each additional kilo-
meter. If you have a rough idea of how far it is to your destination, you 
can estimate how much it should cost from these figures. After 10 p.m., 
taxis are legally allowed to add a 20 percent surcharge. Some of the 
meters are programmed to include the extra charge automatically, but 
be careful: Some drivers will use the evening setting during the daytime 
or to try to charge an extra 20 percent on top of the higher meter 
setting.
 
 Tipping taxi drivers is not expected. Also, it’s not uncommon for passen-
gers to sit in the front seat with the driver.

Part III: San José and the Central Valley 
100
Depending on your location, the time of day, and the weather (rain places 
taxis at a premium), it’s relatively easy to hail a cab downtown. You’ll 
always find taxis in front of the Teatro Nacional (National Theater) and 
around Parque Central (Central Park) at Avenida Central and Calle 
Central. Taxis in front of hotels and the El Pueblo tourist complex usu-
ally try to charge more than others, although this is technically illegal. 
Most hotels will gladly call you a cab, either for a downtown excursion 
or for a trip back out to the airport. You can also get a cab by calling 
Coopetaxi (% 2235-9966), Coopeirazu (% 2254-3211), or Coopeguaria 
(% 2227-9300). Cinco Estrellas Taxi (% 2228-3159) is another company 
that is based in Escazú, but it services the entire metropolitan area and 
airport and claims to always have an English-speaking operator on call.
By bus
 
 Bus transportation around San José is cheap — the fare is usually some-
where around 10¢ to 50¢ (although the Alajuela/San José buses that run 
in from the airport cost 75¢). However, be forewarned: Costa Rica’s 
urban buses tend to be overcrowded, slow, and in poor condition. 
Moreover, they’re often frequented by pickpockets and petty thieves. So 
if you do opt to take the local public transportation, be alert and careful.
The most important buses are those running east along Avenida 2 and 
west along Avenida 3. The Sabana/Cementerio bus runs from Parque La 
Sabana to downtown and is one of the most convenient buses to use. 
You’ll find a bus stop for the outbound Sabana/Cementerio bus near the 
main post office on Avenida 3 near the corner of Calle 2 and another one 
on Calle 11 between avenidas Central and 1. This bus also has stops all 
along Avenida 2. San Pedro buses leave from Avenida Central between 
calles 9 and 11, in front of the Cine Capri, and take you out of downtown 
heading east. Escazú- and Santa Ana–bound buses leave from the Coca-
Cola bus station, as well as from Avenida 1 between calles 24 and 28. 
Alternatively, you can pick up both the Escazú and Santa Ana buses, as 
well as those bound for Alajuela and the airport, from the busy bus stop 
on Calle 42, just north of Gimnasio Nacional.
 
 Board buses from the front. The bus drivers can make change, although 
they don’t like to receive large bills. Remember: Be especially mindful of 
your wallet, purse, or other valuables because pickpockets often work 
the crowded buses.
By car
 
 In general, I consider it a liability for visitors to rent a car while in San 
José. The city streets are poorly marked and congested, Costa Rican 
drivers tend to be aggressive, and traffic laws as well as basic norms of 
road courtesy are generally ignored. Relying on taxis is much easier and 
more economical.

 Chapter 11: Settling into San José 101
Renting a car in San José will cost you between $45 and $140 per day 
(the higher prices are for four-wheel-drive vehicles). Many car-rental 
agencies have offices at the airport, as well as downtown. Regardless, 
almost all will either meet you at the airport or deliver the car to any 
San José hotel. See Chapter 7 for more information on renting a car in 
Costa Rica.
On foot
Downtown San José is quite compact. Even so, aside from touring a few 
heavily trafficked tourist areas in broad daylight, I don’t recommend 
exploring San José by foot. Street crime is a real problem; because most 
visitors stand out prominently, they are targets. The best places to stroll 
around downtown are the two main plazas — Plaza de la Democracia 
and Plaza de la Cultura — and the pedestrian-only sections of Avenida 
Central between calles Central and 7, and Avenida 4 between calles 
9 and 14.
Where to Stay in San José
You’ll find a wide range of hotel options in San José, ranging from com-
fortable and homey budget lodgings to unique boutique hotels housed 
in restored colonial-era mansions to large modern resort hotels. Most 
hotels in San José are moderately priced, including some of the best of 
the bunch.
 
 If you’re heading out to Guanacaste, the central Pacific, or the northern 
zone, you may want to consider a hotel either near or beyond the air-
port. Sure, you give up proximity to downtown, but you can cut as much 
as an hour off your travel time to any of these destinations.
 
 Apart from the large, modern hotels and chains, few hotels in San José 
come with air-conditioning. Even many of the more expensive boutique 
hotels lack air-conditioning. The good news, given the mild, temperate 
climate, is that this is really not a problem for most people. If you abso-
lutely must have air-conditioning, be sure to inquire in advance whether 
your room will have it.
The following list features a wide range of choices to suit any budget. I 
also list a selection of hotels from various neighborhoods, including 
hotels close to the airport and others just slightly out of downtown.
Prices for recommended hotels are designated with dollar signs — the 
more you see, the more expensive the hotel. Check the introduction to 
this book for how the dollar-sign system works. Also, see Chapter 8 for 
tips on booking your accommodations.

Clarion Amón Plaza
$$$–$$$$ Barrio Amón
This business-class hotel is larger and more modern than the nearby bou-
tique options. Nothing particularly stands out about the property or 
rooms here; however, in terms of service, location, and price, this hotel 
gets my nod over the nearby Holiday Inn. The rooms are all large and well 
kept, and they come with plenty of amenities, including wireless Internet 
connections. The hotel features a small exercise room, a casino, free Wi-Fi 
throughout and a lovely, open-air, sidewalk restaurant. You’re also close 
to all the downtown action here.

 Finca Rosa Blanca Coffee Plantation & Inn
$$$$–$$$$$ Santa Bárbara de Heredia
Finca Rosa Blanca is an eclectic architectural confection set amid the lush, 
green hillsides of a coffee plantation. Square corners have seemingly been 
prohibited in the design of this beautiful hotel. Instead, you’ll find turrets 
and curving walls of glass, arched windows, and a semicircular built-in 
couch. Everywhere the glow of polished hardwood blends with blindingly 
white stucco walls and brightly painted murals.
Inside, plenty of original artwork lines the walls, and each room is decid-
edly unique. El Guarumo (The Cecropia) has a delightful handcrafted tile 
tub built into a nook with great views, while La Ventana (The Window) 
features a hand-painted mural of a window over the room’s queen-size 
bed. If breathtaking bathrooms are your idea of the ultimate luxury, con-
sider splurging on the master suite, which has a stone waterfall that cas-
cades into a tub in front of a huge picture window. This suite also has a 
spiral staircase that leads to the top of a turret, where the master bed-
room is located. The separate villas have the same sense of eclectic 
luxury, with quite a bit of space and privacy. All rooms are nonsmoking 
and have free Wi-Fi.
The small outdoor pool sits on a gentle hillside, and a Jacuzzi rests on the 
roof of the main building. The hotel has 14 hectares of organic coffee 
under cultivation, and its in-house coffee tour is not to be missed. In 2008, 
the hotel added a full-service spa, and a large restaurant and outdoor 
dining area, with excellent views over the valley and city below.

 Hotel Aranjuez
$ Barrio Amón
This is the best budget option close to downtown. Located on a quiet and 
safe street on the outskirts of the Barrio Amón neighborhood, this humble 
hotel is made up of five contiguous houses. The rooms are all simple and 
clean, although some are a little dark. Both the rooms and bathrooms vary 
greatly in size, so be very specific when reserving, or ask to see a few 
rooms when you arrive. The cheapest rooms here share a couple of com-
munal bathrooms. The best features, aside from the convivial hostel-like 
atmosphere, are the lush and shady gardens; the hanging orchids, brome-
liads, and ferns decorating the hallways and nooks; and the numerous open 
lounge areas furnished with chairs, tables, and couches — great for lazing 
around and sharing travel tales with your fellow guests. The hotel has a 
couple of computers, as well as Wi-Fi throughout, and both are offered free.

Hotel Britannia
$$ Barrio Amón
This is the most luxurious of the many boutique hotels that have been 
created from restored old houses in Barrio Amón. Built in 1910, the large, 
low building, with its wraparound veranda, is also one of the area’s most 
attractive hotels. Along with the restored old home, a four-story addition 
is separated from the original building by a narrow atrium. Rooms in the 
old section have hardwood floors and furniture; high ceilings and fans 
help keep them cool. In the deluxe rooms and junior suites, you get air-
conditioning, one king- or two queen-size beds, and, in the case of the 
junior suites, a minibar. The standards come with either one king or two 
twin beds. Although the street-side rooms have double glass, light sleep-
ers will still want to avoid them. The quietest rooms are those toward the 
back of the newer addition. In what was once a wine cellar, you’ll find a 
casual restaurant.

 Hotel Don Carlos
$$ Barrio Amón
If you’re looking for an affordable, small hotel that is unmistakably Costa 
Rican and hints at the days of the planters and coffee barons, this is the 
place for you. Located in an old residential neighborhood, only blocks 

Part III: San José and the Central Valley 
104
from the heart of downtown, the Don Carlos is popular with both vacation-
ers and businesspeople. A large reproduction of a pre-Columbian carved-
stone human figure stands outside the front door of this gray inn, which 
was a former president’s mansion. Inside you’ll find many more such 
reproductions, as well as orchids, ferns, paintings, and parrots. The rooms 
are distinct and vary greatly in size, so be specific when you reserve, or 
ask if it’s possible to see a few when you check in. You’ll also find a sooth-
ing ten-person Jacuzzi and an outdoor orchid garden and atrium where 
breakfast is served. The gift shop here is one of the largest in the country, 
and guests have free use of the hotel’s computers and Wi-Fi network.

 Hotel Grano de Oro
$$–$$$$ Paseo Colón
San José boasts dozens of old homes that have been converted into bou-
tique hotels, but this one is my favorite. Located on a quiet side street off 
Paseo Colón, this small hotel offers a variety of room types to fit most 
budgets and tastes. I prefer the patio rooms, which have French doors 
opening onto private patios. However, if you want a room with more 
space, ask for one of the deluxe rooms, which also have large, modern, 
tiled bathrooms with big tubs. All rooms are nonsmoking. Throughout all 
the guest rooms, you find attractive hardwood furniture, including old-
fashioned wardrobes in some rooms. For additional luxuries, you can stay 
in one of the suites, which have whirlpool tubs. If you don’t grab a suite, 
you still have access to the hotel’s two rooftop Jacuzzis. The hotel’s gor-
geous restaurant is set around a spacious interior courtyard and serves 
excellent international cuisine and some of the best desserts in the city.

 Hotel Le Bergerac
$$–$$$ Los Yoses
Charming and sophisticated, the Hotel Le Bergerac has ingratiated itself 
over the years with business travelers and members of various diplomatic 
missions. These guests have found a tranquil environment in a quiet sub-
urban neighborhood, spacious and comfortable accommodations, per-
sonal service, and gourmet meals. Still, you don’t have to be a diplomat or 
business traveler to enjoy this hotel’s charms. Le Bergerac is composed 
of three houses with courtyard gardens in between. Almost all the rooms 
are quite large, and each is a little different. My favorite rooms are those 
with private patio gardens or balconies.

Hotel Presidente
$$–$$$ Downtown
This modern business-class hotel is a good midrange option in the dead 
center of downtown. Although the hotel’s eight stories practically qualify 
it for skyscraper status, very few of the rooms have any view to speak of; 
those with north-facing windows are your best bet. Rooms are all clean 
and modern and feature the basic amenities you’d expect. Most rooms 
come with one double and one single bed. If you want more space, opt for 
one of the junior suites. The master suite is a massive two-bedroom, fea-
turing a wide-screen TV in the living room and a private eight-person 
Jacuzzi. A popular, casual, cafe-style restaurant is located just off the 
street.

 Hotel Santo Tomás
$–$$ Downtown
Even though it’s on a busy downtown street that gets quite sketchy after 
dark, this converted mansion is a quiet oasis inside. Built over 100 years 
ago by a coffee baron, the house has been lovingly restored and main-
tained by its owner, Thomas Douglas. Throughout the hotel, you’ll enjoy 
the deep, dark tones of well-aged and well-worked wood. The rooms vary 
in size, but most are fairly spacious and have a small table and chairs. All 
rooms are nonsmoking and feature free Wi-Fi. Skylights in some bath-
rooms will brighten your morning, and firm beds provide a good night’s 
sleep. The hotel has a couple of patio areas, as well as a lounge and com-
bination breakfast room and outdoor bar. A small kidney-shaped pool 
rests outside with a Jacuzzi above it; the two are solar heated and con-
nected by a tiny waterslide. The staff and management are extremely help-
ful with tour arrangements and any other needs or requests, and the 
restaurant here is excellent.

Hands down, the Marriott is the top large luxury resort hotel in the San 
José metropolitan area. The hotel is designed in a mixed colonial style, 
with hand-painted Mexican tiles; antique red-clay roof tiles; weathered 
columns; and heavy wooden doors, lintels, and trim. The centerpiece is a 
large open-air interior patio, which somewhat replicates Old Havana’s 
Plaza de Armas. The rooms are all comfortable and well appointed, with 
either a king-size bed or two double beds, two telephones, a working desk, 
an elegant wooden armoire holding a large TV, plenty of closet space, a

comfortable sitting chair and ottoman, and a Juliet balcony. The bath-
rooms are up to par but feel slightly small for this price. Amenities are 
plentiful, and service here reaches a level of attention to detail uncommon 
in Costa Rica. Kids love the two large pools, and this is one of the few San 
José options with dependable baby-sitting services.

 Peace Lodge
$$$$–$$$$$ Varablanca
The rooms here are some of the most impressive in the country — the 
bathrooms in the deluxe units easily earn that distinction alone. The lodge 
is an outgrowth of the popular La Paz Waterfall Gardens, which features a 
host of attractions and activities to please the entire family (see Chapter 
12 for more information). The rooms are large and feature sparkling wood 
floors and trim, handcrafted four-poster beds, beautiful stone fireplaces, 
intricately sculpted steel light fixtures, and a host of other creative 
touches and details. Each room has a private balcony fitted with a mosaic-
tiled Jacuzzi. The aforementioned deluxe bathrooms come with a second 
oversize Jacuzzi set under a skylight in the middle of an immense room 
that features a full interior wall planted with ferns, orchids, and bromeli-
ads and fed by a functioning waterfall system. The lodge is located about 
45 minutes from the airport. Peace Lodge was right near the epicenter of 
a major 6.2 earthquake in January 2009. However, the installations here 
and at the Waterfall Gardens escaped with very minor damage.

Vista del Valle Plantation Inn
$$–$$$ Alajuela
If you have little need for San José and are looking for a comfortable base 
for exploring the rest of Costa Rica, consider this fine little country inn. 
The architecture has a strong Japanese influence. The rooms are all either 
independent or duplex villas. All are open and airy, with lots of windows 
letting in lots of light. You also find plenty of varnished woodwork, small 
kitchenettes (in some), and comfortable wraparound decks here. My 
favorites are the Mona Lisa and Ylang-Ylang suites, which are octagonal 
in shape and set on the edge of the bluff with impressive views over the 
Río Grande and its steep-walled canyon. The grounds are wonderfully 
landscaped, with several inviting seating areas set among a wealth of flow-
ering tropical plants. You can lounge around the lovely outdoor pool, take 
a hike or horseback-ride, and even play tennis here. The hotel is located 
20 minutes north of the Juan Santamaría International Airport, and staying

Xandari Resort & Spa

Xandari is yet another architecturally stunning small hotel not far from 
the airport. Set on a high hilltop above the city of Alajuela, Xandari com-
mands wonderful views of the surrounding coffee farms and the Central 
Valley below. The villas are huge private spaces with high-curved ceilings, 
stained-glass windows, and handmade fine furniture. All come with both 
an outdoor patio with a view and a private covered palapa (straw 
umbrella), as well as a smaller interior terrace with chaise lounges. Most 
have king-size beds; the rest have two queens. All rooms boast spacious 
living rooms with rattan sofas and chairs, as well as small kitchenettes. 
The owners are artists, and their original works and innovative design 
touches abound. The hotel grounds contain several miles of trails that 
pass by at least five jungle waterfalls, as well as lush gardens and fruit 
orchards. The adjacent “spa village” features a series of private thatch-
roofed treatment rooms, many with their own Jacuzzi, and most with stun-
ning views. A wide range of spa and beauty treatments is offered, in 
addition to yoga and other fitness classes.

Where to Dine in San José
Although the Costa Rican cuisine and the local dining scene are easily 
disparaged and dismissed, still some creative chefs have been trying to 
educate and enlighten the Costa Rican palate, particularly in San José. 
Many have begun using fresh local ingredients in new and exciting ways. 
The early results are quite promising. In addition, many excellent restau-
rants now serve international cuisines ranging from Italian and Asian, to 
Peruvian and even Indian. I list the best of the local restaurant scene in 

Part III: San José and the Central Valley 
110
this section, with options ranging from typical Tico fare to eclectic 
fusion cuisine.
Reservations are only necessary in a handful of upscale or very popular 
restaurants, and in these cases I note the fact in the restaurant’s infor-
mation section.
You’ll find several good restaurants in the downtown, Barrio Amón, and 
San Pedro neighborhoods. Escazú and Santa Ana, two popular upscale 
suburbs, boast the greatest number of interesting, creative, and varied 
options.
See Chapter 2 for information on Costa Rican cuisine and Chapter 5 for 
information on budgeting for meals.
 
 Bacchus
$$$–$$$$ Santa Ana ITALIAN
This is my favorite Italian restaurant in the metro area. At first glance, you 
may not realize the restaurant is housed in a historic home that is over a 
century old. On closer inspection, you’ll appreciate how the classic and 
contemporary blend seamlessly in an elegant atmosphere. The best tables 
are on the covered back patio, where you can watch the open kitchen and 
wood-burning pizza oven in action. The menu features a range of antipasti, 
pastas, pizzas, and main dishes. Everything is perfectly prepared and 
beautifully presented. The desserts are also excellent, and the wine list is 
extensive and fairly priced.

 Café del Teatro Nacional
$$ Downtown COFFEEHOUSE
Housed in a spacious room off the main lobby of the Teatro Nacional 
(National Theater), this is an elegant little coffeehouse. Even if there’s no 
show on during your visit, you can enjoy a light meal, sandwich, dessert, 
or cup of coffee here, while soaking up the neoclassical atmosphere. The 
theater was built in the 1890s from the designs of European architects, 
and the Art Nouveau chandeliers, ceiling murals, and marble floors and 
tables are pure Parisian. The ambience is French-cafe chic, but the 
marimba music drifting in from outside the open window and the chang-
ing art exhibits by local artists will remind you that you’re still in Costa 
Rica. On sunny days, outdoor seating opens up at wrought-iron tables on 
the side of the theater. In addition to the regular hours of operation, the 
cafe is open until 8 p.m. any evening that there is a performance in the 
theater.

Café Mundo
$$–$$$ Barrio Amón INTERNATIONAL
This is a beautiful and lively spot to grab a meal. Wood tables and Art 
Deco wrought-iron chairs are spread spaciously around several rooms 
and open-air verandas in this former colonial mansion. The appetizers 
include vegetable tempura, crab cakes, and chicken satay, alongside more 
traditional Tico standards such as patacones (fried plantain chips) and 
fried yuca. A long list of pastas and pizzas, as well as more substantial 
main courses, round out the menu. One room here boasts colorful wall 
murals by Costa Rican artist Miguel Cassafont. This place is almost always 
filled to brimming with a broad mix of San José’s bohemian, theater, arts, 
gay, and university crowds.

Cafeteria 1930
$–$$ Downtown INTERNATIONAL
Fronting the Plaza de la Cultura, the open-air section of this simple hotel 
restaurant is probably the best people-watching spot in the city. A 
wrought-iron railing, white columns, and arches create an old-world atmo-
sphere, and a marimba band often plays right in front. It’s open 24 hours 
a day. Stop by for breakfast and watch the plaza vendors set up their 
booths, or peruse the Tico Times over coffee while you have your shoes 
polished. The menu is basic and the food is unspectacular, but you won’t 
find a better place downtown to bask in the tropical sunshine while you 
sip a beer or have a light lunch. This is also a great place to come just 
before or after a show at the Teatro Nacional.

 Grano de Oro Restaurant
$$$–$$$$ Paseo Colón CONTINENTAL
This is one of the most elegant and romantic restaurants in the city. 
Tables are spread around several rooms ringing a small, open-air central 
courtyard. When the weather’s nice, you can also grab a seat inside the 
courtyard. The menu features a wide range of meat and fish dishes. The 
lomito piemontes is two medallions of filet mignon stuffed with Gorgonzola 
cheese in a sherry sauce, while the pernil de conejo is a rabbit thigh stuffed 
with a mushroom pâté, served with Dijon mustard sauce. If you opt for 
fish, I recommend the macadamia-encrusted corvina, which is served with 
a light and tangy orange sauce. Be sure to save room for the Grano de Oro 
pie, a decadent dessert with various layers of chocolate and coffee 
mousses and creams.

 La Cava Grill
$$–$$$ Escazú COSTA RICAN/STEAKHOUSE
This is a cozy and casual joint housed underneath the popular, yet over-
priced and overrated, Le Monastère restaurant. Although the décor is 
much less ornate, the service much less formal, and the menu much less 
French, the view is still just as spectacular. Grab one of the window seats 
here on a clear night and enjoy the sparkle of the lights below. The menu 
features a range of simply prepared meat, poultry, and fish. More-
adventurous diners can try the tepesquintl, a large rodent that is actually 
quite tasty. You’ll find live music and a festive party most weekend nights 
in the attached bar.

La Luz serves up excellent fusion cuisine, mixing fresh local ingredients 
with the best of a whole host of international ethnic influences. The fiery 
garlic prawns are sautéed in ancho-chile oil and sage and served over a 
roasted-garlic potato mash. Then the whole thing is served with a garnish 
of fried leeks and a tequila-lime butter and cilantro-oil sauce. I also enjoy 
the beef tenderloin in a strawberry-balsamic reduction, served over a 
champagne-infused risotto. The glass-walled dining room is one of the 
most elegant in town, with a view of the city lights. The wait staff is atten-
tive and knowledgeable. On top of all this, you get nightly specials and a 
wide selection of inventive appetizers and desserts.

La Mar Cebicheria
$$$ Santa Ana PERUVIAN/FUSION
This is the latest outpost of famed Peruvian chef and restaurateur Gastón 
Acurio’s growing international empire. A refined take on Lima’s typical 
street food and ceviche restaurants, you can get a variety of marinated 
seafood concoctions here. I recommend the Nikkei, which features chunks 
of raw tuna in a tangy sesame-soy marinade. Though there are a host of 
main dishes on the menu, the strong suit here are fusion takes on a range 
of traditional Peruvian appetizers — tiraditos, anticuchos, causas — which 
makes this a great place to pick and share amongst friends, while enjoying 
the tasty (and strong) pisco sours.

Machu Picchu
$$ Paseo Colón PERUVIAN
Machu Picchu is an unpretentious little hole in the wall that has become 
one of the most popular restaurants in San José. One of my favorite 
entrees is the causa limeña, lemon-flavored mashed potatoes stuffed with 
shrimp. The ceviche is excellent, as is the ají de gallina, a dish of shredded 
chicken in a fragrant cream sauce, and octopus with garlic butter. For 
main dishes, I recommend corvina a lo macho, sea bass in a slightly spicy 
tomato-based seafood sauce. Be sure to ask for a pisco sour, a classic 
Peruvian drink made from pisco, a grape liquor. These folks have a sister 
restaurant over in San Pedro (% 2283-3679).

 Olio
$–$$ Los Yoses TAPAS
Exposed brick walls, dark-wood wainscoting, and stained-glass lamps 
imbue this place with character and romance. Couples will want to grab a 
table in a quiet nook, while groups tend to gravitate toward the large main 
room or the bar. The extensive tapas menu features traditional Spanish 
fare, as well as bruschetta, antipasti, and a Greek mezza plate. For a main 
dish, I recommend the chicken Vesubio, which is marinated first in a bal-
samic vinegar reduction and finished with a creamy herb sauce, or the 
arrollado siciliano, which is a thin filet of steak rolled around spinach, sun-
dried tomatoes, and mozzarella cheese and topped with a pomodoro 
sauce. The midsize wine list features fairly priced wines from Italy, France, 
Spain, Germany, Chile, Greece, and even Bulgaria.

fusion cuisine in an intimate space spread around the interior patio court-
yard of a stately old downtown mansion, which also doubles as an 
antiques and imported furniture store. The menu changes regularly but 
might feature roasted scallops with ricotta tortellini in a pumpkin jus, or 
some expertly grilled quail on a vegetable purée bed, topped with poached 
quail egg. Presentations are artfully done and often served in such a way

 Restaurante Nuestra Tierra
$ Downtown COSTA RICAN
The décor at this two-story place seeks to imitate a humble country ranch 
kitchen, with heavy wooden tables, chairs, and paneling, and strings of 
fresh onions and bunches of bananas hung from the rafters and columns. 
Service is friendly and efficient, dressed in typical campesino dress, they 
periodically break out into traditional folkloric dances. Sure, it’s touristy, 
but if you want a casado or some gallo pinto, anytime of the day or night, 
this is the place to come. The biggest downside here is that the restaurant 
fronts the very busy Avenida 2, so head for a second-floor table away from 
the traffic.

The food is unspectacular, dependable, and quite inexpensive at this land-

as well as on the sidewalk-style patio fronting the parking area, which 
itself fronts a very busy city avenue. Dour but efficient wait staff take the 
order you mark down on your combination menu/bill. This place is great 
for late-night eats or for before or after visits to Parque La Sabana or the

This is the best Pan-Asian restaurant in San José. A long-time local favor-
ite, Tin Jo has a wide and varied menu, with an assortment of Cantonese 
and Szechuan staples; a range of Thai, Japanese, and Malaysian dishes; 
and even some Indian food. The delicious pineapple shrimp in coconut-
milk curry is served in the hollowed-out half of a fresh pineapple. Other 
dishes not to miss include the salt-and-pepper shrimp, beef teriyaki, and 
Thai curries. Tin Jo is also a great option for vegetarians. For dessert, try 
the sticky rice with mango or the banana tempura. The waiters here are 
some of the most attentive in Costa Rica. The décor features artwork and 
textiles from across Asia, and you’ll have real tablecloths and cloth

$$ Barrio Escalante COSTA RICAN/CARIBBEAN
You don’t have to go to Limón or Cahuita to get good home-cooked Costa 
Rican Caribbean food. The menu features a range of regional chicken, 
beef, or fish dishes, and almost all come with a side of the classic 
Caribbean-style rice and beans cooked in coconut milk. I usually go with 
the whole red snapper covered in a spicy sauce of sautéed onions. A small 
bar rests at the entrance and some simple tables are spread around the 
restaurant, with an alcove here and there. Everything is very simple, and 
the prices are quite reasonable. After a dinner of fresh fish, with rice, 
beans, and patacones (fried plantain chips), the only letdown is that the 
beach is some four hours away.

Taking in the view
Although myriad unique experiences can be had in Costa Rica, one of my favorites is 
dining on the side of a volcano, with the lights of San José shimmering below. These 
hanging restaurants, called miradores, are a resourceful response to the city’s topog-
raphy. Because San José is set in a broad valley surrounded on all sides by volcanic 
mountains, people who live in these mountainous areas have no place to go but up — 
so they do, building roadside restaurants vertically up the sides of the volcanoes.
The food at most of these establishments usually isn’t spectacular, but the views often 
are, particularly at night, when the wide valley sparkles in a wash of lights. The town of 
Aserri, 10km (61⁄4 miles) south of downtown San José, is the king of miradores, and 
Mirador Ram Luna (% 2230-3060) is the king of Aserri. Grab a window seat and, if you 
have the fortitude, order a plate of chicharrones (fried pork rinds). Live music — usually 
folk, pop, or jazz — is frequently played here. You can hire a cab for around $9, or take the 
Aserri bus at Avenida 6, between calles Central and 2. Just ask the driver where to get off.
You can also find miradores in the hills above Escazú and in San Ramón de Tres Ríos 
and Heredia. The most popular is Le Monastère (% 2289-4404; closed Sun), an elegant 
converted church serving somewhat overrated French and Belgian cuisine in a spec-
tacular setting in the hills above Escazú. I recommend coming here just for the less 
formal La Cava Grill (see the listing earlier in this chapter), which often features live 
music, ranging from folk to pop to jazz. I also like Mirador Tiquicia (% 2289-5839), 
which occupies several rooms in a sprawling old Costa Rican home and has live folk-
loric dance shows on Thursdays.

Fast Facts: San José
American Express
American Express Travel Services is rep-
resented in Costa Rica by ASV Olympia 
(Oficentro La Sabana, Sabana Sur; % 2242-
8585), which can issue traveler’s checks 
and replacement cards and provide other 
standard services. To report lost or stolen 
American Express traveler’s checks within 
Costa Rica, call the above number or 
% 2295-9000, or call collect to 336-393-
1111 in the United States.
ATM Locators
ATMs are widely available around San 
José. Before you leave home, ask your 
bank to print out a list of ATMs that accept 
your bank card or MasterCard or Visa 
cards. Or check out the following sites: 
http://visa.via.infonow.net/
usa_atm or www.mastercard.com/
cardholderservices/atm.
Business Hours
Banks are usually open Monday through 
Friday from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., although many 
have begun to offer extended hours. 
Offices are open Monday through Friday 
from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. (many close for 1 hour 
at lunch). Stores are generally open 
Monday through Saturday from 9 a.m. to 
6 p.m. (many close for 1 hour at lunch). 
Stores in modern malls generally stay open 
until 8 or 9 p.m. and don’t close for lunch. 
Most bars are open until 1 or 2 a.m.
Currency Exchange
Although a Global Exchange money 
exchange office has opened in the area 
just beyond Customs and Immigration at 
the Juan Santamaría International Airport, 
it gives pretty unfavorable rates. In gen-
eral, few true money-exchange operations 
exist in San José. However, you can 
change money at all state-owned banks 
and private banks. Hotels will often 
exchange money and cash traveler’s 
checks as well, without much waiting 
involved. However, they may shave a few 
colones off the exchange rate.
Be very careful about exchanging money 
on the streets; it’s extremely risky. In addi-
tion to forged bills and short counts, street 
money-changers frequently work in teams 
that can leave you holding neither colones 
nor dollars.
The best way to get cash in Costa Rica is 
with an ATM connected to your debit-card 
account at home.
Dentists
You can call your consulate and ask the 
duty officer to recommend a dentist. Many 
bilingual dentists also advertise in the Tico 
Times. Because treatments are so inex-
pensive in Costa Rica, dental tourism has 
become a popular option for people need-
ing extensive work.
Doctors
Call your consulate and ask the duty offi-
cer to recommend a doctor in San José, or 
see “Hospitals” in this Quick Concierge.
Embassies/Consulates
If you have a passport, immigration, legal, or 
other problem, contact your consulate. The 
following embassies and consulates are 
located in San José: U.S. Embassy, in front 
of Centro Commercial, on the road to Pavas 
(% 2519-2000, or 2220-3127 after hours in 
case of emergency); Canadian Consulate, 
Oficentro Ejecutivo La Sabana, Edificio 5 
(% 2242-4400); and British Embassy, Paseo 
Colón, between calles 38 and 40 (% 2258-
2025). There are no Australian or New 
Zealand embassies in Costa Rica.

 Chapter 11: Settling into San José 117
Emergencies
In case of any emergency, dial % 911 
(which should have an English-speaking 
operator); for an ambulance, call % 128; 
and to report a fire, call % 118. If 911 
doesn’t work, you can contact the police at 
% 2222-1365 or 2221-5337, and they may be 
able to find someone who speaks English.
Hospitals
Clínica Bíblica, Avenida 14 between 
calles Central and 1 (% 2522-1000; www.
clinicabiblica.com), is conveniently 
located close to downtown and has several 
English-speaking doctors. The Hospital 
CIMA (% 2208-1000; www.hospital
sanjose.net), located in Escazú on the 
Próspero Fernández Highway, which con-
nects San José and the western suburb of 
Santa Ana, has the most modern facilities in 
the country.
Information
The Costa Rican Tourism Institute, or Instituto 
Costarricense de Turismo (ICT; % 2443-
1535; www.visitcostarica.com) has 
a desk at the Juan Santamaría International 
Airport, located in the baggage-claims area, 
just before Customs. You can pick up maps 
and browse brochures, and they may even 
lend you a phone to make or confirm a res-
ervation. It’s open daily from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m.
If you’re looking for the main ICT visitor 
information center in San José, it’s located 
below the Plaza de la Cultura, at the 
entrance to the Oro Museum (Gold 
Museum), on Calle 5 between avenidas 
Central and 2 (% 2222-1090). The people 
there are helpful, although the information 
they have to offer is rather limited. This 
office is open Monday through Friday from 
9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Internet Access
Internet cafes can be found all over San 
José. Rates run between 50¢ and $2 per 
hour. Many hotels either have their own 
Internet cafe or Wi-Fi networks or allow 
guests to send and receive e-mail from their 
in-house computers. If your hotel doesn’t 
provide the service, Racsa, Avenida 5 and 
Calle 1 (% 287-0087; www.racsa.co.
cr), the state Internet monopoly, sells pre-
paid cards in 5-, 10-, and 15-hour denomina-
tions for connecting your laptop to the Web 
via a local phone call. Some knowledge of 
configuring your computer’s dial-up connec-
tion is necessary. Be sure to factor in the 
phone-call charge if calling from a hotel.
Laundry and Dry Cleaning
Self-service laundromats are uncommon 
in Costa Rica, and hotel services can be 
expensive. Aqua Matic (% 2291-2847) and 
Tyson (% 2215-2362) are two dependable 
laundry and dry-cleaning chains with outlets 
all over town. The latter will even pick up 
and deliver your clothes free of charge.
Mail
The main correo (post office) is on Calle 2 
between avenidas 1 and 3 (% 800-900-2000 
toll-free in Costa Rica; www.correos.
go.cr) and is open Monday through Friday 
from 8 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. and Saturday from 
7:30 a.m. to noon. At press time, mailing a 
letter to the United States costs 170 colones 
(30¢), and mailing a letter to Europe costs 
190 colones (35¢). Given the Costa Rican 
postal service’s track record, I recommend 
paying an extra 500 colones ($1) to have 
anything of any value certified. Better yet, 
use an international courier service or wait 
until you get home to post it.
Maps
The Costa Rican Tourism Institute (see 
“Information” earlier in this section for loca-
tions) can usually provide you with decent 
maps of both San José and Costa Rica. 
Other sources in San José are Seventh 
Street Books, Calle 7 between avenidas 
Central and 1 (% 2256-8251); Librería 

Part III: San José and the Central Valley 
118
Lehmann, Avenida Central between calles 1 
and 3 (% 2522-4848); and Librería Universal, 
Avenida Central between calles Central and 
1 (% 2222-2222).
Police
Dial % 911 or % 2222-1365 for the police. 
They should have someone who speaks 
English.
Restrooms
Restrooms are known as sanitarios or servi-
cios sanitarios. You may also hear them 
called baños. They’re marked damas 
(women) and hombres or caballeros (men). 
Public restrooms are rare to nonexistent, but 
most big hotels and public restaurants will 
let you use their restrooms. If you’re down-
town, public restrooms are located at the 
entrance to the Museo de Oro.
Safety
Pickpockets and purse slashers are rife in 
San José, especially on public buses, in the 
markets, on crowded sidewalks, and near 
hospitals. Leave your passport, money, and 
other valuables in your hotel safe, and carry 
only as much as you really need when you 
go out. Making a photocopy of your pass-
port’s opening pages and carrying that with 
you is a good idea. If you do carry anything 
valuable with you, keep it in a money belt or 
special passport bag around your neck. Day 
packs are a prime target of brazen pickpock-
ets throughout the city. One common scam 
involves someone dousing you or your pack 
with mustard or ice cream. Another scam-
ster (or two) will then quickly come to your 
aid — they’re usually much more interested 
in cleaning you out than cleaning you up.
Stay away from the red-light district north-
west of the Central Market. Also, be advised 
that Parque Nacional is not a safe place for 
a late-night stroll. Other precautions include 
walking around corner vendors, not between 
the vendor and the building; the tight space 
between the vendor and the building is a 
favorite spot for pickpockets. Never park a 
car on the street, and never leave anything 
of value in a car, even if it’s in a guarded 
parking lot. Don’t even leave your car unat-
tended by the curb in front of a hotel while 
you dash in to check on your reservation. 
With these precautions in mind, you should 
have a safe visit to San José.
Taxes
All hotels charge 13 percent value-added 
tax. Restaurants also charge the 13 percent 
tax and add on a 10 percent service charge, 
for a total of 23 percent more on your bill. A 
$26 departure tax is charged to all visitors 
leaving by air.
Taxis
Taxis are plentiful in San José. Depending 
on your location, the time of day, and the 
weather (rain places taxis at a premium), 
hailing a cab downtown is relatively easy. 
You’ll always find taxis in front of the Teatro 
Nacional and around Parque Central at 
Avenida Central and Calle Central. You 
can also get a cab by calling Coopetaxi 
(% 2235-9966), Coopeirazu (% 2254-3211), 
or Coopeguaria (% 2227-9300). Cinco 
Estrellas Taxi (% 2228-3159) is another 
option; though it’s based in Escazú, it 
services the entire metropolitan area and 
airport and claims to always have an 
English-speaking operator on call.
Although taxis have marías (meters), the 
drivers sometimes refuse to use them, par-
ticularly with foreigners, so you’ll occasion-
ally have to negotiate the price. Always try 
to get them to use the meter first (say, 
“Ponga la maría, por favor”). The official 
rate at press time is around 80¢ for the first 
kilometer (1⁄2 mile) and around 60¢ for each 
additional kilometer. If you have a rough 
idea of how far it is to your destination, you 
can estimate how much it should cost from 
these figures. After 10 p.m., taxis are legally 

 Chapter 11: Settling into San José 119
allowed to add a 20 percent surcharge. For 
more information, see “Getting Around San 
José,” earlier in this chapter.
Telephone/Fax
Costa Rica has an excellent phone system, 
with a dial tone similar to that heard in the 
United States. A phone call within Costa 
Rica costs around 10 colones (20¢) per 
minute. Pay phones take either a phone card 
or 5-, 10-, or 20-colón coins. Phone cards are 
the way to go, as coin-operated phones are 
getting harder to find. You can purchase 
phone cards in a host of gift shops and phar-
macies. However, there are several compet-
ing phone-card companies, and certain 
cards work only with certain phones. CHIP 
phone cards work with a computer chip and 
just slide into specific phones, although 
these phones aren’t widely available. A 
better bet are the 197 and 199 phone cards, 
which are sold in varying denominations. 
These have scratch-off PINs and can be 
used from any phone in the country. In gen-
eral terms, the 197 cards are sold in smaller 
denominations and are used for local calls, 
while the 199 cards are deemed interna-
tional and are easier to find in larger denom-
inations. Either card can be used to make 
any call, however, provided that the card 
can cover the costs. Another perk of the 199 
cards is the fact that you can get the instruc-
tions in English. For local calls, calling from 
your hotel is often easiest, although you’ll 
likely be charged around 100 to 300 colones 
(18¢–54¢) per call.
Numbers beginning with 0800 and 800 within 
Costa Rica are toll-free, but calling an 800 
number in the States from Costa Rica is not 
toll-free. In fact, it costs the same as an 
overseas call.
Water
Tap water in San José is perfectly safe, but 
if you’re prone to stomach problems, you 
may prefer to drink bottled water. If you aim 
to err on the side of caution, avoid ordering 
drinks with ice and eating uncooked fruits or 
vegetables, unless you peel them yourself.

In This Chapter
▶ Taking a guided tour of San José
▶ Checking out the top attractions in San José
▶ Finding the best places to shop
▶ Experiencing San José’s nightlife
▶ Heading out of town for a day trip
M
ost visitors try to get out of San José as fast as possible so they 
can spend more time on the beach or off in the rain forests and 
cloud forests. But if you’ll be in San José for longer than an overnight 
stay, there are plenty of sights and activities to keep you busy. Some of 
the best and most modern museums in Central America are here, with a 
wealth of fascinating pre-Columbian artifacts. Several great things to see 
and do also lie just outside San José in the Central Valley.
Seeing San José by Guided Tour
You shouldn’t have any reasons to take a guided tour of San José. It’s 
so compact that you can easily visit all the major sights on your own. 
The best attractions are all described later in this chapter, and I give 
you a few suggested itineraries later in this chapter as well. However, 
if you want to take a city tour, which will run you between $20 and 
$50, try one of these companies: Costa Rica Sun Tours (% 2296-7757; 
www.crsuntours.com); Horizontes Travel (% 2222-2022; www.
horizontes.com); Gray Line Tours (% 2220-2126; www.grayline
costarica.com); or Swiss Travel Service (% 2282-4898; www.swiss
travelcr.com). These same companies also offer a range of day trips 
out of San José (see “Taking a Day Trip out of San José,” later in this 
chapter). Almost all the major hotels have tour desks, and most of the 
smaller hotels will also help arrange tours and day trips.
Be sure to check out the map in Chapter 11 for help in locating the fol-
lowing listings.

The Top Attractions: Gold Underground 
and Jade in the Skies
Centro Nacional de Arte y Cultura (National Arts and Culture Center)
Downtown
Occupying a full city block, this was once the National Liquor Factory. 
Now it houses the offices of the Cultural Ministry, several performing arts 
centers, and the Museum of Contemporary Art and Design. The latter has 
done an excellent job of promoting cutting-edge Costa Rican and Central 
American artists while also featuring impressive traveling international 
exhibits, including large retrospectives by Mexican painter José Cuevas 
and Ecuadorian painter Oswaldo Guayasamín. If you’re looking for modern 
dance, experimental theater, or a lecture on Costa Rican video, this a good 
place to check. Allow around two hours to take in all the exhibits here.
See map p. 96. Calle 13, between avenidas 3 and 5. % 2257-7202 or 2257-9370. www.
madc.ac.cr. Bus: Any downtown bus. Admission: $1, 60¢ for students with a valid 
ID, free for seniors and children 11 and under. Free for everybody on Mon. Open: 
Mon–Sat 9:30 a.m.–4:45 p.m.
Museo de Arte Costarricense (Museum of Costa Rican Art)
La Sabana
Originally the country’s first major airport terminal, this museum houses 
a collection of works in all media by Costa Rica’s most celebrated artists. 
On display are some exceptionally beautiful pieces in a wide range of 
styles, demonstrating how Costa Rican artists have interpreted and imi-
tated the major European movements over the years. In addition to the 
permanent collection of sculptures, paintings, and prints, regular tempo-
rary exhibits are staged here. If the second floor is open during your visit, 
be sure to go up and have a look at the conference room’s bas-relief walls, 
which chronicle the history of Costa Rica from pre-Columbian times to 
the present. My favorite feature here is the outdoor sculpture garden, 
with works by José Sancho, Jorge Jiménez Deredia, Max Jiménez, and 
Francisco Zuñiga. The museum closed for renovations in 2009, but it’s 
expected to be open again by early 2010. You can easily spend an hour or 
two here — more if you take a stroll through the neighboring park.
See map p. 96. Calle 42 and Paseo Colón, Parque La Sabana Este. % 2222-7155. Bus: 
Sabana-Cementerio. Admission: $5 adults, $3 children and students, free for every-
one on Sun. Open: Tues–Fri 9 a.m.–5 p.m., Sat–Sun 10 a.m.–4 p.m.

Part III: San José and the Central Valley 
122
Museo de Jade Marco Fidel Tristán (Jade Museum)
Downtown
Jade was the most valuable commodity among the pre-Columbian cul-
tures of Mexico and Central America, worth more than gold. This modern 
museum displays a huge collection of jade artifacts dating from 500 b.c. to 
a.d. 800. Many are large pendants that were parts of necklaces and are 
primarily human and animal figures. An extensive collection of pre-Colum-
bian polychromed terra-cotta vases, bowls, and figurines is also on dis-
play. Some of these pieces are amazingly modern in design and exhibit a 
surprisingly advanced technique. Particularly fascinating is a vase that 
incorporates real human teeth and a display that shows how jade was 
embedded in human teeth merely for decorative reasons. All the explana-
tions are in English, as well as Spanish. Allot yourself at least an hour to 
tour this museum.
See map p. 96. Avenida 7 between calles 9 and 9B, 1st floor, INS Building. % 2287-
6034. Bus: Any downtown bus. Admission: $7 adults, free for children 11 and under. 
Open: Mon–Fri 8:30 a.m.–3:30 p.m., Sat 9a.m–1p.m.
 Museo de los Niños (Children’s Museum)
Downtown
A former army barracks and then prison, this museum houses an exten-
sive collection of exhibits designed to edify and entertain children of all 
ages. Many of the exhibits encourage hands-on play. Kids can experience 
a simulated earthquake or make music by dancing across the floor. If 
you’re traveling with children, you’ll definitely want to come here; you 
may want to visit even if you don’t have kids with you. This museum some-
times features limited shows of “serious” art in a side gallery and is also 
the home of the National Auditorium, where gala concerts and recitals are 
often held. You can spend anywhere from one to four hours here, depend-
ing on how much time your children spend at each exhibit. Be careful, 
though: The museum is large and spread out, and losing track of a family 
member or friend is easy.
This museum is located a few blocks north of downtown, on Calle 4. It’s 
within easy walking distance of downtown sites, but you may want to take 
a cab because you’ll have to walk right through the worst part of the red-
light district to get here.
See map p. 96. Calle 4 and Avenida 9. % 2258-4929. www.museocr.com. Bus: Any 
downtown bus. Admission: $2 adults, $1.20 students and children 17 and under. 
Open: Tues–Fri 8 a.m.–4:30 p.m., Sat–Sun 10 a.m.–5 p.m.
Museo de Oro Banco Central (Gold Museum)
Downtown
Located directly beneath the Plaza de la Cultura, this unusual under-
ground museum houses one of the largest collections of pre-Columbian 
gold in the Americas. On display are more than 20,000 troy ounces of gold, 
in more than 2,000 objects. The sheer number of small pieces can be 

 Chapter 12: Exploring San José 123
overwhelming and seem redundant, but the unusual display cases and 
complex lighting systems show off every piece to its utmost. This museum 
complex also includes a gallery for temporary art exhibits, separate coin 
and stamps museums, a modest gift shop, and a branch of the Costa Rican 
Tourist Institute’s information center. Plan to spend between one and two 
hours here.
See map p. 96. Calle 5, between avenidas Central and 2, underneath the Plaza de la 
Cultura. % 243-4202. www.museosdelbancocentral.org. Bus: Any down-
town bus. Admission: $9 adults, $4 students, 80¢ children 11 and under. Open: Daily 
9:30 a.m.–5 p.m.
Museo Nacional de Costa Rica (National Museum)
Downtown
Costa Rica’s most important historical museum is housed in a former 
army barracks that was the scene of fighting during the civil war of 1948. 
You can still see hundreds of bullet holes on the turrets at the corners of 
the building. Inside this traditional Spanish-style courtyard building, you 
find displays on Costa Rican history and culture from pre-Columbian 
times to the present. In the pre-Columbian rooms, you see a 2,500-year-old 
jade carving that is shaped like a seashell and etched with an image of a 
hand holding a small animal.
Among the most fascinating objects unearthed at Costa Rica’s numerous 
archaeological sites are many metates (grinding stones). This type of 
grinding stone is still in use today throughout Central America; however, 
the ones on display here are more ornately decorated than those you’ll 
see anywhere else. Some of the metates are the size of a small bed and are 
believed to have been part of funeral rites. A separate vault houses the 
museum’s collection of pre-Columbian gold jewelry and figurines. In the 
courtyard, you’ll be treated to a wonderful view of the city and see some 
of Costa Rica’s mysterious stone spheres. Taking in the lion’s share of the 
collection here takes about two hours.
See map p. 96. Calle 17, between avenidas Central and 2, on the Plaza de la 
Democracia. % 2257-1433. www.museocostarica.go.cr. Bus: Any down-
town bus. Admission: $6 adults, $3 students and children 11 and under. Open: Tues–
Sat 8:30 a.m.–4 p.m., Sun 9 a.m.–4 p.m. Closed Jan 1, Holy Thursday, Good Friday, 
Easter Sunday, May 1, and Dec 25.
 Spirogyra Butterfly Garden
Downtown
This butterfly garden is smaller and less elaborate than the Butterfly Farm 
(see the listing later in this chapter), but it provides a good introduction 
to the life cycle of butterflies. Moreover, it’s a calm and quiet oasis in a 
noisy and crowded city, quite close to downtown. You’ll spend anywhere 
from a half-hour to several hours here, depending on whether you have 
lunch or refreshments at the small coffee shop and gallery. You’ll be given 
a self-guided tour booklet when you arrive, and an 18-minute video is 

Part III: San José and the Central Valley 
124
shown continuously throughout the day. You’ll find Spyrogyra near El 
Pueblo, a short taxi ride from the center of San José.
See map p. 96. 100m (1 block) east and 150m (11⁄2 blocks) south of El Pueblo Shopping 
Center. %/fax 2222-2937. www.infocostarica.com/butterfly. Bus: Calle 
Blancos bus from Calle 3 and Avenida 5. Admission: $6. Open: Daily 8 a.m.–4 p.m. 
(cafe open until 7:30 p.m.).
More Cool Things to See and Do
San José has several pleasant and inviting downtown parks and plazas. 
Most are very close to one or more major attractions, and they make 
excellent spots to take a break and soak in the sunshine and local color.
The largest of these is Parque La Sabana (La Sabana Park) on the west-
ern edge of downtown. This sprawling park has a network of trails and 
paths used by bikers, joggers, and pedestrians, as well as basketball and 
tennis courts, fútbol (soccer) fields, and baseball diamonds. You’ll also 
find a small outdoor sculpture garden, but this is not to be confused 
with the sculpture garden found at the neighboring Museo de Arte 
Costarricense (Museum of Costa Rican Art). The park boasts excellent 
spots to have a picnic, particularly on the banks of the small ponds, and 
even is home to a small zip-line canopy tour.
In the heart of downtown, the Plaza de la Cultura occupies the space 
between the Teatro Nacional (National Theater) and busy Avenida 
Central. Stepped down on several levels, you’ll find ample park benches, 
which are great places to sit and people-watch. If you have some spare 
change, buy a handful of popcorn to feed the pigeons. Underneath this 
plaza, you’ll find the Museo de Oro Banco Central (Gold Museum). On 
the western edge of this plaza sits the Gran Hotel Costa Rica, with its 
inviting outdoor Cafeteria 1930 (see Chapter 11).
A few blocks east of the Plaza de la Cultura, the Plaza de la Democracia 
occupies a full city block. This concrete affair is a bit stark and dour, 
with just a few undersized trees and a massive bronze sculpture of 
Don Pepe Figueres. Moreover, it’s often very run-down and unkempt. 
However, the plaza does offer a few well-placed benches. The plaza is 
bordered on one side by the Museo Nacional de Costa Rica (National 
Museum) and an extensive outdoor market of handicrafts and other 
assorted souvenirs.
Parque Central (Central Park) is a full city block located off Avenida 2. 
The park is fronted on one side by the Teatro Melico Salazar (Melico 
Salazar Theater) and on another by the Catedral Nacional (National 
Cathedral). In the center of this park is a large gazebo, which on rare 
occasions hosts live music concerts. This park is a very popular lunch-
time spot for local workers.

 Chapter 12: Exploring San José 125
Set between the Legislative Assembly and the National Library, the 
Parque Nacional (National Park) is perhaps the shadiest and most lush 
of the downtown city parks, forgetting the Parque La Sabana, which is in 
another class. At the northeast corner of this park sits the main entrance 
to the Museo Nacional de Arte y Cultura (National Arts and Culture 
Center). This park is delightful on a sunny day, with numerous benches 
and a series of bronze busts of famous historical figures. Be careful at 
night, however — this park is taken over by prostitutes and transves-
tites after dark.
Finally, Parque Morazán (Morazán Park) is another popular downtown 
park, featuring a central gazebo and a series of benches and small 
patches of grass. With several major governmental offices and busi-
nesses nearby, this is also a popular lunchtime meeting spot for local 
workers. I actually prefer the neighboring diminutive Parque España 
(Spain Park), which is shadier, with large stands of bamboo and other 
mature trees. Parque España fronts the INS Building, which houses the 
Museo de Jade Marco Fidel Tristán (Jade Museum), as well as an alter-
native entrance to the Museo Nacional de Arte y Cultura (see earlier in 
this section).
 
 Be especially on guard for pickpockets and street crime while in down-
town San José.
Visiting attractions just outside the city
Several wonderful attractions lie within easy reach of downtown San 
José. Most are able to provide transportation at a reasonable rate. 
Others can be reached by public transportation. Or most can be reached 
by taxi for between $15 and $30 each way.
In addition to the places listed here, other exciting adventures and day 
trips are available out of San José. For a rundown of these, see “Taking a 
Day Trip out of San José,” later in this chapter.
 Butterfly Farm
Alajuela
This is the best butterfly farm and exhibit in the metropolitan area. At any 
given time, you may see around 30 of the 80 different species of butterflies 
raised here. The butterflies live in a large enclosed garden similar to an 
aviary and flutter about the heads of visitors during tours of the gardens. 
You should be certain to spot glittering blue morphos (a large fleet-winged 
butterfly with iridescent blue pigment on its wings) and a large butterfly 
that mimics the eyes of an owl.
The admission includes a two-hour guided tour. In the demonstration 
room, you see butterfly eggs, caterpillars, and pupae. There are cocoons 
trimmed in a shimmering gold color and cocoons that mimic a snake’s

head to frighten away predators. The last guided tour of the day begins at 
3 p.m.
If you reserve in advance, the Butterfly Farm has three daily bus tours that 
run from many major San José hotels. The cost, including round-trip trans-
portation and admission to the garden, is $35 for adults, $30 for students, 
and $20 for children 11 and under. Buses pick up passengers at more than 
20 different hotels in the San José area.
In front of Los Reyes Country Club, La Guácima de Alajuela. % 2438-0400. www.
butterflyfarm.co.cr. Admission: $15 adults, $10 students, $7 children 5–11, 
free for children 4 and under. Open: Daily 8:45 a.m.–3 p.m.
Café Britt Farm
Heredia
Café Britt is one of the leading coffee exporters in Costa Rica, and the 
company has put together a wonderful tour and stage production at its 
farm. Here, you can see how coffee is grown. You also visit the roasting 
and processing plant to learn how a coffee “cherry” is turned into a deli-
cious roasted bean. Tasting sessions are offered for visitors to experience 
the different qualities of coffee. A restaurant and a store are on-site, so you 
can buy coffee and coffee-related gift items. The entire tour, including 
transportation, takes about three to four hours. Allow some extra time 
and an extra $10 for a visit to their nearby working plantation and mill. 
You can even strap on a basket and go out coffee picking during harvest 
time. The folks here offer several full-day options that combine a visit to 
the Britt Farm with a stop at Poás volcano, the Butterfly Farm (see the 
preceding listing), or the Rain Forest Aerial Tram Caribbean (see “Canopy 
tours and the rain-forest aerial tram,” later in this chapter). They’ve also 
begun offering mountain-bike tours in the hills of Heredia above their 
farm, ending with lunch or refreshments at their restaurant.
North of Heredia on the road to Barva. % 2277-1600. www.coffeetour.com. 
Admission: $20 adults, $16 children 6–11; $37 adults and $33 children, including trans-
portation from downtown San José and a coffee drink. Add $15 for a full buffet lunch. 
Open: Store and restaurant daily 8 a.m.–5 p.m., tour daily 11 a.m.
 Else Kientzler Botanical Garden
Sarchi
Located on the grounds of an ornamental flower farm, on the outskirts of 
the tourist town Sarchí, these are extensive, impressive, and lovingly laid-
out botanical gardens. Over 2.5km (11⁄2 miles) of trails run through a col-
lection of more than 2,000 species of flora. All the plants are labeled with 
their Latin names, with some further explanations around the grounds in 
both English and Spanish. The grounds include a topiary labyrinth, as well 
as a variety of lookouts, gazebos, and shady benches. A children’s play 
area features some water games, jungle-gym setups, and a child-friendly 
little zip-line canopy tour. Over 40 percent of the gardens are wheelchair 
accessible.

 Chapter 12: Exploring San José 127
Tuan (% 2258-2004) buses leave San José about five times throughout 
the day for Sarchí from Calle 18 between avenidas 5 and 7. The fare is 
$1.25. Alternatively, you can take any Grecia bus from this same station. 
In Grecia, they connect with the Alajuela-Sarchí buses, leaving every 30 
minutes from Calle 8 between avenidas Central and 1 in Alajuela.
About 6 blocks north of the central fútbol (soccer) stadium in the town of Sarchí, 
Alajuela. % 2454-2070. www.elsegarden.com. Admission: $14 adults, $6 stu-
dents with valid ID and children 5–12. A guided tour costs an extra $15 per guide per 
hour, for a group of up to 15 persons. Advance reservations are necessary for guided 
tours. Open: Daily 8 a.m.–4 p.m.
 INBio Park
Heredia
Run by the National Biodiversity Institute (Instituto Nacional de 
Biodiversidad, or INBio), this place is part museum, part educational 
center, and part nature park. In addition to watching a 15-minute informa-
tional video, visitors can tour two large pavilions explaining Costa Rica’s 
biodiversity and natural wonders, and hike on trails that re-create the 
ecosystems of the forests. A two-hour guided hike is included in the 
entrance fee, and self-guided tour booklets are also available. Other fea-
tures are a good-size butterfly garden, as well as a Plexiglas viewing 
window into the small lagoon. One of my favorite attractions here is the 
series of wonderful animal sculptures donated by one of Costa Rica’s pre-
miere artists, José Sancho. If you get hungry, try the simple cafeteria-style 
restaurant for lunch or the on-site coffee shop. You can easily spend two 
to three hours here.
400m (4 blocks) north and 250m (2 1⁄2 blocks) west of the Shell station in Santo 
Domingo de Heredia. % 2507-8107. www.inbio.ac.cr. Admission: $23 adults, 
$13 children 12 and under. Open: Daily 8 a.m.–6 p.m. INBio Park can arrange round-
trip transportation from downtown for $18 per person.
Lankester Gardens
Cartago
Costa Rica has more than 1,400 varieties of orchids, and no fewer than 800 
species are on display at this botanical garden in Cartago province. 
Created in the 1940s by English naturalist Charles Lankester, the gardens 
are now administered by the University of Costa Rica. The primary goal is 
to preserve the local flora, with an emphasis on orchids and bromeliads. 
Paved trails meander from open, sunny gardens into shady forests. In 
each environment, different species of orchids are in bloom. An informa-
tion center and gift shop round out the offerings, and the trails are well 
tended and well marked. Plan to spend one to three hours here if you’re 
interested in flowers and gardening; you can run through it more quickly 
if you’re not.
Paraíso de Cartago. % 2552-3247. www.jardinbotanicolankester.org. 
Take the Cartago bus from San José, and then the Paraíso bus from a stop 100m 

Part III: San José and the Central Valley 
128
(1 block) south and 75m (3⁄4 block) west of the Catholic church ruins in Cartago (ride 
takes 30–40 minutes). Admission: $5 adults, $3.50 children 6–16. Open: Daily 8:30 
a.m.–5:30 p.m. Closed all national holidays.
 
 La Paz Waterfall Gardens
Varablanca, Heredia
The namesake attraction here consists of a series of trails through pri-
mary and secondary forest alongside the La Paz River, with lookouts over 
a series of powerful falls, including the namesake La Paz Fall. The trails 
include lookouts and suspended walkways that give you an intimate, and 
sometimes wet, view of the falls. An orchid garden, a hummingbird garden, 
and a huge butterfly garden — they claim it’s the largest in the world — 
are some of the other attractions here. There’s also a small serpentarium, 
featuring a mix of venomous and nonvenomous native snakes, and several 
terrariums containing various frogs and lizards. A large artificial trout 
pond, which you can also swim in, rounds out the official attraction offer-
ings here. Although the admission fee is a little steep, the trails and water-
falls are beautiful, everything is wonderfully done, and there’s a lot to do 
and see here. A buffet lunch will run you an extra $15 at the large cafeteria-
style restaurant. This is a good stop after a morning visit to the Poás vol-
cano. Plan to spend between two and four hours here.
6km (3 3⁄4 miles) north of Varablanca on the road to San Miguel, Heredia. % 2225-
0643. www.waterfallgardens.com. Take a Puerto Viejo de Sarapiquí bus from 
Calle 12 and Avenida 9 (make sure it passes through Varablanca and La Virgen), and 
ask to be let off at the entrance. These buses are infrequent and coordinating your 
return can be difficult, so coming in a rental car or arranging transport is best. 
Admission: $32 adults, $20 children and students with valid ID. Open: Daily 8:30 a.m.–
5:30 p.m.
 Zoo Ave
Alajuela
This zoo is, by far, the best-run one in the country. The zoo began as a bird 
sanctuary and rescue center. Dozens of scarlet macaws, reclusive owls, 
majestic raptors, several different species of toucans, and a host of bril-
liantly colored birds from Costa Rica and around the world make this one 
exciting place to visit. Bird-watching enthusiasts will be able to get a 
closer look at birds that they may have seen in the wild. But there is much 
more to see here. There are also large iguana, deer, tapir, puma, and 
monkey exhibits — and look out for the 3.6m (12-ft.) crocodile. Zoo Ave 
houses only injured, donated, or confiscated animals. Walking the paths 
and visiting all the exhibits here takes about two hours.
La Garita, Alajuela. % 2433-8989. www.zooave.org. Catch one of the frequent 
Alajuela buses on Avenida 2 between calles 12 and 14. In Alajuela, transfer to a bus 
for Atenas and get off at Zoo Ave before you get to La Garita. Fare is 75¢. Admission: 
$15 adults, $13 children 11 and under. Open: Daily 9 a.m.–5 p.m.

 Chapter 12: Exploring San José 129
Suggested one-, two-, and three-day 
sightseeing itineraries
San José is a compact city, with a limited number of major attractions. 
You can easily knock off almost all of them in a few days. Here are 
some sample itineraries covering one-, two-, and three-day stays in San 
José. (See Chapter 11 and earlier in this chapter for specific listing 
information.)
If you have one day
On Day One, start your day by having coffee and breakfast at the 
Cafeteria 1930, on the outdoor patio of the Gran Hotel Costa Rica, on 
the edge of the Plaza de la Cultura. After breakfast, visit the Museo de 
Oro Banco Central (Gold Museum), and see if you can get tickets for a 
performance that night at the Teatro Nacional (National Theater). From 
the Plaza de la Cultura, stroll up Avenida Central to the Museo Nacional 
(National Museum). Have lunch at Café Mundo. If it’s a nice day, be sure 
to grab one of the outdoor tables near a flowing fountain.
After lunch, head over to the nearby Centro Nacional de Arte y Cultura 
(National Arts and Culture Center), but only if you have the energy for 
another museum. After all this culture, some shopping at the open-air 
stalls at the Plaza de la Democracia is in order. Try dinner at Bakea 
before going to the Teatro Nacional. After the performance, let your day 
come full circle with a cup of coffee or a nightcap at the Cafeteria 1930 
before calling it a night.
If you have two days
On Day Two, you’re probably best off taking one of the day trips outside 
of San José described in the “Taking a Day Trip out of San José” section, 
later in this chapter. Alternatively, you could spend the day further 
exploring the capital. Start by heading out on Paseo Colón to the Museo 
de Arte Costarricense (Museum of Costa Rican Art) and Parque La 
Sabana (La Sabana Park). Intrepid travelers can do some shopping at 
the Mercado Central. You can pick up the fixings for a picnic lunch at 
the Mercado Central or at any supermarket in town.
After lunch, if you’ve brought kids along, you’ll want to visit the Museo 
de Los Niños (Children’s Museum) or the Spyrogyra Butterfly Garden. 
Otherwise, this is a good time to tour the Museo de Jade Marco Fidel 
Tristán (Jade Museum). If you want to get more shopping in, be sure to 
save some time for the nearby Galeria Namu. For dinner, grab a taxi and 
head for one of the miradores (see Chapter 11) for dinner, and enjoy 
the spectacular view of the lights of San José twinkling below you.
If you have three days
On Day Three, head out early to the Poás volcano and then visit the La 
Paz Waterfall Gardens, returning through the hills of Heredia, with a 

Part III: San José and the Central Valley 
130
stop at INBio Park if you have the time and energy. Alternatively, you 
could head to the Irazú volcano, Lankester Gardens, and the colonial 
city of Cartago. Start your day at the volcano and work your way back 
toward San José. If you want to try an organized tour, try a cruise to Isla 
Tortuga in the Gulf of Nicoya, a white-water rafting trip on the Pacuare 
River, or a visit to the Rain Forest Aerial Tram Caribbean.
Shopping: Gold Beans and Painted Oxcarts
Serious shoppers will probably be disappointed in Costa Rica. Aside 
from coffee and miniature reproductions of working oxcarts, you’ll find 
few distinctly Costa Rican wares. To compensate for its own relative lack 
of goods, Costa Rica does a brisk business in selling crafts and clothing 
imported from Guatemala, Panama, and Ecuador.
Best shopping areas
San José’s principal shopping district is bounded by avenidas 1 and 2, 
from about Calle 14 in the west to Calle 13 in the east. For several blocks 
west of the Plaza de la Cultura, Avenida Central is a pedestrian-only 
street mall where you can find store after store of inexpensive clothes 
for men, women, and children. Depending on the mood of the police that 
day, you may find a lot of street vendors as well.
Most shops in the downtown district are open Monday through Saturday 
from about 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. Some shops close for lunch, while others 
remain open (it’s just the luck of the draw for shoppers, although fewer 
and fewer stores are closing for lunch these days). When you do pur-
chase something, you’ll be happy to find that the sales and import taxes 
have already been figured into the display price.
 
 Do not buy any kind of sea-turtle products (including jewelry); wild 
birds; lizard, snake, or cat skins; corals; or orchids (except those grown 
commercially). International laws prohibit trade in endangered wildlife, 
and such goods will be confiscated at the airport. No matter how unique, 
beautiful, insignificant, or inexpensive it may seem, your purchase will 
directly contribute to the further hunting of endangered species.
Visiting a Costa Rican market
There are several large markets near downtown, but by far the largest is 
the Mercado Central, located between avenidas Central and 1 and calles 
6 and 8. Although this crowded maze of stalls is primarily a food market, 
inside you’ll find all manner of vendors, including a few selling Costa 
Rican souvenirs, leather goods, and musical instruments. Be especially 
careful about your wallet or purse and any prominent jewelry — very 
skilled pickpockets frequent this area. All the streets surrounding the 
Mercado Central are jammed with produce vendors selling from small 
carts or loading and unloading trucks. It’s always a hive of activity, with 

 Chapter 12: Exploring San José 131
crowds of people jostling for space on the streets. Your best bet is to 
visit on Sundays or on weekdays; Saturdays are particularly busy. In the 
hot days of the dry season, the aromas can get quite heady.
You’ll also find a daily street market on the west side of the Plaza de la 
Democracia. The market boasts two long rows of outdoor stalls selling 
T-shirts, Guatemalan and Ecuadorian handicrafts and clothing, small 
ceramic ocarinas (small musical wind instruments), and handmade jew-
elry. The atmosphere here is much more open than at the Mercado 
Central, which I find just a bit too claustrophobic.
Finally, two other similar options downtown include La Casona, Calle 
Central between avenidas Central and 1 (% 2222-7999), a three-story 
warren of crafts and souvenir shops, and El Pueblo, a tourism complex 
built in the style of a mock colonial-era village, with a wide range of res-
taurants, gift shops, art galleries, bars, and discos.
Heading to a mall
With globalization and modernization taking hold in Costa Rica, much of 
the local shopping scene has shifted to large mega-malls. Modern multi-
level affairs with cineplexes, food courts, and international brand-name 
stores are becoming more ubiquitous. The biggest and most modern 
of these malls include the Mall San Pedro, Multiplaza, Terra Mall, and 
Mall Real Cariari. Although they lack the charm of the small shops 
found around San José, they’re a reasonable option for one-stop shop-
ping; most contain at least one or two local galleries and crafts shops, 
along with a large supermarket, which is always the best place to stock 
up on local coffee, hot sauces, liquors, and other nonperishable 
foodstuffs.
What to look for and where to find it
If the large markets and malls don’t have what you’re looking for, per-
haps one of the specialty shops or galleries listed in the following sec-
tions will fill the bill.
 
 You may be able to negotiate prices down a little bit, but bargaining is 
not a traditional part of the vendor culture here, so you’ll have to work 
hard to save a few dollars.
Art galleries
Arte Latino (Calle 5 and Avenida 1; % 2258-7083) carries original art-
work in a variety of media, featuring predominantly Central American 
themes. Some of it is pretty gaudy, but this is a good place to find 
Nicaraguan and Costa Rican “primitive” paintings. The gallery also has 
storefronts in the Multiplaza Mall in Escazú and at the Mall Cariari, 
which is located on the Interamerican Highway, about halfway between 
the airport and downtown, across the street from the Hotel Herradura.

Part III: San José and the Central Valley 
132
 
 For an outstanding gallery dealing mainly in high-end Costa Rican art, 
head to Galería 11–12 (Plaza Itskatzu, off the Prospero Fernandez high-
way in Escazú; % 2288-1975; www.galeria11-12.com). The collection 
here ranges from neoclassical painters such as Teodorico Quirós to 
modern masters such as Francisco Amighetti and Paco Zuñiga, to current 
stars such as Rafa Fernández, Fernando Carballo, and Fabio Herrera.
Galería Jacobo Karpio (Avenida 1, Casa 1352, between calles 11 and 13; 
% 2257-7963) handles some of the more adventurous modern art to be 
found in Costa Rica. Karpio has a steady stable of prominent Mexican, 
Cuban, and Argentine artists, as well as some local talent.
TEORetica (Avenida 7 and Calle 11; % 2233-4881; www.teoretica.
org) is a small downtown gallery, run by Virginia Pérez-Ratton, one of 
the more adventurous and internationally respected collectors and cura-
tors in Costa Rica. You’ll often find very interesting and cutting-edge 
exhibitions here.
Galería Amón (#937 Calle 7, between avenidas 7 and 9; % 2223-9725; 
www.amon937.com) features contemporary artists from both Central 
and South America. Housed in a stylish old home in the historic Barrio 
Amón district, the spaces are ample and well lit, and there’s almost a 
museum-like feel to the exhibitions.
 
 Art lovers should check out Molly Keeler’s one-day Art Tour (% 8359-
5571 or 2288-0896; www.costaricaarttour.com), which includes 
scheduled visits to the studios and personal shops of prominent local 
artists working in a wide range of media.
Books
For English-language novels, field guides and general guidebooks, 
and natural history books, head to either Seventh Street Books 
(% 2256-8251; Calle 7 between avenidas 1 and Central), or Librería 
Internacional (% 2253-9553; www.libreriainternacional.com). 
Librería Internacional has several outlets around San José, including 
storefronts in most of the major modern malls.
 
 You can also order a host of field guides and other Costa Rican–themed 
books in English online from www.zonatropical.net.
Handicrafts
The quality of Costa Rican handicrafts is generally very low, and the 
offerings are limited. The most typical items you’ll find are hand-painted 
wooden oxcarts. These come in a variety of sizes, and the big ones can 
be shipped to your home for a very reasonable price.
Notable exceptions to the generally meager crafts offerings include 
the fine wooden creations of Barry Biesanz (% 2289-4337; www.
biesanz.com). His work is sold in many of the finer gift shops around, 
but beware: Biesanz’s work is often imitated, so make sure that what you 

 Chapter 12: Exploring San José 133
buy is the real deal (he generally burns his signature into the bottom of 
the piece). Lil Mena is a local artist who specializes in working with and 
painting on handmade papers and rough fibers. You’ll find her work in a 
number of shops around San José.
You may also run across carved masks made by the indigenous Boruca 
people of southern Costa Rica. These full-size balsa masks come in a 
variety of styles, both painted and unpainted, and run anywhere from 
$20 to $90, depending on the quality of workmanship. Cecilia “Pefi” 
Figueres makes practical ceramic wares that are lively and fun. Look for 
her brightly colored abstract and figurative bowls, pitchers, and coffee 
mugs at some of the better gift shops around the city.
Scores of shops around San José sell a wide variety of crafts, from the 
truly tacky to the divinely inspired. Here are some that sell more of the 
latter and fewer of the former.
Biesanz Woodworks (Escazú; % 2289-4337; www.biesanz.com; call 
for directions and off-hour appointments) produces a wide range of 
high-quality items, including bowls, jewelry boxes, humidors, and 
some wonderful sets of wooden chopsticks. Biesanz Woodworks is 
actively involved in reforestation, so you can even pick up a hardwood 
seedling here.
 
 Occupying two floors at the Hotel Don Carlos, Boutique Annemarie 
(Calle 9, between avenidas 7 and 9; % 2221-6063) has an amazing array 
of wood products, leather goods, papier-mâché figurines, paintings, 
books, cards, posters, and jewelry. You’ll see most of this stuff at the 
other shops, but not in such quantities or in such a relaxed and 
pressure-free environment. Don’t miss this shopping experience.
 
 Galería Namu (Avenida 7, between calles 5 and 7; % 2256-3412; www.
galerianamu.com) has some very high-quality arts and crafts, includ-
ing excellent Boruca and Huetar carved masks and “primitive” paintings, 
many painted by rural women. It also carries a good selection of the 
ceramic work of Cecilia “Pefi” Figueres. This place organizes tours to 
visit various indigenous tribes and artisans as well.
Boutique Kiosco (Calle 7 and Avenida 11, Barrio Amón; % 2258-1829) 
features a range or original and one-off pieces of functional, wearable, 
and practical pieces made by contemporary Costa Rican and regional 
artists and designers. Though the offerings are regularly changing, 
you’ll usually find a mix of jewelry, handbags, shoes, dolls, furniture, 
and knickknacks. Pieces are often made with recycled or sustainable 
materials.
Jewelry
The outgrowth of a jewelry-making school, Studio Metallo (650m/61⁄2 
blocks east of the Iglesia Santa Teresita, Barrio Escalante; % 2281-3207; 
www.studiometallo.com) has some excellent hand-crafted jewelry 

Part III: San José and the Central Valley 
134
made in a range of styles, using everything from 18-karat white and 
yellow gold and pure silver, to some less-exotic and -expensive alloys. 
Some works integrate gemstones, while many others focus on the metal 
work.
Part working jewelry factory, part shopping center, part tourist trap, 
Plaza Esmeralda (Sabana Norte, 800m/8 blocks north of Jack’s, in Pavas; 
% 2296-0312) is a good place to come to buy replicas of pre-Columbian 
jewelry. The several shops here carry a wide range of typical tourist sou-
venirs and locally produced arts and craftworks at fair prices. Visitors 
are treated to a 15-minute guided tour where you can see some of the 
jewelry being manufactured.
Leather goods
In general, Costa Rican leather products are not of the highest grade or 
quality, and prices are not particularly low — but take a look and see for 
yourself.
Del Río (% 2262-1415) is a local leather-goods manufacturer, with 
stores in most of the city’s modern malls. It also offers free hotel pickups 
and transfers to its factory outlet in Heredia.
Liquor
The national drink is guaro, a rough, clear liquor made from sugar cane. 
The most popular brand is Cacique, which you’ll find at every liquor 
store and most supermarkets. Costa Ricans drink their guaro straight or 
mixed with club soda or Fresca. When drinking it straight, it’s customary 
to follow a shot with a bite into a fresh lime covered in salt.
Costa Ricans also drink a lot of rum. The premier Costa Rican rum is 
Centenario, but I recommend that you opt for the Nicaraguan Flor de 
Caña or Cuban Havana Club, which are both far superior rums.
 
 Because of the trade embargo, bringing Havana Club into the United 
States is illegal.
Several brands and styles of coffee-based liqueurs are also produced in 
Costa Rica. Café Rica is similar to Kahlúa, and you can also find several 
types of coffee cream liqueurs. The folks at Café Britt produce their own 
line of coffee liqueurs, which are quite good. You can buy them in most 
supermarkets, liquor stores, and tourist shops.
Music
A CD of Costa Rican music makes a great souvenir. Editus is an inventive 
trio (guitar, violin, and percussion) that has several albums out. They’ve 
won two Grammy awards for their collaborations with Rubén Blades on 
the albums Tiempos and Mundo.

 Chapter 12: Exploring San José 135
Jazz pianist Manuel Obregón has several excellent albums out, includ-
ing Simbiosis, on which he improvises along with the sounds of Costa 
Rica’s wildlife, waterfalls, and weather, as well as his work with the 
Papaya Orchestra and Rio Infinito Orchestra, collaborations and 
gatherings of musicians from around Central and South America.
Papaya Music (www.papayamusic.com) produces and distributes an 
excellent range of local music, including everyone from Obregon to 
Malpais, a local pop-rock band, to a broad selection of traditional folk 
music, including one of my favorite local discs, Dr. Bombodee, by the 
Costa Rican–born calypsonian Walter “Gavitt” Ferguson.
Many gift shops around the country carry a small selection of Costa 
Rican music. You can also find music stores in all the modern malls men-
tioned in the “Heading to a mall” section, earlier in this chapter.
Living It Up After Dark: From the 
Theaters to a Bitter Street
Catering to a mix of tourists, college students, and just everyday party-
loving Ticos, San José has a host of options to meet the nocturnal needs 
Taking a trip to Sarchí 
for some local crafts
Sarchí is Costa Rica’s main artisan town. The colorfully painted miniature oxcarts that 
you see all over the country are made here. Oxcarts such as these were once used to 
haul coffee beans to market. Today, although you may occasionally see oxcarts in use, 
most are purely decorative. However, they remain a well-known symbol of Costa Rica. 
In addition to miniature oxcarts, many carved wooden souvenirs are made here with 
rare hardwoods from the nation’s forests. Dozens of shops are located within a few 
blocks of each other in town, and all have similar prices.
If you’re driving, take the Interamerican Highway north. After passing the airport and 
the turnoff for Jacó and Manuel Antonio, look for the marked exit for Grecia and Sarchí. 
It’s about a 30-minute drive from the airport to Sarchí. A taxi should charge around $35 
each way from downtown.
About five buses leave San José for Sarchí from Calle 18, between avenidas 5 and 7. 
The fare is $1.25. Alternatively, you can take any Grecia bus from this same station. In 
Grecia, they connect with the Alajuela–Sarchí buses, which leave every 30 minutes 
from Calle 8, between avenidas Central and 1 in Alajuela.

Part III: San José and the Central Valley 
136
of visitors and locals alike. You’ll find plenty of interesting clubs and 
bars, a wide range of theaters, and some very hot dance clubs.
 
 To find out what’s going on in San José while you’re in town, pick up 
either the Tico Times (English) or La Nación (Spanish), two local news-
papers. The former is a good place to find out where local expatriates 
are hanging out; the latter’s “Viva” and “Tiempo Libre” sections have 
extensive listings of discos, movie theaters, and live music.
The performing arts
Theater is very popular in Costa Rica, and downtown San José is stud-
ded with small theaters. However, tastes tend toward the burlesque, and 
the crowd pleasers are almost always simplistic sexual comedies. The 
National Theater Company (% 2221-1273) is an exception, tackling 
works from Lope de Vega to Lorca to Mamet. Similarly, the small inde-
pendent group Abya Yala (% 2240-6071) also puts on several cutting-
edge, avant-garde shows each year. Almost all the theater offerings are 
in Spanish, although the Little Theatre Group (www.littletheatre
group.org) is a long-standing amateur group that periodically stages 
works in English. Check the Tico Times to see if anything is running 
during your stay.
Costa Rica has a strong modern dance scene. Both the University of 
Costa Rica (% 2207-4595) and the National University (% 2256-4838) 
have modern-dance companies that perform regularly in various venues 
in San José. In addition to the university-sponsored companies, check to 
see if any smaller independent companies are performing.
The National Symphony Orchestra (% 2240-0333; www.osn.go.cr) is 
a respectable orchestra by regional standards, although its repertoire 
tends to be rather conservative. The symphony season runs March 
through November, with concerts roughly every other weekend at the 
Teatro Nacional (National Theater; Avenida 2, between calles 3 and 5; 
% 2221-5341; www.teatronacional.go.cr) and the Auditorio 
Nacional (National Auditorium; % 2256-5876), located at the Museo de 
Los Niños (see the listing earlier in this chapter). Tickets cost between 
$3 and $30 and can be purchased at the box office.
Visiting artists also stop in Costa Rica from time to time. Recent con-
certs have featured hard rockers Iron Maiden, Argentine pop star Fito 
Paez, operatic legend Placido Domingo, and Brazilian maestro Caetano 
Veloso. Many of these concerts and guest performances take place in 
San José’s two historic theaters, the Teatro Nacional (see earlier in this 
section) and the Teatro Melico Salazar (Avenida 2, between calles 
Central and 2; % 2221-4952), as well as at the Auditorio Nacional (see 
earlier in this section). Really large shows are sometimes held at fútbol 
(soccer) stadiums or at the amphitheater at the Hotel Herradura.

Dance clubs and discos
Ticos love to dance, and you’ll find plenty of places to hit the dance 
floor in San José. Salsa and merengue are the main beats that move 
people here, but you’ll also find clubs specializing in more modern 
dance music such as house. Many of the dance clubs and salons feature 
live music on the weekends.
In general, bars open anywhere from mid- to late-afternoon and stay 
open to anywhere from midnight to 2 a.m. Most dance clubs follow simi-
lar hours, although a very few open as late as 8 p.m. Some bars and 
dance clubs do stay open as late as 4 a.m.
A good place to sample a range of San José’s nightlife is in El Pueblo, 
a shopping, dining, and entertainment complex done up like an old 
Spanish village. It’s just across the river to the north of town. The best 
way to get there is by taxi; all the drivers know El Pueblo well. Within 
the alleyways that wind through El Pueblo are a dozen or more bars 
and dance clubs — plus an indoor fútbol (soccer) playing field. In El 
Pueblo, Fiesta Latina (% 2222-8782), Twister (% 2222-5746), and 
Friends (% 2233-5283) are happening party spots. Across the street, 
Copacabana (% 2233-5516) is a popular dance spot. For a mellower 
option, inside El Pueblo, try Café Art Boruca (% 2221-3615).
Most of the places listed in this section demand a nominal cover charge; 
sometimes it includes a drink or two.
If you want to mingle with locals and visit a classic Costa Rican dance 
club, head to Castro’s (Avenida 13 and Calle 22, Barrio Mexico; % 2256-
8789). The music varies throughout the night, from salsa and merengue 
to reggaeton and, occasionally, electronic trance. Spread over a couple 
of floors, you’ll find several rooms and various types of environments 
here, including some intimate and quiet corners.
The dance floor at El Tobogán (2 blocks north and 1 block east of the La 
República main office, off the Guápiles Highway; % 2257-3396) is about 
the size of a football field, yet it still fills up. This is a place where Ticos 
come with their loved ones and dance partners. The music is a mix of 
classic Latin dance rhythms — salsa, cumbia, and merengue. It’s open 
only on the weekends (until about 2 a.m.), but a live band is always play-
ing, and sometimes the music is very good.
Tucked inside a nondescript office building and commercial center on 
Paseo Colón, Vertigo (Edificio Colón, Paseo Colón; % 2257-8424) has 
quickly become one of the more popular places for rave-style, late-night 
dancing, and partying. The dance floor is huge, the ceilings are high, and 
electronic music rules the roost. It’s open daily until 4 a.m.

Part III: San José and the Central Valley 
138
The bar scene
There seems to be something for every taste in San José. Lounge lizards 
will be happy in most hotel bars in the downtown area, while students 
and the young at heart will have no problem mixing in at the livelier 
spots around town, especially out in San Pedro.
Perhaps the best part of the San José bar scene is something called a 
boca, the equivalent of a tapa in Spain: a little dish of snacks that arrives 
at your table when you order a drink. Although this is a somewhat dying 
tradition, especially in the younger, hipper bars, you’ll still find bocas 
alive and well in the older, more traditional Costa Rican drinking estab-
lishments. In most, the bocas are free, but in some, where the dishes are 
more sophisticated, you’ll have to pay for the treats.
Chelles (Avenida Central and Calle 9; % 2221-1369) makes up for its 
lack of style and ambience with plenty of tradition and its diverse and 
colorful clientele. The lights are bright, the chairs surround simple 
Formica-topped card tables, and mirrors adorn most of the walls. Simple 
sandwiches and meals are served, and pretty good bocas come with the 
drinks. Plus, this place is open 24 hours a day.
 
 El Cuartel de la Boca del Monte (Avenida 1, between calles 21 and 23; 
% 2221-0327) began life as an artist-and-bohemian hangout, and over 
the years, it has evolved into the leading meat market for the young and 
well heeled. However, artists still come, as do local and foreign-exchange 
students, young working stiffs, and tourists. Live music is usually offered 
here on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday nights, and when it’s playing, 
the place is packed shoulder-to-shoulder.
You can easily miss the narrow entrance to El Observatorio (Calle 23, 
between avenidas Central and 1; % 2223-0725). Owned by a local film-
maker, the décor includes a heavy dose of cinema motifs. The space is 
large, with high ceilings, and one of the best (perhaps only) smoke 
extraction systems of any popular bar, making the air pleasant to 
breathe, despite the fact that 80 percent of the clientele are chain smok-
ers. Regular live music and movie screenings are featured, and a pretty 
good menu of appetizers and main dishes, drawn from various world 
cuisines, is on hand.
Housed in a beautiful old mansion just off Parque Morazán in the heart 
of downtown, Key Largo (Calle 7, between avenidas 1 and 3; % 2221-
0277) is worth a visit if only to take in the scene and admire the dark-
stained, carved-wood ceilings. However, be forewarned, this has 
historically been, and still is, one of the city’s prime hangouts for prosti-
tutes and their potential customers.
Hanging out in San Pedro
The 2-block stretch of San Pedro just south of the University of Costa 
Rica has been dubbed La Calle de Amargura (The Street of Bitterness), 

 Chapter 12: Exploring San José 139
and it’s the heart and soul of this eastern suburb and college town. Bars 
and cafes are mixed in with bookstores and copy shops. After dark, the 
streets here are packed with teens, punks, students, and professors bar-
hopping and just hanging around. You can walk the strip until some-
place strikes your fancy, or you can try one of the places listed in this 
section.
 
 The Jazz Café (next to the Banco Popular on Avenida Central; % 2253-
8933; www.jazzcafecostarica.com) is consistently one of the more 
happening spots in San Pedro and one of my favorites, although low ceil-
ings and poor air circulation make it almost unbearably smoky most 
nights. Wrought-iron chairs, sculpted busts of famous jazz artists, and 
creative lighting give the place ambience. Live music is featured here 
just about every night. These folks have also opened a sister Jazz Café 
Escazu (% 2288-4740) on the western end of town.
Set on a busy corner in the heart of the University district, Terra U 
(2 blocks east and 11⁄2 blocks north of the church in San Pedro; % 2225-
4261) is quickly becoming one of the most popular bars in the area. Part 
of this is due to the inviting, open-air, street-front patio area, which pro-
vides a nice alternative to the all-too-common smoke-filled rooms found 
at most other trendy spots.
You can get here by heading out (east) on Avenida 2, following the flow 
of traffic. You’ll first pass through the neighborhood of Los Yoses before 
you reach a big traffic circle with a big fountain in the center (La Fuente 
de la Hispanidad). The Mall San Pedro is located on this traffic circle. 
Heading straight through the circle (well, going around it and continuing 
on what would have been a straight path), you’ll come to the Church of 
San Pedro, about 4 blocks east of the circle. The church is San Pedro’s 
major landmark.
Casinos
Gambling is legal in Costa Rica; however, there are some idiosyncrasies 
involved in gambling a la Tica.
If blackjack is your game, you’ll want to play rummy. The rules are 
almost identical, except that the house doesn’t pay one and a half times 
on blackjack — instead, it pays double on any three of a kind or three-
card straight flush, even if it pushes you over 21.
If you’re looking for roulette, what you’ll find here is a bingolike spinning 
cage of numbered balls. The betting is the same, but some of the glam-
our is lost.
You’ll also find a version of five-card-draw poker, but the rule differ-
ences are so complex that I advise you to sit down and watch for a 
while, and then ask some questions before joining in. That’s about all 
you’ll find — no craps tables or baccarat are on hand.

Part III: San José and the Central Valley 
140
Mechanical slot machines are currently outlawed — but you’ll be able to 
play electronic slots and poker games. Most of the casinos here are 
quite casual and small by international standards. You may have to 
dress up slightly at some of the fancier hotels, but most are accustomed 
to tropical-vacation attire.
Casinos are located at several of the mid- to large-scale hotels, as well as 
some stand-alone casinos downtown. Casino Club Colonial (Avenida 1, 
between calles 9 and 11; % 2258-2807) and Casino Del Rey (Avenida 1 
and Calle 9, inside the Hotel Del Rey; % 2257-7800) are two good 
options, virtually next door to each other.
Taking a Day Trip out of San José
San José makes an excellent base for exploring the beautiful Central 
Valley and the surrounding mountains. A wide range of organized day 
trips are offered, ranging from visits to some pre-Colombian ruins to a 
host of adventure activities.
Guided tours and adventures
For most visitors, the best way to take advantage of a day trip or adven-
ture outside of San José is as part of a guided tour or outing.
A number of companies offer a wide variety of primarily nature-
related day tours out of San José. The best of these include Costa Rica 
Expeditions (% 2257-0766; www.costaricaexpeditions.com), 
Costa Rica Sun Tours (% 2296-7757; www.crsuntours.com), and 
Horizontes Tours (% 2222-2022; www.horizontes.com).
 
 Before signing on for a tour of any sort, find out how many fellow travel-
ers will be accompanying you, how much time will be spent in transit 
and eating lunch, and how much time will actually be spent doing the 
primary activity. I’ve had complaints about tours that were rushed; that 
spent too much time in a bus or on secondary activities; or that had a 
cattle-car, assembly-line feel to them.
I’ve arranged the tours in this section by type of activity. In addition to 
these tours, many others exist, some of which combine two or three dif-
ferent activities or destinations.
Bungee jumping
Nothing is unique about bungee jumping in Costa Rica, but the sites 
here are quite beautiful. If you’ve always had the bug, Tropical Bungee 
(% 2248-2212; www.bungee.co.cr) helps folks jump off an 80m (262-
ft.) bridge for $65 per person, and $30 for a second jump. Transportation 
is provided free from San José twice daily. These folks also offer para-
gliding tours.

 Chapter 12: Exploring San José 141
Canopy tours and the rain-forest aerial tram
 
 Getting off the ground and up into the treetops is the latest fad, and it 
was arguably first developed in Costa Rica. Scores of so-called zip-line 
canopy tours abound around the country.
You have several options relatively close to San José. The quickest and 
easiest way to experience a zip-line canopy tour from San José is to head 
to the La Sabana park and take the Urban Canopy Tour (% 2215-2544). 
Given the fact that this tour is set on a relatively flat patch of city park, 
it’s neither as extensive nor as exciting as the other options around the 
country. Still, the tour has eight zip-line cables, with the longest being 
some 200m (650 ft.) long. The tour costs $20.
The folks at the Original Canopy Tours (% 2291-4465; www.canopy
tour.com) have their Mahogany Park operation, located about one 
hour outside of San José. The tour here features ten platforms and, at 
the end, you have the choice of taking a cable to a ground station or 
doing an 18m (60-ft.) rappel down to finish off. The tour takes about two 
hours and costs $45.
Another option is the Rain Forest Aerial Tram Caribbean (% 2257-
5961; www.rainforesttram.com), built on a private reserve bordering 
Braulio Carillo National Park. The tramway takes visitors on a 90-minute 
ride through the treetops, where they have the chance to glimpse the 
complex web of life that makes these forests unique. These folks have 
several complimentary attractions, including a butterfly garden, serpen-
tarium, and frog collection. They even have their own zip-line canopy 
tour. There are also well-groomed trails through the rain forest and a 
restaurant on-site, so a trip here can easily take up a full day. The cost 
for tours, including transportation from San José and either breakfast or 
lunch, is $105. Alternatively, you can drive or take one of the frequent 
Guápiles buses — they leave every half-hour throughout the day and 
cost $2 — from the Caribbean bus terminal (Gran Terminal del Caribe) 
on Calle Central, 1 block north of Avenida 11. Ask the driver to let you 
off in front of the teleférico (tram). If you’re driving, head out on the 
Guápiles Highway as if driving to the Caribbean coast. Watch for the 
tram’s roadside welcome center — it’s hard to miss. For walk-ins, the 
entrance fee is $55; students and kids under 18 pay $28.
 
 Because the Rain Forest Aerial Tram Caribbean is a popular tour for 
groups, I highly recommend that you have an advance reservation in the 
high season and, if possible, a ticket. Otherwise, you may end up waiting 
a long time for your tram ride or even be shut out. The tram can handle 
only about 80 passengers per hour, so scheduling is tight; the folks here 
try to schedule as much as possible in advance.
Day cruises
If you want to really enjoy the beach and the tropics, take a cruise to 
lovely Tortuga Island in the Gulf of Nicoya. These full-day tours entail an 

Part III: San José and the Central Valley 
142
early departure for the two-and-a-half-hour chartered bus ride to 
Puntarenas, where you board your vessel for a one-and-a-half-hour 
cruise to Tortuga Island. Then you get several hours on the picturesque 
island, where you can swim, lie on the beach, play volleyball, or try a 
canopy tour, followed by the return journey.
The original and most dependable company running these trips is 
Calypso Tours (% 2256-2727; www.calypsotours.com). The tour 
costs $119) per person and includes round-trip transportation from San 
José, a basic continental breakfast during the bus ride to the boat, all 
drinks on the cruise, and an excellent buffet lunch on the beach at the 
island. The Calypso Tours main vessel is a massive motor-powered cata-
maran. A second vessel runs a separate tour to a private nature reserve 
at Punta Coral. The beach is much nicer at Tortuga Island, but the tour 
to Punta Coral is much more intimate, and the restaurant, hiking, and 
kayaking are all superior here.
Mountain-biking
The best bicycle riding is well outside of San José — on dirt roads where 
you’re not likely to be run off the highway by a semi or run head-on into 
someone coming around a blind curve in the wrong lane. Several compa-
nies run a variety of one-day and multiday tours out of San José. The 
one-day tours usually involve a round-trip bus or van ride out of down-
town to the primary destination. These destinations include the small 
towns of Sarchí and Turrialba, as well as the Irazú and Poás volcanoes. 
Several of these tours are designed to be either entirely or primarily 
descents. Costa Rica Biking Adventure (% 2225-6591; www.biking
incostarica.com) offers a variety of mountain-biking tours using 
high-end bikes and gear. A one-day trip should cost between $95 and 
$150 per person.
A unique option is to take a Railbike Tour (% 8303-3300; www.rail
bike.com). This tour involves a mountain bike rigged to a contraption 
that fits over abandoned railroad tracks, running through the country-
side outside San José. The full-day tour costs $75 and includes all equip-
ment, plus a light breakfast and full lunch.
Rafting, kayaking, and river trips
Dozens of tumultuous rivers cascade down from the Costa Rican moun-
tains. Several have become very popular for white-water rafting and kay-
aking. If I had to choose just one day trip to do out of San José, it would 
be a white-water rafting trip. For between $75 and $120, you can spend 
a day rafting through lush tropical forests; multiday trips are also 
available. Some of the most reliable rafting companies are Aventuras 
Naturales (% 800-514-0411 in the U.S., 2225-3939 in Costa Rica; www.
toenjoynature.com), Exploradores Outdoors (% 2222-6262; www.
exploradoresoutdoors.com), and Ríos Tropicales (% 2233-6455; 
www.riostropicales.com). These companies all ply a number of 

 Chapter 12: Exploring San José 143
rivers of varying difficulties, including the popular Pacuare and 
Reventazón rivers.
 
 Of all of Costa Rica’s white-water rivers, the Pacuare River is the most 
popular and arguably the most spectacular. Class III and IV rapids weave 
through predominantly uninhabited forest, and toucans fly overhead. 
Near the end of the run, the river passes through a narrow steep-walled 
canyon.
Choosing the volcano trip that’s right for you
Poás, Irazú, and Arenal volcanoes are three of Costa Rica’s most 
popular destinations, and the first two are easy day trips from San José. 
Although numerous companies offer day trips to Arenal, I don’t recom-
mend them because you’ll spend at least three and a half hours on travel 
in each direction. You usually arrive when the volcano is hidden by 
clouds and leave before the night’s darkness shows off its glowing erup-
tions. For more information on Arenal volcano, see Chapter 18.
Tour companies offering trips to Poás and Irazú include Costa Rica 
Expeditions (% 2257-0766; www.costaricaexpeditions.com), 
Costa Rica Sun Tours (% 2296-7757; www.crsuntours.com), and 
Horizontes Tours (% 2222-2022; www.horizontes.com). Prices 
range from $30 to $50 for a half-day trip, and from $60 to $120 for a 
full-day trip.
The 3,378m (11,080-ft.) Irazú volcano is historically one of Costa Rica’s 
more active volcanoes, although it’s relatively quiet these days. It last 
erupted on March 19, 1963, on the day that President John F. Kennedy 
arrived in Costa Rica. A good paved road passes right to the rim of the 
crater, where a desolate expanse of gray sand nurtures few plants and 
the air smells of sulfur. The landscape here is often compared to that of 
the moon. You’ll get fabulous views of the fertile Meseta Central and 
Orosi Valley as you drive up from Cartago, and if you’re very lucky, you 
may be able to see both the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea. Clouds 
usually descend by noon, so get here as early in the day as possible.
A visitor center with information on the volcano and natural history can 
be found at the entrance to the park, just off the parking lots. A short 
trail leads to the rim of the volcano’s two craters, their walls a maze of 
eroded gullies feeding onto the flat floor far below. This is a national 
park, with an admission fee of $10 charged at the gate. Dress in layers; 
this may be the tropics, but it can be cold up at the top if the sun’s not 
out. The park restaurant, at an elevation of 3,022m (9,912 ft.), with walls 
of windows looking out over the valley far below, claims to be the high-
est restaurant in Central America.
If you don’t want to take an organized tour, buses leave for Irazú volcano 
daily at 8 a.m. from Avenida 2 between calles 1 and 3 (across the street 
from the entrance to the Gran Hotel Costa Rica). The fare is $7 round-trip, 

Part III: San José and the Central Valley 
144
with the bus leaving the volcano at 12:30 p.m. To make sure that the 
buses are running, call % 2530-1064. If you’re driving, head northeast 
out of Cartago toward San Rafael, and then continue driving uphill 
toward the volcano, passing the turnoffs for Cot and Tierra Blanca en 
route.
Poás volcano is 37km (23 miles) from San José on narrow roads that 
wind through a landscape of fertile farms and dark forests. As at Irazú, a 
paved road runs right to the top, although you’ll have to hike in about 
1km (1⁄2 mile) to reach the crater. The volcano stands 2,640m (8,659 ft.) 
tall and is located within a national park, which preserves not only the 
volcano but also dense stands of virgin forest. Poás’s crater, said to 
be the second largest in the world, is more than a mile across. Geysers 
in the crater sometimes spew steam and muddy water 180m (590 ft.) 
into the air, making this the largest geyser in the world. An information 
center is located at the entrance to the park, just off the parking lots. 
Here you can see a slide show about the volcano, and you’ll find well-
groomed and well-marked hiking trails through the cloud forest that 
rings the crater. About 15 minutes from the parking area, along a forest 
trail, is an overlook onto beautiful Botos Lake, which has formed in one 
of the volcano’s extinct craters.
Be prepared when you come to Poás: This volcano is often enveloped in 
dense clouds. If you want to see the crater, you’ll want to come early 
and during the dry season. Moreover, it can get cool up here, especially 
when the sun isn’t shining, so dress appropriately. Admission to the 
national park is $10 at the gate.
In case you don’t want to go on a tour, a daily bus (% 2442-6900 or 
2222-5325) leaves from Avenida 2, between calles 12 and 14, at 8 a.m. 
and returns at 2 p.m. The fare is $6 round-trip. The bus is often crowded, 
so arrive early. If you’re driving, head for Alajuela, continue on the main 
road through town, and follow signs for Fraijanes. Just beyond Fraijanes, 
you’ll connect with the road between San Pedro de Poás and Poasito; 
turn right toward Poasito, and continue to the rim of the volcano.

Part IV
Guanacaste and 
Environs

In this part . . .
T
he northwestern province of Guanacaste is home to Costa 
Rica’s greatest array of beach towns and resort destina-
tions. This part gives you insights into choosing the right 
beach or resort to fi t your travel needs and wants. From the 
quiet, isolated beaches of Playa Hermosa and Pan de Azúcar, 
to the bustling surfer town of Tamarindo, to the mega-resorts 
of the Papagayo Peninsula, this part helps you choose the 
perfect destination on Costa Rica’s Gold Coast. This part also 
lists a wide range of activities to keep you busy while in 
Guanacaste.

W
ith a long, beautiful, and varied shoreline, Guanacaste definitely 
deserves its designation as Costa Rica’s “Gold Coast.” Occupying 
the northwest corner of the country, Guanacaste is the driest and most 
consistently sunny region in Costa Rica. Not surprisingly, it is home to 
many of the country’s most popular beaches and resorts.
Guanacaste province is named after the tall and broad shady trees that 
still shelter the herds of cattle that roam the dusty inland savanna here. 
In addition to the beaches, resorts, and cattle ranches, Guanacaste has 
several active volcanoes and one of the last remnants of tropical dry 
forest left in Central America.
Hotel options range from large, luxurious resorts and all-inclusives to 
isolated beachfront bed-and-breakfasts and small inns. Guanacaste cur-
rently boasts four regulation golf courses, and more are allegedly in the 
works.
 
 During the dry season, the hillsides in Guanacaste turn brown and 
barren. Dust from dirt roads blankets the trees in many areas, and the 
scenery seems far from tropical. Driving these dirt roads without air-
conditioning and closed windows can be extremely unpleasant.
On the other hand, if you happen to visit this area in the rainy season, 
the hillsides are a beautiful, rich green, and the sun usually shines all 
morning, giving way to an afternoon shower — just in time for a nice 
siesta.

Getting There
Whether you fly directly to Liberia, or take a commuter flight from San 
José, the fastest and easiest way to get to Guanacaste is by air. I highly 
recommend it. If you want the freedom and flexibility of a car, you can 
always rent one in Guanacaste. However, if you’re touring the country 
by car, or want to save money, you can also drive or take a bus. You’ll 
find detailed information on all these options in the following sections.
By air
The Daniel Oduber Airport (% 2668-1010 or 2688-1117; airport code: 
LIR) in Liberia is a small, modern, international airport that receives a 
steady stream of scheduled commercial and charter flights throughout 
the year.
Following are the major commercial airlines with regularly scheduled 
service to Liberia:
 
✓ American Airlines (% 800-433-7300; www.aa.com) has four 
weekly direct flights between Miami and Liberia, and twice weekly 
flights between Dallas–Ft. Worth and Liberia.
 
✓ Continental (% 800-231-0856; www.continental.com) has daily 
direct flights between Houston and Liberia, twice-weekly flights 
between Newark and Liberia.
 
✓ Delta (% 800-221-1212; www.delta.com) has daily direct flights 
between its Atlanta hub and Liberia, and a once-weekly direct flight 
between Los Angeles and Liberia.
 
✓ United (% 800-538-2929; www.united.com) has a once-weekly 
direct flight between Chicago and Liberia.
 
✓ US Airways (% 800-622-1015; www.usairways.com) has a once-
weekly direct flight between Charlotte and Liberia.
In addition, numerous commercial charter flights arrive from various 
North American and European cities throughout the high season. Check 
with your travel agent.
 
 A small, commuter airstrip also lies in Tamarindo. If you’re going to 
Tamarindo (or Playa Grande), and coming from San José, flying into and 
out of Tamarindo is your best option.
Most of the beaches in Guanacaste are between a 25- and 55-minute 
drive from the Liberia airport. If you’re going to Playa Hermosa, Playa 
Ocotal, or the Papagayo Peninsula, you’re best off flying into Liberia. 
Playa Flamingo, Playa Brasilito, Playa Conchal, and Sugar Beach, are 
slightly closer to Tamarindo, but the differences are almost negligible.
Sansa (% 877-767-2672 in the U.S. and Canada, 2290-4100 in Costa Rica; 
www.flysansa.com) and Nature Air (% 800-235-9272 in the U.S. and 

 Chapter 13: Going for Gold in Guanacaste 149
Canada, 2299-6000 in Costa Rica; www.natureair.com) are two local 
commuter airlines with daily service to both Liberia and Tamarindo. The 
flight takes about 50 minutes and costs between $114 and $126 each way.
By bus
Gray Line (% 2220-2126; www.graylinecostarica.com) and 
Interbus (% 2283-5573; www.interbusonline.com) are two private 
bus companies running fleets of modern minivans to all the major desti-
nations in Costa Rica. Both service all the different beaches mentioned 
in this chapter. The fares run between $33 and $45 each way on either 
line.
 
 Both companies will pick you up at most San José–area hotels and drop 
you off at any of the hotels in this region. However, if you’re the first 
pickup, or last drop-off on the route, you may be in for a long and 
tedious wait.
You can also take inexpensive Costa Rican bus lines to many Guanacaste 
beaches. Tickets cost between $5.25 and $8, and the trips take between 
five and six hours. You can buy tickets on the bus or just prior to depart-
ing at the station. In most cases, getting a confirmed ticket in advance is 
very hard and usually unnecessary.
The following is a listing of the schedules, terminal locations, and con-
tact information of the major bus companies servicing the major beach 
destinations of Guanacaste.
 
✓ Playa del Coco: Pulmitan buses (% 2222-1650) leave San José for 
Playa del Coco at 8 a.m., and 2 and 4 p.m. daily, departing from 
Calle 24, between avenidas 5 and 7.
 
✓ Playa Hermosa and Playa Panamá: Tralapa buses (% 2221-7202) 
leave San José daily at 3 p.m., departing from Calle 20, between ave-
nidas 3 and 5, stopping first at Playa Hermosa and next at Playa 
Panamá.
 
✓ Playa Brasilito, Playa Flamingo, and Playa Potrero: Tralapa buses 
(% 2221-7202) leave San José daily at 8 and 10:30 a.m., and 3 p.m., 
departing from Calle 20, between avenidas 3 and 5, stopping at 
playas Brasilito, Flamingo, and Potrero, in that order.
 
✓ Tamarindo: Tracopa-Alfaro buses (% 2222-2160) leave San José 
for Tamarindo at 8:30 and 11:30 a.m., and 3:30 p.m., departing from 
Calle 14 between avenidas 3 and 5. Tralapa (% 2221-7202) also has 
one daily direct bus to Tamarindo, leaving at 4 p.m. from its main 
terminal at Calle 20, between avenidas 3 and 5.
Alternatively, Pulmitan express buses (% 2222-1650 in San José, 2666-
0458 in Liberia) leave San José for Liberia roughly every hour between 
6 a.m. and 8 p.m., from Calle 24 between avenidas 5 and 7. The ride to 
Liberia is four hours. After you’re in Liberia, you can transfer to a local 

Part IV: Guanacaste and Environs 
150
bus to your destination of choice at the main Liberia bus station. In gen-
eral, at least three to four daily buses run between Liberia and each of 
the various Guanacaste beach destinations.
 
 No direct bus service exists to either Playa Ocotal or Playa Grande. 
Playa del Coco is very close to Playa Ocotal, and a cab ride from the bus 
station there should be just about $5. Playa Grande is about a 20-minute 
ride from Tamarindo, and a taxi should charge you around $20 for this 
trip.
By car
Driving to Guanacaste from San José is a relatively easy and straight 
shot, with only two major routes.
If you’re going to any of the more northern beaches, take the 
Interamerican Highway west from San José, and follow the signs for 
Nicaragua and the Guanacaste beaches. Turn left at the major cross-
roads at the entrance to Liberia. This intersection is very well marked, 
and will point you toward Santa Cruz and the various Guanacaste 
beaches. Driving to Liberia from San José takes approximately three and 
a half to four hours. From Liberia, it’s another 25 to 55 minutes to most 
of the beaches in this area.
After the turnoff, the road to the Papagayo Peninsula is prominently 
marked 8km (5 miles) south of the Liberia airport. At the corner here, 
you’ll see a massive Do It Center hardware store and lumberyard.
If you’re going on to Playa Hermosa and Playa Panamá, continue on a 
little farther and, just past the village of Comunidad, turn right. In about 
11km (63⁄4 miles), you’ll come to a fork in the road; take the right fork. 
These roads are relatively well-marked, and a host of prominent hotel 
billboards should make it easy enough to find the beach.
If you continue farther on the road to Santa Cruz, just beyond the town 
of Belén you’ll see the turnoff for Playa Conchal, Playa Flamingo, Playa 
Brasilito, Sugar Beach, and Tamarindo.
If you’re going to Tamarindo, Playa Conchal, Playa Brasilito, or Sugar 
Beach, the most direct route is by way of the La Amistad bridge over the 
Tempisque River. Take the Interamerican Highway west from San José. 
Forty-seven kilometers (29 miles) past the turnoff for Puntarenas, you’ll 
see signs for the turnoff to the bridge. After crossing the river, follow the 
signs for Nicoya and Santa Cruz. Continue north out of Santa Cruz until 
just before the village of Belén, where you’ll find the turnoff for the vari-
ous beaches. In another 20km (12 miles), you’ll hit the village of Huacas. 
Take the left fork for Playa Tamarindo, and head straight for the road to 
Playa Flamingo, Playa Brasilito, Playa Conchal, and Sugar Beach.

 Chapter 13: Going for Gold in Guanacaste 151
Orienting Yourself in Guanacaste
The province of Guanacaste occupies the bulk of Costa Rica’s northwest-
ern land mass, from the northern section of the Nicoya Peninsula up to 
the Nicaraguan border. For tourists, most of Guanacaste’s appeal lies 
with its miles and miles of beautiful beaches. The capital of Guanacaste 
is the city of Liberia, where you’ll find the Daniel Oduber International 
Airport. The city itself holds little appeal for most tourists. In fact, 
although much of Guanacaste province is inland, the only major attrac-
tion here for visitors is the Rincón de la Vieja volcano and the surround-
ing Rincón de la Vieja National Park.
Introducing the beaches and neighborhoods
The beaches of Guanacaste come in various shapes and sizes. Some are 
protected and calm, while others feature strong surf. Some are quite 
developed, while others are home to just a few hotels and small resorts.
Here’s a quick rundown of Guanacaste’s principal beach destinations, 
running (more or less) from north to south.
Papagayo Peninsula
The turnoff for this long narrow peninsula is the first you’ll hit heading 
west from the Liberia airport. So far, only two major hotels have opened 
up here, the Allegro Papagayo Resort and the Four Seasons Resort 
Costa Rica. However, more are on the drawing board. The peninsula 
features several stunning and often deserted beaches, including Playa 
Nacascolo, which is inside the property of the Four Seasons Resort — 
but all beaches in Costa Rica are public, so you cannot be denied entry. 
Almost all the beaches here are very well protected, with little or no 
wave action.
Playa Hermosa and Playa Panama
Surrounded by steep forested hills, Playa Hermosa is a curving gray-
sand beach that is long and wide, with rocky bluffs at either end. It’s also 
relatively protected and is consistently one of the region’s calmest 
beaches for swimming. Fringing the beach is a swath of trees that stays 
surprisingly green right through the dry season. The shade provided by 
these trees, along with the calm protected waters, is a big part of the 
beach’s appeal.
Beyond Playa Hermosa, you’ll find the still underdeveloped Playa 
Panamá and, farther on, the calm waters of Bahía Culebra, a large pro-
tected bay dotted with small, semiprivate patches of beach and ringed 
with mostly intact dry forest. The large Hilton Papagay Resort sits on a 
point dividing Playa Panamá from Bahía Culebra.

Part IV: Guanacaste and Environs 
152
Playa del Coco and Playa Ocotal
Playa del Coco was one of the first beaches in Guanacaste to be devel-
oped, and it has long been a popular destination with middle-class Ticos 
and weekend revelers from San José. It’s also a prime scuba-diving spot. 
The beach, which has grayish-brown sand, is quite wide at low tide and 
almost nonexistent at high tide. In between high and low tides, it’s just 
right.
Playa Ocotal is a tiny pocket cove featuring a small salt-and-pepper 
beach bordered by high bluffs. It’s quite beautiful. When the water is 
calm, you’ll find good snorkeling around some rocky islands close to 
shore here. You’ll see a fair amount of residential development just 
inland here, as well as a couple of small hotels and resorts.
Playas Conchal, Brasilito, Flamingo, and Pan de Azúcar
Playa Conchal is the first in a string of beaches stretching north along 
this coast. For decades, this was the semiprivate haunt of a few beach 
cognoscenti. The Spanish word for shell is concha. The unique beach 
here is made up primarily of soft crushed shells. Nearly every place you 
could walk, turn, or lay down your towel was shell collectors’ heaven. 
Unfortunately, as Conchal has developed and its popularity spread, 
unscrupulous builders have brought in dump trucks to haul away the 
namesake seashells for landscaping and construction, and the impact 
has been noticeable.
Just beyond Playa Conchal to the north, you’ll come to Playa Brasilito, a 
tiny beach town and one of the few real villages in the area. The soccer 
field is in the center of the village, and around its edges you’ll find a 
couple of little pulperías (general stores). Playa Brasilito is popular both 
with Ticos and budget travelers from abroad. You’ll find a few hotels 
and a couple of campsites here.
Playa Flamingo is located on a long spit of land that forms part of 
Potrero Bay. The beach here is a beautiful stretch of white sand. For my 
money, Playa Flamingo has perhaps the prettiest stretch of sand up 
here, and the little town is starting to boom again after years of lying 
seemingly dormant.
If you continue along the road from Brasilito without taking the turn for 
Playa Flamingo, you’ll soon come to Playa Potrero. The sand here is a 
hard-packed brownish gray, but the beach is long, deserted, and quite 
calm for swimming. You can see the hotels of Playa Flamingo across the 
bay. Drive a little farther north, and you’ll find the still undeveloped 
Playa La Penca and, finally, Playa Pan de Azúcar, a beautiful little salt-
and-pepper beach with one lone small resort hotel backing it, Hotel 
Sugar Beach (see the listing later in this chapter).

 Chapter 13: Going for Gold in Guanacaste 153
Playa Grande and Tamarindo
Playa Grande is a long, isolated, and sparsely developed stretch of 
beach with strong surf. It’s very popular with surfers, which can make 
the beach unsuitable for swimming at times. Playa Grande is one of the 
principal nesting sites for the giant leatherback turtle, the largest turtle 
in the world. I almost hate to mention places to stay in Playa Grande 
because the steady influx of tourists and development could spell doom 
for this beach as a turtle nesting site.
 
 Tamarindo is a bustling boomtown and one of the most popular 
beaches on the Gold Coast. Tamarindo boasts a mixture of hotels in a 
variety of sizes and price ranges and an eclectic array of restaurants, as 
well as several seemingly out-of-place modern strip malls.
Rampant development continues to spread up the hills inland from the 
beach and south beyond to Playa Langosta. The beach itself is a long, 
wide swath of white sand that curves gently from one rocky headland to 
another. Behind the beach are low, dry hills that can be a dreary brown 
in the dry season, but they instantly turn green with the first brief show-
ers of the rainy season. Fishing boats bob at their moorings at the south 
end of the beach, and brown pelicans fish just outside the breakers.
The southernmost beaches
The beaches south of Tamarindo are some of the least developed on this 
coast. All are fairly exposed to the open ocean and, thus, popular with 
surfers. In order, heading south, you’ll find the beaches of Avellanas, 
Playa Negra, and Junquillal. All feature just a few small hotels and 
simple restaurants. These are great places to get away from it all.
Rincón de la Vieja National Park
This national park begins on the flanks of the Rincón de la Vieja volcano 
and includes this volcano’s active crater. Down lower, you’ll find an area 
of geothermal activity with fumaroles (cracks where volcanic gases 
escape), geysers, and hot mud pools that create a bizarre, otherworldly 
landscape. In addition to hot springs and mud pots, you can explore 
waterfalls, a lake, and volcanic craters. The bird-watching here is excel-
lent, and the views across the pasturelands to the Pacific Ocean are 
stunning.
Finding information after you arrive
A small information kiosk greets you at the Liberia airport, but invari-
ably your best bet for information will be your hotel front desk, con-
cierge, or tour desk. Almost every hotel in the region has a tour desk; 
you can also find them at tour offices in most major beach towns.

Getting Around Guanacaste
The best way to get around Guanacaste is by taxi or rental car, or as 
part of an organized tour. (For information on the many available tour 
options, see Chapter 14.)
By taxi
Taxis are available at the airport and in all the major beach towns. Any 
hotel in the area can call you a taxi. Rates range from $3 to $6 for short 
rides, to $25 to $50 for longer jaunts between more distant towns and 
destinations.
By car
Many of the major car-rental agencies have offices at the Liberia airport 
and around Guanacaste. Reserving in advance with a company’s U.S. or 
international reservations office is probably best, but you can also rent 
a car for a day or more by calling after you’re in Costa Rica. Any of the 
following car-rental companies will deliver your car to any Guanacaste-
area hotel:

✓ Thrifty (% 800-847-4389 in the U.S. and Canada, 2665-0787 in 
Liberia, 2653-0829 in Tamarindo; www.thrifty.com)
By foot
Most of the beach destinations here are small and easily navigable — in 
and of themselves — by foot. You can even sometimes walk between 
two beach towns or destinations — say, from Playa Conchal to Playa 
Brasilito or from Tamarindo to Playa Langosta. However in most cases, 

 Chapter 13: Going for Gold in Guanacaste 155
you’ll need to find some sort of motorized transportation to get between 
the different beach destinations.
By bus
Public buses are not a practical means for most tourists to get around 
Guanacaste. Although regular local buses connect most of the major 
beach towns and destinations with Liberia, you’ll find virtually no con-
nections among the different beach towns and destinations.
Where to Stay in Guanacaste
Guanacaste is Costa Rica’s fastest-developing tourist destination, and 
the region boasts hotel options to suit any budget and any vacation 
style. Here are the best choices in a broad range of categories.
 
 El Velero Hotel
$$ Playa Hermosa
This longstanding little hotel is a great choice right on the beach in Playa 
Hermosa. White walls and polished tile floors give El Velero a 
Mediterranean flavor. The guest rooms are large, and those on the second 
floor have high ceilings. All have free Wi-Fi. The furnishings are simple, 
though, and some of the bathrooms are a bit small. The hotel has its own 
popular little restaurant, which offers a good selection of meat, fish, and 
shrimp dishes, as well as weekly barbecue fests. Various tours, horseback-
riding, and fishing trips can be arranged through the hotel; however, the 
most popular excursions are the full-day and sunset cruises on the hotel’s 
namesake sailboat.

peak periods. AE, MC, V.
 
 Four Seasons Resort Costa Rica
$$$$$ Papagayo Peninsula
The Four Seasons is by far the most luxurious and impressive large-scale 
resort in Costa Rica. The resort is set near the very end of a long peninsula 
on a narrow spit of land between two white-sand beaches. The majority of 
the rooms are in three long, four-story, oceanfront buildings. The archi-
tecture here is stunning, with most buildings featuring flowing roof 
designs and other touches imitating the forms of turtles, armadillos, and 
butterflies.
All the rooms are very large, with wood floors, rich wood furnishings, 
tasteful fixtures and decorations from around the world, marble bath-
rooms with a deep tub and separate shower, luscious cotton sheets and 
bathrobes, and a large private balcony. The rooms on the third and fourth

floors have the best views and cost a little more. The others have either 
garden views or partial ocean views, even though every room faces the 
sea. On the rocky hill at the end of the peninsula are the resort’s suites 
and villas. These are all similarly appointed, but with even more space and 
often a private pool, a Jacuzzi, or an open-air gazebo for soaking in the 
views.
The resort also features the renowned service of the Four Seasons (includ-
ing family-friendly amenities such as kid-size bathrobes and childproof 
rooms), one of the best-equipped full-service spas in the country, a truly 
spectacular golf course that offers ocean views from 15 of its 18 holes, and 
several excellent dining options. Of the hotel’s restaurants, Papagayo (see 
listing later in this chapter), serving Nuevo Latino cuisine, is my favorite.

Hilton Papagayo Resort
$$$$–$$$$$ Papagayo Peninsula
The very first all-inclusive resort in the Guanacaste region, this place was 
taken over by the Hilton group in 2008. A major overhaul ensued, and the 
resort is in very good shape. Most of the duplex villas can be separated 
into two rooms or shared by a family or two couples. Inside, one room is 
equipped with a king-size bed; the other has two queens. All rooms have 
marble floors, large bathrooms, and small private patios or balconies. The 
resort is quite spread out, so if you don’t want to do a lot of walking or 
wait for the minivan shuttles, request a room near the main pool and res-
taurants. If you want a good view, ask for one on the hill overlooking the 
bay. The hotel has a large, modern, and plush spa facility. It also has its 
own small crescent-shape swath of beach, which is very calm and pro-
tected for swimming.

$530–$630 junior suite. Rates include all food and drinks, a range of activities, and 
taxes. AE, DC, MC, V.
Hotel and Villas Cala Luna
$$$–$$$$$ Tamarindo
If you’re looking for serious luxury in Tamarindo, stay in one of the two- or 
three-bedroom villas here, which are the size of a small home and just as 
well equipped. The living rooms are huge, with high-peaked ceilings, 
couches, tables and chairs, satellite televisions, and complete sound sys-
tems. The full kitchens come with microwave ovens and cappuccino 
machines — even washing machines. If this isn’t enough, each villa has its 
own private swimming pool. The bedrooms are spacious and elegant, with 
either a king-size bed or two double beds. Everything is done in soft

pastels with hand-painted accents, and the red-tile roofs and Mexican tile 
floors add elegance while keeping things cool. Rooms in the hotel are spa-
cious and similarly well done, with their own terraces, but you’ll have to 
share the hotel’s main swimming pool with the rest of the guests. The 
hotel isn’t right on the beach; you have to cross the street and walk a 
short path to reach the ocean. The hotel offers free Wi-Fi in most of its 
common areas.

 Chapter 13: Going for Gold in Guanacaste 159
The lower rooms have air-conditioning and private patios; the upper units 
have plenty of cross ventilation and inviting balconies. All have large bath-
rooms and sitting rooms with fold-down futon couches. In effect, all the 
rooms are really junior suites, with separate sitting/living-room areas. The 
spacious individual bungalows are spread around the shady grounds; 
each comes with a tub in the bathroom and an inviting outdoor shower 
among the trees.
The hotel’s free-form pool is the best I’ve found outside of a large resort. 
The shallow end slopes in gradually, imitating a beach, and a separate 
children’s pool is nearby. Perhaps this hotel’s greatest attribute is its loca-
tion just steps from one of the calmer and more isolated sections of Playa 
Tamarindo.

 Hotel Playa Hermosa Bosque del Mar
$$$–$$$$ Playa Hermosa
Tucked away under shady trees, this sprawling beachfront spread has 
gotten a major remodel and upgrade and is now the premier beachfront 
boutique hotel on Playa Hermosa. The plush oceanfront suites feature 
outdoor Jacuzzis. The garden-view suites are very similar but an indoor 
sauna replaces the Jacuzzi. In both cases, second-floor units have better 
views and higher ceilings. The junior suites are all cozy and well-equipped. 
The whole complex was built around and amongst the lush existing gar-
dens and trees, and employs sustainable practices wherever possible. 
Trees come up and through the main lobby and restaurant, and through 
some of the decks off the rooms. Three of the suites are handicapped 
accessible. The second-floor bar and lounge has great views through the 
trees to the sea. Free Wi-Fi is offered throughout the hotel.

Hotel Sugar Beach
$$$–$$$$ Playa Pan de Azúcar
Hotel Sugar Beach is located on a beautiful, semiprivate, salt-and-pepper 
beach about a ten-minute drive north of Playa Flamingo along a rough dirt 
road. It’s the only hotel in the area, and that’s what gives it most of its 
charm, in my opinion — it boasts lots of seclusion and privacy. The beach 
is on a small cove surrounded by rocky hills. The hotel itself is perched 
above the water. Nature lovers will be thrilled to find wild howler mon-
keys and iguanas almost on their doorsteps. Snorkelers should be happy 
here, too; this cove has some good snorkeling in the dry season. The 
rooms, which come in a variety of sizes and configurations, are all neat,

modern, and comfortable. Some of the better suites are located on a high 
point of land, with wonderful views. However, I prefer the beachfront 
rooms and suites. If you don’t land one of the rooms with a view, head to 
the main lodge and restaurant, which have a commanding view from their 
hillside perch.

Hotel Villa Casa Blanca
$$ Playa Ocotal
With a great hillside perch, beautiful gardens, and attractive rooms, this 
bed-and-breakfast is an excellent choice. Located about 500m (1,640 ft.) 
inland from the beach, all the guest rooms feature fine furnishings and are 
well kept. Some are a tad small, but others are quite roomy and some even 
have kitchenettes. The suites are higher up and have ocean views. My

rancho serves as an open-air bar and breakfast area, and beside this is a 
pretty little lap pool with a bridge over it. Another separate rancho serves 
as a sort of lounge/recreation area and has a satellite television. An invit-
ing hot tub and sitting area awaits you near the pool, and free Wi-Fi is 
offered throughout. These folks manage several rental houses and condos 
in the area, so if you plan to stay for a week or more, or if you need lots of

 JW Marriott Guanacaste Resort & Spa
$$$$–$$$$$ Hacienda Pinilla
The newest large-scale resort in Costa Rica is also one of its best. The 
rooms, facilities, restaurants, amenities, and service here are all top-of-
the-line. All have large flat-screen televisions, separate tubs and showers, 
and a spacious balcony or patio with a cooling retractable shade screen. 
Of the limited number of beachfront rooms, the Marimba suite (no. 339), 
a corner unit, is probably the best in the house. The large spa is modern 
and luxurious. The Mansita beach in front of the resort is a bit rocky, but 
beautiful stretches of Playa Avellanas lie a short walk or shuttle ride away, 
and the hotel also boasts the largest pool in Central America, edging out 
the Paradisus Playa Conchal for the honor.

 Las Tortugas Hotel
$$ Playa Grande
Playa Grande is best known for the leatherback turtles that nest here, and 
much of the beach is now part of Las Baulas National Park, which was 
created to protect the turtles. However, this beach and this hotel are also 
very popular with surfers. Several of the rooms are quite large, and most 
have interesting stone floors and shower stalls. The upper suite has a 
curving staircase that leads to its second room. A few canoes on the 
nearby estuary are available for gentle paddling among the mangroves.
The owners here led the fight to have the area declared a national park 
and continue to do everything possible to protect the turtles. As part of 
the hotel’s turtle-friendly design, a natural wall of shrubs and trees shields 
the beach from the hotel’s light and noise, and the swimming pool is 
shaped like a turtle.

 Paradisus Playa Conchal
$$$$–$$$$$ Playa Conchal
This sprawling all-suite, all-inclusive resort is large and luxurious. From 
the massive, open-air reception building down to the free-form swimming 
pool, everything here is on a grand scale. The rooms feature either one 
king-size bed or two queen-size beds in a raised bedroom nook. Down 
below, you can relax in a comfortable sitting area, with a couch, coffee 
table, and chairs with ottomans. The bathrooms are large and modern, 
with marble tiles, full tubs, bidets, and a telephone. Each unit has a garden 
patio or a small balcony. Only three of the buildings actually front the 
ocean, and in two of these you’ll find the resort’s two presidential suites, 
which have double the living area of the standard suites and even more 
luxurious appointments.

Unlike most all-inclusives, only one of the restaurants here is buffet; the 
others are sit-down where you can order a la carte, although these meals 
are decidedly mediocre. The hotel has a beautiful golf course, with broad, 
open holes; rolling hills; and the occasional sea view. Because of the 
golf course and its ponds and wetlands, good bird-watching is abundant 
here, with healthy populations of parrots, roseate spoonbills, and wood 
storks. The hotel also has an excellent children’s program, as well as 
loads of activities, with both water- and land-based sports equipment for 
guest use.

Sueño del Mar
$$$–$$$$ Playa Langosta
This small bed-and-breakfast has charming little touches and innovative 
décor: four-poster beds made from driftwood; African dolls on the win-
dowsills; Kokopeli candleholders; and open-air showers with sculpted 
angelfish, hand-painted tiles, and lush tropical plants. Fabrics are from 
Bali and Guatemala. Somehow all this works well together, and the requi-
site chairs and lounges nestled under shade trees right on the beach add 
the crowning touch. The two casitas have their own kitchen, veranda, and 
sleeping loft. The honeymoon suite is a spacious second-floor room, with 
wraparound screened-in windows, a delightful open-air shower, and an 
ocean view. The beach right out front is rocky and a bit rough, but it does 
reveal some nice, quiet tidal pools at low tide; it’s one of the better sunset-
viewing spots in Costa Rica. Breakfasts are huge and elaborate. The entire, 
albeit tiny, complex is wired with free Wi-Fi. No children under 12 are 
allowed unless your party rents out the entire hotel.

Villa Alegre
$$$–$$$$ Playa Langosta
This small bed-and-breakfast on Playa Langosta is well-run and homey. 
Each of the rooms is decorated in the theme of a different country. In the 
main house, Guatemala, Mexico, and the United States are all represented. 
Of these, Mexico is the biggest and best, with a large open-air bathroom 
and shower. Every room has its own private patio, courtyard, or balcony. 
The villas are quite spacious, with full kitchenettes. My favorite is the 
Japanese villa, with its subtle design touches and great woodwork. The 
Russian and the United States villas are truly wheelchair-accessible, with 
ramps and modified bathrooms. The smallest units are the Guatemala 
room and the California casita. The beach is just 90m (295 ft.) or so away

Villa del Sueño Hotel
$$–$$$$ Playa Hermosa
This small hotel provides excellent value and attentive service in a beauti-
ful setting. Although Villa del Sueño is not right on the beach (it’s about 
90m/295 ft. from the sand), its well-groomed lawns and gardens feel like 
an oasis in the dust and heat of a Guanacaste dry season. All the rooms 
have cool tile floors, high hardwood ceilings, ceiling fans, and well-placed 
windows for cross ventilation. The second-floor superior rooms have 
more space, larger windows, and air-conditioning. A small pool and open-
air bar are in the center courtyard. Meals are served in the main building’s 
open-air restaurant, which has a stage for live music played here several 
nights a week throughout the high season. In addition, they have a sepa-
rate open-air dinner theater, which has periodic gala performances, as 
well. The folks here manage a neighboring condominium development, 
which has additional apartment and efficiency units available for nightly 
and weekly rental.

Where to Dine in Guanacaste
Café de Playa
$$$ Playa del Coco INTERNATIONAL
This hip restaurant has brought a bit of class and style to Playa del Coco. 
The creative menu covers a lot of ground, with influences from Italy and 
across Asia quite noticeable. Appetizers range from an octopus carpaccio 
to a cold Thai beef salad. There’s a host of pasta choices and a very tasty 
oriental rice salad with smoked tuna, caviar, and avocado. Lobster is 
served several ways, as are tender filets of top grade meats. For dessert, 
be sure to try the passion fruit ice cream. Heavy teak tables and chairs are 
spread around the ample, open-air dining room, or out under the open 
sky. The bar, which is made from thick bamboo, and lounge are dimly lit, 
chic, and very inviting.
See map p. 156. Playa del Coco. % 2670-1621. Reservations recommended in high 
season. Main courses: $12–$20. MC, V. Open: Daily 7 a.m.–10 p.m.

Camarón Dorado
$$–$$$ Playa Brasilito SEAFOOD
With tables and kerosene torches set right in the sand just steps from the 
crashing surf, this is one of my favorite restaurants in the area. More 
tables are available in the simple, open-air dining room, for those who 
don’t want sand in their shoes. The service is semiformal, with the atten-
tive wait staff bringing you a bowl of flower-infused water so that you can 
wash your hands even before you order. The seafood is fresh, well-pre-
pared, and reasonably priced. One time, when I asked to see the wine list, 
two waiters came over carrying about 12 different bottles between them.

 Dragonfly Bar & Grill
$$$ Tamarindo INTERNATIONAL/FUSION
Tucked away on a back street, this restaurant has quickly become one of 
the top choices in Tamarindo, earning fast praise and a loyal following 
with its excellent food and cozy ambience. The menu mixes and matches 
several cuisines, with the Southwestern United States and Pacific Rim 
fusion as the strongest influences. There are daily fish and seafood spe-
cials, which may range from wood-fired red snapper to pistachio crusted 
mahimahi. If you’re in the mood for meat, I recommend the thick chile-
rubbed pork chop with chipotle mashed potatoes. The restaurant space 
itself is a simple open-air establishment, with a concrete floor and rough 
wood tree trunks as support columns. There’s an open wood-fired grill 
and oven on one side, and a popular bar toward the back. They offer free 
Wi-Fi throughout the restaurant.
See map p. 156. Tamarindo % 2653-1506. Reservations recommended. Main 
courses: $10–$16. AE, MC, V. Open: Mon–Sat 6–10 p.m.
Ginger
$$ Playa Hermosa TAPAS
Ginger is one of the hippest and more creative restaurants in the region. 
The architecture and décor are stylish and modern, with sharp angles and 
loads of chrome and glass. The food is an eclectic mix of modern takes on 
wide-ranging international fare, all served as tapas, meant to be shared 
while sampling some of the many cocktails and wines served here. Still, 
you can easily make a full meal of a night here. Order the house special 
ginger-glazed chicken wings, along with some spring rolls, and a plate of 
fresh mahimahi marinated in vodka and Asian spices. You can also order 
more-traditional Mediterranean and Spanish-style tapas, as well as deli-
cious desserts.

La Laguna del Cocodrillo Bistro
$$$$ Tamarindo FUSION
This small restaurant has impressed me every time I’ve eaten here. 
Beautiful presentations and a creative use of ingredients are the norm. 
Start things off with their crab bisque, which is served with a terrine of 
asparagus, avocado, and potato, or opt for the expertly spiced seared 
scallops. For a main dish, try the fresh red snapper, which is stuffed with 
a cognac-flavored mousse. Be sure to save room for dessert, which is 
always excellent. The open-air restaurant space is very small, but when 
the weather permits, more tables are set up under the trees in their beach-
front garden area. Separate restaurateurs also serve breakfast and lunch 
in this space.

 Lola’s
$$–$$$ Playa Avellanas INTERNATIONAL
Long loved by locals, the secret is out about Lola’s. Named after the own-
er’s recently departed pet pig, this place serves up top-notch fresh fare in 
a beautiful open-air beachfront setting. Most of the heavy, homemade 
wooden tables and chairs are set in the sand, under the intermittent shade 
of palm trees and large canvas umbrellas. The fresh seared tuna, big 
healthy salads, and Belgian fries are the favorites here, alongside the fresh 
fruit smoothies and delicious sandwiches on just-baked bread. You’ll have 
to come early on weekends to get a seat.
See map p. 156. On the beach, Playa Avellanas. % 2652-9097. Main courses: $4.50–
$13. No credit cards. Open: Tues–Sun 8 a.m to sunset.
Mar y Sol
$$$$–$$$$$ Playa Flamingo INTERNATIONAL/SEAFOOD
Seventh-generation Catalan chef Alain Taulere has cooked for the likes of 
Henry Kissinger and Prince Rainier of Monaco. For the less well-known 
visitors to his hilltop restaurant in Flamingo Beach, he offers a small, well-
executed menu of fresh seafood and meats. The ambience of the restau-
rant is casually formal, with the open-air main dining room dimly lit by 
old-fashioned lampposts and covered by a thatched roof. The many excel-
lent seafood choices include rich and creamy lobster bisque and a hearty 
bouillabaisse. If you want meat or game, I recommend the duck served 
with passion fruit–cognac sauce. For dessert, try one of the homemade 
tropical fruit ice creams, which are sweet and refreshing. Call in advance 
and they’ll provide free transportation from and back to your hotel.
See map p. 156. Playa Flamingo. % 2654-4151. Reservations recommended. 
Main courses: $17–$39. AE, DC, MC, V. Open: Nov–Apr daily 10 a.m.–3:30 p.m. and 
5–10 p.m.; May–Aug daily 2–10 p.m. Closed Sept–Oct.

Papagayo
$$$$$ Four Seasons Resort NUEVO LATINO
The luxurious Four Seasons (see listing earlier in this chapter) boasts 
one of the best Nuevo Latino (New Latin) restaurants in Costa Rica. 
The menu is always long and creative, but it changes regularly and 
features daily specials. I thoroughly enjoyed my ancho chile–crusted 
rack of lamb served with a mole poblano sauce. The tamarind-crusted ahi 
tuna is also excellent and comes with jalapeño corn pudding and mango 
salsa. The large dining room has high ceilings and low lighting, and it 
features some equally large artworks by renowned Costa Rican painters. 
However, the best seats, weather permitting, are those at the few outdoor 
garden tables.

You’ll enjoy excellent fresh fish and daily specials in the large, open-air, 
poolside restaurant at this modest little resort and condominium project. 
Beyond the pool and down a steep little hill, you can see the Pacific Ocean. 
The menu is pretty simple and straightforward, with a selection of fresh 
seafood dishes, big burgers, excellent fish sandwiches, and large creative 
salads. The daily chalkboard specials are usually more creative and eclec-
tic, ranging from sesame-seared tuna to mahimahi topped with a home-
made curry sauce.

Shlomy Koren has earned a fond and faithful following for both his consis-
tency and creativity. For years he held court at Pachanga. Now located in 
the poolside patio of the Arco Iris Hotel, he continues to please. The con-
temporary cuisine carries a heavy Mediterranean influence: The seared 
tuna in a honey-chili marinade is always a favorite, as is the seafood pasta 
with an unexpected lemon vinaigrette sauce. Desserts often feature home-
made ice creams and sorbets.

Chapter 14
Exploring Guanacaste
In This Chapter
▶ Scoping out the many tour and activity options in Guanacaste
▶ Buying something beyond tourist trinkets
▶ Enjoying Guanacaste’s nightlife
G
uanacaste is vast. Tours and adventure opportunities are abun-
dant. Though you may be content to pass your days soaking in the 
sun and taking the occasional dip in the ocean or pool, you’ll have 
plenty to choose from if you’re feeling more active.
Although most of the tours and adventures listed in this chapter are 
best done as part of a guided excursion, if you have your own rental car, 
or you want to hire a taxi or private guide, you can certainly set them up 
independently.
Seeing Guanacaste by Guided Tour
Nearly all the hotels and resorts in Guanacaste have a tour desk or can 
help you arrange a variety of popular day tours and activities. Prices 
range from $35 to $120 per person, depending on the length of the tour 
and the activity or activities involved.
 
 Be careful before signing up for a trip to a more distant destination. Find 
out how much time will be spent on travel and how much time will be 
spent enjoying the attraction and activities. I don’t recommend the day 
trips to Arenal volcano or Monteverde, for example, because the drive is 
three to four hours each way in a bus or minivan. Still, some folks are 
willing to put up with that much travel time for the chance to visit these 
very worthwhile places. (See Chapters 17 and 18 for more information 
on Arenal and Monteverde.)
Finding out how many other folks will be on the tour with you is also a 
good idea. If you’re going on a rafting trip, or any other tour where the 
group will be broken up into smaller units, group size is not critical. But 
on any nature tour, hike, or other guided activity, I recommend ten 
people per guide as a maximum, with six or fewer people per guide as 
optimal. If you’re the last person in line on an overcrowded nature hike, 

Part IV: Guanacaste and Environs 
170
you’ll have difficulty hearing the guide’s explanations and you’re unlikely 
to see much of the wildlife pointed out to those at the front of the line.
 
 Visits to other lodges and destinations, as well as rafting trips, are best 
done on guided tours. Other activities, including sportfishing and surf-
ing, are best done on your own.
See the map in Chapter 13 for help in locating the following listings.
The Top Attractions
Africa Mia
Forget about howler monkeys, toucans, jaguars, and other new-world 
fauna, this place is filled with large mammals more identified with the 
ancient continent of Africa. The broad, open plains of Guanacaste are 
strikingly similar geographically to those found in Africa, especially in the 
dry season. So it shouldn’t come as too much of a shock to see antelope, 
zebra, giraffe, and elands roaming the grassy plains of Guanacaste. Africa 
Mia (My Africa) offers safari-style, open-jeep tours through its 100-hectare 
private reserve, which is populated with a wide range of nonnative (pre-
dominantly African) species. All the animals are herbivores, so don’t 
expect to see any lions, hyenas, or cheetahs. Still, the trip does provide 
some of the sense of being on the Serengeti or some other African plain, 
and it usually offers up some excellent photographic opportunities.
See map p. 156. On the Interamerican Highway. 8km (5 miles) south of Liberia. % 2666-
1111. www.africamia.net. Admission: $16 adults, $11 children 11 and under. 
Make reservations in advance.
Hacienda Guachipelin
This working cattle and horse ranch is located 23km (14 miles) northeast 
of Liberia on the edge of Rincón de la Vieja National Park.
This is one of the closest lodges to the thermal springs (10km/61⁄4 miles) 
and bubbling mud pots (5km/3 miles) of Rincón de la Vieja National Park. 
Hacienda Guachipelin offers up a range of adventure-tour options, includ-
ing horseback riding, hiking, white-water river inner-tubing, a waterfall 
canyoning-and-rappeling tour, and a more traditional zip-line canopy tour. 
The most popular is the hacienda’s One-Day Adventure Pass, which 
allows you to choose as many of the hotel’s different tour options as you 
want and fit them into one adventure-packed day.
Almost all the beach hotels and resorts of Guanacaste offer day trips here, 
or you can book directly through the lodge, including transportation. If 
you decide to visit this place on your own, be sure to call and make a 
reservation in advance.

 Chapter 14: Exploring Guanacaste 171
 
 During the high season, there’s a bit of a cattle-car feel to the whole opera-
tion, with busloads of day-trippers coming in from the beach. Also, I’ve 
found the inner-tube adventure to be fairly dangerous when the river is 
high, particularly during or just after the rainy season.
See map p. 156. Hacienda Guachipelin. 23km (14 miles) northeast of Liberia on the 
edge of Rincón de la Vieja National Park. To reach the lodge, drive about 5km (3 
miles) north of Liberia and turn right on the dirt road to Rincón de la Vieja National 
Park. The turnoff is well marked. In about 12km (71⁄2 miles), you’ll pass through the 
small village of Curubandé. Continue on this road for another 6km (33⁄4 miles), until 
you reach the Hacienda Guachipelin. If you’re staying at the lodge or doing a tour here, 
you shouldn’t have to pay the $2 toll collected at the lodge gate. % 2665-3303 for 
reservations, 2666-8075 at the lodge. www.guachipelin.com. Admission: Tours 
$25–$80 per person; One-Day Adventure Pass $80 per person, including lunch. Tour 
packages with transportation are available. Open: Daily 7:30 a.m.–5 p.m. (for tours).
Borinquen Thermal Baths
Another popular day trip from Guanacaste is to visit the mud pots and 
thermal waters at the Borinquen Mountain Resort & Spa. Set at the foot of 
a deep valley on the flanks of the Rincón de la Vieja volcano, this place has 
several natural hot-spring pools of differing temperatures, a natural sauna, 
and an area for full-body mud baths given with hot volcanic mud, recently 
collected from steaming volcanic mud pots. After a mud bath and some 
hot soaking, you can lounge by the large free-form swimming pool. 
Borinquen is set on the edge of the rain forest beside gentle creeks, with 
trails to the mud pots and into the forest. There are a couple of pretty 
waterfalls nearby. Hiking, horseback riding, ATV, and canopy tours can be 
added on in conjunction with the hot springs and spa treatments offered 
here.
See map p. 156. Drive 26km (16 miles) north of Liberia along the Interamerican 
Highway. Take the turnoff toward Cañas Dulces, and follow the signs. The hotel is 
approximately 22km (14 miles) from the highway along a rough dirt road. % 2690-
1900. www.borinquenresort.com. Admission: $25 per person for use of the hot 
pools, sauna, and mud baths; $55–$110 for various adventure tours.
Rincón de la Vieja National Park
This national park begins on the flanks of the Rincón de la Vieja volcano 
and includes the volcano’s active crater. Fumaroles, geysers, and hot 
pools can all be observed here. In addition to hot springs and mud pots, 
you can explore waterfalls, a lake, and volcanic craters. The bird-watching 
is excellent, and the views across the pasturelands to the Pacific Ocean 
are stunning.
Several excellent trails run inside the Rincón de la Vieja National Park. 
More-energetic hikers can tackle the 8km (5 miles) up to the summit and 
explore the several craters and beautiful lakes up here. On a clear day, 

Part IV: Guanacaste and Environs 
172
you’ll be rewarded with a fabulous view of the plains of Guanacaste and 
the Pacific Ocean below. The easiest hiking is the gentle Las Pailas loop. 
This 3km (13⁄4-mile) trail is just off the Las Espuelas Park entrance and 
passes by several bubbling mud pots and steaming fumaroles. This trail 
crosses a river, so you’ll have to either take off your shoes or get them 
wet. The entire loop takes around two hours.
 
 My favorite hike here is to the Blue Lake and La Cangrejo waterfall. This 
5km (3-mile) trail passes through several different life zones, including dry 
forest, transitional moist forest, and open savanna. A variety of birds and 
mammals are commonly sighted. Pack a lunch; at the end of your two-
hour hike in, you can picnic at the aptly named Blue Lake, where a 30m 
(98-ft.) waterfall empties into the small pond with crystal-blue hues that 
are amazing.
You can visit Rincón de la Vieja National Park as part of a guided tour or 
with a four-wheel-drive rental vehicle.
See map p. 156. The Las Espuelas park entrance is 25km (16 miles) northeast of 
Liberia, down a badly rutted dirt road. To reach the park entrance, drive about 
5km (3 miles) north of Liberia and turn right on the dirt road to the park. The turnoff is 
well marked. In about 12km (71⁄2 miles), you’ll pass through the small village of 
Curubandé. Continue on this road for another 6km (33⁄4 miles) until you reach the 
Hacienda Lodge Guachipelin. The lodge is private property, and the owners charge 
a $2 toll to pass through their gate and continue on to the park. Pay the toll, pass 
through the lodge’s gate, and continue for another 4km (21⁄2 miles) until you reach the 
park entrance. % 2661-8139. Admission: $10. Open: Daily 7 a.m.–3 p.m.
 Rio Corobicí Rafting
This class II river makes for very gentle rafting, although you’ll also find a 
few mild rapids. The put-in (spot where the rafting starts) is located just 
off the Interamerican Highway beside the Restaurant Rincón Corobicí, 
about 40km (25 miles) south of Liberia. Along the way, you may see many 
of the area’s more exotic animal residents: howler monkeys, iguanas, cai-
mans, coatimundis, otters, toucans, parrots, motmots, trogons, and many 
other bird species. Aside from your binoculars and camera, a bathing suit 
and sunscreen are the only things you’ll need.
All the tour agencies and tour desks in the area can book this for you, or 
you can call Safaris Corobicí (%/fax 2669-6191; www.nicoya.com) and 
set it up for yourself. These folks offer a variety of options, including sepa-
rate trips on the Bebedero River. For a much wetter and wilder ride, the 
folks at Hacienda Guachipelin (see listing later in this chapter) offer 
white-water inner-tube trips on the narrow Río Negro, near their lodge.
Safaris Corobicí. Main office is on the Interamerican Highway, KM193, 40km (25 
miles) south of Liberia, and about 1km (2⁄3 mile) south of the Restaurant Rincón 
Corobicí. %/fax 2669-6191. www.nicoya.com. Admission: $38 for a 2-hour float, 
$62 for a half-day trip including lunch. Open: Daily 8 a.m.–4 p.m.

 Chapter 14: Exploring Guanacaste 173
Sea Turtle Nesting
Giant leatherback sea turtles nest on Playa Grande between late September 
and late February. The turtles come ashore to lay their eggs only at night. 
During the nesting season, you’ll be inundated with opportunities to sign 
up for the nightly tours, which usually cost around $35 to $60 per person.
Do-it-yourselfers can drive over to Playa Grande and book a tour directly 
with the National Parks Service (% 2653-0470; $25). The Parks Service 
operates out of a small shack next to the turtle museum and opens each 
evening at around 6 p.m. to begin taking reservations. However, spots fill up 
fast, and you’ll be competing with the local tour operators who tend to 
snap up the prime spots first. If you don’t have a reservation, you may have 
to wait until really late, and may not be able to go out onto the beach at all.
Between July and November, the smaller Olive Ridley sea turtles nest on 
several other beaches in Guanacaste, including the northern beaches inside 
Santa Rosa National Park, and the more southern beach of Ostional. When 
the Olive Ridley are nesting, tours are available to these beaches as well. 
The Olive Ridley arribadas (nestings) are unique because they come ashore 
in massive numbers, even during the daytime. Note: No flash photography 
is allowed because any sort of light can confuse the turtles and prevent 
them from laying their eggs; guides must use red-tinted flashlights.
 
 Turtle nesting is a natural, unpredictable, and rare event. Moreover, 
things have gotten worse in recent years. The number of nesting turtles 
on Playa Grande was severely down a couple of years ago. All indications 
are that excessive building and lighting close to the beach are the culprits. 
Even during heavy nesting years, you sometimes have to wait your turn 
for hours, hike quite a ways, and even accept the possibility that no nest-
ing mothers will be spotted that evening.
See map p. 156 for Playa Grande. Located on the main beach access road to Playa 
Grande 200m (2 blocks) before it hits the ocean, 100m (1 block) before the hotel Las 
Tortugas. % 2653-0470. Admission: $15. Open: 6 p.m.–2 a.m. (roughly) during turtle 
season (late Sept–late Feb).
More Cool Things to See and Do
All the options listed in this section are probably best done on your 
own, either in a rental car or by taxi. However, most of the hotel tour 
desks and independent tour operators can book you almost any of the 
tours or adventures listed here as well.
Visiting some of the lesser-known beaches
Although none of the beaches in Guanacaste ever gets truly crowded, 
it is still possible and profoundly rewarding to find your own patch of 
sand on one of the more isolated or less developed beaches in this area.

Part IV: Guanacaste and Environs 
174
 
✓ At the northern end of the province, the Papagayo Peninsula has a 
number of very remote and undeveloped beaches to choose from. 
Playa Nacascolo, which sits within the property of the Four 
Seasons, is one of the top beaches in this area. All beaches in Costa 
Rica are public property and open to anyone, and the Four Seasons 
provides parking and access for people visiting Playa Nacascolo.
 
✓ Farther south, Playa Panamá is a long and lovely beach with just 
one or two simple restaurants and a couple of hotels.
 
✓ You’ll find a real treasure trove of remote beaches around the 
Playa Flamingo and Playa Conchal area. From these popular spots, 
several largely unexplored beaches lie in either direction, including 
Playa La Penca, Playa Prieta, Playa Pan de Azúcar, Playa Real, 
and a few that are, for all intents and purposes, unnamed.
 
✓ Although Tamarindo is easily the most developed and crowded 
beach in the area, just to the north of it, Playa Grande is seldom 
crowded, and to the south, such beaches as Playa Avellanas, 
Playa Negra, and Playa Junquillal are known to only a few 
cognoscenti.
 
✓ If you head to Playa Avellanas, be sure to have a drink or lunch at 
Lola’s (% 2652-9097).
 
 If you’re feeling really adventurous, rent an ATV. These rugged and easy-
to-drive vehicles are available to rent at all the major beach destinations 
and cost $60 to $90 for the day.
Going under: Scuba diving
Some of Costa Rica’s best diving can be had around the offshore islands 
and underwater rock formations of Guanacaste. Most hotel and tour 
desks can arrange a dive trip for you. Many also offer certification 
courses or shorter resort courses, the latter of which will get you some 
basic instruction and a controlled dive in the shortest amount of time.
A two-tank dive should run between $70 and $140 per person, depending 
primarily on the distance traveled to the dive sites.
An interesting stop on your way to Liberia
If you’re driving to or from Guanacaste, be sure to take a brief break to check out the 
Catholic Church in Cañas. Well-known painter, installation artist, and local prodigal son 
Otto Apuy has designed and directed the envelopment of the entire church in colorful 
mosaic. The work uses whole and broken tiles in glossy, vibrant colors to depict both 
religious and abstract themes. The church is located in the center of town, just a few 
blocks off the Interamerican Highway.

 Chapter 14: Exploring Guanacaste 175
If you don’t set up your dive trip through your hotel, several very repu-
table dive operations are in the area. The best of these are
 
✓ Diving Safaris de Costa Rica (% 2672-1259; www.costarica
diving.net) in Playa Hermosa. These folks have a large shop and 
offer a wide range of trips to numerous dive spots. They also offer 
night dives, multiday packages, certification classes, and Nitrox 
dives, which are done with specialized oxygen-enriched tanks.
 
✓ Resort Divers (% 2672-0106; www.resortdivers-cr.com) has 
set up shop at several of the hotels in this area.
 
✓ Rich Coast Diving (% 800-434-8464 in the U.S. and Canada, 2670-
0176 in Costa Rica; www.richcoastdiving.com) is an excellent 
operator based in Playa del Coco.
Hoisting sail
The winds off Costa Rica’s Pacific coast are somewhat fickle and can 
often be slight to nonexistent. However, from December through March, 
they can be quite strong, with impressive gusts. Still, plenty of sailing 
options abound if you want to head to sea here.
A host of different boats take out day charters ranging from a few hours 
to a full day. Many include some food and drinks, as well as a break or 
two for some swimming or snorkeling. Some will take you to a deserted 
beach, and others let you throw a line overboard for fishing.
Rates run around $35 to $55 per person for a few hours or a sunset 
cruise, $60 to $120 per person for longer outings.
If your hotel can’t line up a sail for you, here are a few good boats to 
check out:
 
✓ Blue Dolphin (% 2653-0446; www.sailbluedolphin.com), a 
12m (40-ft.) catamaran based out of Tamarindo
 
✓ Samonique III (% 8388-7870; www.costarica-sailing.com), a 
15.6m (52-ft.) ketch sailing out of Playa Flamingo
 
✓ Shannon (% 8827-5533; www.flamingobeachcr.com), a 15.6m 
(52-ft.) cutter working out of Playa Flamingo
 
✓ Kuna Vela (% 8301-3030; www.kunava.com), a 14.3m (47-ft.) 
ketch plying the waters off Playa del Coco
Hanging ten: Surfing and surf lessons
The Guanacaste coast is home to some of Costa Rica’s best and most 
consistent surf breaks. Whether you’re already a pro or you’re looking 
to get your feet wet, you’ll find beaches and breaks that are just right 
for you.

Part IV: Guanacaste and Environs 
176
 
✓ Tamarindo is by far the best place for those looking to learn 
how to surf. There are several good surf schools in town, as well 
as a variety of surf shops where you can rent a board. Check out 
Tamarindo Surf School (% 2653-0923; www.tamarindosurf
school.com) or Witch’s Rock Surf Camp (% 2653-1262; www.
witchsrocksurfcamp.com).
 
 
✓ Experienced surfers will probably want to rent a car and head to 
the less crowded beaches south of Tamarindo, including Playa 
Avellanas and Playa Negra, or just north of Tamarindo to Playa 
Grande.
 
✓ Another option is to take a boat trip to the isolated point breaks of 
Witch’s Rock and Ollie’s Point, which are deep inside the remote 
Santa Rosa National Park. Diving Safaris de Costa Rica (% 2672-
1259) and Aqua Sport (% 2672-0050) offer trips for up to six surf-
ers for around $250, including lunch, leaving from Playa Hermosa.
Landing a big one
 
 The waters off Guanacaste’s coast are teaming with fish and world-class 
sportfishing opportunities. Anglers can land marlin and sailfish, as well 
as tuna, dorado, roosterfish, and more.
A half-day of fishing, with boat, captain, food, and tackle, should cost 
between $200 and $600 for two to four passengers; a full day should run 
between $500 and $1,600. The wide range in prices reflects a wide range 
in the size of the boats, equipment, and distance traveled.
 
 Although fishing is good all year, the peak season for billfish is between 
mid-April and August.
A host of boats and captains dot the Guanacaste coast. The Flamingo 
Marina, the area’s largest marina, is currently closed, but, at press time, 
it was due to open soon. Another marina will be built in the coming 
years on the Papagayo Peninsula. Here are some of the better operators:
 
✓ Capullo Sportfishing (% 2653-0048; www.capullo.com) in 
Tamarindo
 
✓ Oso Viejo (% 8827-5533; www.flamingobeachcr.com) in Playa 
Flamingo
 
✓ Tamarindo Sportfishing (% 2653-0090; www.tamarindosport
fishing.com) in Tamarindo
 
✓ Tranquilamar (% 8814-0994; www.tranquilamar.com) in Playa 
del Coco
Teeing off: Golf in Guanacaste
Golf is just beginning to take off in Costa Rica, but you’ll find three of the 
country’s best courses in Guanacaste.

 Chapter 14: Exploring Guanacaste 177
The Paradisus Playa Conchal (% 888-336-3542 in the U.S. or 2654-4123 
in Costa Rica; www.solmelia.com) is home to an excellent golf course 
featuring a few wonderful views of the ocean. This Robert Trent Jones–
designed resort course is currently still open to the walk-in public, but 
as the all-inclusive resort itself gets more popular, it may restrict public 
access.
Currently, it costs $200 in greens fees for as many rounds as you can 
squeeze into one day, including a cart. If you tee off after 1 p.m., it’s 
just $160.
South of Tamarindo, Hacienda Pinilla (% 2680-7000; www.hacienda
pinilla.com) is a beautiful, 18-hole, links-style course. The course 
is currently accepting golfers staying at hotels around the area, with 
advance reservations. The course is very convenient for folks staying 
at the JW Marriott resort. Greens fees run around $185 for 18 holes, 
including a cart.
Finally, the most impressive course in the country is the Arnold Palmer–
designed course at the Four Seasons Resort (% 800-819-5053 in the 
U.S., 2696-0000 in Costa Rica; www.fourseasons.com/costarica). 
This stunning and challenging course features ocean views from 15 of its 
18 holes. However, the course is only open to hotel guests.
Canopy tours
If you want to try one of the zip-line canopy tours, your best bet in this 
area is the Canyon Tour operation at Hacienda Guachipelin (% 2665-
3303; www.guachipelin.com). This tour has a little bit of everything, 
with treetop platforms as well as cables crisscrossing a deep mountain 
canyon, some suspended bridges, a couple of pendulum swings, and two 
rappels.
However, if you don’t want to head that far afield, several other options 
are spread around Guanacaste, including the following:
 
✓ Congo Trail Canopy Tour (% 2200-5176) is located near Playa del 
Coco and Playa Hermosa, and has 11 platforms connected by a 
series of cables.
 
✓ Witch’s Rock Canopy Tour (% 2667-0661) is located just before 
the entrance to the Four Seasons (see Chapter 13). The two-and-a-
half-hour tour covers 3km (13⁄4 miles) of cables and suspended 
bridges touching down on 24 platforms.
Canopy tours are no longer available right in Tamarindo, but the 
Santa Rosa Canopy Tour (% 2653-0926) and Cartagena Canopy Tour 
(% 2675-0801) are nearby. Of these two, I recommend the Cartagena 
tour, which has a much more lush forest setting.

Part IV: Guanacaste and Environs 
178
Horseback riding
If you don’t want to take one of the full-day tours to one of the remote 
lodges listed under “The Top Attractions,” earlier in this chapter, you 
can still ride a horse for an hour or more at most beach destinations in 
Guanacaste. Rates run from $10 to $30 per hour.
 
 Be careful, many of the folks offering horseback riding, especially those 
plying the beaches themselves, are using poorly trained and poorly kept 
animals. Be sure you feel comfortable with the condition and training of 
your mount.
If your hotel tour desk can’t arrange this for you, the following compa-
nies are all reputable, with good horses:
 
✓ Casagua Horses (% 2653-8041)
 
✓ Brasilito Excursions (% 2654-4237)
 
✓ Flamingo Equestrian Center (% 2654-4089)
Shopping for Local Treasures
Simply put, the shopping scene in Guanacaste is disappointing. Mostly, 
you’ll find hotel gift shops and simple souvenir stands. A couple of large 
souvenir shops, catering to large-scale tourist traffic, have popped up 
along the highway between the Guanacaste beaches. The best of these is 
Kaltak Arts and Craft Market (% 2667-0696), located on the main road 
between Liberia and the beach towns 19km (113⁄4 miles) from Liberia, 
5km (3 miles) from the airport.
 
 The ceramic wares produced in the small village of Guaitil are a notable 
exception to Guanacaste’s standard trinkets. These low-fired works fea-
ture locally produced dyes and traditional indigenous design motifs. 
You’ll find plates and bowls and a variety of functional pieces here.
Guaitil is located 12km (71⁄2 miles) inland from the city of Santa Cruz. The 
road is paved the entire way. Many of the hotels and tour desks around 
Guanacaste offer tours to Guaitil.
However, if you don’t take the trip out to the village itself, be sure to 
stop at one or more of the many roadside stands selling Guaitil pottery 
all along the road between Liberia and the Guanacaste beaches.
Living It Up After Dark
 
 All the various beach towns and large resorts have their own bars and 
dance-club scenes throughout most of the high season. If you want to 
venture away from your hotel or resort, Tamarindo is by far the most 
raucous town on this coast.

 Chapter 14: Exploring Guanacaste 179
The most happening bar and club in Tamarindo is Bar 1 (% 2653-2586), 
an open-air, second-floor affair. Other popular spots include the Crazy 
Monkey Bar (% 2653-0114), at the Best Western Vista Villas; Aqua 
(% 2653-2782), on the main road into town; and the bar at the Hotel 
Pasatiempo (see Chapter 13), which has a giant television for sporting 
events and sometimes features live music.
Popular with Ticos, Playa del Coco is another of Costa Rica’s livelier 
beach towns after dark. Cocomar (% 2670-0167) is the main dance club 
in town. It’s located just off the little park right on the beach. (If these 
directions don’t get you there, just follow the loud music.) However, for 
a more sophisticated scene, head to Café de Playa (% 2670-1621), a 
beachfront club, restaurant, and bar that sometimes has live music, or 
Zouk Santana (% 2670-0191; www.zouksantana.com), a hip, Euro-
style nightclub with local and visiting DJs spinning dance tunes most 
nights. For a mellower scene, try the Lizard Lounge (% 2760-0307), 
which has a pool table and a laid-back tropical vibe.
In quiet Playa Hermosa, I recommend the Upper Deck Sports Bar 
(% 2672-1276), just off the main road.
If you’re into gaming, you’ll be interested in the several casinos around 
Guanacaste. In Playa del Coco, you can head to the small casino at the 
Coco Bay Hotel & Casino (% 2670-0494). In Playa Flamingo, Amberes 
(% 2654-4001) has a small casino as well. The best casinos in the area 
are in Tamarindo, where you’ll find the popular Jazz Casino (% 2653-
0406) in downtown Tamarindo and another out in Playa Langosta at the 
Barceló Langosta Beach resort (% 2653-0363).

Part V
Manuel Antonio 
and Environs

In this part . . .
I
n addition to being home to Costa Rica’s most popular 
national park, Manuel Antonio National Park, Manuel 
Antonio is the heart of Costa Rica’s central Pacifi c coast. This 
part gives you the lowdown on the highlights to be found in 
the Manuel Antonio area. Then I tell you about other interest-
ing options to be found up and down this coast, from the 
breathtaking luxury of the hillside villas at Villa Caletas, to 
the remote beaches and small hotels south of Dominical.

Manuel Antonio

▶ Deciding where to stay and dine in Manuel Antonio

▶ Having fun and adventures in Manuel Antonio
M
anuel Antonio is Costa Rica’s single most-popular destination. It’s 
a virtual one-stop shop of the best that Costa Rica has to offer: 
beautiful beaches, lush rain forests, abundant wildlife, oodles of adven-
ture opportunities, excellent restaurants, and romantic boutique hotels.
The compact Manuel Antonio National Park is the crowning jewel of this 
area. Its several nearly perfect small beaches are connected by gentle 
trails that meander through a rain forest that’s home to endangered 
squirrel monkeys, three-toed sloths, purple-and-orange crabs, and hun-
dreds of other species of birds, mammals, and plants.
However, Manuel Antonio’s popularity means it tends to be more 
crowded than most of Costa Rica’s other beach destinations. Develop-
ment here is leaving a noticeable footprint. What was once a smattering 
of small hotels tucked into the forested hillside has become a seemingly 
unbroken string of lodgings, souvenir shops, restaurants, bars, and 
adventure outfitters lining the winding road between Quepos and the 
national park entrance.
Still, this remains one of the most beautiful locations in the entire coun-
try. Gazing down on the blue Pacific from high on the hillsides of Manuel 
Antonio, it’s almost impossible not to sit in awe of the surrounding 
beauty — from the offshore, rocky islands dotting the vast expanse of 
blue ocean to the rich, deep green of the rain forest sweeping down to 
the water.

Part V: Manuel Antonio and Environs 
184
Getting There
You can fly, drive, or be driven to Manuel Antonio. The small airstrip in 
Quepos is served by a host of daily commuter flights from San José, and 
this is, by far, the easiest means of getting there. If you want the inde-
pendence of your own car, you can drive to Quepos and Manuel Antonio 
in about four hours along paved roads. Finally, you can take a bus or 
private minivan service. I list more details about all these options in the 
following sections.
By air
Nature Air (% 800-235-9272 in the U.S. and Canada, 2299-6000 in Costa 
Rica; www.natureair.com) and Sansa (% 877-767-2672 in the U.S. and 
Canada, 2290-4100 in Costa Rica; www.flysansa.com) have several 
daily flights from San José to the small Quepos airport. Nature Air flies 
from the Tobías Bolaños International Airport in Pavas, while Sansa 
leaves from San José’s Juan Santamaría International Airport. The flight 
takes just 30 minutes and costs between $75 and $80 each way.
Both Sansa and Nature Air provide airport-transfer service coordinated 
with their arriving flights. The service costs around $9 per person each 
way, depending on exactly where your hotel is located. Speak to your 
airline’s agent when you arrive to confirm your return flight and to coor-
dinate a pickup at your hotel for that day, if necessary.
Private cars and official taxis, which are painted red, will also be waiting 
outside the airport to be hailed. Expect to be charged between $8 and 
$12 per car for up to four people, depending on the distance to your 
hotel and your bargaining abilities.
Both Nature Air and Sansa have direct flights between Quepos and other 
popular destinations in Costa Rica, including Liberia, Tamarindo, Arenal 
and the southern Zone.
By car
There are several routes to Manuel Antonio.
The traditional and most popular route from San José is a narrow and 
winding two-lane road, the “old highway,” over and through mountains. 
This road is equal parts scenic and harrowing — it’s not uncommon to 
encounter buses and trucks passing on blind curves, or to find yourself 
at the back of a long line of cars stuck behind a slow-moving truck, 
crawling up one of the steep hills.
Begin this route by taking the Interamerican Highway west out of San 
José and exiting just west of Alajuela near the town of Atenas. Follow any 
of the numerous signs to any hotel in Jacó or Manuel Antonio. The old 
highway meets the Costanera (Coastal) highway a few kilometers west 
of Orotina. From here it’s a straight and flat shot down the coast. You’ll 

 Chapter 15: Enjoying Magnificent Manuel Antonio 185
hit Playa Herradura first, and then Jacó, before getting to Manuel 
Antonio.
However, this route may soon be obsolete. Thirty years in the planning, 
and almost endlessly delayed, a new highway is being built connecting 
San Jose with Orotina, via the western suburbs of Santa Ana and Ciudad 
Colón. When completed, this new toll highway is expected to substan-
tially reduce the drive time to Manuel Antonio and the rest of the Central 
Pacific coast. The highway is slated to open in late 2009, but given its 
history, I wouldn’t be surprised if it’s somewhat delayed.
If you’re coming from anywhere in northern Costa Rica, your best option 
is to take the Interamerican Highway, get off at the Puntarenas exit, 
and follow signs to Caldera. From there, head south on the Costanera 
Highway.
Whichever way you come, you’ll first hit the small port city of Quepos 
when you finally get close to Manuel Antonio. To continue on to Manuel 
Antonio, cross the bridge into town and take the lower road (to the left 
of the high road). In 4 blocks, turn left; you’ll be on the road to Manuel 
Antonio. This road winds through Quepos a bit for about 10 to 15 min-
utes before starting over the hill to all the hotels and the national park.
 
 See Chapter 16 for advice on a good crocodile sightseeing stop during 
your drive.
By bus
Express and local buses (% 2223-5567 in San José, 2777-0263 in 
Quepos) to Manuel Antonio leave San José throughout the day from the 
Coca-Cola bus terminal at Calle 16 between avenidas 1 and 3.
The ride takes around three and a half hours and costs $5.50 on the 
express bus. The local buses cost a little less but take a bit longer. 
They’re also usually older buses and much less comfortable. I highly 
recommend taking an express bus.
The express buses go all the way to the national park entrance and will 
drop you off at any of the hotels along the way. The local buses will drop 
you off at the main bus terminal in Quepos.
Gray Line (% 2220-2126; www.graylinecostarica.com) and 
Interbus (% 2283-5573; www.interbusonline.com) have regular ser-
vice to Quepos and Manuel Antonio. The fare with Gray Line is $35; with 
Interbus, it’s $39.
 
 In the busy winter months, tickets sell out well in advance, especially on 
weekends. If you can, purchase your ticket several days in advance. 
However, you must buy your Quepos-bound tickets in San José and your 
San José return tickets in Quepos.

Part V: Manuel Antonio and Environs 
186
If you’re staying in Manuel Antonio, you can buy your return ticket 
for a direct bus in advance in Quepos. The main bus station is in down-
town Quepos, next to the main market. If you’ve bought your ticket in 
advance, you can wait along the road to be picked up. No particular bus 
stop exists; just make sure you’re out to flag down the bus and give it 
time to stop — you don’t want to be standing in a blind spot when the 
bus comes flying around some tight corner.
Orienting Yourself in Manuel Antonio
Manuel Antonio is a bucket term that often refers to one or more of the 
following: the small city of Quepos, Manuel Antonio National Park, and 
the winding road that connects these two.
Quepos is a small fishing and port city at the mouth of the Boca Vieja 
Estuary. A 7km (41⁄3-mile) road connects Quepos to Manuel Antonio 
National Park. All along the road, you’ll find the many hotels, restau-
rants, and shops that are considered part of Manuel Antonio — as 
opposed to Quepos. For all intents and purposes, the road ends at the 
national park entrance, although a small side street branches off it here, 
where you’ll find some more hotels and restaurants.
The Costanera Highway South that connects Jacó to Quepos passes 
through the town and continues on toward Dominical. Just outside the 
city center, you’ll find the small Quepos airstrip, as well as the local 
hospital.
Manuel Antonio and Quepos don’t have official tourist information 
offices, but a few tour-booking agencies masquerade as such. Most 
hotels have a knowledgeable front desk staff, concierge, or in-house 
tour desk that can answer any questions. Also, keep an eye out for 
Quepolandia, a free, bimonthly, local tourist magazine that is loaded 
with information, articles, and advertisements; it’s available at a host 
of local souvenir shops, restaurants, and hotel lobbies.
Getting Around Manuel Antonio
Getting around and between Quepos and Manuel Antonio is easy. Taxis 
are plentiful, and regular local bus service runs throughout the day.
The bus between Quepos and Manuel Antonio takes 15 minutes each 
way and runs roughly every half-hour from 6 a.m. to 7 p.m. daily, with 
one late bus leaving Quepos at 10 p.m. and returning from Manuel 
Antonio at 10:25 p.m.
The buses, which leave from the main bus terminal in Quepos, near the 
market, go all the way to the national park entrance before turning 
around and returning. You can flag down these buses from any point on 
the side of the road. The fare is 30¢.

 Chapter 15: Enjoying Magnificent Manuel Antonio 187
A taxi between Quepos and Manuel Antonio (or any hotel along the road 
toward the park) costs between $4 and $6. Taxis are supposed to use 
meters, although this isn’t always the case. If your taxi doesn’t have a 
meter, or the driver won’t use it, try to negotiate in advance. Ask your 
hotel desk what a specific ride should cost, and use that as your guide. 
At night, or if the taxi must leave the main road (for hotels such as La 
Mariposa and Makanda-by-the-Sea) the charge is a little higher. If you 
need to call a taxi, dial % 2777-3080 or 2777-0425.
You can also rent a car from Adobe (% 2777-4242), Alamo (% 2777-
3344), Economy (% 2777-5260), Hertz (% 2777-3365), or Payless 
(% 2777-0115) for around $50 to $90 a day. All have offices in down-
town Quepos, but with advance notice, they’ll have someone meet you 
at the airport with your car for no extra charge.
 
 There’s little reason to rent a car in Quepos and Manuel Antonio 
because taxis are cheap and plentiful. Moreover, most tours and many 
attractions include transportation in their outings and admissions. The 
only good reason to rent a car in town is if you want to explore the 
coastline north and south of Quepos. In that case, a rental car is your 
best option.
 
 Car break-ins are common here. If you rent a car, never leave anything of 
value in it unless you intend to stay within sight of the car at all times. 
Instead, park in one of the parking lots just outside the park entrance 
that cost around $3 for the entire day. Although these lots are your 
safest bet, you still shouldn’t leave anything of value exposed in the 
car’s interior. Instead, use the trunk or bring your valuables with you.
Spending the Night
Manuel Antonio’s growing popularity has brought increased develop-
ment and ever-expanding crowds of beachgoers. This means that you’ll 
find scores of hotels, in all sizes and price ranges. The best (and most 
expensive hotels) usually boast rooms with private balconies, featuring 
the classic Manuel Antonio forest-to-ocean views.
 
 Getting a bewitching view of the Manuel Antonio forest has its own set 
of drawbacks. If you want this great view, you probably can’t stay on the 
beach — in fact, you probably won’t be able to walk to the beach. This 
means that you’ll be driving back and forth, taking taxis, or riding the 
public bus a lot.
Also, keep in mind that it’s hot and humid here, and it rains a lot. Of 
course, the rain is what keeps Manuel Antonio lush and green, and this 
wouldn’t be the tropics if things were otherwise.
If you’re traveling on a rock-bottom budget or you’re mainly interested 
in sportfishing, you may want to stay in Quepos instead of Manuel 
Antonio.

 Arenas del Mar
$$$$–$$$$$ Manuel Antonio
This hotel is the complete package — with direct beach access, rain-forest 
setting and surroundings, fabulous views, and luxurious accommoda-
tions. Designed and built by the folks behind Finca Rosa Blanca (see 
p. 102), this place features seven three-story buildings, with large, luxuri-
ous one- and two-bedroom rooms and apartments. Not all have ocean 
views, so be sure to specify if you want one. The top-floor rooms of the 
highest building (no. 7) would be my top choice, while buildings 1, 2, and 
3 are closest to the beach. All rooms are very large and most have outdoor 
Jacuzzi tubs on their private balconies. The apartments are immense two-
bedroom/three-bathroom affairs with a kitchenette, perfect for families 
and longer stays.
The restaurant, lobby, and main pool are set on the highest point of land 
here, and there are several spots with fabulous views of Manuel Antonio’s 
Cathedral Point. A second pool and snack bar are located down near the 
beach. The owners are truly concerned about the environment and pro-
moting sustainable tourism. Free daily yoga classes and loads of relaxing 
treatments can be enjoyed at the hotel’s spa, and free Wi-Fi access is avail-
able throughout the hotel.

blocky buildings. Rooms feature wooden floors, contemporary furnish-
ings, plasma-screen televisions with complete home theater systems,

Hotel Costa Verde
$$–$$$ Manuel Antonio
Located more than halfway down the hill to Manuel Antonio, about a ten-
minute walk from the beach, Costa Verde has rooms in a wide range of 
sizes and prices. Some of the buildings are quite a hike from the hotel’s 
reception and restaurants, so be sure you know exactly what type of room 
you’ll be staying in and where it’s located. The best rooms here have 
ocean views, kitchenettes, private balconies, and loads of space. Though 
some of these don’t have air-conditioning, that’s not a problem because 
they feature huge screened walls to encourage cross ventilation. If you 
want to splurge, try the enormous penthouse suite with a commanding 
view of the spectacular surroundings.
Three small pools are set into the hillside, with views out to the ocean, 
and the hotel has a couple of miles of private trails through the rain forest. 
Costa Verde is located more than halfway down the hill to Manuel Antonio, 
about a ten-minute walk from the beach.

double. Rates lower in the off season, higher during peak weeks. AE, MC, V.
 
 Hotel Malinche
$ Quepos
This downtown Quepos hotel is the best budget choice in town. Look for 
the Hotel Malinche’s arched brick entrance on the first street to your left 
as you come into Quepos. Inside, you’ll find bright rooms with louvered 
windows. The rooms are small but have hardwood or tile floors and clean 
bathrooms. Although it’s almost always very warm, if not downright hot, 
in Quepos, be forewarned that most of the rooms have cold-water show-
ers. The more expensive rooms are larger and have air-conditioning, TVs, 
and on-demand heated showerheads.

AE, MC, V.
 
 Hotel Plinio
$ Manuel Antonio
This hotel is built into a steep hillside, and it’s a bit of a climb from the 
parking lot up to the guest rooms and restaurant. When you’re up top, 
though, you’ll think you’re in the forest, or some sort of treehouse. The 
rooms feature floors and walls of polished hardwood, and you’ll even find 
rooms with tree-trunk pillars. The suites, built on either two or three 
levels, are the best value. The three-story suites have rooftop decks. 
My favorite room is known as the “jungle house” and is set back in the 
forest. Behind the hotel rests a private reserve with 15km (91⁄3 miles) of 
trails and, at the top of the hill, a 15m-tall (49-ft.) observation tower with 

 Chapter 15: Enjoying Magnificent Manuel Antonio 191
an incredible view. In addition to the popular Plinio Restaurant (see later 
in this chapter), lunches are served at the poolside grill.
See map p. 189. Manuel Antonio. % 2777-0055. Fax: 2777-0558. www.hotel

include breakfast buffet in high season. Rates lower May–Nov, but breakfast is not 
included. V.
 
 Hotel Sí Como No
$$$$ Quepos
Sí Como No is a lively midsize resort that offers an array of facilities and 
modern amenities, all with an ecologically conscious attitude. The wood 
used here is farm-grown, and although all the rooms have energy-efficient 
air-conditioning units, guests are urged to use them only when necessary. 
The standard rooms (housed in the hotel’s main building or in the ground 
floor of a villa) are quite acceptable, but it’s worth the splurge for a supe-
rior or deluxe room or a suite. Most of these are on the top floors of the 
two- to three-story villas, with spectacular treetop views out over the 
forest and onto the Pacific.
This place is unique in that it’s equally suited to families traveling with 
children and to couples looking for a romantic getaway. There are two 
pools, including one with a long and winding waterslide for kids and 
another reserved for adults. If they tire of swimming, kids will enjoy the 
wonderful little butterfly garden and frog farm just across the street. The 
hotel also has a full-service spa, a large modern theater featuring movies 
each night, and several dining options.

under stay free in parent’s room. Rates include breakfast. Rates lower in the off 
season. AE, MC, V.
 
 Hotel Verde Mar
$$ Manuel Antonio
This hotel is a great choice for close proximity to the national park and 
the beach. From your room, it’s just a short walk to Playa Espadilla via a 
raised wooden walkway through some scrub forest. All the rooms here 
have plenty of space; wrought-iron, queen-size beds; tile floors; a desk and 
chair; and a small porch. All but two of the rooms come with basic kitch-
enettes. Some of the larger rooms even have two queen-size beds. The 
hotel has no restaurant, but plenty are within walking distance. You’ll 
even find a small pool here, for when the surf is too rough.

 Makanda-by-the-Sea
$$$$–$$$$$ Manuel Antonio
Makanda-by-the-Sea is an artfully luxurious collection of studio apart-
ments and private villas. The villas are spread out over several thickly 
forested hillsides. Each is individually decorated with flair and a sense of 
style. If you combine villa no. 1 with the three studios, you get one very 
large four-bedroom villa, great for a family or a small group — although 
children under 16 are not allowed, unless you rent out the entire hotel. 
Every studio and villa comes with a full kitchenette, cable television, CD/
MP3 player, and either a terrace or a balcony. The grounds are well 
tended, intermixed with tropical flowers and Japanese gardens. A full 
breakfast is delivered to your room each morning. The hotel’s pool and 
Jacuzzi combine intricate and colorful tile work with a view of the jungle-
covered hillsides and the Pacific Ocean.

MC, V.
 
 Villas Nicolás
$$–$$$ Manuel Antonio
These large villas offer plenty of bang for your buck. Built as terraced 
units up a steep hill in a deep forest, they really give you the feeling that 
you’re in the jungle. Most are quite spacious and well appointed, with 
wood or terra-cotta tile floors, throw rugs, and large bathrooms. Suites 
have separate living rooms and full kitchenettes, which make longer stays 
comfortable. Still, my favorite feature here is the balconies, which come 
with sitting chairs and a hammock. Some of these balconies are massive 
and have incredible views. In fact, the rooms highest up the hill have 
views that are worth even more money. Only some of the units have air-
conditioning, but those without air-conditioning do come with fans. 
During the high season, the hotel opens a restaurant/bar near the pool 
that serves breakfast and sometimes lunch and dinner, depending on 
demand.

Dining Locally
Manuel Antonio has the best restaurant scene to be found in Costa Rica 
outside of San José. Many of the hotel restaurants are quite good, with 
excellent views. Several restaurants stand out, and you’ll find them 
listed in this section.

 Chapter 15: Enjoying Magnificent Manuel Antonio 193
 
 I’ve got two words for you: Eat fish. Quepos is a port town with a local 
fishing fleet, as well as numerous sportfishing boats. The local restau-
rants are awash in fresh-caught tuna, dorado, and snapper.
Agua Azul
$$–$$$ Manuel Antonio SEAFOOD/INTERNATIONAL
With a fabulous perch and panoramic view, this open-air restaurant is my 
top choice for sunsets, and a good place to come for great food and views 
any ole time. Tables by the railing fill up fast, so get here well before 
sunset if you want to snag one. Start things off with a Tuna Margarita, an 
inventive version of ceviche with a lime-and-tequila marinade. Main dishes 
include coconut-crusted mahimahi and Panko-crusted tuna. For lunch 
there are giant burgers and fresh fish sandwiches. The long wooden bar 
is a popular hangout, and a good place to order up some appetizers and 
drinks.
See map p. 189. Manuel Antonio, near Villas del Parque. % 2777-5082. Reservations 
not accepted. Main courses: $9–$18. V. Open: Thurs–Tues 11 a.m.–10 p.m.
El Avion
$$–$$$ Manuel Antonio SEAFOOD/INTERNATIONAL
Set on the edge of Manuel Antonio’s hillside, with a great view of the ocean 
and surrounding forests, this restaurant is housed under some permanent 
tents and the right wing of a retired army transport plane — hence, the 
name El Avion, which means “The Plane.” This plane was shot down by 
the Sandinistas during the Contra War in neighboring Nicaragua. Today 
you can enjoy seafood and steaks as you take in the unique surroundings 
and glow of history. Fresh tuna steaks are flash-grilled and served with a 
teriyaki or fresh fruit sauce. Inside the fuselage (the old body of the plane), 
you’ll find a small bar.
See map p. 189. Manuel Antonio. % 2777-3378. Reservations recommended. Main 
courses: $8.50–$35. MC, V. Open: Daily noon to 10 p.m.
El Gran Escape
$$ Quepos SEAFOOD
The fish here is fresh and expertly prepared, and the prices are reason-
able. If that’s not enough of a recommendation, the atmosphere is lively, 
the locals seem to keep coming back, and the service is darn good for a 
beach town in Costa Rica. Sturdy wooden tables and chairs fill up the large 
indoor dining room, and sportfishing photos and an exotic collection of 
masks fill up the walls. If you venture away from the fish, you can sample 
hearty steaks, giant burgers, and a wide assortment of delicious appetiz-
ers, including fresh tuna sashimi. El Gran Escape’s Fish Head Bar is usually 
crowded and spirited, and if there’s a game going on, it’ll be on the televi-
sion here.

 El Patio Bistro Latino
$$$ Quepos NUEVO LATINO/FUSION
This little restaurant is an outgrowth of the popular coffeehouse and 
roasting company Café Milagro. By day, you can get a wide range of coffee 
drinks and specialties, as well as simple breakfasts, fresh baked sweets, 
and a variety of salads, sandwiches, and light lunch dishes. By night, 
which is when this place really shines, you’ll find a small and regularly 
changing menu of inventive main dishes that take advantage of local ingre-
dients and culinary traditions. So your fresh mahimahi may come steamed 
in a banana leaf with a spicy mojo (parsley and onion garnish), and your

This new restaurant features elegant Asian-influenced décor. At night, the 
ample, open-air dining room is candlelit and romantic. Start things off with 
the Asian-spice-glazed baby-back ribs or some seared fresh yellowfin tuna. 
Or, save the seared tuna for your main course, where it comes encrusted 
in peppercorns and served with a green papaya salad. For a sample of 
local flavors, order up the grilled shrimp served on sugar-cane skewers, 
with a glaze made from local rum, tamarind, and coconut. For dessert, try 
the Mango Foster or a hot chocolate soufflé. These folks have an excellent 
and very fairly priced wine list.

La Hacienda
$$$ Manuel Antonio INTERNATIONAL
Located on a jungle-facing, open-air back patio of the small Plaza Yara 
shopping center, this place is surprisingly intimate and atmospheric, 
especially at night. Subdued lighting and vines draping down from the 
high ceiling almost make you feel as if you’re in the jungle. The menu is 
inventive and eclectic. I recommend starting things off with the quesadilla 
of caramelized onions, brie, and fresh mango. For a main dish, the mixed 
seafood grill for two features shrimp, squid, and fresh fish prepared on a 
wood-fired grill with a tropical fruit salsa on the side. The dessert menu

tion, as well as a flavored crème brûlée.

This open-air restaurant is about three stories up from its parking lot, so

features an enticing mix of international dishes, with an emphasis on 
Asian fare. The chef uses locally and organically grown herbs and veggies. 
Thai, Indian, and Indonesian dishes are all excellently prepared, and vege-
tarian options are also offered, as well as nightly specials.

well-prepared and very reasonably priced. In the evenings, they open the 
second-floor balcony, which is a great spot with a good view of the ocean.

If you want one of the most romantic dining experiences to be had in 
Manuel Antonio, dine here — you’ll eat by candlelight, under a purple

best in town as well. The menu changes regularly but always features a 
selection of prime meats, poultry, and fresh fish, excellently prepared. 
The rack of lamb may get a light jalapeño-mint or tamarind glaze, and the 
chicken breast may be stuffed with feta cheese, Kalamata olives, and 
roasted red peppers, and topped with a blackberry sauce. Nightly specials 
and a good selection of salads, appetizers, and desserts round out the 
menu.

Exploring Manuel Antonio
Manuel Antonio offers up a wealth of activities and attractions. You can 
spend time here doing everything from lazing on the beach or beside a 
pool, to hiking a rain-forest trail, to trying a zip-line tour through the 
jungle canopy. If you want to head out or into the sea, you can surf, go 
scuba-diving, try your hand at sportfishing, or take a sunset cruise.
If you visit the park early in the morning, you can leave when the crowds 
begin to show up at midday. In the afternoon, you can lounge by your 
pool or on your patio. If you stay at a hotel partway up the hill from the 
park entrance, you’ll have relatively easy access to the beach, you may 
get a view, and, best of all, you’ll be out of earshot of the nearby 
nightclub.
 
 If you steer clear of the peak months in Manuel Antonio (Dec–Mar), you’ll 
miss most of the crowds. If you must come during the peak months, try to 
avoid the weekends, when the beaches inside and outside the park are 
packed with families from San José.
Fincas Naturales (The Nature Farm Reserve)
This interesting and educational attraction is just across from (and run 
by) Hotel Sí Como No (see listing earlier in this chapter). A lovely bi-level 
butterfly garden is the centerpiece attraction here, but other attractions 
include amphibian ponds, reptile exhibits, and a private reserve with a 
small network of well-groomed trails through the forest. 
See map p. 189. Located across from the Hotel Sí Como No, on the road between 
Quepos and Manuel Antonio. % 2777-1043. www.butterflygardens.co.cr. 
Admission: $15 for a 1-hour guided tour of the butterfly garden, $35 when combined 
with a 1-hour guided hike through the forest, $35 for a 2-hour night tour. Open: Daily 
8 a.m.–4 p.m., with the night tour leaving every evening at 5:30 p.m.
Taking a coffee break
Although the area around Quepos and Manuel Antonio is not well-known as a coffee 
growing region, you can still get excellent fresh-roasted coffee here from the folks at 
Café Milagro (% 2777-0794). These folks have two storefront locations: one in down-
town Quepos, just over the bridge, and another about midway along the Manuel Antonio 
road. Excellent fresh-roasted coffee drinks, baked goods, fruit drinks, and ice cream 
treats are the main draws here, but you can also get full breakfasts, as well as hearty 
sandwiches and good fresh salads. My favorite option is the selection of iced coffee 
drinks. Both shops sell fresh-roasted beans to take home with you and also feature 
well-stocked gift shops.

Manuel Antonio National Park
Manuel Antonio is a small park with only three major trails. Most visitors 
come primarily to lie on one of the beaches and check out the white-faced 
monkeys, which sometimes seem as common as tourists.
Playa Espadilla Sur (as opposed to Playa Espadilla, which is just outside 
the park) is the first beach within the actual park boundaries. It’s usually 
the least crowded beach in the park and one of the best places to find a 
quiet shade tree to plant yourself under. However, if there’s any surf, this 
is also the roughest beach in the park.
 
 If you want to explore further, you can walk along Playa Espadilla Sur or 
follow a trail through the forest parallel to Playa Manuel Antonio, which 
is the most popular beach inside the park. This beach is a short, deep 
crescent of white sand backed by lush rain forest. The water here is some-
times clear enough to offer good snorkeling along the rocks at either end, 
and it’s usually fairly calm. At low tide, Playa Manuel Antonio shows a very

interesting relic: a circular stone turtle trap left by its pre-Columbian 
residents.
 
 From Playa Manuel Antonio, another slightly longer trail leads to Puerto 
Escondido, where you’ll spot a blowhole that sends up plumes of spray at 
high tide. Be careful when hiking beyond Puerto Escondido: What seems 
like easy beach hiking at low tide becomes treacherous to impassable at 
high tide.
From either Playa Espadilla Sur or Playa Manuel Antonio, you can take a 
circular hike around a high promontory bluff. The farthest point on this 
hike, which takes about 25 minutes round-trip, is Punta Catedral, where 
the view is spectacular. The trail is a little steep in places, but anybody in 
average shape can do it. I’ve done it in sturdy sandals, but you may want 
to wear good hiking shoes. This is a good place to spot monkeys, although 
you’re more likely to see a white-faced monkey than a rare squirrel monkey.
Another good place to see monkeys is the trail inland from Playa Manuel 
Antonio. This is a linear trail and mostly uphill, but not too taxing. It’s 
great to spend hours exploring the steamy jungle and then take a refresh-
ing dip in the ocean.
 
 A guide is not essential here, but unless you’re experienced in rain-forest 
hiking, you’ll see and learn a lot more with one. A two- or three-hour 
guided hike should cost $25 to $45 per person. Almost any of the hotels in 
town can help you set up a tour of the park. Bird-watchers might want to 
book a tour with Ave Natura (% 2777-0973), a local tour agency that 
specializes in birding.
The principal park entrance is at Playa Espadilla, the beach at the end of 
the road from Quepos. To reach the park station, you must cross a small 
stream that’s little more than ankle-deep at low tide but that can be knee- 
or even waist-deep at high tide. It’s even reputed to be home to a croco-
dile or two. For years there has been talk of building a bridge over this 
stream; in the meantime, you’ll have to either wade it or pay a boatman a 
small voluntary tip for the very quick crossing. Just over the stream and 
over a small rise, you’ll find a small ranger station.
Another ranger station is located inland at the end of the side road that 
leads off perpendicular to Playa Espadilla just beyond Marlin Restaurant. 
MINAE, the national ministry that oversees the park has been frustratingly 
inconsistent about which entrance visitors must use. At this writing, tick-
ets are only being sold at the inland entrance. The trail from here begins 
with about 20 to 30 minutes of hiking along an often muddy access road 
before you get to the beach and principal park trails. If this is still the situ-
ation when you visit, I recommend buying your ticket here, and then head-
ing back to the principal beach entrance to begin your exploration of the 
park. The Parks Service allows only 600 visitors to enter each day, which 
could mean that you won’t get in if you arrive in midafternoon during the 
high season.
See map p. 189. 5km (3 miles) south of Quepos, 181km (112 miles) southwest of San 
José. % 2777-5155. Admission: $10. Open: Tues–Sun 8 a.m.–4 p.m.

 Chapter 15: Enjoying Magnificent Manuel Antonio 199
Enjoying the beaches outside the park
Playa Espadilla, the gray-sand beach just outside the Manuel Antonio 
National Park boundary, is a wonderful place to enjoy sun, sand, sea, 
and local scenery. Because no entrance fee is charged, this is the area’s 
most popular beach with locals and visiting Ticos.
This beach is often perfect for board-surfing and bodysurfing, but at 
times it can be a bit rough for casual swimming. It’s actually a better 
spot to learn how to surf. Several open-air shops rent surfboards and 
boogie boards along the road fronting this beach. Rates run between 
$5 and $10 per hour and around $20 to $40 per day. If you want a lesson, 
check in with the Manuel Antonio Surf School (% 2777-4842; www.
masurfschool.com).
Some shops by the water also rent beach chairs and beach umbrellas, 
neither of which is available inside the park. A full-day rental of a beach 
umbrella and two chaise lounges costs around $10.
 
 As you walk north along the beach, away from the national park entrance, 
and beyond a rock outcropping, you’ll come to a section of the beach that 
is “clothing optional” and very popular with the local and visiting gay and 
lesbian population.
Getting muddy on an all-terrain vehicle
If you want to try riding a four-wheel-drive all-terrain vehicle (ATV), 
check in with the folks at Fourtrax Adventure (% 2777-1829; www.
fourtraxadventure.com). Their principal tour is a three-hour adven-
ture through African palm plantations, rural towns, and secondary forest 
to a jungle waterfall, where you stop for a dip. You cross several rivers 
and a long suspension bridge. Breakfast or lunch is served, depending 
on the timing. Cost is $95 per ATV. A second rider on the same ATV 
costs $30.
Getting up close and personal with a mangrove
One of my favorite tours in the area is a mangrove tour of the Damas 
Island estuary. These trips generally include lunch, a stop on Damas 
Island, and roughly three to four hours of cruising the waterways. 
You’re certain to see loads of wildlife on the tour. Contact Iguana Tours 
(% 2777-1262; www.iguanatours.com) to set up this tour. The cost 
is $75.
Landing a big one
 
 Quepos is one of Costa Rica’s billfish centers, and sailfish, marlin, and 
tuna are all common in this town’s waters. In the past year or so, fresh- 
and brackish-water fishing in the area’s mangroves and estuaries has 
also become popular.

Part V: Manuel Antonio and Environs 
200
If you’re into sportfishing, try hooking up with Blue Fin Sportfishing 
(% 2777-0000; www.bluefinsportfishing.com), Blue Water 
(% 800-807-1585 in the U.S. and Canada, 2777-4841 in Costa Rica; 
www.sportfishingincostarica.com), or High Tec Sportfishing 
(% 2777-3465; www.hightecsportfishing.com).
A full day of fishing should cost between $400 and $1,800, depending on 
the size of the boat, distance traveled, tackle provided, and amenities. 
You’ll find a lot of competition here, so it pays to shop around and 
investigate.
 
 If you catch some fresh tuna or dorado, many restaurants in the area, 
including El Gran Escape (see listing earlier in this chapter), will cook 
your fresh catch for you.
Playing Tarzan
Tarzan never had it so good. Canopy tours involve putting on a climbing 
harness and a pulley system that lets you ride along a series of zip lines 
connecting treetop platforms. Sometimes the trip involves a rappel 
down from the forest heights, while other times the trip ends with the 
final platform at ground level. Either way, thrills are guaranteed.
The most adventurous canopy tours in the area are offered by Canopy 
Safari (% 2777-0100; www.canopysafari.com). The Titi Canopy Tour 
(% 2777-3130; www.titicanopytours.com) is a mellower setup, 
better suited to first-timer or timid adventurers. A canopy tour should 
run you between $50 and $70 per person.
About 20 minutes outside of Quepos is Rainmaker Nature Refuge 
(% 2777-3565; www.rainmakercostarica.org). The main attraction 
here is a system of connected suspension bridges strung through the 
forest canopy, crisscrossing a deep ravine. There are six bridges; the 
longest is 90m (295 ft.) across. There’s also a small network of trails and 
some great swimming holes. A half-day tour, including a light breakfast, 
full lunch, round-trip transportation from Quepos, and a guide, costs $65 
per person. Tours leave every morning, and most hotels in the area can 
book them for you.
Going local
For a taste of rural Tico culture, mixed in with some fabulous scenery and 
adventure, sign up for the Santa Juana Mountain Tour (% 2777-0850). 
This full-day tour takes you to a local farming village about an hour out-
side of Quepos. Depending upon your needs and interests, you can tour 
coffee and citrus farms, take part in carbon-offset tree planting, hike the 
trails, swim in rain-forest pools, fish for Tilapia, see how sugar cane is 
processed, and/or ride horseback. A typical Tico lunch is included.

 Chapter 15: Enjoying Magnificent Manuel Antonio 201
Playing tropical cowboy
Although you can still sometimes find locals renting horses on the 
beaches outside the national park, I discourage this, as there are just too 
many crowds, the beach is too short, and the droppings are a problem. 
Better yet, head on horseback into the hills and forests.
Both Finca Valmy (% 2779-1118; www.valmytours.com) and Brisas 
del Nara (% 2779-1235; www.horsebacktour.com) offer horseback 
excursions that pass through primary and secondary forest and feature 
a swimming stop or two at a jungle waterfall. Full-day tours, including 
breakfast and lunch, cost between $70 and $90 per person. Finca Valmy 
also offers an overnight tour for serious riders, with accommodations in 
rustic but cozy cabins in the Santa Maria de Dota mountains.
Riding the back roads on a mountain bike
If you want to do some mountain-biking while you’re here, check in with 
Estrella Tour (%/fax 2777-1286), in downtown Quepos. Well-maintained 
bikes rent for around $5 to $30 per day. You can also do a number of dif-
ferent guided tours according to skill level for $50 to $120 per day, as 
well as multiday expeditions.
Riding the wild white water of a jungle river
The Savegre and Naranjo rivers start in the rain-forested mountains 
above Quepos. They provide class II through IV white-water river rafting 
adventures, depending upon which section you run, and how much it’s 
been raining of late.
Several rafting companies ply both these rivers. Among them, Iguana 
Tours (% 2777-1262; www.iguanatours.com) and Rios Tropicales 
(% 2777-4092; www.aventurash2o.com) are the best. Both offer full-
day rafting trips for around $85 to $110. Large multi-person rafts are 
used during the rainy season, and single-person duckies (inflatable 
kayaks) are broken out when the water levels drop. Both of these com-
panies also offer half-day rafting adventures and sea-kayaking trips.
 
 Depending on rainfall and demand, they run either the Naranjo or 
Savegre rivers. I very much prefer the Savegre River for its stunning 
scenery.
Setting out to sea
Among the many boating options available around Quepos and Manuel 
Antonio are excursions in search of dolphins and sunset cruises. The 
choice of vessels range from large charter sailboats to comfortable 
motorized cruisers to jet skis.

Part V: Manuel Antonio and Environs 
202
In addition to Iguana Tours (see the preceding section), Planet Dolphin 
(% 2777-1647; www.planetdolphin.com) offers a range of boat out-
ings on a range of vessels for $50 to $80 per person, depending upon the 
size of the group and the length of the cruise. Most of the tours include a 
snorkel break and, if you’re lucky, dolphin sightings.
If you want to add some exhilaration to your sea venture, Jungle Coast 
Jets (% 2777-1706; www.junglecoastjets.com) offers two-hour jet-
ski tours for $105 per person. This tour plies the same waters and 
includes some snorkeling and the possibility of a dolphin encounter.
Snorkeling and scuba-diving
Oceans Unlimited (% 2777-3171; www.oceansunlimitedcr.com) 
offers scuba-diving and snorkel outings, as well as certification and 
resort courses. Because of river runoff and often less-than-stellar 
visibility close to Quepos, the best trips involve some travel time. 
However, Isla del Caño is only about a 90-minute ride (each way) in 
a fast boat. This is one of the best dive sites in Costa Rica, and I highly 
recommend it.
Taking a break to rejuvenate body and soul
Quite a few massage therapists and a couple of excellent day spas can 
be found around Manuel Antonio. The best of these are Raindrop Spa 
(% 2777-2880; www.raindropspa.com), Spa Uno (% 2777-2607; www.
spauno.com), and Serenity Spa at the Hotel Sí Como No. A wide range 
of treatments, wraps, and facials are available at all of these places.
Sivana Yoga (% 2777-5268; www.sivanayoga.com) has open classes 
($12) Monday through Friday at 8 a.m. above the Anaconda restaurant, 
across from the Hotel Costa Verde. Private classes are also offered.
Shopping for Local Treasures
If you’re looking for souvenirs, you’ll find plenty of beach towels, beach-
wear, and handmade jewelry in a variety of small shops in Quepos and 
Learning Spanish: A school with a view
Escuela D’Amore (%/fax 2777-1143; www.escueladamore.com) runs language-
immersion programs out of a former hotel with a fabulous view, on the road to Manuel 
Antonio. A two-week conversational Spanish course, including a home stay and two 
meals daily, costs $995.

 Chapter 15: Enjoying Magnificent Manuel Antonio 203
at impromptu stalls down near the national park. For a good selection of 
all the above, and more, try La Buena Nota (% 2777-1002), which is on 
the road to Manuel Antonio, fairly close to the national park entrance. 
This shop is jam-packed with all sorts of beachwear, souvenirs, used 
books, and U.S. magazines and newspapers.
For higher-end gifts, check out Hotel Sí Como No’s Regálame (www.
regalameart.com) gift shop, which has a wide variety of craft works, 
clothing and original paintings and prints. Look for handmade batik and 
tie-dyed clothing at Guacamole (% 2777-2071), in the small Plaza Yara 
shopping center.
Living It Up After Dark
Bars and clubs are almost as common in Manuel Antonio as capuchin 
monkeys. Night owls and dancing fools have a lot to choose from.
The bars at the Barba Roja (% 2777-0331) restaurant and the Hotel Sí 
Como No (see earlier in this chapter) are good places to hang out and 
meet people in the evenings. For shooting pool, I head to the Billfish 
Sportbar & Grill (% 2777-0411) at the Byblos Resort.
For tapas and local bocas, try Salsipuedes (% 2777-5019), which trans-
lates as “get out if you can.”
If you want live music, Bambu Jam (% 2777-3369), located along the 
road between Quepos and the park entrance, and Dos Locos (% 2777-
1526), in the heart of downtown, are your best bets.
Back in Quepos, Los Pescadores (% 2777-4130), Sargento Garcia’s (% 
2777-2960), Wacky Wanda’s (% 2777-2245), and the Fish Head Bar at 
El Gran Escape (see listing earlier in this chapter) are the most popular 
hangouts.
For real late-night dance action, the local favorite remains the Arco Iris 
(no phone), which is located just before the bridge heading into town. 
Admission is usually around $3.
If you enjoy the gaming tables, the Hotel Kamuk (% 2777-0811) in 
Quepos and the Hotel El Byblos (% 2777-0411) on the road to Manuel 
Antonio both have small casinos and will even foot your cab bill if you 
try your luck and lay down your money.
If you want to see a flick, check out what’s playing at Hotel Sí Como No’s 
little theater, although you have to eat at the restaurant or spend a mini-
mum at the bar to earn admission.

Central Pacific Coast
In This Chapter
▶ Getting to and deciding where to settle on the central Pacific coast
▶ Seeing scarlet macaws in Carara National Park
▶ Dining in style on the central Pacific coast
▶ Heading south to Dominical and the beaches south of Dominical
▶ Exploring isolated beaches south of Dominical
C
osta Rica’s central Pacific coast is home to some of the closest 
beaches to San José. In addition to Manuel Antonio (see Chapter 15), 
this coast boasts the popular fun-in-the-sun Jacó and the surfer stalwart 
Playa Hermosa. These two beach destinations are often busy and bus-
tling with Tico weekenders and itinerant surfers, while the rest of the 
destinations covered in this chapter are rather underdeveloped and 
uncrowded.
For luxury, you could head to the exclusive resort beach of Playa 
Herradura, which features a large golf and beach resort and full-service 
marina. In the hills above Playa Herradura sits Villa Caletas, one of the 
finest and most luxurious boutique hotels in the country.
If you’re looking to get away from it all without spending too much, 
Dominical and the beaches south of Dominical should be your top 
choice on this coast. The rain-forested hills and mountains that back 
these beaches are stunningly beautiful.
This coast is also home to Carara National Park, one of the last places 
in Costa Rica where you can see the disappearing dry forest join the 
damp, humid forests that extend south down the coast. This park is a 
prime nesting spot for the endangered scarlet macaw.
The climate here is considerably more humid than that farther north, 
but it’s not nearly as steamy as it is along the Southern Pacific or 
Caribbean coasts. This area stays lush and green year-round, even 
during the dry season.

Jacó and Playa Herradura
For all intents and purposes, these beaches are the two closest to San 
José. Playa de Jacó is also the closest thing in Costa Rica to Fort 
Lauderdale during spring break — although Tamarindo is making a 
strong play to share this dubious distinction.
This long stretch of beach is filled with a dense hodgepodge of hotels in 
all price categories, cheap souvenir shops, seafood restaurants, and 
pizza joints. The main strip here, which runs parallel to the shoreline, is 
a congested collection of restaurants, shops, and small strip malls, 
where pedestrians, bicycles, scooters, cars, and ATVs vie for right of 
way both day and night.
The number-one attraction in Jacó is the surf, and this is definitely a 
surfer-dominated beach town. In fact, the beach here is not particularly 
appealing. It’s made of dark-gray sand with lots of rocks, and it’s often 
very rough. Still, young surfers, Tico weekenders, and a regular stream 
of snowbirds keep this town pretty full during the northern winter 
months.
Just north of Jacó lies the crescent-shaped beach of Playa Herradura. 
Like Jacó, the dark-brown-sand beach here is fairly unattractive, 
although it is calm and protected. South of Jacó lie several other mostly 
undiscovered and undeveloped beaches, including Playa Esterillos and 
Playa Bejuco.
Jacó and Playa Herradura can be visited from San José as a day trip. 
However, you’re probably best off dedicating about one or two nights to 
take full advantage of this area.
Getting there
The best way to get to Jacó and Playa Herradura is to drive. If you don’t 
want to rent a car, frequent bus and minivan services are available. I list 
the specifics of each in the following sections.
By car
Several routes run to Jacó and Playa Herradura from San José.
The traditional and most popular route is the narrow and winding two-
lane road, the “old highway,” over and through mountains. This road is 
equal parts scenic and harrowing — it’s not uncommon to encounter 
buses and trucks passing on blind curves, or to find yourself at the back 
of a long line of cars stuck behind a slow-moving truck, crawling up one 
of the steep hills.
Begin this route by taking the Interamerican Highway west out of San 
José and exiting just west of Alajuela near the town of Atenas. Follow any 
of the numerous signs to any hotel in Jacó or Manuel Antonio. The old 

 Chapter 16: Living the Lush Life on the Central Pacific Coast 207
highway meets the Costanera (Coastal) Highway a few kilometers west 
of Orotina. From here it’s a straight and flat shot down the coast. You’ll 
hit Playa Herradura first, and then Jacó.
However, this route may soon be obsolete. Thirty years in the planning, 
and almost endlessly delayed, a new highway is being built connecting 
San Jose with Orotina, via the western suburbs of Santa Ana and Ciudad 
Colón. When completed, this new toll highway is expected to reduce the 
drive time to Jacó and the rest of the central Pacific coast substantially. 
The highway is slated to open in late 2009, but given its history, I 
wouldn’t be surprised if it’s somewhat delayed.
Finally, if you’re coming from anywhere in northern Costa Rica, you’ll 
need to take the Interamerican Highway and get off at the Puntarenas 
exit and follow signs to Caldera. From here, head south on the Costanera 
Highway.

By bus
Transportes Jacó express buses (% 2223-1109 in San José, 2643-3135 in 
Jacó) leave San José daily every two hours between 6 a.m. and 7 p.m. 
from the Coca-Cola bus terminal at Calle 16 between avenidas 1 and 3. 
The trip takes between two and a half and three hours; the fare is $3.25. 
Return buses run on roughly the same schedule. On weekends and holi-
days, extra buses are often added, so calling to check is a good idea.
No direct bus runs to Playa Herradura. The Jacó bus will drop you off at 
the crossroads. From here, it’s about 2km (11⁄4 miles) to the beach.
Gray Line (% 2220-2126; www.graylinecostarica.com) has two 
buses that leave San José for Jacó daily at 7:30 a.m. and 4 p.m. Interbus 
(% 2283-5573; www.interbusonline.com) also has two buses that 
leave San José for Jacó daily at 8:15 a.m. and 2:30 p.m. Both companies 
charge $27 and will pick you up at most San José–area hotels. Both also 
have outgoing transportation with connections to most major tourist 
destinations in the country.
Buses from San José to Quepos and Manuel Antonio also pass by Jacó. 
(They let passengers off on the highway about 1km/1⁄2 mile from town). 
However, during the busy months, some of these buses will refuse pas-
sengers getting off in Jacó or will accept them only if they pay the full 
fare to Quepos or Manuel Antonio.
Jaws of death: Looking for killer crocs
The Costanera Highway passes over the Tárcoles River, just outside the entrance to 
Carara National Park, about 23km (14 miles) south of Orotina. The river below this 
bridge is home to a hearty population of American crocodiles. This spot is a popular one 
for pulling over and gandering at these gargantuan reptiles. Some can reach up to 4.5m 
(15 ft.) in length. Anywhere from 10 to 20 are easily visible, either swimming in the water 
or sunning on the banks.
You’ll have to be careful on two counts. First, you’ll be walking on a narrow sidewalk 
along the side of the bridge with cars and trucks speeding by. And, second, car break-
ins are common here, although an on-site police post has somewhat reduced the risk. 
Still, don’t leave your car or valuables unguarded for long; better yet, leave someone at 
the car and take turns watching the crocs.
When you’re in Jacó or any of the other nearby beach towns, you’ll find several opera-
tors who run daily crocodile tours on the Tárcoles River. These tours are simple ones, 
in open skiffs or Boston Whalers. Most of these companies bring along plenty of freshly 
killed chicken to attract the reptiles and pump up the adrenaline. Don’t expect a highly 
trained naturalist guide or any semblance of respect for the natural world. Do expect to 
pay $35 to $55 per person for the trip.

 Chapter 16: Living the Lush Life on the Central Pacific Coast 209
The Jacó bus station is at the north end of town, at a small mall across 
from the Jacó Fiesta Hotel. Buses returning to San José from Quepos 
pass periodically and pick up passengers on the highway. Because 
schedules can change, asking at your hotel about current departure 
times is wise.
Orienting yourself in and around 
Jacó and Playa Herradura
Both of these beaches are located about 1km (1⁄2 mile) off the Costanera 
Highway. Aside from the large Los Sueños Marriott resort, marina, and 
condominium project, which dominates the northern section of the 
beach here, very little has been developed in Playa Herradura.
Playa de Jacó is much more developed. Still, just one main road runs 
parallel to the beach, with a host of arteries heading toward and away

from the water. You’ll find most of the hotels, restaurants, and shops on 
or just off the main road.
Villa Caletas is located down a private road off the Costanera Highway, 
on the hillsides above Playa Herradura.
Jacó doesn’t have an official tourist information office, although several 
tour-booking agencies masquerade as such. Most hotels have a knowl-
edgeable front-desk staff, concierge, or in-house tour desk that can 
answer any questions. Also, keep an eye out for Jaco’s Guide (www.
jacoguide.com), a free, glossy, monthly, local tourist magazine packed 
with information, articles, and advertisements; it’s available at most sou-
venir shops, restaurants, and hotel lobbies around town.
Getting around
Almost everything is within walking distance in Jacó, but you can rent a 
bicycle or scooter from several shops on the main street. A bike rental 
should run you around $8 to $15 per day, and a scooter should cost $30 
to $55 per day.
Taxis are plentiful and inexpensive in this area. If you can’t flag one down 
on the street, have your hotel call for you, or dial Asotaxi (% 2643-2020 
or 2643-1919).
For longer excursions, you can rent a car from Alamo (% 2643-2881), 
Budget (% 2643-2265), Economy (% 2643-1098), National (% 2643-
1752), Payless (% 2643-3224), or Zuma (% 2643-3207). Expect to 
pay approximately $45 to $90 for a one-day rental. You might also con-
sider talking to a local taxi driver, who’d probably take you wherever 
you want to go for about the same price, saving you some hassle and 
headache.
Spending the night
Arenal Pacífico
$$–$$$$ Jacó
This hotel is a good midrange option, and it’s right on the beach to boot. 
The rooms are nothing special — and few offer an ocean view — but they 
are clean and cool, and most are pretty spacious. The grounds are lush by 
Jacó standards — you have to cross a shady bridge over a little stream to 
get from the parking lot and reception to the rooms and restaurant. I like 
the second-floor rooms, which have private balconies. The superior 
rooms are larger, and come with coffeemakers and minifridges. There are 
two outdoor pools — one with a little waterfall filling it, another with a 
round children’s pool. The open-air restaurant serves standard Tico and 
international fare. Free Wi-Fi is provided throughout the hotel.

 Club del Mar Condominiums & Resort
$$$–$$$$$ Jacó
This has long been my favorite hotel right in Jacó. Club del Mar is at the 
far southern end of the beach, where the rocky hills meet the sand. Most 
of the rooms are actually one- or two-bedroom condo units, with full kitch-
ens. All are spacious and feature private balconies or porches. You’ll find 
eight rooms on the second floor of the large main building, as well as two 
huge and luxurious penthouse suites up on the third floor. All units come 
with an ocean view, although some are more open and expansive than 
others. The grounds are lush and chock-full of flowering heliconia and 
ginger. A midsize, multiuse pool and a good open-air restaurant, as well as 
some modest spa facilities, are also available. Over the years, this place 
has prided itself on being a family resort. The full kitchens in the condo 
units just make it all that much better in this regard. The free Wi-Fi reaches 
every corner of the resort. I’ve even checked my e-mail while sitting in the 
sand here.

Hotel Fuego del Sol
$$–$$$ Playa Hermosa
This place is located right on the beach and offers up the best rooms in 
Playa Hermosa, especially if you’re looking for a good value, as well as 
easy access to waves. Most of the rooms are housed in a long, two-story 
block set perpendicular to the beach. Each comes with a queen-size and 
a twin bed and a private balcony overlooking the free-form pool. Rooms 
closest to the water will also give you a glimpse of the sea. About half the 
rooms have televisions. The suites come with king-size beds, a separate 
sitting room, and a fully stocked kitchenette, and everything is well main-
tained. Although the food is pretty standard fare, you get a nice view of 
the beach from the restaurant here.

 Hotel Mar de Luz
$$ Jacó
This is one of Playa de Jacó’s best deals and a comfortable alternative 
to the typical string of cut-rate cabinas (cheap hotels) you’ll see all over 
this popular beach town. All the rooms are immaculate and comfortable. 
Some feature stone walls, small sitting areas, and one or two double beds 
placed on a raised sleeping nook. My only complaint is that the windows 
in some are too small and mostly sealed, so you’re forced to use the 

Part V: Manuel Antonio and Environs

air-conditioning. Plus, you’re a couple of blocks away from the beach. In 
the gardens just off the pools, a couple of grills are available for guest use. 
You’ll also find a comfortable common sitting area, with a selection of 
magazines and books in several languages, and there’s free Wi-Fi through-
out. These folks also have a sister hotel down the coast a little way at the 
remote and isolated Playa Bejuco (www.hotelplayabejuco.com).

Hotel Nine
$$$–$$$$ Jacó
This new hotel features contemporary architectural design touches that 
would be right at home on Miami’s South Beach. The look is appropriate, 
as the L-shaped, two-story building fronts the sand toward the southern 
end of Jacó beach. Inside, the rooms are decorated in a tropical style with 
wood and rattan furnishings and bold colors. The premium suites have 
two separate rooms and a small kitchenette with microwave oven. 
Laundry service, surfboards, and Wi-Fi are all complimentary. The excel-
lent restaurant here bills itself primarily as a steakhouse, but fresh fish 
and seafood options are also available.

Rates include continental breakfast. AE, DC, MC, V.
 Los Sueños Marriott Ocean & Golf Resort
$$$$–$$$$$ Playa Herradura
This is the closest large-scale resort to San José and is one of the most 
luxurious hotels in the country. The hotel is a massive, four-story, horse-
shoe-shaped building facing the beach. The entire thing is decorated in 
Spanish colonial style, with stucco walls, heavy wooden doors, and red-
clay roof tiles. The rooms are all large and tastefully done. They come with 
one king-size or two queen-size beds, a large armoire, a desk, and a sitting 
chair with an ottoman. The bathrooms are large and have plenty of coun-
ter space. Every room has a balcony, but all are not created equal. Most 
have only Juliet-style balconies. Those facing the ocean are clearly supe-
rior, and a few of the ocean-facing rooms even have large, comfortable 
balconies with chaise longues and tables and chairs.
The pool is a vast, intricate maze built to imitate the canals of Venice, with 
private nooks and grottos. Kids love exploring it. The beach here is calm 
and good for swimming, although it’s one of the least attractive beaches 
on this coast, with a mix of rocks and hard-packed, dark-brown sand. The 
Ted Robinson–designed 18-hole golf course winds through some of the 
neighboring forest and is an excellent, if not particularly challenging, 
resort course. The resort’s Stellaris casino is the largest and swankiest to 
be found at any beach resort in Costa Rica.

Pochote Grande
$$ Jacó
This well-kept hotel is located just off the beach toward the far north end 
of Jacó. All the rooms are quite large, although sparsely furnished, and 
they have white-tile floors, one queen-size and one single bed, a small 
fridge, and a balcony or patio. I prefer the second-floor rooms, which are 
blessed with high ceilings. The modest restaurant and snack bar serve a 
mixture of Tico, German, and American meals. (The owners are German 
by way of Africa.). The grounds here were once shady and lush, but 
encroaching construction all around has left this place feeling a bit 
exposed, and ongoing construction can be a nuisance and source of noise.

 Villa Caletas
$$$–$$$$$ Above Playa Herradura
Villa Caletas offers up opulent and luxurious rooms and villas with com-
manding views of the Pacific over forested hillsides. The entire complex 
is set on the summit and slopes of a steep hilltop. The standard rooms are 
all elegantly appointed and spacious, but you’ll definitely want to stay in 
a villa or suite here. Each individual villa is situated on a patch of hillside 
facing the sea or forests. Inside, you’ll find a main bedroom with a queen-
size bed and a comfortable sitting room with couches that convert into 
two single beds. The villas feature white-tile floors, modern bathrooms, 
and a private terrace for soaking up the views. The junior suites are even 
larger and come with their own outdoor Jacuzzis. The suites and master 
suites are larger still — they even come with their own private swimming 
pools. Some of the villas and suites are located a vigorous hike downhill 
from the main hotel building and restaurants.
Although most guests are happy to lounge around and swim in the free-
form infinity pool that seems to blend into the sea below and beyond, Villa 
Caletas offers hourly shuttle service to its own little private beach, as well 
as a host of tour options. You’ll also find a Greek-style amphitheater that 
hosts nightly sunset gatherings, as well as periodic concerts of jazz or 
classical music.
Zephyr Palace is a seven-suite addition, with its own pool, located a little 
bit below the main hotel and villas. The rooms here are immense and 
thematically designed — there’s an African suite, an Arabian suite, an 

Part V: Manuel Antonio and Environs 
214
Oriental suite, and so on. The Imperial suite has its own gym and sauna. 
All have beautiful ocean views, home theater systems, Jacuzzis, and pri-
vate balconies.

Villa Lapas
$$ Tarcoles
Villa Lapas is a good choice if you’re looking to combine a bit of ecoadven-
ture and bird-watching with some beach time. The rooms here are spa-
cious, with two double beds; cool, red-clay tile floors; air-conditioning; 
ceiling fans; free Wi-Fi; and a shady veranda with wooden benches for 
taking in the scenery. The hotel’s best feature is its massive open-air res-
taurant and deck overlooking the river, where buffet-style meals are 
served. Villa Lapas has 217 hectares (536 acres) of land with excellent 
trails, a series of suspended bridges crossing the river, and its own canopy 
tour. Across the river, you’ll find a small re-creation of a typical Costa 
Rican rural village of times gone by. This attraction features three massive 
gift shops, a large open-air restaurant, an atmospheric old-style Costa 
Rican bar, and a small chapel. Located on a lush piece of property along 
the Río Tarcolitos and bordering Carara National Park, the hotel is about 
15 to 20 minutes north of Jacó. You’ll see the signs for Villa Lapas on the 
left, just after passing Carara National Park.

Xandari by the Pacific
$$$–$$$$ Playa Esterillos Centro
If you’re looking for a large private villa done in a stunning and contempo-
rary style on a nearly private stretch of beach, this is the place for you. A 
sister to the upscale boutique hotel Xandari (see p. 107) in Alajuela, this 
small beachfront resort is very similar in terms of design, style, and aes-
thetics. All the accommodations here are large private villas, with high 
curved ceilings and loads of artistic touches. Most feature open, mosaic 
tile showers that let out onto lush gardens. The Maxima villas here are the 
top option and come with their own private plunge pool. Most of the villas 
are beachfront, but those that aren’t have large gardens and a wonderful 
sense of seclusion and romance. In order to encourage the enjoyment of 
the villas, beach, and surrounding nature, there are no televisions in the 
rooms, although you can enjoy free Wi-Fi throughout the grounds. The 
open-air seafront restaurant serves excellent international fare, with 
an equal emphasis on healthy, fresh ingredients and creative cooking 

 Chapter 16: Living the Lush Life on the Central Pacific Coast 215

wonderful spa in Alajuela.

Dining locally
 
 Caliche’s Wishbone
$–$$$ Jacó SEAFOOD/MEXICAN
This casual spot is a bit of an anomaly. It’s popular with surfers who come 
here to carb-load on Tex-Mex standards and homemade pizzas as well as 
hearty stuffed potatoes and a variety of sandwiches served in homemade 
pita bread. However, they also serve excellent fresh fish and perfectly 
prepared seafood dishes, which will please even the most discerning of 
palates. No matter what you order, the portions are huge. Caliche’s almost 
always has delicious fresh tuna lightly seared and served with a soy-was-
abi dressing. The best tables are street-side on a covered veranda. Inside, 
you’ll find more tables, as well as a bar with television sets showing surf 
videos.

El Galeón
$$$–$$$$ Playa Herradura FUSION
This is the best restaurant in a complex of restaurants found at the Los 
Sueños resort and marina. The setting is elegant; the service, refined; and 
the menu, wide-ranging, creative, and eclectic. Appetizers range from an 
inventive plate of scallop sliders, to crisp Asian-spiced soft-shell crabs and 
sea bass ceviche served with avocado and a local salsa. For a main course, 
I recommend the pumpkin, ricotta, and basil-filled ravioli served with 
grilled Creole jumbo shrimp.

This is my favorite simple beachfront fish-and-seafood joint in the area. 
Heavy wooden tables and chairs are spread around a large, open-air 
dining room facing the beach and boats bobbing at anchor off of Playa 
Herradura. The menu features a range of ceviche, salad, and main courses,

with a heavy — and logical — emphasis on fresh seafood. The corvina al 
ajillo (sea bass in garlic sauce) is excellent here, as is the arroz con maris-
cos (rice with seafood). To get here, drive the Playa Herradura road until 
you hit the beach, and then turn left on the narrow, sandy access road.

Lemon Zest
$$$–$$$$ Jacó SEAFOOD/FUSION
Culinary institute graduate and former Cordon Blu instructor, chef Richard 
Lemon has set up shop in a second-floor space right along Jacó’s main 
strip. The décor is elegant, with subdued lighting and white cloth-covered 
tables. I recommend starting things off with the lobster and manchego 
quesadilla, or the Korean BBQ satay skewers served with a homemade 
banana ketchup. Seafood main courses include macadamia-crusted 
mahimahi and fresh seared tuna. For a splurge, try the sesame-and-Panko-
crusted lobster with a pineapple risotto and sweet chile sauce. There are 
also daily specials, and some outrageous desserts. The wine list here is 
well-priced, with several good selections offered by the glass.

 Rioasis
$–$$ Jacó PIZZA/MEXICAN
Popular with visiting and local surfers alike, Rioasis serves hearty burri-
tos, simple pasta dishes, and a wide array of freshly baked wood-oven 
pizzas. My favorite dish is the Greek pizza, with olives, feta cheese, and 
anchovies, but the barbecue chicken pizza is also delicious. Both indoor 
and terrace seating are offered, as well as a bar area complete with pool 
table, dartboards, and a couple of TVs for sports events and surf videos. 
This place gets crowded and raucous most nights throughout the high 
season and on weekend nights year-round.

Exploring Jacó and Playa Herradura
The attractions listed in this section can easily be combined in a one-day 
trip. All the hotels in this area can arrange tours to these attractions, or 
you can book and visit them yourself with the numbers and information 
provided.

 Chapter 16: Living the Lush Life on the Central Pacific Coast 217
The top attractions
Bijagual Waterfalls
A series of spectacular stepped jungle waterfalls rests near the remote 
village of Bijagual. The highest waterfall here is 180m (590 ft.). Excellent 
swimming holes are near the bottom of this impressive waterfall.
You can choose from one of several ways to visit these falls. Various 
companies run tours from Jacó or from entrances both at the top and 
bottom of the falls. Try Gray Line Tours (% 2643-3231; www.grayline
costarica.com) or Superior Sightseeing (% 2643-0180 www.jagua
riders.com). Alternatively, you can drive yourself or take a cab (see 
“Getting around,” earlier in this chapter, for cab information).
Just above the falls, a local family runs the Complejo Ecológico La 
Catarata (no phone), which features a basic restaurant and a campground. 
They run horseback tours down to the falls for around $45. Alternatively, 
you can hike in from an entrance lower down. The hike takes about 45 
minutes each way, and the entrance is $20 per person. Either way, you’ll 
end up at the base of the tallest fall.
While you’re up this way, you can also stop in at the Pura Vida Botanical 
Gardens (% 2645-1001). Entrance to the gardens is $20. The fee includes 
free run of the gardens and trails, which lead to a couple of smaller local 
waterfalls.
See map p. 207. To get here, turn off the Costanera Highway at the signs for Hotel 
Villa Lapas. From here, it’s about 5km (3 miles) to the lower entrance and 8km (5 
miles) up to the top entrance to the falls. Open: Daily 8 a.m.–4 p.m.
Carara National Park
A little more than 15km (91⁄3 miles) north of Jacó is Carara National Park, a 
world-renowned nesting ground for scarlet macaws. It has a few kilome-
ters of trails open to visitors. A loop trail here takes about an hour, and 
another trail is only open to tour groups. The forests here are lush transi-
tional forests, loaded with wildlife.
The macaws migrate daily, spending their days in the park and their 
nights among the coastal mangroves. It’s best to view them in the early 
morning, when they arrive, or around sunset, when they head back to the 
coast for the evening; a good guide can usually find them for you during 
the day. Regardless of whether you see them, you should hear their loud 
squawks. Among the other wildlife that you might see here are caimans, 
coatimundis, armadillos, pacas, peccaries, river otters, kinkajous, and, of 
course, hundreds of species of birds.
 
 Be sure to bring along insect repellent, or, better yet, wear lightweight 
cotton long sleeves and pants. (I was once foolish enough to attempt a 
quick hike in beach clothes and flip-flops — not a good idea.)

Part V: Manuel Antonio and Environs 
218
You can hike the trails of Carara independently, but my advice is to take 
the guided tour; you’ll learn a lot more about your surroundings. Several 
companies offer tours to Carara National Park for around $30 to $50. 
Check at your hotel.
If you’re looking for a more personalized tour, check out Gray Line Tours 
(% 2643-3231; www.graylinecostarica.com) or Superior Sightseeing 
(% 2643-0180 www.jaguariders.com).

(91⁄3 miles) north of Jacó. % 2637-1054. Admission: $10. Open: Daily 7 a.m.–4 p.m.
More cool things to see and do
Although this area has few major attractions, there’s plenty to keep you 
busy. Your choices run from just hanging out on the beach, to taking a 
zip-line canopy tour, to trying your hand at some deep-sea sportfishing.
Enjoying the beaches in and around Jacó and Playa Herradura
All these beaches are easily reached by car, moped, or bicycle — if you 
have a lot of energy. Road signs are located at the entrance/access roads 
to each of the beaches, so you’ll have no trouble finding them.
 
✓ Playa de Jacó: Unfortunately, Playa de Jacó has a reputation for 
dangerous riptides — as do most of the beaches along Costa Rica’s 
Pacific coast. Even strong swimmers have been known to have 
trouble with the power rips here. In general, the far southern end of 
the beach is the calmest and safest.
 
 The same waves that often make Playa de Jacó dangerous for swim-
mers make it one of the most popular beaches in the country with 
surfers. Those who want to challenge the waves can rent boogie 
boards and surfboards for around $3 to $5 an hour or $10 to $15 
per day from any one of the numerous surf shops along the main 
road. If you want to learn how to surf, check in with Johnny at 
Superior Sightseeing (% 2643-0180; www.jaguariders.com), 
or ask for him at Club del Mar.
Watching the sun set
Perched on a high hillside overlooking the Pacific Ocean, Villa Caletas (see listing ear-
lier in this chapter) is a perfect place to enjoy sunsets. What’s more, the Greek-style 
amphitheater here is set facing the nightly solar sayonara. Even if you’re not staying 
here, you can come for a cocktail and watch the sun sink into the sea.
However, the word has gotten out, and during the high season, hoards of other tourists 
come here for the same pleasure. When it’s crowded, getting a good seat can be dif-
ficult and service can be a little slow.

 Chapter 16: Living the Lush Life on the Central Pacific Coast 219
 
✓ Playa Herradura: If you’re looking for a calmer beach, head to 
Playa Herradura. This is a hard-packed, brown-sand-and-rock beach 
ringed by lush hillsides. Despite the presence of the Los Sueños 
Marriott resort complex, Playa Herradura still feels a lot more iso-
lated and deserted than Jacó.
 
 
✓ Playa Hermosa: Experienced surfers will want to head to Playa 
Hermosa, 10km (61⁄4 miles) southeast of Jacó. This long, black-sand 
beach has the most consistent surf along this coast. From July 
through December, sea turtles nest along Playa Hermosa most 
nights.
 
✓ Playa Esterillos: For a sense of solitude, check out Playa Esterillos, 
22km (14 miles) southeast of Jacó. This beach is long and wide and 
almost always nearly deserted.
Heading to sea in search of a trophy catch
If you’re interested in doing some sportfishing, I recommend that you 
head on over to the 250-slip marina next to the Los Sueños Marriott (see 
listing earlier in this chapter). Dependable operators that have already 
set up here include Maverick Sportfishing Yachts (% 866-888-6426 in 
the U.S., 2637-8824 in Costa Rica; www.maverickyachtscostarica.
com), Costa Rica Dreams (% 732-901-8625 in the U.S. and Canada, 2637-
8942 in Costa Rica; www.costaricadreams.com), and Cuervo Sport 
Fishing (% 800-656-1859 in the U.S. and Canada; www.costarica-
fishingcharters.com). A half-day fishing trip for four people costs 
around $850 to $1,200; a full day is between $1,000 and $1,800.
Paddling around
Kayak Jacó (% 2643-1233; www.kayakjaco.com) runs a couple of 
different trips. Tours range from gentle paddles and floats on the Tulin 
River to a combination ocean-kayaking and snorkel trip on Herradura 
Bay, to full-on kayak surfing at one of the local beach breaks. You can 
also do some moderate white-water kayaking in easy-to-use inflatable 
kayaks or try your hand in the ocean on one of the eight-person outrig-
ger canoes. Most options run around four hours and include transporta-
tion to and from the put-in, as well as fresh fruit and soft drinks during 
the trip. The tours cost between $55 and $70 per person, depending on 
the particular trip and group size.
Rough riding
Several operators take folks out on ATV tours through the surrounding 
countryside. Expect to ford rivers and ride over some rough terrain. 
Tours range in length from two to six hours and cost between $85 and 
$165 per person. Contact Four Trax Adventure (% 2643-2373; www.
fourtraxadventure.com) or Jaguar Riders (% 2643-0180l www.
jaguariders.com).

Saddling up
Horseback-riding tours give you a chance to get away from all the devel-
opment in Jacó and see a bit of nature. The best operator in the area, 
with the best horses, is Discovery Horseback (% 8838-7550, or 2637-
0808) down in Playa Hermosa.
Seeing the sights from on high
You have several ways to enter the forest canopy in this area.
 
✓ The gentlest approach is to take the Rain Forest Aerial Tram 
Pacific (% 2257-5961; www.rfat.com). A sister project to 
the original Rain Forest Aerial Tram, this attraction features 
modified ski-lift-type gondolas that take you through and above 
the transitional forests here bordering Carara National Park. The 
$55 entrance fee includes the guided 40-minute tram ride, as well 
as a guided 45-minute hike on a network of trails. You can also 
hike the company’s trails at your leisure for as long as you like. 
These folks also have a zip-line canopy tour on the same grounds, 
and offer guided tours, including transportation from both San 
José and any hotel in the area. The Aerial Tram is located a few 
kilometers inland from an exit just north of the first entrance 
into Jacó.
 
✓ A few zip-line and harness-style canopy tours are also available if 
you want more adventure. Chiclets Tree Tour (% 2643-1880) 
offers up a canopy adventure ($60 per person) just outside Jacó in 
nearby Playa Hermosa. This is an adventurous tour, with 13 plat-
forms set in transitional forest, and some sweeping views of the 
Pacific.
 
✓ Villa Lapas (see listing earlier in this chapter) has two different 
tours through the treetops outside of Jacó. The better option, for 
my money, is a guided hike on its network of trails and five sus-
pended bridges ($20 per person). The operator also has a relatively 
low-adrenaline zip-line canopy tour ($35 per person), with seven 
platforms connected by six cables.
Pampering yourself
Serenity Spa (% 2643-1624; www.serenityspacr.net) offers massage, as well 
as mud packs, face and body treatments, and manicures and pedicures. The spa’s Jacó 
branch is located on the first floor, among a tiny little cul-de-sac of shops next to Zuma 
Rent-A-Car. These folks also have operations at the Los Sueños Marriott, Villa Caletas, 
and Club del Mar Condominiums & Resort.

 Chapter 16: Living the Lush Life on the Central Pacific Coast 221
Hitting the links
There’s the excellent La Laguna 18-hole golf course at the Los Sueños 
Marriott Ocean & Golf Resort (% 2630-9000; www.golflaiguana.
com). The course is open to all, whether guests of the hotel or not. 
Greens fees are $160 for a full round; the price drops to $130 if you tee 
off after noon. Club and shoe rentals are available. Marriott guests pay 
slightly less to play here.
Shopping for local treasures
If you try to do any shopping in this area, you’ll be overrun with shops 
selling T-shirts, cut-rate souvenirs, and handmade jewelry and trinkets. 
The two notable exceptions are Guacamole (% 2643-1120), a small 
clothing store that produces its own line of batik beachwear, and La 
Galería Heliconia (% 2643-3613), a high-end gift shop that carries a 
good selection of artworks and pottery. Both of these shops are located 
on the main road in Jacó.
Living it up after dark in Jacó and Playa Herradura
Playa de Jacó is the central Pacific’s party town, with tons of bars and 
several discos. The Disco La Central (% 2643-3076), just off the beach 
near the south end of town, is packed every night of the high season and 
every weekend during the off season. A huge open-air hall features the 
requisite 1970s flashing lights and suspended mirrored ball, as well as a 
garden bar in a thatch-roofed building that’s a slightly quieter place to 
have a drink.
For a more refined dance scene, try Congas (% 2643-1200), which often 
has live salsa bands and is located toward the south end of town. Both 
discos charge a nominal cover fee.
For a more casual atmosphere, head to Los Amigos (% 2643-2961) or 
Tabacón (% 2643-3097). Both are located right on the main drag in 
town.
My favorite bar in town is the new beachfront Ganesha Lounge (% 2643-
3916), which has a laid-back Ibiza-like club vibe, while the similarly new 
Le Loft (% 2643-5846) aims to attract a more sophisticated and chic 
clubbing crowd.
Sports freaks can catch the latest games at Hotel Copacabana (% 2643-
1005), Hotel Poseidon (% 2643-1642), or Clarita’s Beach Bar & Grill 
(% 2643-2615).
The Jazz Casino (% 2643-2316), located at the Hotel Amapola, is a 
modest casino. If you’re into gaming, you should head to the Stelaris 
Casino (% 2630-9000) at the Los Sueños Marriott.

 Chapter 16: Living the Lush Life on the Central Pacific Coast 223
Dominical and the Beaches 
South of Dominical
Dominical and the coastline just south of it are lush and wild. This is an 
excellent area to find isolated beaches, spectacular views, remote jungle 
waterfalls, and a wide range of lodgings.
The beach at Dominical itself has consistent right and left beach breaks, 
which means plenty of surfers are usually in town. In fact, even though 
the beach at Dominical does get broad, flat, and beautiful at low tide, it’s 
primarily appealing to surfers and is often too rough for casual bathers. 
However, you’ll find excellent beaches for swimming, sunbathing, and 
strolling just a little farther south.
From Dominical south, the coastline is dotted with tide pools, tiny 
coves, cliff-side vistas, and some of Costa Rica’s most unexplored 
beaches. Among the beaches you’ll find are Playa Ballena, Playa Uvita, 
Playa Piñuela, Playa Ventanas, and Playa Tortuga.
Getting there
Whether you’re coming from San José, or from Quepos and Manuel 
Antonio, driving is your best option for reaching this area because bus 
service is infrequent. However, if you want or need to travel by bus, you 
can get more information in the following sections.
By car
From San José, head south, toward Cartago, on the Interamerican 
Highway. Continue on this road all the way to San Isidro de El General, 
where you’ll see an exit for Dominical.
 
 The long and winding stretch of the Interamerican Highway between San 
José and San Isidro is one of the most difficult sections of road in the 
country. Not only are the usual car-eating potholes and periodic land-
slides present, but you must also contend with driving over the 3,300m 
(10,824-ft.) Cerro de la Muerte (Mountain of Death). This aptly named 
mountain pass is legendary for its dense afternoon fogs, blinding torren-
tial downpours, steep drop-offs, severe switchbacks, and unexpectedly 
breathtaking views. Drive with extreme care, and bring a sweater or 
sweatshirt — it’s cold up at the top.
 
 Pay attention as you approach San Isidro. The exit for Dominical is 
marked, but it’s a simple right-hand turn onto a busy city street that 
passes through the center of San Isidro. After passing through the city, 
continue on this same street until it turns into the winding two-lane road 
to Dominical and the coast. The entire drive takes about four hours.

Part V: Manuel Antonio and Environs 
224
You can also drive here from Manuel Antonio and Quepos. Just take 
the road out of Quepos toward the hospital and airport. Follow the 
signs for Dominical. It’s a straight, albeit bumpy, shot. However, the 
road has been slated to be paved for a few years now, and if that hap-
pens, it should no longer take more than an hour to cover the mere 
40km (25 miles).
By bus
To reach Dominical by bus, you must first head to San Isidro de El 
General or Quepos. Plenty of daily buses will take you to San Isidro. 
Musoc (% 2222-2422 in San José, 2771-3829 in San Isidro) buses leave 
from their modern terminal at Calle Central and Avenida 22 roughly 
hourly between 5:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. Tracopa (% 2221-4214 or 
2771-0468) also runs express buses between San José and San Isidro 
that leave roughly every hour between 5 a.m. and 6 p.m. from Calle 5 
between avenidas 18 and 20. Whichever company you choose, the trip 
takes a little over three hours, and the fare is roughly $4.40.
From San Isidro de El General, Transportes Blanco buses (% 2771-4744) 
leave for Dominical at 7 a.m., 9 a.m., 1:30 p.m., and 4 p.m. The bus sta-
tion for Dominical is 1 block south of the main bus station and 2 blocks 
west of the church. The trip takes one and a half hours and the fare is 
$1.50.
Buses (% 2771-4744) leave Quepos for Dominical daily at 5 a.m., 6:30 
a.m., 9:30 a.m., 11:30 a.m., 3:30 p.m., and 5:30 p.m. The trip takes two 
hours, and the fare is $3.
When you’re ready to leave, buses depart Dominical for San Isidro at 
6:30 a.m., 7:15 a.m., 2:30 p.m., and 3:30 p.m. Buses leave San Isidro for 
San José roughly every hour between 5 a.m. and 6 p.m. Still, if you want 
to get to San José the same day, you should catch the morning bus. 
Buses to Quepos leave Dominical at approximately 5 a.m., 8 a.m., 11:30 
a.m., 1:30 p.m., and 5:30 p.m.
Orienting yourself in and around Dominical
Dominical is a small town on the banks of Río Barú. The dirt road into 
and through town is to the right after you cross the bridge. It runs paral-
lel to and a bit inland from the beach. As you first come into town, you’ll 
see a fútbol (soccer) field and the San Clemente Bar & Grill, which has a 
couple of public telephones. As you continue on the dirt road, you’ll 
come to a small side street that cuts through and joins the beachfront 
access road.
On the Costanera Highway heading south, just beyond the turnoff into 
Dominical is a little strip mall, Plaza Pacífica, with a couple of restau-
rants, gift shops, and the town’s main grocery store.
Heading south from Dominical, the Costanera Highway is paved and in 
beautiful shape all the way to Ojochal and beyond.

 Chapter 16: Living the Lush Life on the Central Pacific Coast 225
You won’t find any official tourist information offices in this area. 
However, most hotels have a helpful and knowledgeable front-desk staff 
or in-house tour desk. The tour office at San Clemente Bar & Grill (see 
“Dining locally,” later in this chapter) is also a good bet.
Getting around
Taxis congregate around the fútbol field in the center of Dominical. If 
you can’t flag one down, or have your hotel call one for you, try Nelson 
(% 8835-9528) or Erik (% 8881-4220). The actual town/village of 
Dominical is very compact and can easily be navigated on foot. If you’re 
heading farther afield, taxis are the best option. Bus service (to the 
beaches south, to Quepos, and to San Isidro and San José) is infrequent, 
and not really an option for getting around the area. However, you can 
rent a car from Alamo (% 2787-0052), which has a desk inside the Villas 
Rio Mar resort.
Spending the night
 
 Cabinas San Clemente
$ Dominical
In addition to running the town’s most popular restaurant and serving 
as the social hub for the surfers, beach bums, and expatriates passing 
through, this place offers basic, but clean, budget rooms just steps from 
the beach. Some of the newer second-floor rooms have wood floors and 
wraparound verandas and are a real steal in this price range. The grounds 
are shady, and you can relax in one of several hammocks strung between 
coconut palms. The least expensive rooms are housed in a bunk-bed, 
hostel-style affair in a separate building dubbed the Dominical 
Backpacker’s Hostel. All rooms here come with access to a communal 
kitchen.

This is the most luxurious hotel you’ll find along this stretch of coast. The 
name translates roughly as “The Angel’s Cradle.” All the rooms are named 
after angels, and angel motifs are abundant, as are stained-glass windows 
and lampshades, carved wood details, tile mosaics, and other artistic 
touches. The hotel is a bit set in, away from the ocean, but there are pretty 
good sea views from many rooms and common areas, over the thick forest 
and gardens here. Rooms come with an open front patio fronting the pool 
or a private balcony. I prefer the second-floor rooms with the balconies. 
Free Wi-Fi access covers the entire hotel, and a wide range of treatments 
are available at the pretty little spa here.

Hotel Roca Verde
$–$$ Dominical
If you want to be right on the beach, this popular hotel offers the best 
accommodations to be found in Dominical. The setting is superb — on a 
protected little cove with rocks and tide pools. The rooms are located in 
a two-story building beside the swimming pool. Each room comes with 
one queen-size and one single bed and a small patio or balcony. The large 
open-air restaurant boasts a popular bar that keeps folks dancing most 
weekend nights. The rooms are a bit close to the bar, so getting an early 
night’s sleep can sometimes be hard, especially on Saturday nights during 
the high season.

La Cusinga Lodge
$$$ Bahía Ballena
This should be a top choice for bird-watchers and those looking for a 
comfortable room that also feels entirely in touch with the natural sur-
roundings. The individual and duplex cabins here all feature lots of var-
nished woodwork and large screened windows on all sides for cross 
ventilation. Most have interesting stone and tile work in their bathrooms. 
The whole small complex is set on a hill overlooking Ballena National Park 
and Playa Uvita. Heavy stone paths connect the main lodge to the various 
individual cabins. With high ceilings, lots of light through large picture 
windows, and sparkling varnished wood floors and walls, the two dorm 
rooms here may just be the nicest dorm rooms I’ve ever seen.

 Pacific Edge
$ Dominical
This place isn’t that close to the beach, but the views from each individual 
bungalow are so breathtaking that you may not mind. Spread along a 
lushly planted ridge on the hillside over Dominical, these comfortable 
cabins have wood floors, solar-heated water, and solar reading lights. 
Their best feature is surely the private porch with a comfortable ham-
mock in which to laze about and enjoy the view. A wide range of tours and 
activities can be arranged here, and a refreshing swimming pool awaits 
you if you’re too tired or lazy to head down to the beach. Pacific Edge is

Dining locally
Coconut Spice
$$ Dominical THAI/INDIAN
Housed in a small shopping complex near the river mouth, this place 
serves up tasty and reasonably authentic Thai and Indian cuisine. The 
lemon-grass soups and pad Thai are both excellent. Chicken, pork and 
shrimp are all served up in a selection of red, green, yellow, and Panang 
curry sauces. The open-air dining room has wood floors and paneling, 
heavy wooden tables and chairs, and a smattering of Asian decorations.

Exotica
$$–$$$ Ojochal FRENCH
This little place is tucked away deep along the dirt road that runs through 
Ojochal. With polished concrete floors, roll-up bamboo screens for walls, 
and only a few tree-trunk slab tables and plastic lawn chairs for furniture, 
it is, nonetheless, one of the most popular restaurants in the area. The 
chalkboard menu changes regularly but may feature shrimp in a coconut 
curry sauce or duck breast à l’orange. The Chicken Exotica is chicken 
stuffed with bacon, prunes, and cheese, topped with a red-pepper sauce. 
The lunch menu is much more reduced, with a small selection of fresh 
salads and a few more-filling mains.

Renting a luxurious hillside villa
In addition to the places listed throughout this section, you’ll find that a host of beautiful 
private homes built on the hillsides above Dominical are regularly rented out. Most 
come with several bedrooms and full kitchens, and quite a few have private pools. The 
setting and views you’ll find here are spectacular.
If you’re here for an extended stay and have a four-wheel-drive vehicle (a must for most 
of these), check in with Paradise Costa Rica (% 800-708-4552 in the U.S. and Canada;

$$–$$$ Dominical SEAFOOD/INTERNATIONAL
This open-air restaurant has a gorgeous setting on a rocky bluff overlook-
ing the ocean. Try to get one of the tables by the railing and you’ll be able 
to watch the waves crashing on the rocks below. The menu features fresh 
seafood, meat, and poultry dishes, as well as a selection of pastas. The 
sauces and presentation are all interesting. Start things off with a tuna 
tartar tower, and then try either their fresh mahimahi with a mango relish 
or the filet mignon in a porcini mushroom sauce.

The social center of Dominical, this place specializes in massive break-
fasts, an extensive menu of hefty sandwiches and tasty Mexican-American 
food, and nightly specials. The fresh fish, done blackened or simply 
grilled, is delicious. One unique (and sobering) décor touch here is the 
ceiling full of broken surfboards. If you break a board out on the waves, 
bring it in and they’ll hang it and even buy you a bucket of beer.

The top attractions
Ballena Marine National Park
Ballena Marine National Park protects a coral reef that stretches from 
Uvita south to Playa Piñuela and includes the little Isla Ballena, just off-
shore. Although the park is predominantly offshore, it does include Playa 
Uvita, an expansive and beautiful beach. Playa Uvita is well protected and 
good for swimming. At low tide, an exposed sandbar allows you to walk 
about and explore another tiny island.
This park is named for the whales that are sometimes sighted close to 
shore in the winter months. If you ever fly over this area, you’ll also notice 
that this little island and the spit of land that’s formed at low tide compose 
the perfect outline of a whale’s tail.

 Chapter 16: Living the Lush Life on the Central Pacific Coast 229
You’ll find a park’s office at the entrance. These folks administer the park 
and even run a small turtle-hatching shelter and program. Camping is 
allowed here for around $2 per person per day, with access to a public 
bathroom and shower.
Located about 16km (10 miles) south of Dominical, the main entrance to the National 
Park is at Playa Uvita. To get here, drive south on the Costanera Highway until 
the village of Bahía. Turn right here and drive another 3km (13⁄4 miles) east along 
a rough dirt road until you hit the beach. % 2743-8236. Admission: $10. Open: Daily 
8 a.m.–4 p.m.
Hacienda Barú
Hacienda Barú is a private wildlife refuge and tourism project located just 
north of Dominical, on the other side of the Barú River. These folks offer 
a variety of hikes and tours, including a walk through mangroves and 
along the riverbank (for some good bird-watching), a rain-forest hike 
through virgin jungle, an all-day trek from beach to mangrove to jungle 
that includes a visit to some Indian petroglyphs, an overnight camping 
trip, and a combination horseback-and-hiking tour.
They even have tree-climbing tours and a small canopy platform 30m (98 
ft.) above the ground. If you’re traveling with a group, you’ll be charged a 
lower per-person rate, depending on the number of people in your group.
Hacienda Barú also has six comfortable cabins with two bedrooms each, 
full kitchens, and even a living room ($60 double, including breakfast).
Hacienda Barú is located 1.5km (1 mile) north of Dominical on the road to Quepos 
and Manuel Antonio. % 2787-0003. Fax: 2787-0057. www.haciendabaru.com. 
Tour prices range from $20 for the mangrove hike to $60 for the jungle overnight.
Nauyaca Waterfall
The Nauyaca waterfall is a two-tiered jungle waterfall with an excellent 
swimming hole. This waterfall is also called Santo Cristo, and sometimes 
even Don Lulo’s waterfall. The latter name belongs to a local man who 
pioneered and continues to lead many of the tours here. Most include a 
mix of hiking, horseback-riding, and hanging out at the falls.
All the hotels in town can arrange a visit to Nauyaca Waterfall, or you can 
call Don Lulo himself at % 2787-8013. A full-day tour, with both breakfast 
and lunch, and transportation to and from Dominical costs around $50 per 
person. This site has become so popular that Don Lulo has set up a little 
welcome center at the entrance (just off the road into Dominical from San 
Isidro) and even allows camping here. Round-trip car transportation can 
be arranged for a nominal charge.
The main entrance to these falls is located 10km (61⁄4 miles) outside of Dominical, on 
the road to San Isidro. % 2787-8013. www.cataratasnauyaca.com. Admission:

place features over 50 terrariums and open-air exhibits of snakes, frogs, 
turtles, and lizards, as well as crocodiles and caimans. Be sure to check 
out the brilliantly colored mottled eyelash viper. These folks even have a 
Komodo dragon. Although I’m generally disappointed in this type of 
attraction, the display enclosures here are the best I’ve seen in Costa Rica.

More cool things to see and do
The Dominical area offers visitors a host of adventurous and educational 
options:
 
✓ Diving: If you want to take a scuba-diving trip out to the rocky sites 
off of Ballena National Park, or all the way out to Caño Island, call 
Mystic Dive Center (% 2786-5217; www.mysticdivecenter.
com), which has its main office in a small roadside strip mall down 
toward Playa Tortuga and Ojochal.
 
✓ Flying: If you’re looking for a bird’s-eye view of the area, Skyline 
Ultralights (% 2743-8037; www.flyultralight.com) offers a 
variety of airborne tours. Located near the beach in Uvita, these 
folks offer options ranging from a 20-minute introductory flight for 
$65 to a circuit exploring the Ballena Marine National Park and 
neighboring mangrove forests lasting a bit over an hour for $160.
 
✓ Learning Spanish: If you’re looking to learn or bone up on your 
Spanish, Adventure Education Center (% 2787-0023; www.
adventurespanishschool.com) is located right in the heart of 
Dominical and offers a variety of immersion-style language programs.
Getting wet in Dominical and the 
beaches south of Dominical
Dominical is a major surf destination, and the long and varied beach 
break here is justifiably popular. In general, the beach boasts powerful 
waves best suited to experienced surfers. However, when the waves 
aren’t too big, this is a good place to learn how to surf. Beginners should 
check in at the Green Iguana Surf Camp (% 2787-0157 or 8825-1381; 
www.greeniguanasurfcamp.com), which offers hourly lessons and 
comprehensive surf camps.
Because the beach in Dominical itself is unprotected, it’s often too rough 
for swimming; however, you can go for a swim in the calm waters at the 
mouth of the Río Barú, or head down the beach a few kilometers to the 
little sheltered cove at Roca Verde.
If you have a car, you should continue driving south, exploring beaches 
as you go. You’ll first come to Dominicalito, a small beach and cove that 

 Chapter 16: Living the Lush Life on the Central Pacific Coast 231
shelters the local fishing fleet and can be a decent place to swim. But I 
recommend you continue on a bit. You’ll soon hit Playa Hermosa, a long 
stretch of desolate beach with fine sand. As in Dominical, this is unpro-
tected and can be rough, but it’s a nicer place to sunbathe and swim 
than Dominical.
Among the beaches you’ll find farther south are Playa Ballena, Playa 
Uvita, Playa Piñuela, Playa Ventanas, and Playa Tortuga. Of these, 
Playa Ballena and Playa Uvita (see “The top attractions” earlier in this 
section) are the best for swimming. Playa Piñuela is made up predomi-
nantly of large, smooth stones, especially near the high-tide line. All 
these beaches have an isolated and undiscovered feel to them.
 
 Several of the beaches mentioned here are considered part of Bahía 
Marine National Park and charge an entrance fee of $10 per person. If 
you’re visiting several of these beaches in one day, save your ticket, it’s 
good at all of them.
Shopping for local treasures
Aside from your standard souvenir shops, no notable shopping options 
stand out in this area.
Living it up after dark in Dominical
Nightlife options are extremely limited in Dominical and virtually non-
existent south of Dominical. However, the young surfers who fill up this 
beach town do like to party, so the available bars are put to good use.
The big party scenes shift from night to night. Maracutú hosts an open 
jam session every Tuesday and a reggae night every Thursday. The 
loud and late-night dancing scene usually takes place Fridays at San 
Clemente Bar & Grill (% 2787-0055) and Saturdays at Roca Verde. In 
addition, Thrusters (% 2787-0127) is a popular surfer bar with pool 
tables and dartboards. The bar at ConFusione (% 2787-0244) also 
sometimes has live music.
If you want to hang within earshot of the waves, Tortilla Flats (% 2787-
0168) is your best shot.

Part VI
Monteverde and

In this part . . .
M
uch of Costa Rica’s natural beauty can be found inland, 
especially in the northern zone. You’ll fi nd everything 
from active volcanoes and mystical cloud forests to large 
inland lakes and pristine rivers and jungle waterfalls here. 
This is also the place to come for high-octane adventure, 
including mountain biking, canyoning, and riding zip-line 
canopy tours.
Monteverde, and the cloud forests around it, boast a distinct 
and unique beauty. The misty cloud forests here are home to 
the Resplendent Quetzal, one of the most stunning and 
revered birds of Mesoamerica. And Arenal volcano is one of 
Costa Rica’s most mesmerizing sights. This active volcano 
regularly spews molten lava from its perfectly conical crater. 
At the foot of the volcano sit several natural hot springs, as 
well as Lake Arenal, a mecca for windsurfers, kiteboarders, 
and bass fi shermen alike.

I
f you’re looking for cool mountain air, a taste of rural Costa Rica, and 
the chance to visit a cloud forest, Monteverde is the place for you. 
Monteverde translates as “green mountain,” and that’s exactly what 
you’ll find at the end of the steep and winding dirt road that leads here. 
Perched on a high mountain ridge, this small, scattered village and its 
surrounding cloud forests are well known among both scientific 
researchers and ecotravelers.
Monteverde was settled in 1951 by Quakers from the United States 
who wanted to leave behind the fear of war, as well as an obligation to 
support continued militarism through paying U.S. taxes. They chose 
Costa Rica, a country that had abolished its army just a few years ear-
lier, in 1948.
Although Monteverde’s founders came here primarily to farm the land, 
they wisely recognized the need to preserve the rare cloud forests that 
covered the mountain slopes above their fields, and to that end they 
dedicated the largest adjacent tract of cloud forest as the Monteverde 
Cloud Forest Reserve.
Cloud forests are a unique phenomenon. If you think about it, the name 
says it all. Rain forests get their name from the fact that they receive 
copious amounts of rainfall, often heavy at times. Cloud forests get their 
moisture — and their moniker — from being nearly constantly envel-
oped in a combination of mist and clouds. Cloud forests are formed 
when moist, warm air sweeping in off the ocean cools as it reaches the 
cooler temperatures of higher elevation, thus forming clouds.

Part VI: Monteverde and Environs 
236
This constant level of moisture has given rise to an incredible diversity 
of innovative life-forms and a forest in which nearly every square inch of 
space has some sort of plant growth. Within the cloud forest, the 
branches of huge trees are draped with epiphytic plants: orchids, ferns, 
and bromeliads. This intense botanic competition has created an almost 
equally diverse population of insects, birds, and other wildlife.
Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve covers 10,400 hectares (25,688 acres) 
of forest, including several different life zones that are characterized by 
different types of plants and animals. Within this small area are more 
than 2,500 species of plants, including 400 types of orchids, 400 species 
of birds, and 100 species of mammals. It’s no wonder that the reserve 
has been the site of constant scientific investigations since its founding 
in 1972.
For many, the primary goal of a visit to Monteverde is a chance to 
glimpse the elusive and rare Resplendent Quetzal, a bird once revered 
by the pre-Columbian peoples of the Americas. This beautiful bird is a 
sight to see, with a bright red breast, iridescent blue-green back feath-
ers, and, in the case of the males, tail feathers that can reach some 2 feet 
in length.
Getting There
There are no airstrips in or around Monteverde, so you have to arrive by 
some sort of vehicle. Given the lay of the land here, and the fact that var-
ious attractions and activities are spread out, I recommend driving your 
own rental car. However, bus service to Monteverde is available, and 
after you’re there, taxis are available for getting around. I describe these 
various options in more detail in the following sections.
By car
Take the Interamerican Highway north toward Nicaragua. About 20km 
(12 miles) past the turnoff for Puntarenas there will be a marked turnoff 
for Sardinal, Santa Elena, and Monteverde. From this turnoff, the road is 
paved as far as the tiny town of Guacimal. From here it’s another 20km 
(12 miles) to Santa Elena. It should take you a little over two hours to 
reach the turnoff and another one and a half hours or so from there.
An alternative route is to continue on the Interamerican Highway until 
just before the Río Lagarto bridge. This turnoff isn’t always well marked. 
From the Río Lagarto turnoff, it’s 38km (24 miles) to Santa Elena and 
Monteverde.
Whichever route you take, the final going is slow because the roads into 
Santa Elena are rough, unpaved, dirt-and-gravel affairs. However, once 
you arrive, the roads in and around Santa Elena are paved, including all 
the way to Cerro Plano, and about halfway to the Cloud Forest Preserve. 

 Chapter 17: Visiting the Cloud Forests of Monteverde 237
You don’t absolutely need a four-wheel drive vehicle, but you’ll appreci-
ate the extra clearance, especially in the rainy season (mid-Apr to Nov).
 
 Just before you enter the town of Santa Elena, you’ll be stopped at a 
little tollbooth collecting 200 colones. The money is ostensibly going to 
maintain the road, which is sort of ironic. Appropriately, the payment is 
optional.
By bus
Transmonteverde express buses (% 2222-3854 in San José, 2645-5159 
in Santa Elena) leave San José daily at 6:30 a.m. and 2:30 p.m. from Calle 
12, between avenidas 7 and 9. The trip takes around four hours; the fare 
is $4.45. Buses arrive at and depart from Santa Elena; if you’re staying at 
one of the hotels or lodges closer to the reserve, you’ll want to arrange 
pickup, if possible, or you’ll have to take a taxi or local bus.
Taking a horse, boat, and taxi 
to La Fortuna, or vice versa
You can travel between Monteverde and La Fortuna by boat and taxi, or on a combina-
tion boat, horseback, and taxi trip. A 10- to 20-minute boat ride across Lake Arenal cuts 
an hour or more of rough driving off the route circling it. It’s about a one-and-a-half-
hour, four-wheel-drive, taxi ride between Santa Elena and the Río Chiquito dock on the 
shores of Lake Arenal. It’s just a 20-minute taxi ride from the dock on the other side and 
the city of La Fortuna. These trips can be arranged in either direction for $25 to $50 per 
person, all-inclusive.
You can also add on a horseback ride on the Santa Elena/Monteverde side of the lake. 
Several routes and rides are offered. This is most commonly done in the direction of La 
Fortuna to Monteverde. The steepest route heads up the mountains and through the 
forest to the town of San Gerardo, which is only a 30-minute car ride from Santa Elena. 
Other routes throw in mellower and shorter sections of horseback-riding along the 
lakeside lowlands. With the horseback ride, this trip runs around $50 to $75 per person.
The riding is sometimes rainy, muddy, and steep. Many find it much more arduous than 
awe-inspiring. Moreover, I’ve received numerous complaints about the condition of the 
trails and the treatment of the horses, so be very careful and demanding before signing 
on for this trip. Find out what route you’ll be taking as well as the condition of the horses, 
if possible. Desafío Expeditions (% 2645-5874 in Monteverde, 2479-9464 in La Fortuna; 
www.desafiocostarica.com) is one of the more reputable operators. They’ll 
even drive your car around for you while you take the scenic (and sore) route.
If you’re looking to make the ride just by taxi and boat, check in with Jeep Boat 
Jeep (% 2479-9955), which has two daily fixed departures in each direction at 7 a.m. 
and 4 p.m.

Gray Line (% 2220-2126; www.graylinecostarica.com) has a 
daily bus that leaves San José for Monteverde at 8 a.m.; the fare is $35. 
Interbus (% 2283-5573; www.interbusonline.com) has two daily 
buses that leave San José for Monteverde at 8:15 a.m. and 2:30 p.m.; the 
fare is $39. These companies will pick you up and drop you off at most 
San José– and Monteverde-area hotels.
There is a daily bus from Tilarán (Lake Arenal) at 12:30 p.m. The trip 
duration, believe it or not, is two hours (for a 40km/25-mile trip); the fare 
is $2.30.
The express bus departs for San José daily at 6:30 a.m. and 2:30 p.m. A 
bus from Santa Elena to Puntarenas leaves daily at 6 a.m. If you’re head-
ing to Jacó, Playa Herradura, or Manuel Antonio, take the Santa Elena/
Puntarenas bus and transfer in Puntarenas for a bus down the coast to 
any of these destinations.
To reach Liberia, take any bus down the mountain and get off when you 
hit the Interamerican Highway. You can then flag down a bus bound for 
Liberia (almost any bus heading north). The Santa Elena–Tilarán bus 
leaves daily at 7 a.m.
Orienting yourself in Monteverde
As you near the top of the local mountain, you’ll approach the small vil-
lage of Santa Elena. Take the right fork in the road if you’re heading 
directly to Monteverde or the reserve.
If you continue straight, you’ll hit the center of Santa Elena, which is cen-
tered on a block-long triangle of paved streets. Here, you’ll find the bus 
stop, a health clinic, a bank, a small supermarket, a laundromat, and a 
few restaurants, hotels, souvenir shops, and tour offices.
A marked road heads out of Santa Elena toward the Monteverde Cloud 
Forest Reserve — where the road ends.
Monteverde is not a village in the traditional sense of the word. There’s 
no center of town — only dirt lanes leading off from the main road to 
various farms, hotels, and attractions. This main road has signs for all 
the hotels and restaurants mentioned here.
There are no official tourist information offices in Santa Elena or 
Monteverde, although several tour-booking agencies masquerade as 
such. Most hotels have knowledgeable front-desk staffs, concierges, or 
in-house tour desks that can answer any questions. Also, keep an eye 
out for Good Times, a free local tourist paper that’s loaded with informa-
tion, articles, and advertisements.

Getting around
There are a half-dozen or so buses daily between the town of Santa 
Elena and the Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve. The buses leave Santa 
Elena for the reserve beginning at 6 a.m. The last bus returns from the 
reserve at 4 p.m. The fare is $1.50 each way.
There’s also periodic van transportation between the town of Santa 
Elena and the Santa Elena Cloud Forest Reserve. Ask around town, and 
you should be able to find the current schedule and book a ride for 
around $2 per person.
A taxi (% 2645-6969 or 2645-6666) between Santa Elena and either the 
Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve or the Santa Elena Cloud Forest 
Reserve costs around $8 to $10 for up to four people. Count on paying 
$3 to $8 for the ride from Santa Elena to your lodge in Monteverde.
Finally, several places around town rent all-terrain vehicles (ATVs), for 
around $45 to $70 per day. Hourly rates and guided tours are also avail-
able. These vehicles are particularly well suited to the roads up here.
Spending the Night
Arco Iris Lodge
$$–$$$ Santa Elena
This is the best hotel right in Santa Elena proper. The rooms are spread 
out in eight separate buildings. In fact, most are individual cabins. All have 
wood or tile floors and plenty of wood accents. My favorites are the hon-
eymoon cabins, which have their own private balconies with a forest view 
and good bird-watching. The management here is helpful and can arrange 
a wide variety of tours. Although they don’t serve lunch or dinner, there’s 
a daily breakfast buffet, and beer, wine, soft drinks, and other refresh-
ments are available throughout the day and evening.
See map p. 239. Santa Elena. % 2645-5067. Fax: 2645-5022. www.arcoiris

Reading up on the early Quaker settlers
If you want an in-depth look into the lives and history of the local Quaker community, try 
to pick up a copy of the Monteverde Jubilee Family Album. Published in 2001 by the 
Monteverde Association of Friends, this collection of oral histories and photographs is 
260 pages of local lore and memoirs. Although it’s very simply bound and printed, it’s 
well worth the $20 price.

 Chapter 17: Visiting the Cloud Forests of Monteverde 241
Finca Valverde
$$ Just Outside Santa Elena
Although this place is located right on the outskirts of Santa Elena, it feels 
far removed from the hustle and bustle of the town. The standard rooms 
are set behind the main lodge and restaurant and are reached via a sus-
pension bridge over a small forest creek. Most have one queen-size and 
two twin beds. All share a broad common veranda and feature free Wi-Fi. 
The cabins and junior suites are larger and more private, and they feature 
bathtubs. The junior suites are the highest up the hill and also have televi-
sions, small refrigerators, and coffeemakers. The grounds are lush and 
well tended. A buffet breakfast and all other meals are served in a large 
restaurant just off the lobby.

co.cr. Rack rates: $93–$111 double. Rates lower in the off season. MC, V.
Hotel Belmar
$$ On the Road to the Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve
Set on the top of a grassy hill, the Belmar has stunning views of the Nicoya 
Gulf and the Pacific. Afternoons in the dining room or lounge are idyllic, 
with bright sunlight streaming in through a west-facing glass wall. Sunsets 
are spectacular. Most of the guest rooms are fitted with wood paneling, 
French doors, and little balconies that open onto splendid views. There 
are actually two buildings here. My favorite rooms are in the main build-
ing; those in the separate Swiss-chalet-style building are a bit smaller. The 
restaurant serves a mix of well-prepared Tico and international cuisine. 
The Belmar is up a dirt road that passes to the left of the gas station as 
you come into the heart of Monteverde.
See map p. 239. Monteverde. % 2645-5201. Fax: 2645-5135. www.hotelbelmar.

Hotel El Establo
$$$–$$$$ On the Road to the Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve
Once a small, family-run budget lodging with rooms in a converted stable, 
this is now arguably the largest and most luxurious option in Monteverde. 
However, I think the vision here far exceeds the execution. The design and 
scale are somewhat out of place with the vibe and aesthetic of Monteverde, 
and the service and food can fall short. The rooms are housed in a series 
of large buildings set inland and up a steep hill from the main road. Most 
have great views. All are quite large and come with a private balcony or 
patio. The large and luxurious honeymoon suite has a fabulous view and 
private Jacuzzi. All rooms come with cable television, a rarity in 
Monteverde. There are two heated pools here, one under the cover of an 
open-air roof for when it’s raining. There’s also an on-site canopy tour and 
extensive spa facility here.

 Hotel El Sapo Dorado
$$ Just Outside Santa Elena
Located on a steep hill between Santa Elena and the reserve, El Sapo 
Dorado offers some of the most charming and comfortable accommoda-
tions in Monteverde. The spacious cabins are built of hardwoods both 
inside and out and are surrounded by a grassy lawn. Big windows let in 
lots of light, and high ceilings keep the rooms cool during the day. Some 
of the cabins have fireplaces, which are a welcome feature on chilly nights 
and during the peak parts of the rainy season. A remodeling in 2008 left 
most cabins updated, with larger, more modern bathrooms and livelier 
décor. My favorite rooms are the sunset suites, which have private ter-
races with views of the Nicoya Gulf and wonderful sunsets. This hotel 
offers free Wi-Fi in its restaurant, lobby, and common areas.
Not only does El Sapo Dorado own and manage the nearby Reserva 
Sendero Tranquilo (see “More cool things to see and do,” later in this 
chapter), but it also has a network of well-maintained trails into primary 
forest on-site. To find the hotel and restaurant, watch for the sign on the 
left-hand side of the main road to the reserve, a few hundred yards outside 
of the town of Santa Elena.

com. Rack rates: $122 double. MC, V. Rates include breakfast and taxes. Lower rates 
in the off season.
 
 Hotel Fonda Vela
$$ Monteverde, Close to the Reserve Entrance
This is one of the closer lodges to the Cloud Forest Reserve, an easy 
15-minute walk away. And, although it’s one of the older hotels here, 
Fonda Vela remains one of the best choices in Monteverde. Guest rooms 
are housed in a series of buildings scattered among the forests and pas-
tures of this former farm. Most have views of the Nicoya Gulf. The newer 
junior suites, some of which have excellent views, are the best rooms in 
the house, and I prefer them to the older and larger junior suites. All junior 
suites come with cable television. The dining room has great sunset views, 
and it sometimes even features live music. Throughout the hotel, you’ll 
see paintings by co-owner Paul Smith, who also handcrafts violins and 
cellos and is a musician himself.
See map p. 239. Monteverde. % 2257-1413 or 2645-5125. Fax: 2257-1416. www.fonda

 Hotel Poco a Poco
$$ Santa Elena, close to the Frog Pond of Monteverde
Located just outside of the town of Santa Elena, this hotel provides a host 
of perks and amenities at a pretty good price. Some of the rooms are on 
the small size, but the beds are firm and everything is kept neat and 

 Chapter 17: Visiting the Cloud Forests of Monteverde 243
contemporary. The best rooms are higher up, away from the road, and 
have a small balcony. All rooms come with free Wi-Fi, as well as DVD play-
ers, and the hotel maintains a movie lending library of over 4,000 titles. 
There’s a heated pool, children’s pool, and Jacuzzi on the grounds here, 
and the small restaurant is excellent.

season, higher during peak periods. MC, V.
 Monteverde Lodge
$$ Just outside Santa Elena
The Monteverde Lodge was one of the first ecolodges to open in 
Monteverde, and it remains one of the best. Guest rooms are large and 
comfortable and, thanks to regular remodeling and upkeep, are some of 
the coziest in town. Most feature angled walls of glass with chairs and a 
table placed so that avid bird-watchers can do a bit of birding without 
leaving their rooms.
The gardens and secondary forest surrounding the lodge have some 
gentle groomed trails and are also home to quite a few species of birds. 
Perhaps the lodge’s most popular attraction is the large hot tub in a big 
atrium garden just off the lobby. After hiking all day, you can soak your 
bones under the stars.
The hotel’s dining room offers great views, good food, and excellent 
formal service provided by bow-tied waiters. The adjacent bar is a popu-
lar gathering spot and is the setting for regular evening slide shows focus-
ing on the cloud forest. Scheduled bus service to and from San José is 
available, as is a shuttle to the reserve, horseback-riding, and a variety of 
optional tours. The excellent guides who work for the owner, Costa Rica 
Expeditions, have lots of experience with family groups.

Rates slightly lower in the off season. AE, MC, V.
Staying at the reserve
If you don’t mind roughing it, you can stay in a simple dormitory room right at the 
Monteverde Biological Cloud Forest Reserve (% 2645-5122; www.cct.or.cr). This 
is a good way to meet any visiting scientists and get friendly with the local guides and 
workers. A bunk bed and three meals per day here run $53 per person. For an extra 
$11 you can get a room with a private bathroom. Admission to the reserve is included 
in the price.

Dining Locally
Chimera
$$ Cerro Plano FUSION/TAPAS
Building on the success of Sophia (see listing later in this chapter), Karen 
Nielsen opened this creative and casual tapas restaurant. The small menu 
has a broad scope, with options available in the traditional categories of 
soups, salads, mains, sides, and desserts, and influences ranging from 
Asia to Latin America to the Old World. Standout dishes include slow-
cooked pork with white beans and caramelized onions and the coconut 
shrimp “lollipops” with a mango-ginger dipping sauce. And, for dessert, 
don’t pass up the chocolate mousse with a sangria syrup. A variety of 
creative and contemporary cocktails, as well as good wines, are also 
offered.
See map p. 239. Cerro Plano, on the road between Santa Elena and the reserve, on 
your right. % 2645-6081. Reservations recommended during high season. Main 
courses: Tapas $2.50–$8.50. AE, DC, DISC, MC, V. Open: Daily 11:30 a.m.– 9:30 p.m.
Flor de Vida
$$ Just outside Santa Elena INTERNATIONAL/VEGETARIAN
With large new digs, this long-standing local favorite continues to serve 
up some of the best and healthiest fare to be found in Monteverde. Large 
picture windows line the walls, and there’s a small lounge area in one 
corner, with books, magazines, and board games. When it’s cold and 
windy out, I like to start off with a bowl of their pumpkin-almond soup. For 
lunch, their veggie burger with roasted potatoes is hard to beat, and for 
dinner I tend to favor the Thai fish curry. In addition to the regular menu, 
there are always daily specials.
See map p. 239. On the road between Santa Elena and the reserve, on your right. 
% 2645-6328. www.flordevida.net. Reservations recommended during high

 Morpho’s Café
$ Downtown Santa Elena COSTA RICAN/INTERNATIONAL
Easily the most popular restaurant in the town of Santa Elena, this simple 
second-floor affair serves up hearty and economical meals. You’ll find 
soups, sandwiches, and casados (plates of the day) for lunch and dinner, 
and delicious fresh fruit juices, ice cream shakes, and home-baked des-
serts throughout the day. The tables and chairs are made from rough-
hewn lumber and whole branches and trunks, and the place brims with a 
light convivial atmosphere. This place is a very popular hangout for back-
packers and budget travelers.

Pizzería de Johnny
$$ Just outside Santa Elena ITALIAN/PIZZA
This perennially popular pizza joint has grown from a little hole in the wall 
to a downright institution here in Monteverde. The thin-crust, wood-oven 
pizzas are delicious, and there’s a large menu of meat, chicken, and pasta 
dishes as well. You can start things off with a bruschetta or mussels 
Parmesan. The signature pizza Traviesa comes with artichoke hearts, 
onions, mushrooms, garlic, and marinated tomatoes. There’s a little gift 
shop and a quiet bar off the large open dining room. The nicest tables are 
on the covered veranda out back.
See map p. 239. On the road to the reserve, on your right, just beyond El Sapo Dorado. 
% 2645-5066. Reservations recommended during high season. Main courses: $15–
$22, pizzas $8–$20. MC, V. Open: Daily 11 a.m.–9:30 p.m.
 
 Sophia
$$ Monteverde COSTA RICAN/FUSION
This restaurant is the most exciting and eclectic dining option in the 
Monteverde area. Start everything off with a mango-ginger mojito, and 
then try one of their colorful and abundant salads. Main courses range 
from seafood chimichangas to chicken breast served in a guava reduction. 
The tenderloin comes with a chipotle butter sauce over a bed of mashed 
sweet potato. Everything is very well prepared and reasonably priced. 
You’ll find two good-size dining rooms here, both with heavy wood furni-
ture. The best seats are close to the large, arched, picture windows over-
looking the neighboring forest and gardens.
See map p. 239. Cerro Plano, just past the turnoff to the Butterfly Farm, on your left. 
% 2645-7017. Reservations recommended during high season. Main courses: $12–
$16. MC, V. Open: Daily 11:30 a.m.–9:30 p.m.
Taking a coffee break
Monteverde and Santa Elena sit in the heart of some prime coffee-growing lands. The 
area boasts several local coffeehouses where you can sit and enjoy a cup of some 
locally grown and roasted beans. Moreover, the frequently wet and misty climate here 
makes this an even more attractive option.
In Santa Elena, Chunche’s (% 2645-5147) is a bookstore with a small coffee shop and 
espresso bar that also doubles as a laundromat. Along the road to the reserve, Stella’s 
Bakery (% 2645-5560) is a cheery and long-standing little joint, with a variety of fresh 
baked goods.

Part VI: Monteverde and Environs

Exploring Monteverde
Monteverde has an abundance of attractions and activities. All the 
hotels and lodges in this area offer or can book all the tours and activi-
ties listed in this section. If you have your own vehicle, you can also visit 
all these attractions on your own.
The top attractions
Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve
The Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve is one of the most developed and 
well-maintained natural attractions in Costa Rica. The trails are clearly 
marked, regularly traveled, and generally gentle in terms of ascents and 
descents.
The cloud forest here is lush and largely untouched. Still, keep in mind 
that most of the birds and mammals you’ve been reading about are rare, 
elusive, and nocturnal. Moreover, to all but the most trained of eyes, those 
thousands of exotic ferns, orchids, and bromeliads tend to blend into one 
large mass of indistinguishable green.
Perhaps the most famous resident of the cloud forests of Costa Rica is the 
Resplendent Quetzal, a robin-size bird with iridescent green wings and a 
ruby-red breast. The male Quetzal also has two long tail feathers that can 
reach nearly 0.6m (2 ft.) in length, making it one of the most spectacular 
birds on Earth. The best time to see Quetzals is early morning to midmorn-
ing, and the best months are February through April, when the birds are 
mating.
After the Quetzal, Monteverde’s most famous resident was the sapo 
dorado (golden toad), a rare native species. However, the golden toad has 
disappeared from the forest and is feared extinct. Competing theories of 
the toad’s demise include adverse effects of a natural drought cycle, the 
disappearing ozone layer, pesticides, and acid rain.
Other animals that have been seen in Monteverde, although sightings are 
extremely rare, include jaguars, ocelots, and tapirs. However, you do have 
a good chance of seeing one of several different monkey species and an 
almost innumerable number of bird species.
 
 I highly recommend taking one of the reserve’s official guided two- to 
three-hour hikes; you can see and learn far more than you could on your 
own. At $17 per person, the reserve’s tours may seem like a splurge, espe-
cially after you pay the entrance fee, but unless you have a lot of experi-
ence in Neotropical forests, it’ll be money well spent.
Before venturing off on your tour or self-guided hike, have a look around 
the information center. Several guidebooks, as well as posters and post-
cards of some of the reserve’s more famous animal inhabitants, are avail-
able here.

 Chapter 17: Visiting the Cloud Forests of Monteverde 247
Because only 120 people are allowed into the reserve at any one time, you 
may be forced to wait for a while before entering. Most hotels can reserve 
a guided walk and entrance to the reserve for the following day for you, or 
you can get tickets in advance directly at the reserve entrance.
 
 Some of the trails here can be very muddy, depending on the season, so 
ask about current conditions. If the mud is heavy, you can rent rubber 
boots at the reserve entrance for $2 per day. They may make your hike 
much more pleasant.
 
 Night tours of the reserve leave every evening at 7:15 p.m. The cost is $17 
per person, including admission to the reserve, a two-hour hike, and, most 
important, a guide with a high-powered searchlight. For an extra $2, they’ll 
throw in round-trip transportation to and from your area hotel.
See map p. 239. Located at the end of the dirt road 6km (33⁄4 miles) from Santa Elena. 
% 2645-5122. www.cct.or.cr. Admission: $17 adults, $9 students and children;

Santa Elena Cloud Forest Reserve
Although the Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve is the area’s most famous 
and popular attraction, plenty of other areas of cloud forest lie in this 
region. The Santa Elena Cloud Forest Reserve is a 360-hectare (889-acre) 
reserve located 5km (3 miles) north of the village of Santa Elena. This 
reserve has a maximum elevation of 1,680m (5,510 ft.), which makes it the 
highest cloud forest in the Monteverde area.
You’ll find 13km (8 miles) of hiking trails, as well as an information center 
here. Because it borders the Monteverde Reserve, you can find a similar 
richness of flora and fauna, although Quetzal sightings are not nearly as 
common. The $12 entry fee at this reserve goes directly to support local 
schools.
See map p. 239. Located 5km (3 miles) northeast of Santa Elena. % 2645-5390. www.
reservasantaelena.org. Admission: $12; $15 additional for a 3-hour guided 
tour. Open: 7 a.m.–4 p.m., with night tours starting at 7 p.m.
Other attractions in Monteverde
 
 The Butterfly Garden (% 2645-5512) displays many of Costa Rica’s 
most beautiful butterfly species. Besides the hundreds of preserved and 
mounted butterflies, you’ll find a garden and a greenhouse where you 
can watch live butterflies, as well as an informative guided tour that 
takes you through the life cycle of this fascinating insect. The garden is 
located near the end of the Cerro Plano road and is open daily from 9:30 
a.m. to 4 p.m. Admission is $10 for adults and $8 for students and chil-
dren, including a guided tour. The best time to visit is between 9:30 a.m. 
and 1 p.m., when the butterflies are most active.
If your taste runs toward the slithery, you can check out the Monteverde 
Serpentarium (% 2645-5238; www.snaketour.com), on the road to 
the reserve. This place features a broad selection of reptiles, including 
many species of venomous and nonvenomous snakes. It’s open daily 
from 8 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. and charges $8 for admission.
Getting the most out of 
a visit to the reserve
Because the entrance fee to the Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve is valid for a full day, 
I recommend taking an early-morning tour with a guide and then heading off on your 
own either directly after that hike or after lunch. A guide will point out and explain a 
lot, and you’re almost assured of seeing more wildlife with a guide. But there’s also 
much to be said for walking quietly through the forest on your own or in very small 
groups — you’ll be able to stray from the more popular paths in the park.

 Chapter 17: Visiting the Cloud Forests of Monteverde 249
 
 The Frog Pond of Monteverde (% 2645-6320; www.ranario.com), 
located a couple of hundred meters north of the Monteverde Lodge, is 
probably a better bet. The $10 entrance gets you a 45-minute tour, and 
your ticket is good for two days. A variety of species populate a series of 
glass terrariums. This place is open daily from 9 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. If you 
visit first during the daytime, I recommend that you stop by at least 
once after dark, when the various tree frogs are active.
Another entry in this field is the World of Insects (% 2645-6859), which 
features a couple dozen terrariums filled with some of the area’s more 
interesting creepy crawlers. My favorites are the giant horned beetles. 
This place is located 300m (984 ft.) west of the supermarket in Santa 
Elena. It’s open daily from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m.; admission is $9.
 
 If you’ve had your fill of birds, snakes, frogs, bugs, and butterflies, you 
may want to stop at the Orchid Garden (% 2645-5308; www.monte
verdeorchidgarden.com), right in downtown Santa Elena. This small 
botanical garden boasts more than 450 species of orchids. Admission is 
$10 for adults, $7 for students. It’s open daily from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.
If you’re looking to conquer your fear of bats, head to the Bat Jungle 
(% 2645-6566) for an in-depth look into the world, natural history, and 
habits of these odd, flying mammals. A visit here includes several differ-
ent types of exhibits, from skeletal remains, to large enclosures where 
you get to see various live species in action — the enclosures and rooms 
are kept dark, and the bats have had their biological clocks tricked into 
thinking it’s night. The Bat Jungle is open daily from 9:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. 
Admission is $10.
Finally, it’s also worth stopping by the Monteverde Cheese Factory 
(% 2645-5150) to savor some homemade ice cream and to pick up some 
of the best cheese in Costa Rica. From the little store here, you can 
watch the process in action. The cheese factory is located right on the 
main road about midway between Santa Elena and the Reserve. It’s open 
Monday through Saturday from 7:30 a.m. to 4 p.m., and Sunday from 7:30 
a.m. to noon. A one-hour tour is offered daily at 9 a.m. and 2 p.m. (this 
latter tour is not offered on Sunday). The tour costs $10.
Canopy tours and suspended bridges
You have several options for getting up into the cloud forest canopy. 
There are several zip-line canopy-tour and suspended-bridge options to 
choose from in this area. I list them here in my order of preference.
 
 Anybody in average physical condition can do any of the adventure 
tours in Monteverde, but they’re not for the faint of heart or acrophobic. 
Try to book directly with the companies listed here or through your 
hotel. Beware of agents working the streets of Monteverde — they make 
a small commission and frequently try to steer tourists to the operator 
paying the highest percentage.

250
One of the newer additions to the canopy-tour field is Selvatura Park 
(% 2645-5929; www.selvatura.com). The extensive canopy tour here 
features 15 cables connecting 18 platforms. The canopy tour costs $45; 
the walkways and bridges cost $25. A number of other attractions are 
also here, so various packages are available; see the “Visiting the best 
one-stop adventure and activity spot” sidebar for information.
The sister projects of Sky Walk and Sky Trek (% 2645-5238; www.
skyadventures.travel) combine a traditional canopy-tour attraction 
with a network of forest trails and suspension bridges:
 
✓ Sky Trek is one of the more extensive canopy tours in the country, 
with two very long cables to cross. The longest of these is some 
770m (2,525 ft.) long, high above the forest floor. There are no 
rappel descents here, and you brake using the pulley system for 
friction. This tour costs $50.
 
✓ Sky Walk features a loop trail through primary and secondary 
forest, with a series of bridges spanning large canyons and ravines. 
The bridges reach 39m (128 ft.) above the ground at their highest 
point. The Sky Walk is open daily from 7 a.m. to 4 p.m. Admission is 
$17, and no reservation is necessary. For an extra $13, a knowledge-
able guide will point out the diverse flora and fauna on the walk.
For $60 per person, you can do the Sky Trek canopy tour and then walk 
the trails and bridges of the Sky Walk. Reservations are recommended 
for the Sky Trek part of the excursion.
Sky Walk and Sky Trek are located about 3.5km (21⁄4 miles) outside of the 
town of Santa Elena, on the road to the Santa Elena Cloud Forest 
Reserve. These folks will provide round-trip transportation from Santa 
Elena for just $2 per person.
Visiting the best one-stop adventure 
and activity spot
Selvatura Park (% 2645-5929; www.selvatura.com) is the best one-stop shop for 
various adventures and attractions in the area. In addition to its extensive canopy tour, 
it also has a network of trails and suspended bridges, as well as a huge butterfly garden, 
hummingbird garden, and wonderful insect display and museum. Prices vary depending 
upon how much you want to see and do. Individually, the canopy tour costs $45; the 
walkways and bridges, $25; the butterfly garden, $12; and the insect museum, $12. 
Various combination packages are available. For $121, you get the run of the entire joint, 
all the tours, lunch, and round-trip transportation from your Monteverde hotel. It’s open 
daily from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m.

 Chapter 17: Visiting the Cloud Forests of Monteverde 251
One of the oldest canopy tours in the country is run by The Original 
Canopy Tour (% 2645-5243; www.canopytour.com), which has an 
office right in the center of Santa Elena. This is one of the more interest-
ing canopy tours in Costa Rica because you’ll climb up the hollowed-out 
interior of a giant strangler fig during your initial ascent. This tour also 
has 11 platforms and 2 rappels, making it the most adventurous canopy 
tour in Monteverde. The three-hour tours run three times daily and cost 
$45 for adults, $35 for students, and $25 for children 11 and under. Call 
for reservations and tour schedule.
More cool things to see and do
 
✓ Hiking: In addition to hiking in cloud forests, you can hike the 
trails and grounds of the Ecological Sanctuary (% 2645-5869; 
www.ecologicalsanctuary.com), a family-run wildlife refuge 
and private reserve located down the Cerro Plano road. This place 
has four main trails, which run through a variety of ecosystems. 
Because some of the farm is secondary forest and some is cleared 
land, the wildlife viewing is often quite good here. In fact, the wild-
life viewing is often better than that in Monteverde Cloud Forest 
Reserve and Santa Elena Cloud Forest Reserve. There are a couple 
of pretty waterfalls off the trails, and night tours are also offered. 
The Ecological Farm is open daily from 7:30 a.m. to 5 p.m.; admis-
sion is $10 for self-guided hiking on the trails; $25 during the day 
for a two-hour guided tour; and $20 for the two-hour guided night 
tour that leaves at 5:30 p.m.
 
 The Bajo del Tigre Trail (% 2645-5003; www.acmcr.org) is a 
3.5km (21⁄4-mile) trail that’s home to several different bird species 
not usually found within the reserve. You can take several different 
loops, lasting anywhere from one to several hours. The trail starts 
a little past the CASEM artisans’ shop and is open daily from 8 a.m. 
to 5 p.m. Admission is $8 for adults and $4 for students and 
children.
 
 You can also go on guided three-hour hikes at the Reserva Sendero 
Tranquilo (% 2645-7711), which has 80 hectares (198 acres) of 
land, two-thirds of which is in virgin forest. This reserve is located 
up the hill from the Monteverde Cheese Factory. It charges $35 for 
its tours and is open daily from 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. seasonally, and 
night tours are also offered with advance reservations.
 
✓ Horseback riding: The rugged dirt roads, untouched forests, and 
pasturelands surrounding the protected reserves here provide 
excellent opportunities for getting in the saddle. Meg’s Riding 
Stables (% 2645-5560), La Estrella Stables (% 2645-5075), 
Palomina Horse Tours (% 2645-5479), and Sabine’s Smiling 
Horses (% 2645-6894; www.smilinghorses.com) are the most 
established operators, offering guided rides for around $10 to 
$20 per hour.

Part VI: Monteverde and Environs 
252
 
 Another option is to set up a day tour and sauna at El Sol (% 2645-
7214; www.elsolnuestro.com). Located about a ten-minute car 
ride down the mountain from Santa Elena, these folks take you on a 
roughly three-hour ride either to San Luis or to an isolated little 
waterfall with an excellent swimming hole. After the ride back, 
you’ll find the wood-burning traditional Swedish sauna all fired up, 
with a refreshing and beautiful little pool beside it. The tour costs 
$60 per person, including lunch. These folks also have two very 
rustically luxurious private cabins ($95–$125 double), with excel-
lent views.
 
✓ Taking a coffee tour: If you’re interests focus on java, you can take 
a tour of several different local coffee farms. The Monteverde 
Coffee Tour (% 2645-5901; www.monteverde-coffee.com) is 
run by the folks at the Cooperativa Santa Elena, a local fair-trade 
coffee producer, with a shop right next to CASEM, while Don Juan 
Coffee Tour (% 2645-7100; www.donjuancoffeetour.com) is 
a local, family farm operation. Both offer several types of tours 
that provide insight into the process and production of fine, high-
altitude coffee. Depending upon the tour option you choose, rates 
run between $22 and $30.
 
✓ Learning Spanish: The Centro Panamericano de Idiomas (% 2645-
5441; www.spanishlanguageschool.com) offers immersion lan-
guage classes in a wonderful setting. A one-week program, with 
four hours of class per day and a home-stay with a Costa Rican 
family, costs $465.
Shopping for Local Treasures
Monteverde may just be one of the best tourist destinations in Costa 
Rica for shopping. Several good art galleries and gift shops are in the 
area, and even the locally produced crafts are of a higher quality than in 
most of the rest of the country.
 
 Perhaps the best-stocked gift shop in Monteverde is the Hummingbird 
Gallery (% 2645-5030). You’ll find the gallery just outside the reserve 
entrance. Hanging from trees around it are a series of hummingbird feed-
ers that attract more than seven distinct species of these hyperactive 
little birds. At any given moment, there may be several dozen humming-
birds buzzing and chattering around the building and your head. Inside 
you will, of course, find a lot of beautiful color prints of hummingbirds 
and other local flora and fauna, as well as a wide range of craft items, 
T-shirts, and other gifts.
Another good option is CASEM (% 2645-5190). This craft cooperative 
sells embroidered clothing, T-shirts, posters, and postcards with photos 
of the local flora and fauna, Boruca weavings, locally grown and roasted 
coffee, and many other items to remind you of your visit to Monteverde. 

 Chapter 17: Visiting the Cloud Forests of Monteverde 253
CASEM is located about halfway along the road between Santa Elena and 
the reserve.
Over the years, Monteverde has developed a thriving community of art-
ists. Around town, you’ll see paintings by local artists such as Paul Smith 
and Meg Wallace, among others. You should also check out the Casa de 
Arte (% 2645-5275), which has a mix of arts and crafts in many media.
Living It Up After Dark in Monteverde
The most popular after-dark activities in Monteverde are night hikes in 
one Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve (see listing for “Monteverde 
Cloud Forest Reserve” earlier in this chapter).
 
 If you want a taste of the local party scene, head to La Taberna 
(% 2645-5157), which is just outside of downtown Santa Elena, before 
the Serpentarium. This place attracts a mix of locals and tourists, cranks 
its music loud, and often gets people dancing.
You’ll certainly want to check whether any live music or another perfor-
mance is on offer at the Monteverde Amphitheater (% 2645-6272), a 
beautiful open-air performance space, located up a steep driveway 
across from CASEM. However, be forewarned: The concrete seats here 
are uncomfortable; try to bring something soft to sit on. Alternatively, 
the Flor de Vida restaurant (% 2645-6328) sometimes features live 
music or open-mic jam sessions.

La Fortuna and the 
Arenal Area
In This Chapter
▶ Getting to and around La Fortuna and the Arenal volcano
▶ Deciding where to stay and dine near the Arenal volcano
▶ Enjoying the volcano viewing, hot springs, and other attractions of this area
▶ Having fun and adventures on the shores of Lake Arenal
▶ Buying arts and crafts at a couple of excellent lakeside shops
A
t the epicenter of the north-central zone of Costa Rica, Lake Arenal 
and Arenal volcano — water and fire — are two of the country’s 
most striking natural attractions. In fact, the entire area is a naturalist’s 
dream come true. In addition to the volcano and lake, you’ll find rain for-
ests, jungle rivers and waterfalls, smaller mountain lakes, hot springs, 
and an unbelievable wealth of birds and other wildlife. Small, classy, iso-
lated lodges abound, and the sheer diversity of terrain, flora, and fauna 
is astounding.
If just enjoying the natural beauty and wonders of this area isn’t enough, 
you’ll also find ample opportunities to engage in a wealth of exciting 
adventure sports and tours.
La Fortuna and the Arenal Volcano
If you’ve never experienced them firsthand, the sights and sounds of an 
active volcano erupting are awesome. The Arenal volcano is one of the 
world’s most regularly active volcanoes. Frequent powerful explosions 
send cascades of red-hot lava rocks tumbling down the volcano’s steep 
slopes, and lava flows steam and rumble. Although this is all very 
impressive during the day, at night the volcano puts on its most mes-
merizing show. If you’re lucky enough to be here on a clear and active 
night, you’ll see the night sky turned red by lava spewing from Arenal’s 
crater and watch the glowing lava flows stream down its flanks.

Part VI: Monteverde and Environs 
256
Rising to a steep and well-defined cone — given recent activity, there’s 
actually a double cone near the top — the 1,607m (5,271-ft.) Arenal vol-
cano lay dormant for hundreds of years until July 1968, when a sudden 
eruption leveled the former town of Tabacón and killed almost 80 of its 
inhabitants.
At the eastern foot of Arenal volcano is the small rural community of 
La Fortuna. This town has become a magnet for volcano watchers from 
around the world. You’ll find a host of hotels and restaurants in and 
near La Fortuna, and from here you can arrange night tours to the best 
volcano viewing spots, which are 17km (11 miles) away on the western 
slope, on the road to and beyond Tabacón Grand Spa Thermal Resort.
Getting there
This area is best visited in a four-wheel-drive rental car. Although bus 
transportation to the area is available, the freedom of having your own 
car really pays dividends. However, the easiest and quickest way to visit

La Fortuna

 Chapter 18: La Fortuna and the Arenal Area 257
the area is to take a commuter plane to La Fortuna and then rent a car 
after you’re in town. You’ll find details on all these options in the follow-
ing sections.
By plane
Nature Air (% 800-235-9272 in the U.S. and Canada, 2299-6000 in Costa 
Rica; www.natureair.com) and Sansa (% 877-767-2672 in the U.S. and 
Canada, 2290-4100 in Costa Rica; www.flysansa.com) both have daily 
flights to Arenal/La Fortuna from San José. The flight duration is 30 min-
utes; the one-way fare is $68 on Sansa, $94 on Nature Air. Nature Air also 
has connecting flights between Arenal and other major destinations in 
the country.
By car
You can take several routes to La Fortuna from San José. The most pop-
ular is to head west on the Interamerican Highway and then turn north 
at Naranjo, continuing north through Zarcero to Ciudad Quesada. From 
Ciudad Quesada, one route goes through Jabillos, while the other goes 
through Muelle. The former route is better marked, more popular, 
slightly shorter, and generally better maintained, but the severe weather 
and heavy traffic quickly take their toll, and the roads up here can be 
notoriously bad for long stretches. This route offers wonderful views of 
the San Carlos Valley as you come down from Ciudad Quesada, and 
Zarcero, with its topiary gardens and quaint church, makes a good place 
to stop, stretch your legs, and snap a few photos.
You can also stay on the Interamerican Highway until San Ramón (west 
of Naranjo) and then head north through La Tigra. This route is also 
very scenic and passes the hotels Villablanca and Valle Escondido.
The travel time on any of these routes is three to four hours.
By bus
Direct buses (% 2255-0567) leave San José for La Fortuna roughly every 
two hours between 5 a.m. and 7:30 p.m. from the Atlántico del Norte 
bus station at Avenida 9 and Calle 12. The trip takes four and a half 
hours. The fare is $3.70.
 
 Some of the direct buses to La Fortuna will be labeled “Tilarán”; others 
will be labeled just “La Fortuna.” All these buses leave from the same 
terminal. There are two routes to Tilarán — one via Ciudad Quesada and 
La Fortuna, the other via the Interamerican Highway and Cañas. If you 
take a bus labeled “Tilarán,” be sure to ask the driver beforehand if it 
passes through Ciudad Quesada. If it doesn’t, you’ll end up in Tilarán via 
the Interamerican Highway, a long way from La Fortuna.
However, if there’s a long wait until the next direct bus, taking a bus first 
to Ciudad Quesada and then transferring will get you to La Fortuna a 
little bit quicker. These buses depart roughly every 30 minutes between 

Part VI: Monteverde and Environs 
258
5 a.m. and 7:30 p.m. The fare for the two-and-a-half-hour trip is $3. Local 
buses between Ciudad Quesada and La Fortuna run regularly through 
the day, although the schedule changes frequently, depending on 
demand. The trip lasts one hour; the fare is $1.50.
A bus departs Monteverde and Santa Elena for Tilarán every day at 7 
a.m. This is a journey of only 35km (22 miles), but the trip lasts two and 
a half hours because the road is in such horrendous condition. People 
with bad backs should think twice about making this trip, especially by 
bus. The return bus from Tilarán to Santa Elena leaves at 12:30 p.m. The 
fare is $2.30.
Buses from Tilarán to La Fortuna depart daily at 8 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. and 
make the return trip at 7 a.m. and 12:30 p.m. The trip is three to four 
hours. The fare is $2.75.
Buses depart La Fortuna for San José roughly every two hours between 
5 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. In some instances, you may have to transfer in 
Ciudad Quesada; from there, you can catch one of the frequent buses to 
San José.
Gray Line (% 2220-2126; www.graylinecostarica.com) has two 
daily buses that leaves San José for La Fortuna at 7 a.m. and 3:30 p.m. 
Interbus (% 2283-5573; www.interbusonline.com) also has two 
buses daily, leaving San José for La Fortuna at 8 a.m. and 2 p.m. The fare 
is $35 with Gray Line and $39 with Interbus. Both companies will pick you 
up at most San José–area hotels; they also run routes from La Fortuna 
with connections to most other major destinations in Costa Rica.
For information on taxi, boat, and horseback transfers between La 
Fortuna and Monteverde, see Chapter 17.
Orienting yourself in La Fortuna 
and around the volcano
As you enter La Fortuna, you’ll see the massive volcano directly in front 
of you. La Fortuna is only a few streets wide, with almost all the hotels, 
restaurants, and shops clustered around the small downtown area, or 
spread along the main road that leads out of town toward Tabacón and 
the volcano. You’ll find several tour-booking offices, Internet cafes, sou-
venir shops and laundromats, on the streets that surround the small 
central park that fronts the Catholic church, La Iglesia de La Fortuna.
From the center of La Fortuna, a road heads toward Lake Arenal. This 
road passes first through Tabacón and then by the entrance to Arenal 
National Park, before crossing the dam over Lake Arenal and continuing 
on around the lake to Nuevo Arenal and Tilarán.
 
 Many of the hotels with the best views of the Arenal volcano are located 
along the section of this road between La Fortuna and the Tabacón 
Grand Spa Thermal Resort.

 Chapter 18: La Fortuna and the Arenal Area 259
Getting around and getting information
Tons of taxis can be found in La Fortuna (you can flag one down practi-
cally anywhere), and there is always a line of them ready and waiting 
along the main road beside the central park. A taxi between La Fortuna 
and Tabacón should cost around $6. Call Arenal Taxi at % 2479-9605.
Another alternative is to rent a car when you get here. Alamo (% 2479-
9090; www.alamo.com) and Poás (% 2479-8027; www.carentals.
com) both have offices in La Fortuna.
You’ll also find several places to rent scooters and ATVs around town. 
As long as it’s not raining too heavily, this is a good way to get around. 
Rates run around $35 to $50 per day for a scooter, and $50 to $90 for 
an ATV.
 
 If you don’t have a car and you want to visit the hot springs or view the 
volcano’s eruptions, you’ll need to either take a cab or go on an orga-
nized tour.
No official information offices are in this area, although many of the local 
gift shops and tour agencies advertise themselves as such. Your hotel 
tour desk, concierge, or front desk will probably be your best source of 
information (besides this book, of course).
Spending the night
Arenal Kioro
$$$$ Near Lake Arenal
This place is seriously close to the volcano. The views from the hotel’s 
rooms, grounds, pool, and restaurant are astounding. The rooms them-
selves are massive and opulent, with soaring high ceilings, large picture 
windows and glass doors, and a private balcony or patio facing the action. 
Each has its own four-person modern Jacuzzi tub, with sculpted seats and 
numerous jets. This Jacuzzi is set below a large picture window with a 
volcano view and is an attempt to compensate for the fact that there are 
no natural hot springs right on the grounds. The beds are also set to take 
in the view. The spa here is well designed and offers a wide range of treat-
ment options. There are trails through the grounds, a pretty outdoor pool, 
and a whole host of tours and activities. The restaurant serves excellent 
international cuisine in a beautiful setting, with a giant wall of windows 
strategically set facing the volcano.

 Arenal Observatory Lodge
$$–$$$ On the flanks of the Arenal volcano
This hotel is built on a high ridge with a spectacular view of the volcano’s 
cone. Rooms come in a variety of shapes and sizes, and in a variety of 
locations around the lodge’s expansive grounds. The best rooms here are 
the five junior suites built below the restaurant and main lodge, as well as 
the four rooms in the Observatory Block, and the White Hawk villa. The 
Smithsonian rooms are also a good choice; they feature massive picture 
windows, with a direct view of the volcano. The standard rooms are 
simple and rustic with no volcano views.
This is one of the better nature lodges for travelers with disabilities, with 
five rooms truly equipped for wheelchair access and a paved path extend-
ing almost a kilometer (1⁄2 mile) into the rain forest. When you’re not hiking 
or touring the region, you can hang by the volcano-view swimming pool 
and Jacuzzi.
To get here, head to the national park entrance, stay on the dirt road past 
the entrance, and follow the signs to the Observatory Lodge. A four-wheel-
drive vehicle used to be required for the 9km (51⁄2-mile) dirt road up to the 
lodge, but two bridges now eliminate the need to ford any major rivers, 
and a traditional sedan will usually make it even in the rainy season — 
although you’ll always be better off with the clearance afforded by a four-
wheel-drive vehicle.

 Hotel Boutique Las Colinas
$–$$ Downtown La Fortuna
Like the Hotel La Fortuna (see the next listing), this long-standing down-
town hotel was torn down and rebuilt. Today, Las Colinas sits as the cen-
terpiece of a minimall, which features some shops and a small spa. The 
rooms range from simple budget accommodations to spiffy junior suites 
with a private volcano-view balcony and Jacuzzi. The budget rooms come 
with televisions, but they lack air-conditioning and some of the other ame-
nities found in the rest of the rooms. All come with free Wi-Fi. The best 
feature of the hotel is its ample rooftop terrace, with a fabulous volcano 
view, where breakfasts are served. Ecofriendly touches include solar-
heated water and an adherence to various sustainable and responsible 
tourism principles.

Hotel La Fortuna
$$ Downtown La Fortuna
This budget stalwart burned down a few years ago and was quickly rebuilt 
as a budget classic. However, it was again razed (intentionally) and 
replaced with a massive and modern five-story building. Centrally located 
just 1 block south of the gas station, the Hotel La Fortuna now features 
large, spiffy rooms with a host of modern amenities, including free Wi-Fi 
throughout. The best rooms have volcano-view private balconies — ask 
for one on the fourth or fifth floor with a volcano view. Twelve of the 
rooms are specially designed for wheelchair accessibility and disabled 
travelers.

Hotel San Bosco
$ La Fortuna
Located a block off La Fortuna’s main street, the San Bosco offers the best 
rooms to be found right in town. The hotel actually has two styles of 
rooms. The older units are all well maintained and feature tile floors and 
fans; however, these are little more than standard budget accommoda-
tions. The slightly more expensive rooms are much more attractive and 
have stone walls, tile floors, reading lights, televisions, and benches on 
the veranda in front. You’ll find an observation deck for volcano viewing 
on the top floor of the hotel, as well as a helpful front-desk staff. Free Wi-Fi 
is available throughout the hotel grounds.

Montaña de Fuego Inn
$$$ On the road to Tabacón
This hotel features a mix of individual cabins and two-story buildings built 
on stilts over a small artificial lake, which house a handful of suites. The 
junior suites are the best rooms here, with minifridges. Some even have 
back balconies overlooking a forested ravine, in addition to the volcano-
facing front porch. Behind the hotel are some rolling hills that lead down 
to a small river surrounded by patches of gallery forest, where they con-
duct an adventurous horseback, hiking, rappel, and kayak loop tour. 
These folks have their own zip-line canopy tour, on site.

 The Springs Resort & Spa
$$$$$ Off the road to Tabacón
Located well off the main road between La Fortuna and Tabacón, on a 
large tract of land with a great view of the volcano, this new resort features 
plush, luxurious rooms, and some fabulous facilities. The five-story main 
lodge building is massive, with several restaurants, a large, full-service spa, 
modern exercise room, open-air casino, and much-needed elevator. At its 
base sit a series of sculpted hot and cold pools of various sizes, and below 
these you’ll find the suites and villas. All the accommodations here are 
opulently appointed, and all have volcano views. The bathrooms are large, 
marble affairs with huge Jacuzzi tubs and separate showers. Food and ser-
vice here are excellent, as you would expect. Note: Don’t confuse this place 
with the Arenal Springs Resort, which is far less luxurious.

 Tabacón Grand Spa Thermal Resort
$$$$–$$$$$ Between La Fortuna and Lake Arenal
This hotel is built just above and across the street from the spectacular 
Tabacón hot springs. Many rooms here have excellent, direct views of the 
volcano. Rooms on the upper floors of the 300-block building have the 
best vistas. Still, quite a few of the rooms have obstructed, or no, views. 
Book a standard superior, which comes with a view — it’s definitely worth 
the slight splurge over the straight standard. The newer Forest Deluxe 
rooms are perhaps some of the plusher rooms here, with a private mosaic 
tile Jacuzzi and plasma-screen televisions, but, as the name suggests, they 
come with forest and not volcano views. All rooms are spacious, with 
heavy wooden furniture; most have a private terrace or balcony with a 
table and a couple of chairs. All are nonsmoking and feature free Wi-Fi. 
Nine of the rooms here are designed to be truly accessible to travelers 
with disabilities, and 11 are suites, with separate sitting rooms; many have 
private volcano-view Jacuzzis. Guests here enjoy privileges at the hot 
springs complex and spa across the street, including slightly extended 
hours. The hotel boasts an excellent restaurant, as well as a large hot-
spring-fed pool and separate Jacuzzi.

Antonio. The hotel consists of a series of Tico-style casitas surrounded by 
800 hectares (1,976 acres) of farm and forest. Each casita is built of adobe 
and has tile floors, open-beamed ceilings, and whitewashed walls. Inside, 
you’ll find a fireplace in one corner, comfortable hardwood chairs, and 
either one queen or two twin beds covered with colorful bedspreads. The 
deluxe units and suites have separate sitting areas with foldout couches, 
whirlpool bathtubs, and separate showers. In many rooms, the bathroom 
tubs look out through a wall of windows onto lush gardens. Some have 
private patios. Four of the old casitas were converted into a branch of 
Serenity Spa. Adjacent to the lodge are 11km (63⁄4 miles) of trails through 
the Los Angeles Cloud Forest Reserve. You can also rent horses or take 
an adventurous swing through the canopy on a canopy tour here.
Villablanca is actually over an hour from La Fortuna, but it’s on the way 
and makes a good overnight stop en route. Villablanca is off the beaten 
track, but it’s relatively close to San José, and if you’re interested in bird-
watching or exploring a cloud forest and want to avoid the crowds of 
Monteverde, this is a good choice. If you’re driving, head west out of San 
José to San Ramón and then head north, following the signs to Villablanca. 
Or you can take a public bus from San José to San Ramón and then take a 
taxi for around $15.

Volcano Lodge
$$ Between La Fortuna and Lake Arenal
This lodge is located directly across the road from and facing the volcano. 
Each of the rooms comes with two double beds, a private bathroom, two 
wicker chairs inside, and a small terrace with a couple of wooden rocking 
chairs for volcano viewing outside. The appointments are simple, but the 
rooms are spacious and get plenty of light through big picture windows. 
Moreover, the view of the volcano here is top notch, and a wide range of 
tours is available. The entire complex is wired for Wi-Fi access.

Exploring La Fortuna and the Arenal volcano area
Although the La Fortuna waterfall and various hot springs are easy to 
visit on your own, the other attractions and activities listed here are 
best experienced as part of an organized tour or outing.
The top attractions
Arenal Volcano and Arenal National Park
Arenal volcano is an impressive site. It’s Costa Rica’s most active volcano, 
regularly spewing lava from its near perfect cone. Still, the first thing you 
should know is that Arenal volcano borders a region of cloud and rain 
forests, and the volcano’s cone is often socked in by fog. Many people 
come to Arenal and never get to see the exposed cone. Moreover, the 
volcano does go through periods when it’s relatively quiet.

 Chapter 18: La Fortuna and the Arenal Area 265
The second thing you should know is that you can’t climb Arenal volcano; 
it’s not safe, due to the constant activity. Several foolish people who have 
ignored this warning have lost their lives, and others have been severely 
injured. The most recent fatalities occurred in August 2000.
 
 Still, waiting for and watching Arenal’s regular eruptions is the main activ-
ity in La Fortuna and is best done at night, when the orange lava glows 
against the starry sky. Although you can simply look up from the middle 
of town and see Arenal erupting, the view is best from the north and west 
sides of the volcano along the road to Tabacón and toward the national 
park entrance. If you have a car, you can drive along this road, but if 
you’ve arrived by bus, you’ll need to take a taxi or tour.
Arenal National Park constitutes an area of more than 2,880 hectares 
(7,114 acres), which includes the viewing and parking areas closest to the 
volcano. The trails inside the park are gorgeous and fun, running through 
forest and over old lava flows. However, at night, the view from inside the 
park is no better than on the roads just outside it.
 
 If you don’t have a car and you’re staying in La Fortuna, every hotel in 
town and several tour offices offer night tours to the volcano. The tours 
usually don’t actually enter the park; they stop on the road that runs 
between the park entrance and the Arenal Observatory Lodge. These 
tours cost between $10 and $30 per person. Often these volcano-viewing 
tours include a stop at one of the local hot springs, and the price goes up 
accordingly.
 
 Although it’s counterintuitive, the rainy season is often a better time to 
see the exposed cone of Arenal volcano, especially at night. I don’t know 
why this is, but I’ve had excellent volcano-viewing sessions at various 
points during the rainy season, whereas during the dry season, the vol-
cano can often be socked in solid for days at a time. The bottom line is 
that catching a glimpse of the volcano’s cone is never a sure thing.
See map p. 256. 17km (11 miles) west of La Fortuna. % 2461-8499. Admission: $10 per 
person. Open: Daily 8:30 a.m.–10 p.m.
Caño Negro National Wildlife Refuge
Caño Negro National Wildlife Refuge is a vast network of marshes and 
rivers, best known for its amazing abundance of bird life, including rose-
ate spoonbills, jabirus, herons, and egrets, but you can also see caimans 
and crocodiles. Bird-watchers should not miss this refuge, although keep 
in mind that the main lake dries up in the dry season (mid-Apr to Nov), 
which reduces the number of wading birds.
All the hotel tour desks and tour agencies in this area offer tours to Caño 
Negro. Full-day tours average between $55 and $65 per person. However, 
most of the trips run out of the La Fortuna area that are billed as Caño 
Negro tours never really enter the refuge but instead ply sections of the 
nearby Río Frio, featuring similar wildlife and ecosystems.
About 100km (62 miles) north of La Fortuna, near the town of Los Chiles. Admission: 
$10 per person. Open: Daily 7 a.m.–4 p.m.

Part VI: Monteverde and Environs

La Fortuna Falls
The La Fortuna waterfall is an impressive jungle torrent plunging in a 
strong plume from dense rain forest into a perfectly round pool far below. 
There’s a sign in town to indicate the road that leads out to the falls. You 
can drive or hike to just within viewing distance. It’s another 15- to 
20-minute hike down a steep and often muddy path to the pool formed by 
the waterfall. The hike back up will take slightly longer. You can swim, but 
stay away from the turbulent water at the base of the falls — several 
people have drowned here. Instead, check out and enjoy the calm pool 
just around the bend, or join the locals at the popular swimming hole 
under the bridge on the paved road, just after the turnoff for the road up 
to the falls. You can hike, drive, or sign up for one of the many horseback 
or mountain-bike tours out here.
See map p. 256. 5.5km (31⁄2 miles) outside of La Fortuna. % 2479-8360. Admission: $6. 
Open: Daily 8 a.m.–4 p.m.
Soaking your weary bones
Arenal volcano has bestowed a terrific fringe benefit on the area around it: several 
naturally heated thermal springs. Tabacón Grand Spa Thermal Resort (% 2519-1900; 
www.tabacon.com) is the most extensive and luxurious spot where you can soak 
your tired bones. A series of variously sized pools, fed by natural springs, are spread 
among lush gardens. At the center is a large, warm, spring-fed swimming pool with a 
slide, a swim-up bar, and a perfect view of the volcano. One of the stronger streams 
flows over a sculpted waterfall, with a rock ledge underneath that provides a great spot 
to sit and receive a free hydraulic shoulder massage. The resort also has a spa on the 
grounds offering professional massages, mud masks, and other treatments at reason-
able prices.
In addition to the poolside swim-up bar, you’ll find a restaurant and separate snack 
bar and grill here. You can sign a credit card voucher when you enter and charge your 
food and drinks throughout your stay. This sure beats pulling soggy bills from your bath-
ing suit.
Entrance fees are $85 for adults and $40 for children 11 and under. This rate includes 
either a buffet lunch or a dinner, and allows admission for a full day. After 6 p.m., you 
can enter for $45, not including any meals. The hot springs are open daily from noon to 
10 p.m. Spa treatments can be scheduled as early as 8 a.m., and guests at the hotel here 
can enter at 10 a.m. There’s a slight discount for entering after 7 p.m. The management 
sometimes enforces its policy of limiting the number of visitors at any one time, so 
reservations are recommended during the high season.
Baldi Termae (% 2479-9651), next to the Volcano Look Disco, are the first hot springs 
you’ll come to as you drive from La Fortuna toward Tabacón. This place has grown 
substantially over the years, with many different pools, slides, and bars and restaurants 
spread around the expansive grounds. However, I find this place far less attractive than 
either of the other two options mentioned here. There’s much more of a party vibe at 
Baldi, with loud music often blaring at some of the swim-up bars. Admission is $34.

 Chapter 18: La Fortuna and the Arenal Area 267
 Los Lagos
Families with kids may want to head to Jungla y Senderos Los Lagos. 
Children and the young-at-heart love the pool, fountain, and water slide 
here. I come here more for the network of trails and small lakes that are 
also on the property. You’ll also find a small crocodile hatchery and tila-
pia farm, a canopy tour, and some basic hot springs here.
See map p. 256.On the road to Tabacón, a few kilometers out of La Fortuna. % 2479-
1000. www.hotelloslagos.com. Admission: $15 for daily use of facilities. Open: 
Daily 8 a.m.–4 p.m.
More cool things to see and do
 
✓ Canopy tours, bungee-jumping, hanging bridges, and canyoning: 
Thrill seekers have plenty of options in this area. The best canopy 
tour operation in the area is Sky Tram (% 2479-9944; www.sky
trek.com). Every tour at this complex begins with an open, 
gondola-style ride that takes off near the shores of Lake Arenal and 
rises up, providing excellent views of the lake and volcano. From 
here you can hike their series of trails and suspended bridges. In 
the end, you can either hike down, take the gondola, or strap on 
a harness and ride their cable canopy tour down to the bottom. 
The zip-line tour here features several very long and very fast sec-
tions, with some impressive views of the lake and volcano. The 
cost is $60 for the combined tram ride up and zip-line down. It’s 
$50 to ride the tram round-trip. Sky Tram is open daily from 8 a.m. 
to 4 p.m.
 
 If you’d like a bigger rush than the canopy tours offer, you should 
go canyoning. This adventure sport is a mix of hiking through and 
alongside a jungle river, punctuated with periodic rappels through 
and alongside the faces of rushing waterfalls. Pure Trek Canyoning 
(% 866-569-5723 in the U.S. and Canada, 2479-1313 in Costa Rica; 
www.puretrekcostarica.com) and Desafío Expeditions (% 2479-
9464; www.desafiocostarica.com) both offer canyoning 
Just across the street from Baldi Hot Springs is the unmarked entrance of my current 
favorite local hot spring, Eco Termales (% 2479-8484). Smaller and more intimate than 
Tabacón, this series of pools set amid lush forest and gardens is almost as picturesque 
and luxurious, although there are far fewer pools, the spa services are much less exten-
sive, and there is no view of the volcano. Reservations are absolutely necessary here, 
and total admissions are limited so that it’s never crowded. Admission is $29. These 
folks have added a restaurant serving basic local fare, but I recommend just coming for 
the springs.
Finally, the newest entrant in the field is Tikokú (% 2479-1700), which is located right 
beside Baldi, and run by the folks at Arenal Kioro. This spot features a row of eight 
descending sculpted pools. Admission is $24.

Part VI: Monteverde and Environs

adventures. Pure Trek’s trip is probably better for first-timers and 
families with kids, while Desafio’s tour is just a bit more rugged and 
adventurous. Desafio charges $90; and Puretrek $95, for a half-day 
canyoning tour, and both offer various combination and full-day 
tours.
 
 For a mellower means of getting into the forest canopy, you can 
hike the trails and bridges of Arenal Hanging Bridges (% 2290-
0469; www.hangingbridges.com). Located just over the Lake 
Arenal dam, this attraction is a complex of gentle trails and suspen-
sion bridges through a beautiful tract of primary forest. It’s open 
daily from 7:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.; admission is $22. Guided tours and 
night tours are also available here.
 
 Finally, you can take a bungee jump in downtown La Fortuna at 
Arenal Bungee (% 2479-7440; www.arenalbungee.com). The 
bungee jump here is a 40m (130-ft.) fall from a steel tower con-
structed on the outskirts of downtown La Fortuna. They also offer 
the opportunity for a water landing, as well as a rocket launch, 
which is kind of the equivalent of becoming a human sling shot. 
Jumps, falls, and rocket shots cost $50. Various combination pack-
ages are available. This attraction is open from 9:30 a.m. to 9:30 
p.m. daily, so you can even partake in the fun after dark.
 
✓ Fishing: Lake Arenal is the largest body of fresh water in Costa 
Rica, and fishing is a popular activity here. The big action on Lake 
Arenal is guapote, a Central American species of rainbow bass. 
However, you can also book fishing trips to Caño Negro, where 
snook, tarpon, and other game fish can be stalked. Most hotels 
and adventure-tour companies can arrange fishing excursions. 
Costs run around $150 to $250 for a half-day and $250 to $500 for 
a full day.
 
✓ Horseback-riding: Horseback-riding is a popular activity in this 
area, and you’ll find scores of good rides on dirt back roads and 
through open fields and dense rain forest. Volcano and lake views 
come with the terrain on most rides. Horseback trips to the Río 
Fortuna waterfall are perhaps the most popular tours sold, but 
remember, the horse will get you only to the entrance; from there, 
you’ll have to hike a bit. A horseback ride to the falls should cost 
between $20 and $40, including the entrance fee. Alternately, you 
can check in with the folks at Cabalgata Don Tobias (% 2479-
1212; www.cabalgatadontobias.com), which operates its tour 
on private land (a mix of farmland and forest), with some great 
views of the volcano.
 
 
✓ Mountain-biking: This region is very well suited for mountain-
biking. Rides range in difficulty from moderate to extremely chal-
lenging. You can combine a day on a mountain bike with a visit 
to one or more of the more popular attractions here. Bike Arenal 
(% 866-465-4114 in the U.S. and Canada, 2479-9454 in Costa Rica; 
www.bikearenal.com) is the only dedicated operator in the field, 

 Chapter 18: La Fortuna and the Arenal Area 269
with an excellent collection of top-notch bikes and equipment, as 
well as a wide range of tour possibilities.
 
✓ White-water rafting: If you want to get wet and wild, contact 
Desafío Expeditions (% 2479-9464; www.desafiocostarica.
com) or Wave Expeditions (% 888/224-6105 in the U.S., or 2479-
7262; www.waveexpeditions.com). Both of these companies 
offer daily raft rides of Class I to II, III, and IV to V on different sec-
tions of the Toro, Peñas Blancas, and Sarapiquí rivers. A half-day 
float trip on a nearby river costs around $65 per person; a full day 
of rafting on some rougher water costs $85 per person, depending 
on what section of what river you ride. Both companies also offer 
mountain-biking and most of the standard local guided trips. If you 
want a wet and personal ride, try Desafío’s tour in inflatable kayaks, 
or “duckies.”
Shopping for local treasures
Most of the shopping you’ll find in and around La Fortuna is limited to 
pretty uninspired tourist fare. One major exception is the shop of a local 
family that produces a wide range of wood sculptures. As you leave the 
town of La Fortuna toward Tabacón, keep your eye on the right-hand 
side of the road. When you see a massive collection of wood sculptures 
and a building reading Original Grand Gallery (no phone), slow down 
and pull over. A local artisan and his family produce works in a variety 
of styles and sizes. They specialize in faces, many of them larger than 
a typical home’s front door. You can also find a host of animal figures, 
ranging in style from purely representational to rather abstract. Another 
good shop for higher-end arts and crafts is Galeria Lunática (% 2479-
8255), located on the main road in La Fortuna.
You’ll also find good options as you drive around the lake. See “Along 
the Shores of Lake Arenal” later in this chapter for two good craft and 
gift shops found on the road that circles Lake Arenal.
Living it up after dark in La Fortuna 
and around the Arenal volcano
Waiting and watching for a volcanic eruption is the most popular after-
dark activity in this neck of the woods. Taking a soak in one of the local 
hot springs runs a close second.
The Volcano Look Disco (% 2479-9616) is located just out of town on 
the road to Tabacón. This place is very popular with locals and really 
gets going on Friday and Saturday nights. There’s also a small casino in 
downtown La Fortuna, Luigi’s Casino (% 2479-9636), although it feels 
out of place in this rural town and is seldom crowded. For a simple drink 
and conversation, the open-to-the-street bar at Don Rufino’s (see 
“Dining locally,” earlier) is my favorite spot.

Fortuna, and a few are strung along the 
road to the national park as well. Many 
hotels also have their own in-house Internet 
cafes or wireless service. Rates run 
between $1 and $3 per hour.
Newspapers
Several gift shops around town carry all the 
local papers, including the Tico Times.
Pharmacies
La Fortuna’s best pharmacy, Farmacia 
Catedral (% 2479-9518), is on the main 
street just off the small park in downtown 
La Fortuna.
Police
Call % 911 or 2479-9689.
Post Office
There is a post office in La Fortuna 
(% 2479-8070). Alternatively, most hotels 
can mail your letters and postcards for you.
Taxis
Taxis are plentiful in La Fortuna, and they 
frequently ply the road between La Fortuna 
and Tabacón Hot Springs. If you can’t flag 
one down on the street, have your hotel call 
for you, or call Arenal Taxi (% 2479-9605).
Along the Shores of Lake Arenal
The area surrounding Lake Arenal is beautiful and serene. A visit here 
gives you a taste of rural Costa Rica. Rolling hills and virgin forest flank 
Lake Arenal, the largest lake in Costa Rica. The imposing cone of Arenal 
volcano lies just beyond the eastern end of the lake, while the small 

 Chapter 18: La Fortuna and the Arenal Area 271
rural towns of Tilarán and Nuevo Arenal anchor the western end. The 
volcano’s barren slopes are a stunning sight from here, especially when 
reflected in the waters of the lake.
From December through April, strong and steady winds buffet the west-
ern end of the lake. Locals used to curse these winds. Today they draw 
hoards of avid sailboarders and kitesurfers. Lake Arenal’s combination 
of warm, fresh water, steady blows, and spectacular scenery, have made 
this spot a mecca for practitioners of these water sports.
Although the towns of Tilarán and Nuevo Arenal are little more than 
quiet rural communities, hotels have sprung up all along the shores of 
the lake. If you prefer to visit during less windy months, you may enjoy 
simply hanging out by the lake, hiking in the nearby forests, and catch-
ing glimpses of Arenal volcano.

Getting there
This is a region best visited in a rental car. There are no local airstrips, 
and bus service is infrequent. The drive around Lake Arenal is one of the 
prettiest in the country, although the road is periodically washed out in 
places, so a four-wheel-drive vehicle is highly recommended.
By car
From San José, take the Interamerican Highway west toward Puntarenas, 
and then continue north on this road to Cañas. In Cañas, turn east 
toward Tilarán. The drive takes four hours. If you’re continuing on to 
Nuevo Arenal, follow the signs in town, which will put you on the road 
that skirts the shore of the lake. Nuevo Arenal is about a half-hour drive 
from Tilarán. You can also drive here from La Fortuna, along a scenic 
road that winds around the lake. From La Fortuna, it’s approximately 
one hour to Nuevo Arenal and one and a half hours to Tilarán.
By bus
Transportes Tilaran express buses (% 2258-5792 in San José, 2695-5611 
in Tilarán) leave San José for Tilarán several times a day from Calle 20 
and Avenida 3. The trip lasts from four to five-and-a-half hours, depend-
ing on road conditions; the fare is $5.80.
A bus leaves from Santa Elena and Monteverde daily at 7 a.m. The fare 
for the three-hour trip is $2.30. Buses from La Fortuna leave for Tilarán 
daily at 8 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., returning at 7 a.m. and 12:30 p.m. The trip 
is two to three hours; the fare is $2.75.
From Tilarán, the bus to Santa Elena and Monteverde leaves daily at 
12:30 p.m. Buses also leave regularly for Cañas, where you can catch 
buses north or south along the Interamerican Highway.
Orienting yourself along the shores of Lake Arenal
Nuevo Arenal is about 50km (31 miles) east of La Fortuna. Tilarán is 
another 35km (22 miles) beyond Nuevo Arenal. If you’re coming from the 
Interamerican Highway, Tilarán is 24km (15 miles) northeast of Cañas.
Both Tilarán and Nuevo Arenal are small rural towns of just a few blocks 
in any direction. Each has a Catholic church and central plaza at the 
heart of town.
Getting around and getting information
Having a rental car is a good idea in this area. The road around Lake Arenal, 
is particularly beautiful and lends itself to some leisurely exploration. A 
four-wheel-drive vehicle is recommended, mostly for the added clearance.
If you need a taxi to get to a lodge on Lake Arenal, call Taxis Unidos 
Tilarán (% 2695-5324) in Tilarán, or Taxis Nuevo Arenal (% 2694-
4415) in Nuevo Arenal.

Spending the night
 
 Chalet Nicholas
$ Nuevo Arenal
This friendly bed-and-breakfast sits on a hill and features great views of 
the lake from its garden. All three rooms have a view of Arenal volcano in 
the distance. The upstairs loft room is the largest and comes with its own 
private deck. Chalet Nicholas is set on 6 hectares (15 acres) of land and 
has beautiful flower gardens, an organic vegetable garden, and an orchid 
garden. Behind the property are acres of forest through which you can 
hike in search of birds, orchids, butterflies, and other tropical treasures. 
No smoking is allowed in the house or on the grounds. Owners John and 
Catherine Nicholas go out of their way to make their guests feel at home, 
although their small pack of Great Danes may intimidate you when you 
first drive up.

 Hotel Tilawa
$–$$ Between Tilarán and Nuevo Arenal
Built to resemble the Palace of Knossos on the island of Crete, the Hotel 
Tilawa sits high on the slopes above the lake and has a sweeping vista 
down to the water. It’s primarily a windsurfers’ and kiteboarders’ hangout. 
Unusual colors and antique paint effects give the hotel a weathered look; 
inside there are wall murals and other artistic paint treatments through-
out. Rooms have dyed cement floors, Guatemalan bedspreads, big win-
dows, and free Wi-Fi. Some have kitchenettes. Tilawa can arrange 
windsurfing, kiteboarding, mountain-biking, horseback-riding, and fishing 
trips. The hotel even boasts a small skate park for radical skateboarders 
and BMX freestyle bikers, which makes this a good place to bring teenag-
ers. The hotel also has a small spa and one of the few microbrew opera-
tions in Costa Rica, both of which will appeal more to the adults.

Set on a high hill above Lake Arenal, this Italian-run joint has simple but 
spacious and cheery rooms. The painted cement floors are kept immacu-
late, and the rooms get good ventilation from their large windows. All 
rooms open onto a long and broad shared veranda with a great view of the 
lake. There’s also a separate private villa, with a kitchenette, fireplace, and 
large private deck. The owners can help you book a wide range of adven-
tures and tours. There’s a large, open-air yoga platform here, and the hotel

Named after a French explorer, and the rare palm species that he discov-
ered and named, this small bed-and-breakfast is nestled on a hill above 
Lake Arenal, just outside the town of Nuevo Arenal. Each room comes with 
one queen-size and one twin bed, large picture windows, and a spacious 
private balcony with an excellent lake view. The rooms get plenty of light, 
and the bright Guatemalan bedspreads and white-tile floors create a 
vibrant look. The separate casitas have full kitchens, more room, and even 
better views of the lake from their slightly higher perches. Breakfasts are 
extravagant and memorable, with a steady stream of fresh fruits; fresh 
juice; strong coffee; homemade pancakes, waffles, or muffins; and usually 
an excellent omelet or soufflé. There’s great bird-watching on the hotel 
grounds, and howler monkeys are common guests here as well.

The restaurant at this Italian-run hotel has a wonderful setting high on a 
hill overlooking the lake. The large dining room features rustic wooden 
chairs and tables, varnished wood floors, colorful tablecloths, and abun-
dant flower arrangements. The most striking features, aside from the view, 
are the large open fireplace on one end and, on the other, a large brick 
oven, in the shape of a small cottage, which turns out pizzas and foccacia. 
The pastas and delicious main dishes are authentically northern Italian.

find several tasty and filling options here, including stuffed potatoes and 
eggplant Parmesan. The homemade pesto features locally grown organic 
macadamia nuts. Wooden tables are set around the edges of the round 
dining room, with a high peaked roof. Candles and creative lighting give 
the place a cozy and warm feel.

Exploring along the shores of Lake Arenal
The only true “attraction” in this region is the Arenal Botanical Gardens 
and Butterfly Sanctuary. However, if you have your own car, the scenic 
drive around the lake could be considered an attraction in and of itself. 
Combine a visit to the botanical gardens with a leisurely drive, and stops 
at the two unique gift shops listed in “Shopping for local treasures,” later 
in this chapter.
Tilawa Windsurfing Center
From early December through April, strong and steady winds kick across 
the western end of Lake Arenal providing windsurfers and kiteboarders 
with the primary attraction and activity offered up by this region.
 
 Kiteboarding is an adventure sport, similar to windsurfing, except you’re 
tethered by a harness to a large kite, which you can steer via some control 
lines. The sport is known for the long and high jumps achieved by experi-
enced practitioners.
If you want to try your hand at either windsurfing or kiteboarding, you can 
rent equipment from Tilawa Windsurfing Center, which has its facilities 
on one of the lake’s few accessible beaches. Boards rent for around $55 
per day, and lessons are also available.
Tico Wind (% 2692-2002; www.ticowind.com) is also popular with seri-
ous sailboarders. It sets up shop on the shores of the lake each year from 
December 1 to the end of April, which is when the winds here blow most 
fiercely. Rates run around $78 per day, including lunch, with multiday 
packages available.
See map p. 271. Located on the lake shore 8km (5 miles) from Tilarán. % 2695-5050. 
www.windsurfcostarica.com. Open: Daily 7:30 a.m.–5 p.m. Admission: 
Variable rates for equipment rental and lessons.
More cool things to see and do
 
✓ Fishing: Ask at your hotel if you want to try your hand at fishing 
for guapote. These large members of the cichlid family are known 
locally as rainbow bass. Their sharp teeth and fighting nature make 
them a real challenge. A half-day fishing trip should cost around 
$150 to $250 per boat, and a full day goes for around $250 to $500. 
Typically, the boats accommodate up to three people fishing. If 

Part VI: Monteverde and Environs 
276
you’re interested in fishing, I recommend you check in with 
Captain Ron at Arenal Fishing Tours (% 2694-4678; www.arenal
fishing.com) or the Puerto San Luis Yacht Club (% 2695-5750; 
www.hotelpuertosanluiscr.com).
 
✓ Horseback riding and mountain biking: The hills, fields, and for-
ests of this area are perfect for exploring on horseback or riding a 
mountain bike. Any of the hotels in the area can hook you up with a 
horseback-riding tour for around $10 to $20 per hour. You can rent 
mountain bikes from the Hotel Tilawa (see earlier in this chapter).
 
✓ Wakeboarding: Lake Arenal is a big lake, and there are plenty of 
calm quiet corners to practice wakeboarding. If you’re interested in 
lessons, or just a reliable pull on a wakeboard or water skis, con-
tact Fly Zone (% 8339-5876; www.flyzone-cr.com). Simple pulls 
behind their specialized boat cost about $85 per hour, including 
boards, skis, and any other necessary gear.
Shopping for local treasures
If you’re in the area, don’t miss the Lucky Bug Gallery, an excellent little 
roadside arts-and-crafts and souvenir shop, attached to Willy’s Caballo 
Negro restaurant (see listing earlier in this chapter). This place features 
a host of functional and decorative pieces. Many of the works here are 
produced by the owner’s triplet daughters.
About halfway between Nuevo Arenal and Tilarán is Casa Delagua 
(% 2692-2101) the studio, gallery, and coffee shop of Costa Rican artist 
Juan Carlos Ruiz. These folks also have a good used-book and DVD col-
lection on sale.

Costa Rica’s less-traveled roads and destinations. In this 
part, you fi nd out all about the beautiful intimate beach 
resorts and secret getaway spots of the southern Nicoya 
Peninsula. Nature lovers will want to read up on Corcovado 
National Park and the remote, and often luxurious, rain-forest 
lodges of the rich southern zone. Finally, Costa Rica’s 
Caribbean coast, which often gets short shrift, is covered in 
detail, from the jungle canals and rain forests of Tortuguero, 
to the sleepy beach towns of Cahuita and Puerto Viejo.

Chapter 19
Seeking Solitude in 
Southern Nicoya
In This Chapter
▶ Landing a great room in Montezuma
▶ Bathing in the pool of a beautiful jungle waterfall
▶ Enjoying Malpaís before the adoring throngs overrun it
▶ Opting for a romantic and luxurious getaway at Punta Islita
T
he beaches and resorts of the southern Nicoya Peninsula are more 
isolated, less developed, and just a bit wilder than those found to 
the north on Guanacaste’s Gold Coast. This is a place to come if you 
really want to get away from it all.
The two main beach destinations in this area are Montezuma and 
Malpaís (which is a general term for a string of isolated beaches stretch-
ing north from Malpaís itself). Both offer miles of uncrowded beaches 
and lush forests all around. Montezuma features a couple of gorgeous 
waterfalls to visit, while Malpaís is becoming one of the country’s top 
surf destinations.
On the northern stretch of the Nicoyan coastline sits Punta Islita, one of 
the most exclusive and luxurious little resorts in the country.
Montezuma
For decades, Montezuma enjoyed near-legendary status among back-
packers, UFO seekers, hippie expatriates, and European budget travel-
ers. Although it still maintains its alternative vibe, Montezuma has 
matured, and is now a great destination for all manner of travelers look-
ing for a quiet beach retreat surrounded by some stunning scenery. 
Today the town has a well-tended, somewhat booming feel to it, and 
there are lodgings of value and quality in all price ranges. After all, the 
natural beauty, miles of almost abandoned beaches, rich wildlife, and 
jungle waterfalls first made Montezuma famous, and they continue to 
make this one of my favorite beach towns in Costa Rica.

Part VII: Touring the Rest of Costa Rica 
282
Getting there
Flying to Tambor and taking a taxi to Montezuma is the fastest and easi-
est way to travel out here. Taking a car or bus, however, includes a 
pretty and relaxing ferry ride.
By air
The nearest airport is in Tambor, 17km (11 miles) away. Sansa 
(% 877-767-2672 in the U.S. and Canada, 2290-4100 in Costa Rica; www.
flysansa.com) and Nature Air (% 800-235-9272 in the U.S. and 
Canada, 2299-6000 in Costa Rica; www.natureair.com) both have a 
couple of daily flights to Tambor. Flight duration is about 30 minutes, 
and fares run $94 to $99 each way.
Some of the hotels listed later in this chapter may be willing to pick you 
up in Tambor for a reasonable fee. If not, you’ll have to hire a taxi, which 
could cost anywhere from $20 to $30. Taxis are generally waiting to meet 
most regularly scheduled planes.
By car and ferry
The traditional route here is to take the Interamerican Highway from San 
José to Puntarenas and catch the ferry to Paquera. Montezuma is about 
75 minutes south of Paquera.
Naviera Tambor (% 2661-2084) ferries to Paquera leave Puntarenas 
roughly every two hours between 5 a.m. and 9 p.m. The trip takes one 
and a half hours. The fare is around $12 for a car and driver, $1.50 or so 
more for additional adults, 80¢ for children. I recommend arriving early 
during the peak season and on weekends because lines can be long; if 
you miss the ferry, you’ll have to wait almost two hours or more for the 
next one. Moreover, the ferry schedule changes frequently, with fewer 
ferries during the off season, and the occasional extra ferry during the 
high season to meet demand. Checking in advance is always best.
The car ferry from Paquera to Puntarenas leaves roughly every two 
hours between 8 a.m. and 9 p.m.
By bus and ferry
Transportes Rodriguez Hermanos (% 2642-0219) runs three daily 
direct buses between San José and Montezuma. The buses leave from 
the Coca-Cola bus terminal at Calle 12 and Avenida 5 at 6 a.m. and 2 p.m. 
The fare is around $12, including the ferry ride, and the trip takes a little 
over four hours.
Alternatively, it takes two buses and a ferry ride to get to Montezuma. 
Express buses (% 2222-0064) for Puntarenas leave San José daily every 
hour, between 6 a.m. and 7 p.m., from Calle 16 and Avenida 12. Trip 
duration is two and a half hours; the fare is $3.

 Chapter 19: Seeking Solitude in Southern Nicoya 283
From Puntarenas, you can take one of the car ferries mentioned above 
or the passenger launch Paquereña (% 2641-0515), which leaves from 
the pier behind the market at 11:30 a.m. and 4 p.m. The ferry trip takes 
one and a half hours; the fare is 90¢. A bus south to Montezuma will be 
waiting to meet the ferry when it arrives in Paquera. The bus ride takes 
another 55 minutes; the fare is $2.50.
 
 Be careful not to take the Naranjo ferry — it doesn’t meet with regular 
onward bus transportation to Montezuma.
When you’re ready to return, buses for Paquera leave Montezuma daily 
at regular intervals, timed to meet up with a departing ferry.
Orienting yourself in Montezuma
As the winding mountain road that descends into Montezuma bottoms 
out, you turn left onto a small dirt road that defines the village proper.

On this 1-block road, you’ll find El Sano Banano Village Café and, across 
from it, a small park with a basketball court and children’s playground. 
The bus stops at the end of this road. From here, hotels are scattered up 
and down the beach and around the village’s few sand streets.
 
 Buses are met by hordes of locals trying to corral you to one of the 
many budget hotels. Remember: They’re getting a commission for every 
body they bring in, so their information is biased.
Getting around and getting information
The town itself is very compact, and you can easily walk from most 
hotels to the beach and nearby waterfall.
Montezuma doesn’t have a huge number of taxis, but you can usually 
find one hanging around the small central downtown area. Taxis often 
park in front of the El Sano Banano Village Café. If you can’t find one 
there, you can call Gilberto (% 2642-0241) or Ronald (% 8822-0610) 
for a cab.
Montezuma has no official tourist information offices, but several all-
purpose tour agencies act as such. Cocozuma Traveler (% 2642-0911; 
www.cocozuma.com) and Montezuma Travel Adventures (% 2642-
0808; www.montezumatraveladventures.com) can both arrange 
horseback riding; boat excursions; scuba-dive and snorkel tours; rafting 
trips; car and motorcycle rentals; airport transfers; international phone, 
fax, and Internet service; and currency exchange.
Spending the night
 
 Amor de Mar
$–$$ Montezuma
It would be difficult to imagine a more idyllic spot in this — or any — price 
range. With its wide expanse of neatly trimmed grass sloping down to the 
sea, tide pools (one of which is as big as a small swimming pool), and ham-
mocks slung from the mango trees, this is the perfect place for anyone 
who wants to do some serious relaxing. The rooms are all housed in a 
beautifully appointed two-story building, which abounds in varnished 
hardwoods. Most of the rooms have plenty of space and receive lots of 
sunlight. The big porch on the second floor is a great place for reading or 
just gazing out to sea. Only breakfast and lunch are served here, but 
they’re served on a beautiful open-air patio overlooking the sea. These

El Jardin
$ Downtown Montezuma
Set on a steep hill, right on the crossroads leading into “downtown,” this 
is a good choice if you’re looking for a comfortable and well-equipped 
room close to the action. The rooms are located in a series of different 
buildings spread across the hillside. No. 9 is my favorite, with pretty 
stonework in the bathroom, a greater sense of privacy than some of the 
others, and a good view from its private terrace. A two-level pool and 
Jacuzzi is located in a relaxing little garden area. Although the hotel 
doesn’t have a restaurant, the town and its many dining options are just 
steps away.

 Hotel La Aurora
$ Montezuma
It’s hard to beat the value and laid-back vibe you’ll find at this longstand-
ing budget hotel. Located at the heart of the tiny village, the rooms are 
spread out over two neighboring buildings fronting Montezuma’s small 
central park and playground. The rooms here are clean and well-kept. I 
prefer the older rooms, which are located in a spacious, three-story, 
wooden building. There’s even a two-room apartment on the third floor 
here, with a private balcony and a bit of an ocean view through the tree-
tops. The hotel also features a small lending library, some hammocks and 
comfortable chairs, a communal kitchen, and flowering vines growing up 
the walls. In fact, plants and vines are all over La Aurora, which keeps 
things cool and gives the place a very tropical feel. Fresh coffee, tea, and 
hearty breakfasts are served each morning.

Hotel Los Mangos
$–$$ Montezuma
Situated across the road from the water, a little bit before the waterfall, on 
the road toward Cabo Blanco, this place takes its name from the many 
mango trees under which the bungalows are built. (If mango is your pas-
sion, come in May, when it’s in season.) The shared-bathroom budget 
rooms are very basic and a bit worn, but they’re a decent value and you 
do get access to the pool. The roomy, thatch-roofed octagonal bungalows 
built of Costa Rican hardwoods are the better choice. Each has a small 
porch with rocking chairs, a thatched roof, a good amount of space, and 
ceiling fans. Still, even these are pretty spartan. The swimming pool is

built to resemble a natural pond — there’s even an artificial waterfall flow-
ing into it — and there’s a separate Jacuzzi. These folks have a pretty and 
ample open-air yoga studio, and daily classes are offered.

 Hotel Lucy
$ Montezuma
Situated on a pretty section of beach, a bit south of town, in front of Los 
Mangos, this converted two-story home has the best location of any 
budget lodging in Montezuma. If you can snag a second-floor room with 
an ocean view, you’ll be in budget heaven. The beach here is a bit rough and 
rocky for swimming, but the sunbathing and sunset views are beautiful.

Ylang-Ylang Beach Resort
$$$–$$$$ Montezuma
Set in a lush patch of forest just steps away from the sand, the hotel offers 
rooms that are about a 15-minute walk northeast of town along the beach. 
Rooms and cabins come in a variety of shapes and sizes. Coco Joe’s 
Bungalow is the largest cabin and features a luscious wraparound balcony 
and a small sleeping loft. But I also like the smaller cabins, which are 
yellow, reinforced-concrete, geodesic domes that look like igloos. Or, you 
can opt for a “jungalow” — a large tent set on a wooden platform, featuring 
an indoor sink, small fridge, ceiling fan, and private deck. These units 
share nearby bathrooms and showers. There’s a beautiful little swimming 
pool with a sculpted waterfall, and the entire operation is set amid 
untouched forest and lush gardens planted with lots of banana, heliconia, 
and elephant-ear plants. There is no road to the resort, so arrival and 
check-in are taken care of at the downtown El Sano Banano Village Café.

This open-air restaurant is housed in an old house fronting the beach. 
There are only a few tables, so arrive early. If you don’t get a seat and you 
feel hearty, try the low wooden table surrounded by tatami mats on the 
sand. Dishes are served in large, broad, wooden bowls set on ceramic-
ringed coasters or on fresh banana leaves laid over rough-hewn hunks of 
wood. The outdoor grill is great for grilled fish and seafood. Every meal 
comes with plenty of fresh bread for soaking up the sauces. The menu 
changes nightly but always features several fish and seafood dishes. The 
fresh grouper in a black pepper sauce is phenomenal, as is the grilled squid.

Exploring Montezuma
Both of the major attractions here are easily visited on your own. You 
can either drive yourself or take a taxi or shuttle to the Cabo Blanco 
Absolute Nature Reserve, while the trailhead for the Montezuma water-
fall is just a short walk from the center of town.
The top attractions
Cabo Blanco Absolute Nature Reserve
As beautiful as the beaches around Montezuma are, the beaches at Cabo 
Blanco Absolute Nature Reserve are even more stunning. Located at the 
southernmost tip of the Nicoya Peninsula, Cabo Blanco is a national park 
that preserves a nesting site for brown pelicans, magnificent frigate birds, 

Part VII: Touring the Rest of Costa Rica 
288
and brown boobies. The main beach here is backed by lush tropical forest 
that is home to howler monkeys. You can hike through the preserve’s lush 
forest right down to the deserted, pristine Playa Cabo Blanco, which is 
4km (21⁄2 miles) away. Or, you can take a shorter 2km (11⁄4-mile) loop trail 
through the primary forest here. This is Costa Rica’s oldest official biore-
serve; it was set up thanks to the pioneering efforts of conservationists 
Karen Mogensen and Nicholas Wessberg.
The trails here are gentle and well-marked. However, if you want to see 
and learn about the local flora and fauna, you should hire one of the 
guides who hang out around the park office. A two-hour guided hike 
should cost around $25 to $35 for a group of up to four people.
Cabo Blanco Absolute Nature Reserve is located 11km (63⁄4 miles) south of 
the village, along a rough dirt road. Shuttle buses head from Montezuma 
to Cabo Blanco roughly every two hours beginning at 8 a.m., and then turn 
around and bring folks from Cabo Blanco to Montezuma; the last one 
leaves Cabo Blanco around 5 p.m. The fare is $2 each way. These shuttles 
often don’t run during the off season. Alternatively, you can share a taxi: 
The fare is around $15 to $20 per taxi, which can hold four or five 
passengers.
Cabo Blanco Absolute Nature Reserve is located 11km (63⁄4 miles) south of 
Montezuma, along the only road out of town. % 2642-0093. Admission: $10. Open: 
Wed–Sun 8 a.m.–4 p.m.
Montezuma Waterfall
Located a vigorous 20-minute hike into the rain forest, the Montezuma 
waterfall is a tropical fantasy, with a large torrent pouring down into a 
deep, cool pool. A couple of waterfalls are actually located up this stream, 
but the upper falls are, by far, the more spectacular. This is a popular spot 
and can get crowded during the high season and on weekends.
 
 Be very careful when climbing close to the rushing water and if you plan 
on taking any dives into the pools below. The rocks are quite slippery, and 
several people each year get very scraped up, break bones, and otherwise 
hurt themselves here.
You’ll find the trail to the falls just over the bridge south of the village (on 
your right, just past Las Cascadas restaurant). At the first major outcrop-
ping of rocks, the trail disappears and you have to scramble up the rocks 
and river for a bit. A trail occasionally reappears for short stretches. Just 
stick close to the stream and you’ll eventually hit the falls.

More cool things to see and do
 
✓ Braving a canopy tour: The Waterfall Canopy Tour (% 8823-6111 
or 2642-0808; www.suntrailsadventures.com) is built right 
alongside Montezuma’s famous falls. The tour, which features 9 
cables connecting 11 platforms, includes a stop to swim at a large 

 Chapter 19: Seeking Solitude in Southern Nicoya 289
pool above the largest drop in the falls. This tour is run several 
times each day and costs $40 per person.
 
 
✓ Chilling on the beach: The ocean here is a gorgeous royal blue, 
and beautiful beaches stretch out along the coast on either side of 
town. Be careful, though: The waves can occasionally be too rough 
for casual swimming, and you need to be aware of stray rocks at 
your feet. Be sure you know where the rocks and tide are before 
doing any bodysurfing. The best places to swim are a couple hun-
dred meters north of town in front of El Rincón de los Monos, or 
several kilometers farther north at Playa Grande.
 
 If you’re driving out to Cabo Blanco, you’ll pass through the tiny 
village of Cabuya. You’ll find a couple of hidden patches of beach 
to discover around here, if you poke around some of the deserted 
dirt roads.
 
 In the center of the village, you’ll find some rental shops where you 
can rent boogie boards and snorkeling equipment (although the 
water must be very calm for snorkeling).
 
✓ Horseback riding: Several people around the village will rent you 
horses for around $10 to $20 an hour, although most people choose 
to do a guided four-hour horseback tour for $30 to $50. The most 
popular ride is to a second waterfall 8km (5 miles) north of 
Montezuma. Dubbed El Chorro, this waterfall cascades into a tide 
pool at the edge of the ocean. The pool here is a delightful mix of 
fresh water and seawater, and you can bathe while gazing out over 
the sea and rocky coastline. When the water is clear and calm, this 
is one of my favorite swimming holes in all of Costa Rica. However, 
a massive landslide in 2004 filled in much of this pool and also 
somewhat lessened the drama and beauty of the actual falls. 
Moreover, the pool here is dependent upon the tides — it disap-
pears entirely at very high tide. Luis, whose rental place is down 
the road that leads from town out to the beach, is a reliable source 
for horses, as is “Roger, the horse guy” — any local can direct you 
to him. However, you’ll find the best-cared-for and -kept horses at 
Finca Los Caballos (% 2642-0124), which is located up the hill on 
the road leading into Montezuma.
Shopping in Montezuma
Plenty of simple souvenir stores, as well as itinerant artisans selling 
their wares on the street, rest in Montezuma; most of the offerings are 
pretty standard fare. However, it’s definitely worth stopping in at Piedra 
Colorado (% 2642-0612 or 8841-5855) to check out their impressive 
silver, stone, and polished-shell creations. This place is located in the 
tiny strip mall in the center of Montezuma.
Living it up after dark in Montezuma
The local action is centered on a couple of bars in downtown Montezuma. 
Head to either Chico’s Bar (no phone) or the bar at the Hotel Moctezuma 

Part VII: Touring the Rest of Costa Rica 
290
(% 2642-0058). Both are located on the main strip in town facing the 
water. If your evening tastes are mellower, El Sano Banano Village Café 
(% 2642-0944) doubles as the local movie house. Nightly DVD releases 
are projected on a large screen; the selection ranges from first run to 
quite artsy, and there’s a constantly growing library of more than 800 
movies. The movies begin at 7:30 p.m. and require a minimum purchase 
of $5.50.

 Chapter 19: Seeking Solitude in Southern Nicoya 291
Malpaís and Santa Teresa
Malpaís translates as “badlands”; though that moniker may have fit at 
one time, it’s no longer very appropriate. The beach here is a long, wide 
expanse of light sand, dotted with rocky outcroppings. Sure, it can get 
rough here, but the surfers love it. The road out here from Cóbano used 
to be even rougher than the surf, but it’s gradually being tamed.
Punta Islita
On the northern stretch of coast making up the Nicoya Peninsula sits one of Costa 
Rica’s premier, small, luxury resorts, Hotel Punta Islita (% 866-446-4053 in the U.S. and 
Canada, 2231-6122 in Costa Rica, 2661-4044 at the hotel; Fax: 2231-0715; www.hotel
puntaislita.com). Nothing else is around, but if you’re looking for fabulous rooms, 
great views, an isolated beach, personalized service, and plenty of amenities and activi-
ties to choose from, this spot is perfect.
Punta Islita is isolated on a high bluff between two mountain ridges that meet the sea. 
The rooms here are done up in a Santa Fe style, with red Mexican floor tiles, Neo-
Navajo-print bedspreads, and adobe-colored walls offset with sky-blue doors and trim. 
Each room has a king-size bed and a private patio with a hammock; a few of these also 
have Jacuzzis. The suites come with a separate sitting room and a private two-person 
plunge pool or Jacuzzi; the villas have two or three bedrooms, their own private swim-
ming pools, and full kitchens. The open-air poolside restaurant here serves excellent 
Continental cuisine with an emphasis on fresh local ingredients.
The beach below the hotel is a small crescent of gray-white sand with a calm, protected 
section at the northern end. It’s about a ten-minute hike, but the hotel will shuttle you 
down and back if you don’t feel like walking. You can take the hotel’s small canopy tour, 
which leaves from just below the small gym and ends just steps from the beach. There’s 
a rancho bar and grill down there, for when you get hungry or thirsty, and a lap pool for 
when the waves are too rough. The hotel has an excellent little spa offering a full range 
of spa treatments and services, including regular classes and activities. They even have 
a 9-hole executive golf course and driving range. Prices run from $300 for doubles, $420 
to $480 for suites, and $625 to $920 for villa rooms. Room and suite rates include 
breakfast.
Although you can drive here from San José or Liberia, I highly recommend flying. The 
flight takes about 55 minutes, and both Nature Air (% 800-235-9272 in the U.S. and 
Canada, 2299-6000 in Costa Rica; www.natureair.com) and Sansa (% 877-767-
2672 in the U.S. and Canada, 2290-4100 in Costa Rica; www.flysansa.com) fly here, 
as do several charter companies. Nature Air leaves out of the Pavas airport; Sansa 
leaves out of Juan Santamaría International. Charter companies work out of 
both. Because Punta Islita is such a luxury resort, with its own little airstrip, letting them 
book the travel and add it onto your bill is best. Rates run from $115 to $130 per person 
each way.

Part VII: Touring the Rest of Costa Rica 
292
This place is one of Costa Rica’s most rapidly developing hot spots, and 
hotels and restaurants are opening up at a steady pace. Still, it will take 
some time before this area becomes overly crowded. What you’ll find in 
Malpaís and Santa Teresa today is a scattering of beach hotels and 
simple restaurants, miles of nearly deserted beach, and easy access to 
some lush jungle and a host of adventure-tour options.
Getting there
Flying to Tambor and taking a taxi to Malpaís or Santa Teresa is the fast-
est and easiest way to travel out here. Taking a car or bus, however, 
includes a pretty and relaxing ferry ride across the Golfo de Nicoya.
By air
The nearest airport is in Tambor, 17km (11 miles) away. Sansa 
(% 877-767-2672 in the U.S. and Canada, 2290-4100 in Costa Rica; 
www.flysansa.com) and Nature Air (% 800-235-9272 in the U.S. and 
Canada, 2299-6000 in Costa Rica; www.natureair.com) both have a 
couple of daily flights to Tambor. Flight duration is about 30 minutes, 
and fares run $94 to $99 each way.
Some of the hotels listed here may be willing to pick you up in Tambor 
for a reasonable fee. If not, you’ll have to hire a taxi, which could cost 
anywhere from $40 to $45. Taxis are generally waiting to meet most reg-
ularly scheduled planes, but if you can’t find one, you can call Gilberto 
(% 2642-0241) or Ronald (% 8822-0610) for a ride.
By car and ferry
Follow the directions earlier in this chapter to Montezuma. At Cóbano, 
follow the signs to Malpaís and Playa Santa Teresa. It’s another 12km (71⁄2 
miles) or so down a very rough dirt road that pretty much requires four-
wheel-drive and is sometimes (although rarely) impassable during the 
rainy season.
By bus and ferry
Follow the directions earlier in this chapter for getting to Montezuma, 
but get off the Montezuma bus in Cóbano. From Cóbano, there are buses 
daily for Malpaís and Santa Teresa at 10:30 a.m. and 2:30 p.m.; the fare is 
$1.50. Buses return daily to Cóbano at 7 a.m., 11:30 a.m., and 3:30 p.m.
 
 These bus schedules are subject to change according to demand, 
road conditions, and the whims of the bus company. Moreover, as the 
popularity of this destination grows, more buses are occasionally added, 
so checking with your hotel in advance is a good idea.
If you miss the bus connection, you can hire a cab in Cóbano for 
around $20.

Orienting yourself in Malpaís and Santa Teresa
Malpaís and Santa Teresa are two tiny beach villages. In fact, there are 
no real towns here — just a string of hotels, restaurants, and assorted 
shops spread along a rough, coastal, dirt road.
As you reach the ocean, the road forks; Malpaís is to your left, Playa 
Carmen is straight ahead, and Santa Teresa is to your right. If you con-
tinue beyond Santa Teresa, you’ll come to the even more deserted 
beaches of Playa Hermosa and Manzanillo (not to be confused with 
beaches of the same names to be found elsewhere in the country).
Getting around and getting information
This is an area where it’s a good idea to have a rental car. Alamo 
(% 2640-0526) and Budget Rent A Car (% 2640-0418) both have 
offices in Malpais.
Another good option is to rent an ATV. Several hotels and a few shops 
in the area will rent a rugged ATV for around $45 to $70 per day. If 
you need a taxi, call Miguel (% 8819-9021 or 2640-0261) or Richard 
(% 8317-7614 or 2640-0003).
Your best bet for information out this way will definitely be your hotel 
front-desk staff.
Spending the night
 
 Flor Blanca Resort
$$$$$ Playa Santa Teresa
This resort hotel is, hands down, the most luxurious option in this neck of 
the woods and one of the top hotels in the country. The individual villas 
are huge, with a vast central living area opening onto a spacious veranda. 
The furnishings, decorations, and architecture boast a mix of Latin 
American and Asian influences, with some African adornments thrown 
in for good measure. Most overlook the lush gardens here, and about 
half have views through these gardens to the sea. The beachfront villas 
are the best.
Every villa features a large open-air bathroom with a garden shower and 
teardrop-shaped tub set amid flowering tropical foliage. You can opt for 
either a one-bedroom villa with a four-poster king-size bed in the main 
bedroom or a two-bedroom/two-bathroom villa better suited to families, 
with two twin beds in a separate upstairs bedroom. You’ll find several 
examples of the resort’s namesake tree planted around the grounds.
The restaurant, Nectar, features wonderfully prepared creative fusion 
cuisine (see listing later in this chapter). There’s a full-size and active 
dojo on grounds, where yoga, kickboxing, and cardio workout classes are 

 Chapter 19: Seeking Solitude in Southern Nicoya 295
regularly offered. The beautiful free-form pool is on two levels, with a 
sculpted waterfall connecting them and a shady, Indonesian-style gazebo 
off to one side for lounging around in.

Mal País Surf Camp & Resort
$–$$ Malpaís
Whether you’re a wannabe or an experienced wave rider, this is the place 
to hang out when you’re not hanging ten in Malpaís. You’ll find a wide 
range of accommodations here, reflected in the equally wide range of 
prices. The most basic rooms are open-air ranchos with gravel floors, 
lathe-and-bamboo walls, bead curtains for doors, and shared bathrooms. 
From here, your options get progressively more comfortable, ranging 
from shared-bathroom bunk-bed rooms to new, deluxe, poolside villas to 
private houses with all the amenities. You can also pitch a tent.
A delightful, free-form tile pool is in the center of the complex, and the 
large, open main lodge area serves as a combination restaurant/bar/
lounge and surfboard storage area. There’s satellite TV with surf videos 
playing most of the day, as well as pool, Ping-Pong, and foosball tables. 
The overall vibe here is loose and funky, as it should be. The restaurant 
serves filling, fresh, and, at times, quite creative cuisine, depending on 
how accomplished the itinerant surf-chef-of-the-month is. Surf rentals, les-
sons, and video sessions are all available.

is spread around shady grounds fronting the beach, just next door to Flor 
Blanca. The bungalows are simple, roomy, and understated. All have 
wooden floors, a mix of teak and bamboo furniture, beds with mosquito 
netting, and private porches. An overhead fan keeps things cool, and there 
are plenty of windows for cross ventilation. The more expensive units are 
closest to the beach and have ocean views. All come with free Wi-Fi. 
There’s a midsize pool here for when the surf is too rough, as well as an 
elegant little restaurant.

Trópico Latino Lodge
$$–$$$ Playa Santa Teresa
One of the first hotels out here, this small beachfront resort has aged well 
and is an excellent option. The best accommodations here are the newer 
private bungalows, which have artistic tile work and décor touches, as 
well as ocean views. The original rooms here are housed in four duplex 
units. These are huge — the king-size bamboo bed barely makes a dent in 
the floor space. There’s also a separate sofa bed, as well as a small desk, 
a wall unit of shelves, and closet space galore. Although none of the older 
rooms has any ocean view to speak of, each has a private patio with a 
hammock. The shady grounds are rich in the native pochote tree, which is 
known for its spiky trunk. The small restaurant here has excellent fresh 
fish and plenty of pasta dishes.

$$$–$$$$ At Flor Blanca Resort FUSION
The dimly lit, open-air setting of this poolside and beachfront restaurant 
is elegant yet casual. There’s a Pacific Rim influence to the fusion cuisine 
served up here. The menu changes regularly. If you’re lucky, you can start 
things off with a sashimi platter that mixes fresh tuna with thinly sliced 
beef carpaccio — it’s exquisite. In addition to fresh seafood and several 
vegetarian entrees, you may also find lamb, rabbit, or duck for offer on any 
given night. The creativity, service, and presentation are some of the best 
you’ll find in Costa Rica.

 Soda Piedra Mar
$ Malpaís SEAFOOD/COSTA RICAN
This simple, open-air restaurant is set on a rocky outcropping just steps 
away from the sea. The place is little more than a zinc-roofed shack that 
seems as if a stiff breeze would quickly level it. There are only a few tables 
here under the low roof. Weather permitting, more tables are set in the 
sand under the sun or stars. The fare is simple, but the fish is guaranteed 
fresh, the portions are hearty, the lobster is very reasonably priced, and 
the setting and sunsets are wonderful.

Exploring Malpaís and Santa Teresa
There are no major attractions in this area, but there are plenty of activi-
ties and adventures to be had. Join the surfer dudes and catch some 
waves, or take a hike or horseback ride on solid land. You’ll find infor-
mation and details about the area’s most popular options in this section.
The top attraction
 
 Malpaís surfing
Surfing is the main draw in this area. The long beaches of Malpaís, Playa 
Carmen, and Playa Santa Teresa offer up a steady stream of beach breaks, 
with enough peaks and points so that it’s almost never crowded. If 
you want to rent a board or take a lesson, check out the Malpaís Surf Shop 
(% 2640-0173).
There are rideable waves all along the length of the beaches here, but I like Malpaís 
best. Open: Daily 24 hours, but I don’t recommend surfing at night.
More cool things to see and do
 
✓ Embarking on a canopy tour: Canopy del Pacífico (% 2640-0091) 
is located toward the southern end of Malpaís and inland. A two-
hour tour over the nearly 1km (1⁄2 mile) of cables touches down on 
eight platforms, features two rappels, and offers good views of both 
the forest and the ocean below. The cost is $35.
 
✓ Horseback riding and mountain biking: The hills, fields, and for-
ests of this area are perfect for exploring on horseback or riding a 
mountain bike. Any of the hotels in the area can hook you up with a 
horseback-riding tour for around $10 to $15 per hour.
Living it up after dark in Malpaís and Santa Teresa
There’s not much in the way of raging nightlife here. Some folks make 
the long and arduous journey over to Montezuma. The most popular bar 
in the area is D&N (% 2640-0353), which stands for Day & Night, and 
is located about 1 block north of the crossroads into town, off the main 
road. Surfers and other travelers also tend to gather in the evenings 
at Frank’s Place (% 2640-0096) and the Malpaís Surf Camp (% 2640-
0031). Out in Santa Teresa, La Lora (% 2640-0132) is the most happen-
ing spot. This is definitely the place to come on Saturday night, to dance 
some salsa and merengue with the locals.

Costa Rica

▶ Getting to and around Costa Rica’s remote southern zone
▶ Hiking and camping in Corcovado National Park
▶ Kayaking with dolphins on the Golfo Dulce
▶ Visiting a couple of bountiful botanical gardens
C
osta Rica’s southern zone is a place of rugged beauty, with vast 
expanses of virgin lowland rain forest and few cities or settlements. 
Lushly forested mountains tumble into the sea, streams run clear and 
clean, scarlet macaws squawk raucously in the treetops, and dolphins 
frolic in the Golfo Dulce. This is the place to come for an authentic taste 
of the tropical rain forest.
This region is home to Corcovado National Park, the largest single 
expanse of lowland tropical rain forest in Central America, and its sister, 
Piedras Blancas National Park. Scattered around the edges of these 
national parks, on the Osa Peninsula and along the shores of the Golfo 
Dulce, are some of the country’s finest nature lodges. These lodges, in 
general, offer comfortable to quite luxurious accommodations, attentive 
service, knowledgeable guides, and a wide range of activities and tours, 
all close to the area’s many natural wonders.
 
 This area’s beauty doesn’t come easy. In many ways, this is Costa Rica’s 
final frontier. The small cities of Golfito and Puerto Jiménez are nearly as 
wild as the jungles that surround them. Moreover, the heat and humidity 
are more than many can stand. Some parts of the southern zone receive 
more than 635cm (250 in.) of rain per year. In addition to producing lush 
forests, this massive amount of rain produces more than a few disgrun-
tled travelers.
Although most of the lodges listed in this chapter are quite cozy, and 
some are even spectacular, none of these nature lodges has an in-room 
television, telephone, or air-conditioning. Although this region is noted 
for its hot and steamy weather, most of these nature lodges are built 
with cool tile or wood floors and plenty of shade and ventilation. I never 

Part VII: Touring the Rest of Costa Rica

find it uncomfortable, and hoards of satisfied visitors seem to agree. 
However, if you’re particularly sensitive to the heat, or particularly fond 
of air-conditioning, be sure to book a hotel with in-room A/C.
 
 A flashlight and rain gear are always useful to have on hand in Costa 
Rica; they’re absolutely essential in Drake Bay.
Drake Bay
Located on the northern end of the Osa Peninsula, Drake Bay is named 
after Sir Francis Drake, who is believed to have anchored here in 1579. 
Emptying into the bay is the tiny Agujitas River, which acts as a pro-
tected harbor for small boats and is a great place to do a bit of kayaking 
or swimming.
Stretching south from Drake Bay are miles of primary rain forest and 
deserted beaches, featuring a spread-out collection of isolated lodges 
catering to naturalists, anglers, scuba divers, and adventure travelers.
Adventurous explorers will find tide pools, spring-fed rivers, waterfalls, 
forest trails, and some of the best bird-watching in all of Costa Rica. If a 
paradise such as this appeals to you, Drake Bay makes a good base for 
exploring the southern zone.
Getting there
Flying directly into the small airstrip in Drake Bay is the preferred means 
of travel to this remote region. However, you can also get here via a 
combination of bus, taxi, and boat. I provide detailed information on 
both of these options in the following sections.
By air
Most visitors fly directly into the little airstrip at Drake Bay, although 
when demand is high, some are still routed through Palmar Sur. Most 
lodges in this area include transportation in their packages, so check 
with them before you book. Sansa (% 877-767-2672 in the U.S. and 
Canada, 2290-4100 in Costa Rica; www.flysansa.com) and Nature Air 
(% 800-235-9272 in the U.S. and Canada, 2299-6000 in Costa Rica; www.
natureair.com) both have regular flights to Drake Bay and Palmar Sur.
 
 If your travels take you to Drake Bay via Palmar Sur, you must then take 
a 15-minute bus or taxi ride over dirt roads to the small town of Sierpe. 
This bumpy ride takes you through several banana plantations and 
quickly past some important archaeological sites. In Sierpe, you board a 
small boat for a 40km (25-mile) ride to Drake Bay. The first half of this 
trip snakes through a maze of mangrove canals and rivers before head-
ing out to sea for the final leg to the bay. Entering and exiting the Sierpe 
River mouth is often treacherous, and I’ve had several very white-
knuckle moments here.

 Chapter 20: Exploring Southern Costa Rica 301
 
 Whichever route you take, have your hotel or lodge arrange final trans-
portation details from the airport to its site.
By bus, taxi, and boat
I recommend arranging your transportation in advance, but if you’re really 
intrepid, you can get to Drake Bay on your own by bus, taxi, and boat.
Tracopa (% 2221-4214 or 2258-8939) buses leave San José for Palmar 
Norte regularly throughout the day between 5 a.m. and 4 p.m. The ride 
takes six hours. You can also catch any Golfito-bound bus from this 
same station and get off in Palmar Norte. When you’re in Palmar Norte, 
ask when the next bus goes out to Sierpe. If it doesn’t leave for a while 
(buses aren’t frequent), consider taking a taxi.
When you arrive at the Palmar Norte bus station, you’ll need to take a 
taxi to the village of Sierpe. The fare should be around $20. When you 
get to Sierpe, head to the dock, and try to find space on a boat. This 
should run you another $20 to $40. If you don’t arrive early enough, you 
might have to hire an entire boat, which usually runs around $90 to $150 
for a boat that can carry up to six passengers. Make sure that you feel 
confident about the boat and the skipper, and, if possible, try to find a 
spot on a boat from one of the established lodges in Drake Bay.
Orienting yourself in Drake Bay
Until 1997, there was no road into Drake Bay and no airstrip in town. Now 
that both exist, their effects are palpable. The town is growing and chang-
ing at a rapid pace. Legal and clandestine logging is taking place all along 
the road into Drake Bay and around — and even in — the national park.
Still, because of the bay’s remoteness, major development is probably a 
long way off here. The tiny town itself still has just one dirt road running 
parallel to the beach along the crescent-shaped namesake bay. Only one 
lodge listed here is actually in the town of Drake Bay, the rest are across 
the Río Agujitas or farther south along the coast.
Spending the night
Casa Corcovado Jungle Lodge
$$$$–$$$$$ Osa Peninsula
This isolated lodge is the closest accommodation to Corcovado National 
Park from the Drake Bay side of the Osa Peninsula. The rooms are all pri-
vate bungalows built on the grounds of an old cacao plantation on the 
jungle’s edge. The bungalows are all pretty big, with one or two double 
beds and large tiled bathrooms. Electricity and hot water are supplied by 
a combination solar and hydroelectric energy system. Family-style meals 
are served in the main lodge, although most guests take lunch with them 
to the beach or on one of the various tours available. Late afternoons are 
usually enjoyed from a high point overlooking the sea and sunset, with 
your beverage of choice in hand. Access is strictly by small boat here, and

sometimes the beach landing can be a bit rough, so it’s recommended that 
guests be in decent physical shape. When the sea is not too rough, the 
beach is great for swimming; when the sea is rough, the beach is a great 
place to grab a hammock in the shade and read a book. There are two 
pools here, and a wide range of tours and activities are offered.

they’re clean and cozy, with ceiling fans, small verandas, and good mat-
tresses on the beds. The best room is the deluxe honeymoon suite, set on 
a little hill toward the rear of the property, with a great view of the bay. 
Budget hounds should check out the five cabins that share bathroom and 
shower facilities. The family-style meals are filling, with an emphasis on 
fresh seafood and fresh fruits. My favorite treats here are the freshly 
baked chocolate-chip cookies frequently served for dessert. Because it’s 
on a rocky spit, there isn’t a good swimming beach on-site (it’s about a 
15-minute walk away), but there’s a saltwater swimming pool in front of 
the bay, and, depending on the tide, you can bathe in a beautiful small tide 
pool formed by the rocks. The resort offers free Wi-Fi, and a wide range of 
tour options.

Hotel Jinetes de Osa

Once a budget cabinas option, this place has been spruced up, expanded, 
and turned into a very comfortable option for serious scuba divers and 
adventure tourists. Although it’s now far from a budget lodging, it does 
offer a reasonable alternative to the more upscale lodges in the area. The 
wooden construction, attention to detail, free Wi-Fi, and location directly 
above the beach give Jinetes an edge over other hotels right in the village 
of Drake Bay. The best rooms here are quite plush and even have a view 
of the bay. The hotel is pretty close to the docks on the Río Agujitas, 
which is a plus for those traveling independently or with heavy bags. A 
wide range of tours and activities is available, as are dive packages, weekly 
packages, and Professional Association of Diving Instructors (PADI) certi-

 La Paloma Lodge
$$$$–$$$$$ Drake Bay
Set on a steep hill overlooking the Pacific, with Caño Island in the distance, 
the bungalows at La Paloma offer expansive ocean views that, combined 
with the attentive and amiable service, make this my top choice in Drake 
Bay. All the cabins are spacious and private and are set among lush foliage 
facing the Pacific. All come with a large balcony or veranda. The large two-
story Sunset Ranchos are the choice rooms here: Sliding screen windows 
and doors keep you in touch with nature and let the ocean breezes blow 
through, and the views are to die for. The other cabins are a tad smaller 
but feature luxurious bathrooms and pretty good ocean views as well. The

standard rooms, which are located in a row in one long building, are 
smaller and less private than the cabins, but they’re still quite attractive 
and have good views from their verandas (which, like the cabins, have 
hammocks). 
The main lodge building is a large, open-air structure with a long veranda 
that has a sitting area and swing chairs, where you can mingle with other 
guests, or check e-mail on your laptop. The beach is about a seven-minute 
hike down a winding jungle path, but the swimming pool is located close 
to all the action and, like everything else here, is set on the edge of the 
hillside, with great ocean and jungle views. There are single and double 
kayaks, as well as boogie boards and surfboards free for guests to use. 
The lodge also offers scuba certification courses.

the hotels in the area arrange tours to these attractions.
The top attractions
Caño Island
One of the most popular excursions from Drake Bay is a trip out to Caño 
Island and the Caño Island Biological Reserve. The island was once home 
to a pre-Columbian culture about which little is known. A trip to the island 
includes a short hike to an ancient cemetery, where you’ll also be able to 
see some of the stone spheres that are commonly believed to have been 
carved by the people who once lived in this area (see “Those mysterious 
stone spheres,” in this chapter). Few animals or birds live on the island, 

 Chapter 20: Exploring Southern Costa Rica 305
but the beach here is gorgeous, and the coral reefs just offshore teem with 
life. This is one of Costa Rica’s prime scuba spots. Visibility is often quite 
good, and there’s even easily accessible snorkeling right from the beach. 
It’s about a 40-minute boat ride to the island. Trips here usually include a 
picnic lunch on the beach. All the lodges listed earlier in this chapter offer 
tours to Caño Island.
See map p. 302. 19km (12 miles) offshore from Drake Bay. Admission: $10 park 
entrance fee, usually included in the tour price. Open: Daily 8 a.m.–4 p.m.
Those mysterious stone spheres
Although Costa Rica lacks the great cities, giant temples, and bas-relief carvings of the 
Maya, Aztec, and Olmec civilizations of northern Mesoamerica, its pre-Columbian resi-
dents did leave a unique legacy that continues to cause archaeologists and anthropolo-
gists to scratch their heads and wonder. Over a period of several centuries, hundreds 
of painstakingly carved and carefully positioned granite spheres were left by the peo-
ples who lived throughout the Diquis Delta, in southern Costa Rica. The orbs, which 
range from grapefruit size to more than 2m (61⁄2 ft.) in diameter, can weigh up to 15 tons, 
and many reach near-spherical perfection.
Archaeologists believe that the spheres were created during two defined cultural peri-
ods. The first, called the Aguas Buenas period, dates from around A.D. 100 to A.D. 500. 
Few spheres survive from this time. The second phase, during which spheres were 
created in apparently greater numbers, is called the Chiriquí period and lasted from 
approximately A.D. 800 to A.D. 1500. The “balls” believed to have been carved during this 
time frame are widely dispersed along the entire length of the lower section of the 
Terraba River. To date, only one known quarry for the spheres has been discovered, in 
the mountains above the Diquis Delta, which points to a difficult and lengthy transporta-
tion process.
Some archaeologists believe that the spheres were hand-carved in a very time-
consuming process, using stone tools, perhaps aided by some sort of firing process. 
However, another theory holds that granite blocks were placed at the bases of powerful 
waterfalls, and the hydraulic beating of the water eventually turned and carved the rock 
into these near-perfect spheres. And more than a few proponents have credited extra-
terrestrial intervention for the creation of the stone balls.
Most of the stone balls have been found at the archaeological remains of defined settle-
ments and are associated with either central plazas or known burial sites. Their size 
and placement have been interpreted to have both social and celestial importance, 
although their exact significance remains a mystery. Unfortunately, many of the stone 
balls have been plundered and are currently used as lawn ornaments in the fancier 
neighborhoods of San José. Some have even been shipped out of the country. The 
Museo Nacional de Costa Rica (Chapter 12) has a nice collection, including one mas-
sive sphere in its center courtyard. It’s a never-fail photo-op. You can also see the stone 
balls near the small airports in Palmar Sur and Drake Bay, and on Caño Island (which 
is located 19km/12 miles off the Pacific coast near Drake Bay).

Part VII: Touring the Rest of Costa Rica

Corcovado National Park
Corcovado National Park is a main attraction in this area. All the lodges in 
Drake Bay offer day trips and hikes into Corcovado National Park at the 
San Pedrillo entrance. The trails here are wonderful. One leads to a beauti-
ful jungle waterfall, where you can take a refreshing dip.
 
 If you want to spend a lot of time hiking and camping in Corcovado 
National Park, Puerto Jiménez is your best base and jumping-off point. 
(See the Puerto Jiménez section later in this chapter for a much more 
detailed description of exploring Corcovado National Park.)
See map p. 302. The San Pedrillo entrance to the park is located approximately 15km 
(91⁄3 miles) south of Drake Bay. Admission: $10, usually included in the tour price. 
Open: Daily 8 a.m.–4 p.m.
More cool things to see and do
In addition to trips to Caño Island and Corcovado National Park, all the 
lodges in the area offer a host of half-day and full-day tours and activi-
ties, including horseback rides, scuba-diving, and sportfishing. In some 
cases, tours are included in your room rate or package; in others, they 
must be bought a la carte. Other options include mountain-biking and 
sea-kayaking. Most of these tours run between $60 and $120, depending 
on the activity, with scuba-diving ($90–$125 for a 2-tank dive) and sport-
fishing ($450–$1,500, depending on the size of the boat and other ameni-
ties) costing a bit more.
Although the beach fronting Drake Bay itself is acceptable and calm for 
swimming, it’s far from spectacular. The most popular swimming beach 
is a pretty small patch of sand about a seven-minute hike beyond and 
down from La Paloma Lodge. The nicest beaches around involve taking 
a day trip to either Caño Island or San Josesito, a beautiful beach farther 
south on the peninsula with excellent snorkeling possibilities.
Living it up after dark in Drake Bay
 
 Aside from one weekend disco in the center of town and the small bars at 
the individual lodges, there is virtually no nightlife in Drake Bay. That is, 
unless you opt to take the two-hour Night Tour (% 8382-1619; www.the
nighttour.com; $35 per person) offered by Tracie Stice. Tracie is affec-
tionately known as “The Bug Lady.” Equipped with flashlights and night-
vision glasses, participants get a bug’s-eye view of the forest at night 
(arachnophobes should stay away). You may see the reflection of some 
larger forest dweller, but most of the tour is a fascinating exploration of 
the nocturnal insect world. Consider yourself lucky if Tracie finds the 
burrow of a trap-door spider or large tarantula.
Puerto Jiménez and the Osa Peninsula
Despite its small size and languid pace, Puerto Jiménez is a bustling little 
burg, where rough jungle gold-panners mix with wealthy ecotourists, 

 Chapter 20: Exploring Southern Costa Rica 307
budget backpackers, and a surprising number of celebrities seeking a 
small dose of anonymity and escape. Located on the southeastern tip 
of the Osa Peninsula, the town itself is just a couple of gravel streets 
with the ubiquitous fútbol (soccer) field, a block of general stores, 
some inexpensive sodas (diner-style restaurants), a butcher shop, and 
several bars. Scarlet macaws fly overhead, and mealy parrots provide 
wake-up calls.
Puerto Jiménez is Costa Rica’s principal gateway to Corcovado National 
Park. The national park has its headquarters here, and this town makes 
an excellent base for exploring this vast wilderness. Although the in-
town accommodations are decidedly budget-oriented, you’ll find several 
far-more-luxurious places farther south on the Osa Peninsula.
Getting there
Flying into Puerto Jiménez is the best way to visit this remote region. 
However, you can get here by car or bus, although both are very long 
rides. You’ll find more information on all these options in the following 
sections.
By air
Sansa (% 877-767-2672 in the U.S. and Canada, 2290-4100 in Costa Rica; 
www.flysansa.com) and Nature Air (% 800-235-9272 in the U.S. and 
Canada, 2299-6000 in Costa Rica; www.natureair.com) both have a few 
daily flights to Puerto Jiménez from San José. On both airlines, picking 
up the flight in Quepos and Manuel Antonio, with advance notice, is also 
often possible.
 
 Note that due to the remoteness of this area and the unpredictable flux 
of traffic, both Sansa and Nature Air frequently improvise on scheduling. 
Sometimes this means an unscheduled stop in Quepos or Golfito on the 
way down from or back to San José, which can add some time to your 
flight. Less frequently, it may mean a change in departure time, so con-
firming the time is always best. Also, lodges down here sometimes run 
charters, so asking them is a good idea.
By car
Take the Interamerican Highway east out of San José (through San Pedro 
and Cartago) and continue south on this road. In about three hours, 
you’ll reach San Isidro de El General. Although you can continue on the 
Interamerican Highway all the way south, it is currently faster, smoother, 
and safer to turn off in San Isidro and head to Dominical, picking up the 
Southern Highway or Costanera Sur in Dominical. From here, it’s a fast 
and smooth shot down Palmar Norte, where you meet up again with the 
Interamerican Highway. Take the turnoff for La Palma, Rincón, and 
Puerto Jiménez. This road is paved at first, but at Rincón it turns to 
gravel. The last 35km (22 miles) are slow and rough, and, during the 
rainy season (mid-Apr to Nov), it’s too muddy for anything but a four-
wheel-drive vehicle.

Part VII: Touring the Rest of Costa Rica 
308
By bus
Transportes Blanco-Lobo express buses (% 2257-4121 in San José, 
2771-4744 in Puerto Jiménez) leave San José daily at noon from Calle 12, 
between avenidas 7 and 9. The trip takes eight hours; the fare is $7.50. 
The return bus departs Puerto Jiménez for San José daily at 5 a.m.
Orienting yourself in Puerto Jiménez 
and the Osa Peninsula
Puerto Jiménez is a dirt-lane town on the southern coast of the Osa 
Peninsula. Actually, a small section of the main road through town is 
paved for several blocks. The public dock is over a bridge past the north 
end of the fútbol field; the bus stop is 2 blocks east of the center of town. 
The airstrip runs north–south along the western edge of town.
From Puerto Jiménez, a rough dirt road runs out to Carate, where the 
road ends and Corcovado National Park begins. This road fords several 
rivers, which can sometimes be impassable for most vehicles during the 
rainy season.
Getting around and getting information
You can easily walk anywhere in Puerto Jiménez. Rugged four-wheel-
drive taxis are available for trips out to Carate, Corcovado National Park, 
and the isolated lodges listed later in this chapter.
To travel out to Carate by “public transportation,” pick up one of the 
collective taxis (actually, a four-wheel-drive pickup truck with a tarpau-
lin cover and slat seats in the back) that leave Puerto Jiménez daily at 6 
a.m. and 1:30 p.m., returning at 8 a.m. and 4 p.m. Remember: These taxis 
are very informal and change their schedules regularly to meet demand 
or avoid bad weather, so always ask in town. The one-way fare is around 
$8. A small fleet of these pickups leaves from just south of the bus termi-
nal and will stop to pick up anyone who flags them down along the way. 
Your other option is to hire an entire pickup truck; it costs approxi-
mately $70 to $90 each way to Carate, although the taxi can hold as 
many as ten people.
Several speedboats work as boat taxis between Puerto Jiménez and 
Golfito. The fare is $5, and the ride takes a little under 30 minutes. These 
boats leave five or six times throughout the day, or whenever they fill 
up, beginning at around 5 a.m. and finishing up at around 5 p.m. Ask 
around town, or at the docks for current schedules.
There is also a daily passenger launch service from Puerto Jiménez to 
Golfito from the public dock at 6 a.m. Much slower, this trip takes one 
and a half hours; the fare is $3. The return trip departs at 11:30 a.m. from 
Golfito’s municipal dock.

 Chapter 20: Exploring Southern Costa Rica 309
You can also charter a water taxi for the trip across the Golfo Dulce to 
Golfito. You’ll have to pay $40 to $80 for an entire launch, some of which 
can carry up to 12 people.
If you can’t get to your next destination by boat, bus, taxi, commuter 
airline, or car, Alfa Romeo Aero Taxi (% 2735-5353 or 2735-5112; www.
alfaromeoair.com) runs airline charters to most of the nearby desti-
nations, including Carate, Drake Bay, Sirena, and Golfito. A five-passen-
ger plane costs $200 to $400 one-way, depending on your destination.
The Corcovado National Park office (% 2735-5036; Fax: 2735-5276; 
E-mail: pncorcovado@hotmail.com) is in town here, across from the 
airstrip. This stop is necessary if you’re thinking of camping in the park, 
and it’s a good place to get general info on the park and the area.

A couple of Internet cafes are in town. The best of these is Cafe Net El 
Sol (% 2735-5719; www.soldeosa.com), which is a great place to book 
tours and get information; the cafe is also a Wi-Fi hotspot.
Spending the night
 
 Bosque del Cabo Rainforest Lodge
$$$$$ Osa Peninsula
This secluded jungle lodge is a real charmer. The cabins are all spacious 
and attractively furnished, with wooden decks or verandas to catch the 
ocean views, and are set amid beautiful gardens. Bosque del Cabo is 
located 150m (492 ft.) above the water at the southern tip of the Osa 
Peninsula, where the Golfo Dulce meets the Pacific Ocean. The deluxe 
cabins come with king-size beds and slightly larger deck space. The Congo 
cabin is my choice for its spectacular view of the sunrise from your bed. 
All the cabins have indoor bathrooms, although most have tiled showers 
set outdoors amid flowering heliconia and ginger. A few also have outdoor 
garden tubs.
There’s a trail down to a secluded beach that has some tide pools and 
ocean-carved caves. Another trail leads to a jungle waterfall, and several 
others wind through the rain forests of the lodge’s 243 hectares (600-plus-
acre) private reserve. The wildlife viewing here is excellent. If you’re too 
lazy to hike down to the beach, you can enjoy the very inviting pool by the 
main lodge. Surfing is a popular activity here, as are hiking and horseback 
riding. Attractions include a canopy platform 36m (118 ft.) up a Manu tree, 
reached along a 90m (295-ft.) zip line, as well as a bird- and wildlife-watching 
rancho set beside a little lake on the edge of the tropical gardens and sur-
rounded by forest. Trips to the national park or fishing excursions can be 
arranged, as can guided hikes, sea-kayaking, and a host of other activities 
and tours.
See map p. 310. Osa Peninsula. %/fax 2735-5206 or 8389-2846. www.bosquedel
cabo.com. Rack rates: $350–$390 double. Rates include 3 meals daily and taxes. 
$25 round-trip transportation from Puerto Jiménez. MC, V.
 
 Lapa Ríos
$$$$$ Osa Peninsula
This famous ecolodge consists of eight duplex buildings perched along a 
steep ridge. Each very large room is totally private and oriented toward 
the view. Walls have open screening, and the ceiling is a high-peaked, 
thatch roof. Mosquito nets drape languidly over the two queen-size beds. 
A large deck and small tropical garden, complete with a hammock and 
outdoor shower, more than double the living space of each room. There’s 
an indoor shower in the room, although this one features open screen 
walls facing the view, so it’s not all that different from being outdoors. It’s 
a bit of a hike back and forth from the main lodge to the rooms located 
farthest down the ridge.

Part VII: Touring the Rest of Costa Rica 
312
The centerpiece of the lodge’s large open-air dining room is a 15m (49-ft.) 
spiral staircase that leads to an observation deck tucked beneath the peak 
of the building’s thatched roof. Lapa Ríos is surrounded by its own 
400-hectare (988-acre) private rain-forest reserve, which is home to scar-
let macaws, toucans, parrots, hummingbirds, monkeys, and myriad other 
wildlife. However, keep in mind that there are no TVs, no telephones, no 
air-conditioning, no discos, no shopping, no paved roads, and no crowds.
Moreover, the beach is a good 15-minute hike away, and it’s not the best 
for swimming. In fact, other than a beautiful little pool, miles of hiking 
trails, an array of adventure tours and activities, and a quiet tropical bar, 
there is nothing around to distract your attention from the stupendous 
views of the rain forest all around and the ocean far below.
See map p. 310. Osa Peninsula. % 2735-5130. Fax: 2735-5179. www.laparios.

for children 10 and under; rates lower in the off season, higher during peak periods.

Juanitas Mexican Bar & Grille
$–$$ Puerto Jiménez MEXICAN
This place offers good, hearty, California-style Mexican food and fresh 
local seafood served up in a lively, convivial atmosphere. You can get 
fajitas with chicken, beef, fish, or even grilled vegetables. They also have 
pizza by the slice or whole pie, and they will deliver, though I’m not sure 
how far out the peninsula their drivers will go. There are nightly specials 
and a popular happy hour. You can either order breakfast a la carte or 
load up on the abundant breakfast buffet.

V. Open: Daily 10 a.m. to midnight.
Soda Carolina 
$ Puerto Jiménez COSTA RICAN
Set in the center of the town’s main street, and otherwise known as the 
“Bar, Restaurante y Cabinas Carolina,” this is the town’s main budget trav-
elers’ hangout and also serves as an unofficial information center. The 
walls are painted with colorful jungle and wildlife scenes. As for the fare, 
seafood is the way to go. There’s good fried fish as well as a variety of 
ceviches. The black-bean soup is usually tasty, and the casados (plates of 
the day) are filling and cost around $4.30.

courses: $3.50–$14. V. Open: Daily 7 a.m.–10 p.m.
Exploring Puerto Jiménez and the Osa Peninsula
The main attraction here is the massive and rugged Corcovado National 
Park. In this section, I offer detailed information on how to best visit and 

 Chapter 20: Exploring Southern Costa Rica 313
enjoy this park, as well as some suggestions for other activities and 
attractions around the region.
The top attractions
Corcovado National Park
Corcovado National Park is impressive. It is the single largest expanse of 
primary lowland tropical rain forest in Central America. Plus, it’s home to 
an amazing amount of tropical flora and fauna and provides one of the few 
suitable habitats in Costa Rica for maintaining a healthy jaguar 
population.
Exploring Corcovado National Park is not something to be undertaken 
lightly, but neither is it the prohibitively arduous expedition that some 
people make it out to be. The weather is the biggest obstacle to overnight 
backpacking trips through the park. The heat and humidity are often quite 
formidable, and frequent rainstorms can make the trails pretty muddy. If 
you hike along the beach, you’ll have to plan your hiking around the tides. 
Often, there is no beach at all at high tide, and some rivers are impassable 
at high tide.
Because of its size and remoteness, Corcovado National Park is best 
explored over several days; however, you can enter and hike a bit of it on 
a day trip. The best way to plan a trip to the park is to book a tour with 
your lodge.
The park has four primary entrances, which are really just ranger stations 
reached by rough dirt roads. When you’ve reached them, you’ll have to 
strap on a backpack and hike. Perhaps the easiest one to reach from 
Puerto Jiménez is La Leona ranger station, near Carate, which is acces-
sible by car, bus, taxi, or light aircraft. From Carate, it’s a 3km (13⁄4-mile) 
hike to La Leona.
You can also travel to El Tigre, about 14km (83⁄4 miles) by dirt road from 
Puerto Jiménez, where there’s another ranger station. But note that trails 
from El Tigre go only a short distance into the park.
The third entrance is in Los Patos, which is reached from the town of La 
Palma, northwest of Puerto Jiménez. From here, there’s a 19km (12-mile) 
trail through the center of the park to Sirena, a ranger station and research 
facility.
The northern entrance to the park is San Pedrillo, which you can reach 
by hiking from Sirena or by taking a boat from Drake Bay or Sierpe (see 
“Corcovado National Park” under “Drake Bay” earlier in this chapter). It’s 
14km (83⁄4 miles) from Drake Bay.
If you’re not into hiking in the heat, you can charter a plane in Puerto 
Jiménez to take you to Carate or Sirena. A five-passenger plane should 
cost around $200 to $400 one-way, depending on your destination. Contact 
Alfa Romeo Aero Taxi (% 2735-5353 or 2735-5112; www.alfaromeoair.
com) for details.

Part VII: Touring the Rest of Costa Rica 
314
Sirena is the park’s principal and most fascinating destination. As a 
research facility and ranger station, it’s frequented almost constantly by 
scientists. One of the longest hikes, from San Pedrillo to Sirena, can be 
done only during the dry season. Between any two stations, the hiking is 
arduous and takes all day, so it’s best to rest for a day or so between 
hikes, if possible.
 
 Remember: This area is quite wild. Unless you’re experienced, always 
hike with a guide. In addition, be especially careful about swimming in any 
isolated rivers or river mouths because most rivers in Corcovado are 
home to crocodiles.
 
 Reservations are essential at the various ranger stations if you plan to eat 
or sleep inside the park. Make your reservations by contacting the Park 
Service in Puerto Jiménez (% 2735-5036; Fax: 2735-5276; E-mail: 
pncorcovado@hotmail.com). Its offices are adjacent to the airstrip. 
Only a limited number of people are allowed to camp at each ranger sta-
tion, so make your reservations well in advance.

Sirena has a modern research facility with dormitory-style accommoda-
tions for 28 people, as well as a campground, soda, and landing strip for 
charter flights. You can also camp at the La Leona, Los Patos, and San 
Pedrillo ranger stations. Every ranger station has potable water, but I 
recommend packing your own supply; whatever you do, don’t drink 
stream water. Campsites in the park are $4 per person per night. A dorm 
bed at the Sirena station will run you $8 — you must bring your own 
sheets, and a mosquito net is highly recommended — and meals here are 
another $40 per day. Everything must be reserved in advance.

✓ Adventure tours: For a real adventure, check in with Psycho Tours 
(% 8353-8619; www.psychotours.com). These folks run a variety 
of adventure tours, but their signature combo trip features a free 
climb up (with a safety rope attached) the roots and trunks of a 
70m-tall (200-ft.) strangler fig. You can climb as high as your ability 
allows, but most people try to reach a natural platform at around 
18m (60 ft.), where you take a leap of faith into space and are 
belayed down by your guide. This is preceded by an informative 
hike through primary rain forest, often wading through a small 
river, and followed by a couple of rappels down jungle waterfalls, 
the highest of which is around 31m (100 ft.). The five- to six-hour 
tour costs $120.
 
✓ Botanical gardens: On the outskirts of Puerto Jimenez, you’ll find 
Herrera Botanical Gardens (% 2735-5210). The project here fea-
tures over 260 acres of botanical gardens, working permaculture 
gardens, and secondary forest. There are even a few platforms built 
high in the trees here and reached by climbing a ladder. A two-and-
a-half-hour guided tour of the gardens costs $15, although you can 
wander the gardens yourself, with a self-guiding map, for just $4.
 
 
✓ Kayaking: To arrange a kayaking trip around the estuary, up into 
the mangroves, or out into the gulf, contact Escondido Trex 
(% 2735-5210; www.escondidotrex.com). These folks have an 
office in the Soda Carolina in the center of town. Escondido Trex 
runs daily paddles through the mangroves, as well as sunset trips 
out on the gulf, where you can sometimes see dolphins. These folks 
also do guided rain-forest hikes and can have you rappelling down 
the face of a jungle waterfall. More-adventurous multiday kayak and 
camping trips are also available, in price and comfort ranges from 
budget to luxury (staying at various lodges around the Golfo Dulce 
and Matapalo). They’ll even take you gold panning (although there 
are no guarantees that your panning will pay for the trip).
 
✓ Shopping: Located right beside the airstrip in town, Jagua Arts & 
Craft Store (% 2735-5267) is one of the best gift shops in the coun-
try. Owner Karen Herrera has found excellent local and regional art 

Part VII: Touring the Rest of Costa Rica 
316
and craft works, including some superb jewelry and blown glass. 
This store is a great place to head before your departing flight out 
of Puerto Jimenez. But be sure to give yourself enough time, 
because they have a wonderful and somewhat extensive collection.
 
 
✓ Sportfishing: If you’re interested in doing some billfishing or deep-
sea fishing, you’ll probably want to stay at or fish with Crocodile 
Bay Lodge (% 800-733-1115 in the U.S. and Canada, 2735-5631 in 
Costa Rica; www.crocodilebay.com). This upscale fishing lodge 
is close to the Puerto Jiménez airstrip.
 
✓ Surfing: Although nearby Pavones gets all the international press 
and acclaim, three very dependable point breaks are located on the 
stretch of the Osa Peninsula between Puerto Jiménez and Carate. 
Matapalo, Pan Dulce, and Backwash are all well-formed right point 
breaks. These waves are excellent for learning on when they’re 
small. And when the waves are large, they’re long and clean. If you 
want to take lessons, contact Pollo’s Surf School (% 8366-6559; 
E-mail: rhoades_gretchen@hotmail.com).
Golfito and the Golfo Dulce
Golfito itself is not a very compelling destination for foreign travelers. 
Nevertheless, the city’s setting is quite pretty, and it serves as the gate-
way to some truly beautiful isolated lodges located on the shores of the 
Golfo Dulce, or “Sweet Gulf.”
Sportfishing cognoscenti know that Golfito’s real draw is the marlin and 
sailfish just beyond its bay. Arguably one of the best fishing spots in 
Costa Rica, it provides pleasant, uncrowded surroundings in which die-
hard sportfishers can indulge their greatest fantasies of landing the 
great one to end all great ones.
In its prime, Golfito was a major banana port, but United Fruit pulled out 
in 1985 following a few years of rising taxes, falling prices, and labor dis-
putes. Now Ticos come here in droves on weekends and throughout 
December to take advantage of cheap prices on name-brand goods and 
clothing sold in the duty-free zone, and sometimes all these shoppers 
make finding a room in town difficult.
In 1998, much of the rain forest bordering the Golfo Dulce was officially 
declared the Piedras Blancas National Park, which includes 12,000 hect-
ares (29,640 acres) of primary forests, as well as newly protected sec-
ondary forests and pasturelands.
Along the southern shores of the Golfo Dulce, accessible either by boat 
or car from Golfito, are the two tiny beach towns of Playa Zancudo and 
Pavones. The former is a laid-back tropical getaway and sportfishing 
center, while the latter is one of the prime surf spots on the planet.

 Chapter 20: Exploring Southern Costa Rica 317
Getting there
Flying is the fastest and easiest way to get to Golfito and the Golfo Dulce 
region. You can drive or take a bus, although in each of these cases, it’s 
a very long ride. You’ll find more information on all these options in the 
following sections.
By air
Sansa (% 877-767-2672 in the U.S. and Canada, 2290-4100 in Costa Rica; 
www.flysansa.com) and Nature Air (% 800-235-9272 in the U.S. and 
Canada, 2299-6000 in Costa Rica; www.natureair.com) both fly to 
Golfito from San José. Taxis meet all incoming flights and can take you 
into downtown or to the boat docks for under $2.
By car
Take the Interamerican Highway east out of San José (through San Pedro 
and Cartago) and continue south on this road. In about three hours, 
you’ll reach San Isidro de El General. Although you can continue on the 
Interamerican Highway all the way south, it’s currently faster, smoother, 
and safer to turn off in San Isidro and head to Dominical, picking up the 
Southern Highway or Costanera Sur in Dominical. From here, it’s a fast 
and smooth shot down Palmar Norte, where you meet up again with the 
Interamerican Highway. When you get to Río Claro, you’ll notice a couple 
of gas stations and quite a bit of activity. Turn right here and follow the 
signs to Golfito. If you end up at the Panama border, you’ve missed the 
turnoff by about 32km (20 miles). The drive takes about six hours.
If you’re heading to either Playa Zancudo or Pavones, you’ll see the turn-
off at El Rodeo, about 4km (21⁄2 miles) outside of Golfito, on the road in 
from the Interamerican Highway. About 20 minutes past the turnoff, 
you’ll have to wait and take a small diesel-operated crank ferry (fare is 
$1 per vehicle). The ferry generally operates from around 5 a.m. until 10 
p.m. However, the hours can be erratic. Moreover, at very low tides, the 
ferry can’t run, so sometimes you have to wait a couple hours. After the 
ferry, you should make a left at every major intersection; the road is 
fairly well marked. Follow the flow of traffic if there is any, or stick to the 
most well-worn route whenever in doubt, to reach either Playa Zancudo 
or Pavones. In each case, it takes about one hour when the road is in 
good condition and about two hours when it’s not.
 
 On most of the Interamerican Highway, you’ll have to contend with pot-
holes of sometimes gargantuan proportions. Just remember, if the road 
is suddenly smooth and in great shape, you can bet that around the next 
bend there will be a bottomless pothole that you can’t swerve around. 
Take it easy.
By bus
Tracopa express buses leave San José daily at 7 a.m. and 3:30 p.m. from 
the Tracopa station on the Plaza Viquez at Calle 5, between avenidas 18 

Part VII: Touring the Rest of Costa Rica 
318
and 20 (% 2221-4214). The trip takes seven and a half hours; the fare is 
$7.50. Buses depart Golfito for San José daily at 5 a.m. and 1:30 p.m. from 
the bus station near the municipal dock.
Orienting yourself in Golfito 
and along the Golfo Dulce
Golfito is set on the north side of the Golfo Dulce, at the foot of lush 
green mountains. The bomba (gas station) is the heart of Golfito, and 
just off this you’ll find the municipal dock and compact downtown 
section.
Farther in along the bay and slightly inland, you come to the old United 
Fruit Company housing, the duty-free zone, and Golfito’s small airstrip. 
In this area, you’ll find well-maintained wooden houses painted bright 
colors and surrounded by neatly manicured gardens.
However, most of the hotels and lodges listed here are located along the 
shores of the Golfo Dulce, either north of Golfito where the only access is 
by boat, or down south in the beach towns of Playa Zancudo and Pavones.
This area is isolated and remote; your best bet for information will 
invariably be the front desk at your hotel or lodge.
Getting around
With most of the lodges listed here, arranging transportation in advance 
is best. If you’re staying at one of the lodges accessible only by boat 
and you miss your connection, you can always hire a boat at the Golfito 
muellecito (public dock). Depending on which lodge you’re going to, the 
cost could range from $40 to $80.
There are a couple of daily buses to Playa Zancudo and Pavones leaving 
from in front of the gas station in downtown Golfito. Alternatively, taxis 
can be hired for around $40 to $60. There’s a steady supply of taxis con-
stantly cruising the one main road through town. Or you can call Taxi 
Golfito (% 2775-1170).
If you can’t get to your next destination by boat, bus, commuter airline, 
or car, Alfa Romeo Aero Taxi (% 2735-5353 or 2735-5112; www.alfa
romeoair.com) runs charters to most of the nearby destinations, 
including Carate, Drake Bay, Sirena, and Puerto Jiménez.
Spending the night
 
 Cabinas Los Cocos
$ Playa Zancudo
If you’ve ever pondered throwing it all away and setting up shop in a 
simple house by the beach, these fully-equipped cabins are a good place 

 Chapter 20: Exploring Southern Costa Rica 319
for a trial run. Set under the trees and only a few meters from the beach, 
the four cabins are quiet and semi-isolated from one another. Two of them 
served as banana-plantation housing in a former life, until they were sal-
vaged and moved here. These wood houses have big verandas and bed-
rooms and large, eat-in kitchens. Bathrooms are down a few steps in back 
and have hot water. The two newer cabins also offer plenty of space, small 
kitchenettes, and private verandas, as well as comfortable sleeping lofts. 
If you plan to stay in Zancudo for a while, this is a perennially good choice. 
The owners, Susan and Andrew Robertson, also run Zancudo Boat Tours, 
so if you want to do some exploring or need a ride into Golfito or Puerto 
Jiménez, they’re the folks to see.

 Cabinas Sol y Mar
$ Playa Zancudo
This friendly, owner-run establishment is one of the most popular lodg-
ings in Zancudo. There are two individual bungalows and two rooms in a 
duplex building with a shared veranda, but I prefer the individual rooms 
for their privacy. The bathrooms in these have unusual showers that fea-
ture a tiled platform set amid smooth river rocks. There’s also a small 
budget cabin that is quite a good deal, as well as a fully equipped house 
for longer stays. You can even camp here for a few bucks per night. All the 
options are just steps away from the sand. The hotel’s open-air restaurant 
is one of the best and most popular places to eat and drink in Zancudo, 
and there’s free Wi-Fi throughout the complex.

Casa Roland Marina Resort
$$$–$$$$ Golfito
This new mini-resort offers the best rooms in Golfito proper. Located in 
the old banana company housing area, near the airport and duty-free 
zone, this place is geared equally toward business travelers, vacationers, 
and sport fishermen. However, the hotel is several blocks from the water, 
so I find the use of marina in the name a bit misleading. Still, the rooms are 
large and well equipped, with interesting art works and comfortable, 
heavy wood furnishings. The standard or corporate rooms only come with 
ceiling fans, and in this climate, that’s a real handicap, so you’ll want to 
upgrade to a luxury room or suite, which have air-conditioning.

 Complejo Turístico Samoa del Sur
$ Golfito
If you have to spend the night in Golfito, this is a good choice. The hotel 
is well located right on the waterfront near the center of town. The rooms 
are spacious and clean. Varnished wood headboards complement two 
firm and comfortable double beds. With red-tile floors, modern bath-
rooms, and carved-wood doors, the rooms all share a long, covered 
veranda that’s set perpendicular to the gulf, so the views aren’t great. If 
you want to watch the water, you’re better off grabbing a table at the 
popular restaurant and bar here. The hotel’s amenities include a swim-
ming pool and volleyball court, as well as a small marina. If you’re driving 
down this way and heading to a lodge out on the Golfo Dulce, these folks 
will watch your car for around $10 per day.

 Playa Nicuesa Rainforest Lodge
$$$$ Golfo Dulce
Set on its own private bay, with a large stretch of black-sand beach, and 
accessible only by boat, this lodge is the most luxurious and impressive 
option on the shores of the Golfo Dulce. Although the four Mango Manor 
rooms are certainly very comfortable, you’ll definitely want to snag one of 
the four individual cabins. These are all set amidst dense forest and are 
made almost entirely of wood, with large open-air showers, private veran-
das, and a true sense of being in touch with nature. The huge main build-
ing is open aired with an abundance of varnished wood and a relaxed, 
inviting vibe that induces you to grab a book, play a board game, or chat 
with other guests. There’s an excellent network of trails on the lodge’s 66 
hectares (165 acres), and a host of tours and activities is offered. Guests 
have unlimited use of the lodge’s kayaks, windsurfers (also called sail-
boards), and snorkeling and fishing gear.

 Tiskita Jungle Lodge
$$$$ Pavones
This small ecolodge is nearly on the Panamanian border, with the beach 
on one side and rain-forest-clad hills behind. Originally an experimental 
fruit farm growing exotic tropical fruits from around the world, Tiskita has 
become a great place to get away from it all. The lodge itself is set on a hill 
a few hundred meters from the beach and commands a superb view of the 
ocean. There’s a dark-sand swimming beach, tide pools, jungle waterfalls, 
a farm and forest to explore, and great bird-watching — 285 species have 
been sighted. Of the 160 hectares (395 acres) here, 100 hectares (247 
acres) are in primary rain forest; the rest are in secondary forest, refores-
tation projects, orchards, and pastures.

 Chapter 20: Exploring Southern Costa Rica 321
Accommodations are in deluxe rustic cabins with screen walls and veran-
das. Constructed of local hardwoods, the cabins have a very tropical feel. 
If you’re a bird-watcher, you can just sit on the veranda and add to your 
life list. My favorite cabin is no. 6, which has a great view and large deck 
space. Some of the cabins have two or three rooms, making them great for 
families. Most of the bathrooms are actually outdoors, although they’re 
private and protected, allowing you to take in the sights and sounds as 
you shower and shave.
Meals are served family style in the open-air main lodge. Although they’re 
not fancy, they’re certainly tasty and filling, and you’ll be eating plenty of 
ingredients straight from the organic gardens.
The lodge is well over eight hours from San José by car, so most guests 
take advantage of the package tours, which include air transportation to 
Tiskita’s private landing strip. If you’ve already driven all the way to 
Pavones, Tiskita is only 6km (33⁄4 miles) farther down the road.

$$–$$$ Golfito INTERNATIONAL/SEAFOOD
This open-air restaurant attached to the Banana Bay Marina is easily the 
best restaurant in Golfito. The seafood is fresh and excellently prepared, 
but you can also get hearty steaks and great burgers. I personally recom-
mend the fresh fish burger. Grab a table toward the water and watch the 
boats bob up and down while you enjoy your meal.

Exploring Golfito and the Golfo Dulce
Most of the attractions and activities available in this region involve get-
ting on or in the waters of the Golfo Dulce. The exception to this rule is 
Wilson Botanical Gardens, which is located about an hour’s drive inland 
from Golfito. You’ll find detailed information about all the various attrac-
tions and activities in this section.
The top attractions
Casa Orquídeas
Casa Orquídeas is a private botanical garden lovingly built and maintained 
by Ron and Trudy MacAllister. The gardens, located on an isolated cove 
about 30 minutes by boat out of Golfito, feature a broad array of tropical 
flowers and trees. During the tour, you’ll sample a load of fresh fruits 
picked right off the trees.

Part VII: Touring the Rest of Costa Rica

Most hotels and lodges in the area offer trips here, including transporta-
tion and a two-hour tour of the gardens. If your hotel doesn’t offer a 
tour, you can book a trip out of Golfito with the folks at Land Sea Tours 
(% 2775-1614). The entrance and guided tour is only $5 per person, but 
it will cost you $50 to $60 to hire a boat for the round-trip ride.

1614. Admission: $5 per person. Tours: Sat–Thurs 8:30 a.m.
Wilson Botanical Gardens
If you have a really serious interest in botanical gardens or bird-watching, 
consider an excursion to Wilson Botanical Gardens at the Las Cruces 
Biological Station.
The gardens are owned and maintained by the Organization for Tropical 
Studies and include more than 7,000 species of tropical plants from 
around the world. Among the plants grown here are many endangered 
species, which make the gardens of interest to botanical researchers. 
Despite the scientific aspects of the gardens, there are so many beautiful 
and unusual flowers amid the manicured grounds that even a neophyte 
can’t help but be astounded. And all this luscious flora has also attracted 
at least 360 species of birds.
If you’d like to stay the night here, there are 12 well-appointed rooms on-
site. Rates, which include one guided walk, three meals, and taxes, run 
around $84 per person; you definitely need to make reservations before-
hand if you want to spend the night, and it’s usually a good idea to make 
a reservation for a simple day visit and hike.
To get here from Golfito, drive back out to the Interamerican Highway and 
continue south toward Panama. In Ciudad Neily, turn north. A taxi from 
Golfito should cost around $40 each way.

✓ Sailboat charters: There’s no steady charter fleet here, but itiner-
ant sailors often set up shop during the high season. If you’re look-
ing to charter a sailboat, you should check with Banana Bay 
Marina (% 800-245-1635 in the U.S. and Canada, 2775-0838 in 
Costa Rica; www.bananabaymarina.com).
 
✓ Sportfishing: The waters off Golfito also offer some of the best 
sportfishing in Costa Rica. If you’d like to try hooking into a 
possible world-record marlin or sailfish, contact Banana Bay (see 
preceding bullet). These folks have a full-service marina, a few 
waterside rooms for guests, and a fleet of sportfishing boats and 
captains. A full-day fishing trip costs $800 to $2,000.

lthough this region was visited by Columbus in 1502, until rela-
tively recently it has remained historically and geographically iso-
lated from the rest of the country. Today, you still feel as if you’ve 
entered another world, or at least another country, when you visit Costa 
Rica’s Caribbean coast.
So remote was the Caribbean coast from Costa Rica’s population centers 
in the Central Valley that it has developed a culture all its own. More 
than half of this coastline is still inaccessible except by boat or small 
plane. And the Guápiles Highway between San José and Limón was not 
completed until 1987.
The original inhabitants of the area included people of the Bribri, 
Cabécar, and Kéköldi tribes, and these groups maintain their cultures on 
indigenous reserves in the Talamanca Mountains. In fact, until the 1870s, 
few non-Indians resided in this area.
However, when Minor Keith built the railroad to San José and began 
planting bananas, he brought in black laborers from Jamaica and other 
Caribbean islands to lay the track and work the plantations. These work-
ers and their descendants established fishing and farming communities 
up and down the coast. Today, dreadlocked Rastafarians, reggae music, 
Creole cooking, and the English-based patois of this Afro-Caribbean cul-
ture give this region a quasi-Jamaican flavor.

 Chapter 21: Chilling on Costa Rica’s Caribbean Coast 325
Cahuita
Cahuita is a sleepy Caribbean beach village with just a few dirt streets 
and no buildings over two stories high. Nonetheless, it is the first 
“major” tourist destination you’ll reach heading south out of Limón.
Cahuita is one of the most laid-back villages in Costa Rica. After a short 
time, you’ll undoubtedly find yourself slipping into the heat-induced 
torpor that affects anyone who ends up here.
Most people come to Cahuita for its miles of pristine beaches, which 
stretch both north and south of town. The southern beaches, the forest 
behind them, and the coral reef offshore (one of just a handful in Costa 
Rica) are all part of Cahuita National Park.
The village traces its roots to Afro-Caribbean fishermen and laborers 
who settled in this region in the mid-1800s. Today, the population is still 
primarily English-speaking blacks, whose culture and language set them 
apart from other Costa Ricans.
Getting there
There’s a commuter flight between San José and Limón, but most visi-
tors to this region still come by car, van, or bus. The drive here is quite 
beautiful, passing through the massive rain forest of Braulio Carillo 
National Park. Driving a rental car gives you independence and a certain 
level of convenience. However, if you want to leave the driving to others, 
several bus and minivan services are available. You’ll find information 
on all these options in the following sections.
By air
Nature Air (% 800-235-9272 in the U.S. and Canada, 2299-6000 in Costa 
Rica; www.natureair.com) flies from San José to Limón on Monday, 
Wednesday, Saturday, and Sunday. Taxis are always waiting for arriving 
flights and can take you the final leg down to Cahuita.
By car
The Guápiles Highway heads north out of San José on Calle 3 before 
turning east and passing close to Barva volcano and through the rain 
forests of Braulio Carrillo National Park, en route to Limón. The drive 
takes about two and a half hours and is spectacularly beautiful in parts, 
especially when it’s not raining or misty.
As you enter Limón, about 5 blocks from the busiest section of down-
town, watch for a marked intersection, with signs pointing toward 
Cahuita and Puerto Viejo on your right, just before the railroad tracks. 
Take this road south to Cahuita, passing the airstrip and the beach on 

Part VII: Touring the Rest of Costa Rica 
326
your left as you leave Limón. Alternatively, there’s a turnoff with signs 
for Sixaola and La Bomba several miles before Limón. This winding 
shortcut skirts the city and puts you on the coastal road several miles 
south of town.
By bus
MEPE express buses (% 2257-8129) leave San José five times through-
out the day from the Gran Terminal del Caribe (Caribbean bus terminal) 
on Calle Central, 1 block north of Avenida 11. The trip’s duration is four 
hours; fare is $7. During peak periods, extra buses are sometimes added. 
However, checking ahead of time is smart because this bus line is one of 
the most fickle.
Alternatively, you can catch one of the frequent buses to Limón from the 
same station and then transfer to a Cahuita- or Puerto Viejo–bound bus 
(% 2758-1572) in Limón. These latter buses leave roughly every hour 
between 6 a.m. and 7 p.m. from Radio Casino, which is 1 block north of 
the municipal market.
Gray Line (% 2220-2126; www.graylinecostarica.com) and Interbus 
(% 2283-5573; www.interbusonline.com) both have daily buses to 
Cahuita from San José. The fare is $35 to $39. Both companies will pick 
you up and drop you off at most area hotels in San José and Cahuita.
Orienting yourself in Cahuita
There are only about eight dirt streets in Cahuita. The highway runs 
inland and parallel to the coast, with three main access roads running 
perpendicular. The northernmost of these bypasses town and brings 
you to the northern end of Playa Negra. It’s marked with signs for the 
Magellan Inn and other hotels up on this end. The second road in brings 
you to the southern end of Playa Negra, 0.8km (1⁄2 mile) closer to town. 
Look for signs for Atlántida Lodge. The third road is the principal 
entrance into town. The village’s main street in town, which runs paral-
lel to the highway, dead-ends at the entrance to the national park (a 
footbridge over a small stream).
Buses drop their passengers at the main bus terminal, located on the 
main access road just before it hits the town. At the main intersection in 
town there’s a tiny public park. Across from the park, you’ll find a help-
ful large-scale map of the town. For all intents and purposes, this is the 
epicenter of Cahuita. If you come in on the bus and are staying at a lodge 
on Playa Negra, head north out of town on the street that runs between 
Coco’s Bar and the small park. This road curves to the left and continues 
a mile or so out to Playa Negra.
The local chamber of tourism businesses has set up a small information 
booth at the Mariposario Cahuita (% 2755-0361). You can also get 
good information and set up a range of tours at Cahuita Tours and 
Adventure Center (% 2755-0000), Roberto Tours (% 2755-0117), or 

 Chapter 21: Chilling on Costa Rica’s Caribbean Coast 327
Turística Cahuita Information Center (%/fax 2755-0071), all located on 
the village’s main street.
Getting around
Downtown Cahuita is very compact and easily navigable by foot. However, 
some of the hotels located out toward Playa Negra are a good kilometer 
or more away from the center. You’ll usually spot a few taxis cruising 
around town. If you can’t find one on the street, try calling Alejandro 
(% 8875-3209), Wayne (% 2755-0078), or Dino (% 2755-0012).

village. The cabins are quintessentially tropical, with thatch roofs, mos-
quito nets, hardwood floors and beams, big shuttered windows, tile bath-
rooms, and a hammock slung on the front porch. They’re surrounded by 
a large lawn and gardens. There’s no restaurant here, but there is a com-
munal kitchen area, if you want to cook your own meals. The turnoff for 
the lodge is on your right just before you reach the national-park entrance; 
the hotel is located about 136m (446 ft.) down a narrow, winding lane from 
here. Free Wi-Fi is available here.

El Encanto Bed and Breakfast
$–$$$ Cahuita
Despite being close to the center of town, this place feels far removed. The 
individual bungalows are set in from the road, on spacious and well-kept 
grounds. The bungalows themselves are also spacious and have attractive 
touches that include wooden bed frames, arched windows, Mexican-tile 
floors, Guatemalan bedspreads, and framed Panamanian molas hanging 
on the walls. There is a separate two-story, three-bedroom, two-bathroom 
house with a full kitchen at the rear of the grounds, as well as a separate 
deluxe room. Hearty breakfasts are served in the small open dining room 
surrounded by lush gardens. Added amenities here include a small 
kidney-shaped pool, a meditation hall, a covered garden gazebo, and an 
open-air massage room.

Magellan Inn
$$ Playa Negra
This small inn is intimate and cozy. The rooms are carpeted and have 
French doors, vertical blinds, tiled bathrooms with hardwood counters, 
and two joined single beds. Although there’s a ceiling fan over each bed, 
the non-air-conditioned rooms could use a bit more ventilation. However, 
more than half of the rooms here have air-conditioners, and they plan to 
add A/C to the remaining rooms at the rate of one per year. Each room has 
its own tiled veranda with a Persian rug and bamboo sitting chairs. The 
combination bar/lounge and dining room features even more Persian-style 
rugs and bamboo and rattan furniture. The best features here are the 
hotel’s sunken pool and lush gardens, both of which are built into a crev-
ice in the ancient coral reef that underlies this entire region — which leads 
to good bird-watching. The entire hotel features free Wi-Fi.

 Selva Bananito Lodge
$$$–$$$$ Bananito
This remote nature lodge is a great stop either before or after you spend 
some serious beach time in Cahuita or Puerto Viejo. The individual raised-
stilt cabins are large and comfortable, with an abundance of varnished 
woodwork. Inside, you’ll find two double beds, a desk and chair, and some 
fresh flowers, as well as a large private bathroom. Outside there’s a wrap-
around veranda with a hammock and some chairs. Half the cabins have 
views of the Bananito River and a small valley; the other half have views 
of the Matama Mountains, part of the Talamanca mountain range.
There are no electric lights at Selva Bananito and the hot water is pro-
vided by a passive solar system. Each evening as you dine by candlelight, 
your cabin’s oil lamps are lit for you. Tasty family-style meals are served 
in the large, open rancho, which is also a great spot for morning bird-
watching. The lodge offers a wide range of tours and activities, including 
rain-forest hikes and horseback rides in the jungle, tree-climbing, self-
guided trail hikes, and even the opportunity to rappel down the face of a 
jungle waterfall.
The owners are very involved in conservation efforts in this area, and 
approximately two-thirds of the 840 hectares (2,100 acres) here are pri-
mary forest managed as a private reserve. You’ll need a four-wheel-drive 
vehicle to reach the lodge itself, although most folks leave their rental cars 
in Bananito and let the lodge drive them the final leg. You can also arrange 
to be picked up in San José.

$$–$$$ Cahuita SEAFOOD/INTERNATIONAL
Fresh seafood and grilled meats, simply and expertly prepared are served 
here. What more could you ask from a casual, open-air restaurant in a 
funky beach town? In addition to the fresh catch of the day and filet 
mignon, the menu here is an eclectic mix, including everything from jerk 
chicken and Thai shrimp salad to pasta primavera and fajitas. The grilled 
squid salad with a citrus dressing is one of the house specialties and a 
great light bite. The restaurant occupies the ground floor of an old wooden 
building. Everything is painted pure white, with some blue trim and 
accents. There are only a half-dozen or so tables, and this place fills up 
fast.

 Restaurant Edith
$–$$$ Cahuita CREOLE/SEAFOOD
This place is a local landmark, and deservedly so. If you want a taste of the 
local cuisine in a homey, sit-down environment, this is the place. While 
one of Miss Edith’s daughters takes the orders, Mom and more daughters 
cook up a storm out back. The menu, when you can get hold of it, is long, 
with lots of local seafood dishes and Creole combinations such as yuca in 
coconut milk with meat or vegetables. The sauces here have spice and 
zest and are a welcome change from the typically bland fare served up 
throughout the rest of Costa Rica. Hours can be erratic; it sometimes 
closes without warning, and service can be slow and gruff at times. After 
you’ve ordered, it’s usually no more than 45 minutes until your meal 
arrives. It’s often crowded here, so don’t be bashful about sitting down 
with total strangers at any of the big tables.

$$ Cahuita ITALIAN/SEAFOOD
Set on a slight rise of rocks above a coral cove and breaking waves, this 
place has the best location in Cahuita. The funky wooden building housing 
the restaurant features full walls of large picture windows letting out onto 
the sea view. The Italian owners serve a mix of local and Italian fare. They 
serve excellent fresh squid or shrimp in a tangy local coconut milk sauce, 
as well as a host of pasta dishes. The fresh grilled snapper is also always 
a good way to go. I especially like this place for lunch, when you can really 
take advantage of the view of the clear blue Caribbean Sea. If the weather 
permits, grab one of the outdoor tables set in the shade of coconut palms. 
After you finish eating, you can slide over and into one of the hammocks 
strung between those palms.

courses: $5–$30. MC, V. Open: Wed–Mon noon to 10 p.m.
Exploring Cahuita
The main attraction in this area is Cahuita National Park, which is 
located right where the main street in town ends. The other major 
That rundown feeling
While on the Caribbean coast, be sure to try some “rondon” soup or stew. It’s not 
roadkill, but rondon, which comes from “run down” and is a spicy coconut-milk stew 
made with anything the cook can run down. Ingredients usually include some fresh 
seafood, as well as a mix of local tubers, roots, and vegetables.

attraction, Aviarios del Caribe and the Buttercup Sloth Rescue Center, 
is located a few miles north of town. You’ll find detailed information 
about visiting and enjoying both of these places in this section.
Top attractions
Aviarios del Caribe and the Buttercup Sloth Rescue Center
This place is becoming one of the world’s foremost research and rescue 
centers for two- and three-toed sloths. A visit here will feature a tour of 
their natural history center, as well as their sloth rehabilitation facilities. 
They also offer canoe tours through the surrounding estuary, where more 
than 330 species of birds have been spotted. And you can even hike their 
compact series of rain-forest and island trails.
Located 9km (51⁄2 miles) north of Cahuita. %/fax 2750-0775. www.slothrescue.
org. Admission: $15 for 11⁄2-hour canoe-tour combination that includes a visit to the 
sloth rehabilitation center and self-guided hike on its trails; $30 for a 31⁄2-hour canoe 
tour. Open: Daily 6 a.m.–4 p.m.
Cahuita National Park
Cahuita National Park stretches south from the edge of town. The park 
features a long, beautiful curve of white sand backed by dense lowland 
rain forest. Although the soft white sand, lush coastal forest, and picture-
perfect palm lines are a tremendous draw, the park was actually created 
to preserve the 240-hectare (787-acre) coral reef just offshore. The reef 
contains 35 species of coral and provides a haven for hundreds of brightly 
colored tropical fish.
The trail behind the beach stretches a little more than 6.4km (4 miles) to 
the southern end of the park at Puerto Vargas, where you’ll find another 
beautiful white-sand beach, the park headquarters, and a basic camp-
ground with showers and outhouses. It’s a nice, flat walk, but a rewarding 
one because there’s good wildlife viewing and access to the beach. The 
loud grunting sounds you hear off in the distance are the calls of howler 
monkeys, which can be heard from more than a kilometer away. Nearer at 
hand, you’re likely to hear crabs scuttling amid the dry leaves on the 
forest floor — there are half a dozen or so species of land crabs living in 
this region.
The main in-town park entrance to the park is just over a footbridge at 
the end of the village’s main street. It has bathroom facilities, changing 
rooms, and storage lockers. This is the best place to enter if you’re just 
interested in spending the day on the beach and maybe taking a little hike 
in the bordering forest. The official park entrance is at the southern end 
of the park in Puerto Vargas. This is where you should come if you plan 
to camp at the park or if you don’t feel up to hiking a couple of hours to 
reach the good snorkeling spots. The road to Puerto Vargas is approxi-
mately 5km (3 miles) south of Cahuita on the left.
There is an extra $2-per-person charge for camping. The 50 campsites at 
Puerto Vargas stretch along for several kilometers and are either right on 

Part VII: Touring the Rest of Costa Rica 
332
or just a few steps from the beach. My favorite campsites are those far-
thest from the entrance. There are basic shower and bathroom facilities 
at a small ranger station, but these can be a bit far from some of the 
campsites.
See map p. 327. Located south of Cahuita village. The primary public entrance to the 
park is at the southern edge of the village. The official park entrance and campsites 
are at Puerto Vargas 7km (41⁄3 miles) south of Cahuita. % 2755-0060. Admission: $10 
per day at the Puerto Vargas entrance; voluntary donation at the town entrance. 
Open: Daily 6 a.m.–5:30 p.m.
More cool things to see and do
 
✓ Horseback riding: Brigitte (% 2755-0053; www.brigitte
cahuita.com) rents horses for $20 per hour (you must have expe-
rience) and offers guided horseback tours for $35 to $55. She also 
rents mountain bikes for $8 per day.
 
✓ Butterfly-watching: If you want to see a wide variety of butterflies, 
and learn about their fascinating natural history, head to 
Mariposario Cahuita (% 2755-0361). This place is located on the 
main highway just outside of town and is open daily from 8:30 a.m. 
to 3:30 p.m. Admission is $8.
 
✓ Snorkeling: Although there’s snorkeling right from the beach at 
Puerto Vargas inside Cahuita National Park, the nicest coral heads 
are located several hundred meters offshore, and it’s best to have a 
boat take you out. A three-hour snorkel trip should cost between 
$20 and $30 per person with equipment. These can be arranged 
by your hotel or with Cahuita Tours and Adventure Center 
(% 2755-0000).
Shopping for local treasures in Cahuita
For a wide selection of beachwear, local crafts, souvenirs, and batik 
clothing, try Boutique Coco or Boutique Bambata. The latter is a good 
place to have your hair wrapped in colorful threads and strung with 
beads. Right in the center of town, Bodhi’s Books & Gifts is a good new 
option. Handmade jewelry and crafts are sold by local and itinerant arti-
sans in makeshift stands near the park entrance.
Ask around town, and you may be able to pick up a copy of Paula 
Palmer’s What Happen: A Folk-History of Costa Rica’s Talamanca Coast. 
The book is a history of the region, based on interviews with many of 
the area’s oldest residents. Much of it is in the traditional Creole lan-
guage, from which the title is taken. It makes fun and interesting reading, 
and you just might bump into someone mentioned in the book.
If you’re interested in the local music scene, you should definitely pick 
up a disc by Walter “Gavitt” Ferguson. The local 88-year-old calypso 
singer and songwriter is a living legend and has released two separate 

 Chapter 21: Chilling on Costa Rica’s Caribbean Coast 333
CDs of his original songs, Babylon and Dr. Bombodee. Ask around town, 
and you should be able to find a copy. If you’re lucky, you may even 
bump into Walter as well.
Living it up after dark in Cahuita
Coco’s Bar (no phone), a classic Caribbean watering hole located at the 
main crossroads in town, has traditionally been the place to spend your 
nights (or days, for that matter) if you like cold beer and very loud 
reggae and soca music. Toward the park entrance, the National Park 
Restaurant has a popular bar and disco on most nights during the high 
season and on weekends during the off season. Check them both out; on 
any given night, you may be more drawn to one or the other.
Puerto Viejo and the Southernmost Beaches
Although Puerto Viejo is farther down the road from Cahuita, it’s much 
more popular and has a livelier vibe, due in part to the many surfers 
who come here from around the country (and around the world) to ride 
the village’s famous Salsa Brava wave.
As you head still farther south, you’ll come to the most beautiful 
beaches on this coast, with white sand and turquoise seas. When it’s 
calm (Aug–Oct), the waters down here are some of the clearest any-
where in the country, with good snorkeling among the nearby coral 
reefs. Paving of the road, all the way to Manzanillo, has made these 
beaches much more accessible, and a slew of small, moderately priced 
and budget hotels have been built along this stretch of coast.
This is the end of the line along Costa Rica’s Caribbean coast. After the 
tiny town of Manzanillo, some 15km (91⁄3 miles) south of Puerto Viejo, a 
national wildlife reserve stretches a few final kilometers to the 
Panamanian border.
Getting there
As with Cahuita, driving a rental car in Puerto Viejo gives you indepen-
dence and the ability to explore the region on your own. However, if you 
want to leave the driving to others, bus and minivan services are avail-
able. You can also fly into Limón and take a taxi the rest of the way. 
You’ll find information on all these options in the following sections.
By air
Nature Air (% 800-235-9272 in the U.S. and Canada, 2299-6000 in Costa 
Rica; www.natureair.com) flies from San José to Limón on Monday, 
Wednesday, Saturday, and Sunday. Taxis are always waiting for arriving 
flights and can take you the final leg down to Puerto Viejo.

Part VII: Touring the Rest of Costa Rica 
334
By car
To reach Puerto Viejo, continue south from Cahuita for another 16km 
(10 miles). Watch for a prominent fork in the highway. The right-hand 
fork continues on to Bribri and Sixaola. The left-hand fork (it actually 
appears to be a straight shot) takes you into Puerto Viejo on 5km 
(3 miles) of paved, but very potholed and washed out, road.
By bus
MEPE express buses (% 2257-8129 in San José, 2750-0023 in Puerto 
Viejo) to Puerto Viejo leave San José several times a day from the Gran 
Terminal del Caribe (Caribbean bus terminal) on Calle Central, 1 block 
north of Avenida 11. The trip’s duration is four and a half to five hours; 
fare is $8. During peak periods, extra buses are sometimes added. 
Always ask whether the bus is going into Puerto Viejo (you don’t want to 
end up getting dropped off at the turnoff for Sixaola) and whether it’s 
continuing on to Manzanillo (especially helpful if you’re staying in a 
hotel south of town).
Alternatively, you can catch one of the frequent buses to Limón from the 
same station and then transfer to a Puerto Viejo–bound bus in Limón. 
These latter buses (% 2758-1572) leave roughly every hour between 
5 a.m. and 6 p.m. from Radio Casino, which is 1 block north of the munic-
ipal market. Buses from Limón to Manzanillo also stop in Puerto Viejo 
and leave daily at 5 a.m., 10:30 a.m., 3 p.m., and 6 p.m.
 
 If you arrive by bus, be leery of hucksters offering you hotel rooms. In 
most cases, they just work on a small commission from whatever hotel or 
cabina is hiring, and, in some cases, they’ll steer you away from one of my 
recommended hotels or falsely claim that it’s full.
Gray Line (% 2220-2126; www.graylinecostarica.com) and 
Interbus (% 2283-5573; www.interbusonline.com) both have daily 
bus service between San José and Puerto Viejo. The fare is $35 to $39. 
Both companies will pick you up and drop you off at most hotels, both 
in San José and in Puerto Viejo.
Orienting yourself in Puerto Viejo 
and the southernmost beaches
The road in from the highway heads right toward the ocean and then 
runs parallel to Playa Negra (Black Sand Beach) for a couple hundred 
meters before entering the village of Puerto Viejo, which has one paved 
road through the center of town and about ten dirt streets around it. 
The sea will be on your left and forested hills on your right as you come 
into town. It’s another 15km (91⁄3 miles) south to Manzanillo. Along this 
road, you’ll pass the beaches of Playa Cocles, Playa Chiquita, and Punta 
Uva. Aside from some short sections of gravel, this road is paved all the 
way to Manzanillo, although heavy rains and traffic have taken their toll.

 Chapter 21: Chilling on Costa Rica’s Caribbean Coast 335
The Asociación Talamanqueña de Ecoturismo y Conservación 
(Talamancan Association of Ecotourism and Conservation, or ATEC), 
across the street from the Soda Tamara (% 2750-0398 or tel/fax 2750-
0191; www.greencoast.com), is concerned with preserving both the 
environment and the cultural heritage of this area and promoting eco-
logically sound development. In addition to functioning as the local 
information center, Internet cafe, and traveler’s hub, ATEC runs a little 
shop that sells T-shirts, maps, posters, and books. If you’re looking to 
stay in Puerto Viejo for an extended period of time and would like to 
contribute to the community, you can ask here about volunteering.
Getting around
You can rent bicycles at almost every hotel or corner around Puerto 
Viejo; they make an excellent means of getting around.
The town’s main taxi driver is named Bull (% 2750-0112 or 8836-8219). 
You may find him hanging around the parquecito (little park), or you can 
ask a local to point you to his house. If Bull’s not around or he’s busy, 
you could try Delroy (% 2750-0132).

Azania Bungalows
$$ Playa Cocles
This collection of individual bungalows is an excellent option for those 
seeking a quiet, romantic, tropical getaway. The spacious bungalows are 
set apart from each other amid the hotel’s high flowering gardens, giving 
each a sense of seclusion. All come with one queen-size bed and one 
double bed downstairs and another double bed in the small loft. The 
thatch roofs are high-pitched and, combined with large, screened win-
dows, allow for good cross ventilation. The lounge area features a televi-
sion with DirecTV, a small lending library, a collection of board games, and 
free Wi-Fi. There’s also a small, refreshing free-form swimming pool with a 
sculpted waterfall, and an open-air, thatch-roofed, poolside restaurant.

Cariblue Bungalows
$$–$$$$ Playa Cocles
This Italian-run miniresort is a wonderful choice. The rooms are spread 
around well-tended and lush grounds. My favorites are the individual 
raised-stilt wood bungalows. The beds are covered with mosquito nets, 
and there’s a small veranda with a hammock. The nicest features here are 
the bathrooms, with their intricate mosaic-tile designs. The standard 
rooms are spacious and comfortable but not quite as private or charming 
as the bungalows. There’s also a two-bedroom house with a full kitchen,

for families or for longer stays. The resort has a midsize free-form swim-
ming pool with swim-up bar, and large restaurant and lounge area, with 
free Wi-Fi. Cariblue is located about 90m (295 ft.) or so inland from the 
southern end of Playa Cocles.

 Casa Verde Lodge
$ Puerto Viejo
This is my favorite hotel right in the village of Puerto Viejo, regardless of 
price. Despite being located in the heart of town, a quiet sense of tropical 
tranquility pervades this place. The rooms with shared bathrooms are 
housed in a raised building with a wide, covered breezeway between the 
rooms. The front and back porches of this building are hung with ham-
mocks and surrounded by lush gardens, where you’ll find the showers and 
toilets. The rest of the rooms are spread around the small complex. Most 
are larger, with high ceilings, tile floors, private bathrooms, and a private 
veranda. There’s also a small separate bungalow with a kitchenette. 
Everything is very well maintained, and even the shared bathrooms are

and delightful pool area. Even though it’s an in-town choice, there’s great 
bird-watching all around the grounds here.

 La Costa de Papito
$–$$ Playa Cocles
This intimate collection of individual and duplex cabins is located just 
across from Cocles Beach, about 1.6km (1 mile) south of Puerto Viejo. The 
wooden bungalows come with one or two double beds, artfully tiled bath-
rooms, and an inviting private porch with a table and chairs and either a 
hammock or a swing chair. La Costa de Papito has been steadily expand-
ing over the years, adding new cabins and amenities. There’s an excellent 
restaurant on site, as well as a well-run little spa.

Set amid the shade of large old trees several kilometers south of Puerto 
Viejo toward Punta Uva (watch for the sign), the lodge consists of several 
wooden buildings set on stilts and connected by a raised wooden

walkway. There are wide verandas with built-in seating and rocking chairs. 
The spacious rooms are painted in bright colors. A short trail on the 
grounds leads down to a semiprivate little swimming beach with tide 
pools and beautiful turquoise water. This stretch of beach is the site of a 
daily 4 p.m. pickup volleyball game.
The owners have three children, ranging from a young child to a couple 
of teenagers, and travelers with kids will feel like part of the family. The 
owners also rent out fully equipped houses for those interested in longer 
stays or more privacy and independence.

Shawandha Lodge
$$ Playa Chiquita
If you’re looking for an isolated and romantic getaway, this small collec-
tion of individual bungalows is a great choice. Set in a lush patch of forest 
about 180m (590 ft.) or so inland from Playa Chiquita, Shawandha has the 
feel of a small village. Artistic flourishes abound. The thatch-roofed, raised 
bungalows feature painted exterior murals, high-pitched ceilings, var-
nished wood floors, and either one king-size bed or a mix of queen-size 
and single beds.
The bathrooms are practically works of art, each with original, intricate 
mosaics of hand-cut tile highlighting a large, open shower. Each bungalow 
has its own spacious balcony, with both a hammock and a couch, where 
you can lie and look out on the lush, flowering gardens. The beach is easily 
accessed by a private path, and a host of activities and tours can be 
arranged.
There’s a large open-air restaurant and lounge where meals and drinks are 
served. The menu is an eclectic mix, featuring fresh fish and meats in a 
variety of French, Caribbean, and Polynesian sauces.

 Tree House Lodge
$$$$–$$$$$ Playa Chiquita
The three individual houses here are the most unique and stylish to be 
found on the Caribbean coast. All three are distinct, with fluid and fanciful 
architectural details and loads of varnished hardwoods. The namesake 
Tree House is built around a large sangrillo tree, while the Beach House 
Suite features a massive and spectacular domed bathroom with scores of 
different colored skylights.
The property is located on a beautiful piece of beachfront right off Punta 
Uva, one of the best and most stunning swimming beaches on this coast.

Perfect for breakfast or lunch, this place is almost always bustling and full. 
Breakfasts feature waffles, French toast, and pancakes served with some 
namesake fresh chocolate sauce, or egg dishes served with home-baked 
biscuits, bagels, or whole-wheat bread. For lunch, sandwiches are served 
on aforementioned homemade bread. Though you can opt for a BLT, 
grilled cheese, or jerk chicken sandwich, those with kids (or kids at heart) 
might want to sample the PB&J or PB&Chocolate, with all homemade 
ingredients. Both breakfast and lunch are served all day. Don’t leave with-

A funky, hippie vibe pervades this open-air restaurant. Seating is at simple 
wooden tables. The short menu features several vegetarian items, as well 
as fresh fish and some chicken and meat dishes, prepared in curry, Thai, 
and Mexican sauces. There’s often live music here, running the gamut 
from reggae to jazz to Latin American folk.

taining blur. Sure, he’s got help, including his grandmother making gnoc-
chi, but it sometimes seems like he’s doing it single-handedly. The menu 
has a broad selection of pizzas and pastas, but your best bet is to just ask 
Ilario what’s fresh and special for that day and to trust his instincts and 
inventions. I’ve had fabulous fresh pasta dishes and top-notch appetizers 
every time I’ve visited. These folks also have a simpler, more casual res-
taurant, Gatta Ci Cova, on the main road, just beside the entrance to La

 Soda Tamara
$–$$$ Puerto Viejo COSTA RICAN/CREOLE
This little open-air restaurant has long been popular with budget-con-
scious travelers and has an attractive setting for such an economical 
place. The multi-colored painted picket fence in front gives the restaurant 
a homey feel. The menu features standard local fish, chicken, and meat 
entrees, served with a hefty helping of Caribbean-style rice and beans. 
You can also get patacones (fried chips made out of plantains) and a wide 
selection of fresh-fruit juices. At the counter inside, you’ll find homemade 
cocoa candies and unsweetened cocoa biscuits made by several women 
in town. They’re definitely worth a try. Soda Tamara also has a second-
floor open-air bar that’s open nightly from 6 p.m. until the last straggler 
calls it quits.

Exploring Puerto Viejo and the southernmost beaches
Miles of often deserted beaches backed by thick rain forest are the main 
attraction of this region, and in this section, I tell you how to best enjoy 
them.
The top attractions
 
 The Beaches South of Puerto Viejo
The beaches south of Puerto Viejo are arguably some of the best in the 
country. Here, thick rain forests and coastal coconut palms come right 
down to the shore, meeting soft white-sand beaches that front clear, blue 
Caribbean seas.
The first beach you reach as you head south out of town is Playa Cocles. 
This long, white-sand beach is popular with surfers, especially those not 
up to the challenge of the thick and treacherous Salsa Brava reef break.

Part VII: Touring the Rest of Costa Rica 
340
Beyond Playa Cocles lies Playa Chiquita. This stretch is characterized by 
small protected patches of swimmable beach and tide pools punctuating 
a wavy coastline of exposed and shallow reefs. This is a good place to 
come and search out a little private cove or tide pool.
 
 Perhaps the most popular beach down here is Punta Uva (Grape Point), 
a beautiful and protected curve of soft sand lying in the lee of a small 
forested hillside and outcropping. There’s a short loop trail through the 
forest and over the rocks of this gorgeous outcropping.
 
 At the end of the road lies Manzanillo, a tiny village with only a few basic 
cabinas and funky sodas. The town is the gateway to the Manzanillo-
Gandoca Wildlife Refuge (see listing later in this section). The beaches just 
off the town, as well as those inside the refuge, are stellar. The entire area 
off the town and much of the refuge is protected by coral reef, making 
these some of the most beautiful beaches on the coastline, as well as some 
of the best for swimming.
If you have a rental car, you can explore the various beaches down here 
at your whim and leisure. However, don’t fret if you don’t have a car. To 
reach any of these beaches, you can catch the 7:30 a.m. bus from Puerto 
Viejo down to Manzanillo. There are a couple more buses throughout the 
day as well. The last bus back leaves Manzanillo at 5 p.m. It’s always wise 
to check with Asociación Talamanqueña de Ecoturismo y Conservación 
(ATEC) about current local bus schedules. Call % 2750-0398 or tel/fax 
2750-0191; also visit www.greencoast.com. You could also hire a cab for 
around $8 to Punta Uva or $12 to Manzanillo. Call Bull (% 2750-0112 or 
8836-8219) or Delroy (% 2750-0132).
Alternatively, it should take you less than an hour each way by bicycle, 
with only two relatively small hills to contend with. However, although the 
road is ostensibly paved all the way to Manzanillo, much of it is severely 
potholed and washed out. It’s even possible to walk along the beach all 
the way from Puerto Viejo to Manzanillo, with just a couple of short and 
well-worn detours inland around rocky points.
See map p. 341. Playa Cocles is 2km (11⁄4 miles) south of Puerto Viejo, Playa Chiquita 
is 5km (3 miles) from town, Punta Uva is 8km (5 miles) away, and Manzanillo is about 
15km (91⁄3 miles) south of town.
Finca La Isla Botanical Gardens
One of the nicest ways to spend a day in Puerto Viejo is to visit the Finca 
La Isla Botanical Gardens. Host Peter Kring, and his late wife, Lindy, 
poured much time and love into the creation of this meandering collection 
of native and imported tropical flora. There are medicinal, commercial, 
and just plain wild flowering plants, fruits, herbs, trees, and bushes here. 
Visitors get to gorge on whatever is ripe at the moment. You’re almost 
guaranteed to see some poison dart frogs here. There is also a rigorous 
rain-forest loop trail leaving from the grounds.
See map p. 341. A couple hundred meters inland from the Black Sand Beach on the 
road that leads into town. % 2750-0046 or 8886-8530. crgarden@mac.com. 

 Chapter 21: Chilling on Costa Rica’s Caribbean Coast 341
Admission: $5 per person for the garden or loop trail, or $10 per person with the 
guided tour. Open: Fri–Mon 10 a.m.–4 p.m., but visits can sometimes be arranged for 
other days with advance notice.
Manzanillo-Gandoca Wildlife Refuge
The Manzanillo-Gandoca Wildlife Refuge encompasses the small village of 
Manzanillo and extends all the way to the Panamanian border. Manatees, 
crocodiles, and more than 350 species of birds live within the boundaries 
of the reserve. The reserve also includes the coral reef offshore — when 
the seas are calm, this is the best snorkeling and diving spot on this entire 
coast. Four species of sea turtles nest on one 8.9km (51⁄2-mile) stretch of 
beach within the reserve between March and July. Three species of dol-
phin also inhabit and frolic in the waters just off Manzanillo. Many local 
tour guides and operators offer boat trips out to spot them.
If you want to explore the refuge, you can easily find the single, well-
maintained trail by walking along the beach just south of town until you

have to wade across a small river. On the other side, you’ll pick up the 
trailhead. Otherwise, you can ask around the village for local guides.
Inside the Manzanillo-Gandoca refuge is the Punta Mona Center For 
Sustainable Living & Education (% 2222-4568; www.puntamona.org). 
With organic permaculture gardens and a distinctly alternative vibe, this 
place is open for day visits, overnight stays, and work-exchange and edu-
cational programs. A day trip to visit the center, its garden, and facilities, 
including a vegetarian organic lunch, costs $45; overnight stays cost $40, 
including three meals.

More cool things to see and do
 
✓ Getting to know the local culture: The Asociación Talamanqueña 
de Ecoturismo y Conservación (ATEC; % 2750-0398 or tel/fax 
2750-0191; www.greencoast.com) offers half-day and full-day 
tours that focus on nature and either the local Afro-Caribbean cul-
ture or the indigenous Bribri culture. These tours pass through 
farms and forests, and along the way you’ll learn about local his-
tory, customs, medicinal plants, and mythology. You’ll also have an 
opportunity to see sloths, monkeys, iguanas, keel-billed toucans, 
and other wildlife.
 
 You’ll find a range of different tours through the nearby Bribri 
Indians’ Kéköldi Reserve, as well as more strenuous hikes through 
the primary rain forest. Bird walks and night walks will help you 
spot more of the area wildlife; there are even overnight camping 
treks. The local guides who lead these tours have a wealth of infor-
mation and make a hike through the forest a truly educational 
experience. Half-day walks (and night walks) are $20 to $35, and a 
full day costs $30 to $65. ATEC can arrange snorkeling trips to the 
nearby coral reefs, as well as snorkeling and fishing trips in dugout 
canoes. A half-day of snorkeling or fishing costs around $35 per 
person.
 
✓ Scuba-diving and snorkeling: Scuba divers can check in with Reef 
Runners Dive Shop (% 2750-0480; www.reefrunnersdivers.
com). This operation frequents about ten different dive sites 
between Punta Uva and Manzanillo. When the seas are calm and 
visibility is good, this beach offers some good snorkeling and 
diving.
 
✓ Surfing: Just offshore from Puerto Viejo’s tiny village park is a shal-
low reef where powerful storm-generated waves sometimes reach 
6m (20 ft.). Salsa Brava, as it’s known, is the prime surf break on 
the Caribbean coast. Even when the waves are small, this spot is 
recommended only for very experienced surfers because of the 
danger of the reef. Less-experienced riders should head for the 
beach break at Playa Cocles. You can rent surfboards and boogie 
boards from several makeshift roadside stands around town.

 Chapter 21: Chilling on Costa Rica’s Caribbean Coast 343
 
✓ Taking a yoga class or getting a massage: If either of these options 
sounds interesting, check in with Samasati (% 800-563-9643 in the 
U.S., 2756-8015 in Costa Rica; www.samasati.com), a lovely jungle 
yoga retreat with spectacular hillside views of the Caribbean Sea 
and surrounding forests. You can come up for yoga classes ($15), 
meditations ($5), or private massages ($75–$110) with advance 
notice. Samasati is located a couple of kilometers before Puerto 
Viejo (near the turnoff for Bribri) and roughly 1.6km (1 mile) up 
into the jungle.
 
 For some in-town pampering, try Pure Jungle Spa (% 2750-0536; 
www.purejunglespa.com), which offers a wide range of massage 
and treatment options.
 
✓ Doing a little bit of this and a little bit of that at Cacao Trails 
(% 2756-8186; www.cacaotrails.com): Great for families, this is 
a one-stop attraction featuring botanical gardens, a small serpen-
tarium, an open-air museum demonstrating the tools and tech-
niques of cacao cultivation and processing, and a series of trails. 
There’s also a large open-air restaurant, and a swimming pool for 
cooling off. You can also take canoe rides on the bordering Carbon 
River, and even watch sea turtles lay their eggs during the nesting 
season. Admission to the attraction is $25, including a guided tour. 
A full-day tour, including lunch and a canoe trip, as well as the 
guided tour, costs $47. During turtle nesting season, they do night 
tours to watch sea turtles lay their eggs.
Shopping for local treasures
Puerto Viejo attracts a lot of local and international bohemians, who 
seem to survive solely on the sale of handmade jewelry, painted ceramic 
trinkets (mainly pipes and cigarette-lighter holders), and imported 
Indonesian textiles. You’ll find them at makeshift stands set up by the 
town’s parquecito (little park), in a line of wooden kiosks fronting the sea 
between Soda Tamara and Stanford’s.
If you venture away from the makeshift artisan stands, Luluberlu, 
located inland across from Cabinas Guaraná, features locally produced 
craftwork, including shell mobiles and mirrors with mosaic-inlaid 
frames, as well as imports from Thailand and India. The Jewelry Factory 
and Color Caribe, both on the main road into town, sell a wide range of 
jewelry, crafts, and gift items, as well as Costa Rican hammocks.
Living it up after dark in Puerto Viejo
Puerto Viejo has one of the best nightlife scenes in the country. There 
are two main discos/bars in town. Johnny’s Place (% 2750-0623), is 
near the Rural Guard station, about a block or so north of the ATEC 
office. You’ll find Stanford’s (% 2750-0016) overlooking the water out 
near Salsa Brava just as the main road heads south of town. Both have 
small dance floors with ground-shaking reggae and rap rhythms blaring. 
The action usually spills out from the dance floor at both joints on most 

Part VII: Touring the Rest of Costa Rica 
344
nights. I like the atmosphere better at Johnny’s, where they have tables 
and candles set out on the sand, near the water’s edge.
For a more sophisticated ambience, but still with a crowded dance floor, 
try the downtown Baba Yaga (% 8388-4359).
Another place I like, E-Z Times (% 2750-0663) has a more relaxed vibe, 
with occasional live music performances.
Tortuguero
Tortuguero comes from the Spanish name for the giant sea turtles (tortu-
gas) that nest on the beaches of this region every year from early March 
to mid-October. The chance to see this nesting attracts many people to 
this remote region, but just as many come to explore the intricate net-
work of jungle canals that serve as the region’s main transportation 
arteries. This stretch of coast is connected to Limón, the Caribbean 
coast’s only port city, by a series of rivers and canals that parallel the 
sea, often running only about 90m (295 ft.) from the beach. This aquatic 
highway is lined for most of its length with a dense rain forest that is 
home to howler and spider monkeys, three-toed sloths, toucans, and 
great green macaws. A trip up the canals is a bit like cruising the 
Amazon, but on a much smaller scale.
Getting there
Independent travel is not the norm in this area, although it’s possible. Most 
folks rely on their lodge for boat transportation through the canals and 
into town. At most of the lodges around Tortuguero, almost everything 
(bus rides to and from, boat trips through the canals, and even family-style 
meals) is done in groups. Depending on a variety of factors, this group 
feeling can be intimate and rewarding or overwhelming and impersonal.
By air
Nature Air (% 800-235-9272 in the U.S. and Canada, 2299-6000 in Costa 
Rica; www.natureair.com) and Sansa (% 877-767-2672 in the U.S. and 
Canada, 2290-4100 in Costa Rica; www.flysansa.com) both have regu-
lar daily flights to the small airstrip in Tortuguero. In addition, many 
lodges in this area operate charter flights as part of their package trips. 
Flights take between 35 and 45 minutes and cost $98 each way on Sansa, 
$107 each way on Nature Air.
 
  
By land and water
You can’t drive to Tortuguero. If you have a car, your best bet is to leave 
it in San José and take an organized tour or drive it to Limón or Moín, 
find a secure hotel or public parking lot, and then follow my directions 

 Chapter 21: Chilling on Costa Rica’s Caribbean Coast 345
for arriving by boat. There is also secure parking in La Pavona, which 
meets the boats plying the Cariari and La Pavona route outlined here.
Flying to Tortuguero is convenient if you don’t have much time, but a 
boat trip through the canals and rivers of this region is often the high-
light of any visit to Tortuguero. However, although this trip can be stun-
ning and exciting, it can also be tiring and uncomfortable. You’ll first 
have to ride by car, bus, or minivan from San José to Moín, Caño Blanco, 
or one of the other embarkation points; then it’s two to three hours on a 
boat, usually with hard wooden benches or plastic seats.
All the more expensive lodges listed later in this chapter offer their 
own bus and boat transportation packages, which include the boat ride 
through the canals. However, if you’re coming here independently, you’ll 
have to arrange your own transportation. In this case, you have a few 
options.

Part VII: Touring the Rest of Costa Rica 
346
The most traditional option is to get yourself first to Limón and then to 
the docks in Moín, just north of Limón, and try to find a boat on your 
own. Buses leave roughly every half-hour throughout the day for Limón 
from Gran Terminal del Caribe, on Calle Central, 1 block north of 
Avenida 11 (% 2222-0610). If you’re coming by car, make sure you drive 
all the way to Limón or Moín unless you have prior arrangements out of 
Cariari or Caño Blanco Marina.
From Limón, you can catch one of the periodic local buses to Moín right 
from the main bus terminal or hire a taxi for around $6. There are always 
plenty of taxis hanging around the bus terminal and cruising the streets 
of Limón. Taxi Limón is the main cab company (% 2758-1539).
At the docks, you should be able to negotiate a fare of $40 to $70, 
depending on how many people you can round up to go with you. These 
boats tend to depart between 8 a.m. and 10 a.m. every day. Usually, the 
fare you pay covers the return trip as well, and you can arrange with the 
captain to take you back when you’re ready to leave. The trip from Moín 
to Tortuguero takes three to four hours.
You can also get to Tortuguero by bus and boat from Cariari. This is the 
cheapest and most adventurous means of reaching Tortuguero from San 
José, but it’s also more work — and if you miss a connection or the 
boats aren’t running, you could get stuck in a backwater banana village. 
To take this route, begin by catching the 9 a.m. or 10:30 a.m. direct bus 
to Cariari from the Gran Terminal del Caribe, on Calle Central, 1 block 
north of Avenida 11 (% 2222-0610). The fare is $2.50. This bus will actu-
ally drop you off at the main bus terminal in Cariari, from which you’ll 
have to walk 5 blocks north to a separate small bus station. Look for a 
booth marked “Coopetraca” or “Clic Clic.” At these booths you can buy 
your bus ticket for La Pavona. The bus fare is around $2. Buy a ticket for 
the noon bus (a later bus leaves at 3 p.m.). A boat or two will be waiting 
to meet the bus at the dock at the edge of the river at around 1:30 p.m. 
and again at 4:30 p.m. Check out the boats heading to Tortuguero, and 
pick the one that looks most comfortable and safe; then pay onboard.
 
 The boat fare to Tortuguero is not regulated, and the price sometimes 
varies for foreigners. It can be as low as $3 each way, which is what 
locals pay. However, the boat captains often try to gouge tourists. Stand 
firm; you should not have to pay more than $5. Return boats leave 
Tortuguero for La Pavona every day at 6 a.m., 11:30 a.m., and 3 p.m., 
making return bus connections to Cariari.
 
 Be careful if you decide to take this latter route. I’ve received reports of 
unscrupulous operators providing misinformation to tourists. Folks 
from a company called Bananera have set up shop at the Gran Terminal 
del Caribe and in Cariari, offering to sell you “packaged transportation” 
to Tortuguero. However, all they’re doing is charging you extra to buy 
the individual tickets described here. Be especially careful if the folks 
selling you boat transportation aggressively steer you to a specific hotel 
option, claim that your first choice is full, or insist that you must buy a 

 Chapter 21: Chilling on Costa Rica’s Caribbean Coast 347
package with them that includes the transportation, lodging, and guide 
services. If you have doubts or want to check on the current state of this 
route, check out www.tortuguerovillage.com, which has detailed 
directions about how to get to Tortuguero by a variety of routes.
Orienting yourself in Tortuguero
Tortuguero is one of the most remote locations in Costa Rica. There are 
no roads into this area and no cars in the village, so all transportation is 
by boat or foot. Most of the lodges are spread out over several kilome-
ters to the north of the village of Tortuguero on either side of the main 
canal; the small airstrip is at the north end of the beachside spit of land.
Tortuguero Village is a tiny collection of houses connected by footpaths. 
The village is spread out on a thin spit of land, bordered on one side by 
the Caribbean Sea and on the other by the main canal. At most points, 
it’s less than 300m (984 ft.) wide. In the center of the village you’ll find a 
small children’s playground and a fútbol (soccer) field, as well as a kiosk 
that has information on the cultural and natural history of this area.
There is a private information center (% 8833-0827) in front of the 
Catholic church in the center of town. This is a good place for indepen-
dent travelers looking to arrange local tours and onward travel.
Getting around
Transportation in and around Tortuguero is either by foot or small boat. 
If you stay at a hotel on the ocean side of the canal, you’ll be able to 
walk into and explore the village at your leisure; if you’re across the 
canal, you’ll be dependent on the lodge’s boat transportation.
There are no banks, ATMs, or currency-exchange houses in Tortuguero, 
be sure to bring sufficient cash in colones to cover any expenses and 
incidental charges. The local hotels and shops generally charge a bit of a 
commission to exchange dollars.
Spending the night
 
 Casa Marbella
$ Tortuguero Village
This in-town option is a great choice for budget travelers looking for a bit 
more comfort and care than that offered at most of the more inexpensive 
options found right in the village. The rooms here all have high ceilings, 
tile floors, firm mattresses, and white walls with varnished wood trim. The 
two “superior” rooms have views of the canal. Owner Daryl Loth is a long-
time resident and well-respected naturalist guide. Breakfast is served on 
a little patio facing the main Tortuguero canal in back of the house. A wide 
range of tours and onward travels can be arranged. A small library with a 
good selection of natural history books, a lounge and library area, and free 
Wi-Fi throughout complete the facilities here.

room also has a little shared veranda overlooking flowering gardens.
The large dining room, where basic buffet-style meals are served, is 
located on a free-form deck that extends out over the Tortuguero Canal. 
Another covered deck, also over the water, is strung with hammocks for 
lazing away the afternoons. Several covered palapa huts strung with ham-
mocks have also been built among the flowering ginger and hibiscus. A 
large and inviting pool, with a poolside bar and grill, as well as lush botani-
cal gardens are on-site. All the standard Tortuguero tours are available.

queen-size beds, high ceilings, wood floors, tasteful local furnishings, and 
a host of amenities you won’t find anywhere else in the area. Meals and 
service are top-notch here, and they have the best little spa of any local 
hotel, as well as an on-site art gallery. The amoeba-shaped pool is set just 
off the dark waters of the Tortuguero canal, with a broad deck and plenty 
of inviting chaise lounges surrounding it. Children 9 and under are not 
allowed at the hotel.

side of the canal, Mawamba is even closer to the village. Rooms have 
brightly painted walls, varnished wood floors, twin beds, hot-water show-
ers, ceiling fans, and verandas with rocking chairs. The gardens are lush 
and overgrown with flowering ginger, heliconia, and hibiscus. There are 
plenty of hammocks around for anyone who wants to kick back, and a 
beach volleyball court for those who don’t.
The family-style meals here are above average for Tortuguero. Rates 
include a four-hour boat ride through the canals and a guided forest hike. 
These folks have an extensive menu of kayaking tours and excursions, 
including one package in which you actually kayak part of the way into 
Tortuguero. There’s a small gift shop on the premises, a small butterfly 
garden, and nightly lectures and slide shows that focus on the natural 
history of this area.

 Tortuga Lodge
$$$$ Tortuguero
This is one of the oldest hotels in Tortuguero, and still one of the best. My 
favorite feature here is the long, multilevel deck located off the main 
dining room, where you can sit and dine, sip a cool tropical drink, or just 
take in the view as the water laps against the docks at your feet. There’s 
also a lovely little pool built by the water’s edge and designed to create 
the illusion that it blends into Tortuguero’s main canal. Most of the rooms 
have contemporary wood furniture, tropical décor, and loads of freshly 
varnished hardwood. Each room comes with either one double and one 
twin bed or one king-size bed, a ceiling fan, and a comfortable private 
bathroom. There’s also a two-bedroom, two-bath, second-floor penthouse 
suite, great for families or those wanting more space. Run by Costa Rica 
Expeditions, service here is top-notch, as are the family-style meals. There 
are several acres of forest behind the lodge, and a few kilometers of trails 
wind their way through the trees. This is a great place to look for howler 
monkeys and colorful poison dart frogs.

Exploring Tortuguero
This is a very remote region, with no cars. All travel around the region is 
by boat. Most of the hotels include visits to the various attractions here 
as part of their package prices. If not, they’ll certainly offer them as 
added-on tour options.
The top attractions
Caribbean Conservation Corporation’s Visitors Center and Museum
Aside from the national park, the only other real attraction in town is the 
small Caribbean Conservation Corporation’s Visitors Center and Museum. 
The museum has information and exhibits on a complete range of native 
flora and fauna, but its primary focus is on the life and natural history of 
sea turtles. Most visits to the museum include a short, informative video 
on these turtles. There’s a small gift shop here, and all the proceeds go 
toward conservation and turtle protection.
See map p. 345. % 2709-8091. www.cccturtle.org. Admission: $1. Open: Mon–
Sat 10 a.m. to noon and 2–5:30 p.m., Sun 2–5 p.m.
Tortugero National Park
Tortuguero National Park exists primarily to protect a major nesting site 
for several species of sea turtles. According to existing records, sea turtles 
have frequented the beaches here since at least 1592, largely due to the 
area’s extreme isolation. Over the years, turtles were captured and their 
eggs were harvested by local settlers; by the 1950s, this practice became 
so widespread that the turtles faced extinction. Regulations controlling 
this mini-industry were passed in 1963, and in 1970, Tortuguero National 
Park was established.
Today, four different species of sea turtles nest here: the green turtle, the 
hawksbill, the loggerhead, and the giant leatherback. The prime nesting 
period is from July to mid-October (with Aug–Sept being the peak 
months). Nesting takes place at night, and if you’re lucky you’ll be able to 
watch one of these mammoth maritime reptiles laboriously dig a deep 
hole and then deposit scores of eggs into it. (When the nesting is com-
pleted, the turtle covers up the hole and heads back to sea.)
When the turtles are nesting, you’ll have to arrange a night tour in advance 
with either your hotel or one of the private guides working in town. These 
guided tours generally run between $10 and $15. Flashlights and flash 
cameras are not permitted on the beach at night because the lights dis-
courage the turtles from nesting.

 Chapter 21: Chilling on Costa Rica’s Caribbean Coast 351
You can also explore the park’s rain forest, either by foot or by boat, and 
look for some of the incredible varieties of wildlife that live here: jaguars, 
anteaters, howler monkeys, collared and white-lipped peccaries, some 350 
species of birds, and countless butterflies, among others. Boat tours are 
far and away the most popular way to visit this park, although one fre-
quently very muddy trail here starts at the park entrance and runs for 
about 2km (11⁄4 miles) through the coastal rain forest and along the beach.
 
 Most people visit Tortuguero as part of a package tour. Be sure to confirm 
whether the park entrance is included in the price. Moreover, only certain 
canals and trails leaving from the park station are actually within the park. 
Many hotels and private guides take their tours to a series of canals that 
border the park and are very similar in terms of flora and fauna but don’t 
require a park entrance.

National Park entrance and ranger station are at the south end of Tortuguero Village. 
% 2710-2929. Admission: $10 per day. Open: Daily 8 a.m.–4 p.m.
More cool things to see and do
 
✓ Canoeing or kayaking on your own: In the village, you can rent 
dugout canoes, known in Costa Rica as cayucos or pangas. Be care-
ful before renting and taking off in one of these; they tend to be 
heavy, slow, and hard to maneuver, and you may be getting more 
than you bargained for. Miss Junie (% 2709-8102) rents more-
modern, lighter, fiberglass canoes for around $5 for a half-day.
 
✓ Enjoying the beach: Although Tortuguero’s beaches are excellent 
places to watch sea turtles nest, they aren’t particularly well suited 
for swimming. The surf is usually very rough, and the river mouths 
have a nasty habit of attracting sharks that feed on the turtle hatch-
lings and many fish that live here.
Turtle tour tips
Visitors to the beach at night must be accompanied by a licensed guide. Tours generally 
last two to four hours.
Sometimes you must walk quite a bit to encounter a nesting turtle. Wear sneakers or 
walking shoes rather than sandals. The beach is very dark at night, and you can easily 
trip or step on driftwood or other detritus.
Wear dark clothes. White T-shirts are not permitted.
Flashlights, flash cameras, and lighted video cameras are prohibited on turtle tours.
Smoking is prohibited on the beach at night.

The Part of Tens

folks have about Costa Rica. Then I point you toward my 
list of ten favorite moments and experiences available to 
travelers here.

Chapter 22
Ten Myths about Costa Rica
In This Chapter
▶ Learning to love bugs
▶ Getting a handle on the weather
▶ Finding a good cup of joe
D
espite its popularity, many misconceptions about Costa Rica exist. 
This chapter should help dispel a few.
Costa Rica Is Just for the Adventurous
Sure, the country is an adventure traveler’s dream, and you can rough it 
if you want. But you can also choose from a host of very luxurious 
options, which run the gamut from ultra-exclusive boutique hotels to 
large luxury resorts run by the Four Seasons and Marriott chains.
Costa Rica Isn’t for Families
You won’t find many amusement parks or video arcades here, but Costa 
Rica has a ton of fun and interesting stuff for the entire family. Options 
that will thrill all ages include educational hikes in the rain forest, rafting 
trips, zip-line canopy tours, and butterfly gardens. In addition, Costa 
Rican hotels are increasingly gearing up to meet the needs of families. 
Children’s programs and reliable baby-sitting are becoming more and 
more common.
Bugs Are Bad
You’ll probably encounter far fewer biting bugs in Costa Rica than you’d 
expect. Moreover, the insect world is one of the most diverse, fascinat-
ing, and vitally important elements of all tropical ecosystems. Learn to 
love the shimmering beetles, long-legged stick bugs, and industrious 
leaf-cutter ants, and your visit to Costa Rica will be much more enjoy-
able. Of course, some insect repellent and light, long-sleeved clothing 
are always good when mosquitoes or sand flies are present.

Part VIII: The Part of Tens 
356
Costa Rica Is an Ecological Eden
Although this is partially true, Costa Rica nevertheless faces serious 
challenges and threats from legal and illegal logging, as well as animal 
hunting and poaching, pollution, overbuilding, poor planning, and rapid 
development run amok.
You Can’t Drink the Water
Some travelers get a bit sick or queasy with any change to their intesti-
nal flora, but in general, the water is safe to drink in most major tourist 
hotels and destinations in Costa Rica. That said, if you’re at all predis-
posed to a tender tummy, rely on bottled water and drinks.
The Caribbean Coast Is Dangerous
This myth is quite prevalent in Costa Rica, and I blame a few high-profile 
crimes and basic racism in equal measure. The fact is that the Caribbean 
coast is no more or less dangerous than any other major tourist destina-
tion in Costa Rica.
It’s Okay to Feed the Monkeys
Don’t listen to any guide or hotel owner who tells you this. Remember: It 
is not cool to feed monkeys or any other wild animal. Wild animals are just 
that: wild. Close contact with humans — especially humans offering food — 
alters their behavior, survival mechanisms, and immune systems.
It’s Always Raining in the Rain Forest
Sure, it rains a lot in the rain forest — over 508cm (200 in.) per year in 
many cases. However, these rains are often hard and intense for short 
durations. Apart from the period between early September and mid-
November, it’s rare for a visit to a rain-forest lodge to be characterized 
by constant rainfall. Mornings are often clear and sunny. During the 
months when the rain forests are, well, rainy, the Caribbean coast is gen-
erally bathed in sunshine and calm weather, so you’re better off staying 
there. If you do get caught in the rain, remember: This is what makes the 
rain forest so vibrant and verdant.
Everybody Speaks English
Although most hotel, restaurant, and tour-agency workers have a work-
ing knowledge of English, most rural Costa Ricans do not. Knowing a few 

 Chapter 22: Ten Myths about Costa Rica 357
important Spanish words and phrases can go a long way toward improv-
ing your interactions and relationships with Costa Ricans. See Chapter 2 
for more information.
Costa Rican Coffee Is the Best
Costa Rica does produce some of the world’s finest coffee, but most of 
the best beans are destined for export. Moreover, Costa Ricans them-
selves seem to prefer a weak and very sweet brew. Still, you can get 
good coffee at most of the better restaurants and hotels, as well as in 
establishments catering to foreigners.
 
 If you’re buying coffee to bring home, make sure you get whole beans, 
and shoot for a reputable brand such as Cafe Britt, or one of the high-
end smaller roasters, such as Cafe Milagro or Cafe Monteverde.

Ten Costa Rican Moments
In This Chapter
▶ Enjoying a true taste of the local cuisine
▶ Setting your clock to the natural sounds and rhythms
▶ Bathing at the foot of a jungle waterfall
▶ Watching an active volcano erupt
T
he activities, adventures, and attractions listed in this chapter range 
from the classic to the obscure and from calm and mellow to wet 
and wild. I outline many more in the various destination chapters of this 
book. But be sure to try to fit a few of these experiences into your trip to 
Costa Rica.
Pouring Salsa Lizano on Your Gallo Pinto
Salsa Lizano, a tart but mild sauce made with vinegar, and gallo pinto 
(rice and beans) are both ubiquitous staples of Costa Rican cuisine. So, 
order up some gallo pinto and pour on some tangy Salsa Lizano. If you 
want to really sound like a local, simply ask for some “Lizano para mi 
pinto.” See Chapter 2 for more information on Costa Rican cuisine.
Waking Up to the Sound of Howler Monkeys
You can leave the alarm clock at home. At many jungle lodges, the first 
sound you’ll hear is the deep guttural roar of a howler monkey. First 
reactions can range from fear to awe to laughter. If they start going off 
around 4 a.m., you might simply be annoyed. . . .
Catching Your First Wave
Costa Rica’s miles of coastline are loaded with wonderful surf spots. 
Many of these are excellent waves for beginners. Sign up for a class and 
you could be hanging ten before you know it.

 Chapter 23: Ten Costa Rican Moments 359
Zipping among Treetops on a Canopy Tour
Canopy tours are the rage in Costa Rica. If you’re reasonably fit and 
not particularly acrophobic (afraid of heights), there’s no reason not to 
strap on a climbing harness, hook on your pulley system, and glide off 
into the void.
Watching a Sea Turtle Come Ashore to Nest
Following ancient rhythms and routes, sea turtles come ashore at vari-
ous beaches around Costa Rica to dig their nests and lay a clutch of 
eggs. Tortuguero is the prime destination for observing this phenomenal 
feat. See Chapter 21 for more information.
Enjoying a Pacific Ocean Sunset
Villa Caletas (% 2637-0606; www.hotelvillacaletas.com) offers 
up perhaps the most popular sunset spectacle. But you can enjoy the 
beauty of a sunset over the Pacific Ocean from almost any beach in 
Guanacaste, as well as from most hotels and lodges in Manuel Antonio 
and Drake Bay, as well as along the Osa Peninsula. See Chapter 16 for 
more information on Villa Caletas.
Marveling at the City Lights at a Mirador
If you’re spending a night in San José, grab a cab and head for the 
hills. A mirador is the local name for a restaurant with a view. Mirador 
Ram Luna (% 2230-3060), in the town of Asseri, and Mirador Tiquicia 
(% 2289-5839), above Escazú, are two good options. See Chapter 12 for 
details on each.
Soaking in the Pool of a Jungle Waterfall
If you have to hike a little bit first, it makes the dip that much more 
refreshing. The waterfall at Montezuma is one of the popular places to 
take a plunge. But I prefer the lesser-known La Cangrejo Falls inside 
Rincón de la Vieja National Park. See Chapter 11 for more information.
Catching the Glint of Sunlight 
off a Quetzal’s Feathers
The iridescent feathers of a Resplendent Quetzal can range from blue to 
green to turquoise to deep indigo, with various shades in between, 

Part VIII: The Part of Tens 
360
depending upon the angle of the light. This, combined with its bright red 
chest feathers and brilliant yellow beak, make the Quetzal one of the 
most spectacular birds on the planet.
Watching Arenal Volcano Blow Its Top
It takes patience and luck, but if you get to catch a clear night with 
active eruptions, you’re in for a treat. I recommend getting a room with a 
view at Tabacón Grand Spa Thermal Resort (% 877-277-8291 in the 
U.S. and Canada; www.tabacon.com); that way you can just roll over 
and watch whenever a loud blast wakes you. See Chapter 18 for more 
information.

of 10 p.m. and 5 a.m. Other networks still 
dispense money 24 hours a day.
Credit Cards
Visa and MasterCard are the most widely 
accepted cards in Costa Rica, followed by 
American Express, and to a much lesser 
extent Diners Club. To report a lost or 
stolen American Express card from inside 
Costa Rica, you can call % 0800-012-3211; 
for MasterCard, call % 0800-011-0184; for 
Visa, call % 0800-011-0030; and for Diners 
Club, call Credomatic, % 2295-9898.
Credomatic (% 2295-9898) is the local 
representative of most major credit 
cards: American Express, Diners Club, 
MasterCard, and Visa. It has an office in 
San José across from the Banco de San 
José on Calle Central, between avenidas 
3 and 5. It’s open Monday through Friday 
from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m., and Saturday from 
9 a.m. to 1 p.m. You can call Credomatic 
to report all lost or stolen cards 24 hours 
a day.
Currency Exchange
You can change money at all banks in 
Costa Rica. Sometimes, especially at state-
run banks, the service and process can be 
slow and tedious. Private banks have much 
more agile service.
Hotels will usually exchange money as 
well. You won’t have to wait in line, but 
they may shave a few colones off the 
exchange rate.

Costa Rica For Dummies, 3rd Edition 
362
There’s a Global Exchange currency 
exchange booth just outside the Customs 
and Immigration area of the Juan 
Santamaría International Airport in San 
José, but they give a very anemic 
exchange rate.
Be very careful about exchanging money 
on the streets; it’s extremely risky. In addi-
tion to forged bills and short counts, street 
money-changers frequently work in teams 
that can leave you holding neither colones 
nor dollars.
Customs
Visitors entering Costa Rica are officially 
entitled to bring in 500 grams of tobacco, 5 
liters of liquor, and $500 in merchandise. 
Cameras, computers, and electronic 
equipment for personal use are permitted 
duty free. Customs officials in Costa Rica 
seldom check tourists’ luggage.
For information on what returning U.S. 
citizens are allowed to bring back from 
Costa Rica, download the invaluable free 
pamphlet “Know Before You Go” online 
at www.cbp.gov, or contact the U.S. 
Customs & Border Protection (CBP), 1300 
Pennsylvania Ave. NW, Washington, DC 
20229 (% 877-287-8667) and request the 
pamphlet.
Canadian citizens can send for the booklet 
“I Declare,” issued by the Canada Border 
Services Agency (% 800-461-9999 in 
Canada; www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca).
U.K. citizens should contact HM Customs 
& Excise at % 0845-010-9000 (from outside 
the U.K., 020-8929-0152), or consult their 
Web site at www.hmce.gov.uk.
Australian tourists can get “Know Before 
You Go,” a helpful brochure available from 
Australian consulates or Customs offices, 
or contact the Australian Customs Service 
at % 1300-363-263 or www.customs.
gov.au.
New Zealanders can get the New Zealand 
Customs Guide for Travellers, Notice no. 4 
from New Zealand Customs, The 
Customhouse, 17–21 Whitmore St., Box 
2218, Wellington (% 04-473-6099 or 0800-
428-786; www.customs.govt.nz).
Driving
Driving a car in Costa Rica is no idle propo-
sition. The roads are riddled with potholes, 
most rural intersections are unmarked, 
and, for some reason, sitting behind the 
wheel of a car seems to turn peaceful 
Ticos into homicidal maniacs.
A current foreign driver’s license is valid 
for the first three months you’re in Costa 
Rica. Seat belts are required for the driver 
and front-seat passengers.
If you’re involved in an accident, you 
should contact the Instituto Nacional de 
Seguros (National Insurance Institute, 
or INS) at % 800-800-8000. You should 
probably also call the Transit Police 
(% 800-8726-7486 toll-free nationwide, or 
2222-9330); if they have a unit close by, 
they’ll send an officer. An official transit 
police report will greatly facilitate any 
insurance claim. If you can’t get help from 
any of these, try to get written statements 
from any witnesses. Finally, you can also 
call % 911, and they should be able to 
redirect your call to the appropriate 
agency.
Electricity
The standard in Costa Rica is the same as 
in the United States: 110 volts AC (60 
cycles). However, three-pronged outlets 
can be scarce, so bringing along an 
adapter is helpful.

 Appendix: Quick Concierge 363
Embassies and Consulates
The following embassies and consulates 
are located in San José: U.S. Embassy, in 
front of Centro Commercial, on the road to 
Pavas (% 2519-2000, or 2220-3127 after 
hours in case of emergency); Canadian 
Consulate, Oficentro Ejecutivo La Sabana, 
Edificio 5 (% 2242-4400); and British 
Embassy, Paseo Colón, between calles 38 
and 40 (% 2258-2025). There are no 
Australian or New Zealand embassies in 
San José.
Emergencies
In case of any emergency, dial % 911 
(which should have an English-speaking 
operator); for an ambulance, call % 128; 
and to report a fire, call % 118. If 911 
doesn’t work, you can contact the police 
at % 2222-1365 or 2221-5337, and they 
may be able to find someone who speaks 
English.
Information
See “Where to Get More Information,” 
later in this chapter.
Internet Access and Cybercafes
Internet cafes can be found all over San 
José and at most major tourist destinations 
in Costa Rica. Rates run between 50¢ and 
$3 per hour. Many hotels either have their 
own Internet cafe or have Wi-Fi or in-room 
high-speed Ethernet service. If your hotel 
doesn’t provide the service and no Internet 
cafe is close by, you can buy prepaid 
cards in 5-, 10-, and 15-hour denominations 
for connecting your laptop to the Web via 
a local phone call. Some knowledge of 
configuring your computer’s dial-up con-
nection is necessary. Be sure to factor in 
the phone-call charge if calling from a 
hotel. These cards are sold at many super-
markets and drugstores around the coun-
try, or contact Racsa (% 2287-0087; www.
racsa.co.cr), the state Internet 
monopoly, to find out where you can 
buy one.
Language
Spanish is the official language of Costa 
Rica. In most tourist areas, many Costa 
Ricans speak English very well, however. 
Frommer’s Spanish PhraseFinder & 
Dictionary (Wiley) is a good book to bring 
with you.
Liquor Laws
Alcoholic beverages are sold every day of 
the week throughout the year, with the 
exception of the two days before Easter 
and the two days before and after a presi-
dential election. The legal drinking age is 
18, although it’s almost never enforced. 
Liquor — everything from beer to hard 
spirits — is sold in specific liquor stores, 
as well as at most supermarkets and even 
convenience stores.
Maps
The Costa Rican Tourist Board (% 800-
343-6332; www.visitcostarica.
com) can usually provide you with decent 
maps of both Costa Rica and San José. 
They have booths at both international air-
ports, as well as in downtown San José.
Other sources in San José for detailed 
maps include Seventh Street Books, 
Calle 7, between avenidas Central and 1 
(% 2256-8251), and Librería Universal, 
Avenida Central, between calles Central 
and 1 (% 2222-2222).
Police
In most cases, dial % 911 for the police, 
and you should be able to get someone 
who speaks English on the line. Other num-
bers for the Judicial Police are % 2222-
1365 and 2221-5337. The numbers for the 

Costa Rica For Dummies, 3rd Edition 
364
Traffic Police (Policía de Tránsito) are 
% 800-8726-7486 toll-free nationwide, or 
2222-9330.
Post Office
A post office is called a correo in Spanish. 
The main post office in San José is on 
Calle 2, between avenidas 1 and 3 (% 800-
900-2000 toll-free in Costa Rica; www.
correos.go.cr).
Mailing a postcard or letter to the United 
States costs 170 colones (30¢); 190 colones 
(35¢) to Europe. Given the Costa Rican 
postal service’s track record, I recommend 
paying an extra 500 colones (90¢) to have 
anything of any value certified.
For important documents or goods, you 
could use one of the international courier 
services. DHL, on Paseo Colón, between 
calles 30 and 32 (% 2209-0000; www.
dhl.com); EMS Courier, with desks 
at most post offices (% 800-900-2000; 
www.correos.go.cr); FedEx, which 
is based in Heredia but will arrange 
pickup anywhere in the metropolitan area 
(% 800-463-3339; www.fedex.com); 
and UPS, in Pavas (% 2290-2828; www.
ups.com), all operate in Costa Rica.
Safety
Although Costa Rica is relatively safe, 
petty crime and robberies are common. 
And tourists are targeted for robbery 
across the country. San José is known for 
its pickpockets, so never carry a wallet in 
your back pocket. A woman should keep a 
tight grip on her purse. (Keep it tucked 
under your arm.) Thieves also target gold 
chains, cameras, video cameras, promi-
nent jewelry, and nice sunglasses. Be sure 
not to leave valuables unlocked in your 
hotel room. Don’t park a car on the street 
in Costa Rica, especially in San José; 
there are plenty of public parking lots 
around the city.
Rental cars generally stick out, and they’re 
easily spotted by thieves, who know that 
such cars are likely to be full of expensive 
camera equipment, money, and other valu-
ables. Don’t ever leave anything of value in 
a car parked on the street, not even for a 
moment. Also, be wary of solicitous 
strangers who stop to help you change a 
tire or bring you to a service station. 
Although most are truly good Samaritans, 
there have been reports of thieves preying 
on roadside breakdowns.
Public intercity buses are also frequent 
targets of stealthy thieves. Never check 
your bags into the hold of a bus if you can 
avoid it. If this can’t be avoided, keep your 
eye on what leaves the hold. If you put 
your bags in an overhead rack, be sure 
you can see the bags at all times. Try not 
to fall asleep.
Finally, don’t leave anything of value unat-
tended on beaches or park benches or 
while dining or touring.
Smoking
Although smoking isn’t as prevalent as it is 
in most of Europe, a large number of Costa 
Ricans smoke, and public smoking regula-
tions and smoke-free zones have yet to 
take hold. Restaurants are required by law 
to have nonsmoking areas, but enforce-
ment is often lax, so separate rooms aren’t 
always available and air circulation may 
be poor. Bars are often very smoke-filled in 
Costa Rica.
Taxes
There is a 13 percent value-added tax on 
most goods and services. Restaurants 
charge 13 percent tax and also add on a 

 Appendix: Quick Concierge 365
10 percent service charge, for a total of 
23 percent more on your dining bill.
There is a $26 departure tax for all visitors 
leaving by air. This tax must be purchased 
prior to check-in. There are desks at the 
main terminal of all international airports 
where you can pay this tax. Some local 
travel agencies and hotels offer to pur-
chase the departure tax in advance, as a 
convenience for tourists. You must give 
them authorization, as well as your pass-
port number, and pay a small service fee.
Telephone
Costa Rica has an excellent phone system, 
with a dial tone similar to that heard in the 
United States.
To call Costa Rica from another country, 
dial the international access code (011 in 
Canada and the U.S., 0011 in Australia, 
0170 in New Zealand, 00 in the U.K.) fol-
lowed by the country code 506, and the 
local eight-digit number.
To make a direct international call from 
within Costa Rica, dial the international 
access code 00, followed by the country 
code (1 for the U.S. and Canada, 61 for 
Australia, 64 for New Zealand, 44 for the 
U.K.), and finally the local number.
To make a call within Costa Rica, simply 
dial the eight-digit number. There are no 
area or long-distance codes.
A phone call within Costa Rica costs 
around 10 colones (20¢) per minute. Pay 
phones take either a phone card or 5-, 10-, 
or 20-colón coins. Phone cards are the 
way to go, as coin-operated phones are 
getting harder to find. You can purchase 
phone cards in a host of gift shops and 
pharmacies. However, there are several 
competing phone-card companies, and 
certain cards work only with certain 
phones. CHIP phone cards work with a 
computer chip and just slide into specific 
phones, although these phones aren’t 
widely available. A better bet are the 197 
and 199 phone cards, which are sold in 
varying denominations. These have 
scratch-off PINs and can be used from any 
phone in the country. In general terms, the 
197 cards are sold in smaller denomina-
tions and are used for local calls, while the 
199 cards are deemed international and 
are easier to find in larger denominations. 
Either card can be used to make any call, 
however, provided that the card can cover 
the costs. Another perk of the 199 cards is 
the fact that you can get the instructions in 
English. For local calls, calling from your 
hotel is often easiest, although you’ll likely 
be charged around 100 to 300 colones 
(20¢–55¢) per call.
Numbers beginning with 0800 and 800 
within Costa Rica are toll-free, but calling 
an 800 number in the States from Costa 
Rica is not toll-free. In fact, it costs the 
same as an overseas call.
Time Zone
Costa Rica is on central standard time 
(same as Chicago and St. Louis), six hours 
behind Greenwich mean time. Costa Rica 
does not use daylight saving time, so the 
time difference is an additional hour April 
through October.
Water
Although the water in San José is gener-
ally safe to drink, water quality varies out-
side the city. Because many travelers have 
tender digestive tracts, I recommend play-
ing it safe and sticking to bottled drinks as 
much as possible. If you’re really suscepti-
ble, you may also want to avoid ice.

Where to Get More Information
You can get a basic packet of information on Costa Rica by contacting 
the Costa Rican Tourist Board (ICT, or Instituto Costarricense de 
Turismo; % 800-343-6332; www.visitcostarica.com). Travelers 
from the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand will have to rely 
primarily on this Web site because the ICT does not have offices or a 
toll-free number in these countries.
In addition to this official site, you’ll be able to find a wealth of Web-
based information on Costa Rica with a few clicks of your mouse. In fact, 
you’ll do better surfing because the ICT site is rather limited and clunky.
Some good places to start include the Tico Times (www.ticotimes.
net), which puts up the top story from its weekly print edition, as 
well as a daily update of news briefs, a business article, regional news, 
a fishing column, and travel reviews. There’s also a link to current 
currency-exchange rates. The Latin America Network Information Center 
(http://lanic.utexas.edu/la/ca/cr) is hosted by the University 
of Texas Latin American Studies Department and houses a vast collec-
tion of diverse information about Costa Rica. This is, hands-down, the 
best one-stop shop for Web browsing. It also has helpful links to a wide 
range of tourism and general information sites. Finally, Costa Rica Maps 
(www.mapcr.com) is the best site I’ve found for online maps. In addition 
to selling a wonderful waterproof map to the country, this site features 
several excellent downloadable nationwide, regional, and city maps, and 
a host of other useful information.
