Preface
To the Instructor
We share a partnership with you. For over thirty years we have taught math-
ematics courses at North Shore Community College. Each semester we join
you in the daily task of sharing the knowledge of mathematics with students
who often struggle with this subject. We enjoy teaching and helping students
and we are confident that you share these joys with us.
Mathematics instructors and students face many challenges today. Basic
College Mathematics was written with these needs in mind. This textbook ex-
plains mathematics slowly, clearly, and in a way that is relevant to everyday
life for the college student. As with previous editions, special attention has
been given to problem solving in the fourth edition. This text is written to
help students organize the information in any problem-solving situation, to re-
duce anxiety, and to provide a guide that enables students to become confi-
dent problem solvers.
One of the hallmark characteristics of Basic College Mathematics that
makes the text easy to learn and teach from is the building-block organization.
Each section is written to stand on its own, and each homework set is com-
pletely self-testing. Exercises are paired and graded and are of varying levels
and types to ensure that all skills and concepts are covered. As a result, the
text offers students an effective and proven learning program suitable for a
variety of course formats—including lecture-based classes; discussion-ori-
ented classes: distance learning centers; modular, self-paced courses; mathe-
matics laboratories: and computer-supported centers.
Basic College Mathematics is the first text in a series that includes the
following:
Tobey/Slater. Basic College Mathematics. Fourth Edition
Blair/Tobey/Slater. Prealgebra. Second Edition
Tobey/Slater, Beginning Algebra. Fifth Edition
Tobey/Slater, Intermediate Algebra. Fourth Edition
Tobey/Slater. Beginning and Intermediate Algebra
We have visited and listened to teachers across the country and have in-
corporated a number of suggestions into this edition to help you with the par-
ticular learning delivery system at your school. The following pages describe
the key continuing features and changes in the fourth edition.
Key Features and Changes in the Fourth Edition
Developing Problem-Solving Abilities
We are committed as authors to producing a textbook that emphasizes math-
ematical reasoning and problem-solving techniques as recommended by
AMATYC. NCTM. AMS. NADE, MAA. and other bodies. To this end, the
problem sets are built on a wealth of real-life and real-data applications.
Unique problems have been developed and incorporated into the exercise
sets that help train students in data interpretation, mental mathematics, esti-
mation, geometry and graphing, number sense, critical thinking, and decision
making.

Preface
More Applied Problems
The exercises and applications have been extensively revised. Numerous real-
world and real-data application problems show students the relevance of the
math they are learning. The applications relate to everyday life, global issues
beyond the borders of the United States, and other academic disciplines. Many
include source citations. Nearly 50 percent of the applications are revised or
new. The number of real-data applications has significantly increased. Rough-
ly 30 percent of the applications have been contributed by actual students
based on scenarios they have encountered in their home or work lives.
Math in the Media
New Math in the Media applications appear at the end of each chapter to
offer students yet another opportunity to see why developing mastery of
mathematical concepts enhances their understanding of the world around
them. The applications are based on information from familiar media
sources—either online or print. The exercises may ask students to interpret
or verify information, perform calculations, make decisions or predictions, or
provide a rationale for their response.
Putting Your Skills to Work
This highly successful feature has been revised and expanded in the fourth edi-
tion. There are 10 new Putting Your Skills to Work applications in the new edi-
tion. These nonroutine application problems challenge students to synthesize
the knowledge they have gained and apply it to a totally new area. Each prob-
lem is specifically arranged for independent and cooperative learning or group
investigation of mathematical problems that pique student interest. Students
are given the opportunity to help one another discover mathematical solutions
to extended problems. The investigations feature open-ended questions and
extrapolation of data to areas beyond what is normally covered in such a
course.
Internet Connections
As an integral part of each Putting Your Skills to Work problem, students are
exposed to an interesting application of the Internet and encouraged to con-
tinue their investigation. This use of technology inspires students' confidence
in their abilities to successfully use mathematics. In the fourth edition, the In-
ternet Connections have been completely revised and updated.
The companion Web site now features annotated links to help students
navigate the
sites more efficiently and to provide a more user-friendly
experience, http: //www.prenhall .com/tobey_basic
Increased Integration and Emphasis on Geometry
Due to the emphasis on geometry on many statewide exams, geometry prob-
lems are integrated throughout the text. The new edition contains over 20
percent more geometry problems. Additionally, examples and exercises that
incorporate a principle of geometry are now marked with a triangle icon for
easy identification.
Mathematics Blueprint for Problem Solving
The successful Mathematics Blueprint for Problem Solving strengthens
problem-solving skills by providing a consistent and interactive outline to
help students organize their approach to problem solving. The blueprint now

Preface
xm
appears in at least one section of every chapter of the fourth edition. Once stu-
dents fill in the blueprint, they can refer back to their plan as they do what is
needed to solve the problem. Because of its flexibility, this feature can be used
with single-step problems, multistep problems, applications, and nonroutine
problems that require problem solving strategies. Students will not need to use
the blueprint to solve every problem. It
is available for those faced with a
problem with which they are not familiar, to alleviate anxiety, to show them
where to begin, and to assist them in the steps of reasoning.
Developing Your Study Skills
This highly successful feature has been retained in the new edition. The boxed
notes are integrated throughout the text to provide students with techniques
for improving their study skills and succeeding in math courses.
Graphs, Charts, and Tables
When students encounter mathematics in real-world publications, they often
encounter data represented in a graph, chart, or table and are asked to make
a reasonable conclusion based on the data presented. This emphasis on graph-
ical interpretation is a continuing trend with today's expanding technology.
The number of mathematical problems based on charts, graphs, and tables
has been significantly increased in this edition. Students are asked to make
simple interpretations, to solve medium-level problems, and to investigate
challenging applied problems based on the data shown in a chart, graph, or
table.
New Design
The fourth edition has a new design that enhances the accessible, student-
friendly writing style. This new design includes new chapter opening applica-
tions and an improved and enhanced art program. See the walkthrough of
features within this preface.
Mastering Mathematical Concepts
Chapter Pretests
Each chapter opens with a concise pretest to familiarize the student with the
learning objectives for that particular chapter.
Learning Objectives
Concise learning objectives listed at the beginning of each section allow stu-
dents to preview the goals of that section.
Examples and Exercises
The examples and exercises in this text have been carefully chosen to guide
students through Basic College Mathematics. We have incorporated several
different types of exercises and examples to assist your students in retaining
the content of this course.
Practice Problems
Practice problems are found throughout the chapter, after the examples, and
are designed to provide your students with immediate practice of the skills
presented. The complete worked-out solution of each practice problem ap-
pears in the back of the book.

xiv
Preface
To Think About
These critical thinking questions may follow examples in the text and appear
in the exercise sets. They extend the concept being taught, providing the op-
portunity for all students to stretch their minds, to look for patterns, and to
make conclusions based on their previous experience. The number of these
exercises has significantly increased in this edition.
Exercise Sets
Exercise sets are paired and graded. This design helps to ease the students into
the problems; and the answers provide students with immediate feedback.
Cumulative Review Problems
Almost every exercise set concludes with a section of cumulative review prob-
lems. These problems review topics previously covered, and are designed to
assist students in retaining the material. Many additional applied problems
have been added to the cumulative review sections.
Calculator Problems
Calculator boxes are placed in the margin of the text to alert students to a sci-
entific calculator application. In the exercise section a scientific calculator icon
is used to indicate problems that are designed for solving with a calculator.
There is also instruction on how to use a scientific calculator in the appendix.
Reviewing Mathematical Concepts
At the end of each chapter we have included problems and tests to provide
your students with several different formats to help them review and rein-
force the ideas that they have learned. This assists them not only with that
specific chapter, but reviews previously covered topics as well.
Chapter Organizers
The concepts and mathematical procedures covered are reviewed at the end
of each chapter in a unique chapter organizer. This device has been extremely
popular with faculty and students alike. It not only lists concepts and meth-
ods, but provides a completely worked-out example for each type of prob-
lem. Students find that preparing a similar chapter organizer on their own in
higher-level math courses becomes an invaluable way to master the content
of a chapter of material.
Verbal and Writing Skills
The exercises provide students with the opportunity to extend a mathemati-
cal concept by allowing them to use their own words, to clarify their thinking,
and to become familiar with mathematical terms. These exercises have been
included at the beginning of exercise sets to set the stage for the practice that
follows, or at the end of the practice as a summary. The number of these ex-
ercises has increased in the fourth edition.
Review Problems
These problems are grouped by section as a quick refresher at the end of the
chapter. They can also be used by the student as a quiz of the chapter material.
Tests
Found at the end of the chapter, the chapter test is a representative review of
the material from that particular chapter that simulates an actual testing for-

Preface
XV
mat. This provides the students with a gauge to their preparedness for the ac-
tual examination.
Cumulative Tests
At the end of each chapter is a cumulative test. One-half of the content of each
cumulative test is based on the math skills learned in previous chapters. By
completing these tests for each chapter, the students build confidence that
they have mastered not only the contents of the chapter but those of previ-
ous chapters as well.
Additional Content Changes in the Fourth Edition
• Throughout the text, explanations, definitions, and procedures have been
carefully revised for clarity and precision.
• The coverage of fractions in Chapter 2 has been expanded as follows:
Section 2.6 now begins with a discussion of least common multiples so
that the subsequent coverage of least common denominators is more
complete.
A new lesson on order of operations in Section 2.8 offers students ad-
ditional review of these rules and practice applying them to fractions.
A new midchapter test on fractions appears after Section 2.5.
• Estimating is an important skill that allows students to check the rea-
sonableness of their answers. The new edition contains increased cover-
age of estimating with fractions and decimals with new To Think About
exercises in Sections 2.5. 2.8. and 3.3 and a new lesson in Section 3.7.
• Percent applications are now covered in two sections (Sections 5.4 and
5.5) to allow for a more relaxed presentation of these important topics.
• Because of the increased interest in geometry and the emphasis on this
topic in many statewide exams, the coverage of geometry in Chapter 7
has been expanded and reorganized. The chapter now contains more
coverage of angles and triangles as well as new coverage of rhombuses.
• The number of geometry problems integrated throughout the text has
increased by over 20 percent. Examples and exercises that incorporate
a principle of geometry are now marked by a triangle icon for easy
identification.
Expanded and Enhanced Supplements Resource Package
The fourth edition is supported by a wealth of new supplements designed for
added effectiveness and efficiency. New items include the MathPro 4.0 Ex-
plorer tutorial software together with a unique video clip feature. MathPro 5

Applied Problems Involving Fractions
Solving Real-Life Problems with Fractions
All problem solving requires the same kind of thinking. In this section we will
combine problem-solving skills with our new computational skills with frac-
tions. Sometimes the difficulty is in figuring out what must be done. Sometimes
it is in doing the computation. Remember that estimating is important in prob-
lem solving. We may use the following steps.
1.
Understand the problem

(a) Read the problem carefully.
(b) Draw a picture if this helps you.

Putting Your Skills to Work
The Thinning Ice Cap
Jine to top scientists, the great ice cap that
stretches across the top of the earth has beco-
t
luficantiv thinner than it was several decades ago.
From 1958 to 1976. the average thickness of the
Arctic Sea ice was approximately 10 feet. During
the period 1993 to 1997. it was about 6 feet. Scien-
tists estimate that since that time, the ice has been
thinning at the rate of about 4 inches a year.
This phenomenon is directly or indirectly related
to global w arming. In 2000. it was estimated that the
temperature of the Earth had risen by 1.75 degrees
Fahrenheit over the previous century. Most scientists
(but not all) expect that the average temperature of
the Earth will rise by another ? .5 degrees Fahrenheit
by 2100 if emissions of heat-trapping gases such as
carbon dioxide continue at present rates.

To the Student
This book was written with your needs and interests in mind. The original
manuscript and the first three editions of this book have been class-tested
with students all across the country. Based on the suggestions of many stu-
dents, the book has been refined and improved to maximize your learning
while using this text.
We realize that students who enter college have sometimes never en-
joyed math or never done well in a math course. You may find that you are
anxious about taking this course. We want you to know that this book has
been written to help you overcome those difficulties. Literally thousands of
students across the country have found an amazing ability to learn math as
they have used previous editions of this book. We have incorporated several
learning tools and various types of exercises and examples to assist you in
learning this material.
It helps to know that learning mathematics is going to help you in life.
Perhaps you have entered this course feeling that little or no mathematics
will be necessary for you in your future job. However, elementary school
teachers, bus drivers, laboratory technicians, nurses, telephone operators, cable
TV repair personnel, photographers, pharmacists, salespeople, doctors,
architects, inspectors, counselors, and custodians who once believed that they
needed little if any mathematics are finding that the mathematical skills pre-
sented in this course can help them. Mathematics, you will find, can help you
too. In this book, a great number of examples and problems come from every-
day life. You will be amazed at the number of ways mathematics is used in the
world each day.
Our greatest wish is that you will find success and personal satisfaction
in your mathematics course. We have written this book to help you accomplish
that very goal.
Suggestions for Students
1. Be sure to take the time to read the boxes marked Developing Your
Study Skills. These ideas come from faculty and students throughout the
United States. They have found ways to succeed in mathematics and they
want to share those ideas with you.
2. Read through each section of the book that is assigned by your instruc-
tor. You will be amazed at how much information you will learn as you
read.
It will "fill in the pieces" of mathematical knowledge. Reading a
math book is a key part of learning.
3. Study carefully each sample example. Then work out the related prac-
tice problem. Direct involvement in doing problems and not just think-
ing about them is one of the greatest guarantees of success in this course.
4. Work out all assigned homework problems. Verify your answers in the
back of the book. Ask questions when you don't understand or when
you are not sure of an answer.
5. Be sure to take advantage of end-of-chapter helps. Study the chapter or-
ganizers. Do the chapter review problems and the practice test problems.
6.
If you need help, remember that teachers and tutors can assist you. There
is a Student Solutions Manual for this textbook that you will find most
xxix

XXX
To the Student
valuable. This manual shows worked-out solutions for all the odd-num-
bered exercises as well as diagnostic pretest, chapter review, chapter test,
and cumulative test problems in this book. (If your college bookstore
does not carry the Student Solutions Manual, ask them to order a copy
for you.)
7. Watch the videotapes or digitized videos on CD-ROM. Every section
of this text is explained in detail on videotape. The work is solved using
the same methods as explained in the text.
8. Use MathPro Explorer 4.0 a tutorial software package that allows you
to be tutored for any section in the book. It allows you to test yourself
on your mastery of any section of any chapter of the text. Practice prob-
lem solving using the resources available to you.
9. Remember, learning mathematics takes time. However, the time spent
is well worth the effort. Take the time to study, do homework, review, ask
questions, and just reflect over what you have learned. The time you in-
vest in learning mathematics will reap dividends in your future courses
and your future life.
We encourage you to look over your textbook carefully. Many important
features have been designed into the book to make learning mathematics a
more enjoyable activity. There are some special features, unique to this text-
book, that student throughout the country have told us that they found
especially helpful.
Four Key Textbook Features to Help You
1.
Practice problems with worked-out solutions. Immediately following
every sample example is a similar problem called the Practice Problem.
If you can work it out correctly by following the sample example as a gen-
eral point of reference, then you will likely be able to do the homework
exercises. If you encounter some difficulty, then you will find helpful the
completely worked-out solutions to the practice problems that appear at
the end of the text.
2.
Student-friendly application problems. You will find realistic and inter-
esting application problems in every chapter of this book. Many of the
problems were actually written or suggested by students. As you devel-
op your problem-solving and reasoning skills in this course, you will en-
counter a number of real-world situations that help you to see how very
helpful mathematical skills are in today's complex world.
3. Putting Your Skills to Work problems. In each chapter are unique prob-
lem sets that ask you to analyze in depth some mathematical aspect of
daily life. You will be asked to extend your knowledge, do some creative
thinking, and work in small groups in a cooperative learning situation.
You will even have a chance to explore some Web sites and see how the
Internet can assist you in learning. These sections will awaken some new
interests and help you to develop the critical thinking skills so necessary
both in college and after you graduate.
4. The Chapter Organizer. Everything you need to learn in any one chap-
ter of this book is readily available at your fingertips in the chapter or-
ganizer. This very popular chart summarizes all methods covered in the
chapter, gives page references, and shows a sample example complete-
ly worked out for every major topic covered. Students have found this
tool a most helpful way to master the content of any chapter of the book.

Writing Numbers in Expanded Form
To count a number of objects or to answer the question "How many?" we
use a set of numbers called whole numbers. These whole numbers are as
follows.
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15,
.
.
.
There is no largest whole number. The three dots
.
.
. indicate that the set of
whole numbers goes on indefinitely. Our number system is based on tens and
ones and is called the decimal system (or the base 10 system). The numbers
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 are called digits. The position, or placement, of the dig-
its in the number tells the value of the digits. For example, in the number 521,
the "5" means 5 hundreds (500). In the number 54, the "5" means 5 tens (50).
521
,
*
,
5 means 5 hundreds or 500
54
,
*
,
5 means 5 tens or 50
For this reason, our number system is called a place-value system.
Consider the number 5643. We will use a place-value chart to illustrate
the value of each digit in the number 5643.

The value of the number is 5 thousands, 6 hundreds, 4 tens, 3 ones.
The place-value chart shows the value of each place, from ones on the
right to hundred millions on the left. When we write very large numbers, we
place a comma after every group of three digits called a period, moving from
right to left. This makes the number easier to read. It is usually agreed that a
four-digit number does not have a comma, but that numbers with five or more
digits do. So 32,000 would be written with a comma but 7000 would not.
To show the value of each digit in a number, we sometimes write the
number in expanded notation. For example, 56,327 is 5 ten thousands, 6 thou-
sands, 3 hundreds, 2 tens, and 7 ones. In expanded notation, this is
50,000 + 6000 + 300 + 20 +

Writing Word Names for Numbers and Numbers
for Word Names
A number has the same value no matter how we write it. For example, "a mil-
lion dollars" means the same as "$1,000,000." In fact, any number in our num-
ber system can be written in several ways or forms:
• Standard notation
• Expanded notation
• Word name
521
500 + 20+1
five hundred twenty-one
You may want to write a number in any of these ways. To write a check,
you need to use both standard notation and words.

CAUTION: DO NOT USE THE WORD AND FOR WHOLE NUMBERS.
S
people use the word and when giving the word name for a whole number.
For example, you might hear someone say the number 54.50" as "thirty-four
thousand, five hundred and seven." However, this is not technically correct.
In mathematics we do NOT use the word and when writing word names for
whole numbers. In Chapter 3 we will use the word and to represent the dec-
imal point. For example. 59. ~6 will have the word name "fifty-nine and

Very large numbers are used to measure quantities in some disciplines,
such as distance in astronomy and the national debt in macroeconomics W e
can extend the place-value chart to include these large numbers.

Reading Numbers in Tables
Sometimes numbers found in charts and tables are abbreviated. Look at the
chart on the next page from the U.S. Bureau of the Census. Notice that the sec-
ond line tells us the numbers represent thousands. To understand what these
numbers mean, think "thousands." If the number 23 appears under 1740 for
New Hampshire, the 23 represents 23 thousand. 23 thousand is 23.000. Note
that census figures for some colonies are not available for certain years.

(a) To read the chart, first look for Maine on the left. Read across to the col-
umn under 1780. The number is 49. In this chart 49 means 49 thousands.
49 thousands =» 49,000
(b) Read the line of the chart for Plymouth and Massachusetts. The number
for Plymouth and Massachusetts under 1720 is 91. This means 91 thou-
sands. We will write this as 91,000.
(c) Read the line of the chart for Rhode Island. The number for Rhode Is-
land under 1700 is 6. This means 6 thousands. We will write this as 6000.

Mastering Basic Addition Facts
We see the addition process time and time again. Carpenters add to find the
amount of lumber they need for a job. Auto mechanics add to make sure they
have enough parts in the inventory. Bank tellers add to get cash totals.
What is addition? We do addition when we put sets of objects together.
5 objects
+
7 objects
=
12 objects
5 + 7 = 12
Usually when we add numbers, we put one number under the other in
a column. The numbers being added are called addends. The result is called
the sum.
Suppose that we have four pencils in the car and we bring three more
pencils from home. How many pencils do we have with us now? We add 4
and 3 to obtain a value of 7. In this case, the numbers 4 and 3 are the addends
and the answer 7 is the sum.
4
addend
+ 3
addend
7
sum
Think about what we do when we add
to another number. We are
not making a change, so whenever we add zero to another number, that
number will be the sum. Since this is always true, this is called a property.
Since the sum
is identical to the number added to zero, this
is called the
identity property of zero.

To use the table to find the sum 4 +
7. read across the top of the table
to the 4 column, and then read down the left to the 7 row. The box where
the 4 and 7 meet is
1 1
. which means that 4 + 7 =
11. Now read across the
top to the 7 column and down the left to the 4 row. The box where these
numbers meet
is also
11. We can see that the order in which we add the
numbers does not change the sum. 4 + 7 =
11. and 7 + 4 =
11. We call
this the commutative property of addition.
This property does not hold true for everything in our lives. When you
put on your socks and then your shoes, the result is not the same as if you put
on
\ our shoes first and then your socks! Can you think of any other examples
where changing the order in which you add things would change the result?
Adding Several Single-Digit Numbers
If more than two numbers are to be added, we usually add from the first num-
ber to the next number and mentally note the sum. Then we add that sum to
the next number, and so on.
• EXAMPLE 2
Add
3 + 4 + 8 + 2 + 5
We rewrite the addition problem in a column format.
3
4
8
2
+5
22
3 + 4 = 7
Mentally, we do these steps.
7 + 8 =
15
15 + 2 =
17
17 + 5 = 22
Practice Problem 2
Add.
7 + 6 + 5 + 8 + 2
Because the order in which we add numbers doesn't matter, we can
choose to add from the top down, from the bottom up. or in any other way.
One shortcut
is to add first any numbers that will give a sum of 10. or 20. or
30. and so on.

Adding Numbers of Several Digits When Carrying
is Not Needed
Of course, many numbers that we need to add have more than one digit. In
such cases, we must be careful to first add the digits in the ones column, then
the digits in the tens column, then those in the hundreds column, and so on.
Notice that we move from right to left.

Adding Numbers of Several Digits When Carrying Is Needed
When you add several whole numbers, often the sum in a column is greater
than 9. However, we can only use one digit in any one place. What do we do
with a two-digit sum? Look at the following example.
• EXAMPLE 5
Add. 45 + 37
->
1
4
5
+ 3
7
5 ones and 7 ones =
12.
We rename 12 in expanded notation:
1 ten + 2 ones.
We place the 2 ones in the ones column.
We carry the
1 ten over to the tens column.

Section 1.2
Addition of Whole Numbers
Xote:
Placing the
1 in the next column
is often called "carrying the one."

Now we can add the digits in the tens column.

Thus. 45 - 37 = 82.

In the tens column we add
J + 9 =
23. Because 23 tens
is 2 hundreds and 3 tens, we place the 3 in the tens column and
earn 2 to the top of the hundreds column.
In the hundreds column we add 2 -
2 -
6 =
10 hundreds. Because
10 hundreds is
1 thousand and
hundreds, we place the
in the
hundreds column and place the
1 in the thousands column.
Practice Problem 6
Add

•
We can add numbers in more than one way. To add 5-3-7 we can
first add the 5 and 3. We do this by using parentheses to show the first oper-
ation to be done. This shows us that 5 - 3 is to be grouped together.
5 + 3 + 7 = (5 + 3) +7 = 15
8
-
7 =
15
We could add the 3 and 7 first. We use parentheses to show that we group
3-7 together and that we will add these two numbers first.
5 + 3 + 7 = 5 + (3 + 7)=
15
= 5 +
10
=
15
The way we group numbers to be added does not change the sum. This prop-
erty is called the associate e property of addition.
Look again at the three properties of addition we have discussed in this
section.

18
Chapter
1
Whole Numbers
1. Associative Property of Addition
(8 + 2) + 6 = 8 +
(2 + 6)
When we add three numbers, we can
10 + 6 = 8 + 8
group them in any way.
16 = 16
2. Commutative Property of Addition
5 + 12 = 12 + 5
Two numbers can be added in either
17 = 17
order with the same result.
3. Identity Property of Zero
8 +
= 8
When zero is added to a number, the sum
+ 5 = 5
is that number.
Because of the commutative and associative properties of addition, we
can check our addition by adding the numbers in the opposite order.

^»^F Applying Addition to Real-Life Situations
We use addition in all kinds of situations. There are several key words in word
problems that imply addition. For example, it may be stated that there are 12
math books, 9 chemistry books, and 8 biology books on a book shelf. To find
the fota/ number of books implies that we add the numbers 12 + 9 +
8. Other
key words are how much, how many, and all.
Sometimes a problem will have more information than you will need to
answer the question. If you have too much information, to solve the problem
you will need to separate out the facts that are not important. The following
three steps are involved in the problem-solving process.
Step 1
Understand the problem.
Step 2
Calculate and state the answer.
Step 3
Check.
We may not write all of these steps down, but they are the steps we use to solve
all problems.
^^ EXAMPLE 8
The bookkeeper for Smithville Trucking was examining the
following data for the company checking account.
Monday:
$23,416 was deposited and $17,389 was debited.
Tuesday:
$44,823 was deposited and $34,089 was debited.
Wednesday:
$16,213 was deposited and $20,057 was debited.

Section 1.2
Addition of Whole Numbers
19
What was the total of all deposits during this period?
Step 1
Understand the problem.
Total implies that we will use addition. Since we don't need to know
about the debits to answer this question, we use only the deposit amounts.
Step 2
Calculate and state the answer.
i

i
Monday:
$23,416 was deposited.
23.416
Tuesday:
$44,823 was deposited.
44.823
Wednesday: $16,213 was deposited.
+ 16,213
84.452
A total of $84,452 was deposited on those three days.
Step 3
Check.
You may add the numbers in reverse order to check. We leave the
check up to you.

Understand the problem.
To help us to get a picture of what the field looks like, we will draw a
diagram.
400 ft
200 ft
200 ft
400 ft
Note that ft is the abbreviation for feet, ft means feet.
2.
Calculate and state the answer.
Since the fence will be along each side of the field.
200
we add the lengths all around the field.
400
200

Mastering Basic Subtraction Facts
Subtraction is used day after day in the business world. The owner of a bakery
placed an ad for his cakes in a local newspaper to see if this might increase his
profits. To learn how many cakes had been sold, at closing time he subtract-
ed the number of cakes remaining from the number of cakes the bakery had
when
it opened. To figure his profits, he subtracted his costs (including the
cost of the ad) from his sales. Finally, to see if the ad paid off, he subtracted
the profits he usually made in that period from the profits after advertising.
He needed subtraction to see whether it paid to advertise.
What is subtraction? We do subtraction when we take objects away from
a group. If you have 12 objects and take away 3 of them, 9 objects remain.
12 objects - 3 objects
=
12 - 3 = 9
9 objects

We can use addition to help with a subtraction problem.
To subtract:
200 — 196 = what number
We can think:
196 + what number = 200
Usually when we subtract numbers, we put one number under the other
in a column. When we subtract one number from another, the answer is called
the difference.

Subtracting Whole Numbers When Borrowing
Is Not Necessary
When we subtract numbers with more than two digits, in order to keep track
of our work, we line up the ones column, the tens column, the hundreds col-
umn, and so on. Note that we begin with the ones column, and move from
right to left.

Subtracting Whole Numbers When Borrowing Is Necessary
In the subtraction that we have looked at so far, each digit in the upper num-
ber (the minuend) has been greater than the digit in the lower number (the
subtrahend) for each place value. Many times, however, a digit in the lower
number is greater than the digit in the upper number for that place value.
42
-28
The digit in the ones place in the lower number, the 8 of 28, is greater than the
number in the ones place in the upper number, the 2 of 42. To subtract, we
must rename 42. using place values. This
is called borrowing.

To subtract 8 ones from 2 ones, we need to
borrow. Since
1 ten is 10 ones, we can
rename 42 as 3 tens and 12 ones, writing the
3 in the tens column and the 12 in the ones column.
Now we subtract 8 ones from 12 ones to obtain 4 ones.
We then subtract 2 tens from 3 tens to obtain 1 ten.

To subtract 8 ones from 4 ones, we borrow 1 ten from the

Since we are borrowing 1 ten, which is 10 ones, we now
have 14 ones, and write 14 in the ones column.
Now we subtract 8 ones from 14 ones to obtain 6 ones.
We continue to subtract from right to left.

To subtract 5 from 0, we borrow 1 ten from the 4 tens to
make 3 tens and 10 ones. 10 — 5 = 5
To subtract 7 tens from the 3 tens, we need to borrow
1 hundred to make 10 tens. Since we find a
in the hundreds
column, first we borrow
1 thousand to make 10 hundreds.
We show the number of thousands that are left, and write
the 10 in the hundreds column. Now we borrow
1 hundred,
show the number of hundreds that are left, and add the
10 tens to the 3 tens. We now do the subtraction.
1 3 tens - 7 tens = 6 tens
9 hundreds - 3 hundreds = 6 hundreds

We observe that when 9 - 7 = 2
it follows that 7 + 2 =
9. Each subtraction
problem
is equivalent to a corresponding addition problem. This gives us a
convenient way to check our answers to subtraction.

Subtraction can be used to solve word problems. Some problems can be
expressed (and solved) with an equation. An equation is a number sentence
with an equal sign, such as
10 = 4 + x
Here we use the letter x to represent a number we do not know. When we
write 10 = 4 +
.v. we are stating that 10 is equal to 4 added to some other
number. Since 10 — 4 =
6, we would assume that the number is 6. If we sub-
stitute 6 for a in the equation, we have two values that are the same.
10 = 4 + x
10 = 4 + 6
Substitute 6 for x.
10 = 10
Both sides of the equation are the same.
We can write an equation when one of the addends is not known, then
use subtraction to solve for the unknown.
^* EXAMPLE 9
The librarian knows that he has eight world atlases and that
five of them are in full color. How many are not in full color?
We represent the number that we don't know as x and write an equation,
or mathematical sentence.
8 =
5 + a
To solve an equation means to find those values that will make the equation
true. We solve this equation by reasoning and by a knowledge of the rela-
tionship between addition and subtraction.
8 = 5 + a is equivalent to 8 — 5 — x
We know that 8 — 5 =
3. Then x =
3. We can check the answer by substi-
tuting 3 for a in the original equation.
8 = 5 + a
8 = 5 + 3
True
/
We see that x = 3 checks, so our answer is correct. There are three atlases
not in full color.
Practice Problem 9
Form an equation for each of the following problems and
solve the equation in order to answer each question.
(a) The Salem Harbormaster's daily log noted that seventeen fishing vessels
left the harbor yesterday during daylight hours. Walter was at the harbor
all morning and saw twelve fishing vessels leave in the morning. How
many vessels left in the afternoon? (Assume that sunset was at 6 p.m.)
(b) The Appalachian Mountain Club noted that twenty-two hikers left to
climb Mount Washington during the morning. By 4 P.M., ten of them had
returned. How many of the hikers were still on the mountain?
•
Applying Subtraction to Real-Life Situations
We use subtraction in all kinds of situations. There are several key words in word
problems that imply subtraction. Words that involve comparison, such as how
much more, how much greater, or how much a quantity increased or decreased,
all imply subtraction. The difference between two numbers implies subtraction.

^* EXAMPLE
1 1
The number of real estate transfers in several towns during
the years 1999 to 2001 is given in the following bar graph.
Weston
Oakdale
Salem
Riverside
Springfield
(a) What was the increase in homes sold in Weston from 2000 to 2001?
(b) What was the decrease in homes sold in Salem from 1999 to 2001?
(c) Between what two years did Oakdale have the greatest increase in sales?
(a) From the labels on the bar graph we see that 284 homes were sold in 2001
in Weston and 271 homes were sold in 2000. Thus the increase can be
found by subtracting 284 - 271 =
13. There was an increase of 13 homes
sold in Weston from 2000 to 2001.
(b) In 1999, 75 homes were sold in Salem. In 2001, 62 homes were sold in
Salem. The decrease in the number of homes sold is 75 — 62 =
13. There
was a decrease of 13 homes sold in Salem from 1999 to 2001.
(c) Here we will need to make two calculations in order to decide where the
greatest increase occurs.

How To Do Homework
Set aside time each day for your homework assignments. Make a weekly schedule
and write down the times each day you
will devote to doing math homework. Two
hours spent studying outside class for each hour
in class
is usual for college
courses. You may need more than that for mathematics.
Before beginning
to solve your homework exercises, read your textbook very
carefully. Expect to spend much more time reading a few pages of a mathematics
textbook than several pages of another text. Read
for complete understanding,
not
just for the general idea.
As you begin your homework assignments, read the directions carefully. You need
to understand what
is being asked. Concentrate on each exercise, taking time to
solve
it accurately. Rushing through your work usually causes errors. Check your
answers with those given
in the back of the textbook.
If your answer
is incorrect,
check to see that you are doing the right problem. Redo the problem, watching
for
little errors.
If
it
is
still wrong, check with a friend. Perhaps the two of you can
figure out where you are going wrong.
Work on your assignments every day and do as many exercises as
it takes for you
to know what you are doing. Begin by doing
all the exercises that have been
assigned.
If there are more available
in that section of your text, then do more.
When you think you have done enough exercises to understand
fully the topic at
hand, do a few more to be sure. This may mean that you do many more exercises
than the
instructor assigns, but you can never practice mathematics too much.
Practice improves your
skills and increases your accuracy, speed, competence, and
confidence.
Also, check the examples
in the textbook or
in your notes for a
similar exercise.
Can
this one be solved
in the same way? Give
it some thought. You may want to
leave
it for a while by taking a break or doing a different exercise.
But come back
later and
try again.
If you are
still unable to figure
it out, ask your instructor for
help during office hours or
in class.

Mastering Basic Multiplication Facts
Like subtraction, multiplication is related to addition. Suppose that the pas-
try chef at the Gourmet Restaurant bakes croissants on a sheet that holds
four croissants across, with room for three rows. How many croissants does the
sheet hold?
We can add 4 + 4 + 4 to get the total, or we can use a shortcut: three
rows of four is the same as 3 times 4, which equals 12. This is multiplication.
a shortcut for repeated addition.
The numbers that we multiply are called factors. The answer is called
the product. For now, we will use
X
to show multiplication. 3 X 4 is read
"three times four."
x
12
factor
factor

3
factor
X 4 factor
12 product
Your skill in multiplication depends on how well you know the basic
multiplication facts. Look at the table on page 39. You should learn these facts
well enough to quickly and correctly give the products of any two factors in
the table. To check your knowledge, try Exercises 1.4, exercises 3 and 4.
Study the table to see if you can discover any properties of multipli-
cation. What do you see as results when you multiply zero by any number?
When you multiply any number times zero, the result
is zero. That is the
multiplication property of zero.
2X0 =
5x0 =
0x6 =
0x0 =
You may recall that zero plays a special role in addition. Zero is the
identity element for addition. When we add any number to zero, that number
does not change. Is there an identity element for multiplication? Look at the
table. What is the identity element for multiplication? Do you see that it is 1?
The Identity element for multiplication is 1.
5X1 = 5
1X5 = 5
What other properties of addition hold for multiplication? Is multiplication
commutative? Does the order in which you multiply two numbers change the
results? Find the product of 3 x
4. Then find the product of 4 X
3.
3 x 4 =
12
4 x 3 = 12
The commutative property of multiplication tells us that when we multiply two
numbers, changing the order of the numbers gives the same result.

10. 100. 1000. or any other power of 10? Consider 32 x 400. We can rewrite
400 as 4 x
100. which gives us 32 X 4 x
100. We can simply multiply 32 x 4
and then attach two zeros for the factor 100. We find that 32 X 4 =
128.
Attaching two zeros gives us 12.800. or 32 X 400 =
12.800.

^Q^ Using the Properties of Multiplication
to Perform Efficient Calculations
When we add three numbers, we use the associative property. Recall that the
associative property allows us to group the three numbers in any way. Thus
to add 9 + 7 +
3, we can group the numbers as 9 +
(7 + 3) because
it
is
easier to find the sum. 9 +
(7 + 3) = 9 + 10 =
19. We can demonstrate that
multiplication is also associative.
Is this true?
2 X
(5 x 3) =
(2 x 5) x 3
2 x (15) =
(10) x 3
30 = 30
The final product is the same in both cases.
The way we group numbers to be multiplied does not change the product.
This property is called the associative property of multiplication.
• EXAMPLE 12
Multiply.
14 x 2 x 5
Since we can group any two numbers together, let's take advantage of
multiplying by 10.
14 x 2 x 5 = 14 x
(2 x 5) = 14 x
10 = 140
Practice Problem 12
Multiply. 25 x 4 x 17
•
For convenience, we
list the properties of multiplication that we have
discussed in this section.
1. Associative Property of Multiplication.
(7 X 3) X 2 = 7 X (3 X 2)
When we multiply three numbers, the
21 x 2 = 7 x 6
multiplication can be grouped in any way.
42 = 42
2. Commutative Property of Multiplication.
9x8 = 8x9
Two numbers can be multiplied in either
72 = 72
order with the same result.
3. Identity Property of One.
When one is
7x1=7
multiplied by a number, the result is that
1x15=15
number.
4. Multiplication Property of Zero.
X
14 =
The product of any number and zero yields
2x0 =
zero as a result.

Chapter

Whole Numbers
Sometimes you can use several properties in one problem to make the
calculation easier.
• EXAMPLE 13
Multiply.
7 X 20 X 5 x 6
7 X 20 X 5 X 6 = 7 X (20 X 5) X 6
Associative property
= 7 X 6 X (20 X 5)
Commutative property
= 42 x 100
= 4200

Thus far we have discussed the properties of addition and the properties
of multiplication. There is one more property that links both operations.
Before we discuss that property, we will illustrate several different ways
of showing multiplication. The following are all the ways to show "3 times 4."

(3)4-,
,-3 -4-, ,-3* 4^

c

with a single set

We will use parentheses to mean multiplication when we use the
distributive property.
Sidelight
Why does our method of multiplying several-digit numbers work? Why can
we say that 234 x 21 is the same as 234 X
1 + 234 X 20?
The distributive property ofmultiplication over addition allows us to dis-
tribute the multiplication and then add the results. To illustrate, 234 x 21 can
be written as 234(20 +
1). By the distributive property
234(20 +
1) = (234 x 20)
+ (234 x
1)
4680
+
234
= 4914
This is what we actually do when we multiply.

Distributive Property of Multiplication over Addition
Multiplication can be distributed over addition without changing the
result.
5 X (10 + 2) =
(5 x
10) + (5X2)
Applying Multiplication to Real-Life Situations
To use multiplication in word problems, the number of items or the value of
each item must be the same. Recall that multiplication is a quick way to do
repeated addition where each addend is the same. In the beginning of the

Section
1 .4
Multiplication of Whole Numbers
45
section we showed three rows of four croissants to illustrate 3x4. The num-
ber of croissants in each row was the same. 4. Look at another example. If we
had six nickels, we could use multiplication to find the total value of the coins
because the value of each nickel
is the same. 5c. Since 6 x 5 = 30. six nick-
els are worth 30c.
In the following example the word average
is used. The word average
has several different meanings. In this example, we are told that the average
annual salary of an employee at Software Associates is $21,342. This means
that we can calculate the total payroll as if each employee made $21,342 even
though we know that the president probably makes more than any other
employee.
^^ EXAMPLE 14

Associates is $21,342. There are 38 employees. What is the annual payroll?

The average cost of a new car sold last year at Westover
Chevrolet was $17,348. The dealership sold 378 cars. What were the total sales
of cars at the dealership last year?

Another useful application of multiplication is area. The following ex-
ample involves the area of a rectangle.
A ^ EXAMPLE
1 5
What
is the area of a rectangular hallway that measures
4 feet wide and 8 feet Ions?
The area of a rectangle is the product of the length times the width. Thus for
this hallway
Area = 8 feet x 4 feet = 32 square feet
The area of the hallway
is 32 square feet.
Note:
All measurements for area are given
in square units such as square
feet, square meters, square yards, and so on.

Developing Your Study Skills
Why
Is Homework Necessary?
Mathematics involves mastering a
set of
skills that you learn by practicing, not by
watching someone else do
it. Your instructor may make solving a mathematics
problem look very easy,
but for you to learn the necessary
skills, you must practice
them over and over again,
just as your instructor once had
to. There
is no other
way. Learning mathematics
is
like learning
to play a musical
instrument,
to type, or
to play a sport. No matter how much you watch someone else do
it, no matter
how many books you read on "how to" do
it, no matter how easy
it seems to be,
the key to success
is practice on a regular basis.
Homework provides
this practice. The amount of practice needed varies for each
individual, but usually students need to do most or
all of the exercises provided at
the end of each section
in the
text. The more exercises you do, the better you get.
Some problems
in a
set are more
difficult than
others, and some stress different
concepts. Only by working
all the exercises will you cover the
full range of
difficulty.

Division of Whole Numbers
Mastering Basic Division Facts
Suppose that we have eight quarters and want to divide them into two equal
piles. We would discover that each pile contains four quarters.
Divided into
2 equal piles
>
£•-:'
• -..
8 quarters
4 quarters in each pile
In mathematics we would express this thought by saying that
8-2 =
4.
We know that this answer
is right because two piles of four quarters
is the
same dollar amount as eight quarters. In other words, we know that 8-2 = 4
because 2x4 =
8. These two mathematical sentences are called related sen-
tences. The division sentence 8
-j- 2 = 4 is related to the multiplication sen-
tence 2X4 =
8.
In fact, in mathematics we usually define division in terms of multipli-
cation. The answer to the division problem 12 + 3 is that number which when
multiplied by 3 yields 12. Thus
12 * 3 = 4 because 3x4 =
12.
Suppose that a surplus of $30 in the French Club budget at the end of the
year is to be equally divided among the five club members. We would want to
divide the $30 into five equal parts. We would write 30 — 5 = 6 because
5 X 6 =
30. Thus each of the five people would get $6 in this situation.

As a mathematical sentence. 30 - 5 =

The division problem 30 - 5 = 6 could also be written y = 6 or _y~j.
When referring to division, we sometimes use the words divisor, dividend,
and quotient to identify the three parts.
quotient
divisor Jdrviderid
With 30
-T- 5 =
6, 30 is the dividend. 5 is the divisor, and 6 is the quotient.
6 <— quotient
divisor —> 5j30 <— dividend
So the quotient is the answer to a division problem. It
is important that you
be able to do short problems involving basic division facts quickly.

Zero can be divided by any nonzero number, but division by zero is not
possible. Why is this?
Suppose that we could divide by zero. Then 7 h-
= some number. Let
us represent "some number'
1 by the letter a.
If 7
*-
=
a, then 7 =
X
a,
because every division problem has a related multiplication problem. But
zero times any number is zero,
x a =
0. Thus
7 -
x a =
0.
That
is. 7 =
0, which we know is not true. Therefore, our assumption that
7 -
= a is wrong. Thus we conclude that we cannot divide by zero. Math-
ematicians state this by saying, "Division by zero is undefined."
It is helpful to remember the following basic concepts:
Division Problems Involving the Number 1 and the Number
1. Any nonzero number divided by itself is 1(7
*- 7 = 1).
2. Any number divided by 1 remains unchanged (29
-J-
1 = 29).
3. Zero may be divided by any nonzero number; the result is always zero
(0-4 = 0).
4. Zero can never be the divisor in a division problem (3 -
is
undefined;
—
is undefined).

Performing Division by a One-Digit Number
Our accuracy with division is improved if we have a checking procedure. For
each division fact, there is a related multiplication fact.
If 20 - 4 =
5, then 20 = 4x5.
If 36 - 9 = 4, then 36 = 9x4.

Section 1.5
Division of Whole Numbers
53
We will often use multiplication to check our answers.
When two numbers do not divide exactly, a number called the remain-
der is left over. For example. 13 cannot be divided exactly by 2. The number
1
is left over. We call this
1 the remainder.

2jl3
12
1
<— remainder
Thus 13
-^ 2 = 6 with a remainder of l.We can abbreviate this answer as
6R
1.
To check this division, we multiply 2 x 6 =
12 and add the remainder:
12 -
1 =
13. That is. 2 X6 + 1 =
13. The result will be the dividend if the di-
vision was done correctly. The following box shows you how to check a divi-
sion that has a remainder.
(divisor x quotient) - remainder = dividend

Performing Division by a Two- or Three-Digit Number
When the divisor has more than one digit, an estimation technique may help.
Figure how many times the first digit of the divisor goes into the first two dig-
its of the dividend. Try this answer as the first number in the quotient.
• EXAMPLE 6
Divide. 283 + 41
First guess:
4lj283^^
287 too large
How many times can the first digit of the divisor (4)
be divided into the first two digits of the dividend
(28)? 7. We try the answer 7 as the first number of
the quotient. We multiply 7 x 41 = 287. We see
that 287 is larger than 283.
Second guess:

Because 7 is slightly too large, we try 6.

Applying Division to Real-Life Situations
When you solve a word problem that requires division, you will be given the
total number and asked to calculate the number of items in each group or to
calculate the number of groups. In the beginning of this section we showed
eight quarters (the total number) and we divided them into two equal piles
(the number of groups). Division was used to find how many quarters were
in each pile (the number in each group). That is. 8
-=- 2 =
4. There were four
quarters in each pile.
Let's look at another example. Suppose that $30 is to be divided equal-
ly among the members of a group. If each person receives $6. how many peo-
ple are in the group? We use division. 30
-f- 6 =
5. to find that there are five
people in the group.
• EXAMPLE 9
City Service Realty just purchased nine identical comput-
ers for the real estate agents in the office. The total cost for the nine comput-
ers was $25,848. What was the cost of one computer? Check your answer.
To find the cost of one computer, we need to divide the total cost by 9.
Thus we will calculate 25.848 *

Therefore, the cost of one computer is S2s"2. In order to check our work we
will need to see if nine computers each costing $2872 will in fact result in a total
of $25,848. We use multiplication to check division.

In the following example you will see the word average used as
it ap-
plies to division. The problem states that a car traveled 1144 miles in 22 hours.
The problem asks you to find the average speed in miles per hour. This means
that we will treat the problem as if the speed of the car were the same during
each hour of the trip. We will use division to solve.
^ EXAMPLE 10
A car traveled 1144 miles in 22 hours. What was the av-
erage speed in miles per hour?
When doing distance problems,
it

In order to take
meaningful
notes, you must be an active
listener. Keep your mind on what the

something.
If you have previewed the lesson
material, you will be prepared to take good
,
notes. The important concepts will seem somewhat familiar. You will have a
better
idea of what needs to be written down.
If you frantically try to write
all that the
instructor says or copy
all the examples done
in class, you may find your notes
nearly worthless when you look at them at home. You may find that you are
unable to make sense of what you have written.

that you are listening and following the
logic. Include any helpful

Evaluating Actual Costs for Several Vacation Plans
You are arranging a vacation for you and three
friends (four people total). You have agreed as a
group, that you will try to make the most of your
money and will take the best deal of three possible
packages. The Jackson Hole Ski Resort in Jackson
Hole. Wyoming, is offering three fabulous winter
vacation packages, and you must figure out the best
deal in terms of cost. Here are your choices:
1. An "'Early Bird Special" ski package for four
people costs S248 per person for four nights, in-
cluding lodging and three days of ski passes.
2. A "New Year's" package for four people costs
$510 per person for five nights, including lodg-
ing and four days of ski passes.
3. A "Presidents* Week" package for four people
costs $933 per person for seven nights, includ-
ing lodging and six days of ski passes.
Ski passes usually cost $58/day. $108 for two days.
$156 for three days. $1% for four days. $240 for five
days. $282 for six days, and $322 for seven day v
If you reserve a vacation package, the prices for
ski passes are included in the package. The cost of
meals is not included in the package.

If a whole number does not have a visible exponent, the exponent is un-

What does it mean to have an exponent of zero? What is 10°? Any whole
number that is not zero can be raised to the zero power. The result is l.Thus
10° =

1, and so on. Why is this? Let's reexamine the powers

of 10. As we go down one line at a time, notice the pattern that occurs.

^f& Performing Several Arithmetic Operations in the Proper Order
Sometimes the order in which we do things
is not important. The order in
which chefs hang up their pots and pans probably does not matter. The order
in which they add and mix the elements in preparing food, however, makes
all the difference in the world! If various cooks follow a recipe, though, they
will get similar results. The recipe assures that the results will be consistent.
It shows the order of operations.
In mathematics the order of operations is a list of priorities for working
with the numbers in computational problems. This mathematical "recipe" tells
how to handle certain indefinite computations. For example, how does a per-
son solve 5 + 3x2?
A problem such as 5 + 3 x 2 sometimes causes students difficulty. Some
people think (5 + 3) x 2 = 8 x 2 =
16. Some people think 5 +

Rounding and Estimation
Rounding Whole Numbers
Large numbers are often expressed to the nearest hundred or to the nearest
thousand, because an approximate number is "good enough" for certain uses.
Distances from the earth to other galaxies are measured in light-years.
Although light really travels at 5.865.696.000.000 miles a year, we usually
round this number to the nearest trillion and say it travels at 6.000,000,000.000
miles a year. To round a number, we first determine the place we are round-
ing to—in this case, trillion. Then we find which value
is closest to the num-
ber that we are rounding. In this case, the number we want to round is closer
to 6 trillion than to 5 trillion. How do we know the number is closer to 6 tril-
lion than to 5 trillion?
To see which is the closest value, we may picture a number line, where
whole numbers are represented by points on a line. To show how to use the
number line in rounding, we will round 368 to the nearest hundred. 368 is be-
tween 300 and 400. When we round off. we pick the hundred 368 is "closest
to." We draw a number line to show 300 and 400. We also show the point mid-
way between 300 and 400 to help us to determine which hundred 368 is clos-
est to.
368
300
350
400
We find that the number 368 is closer to 400 than to 300, so we round 368 up
to 400.
Let's look at another example. We will round 129 to the nearest hun-
dred. 129 is between 100 and 200. We show this on the number line. We include
the midpoint 150 as a guide.
129
100
150
200
We find that the number 129
is closer to 100 than to 200. so we round 129
down to 100.
This leads us to the following simple rule for rounding.
Rounding a Whole Number
1.
If the first digit to the right of the round-off place is
(a) less than 5, we make no change to the digit in the round-off
place. (We know
it is closer to the smaller number, so we round
down.)
(b) 5 or more, we increase the digit in the round-off place by
1. (We
know
it
is closer to the larger number, so we round up.)
2. Then we replace the digits to the right of the round-off place by zeros.

Estimating the Answer to a Problem Involving Calculation
with Whole Numbers
Often we need to quickly check the answer of a calculation to be reasonably
assured that the answer is correct. If you expected your bill to be "around
$40" for the groceries you had selected and the cashier's total came to $41.89.
you would probably be confident that the bill is correct and pay it. If. however,
the cashier rang up a bill of $367, you would not just assume that it is correct.
You would know an error had been made. If the cashier's total came to $60.
you might not be certain, but you would probably suspect an error and check
the calculation.
In mathematics we often estimate, or determine the approximate value
of a calculation, if we need to do a quick check. There are many ways to esti-
mate, but in this book we will use one simple principle of estimation. We use
the symbol « to mean approximately equal to.
Principle of Estimation
1. Round the numbers so that there is one nonzero digit in each number.
2. Perform the calculation with the rounded numbers.
• EXAMPLE 6
Estimate the sum. 163 + 237 + 846 + 922
We first determine where to round each number in our problem to leave
only one nonzero digit in each. In this case, we round all numbers to the near-
est hundred. Then we perform the calculation with the rounded numbers.

163
200
237

846
800
-922
+ 900
2100
We estimate the answer to be 2100. We say the sum ^2100. If we calculate
using the exact numbers, we obtain a sum of 2168. so our estimate
is quite
close to the actual sum.
Practice Problem 6
Estimate the sum. 3456 + 9876 + 5421 + 1278
•
When we use the principle of estimation, we will not always round each
number in a problem to the same place.
• EXAMPLE 7
Phil and Melissa bought their first car last week. The sell-
ing price of this compact car was $8980. The dealer preparation charge was
$289 and the sales tax was $449. Estimate the total cost of the car that Phil and
Melissa had to pay.
We round each number to have only one nonzero digit, and add the
rounded numbers.
8980
9000
289
300
+
449
+
400
9700
The total cost « $9700. (The exact answer is $9718. so we see that our an-
swer is quite close.)
Practice Problem 7
Greg and Marcia purchased a new sofa for $697. plus S35
sales tax. The store also charged them $19 to deliver the sofa. Estimate their
total cost.
^*
Now we turn to a case where an estimate can help us discover an error.
^^ EXAMPLE 8
Roberto added together four numbers and obtained the
following
result. Estimate the sum and determine
if the answer seems
reasonable.
12.456 + 17,976 + 18.452 + 32.128 = 61.012
We round each number so that there is one nonzero digit. In this case,
we round them all to the nearest ten thousand.
12,456
10.000
17.976
20.000
18,452
20.000
+ 32.128
+ 30.000
80.000
Our estimate is 80.000.
This is significantly different from 61.012. so we would suspect that an error
has been made. In fact, Roberto did make an error. The exact sum is actual-
ly SI.012!

sum appears to be correct or incorrect.
11,849 +
14.376 +
16,982 + 58,151 = 81,358
•
Next we look at a subtraction example where estimation is used.
^ EXAMPLE 9
The profit from Techno Industries for the first quarter of the
year was $642,987,000. The profit for the second quarter was $238,890,000.
Estimate how much less the profit was for the second quarter than for the
first quarter.
We round each number so that there is one nonzero digit. Then we sub-
tract, using the two rounded numbers.
642,987,000
600,000,000
- 238,890.000
- 200,000,000
400.000.000
We estimate that the profit was $400,000,000 less for the second quarter.
Practice Problem 9
The 1998 population of Florida was 14.916.235. The 1998
population of California was 32,667,584. Estimate how many more people
lived in California in 1998 than in Florida.
^^
We also use this principle to estimate results of multiplication and
division.
• EXAMPLE 10
Estimate the product.
56.789 X 529
We round each number so that there is one nonzero digit. Then we mul-
tiply the rounded numbers to obtain our estimate.
56,789
60.000
x
529
X
500
30,000.000
Therefore the product is « 30.000.000. (This is reasonably close to the exact
answer of 30,041,381.)
Practice Problem

Estimate the product. 8945 x 7317
^
^ EXAMPLE
1 1
Estimate the answer for the following division problem.
23)148,902
We round each number to a number with one nonzero digit. Then we per-
form the division, using the two rounded numbers.
5000
23)148.902
20)100.000
Our estimate
is 5000. (The exact answer is 6474. We see that our estimate is
"in the ballpark" but
is not very close to the exact answer. Remember, an
estimate is just a rough approximation of the exact answer.)

Whole Numbers
Not all division estimates come out so easily. In some cases, you may
need to carry out a long-division problem of several steps just to obtain the
estimate.
• EXAMPLE
1 2
Ralph drove his car a distance of 778 miles. He used 25 gal-
lons of gas. Estimate how many miles he can travel on 1 gallon of gas.
In order to solve this problem, we need to divide 778 by 25 to obtain the
number of miles Ralph gets with 1 gallon of gas. We round each number to a
number with one nonzero digit and then perform the division, using the
rounded numbers.
26
25J778
30J800

200
180
20
Remainder
We obtain an answer of 26 with a remainder of 20. For our estimate we will
use the whole number 27. Thus we estimate that the number of miles Ralph's
car obtained on 1 gallon of gas was 27 miles. (This is reasonably close to the
exact answer, which is just slightly more than 31 miles per gallon of gas.)

The highway department purchased 58 identical trucks
at a total cost of $1,864,584. Estimate the cost for one truck.

Solving Problems Involving One Type of Operation
When a builder constructs a new home or office building, he or she often has
a blueprint. This accurate drawing shows the basic structure of the building.
It also shows the dimensions of the structure to be built. This blueprint serves
as a useful reference throughout the construction process.
80
Similarly, when solving applied problems, it is helpful to have a "math-
ematics blueprint." This is a simple way to organize the information provid-
ed in the word problem. You record the facts you need to use and specify
what you are solving for. You also record any other information that you feel
will be helpful. We will use a Mathematics Blueprint for Problem Solving in
the following situation.
Sometimes people feel totally lost when trying to solve a word problem.
They sometimes say, "Where do
I begin?" or "How in the world do you do
this?" When you have this type of feeling, it sometimes helps to have a for-
mal strategy or plan. Here is a plan you may find helpful:
1.
Understand the problem.
(a) Read the problem carefully.
(b) Draw a picture if this helps you see the relationships more clearly.
(c)
Fill in the Mathematics Blueprint so that you have the facts and a
method of proceeding in this situation.
2. Solve and state the answer.
(a) Perform the calculations.
(b) State the answer, including the unit of measure.
3.
Check.
(a) Estimate the answer.
(b) Compare the exact answer with the estimate to see if your answer
is reasonable.
Now exactly what does the Mathematics Blueprint for Problem Solving
look like? It is a simple sheet of paper with four columns. Each column tells
you something to do.
Gather the Facts—Find the numbers that you will need to use in your
calculations.
What Am
I Asked to Do?—Are you finding an area, a volume, a cost,
the total number of people? What is it that you need to find?

Key Points to Remember—Write down things you might forget. The

MaW
Race for the Presidency Focuses
on One-Third of the Country
Al Hunts Campaign Journal
THE WALL STREET JOURNAL
This is a national election but the real
battle for the White House is focused
on only one-third of the country.
With a week and a half to go, there
are a dozen genuine tossup states.
Three or four other states are clear-
ly leaning to Vice President Al Gore
or Gov. George W. Bush, but the deal
may not be sealed
yet. The three
largest states—California, New York
and Texas—aren't really in play.
The
12
states, with
132
electoral
votes, that most experts and nonpar-
tisan polls suggest could go either
way are: Arkansas (with 6 electoral
votes), Florida (25), Iowa (7), Michi-
gan (18), Minnesota (10), Missouri
(11), Nevada (4), New Mexico (5),
Oregon (7), Pennsylvania (23), West
Virginia (5) and Wisconsin (11).
Under this analysis, each candidate
is clearly leading in enough states to
have more that 200 electoral votes. It
takes 270 to win
If the above analysis remains accu-
rate, experts suggest that each can-
didate has approximately 200 elec-
toral votes they can expect to win
and the winner needs 70 additional
electoral votes.

Prior to the November 2000 presidential election, people were very fascinated
in using mathematics to predict the
results of the electoral vote. You may find this section quite interesting. Imagine yourself in the time during the
week and a half before the election of November, 2000. Read the above article very carefully. Then try to solve
these problems.

contain more fractions than their modern
counterparts. Further, many of them were designed

Using a Fraction to Represent Part of a Whole
In Chapter
1 we studied whole numbers. In this chapter we will study a frac-
tional part of a whole number. One way to represent parts of a whole is with
fractions. The word fraction (like the word fracture) suggests that something
is being broken. In mathematics, fractions represent the part that is "broken
off" from a whole. The whole can be a single object (like a whole pie) or a
group (the employees of a company). Here are some examples.
Single object
1
3
A group: ACE company employs 150
men, 200 women.
150
350
Recipe: Applesauce
4 apples
1/2 cup sugar
1 teaspoon cinnamon
The whole is the pie on the left. The
fraction \ represents the shaded part
of the pie, 1 of 3 pieces. \ is read "one-
third."
The whole is the company of 350 peo-
ple (150 men plus 200 women). The
fraction ^f§ represents that part of the
company consisting of men.
The whole
is
1 whole cup of sugar.
This recipe calls for \ cup of sugar.
Notice that in many real-life situa-
tions \ is written as 1/2.
When we say "| of a pizza has been
eaten," we mean 3 of 8 equal parts of
a pizza have been eaten. (See the fig-
ure.) When we write the fraction §,
the number on the top, 3, is the nu-
merator, and the number on the bot-
tom, 8, is the denominator.
The numerator specifies how many parts —> 3
The denominator specifies the total number of parts —> 8
When we say, "§ of the marbles are red," we mean 2 marbles out of a
total of 3 are red marbles.

The division way of looking at fractions asks the question:
What is the result of dividing one whole into three equal parts?
Thus we can say the fraction f means the same as a
-j-
b. However, special
care must be taken with the number 0.
Suppose that we had four equal parts and we wanted to take none of
them. We would want \ of the parts. Since 5 = 0-4 =
0. we see that
l

Any fraction with a
numerator equals zero.

What happens when zero is in the denominator?

Using Fractions to Represent Real-Life Situations
Several real-life situations can be described using fractions.
^ EXAMPLE 3
Use a fraction to describe each situation.
(a) A baseball player gets a hit 5 out of 12 times at bat.
(b) There are 156 men and 185 women taking psychology this semester. De-
scribe the part of the class that consists of women.
(c) Robert Tobey found in the Alaska moose count that five-eighths of the
moose observed were female.
(a) The baseball player got a hit ^ of his times at bat.
(b) The total class is 156 + 185 = 341. The fractional part that
is women
is
185 out of 341. Thus iff of the class is women.

Use a fraction to describe each situation.
(a) 9 out of the 17 players on the basketball team are on the dean's list.
(b) The senior class has 382 men and 351 women. Describe the part of the
class consisting of men.
(c) John needed seven-eighths of a yard of material.

^ EXAMPLE 4
Wanda made 13 calls, out of which she made five sales. Al-
bert made 17 calls, out of which he made six sales. Write a fraction that de-
scribes for both people together the number of calls in which a sale was made
compared with the total number of calls.
There are 5-6=11 calls in which a sale was made.
There were 13 + 17 = 30 total calls.
Thus — of the calls resulted in a sale.

Developing Your Study Skills
Previewing New Material
Part of your study time each day should consist of looking ahead to those sections
in your text that are to be covered the following day. You do not necessarily have
to study and learn the material on your own,
but
if you survey the concepts,
terminology, diagrams, and examples, the new ideas
will seem more familiar to
you when the
instructor presents them. You can take note of concepts that appear
confusing or difficult and be ready to
listen carefully for your instructor's
explanations. You can be prepared to ask the questions that will increase your
understanding. Previewing new material enables you to see what
is coming and
prepares you to be ready to absorb
it.

Writing a Number as a Product of Prime Factors
A prime number is a whole number greater than
1 that cannot be evenly di-
vided except by itself and
1. If you examine all the whole numbers from
1 to
50, you will find 15 prime numbers.
The First 15 Prime Numbers
2, 3, 5, 7,
1 1
, 13, 17,19, 23, 29, 31
, 37, 41
, 43, 47
A composite number is a whole number greater than
1 that can be di-
vided by whole numbers other than
1 and itself. The number 12 is a compos-
ite number.
12 = 2 X 6
and
12 = 3 X 4
The number 1
is neither a prime nor a composite number. The number
is neither a prime nor a composite number.
Recall that factors are numbers that are multiplied together. Prime fac-
tors are prime numbers. To check to see
if a number is prime or composite,
simply divide the smaller primes (such as 2, 3, 5, 7, 11,... ) into the given num-
ber. If the number can be divided exactly without a remainder by one of the
smaller primes, it is a composite and not a prime.
Some students find the following rules helpful when deciding if a num-
ber can be divided by 2, 3, or 5.
Divisibility Tests
1. A number is divisible by 2 if the last digit is 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8.
2. A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of the digits is divisible by 3.
3. A number is divisible by 5 if the last digit is
or 5.

wc always get exactly the same prime factors.

The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic
Every composite number can be written in exactly one way as a
product of prime numbers.
We have seen this in our Solution to Example 1(c).
You will be able to check this theorem again in Exercises 2.2. exercises
7-26. Writing a number as a product of prime factors
is also called prime
factorization.
Reducing a Fraction
You know that 5 + 2 and 3 + 4 are two ways to write the same number. We
say they are equivalent because they are equal to the same value. They are
both ways of writing the value 7.
Like whole numbers, fractions can be written in more than one way. For
example. 5 and \ are two ways to write the same number. The value of the
fractions is the same. When we use fractions, we often need to write them in
another form. If we make the numerator and denominator smaller, we sim-
plify the fractions.
Compare the two fractions in the drawings on the right. In each picture
the shaded part is the same size. The fractions \ and | are called equivalent frac-
tions. The fraction \ is in simplest form. To see how we can change f to 5
, we
look at a property of the number
1.
Any nonzero number divided by itself is
1.
5
17 _ c
5 ~ 17 ~ c "
"
Thus, if we multiply a fraction by ^ or {7 or ^ (remember, c cannot be zero), the
value of the fraction is unchanged because we are multiplying by a form of 1.
We can use this rule to show that \ and | are equivalent.

Determining Whether Two Fractions Are Equal
After we simplify, how can we check that a reduced fraction
is equivalent to
the original fraction? If two fractions are equal, their diagonal products or
cross products are equal. This is called the equality testforfractions.
If \ =
f
,
then
4 x 6 = 24^
3 X 8 = 24*-
Products
are equal.
If two fractions are unequal (we use the svmbol ^). their cross products are
5
6
unequal. If — ^ — , then
"
6 x 6 = 36^
5 x 7 = 35*-
Products
are not equal.
Since 36 ^ 35. we know that — ^ -.The test can be described in this way.

less than
1, we say the fraction is proper.

~ , ~ , ~
are called proper fractions.

8
Notice that the numerator is less than the denominator. If the numerator is
less than the denominator, the fraction is a proper fraction.
If the value of a fraction is greater than 1, the quantity can be written as
an improper fraction or as a mixed number.
Suppose that we have 1 whole pizza and \ of a pizza. We could write this
as 1 g .
1 1 is called a mixed number. A mixed number is the sum of a whole
number greater than zero and a proper fraction. The notation \\ actually
means 1 + § . The plus sign is not usually shown.
Another way of writing 1 \ pizza is to write \ pizza. \ is called an improper
fraction. Notice that the numerator is greater than the denominator. If the
numerator is greater than or equal to the denominator, the fraction is an im-
proper fraction.

Because improper fractions are easier to add, subtract, multiply, and
divide than mixed numbers, we often change mixed numbers to improper
fractions when we perform calculations with them.
Changing a Mixed Number to an Improper Fraction
1. Multiply the whole number by the denominator of the fraction.
2. Add the numerator of the fraction to the product found in step

Reducing a Mixed Number or an Improper Fraction
Mixed numbers and improper fractions may need to be reduced if they are
not in simplest form. Recall that we write the fraction in terms of prime fac-
tors. Then we look for common factors in the numerator and the denomina-
tor of the fraction. Then we divide the numerator and the denominator by
the common factor.

To Think About
A student concluded that just by looking at the denomi-
nator he could tell that the fraction ^ cannot be reduced unless 1655
-=- 97
is a whole number. How did he come to that conclusion?
Note that 97 is a prime number. The only factors of 97 are 97 and
1.
Therefore, any fraction with 97 in the denominator can be reduced only if 97
is a factor of the numerator. Since 1655
-s- 97 is not a whole number (see the
following division), it is therefore impossible to reduce -37-
.

By simplifying before multiplication, the reducing can be done more easily.
For a multiplication problem, a factor in the numerator can be paired with a
common factor in the denominator of the same or a different fraction. We
can begin by finding the prime factors in the numerators and denominators.
We then divide numerator and denominator by their common prime factors.

Developing Your Study Skills
Why
Is Review Necessary?
You master a course
in mathematics by learning the concepts one step at a time.
There are basic concepts
like addition, subtraction,
multiplication, and division of
whole numbers that are considered the foundation upon which
all of mathematics
is
built. These must be mastered
first. Then the study of mathematics
is
built step by
step upon
this foundation, each step supporting the next. The process
is a carefully
designed procedure, and so no steps can be skipped. A student of mathematics
needs to realize the importance of this building process to succeed.
Because learning new concepts depends on those previously learned, students
often need
to take time to review. The reviewing process
will strengthen the
understanding and application of concepts that are weak due to lack of mastery or
passage of time. Review at the right time on the right concepts can strengthen
previously learned
skills and make progress possible.
Timely, periodic review of previously learned mathematical concepts
is absolutely
necessary
in order to master new concepts. You may have forgotten a concept or
grown a
bit rusty
in applying
it. Reviewing
is the answer. Make use of any review
sections
in your textbook, whether they are assigned or not. Look back to previous
chapters whenever you have forgotten how to do something. Study the examples
and practice some exercises to refresh your understanding.
Be sure that you understand and can perform the computations of each new
concept. This will enable you to be able to move successfully on to the next ones.

Exercises
Make sure all fractious are simplified in the final answer.
Verbal and Writing Skills
1. In vour own words explain how to remember
2. Explain why 2
-j-
\
is a larger number than
I2-
that when you divide two fractions you invert
2
-r-
l
the second fraction and multiply by the
first.
How can you be sure that you don't invert the
first fraction by mistake?
Divide, ifpossible.

Finding the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of Two Numbers
The idea of a multiple of a number is fairly straightforward. The multiples of
a number are the products of that number and the numbers 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,...
For example, the multiples of 4 are
4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28,
.
.
.
The multiples of 5 are
5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35,
.
.
.
The least common multiple, or LCM, of two natural numbers is the smallest
number that is a multiple of both.
^* EXAMPLE
1
Find the least common multiple of 10 and 12.
The multiples of 10 are
10,
20,
30,
40,
50,
60,
70,...
The multiples of 12 are
12,
24,
36,
48,
60,
72,
84,...
The first multiple that appears on both lists is the least common multi-
ple. Thus the number 60 is the least common multiple of 10 and 12.
Practice Problem
1
Find the least common multiple of 14 and 21.
•
^* EXAMPLE 2
Find the least common multiple of 6 and 8.
The multiples of 6 are
6,
12,
18,
24,
30,
36,
42,...
The multiples of 8 are
8,
16,
24,
32,
40,
48,
56,...
The first multiple that appears on both lists is the least common multi-
ple. Thus the number 24 is the least common multiple of 6 and 8.
Practice Problem 2
Find the least common multiple of 15 and 25.
^
Now of course we can do the problem immediately if the larger number
is a multiple of the smaller number. In such cases the larger number is the
least common multiple.
^* EXAMPLE 3
Find the least common multiple of 7 and 35.
Because 7 X 5 = 35, therefore 35 is a multiple of 7.
So we can state immediately that the least common multiple of 7 and 35 is 35.
Practice Problem 3
Find the least common multiple of 6 and 54.

Finding the Least Common Denominator
Given Two or Three Fractions
We need some way to determine which of two fractions
is larger. Suppose
that Marcia and Melissa each have some left-over pizza.
Marcia's Pizza
— of a pizza left
Melissa's Pizza
— of a pizza left
150

Section 2.6 The Least Common Denominator and Building Up Fractions
151
Who has more pizza left? How much more? Comparing the amounts of pizza
left would be easy if each pizza had been cut into equal-sized pieces. If the orig-
inal pizzas had each been cut into 12 pieces, we would be able to see that Mar-
da had ^i °f a pizza more than Melissa had.

Marcia's Pizza
We know that

The denominator 12
is common to the fractions 73 and §. We call the small-
est denominator that allows us to compare fractions directly the least common
denominator, abbreviated LCD. The number 12 is the least common denom-
inator for the fractions t and i
.
Notice that 12 is the least common multiple of 3 and 4.
Definition
The least common denominator (LCD) of two or more fractions is the
smallest number that can be divided evenly by each of the fractions'
denominators.
How does this relate to least common multiples? The LCD of two frac-
tions is the least common multiple of the two denominators.
In some problems you may be able to guess the LCD quite quickly. With
practice, you can often find the LCD mentally. For example, you now know
that if the denominators of two fractions are 3 and 4. the LCD
is 12. For the
fractions \ and \
. the LCD is 4: for the fractions \ and \
. the LCD is 6. We can
see that
if the denominator of one fraction divides without remainder into
the denominator of another, the LCD of the two fractions is the larger of the
denominators,

In cases where the LCD is not obvious, the following procedure will help
us find the LCD.
Three-Step Procedure for Finding the Least Common Denominator
1. Write each denominator as the product of prime factors.
2. List all the prime factors that appear in either product.
3. Form a product of those prime factors, using each factor the greatest
number of times it appears in any one denominator.

(a) Step 1 Write each denominator as a product of prime factors.
6 = 2X3
15 = 5X3
Step 2 The LCD will contain the factors 2, 3, and 5.
6 = 2X3
15 = 5X3
Step 3 LCD =2X3X5
We form a product.
= 30
(b) Step 1 Write each denominator as a product of prime factors.
18 = 2X9 = 2X3X3
30 = 3X 10 = 2X3X5
Step 2 The LCD will be a product containing 2, 3, and 5.
Step 3 The LCD will contain the factor 3 twice since
it occurs twice in
the denominator 18.
Factor 3 occurs twice
in one denominator.
18 = 2 x 3 X 3
LCD = 2X3X3X5 = 90

Section 2.6 The Least Common Denominator and Building Up Fractions
153
(c) Write each denominator as a product of prime factors.
27 = 3 x 3 x 3
18 = 3 x 3 x 2
Factor 3 occurs three times.
The LCD will contain the factor 2 once but the factor 3 three times.
LCD = 2 x 3 x 3 X 3 = 54

Building Up Fractions with a Least Common Denominator
We cannot add fractions with unlike denominators. To change denominators,
we must (1) find the LCD and (2) build up the addends—the fractions being
added—into equivalent fractions that have the LCD as the denominator. We
know now how to find the LCD. Let's look at how we build up fractions. We
know, for example, that
50
100
25
100
and
75
100
In these cases, we have mentally multiplied the given fraction by
1
, in the form
of a certain number, c, in the numerator and that same number, c, in the
denominator.

Addition and Subtraction of Fractions
Adding and Subtracting Fractions
with a Common Denominator
You must have common denominators (denominators that are alike) to add
or subtract fractions.
If your problem has fractions without a common denominator or
if
it
has mixed numbers, you must use what you already know about changing the
form of each fraction (how the fraction looks). Only after all the fractions
have a common denominator can you add or subtract.
An important distinction: You must have common denominators to add
or subtract fractions, but you need not have common denominators to mul-
tiply or divide fractions.
To add two fractions that have the same denominator, add the numera-
tors and write the sum over the common denominator.

Alternate Method

'
In all the problems in this section so far, we have combined two fractions by
first finding the least common denominator. However, there is an alternate ap-
proach. You are only required to find a common denominator, not necessar-
ily the least common denominator. One way to quickly find a common
denominator of two fractions is to multiply the two denominators. However,
if you use this method, the numbers will usually be larger and you will usual-
ly need to simplify the fraction in your final answer.
^* EXAMPLE
1
Add n +
fe by using the product of the two denominators
as a common denominator.
Using this method we just multiply the numerator and denominator of
each fraction by the denominator of the other fraction. Thus no steps are
needed to determine what to multiply by.

Some students find this alternate method helpful because you do not
have to find the LCD or the number each fraction must be multiplied by.
Other students find this alternate method more difficult because of errors
encountered when working with large numbers in reducing the final answer.
You are encouraged to try a couple of the homework exercises by this method
and make up your own mind.

Developing Your Study Skills
Problems with Accuracy
Strive for accuracy. Mistakes are often made because of human error rather than
lack of understanding. Such mistakes are frustrating. A simple arithmetic or
copying error can lead
to an
incorrect answer.
These five steps
will help you cut down on errors.
1. Work carefully, and take your time. Do not rush through a problem
just to get
it done.
2.
Concentrate on the problem. Sometimes problems become mechanical, and
your mind begins to wander. You become careless and make a mistake.
3. Check your problem. Be sure that you copied
it correctly from the book.
4. Check your computations from step to step. Check the solution
to the problem.
Does
it work? Does
it make sense?
5. Keep practicing new
skills. Remember the old saying,
"Practice makes
perfect." An increase
in practice
results
in an increase
in accuracy. Many
errors are due simply to lack of practice.
There
is no magic formula for eliminating
all
errors,
but these
five steps
will be a
tremendous help
in reducing them.
Evaluating Expressions Using the Correct Order of Operations
Recall that in Section L.6we discussed the order of Operations when we were
combining whole numbers.We will now encounter some similar problems in-
volving fractions and mixed numbers.We will repeat here the four-Step order
of operations that we studied previously:

One of the most important uses of estimation in mathematics is in the
calculation of problems involving fractions. People find it easier to detect sig-
nificant errors when working with whole numbers. However, the extra steps
involved in the calculation with fractions and mixed numbers often distract
our attention from an error that we should have detected.
Thus it is particularly critical to take the time to check your answer by
estimating the results of the calculation with whole numbers. Be sure to ask
yourself, is this answer reasonable? Does this answer seem realistic? Only by
estimating our results with whole numbers will we be able to answer that
question. It is this estimating skill that you will find more useful in your own
life as a consumer and as a citizen.

Section 2.9 Applied Problems Involving Fractions
Another useful method for solving applied problems is called "Do a sim-
ilar, simpler problem." When a problem seems difficult to understand because
of the fractions, change the problem to an easier but similar problem. Then de-
cide how to solve the simpler problem and use the same steps to solve the
original problem. For example:
How many gallons oi water can a tank hold
if its volume
is 58 j cubic feet?
(
1 cubic foot holds about l\ gallons.)
A similar, easier problem would be: "If
1 cubic foot holds about 8
gallons and a tank holds 60 cubic feet, how many gallons of water does
the tank hold?"
The easier problem can be read more quickly and seems to make more
sense. Probably we will see how to solve the easier problem right away: "I
can find the number of gallons by multiplying 8 x 60." The re fore we can solve
the first problem by multiplying 7 \ X 58 \ to obtain the number of gallons of
water. See the next example.

Let us think of a simpler problem. If a boat traveled 70 nautical miles in
4 hours, how many knots did
it average? We would divide distance by
time.

Developing Your Study Skills
Why Study Mathematics?
Students often question the value of mathematics. They see
little real use for
it in
their everyday
lives. However, mathematics
is often the key that opens the door to
a better-paying
job.

In our present-day technological world, many people use mathematics daily. Many
vocational and professional areas— such as the fields of business,
statistics,
economics, psychology, finance, computer science, chemistry,
physics, engineering,
electronics, nuclear energy, banking, quality control, and teaching — require a
,
certain
level of expertise
in mathematics. Those who want to work
in these fields
must be able to function at a given mathematical
level. Those who cannot will not
be able to enter these job areas.

How will we find the number of pieces?
Now we will use a simpler problem to clarify the idea. A wire 100 feet long is cut up into smaller pieces each 4 feet
long. How many pieces will there be? We readily see that we would divide 100 by 4. Thus in our original problem we
should divide 95^ feet by 4 5 feet. This will
tell us the number of pieces. Now we
fill in the Mathematics Blueprint.

Writing a Word Name for a Decimal Fraction
In Chapter 2 we discussed fractions—the set of numbers such as|, §, jg, f , 355,
and so on. Now we will take a closer look at decimal fractions—that is. frac-
tions with 10. 100. 1000. and so on. in the denominator, such as jq
-
4?
1000
100' and
Why. of all fractions, do we take special notice of these? Our hands have
10 digits. Our U.S. money system is based on the dollar, which has 100 equal
parts, or cents. And the international system of measurement called the met-
ric system is based on 10 and powers of 10.
As with other numbers, these decimal fractions can be written in differ-
ent ways (forms). For example, the shaded part of the whole in the following
drawing can be written:
in words (one-tenth)
in fractional form (^)
in decimal form (0.1)
All mean the same quantity, namely 1 out of 10 equal parts of the whole. We'll
see that when we use decimal notation, computations can be easily done based
on the old rules for whole numbers and a few new rules about where to place
the decimal point. In a world where calculators and computers are common-
place, many of the fractions we encounter are decimal fractions. A decimal
fraction is a fraction whose denominator is a power of 10.

When a number is written in decimal form, the first digit to the right of the
decimal point represents tenths, the next digit hundredths, the next digit thou-
sandths, and so on. 0.9 means nine tenths and is equivalent to 55. 0.51 means
fifty-one hundredths and is equivalent to f^. Some decimals are larger than
1. For example, 1.683 means one and six hundred eighty-three thousandths.

So, we can write 156.2874 in words as one hundred fifty-six and two thousand
eight hundred seventy-four ten-thousandths. We say ten-thousandths because
it is the name of the last decimal place on the right.

Sometimes, decimals are used where we would not expect them. For ex-
ample, we commonly say that there are 365 days in a year, with 366 days in
every fourth year (or leap year). However, this is not quite correct. In fact,
from time to time further adjustments need to be made to the calendar to ad-
just for these inconsistencies. Astronomers know that a more accurate mea-
sure of a year
is called a tropical year (measured from one equinox to the
next). Rounded
to
the
nearest hundred-thousandth,
1
tropical year =
365.24122 days. This is read "three hundred sixty-five and twenty-four thou-
sand, one hundred twenty-two hundred-thousandths." This approximate value
is a more accurate measurement of the amount of time
it takes the earth to
complete one orbit around the sun.
Note the relationship between fractions and their equivalent numbers'
decimal forms.

Changing from Fractional Notation to Decimal Notation
It is helpful to be able to write decimals in both decimal notation and frac-
tional notation. First we illustrate changing a fraction with a denominator of
10, 100, or 1000 into decimal form.

61. American bald eagles have been fighting ex-
tinction due to environmental hazards such as
DDT. PCBs. and dioxin. The problem is with the
food chain. Fish or rodents consume contami-
nated food and/or water. Then the eagles ingest
the poison, which in turn affects the durability
of the eagles' eggs. It takes only 4 parts per mil-
lion of certain chemicals to ruin an eagle egg;
write this number as a fraction in lowest terms.
(In 1994 the bald eagle was removed from the
endangered species list.)
62. Every year turtles lay eggs on the islands of
South Carolina. Unfortunately, due to illegal
polluting, a lot of the eggs are contaminated. If
the turtle eggs contain more than 2 parts per

to head toward extinction. Write the preceding

Comparing Decimals
All of the numbers we have studied have a specific order. To illustrate this
order, we can place the numbers on a number line. Look at the number line
on the left. Each number has a specific place on it. The arrow points in the di-
rection of increasing value. Thus, if one number is to the right of a second
number, it is larger, or greater, than that number. Since 5 is to the right of 2
on the number line, we say that 5 is greater than 2. We write 5 >
2.
Since 4 is to the left of 6 on the number line, we say that 4 is less than 6.
We write 4 <
6.
The symbols " >
" and " <
" are called inequality symbols.
a < b is read "« is less than b."
a > b is read "# is greater than 6."
We can assign exactly one point on the number line to each decimal
number. When two decimal numbers are placed on a number line, the one
farther to the right is the larger. Thus we can say that 3.4 > 2.7 and 4.3 >
4.0.
We can also say that 0.5 <
1.0 and 1.8 <
2.2. Why?

To compare or order decimals without using a number line, we compare
each digit.
Comparing Two Numbers in Decimal Notation
1. Start at the left and compare corresponding digits. If the digits are the
same, move one place to the right.
2. When two digits are different, the larger number is the one with the
larger digit.

Section 3.2
Comparins, Orderins, and Rounding Decimals
209
Whenever necessary, extra zeros can be written to the right of the last
digit—that
is. to the right of the decimal point—without changing the value
of the decimal. Thus
0.56 = 0.56000
and
0.7768 = 0.77680.
The zero to the left of the decimal point is optional. Thus 0.56 =
.56. Both no-
tations are used. You are encouraged to place a zero to the left of the decimal
point so that you don't miss the decimal point when you work with decimals.
^ EXAMPLE 2
Fill in the blank with one of the symbols <, =, or >.
0.77

We begin by adding a zero to the first decimal.

digits differ. Since

Placing Decimals in Order from Smallest to Largest
Which is the heaviest—a puppy that weighs 6.2 ounces, a puppy that weighs
6.28 ounces, or a puppy that weighs 6.028 ounces? Did you choose the puppy
that weighs 6.28 ounces? You are correct.
You can place three or more decimals in order. If you are asked to order
the decimals from smallest to largest, look for the smallest decimal and place
it first.
• EXAMPLE 3
Place the following five decimal numbers in order from
smallest to largest.
1.834.
1.83,
1.381.
1.38,

Rounding Decimals to a Specified Decimal Place
Sometimes in calculations involving money, we see numbers like $386,432
and $29.5986. To make these useful, we usually round them to the nearest
cent. $386,432
is rounded to $386.43. $2 C).59S6 is rounded to $29.60. A gener-
al rule for rounding decimals follows.

210
Chapter 3
Decimals
Rounding Decimals
1. Find the decimal place (units, tenths, hundredths, and so on) for which
rounding off is required.
2. If the first digit to the right of the given place value is less than 5, drop
it and all digits to the right of it.
3. If the first digit to the right of the given place value is 5 or greater,
increase the number in the given place value by one. Drop all digits to
the right of this place.
• EXAMPLE 4
Round 156.37 to the nearest tenth.
156.3
7
We find the tenths place.
Note that 7, the next place to the right, is greater than 5. We round up to
156. 4 and drop the digits to the right. The answer is 156.4.
Practice Problem 4
Round 723.88 to the nearest tenth.

— We locate the thousandths place.
Note that the digit to the right of the thousandths place is 5. We round up
to 0.064 and drop all the digits to the right.
(b)
128.37 4 48
We locate the thousandths place.
Note that the digit to the right of the thousandths place is less than 5. We
round to 128.374 and drop all the digits to the right.
Practice Problem 5

•
Remember that rounding up to the next digit in a position may result in
several digits being changed.
^ EXAMPLE 6
Round to the nearest hundredth. Fred and Linda used
203.9964 kilowatt hours of electricity in their house in May.
203.9 9 64
We locate the hundredths place.
Since the digit to the right of hundredths is greater than 5, we round up. This
affects the next two positions. Do you see why? The result is 204.00 kilowatt
hours.
Practice Problem 6
Round to the nearest tenth. Last month the college gym-
nasium used 15,699.953 kilowatt hours of electricity.

ample, when writing figures on income tax forms, a taxpayer may round all fig-
ures to the nearest dollar.

WARNING Why is it so important to consider only one digit to the right
of the desired round-off position? What is wrong with rounding in steps? Sup-
pose that Mark rounds 1.349 to the nearest tenth in steps. First he rounds
1.349 to 1.35 (nearest hundredth). Then he rounds 1.35 to 1.4 (nearest tenth).
What is wrong with this reasoning?

To round 1.349 to the nearest tenth. We ask if 1.349 is closer to 1.3 or to 1.4.
It is closer to 1.3. Mark got 1.4. so he is not correct. He "rounded in steps" by
first moving to 1.35. thus increasing the error and moving in the wrong di-
rection. To control rounding errors, we consider only the first digit to the right
of the decimal place to which we are rounding.

Adding Decimals
1. Write the numbers to be added vertically and line up the decimal points.
Extra zeros may be placed to the right of the decimal points if needed.
2. Add all the digits with the same place value, starting with the right
column and moving to the left.
3. Place the decimal point of the sum in line with the decimal points of
the numbers added.

When we add decimals like 3.1 + 2.16 + 4.007, we may write in zeros, as shown:
3.100
2.160

9.267
What are we really doing here? What is the advantage of adding these extra
zeros?

"Decimals" means "decimal fractions." If we look at the number as trac-
tions, we see that we are actually using the property of multiplying a fraction
by
1 in order to obtain common denominators. Look at the problem this

The least common denominator is 1000.
To obtain the common denominator for
the first two fractions, we multiply.
Once we obtain a common denominator,
we can add the three fractions.
= 9.267
This is the answer we arrived at earlier using the decimal form for each
number. Thus writing in zeros in a decimal fraction
is really an easy way to
transform fractions to equivalent fractions with a common denominator.
Working with decimal fractions is easier than working with other fractions.

Chapter 3
Decimals
Subtracting Decimals
It is important to see the relationship between the decimal form of a mixed
number and the fractional form of a mixed number. This relationship helps us
understand why calculations with decimals are done the way they are. Recall
that when we subtract mixed numbers with common denominators, some-
times we must borrow from the whole number.
>i
-
.a
10
->i
-
-*i

We could write the same problem in decimal form:
4
14
- 2.7
2.7
Subtraction of decimals is thus similar to subtraction of fractions (we get the
same result), but it's usually easier to subtract with decimals than to subtract
with fractions.
Subtracting Decimals
1. Write the decimals to be subtracted vertically and line up the decimal
points. Additional zeros may be placed to the right of the decimal
point if not all numbers have the same number of decimal places.
2. Subtract all digits with the same place value, starting with the right
column and moving to the left. Borrow when necessary.
3. Place the decimal point of the difference in line with the decimal point
of the two numbers being subtracted.

Developing Your Study Skills
Making a Friend in the Class
Attempt to make a friend
in your class. You may find that you enjoy sitting
together and drawing support and encouragement from each other. Exchange
phone numbers so you can
call each other whenever you get stuck
in your study.
Set up convenient times to study together on a regular basis,
to do homework,
and to review for exams.
You must not depend on a friend or fellow student to tutor you, do your work for
you, or
in any way be responsible for your learning. However, you
will learn
from each other as you seek to master the course. Studying with a friend and
comparing notes, methods, and solutions can be very helpful. And
if can make
learning mathematics a
lot more fun!

1. Multiply the numbers just as you would multiply whole numbers.
2. Find the sum of the decimal places in the two factors.
3. Place the decimal point in the product so that the product has the
same number of decimal places as the sum in step 2. You may need to
write zeros to the left of the number found in step 1.
Now use these steps to do the preceding multiplication problem.

Can you think of a way to describe a rule that you could use in solving
this type of problem without going through all the foregoing steps?
You use multiplying by a power of 10 when you convert a larger unit of
measure to a smaller unit of measure in the metric system.
• EXAMPLE 8
Change 2.96 kilometers to meters.
Since we are going from a larger unit of measure to a smaller one, we
multiply. There are 1000 meters in 1 kilometer. Multiply 2.96 by 1000.
2.96 X 1000 = 2960
2.96 kilometers is equal to 2960 meters.
Practice Problem 8
Change 156.2 kilometers to meters.

Names Used to Describe Large Numbers
Often when reading the news-
paper or watching television news shows, we hear words like 3.46 trillion or
67.8 billion. These are abbreviated notations that are used to describe large
numbers. When you encounter these numbers, you can change them to stan-
dard notation by multiplication of the appropriate value.
For example, if someone says that the population of China is
1 .3 1 billion
people, we can write 1.31 billion =
1.31 x
1 billion =
1.31 x
1.000,000.000 =
1.310,000.000. If someone says the population of Chicago is 2.92 million peo-
ple, we can write
2.92 million - 2.92 X
1 million = 2.92 x
1.000.000 = 2,920.000.

Division of Decimals
Dividing a Decimal by a Whole Number
When you divide a decimal by a whole number, place the decimal point for
the quotient directly above the decimal point in the dividend. Then divide as
if the numbers were whole numbers.
To divide 26.8 by 4. we place the decimal point of our answer (the quo-
tient) directly above the decimal point in the dividend.

Chapter 3
Decimals
Some division problems do not yield a remainder of zero. In such cases.
we may be asked to round off the answer to a specified place. To round off.
we carry out the division until our answer contains a digit that is one place to
the right of that to which we intend to round. Then we round our answer to
the specified place. For example, to round to the nearest thousandth, we carry
out the division to the ten-thousandths place. In some division problems, you
will need to write in zeros at the end of the dividend so that this division can
be carried out.
• EXAMPLE 2
Divide and round the quotient to the nearest thousandth.
12.67 * 39
We will carry out our division to the ten-thousandths place. Then we will
round our answer to the nearest thousandth.

Dividing a Decimal by a Decimal
When the divisor is not a whole number, we can convert the division problem
to an equivalent problem that has a whole number as a divisor. Think about
tire reasons why this procedure will work. We will ask you about
it after you
study Examples 4 and 5.

Dividing by a Decimal
1. Make the divisor a whole number by moving the decimal point to the
right. Mark that position with a caret
( A ). Count the number of places
the decimal point moved.
2. Move the decimal point in the dividend to the right the same number
of places. Mark that position with a caret.
3. Place the decimal point of your answer directly above the caret
marking the decimal point of the dividend.
4. Divide as with whole numbers.

To Think About
Why do we move the decimal point to the right in the divisor
and the dividend? What rule allows us to do this? How do we know the answer
will be valid? We are actually using the property that multiplication of a fraction
by
1 leaves the fraction unchanged. This is called the multiplication identity. Let
us examine Example 4(b) again. We will write
1 .352 * 0.026 as a fraction.

The Thinning Ice Cap
According to top scientists, the great ice cap that
stretches across the top of the earth has become sig-
nificantly thinner than it was several decades ago.
From 1958 to 1976, the average thickness of the
Arctic Sea ice was approximately 10 feet. During
the period 1993 to 1997, it was about 6 feet. Scien-
tists estimate that since that time, the ice has been
thinning at the rate of about 4 inches a year.
This phenomenon is directly or indirectly related
to global warming. In 2000, it was estimated that the
temperature of the Earth had risen by 1.75 degrees
Fahrenheit over the previous century. Most scientists
(but not all) expect that the average temperature of
the Earth will rise by another 3.5 degrees Fahrenheit
by 2100 if emissions of heat-trapping gases such as
carbon dioxide continue at present rates.

Converting a Fraction to a Decimal
A number can be expressed in two equivalent forms: as a fraction and as
a decimal.
Fraction

2.5 = 2 — = 2 -

or

And every fraction can be expressed as an equivalent decimal, as we will
learn in this section. For example.
Fraction form => decimal form

n
(The "45" keeps repeating.)
Some of these decimal equivalents are so common that people find
it
helpful to memorize them. You would be wise to memorize the following
equivalents:
1 = 0.5
= 0.25 l-
10
0.1
We previously studied how to convert some fractions with a denomina-
tor of 10, 100. 1000. and so on to decimal form. For example, jg = 0.3 and
i5o - 0.07. We need to develop a procedure to write other fractions, such as §
and fg
, in decimal form.
238
Converting a Fraction to an Equivalent Decimal
Divide the denominator into the numerator until
(a) the remainder becomes zero, or
(b) the remainder repeats itself, or
(c) the desired number of decimal places is achieved.

Athletics' times in Olympic events, such as the 100-meter dash, are meas-
ured to the nearest hundredth of a second. Future Olympic athletics' times will
be measured to the nearest thousandth of a second.
Decimals such as 0.375 and 0.775 are called terminating decimals. When
converting § to 0.375 or ^ to 0.775, the division operation eventually yields a
remainder of zero. Other fractions yield a repeating pattern. For example.
5 = 0.3333
.
.
. and § = 0.6666
.
.
. have a pattern of repeating digits. Decimals
that have a digit or a group of digits that repeats are called repeating deci-
mals. We often indicate the repeating pattern with a bar over the repeating
group of digits:
0.3333 ...

.
= 0.74

218... = 0.218
0.8942 8942...
=0.8942
If when converting fractions to decimal form the remainder repeats itself, we
know that we have a repeating decimal.

Using the Correct Order of Operations with Decimals
The rules for order of operations that we discussed in Section
1.6 apply to
operations with decimals.
Order of Operations
Do first
1.
Perform operations inside parentheses.
2.
Simplify any expressions with exponents.
3.
Multiply or divide from left to right.
Do last
4.
Add or subtract from left to right.

242
Chapter 3
Decimals
Sometimes exponents are used with decimals. In such cases, we merely
evaluate using repeated multiplication.
(0.2)
2 = 0.2 X 0.2 = 0.04
(0.2)
3 = 0.2 X 0.2 x 0.2 = 0.008
(0.2)
4 = 0.2 x 0.2 X 0.2 x 0.2 = 0.0016
• EXAMPLE 6
Evaluate.
(0.3
)
3 + 0.6 X 0.2 + 0.013
First we need to evaluate (0.3)
3 = 0.3 X 0.3 X 0.3 = 0.027. Thus
(0.3)
3 + 0.6 x 0.2 + 0.013
= 0.027 + 0.6 X 0.2 + 0.013
= 0.027 + 0.12 + 0.013
<
When addends have a different
number of decimal places,
writing the problem in column
form makes adding easier.
= 0.16

In the next example
all four steps of the rules for order of operations
will be used.

(8 - 0.12) - 2
3 + 5.68 x
0.1
(8 - 0.12) + 2
3 + 5.68 x

First do subtraction inside the parentheses.
Simplify the expression with exponents.
From left to right do division and multiplication.
Add the final two numbers.
= 7.88 - 2
3 + 5.68 x 0.1
= 7.88 - 8 + 5.68 X 0.1

Estimating Sums, Differences, Products,
and Quotients of Decimals
When we encounter real-life applied problems, it is important to know if an
answer is reasonable. A car may get 21.8 miles per gallon. However, a car will
not get 218 miles per gallon. Neither will a car get 2.18 miles per gallon. To
avoid making an error in solving applied problems, it is wise to make an esti-
mate. The most useful time to make an estimate is at the end of solving the
problem, in order to see if the answer is reasonable.
There are several different rules for estimating. Not all mathematicians
agree what is the best method for estimating in each case. Most students find
that a very quick and simple method to estimate is to round each number so
that there is one nonzero digit. Then perform the calculation. We will use that
approach in this section of the book. However, you should be aware that
there are other valid approaches. Your instructor may wish you to use an-
other method.
• EXAMPLE

Estimate.
(a)

(c) 145.87 x 78.323
(b) 56.98876 - 48.87447
(d) 138.85 + 5.887
In each case we will round to one nonzero digit to estimate.
(a)
184,987.09 + 676,393.95 ~ 200,000 + 700.000 = 900,000
(b)
56.98876 - 48.87447 » 60 - 50 - 10
(c)
145.87 X 78.323 ~

Thus 145.87 X 78.323 ~ 8000

Thus 138.85 - 5.887 ~ 17
Here we round the answer to the nearest whole number.

In the United States for almost all jobs where you are paid an hourly
wage, if you work more than 40 hours in one week, you should be paid over-
time, at a rate of 1.5 times the normal hourly rate, for the extra hours worked
in that week. The next problem deals with overtime wages.

(a) How many containers will the chemist need?
She has 36.85 liters of cleaning fluid and she
\\ ants to put
it into se\ -
eral equal-sized containers each holding 0.67 liter. Suppose we are not sure
what to do. Let's do a similar, simpler problem. If we had 40 liters of clean-
ing fluid and we wanted to put it into little containers each holding 2 liters,
what would we do? Since the little containers would only hold 2 liters, w e
would need 20 containers. We know that 40 -
2 =
20. So we see that, in
general, we divide the total number of liters by the amount in the small con-
tainer. Thus 36.85
-5- 0.67 will give us the number of containers in this case.

Developing Your Study Skills
Applications or Word Problems

Applications or word problems are the very
life of mathematics! They are the
reason
for doing mathematics, because they teach you how to put into use the
mathematical
skills you have developed. Learning mathematics without ever doing
word problems
is similar to learning
all the
skills of a sport without ever playing a
game or learning
all the notes on an instrument without ever playing a song.
The key to success
is practice. Make yourself do as many problems as you can.
You may not be able to do them
all correctly at
first, but keep trying. Do not give
up whenever you reach a
difficult one.
If you cannot solve
it,
just try another one.
Then come back and
try
it again
later. Ask for help from your teacher or the
tutoring
lab. Ask other classmates how they solved the problem.
A misconception among students when they begin studying word problems
is that
each problem
is different. At
first the problems may seem
this way,
but as you
practice more and more, you will begin
to see the
similarities, the different
"types." You
will see patterns
in solving problems, which will enable you
to solve
problems of a given type more easily.

Rise
in Health Care Costs Rests Largely on Drug Prices
By Robert Pear
THE NEW YORK TIMES ON THE
WEB, November 14, 2000
Copyright 2000. The New York Times.
Reprinted with Permission.
"Washington. Nov. 13—Prescription
drugs accounted for 44 percent of the
increase in health costs last year, re-
searchers said today.
In a report published in the journal
Health Affairs, the researcher said
overall health costs for services cov-
ered by private insurance rose by 6.6
percent last year, while drug spend-
ing increased by 18.4 percent. The
study did not separately examine
costs for people without insurance."
"The report in Health Affairs said
that about one-third of the increase
in drug spending last year was at-
tributable to higher prices. The re-
mainder, it said, was attributable to a
higher volume of sales, reflecting the
advent of new medicines and the in-
creased use of existing drugs.
While prescription drugs accounted
for 44 percent of the
increase
in
health costs last year, the report said,
doctors* services accounted for 32
percent, and outpatient hospital care
accounted for 21 percent, while in-
patient hospital care was responsible
for only 3 percent."
Read over the article very carefully. Assume that overall health costs for services covered by private insurance
includes
all doctor services. Also assume that the costs are increased at the same rate for people who had
insurance and for people who did not have insurance.
EXERCISES
Using the information quoted answer questions 1-4. Round your expense values to the nearest
cent. Round all percents to the nearest tenth.
1. Suppose that your prescription
drugs last year cost $200. that you
spent $300 for doctor services and
were fortunate to have no hospital
expenses. That
is, your total
medical expenses last year were
$500. Based on the excerpts
quoted above, what should you
expect next year's expenses to be
when figuring your budget?
2. What is your anticipated percent
increase in medical costs?
Suppose an opportunity exists to
buy health insurance at $50 per
month. The insurance policy does
not cover prescription drugs, but
covers 80 percent of all other
medical expenses. What should be
the estimate for next year's
medical expenses?
Why might spending more money
to have insurance be a good idea?

61. Marcia and Greg purchased a new car. For the next five years they will be making monthly payments of
$212.50. Their bank has offered to give them a loan at a smaller interest rate so that they would make
monthly payments of only $199.50. The bank would charge them $285.00 to reissue their car loan. How
much would it cost them to keep their original loan? How much would
it cost them if they took the new
loan from the bank? Should they make the change or keep the original
loan'.'

Developing Your Study Skills
Exam Time: How To Review
i
Reviewing adequately for an exam enables you
to bring together the concepts you
%
have learned over several sections. For your review, you
will need
to do the
following:
1.
Reread your textbook. Make a
list of any terms,
rules, or formulas you need
to know
for the exam. Be sure you understand them
all.
2.
Reread your notes. Go over returned homework and quizzes. Redo the
problems you missed.
3.
Practice some of each type of problem covered
in the chapter(s) you are to
be tested on.
In
fact,
it
is a good idea to construct a practice
test of your own
and then discuss
it with a friend from class.

wildlife in the state. This close tracking of animals in the wild has been
valuable in preserving a proper balance of animal species in the
environment and in keeping a variety of animals from becoming endangered
species. The scientists and biologists responsible for maintaining these records
use proportions to determine future populations. Do you think you could

Using a Ratio to Compare Two Quantities
with the Same Units
Assume that you earn 13 dollars an hour and your friend earns 10 dollars per
hour. The ratio 13: 10 compares what you and your friend make. This ratio
means that for every 13 dollars you earn, your friend earns 10. The rate you
are paid is 13 dollars per hour, which compares 13 dollars to 1 hour. In this sec-
tion we see how to use both rates and ratios to solve many everyday problems.
Suppose that we want to compare an object weighing 20 pounds to an
object weighing 23 pounds. The ratio of their weights would be 20 to 23. We
may also write this as |§
. A ratio is the comparison of two quantities that have
the same units.
A commonly used video display for a computer has a horizontal di-
mension of 14 inches and a vertical dimension of 10 inches. The ratio of the
horizontal dimension to the vertical dimension is 14 to 10. In reduced form we
would write that as 7 to 5. We can express the ratio three ways.
We can write "the ratio of 7 to 5."
We can write 7
: 5 using a colon.
We can write I using a fraction.
All three notations are valid ways to compare 7 to 5. Each is read as "7 to 5."
We always want to write a ratio in simplest form. A ratio is in simplest
form when the two numbers do not have a common factor and both
numbers are whole numbers.
^* EXAMPLE

Write in simplest form. Express your answer as a fraction.

fraction.

To Think About
Perhaps you have heard statements like "a certain jet
plane travels at Mach 2.2." What does that mean? A Mach number is a ratio
that compares the velocity (speed) of an object to the velocity of sound. Sound
travels at about 330 meters per second. The Mach number
is written in deci-
mal form.
What is the Mach number of a jet traveling at 690 meters per second?
690 meters per second
Mach number o\' jet =
—
330 meters per second
- 2.09090909... or 2.09
Rounded to the nearest tenth, the Mach number of the jet
is 2.1.
Exercises 69 and 70 in Exercises 4.1 deal with Mach numbers

Using a Rate to Compare Two Quantities with Different Units
A rate is a comparison of two quantities with different units. Usually, to avoid
misunderstanding, we express a rate as a fraction with the units included.
^* EXAMPLE 3
Recently an automobile manufacturer spent $946,000 for a
48-second television commercial shown on a national network. What
is the
rate of dollars spent to seconds of commercial time?
The rate is
946.000 dollars _ 59.125 dollars
48 seconds
3 seconds
Practice Problem 3
A farmer is charged a $44 storage fee for every 900 tons
of grain he stores. What
is the rate of the storage fee in dollars to tons of
grain?
^*
Often we want to know the rate for a single unit, which is the unit rate.
A unit rate is a rate in which the denominator is the number 1.
^* EXAMPLE 4
A car traveled 301 miles in seven hours. Find the unit rate.
^ can be simplified. We find 301
-s- 7 = 43.
Thus
301 miles
43 miles
7 hours
1 hour
The denominator is 1. We write our answer as 43 miles/hour. The fraction line
is read as the word "per," so our answer here is read "43 miles per hour." Per
means "for every," so a rate of 43 miles per hour means 43 miles traveled for
every hour traveled.
Practice Problem 4
A car traveled 212 miles in four hours. Find the unit rate.

Solving for the variable n in an Equation
of the Form a x n = b
Consider this expression: "3 times a number yields 15. What is the number?"
We could write this as
3 x
|T~1 =
15
and guess that the number [T] =
5. There is a better way of solving this prob-
lem, a way that eliminates the guesswork. We will begin by using a variable.
That
is. we will use a letter to represent a number we do not yet know. We
briefly used variables in Chapters 1-3. Now we use them more extensively.
Let the letter n represent the unknown number. We write
3x/i =
15.
This is called an equation. An equation has an equal sign. This indicates that
the values on each side of it are equivalent. We want to find the number n in
this equation without guessing. We will not change the value of n in the equa-
tion if we divide both sides of the equation by 3. Thus if
3x/! =
15.
3x«
15
we can sav
which is
X n = 5
or
1 x n = 5
Since
1 x any number is the same number, we know that n = 5. Any equa-
tion of the form a X n = b can be solved in this way. We divide both sides of

Solving Applied Problems Using Proportions
Let us examine a variety of applied problems that can be solved by proportions.
^^ EXAMPLE
1
A company that makes eyeglasses conducted a recent sur-
vey using a quality control test. It was discovered that 37 pairs of eyeglasses
in a sample of 120 pairs of eyeglasses were defective. If this rate remains the
same each year, how many of the 36,000 pairs of eyeglasses made by this com-
pany each year are defective?

to
the total number
n defective pairs
120 total pairs of eyeglasses
36,000 total pairs of eyeglasses
37 X 36,000 = 120 x n

1,332,000 _ 120 X n
120

11,100 = n
Form the cross products.
Simplify.
Divide each side by 120.
Thus, if the rate of defective eyeglasses holds steady, there are about 11.100
defective pairs of eyeglasses made by the company each year.
Practice Problem

Yesterday an automobile assembly line produced 243
engines, of which 27 were defective. If the same rate
is true each day. how
many of the 4131 engines produced this month are defective?
^*
Looking back at Example
1, perhaps
it occurred to you that the frac-
tions in the proportion could be set up in an alternative way. You can set up
this problem in several different ways as long as the units are in correctly cor-
responding positions. It would be correct to set up the problem in the form
defective pairs in sample
total glasses in sample
total defective pairs
total glasses made by company

or
total glasses in sample
total glasses made by company
defective pairs in sample
total defective pairs
But we cannot set up the problem this way.
defective pairs in sample
total defective pairs
total glasses made by company
total glasses in sample
This is not correct. Do you see why?

Chapter 4
Ratio and Proportion
• EXAMPLE 4
Tim operates a bicycle rental center during the summer
months on the island of Martha's Vineyard. He discovered that when the fer-
ryboats brought 8500 passengers a day to the island, his center rented 340 bi-
cycles a day. Next summer the ferryboats plan to bring 10,300 passengers a day
to the island. How many bicycles a day should Tim plan to rent?
Two important cautions are necessary before we solve the proportion.
We need to be sure that the bicycle rentals are directly related to the number
of people on the ferryboat. (Presumably, people who fly to the island or who
take small pleasure boats to the island also rent bicycles.)
Next we need to be sure that the people who represent the increase in
passengers per day would be as likely to rent bicycles as the present num-
ber of passengers do. For example, if the new visitors to the island are all sen-
ior citizens, they are not as likely to rent bicycles as younger people. If we
assume those two conditions are satisfied, then we can solve the problem as
follows.
8500 passengers per day now
10,300 passengers per day later
340 bike rentals per day now
n bike rentals per day later
8500 X n = 340 X 10,300
8500 X n = 3,502,000
8500 X n _ 3,502,000
8500
~
8500
n = 412
If the two conditions are satisfied, we would predict 412 bicycle rentals.
Practice Problem 4
For every 4050 people who walk into Tom's Souvenir
Shop, 729 make a purchase. Assuming the same conditions, if 5500 people
walk into Tom's Souvenir Shop, how many people may be expected to make

*•
Biologists and others who observe or protect wildlife sometimes use the
capture-mark-recapture method to determine how many animals are in a cer-
tain region. In this approach some animals are caught and tagged in a way
that does not harm them. They are then released into the wild, where they
mix with their kind.
It is assumed (usually correctly) that the tagged animals will mix through-
out the entire population in that region, so that when they are recaptured in
a future sample, the biologists can use them to make reasonable estimates
about the total population. We will employ the capture-mark-recapture
method in the next example.

Section 4.4 Applied Problems Involving Proportions
^ EXAMPLE 5
A biologist catches 42 fish in a lake and tags them. She then
quickly returns them to the lake. In a few days she catches a new sample of
50 fish. Of those 50 fish, 7 have her tag. Approximately how many fish are in
the lake?
42 fish tagged in 1st sample
7 fish tagged in 2nd sample
n fish in lake
50 fish caught in 2nd sample
42 x 50 = 7 x n
2100 = 7 X n
2100 _ 7 X n
1
~
1
300 = n
293
Assuming that no tagged fish died and that the tagged fish mixed through-
out the population of fish in the lake, we estimate that there are 300 fish in
the lake.
Practice Problem 5
A park ranger in Alaska captures and tags 50 bears. He
then releases them to range through the forest. Sometime later he captures
50 bears. Of the 50, 4 have tags from the previous capture. Estimate the num-

Getting Help
Getting the right kind of help at the right time can be a key ingredient
in being
successful
in mathematics. When you have gone to class on a regular basis, taken
careful notes, methodically read your textbook, and diligently done your
homework — in other words, when you have made every effort possible to learn the
mathematics— you may
still
find that you are having
difficulty.
If this
is the case,
then you need
to seek help. Make an appointment with your
instructor to find out
what help
is available to you. The
instructor,
tutoring
services, a mathematics
lab,
videotapes, and computer software may be among the resources you can draw on

Putting Your Skills to Work
Studying the Moose Population
In November 2000, it was estimated that Alaska had
a population of 163,400 moose. Each year hunters
usually kill between 6000 and 8000 moose. Since 1990,
the moose population has grown by 25,000. (Source:
Alaska Department of Wildlife Management)
Problems for Individual Investigation
1. The ratio of females to males in the moose popula-
tion is usually 23 to 27. What was the estimated num-
ber
of
males
in
the
moose
population
as
of
November 2000?
2. Assume that the next year 20,000 females gave birth
to twin calves, and 15,000 females had only one calf.
Also assume that the next year hunters killed 6000
moose while 19,000 died from natural causes or nat-
ural predators. What was the moose population in
2001?
Problems for Group Investigation
and Cooperative Study
3. Assume that over the ten years from 2000 to 2010,
the total moose population grows by 3000 per year.
How many females will be in the moose population
in November 2010?
4.
If the total moose population grows by 3500 per year
for the five years from 2000 to 2005 and then, due to
a very severe winter and lack of natural food, the
moose population declines by 5000 per year for two
years, how many males will be in the moose popula-
tion in November 2007?

"An increasing number of consumers
—eager to see their photographs in-
stantly—are buying digital cameras."
From the table above
it
is easy to
compute the amount of change in
sales
(in millions) from year
to
year. Thus
from
1996
to
1997
the amount of change would be
$518 - $386 = $132
(in millions).
This
is also known as the average
(yearly) rate of change from 1996 to
1997 and
it's represented as $132/1
which represents the rate as $132 (in
millions) per year.
EXERCISES
The average rate of change of sales over other periods of time = change in sales/change in time.
For example: ($573 - $386)/2 = $187/2 = $93.5 (in millions) per year from 1996 to 1998. Refer
to the table for questions 1 and 2.
1.
Find the yearly rate of change
from 1997 to 1998 and 1998 to
1999.
2. Find the average rates of change
from 1997 to 1999 and 1996 to
1999.
3. What is the relationship between
the rates of change computed in
exercise
1 and the average rate of
change for two years (from 1997
to 1999) computed in exercise 2?

Experts in the area of nutrition carefully measure
the contents of the foods we eat to determine how
many calories and grams of fat each item contains.
A summary of these nutrition facts is contained on the
label that appears on most foods sold in the United
States. However, sometimes we need information that
is not provided on the label. Could you use your
knowledge of percents to find this kind of
information? Turn to the Putting Your Skills to Work

Expressing a Fraction Whose Denominator

"My raise came through. I got a 6% increase!"
"The leading economic indicators show inflation rising at a rate of 1.3%."
"Mark McGwire and Babe Ruth each hit quite a few home runs. But
I
wonder who has the higher percentage of home runs per at-bat?"
We use percents often in our everyday lives. In business, in sports, in
shopping, and in many areas of life, percentages play an important role. In
this section we introduce the idea of percent, which means "per centum" or
"per hundred." We then show how to use percentages.
In previous chapters, when we described parts of a whole, we used frac-
tions or decimals. Using a percent is another way to describe a part of a whole.
Percents can be described as ratios whose denominators are 100. The word
percent means per 100. This sketch has 100 rectangles.
Of 100 rectangles, 11 are shaded. We can say that 11 percent of the whole
is shaded. We use the symbol % for percent. It means "parts per 100." When
we write 11 percent as 11%, we understand that
it means 11 parts per one
hundred, or, as a fraction,^
.

Percent
Writing a Percent as a Decimal
Suppose we have a percent such as 59%. What would be the equivalent in
decimal form? Using our definition of percent, 59% = $$
. This fraction could
be written in decimal form as 0.59. In a similar way, we could write 21% as
f^ = 0.21. This pattern allows us to quickly change the form of a number
from a percent to a fraction whose denominator is 100 to a decimal.
^ EXAMPLE 4
Write as a decimal.
(a) 38%
(b) 6%
(a) 38% = ^ = 0.38
(b) 6% = ^ = 0.06
Practice Problem 4
Write as a decimal.
(a) 47%
(b) 2%
•
The results of Example 4 suggest that when you remove a percent sign
(%) you are dividing by 100. When we divide by 100 this moves the decimal
point of a number two places to the left. Now that you understand this process
we can abbreviate it with the following rule.
Changing a Percent to a Decimal
1. Drop the % symbol.
2. Move the decimal point two places to the left.
• EXAMPLE 5
Write as a decimal.
(a) 26.9%
(b) 7.2%
(c) 0.13%
(d) 158%
In each case, we drop the percent symbol and move the decimal point
two places to the left.
(a) 26.9% = 0.269 = 0.269
(b) 7.2% = 0.072 = 0.072
Note that we need to add an extra zero

Writing a Decimal as a Percent
In Example 4(a) we changed 38
(
/c to m to 0.38. We can start with 0.38 and re-
verse the process. We obtain 0.38 = ^ = 38
(X. Study all the parts of Exam-
ples 4 and 5. You will see that the steps are reversible. Thus 0.38 = 38
0.06 = 67c, 0.70 = 707,0.269 = 26.97,0.072 = 7.27,0.0013 = 0.137. and
1.58 = 1587.
In each part we are multiplying by 100. So to change a decimal number
to a percent we are multiplying the number by 100. In each part the decimal
point
is moved two places to the right. Then the percent symbol
is written
after the number.
Changing a Decimal to a Percent
1. Move the decimal point two places to the right.
2. Then write the 7 symbol at the end of the number.

Changing Between Percents, Decimals, and Fractions
Changing a Percent to a Fraction
By using the definition of percent, we can write any percent as a fraction
whose denominator is 100. Thus when we change a percent to a fraction, we
remove the percent symbol and write the number over 100. To write a num-
ber over 100 means that we are dividing by 100. If possible, we then simplify
the fraction.

Developing Your Study Skills
Reading the Textbook
Homework time each day should begin with the careful reading of the section(s)
assigned
in your textbook. Much time and effort have gone
into the selection of a
particular text, and your instructor has chosen a book that will help you become
successful
in
this mathematics class. Expensive textbooks can be a wise investment
if you take advantage of them by reading them.
Reading a mathematics textbook
is unlike reading many other types of books that
you may use
in your
literature,
history, psychology, or sociology courses.
Mathematics texts are technical books that provide you with exercises to practice
on. Reading a mathematics text requires slow and careful reading of each word,
which takes time and
effort.
Begin reading your textbook with a paper and pencil
in hand. As you come
across a new definition, or concept, underline
it
in the text and/or write
it down
in your notebook. Whenever you encounter an unfamiliar term, look
it up and
make a note of
it. When you come to an example, work through
it step by step.
Be sure to read each word and to follow directions carefully.
Notice the helpful
hints the author provides to guide you to correct solutions and
prevent you from making errors. Take advantage of these pieces of expert advice.
Be sure that you understand what you are reading. Make a note of any of those
things that you do not understand and ask your instructor about them. Do not
hurry through the material. Learning mathematics takes time.

Translating a Percent Problem into an Equation
In word problems like the ones in this section, we can translate from words to
mathematical symbols and back again. After we have the mathematical symbols
arranged in an equation, we solve the equation. When we find the values that
make the equation true, we have also found the answer to our word problem.
To solve a percent problem, we express it as an equation with an unknown
quantity. We use the letter n to represent the number we do not know. The fol-
lowing table is helpful when translating from a percent problem to an equation.

Solving a Percent Problem by Solving an Equation
The percent problems we have translated are of three types. Consider the
equation 60 = 209c X 300. This problem has the form
amount = percent x base.
Any one of these quantities—amount, percent, or base—may be unknown.
1. When we do not know the amount, we have an equation like
n =
20'
; x 300
2. When we do not know the base, we have an equation like
60 =
20'
; x n
3. When we do not know the percent, we have an equation like
60 = n X 300
We will studv each type separately.
It
is not necessar)
to memorize the
three types, but
it is helpful to look carefully at the examples we give of each.
In each example, do the computation in a wa> that is easiest for you. This may
be using a pencil and paper, using a calculator, or. in some cases, doing the
problem mentally.

Solving Percent Problems When We Do Not Know the Base
If a number is multiplied by the letter n, this can be indicated by a multipli-
cation sign, parentheses, a dot, or placing the number in front of the letter. Thus
3 X n = 3(n) = 3
• n = 3n. In this section we use equations like 3n = 9 and
0.5/? = 20. To solve these equations we use the procedures developed in Chap-
ter 4. We divide each side by the number multiplied by n.

Identifying the Parts of the Percent Proportion
In Section 5.3A we showed you how to use an equation to solve a per-
cent problem. Some students find it easier to use proportions to solve per-
cent problems. We will show you how to use proportions in this section.
The two methods work equally well. Using percent proportions allows
you to see another of the many uses of the proportions that we studied in
Chapter 4.
Suppose your math class of 25 students has 19 right-handed students
and 6 left-handed students. You could say that ^ of the class or 76% is right-
handed. Consider the following relationship.
This can be written as
19
25
19
25
= 76%
76
100
As a rule, we can write this relationship using the percent proport
amount
percent number
ion
base

To use this equation effectively, we need to find the amount, base, and per-
cent number in a word problem. The easiest of these three parts to find is
the percent number. We use the letter p (a variable) to represent the percent
number.
^* EXAMPLE

Identify the percent number p.

(b) 18% of what number is 90?
(c) What percent of 64 is 8?

We use the letter b to represent the base number. The base is the entire
quantity or the total involved. The number that
is the base usually appears
after the word of. The amount, which we represent by the letter a, is the part
being compared to the whole.

Using the Percent Proportion
to Solve Percent Problems
When we solve the percent proportion, we will have enough information to
state the numerical value for two of the three variables a, b, p in the equation
a =

We first identify those two values, and then substitute those values into the
equation. Then we will use the skills that we acquired for solving proportions
in Chapter 4 to find the value we do not know.
• EXAMPLE 4
Find 260% of 40.
The percent p = 260. The number that is the base usually appears after

^ EXAMPLE 6
George and Barbara purchased some no-load mutual funds.
The account manager charged a service fee of 0.29c of the value of the mu-
tual funds. George and Barbara paid this fee, which amounted to $53. What
was the value of the mutual funds that they purchased?
The basic situation here is that 0.27c of some number is $53. This is equiv-
alent to saying $53 is 0.29c of what? If we want to answer the question "53 is
0.29c of what?", we need to identify a. b. and p.
The percent p =

To Think About
Recently a review was made of the expenditures
in Texas during 1999 for the following five categories:
corrections, government and administration,
interest on general debt, natural resources, and parks and
recreation. The amount of money (in millions of dollars) expended in each of these five categories
is listed
in the following pie chart.
Round all answers to the nearest tenth.
Use the chart to answer questions 45-48.

30% larger, and the other three categories re-
mained at the same dollar figure. What percent
of the total expenditures in 2004 in these five
categories would be used for natural resources?
48. Suppose that compared to 1999, expenditures
in 2007 for corrections were 409c larger, ex-

Solving Applied Percent Problems
Solving General Applied Percent Problems
In Sections 5.3A and 5.3B. we learned the three types of applied percent prob-
lems. Some problems ask you to find a percent of a number. Some problems
give you an amount and a percent and ask you to find the base (or whole).
Other problems give an amount and a base and ask you to find the percent.
We will now see how the three types of percent problems occur in real life.

MethodA
Translate to an equation.
What is 57c of $299?
n = 57 x 299

The tax is $14.95.

a = 14.95
The tax is $14.95.
Thus, by either method, the amount of the sales tax is $14.95.
Let's see if our answer is reasonable. Is 57 of $299 really $14.95? If we
round $299 to one nonzero digit, we have $300. Thus we have 57 of 300 =
15.
Since 15 is quite close to our value of $14.95. our answer seems reasonable.

^^
Now you have some experience solving the three types of percent prob-
lems in real-life applications. You can use either Method A or Method B to
solve applied percent problems. In the following pages we will present more
percent applications. We will not list all the steps of Method A or Method B.
Most students will find after a careful study of Examples 1-3 that they do not
need to write out all the steps of Method A or Method B when solving applied
percent problems.
Solving Problems When Percents Are Added
Percents can be added if the base (whole) is the same. For example. 509c of
your salary added to 209c of your salary = 709c of your salary. 100
of
your cost added to 159c of your cost =
1 159c of your cost. Problems like this
are often called markup problems. If we add 159c of the cost of an item to
the original cost, the markup is 15%.We will add percents in some applied
situations.
The following example
is interesting, but
it
is a
little challenging. So
please read
it very carefully. A lot of students find
it difficult at first.
^ EXAMPLE 4

Solving Discount Problems
Frequently, we see signs urging us to buy during a sale when the list price is
discounted by a certain percent.
The amount of a discount is the product of the discount rate and the list price.
Discount = discount rate X
list price
^* EXAMPLE 5
Jeff purchased a compact disc player on sale at a 35% dis-
count. The list price was $430.00.
(a) What was the amount of the discount?
(b) How much did Jeff pay for the CD player?
(a) Discount = discount rate

Solving Commission Problems
If you work as a salesperson, your earnings may be in part or in total a cer-
tain percentage of the sales you make. The amount of money you get that is
a percentage of the value of your sales is called your commission. It is calcu-
lated by multiplying the percentage (called the commission rate) by the value
of the sales.
Commission = commission rate X value of sales
• EXAMPLE
1
A salesperson has a commission rate of 17%. She sells
$32,500 worth of goods in a department store in two months. What is her
commission?
Commission = commission rate X value of sales
Commission = 17% X $32,500
= 0.17 X 32,500
= 5525
Her commission is $5525.00.
Does this answer seem reasonable? Check by estimating.
Practice Problem
1
A real estate salesperson earns a commission rate of 6%
when he sells a $156,000 home. What is his commission?
^^
In some problems, the unknown quantity will be the commission rate or
the value of sales. However, the same equation is used:
Commission = commission rate X value of sales
Solving Percent-of-lncrease or Percent-of-Decrease Problems
We sometimes need to find the percent by which a number increases or de-
creases. If a car costs $7000 and the price decreases $1750, we say that the
percent of decrease is ^§| = 0.25 = 25%.
Percent of decrease
amount of decrease

original amount
Similarly, if a population of 12,000 people increases by 1920 people, we say that
the percent of increase is y^^ = 0.16 = 16%.

Percent of increase =

original amount
Note that for these types of problems the base is always the original amount.
• EXAMPLE 2

59,500. What was the percent of increase?

Solving Simple Interest Problems
Interest
is money paid for the use of money If you deposit money in a bank.
the bank uses that money and pays you interest. If you borrow money, sou pay
the bank interest for the use of that money. The principal
is the amount de-
posited or borrowed. Interest
is usually expressed as a percent rate of the
principal. The interest rau
.ed to be per year, unless otherwise stated.
The formula used in business to compute simple intere-
-
Interest = principal x rate x time
I = PxRxT
If the interest rate is per) ear, the time T must be in years.

Putting Your Skills to Work
Nutrition Facts and Percents
Almost
all packaged foods in the United States are required to have posted a
Nutrition Facts label, such as the one shown from a box of raisin bran. The informa-
tion on the label is helpful, but sometimes people desire additional information and
the use of percents is required. Study the label and answer the following questions.
Problems for Individual Investigation
1. Melinda discovered that when she pours a bowl of raisin bran for breakfast, she uses
only 4 of a cup of cereal with her \ cup of milk. What percent of the daily recommended
values of potassium and total carbohydrates will she obtain from her breakfast if she
is on a 2000-calorie diet?
2. Doug discovered that when he pours a bowl of raisin bran for breakfast, he uses 1 ^ cups
of cereal with the k cup of milk. What percent of the daily recommended values of
potassium and total carbohydrates will he obtain from his breakfast
if he is on a
2500-calorie diet?

1800 calories each day. What percent of her suggested daily amount of calories and total
fat is provided by 1 cup of raisin bran and \ cup of fat-free milk? (Assume that the daily
recommended amount of fat in an 1800-calorie diet
is proportional to the daily
recommended amount of fat in a 2000-calorie diet.)

The Law of Zero Return
Paul Cox, THE GLOSSARY
OF MATHEMATICAL MISTAKES,
April, 2000,
www.mathmistakes.com
Reprinted with Permission
Paul Cox defines the Law of Zero
Return by the formula: Return on
Investment =
Inflation + Taxes. In
other words, an investment has zero
return
if all profits are consumed b\
inflation and taxes leaving no return
which could be used for discretionary
items, for example entertainment, a
new car. etc.
The formula and rule appear in 2<»

EXERCISES
To illustrate, consider an investment ofSW.OOO which returns $500 in one year in questions 1-3 below.
If the inflation rate was 3.5% and
an income tax rate was 139c, was
the investment one of zero
return? Hint: First, determine the
base of each percent. Are they the
same?
2. What change in the inflation rate
would make
it a zero return
investment?
3. What change in the tax rate would
make
it a zero return investment?
Good financial planning requires an understanding of policies and issues that may influence future
earnings. Consider the following statement:
"inflation affects vour income in three ways. First, your dollars are worth less over time, even though you
may have more of them. Second, the money you gain just to keep up with inflation
is subjected to additional
taxes. Third, because income tax is progressive— the more money \ou earn the higher your tax burden
inflation is pushing people into higher tax brackets than they cannot afford. Tax rates are not adjusted by
inflation. That 30.6
(
i top tax rate that the middle class did not care about in 1993 because
it was onl\
"rich."
will eventually become the tax rate of the middle class as inflation raises the cost of li\ ing."
4. What evidence can you find that indicates the federal government
is monitoring inflation and the
tax burden'.' Have an\
policies been proposed or actions taken to control or corrct
this'.'

American Units
Identifying the Basic Unit Equivalencies
in the American System
We often ask questions about measurements. How far
is
it to work? How
much does this bottle hold? What is the weight of this box? How long will
it
be until exams? To answer these questions we need to agree on a unit of meas-
ure for each type of measurement.
At present there are two main systems of measurement, each with
its
own set of units: the metric system and the American system. Nearly all coun-
tries in the world use the metric system. In the United States, however, except
in science, most measurements are made in American units.
The United States is using the metric system more and more frequent-
ly, however, and may eventually convert to metric units as the standard. But
for now we need to be familiar with both systems. We cover American units
in this section.
One of the most familiar measuring devices
is a ruler that measures
lengths as great as
1 foot. It is divided into 12 inches; that is,
1 foot =
12 inches.

We can choose to measure an object—say, a bridge—using a small unit
(an inch), a larger unit (a foot), or a still larger unit (a mile). We may say that
the bridge spans 7920 inches. 660 feet, or an eighth of a mile. Although we
probably would not choose to express our measurement in inches because
this is not a convenient measurement to work with for an object as long as a
bridge, the bridge length
is the same whatever unit of measurement we use.
Notice that the smaller the measuring unit, the larger the number of
those units in the final measurement. The inch
is the smallest unit in our ex-
ample, and the inch measurement has the greatest number of units (7
C)20).
The mile is the largest unit, and
it has the smallest number of units (an eighth
equals 0.1 25). Whatever measuring system

Converting from One Unit of Measure to Another
To convert or change one measurement to another, we simply multiply by 1
since multiplying by 1 does not change the value of a quantity. For example,
to convert 180 inches to feet, we look for a name for 1 that has inches and feet.

it might help to look at a simpler problem, [f the businessman had
left his car for two hours, we would multiply.
The fraction bar

1.50 dollars
1 hour
•
2 hours = 3.00 dollars or $3.00

372
Chapter 6 Measurement
Thus, if the businessman had left his car for two hours, he would have
been charged $3. We see that we need to multiply $1.50 by the number
of hours the car was in the garage to solve the problem.
Since the original problem gave the time in days, not hours, we will
need to change the days to hours.
2. Solve and state the answer.
Now that we know that the way to solve the problem is to multiply by
hours, we will begin. To make our calculations easier we will write 2 \ as
2.25. Change days to hours. Then multiply by $1.50 per hour.

The garage charges $1.50 per hour. How much did she pay to park the car?
Alternative Method Using Proportions
How did people first come up with the idea of multiplying by a unit fraction?
What mathematical principles are involved here? Actually, this is the same as
solving a proportion. Consider Example 5, where we changed 34 quarts to
8.5 gallons by multiplying.
1 gallon
34
34 XHiaTtS' X
= — gallons = 8.5 gallons
4jqttartS"

What we were actually doing is setting up the proportion:
1 gallon is to 4 quarts as n gallons is to 34 quarts
1 gallon
n gallons
4 quarts
34 quarts
1 gallon X 34 quarts = 4 quarts X n gallons
Cross multiplying
1 gallon X 34 jquartS"
A j^t&rtS' X n gallons
=
Dividing both sides
4 .quart?
A .quarts'
of the equation by 4 quarts
34
1 gallon X — = n gallons
Simplifying
8.5 gallons = n gallons
Thus the number of gallons is 8.5. Using proportions takes a little longer, so
multiplying by a fractional name for
1
is the more popular method.

Understanding Prefixes in Metric Units
The metric system of measurement is used in most industrialized nations of
the world. As we move toward a global economy, it is important to be famil-
iar with the metric system. The metric system is designed for ease in calculating
and in converting from one unit to another.
In the metric system, the basic unit of length measurement is the meter.
A meter is just slightly longer than a yard. To be more precise, the meter is ap-
proximately 39.37 inches long.
1 meter
1 yard
Approximately 39.37 inches
Exactly 36 inches
Units that are larger or smaller than the meter are based on the meter
and powers of 10. For example, the unit dekameter is ten meters. The unit
decimeter is one-tenth of a meter. The prefix dekameans 10. What does the pre-
fix deci mean? All the prefixes in the metric system are names for multiples
of 10. A list of metric prefixes and their meanings follows.
Prefix
Meaning
kilo-
thousand
hecto-
hundred
deka-
ten
deci-
tenth
centi-
hundredth
milli-
thousandth
The most commonly used prefixes are kilo-, centi-, and milli-. Kilo- means
thousand, so a &//c>meter is a thousand meters. Similarly, centi- means one
hundredth, so a centimeter is one hundredth of a meter. And milli- means one
thousandth, so a millimeter is one thousandth of a meter.
The kilometer is used to measure distances much larger than the meter.
How far did you travel in a car? The centimeter is used to measure shorter
lengths. What are the dimensions of this textbook? The millimeter is used to
measure very small lengths. What is the width of the lead in a pencil?
^ EXAMPLE

Converting from One Metric Unit of Length to Another
How do we convert from one metric unit to another? For example, how do
we change 5 kilometers into an equivalent number of meters?
Recall from Chapter 3 that when we multiply by 10 we move the deci-
mal point one place to the right. When we divide by 10 we move the decimal
point one place to the left. Let's see how we use this idea to change from one
metric unit to another.

Section 6.2
Metric Measurements: Length
377
Changing from Larger Metric Units to Smaller Ones
When you change from one metric prefix to another by moving to the
right on this prefix chart, move the decimal point to the right the same
number of places.

Thus 1 meter =
100 centimeters because we move two places to the right on the
chart of prefixes and we also move the decimal point ( 1 .(X)) two places to the right.
Now let us examine the four most commonly used metric measurements
of length and their abbreviations.
Commonly Used Metric Lengths
1 kilometer (km) = 1000 meters
1 meter (m) (the basic unit of length in the metric system)
1 centimeter (cm) = 0.01 meter
1 millimeter (mm) = 0.001 meter
Now let us see how we can change a measurement stated in a larger unit
to an equivalent measurement stated in smaller units.
• EXAMPLE 2
(a) Change 5 kilometers to meters.
(b) Change 20 meters to centimeters.
(a) To go from kilometer to meter, we move three places to the right on the
prefix chart. So we move the decimal point three places to the right.
5 kilometers = 5.000 meters (move three places) = 5000 meters
(b) To go from meter to centimeter, we move two places to the right on the
prefix chart. Thus we move the decimal point two places to the right.
20 meters = 20.00 centimeters (move two places) = 2000 centimeters
Practice Problem 2
(a) Change 4 meters to centimeters.
(b) Change 30 centimeters to millimeters.

Changing from Smaller Metric Units to Larger Ones

(b) Change 56 millimeters to kilometers.

prefix chart. Thus we move the decimal point two places to the left.
163 centimeters =
1.63.
meters (move two places to the left)
=
1.63 meters
(b) To go from millimeter to kilometer, we move six places to the left on the
prefix chart. Thus we move the decimal point six places to the left.
56 millimeters = 0.000056. kilometer
(move six places to the left)
= 0.000056 kilometer
Practice Problem 3
(a) Change 3 millimeters to meters.
(b) Change 47 centimeters to kilometers.

Thinking Metric
Long distances are customarily measured in kilometers. A kilometer is about
0.62 mile. It takes about 1.6 kilometers to make a mile. The following draw-
ing shows the relationship between the kilometer and the mile.
1 kilometer
1 mile (about 1.6 kilometers)
Many small distances are measured in centimeters. A centimeter is about
0.394 inch. It takes 2.54 centimeters to make an inch. You can get a good idea
of their size by looking at a ruler marked in both inches and centimeters.
1 centimeter
1 inch
(2.54 centimeters)
Try to visualize how many centimeters long or wide this book is. It is 21
centimeters wide and 27.5 centimeters long.
A millimeter is a very small unit of measurement, often used in manu-
facturing.
0.8 mm
-J
U 6 mm

The threaded end of a
bolt mav be 6 mm wide.
A paper clip is made

Now that you have an understanding of the size of these metric units, let's
try to select the most convenient metric unit for measuring the length of an
object.

The most frequent metric conversions in length are done between kilo-
meters,
meters,
centimeters,
and
millimeters.
Their
abbreviations
are
km. m. cm. and mm. and vou should be able to use them correctlv.
^ EXAMPLE 5
Convert.
(a) 982 cm to m
(b)
5.2 m to mm
In the first case, we move the decimal point to the left because we are
going from a smaller unit to a larger unit.
(a)
982 cm = 9.82 m
(two places to left)
= 9.82 m
In the last case, we need to move the decimal point to the right because
we are going from a larger unit to a smaller unit.
(b)
5.2 m = 5200. mm
(three places to left)
= 5200 mm
Practice Problem 5
Convert.
(a) 375 cm to m
(b) 46 m to mm ^
The other metric units of length are the hectometer, the dekameter. and
the decimeter. These are not used very frequently, but
it
is good to under-
stand how their lengths relate to the basic unit, the meter. A complete list of
the metric lengths we have discussed appears in the following table.

• EXAMPLE 6
Convert
(a) 426 decimeters to kilometers
(b)
9.47 hectometers to meters
(a) We are converting from a smaller unit, dm, to a larger one, km. There-
fore, there will be fewer kilometers than decimeters. (The number we get
will be smaller than 426.) We move the decimal point four places to the
left.
426 dm = 0.0426. km
(four places to left)
= 0.0426 km
(b) We are converting from a larger unit, hm, to a smaller one, m. Therefore,
there will be more meters than hectometers. (The number will be larger
than 9.47.) We move the decimal point two places to the right.
9.47 hm = 9.47 m
(two places to right)
= 947 m

Sidelight: Extremely Large Metric Distances
Is the biggest length in the metric system a kilometer? Is the smallest length
a millimeter? No. The system extends to very large units and very small ones.
Usually, only scientists use these units.
1 gigameter = 1,000,000,000 meters
1 megameter = 1,000,000 meters
1 kilometer = 1000 meters
1 meter
1 millimeter = 0.001 meter
1 micrometer = 0.000001 meter
1 nanometer = 0.000000001 meter
For example, 26 megameters equals a length of 26,000,000 meters. A
length of 31 micrometers equals a length of 0.000031 meter.

Metric Measurements: Volume and Weight
Converting between Metric Units of Volume
As products are distributed worldwide, more and more of them are being
sold in metric units. Soft drinks come in
1-. 2-. or 3-liter bottles. Labels often
contain these amounts in both American units and metric units. Get used to
looking at these labels to gain a sense of the size oi metric units of volume.
The basic metric unit for volume is the liter. A liter is defined as the
\ ol-
ume of a box 10 cm x
10 cm x 10 cm. or 1000 cm". A cubic centimeter may
be written as cc. so we sometimes see 1000 cc =
1
liter. A liter is slightly larg-
er than a quart:
1 liter of liquid is 1.057 quarts of that liquid.
The most common metric units of volume are the milliliter, the liter, and
the kiloliter. Often a capital letter L is used as an abbreviation for liter.
Common Metric Volume Measurements
1 kiloliter (kL) = 1000 liters
1 liter (L)
1 milliliter (mL) = 0.001 liter

The prefixes for liter follow the pattern we have seen for meter. Note that
kilo- is three places to the left of the liter and milli- is three places to the right.
Because the kiloliter. the liter, and the milliliter are the most commonly used
units of volume, we will focus exclusively on them in this text.

Converting Between Metric Units of Weight
One Gram
In a science class we make a distinction between weight and mass. Mass is
of Water ^~
^g amount of material in an object. Weight is a measure of the pull of grav-
i cm
ity on an object. The farther you are from the center of the earth, the less you
i cm
weigh. If you were in an astronaut suit floating in outer space you would be
weightless. The mass of your body, however, would not change. Throughout
this book we will refer to weight only. The technical difference between weight
and mass is not something we need to pay attention to in everyday life.
In the metric system the basic unit of weight is the gram. A gram is the
weight of the water in a box that is 1 centimeter on each side. To get an idea
of how small a gram is. we note that two small paper clips weigh about 1 gram.
A gram is only about 0.035 ounce.
One kilogram is 1000 times larger than a gram. A kilogram weighs about
2.2 pounds. Some of the measures of weight in the metric system are shown
in the following chart.
Common Metric Weight Measurements
1 metric ton (t) = 1,000,000 grams
1 kilogram (kg) = 1000 grams
1 gram (g)
1 milligram (mg) = 0.001 gram

Sidelight
When dealing with very small particles or atomic elements, scientists some-
times use units smaller than a gram.
Small Weight Measurements
1 milligram = 0.001 gram
1 microgram = 0.000001 gram
1 nanogram = 0.000000001 gram
1 picogram = 0.000000000001 gram
We could make the following conversions.
2.6 picograms = 0.0026 nanogram
29.7 micrograms = 0.0297 milligram
58 nanograms = 58,000 picograms
58 nanograms = 0.058 microgram

Converting Units of Length, Volume, or Weight
Between the Metric and American Systems
So far we've seen how to convert units when working within either the Amer-
ican or the metric system. Many people, however, work in both the metric
and the American systems. If you study such fields as chemistry, electro-
mechanical technology, business, X-ray technology, nursing, or computers, you
will probably need to convert measurements between the two systems.
To convert between American units and metric units, it is helpful to have
equivalent values. The most commonly used equivalents are listed in the fol-
lowing table. Most of these are approximate.

Remember that to convert from one unit to another you multiply by a
fraction that is equivalent to 1. Create a fraction from the equivalent measures
table so that the unit in the denominator cancels the unit you are changing.
To change 5 miles to kilometers, we look in the table and find that
1 mile ~ 1.61 kilometers. We will use the unit fraction
1.61 knotneters
kjjjojrii
because we want to have miles in the denominator.
1.61 kilometers
5 .miters' X
1 jx&e
= 5 x
1.61 kilometers = 8.05 kilometers
Thus 5 miles ~ 8.05 kilometers.
Is this the only way to do the problem? No. To make the previous con-
version, we also could have used the relationship that 1 kilometer ~ 0.62 mile.
Again, we want to have miles in the denominator, so we use
1 kilbmeter
O. frZ rhj le
5 jjHtefS" x
1 kilometers
0.62j»He'
0.62
8.06 kilometers
Using this approach, we find that 5 miles « 8.06 kilometers. This is not
the same result we obtained before. The discrepancy between the results of
the two conversions has occurred because the numbers given in the equiva-
lent measures tables are approximations.

Ofien we have to make conversions in order to make comparisons
example, is the 6 inches of attic insulation commonly used in the north-
ern United States more or less than the 16 centimeters of attic insulation
commonly used in Sweden? In order to find out we would have to convert 6
inches to centimeters. As we will see in Example 1(b) 6 inches is somewhat less
than 16 centimeters.

Suppose we consider a rectangle that measures 2 yards wide by 4 yards long.
The area would be 2 yards X 4 yards = 8 square yards. How could you change
8 square yards to square meters? Suppose that we look at 1 square yard. Each
side is 1 yard long, which is equivalent to 0.9144 meter.

Converting Temperature Readings
Between Fahrenheit and Celsius Degrees
In the metric system, temperature is measured on the Celsius scale. Water
boils at 100° (100°C) and freezes at 0°(0°C) on the Celsius scale. In the
Fahrenheit system, water boils at 212°(212°F) and freezes at 32°(32°F).
To convert Celsius to Fahrenheit, we can use the formula
F = 1.8 X C + 32,
where C is the number of Celsius degrees and F is the number of
Fahrenheit degrees.
^ EXAMPLE 6
When the temperature
is 35°C what
is the Fahrenheit
reading?
F = 1.8 X C + 32
=
1.8 X 35 + 32
= 63 + 32
= 95
The temperature is 95°F.
Practice Problem 6
Convert 20°C to Fahrenheit temperature.
^
To convert Fahrenheit temperature to Celsius, we can use the formula
5 x F - 160
C =
9
where F is the number of Fahrenheit degrees and C is the number of
Celsius degrees.

Putting Your Skills to Work
Ships and Nautical Miles
Although land speeds of trains and cars are almost
always measured in miles per hour, speeds of boats
and airplanes are usually measured in knots, or nau-
tical miles per hour. A nautical mile contains ap-
proximately 6080 feet, compared to 5280 feet in a
land mile. To understand the properties of boats and
ships, we will need to be more familiar with nauti-
cal miles and speeds measured in knots.
The Queen Elizabeth II is considered one of the
finest passenger ships in the world. It measures 963
feet long, weighs 70,327 tons, and carries 1778 pas-
sengers.

2. Solve and state the answer.
First we convert 5.04 kiloliters to liters.
5.04 kiloliters = 5040 liters
Now we find out how many barrels can be filled. How many 210-liter
barrels will 5040 liters fill? Visualize fitting 210-liter barrels into a big
barrel that holds 5040 liters. (Use rectangular barrels.)
We need to divide

Thus we can fill 24 of the 210-liter barrels.
3. Check.
Estimate each value. First 5.04 kiloliters is approximately 5 kiloliters or

Converting Between the Different Temperature Scales
Chad Palmer
USA TODAY, 11/01/00
Copyright 2000. USA TODAY. Reprinted with permission.
Measurement of temperature
is found in every weather
report on radio, tv. or in the newspaper. In the United
States we use the Fahrenheit scale. In Canada, our close
neighbor, the Celsius scale
is used. In situations where
only positive temperatures are desired, the Fahrenheit
and Celsius scales are modified to become the Kelvin and
Rankin scales, respectively.
The following formulae relate the different temperature
scales. The subscripts F. C. K and R indicate temperatures
in
Fahrenheit.
Celsius.
Kelvin,
and
Rankin
scales,
respectively.
TF = - (Tc ) + 32
TK = Tc + 273
(tf - 32;
TR = TF + 460
Another method for conversion back and forth between
Fahrenheit and Celsius scales is the following: Regardless
of which direction you want to convert. Fahrenheit to Cel-
sius or Celsius to Fahrenheit, always first add 40 to the
number. Next multiply by § orf, then always substract out
the 40 you just added. For example:
Convert Celsius zero, freezing, to Fahrenheit freezing

Angles
Understanding and Using Angles
Geometry is a branch of mathematics that deals with the properties of and re-
lationships between figures in space. One of the simplest figures is a line. A
line
«-> extends indefinitely, but a portion of a line, called a line segment, has
a beginning and an end. An angle
is formed whenever two lines meet. The
two line segments are called the sides of the angle. The point at which they
meet is called the vertex of the angle.

The "amount of opening" of an angle can be measured. Angles are com-
monly measured in degrees. In the preceding sketch the angle measures 30 de-
grees, or 30°. The symbol
° indicates degrees. If you fix one side of an angle
and keep moving the other side, the angle measure will get larger and larger
until eventually you have gone around in one complete revolution.

We call two lines perpendicular when they meet at an angle of 90°. A
90° angle is called a right angle. A 90° angle is often indicated by a small
at
the vertex. Thus when you see — you know that the angle is 90° and also that
the sides are perpendicular to each other. The following three angles are right
angles.
Often, to avoid confusion, angles are labeled with
letters. Suppose we
consider the angle with a vertex at point B. This angle can be called L ABC
or L CBA. Notice that when three letters are used, the middle letter
is the
vertex. This angle can also be called L B or L.v.
Now consider the following angles.We could label angle
\ as angle DEF
or angle FED. However, we could not label
it as
.
/
because this would be
unclear. If we refer to L E. people would not know for sure whether we mean
419

420
Chapter 7 Geometry
angle DEF. angle FEG. or angle DEC In such cases where there might be
some confusion, the use of the three-letter label is always preferred.
Certain types of angles are commonly encountered. It
is important to
learn their names. An angle that measures 180° is called a straight angle. Angle
ABC in the following figure is a straight angle. As we mentioned previously,
this is one-half of a revolution.
180°
An angle whose measure is between 0° and 90
c
is called an acute angle.
L DEF and L GHJ are both acute angles.
An angle whose measure
is between 90° and 180°
is called an obtuse
angle. L ABC and L JKL are both obtuse angles.
^ EXAMPLE
1
In the following sketch, determine which angles are acute,
obtuse, right, or straight angles.
L ABC and L CBD are acute angles. L CBE is an obtuse angle. LABD and
L DBE are right angles, and L ABE is a straight angle.
Practice Problem

In the following sketch, determine which angles are acute,
obtuse, right, or straight angles.

Section 7.1

421
Two angles that have a sum of 90° are called complementary angles. We
can therefore say that each angle is the complement of the other. Two angles
that have a sum of 180° are called supplementary angles. In this case we say
that each angle is the supplement of the other.
• EXAMPLE 2
Angle A measures 39°.
(a) Find the complement of angle A.
(b)
Find the supplement of angle A
(a) Complementary angles have a sum of 90°. So the complement of angle A
is 90° - 39° = 51°.
(b) Supplementary angles have a sum of 180°. So the supplement of angle A
is 180° - 39° =
141°.
Practice Problem 2
Angle B measures 83°.
(a) Find the complement of angle B.
(b)
Find the supplement of angle B.
&
Four angles are formed when two lines intersect. Think of how you have
four angles if two straight streets intersect. The two angles that are opposite
each other are called vertical angles. Vertical angles have the same measure.
In the following sketch, angle x and angle z are vertical angles, and they have
the same measure. Also, angle w and angle y are vertical angles, so they have
the same measure.
Now suppose we consider two angles that have a common side, such as
angle w and angle x. Two angles that are formed by intersecting lines and
share a common side are called adjacent angles. Adjacent angles of inter-
secting lines are supplementary. If we know that the measure of angle x
is
120°, then we also know that the measure of angle w is 60°.
• EXAMPLE 3
In the following sketch, two lines intersect forming four an-
gles. The measure of angle a is 55°. Find the measure of all the other angles.
Since L a and L c are vertical angles, we know that they have the same
measure. Thus we know that L c measures 55°.
Since L a and L b are adjacent angles of intersecting lines, we know
that they
are supplementary
angles. Thus we know
that L b measures
180° - 55° =
125°.
Finally, L b and L d are vertical angles, so we know that they have the
same measure. Thus we know that L d measures 125
.

gles. The measure of angle y

Chapter 7 Geometry
In mathematics there is a common notation for perpendicular lines. If
line m is perpendicular to line n, we write m _L n. Parallel lines never meet. If
line p is parallel to line q, we write p
II q.
One more situation that is very important in geometry involves lines
and angles. A line that intersects two or more lines at different points is called
a transversal. In the following figure, line m is a transversal that intersects line
n and line p. Alternate interior angles are two angles that are on opposite
sides of the transversal and between the other two lines. In the figure,^ c and
L w are alternate interior angles.
+p
Corresponding angles are two angles that are on the same side of the
transversal and are both above (or both below) the other two lines. In the
following figure, angle a and angle b are corresponding angles.
•+P
The most important case occurs when the two lines cut by the transver-
sal are parallel. We will state this as follows:
Parallel Lines Cut by a Transversal
If two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, then the measures of
corresponding angles are equal and the measures of alternate interior
angles are equal.

Rectangles and Squares
Finding the Perimeters of Rectangles and Squares
Geometry has a visual aspect that numbers and abstract ideas do not have. We
can take pen in hand and draw a picture of a rectangle that represents a room
with certain dimensions. We can easily visualize problems such as "What is the
distance around the outside edges of the room (perimeter)?" or "How much
carpeting will be needed for the room (area)?"
A rectangle is a four-sided figure like those shown here.
A rectangle has two interesting properties: (1) Any two adjoining sides are
perpendicular and (2) the lengths of the opposite sides of a rectangle are
equal. By "any two adjoining sides are perpendicular." we mean that any two
sides that meet form an angle that measures 90". When we say that "the lengths
of the opposite sides of a rectangle are equal." we mean that the measure of
one side
is equal to the measure of the side opposite to
it. If all four sides
have the same length, then the rectangle is called a square.

A farmer owns some land in the Colorado mountains. It is in the shape
of a rectangle. The perimeter of a rectangle is the sum of the lengths of all its
sides. To find the perimeter of the rectangular field shown in the following
figure, we add up the lengths of all the sides of the field.
18 miles
Perimeter =
7 miles -
18 miles
= 50 miles
7 miles + 18 miles
Thus the perimeter of the field is 50 miles.
We could also use a formula to find the perimeter of a rectangle. In the
formula we use letters to represent the measurements of the length and width
of the rectangle. Let
/ represent the length, w represent the width, and P rep-
resent the perimeter. Note that the length
is the longer side and the width
is
the shorter side. Since the perimeter is found b\ adding up the measurements
all around the rectangle, we see that
P = w + I + w +

When we write 2/ and 2vv, we mean 2 times
/ and 2 times w. We can use the
formula to find the perimeter of the rectangle.
P = 2/ + 2w
= (2)(18mi) + (2)(7mi)
= 36 mi + 14 mi
= 50 mi
Thus the perimeter can be found quickly by using the following formula.
The perimeter (P) of a rectangle is twice the length plus twice the width.
P = 2/ + 2w

P = 21 + 2w
= (2)(5.5cm) + (2)(3cm)
= 11 cm + 6 cm =
17 cm.

A square is a rectangle where all four sides have the same length. Some
examples of squares are shown in the following figure.
A square, then, is only a special type of rectangle. We can find the perime-
ter of a square just as we found the perimeter of a rectangle—by adding the
measurements of all the sides of the square. Because the lengths of all sides
are the same, the formula for the perimeter of a square is very simple. Let s
represent the length of one side and P represent the perimeter. So, to find
the perimeter, we multiply the length of a side by 4.
The perimeter of a square is four times the length of a side.

We can apply our knowledge to everyday problems. For example, by
knowing how to find the perimeter of a rectangle, we can find out how many
feet of picture framing a painting will need or how many feet of weather strip-
ping will be needed to seal a doorway. Consider the following problem.

Finding the Perimeter and Area of a Parallelogram
or a Rhombus
Parallelograms, rhombuses, and trapezoids are figures related to rectangles.
Actually, they are in the same "family," the quadrilaterals (four-sided figures).
For all these figures, the perimeter is the distance around the figure. But there
is a different formula for finding the area of each.
A parallelogram
is a four-sided figure in which both pairs of opposite
sides are parallel. The opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal in length.
The following figures are parallelograms. Notice that the adjoining sides
need not be perpendicular.

The perimeter of a parallelogram is the distance around the parallelogram. It
is found by adding the lengths of all the sides of the figure.

Practice Problem
1
Find the perimeter of the parallelogram in the margin.
To find the area of a parallelogram, we multiply the base times the height.
Any side of a parallelogram can be considered the base. The height is the
shortest distance between the base and the side opposite the base. The height
is a line segment that is perpendicular to the base. When we write the for-
mula for area, we use the lengths of the base (b) and the height (/?).
height
base
The area of a parallelogram is the base (b) times the height (h).
A = bh

Section 7.3
Parallelograms, Trapezoids, and Rhombuses
437
Why is the area of a parallelogram equal to the base times the height?
What reasoning leads us to that formula? Suppose that we cut off the trian-
gular region on one side of the parallelogram and move
it to the other side.

We now have a rectansle.

To find the area, we multiply the width by the length. In this case. A = bh.
Thus finding the area of a parallelogram is like finding the area of a rectan-
gle of length b and width h: A = bh.

A rhombus is a parallelogram with all four sides equal. The figure to the

problem involving a rhombus in Example 3.

• EXAMPLE 3
A truck
is manufactured with an iron brace welded to the
truck frame. The brace is shaped like a rhombus. The brace has a base of 9 inches
and a height of 5 inches. Find the perimeter and the area of this iron brace.
Since all four sides are equal, we merely multiply
P = 4(9 in.) = 36 in.
The perimeter of this brace is 36 inches.
Since the rhombus is a special type of parallelogram, we can use the area
formula for a parallelogram. In this case the base is 9 inches and the height
is
5 inches.
A = bh = (9in.)(5 in.) = 45 in.
2
Thus the area of the brace
is 45 square inches.

Chapter 7 Geometry
Finding the Perimeter and Area of a Trapezoid
A trapezoid is a four-sided figure with two parallel sides. The parallel sides are
called bases. The lengths of the bases do not have to be equal. The adjoining
sides do not have to be perpendicular.
Sometimes the trapezoid is sitting on a base. Then both bases are hori-
zontal. But be careful. Sometimes the bases are vertical. You can recognize the
bases because they are the two parallel sides. This becomes important when
you use the formula for finding the area of a trapezoid.
Look at the following trapezoids. See if you can recognize the bases.
12 m
5 m
18 m
3 m
The perimeter of a trapezoid is the sum of the lengths of all of its sides.
^^ EXAMPLE 4
Find the perimeter of the trapezoid on the left.
P = 18m + 5m + 12m + 5m
= 40 m
Practice Problem 4
Find the perimeter of a trapezoid with sides of 7 yd, 15 yd,
21 yd, and 13 yd.
^*
Remember, we often use parentheses as a way to group numbers
together. The numbers inside parentheses should be combined first.
(5)(7 + 2) = (5)(9)
First we add numbers inside the parentheses.
= 45
Then we multiply.
The formula for the area of a trapezoid uses parentheses in this way.
The height of a trapezoid is the distance between the two parallel sides.
The area of a trapezoid is one-half the height times the sum of the bases. (This
means you add the bases first.)
The area of a trapezoid with a shorter base b, a longer base B, and height
h is
A = h{b + B)
base = b
height = h
base = B

Finding the Measures of Angles in a Triangle
A triangle
is a three-sided figure with three angles. The prefix fn'-means
"three." Some triangles are shown.
Although all triangles have three sides, not all triangles have the same shape.
The shape of a triangle depends on the sizes of the angles and the lengths of
the sides.
We will begin our study of triangles by looking at the angles. Although
the sizes of the angles in triangles may be different, the sum of the angle meas-
ures of any triangle is always 180°.
The sum of the measures of the angles in a triangle is 180°.
We can use this fact to find the measure of an unknown angle in a triangle
if we know the measures of the other two angles.
^ EXAMPLE
1
In the triangle to the right,
angle A measures 35° and angle B measures 95°.
Find the measure of angle C.
We will use the fact that the sum of the measures of the angles of a tri-
angle is 180°.
35 + 95 + x = 180
130 + x = 180
What number x when added to 130 equals 180? Since 130 + 50 = 180. x must
equal 50.
Angle C must equal 50°.

A triangle with one 90° angle is called a right triangle.

perpendicular to the opposite side or an extension of the opposite side. The
height may be one of the sides in a right triangle. The base of a triangle
is
perpendicular to the height.

To find the area of a triangle, we need to be able to identify its height and base.
The area of any triangle is half of the product of the base times the height of the

Because the parallelogram has area A = bh and is made up of two tri-
angles of identical shape and area, the area of one of the triangles is the area

Evaluating the Square Root of a Number
That Is a Perfect Square
We know that by using the formula A =
s
2 we can quickly find the area of a
square with a side of 3 in. We simply square 3 in. That
is. A =
(3 in.) (3 in.) =
9 in.
2
. Sometimes we want to ask another kind of question. If a square has an
area of 64 in.
:
. what is the length of its sides?
3 in.
Area = 9 sq in.
s
The answer is 8 in. Why? The skill we need to find a number when we are
given the square of that number is called finding the square root. The square
root of 64 is 8.
If a number
is a product of two identical factors, then either factor
is
called a square root.
The square root of 64 is 8 because (8)(8) = 64.
The square root of 9 is 3 because (3)(3) =
9.
The symbol for finding the square root of a number is V~
. To write the square
root of 64. we write \ 64 =
8. Sometimes we speak of finding the square root
of a number as taking the square root of the number, or we can say that we
will evaluate the square root of the number. Thus to take the square root of
9. we write \ 9 =
3: to evaluate the square root of 9. we write V9 =

The numbers 20 or 48 are not perfect squares. There is no whole number that
when squared—multiplied by itself—yields 20 or 48. Consider 20. 4
2 =
16,
which
is less than 20. 5
2 = 25, which is more than 20. We realize, then, that
the square root of 20 is between 4 and 5 because 20 is between 16 and 25.
Since there is no whole number between 4 and 5, no whole number squared
equals 20. Since the square root of a perfect square
is a whole number, we
can say that 20 is not a perfect square.

Finding the Hypotenuse of a Right Triangle
When the Length of Each Leg Is Given
The Pythagorean Theorem is a mathematical idea formulated long ago. It is
as useful today as
it was when it was discovered. The Pythagoreans lived in
Italy about 2500 years ago. They studied various mathematical properties.
They discovered that for any right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse
equals the sum of the squares of the two legs of the triangle. This relation-
ship is known as the Pythagorean Theorem. The side opposite the right angle
is called the hypotenuse; the other two sides are called the legs of the right
triangle.

In a right triangle, the hypotenuse is the longest side. It is always opposite the
largest angle, the right angle. The legs are the two shorter sides. When we
know each leg of a right triangle, we use the following property.
Hypotenuse = V(leg)

Solving for the Missing Sides of Special Right Triangles
If we use the Pythagorean Theorem and some other facts from geometry, we
can find a relationship among the sides of two special right triangles. The first
special right triangle is one that contains an angle that measures 30° and one
that measures 60°. We call this the 30°-60°-90° right triangle.
In a 30°-60°-90° triangle the length of the leg opposite the 30° angle is 5
the length of the hypotenuse.
Notice that the hypotenuse of the first triangle is 10 m and the side op-
posite the 30° angle
is exactly \ of that, or 5 m.The second triangle has a hy-
potenuse of 15 yd. The side opposite the 30° angle is exactly \ of that, or 7.5 yd.

The second special right triangle is one that contains exactly two angles
that each measure 45°. We call this the 45
cM5°-90° right triangle.
In a 45
cM5°-90° triangle the lengths of the sides opposite the 45° angles
are equal. The length of the hypotenuse
is equal to V2 X
the length of
either leg.

Finding the Area and Circumference of a Circle
Every point on a circle is the same distance from the center of the circle, so
the circle looks the same all around. In geometry we study the relationship be-
tween the parts of a circle and learn how to calculate the distance around a
circle as well as the area of a circle.
A circle is a figure for which all points are at an equal distance from a
given point. This given point is called the center of the circle.
Center

Radius
Diameter
(a)
(b)
The diameter is a line segment
across the circle that passes
through the center.
The radius is a line segment
from the center
to a point on the circle.
We often use the words radius and diameter to mean the length of those
segments. Note that the plural of radius is radii. Clearly, then.
diameter = 2 X radius
or
d =
2r.
We could also say that
radius = diameter
-^ 2
or
d
r =
2'
The distance around the circle is called the circumference.
There is a special number called pi, which we denote by the symbol tt. tt is the
number we get when we divide the circumference of a circle by the diameter
C— =
tt. The value of tt is approximately 3.14159265359. We can approximate tt

to any number of digits. For all work in this book we will use the following.
tt is approximately 3.14, rounded to the nearest hundredth.
We find the circumference C of a circle by multiplying the length of the
diameter d times tt.
C — nd
^ EXAMPLE
1
Find the circumference of a quarter if we know the diam-
eter is 2.4 cm. Use tt » 3.14. Round to the nearest tenth.
C = nd = (3.14)(2.4cm) = 7.536 cm

An alternative formula is C =
2-rrr. Remember, d = 2r. We can use this
formula to find the circumference if we are given the length of the radius.
When solving word problems involving circles, be careful. Ask yourself,
"Is the radius given, or
is the diameter given?" Then do the calculations
accordingly.
^^ EXAMPLE 2
A bicycle tire has a diameter of 24 in. How many feet does
the bicycle travel if the wheel makes one revolution?
1. Understand the problem
The distance the wheel travels when
it makes
1
revolution
is the
circumference of the tire. Think of the tire unwinding.
Start
End
1 revolution
We are given the diameter. The diameter is given in inches. The answer
should be in feet.
2. Solve and state the answer.
Since we are given the diameter, we will use C =
ird. We use 3.14 for it.
C =

= (3.14)(24in.) - 75.36 in.
We will change 75.36 inches to feet.

(a) Estimate the area of a circle whose radius is 6 cm.
(b) Find the exact area of a circle whose radius

We must square the radius first before
multiplying by 3.14.

Newspaper Math
In February 2000. the Boston Globe followed other newspapers in the United States and decided to refor-
mat their paper. 2 inches has been taken off the width of the paper. The new size is easier to handle and more
economical to produce.
According to researchers. 10,000 tons of newsprint and 54,000 gallons of ink are saved each year. You
might wonder, does 2 inches really make a big difference? How much paper is saved each day? How much
money will be saved by producing a smaller newspaper?

Finding the Corresponding Parts of Similar Triangles
In English, "similar" means that the things being compared are. in general,
alike. But in mathematics, "similar" means that the things being compared
are alike in a special way—they are alike in shape, even though they may be
different in size. So photographs that are enlarged produce images similar to
the original: a floor plan of a building is similar to the actual building: a model
car is similar to the actual vehicle.
Two triangles with the same shape but not necessarily the same size are
called similar triangles. Here are two pairs of similar triangles.
E^
(d)
The two triangles on the right are similar. The
smallest angle in the
first triangle
is angle A.
The smallest angle in the second triangle is angle
D. Both angles measure 36°. We say that angle A
and angle D are corresponding angles in these
similar triangles.

The corresponding angles of similar triangles are equal.

These two triangles are
similar. Name the sides that
correspond.
First we turn the second triangle so that the shortest side is on the top,
the intermediate side is to the left, and the longest side is on the right.
Now the shortest side of each triangle
is on the top, the longest side of each

The perimeters of similar figures—whatever the figures—have the same

similar. The circumferences of two circles have the same ratio as their
radii.
To Think About
How would you find the relationship between the areas
of two
similar geometric
figures?
Consider
the
following two
similar
rectangles?
9m
7 m
21m
The area of the smaller rectangle is (3 m )( 7 m
) = 21 nr. The area of the larger
rectangle is (9m)(21 m) = 189 nr. How could you have predicted this result?
The ratio of small width to large width is
\ -
\
. The small rectangle has
sides that are
t as large as the large rectangle. The ratio of the area of the
small rectangle to the area of the large rectangle is^ =
\
. Note that u r =
5
.
Thus we can develop the following principle: The areas of two similar fig-
ures are in the same ratio as the square of the ratio of two corresponding
sides.

Applied Problems Involving Geometry
Solving Applied Problems Involving Geometric Shapes
We can solve many real-life problems with the geometric knowledge we now
have. Our everyday world is filled with objects that are geometric in shape, so
we can use our knowledge of geometry to find length, area, or volume. How
far is the automobile trip? How much framing, edging, or fencing is required?
How much paint, siding, or roofing is required? How much can we store? All
of these questions can be answered with geometry.
If it is helpful to you, use the Mathematics Blueprint for Problem Solving
to organize a plan to solve these applied problems.

f ~ 74
We round our answer to the nearest minute.
Thus the work can be done in approximately 74 minutes.
3.
Check.
Estimate the answer.
14 x 8 % 10 x 8 = 80 ft
2
12 x 8 ~ 10 X 8 = 80 ft
2
10 X 7 = 70 ft
2
8x7 = 56 ft
2
If we estimate the sum of the number of square feet, we will have
80 + 80 + 70 + 56 = 286 ft
2
.
Now since 60 minutes =
1 hour, we know that if you can paint 90 ft
2 in
20 minutes, you can paint 270 ft
2 in one hour. Our estimate of 286 ft
2
is slight-
ly more than 270 ft
2
, so we would expect that the answer would be slightly
more than one hour.
Thus our calculated value of 74 minutes (1 hour 14 minutes) seems
reasonable.

became fascinated with "the regular
division of a plane," as he called
it, a
principle that would determine much
of his later work. Divisions of the
plane,
called
"tessellations,"
are
arrangements of closed shapes that
completely cover the plane without
overlapping
and
without
leaving
gaps.
For example a 15' by 20' kitchen floor
could be covered with 300 square
tiles (also the area in square feet)
with side length of
1
foot or 3600
one-inch square chips (3600 sq. in. of
area). This pattern of square
tiles
forms a mosaic. We are assuming
these
tiles are not grouted. These
would be tessellations easy to visual-
ize and to create. The tiles themselves
could have any kind of pattern or
color desired. Escher went beyond
simple tessellations and used shapes
that would interlock in some way.
Look up Escher in any encyclopedia
for pictures of some of his tessella-
tions and other interesting works.
EXERCISES
To create and explore a few tessellations, answer the questions below.
Draw with a ruler a rectangle 2
inches by 3 inches and cover
it
with
1 inch by
1 inch tiles.
Drawing a diagonal for each
square will cover the rectangle
with right triangles. Work with a
friend and you will note that you
will agree as to the square
tessellations, but your triangle
tessellations might have a slightly
different pattern.
2. Cover the 2 inch by 3 inch
rectangle with rectangles.
This
is
most easily done by bisecting the
squares. For example, the width
would be half of the length.
Another easy tessellation would
be using strips of the same width.
Experiment with other rectangles
and other triangles.
( aver the 2 inch by 3 inch
rectangle with circles of 1/2 inch
radius. What do you notice
?
Either there
is space
left
in the
rectangle which
isn't covered or
there are circles hanging ovei
the
edge dI the rectangle. Putting
circles in a rectangle
is like
packing baseballs in a box.
4.
Finally, cover the rectangle with
an irregular shape, for example, a
fish, drawn to minimize gaps. You
will probabl) o\ei lap the edges of
the rectangle.

Circle Graphs
Reading a Circle Graph with Numerical Values
Statistics
is that branch of mathematics that collects and studies data. Once
the data are collected, they must be organized so that the information is ea>il\
readable. We use graphs to give a visual representation of the data that isc
q
to read. Graphs appeal to the eve. Their visual nature allows them to com-
municate information about the complicated relationships among statistical
data. For this reason, newspapers often use graphs to help their readers quickly
sp information.
Circle graphs are especially helpful for showing the relationship of parts
to a whole. The entire circle represents 100%; the pie-shaped pieces represent
the subcategories. The following circle graph divides the 10.000 students at
Westline College into five categories.

Bar Graphs and Line Graphs
Reading and Interpreting a Bar Graph
Bar graphs are helpful for seeing changes over a period of time. Bar graphs
or line graphs are especially helpful when the same type of data is repeatedly
studied. The following bar graph shows the approximate population of
California from 1940 to 2000.
Approximate Population of California
Year
Source U.S. Census Bureau
^ EXAMPLE
1
What was the approximate population of California in
2000?
The bar for 2000 rises to 33. This represents 33 million; thus the
approximate population was 33,000,000.
Practice Problem
1
What was the approximate population of California in
1980?
•
• EXAMPLE 2
What was the increase in population from 1980 to 1990?
The bar for 1980
rises
to
24. Thus the approximate population
is
24,000.000. The bar for 1990 rises to 30. Thus the approximate population is
30,000,000. To find the increase in population from 1980 to 1990, we subtract.
30,000,000 - 24,000,000 = 6,000,000
Practice Problem 2
What was the increase in population from 1940 to 1960?

Reading and Interpreting a Double-Bar Graph
Double-bar graphs are useful for making comparisons. For example, when a
company
is analyzing its sales,
it may want to compare different years or
different quarters. The following double-bar graph illustrates the sales of new
cars at a Ford dealership for two different years, 2000 and 2001 .The sales are
recorded for each quarter of the year.

• EXAMPLE 3
How many cars were sold in the second quarter of 2000?
The bar rises to 150 for the second quarter of 2000. Therefore, 150 cars
were sold.
Practice Problem 3
How many cars were sold in the fourth quarter of 2001?
^ EXAMPLE 4
How many more cars were sold in the third quarter of 2001
than in the third quarter of 2000?
From the double-bar graph, we see that 300 cars were sold in the third
quarter of 2001 and that 200 cars were sold in the third quarter of 2000.

Thus, 100 more cars were sold.

Reading and Interpreting a Line Graph
A line graph is useful for showing trends over a period of time. In a line graph
only a few points are actually plotted from measured values. The points are then
connected by straight lines to show a trend. The intervening values between
points may not lie exactly on the line. The following line graph shows the num-
ber of customers per month coming into a restaurant in a vacation community.
n
Mar
Apr
May
June
July
Aug
Month
^* EXAMPLE 5
In which month did the smallest number of customers come
into the restaurant?
The lowest point on the graph occurs for the month of April. Thus the
fewest number of customers came in April.
Practice Problem 5
In which month did the greatest number of customers
come into the restaurant?
^*
• EXAMPLE 6
(a) Approximately how many customers came into the restaurant during the
month of June?
(b) From May to June, did the number of customers increase or decrease?
(a) Notice that the dot
is halfway between 4 and 5. This represents a value
halfway between 4000 and 5000 customers. Thus we would estimate that
4500 customers came during the month of June.
(b) From May to June the line goes up, so the number of customers increased.

Practice Problem 6
(a) Approximately how many customers came into the restaurant during the
month of May?
(b) From March to April, did the number of customers increase or decrease?
^^ EXAMPLE 7
Between what two months w as the increase in the number
of customers the largest?
The line from June to July goes upward at the steepest angle. This rep-
resents the largest increase. (You can check this by reading the numbers from
the left axis.) Thus the greatest increase in attendance was between June
and July.
Practice Problem 7
Between what two months did the bitmest decrease occur?
Reading and Interpreting a Comparison Line Graph
Two or more sets of data can be compared by using a comparison line graph.
A comparison line graph shows two or more line graphs together. A differ-
ent style for each line distinguishes them. Note that using a blue line and a red
line in the following graph makes
it easy to read.

100 = 3500. Thus 3500 degrees were awarded in
computer science in 1998-1999.

Understanding and Interpreting a Histogram
In business or in higher education you are often asked to take data and
organize them in some way. This section shows you the technique for making
a histogram—a type of bar graph.
Suppose that a mathematics professor announced the results of a class
test. The 40 students in the class scored between 50 and 99 on the test. The
results are displayed on the following chart.
Scores on the Test
Class Frequency
50-59
4
60-69
6
70-79
16
80-89
8
90-99
6
The results in the table can be organized in a special type of bar graph known
as a histogram. In a histogram the width of each bar is the same. The width rep-
resents the range of scores on the test. This is called a class interval. The height
of each bar gives the class frequency of each class interval. The class frequency
is the number of times a score occurs in a particular class interval.

Scores on the test
^* EXAMPLE
1
How many students scored a B on the test if the professor
considers a test score of 80-89 a B?
Since the 80-89 bar rises to a height of 8, eight students scored a B on
the test.
Practice Problem
1
How many students scored a D on the test if the profes-
sor considers a test score of 60-69 a D?
*•
^ EXAMPLE 2
How many students scored less than 80 on the test?
From the histogram, we see that there are three different bar heights to
be included. Four tests were scored 50-59, six tests were scored 60-69, and
16 tests were scored 70-79. When we combine 4 + 6 + 16 = 26, we can see
that 26 students scored less than 80 on the test.
Practice Problem 2
How many students scored greater than 69 on the test?

The following histogram tells us about the length of life of 1 10 new light
bulbs tested at a research center. The number of hours the bulbs lasted is
indicated on the horizontal scale. The frequency of bulbs lasting that long
is indicated on the vertical scale.

Hours of operation of light bulbs
^ EXAMPLE 3
How many light bulbs lasted between 1400 and 1599 hours?
The bar with a range of 1400-1599 hours rises to 10. Thus 10 light bulbs
lasted that long.
Practice Problem 3
How many light bulbs lasted between 800 and 999 hours?
• EXAMPLE 4
How many light bulbs lasted less than 1000 hours?
We see that there are three different bar heights to be included. Five
bulbs lasted 400-599 hours. 15 bulbs lasted 600-799 hours, and 20 bulbs lasted
800-999 hours. We add 5 +
15 + 20 = 40. Thus 40 light bulbs lasted less than
1000 hours.
Practice Problem 4
How many light bulbs lasted more than
1 199 hours? ^
Constructing a Histogram from Raw Data
To construct a histogram, we start with raw data, data that have not yet been
organized or interpreted. We perform the following steps.
1. Select data class intervals of equal width for the data.
2. Make a table with class intervals and a tally (count) of how many
numbers occur in each interval. Add up the tally to find the class
frequency for each class inten al.
3. Draw the histogram.
First we will practice making the table. Later we will use the table to
draw the histogram.

Each number in the following chart represents the num-
ber of kilowatt-hours of electricity used in a home during a one-month peri-

Statistics
1. We select class intervals of equal width for the data. We choose intervals
of 200. We might have chosen smaller or larger intervals, but we choose
200 because
it gives us a convenient number of intervals to work with,
as we will see.
2. We make a table. We write down the class intervals, then count (tally)
how many numbers occur within each interval. Then we write the total.
This is the class frequency.

Mean, Median, and Mode
Finding the Mean of a Set of Numbers
We often want to know the "middle value" of a group of numbers. In thi^ sec-
Bon we learn that, in statistics, there is more than one way o\ describing this
middle value: there is the mean of the group of numbers, there is the median
of the group of numbers, and in most cases there
is a mode of the group of
numbers. In some situations it's more helpful to look at the mean: in others
it's more helpful to look at the median, and in yet others the mode. Well learn
to tell which situations lend themselves to one or the other.
The mean of a set of values is the sum of the values divided by the num-
ber of values. The mean is often called the average.
The mean value is often rounded to a certain decimal-place accuracy.

Finding the Median of a Set of Numbers
If a set of numbers is arranged in order from smallest to largest, the median
is that value that has the same number of values above
it as below
it.
If the numbers are not arranged in order, then the first step for finding
the median
is to put the numbers in order.
• EXAMPLE 2
Find the median value of the following costs for a mi-
crowave oven: $100, $60, $120, $200, $190, $120, $320, $290, $18
We must arrange the numbers in order from smallest to largest (or largest
to smallest).

Practice Problem 2
Find the median value of the following weekly salaries:
$320. $150, $400. $600, $290, $150, $450.
•
If a list of numbers contains an even number of items, then of course
there
is no one middle number. In this situation we obtain the median by
taking the average of the two middle numbers.
• EXAMPLE 3

Sidelight
When would someone want to use the mean, and when would someone want
to use the median? Which is more helpful?
The mean, or average, is used more frequently. It is most helpful when
the data are distributed fairly evenly, that is, when no one value is "much larg-
er" or "much smaller" than the rest.
For example, suppose a company had employees with annual salaries of
$9000, $11,000, $14,000, $15,000, $17,000, and $20,000. All the salaries fall with-
in a fairly limited range. The mean salary
9000 + 11,000 + 14,000 + 15,000 + 17,000 + 20,000
„,
„„„ „„
= $14,333.33
6
gives us a reasonable idea of the typical salary.
However, suppose the company had six employees with salaries of $9000.
$11 ,000, $14,000, $15,000, $17,000, and $90,000. Talking about the mean salary,
which
is $26,000, is deceptive. No one earns a salary very close to the mean
salary. The typical worker in that company does not earn around $26,000. In
this case, the median value is more appropriate. Here the median is $14,500.
See exercises 31 and 32 in Exercises 8.4 for more on this.

Section 8.4 Mean, Median, and Mode

Finding the Mode of a Set of Numbers
Another value that
is sometimes used to describe a set of data
is the mode.
The mode of a set of data
is the number or numbers that occur most often.
^ EXAMPLE 4
The following numbers are the weights of automobiles
measured in pounds:
2345. 2567. 2785. 2967. 3105. 3105. 3245. 3546
Find the mode of these weights.
The value 3105 occurs twice, whereas each of the other values occurs
just once. Thus the mode is 3105 pounds.
Practice Problem 4
The following numbers are the heights in inches of 10 male
students in Basic Mathematics: 64. 66. 67. 69. 70. 71, 71. 73. 75, 76.
Find the mode of these heights.
^^
A set of numbers may have more than one mode.
^ EXAMPLE 5
The following numbers are finish times for 12 high school
students who ran a distance of one mile. The finish times are measured in
minutes.
290. 272. 268, 260, 290. 272. 330. 355. 368, 290. 370. 272
Find the mode of these finish times.
First we need to arrange the numbers in order from smallest to largest
and include all repeats.
260. 268, 272, 272. 272. 290. 290. 290. 330. 355, 368, 370
Now we can see that the value 272 occurs three times, as does the value 290.
Thus the modes for these finish times are 272 minutes and 290 minutes.
Practice Problem 5
The following numbers are distances in miles that
16

. 33. 27. 3. 28
Find the mode of these distances.
^
A set of numbers may have no mode at
all. For example, the set of numbers
50. 60. 70, 80. 90 has no mode because each number occurs just once. The set
of numbers 33, 33. 44. 44. 55. 55 has no mode because each number occurs
twice. If all numbers occur the same number of times, there
is no mode.

To Think About
Finding the grade point average or GPA.
At most universities and colleges, students are assigned grade point values lor the grades the} have
earned. A student's grade point average is the average of all the grade point \alues for the credit hours
taken. In most schools, the grade point values are A -
4. B -
3. C =
2. D -
1, and F =
0.
To find your GPA you need to multiply the number of credit hours of each course
\ oil ha\ e taken
by the grade point value you received for the course. Add the results. Then divide b\
the total number
of credit hours.
Suppose you took a six credit hour course and received a grade of B and a three credit hour course
and receival a grade of A. Multiply 6(3) = 18 as well as 3(4) =
12. Add the results: 18 +
12 = 30. Since
you have a total of nine credit hours, you need to divide by 9. 30
-5- 9 = 3.33333
Rounded to the
nearest tenth, vour GPA is 3.3.
In exercises 41 and 42, find the GPA rounded to the nearest tenth.

John Allen Paulos
A professor of mathematics at Temple
University. John Allen Paulos is the author

the Newspaper and writes the "Who's
Counting" column for ABCnews.com.
Reprinted with Permission of John Allen
Paulos.
"Conducting surveys can seem
as
straightforward as adding numbers.
But when the surveys get personal,
well, accuracy can get elusive."
Professor Paulos suggests, by using a
simple coin flip, that
it is mathemat-
ically possible to obtain sensitive in-
formation about a group of people
without compromising anyone's pri-
vacy If we want to discover what per-
centage of a large group of people
has ever X-ed—betrayed a spouse,
cheated in school, or whatever—we
can use the following technique:
Have each member of the survey
group
flip a coin, but without
anyone else seeing the results. If
the coin lands tails, the person is
told to answer the question hon-
estly: Has he or she ever X-ed.
yes
or no?
If the
coin
lands
heads, the person
is to answer
yes. regardless of the correct an-
swer. So a yes response could
mean one
of two
things, one
quite
innocuous
(obtaining
a
head), the other potentially em-
barrassing (X-ing). Since the ex-
perimenter can't know what the
yes means, people presumably
will be more honest.
It's not
difficult to infer from the num-
ber of yes responses what per-
centage of the population have
X-ed—without
learning any-
thing
about
any
particular
individual.
For example, if 580 out of 1000 peo-
ple answer "yes." what percentage of
this group has ever X-ed? Since on a
fair coin toss the expected number of
heads in 1000 tosses would be 500.
then 80 of those 580 yeses represent
people who have X-ed which would
be 80/500 or 167c
This somewhat controversial approach to conducting a statistical survey has caused a variety of reactions from
mathematicians. Assuming that this method
is valid, try to answer the following questions.
EXERCISES
Apply the technique to answer questions 1—4.
1.
If 500 people flipped one fair coin,
what would be the expected
number of heads?
2. Try an experiment with 30 flips of
a fair coin. The expected number
of heads
is
15. Did you get 15? Do
you have to get 15? Was
it close
to 15?
In an attempt to estimate the
extent of cheating at a university,
a random selection of 500 students
were asked
if they had ever seen
cheating or had cheated
themselves. If there were 270 yes
responses, what
is the estimated
number and percentage of
students who had cheated or had
seen cheating?
4. From Problem 3. what conclusions
are possible if 250 yeses were
received? Less than 250 veses?

Adding Two Signed Numbers with the Same Sign
In Chapters 1-8 we worked with whole numbers, fractions, and decimals. In
this chapter we enlarge the set of numbers we work with to include numbers
that are less than zero. Many real-life situations require using numbers that
are less than zero. A debt that is owed, a financial loss, temperatures that fall
below zero, and elevations that are below sea level can be expressed only in
numbers that are less than zero, or negative numbers.
The following is a graph of the financial reports of four small airlines
for the year. It shows positive numbers—those numbers that rise above zero
and negative numbers—those numbers that fall below zero. The positive num-
bers represent money gained. The negative numbers represent money lost.

—300,000 is recorded for Pacific Airways. What does this mean?
Another way to picture positive and negative numbers is on a number
line. A number line is a line on which each point is associated with a number.
The numbers may be positive or negative, whole numbers, fractions, or deci-
mals. Positive numbers are to the right of zero on the number line. Negative
numbers are to the left of zero on the number line. Zero is neither positive nor
negative.

Positive numbers can be written with a plus sign—for example. +2—but
this is not usually done. Positive 2 is usually written as 2. It is understood that
the sign of the number is positive although it is not written. Negative numbers
must always have the negative sign so that we know they are negative num-
bers. Negative 2 is written as -2. The sign of the number is negative. The set
of positive numbers, negative numbers, and zero is called the set of signed
numbers.

Order
Signed numbers are named in order on the number line. Smaller numbers
are to the left. Larger numbers are to the right. For any two numbers on the
number line, the number on the left is less than the number on the right.
We use the symbol < to mean "is less than." Thus the mathematical sentence
-2 < -1 means "-2 is less than- 1." We use the symbol > to mean "is greater
than." Thus the mathematical sentence 5 > 3 means "5 is greater than 3."

Absolute Value
Sometimes we are only interested in the distance a number is from zero. For
example, the distance from
to +3 is 3. The distance from
to -3 is also 3. No-
tice that distance is always a positive number, regardless of which direction we
travel on the number line. This distance is called the absolute value.
The absolute value of a number is the distance between that number and
zero on the number line.
The symbol for absolute value is
|
|. When we write |5|,we are looking for the
distance from
to 5 on the number line. Thus
|5| =
5. This is read. "The ab-
solute value of 5
is 5." |-5|
is the distance from
to -5 on the number line.
Thus
| -5
1 =
5. This is read, "The absolute value of -5 is 5."

When we find the absolute value of an) nonzero number, we always get

same sign. Although you are already familiar with the addition of positive
numbers, we will look at an example.
Suppose that we earn $52 one day and earn $38 the next day. To learn
what our two-day total is, we add the positive numbers. We earn
$52 + $38 = +$90.

We can show this sum on a number line by drawing an arrow that starts at
and points 52 units to the right (because 52 is positive). At the end of this
arrow we draw a second arrow that points 38 units to the right. Note that the
second arrow ends at the sum, 90.
The money is coming in, and the plus sign records a gain. Notice that we
added the numbers and that the sign of the sum is the same as the sign of the
addends.
Now let's consider an example of addition of two negative numbers.
Suppose that we consider money spent as negative dollars. If we spend
$52 one day (-$52) and we spend $38 the next day (-$38), we must add two
negative numbers. What is our financial position?
-$52 + (-$38) = -$90
We have spent $90. The negative sign tells us the direction of the money: out!
Notice that we added the numbers and that the sign of the sum is the same
as the sign of the addends.
We can illustrate this sum on a number line by drawing a line that starts
at
and points 52 units to the left (because -52 is negative). At the end of this
arrow we add a second arrow that points 38 units to the left. This second arrow
ends at the sum, -90.

To add two numbers with the same sign:
1. Add the absolute value of the numbers.
2. Use the common sign in the answer.

Adding Two Signed Numbers with Different Signs
Let's look at some real-life situations involving addition of signed numbers
with different signs. Suppose that we earn $52 one day and we spend $38 the
next day. If we combine (add) the two transactions, it would look like
$52 + (-$38) = +$14.
On a number line we draw an arrow that starts at zero and points 52
units to the right. From the end of this arrow we draw an arrow that points 38
units to the
left. (Remember, the arrow points to the
left for a negative
number.)

This is a situation with which we are familiar. What we actually do is subtract.
That is, we take the difference between $52 and $38. Notice that the sign of
the larger number is positive and that the sign of the answer is also positive.
Let's look at another situation. Suppose we earn $38 and we spend $52.
The situation would look like this.
(-$52) + $38 = -$14
On a number line we draw an arrow that starts at zero and points 52 units to
the left. Again the arrow must point to the left to represent a negative number.
From the end of this arrow we draw an arrow that points 38 units to the
right.

On our number line we end up at -14.
In our real-life situation we end up owing $14. which
is represented by
a negative number. To find the sum. we actually find the difference between
$52 and $38. Notice that if we do not account for sign, the larger number is 52.
The sign of that number is negative and the sign of the answer is also nega-
te e. This suggests the addition rule for two numbers with different signs.
Addition Rule for Two Numbers with Different Signs
To add two numbers with different signs:
1. Subtract the absolute value of the numbers.
2. Use the sign of the number with the larger absolute value.

This makes the computation easier. If you are adding two numbers with dif-
ferent signs, place the number with the larger absolute value on top so that you
can find the difference easily. As noted, the commutative property of addition
holds for signed numbers.
Commutative Property of Addition
For any real numbers a and b,
a + b = b +
a.
^* EXAMPLE 6
Last night the temperature dropped to —14°F. From that
low, today the temperature rose 34°F. What was the highest temperature
today?
We want to add — 14°F and 34°F. Because addition is commutative, it
does not matter whether we add -14 + 34 or 34 + (—14).
34°F
+ -14°F
20°F^
The 34 is larger than 14. The difference between 34
and 14 is 20. The number with the larger absolute
value is positive, so the answer is positive.

Adding Three or More Signed Numbers

ciative, we may group the numbers to be added in any way. That
is.
it does
not matter which two numbers are added first.

Subtraction of Signed Numbers
Subtracting One Signed Number from Another
We begin our discussion by defining the word opposite. The opposite of a
positive number is a negative number with the same absolute value. For ex-
ample, the opposite of 7 is -7.
The opposite of a negative number is a positive number with the same
absolute value. For example, the opposite of -9 is 9. If a number is the oppo-
site of another number, these two numbers are at an equal distance from zero
on the number line.

The opposite of 2 is -2.
The sum of a number and its opposite is zero.
-3 + 3 =
2 + (-2) =
We will use the concept of opposite to develop a way to subtract integers.
Let's think about how a checking account works. Suppose that you de-
posit $25 and the bank adds a service charge of $5 for a new checkbook. Your
account looks like this:
$25 + (-$5) = $20
Suppose instead that you deposit $25 and the bank adds no charge. The next
day, you write a check for $5. The result of these two transactions is
$25 - $5 = $20
Note that your account has the same amount of money ($20) in both cases.
We see that adding a negative 5 to 25 is the same as subtracting a posi-
tive 5 from 25. That is, 25 + (-5) = 20 and 25 - 5 = 20.
Subtracting is equivalent to adding the opposite.

We define a rule for the subtraction of signed numbers.
Subtraction of Signed Numbers
To subtract signed numbers, add the opposite of the second number to
the first number.
Thus, to do a subtraction problem, we first change
it to an equivalent
addition problem in which the first number does not change but the second
number is replaced by its opposite. Then we follow the rules of addition for
signed numbers.

Write the opposite of 16,

Solving Simple Applied Problems That Involve
the Subtraction of Signed Numbers
When we want to find the difference in altitude between two mountains, we
subtract. We subtract the lower altitude from the higher altitude. Look at
the illustration at the left. The difference in altitude between A and B
is
3480 feet - 1260 feet - 2220 feet.
Land that
is below sea level
is considered to have a negative altitude.
The Dead Sea is 1312 feet below sea level. Look at the following illustration.
The difference in altitude between C and D
is 2590 feet - (—1312 feet) =
3902 feet.

Our pattern suggests that when we multiply a positive number times a nega-
tive number, we set a negative number. Thus we will state the following rule.
Multiplication Rule for Two Numbers with Different Signs
To multiply two numbers with different signs, multiply the absolute
values. The result
is negative.
• EXAMPLE 2
Multiply.
(a) 2(-8)

Multiplying Three or More Signed Numbers
When multiplying more than two numbers, multiply any two numbers first,
then multiply the result by another number. Continue until each factor has
been used.

Chemists have determined that a phosphate ion has an elec-

Removing 10 ions from a substance can be represented by the number
-10. We can use multiplication to determine the result of removing 10 ions
with an electrical charge of -3.
(-3)(-10) = 30
Thus the change in charge would be +30.

Changing Numbers in Standard Notation to Scientific Notation
Scientists who frequently work with very large or very small measurements
use a certain way to write numbers, called scientific notation. In our usual way
of writing a number, which we call "standard notation" or "ordinary form," we
would express
the
distance
to
the
nearest
star, Proxima
Centauri.
as
24,800.000,000,000 miles. In scientific notation, we more conveniently write
this as
2.48 x 10
13 miles.
For a very small number, like two millionths, the standard notation is
0.000002.
The same quantity in scientific notation is
2 X 10~6
.
Notice that each number in scientific notation has two parts:
(1) a number that is 1 or greater but less than 10, which is multiplied by
(2) a power of 10. That power is either a whole number or the negative of a
whole number. In this section we learn how to go back and forth between
standard and scientific notation.
A positive number is in scientific notation if it is in the form a x
10",
where a is a number greater than (or equal to) 1 and less than 10, and n
is an integer.
We begin our investigation of scientific notation by looking at large num-
bers. We recall from Section 1.6 that
10 = 10
1
100 = 10
2
1000 = 10
3
The number of zeros tells us the number for the exponent. To write a num-
ber in scientific notation, we want the first number to be greater than or equal
to 1 and less than 10, and the second number to be a power of 10.
Let's see how this can be done. Consider the following.
67()0 =
6.7

Now that we have seen some examples of numbers in scientific nota-
tion, let us think through the steps in the next example.
It is important to remember that all numbers greater than 10 always have
a positive exponent when expressed in scientific notation.

When changing to scientific notation, all zeros to the right of the final
nonzero digit may be eliminated. This does not change the value of your
answer.
Now we will look at numbers that are less than
1. In the introduction to
this section we saw that 0.000002 can be written as 2 x
10~6
. How is it possi-
ble to have a negative exponent? Let's take another look at the powers of 10.
L0

Recall that any number to the zero power
is

Now, following this pattern, what would you expect the next number on the
left of the equal sign to be? What would be the next number on the right of
the equal sign? Each number on the right
is one-tenth the number above
it.
We continue the pattern.

Thus you can see how
it
is possible to have negative exponents. We use neg-
ative exponents to write numbers that are less than
1
in scientific notation.

Chapter 9
Signed Numbers
Let's look at 0.76. This number is less than
1. Recall that in our defini-
tion for scientific notation the first number must be greater than or equal to
1 and less than 10. To change 0.76 to such a number, we will have to move the
decimal point.
0.76 = 7.6 X 10"
1
The decimal point moves 1 place to the right. We therefore put a -1 for the
power of 10. We use a negative exponent because the original number is less
than
1. Let's look at two more cases.
0.0025 = 2.5 x 10"3
0.00088 = 8.8 X
10'
These numbers are
in scientific notation.
When we start with a number that is less than 1 and write it in scientif-
ic notation, we will get a result with 10 to a negative power. Think carefully
through the steps of the following example.
^* EXAMPLE 2

Section 9.5
Scientific Notation
591
It
is very
helpful when
writing numbers
in
scientific
notation
to
remember these two concepts.
1. A number that is larger than 10 and written in scientific notation will
always have a positive exponent as the power of 10.
2. A number that is smaller than
1 and written in scientific notation will
always have a negative exponent as the power of 10.
^E^
Changing Numbers in Scientific Notation to Standard Notation
Often we are given a number in scientific notation and want to write
it in
standard notation—that
is, we want to write it in what we consider "ordinary
form." To do this, we reverse the process we've just used. If the number in
scientific notation has a positive power of 10, we know the number is greater
than 10. Therefore, we move the decimal point to the right to convert to stan-
dard notation.
^ EXAMPLE 3

If the number in scientific notation has a negative power of 10, we know
the number is less than

. Therefore, we move the decimal point to the left to
convert to standard notation. In some cases, we need to add zeros as we move
the decimal point to the left.

^E^ Adding and Subtracting Numbers in Scientific Notation
Scientists calculate with numbers in scientific notation when they study galax-
ies (the huge) and when they study microbes (the tiny). To add or subtract
numbers in scientific notation, the numbers must have the same power of 10.
Numbers in scientific notation may be added or subtracted if they have
the same power of 10. We add or subtract the decimal part and leave the
power of 10 unchanged.
• EXAMPLE 6
Add.
5.89 X 10~20 meters + 3.04 x 10~20 meters

Putting Your Skills to Work
Using Cat Litter to Clean Up Nuclear Waste
The West Valley nuclear power plant in New York
was closed in 1972 after only six years of operation.
The site of the nuclear power plant is contaminated.
Over 30 million curies of radioactive strontium 90
remain at the site. (For comparison, the accident at
the Three Mile Island nuclear plant released about
50 curies into the air.) About one-third of this ra-
dioactive waste
is contained
in
a 700-foot-long
amoeba-shaped underground plume of water. This
slow-moving underground stream of radioactive liq-
uid is flowing downhill from the old nuclear power
plant.
Now it appears that help is available from the use
of zeolite. Zeolite is a compound containing 48 min-
erals and is commonly used as cat litter as well as in
a number of industrial applications. Zeolite contains
clinoptilolite. a substance that can attract and retain
strontium 90. After small tests with this material
were successful at nuclear power sites in Washing-
ton State as well as Chalk River. Ontario. Canada,
scientists began a large scale effort to use zeolite to
combat nuclear contamination at the West Valley
site in New York.
Scientists arc now designing a porous mineral
wall containing zeolite. The wall
will be 30 feet
across and 26 feet deep. It will act as a giant molec-
ular sieve, letting water flow downhill but captur-
ing any radioactive strontium 90 molecules.
Problems for Individual Investigation and Analysis

euries per liter of water that passes through
it. How
many feet thick would the wall need to be to absorb
1 x
10~4 curies per liter?
2. Again, assume that the wall
is three feet thick and
absorbs
1 x 10" curies per liter of w ater. If an area
of the wall measuring
1 toot by
1 foot can filter one
liter of w ater each minute, how many liters of water
could be filtered each minute through the entire w all
measuring 30 feet across and 26 feet deep?

and Cooperative Problem Solving
3. Suppose a
1 -foot-by- 1 -foot section of a 3-foot-thick
wall
filters
1 x
10~6 curies per liter of water per
minute. How many
liters
of water would
pass
through this section of wall in one year? How many
curies of strontium 90 would be filtered out in one
year by this
1 -foot-by- 1 -foot section?
4. Using the answer from question
3. determine how
many curies of strontium 90 w ould be filtered out in
five years by the entire wall measuring 30 feet across
and 26 feet deep? How much would the entire wall
filter out in five years if the wall were 300 feet thick
instead of 3 feet thick?

Wind
Chill: A Rough Guide to Danger
i4
USA TODAY, February 08, 2000
Copyright 2000. USA TODAY. Reprinted
with permission.
"As temperatures fall and the wind
howls, we begin hearing about the
danger of "wind chill/ The wind chill
index, shown below, combines the
temperature and wind speed to tell
you how cold the wind makes it 'feel'
Even though the chill is given as a
temperature, it's not really a differ-
ent kind of temperature, it's based on
polar research going back
to the
early 1940s and
is meant to be
a
guide to how much you should bun-
dle up when going outside."
In the table below the wind chill for
a wind speed of 10 miles/hour and
20 degrees Fahrenheit
is
the
cell
which
is the
intersect of the row
containing
10
miles/hour
and
the column containing 20 degrees
Fahrenheit which
is 3 degrees. All
other wind chill factor are intersec-
tions of a row and a column.

3.
Simplify the fraction.
Perform the operations in the proper order.
7(-4) - (-2)
8 - (-5)
The numerator is
7(-4) - (-2) = -28 - (-2) = -26.
The denominator is

Writing a number in
scientific notation,
p. 588.
1. Move the decimal point to the position
immediately to the right of the first
nonzero digit.
2. Count the number of decimal places you
moved the decimal point.
3.
Multiply the result by a power of 10
equal to the number of places moved. If
the number you started with
is larger
than 10, use a positive exponent. If the
number you started with is less than 1,
use a negative exponent.

^^ Recognizing the Variable in an Equation or a Formula
In algebra we reason and solve problems by means of symbols. A variable is
a symbol, usually a letter of the alphabet, that stands for a number. We can use
the variable even though we may not know what number the variable stands

We begin by taking a closer look at variables. In the formula for the area
of a circle, the equation A =

of the radius. A represents the value of the area, rr is a known value. We often

We have seen various ways to write multiplication. For example, three
times n can be written as 3 x
n. In algebra we usually do not write the mul-
tiplication symbol. We can simply write 3n to mean three times n. A number
just to the left of a variable indicates that the number is multiplied by the
variable. Thus 4ab means 4 times a times b.
A number just to the left of a set of parentheses also means multiplica-
tion. Thus 3(ai + 8) means 3 x
(n +
8). So a product can be written with or
without a multiplication sign.

Variables and Like Terms

Combining Like Terms Containing a Variable
Recall that when we work with measurements we combine like quantities. A
carpenter, for example, might perform the following calculations.
20 m - 3 m =
17 m
7 in. + 9 in. =
16 in.
We cannot combine
quantities
that
are not the same. We cannot add
5 yd + 7 gal. We cannot subtract 12 lb - 3 in.
Similarly, when using variables, we can add or subtract only when the
same variable is used. For example, we can add 4a + 5a - 9a, but we cannot
add 4a + 5b.
A term
is a number, a variable, or a product of a number and one or
more variables separated from other terms in an expression by a + sign or a
- sign. In the expression 2x + 4y + (-1) there are three terms: 2x, 4y. and
-1. Like terms have identical variables and identical exponents, so in the ex-
pression 3x + 4y + (— 2jc), the two terms 3jc and (—2x) are called like terms.
The terms 2jc
2y and 5xy are not like terms, since the exponents for the vari-
able x are not the same. To combine like terms, you combine the numbers,
called the numerical coefficients, that are directly in front of the terms by
using the rules for adding signed numbers. Then you use this new number as
the coefficient of the variable.
• EXAMPLE 3
Add. 5x + lx
We add 5 + 7 =
12. Thus 5jc + lx =
12*.
Practice Problem 3
Add. 9x + 2x
•
When we combine signed numbers, we try to combine them mentally.
Thus to combine 7 -
9. we think 7 + (-9) and we write -2. In a similar way.
to combine lx - 9x, we think
i lx + {—9x)
\ and we write —2x. Your instructor
may ask you to write out this "think" step as part of your work. In the fol-
lowing example we show this extra step inside a
i
i box. You should de-
termine from your instructor whether he or she feels this step is necessary.

The Distributive Property
Removing Parentheses Using the Distributive Property
What do we mean by the word property in mathematics? A property
is an
essential characteristic. A property of addition is an essential characteristic of
addition. In this section we learn about the distributive property and how to
use this property to simplify expressions.
Sometimes we encounter expressions like 4(.r + 3). We'd like to be able
to simplify the expression so that no parentheses appear. Notice that this
expression contains two operations, multiplication and addition. We will use
the distributive property to distribute the 4 to both terms in the addition state-
ment. That
is.
4(.y + 3)
is equal to
4(x) + 4(3).
The numerical coefficient 4 can be "distributed over" the expression .v + 3 by
multiplying the 4 by each of the terms in the parentheses. The expression
4(.r) + 4(3) can be simplified to 4.v +
12, which has no parentheses. Thus we
can use the distributive property to remove the parentheses.
Using variables, we can write the distributive property two ways.
Distributive Properties of Multiplication over Addition
If a, b, and c are signed numbers, then
a(b + c) = ab + ac
and
(b + c)a — ba +
ca.

A numerical example shows that the distributive property works.
(7)(4 + 6) = (7)(4) + (7)(6)
(7)(10) = 28 + 42
70 = 70
When the number is to the left of the parentheses, we use
a(b + c) - ab +
ac.
There is also a distributive property of multiplication over subtraction:
a(b — c) = ab —
ac.

Solving Equations Using the Addition Property
Solving Equations Using the Addition Property
One of the most important skills in algebra
is that of solving an equation.
Starting from an equation with a variable whose value
is unknown, we trans-
form the equation into a simpler, equivalent equation by choosing a logical
step. In the following sections we'll learn some of the logical steps for solving
an equation successfully.
We begin with the concept of an equation. An equation
is a mathemat-
ical statement that says that two expressions are equal. The statement
,v + 5 =
13 means that some number (.v) plus 5 equals
13. Experience with
the basic addition facts tells us that x = 8 since 8 + 5 =
13. Therefore, 8 is the
solution to the equation. The solution of an equation
is that number which
makes the equation true. What
if we did not know that 8 + 5 =
13? How
could we find the value of .v? Let's look at the first logical step in solving this
equation.
The important thing to remember is that an equation
is like a balance
scale. Whatever you do to one side of the equation, you must do to the other
side of the equation to maintain the balance. Our goal is to do this in such a
way that we isolate the variable.

x = 8
We found the solution to the equation.
Notice that in the second step, the number 5 was removed from the left
side of the equation. We know that we may add a number to both sides of the
equation. But what number should we choose to add? We always add the op-
posite of the number we want to remove from one side oi the equation.

equations.

Sometimes you will need to use the addition property twice. If variables
and numbers appear on both sides of the equation, you will want to get all of
the variables on one side of the equation and all of the numbers on the other

Add -7 to both sides of the equation.

Add -x to both sides of the equation.

We would certainly want to check this solution. Solving the equation
took several steps and we might have made a mistake along the way. To check,
we substitute 2 for x in the original equation.

Solving Equations Using the Division Property
Recall that when we solve an equation using the addition property, we trans-
form the equation to a simpler one where x = some number. We use the same
idea to solve the equation 3/7 = 75. Think: "What can we do to the left side
of the equation so that n stands alone?" If we divide the left side of the equa-
tion by 3, n will stand alone. Remember, however, whatever you do to one
side of the equation, you must do to the other side of the equation. Our goal
once again is to isolate the variable.
3/i = 75
3/2 _ 75

n = 25
This is another important procedure used to solve equations.
Division Property of Equations
You may divide each side of an equation by the same nonzero number
to obtain an equivalent equation.

Solving Equations Using Two Properties
Using Two Properties to Solve an Equation
To solve an equation, we take logical steps to change the equation to a simpler
equivalent equation. The simpler equivalent equation
is x - some number.
To do this, we use the addition property, the division property, or the multi-
plication property. In this section you will use more than one property to solve
complex equations. Each time you use a property, you take a step toward
solving the equation. At each step you try to isolate the variable. That
is. you

Sometimes variables appear on both sides of the equation. When this occurs,
we need to isolate the variable. This requires us to add a variable term to each
side of the equation.
• EXAMPLE 3
Solve. 8x =

We want to remove the 5x from the right-hand side of the equation so
that all of the variables are on one side of the equation and all of the numbers
are on the other side of the equation.

Translating English into Mathematical Equations
Using Two Given Variables
In the preceding section you learned how to solve an equation. We can use
equations to solve applied problems, but before we can do that, we need to
know how to write an equation that will represent the situation in a word
problem.
In this section we practice translating to help you to write your own
mathematical equations. That
is, we
translate English expressions into
algebraic expressions. In the next section we'll apply this translation skill to
a variety of word problems.
The following chart presents the mathematical symbols generally used
in translating English phrases into equations.

An English sentence describing the relationship between two 01 more
quantities can often be translated into a short equation using variables. For
example, if we say in English "Bob's salary is $1(MK) greater than Fred's salary"
we can express the mathematical relationship by the equation
b =
1000 + /
where b represents Bob's salary and /represents Fred's salary.
• EXAMPLE
1
Translate the English sentence into an equation using
variables. Use r to represent Roberto's weight and; to represent Juan's weight.
Roberto's weight
is 42 pounds more than Juan"s weight.
Roberto's weight
is
42 pounds
more than
Juan's weight.
r
=
42
/
The equation r = 42 +
;' could also be written as
r = j + 42.
Both are correct translations because addition is commutative.
Practice Problem
1
Translate the English sentence into an equation using
variables. Use
t to represent Tom's height and a to represent Abdul's height.
Tom's height is 7 inches more than Abdul's height.
^^
When translating the phrase "less than" or "fewer than." be sure that
the number that appears before the phrase
is the value that
is subtracted.
Words like "costs." "weighs." or "has the value of are translated into an equal
sign( = ).
^* EXAMPLE 2
Translate the English sentence into an equation using
variables. Use c to represent the cost of the chair in dollars and s to represent
the cost of the sofa in dollars.
The chair costs $200 less than the sofa.
The chair costs $ 200 less than the sofa.

Note the order of the equation. We subtract 200 from
v. so we have s - 200.
It would be incorrect to write 200 -
s. Do you see why?
Practice Problem 2
Translate the English sentence into an equation using
variables. Use n to represent the number of students in the noon class and m
to represent the number of students in the morning class.
The noon class has 24 fewer students than the morning class.
^
In a similar way we can translate the phrases "more than" or "greater
than." but since addition
is commutative, we
find
it easier
to write
the
mathematical symbols in the same order as the words m the English sentence.

Writing Algebraic Expressions for Several Quantities
Using One Given Variable
In each of the examples so far we have used two different variables. Now we "11
learn how to write algebraic expressions for several quantities using the same
variable. In the next section we'll use this skill to write and solve equations.
A mathematical expression that contains a variable
is often called an
algebraic expression.
^* EXAMPLE 4
Write algebraic expressions for Bob's salary and Fred's
salary. Fred's salary is $150 more than Bob's salary. Use the letter b.
Let
b = Bob's salary.
Let b + 150 = Fred's salary.
$150 more than Bob's salary
Notice that Fred's salary
is described in terms of Bob's salary. Thus
it
is
logical to let Bob's salary be b and then to express Fred's salary as $150 more
than Bob's.
Practice Problem 4

angle B. Angle A is 105° larger than angle B. Find the measure of each angle.
Check your answer.
Let x — the number of degrees in angle B.
Let 3x = the number of degrees in angle C.
Let x + 105 = the number of degrees in angle A.
The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is 180°. Thus we can write the
following.
x + 3x + (x + 105) - 180
5x + 105 = 180
5x + 105 + (-105) = 180 + (-105)
5x = 75
5x _ 75

x = 15
Angle B measures 15°.
Angle C measures 45°.
Angle A measures 120°.
3x - (3)(15) = 45
x + 105 = 15 + 105 = 120
Check.
Do the angles total 180°?
15 + 45 + 120 = 180

Solving Problems Involving Rates and Percents
You can use equations to solve problems that involve rates and percents.
Recall that the commission a salesperson earns is based on the total sales
made. For example, a saleswoman earns $40 if she gets a 49( commission and
she sells $1000 worth of products. That
is, 4% of $1000 = $40. Sometimes a
salesperson earns a base salary. The commission will then be added to the
base salary to determine the total salary. You can find the total salary if you
know the amount of the sales. How would you find the amount of sales if the
salary were known? We will use an equation.
^ EXAMPLE 6
This month's salary for an encyclopedia saleswoman was
$3000. This includes her base monthly salary of $1800 plus a 59c commission
on total sales. Find the total sales for the month.

Does 57c of $24,000 added to $1800 yield a salary of $3000?
(0.05)(24,000) + 1800 = 3000
1200 + 1800 = 3000
3000 = 3000

'"With gas prices topping $1.50 a gal-
lon in many areas, it's tough to

are tax deductible. But you can't take
full credit for the miles you spend in
traffic unless you keep good records.
And
depending on
your
circum-
stances, your might want to rethink
the way you deduct your driving
costs.
The IRS offers two options for de-
ducting expenses for business use of
an automobile:
• Actual expenses. This method
lets you claim
all the expenses
associated with operating a car
for business, such as gas. mainte-
nance, and depreciation. If you
use your car for business and
non-business purposes, you can
only deduct part of those costs.
• The standard mileage allowance.
Here, you simply deduct a spe-
cific amount for every business-
related mile you drove during
the year. The mileage allowance
for 2000 is 32.5 cents a mile. So. if
you drove 5.000 miles for busi-
ness
in
2000, you can deduct
$1625 when figuring your taxes."

Basic College Mathematics Glossary
Absolute value of a number (9.1) The absolute
value of a number
is the distance between that
number and zero on the number
line. When we
find the absolute value of a number, we use the
|
notation. To illustrate,
|-4| =
4,
|6| =
6, |-20 -
3|
= |-23| = 23,
|0| =
0.
Addends (1.2) When two or more numbers are
added, the numbers being added are called addends.
In the problem 3 + 4 =
7, the numbers 3 and 4
are both addends.
Algebraic
expression
(10.6) An
algebraic
expression consists of variables, numerals, and
operation signs.
Altitude of a triangle (7.4) The height of a triangle.
Amount of a percent equation (5.3A) The product
we obtain when we multiply a percent times a
number.
In
the equation
75 = 50% X
150,
the
amount is 75.
Angle (7.1) An angle is formed whenever two lines
meet.
Area (7.1) The measure of the surface inside a
geometric figure. Area is measured in square units,
such as square feet.
Associative property of addition (1.2) The property
that tells us that when three numbers are added, it
does not matter which two numbers are added
first. An example of the associative property
is
5 + (1 + 2) = (5 + 1) + 2.
Whether
we
add
1 + 2
first and then add 5 to that, or add 5 +
1
first and then add that result to 2, we will obtain
the same result.
Associative property of multiplication
(1.4) The
property that tells us that when we multiply three
numbers,
it does not matter which two numbers
we group together first to multiply; the result will
be the same. An example of the associative property
of multiplication
is 2 x
(5 x 3) =
(2 X 5) x
3.
Base
(1.6) The number that
is to be repeatedly
multiplied
in exponent
form. When we
write
16 = 2
4
, the number 2
is the base.
Base of a percent equation (5.3A) The quantity
we
take
a
percent
of.
In
the
equation
80 = 20% X 400, the base
is 400.
Billion (1.1) The number 1.000,000.000.
Borrowing (1.3) The renaming of a number in order
to facilitate subtraction. When we subtract 42 — 28,
we rename 42 as 3 tens plus
12. This represents 3
tens and 12 ones. This renaming is called borrowing.
Box (7.8) A three-dimensional object whose every
side
is a rectangle. Another name for a box
is a
rectangular solid.
Building fraction property (2.6) For whole numbers
a, b, and c, where neither b nor c equals zero.
a

Building up a fraction (2.6) To make one fraction
into
an
equivalent
fraction
by
making
the
denominator and numerator larger numbers. For
example, the fraction \ can be built up to the fraction
30
40-
Caret (3.5) A symbol
A used to indicate the new
location
of
a decimal
point when performing
division of decimal fractions.
Celsius temperature (6.4) A temperature scale in
which water boils at 100 degrees (100°C) and freezes
at
degrees (0°C).To convert Celsius temperature
to
Fahrenheit,
we
use
the
helpful
formula
F =
1.8 X C + 32.
Center of a circle (7.7) The point in the middle of
a circle from which all points on the circle are an
equal distance.
Centimeter (6.2) A unit of length commonly used
in the metric system to measure small distances.
1 centimeter = 0.01 meter.
Circle (7.7) A figure for which all points are at an
equal distance from a given point.
Circumference of a circle (7.7) The distance around
the rim of a circle.
Commission
(5.5) The
amount
of
money
a
salesperson is paid that is a percentage of the value
of
the
sales
made
by
that
salesperson. The
commission
is
obtained
by
multiplying
the
commission rate times the value of the sales.
If a
salesman
sells
$120,000
of
insurance
and
his
commission
rate
is 0.5%, then
his commission
is
0.59? x
120,000 = $600.00

Basic College Mathematics Glossary
Common denominator (2.7) Two fractions have a
common denominator if the same number appears
in the denominator of each fraction. 7 and 7 have
a common denominator of 7.
Commutative
property
of
addition
(1.2) The
property that tells us that the order in which two
numbers are added does not change the sum. An
example of the commutative property of addition
is 3 + 6 = 6 +
3.
Commutative property of multiplication (1.4) The
property that tells us that the order in which two
numbers are multiplied does not change the value
of the answer. An example of the commutative
property of multiplication is 7 X 3 = 3 X
7.
Composite number (2.2) A composite number
is
a whole number greater than 1 that can be divided
by whole numbers other than itself. The number 6
is a composite number since it can be divided exactly
by 2 and 3 (as well as by 1 and 6).
Cone (7.8) A three-dimensional object shaped like
an ice-cream cone or the sharpened end of a pencil.
Cross-multiplying (4.3)
If you have a proportion
n
12
such as — = —
, then to cross-multiply, you form
products to obtain n X 15 = 5 X
12.
Cubic centimeter (6.3) A metric measurement of
volume equal to 1 milliliter.
Cup (6.1) One of the smallest units of volume in
the American system. 2 cups =
1 pint.
Cylinder (7.8) A three-dimensional object shaped
like a tin can.
Debit (1.2) A debit in banking is the removing of
money from an account. If you had a savings account
and took $300 out of it on Wednesday, we would
say that you had a debit of $300 from your account.
Often a bank will add a service charge to your
account and use the word debit to mean that it has
removed money from your account to cover the
charge.
Decimal
fraction
(3.1) A
fraction
whose
denominator is a power of 10.
Decimal places (3.4) The number of digits to the
right of the decimal point
in
a decimal fraction.
The number 1.234 has three decimal places, while
the number 0.129845 has six decimal places. A whole
number such
as 42
is considered to have zero
decimal places.
Decimal point (3.1) The period^ that
is used when
writing a decimal
fraction. In the number 5.346,
the period between the 5 and the 3
is the decimal
point.
It separates the whole number from the
fractional part that is less than
1.
Decimal system (1.1) Our number system is called
the decimal system or base 10 system because the
value of numbers written in our system is based on

Appendix B
Scientific Calculators
This text does not require the use of a calculator. However, you may want to
consider the purchase of an inexpensive scientific calculator. It is wise to ask
your instructor for advice before you purchase any calculator for this course.
It should be stressed that students are asked to avoid using a calculator for any
of the exercises in which the calculations can be readily done by hand. The only
problems in the text that really demand the use of a scientific calculator are
marked with the
v~
symbol. Dependence on the use of the
scientific
calculator for regular exercises in the text will only hurt the student in the
long run.
The Two Types of Logic Used in Scientific Calculators
Two major types of scientific calculators are popular today. The most com-
mon type employs a type of logic known as algebraic logic. The calculators
manufactured by Casio, Sharp, and Texas Instruments as well as many other
companies employ this type of logic. An example of calculation on such a cal-
culator would be the following. To add 14 + 26 on an algebraic logic calcu-
lator, the sequence of buttons would be:
14Q26E]
The second type of scientific calculator requires the entry of data in
Reverse Polish Notation (RPN). Calculators manufactured by Hewlett-
Packard and a few other specialized calculators use RPN. To add 14 + 26 on
an RPN calculator, the sequence of buttons would be:
14
1
enter
| 26 \T]
Graphing scientific calculators such as the TI-82 and TI-83 have a large
liquid display for viewing graphs. To perform the calculation on most graph-
ing calculators, the sequence of buttons would be:
14 [T] 26
|
enter
Mathematicians and scientists do not agree on which type of scientific
calculator is superior. However, the clear majority of college students own
calculators that employ algebraic logic. Therefore this section of the text
is
explained with reference to the sequence of steps employed by an algebraic
logic calculator. If you already own or intend to purchase a scientific calcu-
lator that uses RPN or a graphing calculator, you arc encouraged to study
the instruction booklet that comes with the calculator and practice the prob-
lems shown in the booklet. After tins practice you will be able to solve the cal-
culator problems discussed in this section.
Performing Simple Calculations
The following example will illustrate the use of the scientific calculator
in
doing basic arithmetic calculations.

Combined Operations
You must use extra caution concerning the order of mathematical operations
when you are doing a problem on the calculator that involves two or more dif-
ferent operations.
Any scientific calculator with algebraic logic uses a priority system that
has a clearly defined order of operations. It
is the same order we use in per-
forming arithmetic operations by hand. In either situation, calculations are
performed in the following order:
1. First calculations within parentheses are completed.
2. Then numbers are raised to a power or a square root is calculated.
3. Then multiplication and division operations are performed from left
to right.
4. Then addition and subtraction operations are performed from left to
right.
This order is carefully followed on scientific calculators and graphing
calculators. Small inexpensive calculators that do not have scientific functions
often do not follow this order of operations.
The number of digits displayed in the answer varies from calculator to
calculator. In the following examples, your calculator may display more or
fewer digits than the answer we have listed.
• EXAMPLE 7
Evaluate.
5.3 X
1.62 +
1.78 + 3.51
This problem requires that we multiply 5.3 by 1.62 and divide 1.78 by
3.51
first and then add the two results. If the numbers are entered directly
into the calculator exactly as the problem
is written, the calculator will per-
form the calculations in the correct order.

The Use of Parentheses
In order to perform some calculations on the calculator the use of parenthe-
ses
is helpful. These parentheses may or may not appear in the original
problem.
• EXAMPLE 8
Evaluate.
5 x
(2.123 + 5.786 -
12.063)
The problem requires that the numbers in the parentheses be combined
first. By entering the parentheses on the calculator this will be accomplished.

Raising a Number to a Power
All scientific calculators have a key for finding powers of numbers. It is usually
labeled \y
x
\
. (On a few calculators the notation is
\~x[\ or sometimes
[_ ~J.)
To raise a number to a power on most scientific calculators, first you enter
the base, then push the [7] key. Then you enter the exponent, then finally
the [~£] button.

1. The bar rises to 24. The approximate population was 24.000.000.
2. 16.000,000 - 7.000.000 = 9,000,000. The
population
increased
by 9.000.000.
3. The bar rises to 250. The number of new cars sold in the fourth
quarter of 2001 was 250.
4.
150 - 100 = 50. Thus. 50 fewer cars were sold.
5. The greatest number of customers came in July, since the highest
point of the graph occurs in July.
6.
(a)
3500
(b) The number decreased.
7. The sharpest line of decrease is from July to August. The line slopes
downward most steeply between those two months. Thus the
biggest decrease in customers is between July and August.
8. Because the dot corresponding to 1999-2000 is at 15 and the scale
is in hundreds, we have 15 X 100 =
1500. Thus, 1500 degrees in vi-
sual and performing arts were awarded.
9. The computer science line goes above the visual and performing
arts line first in 1997-1 998. Thus the first academic year with more
degrees in computer science was 1997-1998.

1. The 60-69 bar rises to a height of 6. Thus six tests would have a D
grade.
2. From the histogram.
1 6 tests were 70-79. 8 tests were 80-89, and 6
tests were 90-99. When we combine 16 - 8 + 6 = 30. we can see-
that 30 students scored greater than 69 on the test.
3. The 800-999 bar rises to a height of 20. Thus 20 light bulbs lasted
between 800 and 999 hours.
4. From the histogram. 25 bulbs lasted 1200-1399 hours. 10 lasted
1400-1599 hours, and 5 lasted 1600-1799 hours. When we combine
25 +
10 + 5 = 40. we can see that 40 light bulbs lasted more than
1199 hours.

55. The step of dividing the numerator and denominator by the same number allows us to work with smaller numbers when we do the multiplica-
tion. Also, this allows us to avoid the step of having to simplify the fraction in the answer.
56. There are an infinite number of answers. Any frac-
tion that can be simplified to | would be a correct answer. Thus three possible answers to this problem are ^
, ^
, or %
57. 529 cars
58. 368 calls
59. 1752 lines
60. 173,040 gallons

Exercises
1. Think
of
a
simple
problem
like
3 * \. One way
to
think
of
it
is how many
|'s
can
be
placed
in
3?
For example, how many
^-pound rocks could be put in a bag that holds 3 pounds of rocks? The answer is 6. If we inverted the first fraction by mistake, we would have
\y-\ =
\- We know this
is wrong since there are obviously several j-pound rocks in a bag that holds 3 pounds of rocks. The answer \ would make
no sense.
2. One way to think of it is to imagine how many ^-pound rocks could be put in a bag that holds 2 pounds of rocks and then imagine
how many ^-pound rocks could be put in the same bag. The number of ^-pound rocks would be larger. Therefore 2 *
\ is a larger number.

1. We know that each mile is 5280 feet. Each foot is 12 inches. So we know that one mile is 5280 x
12 = 63.360 inches. The unit fraction we want is
63.360 inches
63.360 inches
. So we multiply 23 miles x
.The mile unit divides out. We obtain 1.457.280 inches. Thus 23 miles = 1,457280 inches.

l.The median of a set of numbers when they are arranged in order from smallest to largest is that value that has the same number of values above
it as below
it. The mean of a set of values is the sum of the values div ided by the number of values. The mean
is most likely to be not typical of the
values you would expect if there are many extremely low values or many extremely high values. The median is more likely to be typical of the value
you would expect.

51. The sharp drop in the number of ice cream cones purchased from July 2000 to August 2000 is probably directly related to the weather. Since Au-
gust was cold and rainy significantly fewer people wanted ice cream during August.
52. The sharp increase in the number of ice cream cones pur-
chased from June 2001 to July 2001
is probably directly related to the weather. Since June was cold and rainy and July was warm and sunny,
