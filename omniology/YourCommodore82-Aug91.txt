Just as Haggar (the ex-Streefﬁghter not
the cartoon Viking) had put his socks and
shoes on for once and settled down to a
quiet and boring life of being Mayor of the
city, his daughter goes and gets
kidnapped by none other than the Mad
Gear Gang - how inconsiderate of her!
Yep, Final Fight is the sequel to
Capcom's Streetﬁghter and U S Gold are
sure you are going to get all your kicks
(arf, art) out of this conversion.
You play Haggar or his sidekicks, Cody
or Guy, and come face-to-face, or foot-to-

meanest punks imaginable.

RUBICON AND
ON AND ON
Remember Hewson? Well they're back, under
the new name of 21st Century Entertainment - and what better to shoot off with than a
shoot-em-up called Rubicon (not to be confused with a
can of passion fruit drink or an old game from
Quicksilva)?
It's set in the year 2011 after a nuclear explosion in a
Soviet Powerplant and surprisingly enough there's not
much left apart from mutations! (Glowing sheep, etc.)
Basically, you've got disarm the mutations, clear up
the mess and make the planet inhabitable again. I think
youre gonna need more than the weaponry given to you
in the game, I'd just telephone God, that's if you can
afford the phone bill by the year 2011!
O N E D  O U T,
M A N !
A Robozone is not one of those
street corners with a black spot
where you can phone other robots,
it's actually the latest shoot-em-up
of the sideways scrolling kind t o
come from the lmageworks label.
It's set in the 21st Century
where cities are so polluted that no
human can survive (should have
been London 1991)!
A bunch of robots calling
themselves The Wolverine are
brought in to protect the city, until
a load of evil black stick-like robots
called Pollutants arrived and
wrecked the cities, scavenged all
the metal they could ﬁnd then built
huge furnaces to smelt the lot. Ah
well, it all goes to make a good
game! You play the only Wolverine
left in New York and must stop the
Pollutants over-running the City.
It has 3 huge levels and is being
marketed as '1991's ultimate
shoot-em-up', so ﬁre buttons at the
ready!

Domark are certainly showing us that
they're good sports with their latest two
signings.
Grandstand is a 'mix-em-up' of all your
fave type of sports (unfortunately
tiddlywinks and kiss chase are not
included) so you can play from the privacy
of your own living room without mud,
sweat and running round only to make
yourself wheeze,
The football game is none other than
Gazza (the Empire version not the one-
legged simulator). The driving part is
provided by Continental Circus and the
tennis by Pro Tennis Tour and to 'round'
T H A T ' S
G R A N D ,  L A D S
off how about a game of golf with none
other than World Class Leaderboard,
which is certainly nothing to be tee-ed off
about (aargh E d ).
Meanwhile, to tie in with the 1992
European Football Championships,
Domark have teamed up with Taito to bring
you Euro Football Champ. If you're a fan of
the coin-op you'll know that it's a knock-
out competition played from a grandstand
view with a rather fun feature which allows
you to purposely knee, kick or elbow
another player and get away with it if
you're not spotted by the ref, that is - um,
sounds more like Sunday league!

he's got that

Ocean certainly think that Brucie-babes Willis is a star
not to be laughed at, for they have signed up the latest ﬁlm
he's starring in, namely Hudson Hawk, a Joel Silvers
comedy/musical, which has recently become the second
movie to reach the $100m budget.
We can only hope that Ocean put this much into the
development of the conversion ...only joking!

Gremlin certainly aren't
'board with  the recent
success of 3-D roleplaying
games for they have signed
up 'Space Crusade' - the
second addition to MB's
fantasy stable.
Space Crusade, aimed at
a younger market, was
developed after Heroquest
became MB's fourth best-
seller b e h in d  the likes of
Trivial Pursuit, Pictionary and
Scrabble.
MB put the success down
to the amount of bits and
bobs and ornate artwork you
get for your pounderoonies
compared to the 'expensive
air' found in other
board games.
Certainly not my
cup of tea, - I'm off

Just what is it about pairs of big 'n' bouncy cutesy
wutesys (er characters, that is)? The Mario Bros are
already household names and about to star in their own
ﬁlm, now US Gold have announced the safe arrival of two
new siblings namely The Mega Twins and The Bonanza
Brothers.
Sega's Bonanza Bros are two reformed villains called
Mobo and Hobo who are mysteriously hired to check out
the security at some well known establishments (know
wot I mean!) They're a sort of cross between the Marios
and The Blues Bros as they sniff out the bad apples,
armed with pop guns, and do a spot of nicking
themselves. Watch out for this very funny and rather spiffy
platform/obstacle game in November.
Now meet the Mega Twins, they might be cute, but
they're on a revenge trip from hell, cos as babies they
were the only survivors from a terrible monster that wiped
out their paradise land. The game will convert from the
popular Capcom coin-op when 15 years later The Twins
treck through 6 levels of dazzling arcade action on a quest
to ﬁnd the legendary Dragon Blue Eyes stone which would
set their world in order again. What I want to know is, if
they were the sole survivors who fed and changed their
nappies?

EVERYONE'S A
WINNER (BABY) II
B
YC Ofﬁce Fairy has been
drawing and judging
compos and has brought
everything right up to date.
From now on, we'll be
printing the winners each month
for the compos run in the issue
two months previous, with no
lazy lagging-behind!
So, here are the winners
from February 1991 to May 1991.
And remember, if you've won
(you lucky, lucky, people!) and
you don't get sent your prize
soonish (say, a month from now)
DON'T RING US! Ring the
company who've offered the
prize and worry them instead!
"Kate Adie Calling"
YC February 1991
The chance to win a ﬁrst prize of
a model jeep, model helicopter
and a copy of St. Dragon. Two
second prizes of a jeep and St.
Dragon. And runners-up prizes
of... St. Dragon. All this in return
for a phoney war report, which
we said we'd print if you won.
First Prize: Guy Breakinbury,
South Glamorgan.
His winning entry was a bit
scarily realistic:
"As I stand here in Riga, capital
of Latvia, I can hear the sound of
bombs exploding in the
surrounding countryside. Hand-
to-hand ﬁghting is taking place in
the suburbs; and we know we are
surrounded by Soviet tanks.
This unnecessary war, now in
its second week, started when
Latvia declared complete
independence from the USSR.
Now, a rocket explodes quite
near us, damaging the main
television broadcasting station;
we run for cover to our bunker.
The Latvian people know, of
course, that they cannor hope to
contain the might of the Soviet
military machine. But they ﬁght
on. putting freedom before their
own lives.
As they ﬁre their hopelessly
out-dated riﬂes into the air at
Soviet MIG ﬁghters, the
determination shines on their
faces.
Lavians everywhere appeal to
the great Russian people and
President to put an end to this
conﬂict.
Another explosion, a ﬂock of
wild geese rise into the air and ﬂy
westward - to Freedom."
Second Prize: Michael Jones,
Quinton, Birmingham.
His entry was even more
worrying!
" War has ﬁnally broken out, after
months of speculation, All the
talking is now over and both
sides are taking up arms. With all
the latest technology,
Commanders are calling it the
two-minute war.
Peace and tranquility have
been pushed aside. While Heads
of State contemplate how to
annhilate each other.
There have been massive
casualties on each side, with
hospitals working around the
clock, trying to cope with the
backlog of dead and wounded_
People young and old,
shouting in the streets for peace,
asking God for help_ But their
words go unheard, drowned by
the noise of incoming bombs and
An 
ﬁ
r
e
Water supplies, electricity,
bridges, airports and roads are
the main targets, with around-
the-clock bombardments. At
times, the noise is earth-
shattering. Buildings shake and
crumble with a moment's notice,
civilians are caught underneath
tons of rubble. Rescue missions
are few and far between, people
rooted to the spot because of
fear and bewilderment. It is a
sad, sad sight. One I shall never
forget.
If only the Heads of State
could play war on a computer, it
would be the saviour of so many
screams."
The other Second prize goes to:
No name, Gainsborough.
This was a rather amusing entry:
"And here is the update of the
micro war. Out here, it is
reaching DIZZY heights. We hope
these SANXION will stop soon,
that this is the LAST DUEL.
They are going to send in the
RESISTANCE at MIDNIGHT. but
we can OUTRUN these solduers,
their soldiers are just eating
KWIK SNAX
Out here, there are
CREATURES that BREED at
NIGHT.
The opposition are
PLOTTING to RAMPAGE the
place but we are sending in our
TOP GUN pilots.
At night, our WONDER BOY
soliders are nothing but a
SHADOW of a WARRIOR.
The weather out here is
atrocious, the days are called
DAYS OF THUNDER. There are
also lots of boulders, when one
falls you must DASH from the
BOULDER.
We hope that this war will
end soon, so that AFTER THE
WAR, the year 1943 will be
peaceful again."

Im here I was sitting
I
toadstool when up
pops Jimmy Tortoise with
his little sailor suit on, and
his very neatly trimmed frilly
tu-tu. "Hello", said Jimmy in
his sickeningly cheerful
voice - for it was his
birthday - so I shot him!
Now that's the sort of
fairy story I'd prefer to read
to small children, so when
I'm asked to do a preview of
a cute game I stick my
ﬁngers down a throat
(preferably someone else's)
and treat the whole affair
with a little scepticism.
But when a cutesy game
is as darn spiffy as Rodland
looks to be I'll even get the
bucket to clean up the puke
myself.
The game, you see, is a
bit unique. Okay, it's
JUST WHO ARE THESE STORM
GEEZERS (AND GEEZERESSES)?
Er, a bunch of programmers and programrnesses
who, like, programmed the game! (That's not good
enough! - Ed).
Erm, and they, er, wrote a couple of other games
too, like, er, Swiv and Silkworm, probably! (And
more! - Ed).
0o, they also have exceedingly good parties at
Chrimbo time, and they take you round to the Pizza
place for lunch even if you don't like Pizza so you
have to make do with Chocolate fudge cake (which
is okay, 'cause I quite like choccy fudge cake). And,
believe it or not, they also deny being small fairies
and leprechauns and things, and haven't even seen
A Midsummer Night's Dream. (You're rubbish! -  Ed).
converted from the popular
Jaleco coin-op, but to be
honest it's the way you grab
the monsters and smack
seven shades of rude pooey
stuff out of 'em that gives it
that "Ooo, what a smashing
little splendidness of a
game" appeal.
The style is most
deﬁnitely based around a
platform-gamey type of
thang, you have to clear
each screen the number of
sweet-looking baddies that
roam around.
This you do by using
your rod of Sheesanamo
(look, bear with me, it
doesn't all read like an Ann
Summers catalogue) to zap
them, and whilst in your
grasp you can beat them on
the ﬂoor.
Do this three times and
they will disappear, leaving a
weapon of some
description. You can then
use these to kill the other
baddies and win the game,

There's also other
original factors, like the lack
of a jump ability and a magic
ladder-creating ability
thrown in to replace it (i.e.
you can build a ladder

new one, the old one
vanishes).
There are huge,

METAPLEX
Programmer: Prism
Type: Complete game -
arcade action
Controls: Joystick
The game is set inside an
asteroid, in a huge metal
complex, controlled by a two-
headed monster called Garth.
You must seek and
destroy him, as he intends to
destroy the Earth. To do this
you must shut down four
power control units, to
sufﬁciently weaken him and
bring him to a destructable
level.
After you have done this, a
door will open on the ﬁrst
screen so you can escape.
HOW TO PLAY
To destroy a power unit, you
must drop a ﬂask of acid on
it. First ﬁnd the empty ﬂasks
and ﬁll them by standing
under the drip.
You have levels of laser
power, shield, acid and super
laser status. Various
messages will also appear in
the top left of the control
panel.
There is a rather complex

There are many other

decide which doors need to
be opened and which things
to activate.

MEW
TANKBATTLEZONI
Programmer: Andrew Boxall
Type: Complete game -
arcade action
Controls: Joystick in port 1
and port 2 for two player
game.
It was decided, one day
during World War II, that a
special crack squad should
be sent behind enemy lines
to try and take out a rather
large munitions factory. A
squad was scrambled which
consisted of a tank and
helicopter, it was named the
"battlezone" squad.
They had to travel across
a large, heavily-defended
land, but it was hoped (due to
the smallness of the
squadron), that they could
pass un-noticed.
If they had to destroy
defences, then they could
work well together - being on
ground and in the air.
This seemed like an
impossible task, and if they
ever made it back they would
be hailed as heroes.
It is a dangerous mission
and once again, it's up to
you,
HOW TO PLAY
Two players can play
simultaneously, one
controlling the tank and the
other the helicopter. A
joystick in each port is
needed, although one player
can play with joystick in
either port.
The idea is simple, shoot
all the defences and try to
make as much progress as

possible.
The tank can only drive on
the roads, but the helicopter
can ﬂy anywhere. The screen
scrolls up only, so be careful
in the tank that you don't run
out of road if turning a double
left or right corner.
The action can get pretty
hot. Keep cool and work
together!
Programmer: Darren Cook
Type: Fantasy strategy game
Controls: Keyboard
Monsters is an easy-to-use
fantasy strategy game in
which you can buy, sell and
improve monsters to ﬁght
other monsters and win cash
prizes.
The aim is to take control
over Cybill, the twelfth
monster and earn over 2000
credits so that you can retire.
HOW TO PLAY
The play is straightforward
and instructions are
contained in the program.
Basically, use the function
keys and space bar to select
various options off the
menus. The menus are self
explanatory and easy to
follow.
Try to build up your
monster by improving it. and
buying weapons.

Rampart is the name of the game, and it's not
to be confused with a pretty poo-er effort
released a few years ago called "Ramparts".
The new Tengen machine (one of the
most recent acquisitions for Domark) is a
corking cross between Missile Command
(that old Atari coin-op where you have to
control a track-ball and shoot lines that come
down from the top of the screen) and Tetris
(c'mon, do I really have to explain
THAT game?).
What you have to do is build a
castle wall around your castle base
(the computer does this
automatically at the start) and then
place a number of cannons within
your fortiﬁcation.
you get to do
the same to
them by
controlling a
cursor with a
track-ball
(hence the
Missile Command likeness).
After this time, the
destruction is realised and you have a brief
time to rebuild your wall by using Tetris
style blocks that appear on the screen
(simple, huh?).
If you don't
manage to do so you
lose a life or a credit,
if you do you can
even be adventurous
and attempt to
surround other castle
bases and therefore
give yourself loads
more cannons.
The game is to
be converted pretty
accurately, but we'll
have to wait 'til next
year to see it on the
home computer.
B000l
IN THE
DOMARK
CORNER
Weighing in at around 450lbs
the Domark lads were looking
forward to the sheer
destruction they were to
partake in.
They were all tipped as
the favourites to come out of
it as the victorious team, but
Erol Ziya was their brightest
hopet as the ultimate winner
and Richard Browne was
quite able to beat the best on
his day.
The team (from left to
right): Richard "Killer"
Browne, Erol "Destroyer"
Ziya, James "Pit Bull"
McCormack.

T H E  C O M P E T I T O R S
IN THE YC
CORNER
The YC team knew they were
up against it at the start,
mainly due to the fact that
Jason had never played
Rampart before, Jeff had only
played it for about an hour at
the Arcade trade show and
Rik had come across it when
he was at Domark last.
They were going to get a
right stufﬁng and no mistake.
The team (from left to
right): Jeff "Mincer" Davy, Rik
"Flick-knife" Henderson,
Jason "Bull Fighter" Miller.
ROUND ONE
F E A T U R E
a.
James
McCormack
(Domark) vs. Rik
Henderson (YC)
James was the least
experienced of the
Domark team, and Rik
was the most
experienced of his
side. Even still, he was
crushed to a
humiliating defeat and
the hope now rested
on Jeffrey's shoulders.
T H E
T O U R N A M E N T
The tournament was
structured so it was one
against one for the ﬁrst
rounds (as you can have up
to three players in Rampart
at any one time) and the
three winners would meet
in the ﬁnal, and the three
losers would meet in the
consolation ﬁnal.
The games themselves
would continue until one of
the players had outlasted
his opponent(s) when they
had run out of credits and
must retire from the game.
Also taken into
consideration was the fact
that the YC team were all
likely to be completely
smegged and therefore go
out in the ﬁrst round, if they
were each up against
Domark opposition.
So all the names were
drawn from a hat in order
to give the journalist team
a fairer chance,

1
ts)
R
Jeff Davy (YC) vs.
Jason Miller (YC)
Thanks to a ﬂukey draw
we were guaranteed of
getting one of our own
through to the ﬁnal.
From the start it always
looked like it was going
to be Jeff, and he
cruised to a convincing
win.
THE
CONSOLATION
FINAL
With two of
the magazine
fellows, the plan was
to gang up on the
Domark chappie and
wipe him out of the
game ﬁrst. Needless to say, it failed abysmally and
Richard romped to a convincing win.
First: Richard Browne
Second: Rik Henderson
Third (ie. last): Jason Miller
THE
GRANDE FINALE
James
McCormack vs. Jeff
Davy vs. Erol Ziya
The bookies decided to
close up the shop as soon
as the ﬁnal line-up was
made, and by rights too.
Erol cruised easily to the
ﬁrst YC challenge trophy (er, a plastic cup), although there was a bit of a victory
for the humiliated team for the fact that Jeff managed to knock James into third
place and therefore take second place overall.
First: Erol Ziya
Second: Jeff Davy
Third: James McCormack
Rik
Henderson
vs.
Jason Miller
vs.
Richard
Browne
ROUND THREE
Richard
Browne (Domark)
vs.
Erol Ziya (Domark)
This was tie of the
preliminary rounds,
with both Richard and
Erol being Rampart
masters (what DO
they do in their lunch
breaks?). Erol
managed to win in the
end but only on points
as Richard took him
all the way.
THE
TEAM
RESULT
To ﬁnd out the team result
we decided to award the
winner of the ﬁnal six
points; the runner-up ﬁve
points; etc. And this is
what we came up with:-
DOMARK - 13 points
YC - 8 points
Which goes to shop that
the YC team are quite
convincingly crap, and
Domark are rather
splendid!!!
NEXT ISSUE:
Next time the team come
up against Storm, where
we'll all be utterly
humiliated at such arcade
machines as Double
Dragon Ill, Rodlands,
Indy Heat and a couple of
others! See ya then!!!

5 RAINBOW ARTS
\  1-SHIRTS
These cleverly-designed sheets of
cotton can be placed over the top
half of your body and compliment a
lovely pair of green cords really
well. They also say "Rainbow
Arts" (undoubtedly) and make
you feel good when the sun
comes out. They can be worn on
all occasions, at parties or down
the pub, on the beach, at
weddings and even at work
(We've done this bit before. Ed).
They should be washed at
medium temperature in a coloured
wash, and drip
dried and
stretched back
to original shape
whilst damp,
probably.

be worn pretty much anywhere.

they're more than
welcome to drop me a

SHOT-EM-UP
As a Commodore 64 owner,
I'm used to looking at a game
packaging and seeing Amiga
screenshols. I expect
software houses to show the
best screens of their games,
but feel that they should
specify the format or show
screenshots from each
version (which is what
Krisalis did with Man. Utd.).
I was very angry with US
Gold (although they are not
certainly not the only guilty
party) after buying a copy of
"Italy 1990". On the
packaging some outstanding
screenshots were shown, so I
took them to be Amiga
specimens, but still expected
to see a 3D soccer game on
the 64, even if it wasn't as
good. When I loaded the
game I was astonished to see
an overhead view of the
pitch, and no sign of a
referee or crowd. It looked
like a completely different
game.
Maciej Gondek,
Sydney, Australia
PA: Ooo... Aren't we touchy
, then? What's your problem?
Italy 1990 was a superb
footy game on the C64, and
was a bit naff on the more-
expensive Amiga - so if you
don't stop whining I'll have to
1
1

come round and give you a
good going over.
To be honest the only thing
software publishers should
print on the packaging of all
their games are pictures of
dead bunny rabbits - that'd
stop this cruddy cute-em-up
trend!
BUDGET
PLAN
How are you doing? I'm
doing just ﬁne. I got a C64
for Christmas, so I'm getting
your cool YC mag.
I've got a question for
you though: What are your
three best budget games?
Mine are Last Ninja,
Barbarian 2 and Paperboy.
Jon Sugden,
Northumberland
PS. I think your free tapes
are great!
PA: What'ya mean "How are
you doing?" Doing what?
You're mighty confused, my
good fellow, but I'll put you
straight about budget games.
It really depends on what your
budget is, to determine what a
budget game is.
For instance, with what YC
pays me I could just about
afford a packet of cards,
whereas Jeff (the editor of this
ﬁne magazine) gets he-uge
wages - so the computer
program that concocted the
'Operation Desert Storm' affair
would be his fave budget game
(you should see what his 'full-
price' collection contains).
THE LAND
OF OZ
Just a thank you for your
terriﬁc mag. I buy it each
month, although home in
Australia we are three
months behind.
In your November issue
you offered a free tape and
although I never got that may
'til February I sent for the free
tape never expecting to get it.
But wow, it came in the mail
yesterday!
So, once more, a big, big
thank you for caring about
your readers in Australia.
Jeanette Downie,
&S.W., Australia
PA: Not only do we care about
you antipodean peeps, but we
A GOOD GRILLING
[DA MUil[Fi
I'd like to ask you a few questions:
1) Will there be any wrestling games coming out for the
C64, like Main Event or WWF Superstars?
2) Why don't Nintendo bring out any of their games on other computers? They
would make stacks of dosh if they released 'Mario Bros' or 'Zelda', to name just two.
3) Why don't you put a cover on your tape? Commodore Format and Z*Ap manage
to do it and they only add a measly 25p to their price.
4) Is Last Ninja 3 really as good as you said? You gave It 100%.
Phil "The Master" Morton, Rotherham
PS. Could you print a list of all the teams' highest scores on Barbarian? Mine is
17,500. Is that good?
PPS. Keep up the good work!
PA; I suppose I'd better answer your queries:
1). Yes! Ocean's just announced the forthcoming release of WWF Superstars for the
Commie - see Data for more details. I'd like to know if anybody's ever gonna release a game
about furry creature-hunting!
2). Nintendo wouldn't dare release such a hot product on our computer. Most people buy
a Nintendo so they can play games like Super Mario Bros, so it'd be stupid to sell a game for
ﬁfteen quid when they're theoretically selling it for eighty! Not only that but they really don't
need the dash, they are expecting to have sold over 25 million Gameboys worldwide by the
end of '91. God knows how many of the regular consoles they'll have sold.
3). Why should we expect you to cough up an extra 25p for a cover for the tape when a
ﬂimsy piece of plastic is not worth it. Just think about it, you could buy a Mars bar for that.
What would you think if we stuck a free Mars bar to the cover aswell 'ca u se  in theory that's
what we're doing!
4). Yepl It's the naughty bits that dangle between a dog's legs!
By the way, our highest scores on Barbarian are so crap that you could add them all
together on one hand (if you've got about 10,000 ﬁngers). So your score's quite good really!
watch all your cultural
programmes! Neighbours,
Home and Away and Prisoner of
Cell Block H are truly splendid,
and the acting is as good as any
Shakespearian production (what
do you mean life over there's
not like that?)
YANK 'EM
OFF
I've just read 'YC' for the ﬁrst
time and I have to say, what a
fabulous magazine it is too! It
certainly kicks the others into
touch (whatever that means).
Anyway, as I'm jetting off
to the good old U.S. of A.
soon, I was wondering if you
could advise me if I should
buy any games from there, as
I'm not sure if they'll work
over here? Please help!
Also, could you please tell
me just how long your
reviewers spend playing a
game before they get down
to writing a review? Do they
try to complete the game or
only play the ﬁrst few levels?
I say this because the
marks for 'half life' are not
too accurate for some
games, i.e. Mighty Bombjack
- which got a bit boring after
a few days.
Hussain Choudhury,
Luton
PA: Games sold in the U.S. of A.
are just the same as over here,
but you'll probably have a
problem in ﬁnding a software
shop that sells C64 stuff. The
PC is the popular computer
over there, and absolutely
nobody owns a cassette deck
And the amount of time a
reviewer spends on a game
varies, depending on the
reviewer and how good the
game is. If a game is crap it
might not last too long before
landing in the bin (look at Kenny
Dalglish Soccer Match -
although Rik kept that for
humour value).
Also. Rik has far more
tolerance, and will try to ﬁnish
even the hardest games (even
though he's totally crap at
them), whereas Jeff and Jason
can spot a naff game from miles
away and won't bother too
much if they know everybody's
gonna agree with them.
By the way, Mighty
Bombjack was skill!

It's here at last -  it's the bonatide ﬁnal.
The part of this epic competition that
you've undoubtedly all been waiting
for! It's the end! Six of the most trivia-
minded industry bods clash at last!
(The setting is a bright, glitzy and
ever-so-slightly tasteless TV
studio. Standing at the front of
the stage is a compere, grinning
from ear to ear and wearing a
spangly suit. He begins to
speak...)
Hi viewers, in case you've
forgotten, for the last four
months we've been grilling
various sections of the computer
games industry on their software
trivia knowledge.
In the ﬁrst round it was PR
people, in the second it was
programmers, in the third YC
peeps got a bash and in the
fourth, last month, managing
directors were the target of our
attentions.
So, waiting behind me, there
are four proper ﬁnalists and,
since we need six contestants,
we also have two (almost)
deserving runners-up from
previous rounds to swell the
numbers, or, to make it more
interesting.
Everyone who's taken part
will get a certiﬁcate, whilst the
winner will get, or, an even better
certiﬁcate, with "winner" written
on it in green crayon, and a
plastic cup that says "Computer
Boffo Champion" on it, in
smudged black felt-tip pen.
Remember, this is satellite TV
and our budget is small!
But without further ado,
let's_ meet the contestants!
(Maccive audience cheers)
THE CONTESTANTS:
Danielle Woodyatt (US Gold):
"I don't think I'm going to win!"
says Danielle, US Golds PR
Supremo (responsible for more
blurred celebrations than any
other company), "But if I win I'll
wear something black from my
wardrobe, I'm not going to walk
around with a paper crown on!"
She'd be listening to 'Miranda
Sex Garden', a strange blend of
pop and Medieaval music. Odd,
huh?!
Joe Bonar (Probe):
Mr Bonar works for Probe, the
most completely hatstand
programming house around. "If I
win, Ill indulge a certain amount
of time drinking everything out of
the cup and I shall wear my
prizewinners T-Shirt and some
shoes" he says. And would he
like to work with children?: "I do
like children - but I couldn't eat a
whole one." Er... Thank you, Joe.
Jeff Davy (VC):
The incredibly well-hung (as in
'he should be bally well hung')
editor of this ﬁne organ - "It may
be small, but it's what you do
with it" wo u ld  really, really,
really like to win! If he did, he
would, "go on a holiday to
Australia and surf & sunbathe
with Kylie Minogue", although
we think that Dame Edna
[ (aka "A Clash of the Titans: A M
1
kipper, and a lot less ﬁshy' on
the front". Yep, readers, he
seems to have mislaid his trolley.
Bernard Dugdale (Elite):
Bernard is our MD champ from
the last issue and, having got
over the celebrations from July's
victory says that: "If I win, I'll
have several more pints of
Marsden's Pedigree at my
local." He continues: "I shall don
Everage is more his style. He'd
also listen "to all my Abba
albums", and "wear very loud

declares: "If I beat everyone, I'll

adds: "Have you seen my funny
hayfever tablets?" before
passing out.
Mike Clark (Code Masters):
Mike was a runner-up in the ﬁrst
round but is planning a real
assault this time. He says that if
he wins: "I'd like to sail around
the word and meet lots of
people, especially buyers from
major chain stores so they can
purchase lots of Code Masters
products in order to, er, er, bring
about world peace!" He says
he'll be listening to his "Dougal
and the Blue Cat" record if he's
the champ. We feel we ought to
mention that he has bribed us
with £25 and a Smarties Easter-
egg. Nice man!

terribly by phoning YC on

the answers! So we gave
them the point in question,
and they won!
THE ANSWERS:
1. Way of the Exploding Fist,
International Karate, Last Ninja,
Vie Ar Kung Fu... There's loads
of the damn things! It's one of
the most popular game genres
ever!
2. They all star a character

with any luck, reviewed in the

4. Mel Croucher is a revered
ﬁgure in the computer industry.
He formed a company called
Automata and wrote a classic
game called "Pimania” which
offered a Golden Sundial to the
person who could follow the
clues to where it was REALLY
YES! IT'S THOSE CHEEKY GITS AT PROBE, AGAIN!
You may remember that the last time Probe didn't know a Boffo answer,
they rang Rik and ASKED him! This time, to ﬁnd out the name of our
programmer-on-a-string, a member of Probe rang Paul Crowder, YC's
Sales and Marketing hod, and pretended to be Stuart Dinsey (the editor
of CTW, the computer games world's trade newspaper) to get the
answer. And they would have got away with it too (as they used to say
at the end of 'Scooby Doc', if it hadn't been for those meddling kids - in
this case, Rik and Jeff blew the whistle and Probe didn't ﬁnd out the
answer from us!
They also rang us a day later with their answer to that AND their
answer to the 64 question which they got from CBM themselves!
Cheeky gets! No points!

(an extra half for offering us the smarties egg!! Thanks Mike,
but we just couldn't give you the extra 1 1/2!!)
But the overall Boﬂo Winner is!
Bernard Dugdale (ELITE) 1 4
His prize is on its way!
We salute him, no-one nows as much
computer trivia as he does, he's the new
champion for 1991
buried! He also wrote "Deus Ex
Machina" which was a game
accompanied by a soundtrack
tape full of celebrities which you
played while you went through
the game. He describes himself
as "a balding, genial cult", and
who are we to disagree.
Basically. he's a god, or at least
a minor deity.
5. Domark, natch. Although they
probably won't be doing more.
6. Our reckoning (and this is
also according to Commodore)
is about 14 million. What a lot of
C64's!
7. 'Exclusive Or' is a very dull
programming routine, as
anyone who's ever sat a
Computer Science A-Level will
know. Basically, it's too dull to
go into here, but Mike Clark got
it right!
8. Flimbo's Quest. And we hear
he's working on a sequel at the
moment. This game was
demoKI, you may recall, on a
YC cover tape which you can
still get (see our tape offer
page!)
9. Richard Taylor. He also wrote
this issue's Boffo questions.
What a coincidence that this
question should appear, eh?
10. The Cure. Here at YC we
rather like them (could you have
guessed?)
COMING
SOON!
Computer Boffo is over (for
this year) but look out for
future challenges from VC.
Over the next few months we
plan to take on
programmers, PR Ofﬁcers,
and the like, at things like
Paintballing, Go-Karting and
anything else we can think of,
aswell as going on our now-
regular "VC Humiliation
Tour", where we get soundly
thrashed at the arcade
games that are being
converted by the companies
we challenge. All this and
more in the future_

here adventure. Your good
self has been left to look after
Bridgeton asylum for the day.
Why? I don't know. I also
don't know why you forgot to
lock the door. So everyone's
escaped which means you'll
have to persuade, the
escapees, (Yea, yea - no,
don't laugh - that reminds me
of the story about these three
Irish prostitutes, walking
down the road, yea WALKING
feller, yea I saw you
sniggering in the front row,
yea. Is that your wife mister,
eh, eh? Bit of alright, a bit fat
though, eh, a bit fat, Eh? Eh?
But my mother-in-law...
[sound of crowbar hitting
bone] -  sorry 'bout that, the
Phantom Club Comedian I'm
afraid).
Anyway, the escapees,
there are ten in all, must be
returned to the asylum before
the chaps in charge ﬁnd out.
Bridgeton, produced by
Dorothy Millard, includes the
usual adventuring
commands, including 'speak'
to interact with the
characters in the game, plus
handy abbreviated
commands such as EX or,
simply, X for examining
anything.
The design of Bridgeton is
tighter than Dorothy's earlier
games, it is also much larger
than them, too.
Although rather basic. the
'exam' command doesn't
give you an awful lot of extra
info so, therefore, you lose a
lot of atmosphere, the overall
game is her best effort to
date.
There is nothing "ﬂash"
about Bridgeton, just a
collection of puzzles strung
together by a basic plot.
However, this formula still
results in an enjoyable game.

THE FAMOUS FIVE ON
TREASURE ISLAND
SUPPLIER: ENIGMA
VARIATIONS
PRICE: TAPE - 9.99
"Hurrah!" and "Lashings and
lashings of ginger beer" and
"Hurrah!" again and other
spitting phrases are part and
parcel of Enid Blyton's
Famous Five series.
Oh yes, I remember the
series of books well. I had the
whole series I reckon.
Aye, there was I, a wee
nipper, chickenpox by the
armful, saved by a steady
supply of the jolly adventures
of Julian, Dick, Anne, George
and the blasted dog Timmy.
But let me ask you this,
what on earth was our Enid
thinking about when she
named the kids' Aunt "Fanny"
and their Uncle
" Q u e n t i n
stroll on, luv a duck, I ask
you, etc.
Any road up, this
text/graphic adventure
includes some intriguing
character handling using a
system called Worldscape.
The game begins when
A L I O N f E h I T I J
Julian, Dick and Anne visit
their Aunt and Uncle. This is
the very ﬁrst adventure so
they had yet to meet George,
the tomboy girl and her dog,
Timmy.
From there they worm
their way into treasure island,
full of stereotyped villains and
secret caves. Great fun, in
fact.
The game world is
dynamic, which means that
events move on while you
wait. I'm not a big fan of this
type of wandering character
system; it doesn't present
realism, just an impression of
a game full of aimless manic
zombies.
You can TELL and SAY
things as well as ASKing
them ABOUT things.
Characters have their own
special facets so you can ask
a character to perform an
action you might not be
capable of.
You can also BECOME
any of the Famous Five
(except the dog). Each
character has their own
advantages: Julian is strong
while George is the best
swimmer.
You can even split the ﬁve
up to explore several
directions at once. This is
essential to solve some of the
problems.
The parser is up to
modern standards with linked
sentences using AND, THEN
and commas. Prepositions
can be used to alter the
meaning of verbs and group
commands such as ALL and
EVERYTHING are also
included.
During play, the screen is
divided into two sections.
The upper portion of the
screen contains all
descriptions, messages, and
graphics which pop up for
selected locations. They are
very well drawn and appear
instantly on screen - pretty
good going for graphics of
this complexity.
The lower section is the
text input area.
Highlights and criticisms
fall upon the parser. When
you can't examine
something, the EXAM is
automatically displayed ready
for you to EXAMine
something else; very
thoughtful and user friendly.
But the parser doesn't
understand some basic
words included in the
location descriptions,
although memory restrictions
may be a factor here.
Criticisms apart, this is a
well-produced game, with
lots of imaginative production
techniques. I hope that
Enigma Variations are
working upon a sequel to this
ﬁrst Five instalment because I
am sure it will be enjoyed by
all Commie adventurers.

[Applause; 'Around the World in Eighty Days' music; the fridge is pushed down by a
chap in a brown coat].
This is the fridge in which David kept most of his milk, butter and eggs. What a
typically selﬂess gesture, that he should send his fridge, of all his fridges, to be with his

ROBIN OF SHERWOOD
In the dungeon, stand on the prisoner's shoulders, grab the
guard's ankle then strangle him. In Nottingham Castle, talk
to Marion then go through the window. In Sherwood Forest,
ﬁght Little John then get the quarterstaff, tell him t follow
you. Enter the waterfall to Herne the Hunter's cave and get
what's inside. Just before the archery contest - go to the
outlaw's camp where you hear about the contest. Go to the
location where you can see Nottingham in the distance then
GO TO NOTTINGHAM and enter the contest. When you have
won the silver arrow capture the sheriff. At Castle de
Belleme climb the statue then enter the place of devil
worship where Marion is tied and kill Simon de Belleme then
ask Marion to follow you.
MANIC MANSION
Using Bernard, Ed and Razor. In the family room with the
portrait, typewriter and, erm, man-eating plant. An unsightly
paint-blotch is on the wall. Have Bernard USE PAINT
REMOVER WITH PAINT BLOTCH and a door appears. He
OPENs it. Since it looks dark and there's no light he decides
to wait until later (you should ﬁnd a radio later on, open it
and put the batteries you ﬁnd inside into the ﬂashlight).
VOODOO CASTLE
When holding the chemicals, carry the shield. Mix the
chemicals for height reduction. To travel by the chute wave
the ring. To open the safe, dial 38 and 33.

STEEL GUNNER
STURM - a group of ruthless
international terrorists, didn't
you just know they'd be
some of them in one of these
games? - are out to do all the
things that ruthless
international terrorists are
known for.
Like destabilise
governments, kill people and,
er, amass massive private
armies with plenty of
weaponry just so that you
can come along and have a
good time blasting it all.
And that's just what you
_do, in this latest, version of
'Operation Wolf' and its ilk.
You get the now-familiar view
from down the barrel of a
recoiling gun, mounted on
the machine, of sundry
troops and machines heading
towards you with one thought
on their mind - your death.
It's not all hard, mashing,
action, though, it does have
ﬂashes of comedy, such as
between each level, when
your Chief bashes the table in
his anger at the way the
terrorists have taken over the
city.
Another variation on a
tried (and trying!) and tested
theme. Quite a good blast.
STREET
FIGHTER
Several years back you may
remember that David Bowie
and Mick Jagger got down to
some 'dancing in the street'
but in this beauty you can get
down to some serious vicious
smegging in the street.
It's a one-on-one combat
game with heeee-uge sprites
that animate all over, i.e. they
shufﬂe and breathe as well as
smack and kick.
The opponents are many
and varied as you work your
way up the 'street-toughness'
ladder and your opponent's
moves are different
according to who they are.
Apparently, in London's
West End, spectators actually
bet on who'll win while two
players slug it out on screen.
It's that real. But then again,
it might just be that some
people will bet on anything.
(UNNAMED)
RACING GAME
Another in a line of formula
one racing games but this
time with a rather smart,
seemingly-digitised, car to
drive.
It moves smoothly even if
the sounds not always as
smart as it could be.
However, the main
attraction to the game is that
up to four players can race
simultaneously if two of the
standard two-player, two-
steering-wheel, cabinets are
connected.
410

This leads to some very
competitive and absorbing
racing, replete with skid-offs,
crashes and pit-stops. Drive,
drive, drive!
BLADE MASTER
This is one of those large-
men-with-large-swords battle
games with an implausible
and amusingly translated
scenario, largely to do with
evil Warlords and kidnapped
girlfriends/princesses and
large weapons (0o-er!).
This means that you (and
a friend) must stride
purposefully around (initially)
a castle, slicing and dicing
the fantasy-inspired creatures
that head toward you as well
as smashing urns to gain
bonuses and the like.
The graphics are in the
Golden Axe style and are, as
you would expect, well
coloured and animated whilst
the sound is satisfyingly
swishing and chopping!
MIDNIGHT
WANDERERS/
CHARIOT/DON'T
PULL
Three games rolled into one
is not something you often
get with new arcade games
but this Japanese wonder
has three games, two of
which feature the same
characters.
Midnight Wanderers sees
a rather Ghouls and Ghosts
style of play as you seek out
the Magical Chariot to save
an imprisoned princess (Hold
on, we've had this scenario!
Ed).
The characters are as
cutesy as anything but with a
Mediaeval/Mythical tinge to
them. It's
really pretty damn
playable.
Chariot picks up where
Midnight Wanderers leaves
off, with the player(s) now
ﬂying through a sort-of magic
cloud-land, avoiding vicious,
er, bricks and shooting evil
moons. It's also chock full of
fairies...
Don't Pull seems to be
the turkey of the
three. It's a puzzler in
the tradition of
Peng° - you wander
around a maze made
of movable blocks,
collecting things and
crushing monsters.
It's sickeningly
cutesy and not my
cup of tea to tell the
truth. It also
F  E A T  
E
disappoints by being rather
unplayable.
FOOTBALL
CHAMP
This has to be the hottest
machine out of all on display.
It's THE football arcade
machine. You pick the
number of players (up to
four), the country you're
playing for and let rip.
Obviously you'll know
the rules of football - and
so does the ref. He stays
with you throughout the
match and is ever-ready
to adjudicate.
When he does (for a
throw-in or free kick)
there's a rather spiffy
TV-style zoom-in on
the player taking the
shot.
The players
themselves are in a
very 1950's Roy of
the Rovers style
whilst the sound has rather
impressive crowd cheering.
There are also two
commentators who bug you
throughout the match, and
photographers, whose lenses
you can knock over
(accidentally, of course!) if
you kick the ball off near the
goal.
This arcade game's a
corker. If it was a C64 game
it'd be a Fun One right away!

NAME: Final Blow
SUPPLIER: Storm
PRICE: TBC
RELEASE DATE: September
the opportunity to become the
next world champion without
getting your face damaged, in
the comfort of your own home.
The aim is to splatter your
opponent and get him carried
out of the arena, using a
combination of strength and
skill.
The ring is shown from the
side y o u  can seethe
audience on the other- and the
boxing characters loom huge,
they're larger than your
average sprite! You don't get
the whole ring on the screen,
either, as you beat your
opponent backwards (or they
beat you backwards!), the
screen scrolls to reveal the
ropes.
The boxers move their legs
Nand arms in a grand fashion,
punching meetly at each other,
blocking shots when they can.
Their size really adds to the
action. In our preview version
there's no sound but we're sure
it'll be corking, as will the
ﬁnished boxer graphics and
movements.
So if blood and violence has
you intrigued, then Final Blow
will be the game for you. It's 
•
shaping up to be a real knock-
'em-out game that you
must have a look at
upon its release.

THE SKORES
NO SKORE - This game is
too abysmal for words.
0  - It'd probably be
worthwhile using the
cassette to record an E.M.F.
single on or something.
0 0  - Not even worth a look.
It's only appeal would be for
amusement.
0 0 0  - This is an average
budgie game, and would
probably ﬁll a gap on a rainy
Sunday afternoon.
0 0 0 0  - This game is rather
splendid really, but it lacks
that certain something that
determines a 'must buy'.
0 0 0 0 0  - This is the best
you're likely to get for your
pocket money. Well worth
raiding your piggy bank for.
RED HEAT
HIT SQUAD £2.99
I haven't seen the ﬁlm and
(excuse my ignorance) hadn't
actually heard of it until I saw
this game, so I didn't know
what this was going to be
about.
You play the part of
super-butch, bull-slapping
hero Ivan Danko (or Arnie-
baby to you and me) whose
job it is to track down Viktor
Rostavili, the head of an
international drug-trafﬁcking
ring.
In the ﬁrst part you guide
Ivan through a rather large
and sweaty hot house,
punching, head butting,
shooting or just insulting
every hired heavy that comes
at you. There are various
objects lying around to be
picked up, including guns
and energy.
If you make it out of the
hot house then you will go on
to a hospital, the streets of
Chicago and another
location.
The graphics are quite
detailed, even if you do only
see half of your man at a
time. The do work well and
the animation is good. The
music is a bit weird, I
couldn't make up my mind
whether is was crap or not.
There is quite an original
high score table input, it
looks like a reel of ﬁlm
turning when you select.
I suppose this is worth
the asking price, it will
probably keep you coming
back for a few goes.

When the Americans do
something they do it in style.
Baseball is a game to be
reckoned with and after you
have played RBI2 Baseball
you'll be a great fan of

Once these guys go down
to the park to play ball, all
they have in their mind is to

Americans must have a

ends in a draw due to the
weather; a Baseball player is
so macho he is not deterred

RBI Baseball simulates
real baseball in the sense
that all the rules and game
plan are the same, and before
you start to worry, the rules
are not difﬁcult to learn. You
have nine innings, a batter, a

guessed that, but it is not so
simple!
The aim of the batter is to
smack the ball out of sight
over the grandstand for a
home run,
The ﬁeld is split into both
defence and offence, the
pitcher is deffensive and
must sthke out his offensive
opponents by hurling the ball
at an amazing speed of up to
100 mph. When the batter
hits it, they must sprint to one
of four 'bases' before the ball
is caught and thrown at a
'base'.
The umpire is never
wrong, if you are out there is
no arguing with him. This
must be the reason why J
Mcenroe took up tennis as
there is no place in Baseball
for a super-brat. Then again
he doesn't get his own way in
Tennis!
Just like the real game if
your team is struggling then
you must change the players.
The players do get tired
during a game, especially the
pitcher, as no one can throw
a ball at an average of 90

mph all night.
So put on your glove and
cap in this fantastic and well-
detailed high-action ball-
against-wood game. This
must be the most realistic
version of Baseball and you
don't even have to
be an American to
enjoy it.

If you like the older style top-
view racing games, then
you'll love this.
Straightforward idea,
drive as fast as you can
whilst avoiding other
vehicles, oil slicks and mines
etc. There are things to be
picked up, including energy
pods, shields and point
bonuses.
Special cans can also be
collected to spell out
'ENERGY', which will replace
all of your fuel.
Whilst driving along, you
can jump to pass otherwise
untraversable areas and cars.
You can land on enemy cars
to squash them for bonus
points.
By pressing ﬁre and
pulling back, you can change
to a motor bike if you feel it
at all necessary.
The graphics are suitable
and the sound is OK. And,
like I said, if you like older
racing games, you really will
enjoy this one.

You take the part of veteran
cop Ofﬁcer Bob, whose job it
is to clear the
streets of crime.
You must
work your way
through just one
week. Each day
you are given up
to four different
offenders that
must be
apprehended,
these range from
litterbugs and
drunks to highly
dangerous drug-dealers.
Sometimes, when you
catch a particularly nasty
offender, he must be taken to
the station and questioned
by, strangely enough,
waggling the joystick until he
confesses. And, by God, I
don't think I could take too
much of that either.
If all goes well your salary
bonus should be quite a
hefty one.
It looks quite good and it
runs fairly smoothly. The
David Whittaker music ﬁts
the game quite well, too. Not
amazing but fun to play and
worth a few quid.

Switch b lad e...
T
he scene is not too
exciting, Havoc has
descended on the
lands, 'cos a rather powerful
peace-keeping sword has
been disintergrated by a
bunch of bad guys.
You, as a good guy
(natch!), have to ﬁnd all the
sixteen pieces so that Havoc
can be defeated and
everybody can live a happy,
peaceful existence, listening
to Radio 3 and tending their
gardens.
To achieve this you must
wander around exploring
underground caverns and
encountering various nestles.
Better weapons than the
blade you begin with can be
found lying around, altough
some are hidden by
backgrounds, so it is worth
checkimng everywhere.
Better weapons have
limited shots,
usually about
twenty shots
per weapon.
The strength
of certain
weapons can be
increased by
keeping the ﬁre button
depressed, and is indicated
by a power bar.
Pieces of the sword are
also hidden anout the place,
along with other useful items,
such as energy boosts,
weapon enhancers, and
power ups can be
discovered.
A majority of the
underground backgrounds
are brickwork, and some of
this can be shot away to gain
access to other rooms and to
reveal hidden objects. These
look slightly different from
normal bricks, and it is worth
knocking all of them away,
just to see what happens.
The control of your
warrior-sprite takes a bit of
getting used to, and at ﬁrst
seems really awful. You can
kick, ﬁre, jump and run. All
fairly standard, really.
The graphics are quite
bad on the whole, the sprites
in-particular are pretty awful.
Some
are pretty
respectable, though, and the
explosions are nice, with
pieces of whatever you've
destroyed ﬂoating about the
screen for a while.
The music and sound isn't
too good, tending towards the
dull and repetitive side of life.
The presentation isn't really up
to the mark, either.
It might sound that on the
whole it isn't really that good,
but there is a strange
addiction that creeps over you
and a nice control method that
will make you play this quite a
bit.
My ﬁrst impression of this
game was, "Oh God, this looks
awful". It didn't seem to play
very well either. After forcing
myself to have a go at it a few
times, I started to get into it
quite a bit. After a few
hours of play, I was
really hooked.

I, like so many other people,
played this game when it ﬁrst
hit the scene and was totally
amazed by the graphics and
sheer speed of it. Playing it
again now it seems a bit
tame and, well, slower than I
remember. This is not to say
that it's not a good game.
The graphics are still
pretty smooth
and fairly fast
and they
respond well
to your
joystick
instructions.
And the
colour,
although
limited, ﬁts
quite well.
The idea is
to explore the
city of Targ
and eventually gain sufﬁcient
equipment to enable you to
escape. During your jaunt
through Targ you will
encounter many vector-
graphical structures
reresenting buildings and
objects that must be put to
use to help you solve puzzles
and get out of town.
There are jobs to be had,
things to buy and cheese to
ﬂy around on. All quite weird
and wonderful, challenging
and absorbing.
A real classic game on
the old 64, one that should
not be missed by people who
did not catch it ﬁrst time
around. At this price. with the
second city included, it really
is great value for money.

central Africa, trying
to obtain a suntan a
group of Zutulan
revolutionaries decide to have
a bit of fun by kidnapping an
ex-president of the United
States of America.
What the hell is he doing
there? I here you cry! On a
peace assignment for the
peace of the world, far out
man, peace to all brothers
and love thou neighbour
yeah! A typical hippy attitude
towards life.
That could be the reason
for saying at the beginning of
the game "Winners do not
use drugs" but they come
very close to becoming a
champion, saying no names,
don't they?
The Americans decide
they will not send in military
intervention and lose loadsa
lives. So they can send in the
Mercs to stop the entire
Zutulan rebels, of course! I
should have
remembered that
one man
can wipe
out the
11Sti.l e .  ALL RICHTS RESERLIED
nation
of Africa!
Are you
set to go to Africa?
You are a trained soldier and
an expert in anti-terrorist
tactics.
So with all that training go
and beat-em-up the way
mercs do, giving no mercy to
the enemy (whilst Julia
Roberts would sleep with the
enemy. I know which one I
would prefer and its a
different sort of action packed
fun). (Er... oo-er! Ed.)
Mercs is split into eight
thrill packed levels containing,
game play straight outta
"Beach Head", where the
enemy is ready to destroy you
or an "Airbase" where the ﬁre
power is beyond belief.
This section is the heart of
the matter and the life of the
president lies in your hands.
Shoot everything in sight
as crates hide energy,
weapons and a Megabomb.
Also collect as many medals,
as when you kill all those
innocent and the not so
innocent Africans you can
become a hero and have a
chest full of medals. (Don't
normal men have hair on their
chests? Yes, but you're a
Merc super-hero.)
Merc is a rather hard
game to play, which makes it
more interesting than the
other commando beat-'em-
ups as, if you can complete a
game in just a few tries, you
mill get bored of the game
and put it to the side. The
graphics and sonics are
pretty trendy indeed
with a very smooth
game play.

G
amazement! The
board game Dungeons
and Dragons has been
designed as a commie
adventure game (again) in the
form of "Hero Quest".
So with no hesitation I
grasped my joystick and set
forth to accomplish the
mighty task that lay ahead.
"Why is it a mighty task?"
I hear you say. Well, for many
decades the legions of
Morzar the Lord of Chaos
have destroyed all. Even the
bravest of the brave warriors
of the Empire have turned
and ﬂed with their tails
between their legs!
Hero Quest is a fantasy
role playing game with a dash
of "let's stick it to 'em! Boot
'em in the head!" too.
You have the chance to
role-play the Magician, an Elf,
a Barbarian or a Dwarf, who
all have their own
characteristics, strengths and
weaknesses (because, let's
face it, a Barbarian or a Dwarf
is not going to be able to cast
a spell and the Magician
won't have a clue about
weapons, eh? Then again,
Lionel Blair didn't have a clue
either and look were he got).
The computer controls all
the movements of the evil
Wizard and therefore giving
you more trouble than you
could have anticipated.
A typical board game is
long and sometimes tedious,
but you won't ﬁnd that with
this game as - yes! - you have
the chance to play with up to
four players at a single time,
tell me how many computer
games can do this for
entertainment.
Just because it's on your
Commie, matey, doesn't
mean the rules of the board
game change, either, since
these old veteran dinosaur
people stick to traditions.
This means only a few rules
have been altered as new
ideas must seep through, this
can only lead to better
gameplay on the computer
version.
Hero Quest has an
outstanding amount of levels,
too. In fact, a staggering 14
levels, but the primary rule is
to always start with the Maze.
This level has a fabulous
scenario and you can't go
wrong unless you run into the
evil wizard.
Just like a board game
you move in turns using the
dice symbol.
Stop! Do not go despair
and go round shouting those
unruly swear words as the
game is not that boring, it is
more fun than those Sunday
mornings at Grandma's
house having to put up with
the same old conversation.
But I know you like
adventures with maybe a few
tactics and beat-em-up parts
thrown in, well this has them
all. Combat is not combat
without you doing the actions
and getting the feel of your
man as combat is split into
two different stages. Which
are attack and defence.
Sounds alright... until you
ﬁnd out that the computer
moderates all the action!
What? That's not on, it's
worse than just standing
there watching your mate get
the living daylights kicked out
of him in a pub punch up.
What's he on about? Well,
if the computer controls your
moves and you attack the
Commie he is not going to
give you moves that will kill
him, all you can do is wait
and hope that you have
enough strength to withstand
his attack.
Readers, don't get the
wrong impression about Hero
Quest as I'm not slagging it
down, the scroll play is
amazing and the adventures
will have you glued for hours

on levels like "Legacy of the
arc warlord" where it is vital
to ﬁnd equipment and
escape or "The stone hunter"
where you must investigate
legendary Karlen to become
wealthy.
Puzzles must also be
solved and so as not to get
caught in trap doors, outwit
those obscene monsters by
gaining money and becoming
wealthy as
this will boost
your body
strength and
gain you
more body
points.
I also note that the
magician has spells such as
"Genie" and "Earth, Wind,
and Fire". He must be a real
groovy designer but a bit off
the music scene, eh?
Hero Quest is not bad.
Not all that impressive but an
improvement from the board
game.
So, if you are one of the
sort of people who enjoys
fast action-packed games I
advise you to give this one a
miss, as this sort of game is
for your typical
stamp collector.

had a lre a d y  lost his ma rb l e s  b u t
n o w  Ra i n b o w  Arts h a v e  p u t  t h e m
in a  p u zzle g a me !
w h e r e  seem to be as
many puzzle games
around as driving games
at the moment. They land on
my desk and seem to say:
"Hello, I'm a new and even
more ﬁendish puzzle game, I
bet you can't work me out!"
But, unlike Gem-X last ish,
I've twigged this one, oh yes.
And it goes like this...
Marbles, and plenty of
them.
They come one at a time
from the side of the screen
(who knows who's throwing
them) and roll (looks more like
'slide') up and down a tube-
like marble-run until they ﬁnd
an empty slot in (depending
upon the ﬁendishness of the
level) one or more four-hole
wheels.
These top wheels are
connected to a network of
others and, by spinning the
wheels around and pulling the
joystick in a certain manner
(00-er!), you can send the
marbles roll_ er... sliding
around the grid.
You do all this for a
particular reason. To ﬁnish a
screen you must 'explode'
every wheel on it. This
doesn't mean dynamiting it
and losing it from the game
(although that could well have
made the game more
interesting, if not much more
exciting!), it means ﬁlling a
wheel with four similarly-
coloured marbles, at which
point it explodes!
To make things difﬁcult,
not all the wheels are
connected to each other and
sometimes there may only be
one or two wheels as an
entrance to a massive grid of
other wheels.
As the levels progress,

restrictions start cropping up
on some of the connecting
chutes between wheels, only
a certain colour can pass
down a chute, things like that.
And what makes it the
most difﬁcult and awkward of
all is that the marbles (appear
to) arrive randomly. Of course,
if you're trying to ﬁll a wheel
full of one particular colour
and you're waiting for the
fourth matching marble, you'll
probably say that it's not
random at all but working
against you, as you pile away
another wrong-coloured bead.
But that's part of the fun!
So, like all puzzle games, it
appears eminently simple but
in practice it's a real pain. An
addictive pain, of course.
Now, I hear you ask, what
have Rainbow Arts come up
with? Well, the answer is:
another damn good puzzle
game for the collection, as if
you didn't have enough of
them already.
The graphics might be
pretty poo-er, in fact they ARE
pretty poo-er, but the jolly
tunes will egg you on as you
experience the grip of the
game's best element - its
gameplay wh ic h  is
stupendous. You wouldn't
credit such a small,
unassuming, puzzle game
with such addictive gameplay.
So I have no reservation in
saying that Logical is this
month's star puzzle game and
is worth shelling out the
readies for if a) you like this
sort of thing or b) you haven't
bought a puzzle game in a
while and are feeling
withdrawal tinges
from the genre.

This month's star puzzle game:

QUATTRO 4
CARTOONS
CODEMASTERS - 2.99
Code Masters have been at
the compilation lark again,
this time with four of their
'Cartoon Time' games...
In Frankenstein Junior,
Franky has to solve mystery
of the whereabouts of his
father's body! He has to be
careful not to have his heart
broken into many pieces by
ghosts and the like as he
plods around a creepy
house. It's a hilarious game,
full of action.
Little Puff sees a cute
character getting heavy-
head-hassle from the toll
collector. It he doesn't pay
up, he can't go home (aaah,
poor Putt). But! By collecting
magic potion he can breath
ﬁre and become a real
dragon.
This makes it easier to
collect four letters to give to
the toll man. With Little Puff,
fantastic animation of the
cartoon ﬁgures goes with
great gameplay (Oil Are you
reading the box? Ed).
Creatures with no bodies
play a starring role in Wizard
Willy, such as eyes winking
at you - it must be your lucky
day!
Willy must 'zap and
'kerpow' all the evil gouls
and guardians in the
dungeons with his magic
powers.
Stan and 011i were a
funny bunch of guys in their
time, now here come 011i and
Lissa. In 011i and Lissa 3, 011i
has the misfortune of having
to ﬁnd the pieces of Lissa's
car.
He must go through thick
and thin with his nose to the
ﬂoor, spying through a
magniﬁng glass, looking for
clues, because this is a
puzzle/arcade-adventure
game.
The constriktion of this
game is well thought-out,
with some real rib-tickling
actions on the part of 011i.
Code Masters have put
together four rather good
games and for this price you
Can't really go wrong, unless
you have them all already!

J a s o n  M i l l e r  puts on his Brian
Clough false n o se an d  his Ro n
Atkinson fright-wig, re a d y  to play
ball with an o t h er D + H  footie
offering.
A
parrot, like most of
the football managers
of today, who pull their hair
out when the results don't
go their way?
Well, you can step into
their slip-on shoes with this
'un.
From the terraces of "El
Estadio Bernabeau" of Real
Madrid with my scarf and
ﬂame-thrower (Flame-
thrower?!! Ed), giving
football that element of

excitement, I was grabbed
by YC to give a view on this
new footle game simulation.
MPS is a management
game, where it is your task
to manage your team against
60-odd computer-managed
teams or 3 non-computer
players (i.e. your friends, if
you have any). What more do
you want? If you want
something that'll take a
while, this is it.
I can tell you for nothing
that you will need a pack of

Gilette Blue razors, you'll
probably have grown a
beard before you have even
got half way through the
season.
But the good things do
come to those who wait,
because as footie manager
games go, this is one of the
best. The strategy behind
the game must be mastered
if you are to win and, once
you're hooked, you'll be
there for hours, awaiting the
results and hoping that the
teams above you lose just
like the real thing!
The other side of footie is -
also in play. The old
hooligans and their bottles of
beer cause trouble when
ever they can. Yobboes are
hard to keep down and they
give your club a bad
reputation which can lead to
a ﬁne.
Money is very important,
there being a ﬁnancial
aspect to this game - so
you'd better hope that you
don't get to manage Millwall,
or you'll be bankrupted in
minutes!
One thing to be noted is
that there's no arcade
element to it. Not even any
game highlights throughout
the whole 30-week season,
the League and FA cup ties
also. Despite this, the idea of
competing and trying to
become the best manager in
England is some task to
behold, with your technical
ability put to the test. You
need to know things such as

If there's one thing that
this icon-controlled game

If you're into incredibly dull
American thrillers and court-

you only appreciate good
thrillers, with original plots,
more twists than Chubby
Checker, and real, hard
action, you'll ﬁnd Back Stab
a load of daytime TV crud.
Architect Cliff Murphy
(James Brolin) has been set
up in a murder case and
he's sent to jail. His lawyer
(Meg Foster) can't save him
from that fate, but does try
to help him once he
convinces her that he's
innocent. It's all been done
before, the acting is as stale

Eddie

con-man who
gets in over
his head when
he's mistaken
for a very
successful
business man,
but
recognising a
good thing, he
plays along to
hilarious
consequences. The action is
fairly fast paced, Carvey is a
natural at playing the fool,
and a good support cast
take a mediocre plot to
reasonable heights.
American comedies can
sometimes be only funny to
those involved in the project
but Opportunity Knocks has
that free-ﬂowing humour
element that makes it
genuinely funny enough to
appeal to a British audience.

Bill Pritchard's new LP
provides just that. There's
guitars in there, but rather
good laid-back guitars.
There's ever-so-thoughtful
songs, too, about life, the
universe and everything. It's
all done with style and grace,
with a hint of long-suffering
humour and experience.
If you're looking for
something that's worth
slapping on the stereo which
isn't run-of-the-mill

your man. Even if he does

HORROR IN
THE DARK #1
Fantagor Press
For Mature Readers
Just like all the rest of the horror
anthology comics that we've
seen over the years, Horror in
the Dark sets out to shock us
and try to make us so spooked
that we won't be able to sleep at
night. What the creator doesn't
realise is that what we don't
L particularly want is a few select
tales about mummies, zombies,
and things that go bump in the
night.
Subtle horror is far more
scarey in this day and age. Take
Stephen King's Misery, for
instance, not a single cliched
spook in sight, yet it's much
more frightening that the
Creature from the Black Lagoon.
And although were presented
with three tales of carnage, with
some of the best computer art
ever seen on two of the strips, its
so old hat that the rims fallen off
described as a road movie in
the air.
Robert Downey Jnr. is an
unemployed pilot, having
recently been sacked from
his 'Spy in the Sky' spot on
radio. He is recruited by the
States air force to ﬂy supplies
in an around the country of
Laos, a few thousand miles
away from the war-raged
Vietnam. Mel Gibson is
already an experienced
employee of 'Air America',
who are secretly helping the
American war effort in
private.
and the bowler part has been
caved in. I'd be more scared by
the poll-tax inspector!
SLANG #2
Slang Publishing,
11 Elm Grove Road,
Salisbury,
Wilts,
SP1 1JW.
Slang is a very good
independent comic that deals
with social issues, whilst
crossing them with a spot of
humour and a good helping of
surreality. What it keeps away
from, unlike many comics in this
bracket, is the Viz style strip and
would be best described as
Deadline without the boring bits.
Its a little gem that I found
tucked away in a Camden comic
shop, but you should write to the
above address and ﬁnd out
what it's all about yourself.

The plot chugs along and
has many undertones (drug
running, unnecessary danger
to pilots, etc.) although fails
to concentrate on any one of
them, and therefore is more a
view into what happens to
our two stars than actually
captivates you with a
storyboard. Although it'd
keep you entertained for a
night, I can't help wondering
whether it'd be as worthwhile
if it wasn't for the main
actors?

THE NAKED
GUN 2 1/2 -
THE SMELL
OF FEAR
Paramount Pictures
(Certiﬁcate '12')
Stars: Leslie Nielsen,
Priscilla Presley
A plethora of jokes and belly
laughs that make your eyes
water and other parts of the
body dribble - is how I'd
describe the ﬁrst Naked Gun
movie, and because it was so
superbly funny it's very hard for
this sequel to live up to its
expectations.
Needless to say that it
doesn't, I mean after all it is a
follow-up, and the track record
of sequels is pretty poor.
Naked Gun 2 1/2 DOES
have a few choice moments
though, and could easily be
described as the funniest movie
of the year. Frank Drebin (Leslie
Nielsen), you see, is a bumbling
cop who has been the brunt of
some hilarious escapades
across the two ﬁlms and the TV
series Police Squad, and if
you're a fan of the Redrock
("It's not red, and there's no
rocks in it!") ads, you'll love all
of it.

ROBIN HOOD
- PRINCE OF
THIEVES
(Certiﬁcate '12')
B I G
111. 11%/111
RH
Stars: Kevin Costner,
Morgan Freeman, Mary
Elizabeth Mastrantonio
"Kevin Costner, Kevin Costner,
riding through the Glen. Kevin
Costner, Kevin Costner, and his
merry men. Steals from the rich,
gives to the poor. Kevin
Costner..."
Hmmrn, Doesn't quite scan,
does it? That was the (er,
updated) theme to the 60's
"Robin Hood" TV programme
and, to tell the truth, I thought
Kevin "Concerned" Costner
would ﬁt as badly into this ﬁlm
as his name does into that song.
But then I saw the ﬁlm and I
was knocked out of my boots,
for verily it was quite good. It's
an action-packed romp through
olde Englande, in which Robin
(Costner - surprise!) comes
back from the Crusades to ﬁnd
his castle gutted - he's pretty
gutted, too! - and the Sheriff of
Nottingham (played very
amusingly) riding roughshod
over the Land and threatening
to take the Throne.
So he goes into the forest
and meets a bunch of outlaws
(including Brian Blessed and
Christian Slater) and Marian -
the King's cousin - who, to cut a
long story short, ﬁght a lot, drink
a lot, and get to a gripping ﬁnale
which involves much suspense,
ﬂashing of arrows and blades
through the air and inevitable
love between Robin and Marian.
This ﬁlm is both funny and
involving, with a large amount of
medieval archery-action. Its a
winner.

FROM THE SCRIPT II
THE REVENGE
Hey, this is not a test, this is
kofﬁemelk and stroop-
woffels! That's right, this
edition of "Tales...' is brought
to you from the heart of
Holland (well, actually from a
rather seedy back bar in one
of the less fashionable ends
of the Netheregions), a
country incredibly exciting
and unfeasibly boring and
equal doses - kind of like
watching a nice
colour of paint dry. But
whatever else it is, it's not a
country for movie buffs.
If the French (Dutch-
subtitles) B-movies or repeat
showings of Mr T in D.0 CAB
on RTL-Plis don't get you,
MERMAIDS in Dutch will.
Luckily the sex museum
provided some welcome
relief (oo-ert) from TV hell and
the movie world went 'gek'
(Dutch for 'crazy') as soon as
I turned my MEMPHIS BELLE
crew-jacketed back on
'Engeland', so here's a more
meatier tales than usual.

HOOK, Steven Spielberg's
big-budget fantasy, starring
Robin Williams and Julia
Roberts, is soon to be teven
Spielberg's bug-budget
fantasy starring just Robin
Williams - PRETTY WOMAN
star Julia looks set to drop
the project faster than a hot
Kiefer.
Pulling out of marriage
and a major movie in a single
month may be a big step for
Julia but it's another blow for
the luckless HOOK, well into
its six-month shooting
schedule with still only bits
and pieces in the can.
WHEN HARRY MET
SALLY and THE DOORS' Meg
Ryan will replace Julia if she
does go, but HOOK looks
shakier every day.

RECORDS
Kevin Reynolds $57 million
ROBIN HOOD becomes the
ﬁrtst true blockbuster of the
summer, despite some weak
reviews. Obviously the
biggest media/avertising
spend of all time has paid off,
for the ﬁlm grossed $25
million on its opening
weekend, making it the
eighth-highest opener in
Hollywood history.
ROBIN HOOD II: THE
ADVENTURE BEGINS, the
'prequel', already has a
promising script but count
Costner out.
Meanwhile, opening
records look set to be broken
again and again this summer
(as in 1989), as THE NAKED

CUJO, CATS EYE and a few
other King stories beginning
with 'c' followed THE
SHINING to the big screen.
Of the 90's adaptations,
GRAVEYARD SHIFT has
already opened and, well,
stiffed. The tasty, three-hour-
plus TV version of IT (with
Tim Curry as Pennywise the
clown) should be available to
rent on video now.
And in Hollywood, several
adaptations are underway.
The most ambitious, THE
LAWNMOWER MAN, is a $10
million futuristic thriller
loosely based (as with THE
RUNNING MAN) on King's
short story of the same
name.
Starring Jeff PSYCHO III
Fahey and Pierce "Not James
Bond" Brosnan, THE
LAWNMOWER MAN is
distinctive in that it will be the
ﬁrst feature ﬁlm to use 'virtual
reality', allowing the audience
to experience sensations felt
by the characters on the
screen.
Also in progress are
screen adaptations of THE
TOM MYKNOCKERS,
SOMETIMES THEY COME
BACK, THE STAND and THE
DARK HALF, the latter to be
made by •couldn't direct-
trafﬁc' George A. Romero.
Watch too for CHILDREN
OF THE CORN II: DEADLY

see, has some neat-looking
publicity stuff...

HONEY,

Original HONEY
director Joe
Johnston has his
$55 million+ comic-
strip movie THE
ROCKETEER
opening in the UK on
August 2. Last (for
now) of the big
budget comic-strip features
(after SUPERMAN, BATMAN
and DICK TRACY), THE
ROCKETEER will hopefully be
a big earner, despite the
relative obscurity of Dave
Stevens' superlative comic-
strup and the fact that,
despite a worldwide gross of
S253.4 million, BATMAN is
still $35.8 million short of
breaking even, joining a
growing list of hugely-
sucessful movies (including
ALIEN, COMING TO
AMERICAN and FATAL
ATTRACTION) that somehow
never manage to show a net

NED'S
ATOMIC
DUSTBIN
Nothing is Cool
47 Minutes
If you've never seen Ned's
live, this is the video to get.
The frantic, thrashing indie-
pop style of the band is
unlike anything else on this
planet, and 'Nothing is Cool'
is a good insight into the
band itself and what drives
them to sound like they do
(generally tonnes of ciggies
and copious amounts of
alcohol).
The video is a compilation
of every song Ned's have in
their current repertoire, plus
the promo of their biggest hit
"Kill Your Television" (a ravin'
noise of a song, best
appreciated whilst
wearing a holed,
grey sweater
and waving
from side to
side
maniacally).
If you're
into good
music of the
thrash-'til-you-
drop kind, you'd
be a peculiarly
shaped banana (i.e.
square) to miss out!

Unspoilt by
Progress
42 Minutes
PWEI (as they're better
known) are a bunch of lager-
drinking geezers who spew
out an excellent mix of thrash
metal, goth melodies, and
hardcore hip-hop.
Their music is inspired by
their insistence on 'avin' a
laugh and the lyrics on most
of the songs shown here
proves this.
'Unspoilt by Progress'
shows
you exactly
how unspoilt
PWEI are, as it

to present

JE$US JONES
Big in Alaska
33 Minutes
Jesus Jones are the most
respected band that actually
manage to retain an
individuality yet hit
the charts time
and time
again.
The ﬁrst
album was
the best
thing since
sliced bread
(especially
the sliced
bread you can
get with the little
'dead ant look-a-like'
sesame seeds sprinkled on
top) and the second - although
more mellow - hits you like a
steam engine colliding with an
over-ripe plum!
'Big in Alaska' features the
videos of the band's hits from
both albums (seven of them)
and links each with a
camcorder-shot piece of
interviewing performed by the
lead singer, Mike Edwards,
himself.
Fans would never miss this,
but if you we're going to
dismiss it just because they've
made it into the charts, and
therefore it's not cool to like
them, think again.
Why miss out on something
just because your kid sister
likes it?
