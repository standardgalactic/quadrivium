Author’s Acknowledgments
Every book is a group effort, and this one is no exception. I want to 
thank everyone who made this book possible, including Tracy 
Boggier, Wiley acquisitions editor, who asked me to revisit 
housetraining, and Alissa Schwipps, Wiley senior project editor, who 
graciously made time in her crazy-busy schedule to do a literary 
three-peat with me. Thanks also to Patty Kovach, DVM, technical 
reviewer, whose expertise made this a better book; The Lunch 
Bunch — Victoria Schade, Pat Miller, Robin Bennett, Colleen Pelar, 
Penelope Brown, and Pam Wanveer — from whom I learn so much and 
have a great time doing so; and Windy Run’s Allie McChappell, CGC 
(Canine Good Citizen), housetraining ace and the best office dog/
canine muse an author could have. And most of all, Stan Chappell, my 
husband, and Julie Chappell, my daughter, for being there for me when 
I’ve needed them (especially when I’ve taken unexpected bumps to the 
head) and for cheering me on the rest of the time.

Introduction
W
hen you brought home that adorable little puppy or noble-
looking adult dog, you undoubtedly were looking forward 
to a lifetime of love, devotion, and companionship. Maybe you 
wanted a dog to jog with in the morning, have curl up at your feet 
in the evening, or talk to during the day. Perhaps you were looking 
forward to heaping lots of unconditional love upon a hard-luck 
rescue dog who hadn’t known such love before. Or maybe you 
remembered watching Lassie when you were a kid and were 
hoping that your new family member could be the same sort of 
friend-of-a-lifetime that the famous Collie was for little Timmy.
Every new relationship between a person and a dog starts out with 
at least a little bit of fantasizing on the part of the person. Soon 
thereafter, though, reality intrudes upon those fantasies. All too 
often, that intrusion takes the form of a puddle or pile deposited 
on the floor of your home. The puddle is gross. The pile stinks. 
Both leave stains. And you are totally grossed out.
Loving a pooch who turns your nicely decorated home into a 
canine outhouse is tough. But this problem doesn’t have to 
happen. You just need to teach your dog proper potty manners. In 
other words, you need to housetrain him.
When your dog is housetrained, both of your lives become a 
whole lot easier and immeasurably more satisfying. Gone are the 
doggie accidents, stains, and smells that keep professional carpet 
cleaners in business but all too often ruin the precious bonds 
between dogs and their people. I’ve written this book to make sure 
that you and your dog maintain those bonds.
About This Book
Housetraining For Dummies, 2nd Edition, is a reference book 
designed to help you not only teach your dog the ins and outs 
of basic bathroom behavior but also prevent your pooch from 
developing potty problems — or solve any problems she 
already has.
Whether you have a brand-new puppy who’s piddling on your 
equally new Oriental rug; an unruly adolescent male dog who’s 
practicing leg-lifts (and subsequent anointings) right next to your 

Housetraining For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
2
antique loveseat; a matronly female dog who’s wetting her bed 
while she sleeps; or simply a pooch who never seems to know 
what he’s supposed to do when you take him out, this book can 
help you sort out your dog’s bathroom issues and resolve them, 
no matter what they are.
You don’t have to read this book from start to finish to teach your 
canine companion proper potty deportment. If you want to know 
everything and then some about housetraining, begin reading here 
and plow through to the end. But if you have a specific concern, 
such as wanting to teach your dog to tell you when she needs 
to go out, skip the preliminaries, look over the table of contents, 
and proceed to the chapter that tells you exactly what you want 
to know.
Finally, this book is meant to be a guide but not a substitute for 
the up-close-and-personal advice that other experts such as veteri-
narians, trainers, and behaviorists give. If the suggestions here 
don’t work for you and your dog, or if you have a question that 
this book doesn’t cover, don’t hesitate to contact any of these 
professionals.
Conventions Used in This Book
To help you find your way through this book — as in all For 
Dummies books — I’ve used the following conventions:
 
✓ Italics highlight new words and terms.
 
✓ Boldfaced text indicates the actions in numbered steps and 
keywords in bulleted lists.
 
✓ Monofont indicates a Web address.
In addition, I’ve added some conventions of my own. For one thing, 
I’m not even going to try to sound genteel in this book — after all, 
you’re dealing with bodily waste here. That’s why I refer to canine 
bodily byproducts as poop and pee — although I occasionally 
substitute other terms just for the sake of variety.
At the same time, I refrain from using other terms commonly 
employed in discussions of pooch potty protocol. Specifically, I 
don’t use the words housebreak, housebreaking, or housebroken 
anywhere in this book, except when I describe the history of 
canine toilet training. That’s because when you teach your dogs 
to eliminate appropriately, you’re not breaking anything. In fact, 
you’re doing quite the opposite: By teaching the dog to poop and 

 Introduction

pee when and where you want him to, you’re building bonds 
between you two. You’re laying the foundation for a loving, 
long-lasting relationship.
Finally, there’s the matter of gender. Many writers like to refer 
to canine companions in gender-neutral terms such as it unless 
discussing a specific dog, such as Daisy or Max. But I don’t agree 
with them. Any dog, even if spayed or neutered, has a clear gender. 
More importantly, every dog is a living being who deserves the 
dignity of being referred to as such. For that reason, I use the word 
who, not that, along with he, she, him, her, his, and hers to refer to 
canine companions. I tend to alternate the genders of the example 
dogs in a chapter, so any of those pronouns (or a name such as 
Fido or Lassie) applies to dogs of either gender unless I indicate 
otherwise.
What You’re Not to Read
I’d be thrilled if you were to read every word of this book, but I 
know better. You’re like me: way too busy, with far too little time 
to accomplish everything on your daily to-do list. Plus, you want to 
know as soon as possible how to keep your floors and furniture 
from becoming a doggie latrine. To help you differentiate between 
what you need to know and what you can do without, I’ve made 
the do-without stuff easy for you to spot. That stuff includes the 
following:
 
✓ Sidebars: These shaded boxes contain anecdotes or interesting 
bits of information that can make housetraining easier and 
more effective, but if you skip them and apply the suggestions 
in the main text, you’ll still have a pooch who knows when and 
where he’s supposed to potty.
 
✓ Text next to the Technical Stuff icon: Information located next 
to this icon is interesting, but it may go into far more detail 
about housetraining than you need for teaching your dog her 
bathroom basics.
 
✓ Legal stuff: Otherwise known as the material on the copyright 
page, the text here is of interest mainly to Wiley’s legal eagles. 
Even if you’re interested in copyright law, I guarantee that you 
can find more information on the subject elsewhere.
Foolish Assumptions
I’ve written this book assuming that one of the following scenarios 
applies to you and your dog:

Housetraining For Dummies, 2nd Edition

✓ You’re about to get a new puppy — or have just gotten one — 
and want to teach her proper potty protocol as quickly and 
effectively as possible.
 
✓ Your puppy or adult dog has never quite mastered that 
protocol, and you want to know how to transform him from 
bathroom bungler to housetraining ace.
 
✓ Your once well-housetrained dog appears to have developed 
some bathroom issues, and you want to know how to solve 
those problems instead of just having to live with them.
If you and your canine companion fit into any of the preceding 
categories, this book is for you.
How This Book Is Organized
This book can give you the full scoop on making the housetraining 
process as hassle-free as possible. If you read any part of 
Housetraining For Dummies, you can gain valuable insights on 
how to teach your puppy or adult dog to do his business where 
and when you want him to. Here’s how I’ve organized the book to 
help you do just that.
Part I: Preparing to Potty 
Train Your Pooch
Before you can housetrain your hound, you need to get yourself 
ready to do so. Therefore, this part explains the basic principles of 
canine learning in general and of housetraining in particular. Here, 
too, is where you get the info you need to decide where you want 
your dog’s bathroom to be: inside or outside your home. You also 
get the lowdown on what equipment you need to teach your dog 
proper potty protocol. Finally, you discover how not only to jump-
start your dog’s housetraining progress but also to give her a leg 
up on lifelong good health by feeding her the right kinds of foods.
Part II: Putting a Plan in Place
Now that you’ve made some basic decisions, gotten a primer on 
housetraining theory, acquired the right housetraining gear, and 
stocked up on gourmet doggie fare, you’re ready to start the 
housetraining process in earnest. Part II tells you all you need to 
know to turn your housetrainee into a housetraining graduate, 
whether you opt for indoor training or choose to have your pooch 

 Introduction

potty in the great outdoors. You also discover some techniques 
that can make managing your dog’s bathroom maneuvers infinitely 
easier and determine when you can consider your hound a true 
housetraining ace.
Part III: Solving Housetraining 
Problems
Alas, even the solidly housetrained dog can acquire potty prob-
lems. Some of those problems require remedial housetraining, 
others may actually be signs of illness, and still others may reflect 
human mistakes, not the dog’s. Part III helps you determine what 
kind of problem your dog really has (and that problem, for some 
dogs, is simply that they’re very small) and what you need to do 
to solve it.
Part IV: The Part of Tens
Part IV is where I introduce some top-ten lists and have even more 
fun discussing housetraining than I do in the preceding three parts. 
In the process, I emphasize some important housetraining princi-
ples. And if, for some reason, you’re wondering whether house-
training is worth the trouble, this part — specifically Chapter 13 — 
gives you the incentive you need to keep plugging away.
Appendix
If you’re interested in getting more information about house-
training and other aspects of dog care, I’ve included an appendix 
full of resources after Chapter 13.
Icons Used in This Book
To make this book simpler to use, I’ve included some icons to help 
you find and fathom key ideas and information.
 
This icon calls attention to time- and hassle-saving ideas or items 
that are especially helpful when housetraining your dog.
 
This icon denotes information that’s so critical to successful 
housetraining that you should read it more than once — just to 
ensure that you remember it as you potty-train your own pooch.

This icon flags dangers to your dog’s well-being. It also lets you 
know when an apparent housetraining problem is really a medical 
problem that demands a veterinarian’s attention.
 
Perhaps you want the full scoop on why dens are such a big part 
of most dogs’ lives or how dogs use their pee to communicate 
with each other. This icon flags such nonessential information for 
you. On the other hand, if you just want to understand the basic 
concepts of housetraining, sidestep this icon and move on.
Where to Go From Here
If you haven’t acquired your dog yet, or if she’s just arrived, 
reading from the very beginning of this book and working your 
way through to the end is best. But if your canine companion 
has been with you for a while, or if you’re just trying to solve 
a particular pooch potty problem, don’t fret. Head to the table of 
contents or to the index, where you can find the topic that can 
help solve your dog’s specific housetraining problems.

M
ax, a 10-week-old Beagle, is delighting his new owner with 
his puppy antics but is dismaying her with his penchant 
for peeing all over her recently installed carpet. No matter how 
recently he tinkled outside, he always seems to have something 
left over with which to tinkle on the floor covering.
Allie, a 6-year-old Golden Retriever, would never pee on anyone’s 
carpet. Her people can count on her to do her business three or 
four times a day: first thing in the morning, early in the afternoon, 
in the late afternoon (sometimes), and in the evening before she 
retires for the night. On the rare occasions that she needs an extra 
bathroom break, she lets her people know by heading to the back 
door and scratching it — or if her tummy is giving her trouble, 
by waking up one of her people to get her outside in time to avoid 
an accident.
Cody, a 3-year-old Chihuahua, can hold his water pretty well — 
sometimes. Other times, though, he seems to suffer from 
bathroom-manners amnesia or a sudden preference for taking 
a whiz any place except where he’s supposed to.

Which of these dogs is housetrained? Which ones aren’t? In this 
chapter, you not only find the answer to those two questions but 
also discover why housetraining plays such an important role in 
whether you and your dog can live happily ever after.
What Housetraining Is — 
and Why It Matters
To know whether your dog is really housetrained, you need to 
understand exactly what housetraining is. Unfortunately, most 
dictionaries aren’t all that helpful here. For example, the Random 
House Dictionary offers a two-word definition: “to housebreak.” 
That doesn’t tell you much — after all, you’re not teaching your 
dog to break anything! The American Heritage Dictionary offers 
the same terse definition, although it does add that the term 
is primarily British.
 
No matter where the term housetraining originates, defining it 
still requires precision and directness. Simply put, housetraining is 
the process in which you teach your dog to eliminate when you 
want him to and where you want him to — and to refrain from 
eliminating at any other time or place.
That definition doesn’t allow much room for errors or lapses. 
And clearly, when measured against those criteria, a dog who 
consistently does his duty outdoors or in a designated indoor area 
is fully housetrained. That’s not the case, though, with a dog 
who usually tinkles outdoors, never tinkles outdoors, or only 
occasionally tinkles outdoors (or performs with similar levels of 
consistency in a predetermined indoor Bowser bathroom). 
Housetraining is one of those all-or-nothing cases. That being the 
case, Allie is the only dog in the chapter intro who you can con-
sider truly housetrained.
Why does such precision matter? Simple: An otherwise well-
behaved, healthy dog who doesn’t know proper pooch 
potty protocol is much more likely to lose her home than a 
similar dog who knows her bathroom basics. No human being 
likes to have his home turned into a multiroom canine toilet — 
and if such a human can’t teach his dog to take her bathroom 
business elsewhere, that dog is likely to find herself going 
elsewhere.

 Chapter 1: Understanding Housetraining Basics 11
Why Your Dog Can’t Be “a Little 
Bit Housetrained”
Housetraining is an either-or proposition: Either a dog is house-
trained, or she isn’t. To say that a dog is “partially trained” or “a 
little bit housetrained” is like saying that a woman is “partially 
pregnant” or “a little bit pregnant.” None of those terms compute.
 
If you consider your dog to be “a little bit housetrained,” you’re 
really saying that he hasn’t completely learned proper bathroom 
manners yet. That means you can’t really rely on him to go to the 
bathroom only where and when you want him to.
Until your dog is totally housetrained, you always face the chance 
that Lassie will decide to use your brand new area rug as her 
toilet or that Laddie will choose to anoint your mother-in-law’s 
prized Chippendale chair. And of course, for some dogs, especially 
puppies, those chances are way better than even. That’s certainly 
the case with Max, the young Beagle from the chapter intro who’s 
been using that new carpet as his own personal potty.
But owners of adult dogs like Cody, the Chihuahua who’s occasion-
ally leaving unwelcome puddles throughout his owner’s abode, 
also cope with unreliable canines. Cody appears to have forgotten 
the lessons in bathroom manners his owners taught him years 
ago — or perhaps he never quite understood those lessons in the 
first place. Chapter 9 describes typical cases of pooches who 
appear to have forgotten the fine art of proper canine bathroom 
behavior. Or maybe Cody doesn’t feel well. Chapter 10 focuses on 
why a pooch may pee or poop inappropriately — and what owners 
can do to solve such problems.
But for now, it’s fair to say that although housetraining is an 
either-or proposition, there’s definitely more than one way to 
teach a dog proper potty behavior. Before you start, though, you 
need to get yourself and your household ready for the task. 
Chapter 2 helps you prepare by giving you a primer on canine 
instincts and on how to capitalize on those instincts to help 
your dog become a happy housetrainee. Chapter 3 focuses on 
equipping you, your home, and your dog to ensure housetraining 
success. And Chapter 4 hones in on a crucial component of the 
housetraining process: food. After all, what goes in your dog must 
eventually come out, in one form or another!

Exploring Housetraining Methods
Most people who choose to live with dogs want to be able 
to regulate their canines’ bathroom deportment. They want 
their dogs to poop and pee where and when they (the people) 
choose.
Fortunately, you can choose between two methods designed to 
help you achieve this goal. The right choice for you and your dog 
depends on many factors, some of which relate less to your dog’s 
needs than to your way of living. In this section, I discuss indoor 
and outdoor training and talk about some of the lifestyle issues 
that may help you choose one method over another.
Location, location, location: Outdoor 
versus indoor training
The two housetraining methods I discuss in this book are all about 
location — as in where you want your pooch to potty: indoors or 
outdoors.
Outdoor training
If the idea of turning part of your house into a canine bathroom 
doesn’t thrill you, you’re far from alone. That same lack of 
enthusiasm is probably the primary reason that millions of dog 
owners train their four-legged friends to do their bathroom 
business outside. Outdoor training involves teaching a dog to 
eliminate in a potty area located outside your home. The potty 
area can be a designated spot in your backyard or wherever you 
allow your dog to do his business.
Outdoor training has plenty of advantages. First and foremost, as 
soon as your dog knows what he’s supposed to do and where he’s 
supposed to do it, you never again need to worry about canine 
waste marring your floors, staining your carpets, or otherwise 
stinking up your house. You also have more floor space to use and 
enjoy, because you don’t have any newspapers, litter boxes, or 
other indoor canine bathroom paraphernalia to get in the way of 
household foot traffic. Finally, those who choose to walk their dogs 
outdoors can get some healthful, enjoyable exercise as well as 
some special bonding time with their canine companions. If these 
advantages appeal to you, head over to Chapter 6, which gives you 
the straight scoop on teaching your pooch to potty outside.

 Chapter 1: Understanding Housetraining Basics 13
But outdoor training carries some disadvantages, too — just ask 
anyone who’s had to go outside with his pooch on a cold or rainy 
night. Fortunately, a little extra training can go a long way toward 
alleviating the problem of the pooch who takes too long to do his 
business during bad weather. Chapter 8 offers ideas on how to 
teach your dog to become a proactive housetraining graduate and 
provides some hints on how to help your housetrainee expedite 
his excretions.
 
Don’t think that letting your pooch potty in your yard relieves you 
of the obligation to clean up those deposits. Unless you like having 
bright yellow patches in the middle of your green grass (a problem 
I address in Chapter 3) or stepping in the other stuff — because 
that stuff generally doesn’t degrade fast enough for you to totally 
avoid such missteps — plan on cleaning up after your four-legged 
friend even if his potty is on your property.
Indoor training
Indoor training involves teaching a dog to eliminate in a potty area 
located inside your home. The potty area can be some newspapers 
spread on the floor in one room, a litter box tucked discreetly 
into a corner, or some other device located in a designated area 
of your abode.
A dog who’s indoor-trained makes a beeline for that indoor 
location whenever he feels the urge to eliminate. As soon as he’s 
finished, cleanup is easy: You just flush the poop down the toilet 
and either throw away or clean the surface upon which the poop 
or pee landed.
 
Indoor training is a viable housetraining option if, for some reason, 
taking your dog outside to eliminate isn’t practical. It’s also worth 
trying if your adult dog and his waste byproducts are very small.
But indoor training carries some disadvantages. It’s impractical if 
your dog is much bigger than toy-sized (consider how big that 
waste is likely to be). Moreover, if your canine companion is male, 
sooner or later he’ll probably starting lifting his leg when he pees. 
When that happens, his ability to aim accurately may decline. 
Instead of hitting the litter box, newspaper, or other toilet, he may 
leave a stinky puddle on your floor.
Either way, if you decide that indoor training is right for you 
and your dog, mosey on over the Chapter 7. There, you get the 
lowdown on how to get your four-legged friend to squat down in 
the proper indoor location.

Looking at lifestyle factors to 
help you choose your method
How do you decide which housetraining method works best for 
you? The right answer depends as much on your way of living as it 
does on your dog’s needs.
Maybe you’re one of those lucky people who not only work from 
home during the day but also have some nice outdoor places to 
walk to. For you, walking a dog can be a real pleasure — and at 
times even a sanity saver. A housetraining method that takes you 
and your dog outdoors is probably an attractive option.
Perhaps, though, you’re an elderly person or a mobility-impaired 
individual who can’t get out and around easily. The dog walk that’s 
pure pleasure for your work-at-home neighbor may be pure torture 
for you. If this description fits you, the ideal housetraining method 
probably means never having to leave the house. Indoor training 
may be a better choice.
Or perhaps you live in a high-rise apartment building in the middle 
of the city. When your canine companion needs a potty break, you 
can’t just snap on the leash, open the front door, and head out for 
a quick stroll or a trip to a designated doggie toilet area. Instead, 
your route to the great outdoors may require you and your dog to 
walk to the opposite end of a long hallway, wait for the elevator 
to stop at your floor, ride down to your building lobby on the
 elevator, and finally get yourselves to the proper spot outside. 
And all this time, your dog is expected to hold her water. If you 
and your dog face such obstacles en route to an outdoor bathroom, 
you may also want to consider keeping her potty indoors.
Those are just a few examples of how your lifestyle can affect the 
housetraining method you select for your four-legged friend. No 
matter which method you choose, this book gives you detailed 
instructions on how to housetrain your dog.
Surviving Setbacks and 
Special Situations
Although housetraining is generally a straightforward process, 
chances are you’ll encounter setbacks during the training period. 
And even when your four-legged friend becomes a housetraining 
graduate, he’s bound to do some occasional backsliding. In any 

 Chapter 1: Understanding Housetraining Basics 15
case, you’ll likely see situations in which your consistently 
rock-solid housetrainee suddenly seems to lose his edge, and 
neither you nor he knows why.
For setbacks during the housetraining period, Chapters 6 and 7 
offer guides for troubleshooting bathroom errors. In those 
chapters, you find questions that can help you determine the 
mistakes you made that led to that unauthorized puddle or pile 
(and yes, during this period, generally any doggie accidents 
result from your mistakes).
Post-housetraining backsliding can be a little more complicated, 
but here, too, help is at hand. Although every dog is an individual, 
almost every healthy housetraining-challenged dog fits one of 
ten broad profiles. Chapter 9 describes these profiles in detail and 
outlines options so you can either help your dog overcome her 
housetraining challenges or, in a few cases, live with your dog and 
her disabilities.
That said, a lot of apparently housetraining-challenged dogs really 
don’t have bathroom issues at all: Instead, they’re feeling under 
the weather. Some of the maladies that result in doggie bathroom 
lapses are minor, and others aren’t. Chapter 10 lists some of the 
most common bathroom-related symptoms, suggests possible 
causes of those symptoms, and recommends steps to take.
Understanding the Role You 
and Your Family Play
Most dog trainers say that the most important part of their 
jobs isn’t training dogs — it’s training the humans to train the 
dogs. In Chapter 12, you discover the ten most common human 
housetraining hang-ups and how to prevent them.
You and the other humans in your life play crucial roles in your 
dog’s housetraining progress and ultimate success (or lack 
thereof). Not only do you teach your dog the ins and outs of 
proper potty protocol, but you also create the conditions that 
can make or break a housetraining program. For one thing, house-
training needs to be a family affair. Here’s why:
 
✓ To keep the diet consistent: No matter how diligently you’re 
trying to regulate Sparky’s bathroom urges by regulating the 
kind and amount of food you feed him, such diligence is all for 
naught if your partner or child is sneaking the dog snacks all 
the while.

Part I: Preparing to Potty Train Your Pooch 
16
 
✓ To help you avoid burnout: Housetraining can be pretty 
simple, but it can also be pretty tedious when just one person 
is doing the day-in, day-out routine of feeding, walking, and 
confining the housetrainee.
Chapter 11 helps you get all the humans in your household, 
including the kids, on the same page so you can all housetrain 
Sparky together.
But maybe getting your family on board isn’t your problem. Maybe 
you’re trying to deal with housetraining a dog while working away 
from home all day. Even well into the 21st century, corporate 
America still isn’t all that great about accommodating the needs of 
employees’ family members, whether those members are human 
or canine. Chapter 11 offers suggestions on how to give your 
housetrainee some daytime relief and still keep your job.
The same chapter also covers coping strategies for other special 
situations, such as traveling with a dog you’re trying to housetrain 
or even just providing for the bathroom needs of a housetraining 
graduate while you’re on the road.
 
Your dog or puppy has all the instincts and desire he needs to 
motivate him to acquire good bathroom manners — he just needs 
you to get him going. Do the job right, and not only will your dog 
become a housetraining ace, but the two of you will build a bond 
that goes the distance for years to come.

B
efore a person can teach any subject, he or she has to 
know not only the subject itself but also how to convey that 
information to a student. That’s just as true for housetraining 
as it is for any other topic. For your puppy or dog to learn basic 
bathroom manners, you need to teach him those manners in a 
way he can understand.
That said, your four-legged friend brings plenty of positive attri-
butes to the housetraining process: a strong instinct to seek out a 
den, an equally strong instinct to keep that den clean, an ability to 
learn through repetition, and a desire to score rewards. But it’s up 
to you to capitalize on those attributes and develop an approach 
to housetraining that enables him to get the hang of proper potty 
protocol with minimum stress on him — and on you.
A lot of what I talk about in this chapter may seem to range far 
afield from the task at hand: teaching your dog where and when to 
eliminate. But nothing could be further from the truth, because 
housetraining is probably one of the first lessons — if not the first 
lesson — you’ll try to teach your dog.
 
The way you try to show your dog proper potty protocol lays the 
foundation for your efforts to teach him other maneuvers, such as 
coming when called, sitting when told to, and walking nicely while 
leashed. What you do now, in this most basic of lessons, can set 
the tone for your relationship with your dog in the years ahead. 
For that reason alone, it’s worth taking the time to do the job well.

Leaving Behind Housetraining 
Methods of Yesteryear
Housetraining a dog doesn’t have to be difficult. But a generation 
ago, not many people realized that. At best, housetraining was a 
difficult undertaking; at worst, it was a total failure. Unfortunately, 
failures occurred all too often.
Here’s what may have been behind these failures. Mom (she was 
the one who usually got stuck with the housetraining task) would 
see a puddle or pile of poop on the floor. She’d freak — naturally, 
the little deposit would be gracing a just-mopped kitchen floor or 
freshly shampooed living room carpet — and go on the warpath to 
find the canine culprit. When she found him, she’d grab the culprit 
by the collar, drag him over to the puddle or pile, and yell, “Bad 
dog!” at him. Maybe she’d swat him with a rolled-up newspaper. 
She may even have rubbed his nose in the object of his offense. 
The terrified pooch would then creep away, and things would 
settle down, at least temporarily.
Maybe the dog would eventually figure out what Mom was trying 
to tell him. Often, though, he wouldn’t. And so the dog would soon 
have another accident, and the whole miserable cycle would begin 
again. Still, the dog was learning something: He learned that he 
should avoid the rolled-up newspaper at all costs. He also learned 
that he should avoid screaming moms.
Most of the problems people had with potty training their dogs 
weren’t the dogs’ faults; they were the people’s faults. People knew 
very little about the canine instincts that make housetraining and 
other training easier. They knew only that they didn’t want their 
dogs to do their business inside the house.
Since then, dog trainers and owners alike have discovered a lot 
about how dogs learn. And you can use that knowledge to make 
housetraining a much easier process than when your mother was 
trying to do the job.
Using Your Pooch’s Instincts 
to Lay a Foundation
When housetraining your pooch, you’re not working with a blank 
slate. Your canine companion probably learned a lot about bath-
room behavior before you ever met her — whether she came to 
you as a puppy or as an adult dog. And a lot of what she knows 

 Chapter 2: Training the Housetrainer: Taking the Right Approach 19
comes from her instincts: those feelings, drives, and desires that 
have been with your dog since the moment she was born. They’re 
hard-wired into her very being. No one taught her the behaviors 
that result from these impulses; they just came naturally.
The places where your dog chooses to sleep, her tendency to 
hoard things, her love of licking your face, her delight in fetching 
objects — these and countless other actions and reactions may all 
be inborn. And although some of these instincts don’t affect her 
ability to be housetrained, others do. After you find out about 
some of these inborn impulses, you can begin to direct them in 
ways that help your dog learn to do what you want her to do. Your 
dog’s instincts help her pick up not only potty deportment but also 
just about anything else you want your dog to know.
The training your dog 
has already had
You can housetrain almost any dog, but the challenges of teaching 
a puppy to go potty may differ from those you encounter when you 
try to teach the same maneuvers to an adult dog. Some of that has 
to do with the kind of nurturing and training the dog has already 
received.
The wee ones: Preliminary training and physical limits
All a healthy puppy usually needs to become housetrained is some 
time to grow and to develop some self-control — and of course, 
some guidance from you in the meantime.
If you got your puppy from a reputable breeder, Fifi may already 
know the rudiments of proper potty behavior. After all, the 
well-bred pup has had lots of opportunities to learn about keeping 
clean and getting along with other dogs (and people) — both of 
which are important prehousetraining skills. A puppy who has 
nailed those basics is easier to teach than one who lacks such 
knowledge.
Many breeders go even further. They take their puppies outside 
every morning and after meals, and they praise the little pups 
when they eliminate. If your puppy’s breeder did that (ask when 
you’re interviewing prospective breeders), he or she already did 
some of your dog’s housetraining for you. The same may be true of 
a dog you adopt from a shelter, rescue group, or individual.
But even if your new puppy aced those preliminary lessons, one 
crucial lesson she’s only just starting to learn is the lesson of self-
control. To put it simply, your little pup just can’t hold it — at least 

Part I: Preparing to Potty Train Your Pooch 
20
not for very long. A puppy younger than 4 months doesn’t have a 
big enough bladder or sufficient muscle control to go more than 
a couple of hours without eliminating. As she gets older, a pup’s 
ability to control herself gradually increases. By the time she 
reaches adulthood at about 1 year of age, a healthy dog usually 
has plenty of self-control. In fact, some adult dogs can hold it for a 
very long time.
Grown-up pooches: Unlearning bad habits
Even an adult dog who appears to have an iron bladder isn’t 
necessarily housetrained. The fact that she can hold it doesn’t 
necessarily mean that she will hold it. An adult dog may be 
burdened with mental baggage or just plain bad habits that can 
create additional obstacles to housetraining.
For example, if you adopted your young adult dog from an animal 
shelter, her previous owners may not have bothered to housetrain 
her — or if they did, they may have done a poor job. Either way, 
her failure to master proper potty deportment may well have been 
what landed her in the shelter in the first place.
Some shelter and rescue dogs have behavioral problems that 
manifest themselves as inappropriate elimination — for example, a 
shy dog may roll over and pee whenever someone stands above 
her and looks directly at her. Even a dog who’s been a model of 
proper bathroom behavior at one point in her life can later appear 
to forget what she’s been taught.
Not surprisingly, then, housetraining an adult dog is often less 
straightforward than housetraining a puppy. The grown-up pooch 
who has less-than-stellar bathroom manners often needs to 
unlearn some bad but well-entrenched habits before learning new 
ones. The person who lives with such a dog may need to develop 
his detective skills and figure out why his canine companion keeps 
making bathroom mistakes.
In any case, though, when you know something about your canine 
friend’s instincts and impulses, you have a leg up on your efforts to 
housetrain her.
Learning from his mom
Even while he’s still with his litter, a puppy is learning a lot about 
life as a dog. From his littermates, he learns not to bite too hard 
(if he bites at all) and how to jockey for position among his 
brothers and sisters at feeding time. And he learns a lot about 
proper bathroom behavior, too.

 Chapter 2: Training the Housetrainer: Taking the Right Approach 21
Puppies can start learning elimination etiquette from the time 
they’re about 3 or 4 weeks old or in some cases, even earlier. 
Generally, their bathroom manners start kicking in when they have 
sufficient motor skills to start wandering around the whelping 
box where they’ve been living with their mom and perhaps outside 
the box, too.
The mama dog takes advantage of this ability. When the pups 
indicate they’re about to go potty, she may use her nose to push 
them outside the box if they haven’t already gotten themselves out 
of there. Doing so keeps their poop and pee from stinking up the 
doggie domicile. If the mama dog and puppies are lucky enough to 
be residing in the home of a good breeder, several layers of news-
paper will be at the other end of the box or other quarters for the 
puppies to eliminate on. After the puppies eliminate on the news-
paper that the breeder placed on the floor for just that purpose, 
she whisks the soiled papers away and replaces them with fresh 
ones. Those are ways a breeder reinforces the mama dog’s efforts.
By 7 or 8 weeks of age, most puppies have developed enough 
control to master this first bathroom lesson. They have to poop 
and pee every couple of hours or so, but they’ve learned to listen 
How long can a dog hold it?
Some dogs appear to have bladders made of iron. My late, great Sheltie, Cory, was 
one such canine. When the weather was bad, he slapped his floodgates shut. His 
personal best was a whopping 23 hours, even though my family and I gave him 
ample opportunity to unload during that time period.
Still, just because your dog has an iron bladder doesn’t mean you should put it to 
the test. Here are some guidelines:
 ✓ Most experts say a dog needs a chance to pee at least every eight to ten 
hours.
 ✓ For puppies, the standard guideline is that they can hold it for the number of 
months they’ve lived plus one. In other words, your 3-month-old youngster can 
hold it for about four hours, max. But for many puppies of that age, even four 
hours is pushing their anatomical limits; they may need trips every three hours 
or even every two hours for a while. My current canine companion, Allie the 
Golden Retriever, was one such puppy.
 ✓ Very small puppies, such as toy breeds, often need hourly potty breaks when 
they’re under 4 months of age simply because their bladders are so small.
Chapters 6 and 7 address scheduling potty breaks in detail.

to their bodies, and they can tell when they need to go. When they 
get those urges, they try to scurry away from their den before 
giving in to that compulsion to squat. This effort to eliminate away 
from the den signals that a puppy is ready to begin learning the 
rudiments of housetraining.
Denning dynamics
The lessons a puppy learns about keeping clean go way beyond 
what her mom makes her do (see the preceding section). The nest 
that a dog’s mother teaches her to help keep clean is really her 
first den — and dens are a big deal in the lives of most dogs.
 
For a dog, the den is simply an area that she can call her own. 
Generally, it’s a small place that’s at least somewhat enclosed on 
two or three sides but is also open on at least one side. The area 
may be dark, but it doesn’t have to be. What it does have to be is a 
place where the dog feels safe and secure.
Unlike her wolf ancestors, the domestic dog doesn’t need a den to 
ensure her physical survival, but her urge to find a den is still very 
strong (see Figure 2-1). My Golden Retriever office-mate, Allie, is a 
case in point — see the nearby sidebar titled “The under-dog: 
Improvising dens.”
Figure 2-1: Dogs can find dens in unexpected places.

 Chapter 2: Training the Housetrainer: Taking the Right Approach 23
Cleanliness is next to dog-liness
So-called dog people — humans who are enamored of anything 
and everything remotely canine — like to say that the word God is 
really dog spelled backward. They may espouse the motto of a mag-
azine called The Bark: “Dog is my co-pilot.” These dog people aren’t 
being blasphemous. But their juxtaposition of God and dog has 
interesting implications for housetraining. Although many people 
believe that “cleanliness is next to godliness,” most dogs instinc-
tively adhere to the notion that cleanliness is next to dog-liness. In 
other words, dogs instinctively want to keep themselves clean.
Sometimes a dog’s definition of cleanliness differs slightly from 
yours. You probably don’t like the idea of Fido’s splashing in a 
mud puddle, but Fido may not mind the mud at all. In terms 
of peeing and pooping, though, Fido and most of his canine compa-
triots draw the line between dirt and cleanliness — and they draw 
that line right smack in front of their dens.
Instinctively, a normal, healthy dog will do just about anything to 
avoid having to use his den as a toilet area. The last thing he wants 
to do is deposit his bodily waste anywhere near his cherished 
domicile. You can make that impulse work in your favor as you 
housetrain your dog. The impulse to keep the den clean is the 
cornerstone to teaching dogs to poop and pee only where and 
when you want them to. The drive to use a den and the drive 
to avoid soiling that den form the basis of easy, effective house-
training using a crate.
The under-dog: Improvising dens
My Golden Retriever Allie is using one of her dens right now. While I’ve been typing 
this chapter at the computer atop my desk, she came into my office and crept under 
that desk. She’s now lying at my feet, protected on two sides by the walls of my 
office and on a third side by a part of the desk. My legs provide a kind of doorway 
that hides her from the view of others who come into the room. However, she still 
has a clear view of anyone else who comes in.
The desk isn’t the only den available to Allie, though. She also enjoys napping under 
other tables in the house while my family and I are nearby. And sometimes, while 
the rest of our family is watching TV, my Golden girl spends some time in the dog 
crate she’s had since she was a puppy. She also makes a beeline for the crate 
whenever she sees me wielding the vacuum cleaner, against which she appears 
to harbor some apprehensions. Inside that crate, Allie waits calmly, knowing that 
she’s safe and secure, while I wage another battle in my never-ending war against 
dust bunnies.

Life without guilt
Suppose that your dog makes a mistake. Say that she anoints your 
freshly mopped kitchen floor or leaves a little pile of poop in the 
foyer. Do you think she feels bad about it? Do you think she’s 
overcome with remorse? Do you think she even remembers she’s 
done a dirty deed within five minutes of committing the act? The 
answers to those questions are no, no, and no. Guilt and remorse 
aren’t in your dog’s emotional repertoire.
“Now, wait a minute,” you say. “When I come home at night from 
work and see that Fido’s peed on the rug, he sure looks to me as 
though he’s feeling guilty. And when I start yelling at him, his ears 
go back, his tail goes between his legs, and he kind of cringes. He 
knows he’s done something wrong.”
Fido knows something all right — but that something isn’t any 
realization that he’s messed up big time. What he does know is 
that you’re angry. If you’re yelling his name, he also figures out 
pretty quickly that you’re angry at him. But he doesn’t have a clue 
as to why you’re so upset; he’s long since forgotten about his little 
rug-christening party. All he knows is that you’re mad at him, and 
he’s scared of you. Under such circumstances, he takes what looks 
to him like two prudent courses of action: literally making himself 
smaller (that’s why he cringes) and beating a hasty retreat.
Does he understand that you don’t want him to have any more 
accidents in the house? Nope. Does he realize that if he didn’t have 
any accidents, you wouldn’t become angry? No, again. He’s just 
doing everything he can to minimize your wrath and, when that 
fails, to get away from that wrath — and from you.
 
Your dog lives a life that’s completely free of guilt. He doesn’t 
connect one of his long-ago actions with the angry outburst 
you’re having now, which is why yelling at your dog after the fact 
doesn’t teach him anything except to be afraid of you. Time, 
patience, and consistency are much more likely to get you the 
results you seek.
Learning by repetition
Your dog’s inability to remember past mistakes doesn’t mean that 
she can’t make connections. On the contrary, she’s very good at 
linking cause and effect. You can use that linking ability to teach 
her proper bathroom behavior or just about anything else you 
want her to know. How? Behold the power of repetition.

 Chapter 2: Training the Housetrainer: Taking the Right Approach 25
In fact, many times your dog learns something that you didn’t 
plan to teach her. For example, my Golden Retriever, Allie, knows 
when I’m about to leave the house — and in response to my near 
departure, she often heads down to her crate on her own. Figuring 
out how she knew when I was leaving took me a while, but then I 
realized that I perform the same sequence of actions every time I 
leave the house: I put on some lipstick, pick up my purse, and get 
out my car keys. That sequence sends Allie to her crate.
Although repetition is the key to teaching your dog what you want 
her to know, you can do less repeating when you provide her with 
some sort of incentive for doing the right thing. Find out more 
about this positive approach in the later section titled “Rewarding 
the good, ignoring the goofs.”
The need for attachment
Ever see a litter of young puppies? They tumble over each other 
constantly and seem to be touching each other all the time. Rarely 
do you see one puppy consistently go off by himself. Puppies need 
each other for warmth and companionship; they thrive in each 
other’s company.
But perhaps when you welcomed home your new puppy or dog, 
you made the mistake of having him sleep by himself in the 
kitchen or basement. If so, you undoubtedly experienced a 
night full of heart-rending wails, yips, and howls. Your canine 
companion didn’t like being alone, away from his littermates or 
the companions of his previous home. Being away from you made 
those already bad feelings seem even worse.
And of course, you know about the neighborhood dog whose 
owner leaves him alone in the backyard all day, every day, and 
who barks his head off — much to the annoyance of those who live 
nearby. Why does he do it? Boredom is one reason. Loneliness is 
another.
 
Dogs are social animals. When they have a chance to choose 
between being alone and being with another individual, they 
generally choose the latter.
What does this need for company have to do with housetraining? 
Plenty. Not only does your dog’s desire to be with you help build 
a precious bond between the two of you, but it also helps you 
keep track of where he is and what he’s doing during the house-
training process. No matter how you look at it, your dog’s instinc-
tive desire to be close to you is something you can use as part of 
his housetraining — and any other training, for that matter.

How instincts can be thwarted
Instincts play a big role in how quickly your dog masters the art of 
housetraining. Many puppies learn basic cleanliness and social 
skills — two important prehousetraining accomplishments — from 
their mothers and littermates. But what if, for some reason, a 
puppy doesn’t pick up those lessons in the first few weeks of her 
life? And how can that happen? One answer to how that happens is 
just two words: puppy mills.
Puppy mills: Inhibiting instincts
Puppy mills are substandard breeding operations in which female 
dogs are forced to mate as often as possible. Breeders raise 
mother and pups in deplorable conditions: I’m talking tiny cages in 
which these poor animals barely have enough room to turn 
around. They also often have to live knee-deep in their own poop 
and pee.
 
Having to live in her own filth is a surefire way to short-circuit a 
dog’s instinctive drive to do her bathroom business away from her 
den. She can’t get away from her den. And especially if she’s a 
puppy, she can’t hold it forever. Sooner or later, she has to go, and 
if the den is the only place where she can eliminate, that’s where 
she does so. Eventually, she learns to deal with it.
What does this kind of situation mean for housetraining? Simple: 
A puppy-mill dog may take quite a while to recover her instinct to 
potty away from her den. And until she does, housetraining will 
be extremely difficult for everyone involved. This doesn’t mean 
that a puppy-mill pooch can’t be housetrained. Plenty of people 
have persevered until their canine companions finally understood 
where and when they were supposed to potty. But getting to that 
point takes lots of time and even more patience.
Unfortunately, many people lack such patience. When such 
patience is absent, life with their puppy-mill potty delinquents may 
veer off in one of two directions. Either the owners put up with a 
dog they say is “partially housetrained” (which really means the 
dog isn’t housetrained at all), or the owners decide that they can’t 
tolerate the stains, smells, and aggravation of a dog who can’t 
learn basic bathroom manners. In turn, they either relegate the 
dog to remote areas of the house or, worse, get rid of the dog. Any 
way you look at it, the outcome is unhappy for all concerned.
Clearly, avoiding such problems in the first place is a good idea. 
How? By not buying a puppy or dog who comes from a puppy mill. 
A large number of these pooches end up in retail pet stores, such 
as those located in shopping malls. Others are sold by dealers who 
pose as breeders and advertise online or through print classifieds. 

 Chapter 2: Training the Housetrainer: Taking the Right Approach 27
You can evaluate a breeder by visiting the premises, asking to see 
the mama dog, and using the guidelines in the nearby “What is a 
reputable breeder?” sidebar.
 
Many pet stores have stopped selling puppies themselves and 
instead hold adoption events to allow shelters and rescue 
groups to showcase the puppies and dogs who need new homes. 
Such stores clearly indicate that they’re holding such events, and 
personnel from the shelter or rescue group are there to talk with 
you about the animals up for adoption. If that’s the case with the 
pet store you’re considering, assess the puppies and dogs up for 
adoption, and know that in doing so you may be saving a life. If you 
can’t tell whether the store is selling puppies or is just giving a 
shelter or rescue group a place to display the animals in their care, 
think two, three, four, or more times before acquiring a puppy 
from that store.
Did you already buy a pet-store puppy that likely came from a 
puppy mill? Don’t despair. Housetraining her may be difficult but 
certainly not impossible. See Chapter 5 for more information.
What is a reputable breeder?
Just what makes a breeder reputable? Here are a few clues to look for:
 ✓ She’s an expert in her breed. I’m not just talking cursory knowledge here; I’m 
talking someone who knows more about the history of Boxers or the genetic 
problems of Collies than you could ever imagine. (And if a breeder says her 
breed doesn’t have any such problems, run, don’t walk, out her door.)
 ✓ She raises only a few litters a year. More than that, and you have the makings 
of a factory breeding operation — in other words, a puppy mill.
 ✓ She keeps her facilities scrupulously clean. A clean puppy living area ups the 
odds of dogs and puppies staying healthy — not to mention it encourages the 
proper development of puppy instincts for a clean den.
 ✓ She asks you lots of questions. A good breeder cares enough about her pup-
pies to make sure they go to the best possible homes.
 ✓ She waits until her puppies are 7 to 9 weeks of age before she lets them go to 
new homes. By that time, the pups have learned some basic canine manners 
from their mama and have developed enough control to begin housetraining 
lessons in earnest.
 ✓ She gives her puppies lots of love and handling and makes sure that they spend 
time with other people of all ages and both sexes. If a breeder raises her pup-
pies in her family room or kitchen, you’re on the right track. If she keeps the 
pups in an outdoor kennel, walk away.

Animal shelters and rescue groups: Lacking socialization?
Suppose that you’ve opted for an older dog or a mixed breed 
from a shelter or rescue group. Will such a dog pose special 
housetraining challenges? That question has no single answer.
Lots of dogs from animal shelters and rescue groups do just fine with 
housetraining. In fact, quite a few of them have mastered basic bath-
room behavior before you even bring them home. Some, though, may 
not have done so. And some may be poorly socialized — in other 
words, they lack the exposure to everyday sights, sounds, and people 
that enables them to become emotionally well-adjusted animals. This 
poor socialization may make it tougher for such a dog to become 
bonded to you and may also make it tougher for you to help him 
unlearn some bad bathroom habits.
This certainly doesn’t mean that the dog you adopt from a shelter 
or a rescue group can’t be housetrained. What may be the case, 
though, is that the task will be a bit more of a challenge than you 
expected. You’ll get a leg up on that challenge, however, if you find 
out as much as you can about your dog’s background before you 
bring him home and start teaching him basic bathroom etiquette. 
Chapter 11 offers more information on how to housetrain the 
shelter or rescue dog.
Taking the 21st-Century Approach 
to Housetraining
Today, more people understand that to get what they want from 
their dogs, they first have to tune in to what their dogs want. 
People have discovered a lot about how dogs think, feel, and learn. 
They now know that most dogs don’t want to poop or pee any-
where near where they sleep and eat. They understand that every 
canine likes to have a den to call his own. They realize that dogs 
don’t remember what they’ve done within a few minutes of having 
done it. Consistency, patience, and repetition are what you need 
to teach your dog what you want him to know.
Such knowledge enables you to develop a training approach that 
helps you help your dog express his instincts in ways that are 
acceptable to you. In other words, you can train your dog not only 
to do what you want but to do what he wants, too. After you know 
what your dog can bring to the housetraining process, you have 
to realize what you need to bring to that same enterprise. This 
section covers some of the qualities that can help you be the best 
teacher your dog will ever have.

 Chapter 2: Training the Housetrainer: Taking the Right Approach 29
Seeing your dog’s point of view
Any communications theorist, corporate trainer, or psychologist 
will tell you that to persuade someone to do what you want, you 
have to put yourself in his shoes. You need to imagine his thoughts 
and figure out what makes him tick.
 
Empathy is just as important when you’re trying to reach a dog as 
when you’re trying to persuade a person. You need to understand 
the way your dog views the world and relates to it. In terms of 
housetraining or any other teaching, you’ll be miles ahead of the 
game if you can think like a dog.
When you think like a dog, you realize that
 
✓ Disciplining your dog after she’s done something wrong 
doesn’t do any good, because she has no idea what that 
something-wrong is.
 
✓ For many dogs, peeing is much more than an act of elimina-
tion — it’s a way to communicate with other canines.
 
✓ The shy little darling who rolls onto her back and dribbles 
a bit of urine when you come home hasn’t mislaid her 
bathroom manners. Instead, she’s paying homage to you, 
doggie-style.
 
✓ When you’re out walking with your four-legged friend at night 
and she stops suddenly in the middle of the sidewalk, she’s 
not being stubborn; more likely, she sees something that 
scares her. To you, it’s just another garbage can, but to her, 
it’s big and bad and dark and menacing. After you realize what 
she’s feeling and thinking, you can coax her past the object 
in question instead of yanking on her leash and dragging 
her to you.
 
You can’t succeed with housetraining — or any type of dog 
training — by shoving your wishes down your dog’s throat and 
expecting her to swallow them. Force isn’t effective; it pits the 
two of you against each other. Instead, you and your canine com-
panion should be on the same side. You should have a common 
goal: figuring out how to live happily together.
Being benevolent
A lot of dog-training literature, not to mention amateur trainers or 
people who think they know the scoop, tell you that dominance 
and leadership are the keys to training success. “Show your dog 
who’s boss,” they say. “Don’t let him get away with anything.”

Part I: Preparing to Potty Train Your Pooch 
30
Some even recommend that you punish a transgressing dog by 
grabbing him by the scruff of the neck and rolling him over onto 
his back (alpha rolls) or by hanging him by his collar. Still others 
advocate that the best way to deal with a fearful dog is to help him 
face his fear. And many advocate the use of choke chains and 
prong collars to bring a disobedient dog into line. You won’t see 
any such advocacy here.
 
At times, a dog owner does need to be a leader. But even at such 
times, you can be a benevolent leader: the giver of all good things, 
the source of all things fun, the refuge in times of fear. Such a 
leader thinks not in terms of dominance and submission but in 
terms of benevolence and cooperation. You can be your dog’s best 
teacher, but you can also be his best friend — and dominance 
never needs to be a part of your vocabulary.
Working with your dog’s instincts
All my life, I’ve had curly hair. When I was younger and straight 
hair was the thing, I plastered all kinds of goop on it, blew and 
baked it dry and straight, and otherwise just fought Mother Nature. 
I rarely got the results I wanted — and when I did, Mother Nature 
invariably found a way to spoil them in the form of rain or simply 
some high humidity. Then I wised up. I cut my hair super short 
and let it do its thing. I still use some goop to give it the shine and 
texture I like, but I don’t blow it dry. I wash it, finger-comb it, and 
go. What, you may ask, does this have to do with housetraining a 
dog? Everything. Really.
Just as I became a lot happier with my hair after I started working 
with its natural tendencies, so can you housetrain your puppy or 
dog faster when you work with hers. Her need for a den, her desire 
to keep that den clean, and her ability to learn through consistency 
and repetition can all help her become a housetraining ace much 
faster than she did back in the day when all Mom had to work with 
was a rolled-up newspaper and a boatload of totally understand-
able frustration. You just have to use your dog’s instincts to your 
advantage. But then, that’s why you’re reading this book.
Creating a schedule
I admit it: About some things in life, dog-related and not, I can be a 
total fanatic. Creating a schedule for the canine housetrainee is 
one of those things. Why? Because, quite simply, having a schedule 
is a great way to reduce the time it takes your dog to get the hang 
of housetraining. The training process becomes a whole lot easier 
when you feed your dog, play with him, and let him eliminate at 
the same times every single day.

 Chapter 2: Training the Housetrainer: Taking the Right Approach 31
A schedule plays right into your dog’s need for repetition, consis-
tency, and predictability. A schedule also makes it a whole lot 
easier for you to anticipate when your dog needs to pee and poop 
and then to get him to the right place before he has an accident.
There’s no one-schedule-fits-all timetable. You need to put 
together a regimen that fits your dog’s age, his degree of house-
training prowess, and the housetraining method you’re using. You 
can find more info on how to create this kind of schedule in 
Chapters 6 and 7.
Rewarding the good, 
ignoring the goofs
No, this section isn’t an advertorial for the Reverend Norman 
Vincent Peale’s treatise on The Power of Positive Thinking. But 
frankly, he had a point: A whole lot of power lies in positive 
thinking — and in positive training, too.
Think about that old approach to dog training I talk about at the 
beginning of this chapter. Basically, it revolves around finding your 
dog doing something wrong and then punishing him for doing so. 
But that approach frequently doesn’t work very well. All too often, 
dogs don’t know what they’re doing wrong, much less how to do 
something right.
The opposite, positive approach works much better than the 
negative one. Instead of pouncing on your dog for messing up, look 
for him to do the right thing — and when he does (trust me, he 
will), reward him lavishly. That reward can come in the form of 
verbal praise, loving hugs and petting, tasty treats, or even all 
three. In any case, take a positive approach, not a negative one. 
(Wondering what kinds of treats to give your dog? Never fear: Just 
about everything you ever wanted to know about dog treats 
appears in Chapter 4.)
Of course, you don’t just wait passively for your dog to do the right 
thing. As part of your approach, you need to actively guide him 
into performing the maneuvers you want him to perform, using his 
instincts to help him get the idea a little faster. And when he does 
get the idea, don’t forget to praise him to the skies. You have to 
reward him for doing what you want him to do.
 
By consistently showing your dog what you want him to do and 
then rewarding him for doing so, you’re conditioning your dog to 
do the right thing. You’re upping the odds that he’ll do what you 
want him to do every time you want him to do it.

Remember reading about Pavlov’s dogs in science class? The 
Russian scientist actually got the dogs to salivate by giving each 
dog a food reward — a treat — every time a bell rang. The dogs 
learned that the ringing bell would precede getting a treat, and 
they began to look forward to getting that treat. They were primed 
for that food reward, and as a result, their mouths mouth began 
to water.
You don’t have to wear a white coat and have a fancy laboratory to 
condition your dog the same way Pavlov conditioned his. Simply 
show your pooch what you want and immediately reward him for 
doing what you’ve shown him — whether it’s the first time he pees 
in your backyard or the hundredth time he anoints a tree instead 
of the rug in your bedroom. By giving him that reward, you’re 
letting him know that he’s done something that pleases you, and 
you give him an incentive to do that something again.
What if he does something wrong? If he pees on your carpet, you 
clean it up without any comment. If he poops on your brand-new 
hardwood floor, you whisk the mess away. Period. You don’t yell 
at him. You don’t punish him. You certainly don’t rub his nose in 
it. You just get rid of the mess and move on. (For the lowdown on 
the fine art of cleaning up the right way, see Chapter 3.)
 
If you catch your dog in the act of peeing or pooping in the wrong 
place, view the situation as a teaching opportunity for you and a 
learning opportunity for him. Interrupt him in the act and take him 
to the right place: the place where you’ve decided he should do his 
bathroom business.
Being consistent
Yes, I know. You’ve already got so much going on in your oh-so-
busy life that you can’t possibly remember what color your 
dog’s pee was yesterday or when she last pooped. Believe me, I 
sympathize. Everyone is on information overload. I, too, have 
trouble remembering what day it is. Sometimes I even forget that 
Allie has peed within a minute of her actually doing so.
But take heart. Help for memory-impaired folks is here: consis-
tency. In housetraining terms, consistency means having your dog 
eat, drink, pee, and poop at the same times and places every day. 
You create a routine that the two of you eventually can do in your 
sleep (or almost, anyway).
By adopting a consistent routine for your dog’s dining and toileting 
activities, you help not only your own memory but also your 
dog’s ability to housetrain faster. Dogs learn through repetition, so 

 Chapter 2: Training the Housetrainer: Taking the Right Approach 33
when you and she do the same things at the same times in the 
same places each day, she’ll come to expect that you’ll be doing 
those things.
This consistency affects your dog both physically and mentally. 
The repetition that you establish in feeding and housetraining your 
dog conditions her body as well as her mind. After all, you may be 
physically conditioned to expect that early morning jog or a 
second cup of coffee at the same time each day — and without the 
jog or joe, you don’t feel quite right. You don’t like that feeling, 
so you stick with your exercise and/or coffee routine; it becomes 
a habit. By establishing similar routines with your dog, you’re 
helping to make housetraining a habit for her. When her body gets 
used to the routine you set up for her, she’ll be primed to poop 
and pee when and where you want her to.
Don’t worry, though. After your dog is truly housetrained, you 
don’t have to be quite such a fanatic about repetition and consis-
tency. Your dog will have the control she needs to hold it a little 
longer if your schedule hits an unexpected snag. Still, keeping 
to at least a semblance of routine is a good idea, even when your 
four-legged friend is a housetraining ace.
Attending to details
Have you ever toilet-trained a child? If so, you know the impor-
tance of paying attention to seemingly trivial details, such as when 
he last peed in the potty, when he last did a doo-doo in his diaper, 
or what he ate for dinner the night before he had a funny-colored 
bowel movement.
The same is true when you’re housetraining your dog. During this 
process, you need to remember what you fed your four-legged 
friend and when you did so. Recalling how long it’s been since he 
last peed or pooped is always a good idea. And knowing what his 
pee or poop normally looks like is important so that you can tell 
when he may be sick. In fact, your dog’s pee and poop can tell you 
a lot about his overall health. (For more information on this topic, 
see Chapter 10.)
Paying attention to details also means taking the time to observe 
your dog and discover what makes him the unique individual he is. 
For example, do you know the answers to these questions?
 
✓ Does he lift his leg when he pees? Does he like to lift both legs 
(one at a time, of course)? Or does he not bother lifting his 
leg at all?

Part I: Preparing to Potty Train Your Pooch 
34
 
✓ Does he need to eliminate right after he eats, or does he like 
to wait awhile?
 
✓ Does he like to pee in the same spot all the time, or is he an 
I’ll-do-it-anywhere piddler?
 
✓ Does he circle and sniff before doing his business? Or does he 
suddenly stop midstride and do the deed before you quite 
realize what’s happening?
 
✓ Is he a little introvert who sometimes releases some urine 
when you greet him? Or is he an extrovert who offers a 
wagging tail and canine grin to everyone he meets?
Think of the stories you tell your friends about your dog. What 
are some funny things he’s done? How about the sweet things, the 
poignant things? What are some of his quirks — potty-related and 
otherwise?
What, you ask, do all these questions have to do with house-
training? A lot. The better you know your dog, the more you can 
empathize with him. The more you can empathize with him — to 
think the way he does — the better able you are to adjust his 
housetraining lessons to his unique character and perspective. 
And the better able you are to fine-tune your housetraining to 
his character, the more effective your housetraining efforts are 
overall.
This personalized — or rather, dog-specific — approach is particu-
larly true with respect to your dog’s bathroom habits. By paying 
attention to what he does when he pees or poops, you can better 
anticipate when he’s going to go — and intervene when he’s going 
to go in the wrong place.

efore you can start housetraining your puppy or adult dog, 
not only do you have to get yourself ready — you have to get 
your home ready. A domicile that’s not adjusted to the needs of 
both the housetrainee (your dog) and the housetrainer (you) can 
sabotage the efforts of both person and pooch.
Not to worry. In this chapter, I cover everything from finding the 
right crate to choosing the perfect potty spot —whether you plan 
to have your canine companion do her pottying indoors or out.
Readying Your Dog’s 
Room: The Crate
Professional dog trainers and experienced dog owners have dealt 
with a lot of puppy pee and doggie doo. Not surprisingly, they’ve 
gotten housetraining down to a science. And just about every one 
of them will tell you that using a crate makes housetraining easier, 
quicker, and more effective than any other method.
“A crate?” you ask. “How can that be? They look like cages, not 
potty-training devices.” Looks, however, can be deceiving. I’ve 
housetrained dogs with the help of a crate, and I’ve housetrained 
dogs without one. I’m a believer: I think crates are unquestionably 
the way to go if you want your dog to become a housetraining ace 
as soon as possible.

Understanding why every dog 
needs (and wants) a crate
Few objects are more important to a wild or domestic canine than 
the den — that safe, secure place that the animal can call his own. 
A crate makes a perfect doggie den. It’s compact, it’s cozy (or you 
can make it so with some well-chosen crate accessories), and it’s 
dark inside (or you can render it so by draping a towel or blanket 
atop the crate). And because a crate is open on one side but 
enclosed on the other three, it offers the dog a safe, secure window 
through which he can watch his world.
Dogs who are introduced to the crate at a young age soon grow 
to love their special spaces, and an older dog can learn to at least 
tolerate a crate when introduced to one properly. Either way, the 
attachment is well worth cultivating because doing so enables 
you to tap into a crucial component of your canine companion’s 
denning instinct.
Most domestic dogs do just about anything to avoid peeing or 
pooping in their dens. When that den is a crate, a dog learns to 
hold his pee and poop whenever he’s inside. If possible, he lets 
his floodgates open only when he’s away from these cherished 
structures of safety.
Sounds simple, doesn’t it? Well, using a crate to potty train your 
dog is simple, but it’s not quite effortless. You can’t just run out, 
buy a crate, and shove your dog into it with the idea that you’ll 
housetrain him at warp speed. Housetraining just doesn’t work 
that way. Housetraining is a fine art, and it starts with figuring out 
which size and type of crate to buy for your dog.
Finding the right fit: Types of crates
To begin with, you can choose from two basic types of crates: 
plastic and wire. Plastic crates, also known as carriers, are molded 
two-piece units with doors at their fronts and ventilation at their 
sides. Wire crates are made from panels of welded metal wire that 
are hinged together. Figure 3-1 shows the differences between 
the two.
This section explains the benefits and drawbacks of these two 
crate types. Ultimately, which type of crate to use is up to 
you. Just assess what your future needs are likely to be and 
make an educated guess as to which type of crate your dog will 
likely prefer.

 Chapter 3: Getting Your Home in Housetraining Order 37
Figure 3-1: Plastic and wire crates.
Plastic crates
Plastic crates offer several advantages over wire ones:
 
✓ Because they’re enclosed on three sides (except for the 
vents), plastic crates can easily become the snug, dark, 
cozy dens most dogs crave. I chose a plastic crate for my 
shy Shetland Sheepdog, Cory, because I thought he’d be 
happier having a dark place in which to hide rather than an 
open-air abode.
 
✓ Plastic crates generally meet airline specifications for pet 
shipment as baggage or cargo — an important consideration 
if you plan to travel by air with your canine companion.
 
✓ Plastic crates often cost a little less than wire crates do.
Plastic crates do have their downsides, though. For example, they 
can take up more than a little storage space because they don’t 
collapse or fold. In addition, the plastic makes these crates more 
vulnerable than wire crates to the ravages of canine teeth.
Wire crates
Wire crates also have some advantages:
 
✓ These crates’ all-around openness allows your dog to see 
what’s going on when he’s lounging in his doggie abode. If 
your dog doesn’t like such openness, you can throw a blanket 
over the top and sides of the wire crate to create a more 
enclosed den.

Part I: Preparing to Potty Train Your Pooch 
38
 
✓ Wire crates are totally collapsible, which means you can stash 
them away in tiny places when you’re not using them.
 
✓ Wire crates are far easier to adjust for size than plastic crates 
are. I chose a wire crate for my Golden Retriever puppy, Allie, 
for just that reason.
 
✓ Dogs who can’t stop chewing don’t get anywhere with wire 
crates — and that’s a big advantage in the wire-versus-plastic 
debate.
 
✓ Wire crates offer more ventilation than plastic ones do. If 
your pooch is a snub-nosed breed, such as a Pug or Boston 
Terrier, opt for a wire crate; such dogs are prone to breathing 
difficulties.
Like plastic crates, wire crates also carry a couple of disadvan-
tages: They’re not considered acceptable for airline travel, and 
they cost more than their plastic counterparts do.
Adjusting for size
Picking the right size of crate for your dog is crucial — not just for 
when he’s a puppy but also for when he’s an adult dog.
 
A correctly sized crate is just large enough for your dog to com-
fortably stand up, turn around, and lie down in. A smaller crate will 
cramp your canine companion. A larger crate will allow your dog 
to sleep and eat at one end of the crate and relieve himself at the 
other, which defeats the whole purpose of using the crate.
Either type of crate — wire or plastic — comes in several sizes. For 
example, one major retailer offers wire crates in four sizes that 
range from 30 x 20 x 23 inches to 48 x 30 x 35 inches. This retailer 
also offers a plastic crate in four sizes that range from 28 x 20.5 x 
21.5 inches to 40 x 27 x 30 inches.
 
Does the need to keep the crate the right size mean that you must 
buy a new one each time your puppy’s size increases significantly? 
Fortunately, the answer is no. You can actually buy one crate that 
can serve as your dog’s den from puppyhood on. The secret: Buy 
an adult-sized wire crate and block off some of the inside space 
while your dog is a puppy. Many wire crates come with dividers, 
wire panels that are similar to the plates at the back of the drawers 
in metal file cabinets. You simply slide the divider back as your 
puppy grows and needs a bigger crate. The budget-friendly result 
is that you have to buy only one crate for your dog’s lifetime.

 Chapter 3: Getting Your Home in Housetraining Order 39
Investing in crate accessories
For the sake of your dog’s comfort and your own convenience, you 
may want to invest in a few crate accessories:
 
✓ Mats: Chief among the crate accessories is some kind of 
soft mat or carpet for the crate. Crate manufacturers make a 
variety of mats and carpets to fit their products, including 
luxurious items such as cut-to-fit mats made of synthetic 
sheepskin and more basic (but still very comfortable) plastic 
polyurethane foam mats. Whatever kind of soft flooring you 
choose, though, make sure that you can clean your dog’s 
crate mat easily — machine-washable is ideal.
 
 Before you leave your puppy or dog alone in a crate with a 
mat or cloth, make sure she won’t chew or swallow it.
 
✓ Attachable dishes: You may want to buy a couple of dishes 
that you can attach to the inside of the crate door. Some 
crates come complete with such dishes, but if yours doesn’t, 
pet product manufacturers offer them separately. Such dishes 
make feeding your dog in her crate much easier — and eating 
in the crate can help her associate the crate with something 
positive if she hasn’t done so already. Moreover, most airlines 
require that a crate contain food and water for your jet-setting 
dog to consume.
 
✓ Crate dollies: Traveling canines and their owners may also 
appreciate having a crate dolly: a metal platform with four 
wheels and a nylon pull handle. Set your dog and her crate 
atop the dolly, and you can whisk her through the airport 
with ease.
Situating your doggie’s den
The best place to put your dog’s crate is wherever you are. Sounds 
simple enough — until you realize that you don’t stay in one place 
24/7 or even, sometimes, for more than a few minutes at a time.
A softer side to crating?
In addition to plastic and wire crates, a third kind of carrier is available: a soft-sided 
carrier. These carriers are lighter and easier to set up than plastic or wire crates, 
but they’re not good for housetraining, especially puppies. The reason: Such crates 
can’t withstand the ravages of canine teeth. Stick with a wire or plastic crate for 
in-home housetraining.

Part I: Preparing to Potty Train Your Pooch 
40
Fortunately, you can move a crate just about anywhere. Whenever 
I’m housetraining a dog, I keep the crate — with the housetrainee 
inside — in my bedroom with me at night. During the day, I move 
the crate into the living room near the kitchen so that my dog can 
see me and the rest of my family moving around the house. When I 
go downstairs to my office to start writing (I’m fortunate to be able 
to work from home), both dog and crate come with me.
Keeping your crated canine close not only makes housetraining 
easier — because you can keep tabs on what your housetrainee is 
doing — but also helps build the bond between the two of you.
Gearing Up for Outdoor Training
Teaching your pooch to potty outside means that you don’t have 
to provide an indoor doggie bathroom facility; however, you 
still need some equipment to get the job done. You also need to 
choose an outdoor potty spot for your dog during the house-
training process.
Selecting a potty spot — 
no matter where you live
Until your dog figures out that the bathroom is outside — and that 
she can hold her ammo till she gets there — the backyard or some 
other outdoor area near your house is your best bathroom bet. 
After all, if you choose a potty spot close to home, you and she 
won’t have to go too far when she needs to poop or pee. After your 
dog consistently restricts her bathroom maneuvers to the great 
outdoors — and lasts a couple of hours between potty breaks — 
you can expand her bathroom horizons beyond your property line.
 
A young puppy hasn’t received all the immunizations she needs 
to protect her from potentially fatal diseases, such as distemper 
and canine parvovirus, so the backyard is the best place to start 
outdoor-training a puppy who’s younger than 16 weeks of age. 
A puppy can catch such diseases through contact with infected 
dogs’ bodily wastes or vomit, so keeping your dog away from these 
substances is important. Until your pup has completed her shots, 
keep her potty in your yard and keep her away from areas where 
other dogs may do their business.

 Chapter 3: Getting Your Home in Housetraining Order 41
Within your yard, a good potty spot is any place that’s fairly close 
to your house and easy to clean. Plan to clean up your dog’s potty 
area at least once a day.
If you live in an apartment or don’t have access to a yard for 
another reason, you need to walk your puppy to her potty area, 
but make sure that area isn’t where other dogs congregate. Your 
vet can suggest where to take your apartment-dwelling puppy until 
she’s fully immunized.
 
Cleaning up after your dog takes on added importance when you 
start taking her to public places. If your dog poops in a public 
area, clean it up immediately. Most communities have enacted 
compulsory cleanup statutes for very good reasons: Dog poop is 
gross, and it carries disease-bearing organisms.
Securing collars and leashes
Unless you and Fido plan to spend the rest of your lives behind 
four walls, sooner or later you’ll have to venture into the great 
outdoors. Even if you plan to have your four-legged friend do most 
of his pottying within your fenced yard, sometimes — such as 
when you travel — a fenced yard isn’t available. Plus, when you get 
the urge to saunter around your neighborhood on a gorgeous day, 
won’t you want to take Fido with you?
For most pooches and their owners, collars and leashes are facts 
of life. But these ties don’t need to bind you or your dog. This 
section provides info on choosing the right collar and leash for 
your four-legged friend.
Types of collars
A collar isn’t just a collar. You have lots of doggie neckwear to 
choose from, and making the right choice is important because if 
you don’t, you run the risk of injuring or even losing your dog. The 
following list describes the most common safe options for canine 
necks (and in some cases, bodies):
 
✓ Leather collars: These rolled collars resemble leather rings 
for gigantic fingers and have several advantages, including the 
fact that they look nice, smell nice (if you like the smell of 
leather), and don’t damage the dog’s fur. However, they often 
cost more than other types of collars and may not provide 
the control you need if your pooch is an unruly walker. Still, 
they usually offer good options for puppies, small adult 
dogs, sensitive pooches, and any adult dog who walks nicely 
on a leash.

Part I: Preparing to Potty Train Your Pooch 
42
 
✓ Fabric collars: Collars made from fabric, such as cotton or 
nylon, resemble very small belts or very large watchbands. 
Some fabric collars buckle around the dog’s neck. You secure 
others with plastic snap-in clips. Either way, fabric collars are 
best suited to puppies, small adult dogs, and well-behaved 
adult canine walkers. These collars generally cost less than 
leather, but dogs may find them a tad less comfortable 
because they’re wider than leather collars are. They tend to 
absorb dirt and odor more, too.
 
✓ Head halters: If your dog is unruly, what can you turn to? One 
option is the head halter, a little nylon device that consists 
of a loop that goes behind the dog’s neck and a second loop 
that encircles the muzzle. When you place it on the dog, it 
looks like a horse bridle. The head halter works in the same 
way a bridle guides a horse — where the head goes, the body 
follows. Many trainers recommend head halters not only 
to restrain rambunctious dogs but also to deal with other 
problems, such as dogs who lunge at other canines and 
people or who bark a lot while walking. The only disadvantage 
of the head halter is that some dogs find them itchy and 
difficult to get used to.
 
✓ No-pull harnesses: Need another option to keep your pooch 
from pulling? Try a no-pull harness, a device that uses a chest 
strap to restrain your sled-dog wannabe. By attaching the 
dog’s leash to the chest strap instead of to a collar, you direct 
pressure to restrain the dog away from the neck and to the 
chest. No-pull harnesses can be difficult to fit, though — and 
for the owner of a persistent puller, they may not provide 
enough control.
 
✓ Body harnesses: For a small puppy or tiny adult dog, such as 
a Maltese or a Yorkshire Terrier, a body harness may be a 
much better option than a neck collar. Conventional neck 
collars may injure a small dog’s trachea, but a body harness 
bypasses that danger because it doesn’t touch the dog’s neck. 
Body harnesses are also good options for dogs with back or 
disk problems or breeds with especially long bodies, such 
as Dachshunds, because they provide support to the back. 
Dogs whose heads are smaller than their necks, such as 
Greyhounds, are also good candidates for body harnesses.
 
Some collars designed to help owners “correct” their dogs seem 
more likely to punish than to teach. Practical owners recognize 
that the following neckwear can hurt or injure their dogs:
 
✓ Slip collars: Also known as training collars or choke collars, 
slip collars were once a mainstay for most dog trainers and 
owners. The collar’s snap-and-release action puts momentary 
pressure on a dog’s neck, which theoretically creates an 
incentive for the dog to cease her bad behavior.

 Chapter 3: Getting Your Home in Housetraining Order 43
 
 Slip collars can damage a dog’s windpipe when used 
incorrectly — and that happens more often than not, because 
instead of performing a quick jerk (the correct method), many 
owners pull on the collar without releasing it. The prolonged 
pull causes the dog to gasp for breath and often fails to 
stop the behavior that prompted the owner to pull on the 
collar in the first place. Bottom line: Dog owners don’t need 
slip collars, because people can use less coercive methods 
to teach their dogs to walk nicely while on leash.
 
✓ Prong collars: If slip collars are bad, prong collars are worse. 
This neck gear is exactly what the name says: a collar with 
prongs that poke the dog’s neck when the owner pulls on 
the leash. Prong collars hurt, and they’re cruel. You don’t 
need to inflict pain or be cruel to teach your dog proper 
walking etiquette, bathroom manners, or anything else. For 
information on how to teach a dog to walk politely on leash 
without hurting himself, check out Dog Training For Dummies, 
2nd Edition, by Jack and Wendy Volhard (Wiley).
Types of leashes
You don’t have quite as many leashes to choose from as you do 
collars. Still, enough variety is out there to stump the average dog 
owner. As with collars, choosing the right leash is important — 
for your comfort, your dog’s safety, and the safety of other people 
you and she may encounter while you’re exploring the great out-
doors. Here’s what to consider as you sort through your leashing 
alternatives:
 
✓ Leather leash: I prefer leather leashes to fabric ones for two 
reasons: Leather’s easier to hold on to, and it lasts a long 
time. The easier hold comes in handy if your pooch bolts 
while on the leash, because you can tighten your hold without 
getting the rope burn on your hand that a cotton or nylon 
leash can give you. However, leather leashes generally 
cost significantly more than nylon or cotton leashes of the 
same length.
Measuring up on collar size
To determine your dog’s collar size, simply wrap a tape measure fairly loosely 
around her neck. Add 2 inches to the measurement, and you have her size. For 
example, a dog whose neck measures 12 inches around needs a 14-inch collar. 
After you buy the collar and put it on your dog, see whether you can slip two fingers 
under it. If you can fit only one finger, the collar is too tight; if you can fit more than 
two, the collar is too loose.

Part I: Preparing to Potty Train Your Pooch 
44
 
✓ Fabric leash: Fabric leashes are cheaper, and because they 
come in lots of colors, they allow you and your dog to make 
a fashion statement, such as matching the collar color to 
the leash color. The downsides are that such leashes are 
generally less durable and less comfortable to grip than their 
leather counterparts. Some manufacturers have tried to solve 
the latter problem by adding padding to the handles.
 
✓ Retractable leash: A retractable leash contains a long wire or 
cord (up to 16 feet) and a hook. The wire resides within a 
plastic housing, and you can retract the leash by pressing a 
button or lever on the housing. Retractable leashes can give 
your dog a feeling of greater freedom, but they also carry 
several disadvantages. If your dog pulls when she walks, a 
retractable leash doesn’t help you control her; in fact, it may 
encourage her to pull even harder. These leashes are also 
tough for other people to see; more than once, I’ve nearly 
broken my neck after tripping over such a leash.
 
 At the very least, don’t use retractable leashes in populated 
areas where people can trip over them. Also, don’t use them 
near streets, because your dog can run into the street and 
become instant roadkill even while attached to the leash.
Leashes can range between 4 feet and 50 feet. For ordinary walks, 
your best bet is a 6-foot leather or fabric tether. If you opt for a 
retractable leash, make sure that you don’t extend the leash to go 
beyond 6 feet when you and Fido are in crowds or in public places; 
in many municipalities, leash lengths longer than 6 feet are illegal.
Containing the situation: Fencing
A fenced yard can provide the foundation for an outdoor paradise 
for your pooch. It can also make housetraining easier if — and this 
is a big if — you realize that you’re still the one who needs to teach 
Spot when and where to do his business. That means you need to 
go out with him while he learns to poop and pee outdoors. Only 
when he’s mastered the art of outdoor bathroom behavior can you 
stay inside while he heads out into the yard to do his thing.
Still, having a fenced yard has several undeniable advantages. For 
one thing, you don’t have to hassle with leashes every time Spot 
needs to make an outdoor pit stop. And in mornings and evenings, 
you can stay in your nightwear while you take Spot to his backyard 
bathroom. That beats having to get dressed and embark on a 
bleary-eyed walk around the neighborhood with your canine potty 
trainee.

 Chapter 3: Getting Your Home in Housetraining Order 45
Just make sure that the fencing you install doesn’t awaken the 
escape artist in your dog’s soul. Ask your local hardware store and 
fencing contract professional which materials are best for keeping 
canines in the dogs’ own yards. And as you or your contractor 
install the fence, make sure that no openings or crevices — either 
aboveground or underground — provide portals through which 
Fido can escape.
 
Even if you have a fence, don’t turn your dog out into the backyard 
and leave him there all day, every day. Would you want to be in the 
same place every day, with no way to leave it? All too often, yard 
dogs become bored dogs — and bored dogs frequently turn into 
noisy dogs who bark all day or destructive dogs who resort to dig-
ging in a desperate attempt to escape the yard or simply amuse 
themselves. Your neighbors will be grateful if you keep your dog 
inside with you most of the time. Your yard will look better, too.
Installing a doggie door
A doggie door, which is a canine-sized portal built into your door, 
provides a passage between the inside of your house and your 
outside yard. Covering the passage is a flap or panel that the dog 
pushes aside with his nose. Thus, as Figure 3-2 shows, a doggie 
door enables your dog to take himself outside whenever he needs 
a potty break.
Figure 3-2: Your canine companion can use a doggie door take 
himself outside whenever he needs to go.

Part I: Preparing to Potty Train Your Pooch 
46
A doggie door can be a simple portal-and-flap affair or an elaborate 
electronic system. Different models can go into walls, French 
doors, or regular doors. A doggie door can be a godsend for you 
and your already-housetrained dog: She doesn’t have to hold it all 
day while you’re at work, and you don’t have to get up to let 
Bowser out in the middle of the night.
 
Make sure that the doggie door leads your dog to a secured area — 
either a fenced backyard or some sort of dog run. Experts suggest 
that you close and lock the doggie door when you don’t need it 
(such as when you’re home and are able to let the dog outside 
yourself when he needs to go) and that you install it in an incon-
spicuous area of your house. These precautions give you the 
convenience of a doggie door without extending an invitation to 
burglars or other intruders.
 
Don’t rely on a doggie door until your pooch has mastered his 
housetraining fundamentals. For some dogs, figuring out where 
and when to do their business is complicated enough without 
also having to learn to maneuver that doggie door flap.
Prepping for Indoor Training
If you choose to have your pooch do the doo inside your home, 
you don’t need to think about fencing or doggie doors at all, and 
you need to think about leashing your dog only when you go 
out for a casual stroll. But indoor training still requires some 
Zapping electric fencing
Electric fencing sounds like a dream come true. Manufacturers of such invisible 
boundary systems claim that they teach your dog to stay within the boundaries of 
your property without your having to erect a conventional fence. The dog wears a 
special collar that gives him an electrical shock when he crosses the boundaries 
of your yard.
However, such fencing is far from foolproof. Some determined canines venture 
beyond their property lines despite getting shocked by their collars, only to refuse 
to come back home because they don’t want to endure another shock upon reentry. 
Another problem with electric fencing is that other dogs, animals, or people 
can enter the yard freely, and your dog can’t escape from them, which makes him 
vulnerable.
As with so many other products, electric fencing seems to promise a shortcut to 
teaching and taking care of your dog. All too often, though, such shortcuts only 
shorten the path to problems.

 Chapter 3: Getting Your Home in Housetraining Order 47
equipment and forethought. In this section, I offer ideas about how 
to choose the proper receptacles and where to put them inside 
your house.
Exploring types of indoor potties
Many options are available to the pooch who potties indoors. 
Those options include the following:
 
✓ Newspapers: They’re cheap, but they’re not necessarily neat. 
The first time you clean up a few squares of newspaper 
soaked in dog pee, the potential messiness of this enterprise 
becomes evident. If you don’t pick up the paper carefully, the 
pee that was on the paper may drip down to the floor — or 
worse, onto you. Plus, those newspapers never look very nice 
when they’re spread out on your floor, even before your dog 
uses them.
 
✓ Puppy training pads: Some stores sell absorbent pads you 
can lay out on the floor, but I don’t recommend them. They’re 
messy, and the dog can shred them. Reusing old newspapers 
is cheaper and more environmentally friendly, too.
 
✓ Litter boxes: They look better on the floor than newspapers 
do, and cleanup’s a lot more sanitary: Just scoop the used 
litter into the trash and flush any solid waste down the 
toilet. But litter boxes aren’t as portable or convenient as 
newspapers, and they’re also more expensive.
 
✓ Novelty potties: Innovative companies are creating indoor 
potty options for dogs all the time. For example, one novel 
facility is the UGoDog (www.ugodog.net), which consists of 
a plastic tray and a plastic grate that lies atop the tray. The 
dog steps onto the grate and does his business, which drops 
from the grate into the tray.
I say more about indoor potties in Chapter 7. Ultimately, the 
indoor potty you choose is a matter of personal preference. If 
you hate the look of newspapers all over your floor, a litter box 
or novelty potty may be a good alternative. But if you want to 
housetrain your pooch as cheaply as possible, newspapers have 
the edge.
Setting up your dog’s indoor 
living area and potty spot
Indoor training is a lot easier for both people and pooches when 
the dog’s living area — his home within your home — is arranged 
appropriately. And I say “home within your home” for a very 

Part I: Preparing to Potty Train Your Pooch

important reason: Until you’ve fully housetrained your dog, he 
shouldn’t have access to your entire home unless you can be right 
there to watch his every move.
This no-total-access rule is crucial whether you live in a pocket-
sized apartment or an abode that rivals Hearst Castle. That’s 
because if you’re not watching what Fido is doing, you’re not 
likely to see when Fido’s about to have an accident. Whenever 
you have to clean up the accident after the fact, you’ve missed a 
golden opportunity to remind Fido where he’s supposed to do his 
business.
So during those times you can’t pay close attention to your indoor 
trainee, confine him to a dog-proofed living area that he can call 
his own. The living area should include the following:
 
✓ A soft, comfy bed, possibly within a crate (see the earlier 
section “Readying Your Dog’s Room: The Crate” for info on 
choosing the right crate for your dog)
 
✓ A place to eat
 
✓ A place to potty
 
✓ Containment to keep your pooch from making unauthorized 
forays outside his living area
The containment can take the form of baby gates or an exercise 
pen, also known as an x-pen. An x-pen looks like a six-or eight-sided 
wire crate without a top or bottom. Make sure the gate or x-pen is 
high enough that your puppy can’t leap over it, and make sure it 
touches the floor so he can’t squeeze under it.
When you have those essentials, you need to decide where to put 
them. Here are some factors to consider when figuring out where 
you should set up your dog’s living area:
 
✓ Your dog’s needs: Your indoor trainee needs more than just a 
place to sleep, eat, poop, and pee. He also needs to be in the 
middle of his household’s action. A dog is a social being; the 
closer he is to his people, the happier he is. Plus, the time 
your puppy or dog spends in the hub of the household gives 
him the mental and social stimulation he needs to become an 
easy-to-live-with member of your family.
 
✓ Your needs: When figuring out where to place a dog’s living 
area, one of the most important considerations is whether the 
area is easy to clean. That’s because no matter how carefully 
you follow the instructions in this book, your pooch will have 
some accidents before he masters the art of proper potty 

 Chapter 3: Getting Your Home in Housetraining Order 49
behavior. Removing those accidents easily and thoroughly is 
crucial — both for your peace of mind and for your four-
legged friend’s housetraining progress. For those reasons, 
locating the dog’s living area in an uncarpeted room is often a 
good idea.
 
✓ Your home layout: The place in which you establish your 
dog’s living space needs to have enough room for both you 
and him to go about the business of living. This consideration 
may prompt you to place your dog’s living area in a different 
part of your home than someone else would, which is okay. 
There’s no one-size-fits-all best place to locate your puppy’s 
palace.
Many people opt to house their dogs in their kitchens, which often 
makes sense. After all, kitchens are usually relatively large, the 
floors are easy to clean, and families tend to gather there more 
than in any other room in the house. However, corralling a dog in 
the kitchen may not be practical if that room is very small, as is 
often the case in many city apartments.
 
If you have a small kitchen, house your dog in your bedroom with 
you. By keeping the dog’s living area in your bedroom, your dog 
can spend lots of time with you without your having to watch him 
every second.
After you decide which room your puppy can share with you, you 
have to arrange his things. Generally, you need to remember only 
one cardinal rule here: Place the bed and dishes away from the 
designated potty area. By doing so, you encourage your dog’s 
instinctive desire to keep his sleeping and dining areas clean.
 
When your dog is first learning to potty properly, cover all but a 
small strip of the entire living area with newspaper. Then, as he 
begins to show that he knows where to go, gradually reduce the 
papered-over area. You can also put some plastic, such as a 
shower curtain, between the papers and the floor to keep your 
dog’s pee from soaking through the papers.
Doing the Dirty Work: 
Cleanup Equipment
Countless communities have jumped onto the canine cleanup 
bandwagon. From New York to San Francisco, American cities and 
towns have enacted laws that require their citizens to clean up 
immediately after their dogs poop. Failure to do so can lead to 
hefty fines for the human offenders.

Part I: Preparing to Potty Train Your Pooch 
50
 
The cities with pooper-scooper laws aren’t just concerned with the 
gross-out factor of pet poop. Animal waste from yards or near 
streets often slips into storm drains and streams. The extra fertil-
izer encourages algae to grow and carries poop-dwelling parasites 
to your favorite fishing spots and swimming holes. Yuck.
In this section, you explore the best ways to clean up after your 
four-legged friend.
Choosing an outdoor cleanup method
Cleaning up outside isn’t just a matter of aesthetics; it’s a matter of 
sanitation. What’s the best way to clean up your dog’s poop when 
she goes outside? Here are a few methods to choose from, along 
with tips on how to properly execute them.
Bagging it
The quickest, easiest way to get rid of a dog’s poop is to put it in a 
plastic bag and then either drop the bag in a trash can or flush the 
bag’s contents down a toilet.
You may think that this method has a high gross-out factor — and 
it can. But it doesn’t have to. Here are the two keys to effective 
bagging: using the right size of bag and developing the proper 
bagging technique.
 
Choose a bag that’s large enough to hold your dog’s poop, such as 
an empty bread bag or the plastic bag that your newspaper came 
in. Both of these types are oblong, which greatly eases your ability 
to get the poop into the bag instead of on yourself. You may want 
to carry two bags at a time — some dogs poop more than once 
during bathroom breaks.
 
Before you use your bag, make sure that it doesn’t have any holes, 
especially at the bottom. Picking up a bunch of dog doo only to 
have it hit the ground again is a surefire recipe for frustration.
After you have the right bag, gathering up the poop is easy. 
Here’s how:
 
1. Pull the plastic bag over one hand like a glove.
 
 If you’re cleaning up while walking your dog, loop the leash 
around your wrist and pull the bag over the leashed hand.
 
2. Pick up the poop with your bagged hand.

 Chapter 3: Getting Your Home in Housetraining Order 51
 
3. With your other hand, grasp the open end of the bag and 
pull the bag inside out.
 
 The poop will now be inside the bag.
 
4. Knot the bag and drop it into the nearest trash can, 
or take the bag inside and flush the contents down 
the toilet.
Of course, if you’re walking your dog and can’t find a trash can 
nearby, you have to carry the bagged poop until you find one. But 
take heart. Soon, not even the thought of having to tote your dog’s 
poop around town will gross you out — it’ll just be a fact of life.
Scooping it
If you can’t bear handling your dog’s poop, consider using a 
pooper-scooper. A pooper-scooper is a long-handled rake, shovel, 
or spadelike device that enables the owner to scoop up the poop 
without having to bend down and get close to it.
Digesting it
If you don’t want to put your dog’s poop in the trash, or if you 
like the idea of high-tech waste disposal, you may want to acquire 
a waste digester system. This small in-ground system works 
the same way a septic system does: It liquefies any dog poop 
deposited there and drains the liquid into the surrounding soil.
The basic waste digester system has two parts: the digester unit 
itself (including the lid) and the digester mix. Follow these steps to 
use this system:
 
1. Find a convenient but out-of-the-way spot in your yard to 
install the digester.
 
 Don’t install a waste digester near a storm drain, water 
well, or vegetable garden.
 
2. Dig a hole about 48 inches deep.
 
3. Install the digester and lid in the hole.
 
 The lid should be just a little bit above the ground.
 
4. When your dog poops, bring the poop to the digester, 
remove the lid, and place the poop inside.
 
5. Add some digester mix and some water and replace 
the lid.
 
 Then the digester does its thing.

Part I: Preparing to Potty Train Your Pooch 
52
Digesters are a good option for the same people who go for 
pooper-scoopers — owners whose dogs do most of their pooping 
in their own yards. In fact, owners often use the two methods 
together. They use the scooper to transport the poop to the 
digester and then use the digester to process the poop.
You can find digesters at pet stores, in pet supply catalogs, and 
on pet retail Web sites. The cost, including both the digester unit 
and the digester mix, ranges between $40 and $55. Make sure, 
though, that your land is suitable for digesters: Soils with heavy 
clay, land with high water tables, and areas with low temperatures 
may not be suited for these products. And check your local laws to 
make sure that digesters are okay for use in your community.
 
Digesting isn’t the same as composting. Composting is a great 
way to recycle certain materials, but your dog’s poop shouldn’t 
be among them. The temperatures in the compost pile don’t rise 
high enough to kill the pathogens in that poop. For safety’s sake, 
dispose of your dog’s solid deposit in another way.
Help! My lawn is dying!
Plastic bags, pooper-scoopers, and dog-doo digesters do a great job of removing 
poop from sidewalks and lawns, but they’re totally ineffective in dealing with the 
damage a dog’s urine can do to a carpet of green grass. Female dogs are especially 
lethal to grass, because they squat and urinate in one place. Males, on the 
other hand, often lift their legs and anoint vertical surfaces such as bushes, trees, 
and shrubs.
Of course, keeping your dog off the grass does the most to preserve the lush green 
carpet better known as your front lawn. But if that’s not an option — or if your dog 
gets away from you and takes a whiz on your prized turf — you can try the following 
options:
 ✓ Flush the area. Immediately after your dog does her duty, saturate the area with 
water. Doing so dilutes the nitrogen in the urine and reduces the damage the 
urine causes.
 ✓ Change the grass. Some varieties of grass, such as ryegrass and fescue, are 
more resistant to urine damage than others. Planting such varieties, at least in 
the spots that your dog most often anoints, can help save your lawn.
 ✓ Give your dog more water. Giving your dog more water can help dilute her urine 
before it hits the grass, thereby reducing the damage the urine inflicts.

 Chapter 3: Getting Your Home in Housetraining Order 53
Indoor cleaners
Until you fully housetrain your dog — and perhaps even thereafter, 
if she becomes ill — she’s going to make some mistakes. Instead 
of doing her business outside, on the papers, or in the litter pan, 
she’ll do it inside — on the floor, on the carpet, on the furniture, or 
even on your bed.
In any case, you want to get rid of the mess as soon as possible. Of 
course, you want to preserve the surface on which your dog has 
put her unwelcome deposit, but you need to get rid of the puddle 
or pile right away for another more important reason: Canine pee 
or poop is like a magnet to dogs. If Lassie urinates on the carpet 
and you don’t clean up that urine promptly and thoroughly, Lassie 
will come back to that spot again and again to pee on it.
To prevent repeated accidents, you need to remove not only the 
pee or poop and the stain it leaves but also any odor it emits. 
Certain cleaners accomplish all these objectives. Others don’t 
quite do the job.
 
If you’re looking for a product that cleans up your dog’s bathroom 
boo-boos, make sure the product’s label specifically states that 
purpose. Such products contain special enzymes or other proper-
ties that break down the dog’s waste and neutralize its odor. 
When the odor is gone, the dog can’t smell where she performed 
her last unauthorized download and, lucky for you, doesn’t have 
any incentive to repeat that performance.
Here are some cleaning products to avoid:
 
✓ Ammonia: If you use an ammonia-based cleaner to mop up 
your dog’s accident, you may as well ask her to return to 
perform an encore. Ammonia smells like urine to dogs, so the 
odor from an ammonia-based cleaner draws your pooch back 
to where she peed before and prompts her to do it again.
 
✓ Club soda: Some dog owners advocate using club soda in a 
pinch to clean up a dog’s bathroom boo-boo. Although club 
soda is cheaper and more readily available than a commercial 
pet stain remover, the soda is much less effective than the 
commercial product. Club soda may help remove the stain 
caused by a dog’s bathroom accident, but it does nothing to 
remove the odor.

Part I: Preparing to Potty Train Your Pooch 
54
Other cleaning aids
The products I describe in the preceding sections more than do 
the job of cleaning up your dog’s bathroom byproducts both 
indoors and out. However, you may want to consider a few other 
products and services:
 
✓ A black light: If you think you’ve removed all traces of stain 
and odor from your favorite area rug but Fido’s still peeing 
on it, invest $20 or so on a black light. This handy device 
illuminates old urine stains that you may not be able to see. 
Use your indoor pet stain cleaner to remove such stains once 
and for all — and remember that one application may not be 
enough to do the job.
 
✓ A pooper-scooper service: Does the very thought of dealing 
with your dog’s poop give you the willies? Do you have 
mobility problems? Or do you just not have the time to deal 
with cleaning up your poop-laden yard? If you answered 
yes to any of these questions, consider hiring a professional 
poop-scooping company. To find one, type “pooper scooper 
service” and the state you live in into an Internet search 
engine. Depending on how populated your state is, you should 
come up with at least a few hits. Another option: Visit Poop 
Butler at www.poopbutler.com and check out their Pooper 
Scooper Directory.
 
✓ Undergarments: Sometimes even the most trustworthy dog 
has a health problem that temporarily makes holding water 
impossible for her to do. Until you and your veterinarian 
figure out why she’s having such problems, you can protect 
your carpets and furniture by fitting your pooch with an 
undergarment, such as a doggie diaper, underpants, or even 
the canine equivalent of a sanitary napkin. Check out Chapter 9 
for more info on these garments, and see Chapter 10 for more 
on illnesses that can cause bathroom problems.

Chapter 4
Feeding Fido: What Goes 
In Must Come Out
In This Chapter
▶ Linking feeding and housetraining
▶ Selecting the right food for your dog
▶ Making the treat decision
▶ Giving your dog a drink
You can’t discuss the art of housetraining a dog — much less 
practice that art successfully — without also discussing what 
you’re going to feed that dog.
The reason is simple: What comes out of your dog in the form 
of pee or poop is directly related to what you put into him. 
Consequently, if you control what you feed your four-legged friend, 
you also exert some control over his bathroom behavior. In 
this chapter, I explain how that relationship works — and how 
to take advantage of that relationship as you teach your canine 
companion proper potty deportment.
Knowing How Feeding and 
Watering Affect Housetraining
That what-goes-in-eventually-comes-out principle of housetraining 
manifests itself in countless ways. Here are just a few examples:
 
✓ What you feed: This affects the size and consistency of 
your dog’s poop, as well as how often he may need to do the 
doo. For example, if your dog eats a lot of vegetables, he’ll 
probably need to poop more often than the pooch who 
prefers more basic canine fare. Vegetables contain relatively 
high amounts of fiber, and fiber acts as a laxative.

Part I: Preparing to Potty Train Your Pooch 
56
 
 Also, food that’s high in salt is likely to make your dog thirsty. 
Ingesting goodies that have a lot of salt in them, such as many 
table scraps, may send your pooch to his water dish more 
often. And the more times your dog tanks up, the more often 
he’s going to need to empty his tank (his bladder).
 
 Even different types of dog food affect your dog’s bathroom 
output. A dog who eats a raw food diet tends to have firmer, 
more compact stools than a pooch whose diet consists of 
other fare.
 
✓ When you feed: Timing directly affects when your dog needs 
to potty. A canine housetrainee who eats his dinner at 5 p.m. 
needs a post-dinner pit stop earlier in the evening than the 
dog who sups at 7 p.m.
 
 Experts explain that the very act of eating can activate a dog’s 
gastrocolic reflex: In layman’s terms, that means the act of 
chowing down triggers your dog’s urge to go.
 
✓ How you feed: A pooch who has to gulp his food amid a 
chaotic atmosphere may suffer from an upset stomach — 
which in turn can result in more frequent, looser, and 
tougher-to-clean-up bowel movements.
Understanding Nutrients: 
What Dogs Need to Eat
Just like you, dogs need certain basic nutrients to survive, much 
less thrive. Those nutrients include proteins, fats, vitamins, and 
minerals. This section explains why they’re necessary and how 
your dog can obtain them.
Much more info about dog food and nutrition is in Dog Health and 
Nutrition For Dummies, by M. Christine Zink (Wiley). For up-to-date 
information, consider subscribing to the Whole Dog Journal (www.
whole-dog-journal.com), which ranks commercial foods every 
year and accepts no advertising.
Proteins
Proteins enable the body to convert food into energy. They 
also promote healthy growth and cell repair and affect both 
metabolism and nervous system function. Commercial dog foods 
contain several types of protein:

 Chapter 4: Feeding Fido: What Goes In Must Come Out 57
 
✓ Meat protein: From animal organs or muscles
 
✓ Animal protein: From any other part of the animal that 
contains protein, such as hooves and hair
 
✓ Grain protein: From exactly where the name says it’s from
Not all proteins are created equal. A dog can digest meat or animal 
proteins more easily than she can digest grain proteins. The more 
digestible the protein, the better it is for the dog.
 
One clear indicator of dog food’s digestibility is the size of the 
dog’s stools. Small stools mean more food has been digested, and 
larger stools (from the same size of dog) indicate that less food has 
been digested. Consequently, a dog who eats food that’s high in 
meat-based protein will probably have smaller, more compact 
poop than the dog of the same size whose food is composed of 
more grain.
Proteins are made up of amino acids, ten of which a dog has to get 
through diet. If proteins don’t contain all ten essential amino acids, 
those proteins are considered incomplete.
 
Meat protein sources are more likely to be complete, so at the 
very least, you should choose high-quality foods that are lower in 
grain-based proteins and higher in meat-based proteins. The list of 
ingredients on a dog food package label shows which ingredients 
predominate and the percentage of each ingredient in the food.
The amount of protein a dog needs varies throughout a dog’s life. 
For example, puppies need more protein than adult dogs do, 
because puppies are still growing and need extra energy. Protein 
requirements also vary between dogs with different activity levels. 
A Border Collie who spends her days herding livestock needs more 
protein in her diet than a Bulldog whose fastest pace is likely to be 
a leisurely amble.
Fats
Fats are essential to maintaining healthy hair and skin. They also 
help keep a dog’s body temperature stable and promote healthy 
digestion. And because they contain more calories than protein, 
fats are sources of energy. Of course, too much fat in a diet — 
particularly when coupled with a lack of exercise — leads to extra 
poundage on both pooches and people. Fats are in many foods and 
in supplements such as fatty acid capsules.

Part I: Preparing to Potty Train Your Pooch 
58
Vitamins and minerals
Vitamins and minerals enable the body to properly process pro-
teins and fats (as well as carbohydrates; see the nearby sidebar 
for more on this topic). They also help sustain a dog’s immune 
system, maintain coat quality, and prevent disorders ranging from 
bone problems to behavioral difficulties.
Vitamins and minerals may be incorporated into a commercial 
food or dispensed as a supplement in the form of pills or caplets. 
To be fully effective, vitamins and minerals must be balanced 
properly. For example, calcium supplements aren’t fully effective 
unless they’re combined with magnesium.
Determining the Diet That’s 
Best for Your Dog
Your dog food choices depend mainly on your dog: her prefer-
ences, her age, and her lifestyle. For example, you may go for a 
higher protein food if your canine companion is a growing puppy 
and/or is very active. Foods that are lower in protein content may 
be better for adult dogs, particularly if they spend most of their 
time being couch potatoes. And if your dog doesn’t like the brand 
you’re currently feeding her, trying another makes sense. No food, 
no matter how nutritious it is, will do your dog much good if she 
refuses to eat it.
What dogs may not need: Carbohydrates
In discussing dogs’ dietary needs, I don’t mention an element that’s common in 
doggie diets: carbohydrates. I have a reason for that: It’s not at all clear that dogs 
need them — and in fact, at least some dogs are better off without them.
Carbs are just another source of energy. Plants use light to create carbohydrates 
from carbon dioxide and water. Most carbs in dog foods come from grains such as 
corn and wheat. They may also come from legumes, particularly soybeans. But 
those grains can cause problems for some dogs in the form of food allergies and 
learning problems, and they may cause others to put on too much weight.
For those reasons, bagging carbs completely in favor of diets based solely on 
meats, veggies, and fruits may be an option worth considering. For more informa-
tion, talk to your vet.

 Chapter 4: Feeding Fido: What Goes In Must Come Out 59
 
The fact that your dog likes her food isn’t enough. It also needs 
to be good for her. Here are some questions to ask to help you 
evaluate whether the food your pooch likes is good for her, too:
 
✓ Is her poop firm and compact, or is it loose, bulky, and 
stinky? If the latter is the case, your four-legged friend may be 
having trouble digesting the food. Consider switching to a 
higher quality food: one that lists a meat protein as the first 
ingredient and has a lower grain content, if any.
 
✓ Is her skin dry and flaky? If so, her food may lack fatty acids. 
Consider switching to a food that has a higher fat content or 
consulting your vet about getting a fatty acid supplement.
 
✓ Is your home-alone dog acting jittery? Does she seem 
spazzed? The protein content in her food may be too high. 
Consider switching her to a lower-protein product.
 
✓ Is your pooch porking out? Look for a higher protein, lower 
fat food. Pudgy pups (and adult dogs) are at greater risk 
for developing health problems than their slimmer canine 
brethren are.
 
Make sure that any switches from one dog food to another are very 
gradual. A dog who’s switched suddenly from one food to another 
is very likely to acquire an upset stomach. As you experiment to 
find a dog food that your canine companion likes, switch foods 
gradually. Prevent upsets by mixing progressively larger amounts 
of the new food with the old over a period of several days.
In the following subsections, I discuss some of your feeding 
choices, including commercial, home-cooked, and raw foods.
Considering commercial dog foods
Years ago, dogs ate whatever people didn’t feel like eating: table 
scraps, unwanted leftovers, and stuff otherwise destined for the 
garbage can. Many dogs also procured their own protein sources 
by killing animals such as barnyard rodents or rabbits who strayed 
into the fields where the dogs liked to roam. But just as life on 
the farm became a thing of the past for many people and their 
pooches, interest in breeding prize-winning dogs burgeoned. So at 
the same time that dogs could no longer scrounge up their own 
grub, their increasingly busy owners began demanding better fare 
than those table scraps, leftovers, and killed vermin for their 
canine companions.
Enter the livestock feed industry, which began to expand its 
market beyond cattle, hog, and poultry producers to also include 
dog owners. The industry developed different combinations of 

Part I: Preparing to Potty Train Your Pooch 
60
grains and meat products into dog foods that were convenient to 
buy and easy to prepare. As time passed and nutritional knowledge 
accumulated, the quality of some manufactured foods improved. 
This section discusses dry and canned commercial foods as well 
as some special diets.
Forms of commercial dog food
Today’s dog owner has a huge variety of commercial foods from 
which to choose for her dog, but commercial dog foods are 
generally dry or canned. Table 4-1 shows how they compare.

Pet food manufacturers have also come up with all kinds of other 
options for feeding your four-legged friends, including freeze-dried 
foods; semi-moist foods that come in tubes (and make great 
treats); and base-type foods that, when mixed with meat, provide a 
complete meal.

 Chapter 4: Feeding Fido: What Goes In Must Come Out 61
Specially formulated diets
Although the same types of ingredients appear in virtually every 
commercial dog food, the amounts of each vary. Many of these 
variances are deliberate. Pet food manufacturers combine these 
ingredients in different ways to create foods designed to address 
a wide range of conditions and life stages. These special diets 
include the following:
 
✓ Life cycle diets: These dog foods are based on the premise 
that a dog’s age affects what her nutritional requirements are. 
Life cycle diets often include food for young puppies, older 
puppies, adult dogs, and senior dogs. They’ve been a staple of 
the industry for many years.
 
✓ Activity diets: More recently, manufacturers have developed 
higher-protein pet foods designed for certain high-energy 
canine activities. The canine candidates for these specialized 
foods include dogs who are extremely active, dogs who are 
involved in performance activities such as showing and 
agility, and female dogs who are pregnant or nursing puppies.
 
✓ Condition diets: Several pet food companies have developed 
a wide range of dog foods designed to aid in the treatment of a 
dizzying array of conditions. For example, one company has 
developed a food that’s been proven to help extend the lives 
of dogs who have cancer, and other companies are finding 
that high-carbohydrate, lower-protein diets may be a potent 
weapon in combating these dreaded diseases.
 
 Meanwhile, several companies have developed product lines 
that aim to help pooches with food allergies. Such diets fre-
quently eliminate corn, soybeans, or wheat from their foods, 
because some dogs are allergic to these ingredients. These 
foods may substitute lamb or chicken or really exotic proteins 
(would you believe bison or kangaroo?) for beef and also 
include novel carbohydrates such as potatoes or yams.
 
 Other diets aim to aid in the treatment of conditions that 
range from accident recovery to weight management.
Making home-prepped dog foods
Giving your dog home-prepped foods may take more work, but 
you have more control over what goes into your dog’s diet. In this 
section, I discuss cooking meals for your dog and following the 
BARF diet, which is the cornerstone of the raw-foods movement.

Fixing your dog home-cooked meals
Sooner or later, no matter how committed you are to giving your 
dog commercial food, you’re probably going to have to fix a doggie 
dinner yourself. A common reason to give your dog a homemade 
meal is that your four-legged friend has a bout of diarrhea (and 
diarrhea is pretty common among dogs, so this possibility is more 
than likely). Among the remedies your veterinarian probably will 
suggest is to put your dog on a bland diet. This regimen consists of 
gentle, easy-to-digest foods, such as ground beef and rice, that are 
guaranteed to soothe your pooch’s tender tummy and put him well 
along on the road to recovery.
 
Owners can go further than just creating bland diets when a dog 
feels unwell. You may want to give your pooch home-cooked 
fare for a larger portion of his total food intake. Start with these 
titles: The Natural Pet Food Cookbook: Healthful Recipes for Dogs 
and Cats, by Wendy Nan Rees and Kevin Schlanger (Wiley), and 
Holistic Guide for a Healthy Dog, by Wendy Volhard and Kerry 
Brown, DVM (Wiley).
Going raw with the BARF diet
If you decide to find out more about canine feeding options, you’ll 
probably come across the BARF diet. Rest assured that this food 
plan won’t induce bulimia in your dog or anyone else. BARF is an 
acronym for biologically appropriate raw food, and it’s just what it 
sounds like: a food plan in which you feed raw bones, raw meat, 
and fresh vegetables to your canine companion.
Dog owners who favor going raw contend the following:
 
✓ A doggie menu based entirely on uncooked meats, vegetables, 
and bones most closely approximates what wild animals eat. 
Such a diet may allow dogs to live longer, healthier lives.
 
✓ Dogs who eat raw food have cleaner teeth and glossier coats.
 
✓ The BARF diet can bring an end to food allergies and ear 
infections. (My own dog has enjoyed a near-total absence of 
ear infections since I began to BARF her four years ago.)
 
✓ Dogs who’ve gone raw produce stools that are smaller, firmer, 
and easier to pick up than is the case with dogs fed with con-
ventional fare — a great benefit when you’re housetraining!
Many breeders, dog show enthusiasts, and owners of performance 
dogs enthusiastically endorse the BARF diet, as do many veterinar-
ians who practice alternative veterinary medicine.

 Chapter 4: Feeding Fido: What Goes In Must Come Out 63
 
More-traditional vets, along with pet food manufacturers, don’t 
agree with BARF enthusiasts. They worry that raw bones can cause 
internal injuries or choking and note that any use of raw food ups 
the odds of contracting Salmonella or other bacterial poisoning — 
either by the dog or by the person handling the food. Others have 
found that some dogs who eat raw food develop chronic diarrhea 
or vomiting.
 
One formerly formidable argument against the BARF diet — that 
it’s time-consuming and inconvenient to prepare — has pretty 
much evaporated. That’s because several companies now prepare 
and sell raw food for dogs and cats. Among these companies 
are Aunt Jeni’s Home Made (www.auntjeni.com), Bravo! (www.
bravorawdiet.com), and Oma’s Pride (www.omaspride.com). 
These products are hitting more and more pet food specialty 
stores, but if your local outlet doesn’t carry them, check the 
companies’ Web sites to find distributors; I purchase my Allie’s 
raw food through a cooperative that’s run by a local dog trainer 
who doubles as a distributor. Failing that, you may be able to get 
the products of your choice shipped directly to your door.
Feeding a raw diet is not for every dog or for every owner. If the 
idea of handling raw food makes your stomach queasy, bag the 
idea of BARFing and don’t feel guilty about it. And if your dog has a 
compromised immune system or a lot of chronic illnesses, a BARF 
diet probably is not a good choice.
Before you make your decision about BARFing your dog, consult 
some expert sources. A fine book to start with is The Holistic Dog 
Book: Canine Care for the 21st Century, by Denise Flaim (Howell 
Book House).
Giving dogs dietary supplements
You may take a multivitamin every day. If such supplements help you, wouldn’t your 
dog benefit from the same? Well, maybe. The answer depends on your dog and 
how you choose to feed her. For example, if you fix your dog’s food yourself, 
you may need to add supplements such as extra vitamins or fatty acids to ensure 
that she gets the proper balance of nutrients. On the other hand, devotees of 
commercial food may not need to add anything to the food at all.
However, even canine consumers of commercial food need some supplements if 
they’ve been dealing with certain health conditions. For example, your vet may 
prescribe fatty acid supplements if your dog’s coat and skin are excessively dry.
The bottom line on the supplements question is that the answer depends on 
your individual dog. Consider her needs carefully — preferably with the help of your 
veterinarian.

Serving Your Dog
The way you serve your dog can affect his digestion (and thus, 
what he produces) almost as much as what you serve him does. 
This section covers the where, when, and how of feeding your dog, 
plus it includes some dishing about dishes.
Picking the place to feed your dog
Choosing where to feed your dog depends mostly on what works 
for you. The most convenient canine dining room is one that’s 
located close to where you prepare meals, if not actually in the 
same place. In most households, that place is the kitchen, which 
has a couple of advantages:
 
✓ For you, the big plus is that the kitchen is usually the room 
that’s easiest to clean: a big consideration if, like many dogs, 
your four-legged friend doesn’t eat all that neatly.
 
✓ For your dog, the big plus to kitchen dining is that the rest of 
the household usually congregates there. That means a lot to 
a social animal like your canine companion, who’s happiest 
when she’s hanging out with the other members of her pack.
Doggie dining preferences
My late Sheltie, Cory, made it clear to my family that he didn’t like to eat by himself. 
He was a semi-social diner; he liked knowing that I was nearby while he ate his 
breakfast or dinner in the family kitchen. If I left any of the rooms that adjoin the 
kitchen, he’d stop eating and come look for me. To ease his apparent worries, I 
learned to stick around while Cory ate. By contrast, my current canine companion, 
Allie, doesn’t care whether I’m around or not, as long as the food is there. She 
comes looking for me after her meal so she can get her after-meal chewie.
Cory also seemed to prefer that his dining experiences not be overly stimulating. 
Any household activity that diverted or excited him, such as taking the trash outside 
(he apparently believed it was his job to escort the trash-taker to the front door), 
would prompt him to stop eating — at least until the excitement abated.
My husband, daughter, and I learned to cater to Cory’s dining whims. That seemed 
only fair. After all, we made it clear that we expected him to respect our dining 
preferences. For example, we taught him that it’s not nice to stare at human diners, 
no matter how much he may have wanted one of those diners to drop him a morsel 
or two.

 Chapter 4: Feeding Fido: What Goes In Must Come Out 65
 
Dogs don’t like eating anywhere near their bathrooms. If you’re 
training your dog to potty indoors, don’t feed her in the same 
place she does her business. Place her dishes at least a few feet 
away from the indoor potty.
You can also feed your dog in her crate — in fact, doing so can 
help your dog learn her basic bathroom manners more quickly. 
That’s because crate-based dining gives your four-legged friend 
another reason to like this makeshift doggie den. In addition, eating 
in the crate helps a pooch learn to refrain from pooping or peeing 
as soon she’s finished a meal. The reason, of course, is that she 
doesn’t want to soil her den. Many plastic crates include small 
dishes that you can attach to the inside doors.
Setting the canine dining ambience
What sort of dining atmosphere do you prefer? Do you like a 
noisy, hectic, Grand-Central-Station eating experience? Or do you 
prefer a quieter, more low-key dining environment? Do you like 
eating with a crowd? With one or two other people? Alone? Of 
course, those questions don’t have any one correct answer. Every 
response simply reflects the responder’s personal preference. And 
that’s exactly the point. You may have definite ideas about the 
ideal dining experience — and your dog may, too (see the nearby 
sidebar “Doggie dining preferences” for some examples).
 
Although dogs may have individual ideas about how they like to 
dine, a few canine dining concepts apply to all pooches. Here are 
some ideas on how to make mealtime a good time for any dog:
 
✓ Minimize stress. Dogs who are stressed out while eating are 
more likely to have upset stomachs than those whose meal-
times are relatively tranquil. A pooch with a troubled tummy 
may get gassy or even vomit after his meal.
 
✓ Separate siblings. If yours is a multi-dog household, feed each 
canine pack member separately — in different locations and/
or at different times. That way, neither dog will feel the need 
to scarf down his food in order to keep the other pooch from 
grabbing his grub.
 
✓ Let him linger — a little. Your dog deserves a chance to 
savor his breakfast, lunch, or dinner. Give him at least 
15 minutes to finish his meal. However, giving your dog an 
unlimited amount of time to eat is not a good idea. Doing 
so can wreak havoc with potty routines and thus defeat the 
purpose of setting up a feeding schedule. If your dog hasn’t 
finished his meal in 30 minutes, toss it.

Part I: Preparing to Potty Train Your Pooch 
66
 
✓ Wash those dishes. No one, including your dog, likes to eat 
fresh food off dirty dishes. Be sure to wash your dog’s food 
dishes after every meal, either by hand or in the dishwasher. 
Water dishes need daily washing, too.
I truly believe that decoding a dog’s dining desires can make for 
better bathroom behavior. A dog who’s happy with his dining 
environment will eat more regularly — and a dog who eats more 
regularly will probably eliminate more regularly than a dog who’s 
too distracted to attend to what’s in her dish. Any way you look 
at it, what goes in eventually comes out — but what doesn’t go in 
ultimately goes nowhere except to the garbage disposal.
Selecting your dog’s dinnerware
No discussion of how to feed a dog is complete without a little 
dishing about dishes. They come in a wide range of sizes and 
shapes. Your best bet is to choose the one that best fits your dog’s 
size, age, and appetite:
 
✓ A short-faced breed, like a Pug, does well with a wide, 
shallow bowl.
 
✓ A long-eared dog, such as a Cocker Spaniel, fares better with a 
narrow, deep bowl.
 
✓ Puppies may find eating easier with a flying saucer–shaped 
bowl that has a raised center; such a bowl keeps food where 
they can reach it. That kind of bowl can also help dogs who 
otherwise tend to inhale their food to slow down and really 
enjoy it.
Next, consider the material. Experts give a unanimous thumbs-up 
to stainless steel dishes because they’re easy to clean and can’t be 
demolished by a teething puppy.
Ceramic dishes are easy to clean and impervious to chewing. They 
also have the added advantage of weight, which keeps them from 
being knocked over.
 
Imported ceramic bowls — especially those that come from 
Central America — may contain lead, which can be toxic to dogs 
as well as to people. A prudent owner sticks with ceramic dishes 
manufactured in the United States.
Plastic dishes are convenient, cheap, and easy to clean but may 
cause some dogs to lose their nose pigment. In addition, plastic 
dishes aren’t as durable as stainless steel or ceramic.

 Chapter 4: Feeding Fido: What Goes In Must Come Out 67
Deciding when to feed your dog
By making Fido’s mealtimes predictable, you go a long way toward 
making his potty times equally predictable. You want your dog 
to do his bathroom business at regular, predictable intervals, 
which is why putting your canine housetrainee on a regular potty 
schedule — at least until Fido masters his bathroom basics — is 
a good idea. To be fully effective, that potty schedule needs to 
cover feeding times, because most pooches want to potty soon 
after they eat.
Why not free feed?
A generation ago, many people simply scooped a couple of piles of 
kibble into their dogs’ dishes and left those dishes out all day for 
Fido to feast on whenever his stomach growled. Some people still 
do that in a practice experts call free feeding.
Without a doubt, free feeding is a far more convenient way to give 
your dog his grub than remembering to feed Fido at the same 
times every day. However, free feeding carries three major disad-
vantages, at least two of which directly affect a dog’s bathroom 
behavior:
 
✓ Lack of predictability: If food is always available to your 
dog, you may have a tough time determining when he actually 
chows down. Without such knowledge, you can’t really 
anticipate when he’s likely to poop or pee. Consequently, the 
dog who eats whenever he wants may have more trouble 
learning his bathroom basics than the dog whose mealtimes 
are scheduled.
 
✓ Lack of regularity: Determining how much food a dog has 
eaten at any one time is tough if he has 24/7 access to that 
food. That means you won’t realize as quickly whether your 
dog is eating his usual fill. That lack of knowledge may keep 
you from spotting potential health problems.
 
✓ Too much autonomy: By letting your pooch have unfettered 
access to food, you’re foregoing important opportunities to 
reinforce your status as the leader. Every time your dog sees 
you prepare and serve him his food, he realizes that you are 
the Giver of All Good Things. That realization strengthens the 
bond you share and encourages his desire to please you, both 
of which help you teach him the lessons he needs to learn — 
including housetraining.
Setting a schedule for every dog
Frequent meals will help keep your dog in the best of health — 
especially if he’s a young puppy. A juvenile canine needs to eat 

Part I: Preparing to Potty Train Your Pooch 
68
more often than an adult dog does, but even an adult dog may 
need to dine more often than you may suspect. Here are some 
various feeding schedules:
 
✓ Puppies under 4 months: The little ones should get at least 
three meals a day: morning, midday, and early evening. 
Make water available at mealtimes, plus for a little while 
after dinner. Take up the water no later than two hours before 
bedtime, though, or your pup will need a middle-of-the-night 
potty break.
 
✓ Puppies from 4 months to 1 year: These puppies can cut 
back to two meals per day: one in the morning and one in the 
evening. And if they’ve mastered Housetraining 101, they can 
get start getting unlimited water.
 
✓ Adult dogs: Adults do best with two meals a day plus 
unlimited water. Although many grown-up pooches do get 
by with just one big dinner each day, a twice-daily meal plan 
can help forestall a boatload of problems. For example, 
dogs, like people, tend to get sleepy after they eat — which 
means that the dog who gets a good breakfast in the morning 
is more likely to nap than to trash the house if his human 
companion is gone all day. And a good dinner will help him 
sleep more comfortably through the night.
The morning-and-evening regimen can also help prevent physical 
problems. Some, such as flatulence, usually aren’t serious. But one 
deadly condition, bloat, can result if a dog scarfs down a very large 
meal. Large dogs are more likely to be stricken with bloat (also 
known as gastric tortion) than smaller breeds are. For more on 
bloat, see Chapter 10.
Before or after the humans eat?
Some people find that feeding Fido before they eat works well. 
They find that a dog with a full tummy is less likely to try scoring 
table scraps from the human family members while they eat.
Still others favor simultaneous dining: Letting the dog eat at the 
same time that his people do. One undeniable advantage to this 
option is that the dog is too busy eating her own food to worry 
about eating yours, at least for the first few minutes of your meal. 
However, the logistics of preparing human and canine cuisine at 
the same time can prove to be a challenge to people like me, 
whose multitasking ability is somewhat limited!
And some people suggest feeding your dog after the people in the 
house have their meals. They believe that making a dog wait for 
her meals underscores the fact that people outrank the pooches in 
the family pack. They also point out that among wolves observed 

 Chapter 4: Feeding Fido: What Goes In Must Come Out 69
in captivity, the alpha wolf generally eats before the rest of the 
pack does. Consequently, feed-the-dog-last advocates believe that 
alpha people should follow suit when feeding their canine pack 
members.
I don’t advocate any one of these three dining options over the 
others. The right answer varies with each dog and each family. I 
generally feed my dog, Allie, before the rest of my family eats — 
not because she begs for table goodies (we don’t permit such 
behavior in our house) but because the humans in our house tend 
to dine late. For that reason, I give my Golden girl her grub around 
7:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m.
To Treat or Not to Treat
Dogs love to snack and eat treats just as much as people do — but 
the question of whether to give a pooch any treats in housetraining 
can be difficult to answer. Certainly, you can make a good case for 
using treats to train your dog. They’re a great learning incentive; I 
use them liberally when training my own dog and working with 
other people’s pooches. You can use a treat to actually lure a 
dog into sitting or lying down on command (see Figure 4-1). A 
treat makes a great reward for the dog who’s learning to come on 
command and can spark your dog’s learning process in countless 
other ways.
 
A whole segment of expert dog trainers uses treats as the founda-
tion of their training philosophy, known in most circles as positive 
reinforcement. Proponents of positive reinforcement rely on treats 
and other rewards (such as a toy and/or lavish praise) to help a 
dog understand what a person wants the animal to do.
 
Many trainers and other experts — myself included — swear by 
treats as an unbeatable training tool. Treats are a gentle (not to 
mention tasty) way to jump-start a dog’s desire to learn. Just 
follow these guidelines to ensure that your dog’s other lessons 
don’t interfere with his lessons on proper potty protocol:
 
✓ Teach just before mealtimes. Give your dog his lessons in 
sitting, lying down, and other maneuvers just before he eats. 
A hungry dog has more incentive to learn than a dog whose 
tummy is full. And by giving him those treats just before 
mealtime, you probably won’t have to get him to his potty 
immediately after his lesson. You can just feed him and bring 
him to his bathroom after the meal.

Part I: Preparing to Potty Train Your Pooch 
70
Figure 4-1: Treats can be a great teaching tool.
 
✓ Keep treats teensy. A housetrainee needs just a taste of his 
favorite treat to know when he’s doing the right thing. The 
smaller the treat, the less chance that he’ll pork out or get a 
digestive upset.
 
✓ Adjust the main course. Many treats — especially the com-
mercial variety — are incredibly fattening. If you’re giving 
your housetrainee commercial goodies during his house-
training and other lessons, you need to reduce the portions 
you put in his dish at mealtimes. Otherwise, your pooch will 
pork out quickly.
 
✓ Easy does it. If you’re using treats for training, limit giving 
your dog extra goodies at other times — no matter how much 
he may beg for them.
In this section, I name some treats that may be appropriate for 
your dog, including some low-calorie options.
Buying commercial treats
People who decide to add treats to a dog’s diet find an incredible 
assortment of goodies to choose from. Regular supermarket aisles, 
pet boutique floor space, print catalog pages, and online pet store 

 Chapter 4: Feeding Fido: What Goes In Must Come Out 71
bandwidth are clogged with culinary offerings designed to please 
the most discriminating canine palate. Here are some of the more 
common types of commercial treats:
 
✓ Biscuits and cookies: From the been-around-forever offerings 
of Del Monte’s Milk-Bones to the gourmet fare of Three Dog 
Bakery, biscuits and cookies jump-start the appetites of 
countless canines. The fact that most dogs love scarfing down 
biscuits and cookies gives these products a big advantage. 
Another is that their small sizes make them easy for dogs to 
chew and digest. In addition, their crunchy textures provide 
good chewing exercise for dogs and can even help clean a 
canine’s canines (as well as her other teeth).
 
 The downside? Many biscuits and cookies are loaded with 
calories. In addition, some treats can upset the nutritional 
balance that commercial dog foods offers.
 
 If you’re worried about upsetting the nutritional balance 
offered by your dog’s commercial food, try a treat that carries 
the same product name as the main food product. Science 
Diet (by Hills) and California Natural (by Innova) are just two 
product lines that include treats designed to dovetail with 
their regular dog foods.
 
✓ Chew treats: Most dogs adore chomping on chew treats made 
of rawhide, pigs’ ears, cows’ hooves, and other animal parts.
 
 Some dogs may adore chew treats a little too much. These 
chewing maniacs may gnaw off and swallow big chunks of 
such treats, and those chunks can cause internal injuries. For 
that reason, don’t feed chew treats unless you can directly 
supervise your dog. If she has a sensitive stomach, don’t offer 
them at all.
Hot dog! A quick and easy treat
Want to make a fast, can’t-miss treat for your dog? Get some hot dogs, slice them 
up thin, and cook them in your microwave until they’re as crisp as bacon. Afterward, 
drain the slices on some paper towels. Feed these to even the pickiest pooch, and 
he’ll worship the ground you walk on — plus learn his doggie lessons faster than 
you dreamed possible. A treat this tasty can give your dog the incentive to pick up 
just about anything more quickly, including proper potty protocol. Do feed these 
nuked goodies sparingly, though — although hot dogs are delicious, they’re not the 
most nutritious foods for humans or canines.

Part I: Preparing to Potty Train Your Pooch 
72
Preparing homemade treats
If you enjoy making treats for yourself and the other people 
in your household, you may also enjoy making treats for your 
canine family member. Homemade treats offer several advantages 
over commercial fare, the biggest being that you have much 
more control. When you make treats yourself, you know which 
ingredients (and how much of each) go into the treat — an impor-
tant consideration if, for example, your canine companion suffers 
from food allergies. You can also control the size of the treat so 
that it’s just right for your particular dog.
 
Like the idea of giving your dog homemade goodies but don’t know 
where to begin? Type “dog treat recipes” into an Internet search 
engine and dig out thousands of sites that contain recipes to try on 
your four-legged friend. One caution, though: Most of these sites 
don’t include any nutritional analysis — so feed sparingly, no 
matter how much your dog loves the results of your efforts. If 
you’re not computer inclined, your public library undoubtedly has 
plenty of books on dog treats for you to peruse. Or if you want a 
treat recipe book of your very own, check out Liz Palika’s excellent 
tome, The Ultimate Dog Treat Cookbook (Wiley).
 
Never give your dog anything that contains chocolate. Although 
most dogs like it (at least the smell!), chocolate contains an 
ingredient that’s toxic to them. Even a small amount can put your 
dog in dire distress and even kill him.
Choosing low-calorie treat options
Yes, you can give your dog treats without necessarily causing him 
to put on excess poundage. Here are some possibilities:
 
✓ Fruits and vegetables: Many dogs adore raw or frozen fruits 
and vegetables, and because they’re so low in calories, they 
make a terrific treat for the plumper pooch. Good veggies to 
try are carrots, Brussels sprouts, broccoli, and green beans. 
For fruits, consider apples.
 
 Make sure that you offer small pieces of veggies and fruits so 
your four-legged friend can digest those greens and yellows 
easily. And be aware that vegetables contain fiber, which acts 
as a laxative. If you give your pooch too many veggies, he’ll 
need to poop a lot more often.
 
 Don’t feed your dog grapes, raisins, or onions. They contain 
compounds that are toxic to dogs in sufficient quantities. 
Besides, who wants a dog with onion breath?

 Chapter 4: Feeding Fido: What Goes In Must Come Out 73
 
✓ Rice cakes: They may seem utterly devoid of taste to you, 
me, and other human gourmands — but believe me, I have 
seen otherwise discriminating dogs go nuts over the prospect 
of getting a piece of rice cake. One Dachshund of my acquain-
tance started barking madly for hers as soon as she saw 
one of her people getting the package out from the kitchen 
cabinet.
 
✓ Low-cal commercial treats. Some pet food manufacturers 
offer low-calorie versions of their usual dog treats. Try 
giving some to your dog if he doesn’t go for the veggies or 
rice cakes.
The truth about table scraps
You see the warnings in just about every dog care book on the shelves. “Do not feed 
your dog table scraps!” they screech. Their reasons are virtuous and worthy: Rich, 
spicy food from the table gives your dog indigestion — and everyone knows what the 
results of that will be! If you give your dog scraps from the table, you’ll be encouraging 
him to adopt the obnoxious habit of begging. And no matter how you present those 
scraps, you’ll upset the nutritional balance of his carefully formulated dog food.
Good reasons, all. There’s just one problem: Almost everyone I know gives their canine 
companion food from the table at one time or another. Holidays are one example. Even 
a pooch who’s never eaten anything but dry food for dinner will turn those big-guilt-
inducing eyes on her people when they sit down to an elaborate feast.
Instead of sticking with the no-table-scraps prohibition that everyone ignores, here 
are a few guidelines for giving your dog an occasional people-food treat:
 ✓ Don’t feed from the table. The experts are right on this one; feeding anything from 
the table encourages your dog to beg. I don’t like being stared at while I eat, and 
you probably don’t, either. Don’t let the habit start in the first place. Instead, put the 
goodies directly into your dog’s dish.
 ✓ Don’t give real garbage. You wouldn’t feed yourself the germ-ridden food thrown 
into the garbage, would you? Well, your dog shouldn’t get that food, either.
 ✓ Nix fats and spices. Foods laden with fats and spices upset your dog’s stomach. 
Few events put more of a damper on a holiday dinner than having to clean up 
the results of that tummy upset, especially if that upset occurs near the dinner 
table. Even worse, fatty foods can induce inflammation of the pancreas — in 
vetspeak, pancreatitis — which can be a life-threatening disease. Excess salt can 
encourage drinking and extra potty breaks.
So which table scraps are okay? If you’re sharing Thanksgiving dinner with your dog, 
you can safely give him a little bit of the turkey white meat (the dark meat is too fatty). 
Veggies please many canine palates, too; just go easy on them, or your dog will poop 
more than usual.

Working with Your Dog’s 
Drinking Habits
Dogs need water for the same reasons that people do: to regulate 
their body temperature, to shuttle nutrients via the bloodstream 
from the digestive system to anywhere else the body needs 
them, and to transport waste products in the form of urine outside 
the body via urination. But although all dogs need water for the 
same reasons, the amount of water they need varies from pooch 
to pooch. Dogs who are very active and/or eat a lot of food — 
especially dry food — need to drink more water than more 
sedentary canines, those who eat less, and/or those whose diets 
include some canned or moist fare.
Healthy, housetrained dogs can regulate their water intake all by 
themselves. They drink when they’re thirsty and don’t drink when 
they’re not. Meeting the water needs of these dogs is simple: Keep 
water available at all times.
 
Keeping water available does not mean just topping the water off 
throughout the day or week. A dog needs totally fresh water in a 
dish that you wash at least once a day. Change the water itself at 
least once a day or anytime you see stuff — for example, little bits 
of food residue — floating in the water.
That said, 24/7 access to water can pose a problem for the canine 
housetrainee. To anticipate when your dog may need to let some 
water out — in other words, to pee — you need to have some 
idea of when he took that water in. The best way to acquire that 
knowledge is to control his access to the water bowl. Make no 
mistake: The dog who’s just learning basic bathroom manners 
needs frequent opportunities to drink. But you need to know when 
he takes advantage of those opportunities — and the best way to 
gain that knowledge is to give him a full dish of clean water several 
times a day — at the very least, at the same time as every meal — 
at the same times each and every day.
 
If your dog suddenly starts drinking more water than usual — and 
consequently starts peeing more often than usual — he may well 
be sick. Chapter 10 outlines some of the maladies that increased 
water intake may signify and what you can do about them.
 
Just as distilled or filtered water can improve a human being’s 
health, so can it do good things for the health of a dog. A prime 
potential benefit: preventing the formation of certain types of 
bladder stones, which can be life-threatening if left untreated. 
Distilled or filtered water doesn’t contain any of the minerals that 
cause stones to form.

T
he crate is crucial not only to successful housetraining but 
also, in my view, to successful puppy-raising. Not only does a 
crate capitalize on your pooch’s instinctive desire not to dirty her 
den — and thus learn to hold her poop and pee until she can do 
so in the right place — but it also gives you a safe place to put 
your puppy when you can’t keep your eye on her, including while 
you sleep at night. And believe me, a puppy (or in many cases, 
even an adult dog) needs a human’s eagle eye to prevent her from 
engaging in mischief such as unfurling the toilet paper, diving into 
the garbage, or chewing on the legs of your dining room chairs.
But the crate’s benefits extend not only to you; they also include 
your four-legged friend. The crate is a place where your dog can 
retreat whenever she needs a break from everyday household 
mayhem, wants a little alone time, or needs to escape from what 
she perceives to be big, bad, scary machinery such as vacuum 
cleaners.
Unfortunately, though, the benefits of crates may not be readily 
apparent to your canine companion — at least not at first. Instead 
of considering it to be her own special space, a dog may view 
the crate as a canine prison to which she’s received a lifetime 
sentence. That’s why you can’t simply put your dog into the crate, 
shut the door, and walk away any more than you can teach a child 
to swim by bringing him to deep water and then expecting him to 
paddle his way back to shore.
You need to introduce your canine companion to her crate 
carefully. This chapter helps you do just that, and it also gives 
you some ideas for helping your canine companion change

her mind about her crate if she already hates it. (For info on 
selecting and outfitting a crate and deciding where to put it, go to 
Chapter 3.)
Introducing the Crate
To help your canine companion appreciate her crate, introduce 
her to it immediately but gradually. If possible, start on the very 
same day you welcome her into your home. In this section, I 
explain what to do as you introduce your dog to her crate. This 
process should take only a day or two, unless your four-legged 
friend has had a prior negative experience with the crate. If that’s 
the case with your dog, expect the process to take longer.
Tie one on: The open-door policy
No, no, no — I am not suggesting that the way to help your dog 
learn to love her crate is for you to head around the corner to 
the nearest pub and party hearty. Instead, you need to make the 
crate, particularly the door, nonthreatening to your four-legged 
friend. A door that suddenly slams shut while your dog is getting 
accustomed to the crate can spook your pooch into bypassing the 
crate completely.
 
Before you introduce the crate to your little Fidette, use a string or 
a prop to keep the crate door open. That way, when she explores 
the crate, a sudden accidental slamming of the door won’t put your 
pup off the crate.
Encourage exploration
As soon as you have the crate door securely open, encourage your 
puppy or dog to check out the crate. Begin by letting her walk 
around the crate to sniff and otherwise explore it. If she hesitates, 
throw little treats around the perimeter.
When your puppy approaches the crate comfortably, see whether 
you can induce her to venture inside the crate — again with the 
help of a tasty treat. If your housetrainee isn’t food-motivated, a 
favorite toy may do the trick. Either way, toss the treat or toy 
inside the crate. If she goes in readily, praise her; if she’s hesitant, 
tell her in a high, happy-sounding voice to go and get the goodies.
 
Don’t force her in; let her decide on her own to enter the crate. 
And when she does, let her know what a good girl she is. This may 
take some time; be prepared to spend an afternoon or so helping 
her with this crucial step.

 Chapter 5: Training to Love the Crate 79
 
Whenever your puppy enters the crate (or whenever you put her 
in it), use a word that tells her what she’s doing and where she’s 
going. Good choices are crate, place, bed, or any other word that 
you know you’ll use consistently. By saying this same word in a 
high, happy tone of voice whenever your dog enters her crate, 
you’ll help her associate the word with the crate — and as I explain 
in the sidebar titled “Nighty-Night: Getting your dog to go in her 
den when asked,” she’ll soon begin to head into the crate as soon 
as you, well, say the word.
Shut the door (but not for long)
If your puppy repeatedly enters her crate without hesitation, untie 
the door. Toss a treat inside the crate. When your pooch enters, 
shut the door quietly without locking it. Leave it shut for just a few 
seconds.
During those few seconds, praise your pooch lavishly, and then 
open the door and coax her out. Another tiny treat should provide 
sufficient incentive for her to emerge.
Perform this sequence five to ten times during the day, gradually 
increasing the amount of time the door remains closed, until your 
puppy is able to remain calmly in the crate for about 5 minutes.
Nighty-night: Getting your dog 
to go in her den when asked
When I was housetraining Allie, my Golden Retriever, I ended up teaching her 
something else without even realizing it: going into her crate when asked.
That’s because every time I put Allie into her crate, I would tell her “nighty- night” 
in a soft, baby-talk sort of voice. Before very long, Allie figured out all by herself that 
“nighty-night” meant that it was time for her to head to her crate. Even now, six 
years later, if I tell her, “Allie, time to go nighty-night,” my Golden girl trots into her 
crate, no matter where she is in our house.
The nighty-night maneuver comes in handy if, for example, you have a repair person 
coming into your house and you don’t want Daisy and the repair person to meet. In 
fact, for any situation in which you need to confine your dog, the ability to send your 
dog to her crate on command is a useful skill.
Of course, you don’t need to use the term nighty-night to get your dog to head to her 
crate on cue. Other words work just as well. I just love to see my big 70-pound 
Golden girl — who at most times is quite the diva and has a mind of her own — walk 
with such docility into her crate while I coo “nighty-night” to her.

Leave the room
After your puppy can stay calmly in the crate for 5 minutes, you’re 
ready for the next step, which is to have her stay calmly in her 
crate without you there. Once again, lure your pooch into her 
crate — but this time, use something more substantial than a treat 
or two. A full meal dispensed into a crate dish is a good choice 
(or use a food-stuffed toy — see the sidebar titled “No dishes? No 
problem!” for details).
When your pup is in her crate, shut the door quietly and leave the 
room for about a minute. When you return, see what your puppy’s 
doing. If she’s eating her meal or gnawing her chew toy contentedly, 
leave the room again and come back in a few more minutes. Keep 
No dishes? No problem!
Maybe your dog’s crate doesn’t come with dishes, or maybe you just find them too 
cumbersome, messy, or awkward to use. That’s okay. You have another option for 
keeping your dog occupied while she’s in the crate: filling an interactive toy with food 
and/or treats.
Take a toy such as a Kong (you can find one at any pet supply store or at the Kong Web 
site, www.kongcompany.com) or other food-dispensing plaything and slather 
some peanut butter on the inside. Then fill the toy with treats, or even regular food, and 
pack it tight. Put the stuffed toy inside your pooch’s crate. Chances are, she’ll make a 
beeline for the toy, get immediately to work trying to ferret out the goodies you’ve 
shoehorned into it, and not even notice that you’ve closed the door.
If you really want to challenge your housetrainee, put the treat-stuffed toy in a plastic 
bag and into your freezer for a couple of hours. Then remove it from the freezer, take 
the toy out of the bag, and hand it over to your dog, who by now is probably salivating. 
The food stuffed inside the toy will be even tougher for your four-legged friend 
to extract.
This trick works not only for crate training but also for other training situations. For 
example, dogs with separation anxiety often do very well if their owners give them 
food-stuffed interactive toys just before they leave the house. The dogs are so 
engrossed in getting the goodies that they don’t even realize their people have 
left — and afterward, their contented tummies may well induce them to take a 
post-snacking nap.
Of course, if you make a regular practice of giving your pooch a meal in one of her toys, 
make sure you adjust her other meal portions accordingly. That way, she’ll retain her 
girlish figure as she works her way to becoming a housetraining graduate.

 Chapter 5: Training to Love the Crate 81
checking until she’s finished; when she’s done, let her out of the 
crate and praise her lavishly for her accomplishment. Give her a 
special treat to emphasize to her how pleased you are.
Build up her tolerance
You’re now ready for the final step in your puppy’s Loving the 
Crate 101 course: building up her tolerance for being in the crate 
by herself. This one should be easy: Keep feeding her inside the 
crate until she’s able to stay in it for half an hour. Then try leaving 
the house for a few minutes, gradually extending the time that 
you’re away. At this point, she should handle crate time without 
any problem.
If, at any point in this process, your dog starts to whine or cry, 
you may be moving too quickly. Help for the whiny crate trainee 
appears in the next section.
Encouraging Appreciation If 
Your Dog Hates the Crate
Alas, not every dog appreciates a crate. An adult dog who’s never 
been inside a crate may think it’s a prison, not a haven. A puppy-
mill pooch who spent his babyhood cramped inside a crate that 
was too small and who was forced to eliminate while inside that 
crate may not think the crate you’ve purchased is such a great 
idea, either.
Either way, a dog who hesitates to enter a crate for the first time 
probably just needs some patience from you and a clear incentive 
to give the crate a try. Find a treat that your dog is passionate 
about and hold it to his nose so that he knows what’s being 
offered. Then use a high-pitched, happy-sounding tone of voice to 
encourage him to enter the crate. As soon as he makes the big step 
and ventures inside the crate, praise him to the skies. Above all, 
don’t shut the door until he’s going in and out of the crate without 
hesitation.
Some dogs balk when they’re left alone in the crate for the first 
time. If that’s the case with your pooch, stay away for just a minute 
or so after he starts fussing. Then come back into the room and 
reassure him with a quick “good boy” or “good dog.” Leave the 
room again for just a few seconds — and if he stays quiet for that 
brief time, come back to let him out of the crate and praise him. 
The important thing here is not to let him out of the crate until he 
stops fussing.

Many young puppies object to being put in crates at night during 
their first few nights in a new home. They cry pitifully and otherwise 
carry on, tempting their soft-hearted people to scoop them out of 
their crates and allow them to sleep with them in their own beds. 
This is a temptation that you should do your very best not to give in 
to. The nearby sidebar titled “Not on my bed, you don’t” explains 
why and provides advice for dealing with this common situation.
Not on my bed, you don’t
When President Obama and his family first acquired Bo, their Portuguese Water 
Dog, a reporter asked the president whether Bo would sleep on any of the White 
House beds. The Chief Executive’s firm response was, “Not on my bed.” He also 
indicated that the First Dog would not be sleeping on either of his daughters’ 
beds, either. Bo is the first dog the Obamas have owned, but they’ve made the right 
decision in opting to keep Bo off their beds.
Puppies and human beds don’t mix for several reasons. First, there’s the possibility 
that the puppy will wander from where he’s sleeping to somewhere else on your 
bed and decide (yuck) to do his business there. Second, he could fall off the bed 
and hurt himself. And third, it sets a bad precedent for a relationship in which you’re 
trying to establish yourself as his leader — a loving, benevolent leader but a leader 
nevertheless.
So what should you do if your puppy balks at being in his crate at night? Here are 
some ideas:
 ✓ Keep the crate in your bedroom. Just because you don’t allow your dog on your 
bed doesn’t mean that he can’t sleep in the same room with you. Simply bring 
the crate into your bedroom with you at bedtime. For many puppies and dogs, 
simply being in the same room as their people is enough to calm them and allow 
everyone to get a good night’s sleep.
 ✓ Dangle your fingers. For a few people-loving puppies, being in their humans’ 
bedrooms doesn’t offer enough proximity to their humans. (My Allie was one of 
these puppies.) If that’s the case with your new four-legged friend, bring his 
crate right up next to your bed and dangle your fingers in front of the crate door 
every time he cries. Chances are, he’ll sniff your fingers and quiet down.
 ✓ Stay positive. Scolding your puppy, using a shake can, banging on the crate, or 
any other negative response to his whining usually won’t keep him quiet — or 
if it does, not for very long. Staying positive helps him associate the crate with 
pleasant occurrences.
 ✓ Check the time. If your puppy continues to cry — and if he’s under 4 months of 
age — he may need a potty break. Most puppies younger than 4 months can’t 
hold it all night long. Take a look at what time it is: If your puppy’s whining any 
time after 2 a.m. or so and several hours have passed since his previous pit 
stop, haul yourself out of bed and take him to his potty spot.

 Chapter 5: Training to Love the Crate 83
If you’ve done your best but there’s no way your dog will accept 
the crate, don’t despair. For a few pooches, particularly puppy-mill 
dogs and their offspring, as well as dogs who suffer from severe 
separation anxiety, the crate will never be the cozy den it repre-
sents to the vast majority of canines. For these dogs, the solution 
is to create an indoor home-alone area that’s less enclosed than a 
crate is but still protects your home while the dogs learn proper 
potty protocol. Suggestions for creating this special indoor potty 
are in Chapter 11.
 
A dog who suffers from separation anxiety — in other words, 
panics and becomes destructive when left alone — can benefit 
from professional help. An experienced trainer can help you 
teach your anxious pooch that solitude is okay. In severe cases, a 
veterinarian can prescribe medication that helps to lessen the 
dog’s anxiety.
Limiting Crate Time: How 
Much Is Too Much?
As you’ve undoubtedly discovered, I’m a passionate advocate of 
crate training, keeping your four-legged friend in her doggie den 
whenever you can’t watch her directly and letting her out for meal-
times, potty breaks, and playtime. Nothing, in my view, makes the 
whole teaching Doggie Bathroom Manners 101 process easier than 
having a crate that capitalizes on your dog’s instinctive desire to 
keep her den clean. But that said, it’s entirely possible that use of a 
crate can be too much of a good thing — and even cruel to your 
four-legged friend.
Too many people embrace the crate a little too tightly and turn it 
into a canine warehouse. They put their dogs into their crates 
in the morning, go out all day, and then come home in the evening 
to let their pooches out. Yes, the furniture and rugs are free of 
destruction, dog poop, and other hazards that are part of sharing 
one’s life with a dog. But confining your dog to a crate for that long 
is inhumane — even if she can hold it all day.
 
Not only does crating your dog for too long cause her discomfort 
in bowel and bladder — possibly even causing a urinary tract 
infection — but you also deprive your dog of exercise, mental 
stimulation, and your company, all of which can cause her to 
develop a distaste for her crate. And if she can’t hold her poop and 
pee, you’ve really made things tough for her, because you’ve 
forced her to dirty her den and then stay in that dirt until you let 
her out.

Part II: Putting a Plan in Place 
84
Generally, I don’t think it’s fair to confine even a fully housetrained 
dog to a crate for more than 4 or 5 hours at a time. And as you can 
see in Chapters 6 and 7, dogs who are still developing their basic 
bathroom manners need to be let out of their crates much more 
often. That said, it’s okay to crate a dog overnight after she’s demon-
strated that she can hold it for that long (generally after a puppy 
reaches 4 months of age). But keep that crate with you in your bed-
room so she can share space with you and you can hear her if she 
has a problem or needs a middle-of-the-night pit stop after all (for 
example, if she’s suffering from a urinary infection or diarrhea).
 
If you think your schedule or your home décor requires all-day 
crate confinement for your dog, you need to explore other options. 
Here’s what you can do:
 
✓ Come home at lunch. If your workplace is close to your 
home, make a quick trip there during your lunch break to 
give your four-legged friend a much-needed potty break.
 
✓ Hire a dog walker. Urban and suburban areas abound with 
pet sitters and dog walkers who are more than happy to 
spring your pooch each day for a reasonable fee. Check out 
your newspaper classifieds, your veterinarian’s office, or an 
online source such as Craigslist (www.craigslist.org).
 
✓ Enlist a neighbor. If you have a dog-loving neighbor who 
stays home during the day, maybe she’d be willing to come 
visit your dog and walk him at noontime. Of course, if you 
embark on such an arrangement, make sure that you’re 
willing to offer her services that she needs, such as watering 
her plants and picking up her mail whenever she goes away.
 
✓ Bring your pooch to work. Many workplaces allow their 
employees to bring their well-behaved dogs to work. Check 
with your company’s human resources department to 
see whether your company is one of these dog-friendly 
treasures. If so, you can take your-legged friend out of his 
crate periodically for a walk and a potty break.
 
✓ Consider doggie day care. More and more cities and towns 
offer cage-free doggie day care to give the confined canine a 
more pleasurable day. See whether yours is one of them.
Continuing to Use the Crate
After your dog becomes a fan of the crate, you can adopt a few 
measures to help her keep those good feelings. Crates have many 
benefits beyond housetraining, so maintaining that appreciation is 
well worth the effort. In this section, I explain how to do just that, 
and I name some other ways you and your canine companion can 
use the crate.

 Chapter 5: Training to Love the Crate 85
Keeping the love alive
 
You need to do your part to make sure that the crate continues to 
be something your dog loves. Here are some ways to do just that:
 
✓ Potty first. If you plan to have your puppy or dog stay in her 
crate while you leave the house, give her an opportunity to 
poop or pee beforehand. A before-the-crate bathroom break 
greatly decreases the odds that your four-legged friend will go 
to the bathroom while she’s in the crate.
 
✓ Let her settle. If you’re crating your puppy or dog in her crate 
while you go out to run errands, put her there a few minutes 
before you depart. That way, she’ll have a chance to settle 
herself before you head out the door.
 
✓ Downplay comings and goings. Don’t make a big deal of 
putting your dog in her crate when you leave or of letting 
her out when you arrive home. Big, emotional hellos and 
goodbyes can put your dog on emotional overload, making 
settling down in the crate tougher for her to handle.
 
✓ Potty last. Just as you took her to her potty before you left, 
do the same thing when you arrive home. A dog who’s held 
her poop and pee while crated needs and deserves the con-
sideration of a bathroom break as soon as possible thereafter.
Beyond housetraining: Other 
uses for the crate
Even after your puppy or dog is housetrained, you and your dog 
will still find the crate useful. Here are some other roles a crate 
can play:
 
✓ A room of her own: In addition to using the crate as a safe 
place in which to avoid fearsome vacuum cleaners and 
get herself some space during my family’s TV time, my Allie 
occasionally uses her crate as a place to stash toys and 
treats. (Unfortunately, she soon forgets that she’s done so.)
 
✓ A place away from visitors: The crate’s a great place for your 
dog to stay if you have repair personnel or other visitors 
come into your home. Even if your dog is a social butterfly, 
your guests may appreciate not having to deal with sloppy 
doggie kisses and shedding. And if your dog is more reserved, 
she’ll appreciate having a place to retreat to when strangers 
come around.

Part II: Putting a Plan in Place 
86
 
✓ A safe way to travel: The crate is a safe place for your dog to 
be when you’re both traveling by car — and it’s required if 
you’re both traveling by air and the dog is too large to join 
you in the passenger cabin.
 
✓ A home away from home: Many hotels and motels that 
generally frown on accommodating animals may cut you a 
break if you can tell them your dog will be crated. And if 
you think that you’ll visit only pet-friendly hotels, well, you 
may not have that option. If you and your dog find yourselves 
having to leave your home to outrun a natural disaster 
such as a hurricane, having a crate can save the day (not to 
mention your pet’s life) when you’re both scrambling to find 
a safe shelter.
 
 Crates are also great when you’re visiting relatives or friends 
in their homes and want to bring your dog along. She’ll be 
a lot more comfortable having a familiar home away from 
home, and your hosts will be more comfortable knowing that 
your dog has a place to be that will keep her from damaging 
their stuff.
 
✓ A place to heal: The crate may serve as a recovery room 
for your dog if she undergoes orthopedic surgery such as 
anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) repair (a common problem 
that big dogs such as Labrador Retrievers face). In fact, 
many veterinarians require that their canine ACL patients 
be on what they call crate rest for at least several weeks after 
surgery. Under such circumstances, the dog who’s accus-
tomed staying in her crate and liking it will fare far better than 
her crate-hating counterpart. The same situation applies if 
your dog is being treated for heartworm.
Any way you look at the crate, though, the bottom line is that 
a dog who has gotten a good start with one is probably going 
to have a good start with housetraining and every other kind of 
training. Showing your dog that her crate is something to love is 
worth every bit of effort you and she make.

I
f you’re like most people, you’re planning to teach your puppy 
or adult dog to do his business outdoors. There’s one very 
good reason to consider keeping a dog’s bathroom business out-
doors: not wanting to deal with dog doo inside one’s house.
Face it: No one truly likes to deal with canine waste (I’m having fun 
writing about it, but that’s a whole other issue). Doggie doo stinks, 
and so does doggie pee. Plus, both stain any fabrics that they touch. 
Worst of all, dog poop is full of germs, bacteria, and other unlovely 
organisms that can literally sicken both you and your dog.
Beyond the obvious, though, are plenty of other good reasons to 
teach a dog to limit his bathroom maneuvers to outdoor turf. For 
one thing, the owner of an outdoor-trained dog doesn’t have to 
allocate one bit of floor space to newspapers, litter boxes, or other 
types of dog potties. In addition, the outdoor potty can go just 
about anywhere that you and your dog go; all you need are some 
bags with which to perform cleanup. Finally, outdoor time with 
your dog is good for both your mental health and his.
This chapter shows you how to teach your dog to potty outdoors, 
no matter what his age.

Part II: Putting a Plan in Place   
88
Understanding How Outdoor 
Training Works
Outdoor training is the process of teaching your dog to eliminate 
only when he’s outside. You can consider your pooch to be suc-
cessfully outdoor-trained if she consistently holds her poop and 
pee until you take her outside — or if she takes herself there.
Achieving such success can be surprisingly simple. Every time you 
think your dog needs a potty break, you take her outside to her 
potty spot to do her business. At first, you do this according to a 
set schedule. Sometimes, though, your dog needs to diverge from 
that schedule — and in all likelihood, she’ll communicate some-
how that she needs to go. (Chapter 8 tells you how she’s most 
likely to communicate that need and how you can teach her to ask 
you for a bathroom break in a way that you’ll readily understand.)
At all other times, you either confine her to her crate or watch her 
continuously for those pre-potty communications. The objectives 
here are to prevent accidents from occurring and to encourage 
your dog to do her business outdoors — and outdoors only. Within 
a matter of weeks, she understands that it’s okay to potty outside 
and takes it upon herself to make sure that she doesn’t eliminate 
inside.
Outdoor training needn’t be difficult, but it does require time, 
attention, and patience from you. Training puppies takes a little 
more work than training an adult dog — for one thing, puppies 
need more potty breaks — but either way, you can introduce your 
dog to her potty spot, set up a schedule, and get training off to a 
good start.
Introducing Puppies to 
Outdoor Training
The great thing about outdoor training is that you can start doing 
it right away. And if you’re really lucky, your puppy’s breeder has 
started the process for you. In this section, you find out how to 
show your dog his potty spot, how to encourage your dog with 
verbal cues, and how to develop a pup-sized training schedule.

 Chapter 6: Heading to the Outside: Outdoor Housetraining 89
Getting an early start
Many breeders start introducing puppies to doing their business 
outdoors when the pups reach the age of 4 or 5 weeks. This is the 
time when the mama dog starts to push the puppies out of the 
den so that they don’t do their business anywhere nearby. A good 
breeder often gives the mother some help by taking the puppies 
outside in nice weather and encouraging them to eliminate there.
 
If your breeder hasn’t started outdoor training, or if your puppy 
comes from an animal shelter or rescue group, you can set the 
process in motion even before you and your puppy hit the road 
and head for home. Start by asking for a piece of paper towel or 
cloth that’s scented with a bit of the pup’s urine. You’ll use this 
pre-scented cloth to help your puppy figure out where he can potty.
Taking the first trips outside
Housetraining can and should start as soon as you bring your new 
friend home. In this section, I describe when and how the first 
outdoor bathroom breaks should occur.
Visiting the potty spot after the ride home
As soon as you and your puppy arrive home for the first time, 
take your puppy to the outdoor potty area you’ve chosen (see 
Chapter 3 for tips on choosing one). Car rides often trigger a 
puppy’s I-gotta-go-right-now reflex, so let him do the doo and/or 
take a whiz before you head into the house. Place a cloth scented 
with your puppy’s urine on the ground and let your puppy sniff it. 
Then, when your puppy opens his floodgates and/or makes a solid 
deposit, praise him enthusiastically. Let him know that he’s done 
exactly what you wanted him to do. (Check out the later section 
“Responding when your puppy potties” for details.)
If he doesn’t go, give him a little more time to explore. And even if he 
does eliminate, don’t head back into the house right away. Many 
puppies need to pee two or three times during a potty break before 
they’re completely empty.
 
If the outdoor potty area is in an unfenced area of your yard, leash 
your puppy before taking him to do the doo.

Part II: Putting a Plan in Place

Taking your pup out after he sees the house
After your puppy does his business outdoors, take your puppy 
inside and let him explore your abode for a little while — but keep 
an eagle eye trained on your new friend. You need to watch for any 
signal that he’s about to do a repeat potty performance. Here are 
some signs he’s just seconds away from unloading:
 
✓ He calls a sudden halt to his investigations.
 
✓ He begins to sniff in a direct and purposeful manner.
 
✓ He starts walking around in a circle.
 
✓ He actually begins to drop his bottom downward.
Quickly — and I do mean quickly — scoop him up and take him out-
side to the same spot he anointed or pooped on earlier. The odor 
of his previous encounter will probably prompt him to perform an 
encore there. When he does, praise him and give him a treat.
If for some reason you don’t see any signs that he’s about to go 
and he surprises you with a little puddle or pile, say nothing. 
Simply clean up the mess — and promise yourself that you’ll watch 
your little darling more carefully in the future. (Meanwhile, check 
out Chapter 8, which describes pre-potty signals in detail.)
After your puppy explores his new home for about an hour, he’ll 
probably be pretty tired. Put him in his crate so he can snooze for 
a little while. Do keep an eye on him, though, so you can see when 
he wakes up. That’s because a puppy who’s just up from a nap is 
often a puppy who needs to pee. Take your little sleepyhead to his 
potty spot, and when he does his business, praise him and give 
him a tiny treat.
For your puppy’s first day or two in your home, take him out every 
hour or two. After you’re familiar with his habits, you can set up 
a schedule, as I discuss later in “A matter of timing: Setting up a 
puppy potty schedule.”
Responding when your puppy potties
The way you behave while your puppy potties can either speed up 
or slow down his outdoor housetraining progress. That’s because 
puppies have very short attention spans, and they can have a hard 
time staying focused during their potty breaks. Your behavior can 
either help your little guy get down to business or make him forget 
to do his business.

 Chapter 6: Heading to the Outside: Outdoor Housetraining 91
Going out to the potty spot
To help your puppy concentrate on bathroom activities, get him 
thinking about those activities before you reach the potty spot. As 
the two of you head out to your pup’s bathroom, ask him, “Do you 
want to go potty?” or announce to him, “It’s potty time!” in a lively, 
can’t-wait-to-get-out-there tone. Use the same expression and same 
tone of voice every time you take little Fido out, and soon he’ll 
associate both with heading out to the bathroom.
Take the fastest, most direct route to the potty area and use the 
same route every time your puppy needs a bathroom break. Your 
consistency conditions little Fido to expect that when he treads 
that path, he’s going to eliminate shortly thereafter.
 
As you go to the potty spot, make sure you don’t walk him any-
where near the mailbox or your prize rhododendron. The dog 
should not be allowed to pee just anywhere, particularly in the 
housetraining process. Even after your dog is housetrained, if 
you’re walking him outside, keep him off other people’s lawns and 
confine his bathroom activities to the median strip between the 
sidewalk and street.
 
Have treats at the ready — in your coat pocket, in a small dish 
from which you can grab one or two — so you’ll be able to give 
your puppy one of those treats while the two of you are outdoors. 
It’s important to reward him immediately after he does his good 
deed so that he associates the reward with the deed.
Letting your pup do his business
When the two of you arrive at the potty spot, don’t do anything. 
Don’t talk to your puppy and don’t play with him until he’s figured 
out where he’s going to go and is clearly about to do so. Let him 
walk around a little bit — no farther than the length of a 6-foot 
leash — and don’t let him leave the area until he’s unloaded.
 
As your little guy squats (male puppies don’t start lifting their legs 
to pee until they’re older, and most females never do), give him a 
command such as “Go potty” or “Do your business.” Repeat this 
phrase every time he eliminates. By doing so, you up your puppy’s 
chances of learning to pee and poop on command — a handy skill 
for him to have. (More info on how to teach your dog to poop and 
pee on command — and what to do if he’s one of those dogs who 
can’t or won’t acquire this skill — is in Chapter 8.)
As soon as your puppy is finished, praise him for his performance 
in a high, happy-sounding voice (but don’t get too loud, or you may 
scare the little guy). Give him a very small treat, take him for a walk, 
play with him, and indulge in a love fest. You’ve both earned it!

A matter of timing: Setting up a 
puppy potty schedule
Putting your puppy on a regular potty schedule can shorten his 
housetraining learning curve considerably. Your pup, even at his 
young age, is a creature of habit. He learns through repetition. 
If you take him out to pee and poop at the same times each and 
every day, his body will become accustomed to that schedule. 
He’ll be conditioned to do his business at the times you want him 
to do it.
A regular potty schedule also eases your job as your dog’s care-
giver. That’s because a change in a dog’s regular bathroom 
behavior often signals that he’s sick. But if your dog potties unpre-
dictably, you won’t be able to pick up any such signals.
 
During your puppy’s first few days at home, you should note — 
preferably in writing if your memory is anywhere near as bad as 
mine is — when he goes and whether he poops, pees, or does 
both. You’re likely to see a pattern emerge that can help you antici-
pate when your new family member needs to eliminate. You can 
use that knowledge to create a sleeping, feeding, and bathroom 
schedule to help your four-legged friend become a housetraining 
expert in a surprisingly short time.
What if he doesn’t go?
Sometimes, a puppy just won’t eliminate — even though you think it’s time for him 
to do some doo. If you’ve been out for more than five minutes and your puppy hasn’t 
pooped or peed, take him back inside. But watch him like a hawk; don’t take your 
eyes off him. Look for signs that he needs to go: circling, pacing, intense sniffing, 
a sudden stop in the middle of an activity. The second you see any such signs, get 
him back outside. If you can’t watch him, put him in his crate.
Whether he’s in his crate or out on the floor with you, take him out again after 
20 minutes. If he goes, praise him, treat him, and take him back inside for some 
supervised playtime. If he doesn’t go, put him back in his crate, wait another 20 
minutes or so, and head back outside. Eventually he will go; he can’t hold that poop 
or pee forever. Praise him lavishly and give him a teensy treat when he finally does 
unload.

 Chapter 6: Heading to the Outside: Outdoor Housetraining 93
 
When you put together a potty schedule for your puppy, keep in 
mind that most juvenile canines need to poop and/or pee at the 
following times:
 
✓ First thing in the morning
 
✓ Last thing at night
 
✓ During the night (if the puppy is under 4 months of age)
 
✓ After energetic playing
 
✓ After being confined in a crate
 
✓ After a nap
 
✓ After chewing on a toy or a bone
 
✓ A few minutes after eating
Armed with this knowledge, along with your observations of your 
dog’s individual potty pattern, you can create a schedule that gives 
your puppy enough time to pee or poop and also gives you some 
predictability. Table 6-1 shows how you may structure a schedule 
for a 3-month-old pup. Note that all trips outside are just to the 
potty spot — the puppy should come inside after he’s finished 
unloading. Note, too, that puppies younger than 3 months are 
likely to need go out more often. (This schedule requires someone 
to be home during the day to give the puppy daytime potty breaks. 
If you can’t be your little darling’s daytime bathroom escort, check 
out Chapter 11.)

You may be groaning inwardly at the prospect of having to take your 
four-legged friend outside for a middle-of-the-night potty break. Alas, 
that’s one of the few disadvantages of raising a puppy instead of 
an adult dog. A canine youngster who’s under 3 or 4 months of age 
just can’t hold his poop or pee for the entire night any more than a 
human infant can sleep through the night without filling his diaper. 
So when your puppy fidgets, whines, or cries in the middle of night, 
know that he probably has a very good reason to do so. Heed his 
plea and take him out.
Know that as your puppy gets older, he won’t need to go outside in 
the middle of the night. The same will be true of the midmorning, 
midafternoon, and 7:00 p.m. pit stops, as well as the noontime feed-
ing. Think twice, though, about giving him unsupervised freedom in 
your house, even if he’s completely housetrained. Chapter 8 details 

 Chapter 6: Heading to the Outside: Outdoor Housetraining 95
how quickly you should give your juvenile housetrainee run of your 
premises.
Scheduling Outdoor Training
for Adult Dogs
Teaching an adult dog to do her bathroom business outside is sim-
ilar to teaching a puppy. The difference between the two is that the 
adult dog doesn’t need nearly as many bathroom breaks as a puppy 
does. But the principles and procedures are the same: showing your 
four-legged friend that her bathroom is outside and doing whatever 
it takes to keep her from eliminating inside (see the earlier section 
“Introducing Puppies to Outdoor Training” for details).
Table 6-2 shows a sample schedule for outdoor-training an adult 
dog. As soon as your adult dog has mastered her housetraining 
basics — which can happen in just a few days — you can eliminate 
the noontime potty break and consider giving her a little more free-
dom in your home.

Dealing with Boo-boos
Yes, I know: Your puppy or dog is the most wonderful creature 
ever to have graced the planet (aside from yourself, your spouse, 
and your kids). But alas, even this paragon is not perfect; she 
makes mistakes — and many occur during the housetraining pro-
cess. Despite your best efforts to teach her bathroom manners, 
your four-legged friend may not understand immediately what 
she’s supposed to do or not do. She’ll demonstrate that lack of 
understanding by pooping or peeing inside your home instead of 
outside in her designated potty area.
In this section, I tell you how to respond to bathroom boo-boos, 
whether you spot your dog in a squat or find a puddle or pile 
already on the floor.
Catching your dog in the act
If you come upon your four-legged friend starting to perform that 
unmistakable potty squat, you have a superb teachable moment. 
Your objective here: Divert your dog from doing the doo in the 
wrong place and put her in a position to do it the right place.
Distract your dog from making the wrong move by offering a tiny 
treat or a toy, clapping your hands, or saying “Oops!” in a cheerful 
voice. As you do so, hustle her outside to her potty spot as quickly 
as possible so she can finish what she started but do so in the 
right place. After she unloads there, praise her lavishly and give 
her a couple of additional treats.
Finding messes: Don’t scold — 
just clean ’em up!
 
Potty mistakes try the soul of even the most patient dog owner. But 
no matter how irritated you feel, it’s crucial to the ultimate success 
of your housetraining venture not to take your frustration out on 
your outdoor trainee. Take a deep breath and remind yourself that 
any mistakes she makes are not her fault, and don’t scold her in any 
way. Instead, take your little transgressor back to her crate so you 
can concentrate on cleanup, but don’t say anything to her.
After your four-legged friend is safely confined in her doggie den, 
grab some paper towels and some pet stain remover. Follow the 
directions on the cleaner bottle and completely clean up the evidence 

 Chapter 6: Heading to the Outside: Outdoor Housetraining 97
of your puppy’s doo-doo boo-boo. Take her out when you’ve cleaned 
up completely, have calmed down, and can watch her.
Please, please, please do not try to correct your erring pooch by 
scolding her, punishing her, or rubbing her nose in her transgres-
sion. Any after-the-fact corrective efforts will be lost on her.
 
Folded-down ears, a tail between the legs, and a refusal to look at 
you do not indicate that your dog feels bad about her bathroom 
boo-boo. The body language you’re seeing shows that she feels 
uneasy, distressed, or maybe even scared because of the body lan-
guage that you’re exhibiting. But guilty? Nope.
So if your dog doesn’t understand what she’s done and doesn’t feel 
any guilt, what should you do? Simple: Just clean up the mess. Then 
figure out where you went wrong, as I explain in the next section.
Preventing further accidents
After you clean up a pile or puddle, think about what happened 
and who should take the blame for your four-legged friend’s mistake. 
Here’s a hint: Instead of focusing on your dog, focus on yourself. If 
she peed in your living room, ask yourself what she was doing in 
the living room unattended in the first place. If she pooped on your 
kitchen floor, ask yourself when her last bowel movement was and 
whether you should’ve anticipated that by getting her outside earlier. 
In other words, try to figure out what you could’ve done to prevent 
your dog’s accident and what you can do to make sure that she 
doesn’t do an encore. Table 6-3 can help you get started.
Table 6-3 
Troubleshooting Your Dog’s Accident

What You Can Do
She peed when your back was 
turned.
Never let her out of her crate or living 
area unless you’re prepared to watch 
her every minute.
She peed or pooped in her 
crate.
Make sure her crate isn’t too big for 
her; it should be just large enough 
for her to stand up and turn around. 
Make sure, too, that she’s not left in 
the crate for too long — three to four 
hours, max.

Table 6-3 (continued)
What Your Dog Did
What You Can Do
She pooped without warning.
Observe what she does immediately 
before she makes a deposit. That way, 
you’ll be able to scoop her up and 
take her outside before she has an 
accident.
She pees on the same indoor 
spot daily.
Make sure you clean up completely. 
And don’t give your dog too much 
indoor freedom too soon.
 
Any canine potty accident contains a lesson — but the lesson is 
for you, not your dog. By figuring out where you went wrong and 
making sure that you don’t make the same mistake again, you’ll 
make a giant leap toward having a truly housetrained dog.
Of course, not all accidents occur because you weren’t watching. 
For advice on treating special potty problems, such as wetting the 
bed or marking territory with urine, see Chapter 9. And for info on 
how bathroom behavior may be related to health problems, check 
out Chapter 10.
Providing Indoor Potty Areas 
for Outdoor Trainees
Can you successfully introduce your dog to both the outdoor potty 
and the indoor potty when he’s a puppy who’s just figuring out basic 
bathroom protocol? Alas, the answer seems to be a resounding no 
for any canine genius.
 
Having an indoor/outdoor dog sounds wonderfully convenient 
in theory, but it isn’t worth trying to attain in practice. In your 
efforts to achieve convenience, you’ll probably just confuse your 
four-legged friend. A dog who’s confused about his household’s 
bathroom rules often expresses his confusion by having multiple 
accidents in the wrong places and not knowing what he’s sup-
posed to do when you take him to the right place. Such confusion 
is totally unnecessary. All you need to do is decide whether you 
want your dog to do his business inside or outside and train him 
accordingly.

 Chapter 6: Heading to the Outside: Outdoor Housetraining 99
However, there is at least one situation in which you may need 
to provide a temporary indoor potty for your outdoor trainee: 
if you’re out all day and have a puppy who’s less than around 5 
months of age. A dog this young simply can’t hold it from nine to 
five, and even asking him to try is wrong.
 
If your ultimate goal is to train your puppy to potty only outdoors, 
both you and he will be better off if you can find a way to give 
your puppy a midday potty break (see Chapter 5 for some of your 
options). But if none of those options is feasible, you must let your 
puppy go potty indoors during the day. Here’s how it works:
 
✓ Confine your puppy to the kitchen with some baby gates or an 
exercise pen and spread several layers of newspaper on the 
floor. Don’t follow the indoor-training tips in Chapter 7 — you 
want to focus your actual training efforts on the outside.
Resisting the allure of 
indoor/outdoor training
After I’ve gotten my weekly TV fix of Top Chef, Project Runway, or Make Me a 
Supermodel (and if you’re reading this book after those shows have been canceled, 
rest assured that I’ll have found new shows to replace them), the last thing I want 
to do is to take Allie out for her final whiz of the day. After all, it’s 11 p.m. or later. I’m 
generally pretty tired by then. Most of the time I can guilt my husband into doing 
the job, even though he’s not thrilled with doing it, either. And if the weather’s not 
to Allie’s liking, our distaste for the late-night potty break increases. At those times, 
both my spouse and I fervently wish that we could just spread some newspapers 
in my kitchen or basement, march Allie over to them, tell her to do her bathroom 
business right there (and right away), and know that she’d comply.
But we never do it. We realize that Allie wouldn’t have a clue about why I’m spread-
ing out those newspapers. She’d bypass them completely. Instead, she’d either 
have an accident in the house or (more likely) try to demonstrate that her bladder 
is made of iron. Either way, the result would not be good. If she had an accident 
in the house, I’d be angry about having to clean it up, even though I’d have no one 
to blame but myself. If she tried to hold it, she’d boost her odds of getting a urinary 
tract infection — which would cause her some discomfort and force me to take her 
to the vet for an exam and some antibiotics.
That’s why, no matter how tired I am and/or how awful the weather is outside, 
either my husband or I take Allie out just before bedtime. We all sleep better after-
ward, even if it takes us a little longer to get to bed.

✓ When you’re home, pick up the papers and take him outside 
to do any and all bathroom business.
 
✓ Count the days till he reaches that 5-month mark. At that 
point, the papers are likely to stay dry all day. When that hap-
pens every day for at least a week, you can call a halt to the 
daytime papers: He’s shown he can hold it all day.
Another situation that requires temporary indoor training is if 
your little darling is less than 4 months old, hasn’t gotten all his 
shots, and has no outdoor place to potty except for the communal 
latrine (such as a park) that all the other dogs in the neighborhood 
use. Young puppies can easily get life-threatening diseases such 
as distemper and parvovirus (just ask Oprah Winfrey, who lost a 
puppy to parvo in 2009 and almost lost a second one) when they 
come into contact with the poop, pee, and/or vomit that infected 
dogs leave behind. A series of shots protects puppies from these 
diseases, but the shots aren’t fully effective until the series is com-
pleted. That happens when the puppy is about 16 weeks old.
 
If you’re a new-puppy owner who lives in the city, where the only 
outdoor potty spots are where other dogs do their business, heed 
your veterinarian’s warnings. Let your canine baby potty indoors 
until he finishes his shots. After that, you can move his bathroom 
outside. For the lowdown on moving an indoor potty outside, see 
the next chapter.

ndoor housetraining can benefit both people and pooches. The 
dog who potties inside need never worry about having to do his 
business outside in the rain, snow, and darkness. Indoor training 
can also save your floors and furnishings if your dog can’t potty 
outdoors due to health reasons, your schedule, or your pup’s tiny 
bladder.
In this chapter, I explain why indoor training can solve many 
pooches’ potty problems, and I describe how to teach your canine 
companion to use an indoor potty.
Understanding How Indoor 
Training Works
Indoor training is the process of teaching your dog to poop and pee 
only in the indoor potty that you’ve created for him. Indoor train-
ing involves using scent and repetition to teach your dog that the 
indoor potty is the only surface upon which he should take a whiz 
or make a deposit. A successfully indoor-trained pooch is one who, 
upon feeling the urge to eliminate, high-tails himself to his indoor 
potty. When he’s there, he does his business. Afterward, you clean 
the potty area.

Part II: Putting a Plan in Place   
102
Of course, the devil is in the details, but take heart: You and your 
dog can master those details quickly and make indoor training a 
breeze. In this section, I help you recognize whether your dog is a 
good candidate for indoor training, and I discuss the importance of 
not confusing your dog with both indoor and outdoor potty places.
Identifying good indoor-training 
candidates
Picture this: A 2-year-old miniature Dachshund who was once a 
housetraining whiz suddenly appears to develop housetraining 
amnesia. He’s always held his poop and pee all day, but when his 
owner starts working longer hours, his bathroom manners back-
slide, resulting in puddles all over his home. The owner, who’s 
understandably frustrated at having to spend her evenings clean-
ing her carpet, wonders whether her dog needs a new way to go to 
the bathroom — and if so, whether indoor training would fill the 
bill. The answer to that question may be yes.
 
Dealing with housetraining lapses should start with a trip to your 
vet. If your outdoor-trained dog suddenly starts making bathroom 
mistakes, have his vet examine him for possible medical problems 
(Chapter 10 outlines some of these problems and how to solve 
them.) But if your dog gets the all-clear from his doctor, switching 
to indoor training may be a good idea so that he can potty indoors 
whenever he needs to.
The following dogs may do better with indoor potties than with 
outdoor bathrooms:
 
✓ Dogs who are home alone all day, especially puppies: If 
you’re away from home all day, moving the canine potty 
Crates and the indoor trainee
If you’re planning to indoor-train your puppy, does he really need a crate? Maybe 
not, but using one is still a good idea.
Every dog has an instinctive need for a safe, enclosed place from which to view 
the world: a den. A crate gives your dog that secure vantage point. Moreover, you 
probably don’t want your dog to be traipsing to the papers or litter box at any and 
all hours. By teaching him to stay in his crate for at least fairly short intervals, you’re 
helping him develop the control he needs to put a temporary hold on his deposits.

 Chapter 7: Making Some Inside Moves: Indoor Housetraining 103
indoors may be a big improvement from cleaning up a puddle 
when you come home. A puppy who’s less than 4 or 5 months 
old can’t hold it very long.
 
✓ Pooches whose people have trouble walking: For a senior 
citizen who can’t get around easily, an indoor potty may make 
the difference between being able to have a dog and having to 
live without canine company.
 
✓ Dogs who live in city apartments and can’t get to an outdoor 
potty area easily: For the high-rise apartment dweller, having 
an inside place for the dog to do his business can be far better 
than making a mad dash for the elevator to get Fido outside in 
time. However, this condition should apply to small dogs only.
 
✓ Very small dogs: For anyone with a reasonably small dog, 
indoor training eliminates the need to brave bad weather to 
take the dog to do the doo.
 
✓ Puppies who can’t use a public bathroom because they 
haven’t finished their shots: The bodily waste and vomit that 
other dogs leave behind can transmit devastating diseases 
such as canine distemper and parvovirus. So if your puppy 
hasn’t been fully vaccinated — at about 16 weeks of age — 
and your dog has nowhere to go outside but a public park or 
similar area that other dogs visit, your pup may need to use 
an indoor potty, at least temporarily. (Note: If you have your 
own fenced backyard, letting him do his business outdoors is 
fine as long as you’re reasonably sure that unvaccinated dogs 
haven’t done their business there.)
Opting for indoor training only
You can train an outdoor-trained dog to use an indoor potty, and 
you can train an indoor-trained dog to do the doo outside. (For 
details, see the later sections “Switching a vaccinated puppy to 
outdoor training” and “Using Indoor Training for the Adult Dog.”) 
But your dog shouldn’t use both types of potty places on a regular 
basis. After you switch your dog’s potty spot, close the old one.
 
You have to decide whether you want your dog to do his business 
inside or outside — and train him accordingly. It would be nice to be 
able to take your dog to an outdoor potty on sunny days but have 
the option of spreading out some newspapers when the weather’s 
lousy or you feel like sleeping late. Unfortunately, though, this 
convenience for you just confuses your dog — and a dog who’s 
confused about bathroom protocol is anything but convenient.

Part II: Putting a Plan in Place   
104
 
If your ultimate goal is to have your dog relieve himself outside, 
focus on outdoor training from the start. You can cover the 
puppy’s indoor living area with papers to protect your floors (as 
I explain later in “Newspapers”) if you’ll be away from home for 
several hours and can’t arrange for Fido to have a potty break. But 
don’t pre-scent the papers with urine or praise the dog for doing 
the doo inside, as you would if you were specifically practicing 
indoor training. In this case, the newspapers are strictly a stop-gap 
measure until the puppy has the physical ability to hold it all day. 
See Chapter 11 for details on this technique.
Pick Your Potty: Deciding 
Which Type to Use
First, you need to decide which type of indoor potty to use: 
newspapers, puppy training pads, a litter box, or a grate/tray pooch 
potty. In this section, I describe your options and help you choose 
the one that may work best for you and your canine companion.
 
If you have a tiny dog, you may eventually want to put a potty on 
each floor of your home so she can reach the bathroom in time 
(see Chapter 9 for tips on working with petite pooches). Start with 
just one potty in the beginning for a puppy or adult housetrainee, 
because your dog will be confined much of the time. After house-
training is complete, you can add more doggie bathrooms.
Newspapers
Many people consider newspapers to be a temporary measure; 
they use the newspapers as a stop-gap doggie bathroom until 
the dog is ready to start doing her business outside on a full-time 
basis. That said, there’s no reason newspapers can’t be a perma-
nent indoor potty for your pooch.
Newspapers are the original indoor pooch potties. And no wonder: 
They’re cheap, they’re readily available, and they can even be 
considered environmentally friendly: You buy one, you read it, and 
you reuse it as an indoor doggie bathroom. What could be simpler?
The drawbacks of papers are apparent the first time you clean 
up the poop or pee your dog places on that newspaper. Unless 
you pick up that paper with care, the pee may drip down onto the 
floor — or even (yuck) onto your person. There’s also the not-so-
attractive possibility that your dog will walk through her previous 
puddle or pile on subsequent trips to her newspaper potty if you 

 Chapter 7: Making Some Inside Moves: Indoor Housetraining 105
don’t clean up the mess right away. Still, for the cost-conscious, 
no-nonsense housetrainer who wants his pooch to perform her 
bathroom maneuvers indoors, newspapers can work.
Using newspapers is not just a matter of pulling out a sheet, throw-
ing it on the floor, and letting your housetrainee figure out the rest. 
Here’s how to construct a proper indoor bathroom:
 
✓ Protect your floor. Place an old shower curtain on the floor 
before you place any newspapers on it. The curtain protects 
your floor if the urine soaks through the papers. In that case, 
you only have to apply pet stain cleaner to the wet area of the 
curtain and wipe it dry.
 
✓ Start big. When you first lay out newspapers for your house-
trainee, plan on covering an area equal to the size of at least 
four spread-out pages, one next to the other, if not nearly the 
dog’s entire living area. That gives your pooch plenty of area 
upon which to potty when she’s first figuring out where she’s 
supposed to do her business.
 
✓ Layer up. Plan on using eight full-page spreads for your begin-
ning housetrainee’s newspaper bathroom area. Put four of 
those spreads together; then place the other four spreads 
next to the first set of spreads.
 
✓ Shrink later. As your dog becomes more proficient at using 
the papers, you can cut back on the number of papers used to 
just one four-layer set of two-page spreads.
 
✓ Use the right newspaper. Stick with newspapers that sport 
black print and occasional front page color photos. They’re 
more absorbent than other surfaces, such as the Sunday ad 
inserts, and they provide more traction.
 
Don’t fret if the ink from the newspaper rubs off on your light-
coated puppy’s paws. A little dab of soap and water can whisk 
those smudges away.
Puppy training pads
Puppy training pads, also known as pee pads or pee-pee pads, are 
marketed as an alternative to newspapers or litter boxes for dogs 
who are learning to potty indoors. The pads are made of absorbent 
layers of paper that are backed by a layer of plastic and are sealed 
around the edges. The standard size of each pad is 23 x 24 inches, 
although at least one manufacturer also offers an “oversize” pad 
of 30 x 30 inches. The pads come in packages usually ranging 
from 12 to 60 pads each.

Part II: Putting a Plan in Place   
106
Because the pads are absorbent, a puddle is less likely to soak 
through the floor than is the case with layers of newspaper, and 
cleanup is easier, too. However, I’m not a big fan of training pads.
 
All too often, dogs decide they’d rather eat puppy training pads 
than potty on them. At best, such ingestion results in a double 
mess on the floor: canine waste and shredded pads. At worst, a 
dog who eats his training pad may need emergency surgery to 
remove an ingested part of a pad that’s blocked the digestive tract.
Litter boxes
Up until about a decade ago, newspapers were the main source of 
indoor potties for pooches. Then a couple of forward-thinking 
companies apparently realized that if cats could potty in aestheti-
cally pleasing, easy-to-clean facilities, so could dogs. Voilà — the 
doggie litter box was born.
Litter boxes can offer other advantages: Unlike newspapers, they 
control pet waste odors and protect your floor without your 
having to sacrifice a shower curtain to the cause.
If you want to use a doggie litter box for training, you need the 
following items:
 
✓ A litter box (also called a litter tray or litter pan), similar to 
what cats and kittens use to go to the bathroom: The boxes 
have walls on three sides, and the fourth side is open to allow 
easy entry. One company, Nestlé-Purina, offers three litter box 
sizes: one for puppies and toy dogs, one for miniature-sized 
dogs, and one for standard-sized dogs that weigh up to 35 
pounds.
 
✓ The litter itself: The main ingredients of dog litter are recy-
cled paper and/or wood pulp. Costs vary depending on how 
large your dog is and what size of bag you purchase. You can 
also get dog litter delivered to your home if you order online 
or from a catalog.
Grate/tray potties
If you don’t want to deal with the messiness of newspapers (includ-
ing the chance that your dog will walk through the pee or poop 
deposited on those papers) or to add periodic purchases of dog 
litter to your pet care budget, you have yet another option: the 
grate/tray combo. These relatively new pooch potties come in 
two parts: an easy-to-clean plastic tray and a plastic grate that you 
place atop the tray. You don’t need to buy anything else.

 Chapter 7: Making Some Inside Moves: Indoor Housetraining 107
And fear not: Because the grates are made of flexible plastic, they 
give under the weight of the dog’s paws, preventing any discom-
fort. When I tested one of these combos with my 70-pound dog 
Allie, she didn’t hesitate to venture onto the tray or to sit on it 
when asked.
But although grate/tray potties are just as nice looking as litter 
boxes, they can be cumbersome to clean up, depending on their 
size. That clumsiness of cleanup is also a reason not to use these 
potties for dogs who weigh more than 30 pounds.
Introducing Puppies 
to Indoor Training
The great thing about outdoor training is that you can start doing 
it right away. And if you’re really lucky, your puppy’s breeder has 
started the process for you. In this section, you find out how to 
show your dog his potty spot, how to encourage your dog with 
verbal cues, and how to develop a pup-sized training schedule.
Avoiding kitty litter
If you have both a dog and a cat, you may be thinking about streamlining your shop-
ping by purchasing the same litter for both. But according to litter manufacturers, 
that’s not a very good idea.
For one thing, many dogs are as likely to try eating kitty litter as they are to eliminate 
in it. Such behavior can pose problems not only for your canine companion but also 
for your feline friend.
Moreover, kitty litter isn’t designed to absorb doggie waste. Many cat litters, par-
ticularly the clumping kind, are sandlike in texture. Cats like to cover their solid 
waste, and the sandlike litter makes that cover-up action easier. Dogs don’t cover 
their tracks — or their poop, either — but some canines do scuff and scrape the 
areas behind them with their rear feet after they’ve made a solid waste deposit. A 
dog who likes to do this would end up kicking a fair amount of kitty litter out of the 
box. Dog litters, which are made from recycled paper and/or wood pulp, are much 
more likely to withstand a dog’s rear-guard action.
These differences in feline and canine behavior also mean that household dogs and 
cats need to have separate litter boxes. If you expect Fido to potty in the same box 
that Fluffy does — or vice versa — it’s likely that both Fido and Fluffy will choose 
to do their business elsewhere.

Deciding where to put 
the indoor potty
Chapter 3 contains some basic pointers on where to put the indoor 
potty, mainly to help you make that decision. Now that you’re 
tackling the nitty-gritty of indoor training, I offer more help not 
only on creating your pooch’s indoor potty but also on setting up 
his entire living area. Accomplishing this task effectively can make 
bathroom breaks go much more smoothly for both you and your 
canine companion.
 
Until your dog is fully housetrained, he should not have access to 
your entire home unless you can be right there to watch his every 
move. If you don’t watch what your four-legged friend is doing, you 
won’t see when he performs a doggie download — and you’ll miss 
what educators call a teachable moment: the opportunity to teach 
your canine companion where he should do his business.
But of course, no one can watch a dog 24/7. That’s why, during the 
times you can’t cast an eagle eye on your canine companion, you 
should confine him to a dog-proofed indoor living area. Start with 
a soft comfy bed — ideally inside a crate — and also set up a place 
for him to eat and a place for him to perform bathroom maneuvers.
 
When deciding where to set up your indoor trainee’s living area, 
bear the following factors in mind:
 
✓ Where the action is: Your dog needs more than just a place to 
snooze, chow down, and do his bathroom biz. He also needs 
that living area to be where he’s most likely to get attention 
Sod potties: Bringing the yard indoors
For apartment dwellers who still want their dogs to have the experience of pottying 
on grass (or a reasonable facsimile thereof), there’s a new solution: Sod potties. 
These systems consist of a drain pan on which you place some real or faux sod. 
Some have their own drainage systems and even sprinklers (whoa!), and others 
require the owner to rinse the grass themselves, either by hand or with a hose.
These products have a certain ingenuity, but there’s one huge drawback: cost. 
The least-expensive offering in this line of product starts at $199 — and that’s not 
including the synthetic grass that you have to purchase. One top-of-the-line system 
that at least comes with its own grass costs nearly $600 to start with, not counting 
shipping costs. My opinion: Stick with the basics, unless you have money to burn.

 Chapter 7: Making Some Inside Moves: Indoor Housetraining 109
from his family; in other words, where his family tends to 
congregate. For most households, that’s the kitchen.
 
✓ Surface stability: No matter which indoor potty you choose, 
placement of that potty on a carpet will render the potty less 
stable than placement on a bare floor. Plus, if you choose to 
use newspapers, a big puddle of urine or pile of loose stool 
could soak through those newspapers onto the carpet, neces-
sitating a challenging cleanup even though your dog went in 
the right place. For that reason, placing the living area on a 
bare floor is preferable to placing it on a carpet or rug.
 
✓ Convenient waste disposal: You may want to place the potty 
in a room close to a covered trash disposal area, a sink, and 
a toilet. That way, you can throw solid waste down the toilet, 
clean the potty itself in the sink if needed, and throw litter or 
papers in the trash area.
 
✓ Your home décor: If you’ve decorated your home to resemble 
an interior spread from Architectural Digest, you want to make 
sure that your puppy’s part of your palace doesn’t detract 
from your décor.
No matter where you place the living area, make sure that your 
puppy can’t get into any trouble. Install baby gates to block the 
doorways, or encircle the living area with an exercise pen.
 
Within the living area, remove any dangling electrical cords from 
the dog’s reach, and make sure he can’t get into any cabinets 
where you keep cleaners and other hazardous substances. Door 
guards, which you can find in the baby departments of toy stores, 
can keep your curious canine from venturing into your cabinets.
Now you’re ready to place the indoor potty in the living area. If 
you’re using a litter box or grate/tray, place it in a corner away 
from your puppy’s bed and dishes. If you’re using newspapers, 
start by covering nearly the entire living area with four layers of 
newspaper. As your puppy develops potty proficiency, gradually 
reduce the coverage area.
Starting out
After you’ve set up your puppy’s living area, you can start teaching 
her to use the indoor potty. The first and most important step is to
help her make the connection between the potty place and what she’s 
supposed to do in that place. In this section, I explain how it works.

Part II: Putting a Plan in Place   
110
Introducing the indoor potty
Start off right — and do it right away. The car ride home from the 
breeder, shelter, or foster home often prompts a puppy to eliminate 
immediately after the ride is over. So as soon as you and your pup 
arrive home, take her to her indoor potty. If she hesitates to use 
the potty, lure her onto it or into it with a small treat. When she 
opens her floodgates and/or makes a solid deposit, praise her lav-
ishly and give her a tiny treat. If she doesn’t do anything, wait a few 
minutes and then try again.
Cleaning up the indoor potty — mostly
Clean up the potty immediately, but leave a little something behind: 
a soiled newspaper or a scent cloth that you create by wiping your 
dog’s bottom with a paper towel after she does the doo. Place this 
item just below the top layer of fresh newspaper or underneath the 
litter or grate. By doing so, you’re telling your puppy where you 
want her to do her business. The smell of the soiled paper or litter is 
the canine equivalent of a come-hither glance.
 
Make sure that the puppy’s potty spot remains sanitary. Here’s 
how to keep it clean:
 
✓ Newspapers: Change the papers as soon as they’re soiled 
(except for that pre-scented piece). If urine soaks through the 
papers to the shower curtain underneath it, just apply your 
pet stain cleaner to the dampened area and wipe it clean.
 
✓ Litter box: Plan on washing out the litter box with detergent 
and warm water at least once a week and on freshening the 
litter each time your dog uses the box.
 
✓ Grate/tray indoor potty: Rinse the grate and tray daily and 
wash them weekly unless the manufacturer’s instructions 
dictate otherwise.
Taking later trips to the potty spot
After your dog has pottied and you’ve cleaned the potty, let your 
puppy explore the house for a while. But keep a close eye on her 
for signs that she needs to go again. If she suddenly stops, starts 
sniffing intently, begins to circle or pace, and/or starts to squat, 
whisk her back to the potty and praise her if she pees or poops 
there. Give her a tiny treat, too.
If you miss the signs that she’s going to go and she has an acci-
dent, don’t say anything. Just clean up and watch her more closely 
next time.
After an hour or so of getting to know each other, put your puppy 
in her bed (or crate) and let her take a much-needed nap. Watch to 

 Chapter 7: Making Some Inside Moves: Indoor Housetraining 111
see when she wakes up, though — and when she does, get her to 
her potty. If she uses it, praise and treat. Then clean up as before.
Puppies need to potty after every meal, naptime, and play session. 
Each time she uses her potty, praise her lavishly.
 
Don’t take your puppy outside for a walk or to play until after she 
makes a trip to the papers, box, or grate-tray combo. You don’t 
want the pup to associate the outdoors with elimination. You’re 
aiming to have your puppy consider the indoor potty her one and 
only toilet.
Scheduling bathroom breaks
Even indoor-trained dogs can benefit from learning to hold their 
poop and pee. The pooch with some self-control is much easier 
to live with than the dog with unregulated bathroom demands. 
Noticing that your dog may be ill is also easier if you can deter-
mine whether he’s going more or less often than usual.
But regulating your dog’s bathroom behavior needn’t flummox 
you. You can bring some order to your indoor trainee’s life (and 
your own) by putting his trips to the potty on a schedule.
 
The important thing to remember when setting up a potty schedule 
is that puppies need to eliminate at the following times:
 
✓ First thing in the morning
 
✓ Last thing at night
 
✓ During the night (if the puppy is under 4 months of age)
 
✓ After energetic playing
 
✓ After being confined in a crate
 
✓ After a nap
 
✓ After chewing on a toy or a bone
 
✓ A few minutes after eating
Armed with this knowledge, you can create a schedule that gives 
your puppy time to pee or poop and gives you some predictability. 
Table 7-1 shows how you can structure a schedule for a 3-month-
old pup. Note, however, that a younger puppy probably will need 
to go much more often — maybe even hourly. (Note: This schedule 
assumes that someone’s home during the day to take care of the 
puppy’s potty needs. If that’s not the situation in your home, check 
out Chapter 11.)

As your puppy gets older, she won’t need the midmorning, midaft-
ernoon, and 7:00 p.m. trips to the potty, and she won’t need the 
noontime feeding, either. The nocturnal trip to the potty will soon 
become a thing of the past, too.
Switching a vaccinated puppy 
to outdoor training
Maybe you never intended for indoor training to be a permanent 
solution. If you opted for indoor training because your pup wasn’t 
fully vaccinated or because she was too young to hold it for very 
long, you can move the potty spot outdoors when the time is right. 
After the shots are finished at around 16 weeks of age, you can 
keep your puppy on papers if she’s likely to be a small adult, or 
you can opt to move her bathroom outside.
If you want your puppy to go outside, start by moving the papers 
themselves to an outdoor area and let your puppy eliminate on 
them. Gradually reduce the size of the paper until the puppy just 
goes to her potty spot and does her business without paper.
Using Indoor Training 
for the Adult Dog
If you’ve just adopted an adult dog who’s always pottied indoors, 
there’s really no training to do. Just use the same type of bathroom 
he had in his previous home and continue with that. He’ll probably 
adjust very smoothly with little or no effort on your part. If you 
don’t know what type of indoor bathroom he had, choose what 
works best for you, set up a living area, and begin indoor training. 
(Chapter 6 includes a training schedule for adult dogs.)
More often, though, indoor training an adult dog means moving 
his bathroom from the outdoor backyard to a location inside your 
house. In this section, I give you the scoop on making that change, 
regardless of what kind of potty you’ve chosen.
 
As with indoor potties for puppies, you need to keep the potties 
for adult dogs sanitary. See the earlier section titled “Cleaning up 
the indoor potty — mostly” for details.

Part II: Putting a Plan in Place   
114
From outdoors to papers
Moving a dog’s potty from an outdoor spot to the front page of 
yesterday’s newspaper is relatively easy:
 
1. Mark a piece of newspaper with your dog’s urine.
 
 Start by bringing a piece of toilet tissue and a piece of 
newspaper along when you take Fifi outdoors to her usual 
potty place. Wipe her bottom with the toilet tissue after 
she pees. Then wipe the toilet tissue onto the newspaper.
 
2. Line your dog’s outdoor potty spot with newspapers.
 
 The next time you take Fifi out, take the pre-scented news-
paper and some fresh newspaper along with you. When 
you reach the outdoor potty area, place the pre-scented 
paper on the ground and the fresh papers on top of it. Then 
let Fifi do her business atop the papers; praise and treat 
when she does. Continue this routine until Fifi uses the out-
door papers consistently.
 
3. Move the papers indoors.
 
 Place a pre-scented newspaper beneath the top layer of 
fresh newspapers spread out on the floor in the potty area 
you’ve chosen. Make sure that the area you cover equals 
two or three side-by-side two-page newspaper spreads and 
that it’s four layers deep.
 
 At Fifi’s next potty break, take her to the papers instead of 
outside. Give her a few minutes to do her business. If she 
does, praise lavishly; if she doesn’t, wait 15 or 20 minutes 
and try again.
 
4. When she consistently uses the indoor papers, reduce the 
amount of floor space the papers take up.
Patience and encouragement are the keys to making this transition 
work. You’re asking your dog to make a big change after years of 
doing her bathroom business outside. Dogs don’t like changes any 
more than most people do, but your enthusiasm and her eagerness 
to please you can help her overcome her reluctance.
From outdoors to litter box
To help a dog switch from pottying outdoors to pottying in a litter 
box, start by bringing the new potty to the old potty. Here’s how 
the process works:
 
1. Just before one of your dog’s scheduled bathroom 
breaks, put a little dog litter on his outdoor potty spot.

 Chapter 7: Making Some Inside Moves: Indoor Housetraining 115
 
 Bring him to the outdoor spot and encourage him to do his 
business. Praise and treat him when he does.
 
2. When he’s consistently using the litter-covered outdoor 
potty, introduce him to the litter box.
 
 Line the box with litter and place it next to the litter-
covered outdoor potty area. Encourage him to investigate 
the litter box and praise him lavishly when he does.
 
3. After your dog is used to seeing the litter box in his out-
door potty area, introduce him to the idea of doing his 
business inside the box.
 
 Put some used litter or pre-scented paper in the box. When 
he does eliminate inside the box, praise him and give him a 
treat.
 
4. Start moving the litter box toward your house.
 
 Do so just a short distance each day. Eventually, you’ll be 
able to locate the litter box inside your home — and your 
days and nights of taking your dog outside to potty will be 
history.
If your dog balks at using the litter box at any point in this process, 
ease the pace of change. Make sure that he’s mastered one step in 
the process before moving to the next one.
From outdoors to grate/tray combo
Here’s how to train your outdoor-trained adult dog to use a grate/
tray combo:
 
1. Start by having your dog go potty outside; wipe your 
dog’s bottom with a paper towel.
 
 Hold onto this cloth; you’ll use it to lure her to what will be 
her indoor potty.
 
2. Sometime before the next potty break, break out the grate/
tray combo indoors and use a treat to lure your dog atop 
the grate; keep doing this until she’s walking on the grate 
comfortably.
 
 Give her a treat when she does so. Keep doing this until 
she’s comfortable atop the grate.
 
3. For her next potty break, bring the grate/tray outside, 
place it next to her potty spot, and put the pre-scented 
cloth between the grate and tray.
 
 If she goes on the grate and tray, praise and treat her.

Part II: Putting a Plan in Place   
116
 
4. After she’s done this a few times, start moving the potty 
toward your home at a snail’s pace.
 
 The grate/tray combo eventually makes its way inside.
Responding to Mistakes
Your puppy or dog undoubtedly is wonderful, but he isn’t perfect. 
Inevitably, he’ll deposit a puddle or pile away from the indoor 
potty. But take a deep breath. Repeat to yourself, “It’s not his fault. 
It’s not his fault.” Take him to his indoor living area and say noth-
ing. Then go get some paper towels and pet stain remover. Clean 
up according to the directions on the cleaner.
Above all, don’t scold, punish, or try to correct your dog. He won’t 
connect your loud voice and angry gestures with the fact that he 
went to the bathroom a mere ten minutes ago.
 
If your dog folds back his ears and puts his tail between his legs 
while you let him know how upset you are, don’t think — not for a 
minute — that he’s feeling guilty. He’s apprehensive, upset, maybe 
even fearful when you become angry, but he feels absolutely no 
remorse over doing what came naturally to him. So don’t waste 
your breath; just clean up the mess.
Then ask yourself what you could’ve done to prevent your dog’s 
accident. Table 7-2 can help get you started.

looking.
Don’t let him out of his living area unless 
you can watch him every single second.
He pooped without warning.
Watch to see how he acts or what he 
does right before he unloads. That way, 
you’ll be able to whisk him to his indoor 
potty before he has an accident.
He missed the potty.
Leave him a bigger area of newspapers 
for him to eliminate on, or get him a bigger 
litter box or grate/tray combo.
He pees on the same spot.

Fine-Tuning Housetraining
In This Chapter
▶ Determining your dog’s potty style
▶ Teaching advanced bathroom behavior
▶ Giving your dog more freedom
P
lenty of signs can indicate that a dog has mastered 
Housetraining 101. Here are a few:
 
✓ You haven’t used your commercial pet stain cleaner for 
weeks, whereas a month or so ago you were using it almost 
every day. An unused bottle of cleaner probably means that 
your puppy pal isn’t having any indoor accidents.
 
✓ You’re consistently scooping up litter or cleaning up either 
soiled papers or a bathroom tray soon after each meal you 
serve your indoor-trained dog. This after-dinner (or after-
breakfast) ritual means that your four-legged friend is elimi-
nating on a regular schedule and probably isn’t having any 
out-of-potty accidents.
 
✓ You come home from work and find that the newspapers that 
you left for your dog in the morning are unsullied by canine 
poop or pee. Moreover, the papers have consistently gone 
unused over the past couple of weeks. Consistently clean 
papers signal that your canine companion is holding his poop 
and pee all day and is confining his bathroom maneuvers to 
outdoor turf.
If your dog shows these or similar signs of housetraining mastery, 
congratulations to both of you on a job well done! By successfully 
teaching your dog basic bathroom manners, the two of you have 
laid the foundation for a rich and rewarding friendship.
But why stop there? Maybe your dog can learn to ask to go out if he 
isn’t doing so already. And life certainly would be easier if your dog 
were to master the ultimate housetraining feat: doing his business 
as soon as you tell him to. Think what it’d be like to be able to take 

Part II: Putting a Plan in Place  
118
your dog out at night and not have to walk up and down your block 
until he decided to pee. Instead, you could march him to a particu-
lar potty spot, tell him something like “Fido, do your business!” 
and know that Fido would do just that. This chapter helps you 
teach him these advanced bathroom maneuvers and more.
Decoding Pre-potty Maneuvers
Before you can boost your dog’s housetraining skills to the 
advanced level, you need to decode his individual potty style. In 
other words, you need to know exactly what he does just before he 
actually eliminates.
Why is this knowledge so important? Because the key to teaching 
your dog advanced bathroom manners is being able to anticipate 
when he needs to take a whiz or make a deposit. Fortunately, most 
dogs provide clear signs that the urge to poop or pee is taking 
hold. The trick for you is to observe the signs that your dog exhib-
its. Then you can put your observations to work as you teach him 
those fancy bathroom maneuvers.
 
Here are a few common examples of pre-bathroom behavior. In gen-
eral, the more intensely and purposefully the dog is performing his 
pre-potty maneuver, the more likely he is to actually poop or pee.
 
✓ The Statue: Some dogs simply call a halt to any and all activity 
and stand as still as statues. Seconds later, they start to do 
their business. This no-frills approach to elimination is very 
common among young puppies, who frequently don’t realize 
that they need to go until they’re just about to do the deed.
 
✓ The Pacer: Many pooches engage in back-and-forth pacing 
before they eliminate. When such a dog is near her potty spot, 
she begins to walk in one direction and then turns around and 
walks an equal distance in the opposite direction. Depending 
on how badly she needs to go, she may walk back and forth 
once or twice — or as many as a dozen times.
 
 Many a Pacer starts her pre-potty routine by walking as far 
as 5 or 6 feet in each direction. As the urge to go strength-
ens, she gradually shortens the pacing distance until she’s 
trotting only a few inches back and forth. At that point, the 
dog eliminates. The speed at which a Pacer does her thing 
varies, although a speedy pace usually indicates that she’ll be 
unloading momentarily.
 
✓ The Circler: Quite a few dogs start walking around in circles 
just before they eliminate. The sizes of these pre-potty circles 
vary: Some have diameters that aren’t much bigger than the 

 Chapter 8: Fine-Tuning Housetraining 119
dogs themselves, and other circles may sport diameters of 
several feet. Speed varies, too, although just as with the Pacer, 
the faster the circling, the more imminent the potty event usu-
ally is. In fact, some Circlers literally run rings around their 
people just before pottying.
 
✓ The Sniffer: Almost every dog engages in some sort of pre-
potty sniffing before he actually does the deed. Some dogs 
sniff before beginning to circle or pace; others confine their 
pre-potty maneuvers to intense snuffling of a particular spot 
just before peeing or pooping on it.
 
 As with circling and pacing, a dog’s sniffing speed varies 
greatly depending on how intense the urge to eliminate is. 
Generally, a dog who’s moving his nose along the ground in 
a leisurely manner is still searching for what he considers to 
be a proper place to potty. However, intense, concentrated 
sniffing of a specific spot often indicates that a dog is about to 
anoint that spot.
 
✓ The Beeliner: Some dogs, such as my Golden Retriever, Allie, 
take a linear approach to finding a potty spot. They sniff a 
little bit but then make a beeline for the place where they 
want to poop or pee. If this description fits your dog and 
you’re walking her on leash, be sure to hold tight to that leash 
after she starts sniffing.
 
✓ The False Alarmist: Some dogs are so particular about where 
they do their business that they engage repeatedly in one or 
more of the pre-potty maneuvers outlined in this list, only to 
stop before actually eliminating. Cory, my late, great Sheltie, 
was a master of this technique, and Allie is becoming a quick 
study. Still, you can decode such a dog’s pre-potty behavior by 
paying a little closer attention to what happens when your dog 
actually does go. For example, most female dogs not only squat 
but also stretch out their backs before they pee. When Allie 
squats but fails to execute that pee-pee stretch, I know that 
she’s changed her mind about anointing that particular spot.
 
Some dogs adopt more than one potty style throughout their lives 
and even within the same potty break. For example, Cory tended 
to be a Circler before he peed but was more of a Pacer before he 
pooped. Allie is a classic Sniffer but also is quite the Beeliner, espe-
cially when I bring her near a spot where she’s done her business 
before or where she realizes other dogs have done their business 
prior to her arrival.
In any case, after you identify your own canine companion’s potty 
style(s), you’re ready to teach him some advanced bathroom 
manners, starting with asking to go out.

120
Getting Your Dog to Ask to Go Out
A great skill is for a dog to somehow communicate to her people 
that she needs a potty break. Some dogs, like my Sheltie Cory, 
teach themselves to ask their people to take them out (see the 
nearby “Cory becomes teacher’s pet” sidebar). Others need a little 
help from their humans. If your dog falls into the latter category, 
this section’s for you.
Sometimes all you need to do is put the leash in the same place 
every time you hang it up. That was true for Cory. My family and I 
always hung his leash on the same doorknob every time we came 
back inside from a trip to the potty. By always putting the leash in 
the same place and by always using the leash when we needed to 
take Cory out, our Sheltie guy soon figured out that the fastest way 
to tell us what he needed was to go to his leash and tap it with his 
nose. You can do the same thing when you housetrain your dog.
 
Put the leash in the same place each and every time. Use the same 
words whenever you take your canine companion to his outdoor 
potty spot. Do exactly the same thing every time you take your 
four-legged friend out, and you create the conditions that help him 
figure out a way to tell you when he needs to go.
But if you don’t want to play a waiting game, don’t hesitate to take 
a more active approach to teaching your dog to ask for a potty 
break. Here’s what to do:
 
1. Get a signal maker.
 
 Find something that can hang from a doorknob within 
reach of your dog’s nose or paw and also makes a pleasant 
noise when the dog touches it lightly. A set of Christmas 
bells fits the bill.
 
2. Teach the signal.
 
 Every time you take your dog out for a potty break, ring the 
bells. Do this consistently so that your canine companion 
associates the ringing of the bells with your taking her 
outside.
 
3. Let her try.
 
 Sooner or later, your dog will want to check out the bells 
herself. Encourage her to do so: Praise her enthusiastically 
if she even sniffs the bells.

 Chapter 8: Fine-Tuning Housetraining 121
 
4. Heed her signal.
 
 The first time your dog taps the bells with her paw or nose 
(see Figure 8-1), respond promptly: Take her outside! Bring 
her to her potty spot and praise her lavishly if she goes. 
After a few times, your dog connects her ringing of the bells 
with your taking her outside.
Figure 8-1: Your dog doesn’t have to say a word to tell 
you when she needs to go out.
 
Don’t let your four-legged friend fool you. If your puppy rings the 
bells but fails to do her duty when she’s outside, march her back 
inside.
Many dogs figure out their own ways to tell their people that it’s 
potty time. For example, Allie employs one of two methods to tell 
me that the bathroom urge is upon her: coming over to me and 
staring at me or running into the family room and scratching on 
the door that leads outside. Just as you watch your dog to decode 
her potty style, study her behavior to see what she does to tell you 
that she needs a bathroom break. Her signals may be quite subtle, 
but if you pay close attention, you can probably see how she’s 
trying to convey what she needs to do and what you need to know.

Encouraging Elimination
Picture this: a dark and stormy night. You and your canine com-
panion have spent a blissful couch-potato evening. Now it’s almost 
bedtime, but instead of moving directly from sofa to bed you have 
one final task to accomplish: taking your dog out for his last potty 
break of the day. And you’re dreading it.
During most weather, you don’t mind the end-of-the-day trip outside 
to your dog’s potty spot. On nights like this one, though, the p.m. 
pit stop is quite another matter. Like most dogs, your special 
friend dislikes doing his business in the rain. Add some wind and 
cold, and the dislike mushrooms into out-and-out hatred. At such 
Cory becomes teacher’s pet
For every dog who’s the subject of a housetraining horror story, another dog quickly 
decodes the do’s and don’ts of proper canine bathroom behavior. Fortunately for 
me, one of the latter dogs was my dearly departed Sheltie, Cory.
Of course, I want to believe that one of the factors behind Cory’s housetraining 
prowess was the possibility that I was doing something right. But whatever the 
reasons were, my outdoor-trained Sheltie guy had only a couple of indoor potty 
accidents during his entire housetraining process.
The funny thing was that it took me a long time to realize how well Cory was doing. 
I followed the outdoor training schedule outlined in Chapter 6 until Cory was well 
beyond his 3-month birthday. After that, I gradually cut back on the amount of time 
he spent in his crate and increased the amount of time he could run around the 
house. But I watched him like a hawk the whole time; he didn’t get any unsuper-
vised time at all.
Then, one morning when Cory was about 6 months old, he surprised me. He and 
I were playing together, and although he wasn’t due for a bathroom break, he 
suddenly stopped what he was doing. Then he walked over to the doorknob where 
his leash was hanging and tapped the leash with his nose before turning to stare 
at me.
I’m no rocket scientist, but I suspected that Cory was asking me to take him out. So 
I snapped on his leash and walked him outside to the median strip in front of our 
house. As soon as we reached the strip, Cory opened his floodgates. I was thrilled. 
And I figured that if Cory could tell me when he needed a bathroom break, I didn’t 
have to worry about him having an accident in the house. In short, I was ready to 
consider him fully housetrained. And from that point on, Cory fully justified my faith 
in his bathroom abilities: He never relieved himself in our house for the rest of his 
life. He clearly had gotten the housetraining thing down pat.

 Chapter 8: Fine-Tuning Housetraining 123
times, you just know that when you let him out to do his business, 
he’ll stand next to the door, shiver, and attempt to look pitiful. 
Under no circumstances will he allow the damp ground to even 
brush against his hindquarters. And no way will he actually unload 
in the rain.
Having you with him doesn’t spur your pee- or poop-retentive 
pooch, either. What happens instead is that the two of you get to 
stand outside and get soaked together. That’s not my idea of qual-
ity time, and it’s probably not yours, either.
Some lucky owners are able to teach their dogs to do their business 
on cue. Others, me included, have dogs who set their own potty 
agendas, thank you very much. That said, you can still encourage 
such dogs to potty sooner rather than later. Here, I discuss how to 
teach your dog to unload when you ask him to and how to cope if 
your dog replies, in effect, “I’ll go when I decide to go.”
Peeing on cue
The theory behind the peeing-on-cue maneuver is simple: You help 
your dog associate a kind of potty prompt with the act of urinating. 
When your dog makes that connection, he’ll pee when you ask him 
to. Thus, when you and Fido are out in the rain, you simply march 
together to the potty spot, you cue Fido to pee, and voilà! He does.
In fact, your newly housetrained puppy may already pee when you 
ask him to if you’ve followed the instructions for outdoor training 
in Chapter 6. But even if your four-legged friend hasn’t mastered 
this maneuver, you can still teach even an adult dog with fully 
entrenched bathroom habits to do his business when you ask him 
to. Here’s how:
 
1. Pick a potty prompt.
 
 Make this decision carefully. The ideal bathroom command 
is a phrase that you can use without embarrassment. For 
example, you may feel more comfortable telling your dog, 
“Fido, do your business,” rather than “Fido, go take a leak.”
 
 Be careful that the prompt is a phrase that you’ll use only 
when telling Fido to pee. A more general-sounding prompt, 
such as “Hurry up,” can bring unwelcome results, such as 
Fido’s anointing the carpet at the same time you’re telling 
your children to get out the door so that they won’t be late 
for school.
 
2. Take your dog to his potty spot the next time he has to do 
his bathroom business.

Part II: Putting a Plan in Place  
124
 
3. Watch for pre-potty signals.
 
 If you’ve taken the time to acquaint yourself with his potty 
style, you know what to look for (see the earlier section 
“Decoding Pre-potty Maneuvers”). When he starts those 
maneuvers, get ready to see him pee.
 
4. Give the prompt as soon as your dog starts to pee.
 
5. Praise him lavishly and give him a small treat when he’s 
finished.
Within a couple of weeks, he’ll likely have made the connection 
between the potty prompt and the act of urinating and respond 
accordingly.
Prompting Mr. (or Ms.) Independent
I have a confession to make: Although I’m familiar with the 
mechanics of teaching a dog to urinate on cue, my own canine 
companions just won’t do it.
Some of my friends tease me about my Golden Retriever Allie’s 
(or before her arrival, Cory the Sheltie’s) refusal to learn this 
maneuver. They want to know how I can possibly write a book 
about housetraining if I can’t even get my own dog to piddle when 
prompted. (In my defense, their lack of motivation probably isn’t 
my fault; see the nearby sidebar for details.)
To make matters worse, some dogs’ pre-potty behavior is, to put 
it mildly, erratic. Cory sometimes offered no warning at all that 
he was about to eliminate outdoors. He’d just be walking along 
when suddenly he’d stop and do the deed before I even realized 
what was going on. Other times, he’d pull so many false alarms 
that I gave up trying to anticipate when he’d actually go. Allie, my 
present canine companion, has also mastered the dubious art of 
the false alarm, going so far as to actually squat and then stand 
up and begin moving again without having unloaded anything. 
Consequently, I’ve had a hard time teaching each dog to potty on 
cue, because they offered conflicting information about when they 
were really going to go.
 
But even if your dog defies your efforts to teach him a potty 
prompt, you can still speed up his pee-pee process. Here’s how:
 
✓ Fake him out. So what if it’s raining? If you act as if walking 
in a downpour is more fun than playing fetch, your dog may 
believe you — and that belief may help him relax enough to go.

 Chapter 8: Fine-Tuning Housetraining 125
 
✓ Stay loose. A dog is more likely to do his business if he’s relaxed 
rather than tense. For that reason, be sure to stay relaxed, calm, 
and happy when you take your dog out for a potty break. If 
you feel yourself tensing up because your dog won’t go, take 
him back inside and try again in a few minutes when you’re 
both more relaxed.
 
✓ Praise him before the fact. If your dog shows the slightest 
hint that he’s going to go — for me, it’s when Allie moves from 
the sidewalk to the grass of the median strip — praise him lav-
ishly. By doing so, you may help him realize that he’s got the 
right idea and encourage him to follow through.
 
✓ Find a familiar spot. Often, you can jump-start your dog’s 
urge to pee by taking him to the spot he anointed on his previ-
ous trip out. Chances are he’ll remember what he did there 
before and do it again.
 
✓ Find a communal potty. If you can’t remember where your 
dog went during your previous trip outside, take him some-
place where you know other dogs have pottied. The scent of 
previously deposited canine calling cards may prompt your 
dog to leave a card of his own.
Both Cory and Allie tended to employ a kind of Murphy’s Law to 
their bad-weather bathroom maneuvers. At the times that I most 
wanted them to pee when I said to — such as late at night and/
or during a downpour — my canine companions often decided 
to vie for the title of Mr. or Ms. Iron Bladder. Be it hail or snow, 
rain or sleet, when the weather was bad, Cory tended to shut his 
floodgates tight. If I got uptight or angry over this pee-pee retentive 
behavior, he made it clear that he thought any sort of walk was a 
bad idea. He’d actually try to pull me back into the house. Allie’s 
not quite as sensitive as my Sheltie guy was, but her distaste for 
whizzing in bad weather, much less dumping, becomes quite clear 
when the rain is pouring or the wind is howling.
Deciding When to Grant
More Freedom
The fact that your dog has become a housetraining ace doesn’t 
necessarily mean that she’s ready to have full run of your house. 
Many housetraining graduates still need to have their access to 
their homes restricted. The reasons such restrictions may be neces-
sary basically boil down to two: Either your puppy isn’t old enough 
to be considered truly housetrained, or she’s not dependable 
enough to leave your stuff alone when she’s left alone.

Part II: Putting a Plan in Place  
126
The age factor: How old 
is old enough?
One issue you need to keep in mind when determining whether 
your little pooch is ready for more freedom is age. Even if your puppy 
shows signs of being a housetraining prodigy, think twice about 
declaring her fully housetrained if she’s less than 6 months old.
A puppy under the age of 6 months may know when and where it’s 
okay to potty, but she may not always be physically able to keep 
from occasionally anointing your carpet or making a deposit on 
your floor — especially if she doesn’t have fairly frequent access to 
her designated bathroom.
So even if your precocious little darling hasn’t had an accident 
in weeks, don’t assume that she can hold it at any and all times. 
And don’t push the outer edge of her potty endurance envelope. 
Continue to keep her confined when you can’t supervise her until 
she at least passes her half-year birthday.
Here’s my card: Leaving a message
In the “Encouraging Elimination” section, I lament my problems teaching my own 
dogs to go on cue. But experts note that I shouldn’t consider my inability to teach 
a potty prompt to be a failure on my part or a lack of intelligence on the parts of 
my dogs Cory and Allie. Such dogs just may not be interested in learning to pee on 
cue. The reason: For such dogs, the act of urinating means a whole lot more than 
emptying their bladders.
Certain dogs actually value their urine. Such dogs sprinkle pee carefully onto only 
what they consider to be the very best surfaces — surfaces they’ve selected on 
the basis of size, prominence, and preexisting odors. For these canines, their pee is 
their calling card — their announcement at a local street corner that they’ve been 
at that corner. These dogs are much less likely to evacuate their bladders at times 
and places they haven’t chosen than other, less exacting dogs are.
Such dogs also sniff the ground, the pole beneath the corner stop sign, and just 
about any other vertical object to determine whether other dogs have left their 
calling cards behind. A dog can tell a lot about another dog simply by sniffing a 
drop of that dog’s pee. For example, one sniff of a local canine potty place can tell 
a romance-seeking male dog not only whether ladies have been in the area but 
also whether those ladies are in the mood for love (in other words, whether they’re 
in heat).

 Chapter 8: Fine-Tuning Housetraining 127
Even after you decide to loosen the reins a bit, give her only a little 
unsupervised freedom at a time. Just as you wouldn’t let a newly 
licensed teenage driver attempt a cross-country trip immediately, 
you shouldn’t let a newly housetrained puppy have immediate 
access to your entire house all day.
 
Confine your housetraining graduate to one or two rooms for a 
couple of hours or so and see how she does. Watch to see not only 
whether she holds her poop and pee but also whether she decides 
to dig or chew on any forbidden household objects. If she passes 
muster, gradually give her more freedom. But as with human chil-
dren, don’t give your dog too much freedom too soon.
The responsibility factor: Should 
she have freedom of the house?
Another point to consider when deciding to give your dog more 
roaming rights is dependability. Even if your dog or puppy has 
mastered the fine art of housetraining, that doesn’t mean she 
should have total freedom of the house — at least not when you’re 
out of the house. That depends on her maturity level and history of 
behavior when left alone.
Even if your housetraining ace knows not to do her business inside 
your domicile, she may indulge her desire to make other mischief 
in said domicile. Allie, my Golden Retriever, is a case in point. Even 
after she became a housetraining graduate, she would cause other 
problems, such as going into the garbage, scratching on the sofa 
(and pulling out the stuffing), chewing the TV remote, unwinding 
toilet paper, and shredding magazines within her reach, sometimes 
right under our very noses.
 
How do you determine whether your dog is ready to be left unsu-
pervised in the house? You probably need to engage in a little trial 
and error. Try leaving her alone for brief periods of time and see 
how she does. Initially start at 5 minutes and gradually increase to 
up to 30 minutes. If she hasn’t started wreaking havoc in 30 min-
utes, she’s probably ready to spend alone time outside the crate. 
Even then, though, proceed cautiously and reduce temptation. 
Here’s how:
 
✓ Start slow. Begin your dog’s road to freedom by giving her 
access to only one or two rooms in the house while you’re away. 
If she doesn’t engage in destructive or otherwise undesirable 
behavior, you can gradually allow her to spend time in more 
rooms of the house.

Part II: Putting a Plan in Place  
128
 
✓ Remove temptation. Your dog’s chances of handling her 
newly bestowed freedom successfully increase if you set her 
up for that success. So if you know she likes to chew up toilet 
paper, keep your bathroom door closed. If she’s a champion 
counter-surfer, make sure no food’s left out on your kitchen 
counter. If she likes to raid the garbage, block access to the 
garbage can. If laundry is her thing, keep the laundry room 
door closed and block her access to all clothes hampers. You 
get the idea.
 
✓ Secure items before leaving. At least in the initial stages of 
allowing your dog freedom of the house, take the time before 
you leave to make sure you haven’t left any temptations for her.
My family and I quickly learned to reduce Allie’s environmental 
temptations by closing bathroom doors, blocking off the garbage 
can with barstools and the sofa with dining chairs, and putting 
magazines and TV remotes beyond her reach. But for four years 
or so thereafter, we also crated Allie (using the nighty-night cue I 
describe in Chapter 5) whenever we left the house just to protect 
our stuff from the ravages of her paws and chompers. Only since 
she turned 5 and started showing some semblance of doggie dignity 
and respect for our possessions while we were in the house — 
and after she successfully dealt with short increments of freedom 
when we left the house — did we begin to allow her freedom of the 
house any time we went out, no matter how long we were gone. 
And she’s done fine — notwithstanding the shredded magazine 
that I found on the floor after I got back from running errands this 
morning. But that was my bad: I should’ve put it out of her reach 
before I left.

enerally, housetraining proceeds pretty smoothly 
after you get the hang of it. Still, just as with any new 
endeavor, progress may take the form of going two steps 
forward, one step back. Here, you get the lowdown on 
how to deal effectively with the main reasons those back-
ward steps occur: a dog’s behavioral problems, a dog’s 
health problems, and (alas!) problems caused by the

A
lmost every dog has housetraining problems at one time 
or another. Some pooches have trouble mastering their 
bathroom basics. Others ace Housetraining 101 but run into toilet 
trouble later. Whether your dog’s potty problems make him a slow 
learner or conflicted canine, help is at hand. Among the following 
profiles of dogs with potty issues may be one that sheds light on 
your housetrainee’s particular problem and how to solve it.
The Teensy-Weensy Tinkler
As a pet journalist, I’ve written my share of dog breed profiles 
for magazines and Web sites. One thing that’s always struck me 
is that whenever I’m writing about a very small dog, such as a 
Chihuahua or Shih Tzu, the owners I interview invariably tell me 
that these pint-sized pooches have big-sized housetraining prob-
lems. Basically, I’m told, the little guys and gals wash out of basic 
housetraining.
However, experts disagree among themselves as to whether that’s 
actually the case. Some do contend that very little dogs have some 
very big disadvantages when learning proper potty protocol. Here 
are some housetraining hurdles the experts suggest:
 
✓ Bladder size: Teensy-weensy dogs have teensy-weensy 
bladders that can’t hold very much urine. That means small 

Part III: Solving Housetraining Problems  
132
dogs have to discharge that urine a lot more often than their 
bigger counterparts need to — and a lot more often than their 
human owners may anticipate.
 
✓ Sense of space: Because they’re so little, small dogs’ sense 
of space differs from that of larger-sized dogs. For example, 
getting to an outdoor potty from inside the house may seem 
like a huge distance to a Chihuahua, whereas to a Golden 
Retriever, that same distance is just a hop, skip, and a jump 
away. Given such differences, the Chihuahua is less likely to 
reach his spot in time than the Golden is.
Other experts, though, contend that people, not pooches, are the 
reasons very small dogs can find housetraining more difficult. 
People who live with tiny tinklers may find these dogs so cute that 
they aren’t as vigilant about housetraining as people who have 
larger dogs are. Compounding the problem is the fact that les petits 
chiens make much smaller puddles than their bigger brethren do. 
Consequently, those puddles are far easier to overlook than the 
larger ponds and lakes that emerge from bigger dogs — at least 
until the little dog reanoints that same spot a few times or does 
that reanointing in front of a guest. Then it’s not okay — but it 
shouldn’t have been okay in the first place.
No matter what side of the debate you come down on, though, you 
can help your little dog become a housetraining ace. This section 
explains how.
Choose the right potty place
A little dog needs a potty place that she can get to quickly — or 
that you can get her to quickly. If you choose to have her do her 
business indoors, make sure her indoor potty is accessible at all 
times. And you don’t need to have just one such potty: Putting a 
litter box or other doggie toilet on each floor of your home can up 
the odds that your petite pooch will reach her spot in time. I dis-
cuss indoor training in Chapter 7.
If you’d rather have her do the doo outside, choose a potty spot 
that’s close to your home or apartment building, and take her to 
this spot for any and all potty breaks. See Chapter 6 for more on 
outdoor training.
Don’t push your luck 
(or her bladder)
Because your little dog’s capacity to hold her water or other stuff 
is limited, she’s more likely to respond to schedule changes with 

 Chapter 9: Accident-Proofing Problem Potty-ers 133
an unauthorized doggie offload. In other words, if you miss one 
of her scheduled bathroom breaks, you should count on having 
something to clean up later.
Be considerate of your teensy tinkler, particularly her teensy blad-
der. Simple logic seems to indicate that the little dog’s bladder 
needs relieving more often than the bigger dog’s larger bladder 
does. Either plan on either taking your small dog to her outdoor 
potty spot more often or opt for indoor training so she can get to 
an indoor bathroom all by herself.
 
Consistency helps your little dog develop her capacity to wait until 
she has a chance to potty in the proper place. For those reasons, 
setting up and sticking with a reasonable schedule is especially 
important when a housetraining student is big of heart but small in 
stature. I discuss setting up a schedule in Chapters 6 and 7.
Don’t excuse lapses
No matter how big or little the pooch is, she shouldn’t be allowed 
to pee or poop wherever she chooses. Canine bodily waste smells 
bad, stains carpets and floors, and contains bacteria that can make 
both dogs and people sick. Consequently, housetraining is just as 
important for little dogs as for big ones.
Don’t let your pint-sized pooch’s cuteness get in the way of teach-
ing her bathroom basics. If she has an accident, deal with it the 
same way you deal with an accident by a larger dog: Figure out 
what went wrong (specifically, what you did wrong) and resolve 
not to let it happen again.
 
As with larger dogs, a crucial component to successfully house-
training a small dog is to remove any and all residue of toileting 
transgressions — and the odors from such transgressions, too. Use 
a good cleaner designed especially for pet stains to remove the 
evidence of unauthorized tinkles. Failure to clean up promptly and 
thoroughly will have the same result no matter what your dog’s 
size is: She’ll come back and repeat her performance upon the very 
same spot. Chapter 3 discusses suitable cleaners.
The Dog Who Pees Lying Down
When you come home, does your canine companion fold her ears 
back, look away from you, and tuck her wagging tail between her 
legs? If you bend over to put the leash on her, does she roll onto 
her back? And does she dribble a little bit of urine at such times — 
whether lying on her back or standing on all fours?

Part III: Solving Housetraining Problems  
134
If so, take heart. Your dog doesn’t have a housetraining problem 
at all. The urine she dribbles doesn’t indicate a lack of bathroom 
manners. Instead, she’s trying to tell you that she worships the 
ground you walk on.
 
Dogs who look away from a person or another canine, tuck their 
tails between their legs, fold back their ears, and leak a little bit of 
urine are showing what experts call submissive behavior. In other 
words, they’re willing to yield to the wishes of the more dominant 
individual. The little puddle on the ground emphasizes this respect. 
And if the dog leaks this urine while lying on her back, she’s being 
even more submissive. She is not making a housetraining mistake.
You need to treat the submissive dog very gently. She’s a highly 
sensitive individual who needs your help to gain a little bit more 
self-confidence or at least time to collect herself so that she doesn’t 
pee on your floor or carpet. Here are some ideas to help her — and 
to rescue your floors.
Play it cool
Ignore her. Yes, really. When you come home in the evening or at 
any other time after being away for a while, don’t pay any attention 
to your ecstatic pooch, no matter how much she throws herself 
at you or tries to get your attention. By ignoring your submissive 
dog and giving her a few minutes to calm down, you reduce the 
likelihood that she’ll dribble. After a few minutes, you should be 
able to say hello to her.
When you do greet your dog, whether you’ve just returned from 
the other room or a long day at work, don’t make a big deal of it. 
Say a quiet hello, smile at her, and maybe give her a little pat. Don’t 
hug her, smooch her, coo to her, or make any excited baby talk to 
her, no matter how happy you are to see her. Your objective here 
is to help her stay calm so that she doesn’t pee.
And do extend your play-it-cool policy to visitors: Ask them to 
ignore your dog when they first enter your home. That way, she’ll 
have time to collect herself and calm down before she greets your 
company.
Get down to her level
 
Some submissive dogs start leaking when their human leaders 
stand over them — for example, to put on their leashes. If yours is 
such a pooch, try squatting or sitting on the floor so that your eyes 
are level with your dog’s.

 Chapter 9: Accident-Proofing Problem Potty-ers 135
By getting down to her level, you avoid giving your dog the mes-
sage that you are the leader and she is not. That message is what 
prompts her to pee in response. In effect, she’s saying, “I know 
you’re the boss, and I’ll do whatever you ask.” Don’t worry that 
your dog will decide to be Ms. Alpha if you try this technique. You 
can give your dog confidence without relinquishing your position 
and responsibility.
Don’t stare her down
Some submissive dogs start dribbling when their special persons 
look directly into their eyes. That’s because in dog-talk, a direct gaze 
or stare is considered a dominant, I’m-the-boss type of gesture — and 
a submissive dog will pee to show that she understands her lowly 
place in the family hierarchy. But if you look away, she won’t need 
to make that submissive response.
The Dog Who Leaves His Mark
If you’re seeing dribs and drabs of dog pee on vertical surfaces inside 
your home, your pooch probably doesn’t have a housetraining 
problem. A more likely possibility is that he’s dealing with turf or 
relationship issues.
 
Dogs pee not only because their bladders are full but also because 
they want to communicate with other canines. Just about any dog 
will sniff the place where another dog took a whiz, and often the
sniffer will decide to pee on the same spot. However, an intact male 
dog may lift his leg and direct a little jet stream onto vertical surfaces 
so that he can announce that those surfaces are part of his domain. 
In other words, such a dog uses his pee to mark his territory.
Dealing successfully with the Dog Who Leaves His Mark requires 
several actions. Here’s what you should do.
Neuter him
Your canine guy is likely to be less concerned about whose turf is 
whose if he’s not at the mercy of his raging canine male hormones. 
By neutering him, you give him some welcome relief (no, not that 
kind of relief!).
Make sure that any other animals in the house also are spayed or 
neutered. Your local animal shelter or rescue group may be able to 
direct you to low-cost spaying and neutering services.

136
Remove (or at least contain) 
the target
Sometimes you can deal with canine target practices by eliminat-
ing the dog’s access to the target. For example, if your dog likes to 
mark the chair in your partner’s home office, keep the door to that 
office closed. If your four-legged friend likes to direct his efforts 
toward your Christmas tree, consider enclosing the tree in an exercise 
pen, which resembles a floorless child’s playpen. I know someone 
who does just that; in fact, she even decorates the ex-pen so that it 
looks as though it was always meant to be part of her holiday décor. 
(For a description of ex-pens, check out Chapter 3.)
Remind him who’s top dog
A dog who’s engaging in marking behavior may need to be 
reminded who is the top dog in his household (and that should be 
you). As his benevolent leader, you should insist that he earn any 
privileges. Have him sit or ask him to do something else before you 
feed him, take him for a walk, start a play session, or do anything 
else that he enjoys.
 
If you haven’t done so already, find an obedience class for yourself 
and your dog. By teaching him maneuvers such as coming when 
called, sitting, and lying down, you make it clear to your dog that 
you’re the leader of his pack and that he has no need to tell you 
whose turf is whose.
Building Molly’s confidence
Years ago, I adopted a little mixed Poodle named Molly, who was a very submissive 
dog. Every day, she would greet my nightly homecomings by rolling onto her back 
and leaking urine onto my foyer floor.
To help Molly collect herself, I would restrain myself from petting her or even talking 
to her when I came home. Instead, I would silently sit on the floor and wait for her 
to come to me. When she reached me, I would look away from her and attach the 
leash to her collar. After several months of this routine, Molly finally felt sufficiently 
calm and confident to hold her water when I came home from work at night.

 Chapter 9: Accident-Proofing Problem Potty-ers 137
Build a peaceable kingdom
Years ago, when I was staying at a friend’s country home for the 
first time, I awoke in the middle of one night just in time to see my 
friend’s dog lift his leg and anoint the corner of the bed I was sleep-
ing in. The dog’s message was clear: I was an interloper, and he 
didn’t appreciate my presence.
If your dog is marking his turf because an unfamiliar human guest 
is in the house, show your canine companion that he has nothing 
to worry about. Have the guest play with or feed the dog. As soon 
as Fido realizes that the guest is a friend rather than a threat, the 
marking behavior may stop.
On the other hand, perhaps your dog is displaying his marksman-
ship to establish his place among the other four-legged members 
of your household. If that’s the case, try to resolve any conflicts 
between the marker and your other pets. Feed them separately from 
each other — at different times and/or in different locations — and 
try to give each animal equal amounts of affection.
Start remedial housetraining
If your dog likes to mark his territory, set up a housetraining rou-
tine such as the ones in Chapters 6 and 7 and follow it religiously 
until your dog confines his peeing to the papers, litter box, grate/
tray combo, or outdoors.
If you see your dog start to lift his leg and/or anoint a surface, 
distract him by clapping your hands or making some other loud 
noise. Then get him to his potty area pronto.
Also make sure that you thoroughly clean any area that your dog 
has anointed or pooped upon. Otherwise, the smell of the previous 
dousing will bring him to the same spot for an encore performance. 
Check out Chapter 3 for information on effective indoor cleaners.
 
Canine marking behavior can be difficult to, well, eliminate. If your 
dog persists in christening unauthorized areas, ask your vet for a 
referral to a qualified trainer, certified applied animal behaviorist, 
or veterinary behaviorist. The sidebar “Picking among experts” 
explains how these experts differ.

The Uptight Canine
Scientists are starting to realize that dogs experience at least some 
emotions that are very similar to those that humans experience. 
Among those emotions is anxiety. Yup, just as with people, certain 
situations cause certain dogs to get uptight — and some of those 
anxiety-ridden creatures end up having bathroom accidents.
Dogs are social creatures, so separation anxiety is one of the most 
common forms of anxiety in dogs. Although almost every dog rel-
ishes any and all opportunities to hang out with his people, some 
dogs really can’t deal with being left alone. Other dogs suffer from 
different kinds of anxiety. Some, for example, are terrified of thun-
derstorms (a prime example: the lead canine character in the book 
and movie Marley and Me.) Others freak out when they hear con-
struction noises. These unhappy campers cope with their prob-
lems in ways that often make their people unhappy as well. Some 
bark incessantly. Others can’t stop panting. Still others destroy the 
household furniture, carpets, or walls. And some, alas, have bath-
room accidents.
 
Unfortunately, remedial housetraining doesn’t work with anxiety-
ridden dogs, at least not right away. Before such a dog’s house-
training problem can be solved, she needs help from experts to 
determine what’s causing her anxiety and the resulting behavioral 
issues. The anxious dog’s veterinarian may choose to try treating 
the problem himself or may refer dog and owner to either a certi-
fied applied animal behaviorist or a veterinary behaviorist. Either 
way, treatment of anxiety takes two tracks simultaneously: reduc-
ing the anxiety and then modifying the behavior.
To reduce the anxiety, a veterinarian may prescribe medication 
specifically designed to treat such problems, such as clomip-
ramine (Clomicalm) or fluxeitine hydrochloride (Reconcile) for 
separation anxiety.
Another way to reduce the anxiety level is to use D.A.P., or Dog 
Appeasing Pheromone. This product mimics the properties of the 
pheromones produced by a mother dog who’s nursing puppies. A 
diffuser plugged into an electrical outlet distributes the product 
throughout the room. You can obtain products that use this phero-
mone over-the-counter, but consulting your vet first is prudent.
After the anxiety is reduced, efforts to modify the anxious behavior 
can begin. For a great discussion of how this works, consult Dog 
Training For Dummies, by Jack and Wendy Volhard (Wiley). By 
reducing the dog’s anxiety, you’re likely to reduce the problematic 
bathroom behavior.

 Chapter 9: Accident-Proofing Problem Potty-ers 139
Picking among experts
Twenty-first century dog owners are lucky. If their pooches have problems, these 
owners can choose among a wide range of experts to help solve those problems. 
The right expert to choose depends on what the problem is and how difficult it is to 
solve. Here’s what you need to know to find an expert to help your dog when you 
can’t help her on your own:
 ✓ Veterinarians: Vets are, in essence, physicians for animals. Just as physicians 
for humans follow their undergraduate educations with stints in medical school 
and internships in hospitals, veterinarians attend veterinary school and often 
complete internships in veterinary clinics. A veterinarian is the first person you 
should consult if something appears to be amiss with your dog, either physi-
cally or behaviorally. Often, a change in your dog’s behavior is a sign of a physi-
cal problem.
 ✓ Trainers: Trainers are individuals who specialize in teaching people how to 
help their dogs live happily and successfully in human households. You’re most 
likely to find a trainer in a group obedience class, but many trainers also do pri-
vate one-on-one consulting. If you’re looking to teach your dog or puppy basic 
good manners and want to do so in a group atmosphere, look for a trainer. You 
can find a searchable database of dog-friendly dog trainers at the Association 
of Pet Dog Trainers Web site (www.apdt.com).
 ✓ Certified applied animal behaviorists: These folks aren’t necessarily veterinar-
ians, but they do have extensive training in a biological or behavioral science, 
plus professional experience in dealing with complicated animal behavior 
problems. These experts, who are certified by the Animal Behavior Society 
(ABS), can help owners deal with problems that a trainer can’t solve. You can 
find a certified applied animal behaviorist through the searchable database at 
the ABS Web site (www.animalbehavior.org).
 ✓ Veterinary behaviorists: These are veterinarians who’ve completed an exten-
sive course of training, including an internship and residency in animal behav-
ior, after receiving their veterinary degrees and who’ve passed an examination 
given by the American College of Veterinary Behaviorists (ACVB). Unlike certi-
fied applied animal behaviorists (unless those behaviorists are veterinarians), 
any veterinary behaviorist can prescribe medication to deal with certain chal-
lenging behavioral problems, such as separation anxiety. Many veterinary 
behaviorists are affiliated with colleges of veterinary medicine or with large 
specialty veterinary practices. Generally, veterinarians must refer their clients 
to these specialists, but you can also find one by logging onto the ACVB Web 
site at www.veterinarybehaviorists.org and running through the 
site’s searchable database.

However, a dog need not encounter an alligator near his bathroom 
to want to find a new one. Dogs can develop phobias about their 
potty spots or other aspects of their lives for reasons that their 
people can’t determine. In any case, if your dog suddenly balks at 
using his potty place, your best bet may be to do what he wants: 
Find him a new place to potty. Every time he goes in that new 
place, reward him with lots of praise and a small treat.
At the same time, engage in some remedial housetraining. Crate 
the dog when you can’t watch him so he doesn’t continue to go in 
the wrong place. If you slip up and he does, clean up thoroughly 
and without comment. As he becomes accustomed to the new 
bathroom and begins going reliably in the new potty place, you can 
begin letting him out of the crate for longer periods.
The Dog Who Gets Distracted
Does your four-legged friend seem more interested in chasing off 
any squirrels or other critters who invade your backyard than 
in doing her business there? Does she pick up a stick for you to 
throw as soon as you enter the yard? If you take her for a walk, is 
she more likely to bark at the dog ambling on the other side of the 
street than to poop or pee? In other words, when it’s time for your 
pooch to potty, does pottying appear to be the last thing she wants 
to do?
If so, you have the Dog Who Gets Distracted. To bring her attention 
back to her job — to poop or pee — you need to take on the job of 
minimizing distractions. If your dog gets sidetracked while out in 
the yard, consider walking her on the leash to her potty area until 
she remembers why she’s supposed to be out there. If her lack of 
focus occurs while you’re out walking her, take steps to regain her 
attention. For example, try turning around and walking in the oppo-
site direction.
 
If your dog seems easily distracted, consider adjusting your 
pooch’s bathroom schedule. Your dog may be uninterested in 
doing her duty simply because she doesn’t have to go, especially 
if she’s an older puppy who’s still on a younger puppy’s schedule. 
If your distractible friend is over 5 months of age but you’re still 
taking her out every couple of hours, give yourself a break. Let 
her hold her water longer, and she’ll probably do her duty more 
promptly when you do take her out.

 Chapter 9: Accident-Proofing Problem Potty-ers 141
The Fair-Weather Piddler
Although the U.S. Postal Service claims that neither rain nor sleet 
nor hail prevents the delivery of the U.S. mail, some dogs appear to 
believe that the onset of such weather is a perfectly natural reason 
to refuse to perform their outdoor duties. Alas, these pooches just 
don’t want to do their business under less-than-ideal weather 
conditions.
The best way to deal with such circumstances is to leverage your 
dog’s instincts in your favor. Any time you want him to do his busi-
ness quickly, take him to the place he whizzed or pooped upon 
during his previous trip out. Odds are he’ll smell his previous 
anointing and the odor will jog his memory and prompt him to per-
form an encore.
If taking him to his previous potty spot doesn’t work, bring him to 
a place where you know other pooches have pottied. Most dogs 
confronted with other canine calling cards feel compelled to leave 
some of their own, no matter how inclement the weather is.
A little protection from the elements may also help, particularly 
with small dogs or short-haired dogs who feel the effects of rain 
and cold temperatures more intensely. Consider buying a raincoat 
and/or a sweater if your four-legged friend is one of these weather-
sensitive individuals.
Finally, be prepared to brave the elements yourself if you want to 
be sure your dog has done her business. That means snapping on 
the leash and trudging through the rain or snow until your doggie 
downloads — or at least accompanying her to your backyard to 
make sure she really does what she’s supposed to do.
The Bedwetter
Although most dogs will do almost anything to avoid peeing in the 
places where they sleep, some pooches do wet their beds. However, 
such behavior isn’t normal, and you shouldn’t treat it as such.
The bad news here is that a dog who wets her bed is invariably 
a dog with a medical problem; she needs to see a veterinarian as 
soon as possible. The good news is that the Bedwetter’s problem 
is generally not serious and almost always is very treatable.

Part III: Solving Housetraining Problems  
142
Among the dogs most likely to leak urine in their sleep are older 
spayed females. Just as older human females tend to have more 
trouble holding their water than their younger sisters do, such is 
the case with older canine females. In addition, spaying can lead 
to a loss of tone in the urinary tract muscles, causing the dog to 
dribble in her sleep. In such cases, veterinarians often prescribe a 
short course of either phenylpropanolamine (PPA) or diethylstil-
bestrol (DES), a treatment that lasts only a few days or maybe a 
week. The latter is a synthetic compound that has the properties 
of natural estrogens and can help a dowager doggie stay dry all 
night long.
 
If you’re pregnant — or are trying to become pregnant — do not 
administer DES to your bedwetting female dog. Have someone else 
do it. DES has been known to cause miscarriages, birth defects, 
and long-term problems among human babies.
Male dogs who wet their beds at night may be suffering from urinary 
tract infections or kidney infections. They, too, need veterinary 
treatment. In most cases, the vet will ask you to bring a urine sample 
and will prescribe two to three weeks of antibiotics. (For tips on 
collecting a urine sample, see Chapter 10.)
The Dog Who Gets Amnesia
Sometimes an impeccably housetrained dog seems to suddenly 
forget his bathroom manners. He may pee inside the house soon 
after returning from a trip to his outdoor potty. He may poop or pee 
in front of his human companion without having asked to go out.
If your dog appears to suffer from housetraining amnesia and 
if he’s more than 7 years of age, he may suffer from a condition 
called canine cognitive dysfunction syndrome, or CDS. The condition 
is very similar to human Alzheimer’s disease. In addition to the 
loss of housetraining skills, dogs with CDS may be disoriented, 
appear to no longer recognize the other members of the family, 
and sleep more during the day but less during the night.
Any elderly dog who exhibits symptoms of CDS should be seen by 
a veterinarian. The vet will examine your canine companion and 
order lab tests that can identify other possible causes of house-
training lapses and other problems, such as kidney or liver dis-
ease. If those causes are ruled out, a CDS diagnosis is likely.
CDS isn’t curable, but medication and a diet prescribed by your vet 
may slow its progress and alleviate some of its symptoms, includ-
ing housetraining amnesia.

 Chapter 9: Accident-Proofing Problem Potty-ers 143
The Dog Who Can’t Hold It
Unfortunately, some dogs can’t seem to help having accidents. 
Sometimes simple old age is the cause: After a dog enters senior-
hood (which usually starts at age 7 but can vary by breed, size, 
and other factors), the muscles in his urinary tract become slack, 
which can result in unwanted puddles. Other dogs may have suf-
fered an injury that makes bladder control sporadic, if not impos-
sible. Of course, you’re sympathetic to such a dog’s plight, but you 
also want to preserve your carpets and furniture and keep your 
house smelling fresh. What can you do?
Rule out other issues
Incontinence can result not only from old age and injury but also 
from conditions such as diabetes, Cushing’s disease, kidney dis-
ease, urinary tract infections, and urinary stones, all of which I 
discuss in Chapter 10. That’s why the incontinent dog’s first stop 
needs to be at his veterinarian. The vet can perform the tests 
needed to rule out these and other conditions.
Find a holistic vet
Acupuncture, herbs, and homeopathy may help solve or at least 
improve incontinence problems in some older dogs. Some veteri-
narians who practice Western-style medicine may also be trained 
in acupuncture, but if your vet isn’t one of them, check out the list 
at the American Holistic Veterinary Medical Association at www.
holisticvetlist.com. In any case, hold off on ordering herbs 
or trying holistic remedies until you consult a veterinarian.
Consider diapers
If nothing else works, doggie diapers may be the way to go. Pet 
product manufacturers sell both washable and disposable diapers; 
type the term “dog diapers” into an Internet search engine, and 
you’ll get over 80,000 hits.
 
Don’t use any of these diaper products for dogs who are being 
housetrained, who suffer from submissive urination (see the ear-
lier section “The Dog Who Pees Lying Down”), or for whom other 
conditions haven’t been ruled out. However, if your otherwise 
reasonably healthy dog simply can’t hold it and other solutions 
haven’t worked, diapers can be a reasonable remedy.

144
The Poop Eater
Some dogs, alas, are not content to eat the food that you prepare 
for them. They choose to eat other items as well, ranging from the 
merely bizarre to the out-and-out disgusting. In the latter category 
is that truly gross practice that experts call coprophagy (but which 
the rest of us call poop-eating or stool-eating). That stool may 
come from the Poop Eater or from some other animal.
 
No one really knows why a Poop Eater indulges in this pastime. 
Although some experts have speculated that a dog who eats stool 
suffers from some sort of nutritional deficiency, this belief hasn’t 
been proven. Others believe that the habit may result from anxiety 
or stress, particularly among dogs who spend a lot of time in ken-
nels. Either way, the practice not only grosses out the human but 
can also result in a dog’s ingesting parasites that may be infesting 
the stool.
The best way to deal with a Poop Eater is to keep him from getting 
to the poop in the first place. Walk your dog on a leash outdoors 
so you can keep him away from any poop lying on the ground. 
Better yet, don’t leave any poop on the ground. Clean it up right 
away. To discourage indoor poop-eating, keep your cat’s litter 
boxes out of your dog’s reach and change all litter boxes — feline 
or canine — frequently.
 
Your vet may be able to suggest products that discourage poop 
eating, too — but bear in mind that you’ll need to feed such prod-
ucts permanently to permanently end the behavior.
The Bleeding Lady, or the 
Canine Fertility Goddess
Is your female dog licking her private parts a lot? Do they look 
swollen? Is she bleeding from her vaginal area? If the answer to any 
of those questions is yes, your dog doesn’t have a housetraining 
problem. Instead, she’s exhibiting her canine womanhood.
That’s right: Your dog is experiencing something like the canine 
equivalent of a human menstrual period, but there’s a significant 
difference between the two. A human female’s menstrual period 
generally signals that she isn’t pregnant. A canine female’s menstrual 
period — more commonly known as her heat cycle — means that 
she can become pregnant if she mates with a male dog within 
about a week.

 Chapter 9: Accident-Proofing Problem Potty-ers 145
 
To deal with your female dog’s bloody discharge, get her some 
doggie diapers, which are available at most pet supply stores.
More important, though, is the need to keep your dog away from 
any and all male dogs if you don’t want her to have puppies. After 
her heat cycle is over, which is about three weeks after the first 
bloody discharge begins, have her spayed — either with your vet 
or through a low-cost spay/neuter clinic. That way, you’ll never 
again need to deal with heat cycles, overexcited male dogs, or the 
possibility that she could become pregnant unexpectedly. You’ll 
also make an important contribution to eliminating the problem of 
pet overpopulation.
Of course, you can prevent this problem completely if you spay 
your female dog before her first heat cycle occurs (usually at 7 to 
9 months of age). In doing so, not only will you spare yourself the 
mess of the heat cycle and the hassle of dealing with unwanted 
puppies, but you’ll also significantly reduce your dog’s chances of 
getting mammary cancer later in life.

Oh-No Can Become a

▶ Dealing with canine bathroom ailments
▶ Preventing gas
A
ll too often, dogs develop potty problems that have nothing 
to do with whether they’ve mastered housetraining. Instead, 
these apparent bathroom boo-boos actually signal that Fido’s not 
feeling well. Some of these bathroom-symptom illnesses are minor, 
but others can be serious or even life-threatening. Unfortunately, 
most people with pooches can’t tell which is which. That’s why 
you need to take your housetrainee to the veterinarian for a 
checkup if he appears to have forgotten his bathroom manners for 
more than a day or so.
In this chapter, I discuss some potty-related conditions and illnesses; 
however, remember that the list isn’t inclusive. Plenty of other 
health problems may cause symptoms that are similar or identical 
to those I describe here. The bottom line: If your dog’s bathroom 
behavior or output deviates significantly from what’s normal for 
him, he may well be sick. Put in a call to your veterinarian.
A Whiz of a Problem
Normally, a dog takes a whiz three or four times a day after she 
masters proper potty protocol. Depending on what time of day 
she performs her anointing, her pee may be bright yellow in color 
(first thing in the morning) or lighter yellow (later in the day or 

Part III: Solving Housetraining Problems  
148
whenever she’s held it for a while). Deviations from those norms 
can mean your pooch isn’t feeling up to par. Here are some examples 
of when peeing problems may signal health problems.
Constant peeing
A housetrained dog who’s suddenly peeing all over the house 
probably hasn’t developed bathroom amnesia. And if she gets to 
her potty spot but asks to go there every hour on the hour, her 
bladder hasn’t suddenly shrunk. In both cases, she’s probably 
developed a urinary tract infection, or UTI.
Although they’re uncomfortable (ask any person who’s gotten 
one!), UTIs aren’t necessarily serious — if they’re treated 
promptly. You can’t doctor these infections yourself, though. 
Treatment begins with a visit to your veterinarian. Your vet will 
examine your dog, analyze a urine sample, and prescribe the anti-
biotics needed to knock out the infection.
Antibiotics take several days to eliminate the UTI. In the meantime, 
though, here’s what you can do to make your canine companion 
more comfortable:
 
✓ Step up the bathroom breaks. A dog with a UTI who pees all 
the time is doing exactly what she needs to do: flush the infec-
tious bacteria out of her system. So to help your UTI-ridden 
friend help herself, let her take as many potty breaks as she 
needs. If your pooch potties outside, be prepared to let her 
out or take her to her potty area every couple of hours or so 
(or if you won’t be home, ask a neighbor to do so). If your dog 
uses papers or a litter box, make sure its location is never 
more than a few steps from where she is.
 
✓ Encourage her to drink. To encourage those potty breaks, do 
what you can to persuade your pooch to drink as much water 
as possible. Start by keeping her water dish filled with fresh 
water. Another good idea is to place water bowls in several 
areas of the house so your dog never needs to walk too far to 
get herself a drink.
 
✓ Finish those meds. Although a dog’s UTI symptoms generally 
abate after just a couple of days on antibiotics, it’s important 
to finish out the entire prescription, which can run as long as 21 
days. That’s because even though the symptoms have sub-
sided, the infection may still be present — and stopping the 
meds prematurely allows it to worsen. When that happens, 
the symptoms return with a vengeance.

Chapter 10: Understanding How an Oh-No Can Become a Problem-o 149
 
Your four-legged friend is much less likely to contract a UTI if she 
gets enough chances to discharge her urine. Don’t ask her to hold 
it more than eight hours or so at a time — and if you can provide 
more frequent bathroom breaks, so much the better.
Constant drinking and 
constant peeing
A dog who suddenly starts drinking more water than usual (and 
consequently starts peeing more than usual) may be suffering from 
one of several conditions. Some of these conditions are serious, 
and others aren’t. Here are just a few of the suspects:
 
✓ Hot weather: If your dog’s water intake rises soon after the 
onset of a heat wave, you can blame the weather. During hot 
spells, a dog may drink more water than usual simply to main-
tain a normal body temperature.
 
✓ Diabetes: Diabetes occurs when the pancreas produces either 
too little insulin or poorly functioning insulin. Either way, the 
amount of sugar in the bloodstream rises, and the individual 
drinks more water to dilute the sugar. Diabetic dogs also may 
have ravenous appetites and often are overweight. The treat-
ment for dogs with diabetes is the same as for humans with this 
disease: medication, nutritional management, and exercise.
 
✓ Kidney problems: When a dog’s kidneys aren’t functioning 
well, he urinates much more often than usual and can’t retain 
the fluids his body needs. Consequently, he tries to offset the 
loss by drinking more water, which in turn spurs still more 
peeing and fluid loss. Some kidney problems are simple infec-
tions that a vet can treat with antibiotics. Others are much 
more serious, though, involving permanent damage to the 
organ. Those also require a vet’s care and expertise.
 
✓ Cushing’s disease: This condition occurs when a dog’s body 
produces too much adrenal hormone. In addition to excessive 
drinking and urinating, a dog with Cushing’s may also suffer from 
hair loss, a drooping abdomen, panting, increased appetite, and 
muscle weakness. Treatment depends on what’s causing the 
overproduction of adrenal hormone in the first place.
The problem with constant drinking and peeing is that only a vet-
erinarian can perform the tests needed to diagnose and treat a dog 
with such symptoms. Bottom line: Get your canine to his doctor if 
he’s suddenly starting to pee and drink more often.

Pee that comes out 
slowly or not at all
Some dogs do their darndest to pee, only to have little to show for 
their efforts. They perform their pre-potty maneuvers, position 
themselves accordingly, and then release next to nothing. Maybe a 
drop or two emerges, if that.
 
A dog who is clearly straining to pee needs to see a veterinarian 
right away. Your dog may well have urinary stones, which can be 
fatal if left untreated.
 
Urinary stones form when minerals that usually pass from the dog’s 
body when he pees clump together instead. Generally, these stones 
are located in the bladder, but sometimes they move to the urethra, 
which leads from the bladder to the outside of the body. If a stone 
is large enough, it can become trapped in the urethra, restricting 
or even completely blocking the urinary flow. A total blockage can 
cause acute kidney failure, which in turn can kill the dog.
To determine whether a dog has stones, a vet palpates the abdo-
men, analyzes a urine sample, and may X-ray or perform an 
ultrasound of the dog’s abdomen. After stones are discovered, 
treatment depends on the type of mineral that forms the stone. 
Some stones respond to medicines and/or foods that change the 
urine’s chemistry, but others need to be removed surgically.
 
If your vet tells you that your dog’s stones are made of calcium 
oxalate, substitute distilled or filtered water for the tap water your 
dog drinks. The absence of minerals in distilled or filtered water 
can help prevent such stones from forming.
Oddly colored pee
A dog’s pee should be yellow — although the intensity of that 
yellow color may vary, depending on how long ago the previous 
potty break was. If at any time your canine companion’s urine 
doesn’t evoke thoughts of the late Frank Zappa’s notorious ditty, 
“Don’t Eat the Yellow Snow,” you need to call your vet. Here’s what 
urine color can tell you:
 
✓ Dark-looking urine (either rust-colored or slightly red): This 
signals the presence of blood. Bloody urine may result from 
a urinary tract infection (see the earlier section “Constant 
peeing”), or it can signal an internal injury. Blood clotting 
disorders or urinary stones (see the preceding section) may also 
be the culprits. In any case, a trip to the vet is in order.

Chapter 10: Understanding How an Oh-No Can Become a Problem-o 151
 
✓ Very light-colored or clear urine, especially first thing in 
the morning: This may mean that your dog’s kidneys aren’t 
retaining as much water for her body as they should be. Such 
a dog also may be peeing a lot and drinking more water than 
usual. Among the possible causes are diabetes, kidney disease, 
and Cushing’s disease (see the preceding sections). Any way 
you look at it, though, the bottom line’s the same: Get your 
four-legged friend to her veterinarian as soon as possible.
The Scoop on Poop Problems
A dog’s poop can tell her person much about the state of that 
dog’s health. Here are examples of when a dog’s poop may be tell-
ing you that the pooper is sick.
Poop on the run(s)
Dog poop should be firm and compact, and it shouldn’t stink — at 
least not very much. All too often, though, a dog’s poop not only 
smells bad but also comes out fast, furious, and often. To make 
matters worse, it looks very runny. In other words, the dog has 
diarrhea.
A dog can get diarrhea for a lot of reasons. Some are serious and 
require a veterinarian’s attention. Others aren’t as big of a deal, 
and they respond to home care.
 
Young puppies with diarrhea who vomit more than once an hour 
over a half-day or so should see a veterinarian immediately.
If the situation isn’t that urgent, here’s what you can do to help 
reduce the runs:
 
1. Forget about food for the first day.
 
 If your dog has more than one runny bowel movement in 
a given day, hold off on feeding her for the next day or so. 
Your dog’s digestive system, which has been working over-
time, needs to take a breather. A 24-hour fast gives your 
canine’s digestive tract the time it needs to calm down a 
little bit.
 
 Diarrhea can dehydrate a dog pretty quickly because that 
runny poop draws liquids from a dog’s body systems. To 
forestall dehydration, keep fresh water available for your 
four-legged friend and consider placing several water bowls 
around your house so she can take a drink more easily.

Part III: Solving Housetraining Problems  
152
 
2. Start a bland diet after a day or so.
 
 Start giving your dog some food that’s easy on the tummy. 
A good foundation for a bland diet is a mixture of boiled 
rice and hamburger. Be sure to pour off any fat from the 
hamburger before you serve it to your dog; leaving in the 
grease can bring on a new round of the runs. Make sure, 
too, that food is sufficiently cool before serving so that your 
dog doesn’t burn her tongue. If you don’t want to cook ham-
burger, add some lowfat cottage cheese to the rice.
 
3. If your dog still has the runs after two days, call your 
veterinarian.
 
 Most simple cases of doggie diarrhea abate within a day or 
two, so call your vet if the problem continues. If your dog 
is also vomiting and drinking a lot of water, call your vet 
sooner.
Soft, stinky poop
Dog poop should be formed enough so you can pick it up easily 
without leaving much behind. But is your dog’s poop full of mucus?
 Is it really soft when you scoop it up? And does it stink to high 
heaven? The cause may be a food that disagrees with your canine 
companion’s digestive system, or it may be the presence of a para-
site. Here’s how to solve either problem:
 
✓ Look for a pattern. If you feed your dog a varied diet, try 
to determine whether his stinky-poop episodes occur after 
he eats one particular food. For example, I noticed that my 
Golden Retriever, Allie, would produce soft, stinky, mucus-
filled poop — not to mention become a gasbag — whenever 
I fed her canned mackerel. When I stopped feeding her the 
mackerel, her noxious gas and poop stopped, too.
 
✓ Purge the parasite (with a vet’s help). Your dog may have 
giardia, a protozoan parasite. Besides soft stools, other symp-
toms of canine giardiasis include diarrhea, diminished appe-
tite, weight loss, vomiting, and traces of blood in the stool. 
Veterinarians report that they’re seeing more and more dogs 
with giardiasis, which usually spreads when a dog drinks con-
taminated water or walks through damp areas and licks his 
feet afterward.
 
 As with so many other bathroom maladies, getting rid of giar-
dia requires a veterinarian’s expertise. The most common 
remedy is an antibacterial drug called metronidazole, better 
known as Flagyl.

Chapter 10: Understanding How an Oh-No Can Become a Problem-o 153
 
You can help keep giardia at bay by following good sanitary prac-
tices such as washing your hands whenever you handle an infected 
animal. And because these unwelcome little critters thrive in damp 
environments, keeping the dog’s living area dry is a very good idea.
Oily poop
Is your dog’s poop oily and greasy-looking? Has she had diarrhea 
for a long time, despite the efforts of you and your veterinarian to 
treat her? Is her coat thin-looking? Does she look malnourished?
If so, your dog’s problem may be her pancreas. This organ pro-
duces not only the hormone insulin but also special enzymes that 
help her body digest the nutrients in her food. Sometimes the pan-
creas doesn’t produce enough of those enzymes, particularly those 
that break down the fat in foods. Consequently, the fat passes 
through the body and ends up in the poop, giving the stool that 
greasy look. A dog with this condition is suffering from exocrine 
pancreatic insufficiency, or EPI. Among the breeds that are prone to 
this condition are German Shepherd Dogs and Great Danes.
Many cases of EPI can be treated by putting the dog on a lowfat 
diet and prescribing medicines that contain the digestive enzymes 
the dog can’t produce. But only your veterinarian can determine 
whether EPI is causing your dog’s pooping problem, so before you 
do anything else, bring your dog to her doctor.
Poop that comes out slowly 
or not at all
If your dog’s poop comes out very slowly despite his best efforts to 
produce some, he may be constipated — the opposite of diarrhea. 
Like diarrhea, constipation can signal either a minor problem or a 
major ailment. The trick is to know which is which. Waiting for a 
little while — no more than a day — should result in an answer.
Meanwhile, try the following relief-producing measures for your 
anal-retentive friend:
 
✓ Give some veggies. Many dogs enjoy getting some vegetables 
with their daily rations, and this is one dietary preference 
that can be good for your canine companion. Vegetables such 
as carrots, green beans, broccoli, and beets provide the bulk 
needed to loosen up a puppy’s poop-maker. In addition, they’re 
low in calories, which makes them terrific treats for pudgy 
pooches. Cook veggies and then puree them in your blender or 
food processor so that they’re easy for your dog to eat.

Part III: Solving Housetraining Problems  
154
 
 Try giving your dog canned pumpkin not only to combat con-
stipation but also to help deal with diarrhea (yes, it works for 
both!) and just generally keep him regular. Make sure, though, 
that you give your dog plain canned pumpkin, not pumpkin 
pie filling, which has too much sugar for dogs. Your vet can 
tell you how much pumpkin to serve per meal.
 
✓ Lay on the liquid. Your dog needs water to stay healthy, and 
extra water can soften the stool that’s packed inside your 
pooch. Keep your friend’s water dish filled with fresh, cool 
water — and if he’s still not drinking, try placing several water 
bowls throughout the house.
 
✓ Get him moving. Simple constipation often clears up with 
some extra exercise — additional movement on the outside 
gets a dog’s insides going, too.
 
✓ Know when to get help. If your dog’s symptoms don’t clear 
up in a day or so and he’s clearly trying to take a dump, take 
him to your vet. He may be suffering from a bowel obstruction 
or other serious problem. If he begins to vomit, see your vet 
sooner.
 
Resist the temptation to feed your dog leftover cooked bones from 
that steak or pork chop you ate. Such bones can cause serious 
bowel obstructions.
Poop that contains other things
Sometimes a dog’s poop consists of more than just bodily waste. 
In such cases, even a cursory glance can often reveal the presence 
of substances that are decidedly unpoopy. Those substances may 
result from dietary indiscretions by your dog, less-than-optimum 
food preparation by you, or the presence of unwanted critters 
in your dog’s digestive system. Here are some common foreign 
bodies that appear in canine poop and how to deal with them.
Worms disguised as grains, sprouts, or pasta
If your dog’s deposits look like they’re laced with grains, sprouts, 
or pasta, she probably has worms. A tapeworm infestation shows 
up in the stool as little bits of rice. Roundworms, on the other 
hand, look like thin spaghetti or alfalfa sprouts. With either para-
site, rely on your vet to provide proper treatment.
 
Even if you don’t see signs of parasites in your dog’s poop, have 
your vet check a sample of your dog’s stool at least once a year for 
worms and other problems.

Chapter 10: Understanding How an Oh-No Can Become a Problem-o 155
Threads or pieces of plastic
Maybe you’re seeing little bits of plastic or thread in your dog’s 
stool. If so, your buddy’s probably eating his toys or some socks in 
addition to (or instead of) his usual fare.
 
Plastic toys with small parts can be especially dangerous because 
your dog can choke on them. Toys with squeakers can be particularly 
challenging if your dog swallows the squeaker. Socks may be equally 
hazardous because they can cause a blockage in a dog’s digestive 
tract. Other hazards to dogs’ digestive tracts include rope toys, 
Christmas tinsel, and all manner of poisonous plants (visit the Web 
site of the ASPCA Animal Poison Control Center at www.aspca.
org/pet-care/poison-control for a list of toxic plants).
The best remedy here is prevention. Don’t hang tinsel on your 
Christmas tree, bypass rope toys, keep houseplants inaccessible 
to your dog, and pick up socks from the floor. And make sure that 
your dog is playing with his toys, not eating them.
That said, if your vigilance isn’t enough and your dog manages 
to scarf something he shouldn’t, put in a call to your vet. If the 
dietary indiscretion consists of small pieces of a toy or a squeaker, 
your dog may well pass those pieces in his stool — but put in a call 
to your vet, just to be sure. Larger items like socks probably won’t 
make it through and will need to be removed surgically.
Veggie chunks
If your dog likes vegetables, you may find chunks of those vegeta-
bles in your pooch’s poop. That’s because dogs can’t absorb the 
nutrients in vegetables unless they’re chopped up to a very fine 
degree. The remedy here: Sharpen your veggie-chopping skills or 
haul out the food processor.
Gray, black, or red poop
Although healthy canine urine is yellow in color, the color of 
healthy canine stool can vary considerably. Depending on what 
the dog has eaten and the amount of bile in her system, her poop 
can range from tan to dark brown in color and even sometimes 
be green or orange (the latter color can result when a dog eats 
canned pumpkin or sweet potatoes). However, some colors indi-
cate health problems:
 
✓ Gray or cement in color: Your dog may be suffering from an 
obstruction in her bile duct. Such obstructions can signal the 
presence of a gall bladder problem, a tumor, or pancreatitis

Part III: Solving Housetraining Problems  
156
(inflammation of the pancreas). In any case, gray poop 
requires that you and your dog visit her veterinarian.
 
✓ Black or very dark brown: Your dog may be bleeding from 
her stomach or elsewhere in her upper digestive tract. Such 
stool, particularly if the poop resembles wet coffee grounds, 
can indicate the presence of a tumor or an ulcer. Other possible 
causes include kidney or liver disease, gastritis, or inflammatory 
bowel disease.
 
✓ Red: If you see red blood in your dog’s poop, she’s probably 
suffering from a condition of the colon or rectum, such as 
colitis or a tumor in the rectum.
No matter what the cause, the presence of blood in the stool indi-
cates that a serious health problem is likely afoot. A call and visit 
to your vet is in order.
Skinny poop
If your dog’s poop looks like thin strips, he may be suffering from a 
narrowing in his large intestine or his rectum. The causes may be 
an enlarged prostate (in intact male dogs), a mass or tumor press-
ing on the large intestine, or a problem from within either of those 
two organs. Call your veterinarian and book an appointment as 
soon as possible.
Gaseous Emissions
Most doggie farts result from mundane causes: eating too quickly 
or eating the wrong things. Here’s how to turn your gasbag of a doggie 
into a more comfortable canine (and a better-smelling one, too!):
 
✓ Slow his intake. A dog often starts tooting if he’s scarfed 
his meal too quickly. If your canine companion seems to 
inhale his meals, try feeding him from a bowl that’s specifi-
cally designed to slow down his food intake. Generally, these 
products are divided into sections that force the dog to pause 
between gulps because he can’t put his entire face into the 
bowl. Among the available products are the DogPause bowl 
(www.dogpausebowl.com) and the Eat Slower pet dish 
(www.eatslowerpetdishes.com). A similar product is the 
Durapet Slow-Feed Bowl, which features a raised dome in the 
middle of the dish.

Collecting potty samples
To figure out what may be causing a dog’s potty problems, veterinarians need to 
analyze the pooch’s bathroom output. Unfortunately, vets can’t send their patients 
to the bathroom down the hall and ask them to pee into a cup, nor can they give 
them one of those stool smear sample cards to use. That means that you have to 
find a way to collect the poop and pee samples that your veterinarian needs to help 
your four-legged friend.
However, these tasks need not be daunting. To collect either urine or stool, all 
you need are an oblong plastic bag (such as the kinds that newspapers and bread 
loaves are wrapped in) and an airtight plastic container. Armed with your sampling 
equipment, proceed to collect your dog’s urine as follows:
 1. Take your dog to her potty spot.
 2. Pull the plastic bag over your hand and wrist.
 3. Hold the plastic container with your bagged hand.
 4. Watch your dog carefully, and as soon as she bends her knees (or he lifts his 
leg), push the container into position with your bagged hand.
 
 That way, any errant dog pee splashes on the bag rather than on you.
 5. Cover the container.
 6. Remove the bag from your hand and put it in the trash.
 7. Bring the container to your veterinarian as soon as possible.
Collecting a dog’s poop is even easier. Here’s what you need to do:
 1. Put the plastic bag over your hand.
 2. Take your dog to her potty spot.
 3. Watch for signs that your dog’s about to do the doo, and after she’s finished, 
pick up the poop with your bagged hand.
 4. With the other hand, pull the bag inside out.
 
 The poop is now inside the bag, at the bottom.
 5. Knot the bag with your hand.
 
 If you want to, put the bagged poop in the airtight container.
The fresher the sample, the more accurate the analysis will be. Experts suggest 
that the sample be no more than 12 hours old — but if you keep it in the fridge or 
outdoors in cold temperatures, a 24-hour-old sample will be okay. If you can’t get a 
sample or if a sterile sample is needed, your veterinarian can do the job.

✓ Examine his diet. A sudden change of diet can prompt a pooch 
to turn on the toots. If your dog’s turning flatulent, try switch-
ing him back to his old diet for a week or so. If you took him off 
his old diet for medical reasons, consult your vet concerning 
what other dietary options are appropriate for your dog.
 
✓ Introduce additives. A gassy Lassie may benefit from having 
activated charcoal (available at local pharmacies) or diges-
tive-enzyme supplements added to her food. Such products 
can ease digestion by absorbing the gas or other materials 
that are irritating your dog’s digestive tract and causing her to 
toot. Follow the instructions on the package or consult your 
vet to figure out how much to give.
 
A dog who’s not only gaseous but also retching, unable to lie 
down, and with a larger-than-usual abdomen may be suffering from 
an extremely serious condition called bloat — the swelling and/
or twisting of the stomach. Large dogs with deep chests, such as 
Rottweilers, Labrador Retrievers, and Great Danes, are especially 
prone to this condition, but it can happen to any dog, especially 
if he exercises within an hour or so after a meal. This condition is 
fatal if not treated quickly. If your dog shows any signs of bloat, get 
him to the nearest veterinary clinic as soon as possible.
Getting wind of doggie displeasure
True story: Once upon a time, many years ago, my family and I lived with a Miniature 
Dachshund named Casey. He was small in physical stature, but he clearly consid-
ered himself to be a big guy in every other way. As such, he appeared to believe 
that hopping up on the sofa and taking up the space where his humans liked to sit 
was perfectly okay.
One time, though, my mother disagreed and ordered Casey off the couch so she 
could settle in and watch some television. Casey complied but not without making 
his displeasure clear: As he hopped off the couch and hit the floor, he tooted. While 
we humans were left to deal with the stench of that toot, Casey nonchalantly trotted 
upstairs with nary a backward glance.

S
ome of the challenges a puppy or dog faces during house-
training are not of her making. Such challenges are generally 
those her humans pose. Perhaps different humans in her house-
hold have different ideas about housetraining. Perhaps the humans 
are putting her in her crate and expecting her to hold it for hours 
on end. Maybe they’re giving her too many treats or not cleaning 
up completely when she makes a mistake.
Maybe changes in her life or the lives of her people are causing 
her to hit a housetraining plateau — or worse, regress. Another 
challenge may occur when she joins her family on a road trip, even 
if she’s a housetraining ace. And all too often, dogs who come from 
rescue groups or animal shelters face special challenges as they 
attempt to master Housetraining 101. That’s not the fault of their 
temporary caregivers at the shelter or in foster care, but such dogs 
nevertheless experience challenges over which they have little or 
no control.
This chapter helps you deal with special circumstances that can 
beset the canine housetrainee and the human members 
of her pack.

Part III: Solving Housetraining Problems

Crafting a Family Housetraining 
Plan
In some ways, a person who lives alone finds housetraining 
much easier than people who live with other people do. If you 
live solo, you’re the only human who’s in charge of your dog’s 
care. Unless you hire help such as dog walkers and pet sitters, you 
don’t have to coordinate dog care tasks, including housetraining, 
with anyone else. The only person who can be inconsistent with 
housetraining is you — and you certainly won’t be inconsistent, 
will you?
But when other people reside in your household, things get more 
complicated. Living with other humans gives you a choice: to be 
the sole caregiver (not an option I recommend) or to get the other 
human pack members involved in the housetraining enterprise. 
Here are some ways to make sure the latter option works.
Suffering from potty-duty burnout
When Allie, our Golden Retriever, came to live with us as an 8-week-old puppy, 
my husband and daughter basically abdicated housetraining responsibilities and 
left them to me. I guess they figured that because I had written a manual on house-
training (the 1st edition of this book), their help wasn’t needed, much less wanted.
They were wrong. Oh, were they wrong. Allie needed hourly trips to the outdoor 
potty when she first joined our household — which, unhappily, occurred during a 
winter of record-breaking snowfalls. Within a week or so, I was exhausted from 
accompanying Allie on all those trips, and I was pretty annoyed with both Stan and 
Julie for foisting the whole business onto me.
One evening, while they were at the movies and I was home on housetraining duty 
(again!), I just snapped. I took Allie out about a half hour before they were due 
home. Then I put Allie in her crate and went to bed. But before I turned out the light, 
I wrote out a detailed schedule for the next few days listing who would be doing 
potty duty at which time. And I made it clear in that note that the duty roster I was 
creating was not negotiable.
To their credit, Stan and Julie didn’t protest. They read the schedule and adhered 
to it, and I got some much needed rest. To this day, Stan generally takes Allie out 
last thing at night, and Julie’s happy to take on dog-walking duties when she visits 
home from college.

 Chapter 11: Sorting Out Humans’ Housetraining Challenges 161
Dividing duties: A plan to relieve 
the primary caregiver
First Lady Michelle Obama has said that she’s assuming primary 
responsibility for taking care of the First Puppy, a Portuguese 
Water Dog named Bo. She has just the right attitude: She realizes 
that 10-year-old Malia and 7-year-old Sasha are too young to have 
full responsibility for taking care of their new Portuguese Water 
Dog, and she’s committed to taking on that responsibility herself. 
But if Mrs. Obama is on the road with her husband or on her own, 
she knows she can rely on someone in the office of the White 
House Usher (the household staff) to step in and take Bo to his 
potty. Most primary doggie caregivers aren’t so lucky.
Being a dog’s primary caregiver shouldn’t mean drawing a 24/7 
housetraining detail — unless that’s what the caregiver really 
wants to do. But if you’re the primary caregiver, don’t think you 
can do it all. You’ll just end up with a boatload of resentment 
toward your nearest and dearest (read about my experience in the 
nearby sidebar). For the sake of family harmony, figure out ahead 
of time who will take Fifi out and when.
Getting the adults on the same page
Housetraining is next to impossible if one adult is trying to teach 
the pup to potty on newspaper and another wants that pup 
to do her business outside. Before you bring your four-legged 
friend home from the breeder, shelter, or rescue group, the 
adult members of the household need to agree on the following:
 
✓ Whether the pooch will potty outside or inside
 
✓ Which type of indoor potty your dog will use (if you all opt for 
the indoor option)
 
✓ Who will clean the indoor potty or pick up the poop outdoors 
(and when that will happen)
 
✓ Who will perform other dog care duties, such as feeding and 
training
 
✓ Who will clean up accidents and when
 
Here’s the best option for who-cleans-up-when: Whoever finds the 
accident also cleans up that accident. Unless the accident-finder 
is a child under the age of 6, no one in your household should be 
yelling, “Mom/Honey, the dog just had an accident!” and expect 
Mom to come running to clean up the errant puddle or pile. And 

Part III: Solving Housetraining Problems 
162
although you shouldn’t expect the under-6ers to manage cleanup 
on their own, they should still help out when possible to discover 
that living with a dog involves much more than simply petting and 
playing with that dog.
Getting the kids on board
When President Obama and his family acquired their puppy, Bo, 
the president declared that everyone in the family, including 
daughters Malia and Sasha, would be taking turns walking the dog. 
He said exactly the right thing.
 
All the members of the family who can care for the family pet need 
to do so, starting with housetraining. That’s why you need to make 
sure that every member of the family agrees to the family dog-care 
plan before that dog joins the family.
That said, I don’t think having children under the age of 6 assume 
the dog-walking share of family housetraining responsibilities is a 
good idea. A growing pup can be way too strong for an under-6er 
to handle — and even if the puppy is small, most kids in that age 
range simply aren’t ready for that sort of responsibility. Have 
kids that age help with other tasks, such as feeding, training, and 
accident cleanup — but always under adult supervision. My 
daughter helped her dad and me with cleanup duty when she was 
going into first grade and we were housetraining our Sheltie, Cory, 
and she came with me to Cory’s puppy kindergarten classes.
 
Your kids may beg and plead for the new dog to sleep in the same 
rooms that they do. Resist such begging and pleading — at least 
for now — and have the dog sleep in your room. That way, you’ll 
be more likely to hear if the dog gets restless, whines, or otherwise 
indicates that she needs a middle-of-the-night potty break. After 
your canine companion becomes a housetraining ace, perhaps you 
can reconsider the dog’s sleeping assignment.
 
Most experts say — and I totally agree — that you should never 
leave children age 6 or younger alone with a dog. If an adult can’t 
be there to supervise interactions between a child and a dog, 
confine the dog to a safe place, such as a crate.
Balancing Crate Time
After your dog becomes a housetraining ace, you can generally 
let her go in and out of the crate as she pleases. But during the 
housetraining process, you often need to close the door. You can 
misuse the crate in two ways when housetraining: using the crate 
too much and not using it enough.

 Chapter 11: Sorting Out Humans’ Housetraining Challenges 163
With your dog safely in her crate-den, you can take your eyes off 
her, allowing you to leave the house, take a shower, pay the bills, 
or otherwise keep your household running. The crate time also 
helps the housetraining process along. By keeping your house-
trainee in her crate when you can’t watch her, you tap into her 
desire to refrain from dirtying her domicile — and as she gets 
refraining practice, she develops the physical control she needs to 
become a housetraining graduate.
However, being in the crate can be cruel to a dog if you leave her 
in there for too long. If you’re away all day, you can’t leave your 
housetrainee in her crate the whole time and expect her to hold it. 
You need to find ways to give her some relief (I discuss some 
options in the next section).
So what’s the right balance of crate time? Chapters 6 and 7 provide 
some example housetraining schedules that account for time 
in the crate, potty breaks, and time to play or just hang out with 
the family.
Responding to accidents in her crate
If your dog has an accident in her crate, first blame yourself. No dog potties in her 
den if she can possibly avoid doing so. Next, try to figure out what happened:
 ✓ Did you leave her in her crate for too long? Promise yourself — and your 
dog — that you won’t do that again.
 ✓ Is she sick? A crate with loose stool can indicate that your pooch isn’t feeling 
well. Check out Chapter 10 for the scoop on dealing with loose poop.
 ✓ Is the crate too big? A crate should allow your dog to stand up, turn around, and 
lie down comfortably, but it shouldn’t be much bigger than that. If your puppy’s 
in a crate that allows her to sleep at one end and eliminate at the other, you’re 
defeating the purpose of the crate.
 ✓ Has she done it before? If so, maybe you didn’t clean up the crate completely 
from the previous potty transgression. Take the crate outside and hose it down. 
Scrub the inside with a cleaner meant especially for removing pet stains and 
odor. Replace any bedding, including the cushions and blankets.
Finally, don’t beat yourself up. A dirty crate, although unpleasant and undesirable 
for both pooch and person, does occur on occasion (Yes, I’m speaking from 
personal experience. No, I won’t share the details.) Follow the steps here, and your 
dog’s latest crate accident should be her last.

Relieving the Home-Alone Dog
If you’re training your pooch to potty indoors and her potty is 
accessible to her at all times, you don’t need to make arrange-
ments to relieve your home-alone dog. But if your dog is an 
outdoor housetrainee, you can’t expect her to hold her water or 
the other stuff while you’re away all day. Until you know that your 
four-legged friend is a housetraining ace (Chapter 8 helps you 
figure that out), you need to provide her with some daytime relief, 
literally. This section suggests some ways to do that.
 
If none of the options for relieving your home-alone dog are 
available five days a week, maybe you can combine them: work 
from home one or two days a week, go home for lunch one day 
or two days a week, ask a neighbor for help one or two days a 
week, or try some other combination.
Getting a pet-sitter or dog walker
If your dog hasn’t mastered basic bathroom manners yet, one 
way to help her do so is to hire a pet-sitter or dog walker who can 
come to your home one or more times per day and take your 
pooch out to potty. Dog owners who reside in major metropolitan 
areas or their surrounding suburbs can find plenty of qualified pet-
sitters, dog walkers, or pet-sitting companies by logging on to an 
online classified Web site such as Craigslist (www.craigslist.
org). Your local newspaper’s classifieds or telephone book may 
also offer listings. Still another pet-sitting option may be to enlist 
the assistance of a dog-loving neighbor who’s home during the day.
 
Can’t find help through the classifieds? Don’t have a dog-loving 
at-home neighbor? Visit the Web site of Pet Sitters International 
(www.petsit.com/locate) or the National Association of 
Professional Pet Sitters (www.petsitters.org), type in your zip 
code, and find an accredited pet-sitter or pet-sitting company in 
your area. Both of those sites also contain valuable information on 
how to choose a pet-sitter.
Bringing your dog to work
Many companies allow employees to bring their dogs to work with 
them; maybe yours is one. Check with the Human Resources 
department at your company and see whether your workplace 
has a pet policy that allows you to bring your puppy or dog-in-
housetraining (some companies specify that housetraining must 
be completed before your canine companion can join you in the 

 Chapter 11: Sorting Out Humans’ Housetraining Challenges 165
office). If you get the green light, bring your dog, some toys, a 
water dish, a leash, and a crate with you. You’ll find that following 
your dog’s schedule in the office is just about as easy as it is at home.
 
If you’re looking for a new job and want to find a dog-friendly work-
place, visit Simply Hired at www.simplyhired.com. Depending on 
the type of job you’re looking for, you can turn on a “Dog-Friendly 
Companies” filter and find a place to work that lets you bring your 
four-legged friend with you.
Going home for lunch
If your workplace is close to your home and you have an hour or 
so for lunch, consider going home at lunchtime and taking your 
pooch out for a potty break. Eat lunch at your desk either before 
or after the trip.
Working from home
Maybe your job allows you to telecommute, at least temporarily. 
If you spend most of your workday in front of a computer and/
or on the phone, see whether your company allows you to 
work from home, at least during your canine companion’s house-
training stage. Of course, if you’re self-employed and chained 
to a computer or phone (like I am), your only task is to add your 
dog’s housetraining schedule to your daily to-do list.
Creating a potty-proof 
home-alone area
If none of the preceding options are available at all, reconcile 
yourself to not having your puppy trained to potty exclusively 
outdoors — at least not right away. If you or someone else can’t 
spell her during the day, you need to give your puppy an indoor 
potty to use even though you’re training her to do her business 
outside. Here’s how this method works:
 
✓ For when you’re going to be away for several hours: Create 
an indoor home-alone area for your puppy — preferably 
someplace that doesn’t have a carpet and is easy to clean. 
The kitchen, laundry room, or bathroom works well here. 
Cover the entire floor area with several layers of newspaper. 
Put the puppy’s crate and dishes at one end; leave the door to 
the crate open. Use baby gates or an exercise pen to enclose 
the entire area so your pup can’t venture beyond the room.

Part III: Solving Housetraining Problems 
166
 
✓ For when you’re home: If your puppy has pooped or peed on 
the papers, clean them up without comment when you arrive 
home. She hasn’t done anything wrong by eliminating on the 
papers, but you don’t want her to think that you want her to 
use the papers over the long term. Don’t lay down new 
papers. Anytime you’re home, remove the papers and follow 
the outdoor training instructions in Chapter 6.
 
✓ For short trips out: If you need to head out on a quick errand 
or otherwise can’t watch your little darling, you don’t need to 
set up the home-alone area again — put her in her crate.
Eventually, when your puppy nears 6 months of age or so, you’ll be 
able to bypass the papers forevermore. You’ll know she’s ready to 
become a totally outdoor-trained dog when you repeatedly come 
home from work at night and find nothing on the papers.
Sticking to the Schedule
Most of the time, you’re probably very good about getting home 
at midday to give your puppy-in-housetraining a much-needed 
potty break, but perhaps you just plain forgot today. Or maybe 
you decided to meet friends after work at the local watering hole 
without stopping to think that your pooch needed to, well, let go 
of some water.
In such instances, you shouldn’t be surprised to find a little puddle 
or pile waiting for you when you get home, nor should you be 
angry at the individual who deposited that puddle or pile. You, not 
your puppy or dog, are the one who screwed up, because you 
didn’t stick to the potty schedule you established.
That schedule conditions your canine companion to eat, drink, 
poop, and pee at certain times, and it helps you anticipate when 
he needs to eliminate, thus preventing accidents. The schedule 
also helps him learn to hold his pee and poop until you get home 
to give him the potty break he’s come to expect. But if you don’t 
show, he’ll still need to go. He’ll pass his personal can’t-hold-it-
anymore threshold and have no choice but to perform a doggie 
download.
And even when your dog is fully housetrained, you still need to 
take his needs into consideration when you make plans that don’t 
include him. The next time you want to take advantage of a local 
establishment’s Happy Hour on the way home from work, ask 
yourself whether you could refrain from doing your bathroom 
business for as long as you’re asking your dog to refrain from 
doing so. If the answer is no, then do yourself and your dog a favor: 
Go home and give him a chance to do his business.

 Chapter 11: Sorting Out Humans’ Housetraining Challenges 167
Bottom line here: Whenever possible, stick with the schedule 
that you’ve created for your housetraining student. You and the 
student will both be glad you did.
Managing Snacks
I’m a firm believer in positive reinforcement training. The old ways 
of teaching dogs — choke collars, harsh leash corrections, or the 
alpha rolls that required humans to roll dogs onto their backs in 
order to impose some sort of discipline — are dangerous to 
humans, not to mention incredibly stressful to the dog. I’d much 
rather catch a dog doing something right and reward her when she 
does. Most dogs think the best reward is a tasty treat.
As I note in Chapters 6 and 7, rewarding your beginning house-
trainee with a treat whenever she potties in the proper place is a 
great way to persuade her to continue pottying in that place. But 
that treat needs to be very small for two reasons: first, so she 
doesn’t put on too much weight and second, so that the treats 
don’t wreak havoc with her bathroom schedule. In other words, 
too many treats are likely to put on too many pounds and prompt 
too many trips to the potty — or even accidents if she can’t get to 
the potty in time. What size of treat is small enough? As tiny as 
you can make it.
 
If, despite your efforts, your pooch is porking out by ingesting too 
many treats, reduce the sizes of the portions you serve her at 
mealtimes. Alternatively, check out the info on low-calorie treats in 
Chapter 4.
Messing Up the Cleanup
True story: Years before I began writing about dogs and their care, 
I had the pleasure of interviewing one of our nation’s best-known 
etiquette experts and observers of social goings-on. I arrived 
at her home and rang the doorbell, and the expert herself opened 
the door, graciously inviting me inside. As I stepped into her 
well-appointed foyer, one of her teeny-tiny dogs ran up to me and 
piddled on the floor in front of me. I offered to help clean up the 
resulting puddle, and she accepted the offer. While I broke open 
some paper towels, she went to get something to clean the floor 
with. Unfortunately, that something was club soda. And during our 
interview, the expert acknowledged with some embarrassment 
that her dog often peed on that spot. She couldn’t understand why.

Part III: Solving Housetraining Problems 
168
But at least the expert knew that the puddle needed to be cleaned 
up right away. So often, dog owners forget to do that. Maybe 
you really meant to clean up the little puddle that your canine 
companion left on your carpet. But before you could get the pet 
stain cleaner, a telemarketer called, or your teenage daughter 
came home from school bemoaning how awful her school day 
was, or worst of all, your household toilet overflowed (that would 
be ironic, wouldn’t it?). Now, a few hours later, you see your 
four-legged friend performing an encore on the very same spot 
where he left the earlier puddle.
Why did the expert’s dog pee on the same spot time after time? 
And why would any dog want to pee in the same place she’d peed 
on earlier?
In the first instance, the expert wasn’t using the right cleaner. Club 
soda may appear to remove a pet stain, but it doesn’t remove the 
odor. The lingering scent was like a magnet to her dog, practically 
screaming, “Come pee again! Right here!” In the second instance, 
your failure to clean up at all had the same effect as the expert’s 
failure to use the right cleaner.
The lessons here are simple: Clean up your dog’s bathroom boo-
boos as soon as possible after those boo-boos have occurred, and 
when you do, use a commercial cleaner designed specifically to 
remove pet stains and odor. Otherwise, you’re sabotaging your 
efforts to housetrain your dog and you’re setting her up to fail.
Anticipating Lapses Due to 
Household Changes
Dogs are social animals, and they don’t always respond well to 
changes in their pack. A change in your household — such as a 
romantic breakup, the death of a family member (human, canine, 
or feline), or the departure of a child for college — can wreak 
havoc with your dog’s bathroom manners.
 
If you anticipate a change in your household or are undergoing 
one, act now to keep your pooch from pottying in the wrong place. 
Here are some ideas:
 
✓ Limit access. If your dog is doing his business in the same 
indoor place every day, limit his access to that place. Close 
the door, block the spot with some chairs — do what you 
must to keep him from reaching that spot.

 Chapter 11: Sorting Out Humans’ Housetraining Challenges 169
 
✓ Keep up routines. As much as possible, maintain your dog’s 
regular routine. Feed, walk, and play with him at the same 
times every day.
 
✓ Up the exercise. Trainers often say that a tired dog is a good 
dog, and they’re right. If your four-legged friend gets sufficient 
aerobic exercise, he’s more likely to sleep than leave his mark 
in the wrong spot.
 
✓ Call the vet. If your dog continues to potty in forbidden areas 
despite your taking the preceding steps, he may be sick. Have 
your vet check him out for a urinary tract infection or other 
health problem.
Helping the Newly Adopted 
Housetrainee
If you’ve adopted an adolescent or adult dog from an animal 
shelter or rescue group, props to you! You’ve saved at least two 
lives: that of the homeless dog whom you’ve welcomed into your 
household and that of another homeless dog who will take her 
place at the shelter or rescue group — hopefully just before she 
finds her forever home, too.
Shelters and rescue organizations point out that many of the dogs 
they put up for adoption are already housetrained — and in many 
cases, that’s true. But in my experience, assuming that the dog you 
The bathroom blues
Years ago, in my single days, my dog Molly and I lived for a year with another 
person and his dog. When that arrangement ended, my roommate and the room-
mate’s dog moved out, and Molly promptly developed what appeared to be house-
training amnesia.
Every day when I came back from work, I found a little puddle next to a spot where 
the other dog had liked to spend much of his time. I cleaned up the spot as best I 
could — but because I knew much less about housetraining than I do now, I thought 
club soda would do the trick. It didn’t, and Molly kept going back to the same spot 
and leaving a puddle.
Finally, a light bulb went off in my head. I closed the door to the room that Molly was 
using for an indoor potty. That ended Molly’s bathroom boo-boos — but not soon 
enough for me to avoid losing the security deposit to the place where I was living 
when Molly and I moved out.

Part III: Solving Housetraining Problems 
170
adopt is one of them is not a good idea. Even a dog who’s been a 
housetraining ace may regress as she negotiates the changes from 
being abandoned or surrendered to the shelter or rescue group, 
adjusts to the shelter or foster home, and then adjusts yet again 
when you adopt her.
 
I strongly suggest that you assume that, at the very least, your 
newly adopted dog is going to need some housetraining help, if not 
start from square one on the path to understanding proper potty 
protocol. Here’s how to give your shelter or rescue dog that help:
 
✓ Get her a den. Ideally, this den is a crate, but if your new 
family member doesn’t take to a crate — or if you’re going to 
have to be away all day — create a living area such as what I 
describe in Chapter 3.
 
✓ Decide where her bathroom will be. If your adoptee is very 
small, consider training her to potty in a designated indoor 
bathroom area. Otherwise, plan on taking her outside to do 
her business. Either way, check out Chapter 3 for indoor and 
outdoor potty placement pointers.
 
✓ Create a schedule. The adolescent or adult dog doesn’t need 
to potty nearly as often as a young puppy does, but she still 
needs a consistent schedule so that she can figure out how to 
regulate her potty urges. Until you’re able to see just how well 
housetrained she is, plan on taking her out first thing in the 
morning, last thing at night, immediately after being confined 
to her crate or living area, after naps, after playtime or a 
chewing session, and after each meal. Chapter 6 offers a 
sample housetraining schedule for an adult dog.
 
✓ Supervise, supervise. Until you know how well your adoptee 
can regulate her bathroom behavior, she needs your close 
supervision at all times, except when she’s in her crate 
or living area. Keep a close eye on her when she’s not being 
confined. That way, you figure out what she’s likely to do 
before she deposits a puddle or pile, which can help you 
anticipate when she’s about to do the doo.
 
 A good way to keep an eye on your dog as you go from room 
to room is to attach a leash and take her with you wherever 
you go in the house.
 
✓ Take care with her diet. Find out what your dog ate during 
her stay at the foster home or shelter and get a week’s supply 
of the same food. You can keep feeding her the same food or 
gradually switch her over to a regimen that you prefer. If you 
opt to make a switch, do it gradually over several days. An 
abrupt switch can upset your adoptee’s stomach, which may 
result in diarrhea or other disruptions in housetraining.

 Chapter 11: Sorting Out Humans’ Housetraining Challenges 171
 
✓ Expect accidents. With the excitement and stress of adjusting 
to a new home, your new friend is bound to make a couple of 
bathroom mistakes. (This is especially likely if your dog has 
just been spayed or neutered.) If you’re lucky, you can catch 
her in the act, distract her, and hurry her to her potty spot. If 
you find an accident after the fact, just clean up calmly and 
completely and resolve to keep a closer eye on her next time.
 
✓ Reward bathroom successes. Take your adoptee to the same 
potty spot for each and every pit stop until she gets the hang 
of housetraining — and every time she potties at the right 
spot, give her a very small treat and lots of loving praise.
 
✓ Be patient. Some dogs take longer to figure out proper potty 
protocol than others. If your dog is over 6 months of age, a 
good rule of thumb is to consider your dog fully housetrained 
if she hasn’t had an accident for a month or so.
 
✓ Watch for problems. If your adoptee is doing well with house-
training but suddenly regresses for more than a day or so — 
or if her output is clearly not normal for the same amount of 
time — she may be sick. The same may be true if her bath-
room behavior suddenly changes. Either way, put in a call to 
your veterinarian and check out Chapter 10, which outlines a 
number of maladies that masquerade as housetraining lapses.
Hitting the Road with Your 
Housetraining Graduate
Some of the best times I’ve had with my dogs have been when I’ve 
traveled with them. I have especially fond memories of traveling 
with Allie from my home in Virginia to a very special place in 
Vermont called Camp Gone to the Dogs, where she and I bunked 
together at night and engaged in all kinds of activities during the 
day: hiking, swimming, lure coursing (a sport in which a dog chases 
a scented lure that’s attached to a string), freestyle (a relay race 
that requires the dog to retrieve a ball and jump over hoops), 
and even, at one unforgettable juncture, sheep herding (Allie was 
very interested in the sheep but hadn’t a clue as to what to do 
with them).
However, all the excitement of going to camp — plus the extra 
treats and change of food involved with traveling to a training 
camp — wreaked havoc on Allie’s digestion. About midway 
through each visit to camp, she and many of the other canine 
guests developed loose stools and some memorable flatulence. 
Although Allie never made a bathroom boo-boo during our stays at 

Part III: Solving Housetraining Problems 
172
camp, we did make a lot of extra trips outdoors so she could potty, 
and scooping up all her poop was definitely more of a challenge 
than normally is the case.
Allie and I don’t do camp anymore, but we continue to travel 
together — mainly to visit my mother, who lives about 200 miles 
away from us. Here’s what I do to keep Allie’s bathroom behavior 
on an even keel when we hit the road:
 
✓ Limit dietary changes. When Allie and I went to camp, I had 
to change her diet from raw food to canned because I couldn’t 
keep the raw food fresh at camp. Going to visit my mom, 
though, is a different story; I bring the same raw food that 
Allie eats at home. I pack it frozen and it defrosts on the trip, 
ready to serve when we arrive.
 
✓ Step up bathroom breaks. The excitement of travel seems 
to make Allie want to go more often, and I accommodate 
that desire as best I can. She gets a potty break just before 
we leave, about two hours into the trip, and when we arrive 
at my mom’s.
 
 If you’re staying at a pet-friendly hotel with your dog, give her 
extra pit stops until you see whether the new, temporary digs 
are affecting her behavior, bathroom or otherwise.
 
✓ Pack extra poop bags. Chances are the places where you 
take your dog to potty won’t have poop bags at the ready, so 
bring your own.
 
✓ Bring the comforts of home. In an unfamiliar place, your 
dog may appreciate the familiarity of her crate, particularly 
when you’re not with her. The crate also helps her control 
her bathroom urges. If your dog is trained to potty indoors, 
bring the indoor potty with you as well.
 
✓ Pack some pumpkin. No one knows exactly why, but canned 
pumpkin (just plain — not sugar-heavy pumpkin pie filling) 
does wonders to regulate your dog’s pooping. Amazingly, the 
stuff balances out both diarrhea and constipation. For Allie, 
who weighs 70 pounds, I add about 4 ounces to each meal.
 
✓ Bring along a pet stain cleaner. My late Sheltie, Cory — 
who otherwise was practically a housetraining genius — 
developed a bad habit of marking new territory, which proved 
embarrassing whenever we traveled to someone’s house. I 
carried a small bottle of pet stain cleaner with me when we 
ventured elsewhere, which helped restore my hosts’ good 
opinion of him and of me.

Ten Housetraining Mistakes 
You Don’t Have to Make
In This Chapter

H
ousetraining a puppy or dog can be a real challenge. 
A well-meaning but unprepared person can find plenty of 
opportunities to mess up the job. Some of these mistakes result 
from owner misunderstanding, and others occur due to owner 
impatience. However, any of these mistakes can make your canine 
companion’s housetraining learning curve a lot steeper than it 
needs to be.
In fact, just about all housetraining mistakes are avoidable — if 
you know ahead of time what the possible pitfalls are. This chapter 
describes ten common housetraining boo-boos, why they occur, 
and how you can avoid making them.
Thinking the Crate Is Cruel
If your love for dogs began when you started watching TV shows 
such as Lassie when you were a kid, the idea of putting your dog in 
a crate probably takes a little getting used to. The image of Timmy 
and his glorious Collie wandering over rolling hills of farmland 
just doesn’t square with the idea of confining your Fido in a plastic 
or wire enclosure until he masters his potty manners. In fact, you 
may feel that in doing so, you’re putting Fido in a cage. “Dogs don’t 
belong in cages,” you may protest. “It’s cruel.” But if Fido could 
speak for himself, he’d probably disagree with you.

Part IV: The Part of Tens 
176
 
Many dogs actually love their crates. To most canine companions, 
the crate is the safe, secure den they instinctively long for. The 
crate-den offers protection from hazards such as out-of-control 
children and big, noisy vacuum cleaners. It also makes a terrific 
home away from home for the traveling canine. For most dogs, 
then, the crate is not an object of cruelty but an object to be 
appreciated.
And for people who love those dogs, the crate can be a dandy 
housetraining tool. Using a crate for housetraining just prompts 
a dog to do what comes naturally. When you confine your canine-
in-housetraining to a crate during those times that you can’t watch 
her, you tap into her inborn desire to refrain from eliminating in 
the den. She’ll hold her pee or poop until she can leave, helping 
her develop bowel and bladder control. Meanwhile, she’s happy 
and secure while lounging in her beloved den. It’s a classic win-win 
situation — about as far from cruelty as one can get.
Some dogs do take a while to appreciate their crates. A very 
gradual introduction can help such a pooch discover the joys of 
chilling out in this makeshift den. See Chapter 5 for tips on turning 
your crate-phobic pooch into a crate-loving canine.
 
Being in the crate can be cruel to a dog in one instance: When he’s 
left in there for too long. Don’t leave your dog in his crate all day 
while you’re at work. If you’re concerned about destructiveness, 
enclose him in a dog-proofed room, hire someone to come walk 
him during the day, or take him to doggie day care. (See Chapter 
11 for details on these solutions and some other options.)
Getting a Crate That’s Too Big
Getting an oversized crate is a common mistake among people 
who’ve acquired young puppies and are hoping to economize on 
crate purchases. Such individuals buy a crate that’s sized for an 
adult dog, not a canine youngster. The idea is that the puppy will 
have plenty of room to grow into his crate and the owner will have 
to shell out for a crate only once. Unfortunately, not only does the 
puppy have plenty of room to grow, but he also has enough room 
to sleep at one end of the crate and eliminate at the other. That 
defeats the purpose of the crate, which is to help the puppy 
develop bowel and bladder control.
A crate that’s too big is a little bit like a pair of shoes that are too 
big. The wearer finds the shoes very comfortable, as long as he’s 
not moving. But after he does start walking, it’s clear the shoes fail 
to fulfill their intended purpose: to provide protection and support 

 Chapter 12: Ten Housetraining Mistakes You Don’t Have to Make 177
to the feet. Similarly, a too-big crate is certainly comfortable for a 
puppy, but it doesn’t represent the cozy den he needs to learn to 
control his pooping and peeing. The solution to this problem is to 
buy the correct size of crate.
 
A crate is sized correctly when it’s just big enough for a dog to 
stand up, turn around, and lie down.
 
So does a new puppy owner have to run up his credit card balance 
by purchasing a new crate every time his puppy shows significant 
growth? Not at all! You can still get away with buying just one crate 
that fits little Fido’s expected adult size. Just buy a wire crate that 
comes with a divider. As your puppy grows, you can move the 
divider farther and farther toward the back of the crate. That way, 
the crate fulfills its purpose, but you have to buy one only once.
Failing to Stick to the Schedule
 
For the puppy or dog who’s still being housetrained, sticking to 
the schedule is crucial to success. That’s because as soon as 
you establish a schedule, your puppy expects to eat, drink, and 
eliminate at certain times. That expectation helps you anticipate 
when she needs to go and thus reduces the number of accidents 
she has. It also helps her develop enough bowel and bladder 
control to keep her from eliminating until it’s time for the potty 
break she’s come to expect. If she doesn’t get that break, though, 
she may not be able to hold her water. She may pass her personal 
point of endurance and have no choice but to unload.
That may also be true of the housetraining graduate. No dog can 
keep her floodgates shut forever. If you expect your dog to refrain 
from eliminating during the day, you can’t reasonably expect her 
to continue to refrain during the evening. The next time you’re 
tempted to stop off someplace else before going home to take your 
dog out, ask yourself this: Could you hold it as long as she’s been 
holding it today? If the answer is no, hightail it home and give your 
friend her break.
Failing to Clean Up Completely
Canine urine is a magnet to dogs — including the dog from whom 
the urine came. Even one stray drop can lure a dog to a given area 
and prompt him to pee there again.

Part IV: The Part of Tens 
178
Using club soda and/or ammonia may get rid of urine stains, but it 
certainly doesn’t get rid of the odor. That come-hither fragrance 
works its dubious magic on dogs, drawing them back to the scenes 
of their potty crimes. If you use ammonia, not only do you fail to 
get rid of the odor — you actually intensify it! That’s because 
ammonia smells a lot like urine to most dogs.
 
If your pooch makes a potty mistake, clean it up completely — 
and use a commercial cleaner that’s expressly designed for 
the job. Otherwise, you may as well tell your dog that flunking 
Housetraining 101 is okay.
Not Cleaning the Indoor Potty
No question — life sometimes feels like a never-ending to-do list. 
Understandably, you’d like nothing better than to pare that list 
down a little bit. But failing to change your indoor trainee’s soiled 
indoor potty — whether that potty is newspapers, a litter box, a 
grate-covered tray, or another device — should not be one of the 
tasks you skip.
Do you like using a dirty bathroom? Of course not. Chances are, 
even if the rest of your house looks like a hurricane swept through 
it, your bathroom is reasonably clean. And even though you 
probably don’t enjoy cleaning your toilet, you do it anyway — 
because the very thought of using a dirty john grosses you out.
Your dog doesn’t like to use a dirty bathroom, either. The idea of 
pooping or peeing on soaked papers, in a dirty litter box, or on a 
waste-filled bathroom tray grosses him out. But because he can’t 
change his papers or litter or clean the tray himself, he’s left with 
only one alternative to using the canine equivalent of a dirty toilet: 
doing his business someplace else. That solves the dirty-toilet 
problem for him, but it represents a housetraining setback for both 
of you.
 
Change your indoor trainee’s papers or litter as soon as possible 
after your pooch has used them. That way, he’ll stay on track with 
housetraining. And for advice on washing the indoor potty, flip to

Thinking Your Dog Looks Guilty
You’re on your way home after a long day grappling with office 
politics and are looking forward to spending time with your 

 Chapter 12: Ten Housetraining Mistakes You Don’t Have to Make 179
cherished canine companion. But when you walk in the door, you 
see a telltale stain on your gorgeous Oriental rug. When you cast a 
baleful glance over to your now not-so-cherished companion, he 
seems to wilt in front of you: He folds his ears back, places his tail 
between his legs, and looks away from you.
“Aha!” you think. “He knows he’s been bad. He knows that he 
shouldn’t have peed on my rug. He feels so guilty he can’t even 
look at me.”
Time out. Your dog’s failure to meet your gaze does not result from 
guilt. His low-hanging ears and tail do not reflect remorse. His body 
language does not reflect any feelings he has from peeing on your 
rug. Before you walked in the door, he was probably taking a nap 
and wasn’t thinking at all about how the rug got that stinky yellow 
stain. Only when you sent that menacing glance his way did he 
realize that he might be in trouble.
 
Dogs don’t know the meaning of guilt. Your dog has no idea that 
you’re angry because he used your Oriental rug as a potty. He 
doesn’t even remember having done so. He understands only that 
you’re unhappy, and he’s responding in the only way that he 
knows how: with submissive behavior.
Scolding Her after the Fact
Scolding your dog for a housetraining error does nothing to teach 
her what you want her to do. If you yell at her, restrict her, or try 
to correct her for producing that puddle, she won’t have the faint-
est idea why you’re acting that way. She’ll learn nothing from your 
rant except to be afraid of you.
So when you confront a misplaced puddle or pile, take a deep 
breath and then just zip it while you clean up. Understand that the 
mistake was yours, not your dog’s — and figure out how to prevent 
that mistake from recurring.
However, if you catch your dog in the act of making a mistake, or 
just about to make one, your approach should be different. Distract 
her by clapping your hands, saying “Oops!” in a loud voice, or 
using a similar technique. She’ll probably stop what she’s doing (or 
what she’s about to do). When she does, get her to her potty spot 
pronto. Then, when she unloads, praise her lavishly and give her a 
small treat if you have one handy.

Rubbing His Nose in 
You-Know-What
Back in the days of yore, people thought they could correct a dog 
for housetraining lapses no matter how long ago those lapses 
occurred. Many of those same people also thought that rubbing 
the offending pooch’s nose in his poop or pee would further help 
him understand that doing his biz in the house was not a good 
thing to do.
But that really isn’t the case. Giving the dog a snoutful of dog doo 
falls in the same category as thinking a dog looks guilty. Either 
way, dogs don’t remember their housetraining mistakes. They 
don’t feel bad for doing what comes naturally. And they don’t 
connect having to eyeball their waste with having deposited that 
waste in the wrong place a few minutes or hours earlier.
 
If you come upon a puddle or pile inside your house, it’s too late 
to do anything but clean it up. Do that, resolve to prevent future 
accidents, and consign the nose-rubbing routine to where it 
belongs: the past.
Changing the Menu Abruptly
You’ve been feeding Rover pretty much the same things day in, 
day out for the past few weeks, and his housetraining’s been 
coming along beautifully. In fact, you can’t quite remember the last 
time you had to clean up a canine potty mistake.
Then, lo and behold, it’s time to celebrate Thanksgiving or another 
holiday that calls for a grand and glorious feast for the human 
members of the family. But as you’re preparing that feast, the 
nonhuman member of the family lays an incredibly effective guilt 
trip on you. As you baste that turkey or prepare that sausage 
stuffing, Rover’s there with you, staring at you and the food with 
big, hungry eyes. And you ask yourself how you can possibly stuff 
yourself with such wonderful food but force Rover to stick with his 
usual fare. You think, “What the heck?” and decide to give Rover a 
Thanksgiving dinner, too. And he loves it. He practically inhales it.
Unfortunately, several hours later, Rover has a loose, runny bowel 
movement all over your floor. Your tender-hearted gesture at 
dinnertime has given Rover an exceptionally tender tummy now — 
with all-too-predictable results.

 Chapter 12: Ten Housetraining Mistakes You Don’t Have to Make 181
 
Any time you change a dog’s menu suddenly, you risk upsetting his 
digestive system. Digestive upsets in dogs manifest themselves the 
same way as they do for people: with diarrhea.
Does this mean that Rover can’t enjoy Thanksgiving dinner along 
with the rest of the family? No. It does mean, though, that giving 
Rover a completely different meal all at once is likely to wreak 
havoc with his bathroom behavior. Let him have a little taste of 
the turkey (white meat, no skin). That way, he’ll get to enjoy some 
holiday fare without having to pay for it afterward.
The same principle applies when you’re switching Rover’s every-
day cuisine. If you’re changing dog foods or switching from com-
mercial to raw or home-prepared meals, don’t make the change 
all at once. Do so over a period of several days so that Rover’s 
digestive system can become accustomed to the new grub. By 
taking your time with any culinary changes, you’ll greatly reduce 
the risk of messy digestive upsets.
Declaring Victory Prematurely
Oh, you are so proud of your little Fifi, aren’t you? She’s been with 
you for only a month, she’s just 3 months old, and she hasn’t had 
an accident for a whole week. Surely she’s a housetraining prodigy. 
How many other dogs her age have aced their bathroom lessons 
so quickly and so thoroughly? Probably not many — including Fifi.
 
When it comes to housetraining, declaring victory prematurely 
is a big mistake. Being sure that those potty lessons are imprinted 
onto the canine brain takes longer than a week, particularly with 
a puppy. For one thing, a 3-month-old puppy doesn’t have enough 
physical bowel and bladder control to be considered reliable 
for long periods of time. Even adult housetrainees who have 
developed that control may have trouble remembering where and 
when they’re supposed to potty.
With canine children as well as with human children, don’t give 
too much freedom too soon. The parents of a 5-year-old child 
who’s figured out how to ride a bike aren’t likely to let that child 
ride alone to the other side of town. Similarly, your canine child’s 
housetraining prowess does not merit unsupervised access to 
the whole house. Give her longer stretches of unsupervised time 
outside her crate, or try taking her out for potty breaks a little less 
often. With both kids and puppies, gradually increased privileges 
get better results than total immediate freedom.

Ten Reasons Housetrained 
Dogs Live in Happier 
Households

▶ Understanding why housetrained dogs are happier dogs
▶ Seeing why owners enjoy housetrained dogs more
S
ometimes — generally when you’re cleaning up the umpteenth 
accident your puppy’s made on your favorite area rug — you 
may wonder whether she’s ever going to master the art of proper 
potty deportment and whether you should continue trying to teach 
her that art. That’s when you need this chapter. Flip through these 
next few pages for the incentive you need to persevere.
The Houses Smell Nicer
Porta-Potties are a necessary invention, but don’t you just hate 
using them? I do — because they stink. The initial assault on your 
sense of smell when you open the door is, well, intense. Keeping 
that example in mind, think of how stinky your entire home will be 
if your canine companion doesn’t figure out that your home is not 
his personal potty. If that unpleasant thought doesn’t renew your 
determination to housetrain your hound, think of how much 
money you’ll save on air fresheners after that hound becomes a 
housetraining ace.
The Owners Save Money
Being able to cut back on, if not eliminate, purchases of canine 
cleanup products isn’t the only way owners of housetrained dogs 
save money. They also use far fewer paper towels, and they can 

Part IV: The Part of Tens 
184
let a lot more time elapse between either professional carpet 
cleanings or the cleanings they do themselves. The result: extra 
bucks they can blow on something fun, put into savings, or use to 
pay off their credit card bills. What’s not to like?
The Owners Are Less Cranky
I admit it: Writing about housetraining is fun. What other way 
could a middle-aged author be paid to get back in touch with her 
inner 8-year-old and contemplate bathroom matters? That said, 
not even I find actually dealing with the complications and messes 
of housetraining very much fun. Even now that I’m a so-called 
expert on the subject, actually housetraining a dog isn’t on my list 
of favorite things to do. If my Golden Retriever, Allie, could talk, 
she’d tell you how cranky I was until she figured out where and 
when she was supposed to do her business.
And wouldn’t you be happier if you didn’t have to deal with 
soaking up puddles and picking up piles of doggie download? Of 
course you would. So invest in your future happiness, and keep 
plugging away at your dog’s bathroom lessons. If you do, he’ll 
eventually see the light. I promise.
The Dogs Aren’t Scared When 
Their Owners Come Home
Coming home to a stinky puddle of pee or pile of poop isn’t fun. 
Such olfactory greetings are bound to displease the person walking 
through the door. And because you’re all too human, you may all 
too often let your dog know that you’re upset — even though 
you’ve resolved only to praise your dog when he does something 
right, not berate him when he’s done something wrong.
Dogs are very observant. After just a few of your cranky home-
comings, they figure out that the sound of the key in the lock will 
be followed shortly thereafter by their people speaking loudly, 
looming over them, and being more than a little intimidating. 
So when that key turns, the observant dog tries to forestall his 
person’s crankiness. He launches into Doggie Appeasement 
Mode: tail between the legs, ears back, cowering on the floor, 
rolling onto his back. He may even perform the ultimate canine 
appeasement gesture: peeing on the floor — not exactly what 
you wanted, is it?

 Chapter 13: Ten Reasons Housetrained Dogs. . . 185
There’s just one catch: These observant dogs have no idea why 
their owners are cranky. They don’t make the connection between 
their bathroom transgressions and their owners’ reactions. 
They’re just thinking, “Oh Mommy/Daddy, please don’t be angry. 
I’ll do anything, anything.”
So while your housetrainee is still figuring out when and where to 
do the doo, try not to scare him with an outburst of annoyance or 
anger when you come in the door and find an unwelcome little 
something. Better still, get your dog housetrained so that you’ll no 
longer be cranky when you come home and your dog will no longer 
be scared when your key turns in the lock.
The Owners Don’t Worry about 
Stepping in You-Know-What
Ever hear of Wet Sock Syndrome? That’s when you get up in the 
middle of the night to go to the bathroom, only to find that the 
canine occupant of the room has already gone to the bathroom. 
How do you know? Because you’ve stepped into a little puddle 
(or worse) and your socks are a trifle damp. Not pleasant.
But people who live with housetrained dogs don’t need to worry 
about Wet Sock Syndrome. By taking their pooches to their potties 
before bedtime, owners ensure that when they head to their own 
potties, their socks will stay dry.
The Dogs Have One Less Way to 
Embarrass Their Owners
Dogs can display their bad bathroom habits at the most inconve-
nient times. When my Golden girl, Allie, was a puppy, my husband 
and I invited several couples over to our home for a dinner party. 
Of course, we also wanted to show off Allie, who had just joined 
our household and who, even at the tender age of 11 weeks, 
showed clear signs of becoming the great beauty she is today. 
Allie apparently wanted to show off, too — but not in ways that 
my husband or I had planned.
First, I emerged from the kitchen into the dining room just in time 
to see Allie sitting next to the table with the tablecloth in her 
mouth. One yank would be all that was needed for the china, silver, 

Part IV: The Part of Tens 
186
napkins, and crystal to go flying. I quickly grabbed a treat and 
offered it to Allie, who promptly relinquished the tablecloth to 
grab the goodie.
I was a little embarrassed that I hadn’t anticipated Allie’s table 
move, but our guests seemed to find it funny. However, the guests 
were probably a little less amused a few minutes later when Allie 
toddled over to a corner of the living room and, without further 
ado, proceeded to squat and anoint the carpet. Certainly, I was not 
amused. I was mortified.
Those events occurred 6-and-a-half years ago. Today, Allie is a 
grown-up girl, but she still has a puppy’s sense of mischief. When 
we have company, I still have to watch that she doesn’t perform a 
mortifying maneuver such as counter surfing, tablecloth grabbing, 
or hors d’oeuvre sampling. However, Allie’s long been a house-
training ace. That means I can count on her to do the doo only at 
the proper time and place — which gives me one less reason to be 
embarrassed when company comes over.
The Owners Know Right Away 
When Their Dogs Are Sick
Housetraining a dog requires a certain amount of observation 
on the part of the housetrainer. Decoding the dog’s pre-potty 
behavior, settling into a consistent pattern of trips to the potty, 
and observing what the dog’s poop and pee normally look like 
are all important components of housetraining success.
But even after your dog becomes a housetraining ace, those 
powers of observation are important. That’s because when a dog 
changes his bathroom habits, he’s often exhibiting initial signs 
of illness. By noticing such changes, you can detect the signs 
of a health problem early on — which usually results in a faster 
diagnosis and easier, more effective treatment.
The Dogs Have a Great Foundation 
for Further Training
In all likelihood, housetraining will be among the first — if not the 
first — set of lessons you attempt to teach your dog. The way you 
try to show her proper canine potty etiquette lays the foundation 
for the ways you try to teach her other lessons, such as coming 

 Chapter 13: Ten Reasons Housetrained Dogs. . . 187
when called, sitting when told to, and walking nicely on the leash. 
What you do now, in this most basic set of lessons, will probably 
set the tone for your relationship with your dog now and for years 
to come. For that reason alone, it’s worth taking the time to do the 
job well — and persevering until you can truly declare victory.
Dogs and Owners Communicate 
Better with Each Other
Housetraining is really a cooperative effort. The dog needs to 
cooperate with the owner by refraining from pooping or peeing 
anywhere but in the potty area that the owner has designated. 
The owner needs to cooperate with the dog by making sure she 
takes the dog to the potty area whenever the dog needs to do his 
business.
Such cooperation requires communication between person and 
pooch. The dog discovers that when the owner asks a leading 
question — such as “Do you want to go out?” or “Do you need to 
go potty?” — a bathroom break will follow shortly thereafter. In all 
likelihood, he’ll also find a way to tell the owner that he needs to 
go even before the owner asks that crucial question. For example, 
Allie goes to the back door of our home and gently taps the glass 
or scratches the door. My previous canine companion, Cory, 
bopped his leash with his nose. The owner learns to watch for 
these signals — and to grant the dog’s request whenever that 
request occurs. (For info on signals that your dog needs to go out, 
see Chapter 8.)
Such communication and cooperation help build the bond between 
owner and dog. They lay the foundation for a long and happy life 
together — a life built on mutual respect, trust, and love.
The Owners Are More Likely 
to Keep Their Dogs
A visit to any animal shelter provides heart-rending evidence of 
what happens when the bond between dog and person is broken. 
Behind almost every dog in a shelter is a sad story of loss or 
abandonment. All too often, a relationship that started out with 
joy or hope ends up with the owner being disappointed and the 
dog facing euthanasia at the shelter or dog pound.

Part IV: The Part of Tens 
188
One common cause of a rupture in the bond between a dog and 
his person is the dog’s bathroom behavior. In a study sponsored 
by the National Council on Pet Population Study & Policy (www.
petpopulation.org), house soiling was the most common 
reason that owners surrendered their dogs to shelters when those 
owners cited a variety of reasons for relinquishing their dogs.
This doesn’t have to happen. A little time, a little patience, and 
a little perseverance can get just about any dog to become a 
housetraining ace. Make that investment in your dog’s future, and 
you up the odds that the two of you will have a long and happy 
life together.

pooch potty protocol and doggie bathroom boo-boos, here’s a 
boatload of additional information designed to quench your thirst 
for such knowledge. As you sample these materials, you’ll find a lot 
not only about housetraining but also about many other important 
aspects of canine health and behavior.
Go Online
Not surprisingly, the Internet has countless sites devoted to the 
trials, tribulations, and triumphs that the process of housetraining 
entails, not to mention other aspects of understanding canine 
behavior. Here are some of the best:
 
✓ Pet Connection: This is the fabulous Web site that deals 
with anything and everything having to do with companion 
animals. It’s maintained by Good Morning America’s favorite 
veterinarian, Dr. Marty Becker, and pet writer extraordinaire 
Gina Spadafori, author of (among other works) Wiley’s classic 
Dogs For Dummies. The Web site includes not only a blog 
that details important issues regarding animal care but also 
the archives from the Pet Connection column published by 
the Universal Press Syndicate. The archives are searchable, 
and they include at least six articles that cover both house-
training basics and fine points. Visit the site at www.pet
connection.com.

✓ Association of Pet Dog Trainers (APDT): This organization 
conducts continuing education programs for dog trainers, 
with a strong emphasis on reward-based (read: positive 
reinforcement) training. Although the site is geared mainly 
toward professional instructors, there’s some good stuff here 
for the average dog owner, including a trainer database that 
allows the owner to search for a trainer in his or her local 
area. The site also includes many articles from the APDT 
newsletter, Chronicle of the Dog, including several that deal 
with housetraining issues. Check it out at www.apdt.com.
 
✓ Merck Veterinary Manual: The Merck Veterinary Manual 
is a marvelous online resource for those who own all kinds 
of animals, including dogs. The online version includes a 
detailed table of contents that catalogs symptoms and 
ailments by bodily system, as well as a database into which 
you can type a search term and, more than likely, get more 
information about that search term than you could imagine. 
Of particular note is a succinct yet detailed description of 
canine elimination problems and how to solve them. Go to 
www.merckvetmanual.com.
 
✓ The Humane Society of the United States (HSUS): This 
humongous site not only deals with a vast array of animal 
welfare and advocacy issues but also includes information 
on a variety of pet care topics — including housetraining. 
Because bathroom issues are a significant reason people 
surrender their dogs to animal shelters, the concern of the 
HSUS about this subject is more than understandable. To 
find out more, go to www.hsus.org.
 
✓ Zero Odor: Veterinary behaviorist Dr. Nicholas Dodman of 
Tufts University’s Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine 
swears by this product, which its manufacturers flat-out 
guarantee will end pet odor problems. Of course, ending odor 
problems is crucial to successful housetraining — because if 
any odor or other residue of a doggie bathroom transgression 
remains, your housetrainee can be guaranteed to go back 
to the site of that transgression and perform an encore. I 
haven’t used this product myself, but if Dr. Dodman gives it 
a thumbs-up, I’m thinking it’s got to be good. See what you 
think by visiting www.zopet.com.
 
✓ UGoDog: This site showcases a unique indoor dog potty 
called, appropriately, the UGoDog. I’m including this site 
here in the appendix not because I endorse the product but 
because the site contains some good basic housetraining 
information. That said, as indoor canine bathrooms go, it’s 
more stylish looking than newspaper and can accommodate 
larger dogs than other indoor potties can. Case in point: My 
70-pound Golden Retriever, Allie, walked onto the UGoDog

without hesitation when asked. Nevertheless, I maintain that 
indoor bathrooms are best suited to small or medium-sized 
dogs. For the company’s own lowdown, head over to www.
ugodog.net.
 
✓ Secondnature: This is the Web site maintained by Nestlé-
Purina to showcase its dog litter product. The inclusion of this 
site in this appendix isn’t an endorsement of Secondnature 
over any other dog litter product on the market. The site 
does, however, include some good basic information that 
anyone can apply to potty training a dog, regardless of 
the method used. Find out more by moseying over to www.

Book ’Em!
This book probably tells you more about housetraining than you 
ever wanted to know. However, on the off chance that you don’t 
think it does or (more likely) that you want to know how to teach 
your dog to do other things and keep him healthy, here are some 
great sources of additional reading:
 
✓ Dogs For Dummies, 2nd Edition, by Gina Spadafori (Wiley): 
Just about the best all-around dog care book ever written. 
Spadafori answers pretty much every question a dog owner 
(or prospective dog owner) could ask. Great reference 
book — and a great read, too.
 
✓ The Holistic Dog Book: Canine Care for the 21st Century, 
by Denise Flaim (Howell Book House): As far as I’m con-
cerned, this is the best explanation of holistic veterinary 
medicine for dogs out there. The book provides terrific, 
detailed descriptions of how holistic veterinarians view 
canine health and nutrition.
 
✓ The Power of Positive Dog Training, by Pat Miller (Howell 
Book House): Miller is one of the best positive reinforcement 
dog trainers in the United States — and in this book, she 
shows why. She offers a readily understandable explanation 
of the science behind positive reinforcement and an equally 
clear description of how to use that science to train your dog 
humanely and wisely.
 
✓ Puppies For Dummies, 2nd Edition, by Sarah Hodgson 
(Wiley): Hodgson deals with all things puppy in this 
lavishly illustrated tome, and she includes a great chapter 
on housetraining.

The art of housetraining, just like anything else that employs the 
principles of canine behavioral science, is constantly evolving — 
and often, magazines can provide more timely information about 
that evolution than books can. Pet magazines, unfortunately, 
come and go, but the titles listed here have been around for a long 
time and are likely to stay around for an even longer period.

own purebred dogs but don’t exhibit those dogs in conforma-
tion shows (such as the annual Westminster Kennel Club Dog 
Show), the AKC offers this award-winning quarterly magazine. 
The articles and columns here emphasize basic dog care and

does this monthly newsletter report on trends in alternative 
medicine and holistic health care for dogs, but it also offers 
state-of-the-art advice about positive reinforcement training, 
including its application for housetraining. The editors 
pay special attention to nutrition, and the publication may 
be best known for its annual lists of the best and worst 
commercial dog foods — which can make a big difference 
not only in your dog’s overall health but also in his daily 
offloads. Subscriptions are available online at www.whole-
