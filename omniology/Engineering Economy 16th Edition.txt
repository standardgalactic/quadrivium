PREFACE
We live in a sea of economic decisions.
—Anonymous
About Engineering Economy
A succinct job description for an engineer consists of two words: problem solver.
Broadly speaking, engineers use knowledge to ﬁnd new ways of doing things
economically. Engineering design solutions do not exist in a vacuum but within the
context of a business opportunity. Given that every problem has multiple solutions,
the issue is, How does one rationally select the design with the most favorable
economic result? The answer to this question can also be put forth in two words:
engineering economy. Engineering economy provides a systematic framework for
evaluating the economic aspects of competing design solutions. Just as engineers
model the stress on a support column, or the thermodynamic response of a steam
turbine, they must also model the economic impact of their recommendations.
Engineering economy—what is it, and why is it important? The initial reaction
of many engineering students to these questions is, “Money matters will be handled
by someone else. They are not something I need to worry about.” In reality, any
engineering project must be not only physically realizable but also economically
affordable.
Understanding and applying economic principles to engineering have never
been more important. Engineering is more than a problem-solving activity focusing
on the development of products, systems, and processes to satisfy a need
or demand. Beyond function and performance, solutions must also be viable
economically. Design decisions affect limited resources such as time, material,
labor, capital, and natural resources, not only initially (during conceptual design)
but also through the remaining phases of the life cycle (e.g., detailed design,
manufacture and distribution, service, retirement and disposal). A great solution
can die a certain death if it is not proﬁtable.
• MyEngineeringLab is now available with Engineering Economy, 16/e and pro-
vides a powerful homework and test manager which lets instructors create,
import, and manage online homework assignments, quizzes, and tests that are
automatically graded. You can choose from a wide range of assignment options,
xi

PREFACE
including time limits, proctoring, and maximum number of attempts allowed.
The bottom line: MyEngineeringLab means less time grading and more time
teaching.
• Algorithmic-generated homework assignments,
quizzes,
and tests that
directly correlate to the textbook.
• Automatic grading that tracks students’ results.
• Assignable Spreadsheet Exercises that students can complete in an Excel-
simulated environment.
• Interactive “Help Me Solve This” tutorials provide opportunity for point-of-
use help and more practice.
• Learning Objectives mapped to ABET outcomes provide comprehensive
reporting tools. If adopted, access to MyEngineeringLab can be bundled with
the book or purchased separately.
What’s New to This Edition?
The basic intent behind this revision of the text is to integrate computer technology
and realistic examples to facilitate learning engineering economy. Here are the
highlights of changes to the sixteenth edition:
•
There are more integrated videos keyed to material in the text and designed to
reinforce learning through analogy with marked problems and examples.
•
Many new spreadsheet models have been added to the sixteenth edition
(several contributed by James A. Alloway).
•
This edition contains over 900 examples, solved problems and end-of-chapter
problems. These include 70 “Try Your Skills” problems in selected chapters,
with full solutions given in Appendix G.
•
Over 160 “green” examples and problems populate this edition as a subset
of 750 problems at the conclusion of the 14 chapters in this book. Many of
these problems incorporate energy conservation in commonly experienced
situations with which students can identify.
•
PowerPoint visual aids for instructors have been expanded and enhanced.
•
Chapter 2, dealing with choice among alternatives when the time value of
money can be ignored, has been revised for improved readability.
•
Optional student resources include MyEngineeringLab with Pearson e-text, a
complete on-line version of the book. It allows highlighting, note taking, and
search capabilities. This resource permits access to the Video Solutions ﬁles
which accompany this text as well as additional study materials. All end-of-
chapter problems with this icon [
] indicate the availability of some form of
Video Solutions.
Strategies of This Book
This book has two primary objectives: (1) to provide students with a sound
understanding of the principles, basic concepts, and methodology of engineering
economy; and (2) to help students develop proﬁciency with these methods and with

PREFACE xiii
the process for making rational decisions they are likely to encounter in professional
practice. Interestingly, an engineering economy course may be a student’s only college
exposure to the systematic evaluation of alternative investment opportunities. In this
regard, Engineering Economy is intended to serve as a text for classroom instruction
and as a basic reference for use by practicing engineers in all specialty areas
(e.g., chemical, civil, computer, electrical, industrial, and mechanical engineering).
The book is also useful to persons engaged in the management of technical
activities.
As a textbook, the sixteenth edition is written principally for the ﬁrst formal
course in engineering economy. A three-credit-hour semester course should be
able to cover the majority of topics in this edition, and there is sufﬁcient depth
and breadth to enable an instructor to arrange course content to suit individual
needs. Representative syllabi for a three-credit and a two-credit semester course
in engineering economy are provided in Table P-1. Moreover, because several
advanced topics are included, this book can also be used for a second course in
engineering economy.
All chapters and appendices have been revised and updated to reﬂect current
trends and issues. Also, numerous exercises that involve open-ended problem
statements and iterative problem-solving skills are included throughout the book.
A large number of the 750-plus end-of-chapter exercises are new, and many
solved examples representing realistic problems that arise in various engineering
disciplines are presented.
In the 21st century, America is turning over a new leaf for environmental
sustainability. We have worked hard to capture this spirit in many of our examples
and end-of-chapter problems. In fact, more than 160 “green” problems and
examples have been integrated throughout this edition. They are listed in the Green
Content section following the Preface.
Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) exam–style questions are included to
help prepare engineering students for this milestone examination, leading to
professional registration. Passing the FE exam is a ﬁrst step in getting licensed
as a professional engineer (PE). Engineering students should seriously consider
becoming a PE because it opens many employment opportunities and increases
lifetime earning potential.
It is generally advisable to teach engineering economy at the upper division
level. Here, an engineering economy course incorporates the accumulated knowl-
edge students have acquired in other areas of the curriculum and also deals with
iterative problem solving, open-ended exercises, creativity in formulating and
evaluating feasible solutions to problems, and consideration of realistic constraints
(economic, aesthetic, safety, etc.) in problem solving.
Also available to adopters of this edition is an instructor’s Solutions Manual
and other classroom resources. In addition, PowerPoint visual aids are readily
available to instructors. Visit www.pearsonhighered.com/sullivan for more
information.
Engineering Economy Portfolio
In many engineering economy courses, students are required to design, develop,
and maintain an engineering economy portfolio. The purpose of the portfolio
is to demonstrate and integrate knowledge of engineering economy beyond

the required assignments and tests. This is usually an individual assignment.
Professional presentation, clarity, brevity, and creativity are important criteria to
be used to evaluate portfolios. Students are asked to keep the audience (i.e., the
grader) in mind when constructing their portfolios.
The portfolio should contain a variety of content. To get credit for content,
students must display their knowledge. Simply collecting articles in a folder
demonstrates very little. To get credit for collected articles, students should read
them and write a brief summary of each one. The summary could explain how
the article is relevant to engineering economy, it could critique the article, or it
could check or extend any economic calculations in the article. The portfolio should
include both the summary and the article itself. Annotating the article by writing
comments in the margin is also a good idea. Other suggestions for portfolio content
follow (note that students are encouraged to be creative):
•
Describe and set up or solve an engineering economy problem from your own
discipline (e.g., electrical engineering or building construction).
•
Choose a project or problem in society or at your university and apply
engineering economic analysis to one or more proposed solutions.
•
Develop proposed homework or test problems for engineering economy.
Include the complete solution. Additionally, state which course objective(s)
this problem demonstrates (include text section).
•
Reﬂect upon and write about your progress in the class. You might include a
self-evaluation against the course objectives.
•
Include a photo or graphic that illustrates some aspects of engineering economy.
Include a caption that explains the relevance of the photo or graphic.
•
Include completely worked out practice problems. Use a different color pen to
show these were checked against the provided answers.
•
Rework missed test problems, including an explanation of each mistake.
(The preceding list could reﬂect the relative value of the suggested items; that is,
items at the top of the list are more important than items at the bottom of the
list.)
Students should develop an introductory section that explains the purpose
and organization of the portfolio. A table of contents and clearly marked sections
or headings are highly recommended. Cite the source (i.e., a complete bibliographic
entry) of all outside material. Remember, portfolios provide evidence that students
know more about engineering economy than what is reﬂected in the assignments
and exams. The focus should be on quality of evidence, not quantity.

Overview of the Book
This book is about making choices among competing engineering alternatives.
Most of the cash-ﬂow consequences of the alternatives lie in the future, so our
attention is directed toward the future and not the past. In Chapter 2, we examine
alternatives when the time value of money is not a complicating factor in the
analysis. We then turn our attention in Chapter 3 to how future cash ﬂows are
estimated. In Chapter 4 and subsequent chapters, we deal with alternatives where
the time value of money is a deciding factor in choosing among competing capital
investment opportunities.
Students can appreciate Chapters 2 and 3 and later chapters when they
consider alternatives in their personal lives, such as which job to accept upon
graduation, which automobile or truck to purchase, whether to buy a home or rent
a residence, and many other choices they will face. To be student friendly, we have
included many problems throughout this book that deal with personal ﬁnance.
These problems are timely and relevant to a student’s personal and professional
success, and these situations incorporate the structured problem-solving process
that students will learn from this book.
Chapter 4 concentrates on the concepts of money–time relationships and
economic equivalence. Speciﬁcally, we consider the time value of money in
evaluating the future revenues and costs associated with alternative uses of
money. Then, in Chapter 5, the methods commonly used to analyze the economic
consequences and proﬁtability of an alternative are demonstrated. These methods,
and their proper use in the comparison of alternatives, are primary subjects of
Chapter 6, which also includes a discussion of the appropriate time period for
an analysis. Thus, Chapters 4, 5, and 6 together develop an essential part of
the methodology needed for understanding the remainder of the book and for
performing engineering economy studies on a before-tax basis.
In Chapter 7, the additional details required to accomplish engineering
economy studies on an after-tax basis are explained. In the private sector, most
engineering economy studies are done on an after-tax basis. Therefore, Chapter 7
adds to the basic methodology developed in Chapters 4, 5, and 6.
The effects of inﬂation (or deﬂation), price changes, and international
exchange rates are the topics of Chapter 8. The concepts for handling price
changes and exchange rates in an engineering economy study are discussed both
comprehensively and pragmatically from an application viewpoint.
Often, an organization must analyze whether existing assets should be
continued in service or replaced with new assets to meet current and future
operating needs. In Chapter 9, techniques for addressing this question are

PREFACE xvii
developed and presented. Because the replacement of assets requires signiﬁcant
capital, decisions made in this area are important and demand special attention.
Chapter 10 is dedicated to the analysis of public projects with the beneﬁt–cost
ratio method of comparison. The development of this widely used method of
evaluating alternatives was motivated by the Flood Control Act passed by the
U.S. Congress in 1936.
Concern over uncertainty and risk is a reality in engineering practice. In
Chapter 11, the impact of potential variation between the estimated economic
outcomes of an alternative and the results that may occur is considered. Breakeven
and sensitivity techniques for analyzing the consequences of risk and uncertainty
in future estimates of revenues and costs are discussed and illustrated.
In Chapter 12, probabilistic techniques for analyzing the consequences of risk
and uncertainty in future cash-ﬂow estimates and other factors are explained.
Discrete and continuous probability concepts, as well as Monte Carlo simulation
techniques, are included in Chapter 12.
Chapter 13 is concerned with the proper identiﬁcation and analysis of all
projects and other needs for capital within an organization. Accordingly, the capital
ﬁnancing and capital allocation process to meet these needs is addressed. This
process is crucial to the welfare of an organization, because it affects most operating
outcomes, whether in terms of current product quality and service effectiveness or
long-term capability to compete in the world market. Finally, Chapter 14 discusses
many time-tested methods for including nonmonetary attributes (intangibles) in
engineering economy studies.

in

tern city, there are 310 trafﬁc intersections that have been
converted from incandescent lights to light-emitting diode (LED) lights. The
study that led to this decision was conducted by the sustainability manager of
the city. The wattage used at the intersections has been reduced from 150 watts
to 15 watts at each trafﬁc light. The resultant lighting bill has been lowered from
$440,000 annually to $44,000 annually. When engineers went to check the trafﬁc
light meters for the ﬁrst time, they were shocked by the low wattage numbers
and the associated cost. One of them said, “We thought the meters were broken
because the readings were so low.” The annual savings of $396,000 per year from
the trafﬁc light conversion more than paid for the $150,000 cost of installing the
LED lights. Chapter 1 introduces students to the decision-making process that
accompanies “go/no go” evaluations of investments in engineering projects such
as the one described above.

1.1 Introduction
The technological and social environments in which we live continue to change
at a rapid rate. In recent decades, advances in science and engineering have
transformed our transportation systems, revolutionized the practice of medicine,
and miniaturized electronic circuits so that a computer can be placed on a
semiconductor chip. The list of such achievements seems almost endless. In your
science and engineering courses, you will learn about some of the physical laws
that underlie these accomplishments.
The utilization of scientiﬁc and engineering knowledge for our beneﬁt is
achieved through the design of things we use, such as furnaces for vaporizing trash
and structures for supporting magnetic railways. However, these achievements
don’t occur without a price, monetary or otherwise. Therefore, the purpose of
this book is to develop and illustrate the principles and methodology required
to answer the basic economic question of any design: Do its beneﬁts exceed its
costs?
The Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology states that engineer-
ing “is the profession in which a knowledge of the mathematical and natural
sciences gained by study, experience, and practice is applied with judgment to
develop ways to utilize, economically, the materials and forces of nature for the
beneﬁt of mankind.”∗In this deﬁnition, the economic aspects of engineering are
emphasized, as well as the physical aspects. Clearly, it is essential that the economic
part of engineering practice be accomplished well. Thus, engineers use knowledge
to ﬁnd new ways of doing things economically.

SECTION 1.2 / THE PRINCIPLES OF ENGINEERING ECONOMY

Engineering economy involves the systematic evaluation of the economic merits
of proposed solutions to engineering problems. To be economically acceptable
(i.e., affordable), solutions to engineering problems must demonstrate a positive
balance of long-term beneﬁts over long-term costs, and they must also
• promote the well-being and survival of an organization,
• embody creative and innovative technology and ideas,
• permit identiﬁcation and scrutiny of their estimated outcomes, and
• translate proﬁtability to the “bottom line” through a valid and acceptable
measure of merit.
Engineering economy is the dollars-and-cents side of the decisions that
engineers make or recommend as they work to position a ﬁrm to be proﬁtable
in a highly competitive marketplace. Inherent to these decisions are trade-offs
among different types of costs and the performance (response time, safety, weight,
reliability, etc.) provided by the proposed design or problem solution. The mission
of engineering economy is to balance these trade-offs in the most economical manner.
For instance, if an engineer at Ford Motor Company invents a new transmission
lubricant that increases fuel mileage by 10% and extends the life of the transmission
by 30,000 miles, how much can the company afford to spend to implement this
invention? Engineering economy can provide an answer.
A few more of the myriad situations in which engineering economy plays a
crucial role in the analysis of project alternative come to mind:
1. Choosing the best design for a high-efﬁciency gas furnace
2. Selecting the most suitable robot for a welding operation on an automotive
assembly line
3. Makingarecommendationaboutwhetherjetairplanesforanovernightdelivery
service should be purchased or leased
4. Determining the optimal stafﬁng plan for a computer help desk
From these illustrations, it should be obvious that engineering economy includes
signiﬁcant technical considerations. Thus, engineering economy involves technical
analysis, with emphasis on the economic aspects, and has the objective of assisting
decisions. This is true whether the decision maker is an engineer interactively
analyzing alternatives at a computer-aided design workstation or the Chief
Executive Ofﬁcer (CEO) considering a new project. An engineer who is unprepared to
excel at engineering economy is not properly equipped for his or her job.
1.2 The Principles of Engineering Economy
The development, study, and application of any discipline must begin with a
basic foundation. We deﬁne the foundation for engineering economy to be a set of
principles that provide a comprehensive doctrine for developing the methodology.
These principles will be mastered by students as they progress through this book.

4
CHAPTER 1 / INTRODUCTION TO ENGINEERING ECONOMY
Once a problem or need has been clearly deﬁned, the foundation of the discipline
can be discussed in terms of seven principles.
PRINCIPLE 1
Develop the Alternatives
Carefully deﬁne the problem! Then the choice (decision) is among alternatives.
The alternatives need to be identiﬁed and then deﬁned for subsequent analysis.
A decision situation involves making a choice among two or more alternatives.
Developing and deﬁning the alternatives for detailed evaluation is important
because of the resulting impact on the quality of the decision. Engineers and
managers should place a high priority on this responsibility. Creativity and
innovation are essential to the process.
One alternative that may be feasible in a decision situation is making no change
to the current operation or set of conditions (i.e., doing nothing). If you judge this
option feasible, make sure it is considered in the analysis. However, do not focus
on the status quo to the detriment of innovative or necessary change.
PRINCIPLE 2
Focus on the Differences
Only the differences in expected future outcomes among the alternatives are
relevant to their comparison and should be considered in the decision.
If all prospective outcomes of the feasible alternatives were exactly the same, there
would be no basis or need for comparison. We would be indifferent among the
alternatives and could make a decision using a random selection.
Obviously, only the differences in the future outcomes of the alternatives are
important. Outcomes that are common to all alternatives can be disregarded in
the comparison and decision. For example, if your feasible housing alternatives
were two residences with the same purchase (or rental) price, price would be
inconsequential to your ﬁnal choice. Instead, the decision would depend on other
factors, such as location and annual operating and maintenance expenses. This
simple example illustrates Principle 2, which emphasizes the basic purpose of an
engineering economic analysis: to recommend a future course of action based on
the differences among feasible alternatives.
PRINCIPLE 3
Use a Consistent Viewpoint
The prospective outcomes of the alternatives, economic and other, should be
consistently developed from a deﬁned viewpoint (perspective).
The perspective of the decision maker, which is often that of the owners of the
ﬁrm, would normally be used. However, it is important that the viewpoint for the

SECTION 1.2 / THE PRINCIPLES OF ENGINEERING ECONOMY
5
particular decision be ﬁrst deﬁned and then used consistently in the description,
analysis, and comparison of the alternatives.
As an example, consider a public organization operating for the purpose of
developing a river basin, including the generation and wholesale distribution of
electricity from dams on the river system. A program is being planned to upgrade
and increase the capacity of the power generators at two sites. What perspective
should be used in deﬁning the technical alternatives for the program? The “owners
of the ﬁrm” in this example means the segment of the public that will pay the cost
of the program, and their viewpoint should be adopted in this situation.
Now let us look at an example where the viewpoint may not be that of the
owners of the ﬁrm. Suppose that the company in this example is a private ﬁrm and
that the problem deals with providing a ﬂexible beneﬁts package for the employees.
Also, assume that the feasible alternatives for operating the plan all have the same
future costs to the company. The alternatives, however, have differences from
the perspective of the employees, and their satisfaction is an important decision
criterion. The viewpoint for this analysis should be that of the employees of the
company as a group, and the feasible alternatives should be deﬁned from their
perspective.
PRINCIPLE 4
Use a Common Unit of Measure
Using a common unit of measurement to enumerate as many of the prospective
outcomes as possible will simplify the analysis of the alternatives.
It is desirable to make as many prospective outcomes as possible commensurable
(directly comparable). For economic consequences, a monetary unit such as dollars
is the common measure. You should also try to translate other outcomes (which
do not initially appear to be economic) into the monetary unit. This translation, of
course, will not be feasible with some of the outcomes, but the additional effort
toward this goal will enhance commensurability and make the subsequent analysis
of alternatives easier.
What should you do with the outcomes that are not economic (i.e., the expected
consequences that cannot be translated (and estimated) using the monetary unit)?
First, if possible, quantify the expected future results using an appropriate unit of
measurement for each outcome. If this is not feasible for one or more outcomes,
describe these consequences explicitly so that the information is useful to the
decision maker in the comparison of the alternatives.
PRINCIPLE 5
Consider All Relevant Criteria
Selection of a preferred alternative (decision making) requires the use of a
criterion (or several criteria). The decision process should consider both the
outcomes enumerated in the monetary unit and those expressed in some other
unit of measurement or made explicit in a descriptive manner.

6
CHAPTER 1 / INTRODUCTION TO ENGINEERING ECONOMY
The decision maker will normally select the alternative that will best serve the
long-term interests of the owners of the organization. In engineering economic
analysis, the primary criterion relates to the long-term ﬁnancial interests of the
owners. This is based on the assumption that available capital will be allocated to
provide maximum monetary return to the owners. Often, though, there are other
organizational objectives you would like to achieve with your decision, and these
should be considered and given weight in the selection of an alternative. These
nonmonetary attributes and multiple objectives become the basis for additional
criteria in the decision-making process. This is the subject of Chapter 14.
PRINCIPLE 6
Make Risk and Uncertainty Explicit
Risk and uncertainty are inherent in estimating the future outcomes of the alter-
natives and should be recognized in their analysis and comparison.
The analysis of the alternatives involves projecting or estimating the future
consequencesassociatedwitheachofthem. Themagnitudeandtheimpactoffuture
outcomes of any course of action are uncertain. Even if the alternative involves no
change from current operations, the probability is high that today’s estimates of,
for example, future cash receipts and expenses will not be what eventually occurs.
Thus, dealing with uncertainty is an important aspect of engineering economic
analysis and is the subject of Chapters 11 and 12.
PRINCIPLE 7
Revisit Your Decisions
Improved decision making results from an adaptive process; to the extent
practicable, the initial projected outcomes of the selected alternative should be
subsequently compared with actual results achieved.
A good decision-making process can result in a decision that has an undesirable
outcome. Other decisions, even though relatively successful, will have results
signiﬁcantly different from the initial estimates of the consequences. Learning from
and adapting based on our experience are essential and are indicators of a good
organization.
The evaluation of results versus the initial estimate of outcomes for the selected
alternative is often considered impracticable or not worth the effort. Too often,
no feedback to the decision-making process occurs. Organizational discipline is
needed to ensure that implemented decisions are routinely postevaluated and that
the results are used to improve future analyses and the quality of decision making.
For example, a common mistake made in the comparison of alternatives is the
failure to examine adequately the impact of uncertainty in the estimates for selected
factors on the decision. Only postevaluations will highlight this type of weakness
in the engineering economy studies being done in an organization.

SECTION 1.3 / ENGINEERING ECONOMY AND THE DESIGN PROCESS
7
1.3 Engineering Economy and the Design Process
An engineering economy study is accomplished using a structured procedure
and mathematical modeling techniques. The economic results are then used in
a decision situation that normally includes other engineering knowledge and
input.
Asound engineering economic analysis procedure incorporates the basic principles
discussed in Section 1.2 and involves several steps. We represent the procedure
in terms of the seven steps listed in the left-hand column of Table 1-1. There are
several feedback loops (not shown) within the procedure. For example, within
Step 1, information developed in evaluating the problem will be used as feedback
to reﬁne the problem deﬁnition. As another example, information from the analysis
of alternatives (Step 5) may indicate the need to change one or more of them or to
develop additional alternatives.
The seven-step procedure is also used to assist decision making within the
engineering design process, shown as the right-hand column in Table 1-1. In this
case, activities in the design process contribute information to related steps in the
economic analysis procedure. The general relationship between the activities in
the design process and the steps of the economic analysis procedure is indicated
in Table 1-1.
The engineering design process may be repeated in phases to accomplish a
total design effort. For example, in the ﬁrst phase, a full cycle of the process may
be undertaken to select a conceptual or preliminary design alternative. Then, in
the second phase, the activities are repeated to develop the preferred detailed
design based on the selected preliminary design. The seven-step economic analysis

procedure would be repeated as required to assist decision making in each phase
of the total design effort. This procedure is discussed next.
1.3.1
Problem Deﬁnition
The ﬁrst step of the engineering economic analysis procedure (problem deﬁnition)
is particularly important, since it provides the basis for the rest of the analysis. A
problem must be well understood and stated in an explicit form before the project
team proceeds with the rest of the analysis.
The term problem is used here generically. It includes all decision situations for
which an engineering economy analysis is required. Recognition of the problem is
normally stimulated by internal or external organizational needs or requirements.
An operating problem within a company (internal need) or a customer expectation
about a product or service (external requirement) are examples.
Once the problem is recognized, its formulation should be viewed from a
systems perspective. That is, the boundary or extent of the situation needs to
be carefully deﬁned, thus establishing the elements of the problem and what
constitutes its environment.
Evaluation of the problem includes reﬁnement of needs and requirements, and
information from the evaluation phase may change the original formulation of the
problem. In fact, redeﬁning the problem until a consensus is reached may be the
most important part of the problem-solving process!
1.3.2
Development of Alternatives∗
The two primary actions in Step 2 of the procedure are (1) searching for potential
alternatives and (2) screening them to select a smaller group of feasible alternatives
for detailed analysis. The term feasible here means that each alternative selected for
further analysis is judged, based on preliminary evaluation, to meet or exceed the
requirements established for the situation.
1.3.2.1
Searching for Superior Alternatives In the discussion of Prin-
ciple 1 (Section 1.2), creativity and resourcefulness were emphasized as being
absolutely essential to the development of potential alternatives. The difference
between good alternatives and great alternatives depends largely on an indi-
vidual’s or group’s problem-solving efﬁciency. Such efﬁciency can be increased in
the following ways:
1. Concentrate on redeﬁning one problem at a time in Step 1.
2. Develop many redeﬁnitions for the problem.
3. Avoid making judgments as new problem deﬁnitions are created.
4. Attempt to redeﬁne a problem in terms that are dramatically different from the
original Step 1 problem deﬁnition.
∗This is sometimes called option development. This important step is described in detail in A. B. Van Gundy, Techniques
of Structured Problem Solving, 2nd ed. (New York: Van Nostrand Reinhold Co., 1988). For additional reading, see
E. Lumsdaine and M. Lumsdaine, Creative Problem Solving—An Introductory Course for Engineering Students (New York:
McGraw-Hill Book Co., 1990) and J. L.Adams, Conceptual Blockbusting—A Guide to Better Ideas (Reading, MA:Addison-
Wesley Publishing Co., 1986).

SECTION 1.3 / ENGINEERING ECONOMY AND THE DESIGN PROCESS

5. Make sure that the true problem is well researched and understood.
In searching for superior alternatives or identifying the true problem, several
limitations invariably exist, including (1) lack of time and money, (2) preconcep-
tions of what will and what will not work, and (3) lack of knowledge. Consequently,
the engineer or project team will be working with less-than-perfect problem
solutions in the practice of engineering.
EXAMPLE 1-1
Deﬁning the Problem and Developing Alternatives
The management team of a small furniture-manufacturing company is under
pressure to increase proﬁtability to get a much-needed loan from the bank to
purchase a more modern pattern-cutting machine. One proposed solution is to
sell waste wood chips and shavings to a local charcoal manufacturer instead of
using them to fuel space heaters for the company’s ofﬁce and factory areas.
(a) Deﬁne the company’s problem. Next, reformulate the problem in a variety
of creative ways.
(b) Develop at least one potential alternative for your reformulated problems
in Part (a). (Don’t concern yourself with feasibility at this point.)
Solution
(a) The company’s problem appears to be that revenues are not sufﬁciently
covering costs. Several reformulations can be posed:
1. The problem is to increase revenues while reducing costs.
2. The problem is to maintain revenues while reducing costs.
3. The problem is an accounting system that provides distorted cost
information.
4. The problem is that the new machine is really not needed (and hence
there is no need for a bank loan).
(b) Based only on reformulation 1, an alternative is to sell wood chips and
shavings as long as increased revenue exceeds extra expenses that may
be required to heat the buildings. Another alternative is to discontinue
the manufacture of specialty items and concentrate on standardized, high-
volume products. Yet another alternative is to pool purchasing, accounting,
engineering, and other white-collar support services with other small ﬁrms
in the area by contracting with a local company involved in providing these
services.
1.3.2.2
Developing Investment Alternatives “It takes money to make
money,” as the old saying goes. Did you know that in the United States the average
ﬁrm spends over $250,000 in capital on each of its employees? So, to make money,
each ﬁrm must invest capital to support its important human resources—but
in what else should an individual ﬁrm invest? There are usually hundreds of
opportunities for a company to make money. Engineers are at the very heart of
creating value for a ﬁrm by turning innovative and creative ideas into new or

10
CHAPTER 1 / INTRODUCTION TO ENGINEERING ECONOMY
reengineered commercial products and services. Most of these ideas require invest-
ment of money, and only a few of all feasible ideas can be developed, due to lack
of time, knowledge, or resources.
Consequently, most investment alternatives created by good engineering ideas
are drawn from a larger population of equally good problem solutions. But how
can this larger set of equally good solutions be tapped into? Interestingly, studies
have concluded that designers and problem solvers tend to pursue a few ideas that
involve “patching and repairing” an old idea.∗Truly new ideas are often excluded
from consideration! This section outlines two approaches that have found wide
acceptance in industry for developing sound investment alternatives by removing
some of the barriers to creative thinking: (1) classical brainstorming and (2) the
Nominal Group Technique (NGT).
(1) Classical Brainstorming.
Classical brainstorming is the most well-known
and often-used technique for idea generation. It is based on the fundamental
principles of deferment of judgment and that quantity breeds quality. There are four
rules for successful brainstorming:
1. Criticism is ruled out.
2. Freewheeling is welcomed.
3. Quantity is wanted.
4. Combination and improvement are sought.
A. F. Osborn lays out a detailed procedure for successful brainstorming.† Aclassical
brainstorming session has the following basic steps:
1. Preparation. The participants are selected, and a preliminary statement of the
problem is circulated.
2. Brainstorming.
A warm-up session with simple unrelated problems is
conducted, the relevant problem and the four rules of brainstorming are
presented, and ideas are generated and recorded using checklists and other
techniques if necessary.
3. Evaluation. The ideas are evaluated relative to the problem.
Generally, a brainstorming group should consist of four to seven people, although
some suggest larger groups.
(2) Nominal Group Technique.
The NGT, developed by Andre P. Delbecq
and Andrew H. Van de Ven,‡ involves a structured group meeting designed to
incorporate individual ideas and judgments into a group consensus. By correctly
applying the NGT, it is possible for groups of people (preferably, 5 to 10) to generate
investment alternatives or other ideas for improving the competitiveness of the

SECTION 1.3 / ENGINEERING ECONOMY AND THE DESIGN PROCESS 11
ﬁrm. Indeed, the technique can be used to obtain group thinking (consensus) on a
wide range of topics. For example, a question that might be given to the group is,
“What are the most important problems or opportunities for improvement of . . .?”
Thetechnique, whenproperlyapplied, drawsonthecreativityoftheindividual
participants, while reducing two undesirable effects of most group meetings: (1) the
dominance of one or more participants and (2) the suppression of conﬂicting ideas.
The basic format of an NGT session is as follows:
1. Individual silent generation of ideas
2. Individual round-robin feedback and recording of ideas
3. Group clariﬁcation of each idea
4. Individual voting and ranking to prioritize ideas
5. Discussion of group consensus results
The NGT session begins with an explanation of the procedure and a statement
of question(s), preferably written by the facilitator.∗The group members are
then asked to prepare individual listings of alternatives, such as investment
ideas or issues that they feel are crucial for the survival and health of the
organization. This is known as the silent-generation phase. After this phase has
been completed, the facilitator calls on each participant, in round-robin fashion,
to present one idea from his or her list (or further thoughts as the round-robin
session is proceeding). Each idea (or opportunity) is then identiﬁed in turn and
recorded on a ﬂip chart or board by the NGT facilitator, leaving ample space
between ideas for comments or clariﬁcation. This process continues until all the
opportunities have been recorded, clariﬁed, and displayed for all to see. At this
point, a voting procedure is used to prioritize the ideas or opportunities. Finally,
voting results lead to the development of group consensus on the topic being
addressed.
1.3.3
Development of Prospective Outcomes
Step 3 of the engineering economic analysis procedure incorporates Principles 2, 3,
and 4 from Section 1.2 and uses the basic cash-ﬂow approach employed in engineering
economy. A cash ﬂow occurs when money is transferred from one organization
or individual to another. Thus, a cash ﬂow represents the economic effects of an
alternative in terms of money spent and received.
Consider the concept of an organization having only one “window” to its
external environment through which all monetary transactions occur—receipts
of revenues and payments to suppliers, creditors, and employees. The key to
developing the related cash ﬂows for an alternative is estimating what would
happen to the revenues and costs, as seen at this window, if the particular
alternative were implemented. The net cash ﬂow for an alternative is the difference
between all cash inﬂows (receipts or savings) and cash outﬂows (costs or expenses)
during each time period.
∗A good example of the NGT is given in D. S. Sink, “Using the Nominal Group Technique Effectively,” National
Productivity Review, 2 (Spring 1983): 173–84.

12
CHAPTER 1 / INTRODUCTION TO ENGINEERING ECONOMY
In addition to the economic aspects of decision making, nonmonetary factors
(attributes) often play a signiﬁcant role in the ﬁnal recommendation. Examples
of objectives other than proﬁt maximization or cost minimization that can be
important to an organization include the following:
1. Meeting or exceeding customer expectations
2. Safety to employees and to the public
3. Improving employee satisfaction
4. Maintaining production ﬂexibility to meet changing demands
5. Meeting or exceeding all environmental requirements
6. Achieving good public relations or being an exemplary member of the
community
1.3.4
Selection of a Decision Criterion
The selection of a decision criterion (Step 4 of the analysis procedure) incorporates
Principle 5 (consider all relevant criteria). The decision maker will normally select
the alternative that will best serve the long-term interests of the owners of the
organization. It is also true that the economic decision criterion should reﬂect
a consistent and proper viewpoint (Principle 3) to be maintained throughout an
engineering economy study.
1.3.5
Analysis and Comparison of Alternatives
Analysis of the economic aspects of an engineering problem (Step 5) is largely
based on cash-ﬂow estimates for the feasible alternatives selected for detailed study.
A substantial effort is normally required to obtain reasonably accurate forecasts of
cash ﬂows and other factors in view of, for example, inﬂationary (or deﬂationary)
pressures, exchange rate movements, and regulatory (legal) mandates that often
occur. Clearly, the consideration of future uncertainties (Principle 6) is an essential
partofanengineeringeconomystudy. Whencashﬂowandotherrequiredestimates
are eventually determined, alternatives can be compared based on their differences
as called for by Principle 2. Usually, these differences will be quantiﬁed in terms of
a monetary unit such as dollars.
1.3.6
Selection of the Preferred Alternative
When the ﬁrst ﬁve steps of the engineering economic analysis procedure have been
done properly, the preferred alternative (Step 6) is simply a result of the total effort.
Thus, the soundness of the technical-economic modeling and analysis techniques
dictates the quality of the results obtained and the recommended course of action.
Step 6 is included in Activity 5 of the engineering design process (speciﬁcation of
the preferred alternative) when done as part of a design effort.
1.3.7
Performance Monitoring and Postevaluation of Results
This ﬁnal step implements Principle 7 and is accomplished during and after the
timethattheresultsachievedfromtheselectedalternativearecollected. Monitoring

SECTION 1.3 / ENGINEERING ECONOMY AND THE DESIGN PROCESS 13
project performance during its operational phase improves the achievement of
related goals and objectives and reduces the variability in desired results. Step 7 is
also the follow-up step to a previous analysis, comparing actual results achieved
with the previously estimated outcomes. The aim is to learn how to do better
analyses, and the feedback from postimplementation evaluation is important to
the continuing improvement of operations in any organization. Unfortunately, like
Step 1, this ﬁnal step is often not done consistently or well in engineering practice;
therefore, it needs particular attention to ensure feedback for use in ongoing and
subsequent studies.
EXAMPLE 1-2
Application of the Engineering Economic Analysis Procedure
A friend of yours bought a small apartment building for $100,000 in a college
town. She spent $10,000 of her own money for the building and obtained a
mortgage from a local bank for the remaining $90,000. The annual mortgage
payment to the bank is $10,500. Your friend also expects that annual maintenance
on the building and grounds will be $15,000. There are four apartments (two
bedrooms each) in the building that can each be rented for $360 per month.
Refer to the seven-step procedure in Table 1-1 (left-hand side) to answer
these questions:
(a) Does your friend have a problem? If so, what is it?
(b) What are her alternatives? (Identify at least three.)
(c) Estimate the economic consequences and other required data for the
alternatives in Part (b).
(d) Select a criterion for discriminating among alternatives, and use it to advise
your friend on which course of action to pursue.
(e) Attempt to analyze and compare the alternatives in view of at least one
criterion in addition to cost.
(f) What should your friend do based on the information you and she have
generated?
Solution
(a) A quick set of calculations shows that your friend does indeed have a
problem.Alotmoremoneyisbeingspentbyyourfriendeachyear($10,500 +
$15,000 = $25,500) than is being received (4 × $360 × 12 = $17,280). The
problem could be that the monthly rent is too low. She’s losing $8,220 per
year. (Now, that’s a problem!)
(b) Option (1). Raise the rent. (Will the market bear an increase?)
Option (2). Lower maintenance expenses (but not so far as to cause safety
problems).
Option (3). Sell the apartment building. (What about a loss?)
Option (4). Abandon the building (bad for your friend’s reputation).
(c) Option (1). Raise total monthly rent to $1,440+$R for the four apartments to
cover monthly expenses of $2,125. Note that the minimum increase in rent

14
CHAPTER 1 / INTRODUCTION TO ENGINEERING ECONOMY
would be ($2,125 −$1,440)/4 = $171.25 per apartment per month (almost a
50% increase!).
Option (2). Lower monthly expenses to $2,125 −$C so that these expenses
are covered by the monthly revenue of $1,440 per month. This would have
to be accomplished primarily by lowering the maintenance cost. (There’s
not much to be done about the annual mortgage cost unless a favorable
reﬁnancing opportunity presents itself.) Monthly maintenance expenses
would have to be reduced to ($1,440 −$10,500/12) = $565. This represents
more than a 50% decrease in maintenance expenses.
Option (3). Try to sell the apartment building for $X, which recovers the
original $10,000 investment and (ideally) recovers the $685 per month loss
($8,220 ÷ 12) on the venture during the time it was owned.
Option (4). Walk away from the venture and kiss your investment good-bye.
The bank would likely assume possession through foreclosure and may try
to collect fees from your friend. This option would also be very bad for your
friend’s credit rating.
(d) One criterion could be to minimize the expected loss of money. In this case,
you might advise your friend to pursue Option (1) or (3).
(e) For example, let’s use “credit worthiness” as an additional criterion. Option
(4) is immediately ruled out. Exercising Option (3) could also harm your
friend’s credit rating. Thus, Options (1) and (2) may be her only realistic and
acceptable alternatives.
(f) Your friend should probably do a market analysis of comparable housing
in the area to see if the rent could be raised (Option 1). Maybe a fresh coat
of paint and new carpeting would make the apartments more appealing
to prospective renters. If so, the rent can probably be raised while keeping
100% occupancy of the four apartments.
Atip to the wise—as an aside to Example 1-2, your friend would need a good credit
report to get her mortgage approved. In this regard, there are three major credit
bureaus in the United States: Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. It’s a good idea to
regularly review your own credit report for unauthorized activity. You are entitled
to a free copy of your report once per year from each bureau. Consider getting a
report every four months from www.annualcreditreport.com.
EXAMPLE 1-3
Get Rid of the Old Clunker?
Engineeringeconomyisallaboutdecidingamongcompetingalternatives. When
the time value of money is NOT a key ingredient in a problem, Chapter 2 should
be referenced. If the time value of money (e.g., an interest rate) is integral to an
engineering problem, Chapter 4 (and beyond) provides an explanation of how
to analyze these problems.
Consider this situation: Linda and Jerry are faced with a car replacement
opportunity where an interest rate can be ignored. Jerry’s old clunker that

SECTION 1.5 / TRY YOUR SKILLS 15
averages 10 miles per gallon (mpg) of gasoline can be traded in toward a vehicle
that gets 15 mpg. Or, as an alternative, Linda’s 25 mpg car can be traded in
toward a new hybrid vehicle that averages 50 mpg. If they drive both cars 12,000
miles per year and their goal is to minimize annual gas consumption, which car
should be replaced—Jerry’s or Linda’s? They can only afford to upgrade one
car at this time.
Solution
Jerry’s trade-in will save (12,000 miles/year)/10 mpg −(12,000 miles/year)/
15 mpg = 1,200 gallons/year −800 gallons/year = 400 gallons/year.
Linda’s trade-in will save (12,000 miles/year)/25 mpg −(12,000 miles/
year)/50 mpg = 480 gallons/year −240 gallons/year = 240 gallons/year.
Therefore, Jerry should trade in his vehicle to save more gasoline.
1.4
Using Spreadsheets in Engineering Economic Analysis
Spreadsheets are a useful tool for solving engineering economy problems. Most
engineering economy problems are amenable to spreadsheet solution for the
following reasons:
1. They consist of structured, repetitive calculations that can be expressed as
formulas that rely on a few functional relationships.
2. The parameters of the problem are subject to change.
3. The results and the underlying calculations must be documented.
4. Graphical output is often required, as well as control over the format of the
graphs.
Spreadsheets allow the analyst to develop an application rapidly, without being
inundated by the housekeeping details of programming languages. They relieve
the analyst of the drudgery of number crunching but still focus on problem
formulation. Computer spreadsheets created in Excel are integrated throughout all
chapters in this book. More on spreadsheet modeling can be found in Appendix A.

Summary
In this chapter, we deﬁned engineering economy and presented the fundamental
concepts in terms of seven basic principles (see pp. 3–6). Experience has shown
that most errors in engineering economic analyses can be traced to some violation
of these principles. We will continue to stress these principles in the chapters that
follow.
The seven-step engineering economic analysis procedure described in this
chapter (see p. 7) has direct ties to the engineering design process. Following this
systematic approach will assist engineers in designing products and systems and
in providing technical services that promote the economic welfare of the company
they work for. This same approach will also help you as an individual make sound
ﬁnancial decisions in your personal life.
In summary, engineering economy is a collection of problem-solving tools and
techniques that are applied to engineering, business, and environmental issues.
Common, yet often complex, problems involving money are easier to understand
and solve when you have a good grasp on the engineering economy approach to
problem solving and decision making. The problem-solving focus of this text will
enable you to master the theoretical and applied principles of engineering economy.
Problems
The number in parentheses that follows each problem
refers to the section from which the problem is taken.
1-1. Stan Moneymaker needs 15 gallons of
gasoline to top off his automobile’s gas tank. If
he drives an extra eight miles (round trip) to a gas
station on the outskirts of town, Stan can save $0.10
per gallon on the price of gasoline. Suppose gasoline
costs $3.90 per gallon and Stan’s car gets 25 mpg for
in-town driving. Should Stan make the trip to get less
expensive gasoline? Each mile that Stan drives creates
one pound of carbon dioxide. Each pound of CO2 has
a cost impact of $0.02 on the environment. What other
factors (cost and otherwise) should Stan consider in his
decision making? (1.2)

is $0.75. It is designed to provide 1.5 volts and
1.0 amps for about an hour. Now we multiply volts and
ampstoobtainpowerof1.5wattsfromthebattery. Thus,
it costs $0.75 for 1.5 Watt-hours of energy. How much
would it cost to deliver one kilo Watt-hour? How does
this compare with the cost of energy from your local
electric utility at $0.10 per kilo Watt-hour? (1.2, 1.3)
1-4. Tyler just wrecked his new Nissan, and the acci-
dent was his fault. The owner of the other vehicle got
two estimates for the repairs: one was for $803 and
the other was for $852. Tyler is thinking of keeping
the insurance companies out of the incident to keep
his driving record “clean.” Tyler’s deductible on his
comprehensive coverage insurance is $500, and he
does not want his premium to increase because of the
accident. In this regard, Tyler estimates that his semi-
annual premium will rise by $60 if he ﬁles a claim
against his insurance company. In view of the above
information, Tyler’sinitialdecisionistowriteapersonal

to intercept storms advancing on Moscow and to seed
them with dry ice and silver iodine particles. The
idea is to make the snow drop on villages in the

this initiative will be 180 million rubles, and the savings
in snow removal will be in the neighborhood of 300

very good investment. Suppose that a college graduate

of earning a college degree? (1.3)
1-9. Automobile repair shops typically recomm-
end that their customers change their oil and oil
ﬁlter every 3,000 miles. Your automobile user’s manual
suggests changing your oil every 5,000–7,000 miles. If
you drive your car 15,000 miles each year and an oil

you are asked to evaluate alternatives for
producing a newly designed drill bit on a turning
machine.
Your

memorandum
to
you
has
practically no information about what the alternatives
are and what criteria should be used. The same task
was posed to a previous employee who could not
ﬁnish the analysis, but she has given you the following
information: An old turning machine valued at $350,000
exists (in the warehouse) that can be modiﬁed for the
new drill bit. The in-house technicians have given
an estimate of $40,000 to modify this machine, and
they assure you that they will have the machine ready
before the projected start date (although they have
never done any modiﬁcations of this type). It is hoped
that the old turning machine will be able to meet
production requirements at full capacity. An outside
company, McDonald Inc., made the machine seven
years ago and can easily do the same modiﬁcations
for $60,000. The cooling system used for this machine
is not environmentally safe and would require some
disposal costs. McDonald Inc. has offered to build a new
turning machine with more environmental safeguards
and higher capacity for a price of $450,000. McDonald
Inc. has promised this machine before the startup date
and is willing to pay any late costs. Your company has
$100,000 set aside for the start-up of the new product
line of drill bits. For this situation,
a. Deﬁne the problem.
b. List key assumptions.
c. List alternatives facing Greenﬁeld Industries.

Bad news: You have just wrecked your car! You need
another car immediately because you have decided
that walking, riding a bike, and taking a bus are
not acceptable. An automobile wholesaler offers you
$2,000 for your wrecked car “as is.”
Also,
your
insurance company’s claims adjuster estimates that
there is $2,000 in damages to your car. Because you
have collision insurance with a $1,000 deductibility
provision, the insurance company mails you a check
for $1,000. The odometer reading on your wrecked car
is 58,000 miles.
What should you do? Use the seven-step procedure
from Table 1-1 to analyze your situation. Also, identify
which principles accompany each step.
1-17. “What you do at work is your boss’ business” is
a timely warning for all employees to heed. Last year,
your company installed a new computer surveillance
program in an effort to improve ofﬁce productivity.
As a courtesy, all employees were informed of this
change. The license for the software costs $30,000
per year. After a year of use, productivity has risen 10%,
which translates into a savings of $30,000. Discuss other
factors, in addition to productivity, that could have been
used to justify the surveillance software.
1-18. Owing to the rising cost of copper, in 1982 the
U.S. Mint changed the composition of pennies from 95%
copper (and 5% zinc) to 2.5% copper (and 97.5% zinc) to
save money. Your favorite aunt has a collection of 5,000
pennies minted before 1982, and she intends on gifting
the collection to you.
a. What is the collection’s value based on metal content
alone? Copper sells for $3.50 per pound and zinc for
$1 per pound. It takes approximately 130 pre-1982
pennies to add up to one pound of total weight.
b. If it cost the U.S. Mint $0.017 to produce a penny in
2012, is it time to eliminate pennies and round off all
ﬁnancial transactions to the nearest 5 cents (nickel)?
As a matter of interest, it cost the government almost
10 cents to produce a nickel in 2012.
1-19. A home mortgage is “under water” when the
amount of money owed on it is much greater than

$10,000 equity in the home and your monthly payments
are $938. (1.3)

CHAPTER 2
Cost Concepts and Design
Economics
The objective of Chapter 2 is to analyze short-term alternatives when the
time value of money is not a factor. We accomplish this with three types of
problems: 1) economic breakeven analysis; 2) cost-driven design
optimization; and 3) present economy studies.
The A380 Superjumbo’s Breakeven Point
W
hen Europe’s Airbus Company approved the A380 program in 2000,
it was estimated that only 250 of the giant, 555-seat aircraft needed to
be sold to break even. The program was initially based on expected
deliveries of 751 aircraft over its life cycle. Long delays and mounting costs,
however, have dramatically changed the original breakeven ﬁgure. In 2005, this
ﬁgure was updated to 270 aircraft. According to an article in the Financial Times
(October 20, 2006, p. 18), Airbus would have to sell 420 aircraft to break even—
a 68% increase over the original estimate. To date, only 262 ﬁrm orders for the
aircraft have been received. The topic of breakeven analysis is an integral part of
this chapter.

The correct solution to any problem depends primarily on a true
understanding of what the problem really is.

2.1 Cost Terminology
There are a variety of costs to be considered in an engineering economic analysis.∗
These costs differ in their frequency of occurrence, relative magnitude, and degree
of impact on the study. In this section, we deﬁne a number of cost categories and
illustrate how they should be treated in an engineering economic analysis.
2.1.1
Fixed, Variable, and Incremental Costs
Fixed costs are those unaffected by changes in activity level over a feasible range
of operations for the capacity or capability available. Typical ﬁxed costs include
insurance and taxes on facilities, general management and administrative salaries,
license fees, and interest costs on borrowed capital.
Of course, any cost is subject to change, but ﬁxed costs tend to remain constant
over a speciﬁc range of operating conditions. When larger changes in usage of
resources occur, or when plant expansion or shutdown is involved, ﬁxed costs can
be affected.
Variable costs are those associated with an operation that varies in total with
the quantity of output or other measures of activity level. For example, the costs
of material and labor used in a product or service are variable costs, because they
vary in total with the number of output units, even though the costs per unit stay
the same.
An incremental cost (or incremental revenue) is the additional cost (or revenue)
that results from increasing the output of a system by one (or more) units.
Incrementalcostisoftenassociatedwith“go–nogo”decisionsthatinvolvealimited
change in output or activity level. For instance, the incremental cost per mile for
driving an automobile may be $0.49, but this cost depends on considerations such
as total mileage driven during the year (normal operating range), mileage expected
for the next major trip, and the age of the automobile. Also, it is common to read
about the “incremental cost of producing a barrel of oil” and “incremental cost to
the state for educating a student.” As these examples indicate, the incremental cost
(or revenue) is often quite difﬁcult to determine in practice.
EXAMPLE 2-1
Fixed and Variable Costs
In connection with surfacing a new highway, a contractor has a choice of two sites
on which to set up the asphalt-mixing plant equipment. The contractor estimates
that it will cost $2.75 per cubic yard mile (yd3-mile) to haul the asphalt-paving
material from the mixing plant to the job location. Factors relating to the two
mixing sites are as follows (production costs at each site are the same):
∗For the purposes of this book, the words cost and expense are used interchangeably.

The job requires 50,000 cubic yards of mixed-asphalt-paving material. It is
estimated that four months (17 weeks of ﬁve working days per week) will be
required for the job. Compare the two sites in terms of their ﬁxed, variable, and
total costs. Assume that the cost of the return trip is negligible. Which is the
better site? For the selected site, how many cubic yards of paving material does
the contractor have to deliver before starting to make a proﬁt if paid $12 per
cubic yard delivered to the job location?
Solution
The ﬁxed and variable costs for this job are indicated in the table shown next. Site
rental, setup, and removal costs (and the cost of the ﬂagperson at Site B) would
be constant for the total job, but the hauling cost would vary in total amount
with the distance and thus with the total output quantity of yd3-miles (x).

$503,250
Site B, which has the larger ﬁxed costs, has the smaller total cost for the
job. Note that the extra ﬁxed costs of Site B are being “traded off” for reduced
variable costs at this site.
The contractor will begin to make a proﬁt at the point where total revenue
equals total cost as a function of the cubic yards of asphalt pavement mix
delivered. Based on Site B, we have
3($2.75) = $8.25 in variable cost per yd3 delivered
Total cost = total revenue
$90,750 + $8.25x = $12x
x = 24,200 yd3 delivered.
Therefore, by using Site B, the contractor will begin to make a proﬁt on the
job after delivering 24,200 cubic yards of material.

SECTION 2.1 / COST TERMINOLOGY
23
2.1.2
Direct, Indirect, and Standard Costs
These frequently encountered cost terms involve most of the cost elements that
also ﬁt into the previous overlapping categories of ﬁxed and variable costs. Direct
costs are costs that can be reasonably measured and allocated to a speciﬁc output
or work activity. The labor and material costs directly associated with a product,
service, or construction activity are direct costs. For example, the materials needed
to make a pair of scissors would be a direct cost.
Indirect costs are costs that are difﬁcult to allocate to a speciﬁc output or work
activity. Normally, they are costs allocated through a selected formula (such as
proportional to direct labor hours, direct labor dollars, or direct material dollars)
to the outputs or work activities. For example, the costs of common tools, general
supplies, and equipment maintenance in a plant are treated as indirect costs.
Overhead consists of plant operating costs that are not direct labor or direct
material costs. In this book, the terms indirect costs, overhead, and burden are
used interchangeably. Examples of overhead include electricity, general repairs,
property taxes, and supervision. Administrative and selling expenses are usually
added to direct costs and overhead costs to arrive at a unit selling price for a product
or service. (Appendix 2-A provides a more detailed discussion of cost accounting
principles.)
Standard costs are planned costs per unit of output that are established in
advance of actual production or service delivery. They are developed from
anticipated direct labor hours, materials, and overhead categories (with their
established costs per unit). Because total overhead costs are associated with a certain
level of production, this is an important condition that should be remembered when
dealing with standard cost data (for example, see Section 2.4.2). Standard costs play
an important role in cost control and other management functions. Some typical
uses are the following:
1. Estimating future manufacturing costs
2. Measuring operating performance by comparing actual cost per unit with the
standard unit cost
3. Preparing bids on products or services requested by customers
4. Establishing the value of work in process and ﬁnished inventories
2.1.3
Cash Cost versus Book Cost
A cost that involves payment of cash is called a cash cost (and results in a cash ﬂow)
to distinguish it from one that does not involve a cash transaction and is reﬂected
in the accounting system as a noncash cost. This noncash cost is often referred to as a
book cost. Cash costs are estimated from the perspective established for the analysis
(Principle 3, Section 1.2) and are the future expenses incurred for the alternatives
being analyzed. Book costs are costs that do not involve cash payments but rather
represent the recovery of past expenditures over a ﬁxed period of time. The most
common example of book cost is the depreciation charged for the use of assets such
as plant and equipment. In engineering economic analysis, only those costs that
are cash ﬂows or potential cash ﬂows from the deﬁned perspective for the analysis
need to be considered. Depreciation, for example, is not a cash ﬂow and is important in

24
CHAPTER 2 / COST CONCEPTS AND DESIGN ECONOMICS
an analysis only because it affects income taxes, which are cash ﬂows. We discuss
the topics of depreciation and income taxes in Chapter 7.
2.1.4
Sunk Cost
A sunk cost is one that has occurred in the past and has no relevance to estimates of
future costs and revenues related to an alternative course of action. Thus, a sunk
cost is common to all alternatives, is not part of the future (prospective) cash ﬂows,
and can be disregarded in an engineering economic analysis. For instance, sunk
costs are nonrefundable cash outlays, such as earnest money on a house or money
spent on a passport.
The concept of sunk cost is illustrated in the next simple example. Suppose
that Joe College ﬁnds a motorcycle he likes and pays $40 as a down payment,
which will be applied to the $1,300 purchase price, but which must be forfeited if
he decides not to take the cycle. Over the weekend, Joe ﬁnds another motorcycle
he considers equally desirable for a purchase price of $1,230. For the purpose of
deciding which cycle to purchase, the $40 is a sunk cost and thus would not enter
into the decision, except that it lowers the remaining cost of the ﬁrst cycle. The
decision then is between paying an additional $1,260 ($1,300 −$40) for the ﬁrst
motorcycle versus $1,230 for the second motorcycle.
In summary, sunk costs are irretrievable consequences of past decisions and
therefore are irrelevant in the analysis and comparison of alternatives that affect the
future. Even though it is sometimes emotionally difﬁcult to do, sunk costs should
be ignored, except possibly to the extent that their existence assists you to anticipate
better what will happen in the future.
EXAMPLE 2-2
Sunk Costs in Replacement Analysis
A classic example of sunk cost involves the replacement of assets. Suppose that
your ﬁrm is considering the replacement of a piece of equipment. It originally
cost $50,000, is presently shown on the company records with a value of $20,000,
and can be sold for an estimated $5,000. For purposes of replacement analysis,
the $50,000 is a sunk cost. However, one view is that the sunk cost should be
considered as the difference between the value shown in the company records
and the present realizable selling price. According to this viewpoint, the sunk
cost is $20,000 minus $5,000, or $15,000. Neither the $50,000 nor the $15,000,
however, should be considered in an engineering economic analysis, except for
themannerinwhichthe$15,000mayaffectincometaxes, whichwillbediscussed
in Chapter 9.
2.1.5
Opportunity Cost
An opportunity cost is incurred because of the use of limited resources, such that the
opportunity to use those resources to monetary advantage in an alternative use is
foregone. Thus, it is the cost of the best rejected (i.e., foregone) opportunity and is
often hidden or implied.

SECTION 2.1 / COST TERMINOLOGY
25
Consider a student who could earn $20,000 for working during a year, but
chooses instead to go to school for a year and spend $5,000 to do so. The opportunity
cost of going to school for that year is $25,000: $5,000 cash outlay and $20,000 for
income foregone. (This ﬁgure neglects the inﬂuence of income taxes and assumes
that the student has no earning capability while in school.)
EXAMPLE 2-3
Opportunity Cost in Replacement Analysis
The concept of an opportunity cost is often encountered in analyzing the
replacement of a piece of equipment or other capital asset. Let us reconsider
Example 2-2, in which your ﬁrm considered the replacement of an existing piece
of equipment that originally cost $50,000, is presently shown on the company
records with a value of $20,000, but has a present market value of only $5,000.
For purposes of an engineering economic analysis of whether to replace the
equipment, the present investment in that equipment should be considered as
$5,000, because, by keeping the equipment, the ﬁrm is giving up the opportunity
to obtain $5,000 from its disposal. Thus, the $5,000 immediate selling price is
really the investment cost of not replacing the equipment and is based on the
opportunity cost concept.
2.1.6
Life-Cycle Cost
In engineering practice, the term life-cycle cost is often encountered. This term refers
to a summation of all the costs related to a product, structure, system, or service
during its life span. The life cycle is illustrated in Figure 2-1. The life cycle begins
with identiﬁcation of the economic need or want (the requirement) and ends with
retirement and disposal activities. It is a time horizon that must be deﬁned in
the context of the speciﬁc situation—whether it is a highway bridge, a jet engine
for commercial aircraft, or an automated ﬂexible manufacturing cell for a factory.
The end of the life cycle may be projected on a functional or an economic basis.
For example, the amount of time that a structure or piece of equipment is able to
perform economically may be shorter than that permitted by its physical capability.
Changes in the design efﬁciency of a boiler illustrate this situation. The old boiler
may be able to produce the steam required, but not economically enough for the
intended use.
The life cycle may be divided into two general time periods: the acquisition
phase and the operation phase. As shown in Figure 2-1, each of these phases is
further subdivided into interrelated but different activity periods.
The acquisition phase begins with an analysis of the economic need or want—
the analysis necessary to make explicit the requirement for the product, structure,
system, or service. Then, with the requirement explicitly deﬁned, the other
activities in the acquisition phase can proceed in a logical sequence. The conceptual
design activities translate the deﬁned technical and operational requirements
into a preferred preliminary design. Included in these activities are development
of the feasible alternatives and engineering economic analyses to assist in the
selection of the preferred preliminary design. Also, advanced development and

prototype-testing activities to support the preliminary design work occur during
this period.
The next group of activities in the acquisition phase involves detailed design
and planning for production or construction. This step is followed by the activities
necessary to prepare, acquire, and make ready for operation the facilities and
other resources needed. Again, engineering economy studies are an essential part of
the design process to analyze and compare alternatives and to assist in determining the
ﬁnal detailed design.
In the operation phase, the production, delivery, or construction of the end
item(s) or service and their operation or customer use occur. This phase ends with
retirement from active operation or use and, often, disposal of the physical assets
involved. The priorities for engineering economy studies during the operation
phase are (1) achieving efﬁcient and effective support to operations, (2) determining
whether (and when) replacement of assets should occur, and (3) projecting the
timing of retirement and disposal activities.

SECTION 2.2 / THE GENERAL ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT
27
Figure 2-1 shows relative cost proﬁles for the life cycle. The greatest potential
for achieving life-cycle cost savings is early in the acquisition phase. How much of
the life-cycle costs for a product (for example) can be saved is dependent on many
factors. However, effective engineering design and economic analysis during this
phase are critical in maximizing potential savings.
The cumulative committed life-cycle cost curve increases rapidly during the
acquisition phase. In general, approximately 80% of life-cycle costs are “locked
in” at the end of this phase by the decisions made during requirements analysis
and preliminary and detailed design. In contrast, as reﬂected by the cumulative
life-cycle cost curve, only about 20% of actual costs occur during the acquisition
phase, with about 80% being incurred during the operation phase.
Thus, one purpose of the life-cycle concept is to make explicit the interrelated
effects of costs over the total life span for a product. An objective of the design
process is to minimize the life-cycle cost—while meeting other performance
requirements—by making the right trade-offs between prospective costs during
the acquisition phase and those during the operation phase.
The cost elements of the life cycle that need to be considered will vary with
the situation. Because of their common use, however, several basic life-cycle cost
categories will now be deﬁned.
The investment cost is the capital required for most of the activities in the
acquisition phase. In simple cases, such as acquiring speciﬁc equipment, an
investment cost may be incurred as a single expenditure. On a large, complex
construction project, however, a series of expenditures over an extended period
could be incurred. This cost is also called a capital investment.
Operation and maintenance cost (O&M) includes many of the recurring annual
expense items associated with the operation phase of the life cycle. The direct and
indirect costs of operation associated with the ﬁve primary resource areas—people,
machines, materials, energy, and information—are a major part of the costs in this
category.
Disposal cost includes those nonrecurring costs of shutting down the operation
and the retirement and disposal of assets at the end of the life cycle. Normally,
costs associated with personnel, materials, transportation, and one-time special
activities can be expected. These costs will be offset in some instances by receipts
from the sale of assets with remaining market value. Aclassic example of a disposal
cost is that associated with cleaning up a site where a chemical processing plant
had been located.
2.2
The General Economic Environment
There are numerous general economic concepts that must be taken into account in
engineering studies. In broad terms, economics deals with the interactions between
people and wealth, and engineering is concerned with the cost-effective use of

28
CHAPTER 2 / COST CONCEPTS AND DESIGN ECONOMICS
scientiﬁc knowledge to beneﬁt humankind. This section introduces some of these
basic economic concepts and indicates how they may be factors for consideration
in engineering studies and managerial decisions.
2.2.1
Consumer and Producer Goods and Services
The goods and services that are produced and utilized may be divided conveniently
into two classes. Consumer goods and services are those products or services that
are directly used by people to satisfy their wants. Food, clothing, homes, cars,
television sets, haircuts, opera, and medical services are examples. The providers
of consumer goods and services must be aware of, and are subject to, the changing
wants of the people to whom their products are sold.
Producer goods and services are used to produce consumer goods and services or
other producer goods. Machine tools, factory buildings, buses, and farm machinery
are examples. The amount of producer goods needed is determined indirectly by
the amount of consumer goods or services that are demanded by people. However,
because the relationship is much less direct than for consumer goods and services,
the demand for and production of producer goods may greatly precede or lag
behind the demand for the consumer goods that they will produce.
2.2.2
Measures of Economic Worth
Goods and services are produced and desired because they have utility—the
power to satisfy human wants and needs. Thus, they may be used or consumed
directly, or they may be used to produce other goods or services. Utility is most
commonly measured in terms of value, expressed in some medium of exchange
as the price that must be paid to obtain the particular item.
Much of our business activity, including engineering, focuses on increasing
the utility (value) of materials and products by changing their form or location.
Thus, iron ore, worth only a few dollars per ton, signiﬁcantly increases in value
by being processed, combined with suitable alloying elements, and converted into
razor blades. Similarly, snow, worth almost nothing when found high in distant
mountains, becomes quite valuable when it is delivered in melted form several
hundred miles away to dry southern California.
2.2.3
Necessities, Luxuries, and Price Demand
Goods and services may be divided into two types: necessities and luxuries.
Obviously, these terms are relative, because, for most goods and services, what one
person considers a necessity may be considered a luxury by another. For example,
a person living in one community may ﬁnd that an automobile is a necessity to get
to and from work. If the same person lived and worked in a different city, adequate
public transportation might be available, and an automobile would be a luxury. For
all goods and services, there is a relationship between the price that must be paid

SECTION 2.2 / THE GENERAL ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT

and the quantity that will be demanded or purchased. This general relationship is
depicted in Figure 2-2. As the selling price per unit (p) is increased, there will be
less demand (D) for the product, and as the selling price is decreased, the demand
will increase. The relationship between price and demand can be expressed as the
linear function
p = a −bD
for 0 ≤D ≤a
b, and a > 0, b > 0,
(2-1)
where a is the intercept on the price axis and −b is the slope. Thus, b is the amount
by which demand increases for each unit decrease in p. Both a and b are constants.
It follows, of course, that
D = a −p
b
(b ̸= 0).
(2-2)
2.2.4
Competition
Because economic laws are general statements regarding the interaction of people
and wealth, they are affected by the economic environment in which people and
wealth exist. Most general economic principles are stated for situations in which
perfect competition exists.
Perfect competition occurs in a situation in which any given product is supplied
by a large number of vendors and there is no restriction on additional suppliers
entering the market. Under such conditions, there is assurance of complete freedom
on the part of both buyer and seller. Perfect competition may never occur in actual
practice, because of a multitude of factors that impose some degree of limitation
upon the actions of buyers or sellers, or both. However, with conditions of perfect
competition assumed, it is easier to formulate general economic laws.

30
CHAPTER 2 / COST CONCEPTS AND DESIGN ECONOMICS
Monopoly is at the opposite pole from perfect competition. A perfect monopoly
exists when a unique product or service is only available from a single supplier
and that vendor can prevent the entry of all others into the market. Under
such conditions, the buyer is at the complete mercy of the supplier in terms
of the availability and price of the product. Perfect monopolies rarely occur in
practice, because (1) few products are so unique that substitutes cannot be used
satisfactorily, and (2) governmental regulations prohibit monopolies if they are
unduly restrictive.
2.2.5
The Total Revenue Function
The total revenue, TR, that will result from a business venture during a given period
is the product of the selling price per unit, p, and the number of units sold, D.
Thus,
TR = price × demand = p · D.
(2-3)
If the relationship between price and demand as given in Equation (2-1) is used,
TR = (a −bD)D = aD −bD2
for 0 ≤D ≤a
b and a > 0, b > 0.
(2-4)
The relationship between total revenue and demand for the condition expressed
in Equation (2-4) may be represented by the curve shown in Figure 2-3. From
calculus, the demand, ˆD, that will produce maximum total revenue can be obtained
by solving
dTR
dD = a −2bD = 0.

Thus,∗

(2-6)
It must be emphasized that, because of cost–volume relationships (discussed
in the next section), most businesses would not obtain maximum proﬁts by maximizing
revenue. Accordingly, the cost–volume relationship must be considered and related
to revenue, because cost reductions provide a key motivation for many engineering
process improvements.
2.2.6
Cost, Volume, and Breakeven Point Relationships
Fixed costs remain constant over a wide range of activities, but variable costs vary
in total with the volume of output (Section 2.1.1). Thus, at any demand D, total
cost is
CT = CF + CV,
(2-7)
where CF and CV denote ﬁxed and variable costs, respectively. For the linear
relationship assumed here,
CV = cv · D,
(2-8)
where cv is the variable cost per unit. In this section, we consider two scenarios for
ﬁnding breakeven points. In the ﬁrst scenario, demand is a function of price. The
second scenario assumes that price and demand are independent of each other.
Scenario 1
When total revenue, as depicted in Figure 2-3, and total cost, as
given by Equations (2-7) and (2-8), are combined, the typical results as a function
of demand are depicted in Figure 2-4. At breakeven point D′
1, total revenue is equal

Also, recall that in cost-minimization problems, a positively signed second derivative is necessary to guarantee a
minimum-value optimal cost solution.

32
CHAPTER 2 / COST CONCEPTS AND DESIGN ECONOMICS
to total cost, and an increase in demand will result in a proﬁt for the operation.
Then at optimal demand, D∗, proﬁt is maximized [Equation (2-10)]. At breakeven
point D′
2, total revenue and total cost are again equal, but additional volume will
result in an operating loss instead of a proﬁt. Obviously, the conditions for which
breakeven and maximum proﬁt occur are our primary interest. First, at any volume
(demand), D,
Proﬁt (loss) = total revenue −total costs
= (aD −bD2) −(CF + cvD)
= −bD2 + (a −cv)D −CF
for 0 ≤D ≤a
b and a > 0, b > 0.
(2-9)
In order for a proﬁt to occur, based on Equation (2-9), and to achieve the typical
results depicted in Figure 2-4, two conditions must be met:
1. (a −cv) > 0; that is, the price per unit that will result in no demand has to be
greater than the variable cost per unit. (This avoids negative demand.)
2. Total revenue (TR) must exceed total cost (CT) for the period involved.
If these conditions are met, we can ﬁnd the optimal demand at which maximum
proﬁt will occur by taking the ﬁrst derivative of Equation (2-9) with respect to D
and setting it equal to zero:
d(proﬁt)
dD
= a −cv −2bD = 0.
The optimal value of D that maximizes proﬁt is
D∗= a −cv
2b
.
(2-10)
To ensure that we have maximized proﬁt (rather than minimized it), the sign of the
second derivative must be negative. Checking this, we ﬁnd that
d2(proﬁt)
dD2
= −2b,
which will be negative for b > 0 (as speciﬁed earlier).
An economic breakeven point for an operation occurs when total revenue
equals total cost. Then for total revenue and total cost, as used in the development
of Equations (2-9) and (2-10) and at any demand D,
Total revenue = total cost
(breakeven point)
aD −bD2 = CF + cvD
−bD2 + (a −cv)D −CF = 0.
(2-11)

SECTION 2.2 / THE GENERAL ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT
33
Because Equation (2-11) is a quadratic equation with one unknown (D), we can
solve for the breakeven points D′
1 and D′
2 (the roots of the equation):∗
D′ = −(a −cv) ± [(a −cv)2 −4(−b)(−CF)]1/2
2(−b)
.
(2-12)
Withtheconditionsforaproﬁtsatisﬁed[Equation(2-9)], thequantityinthebrackets
of the numerator (the discriminant) in Equation (2-12) will be greater than zero. This
will ensure that D′
1 and D′
2 have real positive, unequal values.
EXAMPLE 2-4
Optimal Demand When Demand Is a Function of Price
A company produces an electronic timing switch that is used in consumer and
commercial products. The ﬁxed cost (CF) is $73,000 per month, and the variable
cost (cv) is $83 per unit. The selling price per unit is p = $180 −0.02(D), based
on Equation (2-1). For this situation,
(a) determine the optimal volume for this product and conﬁrm that a proﬁt
occurs (instead of a loss) at this demand.
(b) ﬁnd the volumes at which breakeven occurs; that is, what is the range of
proﬁtable demand? Solve by hand and by spreadsheet.
Solution by Hand
(a) D∗= a −cv
2b
= $180 −$83
2(0.02)
= 2,425 units per month [from Equation (2-10)].
Is (a −cv) > 0?
($180 −$83) = $97,
which is greater than 0.
And is (total revenue −total cost) > 0 for D∗= 2,425 units per month?
[$180(2,425) −0.02(2,425)2] −[$73,000 + $83(2,425)] = $44,612
A demand of D∗= 2,425 units per month results in a maximum proﬁt of
$44,612 per month. Notice that the second derivative is negative (−0.04).
(b) Total revenue = total cost

= 3,918 units per month.
Thus, the range of proﬁtable demand is 932–3,918 units per month.
Spreadsheet Solution
Figure 2-5(a) displays the spreadsheet solution for this problem. This spread-
sheet calculates proﬁt for a range of demand values (shown in column A). For
a speciﬁc value of demand, price per unit is calculated in column B by using
Equation (2-1) and Total Revenue is simply demand × price. Total Expense is
computed by using Equations (2-7) and (2-8). Finally, Proﬁt (column E) is then
Total Revenue −Total Expense.
A quick inspection of the Proﬁt column gives us an idea of the optimal
demand value as well as the breakeven points. Note that proﬁt steadily increases
as demand increases to 2,500 units per month and then begins to drop off. This
tells us that the optimal demand value lies in the range of 2,250 to 2,750 units
per month. Amore speciﬁc value can be obtained by changing the Demand Start
point value in cell E1 and the Demand Increment value in cell E2. For example,
if the value of cell E1 is set to 2,250 and the increment in cell E2 is set to 10,
the optimal demand value is shown to be between 2,420 and 2,430 units per
month.
The breakeven points lie within the ranges 750–1,000 units per month and
3,750–4,000 units per month, as indicated by the change in sign of proﬁt. Again,
by changing the values in cells E1 and E2, we can obtain more exact values of
the breakeven points.
Figure 2-5(b) is a graphical display of the Total Revenue, Total Expense,
and Proﬁt functions for the range of demand values given in column A of
Figure 2-5(a). This graph enables us to see how proﬁt changes as demand
increases. The optimal demand value (maximum point of the proﬁt curve)
appears to be around 2,500 units per month.
Figure 2-5(b) is also a graphical representation of the breakeven points.
By graphing the total revenue and total cost curves separately, we can easily
identify the breakeven points (the intersection of these two functions). From the
graph, the range of proﬁtable demand is approximately 1,000 to 4,000 units per
month. Notice also that, at these demand values, the proﬁt curve crosses the
x-axis ($0).

(continued)
The power of the spreadsheet in this example is the ease with which graphical
displays can be generated to support your analysis. Remember, a picture really
can be worth a thousand words. Spreadsheets also facilitate sensitivity analysis
(to be discussed more fully in Chapter 11). For example, what is the impact on
the optimal demand value and breakeven points if variable costs are reduced
by 10% per unit? (The new optimal demand value is increased to 2,632 units per
month, and the range of proﬁtable demand is widened to 822 to 4,443 units per
month.)
Scenario 2
When the price per unit (p) for a product or service can be
represented more simply as being independent of demand [versus being a linear
function of demand, as assumed in Equation (2-1)] and is greater than the variable
cost per unit (cv), a single breakeven point results. Then, under the assumption that
demand is immediately met, total revenue (TR) = p · D. If the linear relationship
for costs in Equations (2-7) and (2-8) is also used in the model, the typical situation
is depicted in Figure 2-6. This scenario is typiﬁed by the Airbus example presented
at the beginning of the chapter.

Breakeven Point When Price Is Independent of Demand
An engineering consulting ﬁrm measures its output in a standard service hour
unit, which is a function of the personnel grade levels in the professional staff.
The variable cost (cv) is $62 per standard service hour. The charge-out rate
[i.e., selling price (p)] is $85.56 per hour. The maximum output of the ﬁrm is
160,000 hours per year, and its ﬁxed cost (CF) is $2,024,000 per year. For this
ﬁrm,
(a) what is the breakeven point in standard service hours and in percentage of
total capacity?
(b) what is the percentage reduction in the breakeven point (sensitivity) if ﬁxed
costs are reduced 10%; if variable cost per hour is reduced 10%; and if the
selling price per unit is increased by 10%?
Solution
(a)
Total revenue = total cost
(breakeven point)
pD′ = CF + cvD′
D′ =
CF
(p −cv),
(2-13)
and
D′ =
$2,024,000
($85.56 −$62) = 85,908 hours per year
D′ = 85,908
160,000 = 0.537,
or 53.7% of capacity.

38
CHAPTER 2 / COST CONCEPTS AND DESIGN ECONOMICS
(b) A 10% reduction in CF gives
D′ = 0.9($2,024,000)
($85.56 −$62) = 77,318 hours per year
and
85,908 −77,318
85,908
= 0.10,
or a 10% reduction in D′.
A 10% reduction in cv gives
D′ =
$2,024,000
[$85.56 −0.9($62)] = 68,011 hours per year
and
85,908 −68,011
85,908
= 0.208,
or a 20.8% reduction in D′.
A 10% increase in p gives
D′ =
$2,024,000
[1.1($85.56) −$62] = 63,021 hours per year
and
85,908 −63,021
85,908
= 0.266,
or a 26.6% reduction in D′.
Thus, the breakeven point is more sensitive to a reduction in variable cost per
hour than to the same percentage reduction in the ﬁxed cost. Furthermore,
notice that the breakeven point in this example is highly sensitive to the selling
price per unit, p.
Market competition often creates pressure to lower the breakeven point of
an operation; the lower the breakeven point, the less likely that a loss will
occur during market ﬂuctuations. Also, if the selling price remains constant
(or increases), a larger proﬁt will be achieved at any level of operation above the
reduced breakeven point.
2.3
Cost-Driven Design Optimization
As discussed in Section 2.1.6, engineers must maintain a life-cycle (i.e., “cradle
to grave”) viewpoint as they design products, processes, and services. Such a
complete perspective ensures that engineers consider initial investment costs,

SECTION 2.3 / COST-DRIVEN DESIGN OPTIMIZATION 39
operation and maintenance expenses and other annual expenses in later years,
and environmental and social consequences over the life of their designs. In fact, a
movement called Design for the Environment (DFE), or “green engineering,” has
prevention of waste, improved materials selection, and reuse and recycling of
resources among its goals. Designing for energy conservation, for example, is
a subset of green engineering. Another example is the design of an automobile
bumper that can be easily recycled. As you can see, engineering design is an
economically driven art.
Examples of cost minimization through effective design are plentiful in the
practice of engineering. Consider the design of a heat exchanger in which tube
material and conﬁguration affect cost and dissipation of heat. The problems in
this section designated as “cost-driven design optimization” are simple design
models intended to illustrate the importance of cost in the design process. These
problems show the procedure for determining an optimal design, using cost
concepts. We will consider discrete and continuous optimization problems that
involve a single design variable, X. This variable is also called a primary cost driver,
and knowledge of its behavior may allow a designer to account for a large portion
of total cost behavior.
For cost-driven design optimization problems,
the two main tasks are
as follows:
1. Determine the optimal value for a certain alternative’s design variable. For
example, what velocity of an aircraft minimizes the total annual costs of owning
and operating the aircraft?
2. Selectthebestalternative, eachwithitsownuniquevalueforthedesignvariable.
For example, what insulation thickness is best for a home in Virginia: R11, R19,
R30, or R38?
In general, the cost models developed in these problems consist of three types of
costs:
1. ﬁxed cost(s)
2. cost(s) that vary directly with the design variable
3. cost(s) that vary indirectly with the design variable
A simpliﬁed format of a cost model with one design variable is
Cost = aX + b
X + k,
(2-14)
where
a is a parameter that represents the directly varying cost(s),
b is a parameter that represents the indirectly varying cost(s),
k is a parameter that represents the ﬁxed cost(s), and
X represents the design variable in question (e.g., weight or velocity).

40
CHAPTER 2 / COST CONCEPTS AND DESIGN ECONOMICS
In a particular problem, the parameters a, b, and k may actually represent the sum
of a group of costs in that category, and the design variable may be raised to some
power for either directly or indirectly varying costs.∗
The following steps outline a general approach for optimizing a design with
respect to cost:
1. Identify the design variable that is the primary cost driver (e.g., pipe diameter
or insulation thickness).
2. Write an expression for the cost model in terms of the design variable.
3. Set the ﬁrst derivative of the cost model with respect to the continuous
design variable equal to zero. For discrete design variables, compute the value
of the cost model for each discrete value over a selected range of potential
values.
4. Solve the equation found in Step 3 for the optimum value of the continuous
design variable.† For discrete design variables, the optimum value has the
minimum cost value found in Step 3. This method is analogous to taking the
ﬁrst derivative for a continuous design variable and setting it equal to zero to
determine an optimal value.
5. For continuous design variables,
use the second derivative of the cost
model with respect to the design variable to determine whether the
optimum value found in Step 4 corresponds to a global maximum or
minimum.
EXAMPLE 2-6
How Fast Should the Airplane Fly?
The cost of operating a jet-powered commercial (passenger-carrying) airplane
varies as the three-halves (3/2) power of its velocity; speciﬁcally, CO = knv3/2,
where n is the trip length in miles, k is a constant of proportionality, and v is
velocity in miles per hour. It is known that at 400 miles per hour, the average
cost of operation is $300 per mile. The company that owns the aircraft wants
to minimize the cost of operation, but that cost must be balanced against
the cost of the passengers’ time (CC), which has been set at $300,000 per
hour.
(a) At what velocity should the trip be planned to minimize the total cost, which
is the sum of the cost of operating the airplane and the cost of passengers’
time?
(b) How do you know that your answer for the problem in Part (a) minimizes
the total cost?
∗A more general model is the following: Cost = k + ax + b1xe1 + b2xe2 + · · · , where e1 = −1 reﬂects costs that vary
inversely with X, e2 = 2 indicates costs that vary as the square of X, and so forth.
† If multiple optima (stationary points) are found in Step 4, ﬁnding the global optimum value of the design variable
will require a little more effort. One approach is to systematically use each root in the second derivative equation and
assign each point as a maximum or a minimum based on the sign of the second derivative. A second approach would
be to use each root in the objective function and see which point best satisﬁes the cost function.

days per year. Here, 65◦F is assumed to be the average inside temperature and
46◦F is the average outside temperature each day.
Consider a 2,400-ft2 single-story house in Blacksburg. The typical annual
space-heating load for this size of a house is 100 × 106 Btu. That is, with no
insulation in the attic, we lose about 100 × 106 Btu per year.∗Common sense
dictates that the “no insulation” alternative is not attractive and is to be avoided.
With insulation in the attic, the amount of heat lost each year will be reduced.
The value of energy savings that results from adding insulation and reducing
heat loss is dependent on what type of residential heating furnace is installed.
For this example, we assume that an electrical resistance furnace is installed by
the builder, and its efﬁciency is near 100%.
Now we’re in a position to answer the following question: What amount of
insulation is most economical? An additional piece of data we need involves the
cost of electricity, which is $0.074 per kWh. This can be converted to dollars per
106 Btu as follows (1 kWh = 3,413 Btu):

Caution
This conclusion may change when we consider the time value of money (i.e., an
interest rate greater than zero) in Chapter 4. In such a case, it will not necessarily
be true that adding more and more insulation is the optimal course of action.

Present Economy Studies
When alternatives for accomplishing a speciﬁc task are being compared over one
yearorlessandtheinﬂuenceoftimeonmoneycanbeignored, engineeringeconomic
analyses are referred to as present economy studies. Several situations involving
present economy studies are illustrated in this section. The rules, or criteria, shown
next will be used to select the preferred alternative when defect-free output (yield)
is variable or constant among the alternatives being considered.

44
CHAPTER 2 / COST CONCEPTS AND DESIGN ECONOMICS
RULE 1:
When revenues and other economic beneﬁts are present and vary among
alternatives, choose the alternative that maximizes overall proﬁtability based on
the number of defect-free units of a product or service produced.
RULE 2:
Whenrevenuesandother economic beneﬁts are not present or are constant among
all alternatives, consider only the costs and select the alternative that minimizes
total cost per defect-free unit of product or service output.
2.4.1
Total Cost in Material Selection
In many cases, economic selection among materials cannot be based solely on the
costs of materials. Frequently, a change in materials will affect the design and
processing costs, and shipping costs may also be altered.
EXAMPLE 2-8
Choosing the Most Economic Material for a Part
A good example of this situation is illustrated by a part for which annual
demand is 100,000 units. The part is produced on a high-speed turret lathe,
using 1112 screw-machine steel costing $0.30 per pound. Astudy was conducted
to determine whether it might be cheaper to use brass screw stock, costing $1.40
per pound. Because the weight of steel required per piece was 0.0353 pounds
and that of brass was 0.0384 pounds, the material cost per piece was $0.0106
for steel and $0.0538 for brass. However, when the manufacturing engineering
department was consulted, it was found that, although 57.1 defect-free parts
per hour were being produced by using steel, the output would be 102.9 defect-
free parts per hour if brass were used. Which material should be used for this
part?
Solution
The machine attendant is paid $15.00 per hour, and the variable (i.e., traceable)
overhead costs for the turret lathe are estimated to be $10.00 per hour. Thus, the
total cost comparison for the two materials is as follows:
1112 Steel
Brass
Material
$0.30 × 0.0353 = $0.0106
$1.40 × 0.0384 = $0.0538
Labor
$15.00/57.1
= 0.2627
$15.00/102.9
= 0.1458
Variable overhead
$10.00/57.1
= 0.1751
$10.00/102.9
= 0.0972
Total cost per piece
$0.4484
$0.2968
Saving per piece by use of brass = $0.4484 −$0.2968 = $0.1516

SECTION 2.4 / PRESENT ECONOMY STUDIES
45
Because 100,000 parts are made each year, revenues are constant across the
alternatives. Rule 2 would select brass, and its use will produce a savings of
$151.60 per thousand (a total of $15,160 for the year). It is also clear that costs
other than the cost of material (such as labor and overhead) were important in
the study.
Care should be taken in making economic selections between materials to
ensure that any differences in shipping costs, yields, or resulting scrap are taken
into account. Commonly, alternative materials do not come in the same stock sizes,
such as sheet sizes and bar lengths. This may considerably affect the yield obtained
from a given weight of material. Similarly, the resulting scrap may differ for various
materials.
In addition to deciding what material a product should be made of, there are
often alternative methods or machines that can be used to produce the product,
which, in turn, can impact processing costs. Processing times may vary with the
machine selected, as may the product yield. As illustrated in Example 2-9, these
considerations can have important economic implications.
EXAMPLE 2-9
Choosing the Most Economical Machine for Production
Two currently owned machines are being considered for the production of a part.
The capital investment associated with the machines is about the same and can
be ignored for purposes of this example. The important differences between the
machines are their production capacities (production rate×available production
hours) and their reject rates (percentage of parts produced that cannot be sold).
Consider the following table:
Machine A
Machine B
Production rate
100 parts/hour
130 parts/hour
Hours available for production
7 hours/day
6 hours/day
Percent parts rejected
3%
10%
The material cost is $6.00 per part, and all defect-free parts produced can
be sold for $12 each. (Rejected parts have negligible scrap value.) For either
machine, the operator cost is $15.00 per hour and the variable overhead rate for
traceable costs is $5.00 per hour.
(a) Assume that the daily demand for this part is large enough that all defect-free
parts can be sold. Which machine should be selected?
(b) What would the percent of parts rejected have to be for Machine B to be as
proﬁtable as Machine A?

46
CHAPTER 2 / COST CONCEPTS AND DESIGN ECONOMICS
Solution
(a) Rule 1 applies in this situation because total daily revenues (selling price per
part times the number of parts sold per day) and total daily costs will vary
depending on the machine chosen. Therefore, we should select the machine
that will maximize the proﬁt per day:
Proﬁt per day = Revenue per day −Cost per day
= (Production rate)(Production hours)($12/part)
× [1 −(%rejected/100)]
−(Production rate)(Production hours)($6/part)
−(Production hours)($15/hour + $5/hour).

= $3,624 per day.
Therefore, select Machine A to maximize proﬁt per day.
(b) To ﬁnd the breakeven percent of parts rejected, X, for Machine B, set the
proﬁt per day of Machine A equal to the proﬁt per day of Machine B, and
solve for X:
$3,808/day =
!130 parts

" !6 hours

(1 −X) −

.
Thus, X = 0.08, so the percent of parts rejected for Machine B can be no
higher than 8% for it to be as proﬁtable as Machine A.

In the short run, say, one year or less, a company may consider producing an item
in-house even though the item can be purchased (outsourced) from a supplier at a
price lower than the company’s standard production costs. (See Section 2.1.2.) This
could occur if (1) direct, indirect, and overhead costs are incurred regardless of
whether the item is purchased from an outside supplier and (2) the incremental cost
of producing an item in the short run is less than the supplier’s price. Therefore,
the relevant short-run costs of make versus purchase decisions are the incremental
costs incurred and the opportunity costs of the resources involved.
Opportunity costs may become signiﬁcant when in-house manufacture of
an item causes other production opportunities to be forgone (often because of
insufﬁcient capacity). But in the long run, capital investments in additional
manufacturing plant and capacity are often feasible alternatives to outsourcing.
(Much of this book is concerned with evaluating the economic worthiness of
proposed capital investments.) Because engineering economy often deals with
changes to existing operations, standard costs may not be too useful in make-versus-
purchase studies. In fact, if they are used, standard costs can lead to uneconomical
decisions. Example 2-10 illustrates the correct procedure to follow in performing
make-versus-purchase studies based on incremental costs.
EXAMPLE 2-10
To Produce or Not to Produce?−−That Is the Question
Amanufacturing plant consists of three departments: A, B, and C. Department A
occupies 100 square meters in one corner of the plant. Product X is one of several
products being produced in Department A. The daily production of Product X
is 576 pieces. The cost accounting records show the following average daily
production costs for Product X:
Direct labor
(1 operator working 4 hours per day
at $22.50/hr, including fringe beneﬁts,
plus a part-time foreman at $30 per day)
$120.00
Direct material
86.40
Overhead
(at $0.82 per square meter of ﬂoor area)
82.00
Total cost per day =
$288.40
The department foreman has recently learned about an outside company that
sells Product X at $0.35 per piece. Accordingly, the foreman ﬁgured a cost per day
of$0.35(576) = $201.60, resultinginadailysavingsof$288.40−$201.60 = $86.80.
Therefore, a proposal was submitted to the plant manager for shutting down
the production line of Product X and buying it from the outside company.
∗Much interest has been shown in outsourcing decisions. For example, see P. Chalos, “Costing, Control, and Strategic
Analysis in Outsourcing Decisions,” Journal of Cost Management, 8, no. 4 (Winter 1995): pp. 31–37.

CHAPTER 2 / COST CONCEPTS AND DESIGN ECONOMICS
However, after examining each component separately, the plant manager
decided not to accept the foreman’s proposal based on the unit cost of
Product X:
1. Direct labor: Because the foreman was supervising the manufacture of other
products in Department A in addition to Product X, the only possible savings
in labor would occur if the operator working 4 hours per day on Product X
were not reassigned after this line is shut down. That is, a maximum savings
of $90.00 per day would result.
2. Materials: The maximum savings on direct material will be $86.40. However,
this ﬁgure could be lower if some of the material for Product X is obtained
from scrap of another product.
3. Overhead: Because other products are made in Department A, no reduction in
total ﬂoor space requirements will probably occur. Therefore, no reduction in
overheadcostswillresultfromdiscontinuingProductX. Ithasbeenestimated
that there will be daily savings in the variable overhead costs traceable to
Product X of about $3.00 due to a reduction in power costs and in insurance
premiums.
Solution
If the manufacture of Product X is discontinued, the ﬁrm will save at most
$90.00 in direct labor, $86.40 in direct materials, and $3.00 in variable overhead
costs, which totals $179.40 per day. This estimate of actual cost savings per
day is less than the potential savings indicated by the cost accounting records
($288.40 per day), and it would not exceed the $201.60 to be paid to the outside
company if Product X is purchased. For this reason, the plant manager used
Rule 2 and rejected the proposal of the foreman and continued the manufacture
of Product X.
In conclusion, Example 2-10 shows how an erroneous decision might be
made by using the unit cost of Product X from the cost accounting records
without detailed analysis. The ﬁxed cost portion of Product X’s unit cost, which
is present even if the manufacture of Product X is discontinued, was not properly
accounted for in the original analysis by the foreman.
2.4.3
Trade-Offs in Energy Efﬁciency Studies
Energy efﬁciency affects the annual expense of operating an electrical device such
as a pump or motor. Typically, a more energy-efﬁcient device requires a higher
capital investment than does a less energy-efﬁcient device, but the extra capital
investment usually produces annual savings in electrical power expenses relative
to a second pump or motor that is less energy efﬁcient. This important trade-
off between capital investment and annual electric power consumption will be
considered in several chapters of this book. Hence, the purpose of Section 2.4.3 is

SECTION 2.5 / CASE STUDY−−THE ECONOMICS OF DAYTIME RUNNING LIGHTS 49
to explain how the annual expense of operating an electrical device is calculated
and traded off against capital investment cost.
If an electric pump, for example, can deliver a given horsepower (hp) or
kilowatt (kW) rating to an industrial application, the input energy requirement
is determined by dividing the given output by the energy efﬁciency of the device.
The input requirement in hp or kW is then multiplied by the annual hours that the
device operates and the unit cost of electric power. You can see that the higher the
efﬁciency of the pump, the lower the annual cost of operating the device is relative
to another less-efﬁcient pump.
EXAMPLE 2-11
Investing in Electrical Efﬁciency
Two pumps capable of delivering 100 hp to an agricultural application are being
evaluated in a present economy study. The selected pump will only be utilized
for one year, and it will have no market value at the end of the year. Pertinent
data are summarized as follows:
ABC Pump
XYZ Pump
Purchase price
$2,900
$6,200
Maintenance cost
$170
$510
Efﬁciency
80%
90%
If electric power costs $0.10 per kWh and the pump will be operated 4,000
hours per year, which pump should be chosen? Recall that 1 hp = 0.746 kW.
Solution
The expense of electric power for the ABC pump is
(100 hp/0.80)(0.746 kW/hp)($0.10/kWh)(4,000 hours/yr) = $37,300.
For the XYZ Pump, the expense of electric power is
(100 hp/0.90)(0.746 kW/hp)($0.10/kWh)(4,000 hours/yr) = $33,156.
Thus, the total cost of owning and operating the ABC pump is $40,370,
while the total cost of owning and operating the XYZ pump for one year is
$39,866. Consequently, the more energy-efﬁcient XYZ pump should be selected
to minimize total cost. Notice the difference in energy expense ($4,144) that
results from a 90% efﬁcient pump relative to an 80% efﬁcient pump. This cost
reduction more than balances the extra $3,300 in capital investment and $340 in
maintenance required for the XYZ pump.

CASE STUDY—The Economics of Daytime Running Lights
The use of Daytime Running Lights (DRLs) has increased in popularity with car
designers throughout the world. In some countries, motorists are required to drive
with their headlights on at all times. U.S. car manufacturers now offer models

50
CHAPTER 2 / COST CONCEPTS AND DESIGN ECONOMICS
equipped with daytime running lights. Most people would agree that driving with
the headlights on at night is cost effective with respect to extra fuel consumption and
safety considerations (not to mention required by law!). Cost effective means that
beneﬁts outweigh (exceed) the costs. However, some consumers have questioned
whether it is cost effective to drive with your headlights on during the day.
Inanattempttoprovideananswertothisquestion, letusconsiderthefollowing
suggested data:
75% of driving takes place during the daytime.
2% of fuel consumption is due to accessories (radio, headlights, etc.).
Cost of fuel = $4.00 per gallon.
Average distance traveled per year = 15,000 miles.
Average cost of an accident = $2,800.
Purchase price of headlights = $25.00 per set (2 headlights).
Average time car is in operation per year = 350 hours.
Average life of a headlight = 200 operating hours.
Average fuel consumption = 1 gallon per 30 miles.
Let’s analyze the cost effectiveness of driving with headlights on during the
day by considering the following set of questions:
• What are the extra costs associated with driving with headlights on during
the day?
• What are the beneﬁts associated with driving with headlights on during the day?
• What additional assumptions (if any) are needed to complete the analysis?
• Is it cost effective to drive with headlights on during the day?
Solution
After some reﬂection on the above questions, you could reasonably contend that
the extra costs of driving with headlights on during the day include increased
fuel consumption and more frequent headlight replacement. Headlights increase
visibilitytootherdriversontheroad.Anotherpossiblebeneﬁtisthereducedchance
of an accident.
Additional assumptions needed to consider during our analysis of the situation
include:
1. the percentage of fuel consumption due to headlights alone and
2. how many accidents can be avoided per unit time.
Selecting the dollar as our common unit of measure, we can compute the extra
cost associated with daytime use of headlights and compare it to the expected
beneﬁt (also measured in dollars). As previously determined, the extra costs
include increased fuel consumption and more frequent headlight replacement.

SECTION 2.6 / TRY YOUR SKILLS 51
Let’s develop an estimate of the annual fuel cost:
Annual fuel cost = (15,000 mi/yr)(1 gal/30 mi)($4.00/gal) = $2,000/yr.
Assume (worst case) that 2% of fuel consumption is due to normal (night-time) use
of headlights.
Fuel cost due to normal use of headlights = ($2,000/yr)(0.02) = $40/yr.
Fuel cost due to continuous use of headlights = (4)($40/yr) = $160/yr.
Headlight cost for normal use = (0.25)
! 350 hours/yr
200 hours/set
" !$25
set
"
= $10.94/yr.
Headlight cost for continuous use =
! 350 hours/yr
200 hours/set
" !$25
set
"
= $43.75/yr.
Total cost associated with daytime use = ($160 −$40) + ($43.75 −$10.94)
= $152.81/yr.
If driving with your headlights on during the day results in at least one
accident being avoided during the next ($2,800)/($152.81) = 18.3 years, then the
continuous use of your headlights is cost effective. Although in the short term,
you may be able to contend that the use of DRLs lead to increased fuel and
replacement bulb costs, the beneﬁts of increased personal safety and mitigation of
possible accident costs in the long run more than offset the apparent short-term cost
savings.

Summary
In this chapter, we have discussed cost terminology and concepts important in
engineering economy. It is important that the meaning and use of various cost
terms and concepts be understood in order to communicate effectively with other
engineering and management personnel. A listing of important abbreviations and
notation, by chapter, is provided in Appendix B.
Several general economic concepts were discussed and illustrated. First, the
ideas of consumer and producer goods and services, measures of economic growth,
and competition were covered. Then, some relationships among costs, price, and
volume (demand) were discussed. Included were the concepts of optimal volume
and breakeven points. Important economic principles of design optimization were
also illustrated in this chapter.
The use of present-economy studies in engineering decision making can
provide satisfactory results and save considerable analysis effort. When an ade-
quate engineering economic analysis can be accomplished by considering the
various monetary consequences that occur in a short time period (usually one
year or less), a present-economy study should be used.

2-23. Ethanol blended with gasoline can be used
to power a “ﬂex-fueled” car. One particular blend
that is gaining in popularity is E85, which is 85%
ethanol and 15% gasoline. E85 is 80% cleaner burning
than gasoline alone, and it reduces our dependency on
foreign oil. But a ﬂex-fueled car costs $1,000 more than
a conventional gasoline-fueled car. Additionally, E85
fuel gets 10% less miles per gallon than a conventional
automobile.
Consider a 100% gasoline-fueled car that averages
30 miles per gallon. The E85-fueled car will average
about 27 miles per gallon. If either car will be driven
81,000 miles before being traded in, how much will
the E85 fuel have to cost (per gallon) to make the ﬂex-
fueled car as economically attractive as a conventional
gasoline-fueled car? Gasoline costs $3.89 per gallon.

2-26. The cost of operating a large ship (CO) varies as
the square of its velocity (v); speciﬁcally, CO = knv2,
where n is the trip length in miles and k is a constant of
proportionality. It is known that at 12 miles/hour, the
average cost of operation is $100 per mile. The owner of
the ship wants to minimize the cost of operation, but
it must be balanced against the cost of the perishable
cargo (Cc), which the customer has set at $1,500 per
hour. At what velocity should the trip be planned to
minimize the total cost (CT), which is the sum of the
cost of operating the ship and the cost of perishable
cargo? (2.3)

2-28. According to the U.S. Department of the
Interior, the amount of energy lost because of
poorly insulated homes is equivalent to 2 million barrels
of oil per day. In 2009, this is more oil than the United
States imports from SaudiArabia each day. If we were to
insulate our homes as determined by Example 2-7, we
could eliminate our oil dependence on Saudi Arabia.
If the cost of electricity increases to $0.15 per kWh and
the cost of insulation quadruples, how much insulation
should be chosen in Example 2-7? (2.3)
2-29. One component of a system’s life-cycle cost is
the cost of system failure. Failure costs can be reduced
by designing a more reliable system. A simpliﬁed
expression for system life-cycle cost, C, can be written
as a function of the system’s failure rate:
C = CI
λ + CR · λ · t.
Here,
CI = investment cost ($ per hour per failure),
CR = system repair cost,
λ = system failure rate
(failures/operating hour),
t = operating hours.
a. Assume that CI, CR, and t are constants. Derive an
expression for λ, say λ∗, that optimizes C. (2.3)
b. Does the equation in Part (a) correspond to a
maximum or minimum value of C? Show all work
to support your answer.
c. What trade-off is being made in this problem?
2-30. Stan Moneymaker has been shopping for
a new car. He is interested in a certain 4-cylinder
sedan that averages 28 miles per gallon. But the sales-
person tried to persuade Stan that the 6-cylinder model
of the same automobile only costs $2,500 more and is
really a “more sporty and responsive” vehicle. Stan is
impressed with the zip of the 6-cylinder car and reasons
that $2,500 is not too much to pay for the extra power.

56
CHAPTER 2 / COST CONCEPTS AND DESIGN ECONOMICS
How much extra is Stan really paying if the
6-cylinder car averages 22 miles per gallon? Assume
that Stan will drive either automobile 100,000 miles,
gasoline will average $4.00 per gallon, and maintenance
is roughly the same for both cars. State other assum-
ptions you think are appropriate. (2.4)
2-31. A producer of synthetic motor oil for
automobiles and light trucks has made the
following statement: “One quart of Dynolube added to
your next oil change will increase fuel mileage by one
percent. This one-time additive will improve your fuel
mileage over 50,000 miles of driving.” (2.4)
a. Assume the company’s claim is correct. How much
money will be saved by adding one quart of
Dynolube if gasoline costs $4.00 per gallon and
your car averages 20 miles per gallon without the
Dynolube?
b. If a quart of Dynolube sells for $19.95, would you
use this product in your automobile?
2-32. An automobile dealership offers to ﬁll the
four tires of your new car with 100% nitrogen for
a cost of $20. The dealership claims that nitrogen-ﬁlled
tires run cooler than those ﬁlled with compressed air,
and they advertise that nitrogen extends tire mileage
(life) by 25%. If new tires cost $50 each and are guaran-
teed to get 50,000 miles (ﬁlled with air) before they
require replacement, is the dealership’s offer a good
deal? (2.4)
2-33. In the design of an automobile radiator, an
engineer has a choice of using either a brass–
copper alloy casting or a plastic molding.
Either
material provides the same service. However, the brass–
copper alloy casting weighs 25 pounds, compared with
20 pounds for the plastic molding. Every pound of extra
weight in the automobile has been assigned a penalty of
$6 to account for increased fuel consumption during the
life cycle of the car. The brass–copper alloy casting costs
$3.35perpound, whereastheplasticmoldingcosts$7.40
per pound. Machining costs per casting are $6.00 for the
brass–copper alloy. Which material should the engineer
select, and what is the difference in unit costs? (2.4)
2-34. Rework Example 2-9 for the case where the
capacity of each machine is further reduced by 25%
because of machine failures, materials shortages, and
operator errors. In this situation, 30,000 units of good
(nondefective) product must be manufactured during
the next three months. Assume one shift per day and
ﬁve work days per week. (2.4)
a. Can the order be delivered on time?
b. If only one machine (A or B) can be used in Part (a),
which one should it be?
2-35. Two alternative designs are under consideration
for a tapered fastening pin. The fastening pins are sold
for $0.70 each. Either design will serve equally well
and will involve the same material and manufacturing
cost except for the lathe and drill operations. Design A
will require 12 hours of lathe time and 5 hours of drill
time per 1,000 units. Design B will require 7 hours of
lathe time and 8 hours of drill time per 1,000 units. The
variable operating cost of the lathe, including labor, is
$18.60 per hour. The variable operating cost of the drill,
including labor, is $16.90 per hour. Finally, there is a
sunk cost of $5,000 for Design Aand $9,000 for Design B
due to obsolete tooling. (2.4)
a. Which design should be adopted if 125,000 units are
sold each year?
b. What is the annual saving over the other design?
2-36. A bicycle component manufacturer produces
hubs for bike wheels. Two processes are possible for
manufacturing, and the parameters of each process are
as follows:
Process 1
Process 2
Production rate
35 parts/hour
15 parts/hour
Daily production time
4 hours/day
7 hours/day
Percent of parts
20%
9%
rejected based on
visual inspection
Assume that the daily demand for hubs allows all
defect-free hubs to be sold. Additionally, tested or
rejected hubs cannot be sold.
Find the process that maximizes proﬁt per day if
each part is made from $4 worth of material and can be
sold for $30. Both processes are fully automated, and
variable overhead cost is charged at the rate of $40 per
hour. (2.4)
2-37. The speed of your automobile has a huge
effect on fuel consumption. Traveling at 65 miles
per hour (mph) instead of 55 mph can consume almost
20% more fuel. As a general rule, for every mile per hour
over 55, you lose 2% in fuel economy. For example, if
your automobile gets 30 miles per gallon at 55 mph, the
fuel consumption is 21 miles per gallon at 70 mph.

PROBLEMS
57
If you take a 400-mile trip and your average speed
is 80 mph rather than the posted speed limit of 70 mph,
what is the extra cost of fuel if gasoline costs $4.00
per gallon? Your car gets 30 miles per gallon (mpg) at
60 mph. (2.4)
2-38. Suppose
that
four
85-octane
gasoline
pumps and three 89-octane gasoline pumps
provide as much proﬁt at a local convenience store in
ﬁve days as three 85-octane pumps and ﬁve 89-octane
pumps provide in four days. Which gasoline pump
produces greater proﬁt for the store? (2.4)
2-39. Refer to Example 2-11. Would the pump
recommendation change if the cost of electricity
was $0.15 per kWh? What if the pumps were only
required for 3,000 operating hours? (2.4)
2-40. A company is analyzing a make-versus-purchase
situation for a component used in several products,
and the engineering department has developed these
data:
Option A: Purchase 10,000 items per year at a ﬁxed
price of $8.50 per item. The cost of placing
the order is negligible according to the
present cost accounting procedure.
Option B: Manufacture 10,000 items per year, using
available capacity in the factory.
Cost
estimates are direct materials
=
$5.00
per item and direct labor
=
$1.50 per
item. Manufacturing overhead is allocated
at 200% of direct labor (= $3.00 per item).
Based on these data, should the item be purchased or
manufactured? (2.4)
2-41. A national car rental agency asks, “Do you
want to bring back the economy-class car full of
gas or with an empty tank? If we ﬁll up the tank for you,
we’ll charge you $3.50 per gallon, which is 50 cents less
than the local price for gasoline.” Which choice should
you make? State your assumptions. (2.4)
2-42. One
method
for
developing
a
mine
containing an estimated 100,000 tons of ore will
result in the recovery of 62% of the available ore
deposit and will cost $23 per ton of material removed.
A second method of development will recover only
50% of the ore deposit, but it will cost only $15 per
ton of material removed. Subsequent processing of the
removedorerecovers300poundsofmetalfromeachton
of processed ore and costs $40 per ton of ore processed.
The recovered metal can be sold for $0.80 per pound.
Which method for developing the mine should be used
if your objective is to maximize total proﬁt from the
mine? (2.4)
2-43. Ocean water contains 0.9 ounces of gold per ton.
MethodAcosts $550 per ton of water processed and will
recover 90% of the metal. Method B costs $400 per ton
of water processed and will recover 60% of the metal.
The two methods require the same capital investment
and are capable of producing the same amount of gold
each day. If the extracted gold can be sold for $1,750 per
ounce, which method should be recommended? The
supply of ocean water is essentially unlimited. Hint:
Work this problem on the basis of proﬁt per ounce of
gold extracted. (2.4)
2-44. Which of the following statements are true and
which are false? (all sections)
a. Working capital is a variable cost.
b. The greatest potential for cost savings occurs in the
operation phase of the life cycle.
c. If the capacity of an operation is signiﬁcantly
changed (e.g., a manufacturing plant), the ﬁxed
costs will also change.
d. A noncash cost is a cash ﬂow.
e. Goods and services have utility because they have
the power to satisfy human wants and needs.
f. The demand for necessities is more inelastic than the
demand for luxuries.
g. Indirect costs can normally be allocated to a speciﬁc
output or work activity.
h. Present economy studies are often done when the
time value of money is not a signiﬁcant factor in the
situation.
i. Overhead costs normally include all costs that are
not direct costs.
j. Optimal volume (demand) occurs when total costs
equal total revenues.
k. Standard costs per unit of output are established in
advance of actual production or service delivery.
l. A related sunk cost will normally affect the
prospective cash ﬂows associated with a situation.
m. The life cycle needs to be deﬁned within the context
of the speciﬁc situation.
n. The greatest commitment of costs occurs in the
acquisition phase of the life cycle.
o. High breakeven points in capital intensive indus-
tries are desirable.

p. The ﬁxed return on borrowed capital (i.e., interest)
is more risky than proﬁts paid to equity investors
(i.e., stockholders) in a ﬁrm.
q. There is no D∗for this Scenario 1 situation: p =

r. Most decisions are based on differences that are
perceived to exist among alternatives.
s. A nonrefundable cash outlay (e.g., money spent on

2-45. A hot water leak in one of the faucets of
your
apartment
can
be
very
wasteful.
A
continuous leak of one quart per hour (a “slow” leak) at
155◦F causes a loss of 1.75 million Btu per year. Suppose
your water is heated with electricity. (2.3)
a. How many pounds of coal delivered to your electric
utility does this leak equate to if one pound of
coal contains 12,000 Btu and the boiler combustion
process and water distribution system have an
overall efﬁciency of 30%?
b. If a pound of coal produces 1.83 pounds of CO2
during the combustion process, how much extra
carbon dioxide does the leaky faucet produce in
a year?
2-46. Extended Learning Exercise The student chapter
of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers is
planning a six-day trip to the national conference in
Albany, NY. For transportation, the group will rent a
car from either the State Tech Motor Pool or a local
car dealer. The Motor Pool charges $0.36 per mile, has
no daily fee, and pays for the gas. The local car dealer
charges $30 per day and $0.20 per mile, but the group
must pay for the gas. The car’s fuel rating is 20 miles
per gallon, and the price of gas is estimated to be $2.00
per gallon. (2.2)
a. At what point, in miles, is the cost of both options
equal?
b. The car dealer has offered a special student discount
and will give the students 100 free miles per day.
What is the new breakeven point?
c. Suppose now that the Motor Pool reduces its all-
inclusive rate to $0.34 per mile and that the car dealer
increasestherateto$30perdayand$0.28permile. In
this case, the car dealer wants to encourage student
business, so he offers 900 free miles for the entire six-
day trip. He claims that if more than 750 miles are
driven, students will come out ahead with one of his
rental cars. If the students anticipate driving 2,000
miles (total), from whom should they rent a car? Is
the car dealer’s claim entirely correct?
2-47. Web Exercise Home heating accounts for
approximately one-third of energy consumption
in a typical U.S. household. Despite soaring prices
of oil, coal, and natural gas, one can make his/her
winter heating bill noninﬂationary by installing an
ultraconvenient corn burning stove that costs in the
neighborhood of $2,400. That’s right—a small radiant-
heating stove that burns corn and adds practically
nothing to global warming or air pollution can be
obtained through www.magnumfireplace.com. Its
estimated annual savings per household in fuel is $300
in a regular U.S. farming community.
Conduct research on this means of home heating by
accessing the above Web site. Do the annual savings you
determine in your locale for a 2,000-square foot ranch-
style house more than offset the cost of installing and
maintaining a corn-burning stove? What other factors
besides dollars might inﬂuence your decision to use
corn for your home heating requirements? Be speciﬁc
with your suggestions. (2.4)
Spreadsheet Exercises
2-48. Refer to Example 2-4. If your focus was on
reducing expenses, would it be better to reduce the ﬁxed
cost (B1) or variable cost (B2) component? What is the
effect of a ± 10% change in both of these factors? (2.2)
2-49. Refer to Example 2-7. If the average inside
temperature of this house in Virginia is increased
from 65◦F to 72◦F, what is the most economical
insulation amount? Assume that 100,000,000 Btu are
lost with no insulation when the thermostat is set at
65◦F. The cost of electricity is now $0.086 per kWh. In
addition, the cost of insulation has increased by 50%.
Develop a spreadsheet to solve this problem. (2.3)

CHAPTER 2 / COST CONCEPTS AND DESIGN ECONOMICS
Appendix 2-A
Accounting Fundamentals
Accounting is often referred to as the language of business. Engineers should make serious
efforts to learn about a ﬁrm’s accounting practice so that they can better communicate with
top management. This section contains an extremely brief and simpliﬁed exposition of the
elements of ﬁnancial accounting in recording and summarizing transactions affecting the
ﬁnances of the enterprise. These fundamentals apply to any entity (such as an individual or
a corporation) called here a ﬁrm.
2-A.1
The Accounting Equation
All accounting is based on the fundamental accounting equation, which is
Assets = liabilities + owners’ equity,
(2-A-1)
where assets are those things of monetary value that the ﬁrm possesses, liabilities are those
things of monetary value that the ﬁrm owes, and owners’ equity is the worth of what the ﬁrm
owes to its stockholders (also referred to as equities, net worth, etc.). For example, typical
accounts in each term of Equation (2-A-1) are as follows:
Asset Accounts = Liability Accounts + Owner’s Equity Accounts
Cash
Short-term debt
Capital stock
Receivables
Payables
Retained earnings (income
Inventories
Long-term debt
retained in the ﬁrm)
Equipment
Buildings
Land
The fundamental accounting equation deﬁnes the format of the balance sheet, which is
one of the two most common accounting statements and which shows the ﬁnancial position
of the ﬁrm at any given point in time.
Another important, and rather obvious, accounting relationship is
Revenues −expenses = proﬁt (or loss).
(2-A-2)
This relationship deﬁnes the format of the income statement (also commonly known as a
proﬁt-and-loss statement), which summarizes the revenue and expense results of operations
over a period of time. Equation (2-A-1) can be expanded to take into account proﬁt as deﬁned
in Equation (2-A-2):
Assets = liabilities + (beginning owners’ equity + revenue −expenses).
(2-A-3)
Proﬁt is the increase in money value (not to be confused with cash) that results from a
ﬁrm’s operations and is available for distribution to stockholders. It therefore represents the
return on owners’ invested capital.
Auseful analogy is that a balance sheet is like a snapshot of the ﬁrm at an instant in time,
whereas an income statement is a summarized moving picture of the ﬁrm over an interval
of time. It is also useful to note that revenue serves to increase owners’ interests in a ﬁrm,
but an expense serves to decrease the owners’ equity amount for a ﬁrm.
To illustrate the workings of accounts in reﬂecting the decisions and actions of a
ﬁrm, suppose that an individual decides to undertake an investment opportunity and the
following sequence of events occurs over a period of one year:
1. Organize XYZ ﬁrm and invest $3,000 cash as capital.
2. Purchase equipment for a total cost of $2,000 by paying cash.

APPENDIX 2-A / ACCOUNTING FUNDAMENTALS 61
3. Borrow $1,500 through a note to the bank.
4. Manufacture year’s supply of inventory through the following:
(a) Pay $1,200 cash for labor.
(b) Incur $400 accounts payable for material.
(c) Recognize the partial loss in value (depreciation) of the equipment amounting to
$500.
5. Sell on credit all goods produced for year, 1,000 units at $3 each. Recognize that the
accounting cost of these goods is $2,100, resulting in an increase in equity (through
proﬁts) of $900.
6. Collect $2,200 of accounts receivable.
7. Pay $300 of accounts payable and $1,000 of bank note.
Asimpliﬁedversionoftheaccountingentriesrecordingthesameinformationinaformat
that reﬂects the effects on the fundamental accounting equation (with a “+” denoting an
increase and a “−” denoting a decrease) is shown in Figure 2-A-1. A summary of the results
is shown in Figure 2-A-2.
It should be noted that the proﬁt for a period serves to increase the value of the owners’
equity in the ﬁrm by that amount. Also, it is signiﬁcant that the net cash ﬂow from operation
of $700 (= $2,200 −$1,200 −$300) is not the same as proﬁt. This amount was recognized
in transaction 4(c), in which capital consumption (depreciation) for equipment of $500 was
declared. Depreciation serves to convert part of an asset into an expense, which is then
reﬂected in a ﬁrm’s proﬁts, as seen in Equation (2-A-2). Thus, the proﬁt was $900, or $200
more than the net cash ﬂow. For our purposes, revenue is recognized when it is earned, and
expenses are recognized when they are incurred.
One important and potentially misleading indicator of after-the-fact ﬁnancial perfor-
mance that can be obtained from Figure 2-A-2 is “annual rate of return.” If the invested
capital is taken to be the owners’ (equity) investment, the annual rate of return at the end of
this particular year is $900/$3,900 = 23%.
Financial statements are usually most meaningful if ﬁgures are shown for two or more
years (or other reporting periods such as quarters or months) or for two or more individuals
or ﬁrms. Such comparative ﬁgures can be used to reﬂect trends or ﬁnancial indications
that are useful in enabling investors and management to determine the effectiveness of
investments after they have been made.
2-A.2
Cost Accounting
Cost accounting, or management accounting, is a phase of accounting that is of particular
importance in engineering economic analysis because it is concerned principally with
decision making and control in a ﬁrm. Consequently, cost accounting is the source of much
of the cost data needed in making engineering economy studies. Modern cost accounting
may satisfy any or all of the following objectives:
1. Determination of the actual cost of products or services
2. Provision of a rational basis for pricing goods or services
3. Provision of a means for allocating and controlling expenditures
4. Provision of information on which operating decisions may be based and by means of
which operating decisions may be evaluated
Although the basic objectives of cost accounting are simple, the exact determination
of costs usually is not. As a result, some of the procedures used are arbitrary devices that

Cost Accounting Example
This relatively simple example involves a job-order system in which costs are assigned to
work by job number. Schematically, this process is illustrated in the following diagram:
Direct materials
Direct labor
Factory overhead
Jobs
(work in
progress)
Finished goods
inventory
Cost
of goods
sold
Selling expenses
Administrative expenses
Total expenses
Costs are assigned to jobs in the following manner:
1. Raw materials attach to jobs via material requisitions.
2. Direct labor attaches to jobs via direct labor tickets.
3. Overhead cannot be attached to jobs directly but must have an allocation procedure that
relates it to one of the resource factors, such as direct labor, which is already accumulated
by the job.

Notice that this cost is not the total cost. We must somehow ﬁnd a way to attach (allocate)
factory costs that cannot be directly identiﬁed to the job but are nevertheless involved in
producing the 100 rackets. Costs such as the power to run the graphite molding machine, the
depreciation on this machine, the depreciation of the factory building, and the supervisor’s
salary constitute overhead for this company. These overhead costs are part of the cost
structure of the 100 rackets but cannot be directly traced to the job. For instance, do we
really know how much machine obsolescence is attributable to the 100 rackets? Probably
not. Therefore, wemustallocatetheseoverheadcoststothe100racketsbyusingtheoverhead
rate determined as follows:
Overhead rate = $600,000
200,000 = $3 per direct labor hour.
This means that $600 ($3 × 200) of the total annual overhead cost of $600,000 would be
allocated to Job #161. Thus, the total cost of Job #161 would be as follows:
Direct labor
$1,400
Direct materials
790
Factory overhead
600
$2,790
The cost of manufacturing each racket is thus $27.90. If selling expenses and
administrative expenses are allocated as 40% of the cost of goods sold, the total expense
of a tennis racket becomes 1.4($27.90) = $39.06.

CHAPTER 3
Cost-Estimation Techniques
The objective of Chapter 3 is to present an assortment of methods
for estimating important factors in an engineering economy study.
The High Cost of Environmental
Cleanup
I
n December of 1980, Congress enacted the Comprehensive Envi-
ronmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA),
also known as the “Superfund.” This law created broad federal
authority to respond to releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances.
CERCLAprovides liability for corporations responsible for closed and abandoned
hazardous waste sites. Regrettably, affected parties soon found that the cost of
neglecting hazardous waste sites was extremely high. But how high?
Prior to 1980, many corporations had not set aside money for cleaning up
behind themselves as their business models evolved and changed. For example,
hazardous chemicals were left behind in tanks and piping, and most of the
facilities had used asbestos for insulation. Transformers contained oil that was
often contaminated with PCBs. As plant and equipment deteriorated, these types
of hazardous substances migrated into the environment and contaminated the
land and the ground water. The cost of cleanup became astronomical.
In addition to the possible impact on human health and the environment,
it is abundantly clear that the cost of doing business must include surveillance,
maintenance, and safe closure of contaminated facilities. In the long run, it saves
money to act early to responsibly comply with CERCLA. In Chapter 3, you will
learn about many techniques that are useful for estimating the costs associated
with environmental cleanup.

Decisions, both great and small, depend in part on estimates. “Looking down the barrel” need
not be an embarrassment for the engineer if newer techniques, professional stafﬁng, and a
greater awareness are assigned to the engineering cost estimating function.
—Phillip F. Ostwald (1992)
3.1 Introduction
In Chapter 1, we described the engineering economic analysis procedure in terms
of seven steps. In this chapter, we address Step 3, development of the outcomes
and cash ﬂows for each alternative. Because engineering economy studies deal
with outcomes that extend into the future, estimating the future cash ﬂows for
feasible alternatives is a critical step in the analysis procedure. Often, the most
difﬁcult, expensive, and time-consuming part of an engineering economy study
is the estimation of costs, revenues, useful lives, residual values, and other data
pertaining to the alternatives being analyzed. A decision based on the analysis is
economically sound only to the extent that these cost and revenue estimates are
representative of what subsequently will occur. In this chapter, we introduce the
roleofcostestimatinginengineeringpractice. Deﬁnitionsandexamplesofimportant
cost concepts were provided in Chapter 2.
Whenever an engineering economic analysis is performed for a major capital
investment, the cost-estimating effort for that analysis should be an integral part of
a comprehensive planning and design process requiring the active participation of
not only engineering designers but also personnel from marketing, manufacturing,
ﬁnance, and top management. Results of cost estimating are used for a variety of
purposes, including the following:
1. Providing information used in setting a selling price for quoting, bidding, or
evaluating contracts
2. Determining whether a proposed product can be made and distributed at a
proﬁt (for simplicity, price = cost + proﬁt)
3. Evaluating how much capital can be justiﬁed for process changes or other
improvements
4. Establishing benchmarks for productivity improvement programs
There are two fundamental approaches to cost estimating: the “top-down”
approach and the “bottom-up” approach. The top-down approach basically uses
historical data from similar engineering projects to estimate the costs, revenues, and
other data for the current project by modifying these data for changes in inﬂation
or deﬂation, activity level, weight, energy consumption, size, and other factors.
This approach is best used early in the estimating process when alternatives are
still being developed and reﬁned.
The bottom-up approach is a more detailed method of cost estimating. This
method breaks down a project into small, manageable units and estimates their
economic consequences. These smaller unit costs are added together with other
types of costs to obtain an overall cost estimate. This approach usually works best
when the detail concerning the desired output (a product or a service) has been
deﬁned and clariﬁed.

SECTION 3.1 / INTRODUCTION 69
EXAMPLE 3-1
Estimating the Cost of a College Degree
A simple example of cost estimating is to forecast the expense of getting a
Bachelor of Science (B.S.) from the university you are attending. In our solution,
we outline the two basic approaches just discussed for estimating these costs.
Solution
A top-down approach would take the published cost of a four-year degree at
the same (or a similar) university and adjust it for inﬂation and extraordinary
items that an incoming student might encounter, such as fraternity/sorority
membership, scholarships, and tutoring. For example, suppose that the pub-
lished cost of attending your university is $15,750 for the current year. This
ﬁgure is anticipated to increase at the rate of 6% per year and includes full-
time tuition and fees, university housing, and a weekly meal plan. Not
included are the costs of books, supplies, and other personal expenses. For
our initial estimate, these “other” expenses are assumed to remain constant at
$5,000 per year.
The total estimated cost for four years can now be computed. We simply
need to adjust the published cost for inﬂation each year and add in the cost of
“other” expenses.

18,759 × 1.06 = 19,885
5,000

Grand Total
$93,036
In contrast with the top-down approach, a bottom-up approach to the same
cost estimate would be to ﬁrst break down anticipated expenses into the typical
categories shown in Figure 3-1 for each of the four years at the university.
Tuition and fees can be estimated fairly accurately in each year, as can books and
supplies. For example, suppose that the average cost of a college textbook is $100.
You can estimate your annual textbook cost by simply multiplying the average
cost per book by the number of courses you plan to take. Assume that you
plan on taking ﬁve courses each semester during the ﬁrst year. Your estimated
textbook costs would be
!5 courses
semester
"
(2 semesters)
!1 book
course
" ! $100
book
"
= $1,000.
The other two categories, living expenses and transportation, are probably
more dependent on your lifestyle. For example, whether you own and operate
an automobile and live in a “high-end” apartment off-campus can dramatically
affect the estimated expenses during your college years.

3.2 An Integrated Approach
An integrated approach to developing the net cash ﬂows for feasible project
alternatives is shown in Figure 3-2. This integrated approach includes three basic
components:
1. Work breakdown structure (WBS)
This is a technique for explicitly deﬁning,
at successive levels of detail, the work elements of a project and their
interrelationships (sometimes called a work element structure).
2. Costandrevenuestructure(classiﬁcation)
Delineationofthecostandrevenue
categories and elements is made for estimates of cash ﬂows at each level of the
WBS.
3. Estimating techniques (models)
Selected mathematical models are used to
estimate the future costs and revenues during the analysis period.
These three basic components, together with integrating procedural steps, provide
an organized approach for developing the cash ﬂows for the alternatives.

CHAPTER 3 / COST-ESTIMATION TECHNIQUES
As shown in Figure 3-2, the integrated approach begins with a description
of the project in terms of a WBS. WBS is used to describe the project and each
alternative’s unique characteristics in terms of design, labor, material requirements,
and so on. Then these variations in design, resource requirements, and other
characteristics are reﬂected in the estimated future costs and revenues (net cash
ﬂow) for that alternative.
To estimate future costs and revenues for an alternative, the perspective
(viewpoint) of the cash ﬂow must be established and an estimating baseline and
analysis period deﬁned. Normally, cash ﬂows are developed from the owner’s
viewpoint. The net cash ﬂow for an alternative represents what is estimated to
happen to future revenues and costs from the perspective being used. Therefore, the
estimated changes in revenues and costs associated with an alternative have to be
relativetoabaselinethatisconsistentlyusedforallthealternativesbeingcompared.
3.2.1
The Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)
The ﬁrst basic component in an integrated approach to developing cash ﬂows
is the work breakdown structure (WBS). The WBS is a basic tool in project
management and is a vital aid in an engineering economy study. The WBS serves
as a framework for deﬁning all project work elements and their interrelationships,
collecting and organizing information, developing relevant cost and revenue data,
and integrating project management activities.
Figure 3-3 shows a diagram of a typical four-level WBS. It is developed from
the top (project level) down in successive levels of detail. The project is divided
into its major work elements (Level 2). These major elements are then divided to
develop Level 3, and so on. For example, an automobile (ﬁrst level of the WBS) can
be divided into second-level components (or work elements) such as the chassis,
drive train, and electrical system. Then each second-level component of the WBS
can be subdivided further into third-level elements. The drive train, for example,
can be subdivided into third-level components such as the engine, differential, and
transmission. This process is continued until the desired detail in the deﬁnition
and description of the project or system is achieved.
Different numbering schemes may be used. The objectives of numbering are to
indicate the interrelationships of the work elements in the hierarchy. The scheme
illustrated in Figure 3-3 is an alphanumeric format. Another scheme often used is all
numeric—Level 1: 1-0; Level 2: 1-1, 1-2, 1-3; Level 3: 1-1-1, 1-1-2, 1-2-1, 1-2-2, 1-3-1,
1-3-2; and so on (i.e., similar to the organization of this book). Usually, the level is
equal (except for Level 1) to the number of characters indicating the work element.
Other characteristics of a project WBS are as follows:
1. Both functional (e.g., planning) and physical (e.g., foundation) work elements
are included in it:
(a) Typical
functional
work
elements
are
logistical
support,

management, marketing, engineering, and systems integration.
(b) Physical work elements are the parts that make up a structure, product,
piece of equipment, or similar item; they require labor, materials, and other
resources to produce or construct.

2. The content and resource requirements for a work element are the sum of the
activities and resources of related subelements below it.
3. A project WBS usually includes recurring (e.g., maintenance) and nonrecurring
(e.g., initial construction) work elements.
EXAMPLE 3-2
A WBS for a Construction Project
You have been appointed by your company to manage a project involving
construction of a small commercial building with two ﬂoors of 15,000 gross
square feet each. The ground ﬂoor is planned for small retail shops, and
the second ﬂoor is planned for ofﬁces. Develop the ﬁrst three levels of a
representative WBS adequate for all project efforts from the time the decision
was made to proceed with the design and construction of the building until
initial occupancy is completed.
Solution
There would be variations in the WBSs developed by different individuals for a
commercial building. A representative three-level WBS is shown in Figure 3-4.
Level 1 is the total project. At Level 2, the project is divided into seven major
physical work elements and three major functional work elements. Then each
of these major elements is divided into subelements as required (Level 3). The
numbering scheme used in this example is all numeric.

3.2.2
The Cost and Revenue Structure
The second basic component of the integrated approach for developing cash
ﬂows (Figure 3-2) is the cost and revenue structure. This structure is used to
identify and categorize the costs and revenues that need to be included in
the analysis. Detailed data are developed and organized within this structure
for use with the estimating techniques of Section 3.3 to prepare the cash-ﬂow
estimates.
The life-cycle concept and the WBS are important aids in developing the cost
and revenue structure for a project. The life cycle deﬁnes a maximum time period
and establishes a range of cost and revenue elements that need to be considered
in developing cash ﬂows. The WBS focuses the analyst’s effort on the speciﬁc
functional and physical work elements of a project and on its related costs
and revenues.
Perhapsthemostserioussourceoferrorsindevelopingcashﬂowsisoverlooking
important categories of costs and revenues. The cost and revenue structure,
prepared in tabular or checklist form, is a good means of preventing such
oversights. Technical familiarity with the project is essential in ensuring the
completeness of the structure, as are using the life-cycle concept and the WBS
in its preparation.
The following is a brief listing of some categories of costs and revenues that
are typically needed in an engineering economy study:
1. Capital investment (ﬁxed and working)
2. Labor costs
3. Material costs
4. Maintenance costs
5. Property taxes and insurance
6. Overhead costs
7. Disposal costs
8. Revenues based on sales, etc.
9. Quality (and scrap) costs
10. Market (or salvage) values
3.2.3
Estimating Techniques (Models)
The third basic component of the integrated approach (Figure 3-2) involves
estimating techniques (models). These techniques, together with the detailed cost
and revenue data, are used to develop individual cash-ﬂow estimates and the
overall net cash ﬂow for each alternative.

76
CHAPTER 3 / COST-ESTIMATION TECHNIQUES
The purpose of estimating is to develop cash-ﬂow projections—not to produce
exact data about the future, which is virtually impossible. Neither a preliminary
estimate nor a ﬁnal estimate is expected to be exact; rather, it should adequately
suit the need at a reasonable cost and is often presented as a range of numbers.
Cost and revenue estimates can be classiﬁed according to detail, accuracy, and
their intended use as follows:
1. Order-of-magnitude estimates: used in the planning and initial evaluation stage
of a project.
2. Semidetailed, or budget, estimates: used in the preliminary or conceptual
design stage of a project.
3. Deﬁnitive (detailed) estimates: used in the detailed engineering/construction
stage of a project.
Order-of-magnitude estimates are used in selecting the feasible alternatives for the
study. Theytypicallyprovideaccuracyintherangeof±30to50%andaredeveloped
through semiformal means such as conferences, questionnaires, and generalized
equations applied at Level 1 or 2 of the WBS.
Budget (semidetailed) estimates are compiled to support the preliminary
designeffortanddecisionmakingduringthisprojectperiod. Theiraccuracyusually
lies in the range of ±15%. These estimates differ in the ﬁneness of cost and revenue
breakdowns and the amount of effort spent on the estimate. Estimating equations
applied at Levels 2 and 3 of the WBS are normally used.
Detailed estimates are used as the basis for bids and to make detailed design
decisions. Their accuracy is ±5%. They are made from speciﬁcations, drawings,
site surveys, vendor quotations, and in-house historical records and are usually
done at Level 3 and successive levels in the WBS.
Thus, it is apparent that a cost or revenue estimate can vary from a “back of the
envelope” calculation by an expert to a very detailed and accurate prediction of
the future prepared by a project team. The level of detail and accuracy of estimates
should depend on the following:
1. Time and effort available as justiﬁed by the importance of the study
2. Difﬁculty of estimating the items in question
3. Methods or techniques employed
4. Qualiﬁcations of the estimator(s)
5. Sensitivity of study results to particular factor estimates
As estimates become more detailed, accuracy typically improves, but the cost of
making the estimate increases dramatically. This general relationship is shown
in Figure 3-5 and illustrates the idea that cost and revenue estimates should be
prepared with full recognition of how accurate a particular study requires them
to be.

3.2.3.1
Sources of Estimating Data The information sources useful in cost
and revenue estimating are too numerous to list completely. The following four
major sources of information are listed roughly in order of importance:
1. Accounting records.
Accounting records are a prime source of information
for economic analyses; however, they are often not suitable for direct,
unadjusted use.
A brief discussion of the accounting process and information was given
in Appendix 2-A. In its most basic sense, accounting consists of a series of
procedures for keeping a detailed record of monetary transactions between
established categories of assets. Accounting records are a good source of
historical data but have some limitations when used in making prospective
estimates for engineering economic analyses. Moreover, accounting records
rarely contain direct statements of incremental costs or opportunity costs, both
of which are essential in most engineering economic analyses. Incremental
costs are decision speciﬁc for one-of-a-kind investments and are unlikely to
be available from the accounting system.
2. Other sources within the ﬁrm.
The typical ﬁrm has a number of people and
records that may be excellent sources of estimating information. Examples
of functions within ﬁrms that keep records useful to economic analyses are
engineering, sales, production, quality, purchasing, and personnel.
3. Sources outside the ﬁrm.
There are numerous sources outside the ﬁrm that
can provide helpful information. The main problem is in determining those
that are most beneﬁcial for particular needs. The following is a listing of some
commonly used outside sources:
(a) Published information. Technical directories, buyer indexes, U.S. government
publications, reference books, and trade journals offer a wealth of infor-
mation. For instance, Standard and Poor’s Industry Surveys gives monthly
information regarding key industries. The Statistical Abstract of the United
States is a remarkably comprehensive source of cost indexes and data. The
Bureau of Labor Statistics publishes many periodicals that are good sources

3.2.3.2
How Estimates Are Accomplished Estimates can be prepared in a
number of ways, such as the following examples:
1. A conference of various people who are thought to have good information or
bases for estimating the quantity in question. A special version of this is the
Delphi method, which involves cycles of questioning and feedback in which the
opinions of individual participants are kept anonymous.
2. Comparison with similar situations or designs about which there is more
information and from which estimates for the alternatives under consideration
can be extrapolated. This is sometimes called estimating by analogy. The
comparison method may be used to approximate the cost of a design or product
that is new. This is done by taking the cost of a more complex design for a similar
item as an upper bound and the cost of a less complex item of similar design
as a lower bound. The resulting approximation may not be very accurate, but
the comparison method does have the virtue of setting bounds that might be
useful for decision making.
3. Using quantitative techniques, which do not always have standardized names.
Some selected techniques, with the names used being generally suggestive of
the approaches, are discussed in the next section.
3.3
Selected Estimating Techniques (Models)
The estimating models discussed in this section are applicable for order-of-
magnitude estimates and for many semidetailed or budget estimates. They are
useful in the initial selection of feasible alternatives for further analysis and in the
conceptual or preliminary design phase of a project. Sometimes, these models can
be used in the detailed design phase of a project.

SECTION 3.3 / SELECTED ESTIMATING TECHNIQUES (MODELS) 79
3.3.1
Indexes
Costs and prices∗vary with time for a number of reasons, including (1) tech-
nologicaladvances, (2) availability of labor and materials, and (3) inﬂation.An index
is a dimensionless number that indicates how a cost or a price has changed with
time (typically escalated) with respect to a base year. Indexes provide a convenient
means for developing present and future cost and price estimates from historical
data. An estimate of the cost or selling price of an item in year n can be obtained
by multiplying the cost or price of the item at an earlier point in time (year k) by
the ratio of the index value in year n (¯In) to the index value in year k (¯Ik);† that is,
Cn = Ck
! ¯In
¯Ik
"
,
(3-1)
where k = reference year (e.g., 2000) for which cost or price of item is known;
n = year for which cost or price is to be estimated (n > k);
Cn = estimated cost or price of item in year n;
Ck = cost or price of item in reference year k.
Equation (3-1) is sometimes referred to as the ratio technique of updating costs and
prices. Use of this technique allows the cost or potential selling price of an item
to be taken from historical data with a speciﬁed base year and updated with an
index. This concept can be applied at the lower levels of a WBS to estimate the cost
of equipment, materials, and labor, as well as at the top level of a WBS to estimate
the total project cost of a new facility, bridge, and so on.
EXAMPLE 3-3
Indexing the Cost of a New Boiler
Acertain index for the cost of purchasing and installing utility boilers is keyed to
1988, where its baseline value was arbitrarily set at 100. Company XYZ installed
a 50,000-lb/hour boiler for $525,000 in 2000 when the index had a value of 468.
This same company must install another boiler of the same size in 2014. The
index in 2014 is 542. What is the approximate cost of the new boiler?
Solution
In this example, n is 2014 and k is 2000. From Equation (3-1), an approximate
cost of the boiler in 2014 is
C2014 = $525,000(542/468) = $608,013.
Indexes can be created for a single item or for multiple items. For a single item,
the index value is simply the ratio of the cost of the item in the current year to the
cost of the same item in the reference year, multiplied by the reference year factor
∗The terms cost and price are often used together. The cost of a product or service is the total of the resources, direct
and indirect, required to produce it. The price is the value of the good or service in the marketplace. In general, price
is equal to cost plus a proﬁt.
† In this section only, k is used to denote the reference year.

80
CHAPTER 3 / COST-ESTIMATION TECHNIQUES
(typically, 100). A composite index is created by averaging the ratios of selected
item costs in a particular year to the cost of the same items in a reference year.
The developer of an index can assign different weights to the items in the index
according to their contribution to total cost. For example, a general weighted index
is given by
¯In = W1(Cn1/Ck1) + W2(Cn2/Ck2) + · · · + WM(CnM/CkM)
W1 + W2 + · · · + WM
× ¯Ik,
(3-2)
where
M = total number of items in the index (1 ≤m ≤M);
Cnm = unit cost (or price) of the mth item in year n;
Ckm = unit cost (or price) of the mth item in year k;
Wm = weight assigned to the mth item;
¯Ik = composite index value in year k.
The weights W1, W2, . . . , WM can sum to any positive number, but typically sum
to 1.00 or 100. Almost any combination of labor, material, products, services, and
so on can be used for a composite cost or price index.
EXAMPLE 3-4
Weighted Index for Gasoline Cost
Based on the following data, develop a weighted index for the price of a gallon
of gasoline in 2014, when 1996 is the reference year having an index value
of 99.2. The weight placed on regular unleaded gasoline is three times that of
either premium or unleaded plus, because roughly three times as much regular
unleaded is sold compared with premium or unleaded plus.

Solution
In this example, k is 1996 and n is 2014. From Equation (3-2), the value of ¯I2014 is
(1)(315/114) + (1)(305/103) + (3)(285/93)
1 + 1 + 3
× 99.2 = 296.
Now, if the index in 2016, for example, is estimated to be 327, it is a simple matter
to determine the corresponding 2016 prices of gasoline from ¯I2014 = 296:
Premium: 315 cents/gal

= 315 cents/gal.
Many indexes are periodically published, including the Engineering News
Record Construction Index (www.enr.com), which incorporates labor and material
costs and the Marshall and Swift cost index.
3.3.2
Unit Technique
The unit technique involves using a per unit factor that can be estimated effectively.
Examples are as follows:
1. Capital cost of plant per kilowatt of capacity
2. Revenue per mile
3. Capital cost per installed telephone
4. Revenue per customer served
5. Temperature loss per 1,000 feet of steam pipe
6. Operating cost per mile
7. Construction cost per square foot
Such factors, when multiplied by the appropriate unit, give a total estimate of cost,
savings, or revenue.
As a simple example of the unit technique, suppose the Air Force’s B-2 aircraft
costs $68,000 per hour to own, operate, and maintain. A certain mission requires
two B-2 aircrafts to ﬂy a total round-trip time of 45 hours. Thus, the total cost of
this mission is (2 planes) (45 hours per mission per plane) ($68,000 per hour) =
$6,120,000 per mission.
While the unit technique is very useful for preliminary estimating purposes,
such average values can be misleading. In general, more detailed methods will
result in greater estimation accuracy.
3.3.3
Factor Technique
The factor technique is an extension of the unit method in which we sum the product
of several quantities or components and add these to any components estimated
directly. That is,
C =
#
d
Cd +
#
m
fmUm,
(3-3)

82
CHAPTER 3 / COST-ESTIMATION TECHNIQUES
where
C = cost being estimated;
Cd = cost of the selected component d that is estimated directly;
fm = cost per unit of component m;
Um = number of units of component m.
As a simple example, suppose that we need a slightly reﬁned estimate of the
cost of a house consisting of 2,000 square feet, two porches, and a garage.
Using a unit factor of $85 per square foot, $10,000 per porch, and $8,000 per
garage for the two directly estimated components, we can calculate the total
estimate as
($10,000 × 2) + $8,000 + ($85 × 2,000) = $198,000.
The factor technique is particularly useful when the complexity of the
estimatingsituationdoesnotrequireaWBS,butseveraldifferentpartsareinvolved.
Example 3-5 and the cost-estimating example to be presented in Section 3.5 further
illustrate this technique.
EXAMPLE 3-5
Analysis of Building Space Cost Estimates
The detailed design of the commercial building described in Example 3-2 affects
the utilization of the gross square feet (and, thus, the net rentable space)
available on each ﬂoor. Also, the size and location of the parking lot and the
prime road frontage available along the property may offer some additional
revenue sources. As project manager, analyze the potential revenue impacts of
the following considerations.
The ﬁrst ﬂoor of the building has 15,000 gross square feet of retail
space, and the second ﬂoor has the same amount planned for ofﬁce use.
Based on discussions with the sales staff, develop the following additional
information:
(a) The retail space should be designed for two different uses—60% for a
restaurant operation (utilization = 79%, yearly rent = $23/sq.ft.) and 40%
for a retail clothing store (utilization = 83%, yearly rent = $18/sq.ft.).
(b) There is a high probability that all the ofﬁce space on the second ﬂoor will
be leased to one client (utilization = 89%, yearly rent = $14/sq.ft.).
(c) An estimated 20 parking spaces can be rented on a long-term basis to two
existing businesses that adjoin the property. Also, one spot along the road
frontage can be leased to a sign company, for erection of a billboard, without
impairing the primary use of the property.
Solution
Based on this information, you estimate annual project revenue ( ˆR) as
ˆR = W(r1)(12) + ϒ(r2)(12) +
3
!
j=1
Sj(uj)(dj),

SECTION 3.4 / PARAMETRIC COST ESTIMATING 83
where W = number of parking spaces;
ϒ = number of billboards;
r1 = rate per month per parking space = $22;
r2 = rate per month per billboard = $65;
j = index of type of building space use;
Sj = space (gross square feet) being used for purpose j;
uj = space j utilization factor (% net rentable);
dj = rate per (rentable) square foot per year of building space used
for purpose j.
Then,
ˆR = [20($22)(12) + 1($65)(12)] + [9,000(0.79)($23)
+ 6,000(0.83)($18) + 15,000(0.89)($14)]
ˆR = $6,060 + $440,070 = $446,130.
A breakdown of the annual estimated project revenue shows that
1.4% is from miscellaneous revenue sources;
98.6% is from leased building space.
From a detailed design perspective, changes in annual project revenue due
to changes in building space utilization factors can be easily calculated. For
example, an average 1% improvement in the ratio of rentable space to gross
square feet would change the annual revenue (" ˆR) as follows:
" ˆR =

j=1
Sj(uj + 0.01)(dj) −($446,130 −$6,060)

= $5,250 per year.
3.4
Parametric Cost Estimating
Parametric cost estimating is the use of historical cost data and statistical techniques
to predict future costs. Statistical techniques are used to develop cost estimating
relationships (CERs) that tie the cost or price of an item (e.g., a product, good,
service, or activity) to one or more independent variables (i.e., cost drivers). Recall
from Chapter 2 that cost drivers are design variables that account for a large
portion of total cost behavior. Table 3-1 lists a variety of items and associated cost
drivers. The unit technique described in the previous section is a simple example
of parametric cost estimating.
Parametric models are used in the early design stages to get an idea of
how much the product (or project) will cost, on the basis of a few physical
attributes (such as weight, volume, and power). The output of the parametric

models (an estimated cost) is used to gauge the impact of design decisions on the
total cost.
Various statistical and other mathematical techniques are used to develop
the CERs. For example, simple linear regression and multiple linear regression
models, which are standard statistical methods for estimating the value of
a dependent variable (the unknown quantity) as a function of one or more
independent variables, are often used to develop estimating relationships. This
section describes two commonly used estimating relationships, the power-sizing
technique and the learning curve, followed by an overview of the procedure used
to develop CERs.
3.4.1
Power-Sizing Technique
The power-sizing technique, which is sometimes referred to as an exponential model,
is frequently used for developing capital investment estimates for industrial plants
and equipment. This CER recognizes that cost varies as some power of the change
in capacity or size. That is,
CA
CB

!SA
SB
"X
,
CA = CB
!SA

,
(3-4)
where
CA = cost for plant A
CB = cost for plant B
# (both in $ as of the point in
time for which the estimate is
desired);
SA = size of plant A
SB = size of plant B
#
(both in same physical units);
X = cost-capacity factor to reﬂect economies of scale.∗
∗This may be calculated or estimated from experience by using statistical techniques. For typical factors, see
W. R. Park, Cost Engineering Analysis (New York: John Wiley & Sons, 1973), p. 137.

SECTION 3.4 / PARAMETRIC COST ESTIMATING 85
The value of the cost-capacity factor will depend on the type of plant or equipment
being estimated. For example, X = 0.68 for nuclear generating plants and 0.79
for fossil-fuel generating plants. Note that X < 1 indicates decreasing economies
of scale (each additional unit of capacity costs less than the previous unit), X > 1∗
indicates increasing economies of scale (each additional unit of capacity costs more
than the previous unit), and X = 1 indicates a linear cost relationship with size.
EXAMPLE 3-6
Power-Sizing Model for Cost Estimating
Suppose that an aircraft manufacturer desires to make a preliminary estimate of
the cost of building a 600-MW fossil-fuel plant for the assembly of its new long-
distance aircraft. It is known that a 200-MW plant cost $100 million 20 years ago
when the approximate cost index was 400, and that cost index is now 1,200. The
cost-capacity factor for a fossil-fuel power plant is 0.79.
Solution
Before using the power-sizing model to estimate the cost of the 600-MW plant
(CA), we must ﬁrst use the cost index information to update the known cost of
the 200-MW plant 20 years ago to a current cost. Using Equation (3-1), we ﬁnd
that the current cost of a 200-MW plant is
CB = $100 million
!1,200
400
"
= $300 million.
So, using Equation (3-4), we obtain the following estimate for the 600-MW plant:
CA = $300 million
!600-MW
200-MW
"0.79
CA = $300 million × 2.38 = $714 million.
Note that Equation (3-4) can be used to estimate the cost of a larger plant (as
in Example 3-6) or the cost of a smaller plant. For example, suppose we need to
estimate the cost of building a 100-MW plant. Using Equation (3-4) and the data
for the 200-MW plant in Example 3-6, we ﬁnd that the current cost of a 100-MW
plant is
CA = $300 million
!100 MW
200 MW
"0.79
CA = $300 million × 0.58 = $174 million.
Cost-capacity factors can also have a role in ﬁguring the costs associated with
environmental cleanup. The cost of cleaning up an oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico
is $10 billion when the spilled oil amounts to 18 million gallons. The cleanup cost
is $14 billion when the amount of spilled oil is 32 million gallons. We can use

more than four quarter-carat diamonds.

3.4.2
Learning and Improvement
A learning curve is a mathematical model that explains the phenomenon of
increased worker efﬁciency and improved organizational performance with
repetitive production of a good or service. The learning curve is sometimes
called an experience curve or a manufacturing progress function; fundamentally, it
is an estimating relationship. The learning (improvement) curve effect was ﬁrst
observed in the aircraft and aerospace industries with respect to labor hours
per unit. However, it applies in many different situations. For example, the
learning curve effect can be used in estimating the professional hours expended
by an engineering staff to accomplish successive detailed designs within a family
of products, as well as in estimating the labor hours required to assemble
automobiles.
The basic concept of learning curves is that some input resources (e.g.,
energy costs, labor hours, material costs, engineering hours) decrease, on a per-
output-unit basis, as the number of units produced increases. Most learning curves
are based on the assumption that a constant percentage reduction occurs in, say,
labor hours, as the number of units produced is doubled. For example, if 100 labor
hours are required to produce the ﬁrst output unit and a 90% learning curve is
assumed, then 100(0.9) = 90 labor hours would be required to produce the second
unit. Similarly, 100(0.9)2 = 81 labor hours would be needed to produce the fourth
unit, 100(0.9)3 = 72.9 hours to produce the eighth unit, and so on. Therefore, a 90%
learning curve results in a 10% reduction in labor hours each time the production
quantity is doubled.
Equation (3-5) can be used to compute resource requirements assuming a
constant percentage reduction in input resources each time the output quantity
is doubled.
Zu = K(un),
(3-5)
where u = the output unit number;
Zu = the number of input resource units needed to produce output unit u;
K = the number of input resource units needed to produce the ﬁrst
output unit;
s = the learning curve slope parameter expressed as a decimal
(s = 0.9 for a 90% learning curve);
n = log s
log 2 = the learning curve exponent.

that as output is doubled, their time to assemble a car is reduced by 20%. Use this
information to determine
(a) the time it will take the team to assemble the 10th car.
(b) the total time required to assemble the ﬁrst 10 cars.
(c) the estimated cumulative average assembly time for the ﬁrst 10 cars.
Solve by hand and by spreadsheet.
Solution by Hand
(a) From Equation (3-5), and assuming a proportional decrease in assembly time
for output units between doubled quantities, we have

Cx = Tx/x.
(3-7)
Using Equation (3-7), we get
C10 = T10/10 = 631/10 = 63.1 hours.
Spreadsheet Solution
Figure 3-6 shows the spreadsheet solution for this example problem. For each
unit number, the unit time to complete the assembly, the cumulative total time,
and the cumulative average time are computed with the use of Equations (3-5),

of the spreadsheet and are then simply copied into rows 7 through 15.
A plot of unit time and cumulative average time is easily created with the
spreadsheet software. This spreadsheet model can be used to examine the impact
of a different learning slope parameter (e.g., s = 90%) on predicted car assembly
times by changing the value of cell B2.
3.4.3
Developing a Cost Estimating Relationship (CER)
A CER is a mathematical model that describes the cost of an engineering project
as a function of one or more design variables. CERs are useful tools because they
allow the estimator to develop a cost estimate quickly and easily. Furthermore,
estimates can be made early in the design process before detailed information is
available. As a result, engineers can use CERs to make early design decisions that
are cost effective in addition to meeting technical requirements.
There are four basic steps in developing a CER:
1. Problem deﬁnition
2. Data collection and normalization
3. CER equation development
4. Model validation and documentation
3.4.3.1
Problem Deﬁnition The ﬁrst step in any engineering analysis is to
deﬁne the problem to be addressed. A well-deﬁned problem is much easier to
solve. For the purposes of cost estimating, developing a WBS is an excellent way of
describing the elements of the problem. A review of the completed WBS can also
help identify potential cost drivers for the development of CERs.
3.4.3.2
Data Collection and Normalization The collection and normaliza-
tion of data is the most critical step in the development of a CER. We’re all familiar
with the adage “garbage in—garbage out.” Without reliable data, the cost estimates
obtained by using the CER would be meaningless. The WBS is also helpful in the
data collection phase. The WBS helps to organize the data and ensure that no
elements are overlooked.
Data can be obtained from both internal and external sources. Costs of similar
projects in the past are one source of data. Published cost information is another
source of data. Once collected, data must be normalized to account for differences
due to inﬂation, geographical location, labor rates, and so on. For example, cost
indexes or the price inﬂation techniques to be described in Chapter 8 can be used
to normalize costs that occurred at different times. Consistent deﬁnition of the data
is another important part of the normalization process.
3.4.3.3
CER Equation Development The next step in the development of a
CER is to formulate an equation that accurately captures the relationship between

the selected cost driver(s) and project cost. Table 3-2 lists four general equation
types commonly used in CER development. In these equations, b0, b1, b2, and b3
are constants, while x1, x2, and x3 represent design variables.
A simple, yet very effective, way to determine an appropriate equation form
for the CER is to plot the data. If a plot of the data on regular graph paper appears to
follow a straight line, then a linear relationship is suggested. If a curve is suggested,
then try plotting the data on semilog or log-log paper. If a straight line results on
semilog paper, then the relationship is logarithmic or exponential. If a straight line
results on log-log paper, then the relationship is a power curve.
Once we have determined the basic equation form for the CER, the next step is
to determine the values of the coefﬁcients in the CER equation. The most common
technique used to solve for the coefﬁcient values is the method of least squares.
Basically, this method seeks to determine a straight line through the data that
minimizes the total deviation of the actual data from the predicted values. (The line
itself represents the CER.) This method is relatively easy to apply manually and is
also available in many commercial software packages. (Most spreadsheet packages
are capable of performing a least-squares ﬁt of data.) The primary requirement for
the use of the least-squares method is a linear relationship between the independent
variable (the cost driver) and the dependent variable (project cost).∗
All of the equation forms presented in Table 3-2 can easily be transformed into
a linear form. The following equations can be used to calculate the values of the
coefﬁcients b0 and b1 in the simple linear equation y = b0 + b1x:
b1 =

(3-9)
Note that the variable n in the foregoing equations is equal to the number of data
sets used to estimate the values of b0 and b1.
∗In addition, the observations should be independent. The difference between predicted and actual values is assumed
to be normally distributed with an expected value of zero. Furthermore, the variance of the dependent variable is
assumed to be equal for each value of the independent variable.

SECTION 3.4 / PARAMETRIC COST ESTIMATING 91
EXAMPLE 3-8
Cost Estimating Relationship (CER) for a Spacecraft
In the early stages of design, it is believed that the cost of a Martian rover
spacecraft is related to its weight. Cost and weight data for six spacecraft have
been collected and normalized and are shown in the next table. A plot of the
data suggests a linear relationship. Use a spreadsheet model to determine the
values of the coefﬁcients for the CER.

in spreadsheet regression lies in making sure that the underlying regression
assumptions are satisﬁed and in interpreting the output properly.
The Tools | Data Analysis | Regression menu command brings up the Reg-
ression dialog box shown in Figure 3-7(a) and shows the values used for
this model. The results of the analysis are generated by Excel and are
displayed beginning in cell A9 of Figure 3-7(b). For the purposes of this
example, the coefﬁcients b0 and b1 of the CER are found in cells B25 and B26,
respectively.

SECTION 3.4 / PARAMETRIC COST ESTIMATING 93
The resulting CER relating spacecraft cost (in millions of dollars) to space-
craft weight is
Cost = 48.28 + 0.6597x,
where x represents the weight of the spacecraft in pounds, and 400 ≤x ≤1,200.
3.4.3.4
Model Validation and Documentation Once the CER equation has
been developed, we need to determine how well the CER can predict cost (i.e.,
model validation) and document the development and appropriate use of the
CER. Validation can be accomplished with statistical “goodness of ﬁt” measures
such as standard error and the correlation coefﬁcient. Analysts must use goodness
of ﬁt measures to infer how well the CER predicts cost as a function of the
selected cost driver(s). Documenting the development of the CER is important
for future use of the CER. It is important to include in the documentation
the data used to develop the CER and the procedures used for normalizing
the data.
The standard error (SE) measures the average amount by which the actual cost
values and the predicted cost values vary. The SE is calculated by

(3-10)
where Costi is the cost predicted by using the CER with the independent
variable values for data set i and yi is the actual cost. A small value of SE is
preferred.
The correlation coefﬁcient (R) measures the closeness of the actual data points
to the regression line (y = b0 + b1x). It is simply the ratio of explained deviation to
total deviation.

as the sign of the slope (b1) of the regression line. Values of R close to one (or minus
one) are desirable in that they indicate a strong linear relationship between the
dependent and independent variables.
In cases where it is not clear which is the “best” cost driver to select or which
equation form is best, you can use the goodness of ﬁt measures to make a selection.

EXAMPLE 3-9
Regression Statistics for the Spacecraft CER
Determine the SE and the correlation coefﬁcient for the CER developed in
Example 3-8.
Solution
From the spreadsheet for Example 3-8 (Figure 3-7), we ﬁnd that the SE is 41.35
(cell B15) and that the correlation coefﬁcient is 0.985 (cell B12). The value of
the correlation coefﬁcient is close to one, indicating a strong positive linear
relationship between the cost of the spacecraft and the spacecraft’s weight.
In summary, CERs are useful for a number of reasons. First, given the required
input data, they are quick and easy to use. Second, a CER usually requires very
little detailed information, making it possible to use the CER early in the design
process. Finally, a CER is an excellent predictor of cost if correctly developed from
good historical data.

CASE STUDY—Demanufacturing of Computers
Let’s consider a case that deals with a timely and important issue concerning
environmental economics. What are companies to do with all of the old computers
that typically accumulate at their facilities?
As one possible solution to this problem, a number of states and companies
have jointly established “resource recovery” facilities to process the handling of
old electronic equipment, such as used computers. Demanufacturing of com-
puters involves disassembly, refurbishing, and either donating or reselling the
units. However, there are some residuals, or remaining components, that cannot
be reused, are harmful to the environment, and contribute to the cost of demanu-
facturing.
Let’s consider the case of one resource recovery center in the Northeast that
currently handles approximately 2,000 computers per year. Of these computers,
approximately 50% are refurbished and donated, 40% are remanufactured and
resold, and 10% are “residuals.” What to do with the residuals is a challenging
problem.
The facility currently has a contract with an outside source to take the monitors
and CPUs. This leads to storage requirements in their facility, and there are issues
concerning the determination of the optimal truckload capacity. The labor costs for
the outside contractor are $10.00 per unit, and transportation costs are $1.70 per
unit, for a total of $11.70 per unit, based on a full capacity truck load.
The recovery facility is seeking an alternative solution to the handling of
residuals. One alternative under consideration is to establish a method for demanu-
facturing of the computers that will consider the CPUs only, since there are
environmental issues associated with computer monitors.
The recovery facility recently completed a work measurement study to develop
a method for demanufacture of the CPUs. The method is as follows:

SECTION 3.5 / CASE STUDY—DEMANUFACTURING OF COMPUTERS 95
1. Remove fasteners or screws.
2. Remove metal casing.
3. Remove power and data cables from CD drive.
4. Unfasten CD drive.
5. Unfasten supporting bar.
6. Remove support and ﬂoppy drive.
7. Remove power and data cables from power supply.
8. Remove motherboard.
9. Unfasten and remove power supply.
10. Unfasten drive housing.
11. Remove rubber feet.
From the predetermined time study, it is determined that the demanufacturing rate
is 7.35 minutes/unit. The facility uses an internal labor rate of $12.00/hour, and it is
estimated that training costs for the demanufacturing method will be 10% of total
labor costs. Setup costs and transportation costs are estimated at 150% and 20%
of total labor costs, respectively. The facility’s goal is to demanufacture 200 units
during regular operations. Determine the estimated cost per unit for the proposed
demanufacturing method. What percentage reduction is this over the per unit cost
of using the outside contractor?
Solution
As one possible solution, the industrial engineer performs the following calcu-
lations. For 200 units, the labor quantity is estimated as
7.35 minutes/unit × 200 units = 1,470 minutes = 24.5 hours.
The engineer develops the cost template provided below:

CHAPTER 3 / COST-ESTIMATION TECHNIQUES
The per unit cost of the proposed internal demanufacturing method is $4.37,
while the per unit cost of using the outside contractor is $11.70. Should the pro-
posed demanufacturing method be adopted, the estimated per unit cost savings is
$7.33 for a 62.6% reduction over the per unit cost for the outside contractor.
This case illustrates that developing creative solutions for internal demanu-
facturing methods not only results in cost savings of approximately 63% from
current practices for the case company, but proper demanufacturing methods will

Electronic Spreadsheet Modeling: Learning Curve
Regardless of its form, modeling is an integral part of every engineering discipline.
It is important to establish good skills early in your career and then to continually
reﬁne them as you gain experience. Using the guidelines in Appendix A and
the learning curve formulation in Equation (3-5), we will illustrate the electronic
spreadsheet modeling process. This simple spreadsheet can stand on its own or be
incorporated into a work breakdown structure as part of a more detailed estimate.
Spreadsheet modeling begins by identifying the decision criteria, the funda-
mental relationships deﬁning the decision criteria, the parameter values required in
the equations, and then creating an infrastructure within the worksheet to support
these calculations and present the results. Agood model should make it easy for the
user to know what input is required, where it goes, and where to ﬁnd the results.
Equation (3-5) contains four parameters and one intermediate calculation. For
maximum ﬂexibility, we will allow the user to provide any three parameters, and
the model will return the value for the unspeciﬁed parameter. Basic algebraic
manipulation is used to create three additional equations, resulting in one equation
for each of the parameters.
The preliminary model is shown in Figure 3-8. Column A identiﬁes the four
parameters that can be estimated and the intermediate calculation for n, column B
holds the user-speciﬁed values for the parameters, and column C contains the
equations for the ﬁnal result. We will solve for Zu to validate the model by providing
parameter values for K, s, and u in column B.
Figure 3-8
Preliminary Learning
Curve Model

SECTION 3.6 / ELECTRONIC SPREADSHEET MODELING: LEARNING CURVE 97
Once the infrastructure is created, we enter the equations. The intermediate
equation for the learning curve exponent, n, is in cell B8:
= LOG(B5)/LOG(2)
We could have incorporated this calculation directly into each of the equations
in column C, but it is better to separate intermediate calculations to aid in
troubleshooting and validating the model.
The newly derived learning curve equations are inserted in column C. For
example, cell C4 is:
= B7/(B6^B8)
The other equations go into cells C5, C6, and C7. Note the results of these equations:
cell C4 displays the value 0, which conﬂicts with the value of 100 speciﬁed in cell B4.
Cells C5 and C6 return the error code #NUM!, indicating an invalid parameter value
in each formula. In both cases, the formula is trying to evaluate log(0) because cell
B7 is blank. In this format, the answer in cell C7 is difﬁcult to spot.
Model usability is improved by adding an IF function to each equation in
column C to check if the corresponding cell in column B is blank. Recall that the user
can enter three of the four parameters, and the model will solve for the unspeciﬁed
parameter. The modiﬁed equation for cell C4 is shown below. The IF function
returns the equation result if cell B4 is empty, or a blank (indicated by the two
consecutive double quotes) if B4 contains a value. This approach eliminates the
conﬂicting values and error codes.
= IF(ISBLANK(B4),B7/(B6^B9),””)
Model usability is further enhanced with some simple formatting. We add a title
for the parameter names and then set the column titles Parameters, Value, and
RESULT in bold and center them for emphasis. The last header is in uppercase
for additional emphasis. The parameter names are added in column A, in addition
to their symbols, and the names are right justiﬁed with a trailing equal sign to
further link them to the adjacent column values.
The value cells are outlined to clearly delineate them from their names in
column A. The result area in column C is shaded, and the corresponding color used
in the column title. Finally, a key is provided at the bottom of the spreadsheet for
additional clariﬁcation. The revised spreadsheet is in Figure 3-9. The ﬁnal answer
is now obvious.
Signiﬁcant digits play a critical role in estimation. Implied precision through
extraneous digits is very common in spreadsheet modeling. Indeed, our answer
implies that we are capable of measuring time to the nearest millionth of an hour.
Our next enhancement is to incorporate a mechanism for specifying the number
of signiﬁcant digits in the result. For additional emphasis, the input cell for the
number of digits is placed at the top of the model, still using column B as the input
region. The column C results are retained, since these values may be intermediate
calculations in a larger model.
Spreadsheet software contains a wealth of guidance for using functions and
improving usability. Microsoft Excel help provides an approach for incorporating

98
CHAPTER 3 / COST-ESTIMATION TECHNIQUES

Revised Learning
Curve Spreadsheet Model
signiﬁcant digits in our answer. The newly revised formula in cell D6 is shown
below.
= IF(ISBLANK(B6),ROUND(C6,$B$3-LEN(INT(C6))),””)
The equation in C6 still provides the actual calculation; cell D6 simply reports
this result to the number of signiﬁcant digits speciﬁed in cell B3. This approach
reduces the length of the equation in D6, making troubleshooting easier. The
ISBLANK function is retained so that only one cell in column D displays results.
The ROUND function uses the number of signiﬁcant digits speciﬁed in B3 and
the number of digits in the initial answer to provide the ﬁnal answer with the
appropriate number of signiﬁcant digits. The dollar signs in the B3 cell address
represent absolute addressing, as described in Appendix A. The ﬁnal model is
shown in Figure 3-10.
We see that modeling is an iterative process—we begin with the basics, validate
the results by hand, then enhance the results for usability. The level of sophistication
is a function of how often the model will be used and who will be using it.

Summary
Developing the cash ﬂow for each alternative in a study is a pivotal, and usually the
most difﬁcult, step in the engineering economic analysis procedure. An integrated
approach for developing cash ﬂows includes three major components: (1) a WBS
deﬁnition of the project, (2) a cost and revenue structure that identiﬁes all the
cost and revenue elements involved in the study, and (3) estimating techniques
(models).
Estimating techniques (models) are used to develop the cash ﬂows for the
alternatives as they are deﬁned by the WBS. Thus, the estimating techniques form
a bridge between the WBS and detailed cost and revenue data and the estimated
cash ﬂows for the alternatives.
The results of the cost-estimating process are a set of cash ﬂows for a proposed
engineering project. Since these cash ﬂows will occur at different points in time
over the life cycle of the project, Chapter 4 will demonstrate how to account for the
time value of money in our analysis. Then, in Chapter 5, we will learn procedures
for determining the proﬁtability, or economic feasibility, of the proposed project.

boiler (1.2) and boiler support system (1.3) cost $110
million. The cost index for boilers was 110 in 1993,
it is 492 in 2016. The cost capacity factor for similar

CHAPTER 4
The Time Value of Money
The primary focus of Chapter 4 is to explain time value of money
calculations and to illustrate economic equivalence.
Crisis in the Gulf
H
ow vividly do you remember the biggest man-made envi-
ronmental catastrophe in American history—millions of
gallons of oil ﬂowing unchecked into the Gulf of Mexico from
an undersea well? In response to this tragedy, British Petroleum (BP) will make
payments into a fund to pay for some of the damages to the Gulf Coast resulting
from their massive oil spill in April and following months of 2010. BP will pay
$3 billion at the end of the third quarter of 2010 and another $2 billion in the
fourth quarter of 2010. BP will then make payments of $1.25 billion each quarter
thereafter until a total of $20 billion has been paid into the fund. If the opportunity
cost of capital (interest rate) is 3% per quarter, what is the equivalent value of this
payment stream at the beginning of the third quarter of 2010? This is one type of
problem you can answer after studying Chapter 4. We will return to this problem
in Example 4-18.
107

If you would know the value of money, go and try to borrow some.
—Benjamin Franklin
4.1 Introduction
The term capital refers to wealth in the form of money or property that can be used
to produce more wealth. The majority of engineering economy studies involve
commitment of capital for extended periods of time, so the effect of time must be
considered. In this regard, it is recognized that a dollar today is worth more than
a dollar one or more years from now because of the interest (or proﬁt) it can earn.
Therefore, money has a time value. It has been said that often the riskiest thing a
person can do with money is nothing! Money has value, and if money remains
uninvested (like in a large bottle), value is lost. Money changes in value not only
becauseofinterestrates(Chapter4)—inﬂation(ordeﬂation)andcurrencyexchange
rates also cause money to change in value. The latter two topics will be discussed
in Chapter 8.
4.1.1
Why Consider Return to Capital?
There are fundamental reasons why return to capital in the form of interest and
proﬁt is an essential ingredient of engineering economy studies. First, interest
and proﬁt pay the providers of capital for forgoing its use during the time the
capital is being used. The fact that the supplier can realize a return on capital
acts as an incentive to accumulate capital by savings, thus postponing immediate
consumption in favor of creating wealth in the future. Second, interest and proﬁt
are payments for the risk the investor takes in permitting another person, or an
organization, to use his or her capital.
In typical situations, investors must decide whether the expected return on
their capital is sufﬁcient to justify buying into a proposed project or venture. If
capital is invested in a project, investors would expect, as a minimum, to receive a
return at least equal to the amount they have sacriﬁced by not using it in some other
available opportunity of comparable risk. This interest or proﬁt available from
an alternative investment is the opportunity cost of using capital in the proposed
undertaking. Thus, whether borrowed capital or equity capital is involved, there
is a cost for the capital employed in the sense that the project and venture must
provide a sufﬁcient return to be ﬁnancially attractive to suppliers of money or
property.
In summary, whenever capital is required in engineering and other business
projects and ventures, it is essential that proper consideration be given to its cost
(i.e., time value). The remainder of this chapter deals with time value of money
principles, which are vitally important to the proper evaluation of engineering
projects that form the foundation of a ﬁrm’s competitiveness, and hence to its very
survival.

SECTION 4.2 / SIMPLE INTEREST 109
4.1.2
The Origins of Interest
Like taxes, interest has existed from earliest recorded human history. Records reveal
its existence in Babylon in 2000 b.c. In the earliest instances, interest was paid in
money for the use of grain or other commodities that were borrowed; it was also
paid in the form of grain or other goods. Many existing interest practices stem from
early customs in the borrowing and repayment of grain and other crops.
History also reveals that the idea of interest became so well established that a
ﬁrm of international bankers existed in 575 b.c., with home ofﬁces in Babylon. The
ﬁrm’s income was derived from the high interest rates it charged for the use of its
money for ﬁnancing international trade.
Throughout early recorded history, typical annual rates of interest on loans of
money were in the neighborhood of 6% to 25%, although legally sanctioned rates as
high as 40% were permitted in some instances. The charging of exorbitant interest
rates on loans was termed usury, and prohibition of usury is found in the Bible.
(See Exodus 22: 21–27.)
During the Middle Ages, interest taking on loans of money was generally
outlawed on scriptural grounds. In 1536, the Protestant theory of usury was
established by John Calvin, and it refuted the notion that interest was unlawful.
Consequently, interest taking again became viewed as an essential and legal part
of doing business. Eventually, published interest tables became available to the
public.
4.2
Simple Interest
When the total interest earned or charged is linearly proportional to the initial
amount of the loan (principal), the interest rate, and the number of interest periods
for which the principal is committed, the interest and interest rate are said to be
simple. Simple interest is not used frequently in modern commercial practice.
When simple interest is applicable, the total interest, I , earned or paid may be
computed using the formula
I = (P)(N)(i),
(4-1)
where
P = principal amount lent or borrowed;
N = number of interest periods (e.g., years);
i = interest rate per interest period.
The total amount repaid at the end of N interest periods is P + I. Thus, if $1,000
were loaned for three years at a simple interest rate of 10% per year, the interest
earned would be
I = $1,000 × 3 × 0.10 = $300.
The total amount owed at the end of three years would be $1,000 + $300 = $1,300.
Notice that the cumulative amount of interest owed is a linear function of time
until the principal (and interest) is repaid (usually not until the end of period N).

110
CHAPTER 4 / THE TIME VALUE OF MONEY
The Importance of Interest in Your Daily Life
In 2005, total debt (credit cards, auto loans, home mortgages, etc.) amounted
to more than 100% of total disposable income for the average U.S. household. If
your total disposable income is $50,000, how much interest can you expect to
pay when the average interest rate on your debt is 12% per year?
Answer: You can expect to pay $50,000 (0.12) = $6,000 per year!
4.3
Compound Interest
Whenever the interest charge for any interest period (a year, for example) is based
on the remaining principal amount plus any accumulated interest charges up
to the beginning of that period, the interest is said to be compound. The effect of
compounding of interest can be seen in the following table for $1,000 loaned for
three periods at an interest rate of 10% compounded each period:
(1)
(2) = (1) × 10%
(3) = (1) + (2)

$1,100
2
$1,100
$110
$1,210
3
$1,210
$121
$1,331
As you can see, a total of $1,331 would be due for repayment at the end of the third
period. If the length of a period is one year, the $1,331 at the end of three periods
(years) can be compared with the $1,300 given earlier for the same problem with
simple interest. A graphical comparison of simple interest and compound interest
is given in Figure 4-1. The difference is due to the effect of compounding, which is
essentially the calculation of interest on previously earned interest. This difference
would be much greater for larger amounts of money, higher interest rates, or greater
numbers of interest periods. Thus, simple interest does consider the time value
of money but does not involve compounding of interest. Compound interest is
much more common in practice than simple interest and is used throughout the
remainder of this book.
4.4
The Concept of Equivalence
Alternatives should be compared when they produce similar results, serve the same
purpose, or accomplish the same function. This is not always possible in some
types of economy studies (as we shall see later), but now our attention is directed
at answering the question: How can alternatives for providing the same service
or accomplishing the same function be compared when interest is involved over
extended periods of time? Thus, we should consider the comparison of alternative

options, or proposals, by reducing them to an equivalent basis that is dependent on
(1) the interest rate, (2) the amounts of money involved, and (3) the timing of the
monetary receipts or expenses.
To better understand the mechanics of interest and to explain the concept of
equivalence, suppose you have a $17,000 balance on your credit card. “This has
got to stop!” you say to yourself. So you decide to repay the $17,000 debt in four
months. An unpaid credit card balance at the beginning of a month will be charged
interest at the rate of 1% by your credit card company. For this situation, we have
selected three plans to repay the $17,000 principal plus interest owed.∗These three
plans are illustrated in Table 4-1, and we will demonstrate that they are equivalent
(i.e., the same) when the interest rate is 1% per month on the unpaid balance of
principal.
Plan 1 indicates that none of the principal is repaid until the end of the fourth
month. The monthly payment of interest is $170, and all of the principal is also
repaid at the end of month four. Because interest does not accumulate in Plan 1,
compounding of interest is not present in this situation. In Table 4-1, there are 68,000
dollar-months of borrowing ($17,000×4 months) and $680 total interest. Therefore,
the monthly interest rate is ($680 ÷ 68,000 dollar-months) × 100% = 1%.
Plan 2 stipulates that we repay $4,357.10 per month. Later we will show how
this number is determined (Section 4.9). For our purposes here, you should observe
that interest is being compounded and that the $17,000 principal is completely
repaid over the four months. From Table 4-1, you can see that the monthly interest
rate is ($427.10 ÷ 42,709.5 dollar-months of borrowing) × 100% = 1%. There are
fewer dollar-months of borrowing in Plan 2 (as compared with Plan 1) because
principal is being repaid every month and the total amount of interest paid ($427.10)
is less.
∗These repayment plans are for demonstration purposes only. It is very unlikely that a credit card company would
agree to either Plan 1 or Plan 3 without additional charges and/or damaging your credit history.

repaid. This includes the original principal and the accumulated (compounded)
interest of $690.27. The dollar-months of borrowing are very large for Plan 3
(69,026.8) because none of the principal and accumulated interest is repaid until
the end of the fourth month. Again, the ratio of total interest paid to dollar-months
is 0.01.
This brings us back to the concept of economic equivalence. If the interest rate
remains at 1% per month, you should be indifferent as to which plan you use to
repay the $17,000 to your credit card company. This assumes that you are charged
1% of the outstanding principal balance (which includes any unpaid interest) each
month for the next four months. If interest rates in the economy go up and increase
your credit card rate to say, 1 1
4% per month, the plans are no longer equivalent.
What varies among the three plans is the rate at which principal is repaid and how
interest is repaid.

Notation and Cash-Flow Diagrams and Tables
The following notation is utilized in formulas for compound interest calculations:
i = effective interest rate per interest period;
N = number of compounding (interest) periods;
P = present sum of money; the equivalent value of one or more cash ﬂows
at a reference point in time called the present;
F = future sum of money; the equivalent value of one or more cash ﬂows at
a reference point in time called the future;
A = end-of-period cash ﬂows (or equivalent end-of-period values) in a
uniform series continuing for a speciﬁed number of periods, starting
at the end of the ﬁrst period and continuing through the last period.
The use of cash-ﬂow (time) diagrams or tables is strongly recommended for
situations in which the analyst needs to clarify or visualize what is involved
when ﬂows of money occur at various times. In addition, viewpoint (remember
Principle 3?) is an essential feature of cash-ﬂow diagrams.
The difference between total cash inﬂows (receipts) and cash outﬂows (expen-
ditures) for a speciﬁed period of time (e.g., one year) is the net cash ﬂow for the
period. As discussed in Chapters 2 and 3, cash ﬂows are important in engineering
economy because they form the basis for evaluating alternatives. Indeed, the
usefulness of a cash-ﬂow diagram for economic analysis problems is analogous
to that of the free-body diagram for mechanics problems.
Figure 4-2 shows a cash-ﬂow diagram for Plan 3 of Table 4-1, and Figure 4-3
depicts the net cash ﬂows of Plan 2. These two ﬁgures also illustrate the deﬁnition
of the preceding symbols and their placement on a cash-ﬂow diagram. Notice that
all cash ﬂows have been placed at the end of the month to correspond with the
convention used in Table 4-1. In addition, a viewpoint has been speciﬁed.
The cash-ﬂow diagram employs several conventions:
1. The horizontal line is a time scale, with progression of time moving from left to
right. The period (e.g., year, quarter, month) labels can be applied to intervals of
time rather than to points on the time scale. Note, for example, that the end of
Period 2 is coincident with the beginning of Period 3. When the end-of-period
cash-ﬂow convention is used, period numbers are placed at the end of each time
interval, as illustrated in Figures 4-2 and 4-3.

2. The arrows signify cash ﬂows and are placed at the end of the period. If a
distinction needs to be made, downward arrows represent expenses (negative
cash ﬂows or cash outﬂows) and upward arrows represent receipts (positive
cash ﬂows or cash inﬂows).
3. The cash-ﬂow diagram is dependent on the point of view. For example, the
situations shown in Figures 4-2 and 4-3 were based on cash ﬂow as seen by
the lender (the credit card company). If the directions of all arrows had been
reversed, the problem would have been diagrammed from the borrower’s
viewpoint.
EXAMPLE 4-1
Cash-Flow Diagramming
Before evaluating the economic merits of a proposed investment, the XYZ
Corporation insists that its engineers develop a cash-ﬂow diagram of the
proposal. An investment of $10,000 can be made that will produce uniform
annual revenue of $5,310 for ﬁve years and then have a market (recovery) value
of $2,000 at the end of year (EOY) ﬁve. Annual expenses will be $3,000 at the
end of each year for operating and maintaining the project. Draw a cash-ﬂow
diagram for the ﬁve-year life of the project. Use the corporation’s viewpoint.
Solution
As shown in the ﬁgure below, the initial investment of $10,000 and annual
expenses of $3,000 are cash outﬂows, while annual revenues and the market
value are cash inﬂows.

form to facilitate the analysis of plans and designs.
EXAMPLE 4-2
Developing a Net Cash-Flow Table
In a company’s renovation of a small ofﬁce building, two feasible alternatives for
upgrading the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system have
been identiﬁed. Either Alternative A or Alternative B must be implemented. The
costs are as follows:
Alternative A
Rebuild (overhaul) the existing HVAC system
• Equipment, labor, and materials to rebuild . . . . . . . . . . .
$18,000
• Annual cost of electricity . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
32,000
• Annual maintenance expenses . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
2,400
Alternative B
Install a new HVAC system that utilizes existing ductwork
• Equipment, labor, and materials to install . . . . . . . . . . . .
$60,000
• Annual cost of electricity. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
9,000
• Annual maintenance expenses . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
16,000
• Replacement of a major component four years hence . .
9,400
At the end of eight years, the estimated market value for Alternative A is $2,000
and for Alternative B it is $8,000. Assume that both alternatives will provide
comparable service (comfort) over an eight-year period, and assume that the
major component replaced in Alternative B will have no market value at EOY
eight. (1) Use a cash-ﬂow table and end-of-year convention to tabulate the
net cash ﬂows for both alternatives. (2) Determine the annual net cash-ﬂow
difference between the alternatives (B −A).
Solution
The cash-ﬂow table (company’s viewpoint) for this example was developed by
using a spreadsheet and is shown in Figure 4-4. On the basis of these results,
several points can be made: (1) Doing nothing is not an option—either A or B
must be selected; (2) even though positive and negative cash ﬂows are included
in the table, on balance we are investigating two “cost-only” alternatives; (3) a
decision between the two alternatives can be made just as easily on the difference
in cash ﬂows (i.e., on the avoidable difference) as it can on the stand-alone net
cash ﬂows for Alternatives A and B; (4) Alternative B has cash ﬂows identical
to those of Alternative A, except for the differences shown in the table, so if the
avoidable difference can “pay its own way,” Alternative B is the recommended
choice; (5) cash-ﬂow changes caused by inﬂation or other suspected inﬂuences
could have easily been inserted into the table and included in the analysis; and

(This ignores the time value of money.) So, which alternative is better? We’ll be
able to answer this question later when we consider the time value of money in
order to recommend choices between alternatives.
Comment
Cash-ﬂow tables are invaluable when using a spreadsheet to model engineering
economy problems.
It should be apparent that a cash-ﬂow table clariﬁes the timing of cash ﬂows,
the assumptions that are being made, and the data that are available. A cash-ﬂow
table is often useful when the complexity of a situation makes it difﬁcult to show
all cash-ﬂow amounts on a diagram.
The remainder of Chapter 4 deals with the development and illustration
of equivalence (time value of money) principles for assessing the economic
attractiveness of investments, such as those proposed in Examples 4-1 and 4-2.
Viewpoint:
In most examples presented in this chapter,
the company’s
(investor’s) viewpoint will be taken.

SECTION 4.6 / RELATING PRESENT AND FUTURE EQUIVALENT VALUES OF SINGLE CASH FLOWS 117
4.6
Relating Present and Future Equivalent Values
of Single Cash Flows
Figure 4-5 shows a cash-ﬂow diagram involving a present single sum, P, and
a future single sum, F, separated by N periods with interest at i% per period.
Throughout this chapter, a dashed arrow, such as that shown in Figure 4-5, indicates
the quantity to be determined.
4.6.1
Finding F when Given P
If an amount of P dollars is invested at a point in time and i% is the interest (proﬁt
or growth) rate per period, the amount will grow to a future amount of P + Pi =
P(1 + i) by the end of one period; by the end of two periods, the amount will grow
to P(1 + i)(1 + i) = P(1 + i)2; by the end of three periods, the amount will grow to
P(1 + i)2(1 + i) = P(1 + i)3; and by the end of N periods the amount will grow to
F = P(1 + i)N.
(4-2)
EXAMPLE 4-3
Future Equivalent of a Present Sum
Suppose that you borrow $8,000 now, promising to repay the loan principal plus

P(1 + i)3 = $10,648
iP(1 + i)3 = $1,065
P(1 + i)4 = $11,713
F = $11,713
In general, we see that F = P(1+i)N, and the total amount to be repaid is $11,713.
The quantity (1 + i)N in Equation (4-2) is commonly called the single payment
compound amount factor. Numerical values for this factor are given in the second
column from the left in the tables of Appendix C for a wide range of values of
i and N. In this book, we shall use the functional symbol (F/P, i%, N) for (1 + i)N.
Hence, Equation (4-2) can be expressed as
F = P(F/P, i%, N).
(4-3)
where the factor in parentheses is read “ﬁnd F given P at i% interest per period
for N interest periods.” Note that the sequence of F and P in F/P is the same as in

the initial part of Equation (4-3), where the unknown quantity, F, is placed on the
left-hand side of the equation. This sequencing of letters is true of all functional
symbols used in this book and makes them easy to remember.
Let’s look at Example 4-3 again. Using Equation (4-3) and Appendix C, we
have
F = $8,000(F/P, 10%, 4)
= $8,000(1.4641)
= $11,713.
This, of course, is the same result obtained in Example 4-3 since (F/P, 10%, 4) =
(1 + 0.10)4 = 1.4641.
Another example of ﬁnding F when given P, together with a cash-ﬂow diagram
and solution, appears in Table 4-2. Note in Table 4-2 that, for each of the six common
discrete compound interest circumstances covered, two problem statements are
given—(1) in borrowing–lending terminology and (2) in equivalence terminology—but
they both represent the same cash-ﬂow situation. Indeed, there are generally many
ways in which a given cash-ﬂow situation can be expressed.
In general, a good way to interpret a relationship such as Equation (4-3) is that
the calculated amount, F, at the point in time at which it occurs, is equivalent to (i.e.,
can be traded for) the known value, P, at the point in time at which it occurs, for
the given interest or proﬁt rate, i.
4.6.2
Finding P when Given F
From Equation (4-2), F = P(1 + i)N. Solving this for P gives the relationship
P = F
!

"N
= F(1 + i)−N.

The quantity (1 + i)−N is called the single payment present worth factor. Numerical
values for this factor are given in the third column of the tables in Appendix C for

SECTION 4.6 / RELATING PRESENT AND FUTURE EQUIVALENT VALUES OF SINGLE CASH FLOWS 119
a wide range of values of i and N. We shall use the functional symbol (P/F, i%, N)
for this factor. Hence,
P = F(P/F, i%, N).
(4-5)
EXAMPLE 4-4
Present Equivalent of a Future Amount of Money
An investor (owner) has an option to purchase a tract of land that will be worth
$10,000 in six years. If the value of the land increases at 8% each year, how much
should the investor be willing to pay now for this property?
Solution
The purchase price can be determined from Equation (4-5) and Table C-11 in
Appendix C as follows:
P = $10,000(P/F, 8%, 6)
P = $10,000(0.6302)
= $6,302.
Another example of this type of problem, together with a cash-ﬂow diagram
and solution, is given in Table 4-2.
Based on Equations (4-2) and (4-4), the following three simple rules apply when
performing arithmetic calculations with cash ﬂows:
Rule A. Cash ﬂows cannot be added or subtracted unless they occur at the same
point in time.
Rule B. To move a cash ﬂow forward in time by one time unit, multiply the
magnitude of the cash ﬂow by (1 + i), where i is the interest rate that
reﬂects the time value of money.
Rule C. To move a cash ﬂow backward in time by one time unit, divide the
magnitude of the cash ﬂow by (1 + i).
4.6.3
Finding the Interest Rate Given P, F, and N
There are situations in which we know two sums of money (P and F) and how
much time separates them (N), but we don’t know the interest rate (i) that makes
them equivalent. For example, if we want to turn $500 into $1,000 over a period
of 10 years, at what interest rate would we have to invest it? We can easily solve
Equation (4-2) to obtain an expression for i.
i =
N!
F/P −1
(4-6)
So, for our simple example, i =
10!
$1,000/$500 −1 = 0.0718 or 7.18% per year.
Inﬂation is another example of when it may be necessary to solve for an interest
rate. Suppose you are interested in determining the annual rate of increase in the

CHAPTER 4 / THE TIME VALUE OF MONEY
price of gasoline. Given the average prices in different years, you can use the
relationship between P and F to solve for the inﬂation rate.
EXAMPLE 4-5
The Inﬂating Price of Gasoline
The average price of gasoline in 2005 was $2.31 per gallon. In 1993, the average
price was $1.07.∗What was the average annual rate of increase in the price of
gasoline over this 12-year period?
Solution
With respect to the year 1993, the year 2005 is in the future. Thus, P = $1.07, F =
$2.31, and N = 12. Using Equation (4-6), we ﬁnd i =
12√2.31/1.07 −1 = 0.0662
or 6.62% per year.
∗This data was obtained from the Energy Information Administration of the Department of Energy. Historical
prices of gasoline and other energy sources can be found at www.eia.doe.gov.
4.6.4
Finding N when Given P, F, and i
Sometimes we are interested in ﬁnding the amount of time needed for a present
sum to grow into a future sum at a speciﬁed interest rate. For example, how long
would it take for $500 invested today at 15% interest per year to be worth $1,000? We
can use the equivalence relationship given in Equation (4-2) to obtain an expression
for N.
F = P(1 + i)N
(1 + i)N = (F/P)
Using logarithms,
N log(1 + i) = log(F/P)
and
N = log(F/P)
log(1 + i).
(4-7)
For our simple example, N = log($1,000/$500)/ log(1.15) = 4.96 ∼= 5 years.
EXAMPLE 4-6
When Will Gasoline Cost $5.00 per Gallon?
In Example 4-5, the average price of gasoline was given as $2.31 in 2005. We
computed the average annual rate of increase in the price of gasoline to be 6.62%.
If we assume that the price of gasoline will continue to inﬂate at this rate, how
long will it be before we are paying $5.00 per gallon?

SECTION 4.7 / RELATING A UNIFORM SERIES (ANNUITY) TO ITS PRESENT AND FUTURE EQUIVALENT VALUES 123
Solution
We have P = $2.31, F = $5.00, and i = 6.62% per year. Using Equation (4-7), we
ﬁnd
N = log($5.00/$2.31)
log(1 + 0.0662) = log(2.1645)
log(1.0662) = 12.05 years.
So, if gasoline prices continue to increase at the same rate, we can expect to be
paying $5.00 per gallon in 2017.
4.7
Relating a Uniform Series (Annuity) to Its Present
and Future Equivalent Values
Figure 4-6 shows a general cash-ﬂow diagram involving a series of uniform (equal)
receipts, each of amount A, occurring at the end of each period for N periods with
interest at i% per period. Such a uniform series is often called an annuity. It should
be noted that the formulas and tables to be presented are derived such that A occurs
at the end of each period, and thus,
1. P (present equivalent value) occurs one interest period before the ﬁrst A
(uniform amount),
2. F (future equivalent value) occurs at the same time as the last A, and N periods
after P, and
3. A (annual equivalent value) occurs at the end of periods 1 through N, inclusive.
The timing relationship for P, A, and F can be observed in Figure 4-6. Four formulas
relating A to F and P will be developed.

+ A(F/P, i%, 1) + A(F/P, i%, 0)

The bracketed terms comprise a geometric sequence having a common ratio
of (1 + i)−1. Recall that the sum of the ﬁrst N terms of a geometric sequence is
SN = a1 −baN
1 −b
(b ̸= 1),
where a1 is the ﬁrst term in the sequence, aN is the last term, and b is the common
ratio. If we let b = (1 + i)−1, a1 = (1 + i)N−1, and aN = (1 + i)0, then

It is the starting point for developing the remaining three uniform series interest
factors.
Numerical values for the uniform series compound amount factor are given
in the fourth column of the tables in Appendix C for a wide range of values of
i and N. We shall use the functional symbol (F/A, i%, N) for this factor. Hence,
Equation (4-8) can be expressed as
F = A(F/A, i%, N).

Examples of this type of “wealth accumulation” problem based on the (F/A, i%, N)
factor are provided here and in Table 4-2.
EXAMPLE 4-7
Future Value of a College Degree
A recent government study reported that a college degree is worth an extra
$23,000 per year in income (A) compared to what a high-school graduate makes.
If the interest rate (i) is 6% per year and you work for 40 years (N), what is the
future compound amount (F) of this extra income?
Solution
The viewpoint we will use to solve this problem is that of “lending” the $23,000
of extra annual income to a savings account (or some other investment vehicle).
The future equivalent is the amount that can be withdrawn after the 40th deposit
is made.

The bottom line is “Get your college degree!”
EXAMPLE 4-8
Become a Millionaire by Saving $1.00 a Day!
To illustrate further the amazing effects of compound interest, we consider the
credibility of this statement: “If you are 20 years of age and save $1.00 each day
for the rest of your life, you can become a millionaire.” Let’s assume that you
live to age 80 and that the annual interest rate is 10% (i = 10%). Under these
speciﬁc conditions, we compute the future compound amount (F) to be
F = $365/year (F/A, 10%, 60 years)
= $365 (3,034.81)
= $1,107,706.
Thus, the statement is true for the assumptions given! The moral is to start saving
early and let the “magic” of compounding work on your behalf!
A few words to the wise: Saving money early and preserving resources through
frugality (avoiding waste) are extremely important ingredients of wealth creation
in general. Often, being frugal means postponing the satisfaction of immediate
material wants for the creation of a better tomorrow. In this regard, be very cautious
about spending tomorrow’s cash today by undisciplined borrowing (e.g., with
credit cards). The (F/A, i%, N) factor also demonstrates how fast your debt can
accumulate!

present worth factor. Numerical values for this factor are given in the ﬁfth column

functional symbol (P/A, i%, N) for this factor. Hence,
P = A(P/A, i%, N).

EXAMPLE 4-9
Present Equivalent of an Annuity (Uniform Series)
A micro-brewery is considering the installation of a newly designed boiler
system that burns the dried, spent malt and barley grains from the brewing
process. The boiler will produce process steam that powers the majority of the
brewery’s energy operations, saving $450,000 per year over the boiler’s expected
life of 10 years. If the interest rate is 12% per year, how much money can the
brewery afford to invest in the new boiler system?
Solution
In the cash ﬂow diagram below, notice that the affordable amount (i.e., the
present equivalent, P) occurs one time period (year) before the ﬁrst end-of-year
cash ﬂow of $450,000.

annual interest. The upper limit on what the brewery can afford to spend on the
new boiler is:
P = $450,000 (P/A, 12%, 10)
= $450,000 (5.6502)

EXAMPLE 4-10
How Much Is a Lifetime Oil Change Offer Worth?
“Make your best deal with us on a new automobile and we’ll change your oil for
free for as long as you own the car!” If you purchase a car from this dealership,
you expect to have four free oil changes per year during the ﬁve years you keep
the car. Each oil change would normally cost you $30. If you save your money
in a mutual fund earning 2% per quarter, how much are the oil changes worth
to you at the time you buy the car?
Solution
In this example, we need to ﬁnd the present equivalent of the cost of future
oil changes. The cash-ﬂow diagram is shown below. Notice that P occurs one
time period (a quarter of a year, in this example) before the ﬁrst oil change cash
ﬂow (A).

Now you are in a position to determine how great of a deal you are being offered.
If the best price of another dealership is more than $490.54 cheaper than what

the last period. The quantity in brackets is called the sinking fund factor. Numerical
values for this factor are given in the sixth column of the tables in Appendix C for
a wide range of values of i and N. We shall use the functional symbol (A/F, i%, N)
for this factor. Hence,
A = F(A/F, i%, N).

Another example of this type of problem, together with a cash-ﬂow diagram

An example that uses the equivalence between a present lump-sum loan
amount and a series of equal uniform monthly payments starting at the end of
month one and continuing through month four was provided in Table 4-1 as Plan 2.

calculator.

Relationship of Cash Flows for Plan 2 of Table 4-1 to Repayment
of the $17,000 Loan Principal
Equation (4-15) yields the equivalent value of A that repays the $17,000 loan plus
1% interest per month over four months:
A = $17,000(A/P, 1%, 4) = $17,000(0.2563) = $4,357.10
The entries in columns three and ﬁve of Plan 2 in Table 4-1 can now be better
understood. Interest owed at the end of month one equals $17,000(0.01), and
therefore the principal repaid out of the total end-of-month payment of $4,357.10
is the difference, $4,187.10. At the beginning of month two, the amount of prin-
cipal owed is $17,000 −$4,187.10 = $12,812.90. Interest owed at the end of
month two is $12,812.90(0.01) = $128.13, and the principal repaid at that time
is $4,357.10 −$128.13 = $4,228.97. The remaining entries in Plan 2 are obtained by
performing these calculations for months three and four.
A graphical summary of Plan 2 is given in Figure 4-7. Here it can be seen that
1% interest is being paid on the beginning-of-month amount owed and that month-
end payments of $4,357.10, consisting of interest and principal, bring the amount
owed to $0 at the end of the fourth month. (The exact value of A is $4,356.78 and
produces an exact value of $0 at the end of four months.) It is important to note
that all the uniform series interest factors in Table 4-2 involve the same concept as
the one illustrated in Figure 4-7.
EXAMPLE 4-11
Computing Your Monthly Car Payment

The amount of the car payment is easily calculated using Equation (4-15).

= $436.50 per month
Another example of a problem where we desire to compute an equivalent
value for A, from a given value of P and a known interest rate and number of
compounding periods, is given in Table 4-2.
For an annual interest rate of 10%, the reader should now be convinced from
Table 4-2 that $1,000 at the beginning of year one is equivalent to $187.45 at the
EOYs one through eight, which is then equivalent to $2,143.60 at EOY eight.
4.7.5
Finding the Number of Cash Flows in an Annuity
Given A, P, and i
Sometimes we may have information about a present amount of money (P), the
magnitude of an annuity (A), and the interest rate (i). The unknown factor in this
case is the number of cash ﬂows in the annuity (N).
EXAMPLE 4-12
Prepaying a Loan−−Finding N
Your company has a $100,000 loan for a new security system it just bought. The
annual payment is $8,880 and the interest rate is 8% per year for 30 years. Your
company decides that it can afford to pay $10,000 per year. After how many
payments (years) will the loan be paid off?

SECTION 4.7 / RELATING A UNIFORM SERIES (ANNUITY) TO ITS PRESENT AND FUTURE EQUIVALENT VALUES 131
Solution
The original loan payment was found using Equation (4-15).
A = $100,000 (A/P, 8%, 30) = $100,000 (0.0888) = $8,800 per year
Now, instead of paying $8,880 per year, your company is going to pay $10,000
per year. Common sense tells us that less than 30 payments will be necessary to
pay off the $100,000 loan. Using Equation (4-11), we ﬁnd
$100,000 = $10,000 (P/A, 8%, N)
(P/A, 8%, N) = 10.
We can now use the interest tables provided in Appendix C to ﬁnd N. Looking
down the Present Worth Factor column (P/A) of Table C-11, we see that
(P/A, 8%, 20) = 9.8181
and
(P/A, 8%, 21) = 10.0168.
So, if $10,000 is paid per year, the loan will be paid off after 21 years instead of
30. The exact amount of the 21st payment will be slightly less than $10,000 (but
we’ll save that solution for another example).
Spreadsheet Solution
ThereisaﬁnancialfunctioninExcelthatwouldallowustosolvefortheunknown
number of periods. NPER(rate, pmt, pv) will compute the number of payments
of magnitude pmt required to pay off a present amount (pv) at a ﬁxed interest
rate (rate).
N = NPER(0.08, −10000, 100000) = 20.91
Note that from your company’s viewpoint, it received $100,000 (a cash
inﬂow) at time 0 and is making $10,000 payments (cash outﬂows). Hence
the annuity is expressed as a negative number in NPER( ) and the present
amount as a positive number. If we were to reverse the signs—which would
represent the lender’s viewpoint—the same result would be obtained, namely
NPER(0.08, 10000, −100000) = 20.91.
Comment
Prepaying loans can save thousands of dollars in interest. For example, look at
the total interest paid under these two repayment plans.
Original payment plan ($8,880 per year for 30 years):
Total interest paid = $8,880 × 30 −$100,000 = $166,400

132
CHAPTER 4 / THE TIME VALUE OF MONEY
New payment plan ($10,000 per year for 21 years):
Total interest paid = $10,000 × 21 −$100,000 = $110,000
Prepaying the loan in this way would save $56,400 in interest!
4.7.6
Finding the Interest Rate, i, Given A, F, and N
Now let’s look at the situation in which you know the amount (A) and duration (N)
ofauniformpaymentseries. Youalsoknowthedesiredfuturevalueoftheseries(F).
What you don’t know is the interest rate that makes them equivalent. As was the
case for an unknown N, there is no single equation to determine i. However, we
can use the known relationships between i, A, F, and N and the method of linear
interpolation to approximate the interest rate.
EXAMPLE 4-13
Finding the Interest Rate to Meet an Investment Goal
After years of being a poor, debt-encumbered college student, you decide that
you want to pay for your dream car in cash. Not having enough money now,
you decide to speciﬁcally put money away each year in a “dream car” fund. The
car you want to buy will cost $60,000 in eight years. You are going to put aside
$6,000 each year (for eight years) to save for this. At what interest rate must you
invest your money to achieve your goal of having enough to purchase the car
after eight years?
Solution
We can use Equation (4-9) to show our desired equivalence relationship.
$60,000 = $6,000 (F/A, i%, 8)
(F/A, i%, 8) = 10
Now we can use the interest tables in Appendix C to help track down the
unknown value of i. What we are looking for are two interest rates, one with
an (F/A, i%, 8) value greater than 10 and one with an (F/A, i%, 8) less than 10.
Thumbing through Appendix C, we ﬁnd
(F/A, 6%, 8) = 9.8975
and
(F/A, 7%, 8) = 10.2598,
which tells us that the interest rate we are looking for is between 6% and 7%
per year. Even though the function (F/A, i%, N) is nonlinear, we can use linear
interpolation to approximate the value of i.
The dashed curve in Figure 4-8 is what we are linearly approximating. The
answer, i′, can be determined by using the similar triangles dashed in Figure 4-8.

Spreadsheet Solution
Excel has another ﬁnancial function that allows you to solve for an unknown
interest rate. RATE(nper, pmt, pv, fv) will return the ﬁxed interest rate that equates
an annuity of magnitude pmt that lasts for nper periods to either its present value
(pv) or its future value (fv).
i′ = RATE(8, −6000, 0, 60000) = 0.0629 or 6.29% per year
Note that a 0 was entered for pv since we were working with a known future
value in this example.

Deferred Annuities (Uniform Series)
All annuities (uniform series) discussed to this point involve the ﬁrst cash ﬂow
being made at the end of the ﬁrst period, and they are called ordinary annuities.
If the cash ﬂow does not begin until some later date, the annuity is known as a
deferred annuity. If the annuity is deferred for J periods (J < N), the situation is
as portrayed in Figure 4-9, in which the entire framed ordinary annuity has been
moved away from “time present,” or “time zero,” by J periods. Remember that, in
an annuity deferred for J periods, the ﬁrst payment is made at the end of period
(J + 1), assuming that all periods involved are equal in length.
The present equivalent at the end of period J of an annuity with cash ﬂows of
amount A is, from Equation (4-9), A(P/A, i%, N −J). The present equivalent of the
single amount A(P/A, i%, N −J) as of time zero will then be
P0 = A(P/A, i%, N −J)(P/F, i%, J).

EXAMPLE 4-14
Present Equivalent of a Deferred Annuity
To illustrate the preceding discussion, suppose that a father, on the day his son
is born, wishes to determine what lump amount would have to be paid into an
account bearing interest of 12% per year to provide withdrawals of $2,000 on
each of the son’s 18th, 19th, 20th, and 21st birthdays.
Solution
The problem is represented in the following cash-ﬂow diagram. One should ﬁrst
recognize that an ordinary annuity of four withdrawals of $2,000 each is involved
and that the present equivalent of this annuity occurs at the 17th birthday when
a (P/A, i%, N −J) factor is utilized. In this problem, N = 21 and J = 17. It is
often helpful to use a subscript with P or F to denote the respective point in time.

136

equivalent, and hence it could also be denoted F17. Money at a given point in
time, such as the end of period 17, is the same regardless of whether it is called
a present equivalent or a future equivalent. Hence,
P0 = F17(P/F, 12%, 17) = $6,074.60(0.1456) = $884.46,
which is the amount that the father would have to deposit on the day his son is
born.
EXAMPLE 4-15
Deferred Future Value of an Annuity
When you take your ﬁrst job, you decide to start saving right away for your
retirement. You put $5,000 per year into the company’s 401(k) plan, which
averages 8% interest per year. Five years later, you move to another job and start
a new 401(k) plan. You never get around to merging the funds in the two plans.
If the ﬁrst plan continued to earn interest at the rate of 8% per year for 35 years
after you stopped making contributions, how much is the account worth?

SECTION 4.10 / EQUIVALENCE CALCULATIONS INVOLVING MULTIPLE INTEREST FORMULAS 137
The easiest way to approach this is to ﬁrst ﬁnd the future equivalent of the
annuity as of time 5.
F5 = $5,000 (F/A, 8%, 5) = $5,000 (5.8666) = $29,333.
To determine F40, F5 can now be denoted P5, and
F40 = P5 (F/P, 8%, 35) = $29,333 (14.7853) = $433,697.
4.10
Equivalence Calculations Involving Multiple
Interest Formulas
You should now be comfortable with equivalence problems that involve discrete
compounding of interest and discrete cash ﬂows. All compounding of interest
takes place once per time period (e.g., a year), and to this point cash ﬂows also
occur once per time period. This section provides examples involving two or
more equivalence calculations to solve for an unknown quantity. The end-of-year
cash-ﬂow convention is used. Again, the interest rate is constant over the N time
periods.
EXAMPLE 4-16
Calculating Equivalent P, F, and A Values
Figure 4-10 depicts an example problem with a series of year-end cash ﬂows
extending over eight years. The amounts are $100 for the ﬁrst year, $200 for
the second year, $500 for the third year, and $400 for each year from the
fourth through the eighth. These could represent something like the expected
maintenance expenditures for a certain piece of equipment or payments into
a fund. Note that the payments are shown at the end of each year, which is a
standard assumption (convention) for this book and for economic analyses in
general, unless we have information to the contrary. It is desired to ﬁnd
(a) the present equivalent expenditure, P0;
(b) the future equivalent expenditure, F8;
(c) the annual equivalent expenditure, A
of these cash ﬂows if the annual interest rate is 20%. Solve by hand and by using
a spreadsheet.
Solution by Hand
(a) To ﬁnd the equivalent P0, we need to sum the equivalent values of all
payments as of the beginning of the ﬁrst year (time zero). The required
movements of money through time are shown graphically in Figure 4-10(a).

movements of money through time. However, since the equivalent P0 is
already known to be $1,203.82, we can directly calculate
F8 = P0(F/P, 20%, 8) = $1,203.82(4.2998) = $5,176.19.
(c) The equivalent A of the irregular cash ﬂows can be calculated directly from
either P0 or F8 as
A = P0(A/P, 20%, 8) = $1,203.82(0.2606) = $313.73
or
A = F8(A/F, 20%, 8) = $5,176.19(0.0606) = $313.73.
The computation of A from P0 and F8 is shown in Figure 4-10(c). Thus, we
ﬁnd that the irregular series of payments shown in Figure 4-10 is equivalent
to $1,203.82 at time zero, $5,176.19 at time eight, or a uniform series of $313.73
at the end of each of the eight years.
Spreadsheet Solution
Figure 4-11 displays a spreadsheet solution for this example. The present
equivalent (P0) of the tabulated cash ﬂows is easily computed by using the NPV
function with the stated interest rate (20% in cell B1). The future equivalent (F8) is
determined from the present equivalent by using the (F/P, i%, N) relationship.
The annual equivalent is also determined from the present equivalent by

applying the PMT function. The slight differences in results when compared
to the hand solution are due to rounding of the interest factor values in the hand
solution.
EXAMPLE 4-17
How Much is that Last Payment? (Example 4-12 Revisited)
In Example 4-12, we looked at paying off a loan early by increasing the annual
payment. The $100,000 loan was to be repaid in 30 annual installments of $8,880
at an interest rate of 8% per year. As part of the example, we determined that the
loan could be paid in full after 21 years if the annual payment was increased to
$10,000.
As with most real-life loans, the ﬁnal payment will be something different
(usually less) than the annuity amount. This is due to the effect of rounding in
the interest calculations—you can’t pay in fractions of a cent! For this example,
determine the amount of the 21st (and ﬁnal) payment on the $100,000 loan when
20 payments of $10,000 have already been made. The interest rate remains at 8%
per year.

We need to determine the value of F that will make the present equivalent of all
loan payments equal to the amount borrowed. We can do this by discounting
all of the payments to time 0 (including the ﬁnal payment, F) and setting their
value equal to $100,000.
$10,000 (P/A, 8%, 20) + F (P/F, 8%, 21) = $100,000
$10,000 (9.8181) + F (0.1987) = $100,000
F = $9,154.50
Thus, a payment of $9,154.50 is needed at the end of year 21 to pay off the loan.

EXAMPLE 4-18
The Present Equivalent of BP’s Payment Schedule
In this example, we answer the question posed at the beginning of the chapter—
what is the present equivalent value of BP’s proposed payment schedule? Recall
that BP will pay $3 billion at the end of the third quarter of 2010 and another $2
billion in the fourth quarter of 2010. Twelve additional payments of $1.25 billion
each quarter thereafter will result in a total of $20 billion having been paid into
the fund. The interest rate is 3% per quarter.
Solution
Figure 4-12 shows the cash-ﬂow diagram for this situation. The present
equivalent of the cash ﬂows is
P = $3 billion (P/F, 3%, 1) + $2 billion (P/F, 3%, 2)
+ $1.25 billion (P/A, 3%, 12) (P/F, 3%, 2)
= $3 billion (0.9709) + $2 billion (0.9426) + $1.25 (9.9540)(0.9426)
= $16.53 billion.

Determining an Unknown Annuity Amount
Two receipts of $1,000 each are desired at the EOYs 10 and 11. To make these

(b) Because the unknown annuity, A, begins at EOY two, it makes sense to
establish our reference year for the equivalence calculations at EOY one
(remember that the ﬁrst annuity amount follows its P-equivalent amount by
one year). So the P-equivalent at EOY 1 of the four A amounts is
P1 = A(P/A, 12%, 4).
Next we calculate the EOY one P-equivalent of $1,000 at EOY 10 and $1,000
at EOY 11 as follows:
P
′
1 = $1,000 (P/A, 12%, 2) (P/F, 12%, 8).
The (P/F, 12%, 8) factor is needed to discount the equivalent value of the A
amounts at EOY nine to EOY one. By equating both P-equivalents at EOY
one, we can solve for the unknown amount, A.
P1 = P
′
1
A (P/A, 12%, 4) = $1,000 (P/A, 12%, 2) (P/F, 12%, 8),
or
3.0373 A = $682.63
and
A = $224.75.
Therefore, we conclude that deposits of $224.75 at EOYs two, three, four,
and ﬁve are equivalent to $1,000 at EOYs 10 and 11 if the interest rate is 12%
per year.
(c) Now we need to calculate the F-equivalent at time 11 of the −$224.75 annuity
in years 2 through 5 and the $1,000 annuity in years 10 and 11.
−$224.75 (F/A, 12%, 4) (F/P, 12%, 6) + $1,000 (F/A, 12%, 2)
= −$0.15
This value should be zero, but round-off error in the interest factors causes
a small difference of $0.15.

SECTION 4.11 / UNIFORM (ARITHMETIC) GRADIENT OF CASH FLOWS 143
4.11
Uniform (Arithmetic) Gradient of Cash Flows
Some problems involve receipts or expenses that are projected to increase or
decrease by a uniform amount each period, thus constituting an arithmetic sequence
of cash ﬂows. For example, because of leasing a certain type of equipment,
maintenance and repair savings relative to purchasing the equipment may increase
by a roughly constant amount each period. This situation can be modeled as a
uniform gradient of cash ﬂows.
Figure 4-13 is a cash-ﬂow diagram of a sequence of end-of-period cash ﬂows
increasing by a constant amount, G, in each period. The G is known as the uniform
gradient amount. Note that the timing of cash ﬂows on which the derived formulas
and tabled values are based is as follows:

Numerical values for this factor are given in column 8 of Appendix C for a wide
assortment of i and N values. We shall use the functional symbol (P/G, i%, N) for
this factor. Hence,
P = G (P/G, i%, N).

Computations Using G
Be sure to notice that the direct use of gradient conversion factors applies when
there is no cash ﬂow at the end of period one, as in Example 4-20. There may be
an A amount at the end of period one, but it is treated separately, as illustrated in
Examples 4-21 and 4-22. A major advantage of using gradient conversion factors
(i.e., computational time savings) is realized when N becomes large.
EXAMPLE 4-20
Using the Gradient Conversion Factors to Find P and A
As an example of the straightforward use of the gradient conversion factors,
suppose that certain EOY cash ﬂows are expected to be $1,000 for the second
year, $2,000 for the third year, and $3,000 for the fourth year and that, if interest
is 15% per year, it is desired to ﬁnd
(a) present equivalent value at the beginning of the ﬁrst year,
(b) uniform annual equivalent value at the end of each of the four years.

CHAPTER 4 / THE TIME VALUE OF MONEY
Observe that this schedule of cash ﬂows ﬁts the model of the arithmetic gradient
formulas with G = $1,000 and N = 4. Note that there is no cash ﬂow at the end
of the ﬁrst period.
(a) The present equivalent can be calculated as
P0 = G(P/G, 15%, 4) = $1,000(3.79) = $3,790.
(b) The annual equivalent can be calculated from Equation (4-26) as
A = G(A/G, 15%, 4) = $1,000(1.3263) = $1,326.30.
Of course, once P0 is known, the value of A can be calculated as
A = P0(A/P, 15%, 4) = $3,790(0.3503) = $1,326.30.
EXAMPLE 4-21
Present Equivalent of an Increasing Arithmetic Gradient Series
As a further example of the use of arithmetic gradient formulas, suppose that
we have cash ﬂows as follows:

Cash Flows ($)

2
6,000
3
7,000
4
8,000
Also, assume that we wish to calculate their present equivalent at i = 15% per
year, using gradient conversion factors.
Solution
The schedule of cash ﬂows is depicted in the left-hand diagram of Figure 4-14.
The right two diagrams of Figure 4-14 show how the original schedule can be
broken into two separate sets of cash ﬂows, an annuity series of $5,000 plus
an arithmetic gradient of $1,000 that ﬁts the general gradient model for which
factors are tabled. The summed present equivalents of these two separate sets
of cash ﬂows equal the present equivalent of the original problem. Thus, using
the symbols shown in Figure 4-14, we have
P0T = P0A + P0G
= A(P/A, 15%, 4) + G(P/G, 15%, 4)
= $5,000(2.8550) + $1,000(3.79) = $14,275 + 3,790 = $18,065.

SECTION 4.11 / UNIFORM (ARITHMETIC) GRADIENT OF CASH FLOWS 147
The annual equivalent of the original cash ﬂows could be calculated with
the aid of Equation (4-26) as follows:
AT = A + AG
= $5,000 + $1,000(A/G, 15%, 4) = $6,326.30.
AT is equivalent to P0T because $6,326.30(P/A, 15%, 4) = $18,061, which is the
same value obtained previously (subject to round-off error).

an arithmetic gradient of $1,000 from an annuity series of $8,000.

So,
P0T = P0A −P0G
= A(P/A, 15%, 4) −G(P/G, 15%, 4)
= $8,000(2.8550) −$1,000(3.79)
= $22,840 −$3,790 = $19,050.
Again, the annual equivalent of the original decreasing series of cash ﬂows
can be calculated by the same rationale:
AT = A −AG
= $8,000 −$1,000(A/G, 15%, 4)
= $6,673.70.
Note from Examples 4-21 and 4-22 that the present equivalent of $18,065 for
an increasing arithmetic gradient series of payments is different from the present
equivalent of $19,050 for an arithmetic gradient of payments of identical amounts,
but with reversed timing (decreasing series of payments). This difference would
be even greater for higher interest rates and gradient amounts and exempliﬁes the
marked effect of the timing of cash ﬂows on equivalent values.
4.12
Geometric Sequences of Cash Flows
Some economic equivalence problems involve projected cash-ﬂow patterns that
are changing at an average rate, ¯f, each period. A ﬁxed amount of a commodity
that inﬂates in price at a constant rate each year is a typical situation that can be
modeled with a geometric sequence of cash ﬂows. The resultant EOY cash-ﬂow
pattern is referred to as a geometric gradient series and has the general appearance
shown in Figure 4-16. Notice that the initial cash ﬂow in this series, A1, occurs at
the end of period one and that Ak = (Ak−1)(1 + ¯f), 2 ≤k ≤N. The Nth term in

this geometric sequence is AN = A1(1 + ¯f)N−1, and the common ratio throughout
the sequence is (Ak −Ak−1)/Ak−1 = ¯f. Be sure to notice that ¯f can be positive or
negative.
Each term in Figure 4-16 could be discounted, or compounded, at interest rate i
per period to obtain a value of P or F, respectively. However, this becomes quite
tedious for large N, so it is convenient to have a single equation instead.
The present equivalent of the geometric gradient series shown in Figure 4-16 is
P = A1(P/F, i%, 1) + A2(P/F, i%, 2) + A3(P/F, i%, 3)
+ · · · + AN(P/F, i%, N)
= A1(1 + i)−1 + A2(1 + i)−2 + A3(1 + i)−3 + · · · + AN(1 + i)−N

+ · · · + A1(1 + ¯f)N−1(1 + i)−N
= A1(1 + i)−1[1 + x + x2 + · · · + xN−1],
(4-28)
where x = (1 + ¯f)/(1 + i). The expression in brackets in Equation (4-28) reduces to
(1 + xN)/(1 −x) when x ̸= 1 or ¯f ̸= i. If ¯f = i, then x = 1 and the expression in

150

P =

¯f = i,
which reduces to

Once we know the present equivalent of a geometric gradient series, we can
easily compute the equivalent uniform series or future amount using the basic
interest factors (A/P, i%, N) and (F/P, i%, N).
Additional discussion of geometric sequences of cash ﬂows is provided in
Chapter 8, which deals with price changes and exchange rates.

EXAMPLE 4-26
A Retirement Savings Plan
On your 23rd birthday you decide to invest $4,500 (10% of your annual salary) in
a mutual fund earning 7% per year. You will continue to make annual deposits
equal to 10% of your annual salary until you retire at age 62 (40 years after you
started your job). You expect your salary to increase by an average of 4% each
year during this time. How much money will you have accumulated in your
mutual fund when you retire?
Solution
Since the amount of your deposit is 10% of your salary, each year the amount
you deposit will increase by 4% as your salary increases. Thus, your deposits
constitute a geometric gradient series with f = 4% per year. We can use Equation
(4-30) to determine the present equivalent amount of the deposits.
P = $4,500[1 −(P/F, 7%, 40)(F/P, 4%, 40)]
0.07 −0.04
= $4,500[1 −(0.0668)(4.8010)]

= $101,894.

SECTION 4.13 / INTEREST RATES THAT VARY WITH TIME

Now the future worth at age 62 can be determined.
F = $101,894(F/P, 7%, 40)

= $1,525,812.
This savings plan will make you a millionaire when you retire. Moral: Start
saving early!

Interest Rates that Vary with Time
Student loans under the U.S. government’s popular Stafford program let students
borrow money up to a certain amount each year (based on their year in school and
ﬁnancial need). Stafford loans are the most common type of educational loan, and
they have a ﬂoating interest rate that readjusts every year (but cannot exceed 8.25%
per year). When the interest rate on a loan can vary with time, it is necessary to
take this into account when determining the future equivalent value of the loan.
Example 4-27 demonstrates how this situation is treated.
EXAMPLE 4-27
Compounding with Changing Interest Rates
Ashea Smith is a 22-year-old senior who used the Stafford loan program to
borrow $4,000 four years ago when the interest rate was 4.06% per year. $5,000
was borrowed three years ago at 3.42%. Two years ago she borrowed $6,000 at
5.23%, and last year $7,000 was borrowed at 6.03% per year. Now she would like
to consolidate her debt into a single 20-year loan with a 5% ﬁxed annual interest
rate. If Ashea makes annual payments (starting in one year) to repay her total
debt, what is the amount of each payment?

CHAPTER 4 / THE TIME VALUE OF MONEY
Before we can ﬁnd the annual repayment amount, we need to ﬁnd the current
(time 0) equivalent value of the four loans. This problem can be solved by
compounding the amount owed at the beginning of each year by the interest
rate that applies to each individual year and repeating this process over the four
years to obtain the total current equivalent value.
F−3 = $4,000(F/P, 4.06%, 1) + $5,000 = $4,000(1.0406)
+ $5,000 = $9,162.40
F−2 = $9,162.40(F/P, 3.42%, 1) + $6,000 = $15,475.75
F−1 = $15,475.75(F/P, 5.23%, 1) + $7,000 = $23,285.13
F0 = $23,285.13(F/P, 6.03%, 1) = $24,689.22
Notice that it was a simple matter to substitute (F/P, i%, N) = (1 + i)N for the
noninteger values of i.
Now that we have the current equivalent value of the amount Ashea
borrowed (F0 = P0), we can easily compute her annual repayment amount
over 20 years when the interest rate is ﬁxed at 5% per year.
A = $24,689.22(A/P, 5%, 20) = $24,689.22(0.0802) = $1,980.08 per year
Comment
The total principal borrowed was $4,000 + $5,000 + $6,000 + $7,000 = $22,000.
Notice that a total of $17,601.60 (20 × $1,980.08 −$22,000) in interest is repaid
over the entire 20-year loan period. This interest amount is close to the amount
of principal originally borrowed. Moral: Borrow as little as possible and repay
as quickly as possible to reduce interest expense! See www.finaid.com.
To obtain the present equivalent of a series of future cash ﬂows subject to
varying interest rates, a procedure similar to the preceding one would be uti-
lized with a sequence of (P/F, ik%, k) factors. In general, the present equivalent
value of a cash ﬂow occurring at the end of period N can be computed using
Equation (4-31), where ik is the interest rate for the kth period (the symbol ! means
“the product of”):
P =
FN
!N
k=1(1 + ik)
.
(4-31)
For instance, if F4 = $1,000 and i1 = 10%, i2 = 12%, i3 = 13%, and i4 = 10%,
then
P = $1,000[(P/F, 10%, 1)(P/F, 12%, 1)(P/F, 13%, 1)(P/F, 10%, 1)]
= $1,000[(0.9091)(0.8929)(0.8850)(0.9091)] = $653.

SECTION 4.14 / NOMINAL AND EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATES
155
4.14
Nominal and Effective Interest Rates
Very often the interest period, or time between successive compounding, is less
than one year (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly, or quarterly). It has become customary
to quote interest rates on an annual basis, followed by the compounding period if
different from one year in length. For example, if the interest rate is 6% per interest
period and the interest period is six months, it is customary to speak of this rate as
“12% compounded semiannually.” Here the annual rate of interest is known as the
nominal rate, 12% in this case. A nominal interest rate is represented by r. But the
actual (or effective) annual rate on the principal is not 12%, but something greater,
because compounding occurs twice during the year.
Consequently, the frequency at which a nominal interest rate is compounded
each year can have a pronounced effect on the dollar amount of total interest earned.
For instance, consider a principal amount of $1,000 to be invested for three years at
a nominal rate of 12% compounded semiannually. The interest earned during the
ﬁrst six months would be $1,000 × (0.12/2) = $60.
Total principal and interest at the beginning of the second six-month period is
P + Pi = $1,000 + $60 = $1,060.
The interest earned during the second six months would be
$1,060 × (0.12/2) = $63.60.
Then total interest earned during the year is
$60.00 + $63.60 = $123.60.
Finally, the effective annual interest rate for the entire year is
$123.60
$1,000 × 100 = 12.36%.
If this process is repeated for years two and three, the accumulated (com-
pounded) amount of interest can be plotted as in Figure 4-18. Suppose that the same
$1,000 had been invested at 12% compounded monthly, which is 1% per month.

CHAPTER 4 / THE TIME VALUE OF MONEY
The accumulated interest over three years that results from monthly compounding
is shown in Figure 4-19.
The actual or exact rate of interest earned on the principal during one year
is known as the effective rate. It should be noted that effective interest rates are
always expressed on an annual basis, unless speciﬁcally stated otherwise. In this
text, the effective interest rate per year is customarily designated by i and the
nominal interest rate per year by r. In engineering economy studies in which
compounding is annual, i = r. The relationship between effective interest, i, and
nominal interest, r, is
i = (1 + r/M)M −1,
(4-32)
where M is the number of compounding periods per year. It is now clear from
Equation (4-32) why i > r when M > 1.
The effective rate of interest is useful for describing the compounding effect
of interest earned on interest during one year. Table 4-4 shows effective rates for
various nominal rates and compounding periods.
Interestingly, the federal truth-in-lending law now requires a statement reg-
arding the annual percentage rate (APR) being charged in contracts involving

borrowed money. The APR is a nominal interest rate and does not account for
compounding that may occur, or be appropriate, during a year. Before this
legislation was passed by Congress in 1969, creditors had no obligation to explain
how interest charges were determined or what the true cost of money on a loan was.
As a result, borrowers were generally unable to compute their APR and compare
different ﬁnancing plans.
EXAMPLE 4-28
Effective Annual Interest Rate
A credit card company charges an interest rate of 1.375% per month on
the unpaid balance of all accounts. The annual interest rate, they claim, is
12(1.375%) = 16.5%. What is the effective rate of interest per year being charged
by the company?
Solution
Equation (4-32) is used to compute the effective rate of interest in this example:
i =
!
1 + 0.165
12
"12
−1
= 0.1781, or 17.81%/year.
Note that r = 12(1.375%) = 16.5%, which is the APR. In general, it is true
that r = M(r/M), where r/M is the interest rate per period.

Compounding More Often than Once per Year
4.15.1
Single Amounts
If a nominal interest rate is quoted and the number of compounding periods
per year and number of years are known, any problem involving future,
annual, or present equivalent values can be calculated by straightforward use of
Equations (4-3) and (4-32), respectively.
EXAMPLE 4-29
Future Equivalent when Interest Is Compounded Quarterly
Suppose that a $100 lump-sum amount is invested for 10 years at a nominal
interest rate of 6% compounded quarterly. How much is it worth at the end of
the 10th year?
Solution
There are four compounding periods per year, or a total of 4 × 10 = 40 interest
periods. The interest rate per interest period is 6%/4 = 1.5%. When the values

158
CHAPTER 4 / THE TIME VALUE OF MONEY
are used in Equation (4-3), one ﬁnds that
F = P(F/P, 1.5%, 40) = $100.00(1.015)40 = $100.00(1.814) = $181.40.
Alternatively, the effective interest rate from Equation (4-32) is 6.14%. Therefore,
F = P(F/P, 6.14%, 10) = $100.00(1.0614)10 = $181.40.
4.15.2
Uniform Series and Gradient Series
When there is more than one compounded interest period per year, the formulas
and tables for uniform series and gradient series can be used as long as there is a
cash ﬂow at the end of each interest period, as shown in Figures 4-6 and 4-13 for a
uniform annual series and a uniform gradient series, respectively.
EXAMPLE 4-30
Computing a Monthly Auto Payment
Stan Moneymaker has a bank loan for $10,000 to pay for his new truck. This
loan is to be repaid in equal end-of-month installments for ﬁve years with a
nominal interest rate of 12% compounded monthly. What is the amount of each
payment?
Solution
The number of installment payments is 5 × 12 = 60, and the interest rate per
month is 12%/12 = 1%. When these values are used in Equation (4-15), one
ﬁnds that
A = P(A/P, 1%, 60) = $10,000(0.0222) = $222.
Notice that there is a cash ﬂow at the end of each month (interest period),
including month 60, in this example.
EXAMPLE 4-31
Uniform Gradient Series and Semiannual Compounding
Certain operating savings are expected to be 0 at the end of the ﬁrst six months,
to be $1,000 at the end of the second six months, and to increase by $1,000 at the
end of each six-month period thereafter, for a total of four years. It is desired to
ﬁnd the equivalent uniform amount, A, at the end of each of the eight six-month
periods if the nominal interest rate is 20% compounded semiannually.
Solution
A cash-ﬂow diagram is given below, and the solution is
A = G(A/G, 10%, 8) = $1,000(3.0045) = $3,004.50.

EXAMPLE 4-32
Finding the Interest Rate on a Loan
A loan of $15,000 requires monthly payments of $477 over a 36-month period of
time. These payments include both principal and interest.
(a) What is the nominal interest rate (APR) for this loan?
(b) What is the effective interest rate per year?
(c) Determine the amount of unpaid loan principal after 20 months.
Solution
(a) We can set up an equivalence relationship to solve for the unknown interest
rate since we know that P = $15,000, A = $477, and N = 36 months.
$477 = $15,000(A/P, imo, 36)
(A/P, imo, 36) = 0.0318
We can now look through Appendix C to ﬁnd values of i that have an
(A/P, i, 36) value close to 0.0318. From Table C-3 (i = 3/4%), we ﬁnd
(A/P, 3/4%, 36) = 0.0318. Therefore,
imo = 0.75% per month
and
r = 12 × 0.75% = 9% per year, compounded monthly.

CHAPTER 4 / THE TIME VALUE OF MONEY
(c) We can ﬁnd the amount of the unpaid loan principal after 20 months by
ﬁnding the equivalent value of the remaining 16 monthly payments as of
month 20.
P20 = $477(P/A, 3/4%, 16) = $477(15.0243) = $7,166.59
After 20 payments have been made, almost half of the original principal
amount remains. Notice that we used the monthly interest rate of 3/4% in
our calculation since the cash ﬂows are occurring monthly.
4.16
Interest Formulas for Continuous Compounding
and Discrete Cash Flows
In most business transactions and economy studies, interest is compounded at
the end of discrete periods, and, as has been discussed previously, cash ﬂows are
assumed to occur in discrete amounts at the end of such periods. This practice will be
used throughout the remaining chapters of this book. However, it is evident that in most
enterprises, cash is ﬂowing in and out in an almost continuous stream. Because
cash, whenever it’s available, can usually be used proﬁtably, this situation creates
opportunities for very frequent compounding of the interest earned. So that this
condition can be dealt with (modeled) when continuously compounded interest
rates are available, the concept of continuous compounding is sometimes used
in economy studies. Actually, the effect of this procedure, compared with that of
discrete compounding, is rather small in most cases.
Continuous compounding assumes that cash ﬂows occur at discrete intervals
(e.g., once per year), but that compounding is continuous throughout the interval.
For example, with a nominal rate of interest per year of r, if the interest is
compounded M times per year, one unit of principal will amount to [1 + (r/M)]M
at the end of one year. Letting M/r = p, we ﬁnd that the foregoing expression
becomes

(4-33)
Because

= e1 = 2.71828 . . . ,
Equation (4-33) can be written as er. Consequently, the continuously compounded
compound amount factor (single cash ﬂow) at r% nominal interest for N years is erN.
Using our functional notation, we express this as
(F/P, r%, N) = erN.
(4-34)
Note that the symbol r is directly comparable to that used for discrete compounding
and discrete cash ﬂows (i%), except that r% is used to denote the nominal rate and
the use of continuous compounding.

SECTION 4.16 / INTEREST FORMULAS FOR CONTINUOUS COMPOUNDING AND DISCRETE CASH FLOWS
161
Since erN for continuous compounding corresponds to (1 + i)N for discrete
compounding, er is equal to (1 + i). Hence, we may correctly conclude that
i = er −1.
(4-35)
By using this relationship, the corresponding values of (P/F), (F/A), and (P/A) for
continuous compounding may be obtained from Equations (4-4), (4-8), and (4-10),
respectively, by substituting er −1 for i in these equations. Thus, for continuous
compounding and discrete cash ﬂows,
(P/F, r%, N) =

erN = e−rN;

(F/A, r%, N) = erN −1

(4-37)
(P/A, r%, N) = 1 −e−rN

erN(er −1).
(4-38)
Values for (A/P, r%, N) and (A/F, r%, N) may be derived through their inverse
relationships to (P/A, r%, N) and (F/A, r%, N), respectively. Numerous continuous
compounding, discrete cash-ﬂow interest factors, and their uses are summarized
in Table 4-5.
Because continuous compounding is used infrequently in this text, detailed
values for (A/F, r%, N) and (A/P, r%, N) are not given inAppendix D. However, the
tables in Appendix D do provide values of (F/P, r%, N), (P/F, r%, N), (F/A, r%, N),
and (P/A, r%, N) for a limited number of interest rates.

CHAPTER 4 / THE TIME VALUE OF MONEY
Note that tables of interest and annuity factors for continuous compounding
are tabulated in terms of nominal rates of interest per time period.
EXAMPLE 4-33
Continuous Compounding and Single Amounts
You have $10,000 to invest for two years. Your bank offers 5% interest,
compounded continuously for funds in a money market account. Assuming no
additional deposits or withdrawals, how much money will be in that account at
the end of two years?
Solution
F = $10,000 (F/P, r = 5%, 2) = $10,000 e(0.05)(2) = $10,000 (1.1052) = $11,052
Comment
If the interest rate was 5% compounded annually, the account would have been
worth
F = $10,000 (F/P, 5%, 2) = $10,000 (1.1025) = $11,025.
EXAMPLE 4-34
Continuous Compounding and Annual Payments
Suppose that one has a present loan of $1,000 and desires to determine what
equivalent uniform EOY payments, A, could be obtained from it for 10 years if
the nominal interest rate is 20% compounded continuously (M = ∞).
Solution
Here we utilize the formulation
A = P(A/P, r%, N).
Since the (A/P) factor is not tabled for continuous compounding, we substitute
its inverse (P/A), which is tabled in Appendix D. Thus,
A = P ×
1
(P/A, 20%, 10) = $1,000 ×
1
3.9054 = $256.
Note that the answer to the same problem, with discrete annual compound-
ing (M = 1), is
A = P(A/P, 20%, 10)
= $1,000(0.2385) = $239.

SECTION 4.17 / CASE STUDY—UNDERSTANDING ECONOMIC “EQUIVALENCE”

EXAMPLE 4-35
Continuous Compounding and Semiannual Payments
An individual needs $12,000 immediately as a down payment on a new home.
Suppose that he can borrow this money from his insurance company. He must
repay the loan in equal payments every six months over the next eight years.
The nominal interest rate being charged is 7% compounded continuously. What
is the amount of each payment?
Solution
The nominal interest rate per six months is 3.5%. Thus, A each six months is
$12,000(A/P, r = 3.5%, 16). By substituting terms in Equation (4-38) and then
using its inverse, we determine the value of A per six months to be $997:
A = $12,000
!
1
(P/A, r = 3.5%, 16)
"
= $12,000
12.038 = $997.

CASE STUDY—Understanding Economic “Equivalence”
Enrico Suarez just graduated with a B.S. in engineering and landed a new job with
a starting annual salary of $48,000. There are a number of things that he would
like to do with his newfound “wealth.” For starters, he needs to begin repaying his
student loans (totaling $20,000) and he’d like to reduce some outstanding balances
on credit cards (totaling $5,000). Enrico also needs to purchase a car to get to work
and would like to put money aside to purchase a condo in the future. Last, but not
least, he wants to put some money aside for his eventual retirement.
Our recent graduate needs to do some ﬁnancial planning for which he has
selected a 10-year time frame. At the end of 10 years, he’d like to have paid off his
current student loan and credit card debt, as well as have accumulated $40,000 for
a down payment on a condo. If possible, Enrico would like to put aside 10% of
his take home salary for retirement. He has gathered the following information to
assist him in his planning.∗
• Student loans are typically repaid in equal monthly installments over a period
of 10 years. The interest rate on Enrico’s loan is 8% compounded monthly.
• Credit cards vary greatly in the interest rate charged. Typical APR rates are close
to 17%, and monthly minimum payments are usually computed using a 10-year
repayment period. The interest rate on Enrico’s credit card is 18% compounded
monthly.
• Car loans are usually repaid over three, four, or ﬁve years. The APR on a car loan
can be as low as 2.9% (if the timing is right) or as high as 12%. As a ﬁrst-time
car buyer, Enrico can secure a $15,000 car loan at 9% compounded monthly to
be repaid over 60 months.
∗The stated problem data are current as of 2014.

CHAPTER 4 / THE TIME VALUE OF MONEY
• A 30-year, ﬁxed rate mortgage is currently going for 5.75%–6.0% per year. If
Enrico can save enough to make a 20% down payment on the purchase of
his condo, he can avoid private mortgage insurance that can cost as much as
$60 per month.
• Investment opportunities can provide variable returns. “Safe” investments can
guarantee 7% per year, while “risky” investments could return 30% or more per
year.
• Enrico’s parents and older siblings have reminded him that his monthly take
home pay will be reduced by income taxes and beneﬁt deductions. He should
not count on being able to spend more than 80% of his gross salary.
As Enrico’s friend (and the one who took Engineering Economy instead of
Appreciating the Art of Television Commercials), you have been asked to review
his ﬁnancial plans. How reasonable are his goals?
Solution
Since all repayments are done on a monthly basis, it makes sense to adopt the
month as Enrico’s unit of time. There are ﬁve categories for his cash ﬂows: debt
repayment, transportation costs, housing costs, other living expenses, and savings.
The following paragraphs summarize his estimates of monthly expenses in each
of these categories.
Debt Repayment
Enrico’s student loan debt is $20,000 and is to be repaid over the next 120 months
(10 years) at a nominal interest rate of 8% compounded monthly (imonth = 8/12% =
2/3%). His monthly loan payment is then
AStudent Loan = $20,000(A/P, 2/3%, 120) = $20,000(0.01213) = $242.60 per month.
Enrico’s credit card debt is $5,000 and is to be completely repaid over the next 120
months at a nominal interest rate of 18% compounded monthly (imonth = 1.5%).
His monthly credit card payment, assuming no additional usage, is then
ACredit Card = $5,000(A/P, 1.5%, 120) = $5,000(0.01802) = $90.10 per month.
Enrico’s monthly debt repayment totals $242.60 + $90.10 = $332.70.
Transportation Costs
The certiﬁed pre-owned vehicle Enrico would like to buy costs $15,000. The best
rate he can ﬁnd as a ﬁrst-time car buyer with no assets or credit history is 9%
compounded monthly with a 60-month repayment period. Based on these ﬁgures,
his monthly car payment will be
ACar = $15,000(A/P, 0.75%, 60) = $15,000(0.02076) = $311.40 per month.
Even though the car will be completely repaid after ﬁve years, Enrico knows that
he will eventually need to replace the car. To accumulate funds for the replacement

SECTION 4.17 / CASE STUDY—UNDERSTANDING ECONOMIC “EQUIVALENCE”
165
of the car, he wants to continue to set aside this amount each month for the second
ﬁve years.
Insurance for this vehicle will cost $1,200 per year, and Enrico has budgeted
$100 per month to cover fuel and maintenance. Thus, his monthly transportation
costs total $311.40 + $1,200/12 + $100 = $511.40.
Housing Costs
A nice two-bedroom apartment near Enrico’s place of work has a monthly rent of
$800. The rental ofﬁce provided him with a monthly utility cost estimate of $150
to cover water and electricity. Based on this information, $800 + $150 = $950 per
month has been budgeted for his housing costs.
Other Living Expenses
This expense category has troubled Enrico the most. While all the previous
categories are pretty straightforward, he knows that his day-to-day spending will
have the most variability and that it will be tempting to overspend. Nonetheless,
he has developed the following estimates of monthly living expenses not already
covered in the other categories:
Food
$200
Phone
$70
Entertainment
$100
Miscellaneous
(clothing, household items)
$150
Subtotal
$520
Savings
Enrico wants to accumulate $40,000 over the next 10 years to be used as a down
payment on a condo. He feels that if he chooses relatively “safe” investments (CDs
and bonds), he should be able to earn 6% compounded monthly on his savings. He
must then set aside
ACondo = $40,000(A/F, 0.5%, 120) = $40,000(0.00610) = $244.00 per month
to reach his goal.
Enrico’s gross monthly starting salary is $48,000/12 = $4,000. Based on the
information gathered from his family, he estimates his monthly net (take home)
pay to be $4,000(0.80) = $3,200. His monthly retirement savings will then be
$3,200(0.10) = $320. Thus, the total amount to be set aside each month for the
future is $244 + $320 = $564.
Monthly Financial Plan
Based on the preceding calculations, the following table summarizes Enrico’s
monthly ﬁnancial plan.

Enrico is aware that he has not explicitly accounted for price increases over the next
10 years; however, neither has he increased his annual salary. He is hopeful that,
if he works hard, his annual salary increases will at least cover the increase in the
cost of living.
You congratulate your friend on his efforts. You feel that he has covered the
major areas of expenses, as well as savings for the future. You note that he has
$3,200 −$2,878.10 = $321.90 of “extra” money each month to cover unanticipated
costs. With this much leeway, you feel that he should have no problem meeting his
ﬁnancial goals.

Summary
Chapter 4 presented the fundamental time value of money relationships that
are used throughout the remainder of this book. Considerable emphasis has
been placed on the concept of equivalence—if two cash ﬂows (or series of cash
ﬂows) are equivalent for a stated interest rate, you are willing to trade one
for the other. Formulas relating present and future amounts to their equivalent
uniform, arithmetic, and geometric series have been presented. You should feel
comfortable with the material in this chapter before embarking on your journey
through subsequent chapters. Important abbreviations and notation are listed in
Appendix B.
In the next chapter, we will see how to apply time value of money relationships
to the estimated cash ﬂows of a project (the topic of Chapter 3) to arrive at a measure
of its economic worth.

A friend of Liam’s suggests that the $848 annual
premium should be deposited in a good mutual fund
rather than in the insurance policy. “If the mutual fund
earns 10% per year, you can become a millionaire by the
time you retire at age 65,” the friend advises. (4.7)
a. Is the friend’s statement really true?
b. Discuss the trade-off that Liam is making if he
decides to invest his money in a mutual fund.

he retires. To achieve this goal, he plans to invest
$10,000 each year (starting one year from now) into an
account that earns 10% interest compounded annually.
The amount of time before Luis can retire as a multi-
millionaire is how many years? (4.7)

be manufactured largely with carbon ﬁbers made
from recycled plastics,
wood pulp,
and cellulose.
Replacing half the ferrous metals in current automobiles
could reduce a vehicle’s weight by 60% and fuel
consumption by 30%. One impediment to using carbon
ﬁbers in cars is cost. If the justiﬁcation for the extra
sticker price of carbon-ﬁber cars is solely based on fuel
savings, how much extra sticker price can be justiﬁed
over a six-year life span if the carbon-ﬁber car would
average 39 miles per gallon of gasoline compared to a
conventional car averaging 30 miles per gallon?Assume
that gasoline costs $4.00 per gallon, the interest rate is
20% per year, and 117,000 miles are driven uniformly
over six years. (4.7)
4-34. It is estimated that a certain piece of equipment
can save $22,000 per year in labor and materials costs.

and no market value. If the company must earn a
15% annual return on such investments, how much
could be justiﬁed now for the purchase of this piece
of equipment? Draw a cash-ﬂow diagram from the
company’s viewpoint. (4.7)

the ﬁrst payment? (4.7)
4-36. A geothermal heat pump can save up to
80% of the annual heating and cooling bills of
a certain home in the northeastern U.S. In this region,
the yearly cost of conventionally heating and cooling a
2,000 square foot house is about $2,500. With a federal
tax credit of 30% on the total installation of the system,
how much can a homeowner afford to spend for a
geothermal heat pump if the interest rate is 9% per year?
The expected life of the heat pump is 15 years. (4.7)
4-37. The Anderson County board of super-
visors has agreed to fund an ambitious project
that will “spend money now to save much more money
in the future.” A total of $16.2 million will be awarded
to the York Corporation for energy improvements in
40 buildings, 27 parks, and 37 trafﬁc intersections.
These improvements include lighting upgrades, solar
hot water collectors, more efﬁcient heating/cooling
systems, and light-emitting diodes for trafﬁc signals.
Bonds paying 7% per year over the next 15 years will
be used to pay for these improvements. If the annual
savings fail to average $2 million, York Corporation will
reimburse the county the difference. Will York need to
pay any money to the county? If so, how much? (4.7)
4-38. The U.S. stock market has returned an average of

ﬁrst year is $175,000. This cost is expected to increase
due to inﬂation at a rate of 8% per year for ﬁve years, at
which time this particular heat exchanger will no longer
be needed. If the company’s cost of capital is 18% per
year, how much could you afford to spend for a higher
quality heat exchanger so that these annual replacement
and downtime costs could be eliminated? (4.12)

modest amount will add up in a hurry. Jay decides to
follow this advice and puts away 1% of his annual salary
of $50,000 per year. This equates to $500 on his 21st
birthday, and his salary will increase by 2% (on average)
every year thereafter until Jay turns 60 years old. What
is the worth of Jay’s account at age 60 when the annual
interest rate on Jay’s account is 4% per year? (4.12)

crease an average of 8% per year for the next 4 years.
The annual cost of tuition at the beginning of your
freshman year in college will be $12,000 (A1). How
much money will you and your parents have to deposit
in a mutual fund account one year prior to your
freshman year to pay for your tuition for the 4 years
you will spend earning your degree in engineering?

a 22-year-old and newly hired
marine biologist, is quick to admit that she does not
plan to keep close tabs on how her 401(k) retirement
plan will grow with time. This sort of thing does not
really interest her. Amy’s contribution, plus that of her
employer, amounts to $2,200 per year starting at age 23.

4-110. The average college graduate owes $22,500 in
loans incurred over his/her college career. Now that it
is so difﬁcult to land a job after graduation, an option
for the graduate seeking relief is to stretch the loan over
20 years (with the bank’s approval, of course) instead of
repaying the loan over the normal 10 years. Doubling
the repayment period of the loan slices 29% off the
monthly payments. However, this action also increases
the total amount of interest repaid over the life of the
loan by 121%! What is the monthly interest rate being
charged in this scenario? (4.15)
4-111. Suppose you owe $1,100 on your credit card.

CHAPTER 5
Evaluating a Single Project
The objective of Chapter 5 is to discuss and critique contemporary methods
for determining project proﬁtability.
Carbon Fibers versus Metal
T
here is a rule-of-thumb that “if the weight of an automobile
can be reduced by 10%, then 6% of the annual cost of gasoline
can be saved.” Light weight and high strength carbon ﬁbers
costing about $15–$20 per pound are currently being considered to replace the
metal in automobile and aerospace applications. (The objective of recent research
is to reduce this cost to $5 per pound.) Engineers believe they can economically
reduce the weight of an automobile by substituting carbon ﬁbers for metal to save
20% to 30% on fuel consumption each year. Other structures such as stronger wind
turbines can also be built with light weight carbon ﬁbers. After working through
this chapter, you will be able to evaluate the economic trade-off between annual
fuel savings and up-front cost of carbon ﬁbers and to determine whether it is a
smart trade-off.

5.1 Introduction
All engineering economy studies of capital projects should consider the return
that a given project will or should produce. A basic question this book addresses
is whether a proposed capital investment and its associated expenditures can be
recovered by revenue (or savings) over time in addition to a return on the capital that
is sufﬁciently attractive in view of the risks involved and the potential alternative
uses. The interest and money–time relationships discussed in Chapter 4 emerge
as essential ingredients in answering this question, and they are applied to many
different types of problems in this chapter.
Because patterns of capital investment, revenue (or savings) cash ﬂows, and
expense cash ﬂows can be quite different in various projects, there is no single
method for performing engineering economic analyses that is ideal for all cases.
Consequently, several methods are commonly used. A project focus will be taken
as we introduce ways of gauging proﬁtability.
In this chapter, we concentrate on the correct use of ﬁve methods for evaluating
the economic proﬁtability of a single proposed problem solution (i.e., alternative).∗
Later, in Chapter 6, multiple alternatives are evaluated. The ﬁve methods described
in Chapter 5 are Present Worth (PW), Future Worth (FW), Annual Worth (AW),
Internal Rate of Return (IRR), and External Rate of Return (ERR). The ﬁrst three
methods convert cash ﬂows resulting from a proposed problem solution into their
equivalent worth at some point (or points) in time by using an interest rate known
as the Minimum Attractive Rate of Return (MARR). The concept of a MARR, as well
as the determination of its value, is discussed in the next section. The IRR and ERR
methods compute annual rates of proﬁt, or returns, resulting from an investment
and are then compared to the MARR.
The payback period is also discussed brieﬂy in this chapter. The payback
period is a measure of the speed with which an investment is recovered by the
cash inﬂows it produces. This measure, in its most common form, ignores time
value of money principles. For this reason, the payback method is often used to
supplement information produced by the ﬁve primary methods featured in this
chapter.
Unless otherwise speciﬁed, the end-of-period cash-ﬂow convention and discrete
compounding of interest are used throughout this and subsequent chapters.
A planning horizon, or study (analysis) period, of N compounding periods
(usually years) is used to evaluate prospective investments throughout the
remainder of the book.
∗The analysis of engineering projects using the beneﬁt–cost ratio method is discussed in Chapter 10.

CHAPTER 5 / EVALUATING A SINGLE PROJECT
5.2 Determining the Minimum Attractive Rate
of Return (MARR)
The Minimum Attractive Rate of Return (MARR) is usually a policy issue resolved
by the top management of an organization in view of numerous considerations.
Among these considerations are the following:
1. The amount of money available for investment, and the source and cost of these
funds (i.e., equity funds or borrowed funds)
2. The number of good projects available for investment and their purpose (i.e.,
whether they sustain present operations and are essential, or whether they
expand on present operations and are elective)
3. The amount of perceived risk associated with investment opportunities
available to the ﬁrm and the estimated cost of administering projects over short
planning horizons versus long planning horizons
4. The type of organization involved (i.e., government, public utility, or private
industry)
In theory, the MARR, which is sometimes called the hurdle rate, should be chosen
to maximize the economic well-being of an organization, subject to the types of
considerations just listed. How an individual ﬁrm accomplishes this in practice
is far from clear-cut and is frequently the subject of discussion. One popular
approach to establishing a MARR involves the opportunity cost viewpoint described
in Chapter 2, and it results from the phenomenon of capital rationing. This situation
may arise when the amount of available capital is insufﬁcient to sponsor all worthy
investment opportunities. The subject of capital rationing is covered in Chapter 13.
A simple example of capital rationing is given in Figure 5-1, where the
cumulative investment requirements of seven acceptable projects are plotted
against the prospective annual rate of proﬁt of each. Figure 5-1 shows a limit of
$600 million on available capital. In view of this limitation, the last funded project
would be E, with a prospective rate of proﬁt of 19% per year, and the best rejected
project is F. In this case, the MARR by the opportunity cost principle would be 16%
per year. By not being able to invest in project F, the ﬁrm would presumably be
forfeiting the chance to realize a 16% annual return. As the amount of investment
capital and opportunities available change over time, the ﬁrm’s MARR will also
change.∗
Superimposed on Figure 5-1 is the approximate cost of obtaining the
$600 million, illustrating that project E is acceptable only as long as its annual
rate of proﬁt exceeds the cost of raising the last $100 million. As shown in Figure
5-1, the cost of capital will tend to increase gradually as larger sums of money are
acquired through increased borrowing (debt) or new issuances of common stock
(equity). Determining the MARR is discussed further in Chapter 13.
∗As we shall see in Chapter 11, the selection of a project may be relatively insensitive to the choice of a value for the
MARR. Revenue estimates, for example, are much more important to the selection of the most proﬁtable investment.

5.3 The Present Worth Method
The PW method is based on the concept of equivalent worth of all cash ﬂows
relative to some base or beginning point in time called the present. That is, all cash
inﬂows and outﬂows are discounted to the present point in time at an interest rate
that is generally the MARR. A positive PW for an investment project is a dollar
amount of proﬁt over the minimum amount required by investors. It is assumed
that cash generated by the alternative is available for other uses that earn interest
at a rate equal to the MARR.
To ﬁnd the PW as a function of i% (per interest period) of a series of cash inﬂows
and outﬂows, it is necessary to discount future amounts to the present by using the
interest rate over the appropriate study period (years, for example) in the following
manner:
PW(i%) = F0(1 + i)0 + F1(1 + i)−1 + F2(1 + i)−2
+ · · · + Fk(1 + i)−k + · · · + FN(1 + i)−N
=
N
!
k=0
Fk(1 + i)−k.
(5-1)
Here,
i = effective interest rate, or MARR, per compounding period;
k = index for each compounding period (0 ≤k ≤N);
Fk = future cash ﬂow at the end of period k;
N = number of compounding periods in the planning horizon (i.e., study
period).

190
CHAPTER 5 / EVALUATING A SINGLE PROJECT
The relationship given in Equation (5-1) is based on the assumption of a constant
interest rate throughout the life of a particular project. If the interest rate is assumed
to change, the PW must be computed in two or more steps, as was illustrated in
Chapter 4.
To apply the PW method of determining a project’s economic worthiness, we
simply compute the present equivalent of all cash ﬂows using the MARR as the
interest rate. If the present worth is greater than or equal to zero, the project is
acceptable.
PW Decision Rule: If PW (i = MARR) ≥0, the project is economically justiﬁed.
It is important to observe that the higher the interest rate and the farther into
the future a cash ﬂow occurs, the lower its PW is. This is shown graphically in
Figure 5-2. The PW of $1,000 10 years from now is $613.90 when i = 5% per year.
However, if i = 10%, that same $1,000 is only worth $385.50 now.

EXAMPLE 5-1
Evaluation of New Equipment Purchase Using PW
A piece of new equipment has been proposed by engineers to increase the
productivity of a certain manual welding operation. The investment cost is
$25,000, and the equipment will have a market value of $5,000 at the end
of a study period of ﬁve years. Increased productivity attributable to the
equipment will amount to $8,000 per year after extra operating costs have
been subtracted from the revenue generated by the additional production.
A cash-ﬂow diagram for this investment opportunity is given below. If the
ﬁrm’s MARR is 20% per year, is this proposal a sound one? Use the PW
method.

Solution
PW = PW of cash inﬂows −PW of cash outﬂows,
or
PW(20%) = $8,000(P/A, 20%, 5) + $5,000(P/F, 20%, 5) −$25,000
= $934.29.
Because PW(20%) ≥0, this equipment is economically justiﬁed.
The MARR in Example 5-1 (and in other examples throughout this chapter)
is to be interpreted as an effective interest rate (i). Here, i = 20% per year. Cash
ﬂows are discrete, end-of-year (EOY) amounts. If continuous compounding had been

192
CHAPTER 5 / EVALUATING A SINGLE PROJECT
speciﬁed for a nominal interest rate (r) of 20% per year, the PW would have been
calculated by using the interest factors presented in Appendix D:
PW( r = 20%) = −$25,000 + $8,000(P/A, r = 20%, 5)
+$5,000(P/F, r = 20%, 5)
= −$25,000 + $8,000(2.8551) + $5,000(0.3679)
= −$319.60.
Consequently, with continuous compounding, the equipment would not be
economically justiﬁable. The reason is that the higher effective annual interest rate
(e0.20 −1 = 0.2214) reduces the PW of future positive cash ﬂows but does not affect
the PW of the capital invested at the beginning of year one.
EXAMPLE 5-2
Present Worth of a Space-Heating System
A retroﬁtted space-heating system is being considered for a small ofﬁce
building. The system can be purchased and installed for $110,000, and it
will save an estimated 300,000 kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electric power each
year over a six-year period. A kilowatt-hour of electricity costs $0.10, and
the company uses a MARR of 15% per year in its economic evaluations of
refurbished systems. The market value of the system will be $8,000 at the end
of six years, and additional annual operating and maintenance expenses are
negligible. Use the PW method to determine whether this system should be
installed.
Solution
To ﬁnd the PW of the proposed heating system, we need to ﬁnd the present
equivalent of all associated cash ﬂows. The estimated annual savings in electrical
power is worth 300,000 kWh × $0.10/kWh = $30,000 per year. At a MARR of
15%, we get
PW(15%) = −$110,000 + $30,000 (P/A, 15%, 6) + $8,000 (P/F, 15%, 6)
= −$110,000 + $30,000(3.7845) + $8,000(0.4323)
= $6,993.40.
SincePW(15%)≥0, weconcludethattheretroﬁttedspace-heatingsystemshould
be installed.
Now that we know how to apply the PW method, we can use it to evaluate the
economic advisability of a solar-powered cooling and heating system. Should a
homeowner’s incremental investment of $10,000 be traded off for energy savings
of $130 per month? Let’s assume a MARR of 0.5% per month and a 20-year useful

SECTION 5.3 / THE PRESENT WORTH METHOD
193
life of the solar-powered system. In this case, the PW of the system is
PW = −$10,000 + $130(P/A, 0.5%, per month, 240 months)
= −$10,000 + $130(139.5808)
= $8,145.50.
The positive-valued PW signals a favorable investment. Additionally, 13 tons/year
× 20 years = 260 tons of carbon dioxide will be avoided. Can you rework this
problem when the MARR is 1% per month? Is the system still a judicious choice?
5.3.1
Assumptions of the PW Method
There are several noteworthy assumptions that we make when using PW to model
the wealth-creating promise of a capital investment opportunity. First, it is assumed
that we know the future with certainty (we don’t live in a certain world!). For
example, we presume to know with certainty future interest rates and other factors.
Second, it is assumed we can borrow and lend money at the same interest rate (i.e.,
capital markets are perfect). Regrettably, the real world has neither certainty nor
perfect (frictionless, e.g., no taxes and/or commissions) capital markets.
The PW (and FW and AW, to follow) model is built on these seemingly
restrictive assumptions, but it is cost-beneﬁcial in the sense that the cost of using
the PW model is less than the beneﬁts of improved decisions resulting from
PW analysis. More sophisticated models exist, but they usually do not reverse
decisions made with the PW model. Therefore, our goal is to cost-beneﬁcially
recommend capital investments that maximize the wealth of a ﬁrm to its owners
(i.e., stockholders). A positive-valued PW (and FW and AW) means that accepting
a project will increase the worth, or value, of the ﬁrm.
5.3.2
Bond Value
A bond is an IOU where you agree to lend the bond issuer money for a speciﬁed
length of time (say, 10 years). In return, you receive periodic interest payments
(e.g., quarterly) from the issuer plus a promise to return the face value of the bond
when it matures. A bond provides an excellent example of commercial value as
being the PW of the future net cash ﬂows that are expected to be received through
ownership of an interest-bearing certiﬁcate. Thus, the value of a bond, at any time,
is the PW of future cash receipts. For a bond, let
Z = face, or par, value;
C = redemption or disposal price (usually equal to Z);
r = bond rate (nominal interest) per interest period;
N = number of periods before redemption;
i = bond yield rate per period;
VN = value (price) of the bond N interest periods prior to
redemption—this is a PW measure of merit.
The owner of a bond is paid two types of payments by the borrower. The ﬁrst
consists of the series of periodic interest payments he or she will receive until the

194
CHAPTER 5 / EVALUATING A SINGLE PROJECT
bond is retired. There will be N such payments, each amounting to rZ. These
constitute an annuity of N payments. In addition, when the bond is retired or sold,
the bondholder will receive a single payment equal in amount to C. The PW of the
bond is the sum of PWs of these two types of payments at the bond’s yield rate (i%):
VN = C(P/F, i%, N) + rZ(P/A, i%, N).
(5-2)
The most common situations faced by you as a potential investor in bonds are
(1) for a desired yield rate, how much should you be willing to pay for the bond
and (2) for a stated purchase price, what will your yield be? Examples 5-3 and 5-4
demonstrate how to solve these types of problems.
EXAMPLE 5-3
Stan Moneymaker Wants to Buy a Bond
Stan Moneymaker has the opportunity to purchase a certain U.S. Treasury bond
that matures in eight years and has a face value of $10,000. This means that Stan
will receive $10,000 cash when the bond’s maturity date is reached. The bond
stipulates a ﬁxed nominal interest rate of 8% per year, but interest payments are
made to the bondholder every three months; therefore, each payment amounts
to 2% of the face value.
Stan would like to earn 10% nominal interest (compounded quarterly) per
year on his investment, because interest rates in the economy have risen since
the bond was issued. How much should Stan be willing to pay for the bond?
Solution
To establish the value of this bond, in view of the stated conditions, the PW
of future cash ﬂows during the next eight years (the study period) must be
evaluated. Interest payments are quarterly. Because Stan Moneymaker desires
to obtain 10% nominal interest per year on the investment, the PW is computed
at i = 10%/4 = 2.5% per quarter for the remaining 8(4) = 32 quarters of the
bond’s life:
VN = $10,000(P/F, 2.5%, 32) + $10,000(0.02)(P/A, 2.5%, 32)
= $4,537.71 + $4,369.84 = $8,907.55.
Thus, Stan should pay no more than $8,907.55 when 10% nominal interest per
year is desired.
EXAMPLE 5-4
Current Price and Annual Yield of Bond Calculations
Abond with a face value of $5,000 pays interest of 8% per year. This bond will be
redeemed at par value at the end of its 20-year life, and the ﬁrst interest payment
is due one year from now.
(a) How much should be paid now for this bond in order to receive a yield of
10% per year on the investment?

SECTION 5.3 / THE PRESENT WORTH METHOD
195
(b) If this bond is purchased now for $4,600, what annual yield would the buyer
receive?
Solution
(a) By using Equation (5-2), the value of VN can be determined:
VN = $5,000(P/F, 10%, 20) + $5,000(0.08)(P/A, 10%, 20)
= $743.00 + $3,405.44 = $4,148.44.
(b) Here, we are given VN = $4,600, and we must ﬁnd the value of i% in
Equation (5-2):
$4,600 = $5,000(P/F, i′%, 20) + $5,000(0.08)(P/A, i′%, 20).
To solve for i′%, we can resort to an iterative trial-and-error procedure (e.g., try
8.5%, 9.0%), to determine that i′% = 8.9% per year.
5.3.3
The Capitalized-Worth Method
One special variation of the PW method discussed in Section 5.3 involves
determining the PW of all revenues or expenses over an inﬁnite length of time. This
is known as the Capitalized-Worth (CW) method. If only expenses are considered,
results obtained by this method are sometimes referred to as capitalized cost. As
will be demonstrated in Chapter 6, the CW method is a convenient basis for
comparing mutually exclusive alternatives when the period of needed service is
indeﬁnitely long.
The CW of a perpetual series of end-of-period uniform payments A, with
interest at i% per period, is A(P/A, i%, ∞). From the interest formulas, it can be
seen that (P/A, i%, N) →1/i as N becomes very large. Thus, CW = A/i for such a
series, as can also be seen from the relation
CW(i%) = PWN→∞= A(P/A, i%, ∞) = A
!
lim
N→∞
(1 + i)N −1

$
.
Hence, the CW of a project with interest at i% per year is the annual equivalent of
the project over its useful life divided by i (as a decimal).
The AW of a series of payments of amount $X at the end of each kth period
with interest at i% per period is $X(A/F, i%, k). The CW of such a series can thus
be calculated as $X(A/F, i%, k)/i.
EXAMPLE 5-5
Determining the Capitalized Worth of a Bridge
A new bridge across the Cumberland River is being planned near a busy high-
way intersection in the commercial part of a mid-western town. The construction
(ﬁrst) cost of the bridge is $1,900,000 and annual upkeep is estimated to be
$25,000. In addition to annual upkeep, major maintenance work is anticipated

196
CHAPTER 5 / EVALUATING A SINGLE PROJECT
every eight years at a cost of $350,000 per occurrence. The town government’s
MARR is 8% per year.
(a) For this problem, what analysis period (N) is, practically speaking, deﬁned
as forever?
(b) If the bridge has an expected life of 50 years, what is the capitalized worth
(CW) of the bridge over a 100-year study period?
Solution
(a) Apractical approximation of “forever” (inﬁnity) is dependent on the interest
rate. By examining the (A/P, i%, N) factor as N increases in the Appendix C
tables, we observe that this factor approaches a value of i as N becomes large.
For i = 8% (Table C-11), the (A/P, 8%, 100) factor is 0.08. So N = 100 years is,
for practical purposes, “forever” in this example.
(b) The CW is determined as follows:
CW(8%) = −$1,900,000 −$1,900,000 (P/F, 8%, 50)
−[$350,000 (A/F, 8%, 8)]/0.08 −$25,000/0.08.
The CW turns out to be −$2,664,220 over a 100-year study period, assuming
the bridge is replaced at the end of year 50 for $1,900,000.
5.4
The Future Worth Method
Because a primary objective of all time value of money methods is to maximize
the future wealth of the owners of a ﬁrm, the economic information provided by
the FW method is very useful in capital investment decision situations. The FW
is based on the equivalent worth of all cash inﬂows and outﬂows at the end of
the planning horizon (study period) at an interest rate that is generally the MARR.
Also, the FW of a project is equivalent to its PW; that is, FW = PW(F/P, i%, N). If
FW ≥0 for a project, it would be economically justiﬁed.
FW Decision Rule: If FW (i = MARR) ≥0, the project is economically justiﬁed.
Equation (5-3) summarizes the general calculations necessary to determine a
project’s FW:
FW(i%) = F0(1 + i)N + F1(1 + i)N−1 + · · · + FN(1 + i)0

= $2,324.80.
Again, the project is shown to be a good investment (FW ≥0). The PW is
a multiple of the equivalent FW value:
PW(20%) = $2,324.80(P/F, 20%, 5) = $934.29.
To this point, the PW and FW methods have used a known and constant
MARR over the study period. Each method produces a measure of merit expressed
in dollars and is equivalent to the other. The difference in economic information
provided is relative to the point in time used (i.e., the present for the PW versus
the future, or end of the study period, for the FW).
EXAMPLE 5-7
Sensitivity Analysis Using FW (Example 5-2 Revisited)
In Example 5-2, the $110,000 retroﬁtted space-heating system was projected to
save $30,000 per year in electrical power and be worth $8,000 at the end of the
six-year study period. Use the FW method to determine whether the project is
still economically justiﬁed if the system has zero market value after six years.
The MARR is 15% per year.
Solution
In this example, we need to ﬁnd the future equivalent of the $110,000 investment
and the $30,000 annual savings at an interest rate of 15% per year.
FW(15%) = −$110,000 (F/P, 15%, 6) + $30,000 (F/A, 15%, 6)
= −$110,000 (2.3131) + $30,000 (8.7537)
= $8,170.
The heating system is still a proﬁtable project (FW ≥0) even if it has no market
value at the end of the study period.
5.5
The Annual Worth Method
The AW of a project is an equal annual series of dollar amounts, for a stated study
period, that is equivalent to the cash inﬂows and outﬂows at an interest rate that is
generally the MARR. Hence, the AW of a project is annual equivalent revenues or

198
CHAPTER 5 / EVALUATING A SINGLE PROJECT
savings (R) minus annual equivalent expenses (E), less its annual equivalent capital
recovery (CR) amount, which is deﬁned in Equation (5-5). An annual equivalent
value of R , E , and CR is computed for the study period, N, which is usually in
years. In equation form, the AW, which is a function of i%, is
AW(i%) = R −E −CR(i%).
(5-4)
Also, we need to notice that the AW of a project is equivalent to its PW and FW.
That is, AW = PW(A/P, i%, N), and AW = FW(A/F, i%, N). Hence, it can be easily
computed for a project from these other equivalent values.
As long as the AW evaluated at the MARR is greater than or equal to zero,
the project is economically attractive; otherwise, it is not. An AW of zero means
that an annual return exactly equal to the MARR has been earned. Many decision
makers prefer the AW method because it is relatively easy to interpret when
they are accustomed to working with annual income statements and cash-ﬂow
summaries.
AW Decision Rule: If AW (i = MARR) ≥0, the project is economically justiﬁed.
The CR amount for a project is the equivalent uniform annual cost of the capital
invested. It is an annual amount that covers the following two items:
1. Loss in value of the asset
2. Interest on invested capital (i.e., at the MARR)
As an example, consider a device that will cost $10,000, last ﬁve years, and have
a salvage (market) value of $2,000. Thus, the loss in value of this asset over ﬁve
years is $8,000. Additionally, the MARR is 10% per year.
It can be shown that, no matter which method of calculating an asset’s loss
in value over time is used, the equivalent annual CR amount is the same. For
example, if a uniform loss in value is assumed ($8,000/5 years = $1,600 per
year), the equivalent annual CR amount is calculated to be $2,310, as shown in
Table 5-1.
There are several convenient formulas by which the CR amount (cost) may
be calculated to obtain the result in Table 5-1. Probably the easiest formula to
understand involves ﬁnding the annual equivalent of the initial capital investment
and then subtracting the annual equivalent of the salvage value.∗Thus,
CR(i%) = I(A/P, i%, N) −S(A/F, i%, N),
(5-5)
∗The following two equations are alternative ways of calculating the CR amount:
CR(i%) = (I −S)(A/F, i%, N) + I(i%);
CR(i%) = (I −S)(A/P, i%, N) + S(i%).
It is left as a student exercise to show that the above equations are equivalent to Equation (5-5).

S = salvage (market) value at the end of the study period;

Thus, by substituting the CR(i%) expression of Equation (5-5) into the AW
expression, Equation (5-4) becomes
AW(i%) = R −E −I(A/P, i%, N) + S(A/F, i%, N).
When Equation (5-5) is applied to the example in Table 5-1, the CR cost is
CR(10%) = $10,000(A/P, 10%, 5) −$2,000(A/F, 10%, 5)
= $10,000(0.2638) −$2,000(0.1638) = $2,310.

= $312.40.
∗In some cases, the investment will be spread over several periods. In such situations, I is the PW of all investment
amounts.

200
CHAPTER 5 / EVALUATING A SINGLE PROJECT
Because its AW(20%) is positive, the equipment more than pays for itself over
a period of ﬁve years, while earning a 20% return per year on the unrecovered
investment. In fact, the annual equivalent “surplus” is $312.40, which means
that the equipment provided more than a 20% return on beginning-of-year
unrecovered investment. This piece of equipment should be recommended as
an attractive investment opportunity. Also, we can conﬁrm that the AW(20%)
is equivalent to PW(20%) = $934.29 in Example 5-1 and FW(20%) = $2,324.80 in
Example 5-6. That is,
AW(20%) = $934.29(A/P, 20%, 5) = $312.40, and also
AW(20%) = $2,324.80(A/F, 20%, 5) = $312.40.
When revenues are absent in Equation (5-4), we designate this metric as
EUAC(i%) and call it “equivalent uniform annual cost.” A low-valued EUAC(i%)
is preferred to a high-valued EUAC(i%).
EXAMPLE 5-9
Equivalent Uniform Annual Cost of a Corporate Jet
A corporate jet costs $1,350,000 and will incur $200,000 per year in ﬁxed costs
(maintenance, licenses, insurance, and hangar rental) and $277 per hour in
variable costs (fuel, pilot expense, etc.). The jet will be operated for 1,200 hours
per year for ﬁve years and then sold for $650,000. The MARR is 15% per year.
(a) Determine the capital recovery cost of the jet.
(b) What is the EUAC of the jet?
Solution
(a) CR = $1,350,000 (A/P, 15%, 5) −$650,000 (A/F, 15%, 5) = $306,310.
(b) The total annual expense for the jet is the sum of the ﬁxed costs and the
variable costs.
E = $200,000 + (1,200 hours)($277/hour) = $532,400
EUAC(15%) = $532,400 + $306,310 = $838,710
EXAMPLE 5-10
Determination of Annual Savings by Using the AW Method
(Example 5-2 Revisited)
Consider the retroﬁtted space-heating system described in Example 5-2. Given
the investment of $110,000 and market value of $8,000 at the end of the six-year
study period, what is the minimum annual electrical power savings (in kWh)

SECTION 5.5 / THE ANNUAL WORTH METHOD
201
required to make this project economically acceptable? The MARR = 15% per
year and electricity costs $0.10 per kWh.
Solution
To make this project acceptable, the annual power savings must be at least as
great as the annual CR amount. Using Equation (5-5),
CR = $110,000(A/P, 15%, 6) −$8,000 (A/F, 15%, 6) = $28,148.40.
This value ($28,148.40) is the minimum annual dollar savings needed to justify
the space-heating system. This equates to
$28,148.40
$0.10/kWh = 281,480 kWh per year.
If the space-heating system can save 281,480 kWh per year, it is economically
justiﬁed (exactly 15% is earned on the beginning-of-year unrecovered invest-
ment). Any savings greater than 281,480 kWh per year (such as the original
estimate of 300,000 kWh per year) will serve to make this project even more
attractive.
EXAMPLE 5-11
Avoid Getting Fleeced on an Auto Lease
Automobile leases are built around three factors: negotiated sales price, residual
value, and interest rate. The residual value is what the dealership expects the
car’s value will be when the vehicle is returned at the end of the lease period. The
monthly cost of the lease is the capital recovery amount determined by using
these three factors.
(a) Determine the monthly lease payment for a car that has an agreed-upon sales
price of $34,995, an APR of 9% compounded monthly, and an estimated
residual value of $20,000 at the end of a 36-month lease.∗An up-front
payment of $3,000 is due when the lease agreement (contract) is signed.
(b) If the estimated residual value is raised to $25,000 by the dealership to get
your business, how much will the monthly payment be?
Solution
(a) The effective sales price is $31,995 ($34,995 less the $3,000 due at signing). The
monthly interest rate is 9%/12 = 0.75% per month. So the capital recovery
amount is:
CR = $31,995(A/P, 0.75%, 36) −$20,000(A/F, 0.75%, 36)
= $1,017.44 −$486
= $531.44 per month.
∗There are many excellent Web sites offering free calculators for car loans, home mortgages, life insurance,
and credit cards. In this regard, check out www.choosetosave.org.

202
CHAPTER 5 / EVALUATING A SINGLE PROJECT
(b) The capital recovery amount is now $1,017.44 −$25,000 (A/F, 0.75%, 36) =
$409.94 per month. But the customer might experience an actual residual
value of less than $25,000 and have to pay the difference in cash when the
car is returned after 36 months. This is the “trap” that many experience
when they lease a car, so be careful not to drive the car excessively or to
damage it in any way.
5.6
The Internal Rate of Return Method
The IRR method is the most widely used rate-of-return method for performing
engineering economic analyses. It is sometimes called by several other names, such
as the investor’s method, the discounted cash-ﬂow method, and the proﬁtability index.
This method solves for the interest rate that equates the equivalent worth of
an alternative’s cash inﬂows (receipts or savings) to the equivalent worth of cash
outﬂows (expenditures, including investment costs). Equivalent worth may be
computed using any of the three methods discussed earlier. The resultant interest
rate is termed the Internal Rate of Return (IRR). The IRR is sometimes referred to as
the breakeven interest rate.
For a single alternative, from the lender’s viewpoint, the IRR is not positive unless
(1) both receipts and expenses are present in the cash-ﬂow pattern, and (2) the sum of receipts
exceeds the sum of all cash outﬂows. Be sure to check both of these conditions in order
to avoid the unnecessary work involved in ﬁnding that the IRR is negative. (Visual
inspection of the total net cash ﬂow will determine whether the IRR is zero or less.)
Using a PW formulation, we see that the IRR is the i′%∗at which
N

Rk(P/F, i′%, k) =

(5-6)
where
Rk = net revenues or savings for the kth year;
Ek = net expenditures, including any investment costs for the kth year;
N = project life (or study period).
Once i′ has been calculated, it is compared with the MARR to assess whether the
alternative in question is acceptable. If i′ ≥MARR, the alternative is acceptable;
otherwise, it is not.
IRR Decision Rule: If IRR ≥MARR, the project is economically justiﬁed.
A popular variation of Equation (5-6) for computing the IRR for an alternative
is to determine the i′ at which its net PW is zero. In equation form, the IRR is the

(5-7)
For an alternative with a single investment cost at the present time followed by
a series of positive cash inﬂows over N, a graph of PW versus the interest rate
typically has the general convex form shown in Figure 5-3. The point at which
PW = 0 in Figure 5-3 deﬁnes i′%, which is the project’s IRR. The value of i′% can
also be determined as the interest rate at which FW = 0 or AW = 0.
Another way to interpret the IRR is through an investment-balance diagram.
Figure 5-4 shows how much of the original investment in an alternative is still to
be recovered as a function of time. The downward arrows in Figure 5-4 represent
annualreturns, (Rk−Ek) for 1 ≤k ≤N, against the unrecovered investment, andthe
dashed lines indicate the opportunity cost of interest, or proﬁt, on the beginning-
of-year investment balance. The IRR is the value of i′ in Figure 5-4 that causes the
unrecovered investment balance to exactly equal zero at the end of the study period (year
N) and thus represents the internal earning rate of a project. It is important to notice
that i′% is calculated on the beginning-of-year unrecovered investment through the
life of a project rather than on the total initial investment.
The method of solving Equations (5-6) and (5-7) normally involves trial-and-
error calculations until the i′% is converged upon or can be interpolated. Example
5-12 presents a typical solution. We also demonstrate how a spreadsheet application
signiﬁcantly assists in the computation of the IRR.

CHAPTER 5 / EVALUATING A SINGLE PROJECT
EXAMPLE 5-12
Economic Desirability of a Project Using the IRR Method
AMT, Inc., is considering the purchase of a digital camera for the maintenance
of design speciﬁcations by feeding digital pictures directly into an engineering
workstation where computer-aided design ﬁles can be superimposed over
the digital pictures. Differences between the two images can be noted, and
corrections, as appropriate, can then be made by design engineers. The capital
investment requirement is $345,000 and the estimated market value of the
system after a six-year study period is $115,000. Annual revenues attributable
to the new camera system will be $120,000, whereas additional annual expenses
will be $22,000. You have been asked by management to determine the IRR of
this project and to make a recommendation. The corporation’s MARR is 20% per
year. Solve ﬁrst by using linear interpolation and then by using a spreadsheet.
Solution by Linear Interpolation
In this example, we can easily see that the sum of positive cash ﬂows ($835,000)
exceedsthesumofnegativecashﬂows($455,000). Thus, itislikelythatapositive-
valued IRR can be determined. By writing an equation for the PW of the project’s
total net cash ﬂow and setting it equal to zero, we can compute the IRR:
PW = 0 = −$345,000 + ($120,000 −$22,000)(P/A, i′%, 6)
+ $115,000(P/F, i′%, 6)
i′% = ?
To use linear interpolation, we ﬁrst need to try a few values for i′. Agood starting
point is to use the MARR.
At i′ = 20%:
PW = −$345,000 + $98,000(3.3255) + $115,000(0.3349)
= +$19,413
Since the PW is positive at 20%, we know that i′ > 20%.
At i′ = 25%:
PW = −$345,000 + $98,000(2.9514) + $115,000(0.2621)
= −$25,621
Now that we have both a positive and a negative PW, the answer is bracketed
(20% ≤i′% ≤25%). The dashed curve in Figure 5-5 is what we are linearly
approximating. Theanswer, i′%, canbedeterminedbyusingthesimilartriangles

$19,413 −$0
i′ ≈22.16%.
Because the IRR of the project (22.16%) is greater than the MARR, the project is
acceptable.

EXAMPLE 5-13
Evaluation of New Equipment Purchase, Using the Internal
Rate of Return Method (Example 5-1 Revisited)
A piece of new equipment has been proposed by engineers to increase the
productivity of a certain manual welding operation. The investment cost is
$25,000, and the equipment will have a market (salvage) value of $5,000 at the
end of its expected life of ﬁve years. Increased productivity attributable to the
equipment will amount to $8,000 per year after extra operating costs have been
subtracted from the value of the additional production. Use a spreadsheet to
evaluate the IRR of the proposed equipment. Is the investment a good one?
Recall that the MARR is 20% per year.

and market value) are combined into a single entry for the direct computation
of the IRR via the IRR function. The IRR for the proposed piece of equipment is
21.58%, which is greater than the MARR of 20%. Thus, we conclude that the new
equipment is economically feasible. We reached the same conclusion by using
the equivalent worth method in previous examples, summarized as follows:
Example 5-1
PW(20%) = $934.29;
Example 5-6
FW(20%) = $2,324.80; and
Example 5-8
AW(20%) = $312.40.
Figure 5-7(b) is a graph of the PW of the proposed equipment as a function
of the interest rate, i. For the given problem data, the graph shows the IRR to
be approximately 22%. This graph can be used to get a feel for how the IRR
ﬂuctuates with changes in the original cash-ﬂow estimates. For example, if the
net annual savings estimate [cell B5 of Figure 5-7(a)] is revised to be $7,500, the
graph would update and show the IRR to be 19%, and the project would no
longer be economically viable.

208
CHAPTER 5 / EVALUATING A SINGLE PROJECT
A ﬁnal point needs to be made for Example 5-13. The investment-balance
diagram is provided in Figure 5-8, and the reader should notice that i′ = 21.577% is
a rate of return calculated on the beginning-of-year unrecovered investment. The
IRR is not an average return each year based on the total investment of $25,000.
5.6.1
Installment Financing
A rather common application of the IRR method is in so-called installment ﬁnancing
types of problems. These problems are associated with ﬁnancing arrangements for
purchasing merchandise “on time.” The total interest, or ﬁnance, charge is often
paid by the borrower on the basis of what amount is owed at the beginning of the
loan instead of on the unpaid loan balance, as illustrated in Figure 5-8. Usually,
the average unpaid loan balance is about one-half of the initial amount borrowed.
Clearly, a ﬁnance charge based solely on the entire amount of money borrowed
involves payment of interest on money not actually borrowed for the full term.
This practice leads to an actual interest rate that often greatly exceeds the stated
interest rate. To determine the true interest rate being charged in such cases, the IRR
method is frequently employed. Examples 5-14, 5-15, and 5-16 are representative
installment-ﬁnancing problems.

EXAMPLE 5-14
Do You Know What Your Effective Interest Rate Is?
In 1915, Albert Epstein allegedly borrowed $7,000 from a large New York bank
on the condition that he would repay 7% of the loan every three months, until

SECTION 5.6 / THE INTERNAL RATE OF RETURN METHOD
209
a total of 50 payments had been made. At the time of the 50th payment, the
$7,000 loan would be completely repaid. Albert computed his annual interest
rate to be [0.07($7,000) × 4]/$7,000 = 0.28 (28%).
(a) What true effective annual interest rate did Albert pay?
(b) What, if anything, was wrong with his calculation?
Solution
(a) The true interest rate per quarter is found by equating the equivalent value
of the amount borrowed to the equivalent value of the amounts repaid.
Equating the AW amounts per quarter, we ﬁnd
$7,000(A/P, i′%/quarter, 50 quarters) = 0.07($7,000) per quarter,
(A/P, i′%, 50) = 0.07.
Linearly interpolating to ﬁnd i′%/quarter by using similar triangles is the
next step:
(A/P, 6%, 50) = 0.0634,
(A/P, 7%, 50) = 0.0725.

CHAPTER 5 / EVALUATING A SINGLE PROJECT
Now we can compute the effective i′% per year that Albert was paying:
i′% = [(1.0673)4 −1]100%
≃30% per year.
(b) Even though Albert’s answer of 28% is close to the true value of 30%, his
calculation is insensitive to how long his payments were made. For instance,
he would get 28% for an answer when 20, 50, or 70 quarterly payments
of $490 were made! For 20 quarterly payments, the true effective interest
rate is 14.5% per year, and for 70 quarterly payments, it is 31% per year.
As more payments are made, the true annual effective interest rate being
charged by the bank will increase, but Albert’s method would not reveal by
how much.
Another Solution
When the initial loan amount, the payment amount, and the number of
payments are known, Excel has a useful ﬁnancial function, RATE (nper, pmt,
pv), that will return the interest rate per period. For this example,
RATE(50, −490, 7000) = 6.73%.
This is the same quarterly interest rate we obtained via linear interpolation in
Part (a).
EXAMPLE 5-15
Be Careful with “Fly-by-Night” Financing!
The Fly-by-Night ﬁnance company advertises a “bargain 6% plan” for ﬁnancing
the purchase of automobiles. To the amount of the loan being ﬁnanced, 6% is
added for each year money is owed. This total is then divided by the number of
months over which the payments are to be made, and the result is the amount of
the monthly payments. For example, a woman purchases a $10,000 automobile
under this plan and makes an initial cash payment of $2,500. She wishes to pay
the $7,500 balance in 24 monthly payments:
Purchase price
= $10,000
−Initial payment

∴Monthly payments (A) = $8,400/24
=
$350
What effective annual rate of interest does she actually pay?

SECTION 5.6 / THE INTERNAL RATE OF RETURN METHOD
211
Solution
Because there are to be 24 payments of $350 each, made at the end of each
month, these constitute an annuity (A) at some unknown rate of interest, i′%,
that should be computed only upon the unpaid balance instead of on the entire
$7,500 borrowed. A cash-ﬂow diagram of this situation is shown below.

End of Month

In this example, the amount owed on the automobile (i.e., the initial unpaid
balance) is $7,500, so the following equivalence expression is employed to
compute the unknown monthly interest rate:
P0 = A(P/A, i′%, N),
$7,500 = $350/month(P/A, i′%, 24 months),
(P/A, i′%, 24) = $7,500
$350 = 21.43.
Examining the interest tables for P/A factors at N = 24 that come closest to 21.43,
we ﬁnd that (P/A, 3/4%, 24) = 21.8891 and (P/A, 1%, 24) = 21.2434.
Using the linear interpolation procedure, the IRR is computed as 0.93% per
month∗, since payments are monthly. The nominal rate paid on the borrowed
money is 0.93%(12) = 11.16% compounded monthly. This corresponds to an
effective annual interest rate of [(1 + 0.0093)12 −1] × 100% ∼= 12%. What
appeared at ﬁrst to be a real bargain turns out to involve effective annual interest
attwicethestatedrate. Thereasonisthat, ontheaverage, only$3,750isborrowed
over the two-year period, but interest on $7,500 over 24 months was charged by
the ﬁnance company.
∗Using Excel, RATE(24, −350, 7500) = 0.93%.
EXAMPLE 5-16
Effective Interest Rate for Purchase of New Aircraft Equipment
A small airline executive charter company needs to borrow $160,000 to pur-
chase a prototype synthetic vision system for one of its business jets. The SVS is
intendedtoimprovethepilots’situationalawarenesswhenvisibilityisimpaired.
The local (and only) banker makes this statement: “We can loan you $160,000 at
a very favorable rate of 12% per year for a ﬁve-year loan. However, to secure this

212
CHAPTER 5 / EVALUATING A SINGLE PROJECT
loan, you must agree to establish a checking account (with no interest) in which
the minimum average balance is $32,000. In addition, your interest payments
are due at the end of each year, and the principal will be repaid in a lump-sum
amount at the end of year ﬁve.” What is the true effective annual interest rate
being charged?
Solution
The cash-ﬂow diagram from the banker’s viewpoint appears below. When
solving for an unknown interest rate, it is good practice to draw a cash-
ﬂow diagram prior to writing an equivalence relationship. Notice that P0 =
$160,000 −$32,000 = $128,000. Because the bank is requiring the company
to open an account worth $32,000, the bank is only $128,000 out of pocket.
This same principal applies to F5 in that the company only needs to repay
$128,000 since the $32,000 on deposit can be used to repay the original principal.
P0 ! $128,000 (! $160,000 " $32,000)
F5 ! $128,000
A ! 0.12($160,000) ! $19,200

End of Year
The interest rate (IRR) that establishes equivalence between positive and
negative cash ﬂows can now easily be computed:∗
P0 = F5(P/F, i′%, 5) + A(P/A, i′%, 5),
$128,000 = $128,000(P/F, i′%, 5) + $19,200(P/A, i′%, 5).
If we try i′ = 15%, we discover that $128,000 = $128,000. Therefore, the true
effective interest rate is 15% per year.
∗Several Web sites provide excellent tutorials for equivalent worth (e.g., PW) and rate-of-return calculations.
For example, see www.investopedia.com and www.datadynamica.com/IRR.asp.
5.6.2
Difﬁculties Associated with the IRR Method
The PW, AW, and FW methods assume that net receipts less expenses (positive
recovered funds) each period are reinvested at the MARR during the study
period, N. However, the IRR method is not limited by this common assumption

SECTION 5.7 / THE EXTERNAL RATE OF RETURN METHOD
213
and measures the internal earning rate of an investment.∗The reinvestment rate
for the IRR method is the computed value of the IRR.
Two difﬁculties with the IRR method are its computational difﬁculty and the
occurrence of multiple IRRs in some types of problems. A procedure for dealing
with seldom-experienced multiple rates of return is discussed and demonstrated in
Appendix 5-A. Generally speaking, multiple rates are not meaningful for decision-
making purposes, and another method of evaluation (e.g., PW) should be utilized.
Another possible drawback to the IRR method is that it must be carefully
applied and interpreted in the analysis of two or more alternatives when only one
of them is to be selected (i.e., mutually exclusive alternatives). This is discussed
further in Chapter 6. The key advantage of the method is its widespread acceptance
by industry, where various types of rates of return and ratios are routinely used in
making project selections. The difference between a project’s IRR and the required
return (i.e., MARR) is viewed by management as a measure of investment safety.
A large difference signals a wider margin of safety (or less relative risk). Another
difﬁculty of the IRR method is that the actual reinvestment rate may be much lower
than the computed IRR.
5.7
The External Rate of Return Method†
The reinvestment assumption of the IRR method may not be valid in an engineering
economy study. For instance, if a ﬁrm’s MARR is 20% per year and the IRR for a
projectis42.4%, itmaynotbepossiblefortheﬁrmtoreinvestnetcashproceedsfrom
the project at much more than 20%. This situation, coupled with the computational
demands and possible multiple interest rates associated with the IRR method, has
givenrisetootherrateofreturnmethodsthatcanremedysomeoftheseweaknesses.
One such method is the ERR method. It directly takes into account the interest
rate (∈) external to a project at which net cash ﬂows generated (or required) by the
project over its life can be reinvested (or borrowed). If this external reinvestment
rate, which is usually the ﬁrm’s MARR, happens to equal the project’s IRR, then
the ERR method produces results identical to those of the IRR method.
In general, three steps are used in the calculating procedure. First, all net cash
outﬂows are discounted to time zero (the present) at ∈% per compounding period.
Second, all net cash inﬂows are compounded to period N at ∈%. Third, the ERR,
which is the interest rate that establishes equivalence between the two quantities,
is determined. The absolute value of the present equivalent worth of the net cash
outﬂows at ∈% (ﬁrst step) is used in this last step. In equation form, the ERR is the
i′% at which

∗See H. Bierman and S. Smidt, The Capital Budgeting Decision: Economic Analysis of Investment Projects, 8th ed. (Upper
Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall, 1993). The term internal rate of return means that the value of this measure depends
only on the cash ﬂows from an investment and not on any assumptions about reinvestment rates: “One does not
need to know the reinvestment rates to compute the IRR. However, one may need to know the reinvestment rates to
compare alternatives” (p. 60).
† This method is also known as the “modiﬁed internal rate of return” (MIRR) method. For example, see C. S. Park and
G. P. Sharp-Bette, Advanced Engineering Economy. (New York: John Wiley & Sons, 1990), 223–226.

A project is acceptable when i′% of the ERR method is greater than or equal to the
ﬁrm’s MARR.
ERR Decision Rule: If ERR ≥MARR, the project is economically justiﬁed.
The ERR method has two basic advantages over the IRR method:
1. It can usually be solved for directly, without needing to resort to trial and error.
2. It is not subject to the possibility of multiple rates of return. (Note: The multiple-
rate-of-return problem with the IRR method is discussed in Appendix 5-A.)
EXAMPLE 5-17
Calculation of the ERR
Referring to Example 5-13, suppose that ∈= MARR = 20% per year. What is the
project’s ERR, and is the project acceptable?
Solution
By utilizing Equation (5-8), we have the following relationship to solve for i′:
$25,000(F/P, i′%, 5) = $8,000(F/A, 20%, 5) + $5,000,
(F/P, i′%, 5) = $64,532.80
$25,000
= 2.5813 = (1 + i′)5,
i′ = 20.88%.
Because i′ > MARR, the project is justiﬁed, but just barely.

if, for some reason, part or all of the funds related to a project are “handled”

The i′% is less than the MARR = 20%; therefore, this project would be

5.8
The Payback (Payout) Period Method
All methods presented thus far reﬂect the proﬁtability of a proposed alternative
for a study period of N. The payback method, which is often called the simple
payout method, mainly indicates a project’s liquidity rather than its proﬁtability.
Historically, the payback method has been used as a measure of a project’s
riskiness, since liquidity deals with how fast an investment can be recovered.Alow-
valued payback period is considered desirable. Quite simply, the payback method
calculates the number of years required for cash inﬂows to just equal cash outﬂows.
Hence, the simple payback period is the smallest value of θ(θ ≤N) for which this
relationship is satisﬁed under our normal EOY cash-ﬂow convention. For a project
where all capital investment occurs at time 0, we have
θ
!
k=1
(Rk −Ek) −I ≥0.
(5-9)

216
CHAPTER 5 / EVALUATING A SINGLE PROJECT
The simple payback period, θ, ignores the time value of money and all cash
ﬂows that occur after θ. If this method is applied to the investment project in
Example 5-13, the number of years required for the undiscounted sum of cash
inﬂows to exceed the initial investment is four years. This calculation is shown in
Column 3 of Table 5-2. Only when θ = N (the last time period in the planning
horizon) is the market (salvage) value included in the determination of a payback
period. As can be seen from Equation (5-9), the payback period does not indicate
anything about project desirability except the speed with which the investment
will be recovered. The payback period can produce misleading results, and it is
recommended as supplemental information only in conjunction with one or more
of the ﬁve methods previously discussed.
Sometimes, the discounted payback period, θ′(θ′ ≤N), is calculated so that the
time value of money is considered. In this case,
θ′
!
k=1
(Rk −Ek)(P/F, i%, k) −I ≥0,
(5-10)
where i% is the MARR, I is the capital investment usually made at the present
time (k = 0), and θ′ is the smallest value that satisﬁes Equation (5-10). Table 5-2
(Columns 4 and 5) also illustrates the determination of θ′ for Example 5-13. Notice
that θ′ is the ﬁrst year in which the cumulative discounted cash inﬂows exceed the
$25,000 capital investment. Payback periods of three years or less are often desired
in U.S. industry, so the project in Example 5-13 could be rejected, even though
it is proﬁtable. [IRR = 21.58%, PW(20%) = $934.29.] The simple and discounted
payback periods are shown graphically in Figure 5-9.

EXAMPLE 5-19
Determining the Simple Payback Period
Apublic school is being renovated for $13.5 million. The building has geothermal
heating and cooling, high-efﬁciency windows, and a solar array that permits
the school to sell electricity back to the local electric utility. The annual value of
these beneﬁts is estimated to be $2.7 million. In addition, the residual value of
the school at the end of its 40-year life is negligible. What is the simple payback
period and internal rate of return for the renovated school?
Solution
The simple payback period is
$13.5 million
$2.7 million/year = 5 years.
This is fairly good for a publically sponsored project. The IRR can be computed
using the equation
0 = −$13.5 million + $2.7 million (P/A, i′%, 40),
yielding i’% (the IRR) = 20% per year. The IRR indicates the project is proﬁtable
for a MARR of 20% per year or less.
This variation (θ′) of the simple payback period produces the breakeven life of
a project, in view of the time value of money. However, neither payback period
calculation includes cash ﬂows occurring after θ (or θ′). This means that θ (or θ′)
may not take into consideration the entire useful life of physical assets. Thus,

218
CHAPTER 5 / EVALUATING A SINGLE PROJECT
these methods will be misleading if one alternative has a longer (less desirable)
payback period than another but produces a higher rate of return (or PW) on the
invested capital.
Using the payback period to make investment decisions should generally be
avoided except as a secondary measure of how quickly invested capital will be
recovered, which is an indicator of project risk. The simple payback and discounted
payback period methods tell us how long it takes cash inﬂows from a project to
accumulate to equal (or exceed) the project’s cash outﬂows. The longer it takes to
recover invested monies, the greater is the perceived riskiness of a project.
5.9
CASE STUDY—A Proposed Capital Investment to Improve Process Yield
Many engineering projects aim at improving facility utilization and process yields.
This case study illustrates an engineering economy analysis related to the redesign
of a major component in the manufacture of semiconductors.
Semiconductor manufacturing involves taking a ﬂat disc of silicon, called
a wafer, and depositing many layers of material on top of it. Each layer has a
pattern on it that, upon completion, deﬁnes the electrical circuits of the ﬁnished
microprocessor. Each 8-inch wafer has up to 100 microprocessors on it. However,
the typical average yield of the production line is 75% good microprocessors
per wafer.
At one local company, the process engineers responsible for the chemical-
vapor-deposition (CVD) tool (i.e., process equipment) that deposits one of the many
layers have an idea for improving overall yield. They propose to improve this tool’s
vacuum with a redesign of one of its major components. The engineers believe the
project will result in a 2% increase in the average production yield of nondefective
microprocessors per wafer.
This company has only one CVD tool, and it can process 10 wafers per hour. The
process engineers have determined that the CVD tool has an average utilization
rate (i.e., “time running”) of 80%. A wafer costs $5,000 to manufacture, and a
good microprocessor can be sold for $100. These semiconductor fabrication plants
(“fabs”) operate 168 hours per week, and all good microprocessors produced can
be sold.
The capital investment required for the project is $250,000, and maintenance
and support expenses are expected to be $25,000 per month. The lifetime of the
modiﬁed tool will be ﬁve years, and the company uses a 12% MARR per year
(compounded monthly) as its “hurdle rate.”
Before implementing the proposed engineering solution, top management has
posed the following questions to you (hired as an independent consultant) to
evaluate the merits of the proposal:
(a) Based on the PW method, should the project be approved?
(b) If the achievable improvement in production yield has been overestimated by
the process engineers, at what percent yield improvement would the project
breakeven?

SECTION 5.9 / CASE STUDY—A PROPOSED CAPITAL INVESTMENT TO IMPROVE PROCESS YIELD
219
Solution
You start your economic evaluation of the engineering proposal by ﬁrst calculating
the production rate of wafers. The average number of wafers per week is
(10 wafers/hour) × (168 hours/week) × (0.80) = 1,344.
Since the cost per wafer is $5,000 and good microprocessors can be sold for
$100 each, you determine that proﬁt is earned on each microprocessor produced
and sold after the 50th microprocessor on each wafer. Thus, the 2% increase in
production yield is all proﬁt (i.e., from 75 good microprocessors per wafer on the
average to 76.5). The corresponding additional proﬁt per wafer is $150. The added
proﬁt per month, assuming a month is (52 weeks/year ÷ 12 months per year) =
4.333 weeks, is
(1,344 wafers/week)(4.333 weeks/month)($150/wafer) = $873,533.
Therefore, the PW of the project is
PW(1%) = −$250,000 −$25,000(P/A, 1% per month, 60 months)
+ $873,533(P/A, 1%, 60)
= $37,898,813.
You advise company management that, based on PW, the project should be
undertaken.
It is known that at the breakeven point, proﬁt equals zero. That is, the PW of
the project is equal to zero, or PW of costs = PW of revenues. In other words,
$1,373,875 = (1,344 wafers/week) × (4.333 weeks/month) × ($X/wafer)
× (P/A, 1%, 60),
where X = $100 times the number of extra microprocessors per wafer. Then,
$1,373,875
(1,344)(4.333)(44.955) = X, or X ∼= $5.25 per wafer.
Thus, ($5.25/$100) = 0.0525 extra microprocessors per wafer (total of 75.0525)
equates PW of costs to PW of revenues. This corresponds to a breakeven increase
in yield of
1.5 die per wafer
0.0525 die per wafer =
2.0% increase
breakeven increase,
or breakeven increase in yield = 0.07%.
You advise management that an increase of only 0.07% in process yield would
enable the project to breakeven. Thus, although management may believe that the
process engineers have overestimated projected process yield improvements in the
past, there is quite a bit of “economic safety margin” provided by the engineers
in their current projection of process yield improvement as long as the other
assumptions concerning the average utilization rate of the CVD tool, the wafer
production rate, and the plant operating hours are valid.

CHAPTER 5 / EVALUATING A SINGLE PROJECT

Electronic Spreadsheet Modeling:
Payback Period Method
We continue modeling skill development with a spreadsheet that determines both
the simple and discounted payback periods. Like the learning curve model in
Section3.6, thismodelwascreatedincrementally: (1)thesimplepaybackmodelwas
created and validated, then (2) the discounted payback enhancement was added
by inserting the Discount Factor and Adjusted Cash Flows columns. This piecewise
approach is common as models become more complex.
Equation (5-9) contains four variables used to determine the simple payback
period: annual revenue (Rk), annual expense (Ek), the capital investment (I), and
the number of years (k). For greater ﬂexibility, we use separate columns for the
annual revenues and expenses as seen in Figure 5-10. Input values not directly tied
to each row are placed in the upper left corner of the worksheet for ease of location
and modiﬁcation.
The remaining infrastructure consists of columns for Period, Revenue, Expense,
Net Cash Flow, Discount Factor, Adjusted Cash Flow, Cumulative Cash Flow, and Payback
Period. Rows represent each period. Following the conventions in the Chapter 3
model, cells for user input are outlined. These are B3:B4, B7, and B8:C12. We
arbitrarily selected a 5-year study period, knowing that we can extend the study
period by copying the base formulas down the worksheet.
The next step is to create the base formulas needed to determine the payback
period. The formula in cell C7 transfers the initial investment in B4 to the work
area. Cell D7 contains the ﬁrst intermediate calculation, which determines the net
cash ﬂow for each period.
Cell E7 calculates the present worth factor based on the time period and the
MARR. Cell F7 adjusts the net cash ﬂow value for the time value of money. If
the MARR is zero, the present worth factor is unity and the net cash ﬂows are
unaffected, resulting in the simple payback period. A positive MARR results in the
discounted payback period.
The basic infrastructure to support the results area is complete. The next step
is to incorporate the summation operation from Equation (5-9) to determine the
payback period, which involves a cumulative sum from k = 0, up to the end of
eachperiod. Todothiswithasingleformula, weusemixedaddressing, asdescribed
in Appendix A. This model introduces a new level of complexity. The measure of
merit is no longer the result of a single calculation, but of an accumulation of other
calculations.
The payback period is the smallest positive value of θ. To make this transition
from negative to positive stand out, we format column G so that negative values
are blue and positive values are black. To further enhance the visibility of the
result, column H uses an IF function to display a blank if the cumulative cash ﬂows
are less than or equal to zero, or the period number if the cumulative cash ﬂows
are positive. As this is the ﬁnal answer, the range is shaded in a different color to
make it more prominent. Cell H5 contains a formula to label the type of analysis,
simple or discounted, to emphasize the measure of merit used.

Figure 5-10
Final Spreadsheet Model for Simple and Discounted Payback Period Methods

222
CHAPTER 5 / EVALUATING A SINGLE PROJECT
The ﬁnal step in creating the model is to copy all of the base cell formulas down
the worksheet. Highlight D7:H7 and copy down to row 12. If the payback period
is greater than 5 years, simply copy the formulas further down the worksheet.
The model shows values of 4 and 5 in column H. As the payback period is the
smallest value of θ, we conclude that the payback period is 4 years, assuming the
time period is years. We know that this is the simple payback period because of
the label in H5, as well as an MARR of zero.
Errors are an unfortunate fact of spreadsheet models. The errors in formulas,
logic, or use can be there from the start, or enter over time. This model provides
a Notes area to help users understand the input requirements and the results,
a Key area to highlight the functions of the various infrastructure cells, and a
Documentation area that displays the original unique formulas as well as their
purpose. This last area is used to verify that the formulas have remained unchanged
with use.
While the payback criterion model is complete and we have a solution, the
modeling process is not yet over. Remember that models, no matter how elegant
and detailed, are simpliﬁcations of reality. As such, they need to be explored before
you can have conﬁdence in the results.
In this particular model, we can explore the impact of changes in investment,
annual revenues, and annual expenses on the payback period. What perturbations
in initial values will cause a change in the measure of merit? Which parameter has
the greatest impact? How does using the simple or discounted method change the
payback period? How high does the MARR have to be for the two methods to give
different results? These types of questions will be explored in later chapters.

with this statement? Explain your answer. (5.2)
5-B. A project your ﬁrm is considering for implementation has these estimated
costs and revenues: an investment cost of $50,000; maintenance costs that
start at $5,000 at the end of year (EOY) 1 and increase by $1,000 for each of
the next 4 years, and then remain constant for the following 5 years; savings
of $20,000 per year (EOY 1–10); and ﬁnally a resale value of $35,000 at the
EOY 10. If the project has a 10-year life and the ﬁrm’s MARR is 10% per
year, what is the present worth of the project? Is it a sound investment
opportunity? (5.3)
5-C. The higher the FICO score, the lower the interest rate on a car loan. (For
more on FICO scores, refer to www.fico.com.) For example, the total interest
paid on a $20,000 car loan over 3 years will be $2,181 for a FICO score of
660. The total interest on a $20,000 car loan with a FICO score of 760 will be
only $1,056. Thus, the higher FICO score results in a total savings of $1,125

5-F. A drug store is looking into the possibility of installing a 24/7-automated
prescription reﬁll system to increase its projected revenues by $20,000 per year
over the next 5 years. Annual expenses to maintain the system are expected
to be $5,000. The system will cost $50,000 and will have no market value at
the end of the 5-year study period. The store’s MARR is 20% per year. Use
the AW method to evaluate this investment. (5.5)
5-G. An ofﬁce supply company has purchased a light duty delivery truck for
$15,000. It is anticipated that the purchase of the truck will increase the
company’s revenue by $10,000 annually, whereas the associated operating
expenses are expected to be $3,000 per year. The truck’s market value is
expected to decrease by $2,500 each year it is in service. If the company plans
to keep the truck for only 2 years, what is the annual worth of this investment?
The MARR = 18% per year. (5.5)
5-H. Anderson County has 35 older-model school buses that will be salvaged for
$5,000 each. These buses cost $144,000 per year for fuel and maintenance.
Now the county will purchase 35 new school buses for $40,000 each. They
will travel an average of 2,000 miles per day for a total of 360,000 miles per
year. These new buses will save $10,000 per year in fuel (compared with the
older buses) for the entire group of 35 buses. If the new buses will be driven
for 15 years and the county’s MARR is 6% per year, what is the equivalent
uniform annual cost of the new buses if they have negligible market value
after 15 years? (5.5)
5-I. An assembly operation at a software company now requires $100,000 per

CHAPTER 5 / EVALUATING A SINGLE PROJECT
end of the 10-year study period. Maintenance and operation expenses of the
robot are estimated to be $64,000 per year. Invested capital must earn at least

Summary
Throughout this chapter, we have examined ﬁve basic methods for evaluating the
ﬁnancial proﬁtability of a single project: PW, AW, FW, IRR, and ERR. These methods
lead to the use of simple decision rules for economic evaluation of projects as
presented in Table 5-3. Two supplemental methods for assessing a project’s liquidity
werealsopresented: thesimplepaybackperiodandthediscountedpaybackperiod.
Computational procedures, assumptions, and acceptance criteria for all methods
were discussed and illustrated with examples. Appendix B provides a listing of
new abbreviations and notations that have been introduced in this chapter.

assumed in all problem exercises for the remainder
of the book. All MARRs are “per year.” The number

TTW has $50 million available to invest, and these
funds are currently earning 7% interest annually from
municipal bonds. If the funds available are limited to
$50 million, what is TTW’s MARR that is implied by
this particular situation? (5.2)
5-2. Buildings that are constructed to be envi-
ronmentally responsible are referred to as “green
buildings.” They cut down on energy consumption,
increase water efﬁciency, improve indoor air quality,
and use recycled materials in their construction.
According to recent studies, money spent on a green
building will pay for itself ten times over the 50-year life
of the building. Assuming end-of-year annual savings
of P/5, where P is the investment cost of the building,
draw a cash ﬂow diagram for this situation. (5.3)
5-3. Josh Ritchey has just been hired as a cost engineer
by a large airlines company. Josh’s ﬁrst idea is to stop
giving complimentary cocktails, wine, and beer to the
international ﬂying public. He calculates this will save
5,000,000 drinks per year, and each drink costs $0.50, for
a total of $2.5 million per year. Instead of complimentary
drinks, Josh estimates that the airlines company can
sell 2,000,000 drinks at $5.00 per drink. The net savings
would amount to $12.5 million per year! Josh’s boss
really likes the idea and agrees to give Josh a lump-
sum bonus now equaling 0.1% of the present equivalent
worth of three years of net savings. If the company’s
MARR is 20% per year, what is Josh’s bonus? (5.3)

5-5. To join an upscale country club, an individual
must ﬁrst purchase a membership bond for $20,000. In
addition, monthly membership dues are $250. Suppose
an individual wants to put aside a lump sum of money
now to pay for her basic country club membership
expenses (including the $20,000 bond) over the next
30 years. She can earn an APR of 6%, compounded
monthly, on her investments. What amount must this
person now commit to the membership? (5.3)
5-6. A large induced-draft fan is needed for an
upgraded industrial process. The motor to drive
this fan is rated at 100 horsepower, and the motor will
operate at full load for 8,760 hours per year. The motor’s
efﬁciency is 92%. Because the motor is fairly large, a
demand charge of $92 per kilowatt per year will be
incurred in addition to an energy charge of $0.08 per
kilowatt-hour. If the installed cost of the motor is $4,000,
what is the present worth of the motor over a 10-year
period when the MARR is 15% per year? (5.3)
5-7. A new municipal refuse-collection truck can be
purchased for $84,000. Its expected useful life is six
years, at which time its market value will be zero.
Annual receipts less expenses will be approximately
$18,000 per year over the six-year study period. Use the
PW method and a MARR of 18% to determine whether
this is a good investment. (5.3)
5-8. The winner of a state lottery will receive $5,000 per
week for the rest of her life. If the winner’s interest rate is
6.5% per year compounded weekly, what is the present
worth of this jackpot? (5.3)
5-9. A new six-speed automatic transmission
for automobiles offers an estimated 4% improve-
ment in fuel economy compared to traditional four-
speed transmissions in front-wheel drive cars. If a
four-speed transmission car averages 30 miles per
gallon and gasoline costs $4.00 per gallon, how much
extra can a motorist pay for a fuel-efﬁcient six-speed
transmission? Assume that the car will be driven for
120,000 miles over its lifetime of 10 years. The motorist
can earn 6% per year on investments. (5.3)
5-10. What is the maximum price you will pay for a
bond with a face value of $1,000 and a coupon rate of

226
CHAPTER 5 / EVALUATING A SINGLE PROJECT
14%, paid annually, if you want a yield to maturity of
10%? Assume that the bond will mature in 10 years and
the ﬁrst payment will be received in one year. (5.3)
5-11. Last month Jim purchased $10,000 of U.S.
Treasury bonds (their face value was $10,000). These
bonds have a 30-year maturity period, and they pay
1.5%interesteverythreemonths(i.e., theAPRis6%, and
Jim receives a check for $150 every three months). But
interest rates for similar securities have since risen to a
7% APR because of interest rate increases by the Federal
Reserve Board. In view of the interest-rate increase to
7%, what is the current value of Jim’s bonds? (5.3)
5-12. The price of a 10-year bond can decline by
approximately 9% if interest rates rise by 1% point. To
illustrate this, suppose you own a 10-year U.S. Treasury
bond that has a bond rate of 2% per year. How much
money will you lose if the value of the bond today is
$10,000 (face value of the bond) and the yield increases
to 3% within the next few months? (5.3)
5-13. A company sold a $1,000,000 issue of bonds with
a 15-year life, paying 4% interest per year. The bonds
were sold at par value. If the company paid a selling
fee of $50,000 and has an annual expense of $70,256 for
mailing and record keeping, what is the true rate of
interest that the company is paying for the borrowed
money? (5.3)
5-14. A U.S. government bond matures in 10 years. Its
quoted price is now 96.4, which means the buyer will
pay $96.40 per $100 of the bond’s face value. The bond
pays 5% interest on its face value each year. If $10,000
(the face value) worth of these bonds are purchased
now, what is the yield to the investor who holds the
bonds for 10 years? (5.3)
5-15. The Western Railway Company (WRC) has been
offered a 100-year contract to haul a ﬁxed amount of coal
each year from Wyoming to Illinois. Under the terms
of the agreement, WRC will receive $4,200,000 now in
exchange for its hauling services valued at $360,000
at the end of year (EOY) one, $375,000 at EOY 2 and
continuing to grow by $15,000 per year through EOY
100. If WRC’s cost of capital is 12% per year, is this a
proﬁtable agreement for WRC? (5.3)
5-16.
a. What is the CW, when i = 10% per year, of $1,500
per year, starting in year one and continuing forever;
and $10,000 in year ﬁve, repeating every four years
thereafter, and continuing forever? (5.3)
b. When i = 10% per year in this type of problem,
what value of N, practically speaking, deﬁnes

5-17. A city is spending $20 million on a new sewage
system. The expected life of the system is 40 years,
and it will have no market value at the end of its life.
Operating and maintenance expenses for the system are
projected to average $0.6 million per year. If the city’s
MARR is 8% per year, what is the capitalized worth of
the system? (5.3)
5-18. A foundation was endowed with $15,000,000 in
July 2010. In July 2014, $5,000,000 was expended for
facilities, and it was decided to provide $250,000 at the
end of each year forever to cover operating expenses.
The ﬁrst operating expense is in July 2015, and the
ﬁrst replacement expense in July 2014. If all money
earns interest at 5% after the time of endowment, what
amount would be available for the capital replacements
at the end of every ﬁfth year forever? (Hint: Draw a
cash-ﬂow diagram ﬁrst.) (5.3)
5-19. Vidhi is investing in some rental property in
Collegeville and is investigating her income from the
investment. She knows the rental revenue will increase
each year, but so will the maintenance expenses. She has
been able to generate the data that follows regarding
this investment opportunity. Assume that all cash ﬂows
occur at the end of each year and that the purchase and
sale of this property are not relevant to the study. If
Vidhi’s MARR = 6% per year, what is the FW of Vidhi’s
projected net income? (5.4)

5-25. A simple, direct space heating system is
currently being used in a professional medical
ofﬁce complex. An upgraded “variable air-volume
system” retroﬁt can be purchased and installed for
$200,000 (investment cost). Its power savings in the
future will be 500,000 kilo-Watt hours per year over its
estimated life of 8 years. The cost of electricity is $0.10
per kilo-Watt hour. If the ﬁrm’s cost of capital is 12% per
year and the residual value of the system in 8 years is
$20,000, should the new system be purchased? Use the

manufacture a proposed new product. The land costs

228
CHAPTER 5 / EVALUATING A SINGLE PROJECT
$300,000, the building costs $600,000, the equipment
costs $250,000, and $100,000 additional working capital
is required. It is expected that the product will result
in sales of $750,000 per year for 10 years, at which
time the land can be sold for $400,000, the building
for $350,000, and the equipment for $50,000. All of the
working capital would be recovered at the EOY 10. The
annual expenses for labor, materials, and all other items
are estimated to total $475,000. If the company requires
a MARR of 15% per year on projects of comparable risk,
determine if it should invest in the new product line.
Use the AW method. (5.5)
5-28. A 50-kilowatt gas turbine has an invest-
ment cost of $40,000. It costs another $14,000
for shipping, insurance, site preparation, fuel lines,
and fuel storage tanks. The operation and maintenance
expense for this turbine is $450 per year. Additionally,
the hourly fuel expense for running the turbine is $7.50
per hour, and the turbine is expected to operate 3,000
hours each year. The cost of dismantling and disposing
of the turbine at the end of its 8-year life is $8,000. (5.5)
a. If the MARR is 15% per year, what is the annual
equivalent life-cycle cost of the gas turbine?
b. What percent of annual life-cycle cost is related to
fuel?
5-29. Combined-cycle power plants use two
combustion turbines to produce electricity. Heat
from the ﬁrst turbine’s exhaust is captured to heat water
and produce steam sent to a second steam turbine
that generates additional electricity. A 968-megawatt
combined-cycle gas ﬁred plant can be purchased for
$450 million, has no salvage value, and produces a net
cash ﬂow (revenues less expenses) of $50 million per
year over its expected 30-year life. (5.5, 5.8)
a. If the hurdle rate (MARR) is 12% per year, how
proﬁtable an investment is this power plant?
b. What is the simple payback period for the plant? Is
this investment acceptable?
5-30. Your sister just bought a new car having a sticker
price (manufacturer’s suggested retail price) of $36,000.
She was crafty and was able to negotiate a sales price
of $33,500 from the auto dealership. In addition, she
received $4,500 for her old trade-in car under the U.S.
government’s “Cash for Clunkers” program. If her
new car will have a resale value of $3,500 after seven
years when your sister will shop for a replacement car,
what is the annual capital recovery cost of your sister’s
purchase? The relevant interest rate is 8% per year, and
your sister can afford to spend a maximum of $5,000
per year to ﬁnance the car (operating and other costs
are extra). (5.5)
5-31. An environmentally friendly green home
(99% air tight) costs about 8% more to construct
than a conventional home. Most green homes can save
15% per year on energy expenses to heat and cool the
dwelling. For a $250,000 conventional home, how much
would have to be saved in energy expenses per year
when the life of the home is 30 years and the interest
rate is 10% per year? Assume the additional cost of a
green home has no value at the end of 30 years. (5.5)
5-32. Your company is considering the introduction of
a new product line. The initial investment required for
this project is $500,000, and annual maintenance costs
are anticipated to be $45,000. Annual operating costs
will be directly proportional to the level of production
at $8.50 per unit, and each unit of product can be sold
for $65. If the MARR is 15% and the project has a life of
5 years, what is the minimum annual production level
for which the project is economically viable? (5.5)
5-33. Stan Moneymaker has been informed of
a major automobile manufacturer’s plan to
conserve on gasoline consumption through improved
engine design. The idea is called “engine displace-
ment,” anditworksbyswitchingfrom8-cylinderopera-
tion to 4-cylinder operation at approximately 40 miles
per hour. Engine displacement allows enough power to
accelerate from a standstill and to climb hills while also
permitting the automobile to cruise at speeds over 40
miles per hour with little loss in driving performance.
The trade literature studied by Stan makes the
claim that the engine displacement option will cost the
customer an extra $1,200 on the automobile’s sticker
price. This option is expected to save 4 miles per
gallon (an average of in-town and highway driving).
A regular 8-cylinder engine in the car that Stan is
interested in buying gets an average of 20 miles per
gallon of gasoline. If Stan drives approximately 1,200
miles per month, how many months of ownership will
berequiredtomakethis$1,200investmentpayforitself?
Stan’s opportunity cost of capital (i) is 0.5% per month,
and gasoline costs $4.00 per gallon. (5.3)
5-34. The world’s largest carpet maker has just
completed a feasibility study of what to do with
the 16,000 tons of overruns, rejects, and remnants it
produces every year. The company’s CEO launched
the feasibility study by asking, why pay someone to
dig coal out of the ground and then pay someone else

PROBLEMS 229
to put our waste into a landﬁll? Why not just burn
our own waste? The company is proposing to build
a $10-million power plant to burn its waste as fuel,
thereby saving $2.8 million a year in coal purchases.
Company engineers have determined that the waste-
burning plant will be environmentally sound, and after
its four-year study period the plant can be sold to a local
electric utility for $5 million. (5.6)
a. What is the IRR of this proposed power plant?
b. If the ﬁrm’s MARR is 15% per year, should this
project be undertaken?
5-35. Each year in the United States nearly
5 billion pounds of discarded carpet end up
in land ﬁlls. In response to this situation, the carpet
manufacturer in Problem 5-34 has decided to start
a take-back program whereby obsolete carpet is
reclaimed at the end of its useful life (about 7 years).
Theremanufacturedcarpetwillthenberecycledintothe
company’s supply chain. The out-of-pocket (variable)
cost of recycling is $1.00 per square yard of carpet, and
the remanufactured carpet can be sold for $3.00 per
square yard. If the recycling equipment costs $1 million
and has no market value at the end of its eight-year life,
how much carpet must be remanufactured annually
to make this a proﬁtable undertaking? The company’s
MARR is 15% per year. (5.5)
5-36. A large automobile manufacturer is considering
the installation of a high-tech material handling system
for $30,000,000. This system will save $7,500,000 per
year in manual labor, and it will incur $2,750,000 in
annual operating and maintenance expenditures. The
salvage value at the end of the system’s 10-year life
is negligible. If the company’s hurdle rate (MARR) is
10% per year, should the system be recommended for
implementation? (5.6)
5-37. The EZ Credit Company offers to loan a college
student $6,000 for school expenses. Repayment of the
loan will be in monthly installments of $304.07 for

one’s carbon “footprint” (how much carbon we
produce in our daily lifestyles). Minimizing the use
of fossil fuels and instead resorting to renewable
sources of energy (e.g., solar energy) are vital to a
“sustainable” lifestyle and a lower carbon footprint.
Let’s consider solar panels that prewarm the water
fed to a conventional home water heater. The solar
panels have an installed cost of $3,000, and they reduce
the homeowner’s energy bill by $30 per month. The
residual value of the solar panels is negligible at the
end of their 10-year life. What is the annual effective
IRR of this investment? (5.6)

the loan a month later with a post-dated check for
$375. Almost as soon as Frugal’s check for $375 clears
the bank, he unfortunately must again borrow $350 to

that her husband might be paying an exorbitant interest
rate to this payday lender. Assuming Jess has repeated
this borrowing and repayment scheme for 12 months in
a row, what effective annual interest rate is he really

Corporal Stan
Moneymaker has been offered a wonderful savings
plan. These are the salesperson’s words: “During your
48-month tour of duty, you will invest $200 per month
for the ﬁrst 45 months. We will make the 46th, 47th, and
48th payments of $200 each for you. When you leave
the service, we will pay you $10,000 cash.”
Is this a good deal for Corporal Moneymaker? Use
the IRR method in developing your answer. What
assumptions are being made by Corporal Moneymaker
if he enters into this contract? (5.6)
5-44. To purchase a used automobile, you borrow
$10,000 from Loan Shark Enterprises. They tell you the
interest rate is 1% per month for 35 months. They also
charge you $200 for a credit investigation, so you leave
with $9,800 in your pocket. The monthly payment they
calculated for you is
$10,000 (0.1) (35) + $10,000

an existing electrical water heater with an array
of solar panels. The net installed investment cost of the
panels is $1,400 ($2,000 less a 30% tax credit from the
government). Based on an energy audit, the existing
water heater uses 200 kilowatt hours (kWh) of electricity
per month, so at $0.12 per kWh, the cost of operating
the water heater is $24 per month. Assuming the solar
panels can save the entire cost of heating water with
electricity, answer the following questions. (5.6, 5.8)
a. What is the simple payback period for the solar
panels?
b. What is the IRR of this investment if the solar panels
have a life of 10 years?

A
company
is
producing a high-volume item that sells for $0.75 per
unit. The variable production cost is $0.30 per unit. The
company is able to produce and sell 10,000,000 items
per year when operating at full capacity.
The critical attribute for this product is weight.
The target value for weight is 1,000 grams, and the
speciﬁcation limits are set at ±50 grams. The ﬁlling
machine used to dispense the product is capable
of weights following a normal distribution with an
average (µ) of 1,000 grams and a standard deviation
(σ) of 40 grams. Because of the large standard deviation
(with respect to the speciﬁcation limits), 21.12% of all
units produced are not within the speciﬁcation limits.
(They either weigh less than 950 grams or more than
1,050 grams.) This means that 2,112,000 out of 10,000,000
units produced are nonconforming and cannot be sold
without being reworked.
Assume that nonconforming units can be reworked
to speciﬁcation at an additional ﬁxed cost of $0.10 per
unit. Reworked units can be sold for $0.75 per unit. It
has been estimated that the demand for this product
will remain at 10,000,000 units per year for the next ﬁve
years.
To improve the quality of this product, the company
is considering the purchase of a new ﬁlling machine.
The new machine will be capable of dispensing the
product with weights following a normal distribution
with µ = 1,000 grams and σ = 20 grams. As a result, the
percentofnonconformingunitswillbereducedto1.24%
of production. The new machine will cost $710,000 and
will last for at least ﬁve years. At the end of ﬁve years,
this machine can be sold for $100,000.
a. If the company’s MARR is 15% per year, is the
purchase of the new machine to improve quality
(reduce variability) economically attractive? Use the
AW method to make your recommendation.
b. Compute the IRR, simple payback period, and

payback
period
of
the
proposed
investment.
c. What other factors, in addition to reduced total
rework costs, may inﬂuence the company’s decision

The Multiple Rate of Return Problem
with the IRR Method
Whenever the IRR method is used and the cash ﬂows reverse sign (from net cash outﬂow
to net cash inﬂow or the opposite) more than once over the study period, we should be
aware of the rather remote possibility that either no interest rate or multiple interest rates
may exist. According to Descartes’ rule of signs, the maximum number of possible IRRs in
the (−1, ∞) interval for any given project is equal to the number of cash ﬂow sign reversals
during the study period. Nordstrom’s criterion says if there is only one sign change in the
cumulative cash ﬂows over time, a unique interest rate exists. Two or more sign changes
in the cumulative cash ﬂow indicates the possibility of multiple interest rates. Descartes’
rule of signs and Nordstrom’s criterion guarantee a unique internal rate of return if there
is only one sign change in the cash-ﬂow sequence and in the cumulative cash ﬂows over
time, respectively. The simplest way to check for multiple IRRs is to plot equivalent worth (e.g.,
PW) against the interest rate. If the resulting plot crosses the interest rate axis more than once,
multiple IRRs are present and another equivalence method is recommended for determining
project acceptability.
As an example, consider the following project for which the IRR is desired.
EXAMPLE 5-A-1
Plot the PW versus interest rate for the following cash ﬂows. Are there multiple IRRs?
If so, what do they mean? Notice there are two sign changes in net cash ﬂows (positive,
negative, positive), so at most two IRRs exist for this situation. Nordstrom’s criterion
also suggests a maximum of two interest rates because there are two sign changes in
cumulative cash ﬂow.

Thus, the PW of the net cash ﬂows equals zero at interest rates of about 30% and 62%, so
multiple IRRs do exist. Whenever there are multiple IRRs, which is seldom, it is likely
that none are correct.

In this situation, the ERR method (see Section 5.7) could be used to decide whether
the project is worthwhile. Or, we usually have the option of using an equivalent worth
method. In Example 5-A-1, if the external reinvestment rate (∈) is 10% per year, we see
that the ERR is 12.4%.
$1,000(P/F, 10%, 1)(F/P, i′%, 5) = $500(F/P, 10%, 5) + $250(F/A, 10%, 3)
(P/F, 10%, 1)(F/P, i′, 5) = 1.632
i′ = 0.124 (12.4%).
In addition, PW(10%) = $105, so both the ERR and PW methods indicate that this project
is acceptable when the MARR is 10% per year.

CHAPTER 6
Comparison and Selection
among Alternatives
Our aim in Chapter 6 is to compare capital investment alternatives when the
time value of money is a key inﬂuence.
Alternatives for Waste Storage
A
large electric utility company is considering two methods
for containing and storing its coal combustion by-products
(ﬂy ash). One method is wet slurry storage, and the second
method is dry storage of the ﬂy ash. The company will adopt one of these methods
for all 28 ﬂy ash impoundments at its seven coal-ﬁred power plants. Wet storage
has an initial capital investment of $2 billion, followed by annual maintenance
expenses of $300 million over the 10-year life of the method. Dry storage has a $2.5
billion capital investment and $150 million per year annual upkeep expenditures
over its 7-year life. If the utility’s MARR is 10% per year, which method of ﬂy
ash storage should be selected assuming an indeﬁnitely long study period? In
Chapter 6, investment problems of this type will be considered. We will return to
this problem in Example 6-9.

A penny saved is a penny earned.
—Benjamin Franklin (1789)
6.1 Introduction
Most engineering projects can be accomplished by more than one feasible design
alternative. When the selection of one of these alternatives excludes the choice
of any of the others, the alternatives are called mutually exclusive. Typically, the
alternativesbeingconsideredrequiretheinvestmentofdifferentamountsofcapital,
andtheirannualrevenuesandcostsmayvary. Sometimesthealternativesmayhave
different useful lives. The fundamental question is “do the added beneﬁts from a
more-expensive alternative bring a positive return relative to the added costs?”
A seven-step procedure for accomplishing engineering economy studies was
discussed in Chapter 1. In this chapter, we address Step 5 (analysis and comparison
of the feasible alternatives) and Step 6 (selection of the preferred alternative) of
this procedure, and we compare mutually exclusive alternatives on the basis of
economic considerations alone.
Five of the basic methods discussed in Chapter 5 for analyzing cash ﬂows are
used in the analyses in this chapter [present worth (PW), annual worth (AW), future
worth (FW), internal rate of return (IRR), and external rate of return (ERR)]. These
methods provide a basis for economic comparison of alternatives for an engineering
project. When correctly applied, these methods result in the correct selection of a
preferred alternative from a set of mutually exclusive alternatives. The comparison
of mutually exclusive alternatives by means of the beneﬁt–cost ratio method is
discussed in Chapter 10.
6.2 Basic Concepts for Comparing Alternatives
Principle 1 (Chapter 1) emphasized that a choice (decision) is among alternatives.
Such choices must incorporate the fundamental purpose of capital investment;
namely, to obtain at least the minimum attractive rate of return (MARR) for
each dollar invested. In practice, there are usually a limited number of feasible
alternatives to consider for an engineering project. The problem of deciding which
mutually exclusive alternative should be selected is made easier if we adopt this
rule based on Principle 2 (focus on the differences) in Chapter 1: The alternative that
requires the minimum investment of capital and produces satisfactory functional results
will be chosen unless the incremental capital associated with an alternative having a larger
investment can be justiﬁed with respect to its incremental beneﬁts.
Under this rule, we consider the acceptable alternative that requires the least
investment of capital to be the base alternative. The investment of additional capital
over that required by the base alternative usually results in increased capacity,
increased quality, increased revenues, decreased operating expenses, or increased
life. Therefore, before additional money is invested, it must be shown that each
241

242
CHAPTER 6 / COMPARISON AND SELECTION AMONG ALTERNATIVES
avoidable increment of capital can pay its own way relative to other available
investment opportunities.
In summary, if the extra beneﬁts obtained by investing additional capital are
better than those that could be obtained from investment of the same capital
elsewhere in the company at the MARR, the investment should be made.
If this is not the case, we obviously would not invest more than the minimum
amount of capital required, and we may even do nothing at all. Stated simply, our
rule will keep as much capital as possible invested at a rate of return equal to or
greater than the MARR.
6.2.1
Investment and Cost Alternatives
This basic policy for the comparison of mutually exclusive alternatives can be
demonstrated with two examples. The ﬁrst example involves an investment project
situation. Alternatives A and B are two mutually exclusive investment alternatives
with estimated net cash ﬂows,∗as shown. Investment alternatives are those with
initial (or front-end) capital investment(s) that produce positive cash ﬂows from increased
revenue, savings through reduced costs, or both. The useful life of each alternative in
this example is four years.

The cash-ﬂow diagrams for Alternatives A and B, and for the year-by-year
differences between them (i.e., B minus A), are shown in Figure 6-1. These diagrams
typify those for investment project alternatives. In this ﬁrst example, at MARR =
10% per year, the PW values are
PW(10%)A = −$60,000 + $22,000(P/A, 10%, 4) = $9,738,
PW(10%)B = −$73,000 + $26,225(P/A, 10%, 4) = $10,131.
Since the PWA is greater than zero at i = MARR, Alternative A is the base
alternative and would be selected unless the additional (incremental) capital
associated with Alternative B ($13,000) is justiﬁed. In this case, Alternative B is
preferred to A because it has a greater PW value. Hence, the extra beneﬁts obtained
∗In this book, the terms net cash ﬂow and cash ﬂow will be used interchangeably when referring to periodic cash inﬂows
and cash outﬂows for an alternative.

by investing the additional $13,000 of capital in B (diagram 3, Figure 6-1) have a PW
of $10,131 −$9,738 = $393. That is,
PW(10%)Diff = −$13,000 + $4,225(P/A, 10%, 4) = $393,
and the additional capital invested in B is justiﬁed.
The second example involves a cost project situation. Alternatives C and D are
two mutually exclusive cost alternatives with estimated net cash ﬂows, as shown,
over a three-year life. Cost alternatives are those with all negative cash ﬂows, except
for a possible positive cash-ﬂow element from disposal of assets at the end of the project’s
useful life. This situation occurs when the organization must take some action, and
the decision involves the most economical way of doing it (e.g., the addition of
environmental control capability to meet new regulatory requirements). It also
occurs when the expected revenues are the same for each alternative.

situation, Alternative C, which has the lesser capital investment, is automatically
the base alternative and would be selected unless the additional (incremental)
capital associated with Alternative D ($35,000) is justiﬁed. With the greater capital
investment, Alternative D in this illustration has smaller annual expenses.
Otherwise, it would not be a feasible alternative. (It would not be logical to invest
more capital in an alternative without obtaining additional revenues or savings.)
Note, in diagram 3, Figure 6-2, that the difference between two feasible cost
alternatives is an investment alternative.
In this second example, at MARR = 10% per year, the PW(10%)C = −$477,077
and the PW(10%)D = −$463,607. Alternative D is preferred to C because it has
the less negative PW (minimizes costs). Hence, the lower annual expenses obtained by
investing the additional $35,000 of capital in Alternative D have a PW of −$463,607 −
(−$477,077) = $13,470. That is, the PW(10%)Diff = $13,470, and the additional
capital invested in Alternative D is justiﬁed.
6.2.2
Ensuring a Comparable Basis
Each feasible, mutually exclusive alternative selected for detailed analysis meets
the functional requirements established for the engineering project (Section 1.3.2).
Differences among the alternatives, however, may occur in many forms. Ensuring

SECTION 6.3 / THE STUDY (ANALYSIS) PERIOD 245
a comparable basis for their analysis requires that any economic impacts of these
differences be included in the estimated cash ﬂows for the alternatives (as well
as comparing them over the same analysis period—see Section 6.3). Otherwise,
the wrong design alternative may be selected for implementing the project. The
following are examples of the types of differences that may occur:
1. Operational performance factors such as output capacity, speed, thrust, heat
dissipation rate, reliability, fuel efﬁciency, setup time, and so on
2. Quality factors such as the number of defect-free (nondefective) units produced
per period or the percentage of defective units (reject rate)
3. Useful life, capital investment required, revenue changes, various annual
expenses or cost savings, and so on
This list of examples could be expanded. The speciﬁc differences, however, for
each engineering project and its design alternatives must be identiﬁed. Then, the
cash-ﬂow estimates for the alternatives must include the economic impact of these
differences. This is a fundamental premise for comparing alternatives in Chapter 6 and in
the chapters that follow.
Two rules were given in Section 2.4 for facilitating the correct analysis and
comparison of mutually exclusive alternatives when the time value of money is
not a factor (present economy studies). For convenience, these rules are repeated
here and extended to account for the time value of money:
Rule 1: When revenues and other economic beneﬁts are present and vary among
the alternatives, choose the alternative that maximizes overall proﬁtability.
That is, select the alternative that has the greatest positive equivalent worth
at i = MARR and satisﬁes all project requirements.
Rule 2: When revenues and other economic beneﬁts are not present or are constant
among the alternatives, consider only the costs and select the alternative
that minimizes total cost. That is, select the alternative that has the
least negative equivalent worth at i = MARR and satisﬁes all project
requirements.
6.3
The Study (Analysis) Period
The study (analysis) period, sometimes called the planning horizon, is the selected
time period over which mutually exclusive alternatives are compared. The
determination of the study period for a decision situation may be inﬂuenced
by several factors—for example, the service period required, the useful life∗of
the shorter-lived alternative, the useful life of the longer-lived alternative, and
company policy. The key point is that the selected study period must be appropriate for
the decision situation under investigation.
∗The useful life of an asset is the period during which it is kept in productive use in a trade or business.

246
CHAPTER 6 / COMPARISON AND SELECTION AMONG ALTERNATIVES
The useful lives of alternatives being compared, relative to the selected study
period, can involve two situations:
1. Useful lives are the same for all alternatives and equal to the study period.
2. Useful lives are unequal among the alternatives, and at least one does not match
the study period.
Unequal lives among alternatives somewhat complicate their analysis and
comparison. To conduct engineering economy analyses in such cases, we adopt
the rule of comparing mutually exclusive alternatives over the same period of
time.
The repeatability assumption and the coterminated assumption are the two types
of assumptions used for these comparisons.
The repeatability assumption involves two main conditions:
1. The study period over which the alternatives are being compared is either
indeﬁnitely long or equal to a common multiple of the lives of the alternatives.
2. The economic consequences that are estimated to happen in an alternative’s
initial useful life span will also happen in all succeeding life spans
(replacements).
Actual situations in engineering practice seldom meet both conditions. This has
tended to limit the use of the repeatability assumption, except in those situations
where the difference between the AW of the ﬁrst life cycle and the AW over more
than one life cycle of the assets involved is quite small.∗
The coterminated assumption uses a ﬁnite and identical study period for all alter-
natives. This planning horizon, combined with appropriate adjustments to the
estimated cash ﬂows, puts the alternatives on a common and comparable basis.
For example, if the situation involves providing a service, the same time period
requirement applies to each alternative in the comparison. To force a match of
cash-ﬂow durations to the cotermination time, adjustments (based on additional
assumptions) are made to cash-ﬂow estimates of project alternatives having useful
lives different from the study period. For example, if an alternative has a useful
life shorter than the study period, the estimated annual cost of contracting for
the activities involved might be assumed and used during the remaining years.
Similarly, if the useful life of an alternative is longer than the study period, a
reestimated market value is normally used as a terminal cash ﬂow at the end of a
project’s coterminated life.

Industrial Engineering Conference (May 1990), The Institute of Industrial Engineers, Norcross, GA, pp. 99–104.

SECTION 6.4 / USEFUL LIVES ARE EQUAL TO THE STUDY PERIOD 247
6.4
Useful Lives Are Equal to the Study Period
When the useful life of an alternative is equal to the selected study period,
adjustments to the cash ﬂows are not required. In this section, we discuss the
comparison of mutually exclusive alternatives, using equivalent-worth methods
and rate-of-return methods when the useful lives of all alternatives are equal to the
study period.
6.4.1
Equivalent-Worth Methods
In Chapter 5, we learned that the equivalent-worth methods convert all relevant
cash ﬂows into equivalent present, annual, or future amounts. When these
methods are used, consistency of alternative selection results from this equivalency
relationship. Also, the economic ranking of mutually exclusive alternatives will
be the same when using the three methods. Consider the general case of two
alternatives A and B. If PW(i%)A < PW(i%)B, then the FW and AW analyses will
result in the same preference for Alternative B.
The most straightforward technique for comparing mutually exclusive
alternatives when all useful lives are equal to the study period is to determine
the equivalent worth of each alternative based on total investment at i = MARR.
Then, for investment alternatives, the one with the greatest positive equivalent
worth is selected. And, in the case of cost alternatives, the one with the least
negative equivalent worth is selected.
EXAMPLE 6-1
Analyzing Investment Alternatives by Using Equivalent Worth
Best Flight, Inc., is considering three mutually exclusive alternatives for imple-
menting an automated passenger check-in counter at its hub airport. Each
alternative meets the same service requirements, but differences in capital
investment amounts and beneﬁts (cost savings) exist among them. The study
period is 10 years, and the useful lives of all three alternatives are also 10 years.
Market values of all alternatives are assumed to be zero at the end of their useful
lives. If the airline’s MARR is 10% per year, which alternative should be selected
in view of the cash-ﬂow diagrams shown on page 248?
Solution by the PW Method
PW(10%)A = −$390,000 + $69,000(P/A, 10%, 10) = $33,977,
PW(10%)B = −$920,000 + $167,000(P/A, 10%, 10) = $106,148,
PW(10%)C = −$660,000 + $133,500(P/A, 10%, 10) = $160,304.
Based on the PW method, Alternative C would be selected because it has the
largest PW value ($160,304). The order of preference is C ≻B ≻A, where C ≻B
means C is preferred to B.

Alternative C is again chosen because it has the largest AW value ($26,118).

SECTION 6.4 / USEFUL LIVES ARE EQUAL TO THE STUDY PERIOD 249
Solution by the FW Method
FW(10%)A = −$390,000(F/P, 10%, 10) + $69,000(F/A, 10%, 10) = $88,138,

FW(10%)C = −$660,000(F/P, 10%, 10) + $133,500(F/A, 10%, 10) = $415,801.
Based on the FW method, the choice is again Alternative C because it has the
largest FW value ($415,801). For all three methods (PW, AW, and FW) in this
example, notice that C ≻B ≻A because of the equivalency relationship among
the methods. Also, notice that Rule 1 (Section 6.2.2) applies in this example, since
the economic beneﬁts (cost savings) vary among the alternatives.
Example 6-2 and Example 6-3 illustrate the impact that estimated differences in
the capability of alternatives to produce defect-free products have on the economic
analysis. In Example 6-2, each of the plastic-molding presses produces the same
total amount of output units, all of which are defect free. Then, in Example 6-3,
each press still produces the same total amount of output units, but the percentage
of defective units (reject rate) varies among the presses.
EXAMPLE 6-2
Analyzing Cost-Only Alternatives, Using Equivalent Worth
A company is planning to install a new automated plastic-molding press.
Four different presses are available. The initial capital investments and annual
expenses for these four mutually exclusive alternatives are as follows:

Assume that each press has the same output capacity (120,000 units per year)
and has no market value at the end of its useful life; the selected analysis period
is ﬁve years; and any additional capital invested is expected to earn at least 10%
per year. Which press should be chosen if 120,000 nondefective units per year
are produced by each press and all units can be sold? The selling price is $0.375
per unit. Solve by hand and by spreadsheet.

Solution by Hand
Since the same number of nondefective units per year will be produced and
sold using each press, revenue can be disregarded (Principle 2, Chapter 1). The

The preferred alternative will minimize the equivalent worth of total costs over
the ﬁve-year analysis period (Rule 2, page 245). That is, the four alternatives
can be compared as cost alternatives. The PW, AW, and FW calculations for
Alternative P1 are
PW(10%)P1 = −$24,000 −$31,200(P/A, 10%, 5) = −$142,273,
AW(10%)P1 = −$24,000(A/P, 10%, 5) −$31,200 = −$37,531,
FW(10%)P1 = −$24,000(F/P, 10%, 5) −$31,200(F/A, 10%, 5)
= −$229,131.
The PW, AW, and FW values for Alternatives P2, P3, and P4 are determined with
similar calculations and shown for all four presses in Table 6-1. Alternative P4
minimizes all three equivalent-worth values of total costs and is the preferred
alternative. The preference ranking (P4 ≻P2 ≻P1 ≻P3) resulting from the
analysis is the same for all three methods.

Figure 6-3 presents a spreadsheet solution for identifying the press that
minimizes total equivalent costs. The top section of the spreadsheet displays
the problem data. These data are then tabulated as total end-of-year (EOY)
cash ﬂows in the middle section of the spreadsheet. Finally, the PW, AW, and
FW amounts are computed and the results displayed at the bottom of the
spreadsheet. Note that the AW and FW cell formulas make use of the PW result
in row 22. The results are the same (except for rounding) as those computed by
hand and displayed in Table 6-1.
NOTE: This spreadsheet model allows us to easily do what the solution by
hand does not—evaluate how our recommendation will change if data values
change. For example, if MARR changes from 10% to 15%, then Press 2 becomes
the lowest cost alternative.

EXAMPLE 6-3
Analyzing Alternatives with Different Reject Rates
Consider the four plastic molding presses of Example 6-2. Suppose that each
press is still capable of producing 120,000 total units per year, but the estimated
reject rate is different for each alternative. This means that the expected revenue
will differ among the alternatives since only nondefective units can be sold. The
data for the four presses are summarized below. The life of each press (and the
study period) is ﬁve years.

If all nondefective units can be sold for $0.375 per unit, which press should be
chosen? Solve by hand and by spreadsheet.
Solution by Hand
In this example, each of the four alternative presses produces 120,000 units per
year, but they have different estimated reject rates. Therefore, the number of
nondefective output units produced and sold per year, as well as the annual
revenues received by the company, varies among the alternatives. But the annual
expenses are assumed to be unaffected by the reject rates. In this situation, the
preferred alternative will maximize overall proﬁtability (Rule 1, Section 6.2.2).
That is, the four presses need to be compared as investment alternatives. The
PW, AW, and FW calculations for Alternative P4 are given below:
PW(10%)P4 = −$52,000 + [(1−0.056)(120,000)($0.375)−$22,880](P/A, 10%, 5)
= $22,300,
AW(10%)P4 = −$52,000(A/P, 10%, 5) + [(1 −0.056)(120,000)($0.375) −$22,880]
= $5,882,
FW(10%)P4 = −$52,000(F/P, 10%, 5)
+ [(1 −0.056)(120,000)($0.375) −$22,800](F/A, 10%, 5)
= $35,914.
The PW, AW, and FW values for Alternatives P1, P2, and P3 are determined
with similar calculations and shown for all four alternatives in Table 6-2.
Alternative P2 maximizes all three equivalent-worth measures of overall
proﬁtability and is preferred [versus P4 in Example 6-2]. The preference ranking
(P2 ≻P4 ≻P3 ≻P1) is the same for the three methods but is different from
the ranking in Example 6-2. The different preferred alternative and preference
ranking are the result of the varying capability among the presses to produce
nondefective output units.

CHAPTER 6 / COMPARISON AND SELECTION AMONG ALTERNATIVES
6.4.2
Rate-of-Return Methods
Annual return on investment is a popular metric of proﬁtability in the United States.
When using rate-of-return methods to evaluate mutually exclusive alternatives, the
best alternative produces satisfactory functional results and requires the minimum
investment of capital. This is true unless a larger investment can be justiﬁed in
terms of its incremental beneﬁts and costs. Accordingly, these three guidelines are
applicable to rate-of-return methods:
1. Each increment of capital must justify itself by producing a sufﬁcient rate of
return (greater than or equal to MARR) on that increment.
2. Compare a higher investment alternative against a lower investment alternative
only when the latter is acceptable. The difference between the two alternatives
is usually an investment alternative and permits the better one to be determined.
3. Select the alternative that requires the largest investment of capital, as long as
the incremental investment is justiﬁed by beneﬁts that earn at least the MARR.
This maximizes equivalent worth on total investment at i = MARR.
Do not compare the IRRs of mutually exclusive alternatives (or IRRs of
the differences between mutually exclusive alternatives) against those of
other alternatives. Compare an IRR only against MARR (IRR ≥MARR) in
determining the acceptability of an alternative.
These guidelines can be implemented using the incremental investment analysis
technique with rate-of-return methods.∗First, however, we will discuss the
inconsistent ranking problem that can occur with incorrect use of rate-of-return
methods in the comparison of alternatives.
6.4.2.1
The Inconsistent Ranking Problem In Section 6.2, we discussed a
small investment project involving two alternatives, A and B. The cash ﬂow for
each alternative is restated here, as well as the cash ﬂow (incremental) difference.

The useful life of each alternative (and the study period) is four years. Also, assume
that MARR = 10% per year. First, check to see if the sum of positive cash ﬂows
∗The IRR method is the most celebrated time value-of-money–based proﬁtability metric in the United States. The
incremental analysis technique must be learned so that the IRR method can be correctly applied in the comparison of
mutually exclusive alternatives.

SECTION 6.4 / USEFUL LIVES ARE EQUAL TO THE STUDY PERIOD 255
exceeds the sum of negative cash ﬂows. This is the case here, so the IRR and
PW(10%) of each alternative are calculated and shown as follows:
Alternative
IRR
PW(10%)
A
17.3%
$9,738
B
16.3
10,131
If, at this point, a choice were made based on maximizing the IRR of the total
cash ﬂow, Alternative A would be selected. But, based on maximizing the PW
of the total investment at i = MARR, Alternative B is preferred. Obviously,
here we have an inconsistent ranking of the two mutually exclusive investment
alternatives.
Now that we know Alternative A is acceptable (IRR > MARR;
PW at
MARR > 0),
we will analyze the incremental cash ﬂow between the two
alternatives, which we shall refer to as !(B −A). The IRR of this increment, IRR!,
is 11.4%. This is greater than the MARR of 10%, and the incremental investment of
$13,000 is justiﬁed. This outcome is conﬁrmed by the PW of the increment, PW!
(10%), which is equal to $393. Thus, when the IRR of the incremental cash ﬂow is
used, the rankings of A and B are consistent with that based on the PW on total
investment.
The fundamental role that the incremental net cash ﬂow, !(B −A), plays in the
comparison of two alternatives (where B has the greater capital investment) is
based on the following relationship:
Cash ﬂow of B = Cash ﬂow of A + Cash ﬂow of the difference.
Clearly, the cash ﬂow of B is made up of two parts. The ﬁrst part is equal to the
cash ﬂow ofAlternative A, and the second part is the incremental cash ﬂow between
A and B, !(B −A). Obviously, if the equivalent worth of the difference is greater
than or equal to zero at i = MARR, then Alternative B is preferred. Otherwise,
given that Alternative A is justiﬁed (an acceptable base alternative), Alternative A is
preferred. It is always true that if PW! ≥0, then IRR! ≥MARR.
Figure 6-5 illustrates how ranking errors can occur when a selection among
mutually exclusive alternatives is based wrongly on maximization of IRR on the
total cash ﬂow. When MARR lies to the left of IRR! (11.4% in this case), an incorrect
choice will be made by selecting an alternative that maximizes IRR. This is because
the IRR method assumes reinvestment of cash ﬂows at the calculated rate of return
(17.3% and 16.3%, respectively, for Alternatives A and B in this case), whereas the
PW method assumes reinvestment at MARR (10%).
Figure 6-5 shows our previous results with PWB > PWA at MARR = 10%,
even though IRRA > IRRB. Also, the ﬁgure shows how to avoid this ranking
inconsistency by examining the IRR of the increment, IRR!, which correctly leads
to the selection of Alternative B, the same as with the PW method.

6.4.2.2
The Incremental Investment Analysis Procedure
We recommend the incremental investment analysis procedure to avoid
incorrect ranking of mutually exclusive alternatives when using rate-of-return
methods. We will use this procedure in the remainder of the book.
The incremental analysis procedure for the comparison of mutually exclusive
alternatives is summarized in three basic steps (illustrated in Figure 6-6):
1. Arrange (rank-order) the feasible alternatives based on increasing capital
investment.∗
2. Establish a base alternative.
(a) Cost alternatives—the ﬁrst alternative (least capital investment) is the base.
(b) Investment alternatives—if the ﬁrst alternative is acceptable (IRR ≥MARR;
PW, FW, or AW at MARR ≥0), select it as the base. If the ﬁrst alternative
is not acceptable, choose the next alternative in order of increasing
∗This ranking rule assumes a logical set of mutually exclusive alternatives. That is to say, for investment or cost
alternatives, increased initial investment results in additional economic beneﬁts, whether from added revenues,
reduced costs, or a combination of both. Also, this rule assumes that for any nonconventional investment cash ﬂow,
the PW, AW, FW, or ERR analysis method would be used instead of IRR. Simply stated, a nonconventional investment
cash ﬂow involves multiple sign changes or positive cash ﬂow at time zero, or both. For a more detailed discussion
of ranking rules, see C. S. Park and G. P. Sharp-Bette, Advanced Engineering Economy (New York: John Wiley & Sons,
1990).

Continue until an acceptable alternative is obtained. If none is obtained,
the do-nothing alternative is selected.
3. Use iteration to evaluate differences (incremental cash ﬂows) between alter-
natives until all alternatives have been considered.
(a) If the incremental cash ﬂow between the next (higher capital investment)
alternative and the current selected alternative is acceptable, choose the
next alternative as the current best alternative. Otherwise, retain the last
acceptable alternative as the current best.

CHAPTER 6 / COMPARISON AND SELECTION AMONG ALTERNATIVES
(b) Repeat and select as the preferred alternative the last one for which the
incremental cash ﬂow was acceptable.
EXAMPLE 6-4
Incremental Analysis: Investment Alternatives
Suppose that we are analyzing the following six mutually exclusive alternatives
for a small investment project, using the IRR method. The useful life of each
alternative is 10 years, and the MARR is 10% per year. Also, net annual revenues
less expenses vary among all alternatives, and Rule 1, Section 6.2.2, applies. If
the study period is 10 years, and the market (salvage) values are zero, which
alternative should be chosen? Notice that the alternatives have been rank-ordered
from low capital investment to high capital investment.

Solution
For each of the feasible alternatives, the IRR on the total cash ﬂow can be
computed by determining the interest rate at which the PW, FW, or AW equals
zero (use of AW is illustrated for Alternative A):∗
0 = −$900(A/P, i′
A%, 10) + $150;
i′% = ?
By trial and error, we determine that i′
A% = 10.6%. In the same manner, the IRRs
of all the alternatives are computed and summarized:
A
B
C
D
E
F
IRR on total cash ﬂow
10.6%
13.0%
9.6%
19.1%
18.3%
15.6%
At this point, only Alternative C is unacceptable and can be eliminated from the
comparison because its IRR is less than MARR of 10% per year. Also, A is
the base alternative from which to begin the incremental investment analysis
procedure, because it is the mutually exclusive alternative with the lowest
capital investment whose IRR (10.6%) is equal to or greater than MARR (10%).
∗The three steps of the incremental analysis procedure previously discussed (and illustrated in Figure 6-6) do
not require the calculation of the IRR value for each alternative. In this example, the IRR of each alternative is
used for illustrating common errors made with the IRR method.

This pre-analysis of the feasibility of each alternative is not required by the
incrementalanalysisprocedure. Itisuseful, however, whenanalyzingalargerset
of mutually exclusive alternatives. You can immediately eliminate nonfeasible
(nonproﬁtable) alternatives, as well as easily identify the base alternative.
As discussed in Section 6.4.2.1, it is not necessarily correct to select the alter-
native that maximizes the IRR on total cash ﬂow. That is to say,Alternative D may
not be the best choice, since maximization of IRR does not guarantee maximization
of equivalent worth on total investment at the MARR. Therefore, to make the correct
choice, we must examine each increment of capital investment to see if it will pay
its own way. Table 6-3 provides the analysis of the ﬁve remaining alternatives,
and the IRRs on incremental cash ﬂows are again computed by setting
AW! (i′) = 0 for cash-ﬂow differences between alternatives.
From Table 6-3, it is apparent that Alternative E will be chosen (not D)
because it requires the largest investment for which the last increment of capital
investment is justiﬁed. That is, we desire to invest additional increments of the
$7,000 presumably available for this project as long as each avoidable increment
of investment can earn 10% per year or better.
It was assumed in Example 6-4 (and in all other examples involving mutually
exclusive alternatives, unless noted to the contrary) that available capital for a
project not committed to one of the feasible alternatives is invested in some other
project where it will earn an annual return equal to the MARR. Therefore, in this
case, the $2,000 left over by selecting Alternative E instead of F is assumed to earn
10% per year elsewhere, which is more than we could obtain by investing it in F.
In sum, three errors commonly made in this type of analysis are to choose
the mutually exclusive alternative (1) with the highest overall IRR on total cash
ﬂow, (2) with the highest IRR on an incremental capital investment, or (3) with
the largest capital investment that has an IRR greater than or equal to the MARR.
None of these criteria are generally correct. For instance, in Example 6-4, we might
erroneously choose Alternative D rather than E because the IRR for the increment
from B to D is 22.6% and that from D to E is only 15.1% (error 2). A more obvious
error, as previously discussed, is the temptation to maximize the IRR on total cash
ﬂow and select Alternative D (error 1). The third error would be committed by
selecting Alternative F for the reason that it has the largest total investment with
an IRR greater than the MARR (15.6% > 10%).

air compressor are shown, as well as the estimated market value for each design
at the end of the common ﬁve-year useful life. The perspective (Principle 3,

company, plant facilities department, government highway department, and
so on). The study period is ﬁve years, and the MARR is 20% per year. One of

same level of service. On the basis of this information,

Observe that this example is a cost-type situation with four mutually exclusive cost
alternatives. The following solution demonstrates the use of the incremental
analysis procedure to compare cost alternatives and applies Rule 2 in
Section 6.2.2.
Solution by Hand
The ﬁrst step is to arrange (rank-order) the four mutually exclusive cost
alternatives on the basis of their increasing capital investment costs. Therefore,
the order of the alternatives for incremental analysis is D1, D4, D2, and D3.
Since these are cost alternatives, the one with the least capital investment,
D1, is the base alternative. Therefore, the base alternative will be preferred unless
additional increments of capital investment can produce cost savings (beneﬁts)
that lead to a return equal to or greater than the MARR.
The ﬁrst incremental cash ﬂow to be analyzed is that between designs D1
and D4, !(D4 −D1). The results of this analysis, and of subsequent differences
between the cost alternatives, are summarized in Table 6-4, and the incremental
investment analysis for the IRR method is illustrated in Figure 6-7. These results
show the following:

CHAPTER 6 / COMPARISON AND SELECTION AMONG ALTERNATIVES
Spreadsheet Solution
Figure 6-8 shows the complete spreadsheet solution for this example. The ﬁrst
set of incremental EOYcash ﬂows has two EOYﬁve entries: one for the difference
in annual expense savings and one for the difference in market value. These two
values are combined in the second set of incremental EOY cash ﬂows for direct
computation of the incremental IRR and PW amounts. Note that the IRR function
can handle EOY zero through EOY ﬁve cash ﬂows as given, while the PW
computation needs to add the EOY zero cash ﬂow outside of the NPV function.
As was previously discovered via manual computation, the ﬁrst increment
!(D4 −D1) is justiﬁed; the increment !(D2 −D4) is not justiﬁed; and the
last increment !(D3 −D4) is justiﬁed. Thus, D3 is selected as the preferred
compressor.
As previously mentioned, spreadsheets make it easy to answer what if types
of questions. For example, how much would the annual expense have to be for
compressor D4 for it to become preferable to D3? (Hint: The incremental PW
has to be positive.) It is easy to change the value in cell E6 by hand to bracket a
small positive PW value. This corresponds to an annual expense of $22,002 for
D4. It can also be solved quickly by using the Solver tool.

SECTION 6.4 / USEFUL LIVES ARE EQUAL TO THE STUDY PERIOD 263
Now we turn our attention to the ERR method which was explained in
Chapter5.Also, inAppendix5-A,theERRmethodwasillustratedasasubstitutefor
the IRR method when analyzing a nonconventional investment type of cash ﬂow. In
Example 6-6, the ERR method is applied using the incremental investment analysis
procedure to compare the mutually exclusive alternatives for an engineering
improvement project.
EXAMPLE 6-6
Incremental Analysis Using ERR
In an automotive parts plant, an engineering team is analyzing an improvement
project to increase the productivity of a ﬂexible manufacturing center. The
estimated net cash ﬂows for the three feasible alternatives being compared are
shown in Table 6-5. The analysis period is six years, and MARR for capital
investments at the plant is 20% per year. Using the ERR method, which
alternative should be selected? (∈= MARR.)
Solution
The procedure for using the ERR method to compare mutually exclusive
alternatives is the same as for the IRR method. The only difference is in the
calculation methodology.
Table 6-5 provides a tabulation of the calculation and acceptability of
each increment of capital investment considered. Since these three feasible
alternatives are a mutually exclusive set of investment alternatives, the base
alternative is the one with the least capital investment cost that is economically
justiﬁed. ForAlternative A, the PW of the negative cash-ﬂow amounts (at i = ∈%)

is just the $640,000 investment cost. Therefore, the ERR for Alternative A is the
following:
$640,000(F/P, i′%, 6) = $262,000(F/P, 20%, 5) + · · · + $260,000
= $2,853,535
(F/P, i′%, 6) = (1 + i′)6 = $2,853,535/$640,000 = 4.4586
(1 + i′) = (4.4586)1/6 = 1.2829
i′ = 0.2829, or ERR = 28.3%.
Using a MARR = 20% per year, this capital investment is justiﬁed, and
Alternative A is an acceptable base alternative. By using similar calculations, the
increment !(B −A), earning 14.3%, is not justiﬁed and the increment !(C −A),
earning 27.1%, is justiﬁed. Therefore, Alternative C is the preferred alternative
for the improvement project. Note in this example that revenues varied among
the alternatives and that Rule 1, Section 6.2.2, was applied.
By this point in the chapter, three key observations are clear concerning the
comparison of mutually exclusive alternatives: (1) equivalent-worth methods
are computationally less cumbersome to use, (2) both the equivalent-worth and
rate-of-return methods, if used properly, will consistently recommend the best
alternative, but (3) rate-of-return methods may not produce correct choices if the
analyst or the manager insists on maximizing the rate of return on the total cash
ﬂow. That is, incremental investment analysis must be used with rate-of-return
methods to ensure that the best alternative is selected.
6.5
Useful Lives Are Unequal among the Alternatives
When the useful lives of mutually exclusive alternatives are unequal,
the
repeatability assumption may be used in their comparison if the study period can
be inﬁnite in length or a common multiple of the useful lives. This assumes that the
economic estimates for an alternative’s initial useful life cycle will be repeated in
all subsequent replacement cycles. As we discussed in Section 6.3, this condition is
more robust for practical application than it may appear. Another viewpoint is to
consider the repeatability assumption as a modeling convenience for the purpose
of making a current decision. When this assumption is applicable to a decision situation,
it simpliﬁes comparison of the mutually exclusive alternatives.
If the repeatability assumption is not applicable to a decision situation, then an
appropriate study period needs to be selected (coterminated assumption). This is the
approach most frequently used in engineering practice because product life cycles
are becoming shorter. Often, one or more of the useful lives will be shorter or longer
than the selected study period. When this is the case, cash-ﬂow adjustments based

SECTION 6.5 / USEFUL LIVES ARE UNEQUAL AMONG THE ALTERNATIVES 265
on additional assumptions need to be used so that all the alternatives are compared
over the same study period. The following guidelines apply to this situation:
1. Useful life < Study period
(a) Cost alternatives: Because each cost alternative has to provide the same
level of service over the study period, contracting for the service or leasing
the needed equipment for the remaining years may be appropriate. Another
potential course of action is to repeat part of the useful life of the original
alternative and then use an estimated market value to truncate it at the end
of the study period.
(b) Investment alternatives: The ﬁrst assumption is that all cash ﬂows will be
reinvested in other opportunities available to the ﬁrm at the MARR to the
end of the study period. A second assumption involves replacing the initial
investment with another asset having possibly different cash ﬂows over
the remaining life. A convenient solution method is to calculate the FW of
each mutually exclusive alternative at the end of the study period. The PW
can also be used for investment alternatives, since the FW at the end of the
study period, say N, of each alternative is its PW times a common constant
(F/P, i%, N), where i% = MARR.
2. Useful life > Study period: The most common technique is to truncate the
alternative at the end of the study period, using an estimated market value.
This assumes that the disposable assets will be sold at the end of the study
period at that value.
The underlying principle, as discussed in Section 6.3, is to compare the mutually
exclusive alternatives being considered in a decision situation over the same
study (analysis) period.
In this section, we explain how to evaluate mutually exclusive alternatives
having unequal useful lives. First we consider equivalent-worth methods for
making comparisons of alternatives. Then we turn our attention to the use of the
rate-of-return method for performing the analysis.
6.5.1
Equivalent-Worth Methods
When the useful lives of alternatives are not the same, the repeatability assumption is
appropriateifthestudyperiodisinﬁnite(verylonginlength)oracommonmultiple
of the useful lives. Under this assumption, the cash ﬂows for an alternative’s initial
life cycle will be repeated (i.e., they are identical) in all subsequent replacement
cycles. Because this assumption is applicable in many decision situations, it is
extremely useful and greatly simpliﬁes the comparison of mutually exclusive
alternatives. With repeatability, we will simply compute the AW of each alternative
over its own useful life and recommend the one having the most economical value
(i.e., the alternative with the highest positive AW for investment alternatives and
the alternative with the least negative AW for cost alternatives).

266
CHAPTER 6 / COMPARISON AND SELECTION AMONG ALTERNATIVES
Example 6-7 demonstrates the computational advantage of using the AW
method (instead of PW or FW) when the repeatability assumption is applicable.
Example 6-8 illustrates the use of the coterminated assumption for the same set
of alternatives when the selected study period is not a common multiple of the
useful lives.
EXAMPLE 6-7
Useful Lives ̸= Study Period: The Repeatability Assumption
The following data have been estimated for two mutually exclusive investment
alternatives, A and B, associated with a small engineering project for which
revenues as well as expenses are involved. They have useful lives of four and
six years, respectively. If MARR = 10% per year, show which alternative is
more desirable by using equivalent-worth methods (computed by hand and by
spreadsheet). Use the repeatability assumption.

Solution
The least common multiple of the useful lives of Alternatives A and B is 12
years. Using the repeatability assumption and a 12-year study period, the ﬁrst
like (identical) replacement of Alternative A would occur at EOY four, and the
second would be at EOY eight. For Alternative B, one like replacement would
occur at EOY six. This is illustrated in Part 1 of Figure 6-9.
Solution by the PW Method
The PW (or FW) solution must be based on the total study period (12 years). The
PW of the initial useful life cycle will be different than the PW of subsequent
replacement cycles:
PW(10%)A = −$3,500 −$3,500[(P/F, 10%, 4) + (P/F, 10%, 8)]
+ ($1,255)(P/A, 10%, 12)
= $1,028,
PW(10%)B = −$5,000 −$5,000(P/F, 10%, 6)
+ ($1,480)(P/A, 10%, 12)
= $2,262.
Based on the PW method, we would select Alternative B.

Solution by the AW Method
The like replacement of assets assumes that the economic estimates for the
initial useful life cycle will be repeated in each subsequent replacement cycle.
Consequently, the AW will have the same value for each cycle and for the study
period (12 years). This is demonstrated in the nextAW solution by calculating (1)
theAW of each alternative over the 12-year analysis period based on the previous
PW values and (2) determining the AW of each alternative over one useful life
cycle. Based on the previously calculated PW values, the AW values are
AW(10%)A = $1,028(A/P, 10%, 12) = $151,
AW(10%)B = $2,262(A/P, 10%, 12) = $332.
Next, the AW of each alternative is calculated over one useful life cycle:
AW(10%)A = −$3,500(A/P, 10%, 4) + ($1,255) = $151,
AW(10%)B = −$5,000(A/P, 10%, 6) + ($1,480) = $332.
This conﬁrms that both calculations for each alternative result in the same
AW value, and we would again select Alternative B because it has the larger
value ($332).
Spreadsheet Solution
Figure 6-10 shows the spreadsheet solution for this example. EOY cash ﬂows
are computed for each alternative over the entire 12-year study period. For
Alternative A, the annual cash ﬂow of $1,255 is combined with the necessary

268
CHAPTER 6 / COMPARISON AND SELECTION AMONG ALTERNATIVES
reinvestment cost ($3,500) at the end of each useful life cycle (at EOY 4 and
EOY 8). A similar statement can be made for Alternative B at the end of its ﬁrst
life cycle (EOY 6 = $1,480 −$5,000). As was the case in the previous solution by
hand, Alternative B is selected because it has the largest PW (and therefore AW)
value. (How much would the annual cash ﬂow for Alternative A have to be for
it to be as desirable as Alternative B? Answer: $1,436.)

EXAMPLE 6-8
Useful Lives ̸= Study Period: The Coterminated Assumption
Suppose that Example 6-7 is modiﬁed such that an analysis period of six
years is used (coterminated assumption) instead of 12 years, which was based
on repeatability and the least common multiple of the useful lives. Perhaps
the responsible manager did not agree with the repeatability assumption and
wanted a six-year analysis period because it is the planning horizon used in the
company for small investment projects.

SECTION 6.5 / USEFUL LIVES ARE UNEQUAL AMONG THE ALTERNATIVES 269
Solution
An assumption used for an investment alternative (when useful life is less than
the study period) is that all cash ﬂows will be reinvested by the ﬁrm at the
MARR until the end of the study period. This assumption applies to Alternative
A, which has a four-year useful life (two years less than the study period), and
it is illustrated in Part 2 of Figure 6-9. We use the FW method to analyze this
situation:
FW(10%)A = [−$3,500(F/P, 10%, 4) + ($1,255)(F/A, 10%, 4)](F/P, 10%, 2)
= $847,
FW(10%)B = −$5,000(F/P, 10%, 6) + ($1,480)(F/A, 10%, 6)
= $2,561.
Based on the FW of each alternative at the end of the six-year study period, we
would select Alternative B because it has the larger value ($2,561).
In the solution to Example 6-7, it was shown that, when repeatability is
assumed, the AW of an alternative over a single life cycle is equal to the AW of the
alternative over the entire study period. As a result, we can adopt the following rule
to simplify the analysis of alternatives with unequal lives when the repeatability
assumption is applicable:
When the repeatability assumption is applied, simply compare theAW amounts
of each alternative over its own useful life and select the alternative that
maximizes AW.
The capitalized-worth (CW) method was introduced in Chapter 5 as a special
variation of the PW method when revenues and expenses occur over an inﬁnite
length of time. CW is a convenient basis for comparing mutually exclusive
alternatives when the period of needed service is indeﬁnitely long and the
repeatability assumption is applicable.
EXAMPLE 6-9
Comparing Alternatives Using CW
We now revisit the problem posed at the beginning of the chapter involving
two containment alternatives for coal combustion by-products. Because an
indeﬁnitely long study period is speciﬁed, we use the CW method to compare
the two storage methods. First we compute theAW of each system over its useful

270
CHAPTER 6 / COMPARISON AND SELECTION AMONG ALTERNATIVES
life, and then we determine the capitalized worth (refer to Section 5.3.3) over a
very long study period.
Wet:
AW(10%) = −$2,000,000,000 (A/P, 10%, 10) −$300,000,000
= −$625,400,000
CW(10%) = AW(10%)/0.10 = −$6,254,000,000
Dry:
AW(10%) = −$2,500,000,000 (A/P, 10%, 7) −$150,000,000
= −$663,500,000
CW(10%) = AW(10%)/0.10 = −$6,635,000,000
We recommend the wet slurry storage method because it has the lesser negative
(greater) CW.
Example 6-10 demonstrates how to deal with situations in which multiple
machines are required to satisfy a ﬁxed annual demand for a product or service.
Such problems can be solved by using Rule 2 and the repeatability assumption.
EXAMPLE 6-10
AW and Repeatability: Perfect Together!
Three products will be manufactured in a new facility at theApex Manufacturing
Company. They each require an identical manufacturing operation, but different
production times, on a broaching machine. Two alternative types of broaching
machines (M1 and M2) are being considered for purchase. One machine type
must be selected.
For the same level of annual demand for the three products, annual
production requirements (machine hours) and annual operating expenses (per
machine) are listed next. Which machine should be selected if the MARR
is 20% per year? Solve by hand and by spreadsheet. Show all work to

Assumptions: The facility will operate 2,000 hours per year. Machine availability
is 90% for Machine M1 and 80% for Machine M2. The yield of Machine M1 is
95%, and the yield of Machine M2 is 90%. Annual operating expenses are based
on an assumed operation of 2,000 hours per year, and workers are paid during
any idle time of Machine M1 or Machine M2. Market values of both machines
are negligible.
Solution by Hand
The company will need 5,850 hours/[2,000 hours (0.90)(0.95)] = 3.42 (four
machines of type M1) or 4,200 hours/[2,000 hours (0.80)(0.90)] = 2.92 (three
machines of type M2). The maximum operation time of 2,000 hours per year
Figure 6-11
Spreadsheet Solution, Example 6-10

272
CHAPTER 6 / COMPARISON AND SELECTION AMONG ALTERNATIVES
in the denominator must be multiplied by the availability of each machine and
the yield of each machine, as indicated.
The annual cost of ownership, assuming a MARR = 20% per year, is
$15,000(4)(A/P, 20%, 5) = $20,064 for Machine M1 and $22,000(3)(A/P, 20%,
8) = $17,200 for Machine M2.
There is an excess capacity when four Machine M1s and three Machine M2s
are used to provide the machine-hours (5,850 and 4,200, respectively) just given.
If we assume that the operator is paid for idle time he or she may experience
on M1 or M2, the annual expense for the operation of four M1s is 4 machines ×
$4,000 per machine = $16,000. For three M2s, the annual expense is 3 machines ×
$6,000 per machine = $18,000.
The total equivalent annual cost for four Machine M1s is $20,064 + $16,000 =
$36,064. Similarly, the total equivalent annual expense for three Machine
M2s is $17,200 + $18,000 = $35,200. By a slim margin, Machine M2 is the
preferred choice to minimize equivalent annual costs with the repeatability
assumption.
Spreadsheet Solution
Figure 6-11 on page 271 shows the complete spreadsheet solution for this
example. Note the use of the CEILING function in cell B15 to convert the
noninteger theoretical number of machines required into an actual requirement.
This actual requirement is used to compute the total EOY cash ﬂows for each
alternative by multiplying the per-machine costs by the number of machines
required.
Since we are assuming repeatability, the EOY cash ﬂows are shown only
for the initial useful life span for each alternative. These cash ﬂows are then
used to compute the AW of each alternative. As seen previously, purchasing
three broaching machines of type M2 is preferred to purchasing four machines
of type M1.
EXAMPLE 6-11
Modeling Estimated Expenses as Arithmetic Gradients
You are a member of an engineering project team that is designing a new
processing facility. Your present design task involves the portion of the catalytic
system that requires pumping a hydrocarbon slurry that is corrosive and
contains abrasive particles. For ﬁnal analysis and comparison, you have
selected two fully lined slurry pump units, of equal output capacity, from
different manufacturers. Each unit has a large-diameter impeller required and
an integrated electric motor with solid-state controls. Both units will provide the
same level of service (support) to the catalytic system but have different useful
lives and costs.

The new processing facility is needed by your ﬁrm at least as far into the

per year. Based on this information, which slurry pump should you select?
Solution
Notice that the estimates for maintenance expenses involve an arithmetic
gradient series (Chapter 4). A cash-ﬂow diagram is very useful in this situation
to help keep track of the various cash-ﬂow series. The cash-ﬂow diagrams for
pump models SP240 and HEPS9 are shown in Figure 6-12.
The repeatability assumption is a logical choice for this analysis, and a study
period of either inﬁnite or 45 years (least common multiple of the useful lives) in
length can be used. With repeatability, the AW over the initial useful life of each
alternative is the same as its AW over the length of either study period:
AW(20%)SP240 = −$33,200(A/P, 20%, 5) −$2,165
−[$1,100 + $500(A/G, 20%, 5)]
= −$15,187,
AW(20%)HEPS9 = −$47,600(A/P, 20%, 9) + $5,000(A/F, 20%, 9)
−$1,720 −[$500(P/A, 20%, 6)
+ $100(P/G, 20%, 6)] × (P/F, 20%, 3) × (A/P, 20%, 9)
= −$13,622.
Based on Rule 2 (Section 6.2.2), you should select pump model HEPS9, since the
AW over its useful life (nine years) has the smaller negative value (−$13,622).
As additional information, the following two points support in choosing the
repeatability assumption in Example 6-11:
1. The repeatability assumption is commensurate with the long planning
horizon for the new processing facility and with the design and operating
requirements of the catalytic system.

2. If the initial estimated costs change for future pump-replacement cycles,
a logical assumption is that the ratio of the AW values for the two
alternatives will remain approximately the same. Competition between the
two manufacturers should cause this to happen. Hence, the pump selected
(model HEPS9) should continue to be the preferred alternative.
If the existing model is redesigned or new models of slurry pumps become
available, however, another study to analyze and compare all feasible alter-
natives is required before a replacement of the selected pump occurs.

SECTION 6.5 / USEFUL LIVES ARE UNEQUAL AMONG THE ALTERNATIVES 275
6.5.2
Rate-of-Return Analysis
Up until this point, we have solved problems with unequal lives (see Section 6.5)
with the use of the equivalent-worth methods (AW being the most convenient). The
analysis of alternatives having unequal lives can also be accomplished by using
rate-of-return methods. When the cotermination method is used, the incremental
analysis procedure described in Section 6.4 can be applied directly. When the study
period is either indeﬁnitely long or equal to a common multiple of the useful lives,
however, computing the incremental cash ﬂows can be quite cumbersome. For
example, the implicit study period in Example 6-11 is 45 years! In this instance, a
more direct approach is useful.
In general, the IRR of an increment of capital is the interest rate, i∗, that
equates the equivalent worth of the higher capital investment cost alternative to
the equivalent worth of the lower capital investment cost alternative. The decision
rule using this approach is that, if i∗≥MARR, the increment is justiﬁed and
the alternative with the higher capital investment cost is preferred. So, when
repeatability applies, we simply need to develop the AW equation for each
alternative over its own useful life and ﬁnd the interest rate that makes them
equal. To demonstrate, consider the alternatives that were analyzed in Example 6-8
by using a MARR of 10% per year and a study period of 12 years (repeatability
assumption).

By trial and error, the IRR of the extra capital needed to repeatedly invest in
Alternative B (instead of Alternative A) over the study period is i∗= 26%. Since
this value is greater than the MARR, the increment is justiﬁed and Alternative B
is preferred. This is the same decision arrived at in Example 6-7. The interested
student is encouraged to verify that, if the spreadsheet previously displayed in
Figure 6-10 were to be expanded to include a column of incremental cash ﬂows
over the entire 12-year study period, the IRR of these cash ﬂows, using the IRR
function, is indeed 26%.
6.5.3
The Imputed Market Value Technique
Obtaining a current estimate from the marketplace for a piece of equipment or another
type of asset is the preferred procedure in engineering practice when a market
value at time T < (useful life) is required. This approach, however, may not be
feasible in some cases. For example, a type of asset may have low turnover in the

276
CHAPTER 6 / COMPARISON AND SELECTION AMONG ALTERNATIVES
marketplace, and information for recent transactions is not available. Hence, it is
sometimes necessary to estimate the market value for an asset without current and
representative historical data.
The imputed market value technique, which is sometimes called the implied
market value, can be used for this purpose as well as for comparison with
marketplace values when current data are available. The estimating procedure
used in the technique is based on logical assumptions about the value of the
remaining useful life for an asset. If an imputed market value is needed for a piece
of equipment, say, at the end of year T < (useful life), the estimate is calculated on
the basis of the sum of two parts, as follows:
MVT = [PW at EOY T of remaining capital recovery (CR) amounts]
+[PW at EOY T of original market value at end of useful life],
where PW is computed at i = MARR.
The next example uses information from Example 6-11 to illustrate the
technique.
EXAMPLE 6-12
Estimating a New Market Value when Useful Life > Study Period
Use the imputed market value technique to develop an estimated market value
for pump model HEPS9 (Example 6-11) at EOY ﬁve. The MARR remains 20%
per year.
Solution
The original information from Example 6-11 will be used in the solution: capital
investment = $47,600, useful life = nine years, and market value = $5,000 at the
end of useful life.
First,
compute the PW at EOY ﬁve of the remaining CR amounts
[Equation (5-5)]:
PW(20%)CR = [$47,600(A/P, 20%, 9) −$5,000(A/F, 20%, 9)] × (P/A, 20%, 4)
= $29,949.
Next, compute the PW at EOY ﬁve of the original MV at the end of useful life
(nine years):
PW(20%)MV = $5,000(P/F, 20%, 4) = $2,412.
Then, the estimated market value at EOY ﬁve (T = 5) is as follows:
MV5 = PWCR + PWMV
= $29,949 + $2,412 = $32,361.
In summary, utilizing the repeatability assumption for unequal lives among
alternatives reduces to the simple rule of “comparing alternatives over their
useful lives using the AW method, at i = MARR.” This simpliﬁcation, however,

SECTION 6.6 / PERSONAL FINANCES 277
may not apply when a study period, selected to be shorter or longer than the
common multiple of lives (coterminated assumption), is more appropriate for
the decision situation. When utilizing the coterminated assumption, cash ﬂows
of alternatives need to be adjusted to terminate at the end of the study period.
Adjusting these cash ﬂows usually requires estimating the market value of assets
at the end of the study period or extending service to the end of the study period
through leasing or some other assumption.
6.6
Personal Finances
Sound ﬁnancial planning is all about making wise choices for your particular
circumstances (e.g., your amount of personal savings, your job security, your
attitude toward risk). Thus far in Chapter 6, we have focused on facilitating good
decision making from the perspective of a corporation. Now we apply these same
principles (remember them from Chapter 1?) to several problems you are likely to
face soon in your personal decision making.
Two of the largest investments you’ll ever make involve houses and
automobiles. This section presents examples of acquiring these assets, usually with
borrowed money. Another concern is the extensive use of credit cards (maybe we
think that nothing is expensive on a credit card). It turns out that people who use
credit cards (almost all of us!) tend to spend more money than others who pay cash
or write checks. An enlightening exercise to see how addicted you are to credit
cards is to go cold turkey for two months.
A fundamental lesson underlying this section is to save now rather than
spending on luxury purchases. By choosing to save now, we are making an attempt
to minimize the risk of making poor decisions later on. Check out the savings
calculators at www.Choosetosave.org.
EXAMPLE 6-13
Automobile Financing Options
You have decided to purchase a new automobile with a hybrid-fueled engine
and a six-speed transmission. After the trade-in of your present car, the purchase
price of the new automobile is $30,000. This balance can be ﬁnanced by an auto
dealer at 2.9% APR with payments over 48 months. Alternatively, you can get a
$2,000 discount on the purchase price if you ﬁnance the loan balance at an APR
of 8.9% over 48 months. Should you accept the 2.9% ﬁnancing plan or accept the
dealer’s offer of a $2,000 rebate with 8.9% ﬁnancing? BothAPRs are compounded
monthly.
Solution
In this example, we assume that your objective is to minimize your monthly car
payment.
2.9% ﬁnancing monthly payment:
$30,000 (A/P, 2.9%/12, 48 months) = $30,000(0.0221) = $663.00 per month

278
CHAPTER 6 / COMPARISON AND SELECTION AMONG ALTERNATIVES
8.9% ﬁnancing monthly payment:
$28,000 (A/P, 8.9%/12, 48 months) = $28,000(0.0248) = $694.90 per month
Therefore, to minimize your monthly payment, you should select the 2.9%
ﬁnancing option.
What If Questions
When shopping for an automobile you’ll ﬁnd that there are many ﬁnancing
options like the ones in this example available to you. You may ﬁnd it useful to
ask yourself questions such as “how high would the rebate have to be for me
to prefer the rebate option,” or “how low would the APR have to be for me to
select the rebate option?” The answers to these questions can be found through
simple equivalence calculations.
(a) How much would the rebate have to be?
Let X = rebate amount. Using the monthly payment of $663 from the 2.9%
ﬁnancing option, we can solve for the rebate amount that would yield the
same monthly payment.
($30,000 −X)(A/P, 8.9%/12 months, 48 months) = $663
($30,000 −X)(0.0248) = $663
X = $3,266
(b) How low would the interest rate have to be?
Now we want to ﬁnd the interest rate that equates borrowing $28,000 to 48
monthlypaymentsof$663. Thisquestioniseasilysolvedusingaspreadsheet
package.
RATE (48, −663, 28000) = 0.535% per month
APR = 0.535% × 12 = 6.42%
EXAMPLE 6-14
Mortgage Financing Options
A general rule of thumb is that your monthly mortgage payment should not
exceed 28% of your household’s gross monthly income. Consider the situation of
JerryandTracy, whojustcommittedtoa$300,000mortgageontheirdreamhome.
They have reduced their ﬁnancing choices to a 30-year conventional mortgage
at 6% APR, or a 30-year interest-only mortgage at 6% APR.
(a) Which mortgage, if either, do they qualify for if their combined gross annual
income is $70,000?
(b) What is the disadvantage in an interest-only mortgage compared to the
conventional mortgage?

SECTION 6.6 / PERSONAL FINANCES 279
Solution
(a) Using the general rule of thumb, Jerry and Tracy can afford a monthly
mortgage payment of (0.28)($70,000/12) = $1,633. The monthly payment
for the conventional mortgage is
$300,000 (A/P, 0.5%, 360) = $1,800.
For the interest-only mortgage, the monthly payment is
(0.005)($300,000) = $1,500.
Thus, the conventional mortgage payment is larger than what the guideline
suggests is affordable. This type of loan is marginal because it stretches their
budget too much. They easily qualify for the interest-only mortgage because
the $1,500 payment is less than $1,633.
(b) If home prices fall in the next several years, Jerry and Tracy may have
“negative equity” in their home because no principal has been repaid in
their monthly interest-only payments. They will not have any buffer to fall
back on should they have to sell their house for less than they purchased
it for.
It is important to note that interest-only loans don’t remain interest-only
fortheentireloanperiod. Thelengthoftimethatinterest-onlypaymentsmay
be made is deﬁned in the mortgage contract and can be as short as 5 years
or as long as 15 years. After the interest-only period is over, the monthly
payment adjusts to include principal and interest. It is calculated to repay
the entire loan by the end of the loan period. Suppose Jerry and Tracy’s
interest-only period was ﬁve years. After this time, the monthly payment
would become
$300,000(A/P, 0.5%, 300) = $1,932.90.
Before Jerry and Tracy accept this type of loan, they should be conﬁdent that
they will be able to afford the $1,932.90 monthly payment in ﬁve years.
EXAMPLE 6-15
Comparison of Two Savings Plans
Suppose you start a savings plan in which you save $500 each year for 15 years.
You make your ﬁrst payment at age 22 and then leave the accumulated sum in
the savings plan (and make no more annual payments) until you reach age 65,
at which time you withdraw the total accumulated amount. The average annual
interest rate you’ll earn on this savings plan is 10%.
A friend of yours (exactly your age) from Minnesota State University waits
10 years to start her savings plan. (That is, she is 32 years old.) She decides to
save $2,000 each year in an account earning interest at the rate of 10% per year.
She will make these annual payments until she is 65 years old, at which time
she will withdraw the total accumulated amount.

CHAPTER 6 / COMPARISON AND SELECTION AMONG ALTERNATIVES
How old will you be when your friend’s accumulated savings amount
(including interest) exceeds yours? State any assumptions you think are

Solution
Creating cash-ﬂow diagrams for Example 6-15 is an important ﬁrst step in
solving for the unknown number of years, N, until the future equivalent values
of both savings plans are equal. The two diagrams are shown below. The future
equivalent (F) of your plan is $500(F/A, 10%, 15)(F/P, 10%, N −36) and that of
your friend is F′ = $2,000(F/A, 10%, N −31). It is clear that N, the age at which
F = F′, is greater than 32. Assuming that the interest rate remains constant at
10% per year, the value of N can be determined by trial and error:

By the time you reach age 39, your friend’s accumulated savings will exceed
yours. (If you had deposited $1,000 instead of $500, you would be over 76 years
when your friend’s plan surpassed yours. Moral: Start saving early!)

SECTION 6.7 / CASE STUDY—NED AND LARRY’S ICE CREAM COMPANY 281
EXAMPLE 6-16
Credit Card Offers
Randy just cancelled his credit card with a large bank. A week later, a
representative of the bank called Randy with an offer of a “better” credit card
that will advance Randy $2,000 when he accepts it. Randy could not refuse the
offer and several days later receives a check for $2,000 from the bank. With this
money, Randy decides to buy a new computer.
At the next billing cycle (a month later), the $2,000 advance appears as a
charge against Randy’s account, and the APR is stated to be 21% (compounded
monthly). At this point in time, Randy elects to pay the minimum monthly
payment of $40 and cuts up the credit card so that he cannot make any additional
purchases.
(a) Over what period of time does this payment extend in order to repay the
$2,000 principal?
(b) If Randy decides to repay all remaining principal after having made
15 monthly payments, how much will he repay?
Solution
(a) You may be surprised to know that the majority of credit card companies
determine the minimum monthly payment based on a repayment period
of 10 years. The monthly interest rate being charged for Randy’s card is
21%/12 = 1.75%. We can solve the following equivalence relationship to
determine the number of $40 monthly payments required to pay off a loan
principal of $2,000.
$2,000 = $40(P/A, 1.75%, N)
This is easily solved using the NPER (rate, payment, principal) function in
Excel.
NPER(1.75%, −40, 2000) = 119.86
Sure enough, it will take Randy 120 months to pay off this debt.
(b) After having made 15 payments, Randy has 105 payments remaining. To
ﬁnd the single sum payoff for this loan, we simply have to determine the
present worth of the remaining payments.
Payoff = $40(P/A, 1.75%, 105) = $1,915.96
This payoff amount assumes no penalty for early repayment of the loan
(which is typically the case when it comes to credit cards). Notice how very
little principal ($84.06) was repaid in the early part of the loan.

CASE STUDY−−Ned and Larry’s Ice Cream Company
Ned and Larry’s Ice Cream Company produces specialty ice cream and frozen
yogurt in pint-sized containers. The latest annual performance report praised the
ﬁrm for its progressive policies but noted that environmental issues like packaging

282
CHAPTER 6 / COMPARISON AND SELECTION AMONG ALTERNATIVES
disposal were a concern. In an effort to reduce the effects of consumer disposal
of product packaging, the report stated that Ned and Larry’s should consider the
following proposals:
Proposal A—Package all ice cream and frozen yogurt in quart containers.
Proposal B—Package all ice cream and frozen yogurt in half-gallon containers.
By packaging the product in containers larger than the current pints, the plastic-
coated bleached sulfate board containers will hold more ounces of product per
square inch of surface area. The net result is less discarded packaging per ounce
of product consumed. Additional advantages to using larger containers include
lower packaging costs per ounce and less handling labor per ounce.
Changing to a larger container requires redesign of the packaging and
modiﬁcations to the ﬁlling production line.
The existing material-handling
equipment can handle the pints and quarts, but additional equipment will be
required to handle half-gallons. Any new equipment purchased for proposals A
and B has an expected useful life of six years. The total capital investment for each
proposal is shown in the accompanying table. The table summarizes the details of
these proposals, as well as the current production of pints.

Because Ned and Larry’s promotes partnering with suppliers, customers, and
the community, they wish to include a portion of the cost to society when evaluating
these alternatives. They will consider 50% of the postconsumer landﬁll cost as part
of the costs for each alternative. They have estimated landﬁll costs to average $20
per cubic yard nationwide.
Ned and Larry’s uses a MARR of 15% per year and IRR analyses to evaluate
capital investments. A study period of six years will be used, at which time the
equipment purchased for proposals A and B will have negligible market value.
Production will remain constant at 10,625,000 gallons per year. Determine whether
Ned and Larry’s should package ice cream and frozen yogurt in pints, quarts, or
half-gallons.
Solution
Assuming that Ned and Larry’s is able to sell all ice cream and frozen yogurt
produced, we can focus on the differences in costs associated with the three
packaging alternatives. Since our recommendation is to be supported by IRR
analysis, we must use the incremental analysis procedure.

SECTION 6.7 / CASE STUDY—NED AND LARRY’S ICE CREAM COMPANY 283
The ﬁrst step in the incremental analysis procedure is to rank-order the
alternatives by increasing capital investment:
Current(pints) →A(quarts) →B(half-gallons).
Now we can compute the incremental difference between producing in quarts (A)
insteadofpints(current)anddeterminewhethertheincrementalcapitalinvestment
is justiﬁed.
! (A −current)
! Capital investment
−$1,200,000
! Packaging cost savings
[$0.031/gal](10,625,000 gal/yr) = $329,375/yr
! Handling cost savings
[$0.008/gal](10,625,000 gal/yr) = $85,000/yr
! Landﬁll cost savings
[1,300 yd3/yr](0.5)($20/yd3) = $13,000/yr
To determine the IRR of the incremental investment, we can ﬁnd the interest rate
at which the PW of the incremental cash ﬂows is zero.
PW(i′
!%) = 0 = −$1,200,000 + ($329,375 + $85,000 + $13,000)(P/A, i′
!%, 6).
Bytrialanderror, i′
!% = 27.2% > MARR. Thus, theinvestmentrequiredtoproduce
the quart-size containers for ice cream is economically justiﬁed. Our decision is
currently to produce quart-size containers unless the extra investment required
to produce in half-gallon-size containers (B) earns at least the MARR based on
projected savings.
! (B −A)
! Capital investment
−$700,000

! Landﬁll cost savings
[1,150 yd3/yr](0.5)($20/yd3) = $11,500/yr
PW(i′
!%) = 0 = −$700,000 + ($159,375 + $10,625 + $11,500)(P/A, i′
!%, 6)
By trial and error, i′
!% = 14.3% < MARR. Therefore, the extra investment required
to produce in half-gallon-size containers (B) is not justiﬁed by the quantiﬁed extra
savings.
Based on the preceding incremental IRR analysis, the ﬁnal recommendation for
Ned and Larry’s Ice Cream Company is to produce ice cream and frozen yogurt in
quart containers (i.e., Proposal A). The foregoing incremental analysis procedure
indicates that this recommendation will yield an i′
!% = 27.2%, which is greater
than the MARR of 15%. So, by making the recommended change to packaging all
ice cream and frozen yogurt in quart containers, not only will Ned and Larry’s be
delivering great tasting products that are economically attractive to the company,
but also the company will be environmentally conscious as well! A win all around!

CHAPTER 6 / COMPARISON AND SELECTION AMONG ALTERNATIVES
6.8
Postevaluation of Results
After comparing alternatives and identifying the preferred course of action (Step 6),
we return to the important Step 7 of the economic analysis procedure in Table 1-1.
Postaudit reviews, which are appraisals of how a project is progressing against
critical milestones, should be conducted during and after a project, recommended
by the procedures in Chapter 6, has been approved and funded. This periodic
feedback will inform management about the following:
1. Are the planned objectives and milestones being (or have been) attained by the
project?
2. Is corrective action required to bring the project in line with the expectations?
3. What can be learned from the selected (and implemented) project that will
improve estimating for future projects?
Learning from past decisions (both good and bad!) is critical to improving
future decisions.
Periodic postaudit reviews serve to reduce, and often correct for, possible bias
in favor of what individual corporate units, divisions, and subsidiaries would
like to accomplish to serve their own self-interests. The tendency to estimate
optimistically future cash ﬂows and other conditions for pet projects seems to
be human nature, but a fair and above-board audit during and after each major
project should keep this in check. As a result, estimating project outcomes will
be taken more seriously when projects are tracked and monitored over their life
cycles. However, a balance must be struck between overly aggressive postaudits
and the counter behavior of causing estimators to become overly conservative in
their project appraisals.
6.9
Project Postevaluation Spreadsheet Approach
Thus far, we have addressed parameter estimation, economic modeling, and
decision making. We now present a means to assess the performance of this
entire modeling process. In a reversal of our normal approach to spreadsheets,
the analysis is presented ﬁrst, followed by the spreadsheet model.
Quality engineers rely on Individuals control charts, which are based on
individual values rather than averages, to identify areas for process improvement.
These charts identify cases that are drastically different from the rest, providing
a primary focus for improvement efforts. As economic modeling is an ongoing
process, control charts serve as a ﬁrst step in improving accuracy. While control
charts can guide improvement efforts, they do not indicate speciﬁcally how to
improve a process.
Consider a project tracking database with the following information: Product
(Legacy or Joint Venture), Estimated Savings, Actual Savings, and Facility (North,
East, West, South, or Central). The accuracy of the estimation process is typically
measured by looking at the Savings Gap, which is the difference between the actual
andestimatedsavings. Whentheestimationprocessisperformingwell, theaverage
Savings Gap will be zero with minimal variation.

SECTION 6.9 / PROJECT POSTEVALUATION SPREADSHEET APPROACH 285
A control chart uses process data to establish a region of typical performance,
which is bounded by the Upper and Lower Control Limits. If the data fall within
this region and exhibit no unusual patterns, the process is deemed to be in a state
of statistical control. Future performance measures will be centered around the
average and fall within the region deﬁned by the control limits. If the process is
not in control, investigating the outlying cases will point to promising areas for
improvement.
Figure 6-13 shows an Individuals control chart for 40 projects. There are four out-
of-control points: Projects 7, 17, 34, and 35. We can identify these in the spreadsheet
by hovering the cursor over each plotted point. All four projects are Joint Ventures,
implying that there is something signiﬁcantly different about how those project
beneﬁts were estimated. Three of these four project signiﬁcantly overestimated the
savings.
To explore this preliminary ﬁnding, code the Product Type numerically and
create a scatter plot of Savings Gap versus Product Type. Select the “no ﬁll” option
on the plot symbols to provide a cleaner view of the overlapping data values.
Refer to Figure 6-14. The spread and center of the Savings Gap data for the Legacy
products indicate that these products are estimated more precisely and with less
bias then the Joint Venture products.
The large range of Savings Gap values for the Joint Venture products indicates
that there are additional sources of variation in the estimation process. Figure 6-15
is a scatter plot by Facility. As in Figure 6-14, numeric coding of Facility is required
to create this graph. To facilitate comparisons, the ranges of the X-axes are the same
on both plots.
The range of the Savings Gap is greatest at the West facility. We know from the
control chart that these extreme values are for Joint Venture products. There is an

broken here, since West has the largest underestimation as well. Investigation is
required to understand this exception to the pattern to better understand how the

The East facility has the next greatest variation, and the low value is another
Joint Venture product. Additional review shows that the Joint Venture products
come only from these two facilities.

Figure 6-16
Spreadsheet formulas for Individuals control chart. Only the ﬁrst ﬁve projects from the
database are shown to conserve space.
The analysis has narrowed the scope of our investigation to Joint Venture
products at the West and East facilities. Understanding the issues affecting this
blend of product and facility will provide the quickest reduction in bias in variation
in the estimation process.
The spreadsheet model is shown in Figure 6-16. Only the ﬁrst ﬁve rows of
the data base are included. There are two intermediate calculations involved:
(1) the Savings Gap in cell E2 and (2) the moving range (mR) in cell I3, which is
the absolute value of the difference between consecutive Savings Gap values. This
local measure of variation is used to determine the control limits. Both cells are
copied down the worksheet.
There is also a set of summary calculations used to create the control chart
limits: the average Savings Gap in cell O2 (which is the center line on the chart),
the average moving range in cell O3, and a constant in cell O4 that is used to
determine the control limits. The UCL and LCL equations are in cells O5 and O6.
Readers interested in control charts are encouraged to consult suitable references
for the constants and equations used.
The next step is to have cells J2, K2, and L2 use absolute addressing to copy
the respective values from O2, O5, and O6. These cells are then copied down the
worksheet. To create the chart, select line plot and specify data ranges of E2:E41 for
the data, J2:J41 for the center line, K2:K41 for the UCL, and L2:L41 for the LCL.
Like any other process, estimation can be improved by comparing actual and
predicted results and then incorporating a variety of techniques to identify and
eliminate sources of bias and variation. Graphic methods work best in these initial
efforts.

6-B. At the Motorola plant in Mesa, Arizona, it is desired to determine whether
one-inch-thick insulation or two-inch-thick insulation should be used to
reduce heat loss from a long section of steam pipe. The heat loss from this
pipe without any insulation would cost $2.00 per linear foot per year. The one-
inch insulation will eliminate 88% of the heat loss and will cost $0.60 per foot.
Two-inch insulation will eliminate 92% of the heat loss and will cost $1.10 per
foot. The steam pipe is 1,000 feet in length and will last for10 years. MARR =
6% per year. Which insulation thickness should be recommended? (6.4)
6-C. Your company is environmentally conscious and is looking at two heating
options for a new research building. What you know about each option is
below, and your company will use an annual interest rate of 8% for this
decision:
Gas Heating Option: The initial equipment and installment of the natural
gas system would cost $225,000 right now. The maintenance costs of the
equipment are expected to be $2,000 per year, starting next year, for each of
the next 20 years. The energy cost is expected to be $5,000, starting next year,
and is expected to rise by 5% per year for each of the next 20 years due to the
price of natural gas increasing.
Geothermal Heating Option: Because of green energy incentives provided
by the government, the geothermal equipment and installation is expected
to cost only $200,000 right now, which is cheaper than the gas lines. There
would be no energy cost with geothermal, but because this is a relatively
newer technology, the maintenance costs are expected to be $10,000 per year,
starting next year, for each of the next 20 years.
Which is the lower cost option for the company? (4.12 and 6.4)
6-D. A steam generator is needed in the design of a new power plant. This

the new baghouse? (6.4)
6-G. The local police department is considering two types of sidearms for its
ofﬁcers. The Glock 40 costs $400 apiece and has a life of 5 years. The other
option is a Sauer 45 that costs $800 and has a 10-year life. The Sauer pistol
has a residual value of $200 at the end of its 10-year service life. Assume
repeatability and compute the internal rate of return on the incremental cash
ﬂow of the two pistols. If the department uses a MARR of 5% per year, is the
Sauer 45 the better choice? (6.5)

Summary
The following chart is a bird’s eye view of the methods used in Chapter 6 to identify
the preferred alternative.∗
When Lives of Alternatives = Study Period
Simplest Approach: Compute the equivalent worth of each alternative (PW, AW,
FW, or CW)
Decision Rule: Select alternative with the highest equivalent worth.
If comparing cost alternatives, this will be the alternative with the least
negative equivalent worth.
Rate-of-Return Methods: The base alternative is the one with the smallest investment
cost (if an investment alternative, the IRRbase ≥MARR). Use incremental
analysis to compare base alternative to next smallest investment cost alternative.
DecisionRule: If IRR△≥MARR, eliminate base and move on to next comparison.
If IRR△< MARR, keep base and move on to next comparison.
When Lives of Alternatives Are Different:
Repeatability Assumption:
Simplest Approach: Use AW over each alternative’s own life. Select the
alternative with the greatest AW.
∗Special thanks to Karen Bursic for suggesting this format for the summary.

292
CHAPTER 6 / COMPARISON AND SELECTION AMONG ALTERNATIVES
Rate-of-Return Approach: Set AW of base = AW of next smallest investment
cost and solve for the unknown interest rate i△’.
Decision Rule: If IRR△≥MARR, eliminate base and move to next comparison.
If IRR△< MARR, keep base and move to next comparison.
Coterminated Assumption:
Simplest Approach: For investment alternatives, the most logical approach
is to bring all cash ﬂows to time N, the end of the life of the longest
lived alternative without repeating any cash ﬂows (use FW). You could
also use the shortest life and the imputed market value for longer lived
alternatives.
Rate-of-Return Approach: Perform an incremental analysis with an
appropriate study period and assumptions regarding extended or
shortened alternative lives.

6-5. An airport needs a modern material handling
system for facilitating access to and from a busy
maintenance hangar. A second-hand system will cost
$75,000. A new system with improved technology
can decrease labor hours by 20% compared to the
used system. The new system will cost $150,000 to
purchase and install. Both systems have a useful life
of ﬁve years. The market value of the used system is
expected to be $20,000 in ﬁve years, and the market
value of the new system is anticipated to be $50,000
in ﬁve years. Current maintenance activity will require
the used system to be operated 8 hours per day for
20 days per month. If labor costs $40 per hour and
the MARR is 1% per month, which system should be
recommended? (6.4)
6-6. You have been asked to evaluate the

types of cooling towers: wet and dry. Furthermore, heat
may be removed from condenser water by (1) forcing
(mechanically) air through the tower or (2) allowing
heat transfer to occur by making use of natural
draft. Consequently, there are four basic cooling tower
designs that could be considered. Assuming that the
cost of capital to the utility company is 12% per
year, your job is to recommend the best alternative
(i.e., the least expensive during the service life) in
view of the data in Table P6-6. Further, assume that
each alternative is capable of satisfactorily removing
waste heat from the condensers of a 200-MW power
plant.

A decision-maker can select one of these alternatives or
decide to select none of them. Make a recommendation
using the PW method. (6.4)

economics of replacing 1,000 60-Watt incan-
descent
light
bulbs
(ILBs)
with
1,000
compact
ﬂuorescent lamps (CFLs) for a particular lighting
application. During your investigation you discover
that 13-Watt CFLs costing $2.00 each will provide the
same illumination as standard 60-Watt ILBs costing
$0.50 each. Interestingly, CFLs last, on average, eight
times as long as incandescent bulbs. The average life of
an ILB is one year over the anticipated usage of 1,000
hours each year. Each incandescent bulb costs $2.00 to
install/replace. Installation of a single CFL costs $3.00,
and it will also be used 1,000 hours per year.
Electricity costs $0.12 per kiloWatt hour (kWh), and
you decide to compare the two lighting options over
an 8-year study period. If the MARR is 12% per year,

a brief report of your ﬁndings for the boss. (6.4)
6-9. On her thirty-ﬁrst birthday, Jean invests $1,000
into her employer’s retirement plan, and she continues
to make annual $1,000 payments for 10 years. So
her total contribution (principal) is $10,000. Jean then
stops making payments into her plan and keeps her
money in the savings plan untouched for 25 more
years. Doug starts putting money aside on his forty-
ﬁrst birthday when he deposits $1,000, and he continues
these payments until he gets to be 65 years old. Doug’s
contributed principal amounts to $25,000 over this
period of time.
If Jean’s and Doug’s retirement plans earn interest
of 6% per year, how much will they have accumulated
(principal plus interest) when they reach 65 years old?
What is the moral of this situation? (6.4)

calls for a concrete pavement costing $90 per foot with a
20-year life; two paved ditches costing $3 per foot each;
and three box culverts every mile, each costing $9,000
and having a 20-year life. Annual maintenance will cost
$1,800 per mile; the culverts must be cleaned every ﬁve
years at a cost of $450 each per mile.
Design B calls for a bituminous pavement costing
$45 per foot with a 10-year life; two sodded ditches
costing $1.50 per foot each; and three pipe culverts
every mile, each costing $2,250 and having a 10-year life.
The replacement culverts will cost $2,400 each. Annual
maintenance will cost $2,700 per mile; the culverts must
be cleaned yearly at a cost of $225 each per mile; and the
annual ditch maintenance will cost $1.50 per foot per
ditch.
Compare the two designs on the basis of equivalent
worth per mile for a 20-year period. Find the most
economical design on the basis of AW and PW if the
MARR is 6% per year. (6.3, 6.4)

motor has an efﬁciency of 90%. Its purchase and
installation price is $2,200. A second 30-horsepower
high-efﬁciency motor can be purchased for $3,200, and
its efﬁciency is 93%. Either motor will be operated 4,000

used as a substitute for traditional wood framing
in building construction. Heating and cooling bills
will be about 50% less than in a similar wood-frame
home in Vermont. An ICF home will be approximately
10% more expensive to construct than a wood-frame
home.
A typical 2,000 square foot home costs $120 per
square foot to build with wood framing in Vermont
and costs $200 per month (on average) to heat or cool.
What is the IRR on the incremental investment in an
equivalent-sized ICF home? The home’s residual value
with both framing methods in 20 years is expected to be
$280,000. (6.4)

fueled car in favor of a hybrid (gasoline and
electric) automobile? Let’s take a look at the relative
economics of your possible choice. The gasoline-fueled
car sells for $20,000 and gets 25 miles per gallon (mpg) of
fuel. The alternative hybrid vehicle sells for $25,000 and
averages 46 mpg. The resale value of the hybrid car is
$2,000 more than that of the gasoline-only car after ﬁve

plans for rejuvenating the forest and landscape of a large
tract of public land. The study period is indeﬁnitely
long, and the Park Service’s MARR is 10% per year.
You have been asked to compare the two plans using
the CW method.
The ﬁrst plan (Skyline) calls for an initial investment
of $500,000, with expenses of $20,000 per year for the
ﬁrst 20 years and $30,000 per year thereafter. Skyline
also requires an expenditure of $200,000 twenty years
after the initial investment, and this will repeat every
20 years thereafter. The second plan (Prairie View) has an
initial investment of $700,000 followed by a single (one-
time) investment of $300,000 thirty years later. Prairie
View will incur annual expenses of $10,000 forever.
Based on the CW measure, which plan would you
recommend? (6.5)

6-57. A single-stage centrifugal blower is to be
selected for an engineering design application.
Suppliers have been consulted, and the choice has been
narrowed down to two new models, both made by the
same company and both having the same rated capacity
and pressure. Both are driven at 3,600 rpm by identical
90-hp electric motors (output).
One blower has a guaranteed efﬁciency of 72% at
full load and is offered for $42,000. The other is more
expensive because of aerodynamic reﬁnement, which
gives it a guaranteed efﬁciency of 81% at full load.
Except for these differences in efﬁciency and in-
stalled price, the units are equally desirable in other
operating characteristics such as durability, mainte-
nance, ease of operation, and quietness. In both cases,
plots of efﬁciency versus amount of air handled are ﬂat
in the vicinity of full rated load. The application is such
that, whenever the blower is running, it will be at full
load.
Assume that both blowers have negligible market
values at the end of the useful life, and the ﬁrm’s MARR
is 20% per year. Develop a formula for calculating how
much the user could afford to pay for the more efﬁcient
unit. (Hint: You need to specify important parameters
and use them in your formula, and remember 1 hp =
0.746 kW.) (6.4)
6-58. A pump for a reservoir must be operated
continuously (8,760 hours per year).
In the
event of a large storm, the electricity from the local
utility’s power grid may be interrupted for an indeﬁnite
period of time. To deal with this emergency situation,
two mutually exclusive backup diesel generators are
being investigated. One of them will be chosen for
implementation. Relevant data are provided as follows:

If salvage values of both generators are negligible and
the study period is 60 years, which generator should be
chosen? The MARR is 10% per year. (6.5)
6-59. A high-quality ﬁlter for tap water and a
reusable drinking container cost $75 and typically
will last for three years. If a family drinks an average
of eight cups of water per day (one cup is 8 ﬂuid
ounces), the consumption of water is 547.5 gallons
over a three-year period. Tap water costs $0.01 per
gallon. Alternatively, bottled water may be purchased
in 16-ounce bottles for $1.29 each. Compare the present
worth of tap ﬁltered water versus bottled water if the
family can earn 10% per year on their investments.
Assume uniform water consumption over the three-
year study period. (6.6)
6-60. Your FICO score makes a big difference in how
lenders determine what interest rate to charge you.
Consider the situation faced by Edward and Jorge.
Edward has a fairly poor FICO score of 660 and, as a
result, pays 18.0% APR on the unpaid balance of his
credit card. Jorge has a FICO score of 740 and pays only
7.3% APR on the unpaid balance of his credit card. If
both persons carry an average balance of $3,000 on their
credit cards for three years, how much more money
will Edward repay compared with what Jorge owes
(moral: you want a high FICO score)? Assume monthly
compounding of interest. (6.6)

interest-only payments while you are still in school.
If interest is not repaid, it folds into principal after
graduation and can cost you hundreds (or thousands)
of extra dollars in ﬁnance charges.
For example, Sara borrowed $5,000 at the beginning
of her freshman year and another $5,000 at the
beginning of her junior year. The interest rate (APR)
is 9% per year, compounded monthly, so Sara’s interest
accumulates at 0.75% per month. Sara will repay what
she owes as an ordinary annuity over 60 months,

7% APR. Monthly payments (360 of them) will be made
on a $200,000 loan. The realtor says that if you wait
several months to obtain a mortgage, the APR could be
as high as 8%, “and the monthly payments will jump
by 14%.” Is the realtor’s claim true? If not, what percent
increase in monthly payment will result from this 1%
increase in APR? (6.6)

is $30,000. This balance can be ﬁnanced by the auto
dealership at 2.9% APR and payments over 48 months.
Compounding of interest is monthly. Alternatively, he
can get a $2,000 discount on the purchase price if he
ﬁnances the loan balance at an APR of 8.9% over 48
months. Should your brother accept the 2.9% ﬁnancing
plan or accept the dealer’s offer of a $2,000 rebate with
8.9% ﬁnancing? (6.6)

house and they are considering the installation
of 10 compact ﬂuorescent bulb (CFB) ﬁxtures instead
of the 10 conventional incandescent lighting ﬁxtures
(which cost a total of $500) typically installed by the
builder. According to the home builder, CFBs use 70%
less electricity than incandescent bulbs, and they last
10 times longer before the bulb needs replacement. Bob
calculates that 1,000 watts of incandescent lighting will
be required in the house for 3,000 hours of usage per
year. The cost of electricity is $0.10 per kWh. Also,
each CFB will save 150 pounds of CO2 per year. Each
pound of CO2 has a penalty of $0.02. If incandescent
bulbs cost $0.75 each and last for one year, use a 10-year
study period to determine the maximum cost of CFB
ﬁxtures and bulbs that can be justiﬁed in this house.

is a 5% up-front commission (payable now) on a
Class A account, which every year thereafter then
charges a 0.61% management fee. A Class B account
has no up-front commission, but its management fee
is 2.35% in year one, 0.34% in year two, and 1.37%

CHAPTER 7
Depreciation and Income Taxes
The objective of Chapter 7 is to explain how depreciation affects income
taxes and how income taxes affect economic decision making.
The After-Tax Cost of Producing
Electricity
T
he PennCo Electric Utility Company is going to construct an
800 megawatt (MW) coal-ﬁred plant that will have a 30-year
operating life. The $1.12-billion construction cost will be depre-
ciated with the straight-line method over 30 years to a terminal book value of
zero. Its market value will also be negligible after 30 years. This plant’s efﬁciency
will be 35%, its capacity factor is estimated to be 80%, and annual operating
and maintenance expenses are expected to be $0.02 per kilowatt hour (kWh). In
addition, the cost of coal is estimated to average $3.50 per million Btu, and the
tax on carbon dioxide emissions will be $15 per metric ton. Burning coal emits
90 metric tons of CO2 per billion Btu produced. If the effective income tax rate for
PennCo is 40%, what is the after-tax cost of electricity per year for this plant? The
ﬁrm’s after-tax minimum attractive rate of return (MARR) is 10% per year. After
studying this chapter, you will be able to include the impact of income taxes on
engineering projects and answer this question (see Example 7-14).

Nothing in this world is certain but death and taxes.
—Benjamin Franklin (1789)
7.1 Introduction
Taxes have been collected since the dawn of civilization. Interestingly, in the United
States, a federal income tax did not exist until March 13, 1913, when Congress
enacted the Sixteenth Amendment to the Constitution.∗Most organizations
consider the effect of income taxes on the ﬁnancial results of a proposed engineering
project because income taxes usually represent a signiﬁcant cash outﬂow that
cannot be ignored in decision making. Based on the previous chapters, we can
now describe how income tax liabilities (or credits) and after-tax cash ﬂows are
determined in engineering practice. In this chapter, an After-Tax Cash Flow (ATCF)
procedure will be used in capital investment analysis because it avoids innumer-
able problems associated with measuring corporate net income. This theoretically
sound procedure provides a quick and relatively easy way to deﬁne a project’s
proﬁtability.†
Because the amount of material included in the Internal Revenue Code (and in
state and municipal laws, where they exist) is very extensive, only selected parts
of the subject can be discussed within the scope of this textbook. Our focus in
this chapter is federal corporate income taxes and their general effect on the ﬁnancial
results of proposed engineering projects. The material presented is for educational
purposes. In practice, you should seek expert counsel when analyzing a speciﬁc
project.
Due to the effect of depreciation on the ATCFs of a project, this topic is discussed
ﬁrst. The selected material on depreciation will then be used in the remainder of
the chapter for accomplishing after-tax analyses of engineering projects.
7.2 Depreciation Concepts and Terminology
Depreciation is the decrease in value of physical properties with the passage
of time and use. More speciﬁcally, depreciation is an accounting concept that
establishes an annual deduction against before-tax income such that the effect of
time and use on an asset’s value can be reﬂected in a ﬁrm’s ﬁnancial statements.
∗During the Civil War, a federal income tax rate of 3% was initially imposed in 1862 by the Commissioner of Internal
Revenue to help pay for war expenditures. The federal rate was later raised to 10%, but eventually eliminated in 1872.
† ATCF is used throughout this book as a measure of the after-tax proﬁtability of an investment project. Other measures,
however, are employed for this purpose by management accountants (net income after taxes) and ﬁnance professionals
(free cash ﬂow). For additional information, refer to Horngren, Sundem, and Stratton (Management Accounting) and
Bodie and Merton (Finance) in Appendix F.

CHAPTER 7 / DEPRECIATION AND INCOME TAXES
Depreciation is a noncash cost that is intended to “match” the yearly fraction
of value used by an asset in the production of income over the asset’s life. The
actual amount of depreciation can never be established until the asset is retired
from service. Because depreciation is a noncash cost that affects income taxes, we
must consider it properly when making after-tax engineering economy studies.
Depreciable property is property for which depreciation is allowed under
federal, state, or municipal income tax laws and regulations. To determine whether
depreciation deductions can be taken, the classiﬁcation of various types of property
must be understood. In general, property is depreciable if it meets the following
basic requirements:
1. It must be used in business or held to produce income.
2. It must have a determinable useful life (deﬁned in Section 7.2.2), and the life
must be longer than one year.
3. It must be something that wears out, decays, gets used up, becomes obsolete,
or loses value from natural causes.
4. It is not inventory, stock in trade, or investment property.
Depreciable property is classiﬁed as either tangible or intangible. Tangible property
can be seen or touched, and it includes two main types called personal property
and real property. Personal property includes assets such as machinery, vehicles,
equipment, furniture, and similar items. In contrast, real property is land and
generally anything that is erected on, growing on, or attached to land. Land itself,
however, is not depreciable, because it does not have a determinable life.
Intangible property is personal property such as a copyright, patent, or
franchise. We will not discuss the depreciation of intangible assets in this chapter
because engineering projects rarely include this class of property.
A company can begin to depreciate property it owns when the property is
placed in service for use in the business and for the production of income. Property
is considered to be placed in service when it is ready and available for a speciﬁc
use, even if it is not actually used yet. Depreciation stops when the cost of placing
an asset in service has been recovered or when the asset is sold, whichever occurs
ﬁrst.
7.2.1
Depreciation Methods and Related Time Periods
The depreciation methods permitted under the Internal Revenue Code have
changedwithtime. Ingeneral, thefollowingsummaryindicatestheprimarymethods
used for property placed in service during three distinct time periods:
Before 1981
Several methods could be elected for depreciating property
placed in service before 1981. The primary methods used were Straight-Line (SL),
Declining-Balance (DB), and Sum of the Years Digits (SYD). We will refer to these
methods, collectively, as the classical, or historical, methods of depreciation.
After 1980 and before 1987
For federal income taxes, tangible property
placed in service during this period must be depreciated by using the Accelerated
Cost Recovery System (ACRS). This system was implemented by the Economic
Recovery Tax Act of 1981 (ERTA).

SECTION 7.2 / DEPRECIATION CONCEPTS AND TERMINOLOGY
311
After 1986 The Tax ReformAct of 1986 (TRA86) was one of the most extensive
income tax reforms in the history of the United States. This act modiﬁed the
previous ACRS implemented under ERTA and requires the use of the Modiﬁed
Accelerated Cost Recovery System (MACRS) for the depreciation of tangible
property placed in service after 1986.
Adescription of the selected (historical) methods of depreciation is included in
the chapter for several important reasons. They apply directly to property placed
in service prior to 1981, as well as for property, such as intangible property (which
requires the SL method), that does not qualify for ACRS or MACRS. Also, these
methods are often speciﬁed by the tax laws and regulations of state and municipal
governments in the United States and are used for depreciation purposes in other
countries. In addition, as we shall see in Section 7.4, the DB and the SL methods
are used in determining the annual recovery rates under MACRS.
We do not discuss the application of ACRS in the chapter, but readily available
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) publications describe its use.∗Selected parts of the
MACRS, however, are described and illustrated because this system applies to
depreciable property in present and future engineering projects.
7.2.2
Additional Deﬁnitions
Because this chapter uses many terms that are not generally included in the
vocabulary of engineering education and practice, an abbreviated set of deﬁnitions
is presented here. The following list is intended to supplement the previous deﬁni-
tions provided in this section:
Adjusted (cost) basis The original cost basis of the asset, adjusted by allowable
increases or decreases, is used to compute depreciation deductions. For example,
the cost of any improvement to a capital asset with a useful life greater than one
year increases the original cost basis, and a casualty or theft loss decreases it. If
the basis is altered, the depreciation deduction may need to be adjusted.
Basis or cost basis The initial cost of acquiring an asset (purchase price plus any
sales taxes), including transportation expenses and other normal costs of making
the asset serviceable for its intended use; this amount is also called the unadjusted
cost basis.
Book value (BV) The worth of a depreciable property as shown on the accounting
records of a company. It is the original cost basis of the property, including any
adjustments, less all allowable depreciation deductions. It thus represents the
amount of capital that remains invested in the property and must be recovered
in the future through the accounting process. The BV of a property may not be
an accurate measure of its market value. In general, the BV of a property at the
end of year k is

Market value (MV) The amount that will be paid by a willing buyer to a willing
sellerforaproperty, whereeachhasequaladvantageandisundernocompulsion
to buy or sell. The MV approximates the present value of what will be received
through ownership of the property, including the time value of money (or proﬁt).
Recovery period The number of years over which the basis of a property is
recovered through the accounting process. For the classical methods of depre-
ciation, this period is normally the useful life. Under MACRS, this period is the
property class for the General Depreciation System (GDS), and it is the class life
for the Alternative Depreciation System (ADS) (see Section 7.4).
Recovery rate A percentage (expressed in decimal form) for each year of the
MACRS recovery period that is utilized to compute an annual depreciation
deduction.
Salvage value (SV) The estimated value of a property at the end of its useful life.∗
It is the expected selling price of a property when the asset can no longer be used
productively by its owner. The term net salvage value is used when the owner
will incur expenses in disposing of the property, and these cash outﬂows must
be deducted from the cash inﬂows to obtain a ﬁnal net SV. Under MACRS, the
SV of a depreciable property is deﬁned to be zero.
Useful life The expected (estimated) period that a property will be used in a trade
or business to produce income. It is not how long the property will last but how
long the owner expects to productively use it.
7.3
The Classical (Historical) Depreciation Methods
This section describes and illustrates the SL and DB methods of calculating
depreciation deductions. As mentioned in Section 7.2, these historical methods
continue to apply, directly and indirectly, to the depreciation of property. Also
included is a discussion of the units of production method.
7.3.1
Straight-Line (SL) Method
SL depreciation is the simplest depreciation method. It assumes that a constant
amount is depreciated each year over the depreciable (useful) life of the asset. If
we deﬁne
N = depreciable life (recovery period) of the asset in years;
B = cost basis, including allowable adjustments;
dk = annual depreciation deduction in year k(1 ≤k ≤N);
BVk = book value at end of year k;
SVN = estimated salvage value at end of year N; and
d∗
k = cumulative depreciation through year k,
∗We often use the term market value (MV) in place of salvage value (SV).

SECTION 7.3 / THE CLASSICAL (HISTORICAL) DEPRECIATION METHODS
313
then
dk = (B −SVN)/N,
(7-2)
d∗
k = k · dk for 1 ≤k ≤N,
(7-3)
BVk = B −d∗
k.
(7-4)
Note that, for this method, you must have an estimate of the ﬁnal SV, which
will also be the ﬁnal BV at the end of year N. In some cases, the estimated SVN may
not equal an asset’s actual terminal MV.
EXAMPLE 7-1
SL Depreciation
A laser surgical tool has a cost basis of $200,000 and a ﬁve-year depreciable
life. The estimated SV of the laser is $20,000 at the end of ﬁve years. Determine
the annual depreciation amounts using the SL method. Tabulate the annual
depreciation amounts and the book value of the laser at the end of each year.
Solution
The depreciation amount, cumulative depreciation, and BV for each year are
obtained by applying Equations (7-2), (7-3), and (7-4). Sample calculations for
year three are as follows:
d3 = $200,000 −$20,000
5
= $36,000
d∗
3 = 3

= $108,000
BV3 = $200,000 −$108,000 = $92,000
The depreciation and BV amounts for each year are shown in the following table.

Note that the BV at the end of the depreciable life is equal to the SV used to
calculate the yearly depreciation amount.

CHAPTER 7 / DEPRECIATION AND INCOME TAXES
7.3.2
Declining-Balance (DB) Method
In the DB method, sometimes called the constant-percentage method or the Matheson
formula, it is assumed that the annual cost of depreciation is a ﬁxed percentage of
the BV at the beginning of the year. The ratio of the depreciation in any one year
to the BV at the beginning of the year is constant throughout the life of the asset
and is designated by R (0 ≤R ≤1). In this method, R = 2/N when a 200% DB is
being used (i.e., twice the SL rate of 1/N), and N equals the depreciable (useful)
life of an asset. If the 150% DB method is speciﬁed, then R = 1.5/N. The following
relationships hold true for the DB method:
d1 = B(R),
(7-5)
dk = B(1 −R)k−1(R),
(7-6)
d∗
k = B[1 −(1 −R)k],
(7-7)
BVk = B(1 −R)k.
(7-8)
Notice that Equations (7-5) through (7-8) do not contain a term for SVN.
EXAMPLE 7-2
DB Depreciation
A new electric saw for cutting small pieces of lumber in a furniture manufac-
turing plant has a cost basis of $4,000 and a 10-year depreciable life. The esti-
mated SV of the saw is zero at the end of 10 years. Use the DB method to calculate
the annual depreciation amounts when
(a) R = 2/N (200% DB method)
(b) R = 1.5/N (150% DB method).
Tabulate the annual depreciation amount and BV for each year.
Solution
Annual depreciation, cumulative depreciation, and BV are determined by using
Equations (7-6), (7-7), and (7-8), respectively. Sample calculations for year six
are as follows:
(a)
R = 2/10 = 0.2,
d6 = $4,000(1 −0.2)5(0.2) = $262.14,
d∗
6 = $4,000[1 −(1 −0.2)6] = $2,951.42,
BV6 = $4,000(1 −0.2)6 = $1,048.58.
(b)
R = 1.5/10 = 0.15,
d6 = $4,000(1 −0.15)5(0.15) = $266.22,

d∗
6 = $4,000[1 −(1 −0.15)6] = $2,491.40,

7.3.3
DB with Switchover to SL
Because the DB method never reaches a BV of zero, it is permissible to switch from
this method to the SL method so that an asset’s BVN will be zero (or some other
determined amount, such as SVN). Also, this method is used in calculating the
MACRS recovery rates (shown later in Table 7-3).
Table 7-1 illustrates a switchover from double DB depreciation to SL depre-
ciation for Example 7-2. The switchover occurs in the year in which an equal or
a larger depreciation amount is obtained from the SL method. From Table 7-1, it
is apparent that d6 = $262.14. The BV at the end of year six (BV6) is $1,048.58.
Additionally, observe that BV10 is $4,000−$3,570.50 = $429.50 without switchover
to the SL method in Table 7-1. With switchover, BV10 equals zero. It is clear that this
asset’s dk, d∗
k, and BVk in years 7 through 10 are established from the SL method,
which permits the full cost basis to be depreciated over the 10-year recovery period.
7.3.4
Units-of-Production Method
All the depreciation methods discussed to this point are based on elapsed time
(years) on the theory that the decrease in value of property is mainly a function
of time. When the decrease in value is mostly a function of use, depreciation may
be based on a method not expressed in terms of years. The units-of-production
method is normally used in this case.

This method results in the cost basis (minus ﬁnal SV) being allocated equally
over the estimated number of units produced during the useful life of the asset.
The depreciation rate is calculated as
Depreciation
per unit of production =
B −SVN
(Estimated lifetime production units).
(7-9)
EXAMPLE 7-3
Depreciation Based on Activity
A piece of equipment used in a business has a basis of $50,000 and is expected to
have a $10,000 SV when replaced after 30,000 hours of use. Find its depreciation
rate per hour of use, and ﬁnd its BV after 10,000 hours of operation.
Solution
Depreciation per unit of production = $50,000 −$10,000
30,000 hours
= $1.33 per hour.
After 10,000 hours, BV = $50,000 −$1.33
hour (10,000 hours), or BV = $36,700.

SECTION 7.4 / THE MODIFIED ACCELERATED COST RECOVERY SYSTEM 317
7.4
The Modiﬁed Accelerated Cost Recovery System
As we discussed in Section 7.2.1, the MACRS was created by TRA 86 and is
now the principal method for computing depreciation deductions for property in
engineering projects. MACRS applies to most tangible depreciable property placed
in service after December 31, 1986. Examples of assets that cannot be depreciated
under MACRS are property you elect to exclude because it is to be depreciated
under a method that is not based on a term of years (units-of-production method)
and intangible property. Previous depreciation methods have required estimates of
useful life (N) and SV at the end of useful life (SVN). Under MACRS, however, SVN
is deﬁned to be zero, and useful life estimates are not used directly in calculating
depreciation amounts.
MACRS consists of two systems for computing depreciation deductions. The
main system is called the General Depreciation System (GDS), and the second
system is called the Alternative Depreciation System (ADS).
In general, ADS provides a longer recovery period and uses only the SL
method of depreciation. Property that is placed in any tax-exempt use and property
used predominantly outside the United States are examples of assets that must be
depreciated under ADS. Any property that qualiﬁes under GDS, however, can be
depreciated under ADS, if elected.
When an asset is depreciated under MACRS, the following information is
needed before depreciation deductions can be calculated:
1. The cost basis (B)
2. The date the property was placed in service
3. The property class and recovery period
4. The MACRS depreciation method to be used (GDS or ADS)
5. The time convention that applies (half year)
The ﬁrst two items were discussed in Section 7.2. Items 3 through 5 are discussed
in the sections that follow.
7.4.1
Property Class and Recovery Period
Under MACRS, tangible depreciable property is categorized (organized) into asset
classes. The property in each asset class is then assigned a class life, GDS recovery
period (and property class), and ADS recovery period. For our use, a partial listing of
depreciableassetsusedinbusinessisprovidedinTable7-2. Thetypesofdepreciable
property grouped together are identiﬁed in the second column. Then the class life,
GDS recovery period (and property class), and ADS recovery period (all in years)
for these assets are listed in the remaining three columns.
Under the GDS, the basic information about property classes and recovery
periods is as follows:
1. Most tangible personal property is assigned to one of six personal property classes
(3-, 5-, 7-, 10-, 15-, and 20-year property). The personal property class (in years)
is the same as the GDS recovery period. Any depreciable personal property that

seven-year property class.
2. Real property is assigned to two real property classes: nonresidential real property
and residential rental property.
3. The GDS recovery period is 39 years for nonresidential real property (31.5 years if
placedinservicebefore May 13, 1993) and 27.5 years for residential real property.
The following is a summary of basic information for the ADS:
1. For tangible personal property, the ADS recovery period is shown in the last
column on the right of Table 7-2 (and is normally the same as the class life of the
property; there are exceptions such as those shown in asset classes 00.12 and
00.22).

SECTION 7.4 / THE MODIFIED ACCELERATED COST RECOVERY SYSTEM 319
2. Any tangible personal property that does not ﬁt into one of the asset classes is
depreciated under a 12-year ADS recovery period.
3. The ADS recovery period for nonresidential real property is 40 years.
The use of these rules under the MACRS is discussed further in the next section.
7.4.2
Depreciation Methods, Time Convention,
and Recovery Rates
The primary methods used under MACRS for calculating the depreciation
deductions over the recovery period of an asset are summarized as follows:
1. GDS 3-, 5-, 7-, and 10-year personal property classes: The 200% DB method,
which switches to the SL method when that method provides a greater dedu-
ction. The DB method with switchover to SL was illustrated in Section 7.3.3.
2. GDS 15- and 20-year personal property classes: The 150% DB method, which
switches to the SL method when that method provides a greater deduction.
3. GDS nonresidential real and residential rental property classes: The SL method
over the ﬁxed GDS recovery periods.
4. ADS: The SL method for both personal and real property over the ﬁxed ADS
recovery periods.
A half-year time convention is used in MACRS depreciation calculations for
tangible personal property. This means that all assets placed in service during
the year are treated as if use began in the middle of the year, and one-half year of
depreciation is allowed. When an asset is disposed of, the half-year convention is
also allowed. If the asset is disposed of before the full recovery period is used, then only
half of the normal depreciation deduction can be taken for that year.
The GDS recovery rates (rk) for the six personal property classes that we will use
in our depreciation calculations are listed in Table 7-3. The GDS personal property
rates in Table 7-3 include the half-year convention, as well as switchover from the
DB method to the SLmethod when that method provides a greater deduction. Note
that, if an asset is disposed of in year N, the ﬁnal BV of the asset will be zero.
The depreciation deduction (dk) for an asset under MACRS (GDS) is com-
puted with
dk = rk·B; 1 ≤k ≤N,
(7-10)
where rk = recovery rate for year k from Table 7-3.
The information in Table 7-4 provides a summary of the principal features of
GDS under MACRS. Included are some selected special rules about depreciable
assets. A ﬂow diagram for computing depreciation deductions under MACRS is
shown in Figure 7-1. As indicated in the ﬁgure, an important choice is whether the
main GDS is to be used for an asset or whether ADS is elected instead (or required).
Normally, the choice would be to use the GDS for calculating the depreciation
deductions.

Solution
From Table 7-2, it may be seen that the semiconductor (electronic) manufacturing
equipment has a class life of six years and a GDS recovery period of ﬁve years.
The recovery rates that apply are given in Table 7-3.
(a) The depreciation deduction, or cost-recovery allowance, that is allowable in
year four (d4) is 0.1152 ($100,000) = $11,520.

SECTION 7.4 / THE MODIFIED ACCELERATED COST RECOVERY SYSTEM 323
EXAMPLE 7-5
MACRS with a Trade-in
In May 2011, your company traded in a computer and peripheral equipment,
used in its business, that had a BV at that time of $25,000. Anew, faster computer
system having a fair MV of $400,000 was acquired. Because the vendor accepted
the older computer as a trade-in, a deal was agreed to whereby your company
would pay $325,000 cash for the new computer system.
(a) What is the GDS property class of the new computer system?
(b) How much depreciation can be deducted each year based on this class life?
(Refer to Figure 7-1.)
Solution
(a) The new computer is in Asset Class 00.12 and has a class life of six years.
(See Table 7-2.) Hence, its GDS property class and recovery period are ﬁve
years.
(b) The cost basis for this property is $350,000, which is the sum of the $325,000
cash price of the computer and the $25,000 BV remaining on the trade-in.
(In this case, the trade-in was treated as a nontaxable transaction.)
MACRS (GDS) rates that apply to the $350,000 cost basis are found in
Table 7-3. An allowance (half-year) is built into the year-one rate, so it does not
matter that the computer was purchased in May 2011 instead of, say, November
2011. The depreciation deductions (dk) for 2011 through 2016 are computed using
Equation (7-10) and Table 7-3.

CHAPTER 7 / DEPRECIATION AND INCOME TAXES
To illustrate Equation (7-11), suppose your company has operated an optical
character recognition (OCR) scanner for two years. Its BV now is $35,000, and
its fair MV is $45,000. The company is considering a new OCR scanner that costs
$105,000. Ordinarily, you would trade the old scanner for the new one and pay the
dealer $60,000. The basis (B) for depreciation is then $60,000 + $35,000 = $95,000.∗
EXAMPLE 7-6
MACRS Depreciation with ADS
A large manufacturer of sheet metal products in the Midwest purchased and
placed in service a new, modern, computer-controlled ﬂexible manufacturing
system for $3.0 million. Because this company would not be proﬁtable until
the new technology had been in place for several years, it elected to utilize
the ADS under MACRS in computing its depreciation deductions. Thus, the
company could slow down its depreciation allowances in hopes of postponing
itsincometaxadvantagesuntilitbecameaproﬁtableconcern. Whatdepreciation
deductions can be claimed for the new system?
Solution
From Table 7-2, the ADS recovery period for a manufacturer of fabricated metal
products is 12 years. Under ADS, the SL method with no SV is applied to
the 12-year recovery period, using the half-year convention. Consequently, the
depreciation in year one would be
1
2

= $125,000.
Depreciation deductions in years 2 through 12 would be $250,000 each
year, and depreciation in year 13 would be $125,000. Notice how the half-year
convention extends depreciation deductions over 13 years (N + 1).
7.4.3
MACRS Spreadsheet
We have used electronic spreadsheets to perform complex calculations, repetitive
calculations, and to evaluate the accuracy of the estimation process. Spreadsheets
can also assist in understanding complex relationships. In this section, we seek a
better understanding of the GDS recovery rates in Table 7-3.
There is an inherent danger in taking tabulated values at face value in any
analysis. Recall that the GDS values incorporate the half-year convention, declining
balance and straight-line depreciation, as well as a switch from one method to the
other. Electronic spreadsheets provide a framework to explore and understand
these relationships without getting bogged down with calculations.
A spreadsheet for determining the GDS recovery rate for a 5-year class life is
shown in Figure 7-2. There are three user input cells: B3 for the declining balance
percentage, B4 for the class life, and E9, which is one. This last entry allows us
∗The exchange price of the OCR scanner is $105,000−$45,000(= actual cash cost). Equation (7-11) prevents exaggerated
cost bases to be claimed for new assets having large “sticker prices” compared with their exchange price.

CHAPTER 7 / DEPRECIATION AND INCOME TAXES
to calculate rates, rather than a depreciation amount. Cell B5 is an intermediate
calculation for R, which used in subsequent declining balance calculations.
The consequence of the half-year convention is seen in columns A and B.
Column A has 6 years, rather than 5, and cell B10 adds a half-year to the remaining
life. Cell B10 is copied down to row 15.
Column C contains the straight-line depreciation calculations. The standard
depreciation equation is in cell C11 and is the ratio of the remaining book value
percent in column E divided by the remaining life from column B. Because the
declining balance depreciation amount is larger in the earlier years, we cannot use
the simpliﬁed straight-line depreciation approach in Equation (7-2). Cells C10 and
C15 compensate for the half-year convention by taking only half of the calculated
amount.
The declining balance calculations are in column D. The standard depreciation
equation is in cell D11, which is copied down to cell D14. As in column C,
adjustments are necessary in D10 and D15 to adjust for the half-year convention.
The year end book value percent calculation is in cell E10:
= E9 −MAXA(C10:D10)
This equation takes the percent of remaining book value at the start of the year and
subtracts the maximum depreciation from column C and D for the current year.
This result is used by columns C and D to determine the depreciation percentage
in the following year.
The ﬁnal GDS recovery rate equation in F10 is:
= MAXA(D10,C10)
This is the switchover component of the method. Cell F17 is a check to ensure that
the proportions sum to unity.
To emphasize when the switch takes place, cell G10 has an equation that labels
the switch year.
= IF(C10 >= D10, “Switch to S-L”,””)
This model has allowed us to fully examine how the GDS rates are determined.
Having all intermediate results displayed, as well as the check sum in F17, permits
one to quickly identify errors in logic to speed the learning process. The equations
are general enough to be applied to the remaining property classes by extending
or contracting the number of rows. Just be sure that the ﬁnal row in columns C and
D have the half-year corrections in the equations.
7.5
A Comprehensive Depreciation Example
We now consider an asset for which depreciation is computed by the historical
and MACRS (GDS) methods previously discussed. Be careful to observe the
differences in the mechanics of each method, as well as the differences in the annual
depreciation amounts themselves. Also, we compare the present worths (PWs) at
k = 0 of selected depreciation methods when MARR = 10% per year. As we shall
see later in this chapter, depreciation methods that result in larger PWs (of the
depreciation amounts) are preferred by a ﬁrm that wants to reduce the present
worth of its income taxes paid to the government.

SECTION 7.5 / A COMPREHENSIVE DEPRECIATION EXAMPLE 327
EXAMPLE 7-7
Comparison of Depreciation Methods
The La Salle Bus Company has decided to purchase a new bus for $85,000 with
a trade-in of their old bus. The old bus has a BV of $10,000 at the time of the
trade-in. The new bus will be kept for 10 years before being sold. Its estimated
SV at that time is expected to be $5,000.
First, we must calculate the cost basis. The basis is the original purchase price
of the bus plus the BV of the old bus that was traded in [Equation (7-11)]. Thus,
the basis is $85,000 + $10,000, or $95,000. We need to look at Table 7-2 and ﬁnd
buses, which are asset class 00.23. Hence, we ﬁnd that buses have a nine-year
class recovery period, over which we depreciate the bus with historical methods
discussed in Section 7.3, and a ﬁve-year GDS class life.
Solution: SL Method
For the SL method, we use the class life of 9 years, even though the bus will be
kept for 10 years. By using Equations (7-2) and (7-4), we obtain the following
information:
dk = $95,000 −$5,000

Notice that no depreciation was taken after year nine because the class life
was only nine years. Also, the ﬁnal BV was the estimated SV, and the BV will
remain at $5,000 until the bus is sold.
Solution: DB Method
To demonstrate this method, we will use the 200% DB equations. With Equations
(7-6) and (7-8), we calculate the following:
R = 2/9 = 0.2222;
d1 = $95,000(0.2222) = $21,111;

CHAPTER 7 / DEPRECIATION AND INCOME TAXES

Solution: DB with Switchover to SL Depreciation
To illustrate the mechanics of Table 7-1 for this example, we ﬁrst specify that the
bus will be depreciated by the 200% DB method (R = 2/N). Because DB methods
never reach a zero BV, suppose that we further specify that a switchover to SL
depreciation will be made to ensure a BV of $5,000 at the end of the vehicle’s
nine-year class life.

Notice that, when we sold the bus in year ﬁve before the recovery period had
ended, we took only half of the normal depreciation. The other years (years
one through four) were not changed. When the bus was sold in year six, at
the end of the recovery period, we did not divide the last year amount by
two.
Selected methods of depreciation, illustrated in Example 7-7, are compared
in Figure 7-3. In addition, the PW (10%) of each method is shown in
Figure 7-3. Because large PWs of depreciation deductions are generally viewed
as desirable, it is clear that the MACRS method is very attractive to proﬁtable
companies.

Introduction to Income Taxes
Up to this point, there has been no consideration of income taxes in our discussion
of engineering economy, except for the inﬂuence of depreciation and other
types of deductions. By not complicating our studies with income tax effects,
we have placed primary emphasis on basic engineering economy principles and
methodology. There, however, is a wide variety of capital investment problems in
which income taxes do affect the choice among alternatives, and after-tax studies
are essential.∗
In the remainder of this chapter, we shall be concerned with how income taxes
affect a project’s estimated cash ﬂows. Income taxes resulting from the proﬁtable
operationofaﬁrmareusuallytakenintoaccountinevaluatingengineeringprojects.
The reason is quite simple: Income taxes associated with a proposed project may
represent a major cash outﬂow that should be considered together with other cash
inﬂows and outﬂows in assessing the overall economic proﬁtability of that project.
There are other taxes discussed in Section 7.6.1 that are not directly associated
with the income-producing capability of a new project, but they are usually
∗Some U.S. ﬁrms do not pay income taxes, but this is not a valid reason for ignoring income taxes. We assume that
most ﬁrms have a positive taxable income in their overall operations.

SECTION 7.6 / INTRODUCTION TO INCOME TAXES 331
negligible when compared with federal and state income taxes. When other types
of taxes are included in engineering economy studies, they are normally deducted from
revenue, as any other operating expense would be, in determining the before-tax cash ﬂow
(BTCF) that we considered in Chapters 5 and 6.
The mystery behind the sometimes complex computation of income taxes is
reduced when we recognize that income taxes paid are just another type of expense,
and income taxes saved (through depreciation, expenses, and direct tax credits)
are identical to other kinds of reduced expenses (e.g., savings in maintenance
expenses).
The basic concepts underlying federal and state income tax laws and regu-
lations that apply to most economic analyses of capital investments generally can
be understood and applied without difﬁculty. This discussion of income taxes is
not intended to be a comprehensive treatment of the subject. Rather, we utilize
some of the more important provisions of the federal Tax Reform Act of 1986
(TRA 86), followed by illustrations of a general procedure for computing the
net ATCF for an engineering project and conducting after-tax economic analyses.
Where appropriate, important changes to TRA 86 enacted by the Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA 93) and the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 are also
included in this chapter.
7.6.1
Distinctions between Different Types of Taxes
Before discussing the consequences of income taxes in engineering economy
studies, we need to distinguish between income taxes and several other types
of taxes:
1. Income taxes are assessed as a function of gross revenues minus allowable
deductions. They are levied by the federal, most state, and occasionally
municipal governments.
2. Property taxes are assessed as a function of the value of property owned, such as
land, buildings, equipment, and so on, and the applicable tax rates. Hence, they
are independent of the income or proﬁt of a ﬁrm. They are levied by municipal,
county, or state governments.
3. Sales taxes are assessed on the basis of purchases of goods or services and
are thus independent of gross income or proﬁts. They are normally levied by
state, municipal, or county governments. Sales taxes are relevant in engineering
economy studies only to the extent that they add to the cost of items purchased.
4. Excise taxes are federal taxes assessed as a function of the sale of certain
goods or services often considered nonnecessities and are hence independent
of the income or proﬁt of a business. Although they are usually charged to
the manufacturer or original provider of the goods or services, a portion of the
cost is passed on to the purchaser.
7.6.2
The Before-Tax and After-Tax Minimum Attractive
Rates of Return
In the preceding chapters, we have treated income taxes as if they are not applicable,
or we have taken them into account, in general, by using a before-tax MARR,

332
CHAPTER 7 / DEPRECIATION AND INCOME TAXES
which is larger than the after-tax MARR.An approximation of the before-tax MARR
requirement, which includes the effect of income taxes, for studies involving only
BTCF can be obtained from the following relationship:
(Before-tax MARR)[(1 −Effective income tax rate)] ∼= After-tax MARR.
Thus,
Before-tax MARR ≈
After-tax MARR
(1 −Effective income tax rate).
(7-12)
Determining the effective income tax rate for a ﬁrm is discussed in Section 7.7.
This approximation is exact if the asset is nondepreciable and there are no
gains or losses on disposal, tax credits, or other types of deductions involved.
Otherwise, these factors affect the amount and timing of income tax payments,
and some degree of error is introduced into the relationship in Equation (7-12).
7.6.3
The Interest Rate to Use in After-Tax Studies
Any practical deﬁnition of a MARR should serve as a guide for investment policy
to attain the goals toward which a ﬁrm is, or will be, striving. One obvious goal is to
meet shareholder expectations. Clearly, long-term goals and capital structure will
be changing as a ﬁrm matures. In this regard, it is widely accepted that in after-
tax engineering economy studies, the MARR should be at least the tax-adjusted
weighted average cost of capital (WACC):
WACC = λ(1 −t)ib + (1 −λ)ea.
(7-13)
Here,
λ = fraction of a ﬁrm’s pool of capital that is borrowed from lenders,
t = effective income tax rate as a decimal,
ib = before-tax interest paid on borrowed capital,
ea = after-tax cost of equity capital.
The adjustment on the borrowed capital component of WACC, (1 −t)ib, accounts
for the fact that interest on borrowed capital is tax deductible.
Often a value higher than the WACC is assigned to the after-tax MARR to
reﬂect the opportunity cost of capital, perceived risk and uncertainty of projects
being evaluated, and policy issues such as organizational growth and shareholder
satisfaction. We are now in a position to understand how a ﬁrm’s after-tax MARR is
determined and why its value may change substantially over time. To summarize,
suppose a ﬁrms’ WACC is 10% per year. The after-tax MARR may be set at 15%
per year to better reﬂect the business opportunities that are available for capital
investment. If the ﬁrm’s effective income tax rate is 40%, the approximate value of
the before-tax MARR is 15%/(1 −0.4) = 25% per year.
7.6.4
Taxable Income of Corporations (Business Firms)
At the end of each tax year, a corporation must calculate its net (i.e., taxable)
before-tax income or loss. Several steps are involved in this process, beginning
with the calculation of gross income. The corporation may deduct from gross
income all ordinary and necessary operating expenses to conduct the business
except capital investments. Deductions for depreciation are permitted each tax

SECTION 7.7 / THE EFFECTIVE (MARGINAL) CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATE 333
period as a means of consistently and systematically recovering capital investment.
Consequently, allowable expenses and deductions may be used to determine
taxable income:
Taxable income = Gross income −All expenses except capital investments
−Depreciation deductions.
(7-14)
EXAMPLE 7-8
Determination of Taxable Income
A company generates $1,500,000 of gross income during its tax year and incurs
operating expenses of $800,000. Property taxes on business assets amount to
$48,000. The total depreciation deductions for the tax year equal $114,000. What
is the taxable income of this ﬁrm?
Solution
Based on Equation (7-14), this company’s taxable income for the tax year
would be
$1,500,000 −$800,000 −$48,000 −$114,000 = $538,000.
7.7
The Effective (Marginal) Corporate
Income Tax Rate
The federal corporate income tax rate structure in 2006 is shown in Table 7-5.
Depending on the taxable income bracket that a ﬁrm is in for a tax year, the
marginal federal rate can vary from 15% to a maximum of 39%. Note, however,
that the weighted average tax rate at taxable income = $335,000 is 34%, and the
weighted average tax rate at taxable income = $18,333,333 is 35%. Therefore, if
a corporation has a taxable income for a tax year greater than $18,333,333, federal
taxes are computed by using a ﬂat rate of 35%.

CHAPTER 7 / DEPRECIATION AND INCOME TAXES
EXAMPLE 7-9
Calculating Income Taxes
Suppose that a ﬁrm for a tax year has a gross income of $5,270,000, expenses
(excluding capital) of $2,927,500, and depreciation deductions of $1,874,300.
What would be its taxable income and federal income tax for the tax year, based
on Equation (7-14) and Table 7-5?

Taxable income = Gross income −Expenses −Depreciation deductions
= $5,270,000 −$2,927,500 −$1,874,300

$159,188
The total tax liability in this case is $159,188. As an added note, we could have
used a ﬂat rate of 34% in this example because the federal weighted average tax
rate at taxable income = $335,000 is 34%. The remaining $133,200 of taxable
income above this amount is in a 34% tax bracket (Table 7-5). So we have
0.34($468,200) = $159,188.
Although the tax laws and regulations of most of the states (and some
municipalities) with income taxes have the same basic features as the federal laws
and regulations, there is signiﬁcant variation in income tax rates. State income taxes
areinmostcasesmuchlessthanfederaltaxesandoftencanbecloselyapproximated
as ranging from 6% to 12% of taxable income. No attempt will be made here to
discuss the details of state income taxes. To illustrate the calculation of an effective
income tax rate (t) for a large corporation based on the consideration of both federal
and state income taxes, however, assume that the applicable federal income tax
rate is 35% and the state income tax rate is 8%. Further assume the common case in
which taxable income is computed the same way for both types of taxes, except that
state income taxes are deductible from taxable income for federal tax purposes, but
federal income taxes are not deductible from taxable income for state tax purposes.
Based on these assumptions, the general expression for the effective income tax
rate is
t = State rate + Federal rate(1 −State rate), or
(7-15)
t = Federal rate + (1 −Federal rate)(State rate).

The Federal Income Tax Rates for Corporations (Table 7-5) with Incremental
Income Tax for a Proposed Project (assumes, in this case, corporate taxable income without
project > $18,333,333)
In this example, the effective income tax rate for the corporation would be
t = 0.08 + 0.35(1 −0.08) = 0.402, or approximately 40%.
In this chapter, we will often use an effective corporate income tax rate of
approximately 40% as a representative value that includes state income taxes.
The effective income tax rate on increments of taxable income is of importance in
engineering economy studies. This concept is illustrated in Figure 7-4, which plots
the federal income tax rates and brackets listed in Table 7-5 and shows the added
(incremental) taxable income and federal income taxes that would result from a
proposed engineering project (shaded in Figure 7-4). In this case, the corporation
is assumed to have a taxable income greater than $18,333,333 for their tax year. The
same concept, however, applies to a smaller ﬁrm with less taxable income for its
tax year, which is illustrated in Example 7-10.
EXAMPLE 7-10
Project-Based Income Taxes
A small corporation is expecting an annual taxable income of $45,000 for its
tax year. It is considering an additional capital investment of $100,000 in an
engineering project, which is expected to create an added annual net cash

The increased income tax liability from the investment is $10,000 −$6,750 =
$3,250.
As an added note, the change in tax liability can usually be determined
more readily by an incremental approach. For instance, this example involved
changing the taxable income from $45,000 to $60,000 as a result of the new
investment. Thus, the change in income taxes for the tax year could be calculated
as follows:
First $50,000 −$45,000 = $5,000 at 15% =
$750
Next $60,000 −$50,000 = $10,000 at 25% = 2,500
Total
$3,250
The average federal income tax rate on the additional $35,000 −$20,000 =
$15,000 of taxable income is calculated as ($3,250/$15,000) = 0.2167, or 21.67%.
7.8
Gain (Loss) on the Disposal of an Asset
When a depreciable asset (tangible personal or real property, Section 7.2) is sold, the
MV is seldom equal to its BV [Equation (7-1)]. In general, the gain (loss) on sale
of depreciable property is the fair market value minus its book value at that time.
That is,
[Gain (loss) on disposal]N = MVN −BVN.
(7-17)

SECTION 7.9 / GENERAL PROCEDURE FOR MAKING AFTER-TAX ECONOMIC ANALYSES
337
When the sale results in a gain, it is often referred to as depreciation recapture. The
tax rate for the gain (loss) on disposal of depreciable personal property is usually
the same as for ordinary income or loss, which is the effective income tax rate, t.
When a capital asset is sold or exchanged, the gain (loss) is referred to as a capital
gain (loss). Examples of capital assets are stocks, bonds, gold, silver, and other
metals, as well as real property such as a home. Because engineering economic
analysis seldom involves an actual capital gain (loss), the more complex details of
this situation are not discussed further.
EXAMPLE 7-11
Tax Consequences of Selling an Asset
A corporation sold a piece of equipment during the current tax year for
$78,600. The accounting records show that its cost basis, B, is $190,000 and the
accumulated depreciation is $139,200. Assume that the effective income tax rate
as a decimal is 0.40 (40%). Based on this information, what is
(a) the gain (loss) on disposal,
(b) the tax liability (or credit) resulting from this sale,
(c) the tax liability (or credit) if the accumulated depreciation was $92,400
instead of $139,200?
Solution
(a) The BV at the time of sale is $190,000 −$139,200 = $50,800. Therefore, the
gain on disposal is $78,600 −$50,800 = $27,800.
(b) The tax owed on this gain is −0.40($27,800) = −$11,120.
(c) With d∗
k = $92,400, the BV at the time of sale is $190,000−$92,400 = $97,600.
The loss is $78,600 −$97,600 = −$19,000. The tax credit resulting from this
loss on disposal is −0.40(−$19,000) = $7,600.
7.9
General Procedure for Making
After-Tax Economic Analyses
After-tax economic analyses utilize the same proﬁtability measures as do before-
tax analyses. The only difference is that ATCFs are used in place of before-tax
cash ﬂows (BTCFs) by including expenses (or savings) to income taxes and then
making equivalent worth calculations using an after-tax MARR. The tax rates and
governing regulations may be complex and subject to changes, but, once those rates
and regulations have been translated into their effect on ATCFs, the remainder of
the after-tax analysis is relatively straightforward. To formalize the procedure, let
Rk = revenues (and savings) from the project (this is the cash inﬂow from
the project during period k);
Ek = cash outﬂows during year k for deductible expenses;

338
CHAPTER 7 / DEPRECIATION AND INCOME TAXES
dk = sum of all noncash, or book, costs during year k, such as depreciation;
t = effective income tax rate on ordinary income (federal, state, and other),
with t assumed to remain constant during the study period;
Tk = income tax consequences during year k;
ATCFk = ATCF from the project during year k.
Because the taxable income is (Rk −Ek −dk), the ordinary income tax consequences
during year k are computed with Equation (7-18):
Tk = −t(Rk −Ek −dk).
(7-18)
Therefore, when Rk > (Ek + dk), a tax liability (i.e., negative cash ﬂow) occurs.
When Rk < (Ek + dk), a decrease in the tax amount (a credit) occurs.
In the economic analyses of engineering projects, ATCFs in year k can be
computed in terms of BTCFk (i.e., BTCF in year k):
BTCFk = Rk −Ek.
(7-19)
Thus,∗
ATCFk = BTCFk + Tk
(7-20)
= (Rk −Ek) −t(Rk −Ek −dk)
= (1 −t)(Rk −Ek) + tdk.
(7-21)
Equation (7-21) shows that after income taxes, a revenue becomes (1 −t)Rk and an
expense becomes (1 −t)Ek. Note that the ATCF attributable to depreciation (a tax
savings) is tdk in year k.
Tabular headings to facilitate the computation of ATCFs using Equations (7-18)
and (7-21) are as follows:

Column A consists of the same information used in before-tax analyses, namely
the cash revenues (or savings) less the deductible expenses. Column B contains
depreciation that can be claimed for tax purposes. Column C is the taxable income
or the amount subject to income taxes. Column D contains the income taxes paid (or
saved). Finally, column E shows theATCFs to be used directly in after-tax economic
analyses.
Anote of caution concerning the deﬁnition of BTCFs (andATCFs) for projects is
in order at this point. BTCF is deﬁned to be annual revenue (or savings) attributable
to a project minus its annual cash expenses. These expenses should not include
interest and other ﬁnancial cash ﬂows. The reason is that project cash ﬂows should
be analyzed separately from ﬁnancial cash ﬂows. Including interest expense with
project cash ﬂows is incorrect when the ﬁrm’s pool of capital is being used to
∗In Figure 7-5, we use −t in column D, so algebraic subtraction of income taxes in Equation (7-20) is accomplished.

General Format (Worksheet) for After-Tax Analysis; Determining the ATCF
undertake an engineering project. Why? A ﬁrm’s pool of capital consists of debt
capital and equity capital. Because the MARR typically uses the weighted average
cost of capital as its lower limit, discounting at the MARR for investments from the
pool of capital takes account of the cost of debt capital (interest). Thus, there is no
need to subtract interest expense in determining BTCFs—to do so would amount
to double counting the interest expense associated with debt capital.
A summary of the process of determining ATCF during each year of an N-year
study period is provided in Figure 7-5. The format of Figure 7-5 is used extensively
throughout the remainder of this chapter, and it provides a convenient way to
organize data in after-tax studies.
The column headings of Figure 7-5 indicate the arithmetic operations for
computing columns C, D, and E when k = 1, 2, . . . , N. When k = 0, capital
investments are usually involved, and their tax treatment (if any) is illustrated
in the examples that follow. The table should be used with the conventions of +
for cash inﬂow or savings and −for cash outﬂow or opportunity forgone.

If the ﬁrm’s effective income tax rate remains constant at 40% during this six-

when MARR = 10% per year (after taxes)?

The PW of tax credits (savings) because of this depreciation schedule is

EXAMPLE 7-13
After-Tax PW of an Asset
The asset in Example 7-12 is expected to produce net cash inﬂows (net revenues)
of $30,000 per year during the six-year period, and its terminal MV is negligible.
If the effective income tax rate is 40%, how much can a ﬁrm afford to spend
for this asset and still earn the MARR? What is the meaning of any excess in
affordable amount over the $100,000 cost basis given in Example 7-12? [Equals
the after tax PW.]
Solution
After income taxes, the PW of net revenues is (1 −0.4)($30,000)(P/A, 10%, 6) =
$18,000(4.3553) = $78,395. After adding to this the PW of tax savings computed
in Example 7-12, the affordable amount is $107,343. Because the capital
investment is $100,000, the net PW equals $7,343. This same result can be
obtained by using the general format (worksheet) of Figure 7-5:

EXAMPLE 7-14
PennCo Electric Utility Company
Here we refer back to the chapter opener where the question of the after-tax
cost of electricity production was raised. For the PennCo plant, the annual fuel
expense† will be $191,346,432 per year. The operating and maintenance expense
will be $112,128,000 per year, and the carbon tax will be $73,805,052 per year.
The total annual expense of operating the plant will therefore be $377,279,484.
Armed with these cost estimates, we can calculate the after-tax cost of the plant
by using the template of Figure 7-5 (all numbers are millions of dollars).

calculate the after-tax cost of a kilowatt-hour by dividing this number
($330,266,000) by the electrical output of 5,606,400,000 kWh. It is close to $0.06
per kWh.
† The details of the annual expense calculations are left as a student exercise in Problem 7-60.
7.10
Illustration of Computations of ATCFs
The following problems (Examples 7-15 through 7-19) illustrate the computation of
ATCFs, as well as many common situations that affect income taxes. All problems
include the assumption that income tax expenses (or savings) occur at the same
time (year) as the revenue or expense that gives rise to the taxes. For purposes of
comparing the effects of various situations, the after-tax IRR or PW is computed
for each example. We can observe from the results of Examples 7-15, 7-16, and 7-17
that the faster (i.e., earlier) the depreciation deduction is, the more favorable the
after-tax IRR and PW will become.
EXAMPLE 7-15
Computing After-Tax PW and IRR
Certain new machinery, when placed in service, is estimated to cost $180,000.
It is expected to reduce net annual operating expenses by $36,000 per year for
10 years and to have a $30,000 MV at the end of the 10th year.
(a) Develop the ATCFs and BTCFs.
(b) Calculate the before-tax and after-tax IRR. Assume that the ﬁrm is in the
federal taxable income bracket of $335,000 to $10,000,000 and that the state

342
CHAPTER 7 / DEPRECIATION AND INCOME TAXES
income tax rate is 6%. State income taxes are deductible from federal taxable
income. This machinery is in the MACRS (GDS) ﬁve-year property class.
(c) Calculate the after-tax PW when the after-tax MARR = 10% per year.
In this example, the study period is 10 years, but the property class of the
machinery is 5 years. Solve by hand and by spreadsheet.
Solution by Hand
(a) Table 7-6 applies the format illustrated in Figure 7-5 to calculate the BTCF
andATCF for this example. In column D, the effective income tax rate is very
close to 0.38 [from Equation (7-15)] based on the information just provided.
(b) The before-tax IRR is computed from column A:
0 = −$180,000 + $36,000(P/A, i′%, 10) + $30,000(P/F, i′%, 10).
By trial and error, we ﬁnd that i′ = 16.1%.
The entry in the last year is shown to be $30,000 because the machinery
will have this estimated MV. The asset, however, was depreciated to zero
with the GDS method. Therefore, when the machine is sold at the end of
year 10, there will be $30,000 of recaptured depreciation, or gain on disposal
[Equation (7-16)], which is taxed at the effective income tax rate of 38%. This
tax entry is shown in column D (EOY 10).
By trial and error, the after-tax IRR for Example 7-15 is found to be 12.4%.
(c) When MARR = 10% per year is inserted into the PW equation at the bottom
of Table 7-6, it can be determined that the after-tax PW of this investment is
$17,208.
Spreadsheet Solution
Figure 7-6 displays the spreadsheet solution for Example 7-15. This spreadsheet
uses the form given in Figure 7-5 to compute the ATCFs. The spreadsheet also
illustrates the use of the VDB (variable declining balance) function to compute
MACRS (GDS) depreciation amounts.
Cell B9 contains the cost basis, cells B10:B19 contain the BTCFs, and the
year 10 MV is given in cell B20. The VDB function is used to determine the
MACRS (GDS) depreciation amounts in column C. Cell B7 contains the DB
percentage used for a ﬁve-year property class (see Table 7-4).
Note that in Figure 7-6, there are two row entries for the last year of the study
period (year 10). The ﬁrst entry accounts for expected revenues less expenses,
while the second entry accounts for the disposal of the asset. To use the NPV
and IRR ﬁnancial functions, these values must be combined into a net cash ﬂow
for the year. This is accomplished by the adjusted ATCF and adjusted BTCF
columns in the spreadsheet.

345
In Example 7-16, we demonstrate the impact of a longer depreciation schedule
on the after-tax proﬁtability of an investment.
EXAMPLE 7-16
Impact of a Longer Depreciation Schedule on After-Tax PW and IRR
Suppose the machinery in Example 7-15 had been classiﬁed in the 10-year
MACRS (GDS) property class. Calculate the new after-tax PW and after-tax IRR.
Why are these results different than the results of Example 7-15?
Solution
If the machinery in Example 7-15 had been classiﬁed in the 10-year MACRS
(GDS) property class instead of the ﬁve-year property class, depreciation
deductions would be slowed down in the early years of the study period and
shiftedintolateryears, asshowninTable7-7. ComparedwithentriesinTable 7-6,
entries in columns C, D, and E of Table 7-7 are less favorable, in the sense that
a fair amount of ATCF is deferred until later years, producing a lower after-tax
PW and IRR. For instance, the PW is reduced from $17,208 in Table 7-6 to $9,136
in Table 7-7. The basic difference between Table 7-6 and Table 7-7 is the timing of
the ATCF, which is a function of the timing and magnitude of the depreciation
deductions. In fact, the curious reader can conﬁrm that the sums of entries in
columns A through E of Tables 7-6 and 7-7 are nearly the same (except for the
half-year of depreciation only in year 10 of Table 7-7). The timing of cash ﬂows
does, of course, make a difference!
Depreciation does not affect BTCF. Fast (accelerated) depreciation produces a
larger PW of tax savings than does the same amount of depreciation claimed
later in an asset’s life.
A minor complication is introduced in ATCF analyses when the study period
is shorter than an asset’s MACRS recovery period (e.g., for a ﬁve-year recovery
period, the study period is ﬁve years or less). In such cases, we shall assume
throughout this book that the asset is sold for its MV in the last year of the study
period. Due to the half-year convention, only one-half of the normal MACRS
depreciation can be claimed in the year of disposal or end of the study period,
so there will usually be a difference between an asset’s BV and its MV. Resulting
income tax adjustments will be made at the time of the sale (see the last row in
Table 7-7) unless the asset in question is not sold but instead kept for standby
service. In such a case, depreciation deductions usually continue through the end
of the asset’s MACRS recovery period. Our assumption of project termination
at the end of the study period makes good economic sense, as illustrated in
Example 7-17.

EXAMPLE 7-17
Study Period < MACRS Recovery Period
A highly specialized piece of equipment has a ﬁrst cost of $50,000. If this
equipment is purchased, it will be used to produce income (through rental)
of $20,000 per year for only four years. At the end of year four, the equipment
will be sold for a negligible amount. Estimated annual expenses for upkeep are
$3,000 during each of the four years. The MACRS (GDS) recovery period for the
equipment is seven years, and the ﬁrm’s effective income tax rate is 40%.
(a) If the after-tax MARR is 7% per year, should the equipment be purchased?

CHAPTER 7 / DEPRECIATION AND INCOME TAXES
The PW is $673 higher in Part (a), which equals the PW of deferred
depreciation deductions in Part (b). A ﬁrm would select the situation in Part
(a) if it had a choice.
An illustration of determining ATCFs for a somewhat more complex, though
realistic, capital investment opportunity is provided in Example 7-18.
EXAMPLE 7-18
After-Tax Analysis of an Integrated Circuit Production Line
The Ajax Semiconductor Company is attempting to evaluate the proﬁtability of
adding another integrated circuit production line to its present operations. The
company would need to purchase two or more acres of land for $275,000 (total).
The facility would cost $60,000,000 and have no net MV at the end of ﬁve years.
The facility could be depreciated using a GDS recovery period of ﬁve years. An
increment of working capital would be required, and its estimated amount is
$10,000,000. Gross income is expected to increase by $30,000,000 per year for ﬁve
years, and operating expenses are estimated to be $8,000,000 per year for ﬁve
years. The ﬁrm’s effective income tax rate is 40%.
(a) Set up a table and determine the ATCF for this project.
(b) Is the investment worthwhile when the after-tax MARR is 12% per year?

SECTION 7.10 / ILLUSTRATION OF COMPUTATIONS OF ATCFS
349
(a) The format recommended in Figure 7-5 is followed in Table 7-8 to obtain
ATCFs in years zero through ﬁve. Acquisitions of land, as well as additional
working capital, are treated as nondepreciable capital investments whose
MVs at the end of year ﬁve are estimated to equal their ﬁrst costs. (In
economic evaluations, it is customary to assume that land and working
capital do not inﬂate in value during the study period because they are
“nonwasting” assets.) By using a variation of Equation (7-21), we are able
to compute ATCF in year three (for example) to be
ATCF3 = ($30,000,000 −$8,000,000 −$11,520,000)(1 −0.40) + $11,520,000
= $17,808,000.
(b) The depreciable property in Example 7-18 ($60,000,000) will be disposed of
for $0 at the end of year ﬁve, and a loss on disposal of $6,912,000 will be
claimed at the end of year ﬁve. Only a half-year of depreciation ($3,456,000)
can be claimed as a deduction in year ﬁve, and the BV is $6,912,900 at
the end of year ﬁve. Because the selling price (MV) is zero, the loss on
disposal equals our BV of $6,912,000. As seen from Figure 7-5, a tax credit of
0.40($6,912,000) = $2,764,800 is created at the end of year ﬁve. The after-tax
IRR is obtained from entries in column E of Table 7-8 and is found to be
12.5%. The after-tax PW equals $936,715 at MARR = 12% per year. Based on
economic considerations, this integrated circuit production line should be
recommended because it appears to be quite attractive.
Inthenextexample, theafter-taxcomparisonofmutuallyexclusivealternatives
involving only costs is illustrated.
EXAMPLE 7-19
After-Tax Comparison of Purchase versus Leasing Alternatives
An engineering consulting ﬁrm can purchase a fully conﬁgured computer-
aided design (CAD) workstation for $20,000. It is estimated that the useful
life of the workstation is seven years, and its MV in seven years should be
$2,000. Operating expenses are estimated to be $40 per eight-hour workday, and
maintenance will be performed under contract for $8,000 per year. The MACRS
(GDS) property class is ﬁve years, and the effective income tax rate is 40%.
As an alternative, sufﬁcient computer time can be leased from a service
company at an annual cost of $20,000. If the after-tax MARR is 10% per year,
how many workdays per year must the workstation be needed in order to justify
leasing it?
Solution
This example involves an after-tax evaluation of purchasing depreciable
property versus leasing it. We are to determine how much the workstation must
be utilized so that the lease option is a good economic choice. A key assumption

350
CHAPTER 7 / DEPRECIATION AND INCOME TAXES
is that the cost of engineering design time (i.e., operator time) is unaffected by
whether the workstation is purchased or leased. Variable operations expenses
associated with ownership result from the purchase of supplies, utilities, and so
on. Hardware and software maintenance cost is contractually ﬁxed at $8,000 per
year. It is further assumed that the maximum number of working days per year
is 250.
Lease fees are treated as an annual expense, and the consulting ﬁrm (the
lessee) may not claim depreciation of the equipment to be an additional expense.
(The leasing company presumably has included the cost of depreciation in its
fee.) Determination of ATCF for the lease option is relatively straightforward
and is not affected by how much the workstation is utilized:
(After-tax expense of the lease)k = −$20,000(1 −0.40)= −$12,000; k = 1, . . . , 7.
ATCFs for the purchase option involve expenses that are ﬁxed (not a function
of equipment utilization) in addition to expenses that vary with equipment
usage. If we let X equal the number of working days per year that the equipment
is utilized, the variable cost per year of operating the workstation is $40X. The
after-tax analysis of the purchase alternative is shown in Table 7-9.
The after-tax annual worth (AW) of purchasing the workstation is
AW(10%) = −$20,000(A/P, 10%, 7) −$24X −[$3,200(P/F, 10%, 1) + · · ·
+ $4,800(P/F, 10%, 7)](A/P, 10%, 7) + $1,200(A/F, 10%, 7)
= −$24X −$7,511.

To solve for X, we equate the after-tax annual worth of both alternatives:
−$12,000 = −$24X −$7,511.
Thus, X = 187 days per year. Therefore, if the ﬁrm expects to utilize the
CAD workstation in its business more than 187 days per year, the equipment
should be leased.
The graphic summary of Example 7-19 shown in
Figure 7-7 provides the rationale for this recommendation. The importance of
the workstation’s estimated utilization, in workdays per year, is now quite
apparent.

cash ﬂows are shown in the following table. The effective income tax rate is 40%
and MACRS (GDS) depreciation is used. Both designs have a GDS recovery
period of ﬁve years. If the after-tax desired return on investment is 10% per year,

CHAPTER 7 / DEPRECIATION AND INCOME TAXES
Solution
Note that the design alternatives have different useful lives. The same basic
principles of engineering economy apply to both before-tax and after-tax anal-
yses. Therefore, we must analyze the two system designs over a common period
of time. As we discovered in Chapter 6, using the repeatability assumption along
with the annual worth method simpliﬁes the analysis of alternatives having
unequal lives.
Both alternatives would be depreciated using a ﬁve-year GDS recovery
period. No adjustments to the GDS rates are required because the useful life of
each alternative is greater than or equal to six years of depreciation deductions.
Tables 7-10 and 7-11 summarize the calculation of the ATCFs for the design
alternatives.

SECTION 7.11 / ECONOMIC VALUE ADDED 353
We can’t directly compare the PW of the after-tax cash ﬂows because of the
difference in the lives of the alternatives. We can, however, directly compare the
AWs of the ATCFs by using the repeatability assumption from Chapter 6.
AWS1(10%) = PWS1(A/P, 10%, 7) = −$1,411(0.2054) = −$290
AWS2(10%) = PWS2(A/P, 10%, 6) = −$16,681(0.2296) = −$3,830
Based on an after-tax annual worth analysis, Design S1 is preferred since it has
the greater (less negative) AW. Neither design however makes money, so if a
system is not required, don’t recommend either one.
7.11
Economic Value Added
This section discusses an economic measure for estimating the wealth creation
potential of capital investments that is experiencing increased attention and use.
The measure, called economic value added (EVA),∗can be determined from some
of the data available in an after-tax analysis of cash ﬂows generated by a capital
investment. Through retroactive analysis of a ﬁrm’s common stock valuation, it
has been established that some companies experience a statistically signiﬁcant
relationship between the EVA metric and the historical value of their common
stock.† For our purposes, EVA can also be used to estimate the proﬁt-earning
potential of proposed capital investments in engineering projects.
Simply stated, EVA is the difference between the company’s adjusted net
operating proﬁt after taxes (NOPAT) in a particular year and its after-tax cost of
capital during that year. Another way to characterize EVA is “the spread between
the return on the capital and the cost of the capital.”‡ On a project-by-project basis
(i.e., for discrete investments), the EVA metric can be used to gauge the wealth
creation opportunity of proposed capital expenditures. We now deﬁne annual
EVA as

CHAPTER 7 / DEPRECIATION AND INCOME TAXES
NOPATk can be determined from Figure 7-5. It is simply the algebraic addition
of the entry in column C and the entry in column D.
NOPATk = Taxable income + Cash ﬂow for income taxes
= (Rk −Ek −dk) + (−t)(Rk −Ek −dk)
= (Rk −Ek −dk)(1 −t)
(7-23)
Substituting Equation (7-21) into Equation (7-23), we can see the relationship
between ATCFk and NOPATk to be
NOPATk = ATCFk −dk.
(7-24)
Equation (7-23) and Figure 7-5 are demonstrated in Example 7-21 to determine
the ATCF amounts, after-tax AW, and the EVA amounts related to a capital
investment.

(b) The annual equivalent worth of the ATCFs equals −$84,000(A/P, 12%, 4) +
$30,500 = $2,844.
(c) The EVA in year k equals NOPATk −0.12 BVk−1 [Equation (7-22)]. The year-
by-year EVA amounts and the annual equivalent worth of EVA ($2,844) are
shown in the next table. Hence, the after-tax AW and the annual equivalent
worth of EVA of the project are identical.

$4,460(P/F, 12%, 3) + $6,980(P/F, 12%, 4)](A/P, 12%, 4) = $2,844.
In Example 7-21, it was shown that the after-tax AW (12%) of the proposed
engineering project is identical to the annual equivalent EVA at the same interest
rate. Therefore, the annual equivalent EVA is simply the annual worth, at the after-
tax MARR, of a project’s ATCFs. This straightforward relationship is also valid
when accelerated depreciation methods (such as MACRS) are used in the analysis
of a proposed project. The reader is referred to Problems 7-47, 7-48, and 7-49 at the
end of the chapter for EVA exercises.

Summary
In this chapter, we have presented important aspects of federal legislation relating
to depreciation and income taxes. It is essential to understand these topics so that
correct after-tax engineering economy evaluations of proposed projects may be
conducted. Depreciation and income taxes are also integral parts of subsequent
chapters in this book.
In this chapter, many concepts regarding current federal income tax laws were
described. For example, topics such as taxable income, effective income tax rates,
taxation of ordinary income, and gains and losses on disposal of assets were
explained. A general format for pulling together and organizing all these appar-
ently diverse subjects was presented in Figure 7-5. This format offers the student
or practicing engineer a means of collecting, on one worksheet, information that
is required for determining ATCFs and properly evaluating the after-tax economic
worth of a proposed capital investment. Figure 7-5 was then employed in numerous
examples. The student’s challenge is now to use this worksheet in organizing data
presented in problem exercises at the end of this and subsequent chapters and to
answer questions regarding the after-tax proﬁtability of proposed projects.

when the machine is disposed of at the end of year eight.
The net annual value added (i.e., revenues less expenses)
that can be attributed to this machine is constant over
eight years and amounts to $15,000. An effective income
tax rate of 40% is used by the company, and the after-tax

7-24. Refer to Example 6-10. Work this problem on
an after-tax basis when the MARR is 12% per year.
The effective income tax rate is 40%, and MACRS
depreciation is appropriate with a property class of ﬁve
years. Recall that the market values of M1 and M2 are
zero at the end of years ﬁve and eight, respectively. (7.9)
7-25. An ofﬁce supply company has purchased a light-
duty delivery truck for $18,000. The truck will be
depreciated under the MACRS with a property class
of 5 years. The truck’s MV is expected to decrease by
$3,000 per year. It is anticipated that the purchase of the
truck will increase the company’s revenue by $10,000
annually, whereas the associated operating expenses
are expected to be $3,500 annually. The company has
an effective income tax rate of 40%, and its after-tax
MARR is 15% per year. If the company plans to keep
the truck only 2 years, what would be the equivalent
after-tax annual worth of this investment? (7.9)
7-26. An assembly operation at a software company
currently requires $100,000 per year in labor costs. A
robot can be purchased and installed to automate this
operation, and the robot will cost $200,000 with no MV
at the end of its 10-year life. The robot, if acquired,
will be depreciated using SL depreciation to a terminal
BV of zero after 10 years. Maintenance and operation
expenses of the robot are estimated to be $64,000 per
year. The company has an effective income tax rate of
40%. Invested capital must earn at least 8% after income
taxes are taken into account. (7.9)
a. Use the IRR method to determine if the robot is a
justiﬁable investment.
b. If MACRS (seven-year recovery period) had been
used in Part (a), would the after-tax IRR be lower or
higher than your answer to Part (a)?
7-27. Liberty Airways is considering an investment of
$800,000 in ticket purchasing kiosks at selected airports.
The kiosks (hardware and software) have an expected
life of four years. Extra ticket sales are expected to be
60,000 per year at a discount price of $40 per ticket.
Fixed costs, excluding depreciation of the equipment,
are $400,000 per year, and variable costs are $24 per
ticket. The kiosks will be depreciated over four years,
using the SL method with a zero salvage value. The
onetime commitment of working capital is expected to
be 1/12 of annual sales dollars. The after-tax MARR is
15% per year, and the company pays income tax at the
rate of 34%. What’s the after-tax PW of this proposed
investment? Should the investment be made? (7.9)

a cost of $425,000 per site. This cost includes the
hardware, software, transportation, and installation
costs. Additional software training has been purchased
at a cost of $25,000 per site. The estimated MV for
each system during the fourth year is expected to be
5% of the total capital investment, at which time the
systems will all be sold. The company believes that use
of the new systems will enhance their circuit design
business, resulting in a total increase in annual income
of $1,000,000. The engineering design manager wants
to determine the tax implications of this purchase. He
estimates that annual operating and maintenance costs
on the systems will be approximately $220,000 (all sites
combined). The company’s marginal effective tax rate is
35% and the MACRS depreciation method (with a ﬁve-
year GDS recovery period) will be used. Use Figure 7-5
to determine the after-tax cash ﬂows for this project.
If the after-tax MARR is 20% per year, would you
recommend this investment? (7.9)
7-29. Your company has just signed a three-year
nonrenewable contract with the city of New Orleans for
earthmoving work. You are investigating the purchase
of heavy construction equipment for this job. The
equipment costs $200,000 and qualiﬁes for ﬁve-year
MACRS depreciation. At the end of the three-year
contract, you expect to be able to sell the equipment
for $70,000. If the projected operating expense for the
equipment is $65,000 per year, what is the after-tax
equivalent uniform annual cost (EUAC) of owning and
operating this equipment? The effective income tax rate
is 40%, and the after-tax MARR is 12% per year. (7.9)
7-30. The Greentree Lumber Company is attempting
to evaluate the proﬁtability of adding another cutting
line to its present sawmill operations. They would
need to purchase two more acres of land for $30,000
(total). The equipment would cost $130,000 and could
be depreciated over a ﬁve-year recovery period with
the MACRS method. Gross revenue is expected to
increaseby$50,000peryearforﬁveyears, andoperating
expenses will be $15,000 annually for ﬁve years. It is
expected that this cutting line will be closed down after
ﬁve years. The ﬁrm’s effective income tax rate is 50%. If
the company’s after-tax MARR is 5% per year, is this a
proﬁtable investment? (7.9)
7-31. A high-pressure reactor vessel in a pharma-
ceutical company was purchased for $200,000. It has
a useful life of 10 years, and the vessel can be sold for
$30,000 at that time. The vessel will be depreciated with
the MACRS method (its class life is 5 years). Annual net
cash ﬂow (revenue less expenses) is $200,000 per year
over the useful life. The effective income tax rate is 40%.
What is the after-tax cash ﬂow of the vessel at the end
of year 10? (7.9)
7-32. Your company is considering the introduction of
a new product line. The initial investment required for
this project is $500,000, and annual maintenance costs
are anticipated to be $35,000. Annual operating cost
will be in direct proportion to the level of production
at $8.50 per unit, and each unit of product can be sold
for $50.00. If the project has a life of 7 years, what is the
minimumannualproductionlevelforwhichthisproject
is economically viable? Work this problem on an after-

MV7 = 0, an effective income tax rate of 40%, and an
after-tax MARR of 10% per year. (7.9)
7-33. Your company has purchased equipment (for
$50,000) that will reduce materials and labor costs by
$14,000 each year for N years. After N years, there will
be no further need for the machine, and because the
machine is specially designed, it will have no MV at
any time. The IRS, however, has ruled that you must
depreciate the equipment on a SL basis with a tax life of
ﬁve years. If the effective income tax rate is 40%, what is
the minimum number of years your ﬁrm must operate
the equipment to earn 10% per year after taxes on its
investment? (7.9)
7-34. Refer to Problem 6-79. The alternatives all have
a MACRS (GDS) property class of three years. If
the effective income tax rate is 40% and the after-tax
MARR = (1 −0.4)(12%) = 7.2% per year, which
alternative should be recommended? Is this the same
recommendation you made when the alternatives were
analyzed on a before-tax basis? (7.10)

• Capital investment is $1,000,000. (This includes land
and working capital.)
• The cost of depreciable property, which is part of the
$1,000,000 total estimated project cost, is $420,000.
• Assume, for simplicity, that the depreciable property
is in the MACRS (GDS) three-year property class.
• The analysis period is three years.
• Annual operating and maintenance expenses are
$636,000 in the ﬁrst year, and they increase at the

project at the end of three years is $280,000.
• Federal income tax rate = 34%; state income tax
rate = 4%.
• MARR (after taxes) is 10% per year.
Based on an after-tax analysis using the PW method,
what
minimum

annual revenue is required to justify the project
economically? (7.9, 7.10)
7-36. The expected annual maintenance expense for a
new piece of equipment is $10,000. This isAlternativeA.
Alternatively, it is possible to perform the maintenance
every ﬁfth year at a cost of $50,000 (Alternative B). In
either case, maintenance will be performed in the ﬁfth
year so that the equipment can be sold for $100,000 at
that time. If the MARR is 15% per year (before income
taxes), which alternative should be recommended in
each of these situations? (7.10)
a. Before income taxes are considered.
b. After income taxes are considered when t = 40%.
c. Is there a different selection before and after income
taxes are considered?
7-37. An industrial coal-ﬁred boiler for process
steam is equipped with a 10-year-old electrostatic

7-38. Storage tanks to hold a highly corrosive chemical
are currently made of material Z26.
The capital
investment in a tank is $30,000, and its useful life
is eight years. Your company manufactures electronic
components and uses the ADS under MACRS to
calculate depreciation deductions for these tanks. The
net MV of the tanks at the end of their useful life is zero.
When a tank is four years old, it must be relined at a
cost of $10,000. This cost is not depreciated and can be
claimed as an expense during year four.
Instead of purchasing the tanks, they can be leased.
A contract for up to 20 years of storage tank service
can be written with the Rent-All Company. If your
ﬁrm’s after-tax MARR is 12% per year, what is the
greatest annual amount that you can afford to pay for
tank leasing without causing purchasing to be the more
economical alternative? Your ﬁrm’s effective income tax
rate is 40%. State any assumptions you make. (7.4, 7.9)
7-39. Two ﬁxtures are being considered for a parti-
cular job in a manufacturing ﬁrm. The pertinent data
for their comparison are summarized in Table P7-39.
The effective federal and state income tax rate is
50%. Depreciation recapture is also taxed at 50%. If
the after-tax MARR is 8% per year, which of the two
ﬁxtures should be recommended? State any important
assumptions you make in your analysis. (7.9)
7-40. Individual industries will use energy as
efﬁciently as it is economical to do so, and
there are several incentives to improve the efﬁciency
of energy consumption. To illustrate, consider the
selection of a new water pump. The pump is to operate
800 hours per year. Pump A costs $2,000, has an overall
efﬁciency of 82.06%, and it delivers 11 hp. The other
available alternative, pump B, costs $1,000, has an
overall efﬁciency of 45.13%, and delivers 12.1 hp. Both

pumps have a useful life of ﬁve years and will be sold
at that time. (Remember 1 hp = 0.746 kW.)
PumpAwill use SLdepreciation over ﬁve years with
an estimated SV of zero. Pump B will use the MACRS
depreciation method with a class life of three years.
After ﬁve years, pump A has an actual market value of
$400, and pump B has an actual market value of $200.
Using the IRR method on the after-tax cash ﬂows
and a before-tax MARR of 16.67%, is the incremental
investment in pump A economically justiﬁable? The
effective income tax rate is 40%. The cost of electricity is
$0.05/kWh, and the pumps are subject to a study period
of ﬁve years. (7.10)

7-46. AllenInternational, Inc., manufactureschemicals.
It needs to acquire a new piece of production equipment
to work on production for a large order that Allen has
received. The order is for a period of three years, and at
the end of that time the machine would be sold.
Allen has received two supplier quotations, both of
which will provide the required service. Quotation I
has a ﬁrst cost of $180,000 and an estimated salvage
value of $50,000 at the end of three years. Its cost
for operation and maintenance is estimated at $28,000
per year. Quotation II has a ﬁrst cost of $200,000 and
an estimated salvage value of $60,000 at the end of
three years. Its cost for operation and maintenance
is estimated at $17,000 per year. The company pays
income tax at a rate of 40% on ordinary income and
28% on depreciation recovery. The machine will be
depreciated using MACRS-GDS (asset class 28.0). Allen
uses an after-tax MARR of 12% for economic analysis,
and it plans to accept whichever of these two quotations
costs less. (7.10)
To perform an after-tax analysis to determine which
of these machines should be acquired, you must
a. state the study period you are using.
b. show all numbers necessary to support your
conclusions.
c. state what the company should do.
7-47. AMT, Inc., is considering the purchase of a digital
camera for maintenance of design speciﬁcations by
feeding digital pictures directly into an engineering
workstation where computer-aided design ﬁles can be
superimposed over the digital pictures. Differences
between the two images can be noted, and corrections,
as appropriate, can then be made by design engi-
neers. (7.12)
a. You have been asked by management to determine
the PW of the EVA of this equipment, assuming the
following estimates: capital investment = $345,000;
market value at end of year six = $120,000; annual
revenues = $120,000; annual expenses = $8,000;
equipment life = 6 years; effective income tax rate =
50%; and after-tax MARR = 10% per year. MACRS
depreciation will be used with a ﬁve-year recovery
period.
b. Compute the PW of the equipment’s ATCFs. Is
your answer in Part (a) the same as your answer
in Part (b)?
7-48. Refer to Example 7-15. Show that the PW of the
annual EVAamounts by the new machinery is the same
as the PW of the ATCF amounts ($17,208) given in

7-50. Extended Learning Exercise
You have the option to purchase or lease a ﬁve-axis
horizontal machining center. Any revenues generated
from the operation of the machine will be the same
whether it is leased or purchased. Considering the
information given, should you lease or purchase the
machine? Conduct after-tax analyses of both options.
The effective income tax rate is 40%, the evaluation
period is ﬁve years, and the MARR is 10% per year.
NOTES: (1) Under the Lease Option, maintenance costs
are included in the annual leasing cost. (2) Leasing
costs are paid at the beginning of each year and are
tax deductible. (3) Depreciation deductions cannot be
taken on leased equipment. (4) Deposits are not tax
deductible, and refunds of deposits are not taxable;
however, owing to the difference in timing between
payment and refund, they must be considered in your
analysis. (7.10)
Leasing Option
Annual leasing cost: $55,000
Deposit (paid at EOY zero, refunded at EOY ﬁve):
$75,000

taxes) for 30 years (360 payments) and the annual
interest rate (APR) is 8%, compounded monthly. If
your income tax bracket is 28%, what lump sum,
after-tax distribution can be taken at the end of 30
years? (7.7)
7-52. A $5,000 balance in a tax-deferred savings plan
will grow to $50,313.50 in 30 years at an 8% per year

CHAPTER 7 / DEPRECIATION AND INCOME TAXES
7-53. Determine the after-tax yield (i.e., IRR on the
ATCF) obtained by an individual who purchases a
$10,000, 10-year, 10% nominal interest rate bond. The
following information is given: (7.7)
• Interest is paid semi-annually, and the bond was
bought after the ﬁfth payment had just been received
by the previous owner.
• The purchase price for the bond was $9,000.
• All revenues (including capital gains) are taxed at an
income rate of 28%.
• The bond is held to maturity.
7-54. A
529-state-approved
Individual
Retirement
Account (IRA) permits parents to invest tax-free dollars
into their children’s college education fund (this money
may only be used for educational expenses). Another
popular plan, the Roth IRA, requires after-tax dollars
to be invested in a savings fund that may (or may not)
be used for paying future college expenses. Both plans
are tax free when the money is eventually withdrawn to
assist with college expenses. Clearly, the 529 IRA plan
is a better way to save for college expenses than the
Roth IRA. Quantify “better” when the marginal income
tax rate is 28% and $10,000 each year is invested in a
mutual fund earning 8% per year for 10 years. Note:
The estimated cost of a college education 10 years from
now is $110,000. (7.7)
7-55. A Roth IRA enables an individual to invest
after-tax dollars during the accumulation phase of
a retirement plan. The money is then income tax
free when it is withdrawn during retirement. A tax-
deductible IRA, on the other hand, provides an up-
front tax deduction for the annual contribution, but
it then requires income taxes to be paid on all future
distributions. A basic assumption as to which plan is
more beneﬁcial concerns the current income tax rates
versus their projected rates in the future.
To illustrate, suppose that $2,000 is available to
invest at the end of each year for 30 years. The income
tax rate now and into the foreseeable future is 28%, so
$2,000(1 −0.28) = $1,440 is invested annually into the
Roth IRA. However, $2,000 per year can be invested
into a tax-deductible IRA. Money invested under either
plan will be deposited into a mutual fund earning 8%
per year, and all accumulated money will be withdrawn
as a lump sum at the end of year 30. (7.7)
a. Which plan is better if future distributions of the
traditional (tax-free) IRA are taxed at an income tax
rate of 28%?
b. Which plan is better if the future income tax rate at
retirement (end of year 30) is 30%?
7-56. The income tax-free yield on a certain municipal
bond is 7% per year. This translates into approximately
a 5% annual yield if the municipal bond’s interest
had been taxable in the 28% income tax bracket
[7% (1 −0.28) approx. = 5%]. Compare the future
worth of the two situations (i.e., non-taxable versus
taxable interest) when $15,000 is deposited annually
for 30 years. What is the learning “take away” of this
problem? (7.9)
Spreadsheet Exercises
7-57. A bowling alley costs $500,000 and has a useful
life of 10 years. Its estimated MV at the end of year
10 is $20,000. Create a spreadsheet that calculates the
depreciation for years 1–10 using (i) the SL method,
(ii) the 200% DB method, and (iii) the MACRS method
(GDS class life = 10 years). For each method, compute
the PW of the depreciation deductions (at EOY 0). The
MARR is 10% per year. If a large PW is desirable,
what do you conclude regarding which method is
preferred? (7.5)
7-58. Create a spreadsheet to solve Problem 7-24. What
would the MV of M1 have to be (at the end of year ﬁve)

7-59. Interest on municipal bonds is usually exempt
from federal income taxes. The interest rate on these
bondsisthereforeanafter-tax rateofreturn(ROR).Other
types of bonds (e.g., corporate bonds) pay interest that
is taxable for federal income tax purposes. Thus, the
before-tax ROR on such bonds is typically higher than

FE PRACTICE PROBLEMS

the ROR on municipal bonds. Develop a spreadsheet
that contains the before-tax ROR (on taxable bonds) that
are equivalent to after-tax RORs of 4%, 5%, and 6% for
income tax rates of 15%, 28%, and 35%. (7.6)
7-60. Refer to the chapter opener and Exam-
ple 7-14. As an alternative to the coal-ﬁred
plant, PennCo could construct an 800 MW natural gas–
ﬁred plant. This plant would require the same initial
investmentof$1.12billiondollarstobedepreciatedover
its 30-year life using the SL method with SV30 = 0. The
capacity factor estimate of the plant would still be 80%,
but the efﬁciency of the natural gas–ﬁred plant would
be 40%. The annual operating and maintenance expense
is expected to be $0.01 per kWh. The cost of natural gas
is $8.00 per million Btu and the carbon dioxide tax is
$15 per metric ton. Natural gas emits 55 metric tons of
carbon dioxide per billion Btu produced. The effective
income tax rate is 40%, and the after-tax MARR is 10%
per year. Based on the after-tax cost of electricity, create
a spreadsheet to determine whether PennCo should
construct a natural gas–ﬁred or coal-ﬁred plant. Note:
1 kWh = 3,413 Btu. (7.9)

Chapter 8 discusses how inﬂation/deﬂation is dealt with in engineering
economy studies.
The Impact of Inﬂation on Household Income
A
ccording to government statistics, the median household income in the
United States in 1953 was $3,700 per year. Using the consumer price index
as a measure of inﬂation, this is equivalent to $30,000 in 2008. This means
that it requires $30,000 in 2008 to purchase the same amount of goods and services
that $3,700 would have bought you in 1953.∗After studying this chapter, you will
be able to determine such ﬁgures as the compounded annual rate of growth in
median household income from 1953 to 2008, as well as many more.
∗The effects of inﬂation should be carefully considered in evaluating capital investments. Inﬂation risk is the danger
that your money will not grow as fast as inﬂation or be worth as much tomorrow as it is today.

8.1 Introduction
In earlier chapters, we assumed that prices for goods and services in the market-
place remain relatively unchanged over extended periods. Unfortunately, this is
not generally a realistic assumption.
General price inﬂation, which is deﬁned here as an increase in the average price
paid for goods and services bringing about a reduction in the purchasing
power of the monetary unit, is a business reality that can affect the economic
comparison of alternatives.
The history of price changes shows that price inﬂation is much more common
than general price deﬂation, which involves a decrease in the average price for
goods and services with an increase in the purchasing power of the monetary unit.
The concepts and methodology discussed in this chapter, however, apply to any
price changes.
One measure of price changes in our economy (and an estimate of general price
inﬂation or deﬂation for the average consumer) is the consumer price index (CPI).
The CPI is a composite price index that measures average change in the prices paid
for food, shelter, medical care, transportation, apparel, and other selected goods
and services used by individuals and families. The average annual rate of CPI
inﬂation from 1982 to 1994 was 3.33%. For the period 1994–2004, the annual rate of
CPI inﬂation was only 2.59%.
Another measure of price changes in the economy (and also an estimate of
general price inﬂation or deﬂation) is the producer price index (PPI). In actuality, a
number of different indexes are calculated covering most areas of the U.S. economy.
These indexes are composite measures of average changes in the selling prices of
items used in the production of goods and services. These different indexes are
calculated by stage of production [crude materials (e.g., iron ore), intermediate
materials (rolled sheet steel), and ﬁnished goods (automobiles)], by standard
industrial classiﬁcation (SIC), and by the census product code extension of the
SIC areas. Thus, PPI information is available to meet the needs of most engineering
economy studies.
The CPI and PPI indexes are calculated monthly from survey information by
the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor. These indexes are
based on current and historical information and may be used, as appropriate, to
represent future economic conditions or for short-term forecasting purposes only.
The published annual CPI and PPI end-of-year values can be used to obtain an
estimate of general price inﬂation (or deﬂation). This is accomplished by computing
an annual change rate (%). The annual change rates are calculated as follows:
(CPI or PPI annual change rate, %)k = (Index)k −(Index)k−1
(Index)k−1
(100%).
369

370
CHAPTER 8 / PRICE CHANGES AND EXCHANGE RATES
For example, the end-of-year CPI for 2006 was 201.6, and the estimated end-of-year
CPI for 2007 is 208.0. The CPI annual change rate for 2007 is then estimated to be
(CPI)2007 −(CPI)2006
(CPI)2006
(100%) = 208.0 −201.6
201.6
(100%) = 3.17%.
In this chapter, we develop and illustrate proper techniques to account for
the effects of price changes caused by inﬂation and deﬂation. The case study at the
conclusion of the chapter illustrates the analysis of alternatives when price changes
are expected to occur.
8.2 Terminology and Basic Concepts
To facilitate the development and discussion of the methodology for including
price changes of goods and services in engineering economy studies, we need to
deﬁne and discuss some terminology and basic concepts. The dollar is used as the
monetary unit in this book except when discussing foreign exchange rates.
1. Actual dollars (A$) The number of dollars associated with a cash ﬂow (or a
noncash-ﬂow amount such as depreciation) as of the time it occurs. For example,
people typically anticipate their salaries two years in advance in terms of actual
dollars. Sometimes, A$ are referred to as nominal dollars, current dollars, then-
current dollars, and inﬂated dollars, and their relative purchasing power is
affected by general price inﬂation or deﬂation.
2. Real dollars (R$) Dollars expressed in terms of the same purchasing power
relative to a particular time. For instance, the future unit prices of goods or
services that are changing rapidly are often estimated in real dollars (relative to
some base year) to provide a consistent means of comparison. Sometimes, R$
are termed constant dollars.
3. General price inﬂation (or deﬂation) rate (f )Ameasure of the average change in
the purchasing power of a dollar during a speciﬁed period of time. The general
price inﬂation or deﬂation rate is deﬁned by a selected, broadly based index of
market price changes. In engineering economic analysis, the rate is projected for
a future time interval and usually is expressed as an effective annual rate. Many
large organizations have their own selected index that reﬂects the particular
business environment in which they operate.
4. Market (nominal) interest rate (im) The money paid for the use of capital,
normally expressed as an annual rate (%) that includes a market adjustment for
the anticipated general price inﬂation rate in the economy. Thus, it is a market
interest rate and represents the time value change in future actual dollar cash
ﬂows that takes into account both the potential real earning power of money
and the estimated general price inﬂation or deﬂation in the economy.
5. Real interest rate (ir) The money paid for the use of capital, normally expressed
as an annual rate (%) that does not include a market adjustment for the
anticipated general price inﬂation rate in the economy. It represents the time
value change in future real-dollar cash ﬂows based only on the potential real
earning power of money. It is sometimes called the inﬂation-free interest rate.

6. Basetimeperiod(b)Thereferenceorbasetimeperiodusedtodeﬁnetheconstant
purchasing power of real dollars. Often, in practice, the base time period is
designated as the time of the engineering economic analysis or reference time
zero (i.e., b = 0). However, b can be any designated point in time.
With an understanding of these deﬁnitions, we can delineate and illustrate some
useful relationships that are important in engineering economy studies.
8.2.1
The Relationship between Actual Dollars
and Real Dollars
The relationship between actual dollars (A$) and real dollars (R$) is deﬁned in
terms of the general price inﬂation (or deﬂation) rate; that is, it is a function
of f.
Actual dollars as of any period (e.g., a year), k, can be converted into real dollars
of constant market purchasing power as of any base period, b, by the relationship
(R$)k = (A$)k
!
1
1 + f
"k−b
= (A$)k(P/F, f%, k −b),
(8-1)
for a given b value. This relationship between actual dollars and real dollars applies
to the unit prices, or costs of ﬁxed amounts of individual goods or services, used
to develop (estimate) the individual cash ﬂows related to an engineering project.
The designation for a speciﬁc type of cash ﬂow, j, would be included as
(R$)k, j = (A$)k, j
!
1
1 + f
"k−b
= (A$)k, j(P/F, f%, k −b),
(8-2)
for a given b value, where the terms R$k, j and A$k, j are the unit price, or cost for a
ﬁxed amount, of goods or services j in period k in real dollars and actual dollars,
respectively.
EXAMPLE 8-1
Real-Dollar Purchasing Power of Your Salary
Suppose that your salary is $45,000 in year one, will increase at 4% per year
through year four, and is expressed in actual dollars as follows:
End of Year, k
Salary (A$)
1
45,000
2
46,800
3
48,672
4
50,619

372
CHAPTER 8 / PRICE CHANGES AND EXCHANGE RATES
If the general price inﬂation rate (f) is expected to average 6% per year, what
is the real-dollar equivalent of these actual-dollar salary amounts? Assume that
the base time period is year one (b = 1).
Solution
By using Equation (8-2), we see that the real-dollar salary equivalents are readily
calculated relative to the base time period, b = 1:
Year
Salary (R$, b = 1)
1
45,000(P/F, 6%, 0) = 45,000
2
46,800(P/F, 6%, 1) = 44,151
3
48,672(P/F, 6%, 2) = 43,318
4
50,619(P/F, 6%, 3) = 42,500
In year one (the designated base time period for the analysis), the annual salary
in actual dollars remained unchanged when converted to real dollars. This
illustrates an important point: In the base time period (b), the purchasing power of
an actual dollar and a real dollar is the same; that is, R$b, j = A$b, j. This example also
illustrates the results when the actual annual rate of increase in salary (4% in
this example) is less than the general price inﬂation rate (f). As you can see, the
actual-dollar salary cash ﬂow shows some increase, but a decrease in the real-
dollar salary cash ﬂow occurs (and thus a decrease in total market purchasing
power). This is the situation when people say their salary increases have not
kept pace with market inﬂation.
EXAMPLE 8-2
Real-Dollar Equivalent of Actual After-Tax Cash Flow
An engineering project team is analyzing the potential expansion of an existing
production facility. Different design alternatives are being considered. The

in column 2 of Table 8-1. If the general price inﬂation rate (f) is estimated to be
5.2% per year during the eight-year analysis period, what is the real-dollarATCF
that is equivalent to the actual-dollar ATCF? The base time period is year zero
(b = 0).
Solution
The application of Equation (8-1) is shown in column 3 of Table 8-1. The ATCF
in real dollars shown in column 4 has purchasing power in each year equivalent
to the original ATCF in actual dollars (column 2).

EXAMPLE 8-3
Inﬂation and Household Income
Inthisexample, wereturntothequestionraisedinthechapteropener.According
to government statistics, the median household income in the United States in
1953 was $3,700 per year. Based on the CPI, this is equivalent to $30,000 in 2008.
We can now answer the following questions.
(a) What was the annual compound rate of growth in median household income
from 1953 to 2008?
(b) By 1978, median household income was actually $15,000. Based on your
answer in Part (a), what is the equivalent household income in 2008?
(c) Was the actual median household income in 1978 higher than what you
would have predicted in Part (a)? If so, give some reasons for this
phenomenon.
Solution
(a) The annual compound rate of growth is the interest rate that makes $3,700
in 1953 equivalent to $30,000 in 2008.
$30,000 = $3,700(F/P, i′%, 55) = $3,700 (1 + i′)55
i′% = 3.88% per year
(b) Income2008 = $15,000(F/P, 3.88%, 30) = $15,000(3.133) = $46,995.
This is higher than $30,000 because inﬂation eased.
(c) Income1978 = $3,700(F/P, 3.88%, 25) = $9,583.
The actual 1978 income of $15,000 is greater than $9,583 because more persons
from an individual household were in the workforce in 1978 than in 1953. Also,
the inﬂation rate may have exceeded 3.88% on the average during this time
period.

CHAPTER 8 / PRICE CHANGES AND EXCHANGE RATES
8.2.2
The Correct Interest Rate to Use in Engineering
Economy Studies
In general, the interest rate that is appropriate for equivalence calculations in
engineering economy studies depends on whether actual-dollar or real-dollar
cash-ﬂow estimates are used:
If Cash Flows Are
Then the Interest
Method
in Terms of
Rate to Use Is
A
Actual dollars (A$)
Market interest rate, im
B
Real dollars (R$)
Real interest rate, ir
This table should make intuitive sense as follows: If one is estimating cash ﬂows
in terms of actual (inﬂated) dollars, the market interest rate (interest rate with an
inﬂation/deﬂation component) is used. Similarly, if one is estimating cash ﬂows in
termsofrealdollars, thereal(inﬂation-free)interestrateisused. Thus, onecanmake
economic analyses in either the actual- or real-dollar domain with equal validity,
provided that the appropriate interest rate is used for equivalence calculations.
It is important to be consistent in using the correct interest rate for the type of
analysis (actual or real dollars) being done. The two mistakes commonly made are
as follows:
Interest Rate
Type of Analysis
(MARR)
A$
R$
im
√(Correct)
Mistake 1
Bias is against capital investment
ir
Mistake 2
√(Correct)
Bias is toward capital investment
In Mistake 1, the market interest rate (im), which includes an adjustment for the
general price inﬂation rate (f), is used in equivalent-worth calculations for cash
ﬂows estimated in real dollars. There is a tendency to develop future cash-ﬂow
estimatesintermsofdollarswithpurchasingpoweratthetimeofthestudy(i.e., real
dollars with b = 0), and then to use the market interest rate in the analysis [a ﬁrm’s
MARRm is normally a combined (market) interest rate]. The result of Mistake 1 is a
bias against capital investment. The cash-ﬂow estimates in real dollars for a project
are numerically lower than the actual-dollar estimates with equivalent purchasing
power (assuming that f > 0). Additionally, the im value (which is usually greater
than the ir value that should be used) further reduces (understates) the equivalent
worth of the results of a proposed capital investment.
In Mistake 2, the cash-ﬂow estimates are in actual dollars, which include the
effect of general price inﬂation (f), but the real interest rate (ir) is used for equivalent-
worth calculations. Since the real interest rate does not include an adjustment for
general price inﬂation, we again have an inconsistency. The effects of this mistake,
in contrast to those in Mistake 1, result in a bias toward capital investment by
overstating the equivalent worth of future cash ﬂows.

SECTION 8.2 / TERMINOLOGY AND BASIC CONCEPTS
375
8.2.3
The Relationship among im, ir, and f
Equation (8-1) showed that the relationship between an actual-dollar amount and
a real-dollar amount of equal purchasing power in period k is a function of the
general inﬂation rate (f). It is desirable to do engineering economy studies in terms
of either actual dollars or real dollars. Thus, the relationship between the two dollar
domains is important, as well as the relationship among im, ir, and f, so that the
equivalent worth of a cash ﬂow is equal in the base time period when either an
actual- or a real-dollar analysis is used. The relationship among these three factors
is (derivation not shown)
1 + im = (1 + f)(1 + ir);
(8-3)
im = ir + f + ir(f);
(8-4)
ir = im −f
1 + f .
(8-5)
Similarly, based on Equation (8-5), the internal rate of return (IRR) of a real-
dollar cash ﬂow is related to the IRR of an actual-dollar cash ﬂow (with the same
purchasing power each period) as follows: IRRr = (IRRm −f)/(1 + f).
EXAMPLE 8-4
Real-Dollar Equivalent of an Investment
Suppose that $1,000 is deposited each year for ﬁve years into an equity (common
stock) account earning 8% per year. During this period, general inﬂation is
expected to remain at 3% per year. At the end of ﬁve years, what is the dollar
value of the account in terms of today’s purchasing power (i.e., real dollars)?
Solution
Immediately after the ﬁfth deposit, the actual dollar value of the equity account is
(A$)5 = $1,000 (F/A, 8%, 5) = $5,866.60.
The value of the account in today’s purchasing power is
(R$)5 = $5,866.60(P/F, 3%, 5) = $5,060.53.
EXAMPLE 8-5
Equivalence of Real-Dollar and Actual-Dollar Cash Flows
In Example 8-1, your salary was projected to increase at the rate of 4% per year,
and the general price inﬂation rate was expected to be 6% per year. Your resulting
estimated salary for the four years in actual and real dollars was as follows:
End of Year, k

CHAPTER 8 / PRICE CHANGES AND EXCHANGE RATES
What is the present worth (PW) of the four-year actual- and real-dollar salary
cash ﬂows at the end of year one (base year) if your personal MARRm is 10% per
year (im)?
Solution
(a) Actual-dollar salary cash ﬂow:
PW(10%)1 = $45,000 + $46,800(P/F, 10%, 1)
+ $48,672(P/F, 10%, 2) + $50,619(P/F, 10%, 3)
= $165,798.
(b) Real-dollar salary cash ﬂow:
ir = im −f
1 + f = 0.10 −0.06
1.06
= 0.03774, or 3.774%;
PW(3.774%)1 = $45,000 + $44,151

Thus, we obtain the same PW at the end of year one (the base time period)
for both the actual-dollar and real-dollar four-year salary cash ﬂows when the
appropriate interest rate is used for the equivalence calculations.
8.3
Fixed and Responsive Annuities
Whenever future cash ﬂows are predetermined by contract, as in the case of a
bond or a ﬁxed annuity, these amounts do not respond to general price inﬂation or
deﬂation. In cases where the future amounts are not predetermined, however, they
may respond to general price changes. To illustrate the nature of this situation, let
us consider two annuities. The ﬁrst annuity is ﬁxed (unresponsive to general price
inﬂation) and yields $2,000 per year in actual dollars for 10 years. The second
annuity is of the same duration and yields enough future actual dollars to be
equivalent to $2,000 per year in real dollars (purchasing power). Assuming a
general price inﬂation rate of 6% per year, pertinent values for the two annuities
over a 10-year period are as shown in Table 8-2.
Thus, when the amounts are constant in actual dollars (unresponsive to general
price inﬂation), their equivalent amounts in real dollars decline over the 10-year
interval to $1,117 in the ﬁnal year. When the future cash-ﬂow amounts are ﬁxed
in real dollars (responsive to general price inﬂation), their equivalent amounts in
actual dollars rise to $3,582 by year 10.

a See Equation (8-1).
Use of Equation (4-30)
The actual dollars for a responsive annuity in Table 8-2 form a geometric gradient
series with f = 6% per year. Suppose we wish to determine its present worth at
10% per year. From Equation (4-30), we see that
PW(10%) = $2,120[1 −(P/F, 10%, 10)(F/P, 6%, 10)]/(0.10 −0.06)
= $2,120[1 −(0.3855)(1.7908)]/0.04
= $16,411.
We can obtain the same result (subject to round-off differences) using the equation
in the footnote on page 150:
PW(10%) = $2,120
1.06 (P/A, 3.774%, 10)
= $2,000(8.2030)
= $16,406.
Included in engineering economy studies are certain quantities unresponsive to
general price inﬂation. For instance, depreciation amounts, once determined, do
not increase (with present accounting practices) to keep pace with general price
inﬂation; lease fees and interest charges typically are contractually ﬁxed for a
given period of time. Thus, it is important when doing an actual-dollar analysis
to recognize the quantities that are unresponsive to general price inﬂation, and
when doing a real-dollar analysis to convert theseA$ quantities to R$ quantities,
using Equation (8-2).
If this is not done, not all cash ﬂows will be in the same dollar domain (A$ or
R$), and the analysis results will be distorted. Speciﬁcally, the equivalent worths of
the cash ﬂows for an A$ and an R$ analysis will not be the same in the base year, b,

378
CHAPTER 8 / PRICE CHANGES AND EXCHANGE RATES
and the A$ IRR and the R$ IRR for the project will not have the proper relationship
based on Equation (8-5); that is, IRRr = (IRRm −f)/(1 + f).
In Example 8-6, we look at a bond (Chapter 5), which is a ﬁxed-income asset,
and see how its current value is affected by a period of projected deﬂation.
EXAMPLE 8-6
Impact of Deﬂation on the Current Price of a Bond
Suppose that deﬂation occurs in the U.S. economy and that the CPI (as a measure
of f) is expected to decrease an average of 2% per year for the next ﬁve years.
A bond with a face (par) value of $10,000 and a life of ﬁve years (i.e., it will be
redeemed in ﬁve years) pays an interest (bond) rate of 5% per year. The interest
is paid to the owner of the bond once each year. If an investor expects a real rate
of return of 4% per year, what is the maximum amount that should be paid now
for this bond?
Solution
The cash ﬂows over the life of the bond are 0.05($10,000) = $500 per year in
interest(actualdollars)foryearsonethroughﬁve, plustheredemptionof$10,000
(the face value of the bond), also in actual dollars, at the end of year ﬁve. To
determine the current value of this bond (i.e., the maximum amount an investor
should pay for it), these cash ﬂows must be discounted to the present, using the
market interest rate. From Equation (8-4), we can compute im (where f = −2%
per year) as follows:
im = ir + f + ir(f) = 0.04 −0.02 −0.04(0.02)
= 0.0192, or 1.92% per year.
Therefore, the current market value of the bond is
PW = $500(P/A, 1.92%, 5) + $10,000(P/F, 1.92%, 5)
= $500(4.7244) + $10,000(0.9093)
= $11,455.
In general, if the rate used to discount the future cash ﬂows over the life of a
bond is less than the bond rate (the situation in this example), then the current
(market) value will be greater than the bond’s face value. Therefore, during
periods of deﬂation, owners of bonds (or other types of ﬁxed-income assets)
need to monitor their market values closely because a favorable sell situation
may occur.
Engineeringeconomystudiesthatincludetheeffectsofpricechangescausedby
inﬂation or deﬂation may also include such items as interest charges, depreciation
amounts, lease payments, and other contract amounts that are actual-dollar cash
ﬂows based on past commitments. They are generally unresponsive to further price
changes. At the same time, many other types of cash ﬂows (e.g., labor, materials) are
responsive to market price changes. In Example 8-7, an after-tax analysis is presented
that shows the correct handling of these different situations.

SECTION 8.3 / FIXED AND RESPONSIVE ANNUITIES 379
EXAMPLE 8-7
After-Tax Analysis: A Mixture of Fixed and Responsive Cash Flows
The cost of a new and more efﬁcient electrical circuit switching equipment is
$180,000. It is estimated (in base year dollars, b = 0) that the equipment will
reduce current net operating expenses by $36,000 per year (for 10 years) and
will have a $30,000 market value at the end of the 10th year. For simplicity,
these cash ﬂows are estimated to increase at the general price inﬂation rate
(f = 8% per year). Due to new computer control features on the equipment, it
will be necessary to contract for some maintenance support during the ﬁrst three
years. The maintenance contract will cost $2,800 per year. This equipment will be
depreciated under the MACRS (GDS) method, and it is in the ﬁve-year property
class. The effective income tax rate (t) is 38%; the selected analysis period is
10 years; and the MARRm (after taxes) is im = 15% per year.
(a) Based on an actual-dollar after-tax analysis, is this capital investment
justiﬁed?
(b) Develop the ATCF in real dollars.
Solution
(a) The actual-dollar after-tax economic analysis of the new equipment is shown
in Table 8-3 (columns 1–7). The capital investment, savings in operating
expenses, and market value (in the 10th year) are estimated in actual dollars
(column 1), using the general price inﬂation rate and Equation (8-1). The
maintenance contract amounts for the ﬁrst three years (column 2) are already
in actual dollars. (They are unresponsive to further price changes.) The
algebraic sum of columns 1 and 2 equals the before-tax cash ﬂow (BTCF)
in actual dollars (column 3).
In columns 4, 5, and 6, the depreciation and income-tax calculations are
shown. The depreciation deductions in column 4 are based on the MACRS
(GDS) method and, of course, are in actual dollars. The entries in columns 5
and 6 are calculated as discussed in Chapter 7. The effective income tax
rate (t) is 38% as given. The entries in column 6 are equal to the entries in
column 5 multiplied by −t. The algebraic sum of columns 3 and 6 equals the
ATCF in actual dollars (column 7). The PW of the actual-dollar ATCF, using
im = 15% per year, is
PW(15%) = −$180,000 + $36,050(P/F, 15%, 1)
+ · · · + $40,156(P/F, 15%, 10) = $33,790.
Therefore, the project is economically justiﬁed.
(b) Next, Equation (8-1) is used to calculate the ATCF in real dollars from
the entries in column 7. The real-dollar ATCF (column 9) shows the
estimated economic consequences of the new equipment in dollars that have
the constant purchasing power of the base year. The actual-dollar ATCF
(column 7) is in dollars that have the purchasing power of the year in which
the cost or saving occurs. The comparative information provided by the
ATCF in both actual dollars and real dollars is helpful in interpreting the

results of an economic analysis. Also, as illustrated in this example, the
conversion between actual dollars and real dollars can easily be done. The
PW of the real-dollar ATCF (column 9), using ir = (im −f)/(1 + f) = (0.15 −
0.08)/1.08 = 0.06481, or 6.48%, is
PW(6.48%) = −$180,000 + $33,379(P/F, 6.48%, 1)
+ · · · + $18,600(P/F, 6.48%, 10)
= $33,790.
Thus, the PW (equivalent worth in the base year with b = 0) of the real-dollar
ATCF is the same as the PW calculated previously for the actual-dollarATCF.
8.4
Differential Price Changes
The general price inﬂation (or deﬂation) rate (f) may not be the best estimate of
future price changes for one or more cost and revenue cash ﬂows in an engineering
economy study. The variation between the general price inﬂation rate and the
best estimate of future price changes for speciﬁc goods and services is called
differentialpriceinﬂation(ordeﬂation), anditiscausedbyfactorssuchastechnological
improvements, and changes in productivity, regulatory requirements, and so
on. Also, a restriction in supply, an increase in demand, or a combination of
both may change the market value of a particular good or service relative to
others. Price changes caused by some combination of general price inﬂation and
differential price inﬂation (or deﬂation) can be represented by a total price escalation
(or de-escalation) rate. These rates are further deﬁned as follows:
1. Differential price inﬂation (or deﬂation) rate (e′
j): The increment (%) of price
change (in the unit price or cost for a ﬁxed amount), above or below the general
price inﬂation rate, during a period (normally a year) for good or service j.
2. Totalpriceescalation(orde-escalation)rate(ej): Thetotalrate(%)ofpricechange
(in the unit price or cost for a ﬁxed amount) during a period (normally a year),
for good or service j. The total price escalation rate for a good or service includes
the effects of both the general price inﬂation rate (f) and the differential price
inﬂation rate (e′
j) on price changes.
8.4.1
The Relationship among ej, e′
j, and f
The differential price inﬂation rate (e′
j) is a price change in good or service j in
real dollars caused by various factors in the marketplace. Similarly, the total price
escalation rate (ej) is a price change in actual dollars. The relationship among these
two factors (ej, e′
j) and f is (derivation not shown)
1 + ej = (1 + e′
j)(1 + f);
(8-6)

382
CHAPTER 8 / PRICE CHANGES AND EXCHANGE RATES
ej = e′
j + f + e′
j(f);
(8-7)
e′
j = ej −f
1 + f .
(8-8)
Thus, as shown in Equation (8-7), the total price escalation rate (ej) for good or
service j in actual dollars is the sum of the general price inﬂation rate and the
differential price inﬂation rate plus their product. Also, as shown in Equation
(8-8), the differential price inﬂation rate (e′
j) in real dollars can be calculated from
the total price escalation rate and the general price inﬂation rate.
In practice, the general price inﬂation rate (f) and the total price escalation rate
(ej) for each good and service involved are usually estimated for the study period.
For each of these rates, different values may be used for subsets of periods within
the analysis period if justiﬁed by the available data. The differential price inﬂation
rates (e′
j), when needed, normally are not estimated directly but are calculated
using Equation (8-8).
EXAMPLE 8-8
The prospective maintenance expenses for a commercial heating, ventilating,
and air-conditioning (HVAC) system are estimated to be $12,200 per year in
base-year dollars (assume that b = 0). The total price escalation rate is estimated
to be 7.6% for the next three years (e1,2,3 = 7.6%), and for years four and ﬁve
it is estimated to be 9.3% (e4,5 = 9.3%). The general price inﬂation rate (f) for
this ﬁve-year period is estimated to be 4.7% per year. Develop the maintenance
expense estimates for years one through ﬁve in actual dollars and in real dollars,
using ej and e′
j values, respectively.

Solution
The development of the annual maintenance expenses in actual dollars is shown
in column 2 of Table 8-4. In this example, the general price inﬂation rate is not the
best estimate of changes in future maintenance expenses. The ﬁve-year period is
divided into two subperiods corresponding to the two different price escalation

SECTION 8.5 / SPREADSHEET APPLICATION 383
rates (e1,2,3 = 7.6%; e4,5 = 9.3%). These rates are then used with the estimated
expenses in the base year; (A$)0 = (R$)0 = $12,200.
The development of the maintenance expenses in real dollars is shown in
column 4. This development is the same as for actual dollars, except that the
e′
j values [Equation (8-8)] are used instead of the ej values. The e′
j values in this
example are as follows:
e′
1,2,3 = 0.076 −0.047
1.047
= 0.0277, or 2.77%;
e′
4,5 = 0.093 −0.047
1.047
= 0.0439, or 4.39%.
This illustrates that differential inﬂation, or deﬂation, also results in market price
changes in real dollars, as well as in actual dollars.
An additional example of differential price changes is provided in Section
8.7 (case study).

Spreadsheet Application
The following example illustrates the use of spreadsheets to convert actual dollars
to real dollars, and vice versa.
EXAMPLE 8-9
Saving to Meet a Retirement Goal
Sara B. Goode wishes to retire in the year 2022 with personal savings of $500,000
(1997 spending power). Assume that the expected inﬂation rate in the economy
will average 3.75% per year during this period. Sara plans to invest in a 7.5%
per year savings account, and her salary is expected to increase by 8.0% per year
between 1997 and 2022. Assume that Sara’s 1997 salary was $60,000 and that the
ﬁrst deposit took place at the end of 1997. What percent of her yearly salary must
Sara put aside for retirement purposes to make her retirement plan a reality?
Solution
This example demonstrates the ﬂexibility of a spreadsheet, even in instances
where all of the calculations are based on a piece of information (percentage of
salary to be saved) that we do not yet know. If we deal in actual dollars, the
cash-ﬂow relationships are straightforward. The formula in cell B7 in Figure 8-1
converts the desired ending balance into actual dollars. The salary is paid at the
end of the year, at which point some percentage is placed in a bank account.
The interest calculation is based on the cumulative deposits and interest in the
account at the beginning of the year, but not on the deposits made at the end of
the year. The salary is increased and the cycle repeats.
The spreadsheet model is shown in Figure 8-1. We can enter the formulas
for the annual salary increase (column B), the percentage of the salary (cell E1)
that goes into savings (column C), and the bank balance at the end of the year
(column D) without knowing the percentage of salary being saved.

384
CHAPTER 8 / PRICE CHANGES AND EXCHANGE RATES
Figure 8-1
Spreadsheet Solution, Example 8-9
Aslider control (cells F1 and G1) is used in this model to vary the percentage
of salary saved value in cell E1. The value in cell E1 can be changed by using the
mouse to click on either the left or right arrows. We’ll know when we’ve found

SECTION 8.6 / FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES AND PURCHASING POWER CONCEPTS
385
the correct percentage when the difference between the desired balance and
actual balance (cell D37) is approximately zero. The steps involved in creating
a slider control in Excel can be found in Appendix A. (As an alternative to the
slider control, we could have manually changed the value in cell E1 or made use
of the solver feature that most spreadsheet packages include.)
Once the problem has been formulated in a spreadsheet, we can determine
the impact of different interest rates, inﬂation rates, and so on, on the retirement
plan, with minimal changes and effort. [Answer: 12.44%]
8.6
Foreign Exchange Rates and Purchasing
Power Concepts
Unless you are planning to travel abroad, you probably haven’t given much
thought to how currency ﬂuctuations can affect purchasing power. With the world
economy becoming increasingly interconnected, a dollar rising in price (or a
weakening euro) will have an impact on the estimated cash ﬂows associated with
foreign investments. Many factors inﬂuence the price of a currency due to supply-
and-demand considerations, including a country’s interest rates, cross-border
investing, national debt, inﬂation, and trade balance. When a currency changes
in value because of these factors, holders of that country’s currency experience
a change in overseas buying power. For example, if one dollar goes from being
worth 1.0 euros to 0.8 euros (in this situation the dollar is weakening), 1,000 euros
worth of goods from a European company that previously cost a U.S. purchaser
$1,000 must now be bought for $1,250. This applies to consumer products as well as
capital investments, and the purpose of Section 8.6 is to explore the consequences
of exchange rate ﬂuctuations on the proﬁtability of foreign investments.
Changes in the exchange rate between two currencies over time are analogous
to changes in the general inﬂation rate because the relative purchasing power
between the two currencies is changing similar to the relative purchasing power
between actual dollar amounts and real dollar amounts.
Assume the following:
ius = rate of return in terms of a market interest rate relative to U.S. dollars.
ifm = rate of return in terms of a market interest rate relative to the currency
of a foreign country.
fe = annual devaluation rate (rate of annual change in the exchange rate) be-
tween the currency of a foreign country and the U.S. dollar. In the follow-
ing relationships, a positive fe is used when the foreign currency is being
devalued relative to the dollar, and a negative fe is used when the dollar
is being devalued relative to the foreign currency.

EXAMPLE 8-10
Investing in a Foreign Assembly Plant
The CMOS Electronics Company is considering a capital investment of
50,000,000 pesos in an assembly plant located in a foreign country. Currency
is expressed in pesos, and the exchange rate is now 100 pesos per U.S. dollar.
The country has followed a policy of devaluing its currency against the
dollar by 10% per year to build up its export business to the United States. This
means that each year the number of pesos exchanged for a dollar increases by
10% (fe = 10%), so in two years (1.10)2(100) = 121 pesos would be traded
for one dollar. Labor is quite inexpensive in this country, so management of
CMOS Electronics feels that the proposed plant will produce the following rather
attractive ATCF, stated in pesos:

If CMOS Electronics requires a 15% IRR per year, after taxes, in U.S. dollars (ius)
on its foreign investments, should this assembly plant be approved? Assume
that there are no unusual risks of nationalization of foreign investments in this
country.
Solution
To earn a 15% annual rate of return in U.S. dollars, the foreign plant must earn,
based on Equation (8-9), 0.15 + 0.10 + 0.15(0.10) = 0.265, which is 26.5% on its
investment in pesos (ifm). As shown next, the PW (at 26.5%) of theATCF, in pesos,
is 9,165,236, and its IRR is 34.6%. Therefore, investment in the plant appears to be

SECTION 8.6 / FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES AND PURCHASING POWER CONCEPTS

economically justiﬁed. We can also convert pesos into dollars when evaluating
the prospective investment:

that the two IRRs can be reconciled by using Equation (8-10):

ifm(IRR in pesos) −0.10
1.10
= 0.346 −0.10
1.10
= 0.224, or 22.4%.
Remember that devaluation of a foreign currency relative to the U.S. dollar
produces less expensive exports to the United States. Thus, devaluation means
that the U.S. dollar is stronger relative to the foreign currency. That is, fewer dollars
are needed to purchase a ﬁxed amount (barrels, tons, items) of goods and services
from the foreign source or, stated differently, more units of the foreign currency are
required to purchase U.S. goods. This phenomenon was observed in Example 8-10.
Conversely, when exchange rates for foreign currencies gain strength against
the U.S. dollar (fe has a negative value and the U.S. dollar is weaker relative to the
foreign currency), the prices for imported goods and services into the United States
rise. In such a situation, U.S. products are less expensive in foreign markets.
In summary, if the average devaluation of currency A is fe% per year relative to
currency B, then each year it will require fe% more of currency A to exchange
for the same amount of currency B.
EXAMPLE 8-11

(b) If the average devaluation of the U.S. dollar (for the next ﬁve years) is
estimated to be 3% per year relative to currency A, what would be the
exchange rate three years from now?
Solution
(a) 10.7(1.042)3 = 12.106 units of A per U.S. dollar.
(b) 10.7 units of A = 1(1.03)3 U.S. dollars,

EXAMPLE 8-12
Proﬁtability Analysis of a Foreign Investment
A U.S. ﬁrm is analyzing a potential investment project in another country. The
present exchange rate is 425 of their currency units (A) per U.S. dollar. The
best estimate is that currency A will be devalued in the international market
at an average of 2% per year relative to the U.S. dollar over the next several
years. The estimated before-tax net cash ﬂow (in currency A) of the project is as
follows:

is 20% per year, is the project economically justiﬁed?
(b) Instead, if the U.S. dollar is estimated to be devalued in the international
market an average of 2% per year over the next several years, what would
be the rate of return based on the U.S. dollar? Is the project economically
justiﬁed?

SECTION 8.6 / FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES AND PURCHASING POWER CONCEPTS
389
Solution
(a)
PW(i′%) = 0 = −850,000,000 + 270,000,00(P/A, i′%, 6)
+ 120,000,000(P/F, i′%, 6).
By trial and error (Chapter 5), we determine that i′% = ifm = IRRfm =
24.01%. Now, using Equation (8-10), we have
ius = IRRus = 0.2401 −0.02
1.02
= 0.2158, or 21.58%.
Since this rate of return in terms of the U.S. dollar is greater than the ﬁrm’s
MARR (20% per year), the project is economically justiﬁed (but very close
to the minimum rate of return required on the investment).
A Second Solution to Part (a)
Using Equation (8-9), we can determine the ﬁrm’s MARR value in terms of
currency A as follows:
ifm = MARRfm = 0.20 + 0.02 + 0.02(0.20) = 0.244, or 22.4%.
Using this MARRfm value, we can calculate the PW(22.4%) of the project’s net
cash ﬂow (which is estimated in units of currency A); that is, PW(22.4%) =
32,597,000 units of currency A. Since this PW is greater than zero, we conﬁrm
that the project is economically justiﬁed.
(b) Using Equation (8-10) and the IRRfm value [24.01% calculated in the solution
to Part (a)], we have
ius = IRRus = 0.2401 −(−0.02)
1 −0.02
= 0.2654, or 26.54%.
Since the rate of return in terms of the U.S. dollar is greater than the required
MARRus = 20%, the project is economically justiﬁed.
As additional information, notice in the ﬁrst solution to Part (a), when
currency A is estimated to be devalued relative to the U.S. dollar, IRRus =
21.58%; whereas in Part (b), when the U.S. dollar is estimated to be devalued
relative to currency A, IRRus = 26.54%. What is the relationship between the
different currency devaluations in the two parts of the problem and these
results?
Answer: Since the annual earnings to the U.S. ﬁrm from the investment
are in units of currency A originally, and currency A is being devalued
relative to the U.S. dollar in Part (a), these earnings would be exchanged for
decreasing annual amounts of U.S. dollars, causing an unfavorable impact
on the project’s IRRus. In Part (b), however, the U.S. dollar is being devalued
relative to currency A, and these annual earnings would be exchanged for
increasing annual amounts of U.S. dollars, causing a favorable impact on
the project’s IRRus.

Historical data indicate that maintenance costs increase at the rate of 4% per
year and that the cost of electricity increases at the rate of 5% per year. The assembly
line must operate two eight-hour shifts per day, six days per week, for 50 weeks per
year. An eight-year study period is being used for the project, and the company’s
market-based cost of capital (MARRm) is 8% per year. Your engineering project
team has been tasked with determining what combination of motors should be
purchased to provide the additional power requirements of the upgraded assembly
line.
Solution
Your project team has decided that the overall problem of motor selection can be
broken down into the following subproblems to arrive at a recommendation:
(a) Determine whether it is less expensive to operate a synchronous motor at a
power factor of 0.9 or 1.0.
(b) Determine the PW of the cost of operating one motor of each type at rated
horsepower for the total period of operational time during the eight-year
project lifetime.
(c) Determine the combination of motors that should be purchased. The objective
is to minimize the PW of the total cost.

SECTION 8.7 / CASE STUDY—SELECTING ELECTRIC MOTORS TO POWER AN ASSEMBLY LINE 391
Solution to Subproblem (a)
Because the capital investment and maintenance costs of the synchronous motor
are independent of the power factor employed, only the cost of electricity needs to
be considered at this stage of the analysis.
The efﬁciency of the 500-horsepower synchronous motor operating at a power
factor of 0.9 is 90%. Therefore, the cost of electricity per operating hour is (recall
that 1 hp = 746 watts)
(500 hp/0.9)(0.746 kW/hp)($0.030/kWh) = $12.43/hour.
When operated at a power factor (pf) of 1.0, the efﬁciency of the motor is reduced
to 80%. The electric company, however will provide electricity at a discounted rate.
The resulting cost of electricity is
(500 hp/0.8)(0.746 kW/hp)($0.025/kWh) = $11.66/hour.
Therefore, it is less expensive to operate the synchronous motor at pf = 1.0. The
discounted electricity rate more than compensates for the loss in efﬁciency. Given
this information, operating the synchronous motor at pf = 0.9 is no longer a feasible
alternative.
Solution to Subproblem (b)
The total cost of each motor over the study period consists of the capital investment,
maintenance costs, and electricity costs. Speciﬁcally, for each motor type,
PWTotal costs = Capital investment + PW(maintenance costs)
+ PW(electricity costs).
Maintenance costs increase 4% annually over the eight-year period and can be
modeled as a geometric gradient series. Recall from Chapter 4 that the present
equivalent of a geometric gradient series is given by:
P =
⎧
⎨
⎩
A1[1 −(P/F, i%, N)(F/P, ¯f%, N)]
i −¯f
¯f ̸= i
A1N(P/F, i%, 1)
¯f = i,
(8-11)
where ¯f is the rate of increase per period. Using this relationship,
PW(maintenance costs) = A1[1 −(P/F, 8%, 8)(F/P, 4%, 8)]
0.08 −0.04
= A1
0.04[1 −(0.5403)(1.3686)]
= A1(6.5136),
where A1 = $1,000 for the induction motor and A1 = $1,250 for the synchronous
motor.

392
CHAPTER 8 / PRICE CHANGES AND EXCHANGE RATES
Electricity costs are estimated to increase 5% annually over the eight-year study
period and can also be modeled as a geometric gradient series.
PW(electricity costs) = A1[1 −(P/F, 8%, 8)(F/P, 5%, 8)]
0.08 −0.05
= A1
0.03[1 −(0.5403)(1.4775)]
= A1(6.7236).
Now, the number of hours of motor operation per year is
(8 hours/shift)(2 shifts/day)(6 days/week)(50 weeks/year) = 4,800 hours/year.
Thus, for the induction motor,
A1 = (400 hp/0.85)(0.746 kW/hp)(4,800 hours/year)($0.030/kWh) = $50,552
and
A1 = (500 hp/0.8)(0.746 kW/hp)(4,800 hours/year)($0.025/kWh) = $55,950
for the synchronous motor running at pf = 1.0.
We can now compute the PW of total costs for each motor type over the entire
eight-year study period.
PWTotal costs(induction motor) = $17,640 + $1,000(6.5136) + $50,552(6.7236)
= $17,640 + $6,514 + $339,891
= $364,045.
PWTotal costs(synchronous motor) = $24,500 + $1,250(6.5136) + $55,950(6.7236)
= $24,500 + $8,142 + $376,185
= $408,827.
Solution to Subproblem (c)
The last step of the analysis is to determine what combination of motors to use to
obtain the required 1,550 horsepower output. The following four options will be
considered:
(A) Four induction motors (three at 400 horsepower, one at 350 horsepower)
(B) Four synchronous motors (three at 500 horsepower, one at 50 horsepower)
(C) Three induction motors at 400 horsepower plus one synchronous motor at
350 horsepower
(D) Three synchronous motors at 500 horsepower plus one induction motor at
50 horsepower.
For a motor used at less than rated capacity, the electricity cost is proportional to
the fraction of capacity used—all other costs are unaffected.

SECTION 8.8 / TRY YOUR SKILLS 393
The PW of total costs for each of the preceding options is computed using the
results of subproblem (b):
PWTotal costs(A) = (3)($364,045) + [$17,640 + $6,514 + (350/400)($339,891)]
= $1,413,694
PWTotal costs(B) = (3)($408,827) + [$24,500 + $8,142 + (50/500)($376,185)]
= $1,296,742
PWTotal costs(C) = (3)($364,045) + [$24,500 + $8,142 + (350/500)($376,185)]
= $1,388,107
PWTotal costs(D) = (3)($408,827) + [$17,640 + $6,514 + (50/400)($339,891)]
= $1,293,121
Option (D) has the lowest PW of total costs. Thus, your project team’s recommen-
dation is to power the assembly line using three 500-horsepower synchronous
motors operated at a power factor of 1.0 and one 400-horsepower induction motor.
You also include a note to management that there is additional capacity available
should future modiﬁcations to the assembly line require more power.
This case study illustrates the inclusion of price changes in the analysis of
engineering projects. The cost of goods and services changes over time and needs
to be addressed. Sensitivity analyses on key performance and cost parameters can
be used to quantify project risk.

Summary
Price changes caused by inﬂation or deﬂation are an economic and business reality
that can affect the comparison of alternatives. In fact, since the 1920s, the historical
U.S. inﬂation rate has averaged approximately 3% per year. Much of this chapter
has dealt with incorporating price changes into before-tax and after-tax engineering
economy studies.
In this regard, it must be ascertained whether cash ﬂows have been estimated
in actual dollars or real dollars. The appropriate interest rate to use when
discounting or compounding actual-dollar amounts is a nominal, or marketplace,
rate, while the corresponding rate to apply in real-dollar analysis is the ﬁrm’s real
interest rate.
Engineering economy studies often involve quantities that do not respond to
inﬂation, such as depreciation amounts, interest charges, and lease fees and other
amounts established by contract. Identifying these quantities and handling them
properly in an analysis are necessary to avoid erroneous economic results. The
use of the chapter’s basic concepts in dealing with foreign exchange rates has also
been demonstrated.

8-32. In a certain foreign country in 2009, the local
currency (the ‘Real’) was pegged to the U.S. dollar at
the rate of $1 U.S. = 1 Real. The Real was then devalued
over the next ﬁve years so that $1 U.S. = 2 Real. A bank
in the Northeastern United States bought assets in this
country valued at 100 million Real in 2009. Now that it is
year 2014, what is the worth of this bank’s investment in
U.S. dollars? Should the bank sell out of its investment

pertinent information for the study is as follows:
Lease costs: First year, $80,000; second year, $60,000;
third through sixth years, $50,000 per year. Assume
that a six-year contract has been offered by the lessor
that ﬁxes these costs over the six-year period.
Other costs (not covered under contract): $4,000 in year-
zero dollars, and estimated to increase 10% each year.
Effective income tax rate: 40%. (8.7)
a. Develop the actual-dollar ATCF for the leasing
alternative.

100% efﬁciency, can deliver one million Btu. Further
suppose that natural gas is now selling for $7.50 per
1,000 cubic feet. What is the PW of fuel cost for this
heating unit over a 12-year period if natural gas prices
are expected to increase at an average rate of 10% per

(year-zero) dollars over its useful life. A compressor
replacement is required at the end of the eighth year at a
cost of $500 in real dollars. The annual cost of electricity
for the heat pump is $680, based on present prices.
Electricity prices are projected to increase at an annual
rate of 10%. All other costs are expected to increase
at 6%, which is the projected general price inﬂation
rate. The ﬁrm’s MARR, which includes an allowance
for general price inﬂation, is 15% per year (im). No
market value is expected from the heat pump at the

Chrysler is considering a cost reduction program
with its major suppliers wherein the suppliers must
reduce the cost of the components that they furnish to
Chrysler by 5% each year. (The total amount of savings
would increase each year.) The initial costs for setting
up the program include the following:
• Program Setup:
$12,500,000
• Feasibility Study
(completed six months ago):
1,500,000
• Supplier Training:
7,500,000
Chrysler is currently paying a total of $85,000,000 per
year for components purchased from the vendors who
will be involved in this program. (Assume that, if the
program is not approved, the annual cost of purchased
components will remain constant at $85,000,000 per
year.) The program has been designed as a ﬁve-year
initiative, and Chrysler’s MARR for such projects is
12% (im). There will be annual operating expenses
associated with the program for further training of
vendors, updating internal documentation, and so on.
Given the projected savings in purchased components,
what would be the maximum annual operating expense
for this program such that it is marginally justiﬁed? (8.3)

yuan to the dollar. If the May 2005 undervalued yuan
were allowed to rise to its true value, Chinese imports

SPREADSHEET EXERCISES 401
would become more expensive compared to U.S.-made
products. One scenario is to allow the yuan to ﬂoat in
value against the U.S. dollar. Assume the yuan increases
in value 25% against the dollar so that the dollar is worth
0.75(8.28 yuan) = 6.21 yuan.
If an American ﬁrm buys a lot of Chinese-made
textile products for 10 yuan apiece, it would cost
10 yuan ($1 U.S./6.21 yuan) = $1.6103 per item with
the revalued yuan. The lot of 10,000 items would cost
$16,103. Before the revaluing of the yuan, each item
would have cost 10 yuan ($1 U.S./8.28 yuan) = $1.2077
per item, or $12,077 for the lot. Discuss the following
with your classmates. (8.6)
a. What happens to the cost of PRC goods in European
countries when the dollar is strong (still 8.28
yuan per dollar)? What happens when the dollar
weakens?
b. Will Americans buy the same amount of Chinese
goods when $1 U.S. = 6.21 yuan? Will this fuel

c. What happens to the PRC–U.S. trade balance if
more expensive Chinese goods are bought at the
same level as with the $1 U.S. per 8.28 yuan policy?

• The combined initial hardware and software cost is
$80,000.
• Contingency costs have been set at $15,000. These are
not necessarily incurred.
• A service contract on the hardware costs $500 per
month.
• The effective income tax rate (t) is 38%.
• Company management has established a 15% (= im)

In addition, the following assumptions and projections
have been made:
• In order to support the system on an ongoing basis,
a programmer/analyst will be required. The starting
salary (ﬁrst year) is $28,000, and fringe beneﬁts

to increase by 6% each year thereafter.
• The system is expected to yield a staff savings of three
persons (to be reduced through normal attrition) at
an average salary of $16,200 per year per person (base
salary plus fringes) in year-zero (base year) dollars.
It is anticipated that one person will retire during the
second year, another in the third year, and a third in
the fourth year.
• A 3% reduction in purchased material costs is
expected;
ﬁrst year purchases are $1,000,000 in
year-zero dollars and are expected to grow at a
compounded rate of 10% per year.
• The project life is expected to be six years, and the
computer capital investment will be fully depreciated

CHAPTER 9
Replacement Analysis
The objective of Chapter 9 is to address the question of whether a currently
owned asset should be kept in service or immediately replaced.
New Flood Control Pumps
A
fter Hurricane Katrina there was a need to replace outdated
hydraulic ﬂood control pumps in New Orleans. These old
pumps are powered by pressurized oil, and they can be
replaced by a newer and more expensive type of pump that utilizes an up-to-
date drive design having solid drive shafts instead of pressurized oil. This chapter
deals with systematic and formal comparisons of replacement alternatives such as
the one in New Orleans. Such studies can lead to enormous savings in subsequent
operating and ownership costs to an organization.

If you need a new machine and don’t buy it, you pay for it without ever getting
the machine.
—Henry Ford (1922)
9.1 Introduction
A decision situation often encountered in business ﬁrms and government
organizations, as well as by individuals, is whether an existing asset should be
retiredfrom use, continued in service, or replaced with a new asset.As the pressures
of worldwide competition continue to increase, requiring higher quality goods
and services, shorter response times, and other changes, this type of decision is
occurring more frequently. Thus, the replacement problem, as it is commonly called,
requires careful engineering economy studies to provide the information needed
to make sound decisions that improve the operating efﬁciency and the competitive
position of an enterprise.
Engineering economy studies of replacement situations are performed using
the same basic methods as other economic studies involving two or more
alternatives. Often the decision is whether to replace an existing (old) asset,
descriptively called the defender, with a new asset. The one or more alternative
replacement (new) assets are then called challengers.
The speciﬁc decision situation, however, occurs in different forms. Sometimes
it may be whether to retire an asset without replacement (abandonment) or to retain
the asset for backup rather than primary use. Also, the decision may be inﬂuenced
if changed production requirements can be met by augmenting the capacity or
capability of the existing asset(s).
9.2 Reasons for Replacement Analysis
The need to evaluate the replacement, retirement, or augmentation of assets
results from changes in the economics of their use in an operating environment.
Various reasons can underlie these changes, and unfortunately they are sometimes
accompanied by unpleasant ﬁnancial facts. The following are the three major
reasons that summarize most of the factors involved:
1. Physical Impairment (Deterioration) These are changes that occur in the
physical condition of an asset. Normally, continued use (aging) results in the less
efﬁcient operation of an asset. Routine maintenance and breakdown repair costs
increase, energy use may increase, more operator time may be required, and so
forth. Or, some unexpected incident such as an accident occurs that affects the
physical condition and the economics of ownership and use of the asset.
404

SECTION 9.3 / FACTORS THAT MUST BE CONSIDERED IN REPLACEMENT STUDIES
405
2. Altered Requirements Capital assets are used to produce goods and services that
satisfy human wants. When the demand for a good or service either increases
or decreases or the design of a good or service changes, the related asset(s) may
have the economics of its use affected.
3. Technology The impact of changes in technology varies among different types
of assets. For example, the relative efﬁciency of heavy highway construction
equipment is impacted less rapidly by technological changes than automated
manufacturing equipment. In general, the costs per unit of production, as well
as quality and other factors, are favorably impacted by changes in technology,
which result in more frequent replacement of existing assets with new and better
challengers.
Reason 2 (altered requirements) and Reason 3 (technology) are sometimes referred
to as different categories of obsolescence. In any replacement problem, factors from
more than one of these three major areas may be involved. Regardless of the speciﬁc
considerations, the replacement of assets often represents an economic opportunity
for the ﬁrm.
For the purposes of our discussion of replacement studies, the following is a
distinction between various types of lives for typical assets:
Economic life is the period of time (years) that results in the minimum
equivalent uniform annual cost (EUAC) of owning and operating an asset.∗If we
assume good asset management, economic life should coincide with the period of
time extending from the date of acquisition to the date of abandonment, demotion
in use, or replacement from the primary intended service.
Ownership life is the period between the date of acquisition and the date of
disposal by a speciﬁc owner. A given asset may have different categories of use by
the owner during this period. For example, a car may serve as the primary family
car for several years and then serve only for local commuting for several more years.
Physical life is the period between original acquisition and ﬁnal disposal of an
asset over its succession of owners. For example, the car just described may have
several owners over its existence.
Useful life is the time period (years) that an asset is kept in productive service
(either primary or backup). It is an estimate of how long an asset is expected to be
used in a trade or business to produce income.
9.3 Factors that Must Be Considered
in Replacement Studies
There are several factors that must be considered in replacement studies. Once a
proper perspective has been established regarding these factors, little difﬁculty
should be experienced in making replacement studies. Six factors and related
concepts are discussed in this section:
1. Recognition and acceptance of past errors
2. Sunk costs
∗The AW of a primarily cost cash-ﬂow pattern is sometimes called the EUAC. Because this term is commonly used in
the deﬁnition of the economic life of an asset, we will often use EUAC in this chapter.

406
CHAPTER 9 / REPLACEMENT ANALYSIS
3. Existing asset value and the outsider viewpoint
4. Economic life of the proposed replacement asset (challenger)
5. Remaining (economic) life of the old asset (defender)
6. Income tax considerations
9.3.1
Past Estimation Errors
The economic focus in a replacement study is the future. Any estimation errors made
in a previous study related to the defender are not relevant (unless there are income
tax implications). For example, when an asset’s book value (BV) is greater than its
current market value (MV), the difference frequently has been designated as an
estimation error. Such errors also arise when capacity is inadequate, maintenance
expenses are higher than anticipated, and so forth.
This implication is unfortunate because in most cases these differences are not
the result of errors but of the inability to foresee future conditions better at the
time of the original estimates. Acceptance of unfavorable economic realities may
be made easier by posing a hypothetical question, What will be the costs of my
competitor who has no past errors to consider? In other words, we must decide
whether we wish to live in the past, with its errors and discrepancies, or to be in
a sound competitive position in the future. A common reaction is, I can’t afford to
take the loss in value of the existing asset that will result if the replacement is made.
The fact is that the loss already has occurred, whether or not it could be afforded,
and it exists whether or not the replacement is made.
9.3.2
The Sunk-Cost Trap
Only present and future cash ﬂows should be considered in replacement studies.
Any unamortized values (i.e., unallocated value of an asset’s capital investment)
of an existing asset under consideration for replacement are strictly the result of
past decisions—that is, the initial decision to invest in that asset and decisions
as to the method and number of years to be used for depreciation purposes. For
purposes of this chapter, we deﬁne a sunk cost to be the difference between an
asset’s BV and its MV at a particular point in time. Sunk costs have no relevance
to the replacement decisions that must be made (except to the extent that they affect
income taxes). When income tax considerations are involved, we must include the
sunk cost in the engineering economy study. Clearly, serious errors can be made in
practice when sunk costs are incorrectly handled in replacement studies.
9.3.3
Investment Value of Existing Assets
and the Outsider Viewpoint
Recognition of the nonrelevance of BVs and sunk costs leads to the proper
viewpointtouseinplacing value on existing assets for replacement study purposes.
In this chapter, we use the so-called outsider viewpoint for approximating the
investment worth of an existing asset (defender). In particular, the outsider
viewpoint∗is the perspective that would be taken by an impartial third party to
∗The outsider viewpoint is also known as the opportunity cost approach to determining the value of the defender.

SECTION 9.3 / FACTORS THAT MUST BE CONSIDERED IN REPLACEMENT STUDIES
407
establish the fair MV of a used (secondhand) asset. This viewpoint forces the analyst
to focus on present and future cash ﬂows in a replacement study, thus avoiding the
temptation to dwell on past (sunk) costs.
The present realizable MV is the correct capital investment amount to be assigned
to an existing asset in replacement studies.∗A good way to reason that this is true
is to use the opportunity cost or opportunity forgone principle. That is, if it is decided to
keep the existing asset, we are giving up the opportunity to obtain its net realizable
MV at that time. Therefore, this situation represents the opportunity cost of keeping
the defender.
There is one addendum to this rationale: If any new investment expenditure
(such as for overhaul) is needed to upgrade the existing asset so that it will be
competitive in level of service with the challenger, the extra amount should be
added to the present realizable MV to determine the total investment in the existing
asset for replacement study purposes.
When using the outsider viewpoint, the total investment in the defender is the
opportunity cost of not selling the existing asset for its current MV, plus the cost
of upgrading it to be competitive with the best available challenger. (All feasible
challengers are to be considered.)
Clearly, the MV of the defender must not also be claimed as a reduction in
the challenger’s capital investment, because doing so would provide an unfair
advantage to the challenger by double counting the defender’s selling price.
EXAMPLE 9-1
Investment Cost of the Defender (Existing Asset)
The purchase price of a certain new automobile (challenger) being considered for
use in your business is $21,000. Your ﬁrm’s present automobile (defender) can
be sold on the open market for $10,000. The defender was purchased with cash
three years ago, and its current BV is $12,000. To make the defender comparable
in continued service to the challenger, your ﬁrm would need to make some
repairs at an estimated cost of $1,500.
Based on this information,
(a) What is the total capital investment in the defender, using the outsider
viewpoint?
(b) What is the unamortized value of the defender?
Solution
(a) The total capital investment in the defender (if kept) is its current MV (an
opportunity cost) plus the cost of upgrading the car to make it comparable in
service to the challenger. Hence, the total capital investment in the defender
is $10,000 + $1,500 = $11,500 (from an outsider’s viewpoint). This represents
a good starting point for estimating the cost of keeping the defender.
∗In after-tax replacement studies, the before-tax MV is modiﬁed by income tax effects related to potential gains (losses)
forgone if the defender is kept in service.

408
CHAPTER 9 / REPLACEMENT ANALYSIS
(b) The unamortized value of the defender is the book loss (if any) associated
with disposing of it. Given that the defender is sold for $10,000, the
unamortized value (loss) is $12,000−$10,000 = $2,000. This is the difference
between the current MV and the current BV of the defender. As discussed in
Section 9.3.2, this amount represents a sunk cost and has no relevance to the
replacement decision, except to the extent that it may impact income taxes
(to be discussed in Section 9.9).
9.3.4
Economic Life of the Challenger
The economic life of an asset minimizes the EUAC of owning and operating the
asset, and it is often shorter than the useful or physical life. It is essential to know
a challenger’s economic life, in view of the principle that new and existing assets
shouldbecomparedovertheireconomic(optimum)lives. Economicdataregarding
challengers are periodically updated (often annually), and replacement studies are
then repeated to ensure an ongoing evaluation of improvement opportunities.
9.3.5
Economic Life of the Defender
As we shall see later in this chapter, the economic life of the defender is often one
year. Consequently, care must be taken when comparing the defender asset with a
challenger asset, because different lives (Chapter 6) are involved in the analysis. We
shall see that the defender should be kept longer than its apparent economic life,
as long as its marginal cost is less than the minimum EUAC of the challenger over
its economic life. What assumptions are involved when two assets having different
apparent economic lives are compared, given that the defender is a nonrepeating
asset? These concepts will be discussed in Section 9.7.
9.3.6
The Importance of Income Tax Consequences
The replacement of assets often results in gains or losses from the sale of depreciable
property, as discussed in Chapter 7. Consequently, to perform an accurate economic
analysis in such cases, the studies must be made on an after-tax basis. It is evident
that the existence of a taxable gain or loss, in connection with replacement, can have
a considerable effect on the results of an engineering study. Aprospective gain from
the disposal of assets can be reduced by as much as 40% or 50%, depending on the
effective income tax rate used in a particular study. Hence, the decision to dispose
of or retain an existing asset can be inﬂuenced by income tax considerations.
9.4
Typical Replacement Problems
The following typical replacement situations are used to illustrate several of the
factors that must be considered in replacement studies. These analyses use the
outsider viewpoint to determine the investment in the defenders.

SECTION 9.4 / TYPICAL REPLACEMENT PROBLEMS
409
EXAMPLE 9-2
Replacement Analysis Using Present Worth (Before Taxes)
Aﬁrm owns a pressure vessel that it is contemplating replacing. The old pressure
vessel has annual operating and maintenance expenses of $60,000 per year and it
can be kept for ﬁve more years, at which time it will have zero MV. It is believed
that $30,000 could be obtained for the old pressure vessel if it were sold now.
A new pressure vessel can be purchased for $120,000. The new pressure
vessel will have an MV of $50,000 in ﬁve years and will have annual operating
and maintenance expenses of $30,000 per year. Using a before-tax MARR of 20%
per year, determine whether or not the old pressure vessel should be replaced.
A study period of ﬁve years is appropriate.
Solution
The ﬁrst step in the analysis is to determine the investment value of the defender
(old pressure vessel). Using the outsider viewpoint, the investment value of the
defender is $30,000, its present MV. We can now compute the PW (or FW or AW)
of each alternative and decide whether the old pressure vessel should be kept
in service or replaced immediately.
Defender: PW(20%) = −$30,000 −$60,000(P/A, 20%, 5)
= −$209,436.
Challenger: PW(20%) = −$120,000 −$30,000(P/A, 20%, 5)
+ $50,000(P/F, 20%, 5) = −$189,623.
The PW of the challenger is greater (less negative) than the PW of the defender.
Thus, the old pressure vessel should be replaced immediately. (The EUAC of
the defender is $70,035 and that of the challenger is $63,410.)
EXAMPLE 9-3
Before-Tax Replacement Analysis Using EUAC
The manager of a carpet manufacturing plant became concerned about the
operationofacriticalpumpinoneoftheprocesses.Afterdiscussingthissituation
with the supervisor of plant engineering, they decided that a replacement study
should be done, and that a nine-year study period would be appropriate for this
situation. The company that owns the plant is using a before-tax MARR of 10%
per year for its capital investment projects.
The existing pump, Pump A, including driving motor with integrated
controls, cost $17,000 ﬁve years ago. An estimated MV of $750 could be
obtained for the pump if it were sold now. Some reliability problems have been
experienced with Pump A, including annual replacement of the impeller and
bearings at a cost of $1,750. Annual operating and maintenance expenses have
been averaging $3,250. Annual insurance and property tax expenses are 2% of
the initial capital investment. It appears that the pump will provide adequate

service for another nine years if the present maintenance and repair practice is
continued. It is estimated that if this pump is continued in service, its ﬁnal MV
after nine more years will be about $200.
An alternative to keeping the existing pump in service is to sell it
immediately and to purchase a replacement pump, Pump B, for $16,000. An
estimated MV at the end of the nine-year study period would be 20% of the initial
capital investment. Operating and maintenance expenses for the new pump are
estimated to be $3,000 per year. Annual taxes and insurance would total 2%
of the initial capital investment. The data for Example 9-3 are summarized in
Table 9-1.
Based on these data, should the defender (Pump A) be kept [and the
challenger (Pump B) not purchased], or should the challenger be purchased now
(and the defender sold)? Use a before-tax analysis and the outsider viewpoint
in the evaluation.
Solution
In an analysis of the defender and challenger, care must be taken to correctly
identify the investment amount in the existing pump. Based on the outsider
viewpoint, this would be the current MV of $750; that is, the opportunity cost
of keeping the defender. Note that the investment amount of Pump A ignores
the original purchase price of $17,000. Using the principles discussed thus far, a
before-tax analysis of EUAC of Pump A and Pump B can now be made.

SECTION 9.5 / DETERMINING THE ECONOMIC LIFE OF A NEW ASSET (CHALLENGER) 411
The solution of Example 9-3 using EUAC (before taxes) as the decision
criterion follows:

$5,862
Because Pump A has the smaller EUAC ($5,455 < $5,862), the replacement
pump is apparently not justiﬁed and the defender should be kept at least one
more year. We could also make the analysis using other methods (e.g., PW), and
the indicated choice would be the same.
9.5
Determining the Economic Life of a New
Asset (Challenger)
Sometimes in practice the useful lives of the defender and the challenger(s) are not known
and cannot be reasonably estimated. The time an asset is kept in productive service
might be extended indeﬁnitely with adequate maintenance and other actions, or
itmightbesuddenlyjeopardizedbyanexternalfactorsuchastechnologicalchange.
It is important to know the economic life, minimum EUAC, and total year-by-
year (marginal) costs for both the best challenger and the defender so that they
can be compared on the basis of an evaluation of their economic lives and the costs most
favorable to each.
The economic life of an asset was deﬁned in Section 9.2 as the time that results
in the minimum EUAC of owning and operating the asset. Also, the economic
life is sometimes called the minimum-cost life or optimum replacement interval.
For a new asset, its EUAC can be computed if the capital investment, annual
expenses, and year-by-year MVs are known or can be estimated. The apparent
difﬁculties of estimating these values in practice may discourage performing the
economic life and equivalent cost calculations. Similar difﬁculties, however, are
encountered in most engineering economy studies when estimating the future
economic consequences of alternative courses of action. Therefore, the estimating
problems in replacement analysis are not unique and can be overcome in most
application studies (see Chapter 3).
The estimated initial capital investment, as well as the annual expense and MV
estimates, may be used to determine the PW through year k of total costs, PWk.

412
CHAPTER 9 / REPLACEMENT ANALYSIS
That is, on a before-tax basis,
PWk(i%) = I −MVk(P/F, i%, k) +
k
!
j=1
Ej(P/F, i%, j),
(9-1)
which is the sum of the initial capital investment, I, (PW of the initial investment
amounts, if any, that occur after time zero) adjusted by the PW of the MV at the end
of year k, and of the PW of annual expenses (Ej) through year k. The total marginal
cost for each year k, TCk, is calculated using Equation (9-1) by ﬁnding the increase
in the PW of total cost from year k−1 to year k and then determining the equivalent
worth of this increase at the end of year k. That is, TCk = (PWk−PWk−1)(F/P, i%, k).
The algebraic simpliﬁcation of this relationship results in the formula
TCk(i%) = MVk−1 −MVk + iMVk−1 + Ek,
(9-2)
which is the sum of the loss in MV during the year of service, the opportunity
cost of capital invested in the asset at the beginning of year k, and the annual
expenses incurred in year k (Ek). These total marginal (or year-by-year) costs,
according to Equation (9-2), are then used to ﬁnd the EUAC of each year prior
to and including year k. The minimum EUACk value during the useful life of the
asset identiﬁes its economic life, N∗
C. This procedure is illustrated in Examples 9-4
and 9-5.
EXAMPLE 9-4
Economic Life of a Challenger (New Asset)
Anew forklift truck will require an investment of $30,000 and is expected to have
year-end MVs and annual expenses as shown in columns 2 and 5, respectively,
of Table 9-2. If the before-tax MARR is 10% per year, how long should the asset
be retained in service? Solve by hand and by spreadsheet.

SECTION 9.5 / DETERMINING THE ECONOMIC LIFE OF A NEW ASSET (CHALLENGER) 413
Solution by Hand
The solution to this problem is obtained by completing columns 3, 4, 6
[Equation (9-2)], and 7 of Table 9-2. In the solution, the customary year-end
occurrence of all cash ﬂows is assumed. The loss in MV during year k is simply
the difference between the beginning-of-year market value, MVk−1, and the
end-of-year market value, MVk. The opportunity cost of capital in year k is
10% of the capital unrecovered (invested in the asset) at the beginning of each
year. The values in column 7 are the EUACs that would be incurred each year
(1 to k) if the asset were retained in service through year k and then replaced (or
retired) at the end of the year. The minimum EUAC occurs at the end of year N∗
C.
It is apparent from the values shown in column 7 that the new forklift
truck will have a minimum EUAC if it is kept in service for only three years
(i.e., N∗
C = 3).
Spreadsheet Solution
Figure 9-1 illustrates the use of a spreadsheet to solve for the economic life of the
asset described in Example 9-4. The capital recovery formula in column C uses
absolute addressing for the original capital investment and relative addressing
to obtain the current year market value. Column E calculates the PW of the
Figure 9-1
Spreadsheet Solution, Example 9-4

414
CHAPTER 9 / REPLACEMENT ANALYSIS
annual expense values in column D. Column F determines the EUAC of the
annual expenses. The cumulative EUAC column (G) is the sum of columns C
and F. The IF function in column H places a label that identiﬁes the minimum
EUAC value, which corresponds to the economic life of the asset.
The computational approach in the preceding example, as shown in Table 9-2,
was to determine the total marginal cost for each year and then to convert these into
an EUAC through year k. The before-tax EUAC for any life can also be calculated
using the more familiar capital recovery formula presented in Chapter 5. For
example, for a life of two years, the EUAC can be calculated with the help of
Equation (5-5), as follows:
EUAC2(10%) = $30,000(A/P, 10%, 2) −$16,875(A/F, 10%, 2)
+ [$3,000(P/F, 10%, 1) + $4,500(P/F, 10%, 2)]
× (A/P, 10%, 2) = $12,964.
This agrees with the corresponding row in column 7 of Table 9-2.
EXAMPLE 9-5

Determine the economic life of an $800 laptop computer. Your personal interest

EUAC2(10%) = [$430(P/F, 10%, 1) + $410(P/F, 10%, 2)](A/P, 10%, 2) = $420
EUAC3(10%) = [$420(P/A, 10%, 2) + $595(P/F, 10%, 3)](A/P, 10%, 3) = $473
Therefore, based upon economics alone, the computer should be kept for two
years before being replaced.
Although the differences in the EUACk(10%) values may seem small enough
to make this analysis not worth the effort, consider the viewpoint of an
international company that supplies its employees with laptop computers. The
money saved by replacing the computer after two years (as opposed to keeping
it for a third year) becomes signiﬁcant when you are considering hundreds (or
even thousands) of computers company-wide. This also applies to the thousands
of college students who need to purchase laptop computers.
9.6
Determining the Economic Life of a Defender
In replacement analyses, we must also determine the economic life (N∗
D) that is
most favorable to the defender. This gives us the choice of keeping the defender as
long as its EUAC at N∗
D is less than the minimum EUAC of the challenger. When a
major outlay for defender alteration or overhaul is needed, the life that will yield
the minimum EUAC is likely to be the period that will elapse before the next major
alteration or overhaul is needed. Alternatively, when there is no defender MV now or
later (and no outlay for alteration or overhaul) and when the defender’s operating expenses
are expected to increase annually, the remaining life that will yield the minimum EUAC
will be one year.
When MVs are greater than zero and expected to decline from year to year, it
is necessary to calculate the apparent remaining economic life, which is done in
the same manner as for a new asset. Using the outsider viewpoint, the investment
value of the defender is considered to be its present realizable MV.
Regardless of how the remaining economic life for the defender is determined, a
decision to keep the defender does not mean that it should be kept only for this
period of time. Indeed, the defender should be kept longer than the apparent
economic life as long as its marginal cost (total cost for an additional year of
service) is less than the minimum EUAC for the best challenger.
This important principle of replacement analysis is illustrated in Example 9-6.
EXAMPLE 9-6
Economic Life of a Defender (Existing Asset)
It is desired to determine how much longer a forklift truck should remain in
service before it is replaced by the new truck (challenger) for which data were
given in Example 9-4 and Table 9-2. The defender in this case is two years old,

CHAPTER 9 / REPLACEMENT ANALYSIS
originally cost $19,500, and has a present realizable MV of $7,500. If kept, its
MVs and annual expenses are expected to be as follows:

Determine the most economical period to keep the defender before replacing
it (if at all) with the present challenger of Example 9-4. The before-tax cost of
capital (MARR) is 10% per year.
Solution
Table 9-3 shows the calculation of total cost for each year (marginal cost) and
the EUAC at the end of each year for the defender based on the format used
in Table 9-2. Note that the minimum EUAC of $10,500 corresponds to keeping
the defender for one more year. The marginal cost of keeping the truck for the
second year is, however, $12,000, which is still less than the minimum EUAC
for the challenger (i.e., $12,918, from Example 9-4). The marginal cost for keeping
the defender the third year and beyond is greater than the $12,918 minimum
EUAC for the challenger. Based on the available data shown, it would be most
economical to keep the defender for two more years and then to replace it with
the challenger.

difference in costs continues to grow and replacement becomes more urgent. This
is illustrated to the right of the intersection in Figure 9-2.
Figure 9-3 illustrates the effect of improved new challengers in the future. If an
improved challenger X becomes available before replacement with the new asset
of Figure 9-2, then a new replacement study should take place to consider the
improved challenger. If there is a possibility of a further-improved challenger Y
as of, say, four years later, it may be better still to postpone replacement until
that challenger becomes available. Although retention of the old asset beyond
its breakeven point with the best available challenger has a cost that may well
grow with time, this cost of waiting can, in some instances, be worthwhile if it

418
CHAPTER 9 / REPLACEMENT ANALYSIS
permits the purchase of an improved asset having economies that offset the cost
of waiting. Of course, a decision to postpone a replacement may also “buy time
and information.” Because technological change tends to be sudden and dramatic
rather than uniform and gradual, new challengers with signiﬁcantly improved
features can arise sporadically and can change replacement plans substantially.
When replacement is not signaled by the engineering economy study, more
information may become available before the next analysis of the defender. Hence,
the next study should include any additional information. Postponement generally
should mean a postponement of the decision on when to replace, not the decision
to postpone replacement until a speciﬁed future date.
9.7
Comparisons in Which the Defender’s Useful Life
Differs from that of the Challenger
In Section 9.4, we discussed a typical replacement situation in which the useful
lives of the defender and the challenger were known and were the same, as well
as equal to the study period. When this situation occurs, any of the equivalence
methods, properly applied, may be used.
In the previous two sections (9.5 and 9.6), we discussed the economic lives of
a new asset and of a defender and how these results (along with the related cost
information) are used in replacement analysis when the useful lives of the assets
may or may not be known.
A third situation occurs when the useful lives of the best challenger and the defender
are known, or can be estimated, but are not the same. The comparison of the challenger
and the defender under these circumstances is the topic of this section.
In Chapter 6, two assumptions used for the economic comparisons of
alternatives, including those having different useful lives, were described: (1)
repeatability and (2) cotermination. Under either assumption, the analysis period
used is the same for all alternatives in the study. The repeatability assumption,
however, involves two main stipulations:
1. The period of needed service for which the alternatives are being compared is
either indeﬁnitely long or a length of time equal to a common multiple of the
useful lives of the alternatives.
2. What is estimated to happen in the ﬁrst useful life span will happen in all
succeeding life spans, if any, for each alternative.
For replacement analyses, the ﬁrst of these conditions may be acceptable, but
normally the second is not reasonable for the defender. The defender is typically
an older and used piece of equipment. An identical replacement, even if it could
be found, probably would have an installed cost in excess of the current MV of the
defender.
Failure to meet the second stipulation can be circumvented if the period of
needed service is assumed to be indeﬁnitely long and if we recognize that the analysis
is really to determine whether now is the time to replace the defender. When the defender
is replaced, either now or at some future date, it will be by the challenger—the best
available replacement.

Example 9-6, involving a before-tax analysis of the defender versus a challenger
forklift truck, made implicit use of the repeatability assumption. That is, it was
assumed that the particular challenger analyzed in Table 9-2 would have a
minimum EUAC of $12,918 regardless of when it replaces the defender. Figure 9-4
shows time diagrams of the cost consequences of keeping the defender for two
more years versus adopting the challenger now, with the challenger costs to be
repeated in the indeﬁnite future. Recall that the economic life of the challenger is
three years. It can be seen in Figure 9-4 that the only difference between the alternatives
is in years one and two.
The repeatability assumption, applied to replacement problems involving
assets with different useful or economic lives, often simpliﬁes the economic
comparison of the alternatives. For example, the comparison of the PW values of
the alternatives in Figure 9-4 over an inﬁnite analysis period (refer to the capitalized
worth calculation in Chapter 5) will conﬁrm our previous answer to Example 9-6
that Alternative A (keep defender for two more years) is preferred to Alternative B
(replace with challenger now). Using a MARR = 10% per year, we have
PWA(10%) = −$10,500(P/F, 10%, 1) −$12,000(P/F, 10%, 2)
−$12,918
0.10
(P/F, 10%, 2)
= −$126,217;
PWB(10%) = −$12,918
0.10
= −$129,180.
The difference (PWB −PWA) is −$2,963, which conﬁrms that the additional cost
of the challenger over the next two years is not justiﬁed and it is best to keep the
defender for two more years before replacing it with the challenger.

420
CHAPTER 9 / REPLACEMENT ANALYSIS
Whenever the repeatability assumption is not applicable, the coterminated
assumption may be used; it involves using a ﬁnite study period for all
alternatives. When the effects of price changes and taxes are to be considered
in replacement studies, it is recommended that the coterminated assumption be
used.
EXAMPLE 9-7
Replacement Analysis Using the Coterminated Assumption
Suppose that we are faced with the same replacement problem as in Example 9-6,
except that the period of needed service is (a) three years or (b) four years. That
is, a ﬁnite analysis period under the coterminated assumption is being used. In
each case, which alternative should be selected?
Solution
(a) For a planning horizon of three years, we might intuitively think that
either the defender should be kept for three years or it should be replaced
immediately by the challenger to serve for the next three years. From
Table 9-3, the EUAC for the defender for three years is $11,950; from
Table 9-2, the EUAC for the challenger for three years is $12,918. Thus,
following this reasoning, the defender would be kept for three years. This,
however, is not quite right. Focusing on the Total (Marginal) Cost for Each
Year columns, we can see that the defender has the lowest cost in the ﬁrst
two years, but in the third year its cost is $13,650; the EUAC of one year
of service for the challenger is only $13,500. Hence, it would be more
economical to replace the defender after the second year. This conclusion
can be conﬁrmed by enumerating all replacement possibilities and their
respective costs and then computing the EUAC for each, as will be done for
the four-year planning horizon in Part (b).

SECTION 9.8 / RETIREMENT WITHOUT REPLACEMENT (ABANDONMENT) 421
(b) For a planning horizon of four years, the alternatives and their respective
costs for each year and the EUAC of each are given in Table 9-4. Thus, the
most economical alternative is to keep the defender for two years and then
replace it with the challenger, to be kept for the next two years. The decision
to keep the defender for two years happens to be the same as when the
repeatability assumption was used, which, of course, would not be true in
general.
When a replacement analysis involves a defender that cannot be continued in
service because of changes in technology, service requirements, and so on, a choice
among two or more new challengers must be made. Under this situation, the
repeatability assumption may be a convenient economic modeling approach for
comparing the alternatives and making a present decision. Note that, when the
defender is not a feasible alternative, the replacement problem is no different than
any other analysis involving mutually exclusive alternatives.
9.8
Retirement without Replacement (Abandonment)
Consider a project for which the period of required service is ﬁnite and that has
positive net cash ﬂows following an initial capital investment. Market values, or
abandonment values, are estimated for the end of each remaining year in the
project’s life. In view of an opportunity cost (MARR) of i% per year, should the
project be undertaken? Given that we have decided to implement the project, what
is the best year to abandon the project? In other words, what is the economic life
of the project?
For this type of problem, the following assumptions are applicable:
1. Once a capital investment has been made, the ﬁrm desires to postpone the
decision to abandon a project as long as its present equivalent value (PW) is not
decreasing.
2. The existing project will be terminated at the best abandonment time and will
not be replaced by the ﬁrm.
Solving the abandonment problem is similar to determining the economic life of
an asset. In abandonment problems, however, annual beneﬁts (cash inﬂows) are
present, but in economic life analysis, costs (cash outﬂows) are dominant. In both
cases, the objective is to increase the overall wealth of the ﬁrm by ﬁnding the life
that maximizes proﬁts or, equivalently, minimizes costs.
EXAMPLE 9-8
When to Retire an Asset (No Replacement)
An $80,000 baling machine for recycled paper was purchased by the XYZ
company two years ago. The current MV of the machine is $50,000, and it can be
kept in service for seven more years. MARR is 12% per year and the projected
net annual receipts (revenues less expenses) and end-of-year market values for

Solution
The PWs that result from deciding now to keep the machine exactly one, two,
three, four, ﬁve, six, and seven years are as follows:
Keep for one year:
PW(12%) = −$50,000 + ($20,000 + $40,000)(P/F, 12%, 1) = $3,571.
Keep for two years:
PW(12%) = −$50,000 + $20,000(P/F, 12%, 1) + ($20,000 + $32,000)
× (P/F, 12%, 2) = $9,311.
In the same manner, the PW for years three through seven can be computed.
The results are as follows.
Keep for three years: PW(12%) = $14,408
Keep for four years: PW(12%) = $18,856
Keep for ﬁve years: PW(12%) = $21,466 ←Best abandonment time
Keep for six years: PW(12%) = $21,061
Keep for seven years: PW(12%) = $19,614
As you can see, PW is maximized ($21,466) by retaining the machine for ﬁve
years. Thus, the best abandonment time for this project would be in ﬁve years.
9.9
After-Tax Replacement Studies
As discussed in Chapter 7, income taxes associated with a proposed project may
represent a major cash outﬂow for a ﬁrm. Therefore, income taxes should be
considered along with all other relevant cash ﬂows when assessing the economic
proﬁtability of a project. This fact also holds true for replacement decisions.
The replacement of an asset often results in gains or losses from the sale of the
existing asset (defender). The income tax consequence resulting from the gain (loss)
associated with the sale (or retention) of the defender has the potential to impact
the decision to keep the defender or to sell it and purchase the challenger. The

SECTION 9.9 / AFTER-TAX REPLACEMENT STUDIES
423
remainder of this section is devoted to demonstrating the procedure for performing
replacement analyses on an after-tax basis. Note that after-tax replacement analyses
require knowledge of the depreciation schedule already in use for the defender, as
well as the appropriate depreciation schedule to be used for the challenger.
9.9.1
After-Tax Economic Life
In earlier sections, the economic life of a new asset (Examples 9-4 and 9-5) and the
economic life of an existing asset (Example 9-6) were determined on a before-tax
basis. An after-tax analysis, however, can also be used to determine the economic
life of an asset by extending Equation (9-1) to account for income tax effects:
PWk(i%) = I +
k
!
j=1
[(1 −t)Ej −tdj](P/F, i%, j) −[(1 −t)MVk + t(BVk)](P/F, i%, k).
(9-3)
This computation ﬁnds the PW of the after-tax cash ﬂows (ATCFs, expressed as
costs) through year k, PWk, by (1) adding the initial capital investment, I, (PW of
investment amounts if any that occur after time zero) and the sum of the after-
tax PW of annual expenses through year k, including adjustments for annual
depreciation amounts (dj), and then (2) adjusting this total after-tax PW of costs
by the after-tax consequences of gain or loss on disposal of the asset at the end of
year k. Similar to the previous before-tax analysis using Equation (9-1), Equation
(9-3) is used to develop the after-tax total marginal cost for each year k, TCk. That is,
TCk = (PWk −PWk−1)(F/P, i%, k). The algebraic simpliﬁcation of this relationship
results in Equation (9-4):
TCk(i%) = (1 −t)(MVk−1 −MVk + iMVk−1 + Ek) + i(t)(BVk−1).
(9-4)
Equation (9-4) is (1 −t) times Equation (9-2) plus interest on the tax adjustment
from the BV of the asset at the beginning of year k. A tabular format incorporating
Equation (9-4) is used in the solution of the next example to ﬁnd the economic life
of a new asset on an after-tax basis (N∗
AT). This same procedure can also be used to
ﬁnd the after-tax economic life of an existing asset.
EXAMPLE 9-9
After-Tax Economic Life of an Asset
Find the economic life on an after-tax basis for the new forklift truck (challenger)
described in Example 9-4. Assume that the new forklift is depreciated as a
MACRS (GDS)∗three-year property class asset, the effective income tax rate
is 40%, and the after-tax MARR is 6% per year.
Solution
The calculations using Equation (9-4) are shown in Table 9-5. The expected year-
by-year MVs and annual expenses are repeated from Example 9-4 in columns 2
∗In Chapter 7, the GDS (general depreciation system) andADS (alternative depreciation system) are discussed.

and 5, respectively. In column 6, the sum of the loss in MV during year k, cost of
capital based on the MV at the beginning-of-year (BOY) k, and annual expenses
in year k are multiplied by (1 −t) to determine an approximate after-tax total
marginal cost in year k.
The BV amounts at the end of each year, based on the new forklift truck
being a MACRS (GDS) three-year property class asset, are shown in column 7.
These amounts are then used in column 8 to determine an annual tax adjustment
[last term in Equation (9-4)], based on the beginning of year (BOY) book values
(BVk−1). This annual tax adjustment is algebraically added to the entry in
column 6 to obtain an adjusted after-tax total marginal cost in year k, TCk. The
total marginal cost amounts are used in column 10 to calculate, successively, the
EUACk of retirement of the asset at the end of year k. In this case, the after-tax
economic life (N∗
AT) is three years, the same result obtained on a before-tax basis
in Example 9-4.

SECTION 9.9 / AFTER-TAX REPLACEMENT STUDIES
425
It is not uncommon for the before-tax and after-tax economic lives of an asset
to be the same (as occurred in Examples 9-4 and 9-9).
9.9.2
After-Tax Investment Value of the Defender
The outsider viewpoint has been used in this chapter to establish a before-tax
investment value of an existing asset. Using this viewpoint, the present realizable
MV of the defender is the appropriate before-tax investment value. This value
(although not an actual cash ﬂow) represents the opportunity cost of keeping
the defender. In determining the after-tax investment value, we must also include
the opportunity cost of gains (losses) not realized if the defender is kept [Chapter 7,
Section 7.8].
Consider, for example, a printing machine that was purchased three years
ago for $30,000. It has a present MV of $5,000 and a current BV of $8,640. If the
printing machine were sold now, the company would experience a loss on disposal
of $5,000 −$8,640 = −$3,640. Assuming a 40% effective income tax rate, this
loss would translate into a (−0.40)(−$3,640) = $1,456 tax savings. Thus, if it is
decided to keep the printing machine, not only would the company be giving up
the opportunity to obtain the $5,000 MV, it would also be giving up the opportunity
to obtain the $1,456 tax credit that would result from selling the printing machine
at a price less than its current BV. Thus, the total after-tax investment value of the
existing printing machine is $5,000 + $1,456 = $6,456.
The computation of the after-tax investment value of an existing asset is
quite straightforward. Using the general format for computing ATCFs presented
previously in Figure 7-5, we would have the following entries if the defender were
sold now (year zero). Note that MV0 and BV0 represent the MV and BV, respectively,
of the defender at the time of the analysis.

Now, if it was decided to keep the asset, the preceding entries become the

shown in Figure 9-5. Note that the entries in Figure 9-5 are simply the same values

CHAPTER 9 / REPLACEMENT ANALYSIS
EXAMPLE 9-10
After-Tax Investment Cost of a Defender: BV > MV
An existing asset being considered for replacement has a current MV of $12,000
and a current BV of $18,000. Determine the after-tax investment value of the
existing asset (if kept) using the outsider viewpoint and an effective income tax
rate of 34%.
Solution
Given that MV0 = $12,000, BV0 = $18,000, and t = 0.34, we can easily compute
the ATCF associated with keeping the existing asset by using the format of
Figure 9-5:

= −$2,040
= −$14,040
The appropriate after-tax investment value for the existing asset is $14,040. Note
that this is higher than the before-tax investment value of $12,000, owing to the
tax credit given up by not selling the existing machine at a loss.
EXAMPLE 9-11
After-Tax Investment Cost of a Defender: BV < MV
An engineering consulting ﬁrm is considering the replacement of its CAD
workstation. The workstation was purchased four years ago for $20,000.
Depreciation deductions have followed the MACRS (GDS) ﬁve-year property
class schedule. The workstation can be sold now for $4,000. Assuming the
effective income tax rate is 40%, compute the after-tax investment value of the
CAD workstation if it is kept.
Solution
To compute the ATCF associated with keeping the defender, we must ﬁrst
compute the current BV, BV0. The workstation has been depreciated for four
years under the MACRS (GDS) system with a ﬁve-year property class. Thus,
BV0 = $20,000(1 −0.2 −0.32 −0.192 −0.1152) = $3,456.∗
Using the format presented in Figure 9-5, we ﬁnd that the ATCF associated with
keeping the defender can be computed as follows:
∗Current tax law dictates that gains and losses be taxed as ordinary income. As a result, it is not necessary to
explicitly account for the MACRS half-year convention when computing the if sold BV (the increase in taxable
income because of a higher BV is offset by the half-year of depreciation that could be claimed if the defender is
kept). This allows us to simplify the procedure for computing the after-tax investment value of the defender.

The after-tax investment value of keeping the existing CAD workstation is
$3,782. Note that, in the case where MV0 is higher than BV0, the after-tax
investment value is lower than the before-tax investment value. This is because
the gain on disposal (and resulting tax liability) does not occur at this time if the
defender is retained.
9.9.3
Illustrative After-Tax Replacement Analyses
The following examples represent typical after-tax replacement analyses. They
illustrate the appropriate method for including the effect of income taxes, as well
as several of the factors that must be considered in general replacement studies.
EXAMPLE 9-12
After-Tax EUAC Analysis (Restatement of Example 9-3
with Tax Information)
The manager of a carpet manufacturing plant became concerned about the
operationofacriticalpumpinoneoftheprocesses.Afterdiscussingthissituation
with the supervisor of plant engineering, they decided that a replacement study
should be done and that a nine-year study period would be appropriate for this
situation. The company that owns the plant is using an after-tax MARR of 6%
per year for its capital investment projects. The effective income tax rate is 40%.
The existing pump, Pump A, including driving motor with integrated
controls,
cost $17,000 ﬁve years ago.
The accounting records show the
depreciation schedule to be following that of an asset with a MACRS (ADS)
recovery period of nine years. Some reliability problems have been experienced
with Pump A, including annual replacement of the impeller and bearings at a
cost of $1,750. Annual expenses have been averaging $3,250. Annual insurance
and property tax expenses are 2% of the initial capital investment. It appears
that the pump will provide adequate service for another nine years if the present
maintenance and repair practice is continued. An estimated MV of $750 could
be obtained for the pump if it is sold now. It is estimated that, if this pump is
continued in service, its ﬁnal MV after nine more years will be about $200.
An alternative to keeping the existing pump in service is to sell it
immediately and to purchase a replacement pump, Pump B, for $16,000. A
nine-year class life (MACRS ﬁve-year property class) would be applicable to
the new pump under the GDS. An estimated MV at the end of the nine-year
study period would be 20% of the initial capital investment. Operating and
maintenance expenses for the new pump are estimated to be $3,000 per year.

Based on these data, should the defender (Pump A) be kept [and the

Solution
The after-tax computations for keeping the defender (Pump A) and not

year-zero entries of Table 9-7 are computed using the general format presented
in Figure 9-5 and are further explained in the following:
1. BTCF (−$750):
The same amount used in the before-tax analysis of
Example 9-3. This amount is based on the outsider viewpoint and is the
opportunity cost of keeping the defender instead of replacing it (and selling
it for the estimated present MV of $750).
2. Taxable income ($7,750): This amount is the result of an increase in taxable
income of $7,750 due to the tax consequences of keeping the defender instead
of selling it. Speciﬁcally, if we sold the defender now, the loss on disposal would
be as follows:
Gain or loss on disposal (if sold now) = MV0 −BV0,
BV0 = $17,000[1 −0.0556 −4(0.1111)] = $8,500,
Loss on disposal (if sold now) = $750 −$8,500 = −$7,750.
But since we are keeping the defender (Pump A) in this alternative, we have the
reverse effect on taxable income, an increase of $7,750 due to an opportunity
forgone.
3. Cash ﬂow for income taxes (−$3,100): The increase in taxable income because
of the tax consequences of keeping the defender results in an increased tax
liability (or tax credit forgone) of −0.4($7,750) = −$3,100.
4. ATCF (−$3,850): The total after-tax investment value of the defender is
the result of two factors: the present MV ($750) and the tax credit ($3,100)
forgone by keeping the existing Pump A. Therefore, the ATCF representing
the investment in the defender (based on the outsider viewpoint) is −$750 −
$3,100 = −$3,850.
The remainders of the ATCF computations over the nine-year analysis period
for the alternative of keeping the defender are shown in Table 9-7. The after-
tax computations for the alternative of purchasing the challenger (Pump B) are
shown in Table 9-8.
The next step in an after-tax replacement study involves equivalence
calculations using an after-tax MARR. The following is the after-tax EUAC
analysis for Example 9-12:
EUAC(6% ) of Pump A(defender) = $3,850(A/P, 6%, 9)
+ $2,448(P/A, 6%, 4)(A/P, 6%, 9)
+ [$2,826(F/P, 6%, 4)

Because the EUACs of both pumps are very close, other considerations,
such as the improved reliability of the new pump, could detract from the slight
economic preference for Pump A. The after-tax annual costs of both alternatives
are considerably less than their before-tax annual costs.
The after-tax analysis does not reverse the results of the before-tax analysis
for this problem (see Example 9-3). Due to income tax considerations, however,
identical before-tax and after-tax recommendations should not necessarily be
expected.

CASE STUDY−−Replacement of a Hospital’s Emergency
Electrical Supply System
Sometimes in engineering practice a replacement analysis involves an existing
asset that cannot meet future service requirements without augmentation of its
capabilities. When this is the case, the defender with increased capability should
be competitive with the best available challenger. The analysis of this situation is
included in the following case study.

SECTION 9.10 / CASE STUDY—REPLACEMENT OF A HOSPITAL’S EMERGENCY ELECTRICAL SUPPLY SYSTEM 431
The emergency electrical supply system of a hospital owned by a medical
service corporation is presently supported by an 80-kW diesel-powered electrical
generator that was put into service ﬁve years ago [capital investment = $210,000;
MACRS (GDS) seven-year property class]. An engineering ﬁrm is designing
modiﬁcations to the electrical and mechanical systems of the hospital as part of an
expansion project. The redesigned emergency electrical supply system will require
120 kW of generating capacity to serve the increased demand. Two preliminary
designs for the system are being considered. The ﬁrst involves the augmentation of
the existing 80-kW generator with a new 40-kW diesel-powered unit (GDS seven-
year property class). This alternative represents the augmented defender. The
seconddesignincludesreplacementoftheexistinggeneratorwiththebestavailable
alternative, a new turbine-powered unit with 120 kW of generating capacity (the
challenger). Both alternatives will provide the same level of service to the operation
of the emergency electrical supply system.
The challenger, if selected, will be leased by the hospital for a 10-year period.
At that time, the lease contract would be renegotiated either for the original piece
of equipment or for a replacement generator with the same capacity. The following
additional estimates have been generated for use in the replacement analysis.

are expected to increase at the rate of 4% per year (assume base year, b, is year zero;
see Chapter 8 for dealing with price changes).
The present estimated MV of the 80-kW generator is $90,000, and its estimated
MV at the end of an additional 10 years, in year-zero dollars, is $30,000. The
estimated MV of the new 40-kW generator, 10 years from now in year-zero dollars,
is $38,000. Both future market values are estimated to increase at the rate of 2%
per year.
The corporation’s after-tax, market-based MARR (im) is 12% per year, and
its effective income tax rate is 40%. A 10-year planning horizon (study period)

is considered appropriate for this decision situation. (Note that, with income tax
considerations and price changes in the analysis, a study period based on the
coterminated assumption is being used.)
Based on an after-tax, actual-dollar analysis, which alternative (augmentation
of the defender or lease of the challenger) should be selected as part of the design
of the modiﬁed emergency electrical power system?
Solution
The after-tax analysis of the ﬁrst alternative (defender), keeping the existing 80-kW
generator and augmenting its capacity with a new 40-kW generator, is shown in
Figure 9-6. The initial $230,000 before-tax capital investment amount (cell B11) is
the sum of (1) the present $90,000 MV of the existing 80-kW generator, which is
an opportunity cost based on an outsider viewpoint, and (2) the $140,000 capital
investment for the new 40-kW generator. The −$43,145 of taxable income at time
zero (cell E11) is because of the gain on disposal, which is not incurred when the
80-kW generator is kept instead of sold. The after-tax PW of keeping the defender
and augmenting its capacity is −$282,472.
A spreadsheet analysis of the leasing alternative (challenger) is shown in
Figure 9-7. Under the contract terms for leasing the challenger, there is an initial
$10,000 deposit, which is fully refundable at the end of the 10-year period. There
are no tax consequences associated with the deposit transaction. The annual before-
tax cash ﬂow (BTCF) for the challenger is the sum of (1) the annual lease amount,
which stays constant over the 10-year contract period, and (2) the annual operating
and maintenance and other expenses, which increase at the rate of 4% per year.
For example, the BTCF for the challenger in year one is −$39,200 −[$85(260) +
$2,400](1.04) = −$64,680. These annual BTCF amounts for years one through
ten are fully deductible from taxable income by the corporation, and they are
also the taxable income amounts for the alternative (the corporation cannot claim
any depreciation on the challenger because it does not own the equipment). Hence,
the after-tax PW of selecting the challenger, assuming it is leased under these
contract terms, is −$239,695.
Based on an after-tax analysis, the challenger or a new turbine-powered
unit with 120 kW of generating capacity is economically preferable for use in
the emergency electrical supply system because its PW has the least negative
value. This case study also illustrates the importance of a life cycle costing (LCC)
approach to the economic evaluation of engineering alternatives. In the foregoing
case, not only is the initial capital investment considered but annual operating
and maintenance costs for each alternative as well. Leasing the 120-kW generator
over a 10-year period is economically preferable to the other alternatives in this
case.
9.11
Summary
In sum, there are several important points to keep in mind when conducting a
replacement or retirement study:
The MV of the defender must not also be deducted from the purchase price of
the challenger when using the outsider viewpoint to analyze a replacement problem.

434
CHAPTER 9 / REPLACEMENT ANALYSIS
Figure 9-7
Spreadsheet Analysis of the Challenger (Leasing a New Turbine-Powered Unit)
This error double-counts the defender’s MV and biases the comparison toward the
challenger.
A sunk cost (i.e., MV −BV < 0) associated with keeping the defender must not
be added to the purchase price of the best available challenger. This error results
in an incorrect penalty that biases the analysis in favor of retaining the defender.
In Section 9.6, we observed that the economic life of the defender is often one
year, which is generally true if annual expenses are high relative to the defender’s
investment cost when using the outsider viewpoint. Hence, the marginal cost of the
defender should be compared with the EUAC at the economic life of the challenger
to answer the fundamental question, Should the defender be kept for one or more
years or disposed of now? The typical pattern of the EUAC for a defender and a
challenger is illustrated in Figure 9-8.
The income tax effects of replacement decisions should not be ignored. The
forgone income tax credits associated with keeping the defender may swing
the economic preference away from the defender, thus making the challenger the
better choice.
The best available challenger(s) must be determined. Failure to do so represents
unacceptable engineering practice.

9-1. You own an old “water skiing” motor boat that is a
real gas guzzler. It is 10-years old and can be sold now
for $3,000 cash. Assume its market value (MV) in 2 years
will be $500. The annual maintenance expenses are
expected to be $400 into the foreseeable future, and the
boat averages only 2 miles per gallon of fuel. Gasoline
costs $5.00 per gallon, and the boat will be used for
about 200 miles per year.

If you sell the old boat, you can buy a newer model boat
for $10,000. It will be under a maintenance warranty for
2 years, so this expense is negligible. The newer boat
will average 10 miles per gallon of fuel and will have
an MV of $7,000 in 2 years. Use a 2-year study period to
determine which alternative is preferred. The MARR is
15% per year. State your assumptions. (9.4)
9-2. An existing robot can be kept if $2,000 is spent
now to upgrade it for future service requirements.
Alternatively, the company can purchase a new robot to
replace the old robot. The following estimates have been
developed for both the defender and the challenger.

436
CHAPTER 9 / REPLACEMENT ANALYSIS
The company’s before-tax MARR is 20% per year.
Based on this information, should the existing robot be
replaced right now? Assume the robot will be needed
for an indeﬁnite period of time. (9.7)
9-3. The Ajax Corporation has an overhead crane that
has an estimated remaining life of 10 years. The crane
can be sold now for $8,000. If the crane is kept in service,
it must be overhauled immediately at a cost of $5,000.
Operating and maintenance costs will be $3,000 per
year after the crane is overhauled. The overhauled crane
will have zero MV at the end of the 8-year study period.
A new crane will cost $20,000, will last for 8 years,
and will have a $4,000 MV at that time. Operating and
maintenance costs are $1,000 per year for the new crane.
The company uses a before-tax interest rate of 10% per
year in evaluating investment alternatives. Should the
company replace the old crane? (9.4)

b. Repeat Part (a) when the $4,000 per year is ignored.
What can you conclude about the inﬂuence of an
expense that is constant over time on the economic
life?
9-5. In a replacement analysis for a vacuum seal on
a spacecraft, the following data are known about the
challenger: the initial investment is $12,000; there is
no annual maintenance cost for the ﬁrst three years,
however, it will be $2,000 in each of years four and
ﬁve, and then $4,500 in the sixth year and increasing
by $2,500 each year thereafter. The salvage value is $0
at all times, and MARR is 10% per year. What is the
economic life of this challenger? (9.5)
9-6. A steam generation system at a biomass-
fueled power plant uses an electrostatic preci-
pitator (ESP) to clean its gaseous efﬂuents. The power
plant has consistently made use of the same type of ESP
over the past several years. The installed cost of a new
ESP has been relatively constant at $80,000. Records
of operation and maintenance expenses indicate the
following average expenses per year as a function of the
age of the ESP. The MVs of the ESP are also reasonably
well known as a function of age.

purchased two years ago for $50,000. At the present
time, it can be sold for $25,000 and replaced by a newer
model having a purchase price of $42,500; or it can be
kept in service for a maximum of one more year. The
new assembly machine, if purchased, has a useful life
of not more than two years. The projected resale values
and operating and maintenance costs for the challenger
and the defender are shown in the accompanying table
on a year-by-year basis. If the before-tax MARR is 15%,
when should the old assembly machine be replaced?

The best challenger will cost $30,000 for installation and

a $2,000 MV at that time. It is estimated that annual
expenses will average $16,000 per year. The defender

laboratory to handle ceramic samples in the high-
temperature environment that is part of several test
procedures. Due to changing customer needs, the robot
will not meet future service requirements unless it is
upgraded at a cost of $2,000. Because of this situation,
a new advanced technology robot has been selected
for potential replacement of the existing robot. The
accompanying estimates have been developed from
information provided by some current users of the new
robot and data obtained from the manufacturer. The
ﬁrm’s before-tax MARR is 25% per year. Based on this

reinforced or replaced.
Reinforcement would cost
$25,000 and would make the overpass adequate for an
additional 6 years of service. If the overpass is torn
down now, the scrap value of the steel would exceed
the removal cost by $15,000. If it is reinforced, it is
estimated that its net salvage (market) value would be
$18,000 at the time it is retired from service. A new
pre-stressed concrete overpass would cost $140,000 and
would meet the foreseeable requirements of the next
40 years. Such a design would have no net scrap or MV.
It is estimated that the annual expenses of the reinforced
overpass would exceed those of the concrete overpass
by $3,200. Assume that money costs the state 8% per
year and that the state pays no taxes. What would you
recommend? (9.4, 9.7)

27.5 miles per gallon of gasoline (the defender) for pas-
senger cars. To conserve fuel and reduce air pollution,
suppose the U.S. Congress sets the CAFE standard at
36 miles per gallon (the challenger) in 2014. An auto will
emit on average 0.9 pounds of carbon dioxide (CO2)
per mile driven at 27.5 miles per gallon, and it will
emit 0.8 pounds of CO2 per mile driven at 36 miles per
gallon. (9.4)
a. How much fuel and carbon dioxide would be saved
over the lifetime of a passenger car with the new
standard? Assume a car will be driven 99,000 miles
over its lifetime.
b. If CO2 costs $0.02/lb to capture and sequester,
what penalty does this place on the defender?
Should this penalty affect the CAFE replacement

If the after-tax MARR is 7% per year, determine
the after-tax economic life of this equipment. MACRS
(GDS) depreciation is being used (ﬁve-year property
class). The effective income tax rate is 40%. (9.9)
9-17. A current asset (defender) is being evaluated
for potential replacement. It was purchased four years
ago at a cost of $62,000. It has been depreciated as
a MACRS (GDS) ﬁve-year property-class asset. The
present MV of the defender is $12,000. Its remaining
useful life is estimated to be four years, but it will
require additional repair work now (a one-time $4,000
expense) to provide continuing service equivalent to
the challenger. The current effective income tax rate
is 39%, and the after-tax MARR = 15% per year.
Based on an outsider viewpoint, what is the after-
tax initial investment in the defender if it is kept (not
replaced now)? (9.9)

Assume the after-tax MARR is 12% per year. On
the basis of this information, answer the following
questions:
a. What are the economic life and the related minimum
EUAC when k = N∗

Part (b)?
9-19. A pharmaceutical company has some existing
semiautomated production equipment that they are
considering replacing. This equipment has a present
MV of $57,000 and a BV of $30,000. It has ﬁve more
years of straight-line depreciation available (if kept) of
$6,000 per year, at which time its BV would be $0. The
estimated MV of the equipment ﬁve years from now (in
year-zero dollars) is $18,500. The MV rate of increase
on this type of equipment has been averaging 3.2% per
year. The total operating and maintenance and other
related expenses are averaging $27,000 (A$) per year.
New automated replacement equipment would be
leased.
Estimated operating and maintenance and
related company expenses for the new equipment
are $12,200 per year. The annual leasing cost would
be $24,300. The after-tax MARR (with an inﬂation
component) is 9% per year (im); t = 40%; and the
analysis period is ﬁve years. Based on an after-tax,
A$ analysis, should the replacement be made? Base
your answer on the actual IRR of the incremental cash
ﬂow. (9.9)
9-20. It is being decided whether or not to replace
an existing piece of equipment with a newer, more
productive one that costs $80,000 and has an estimated
MV of $20,000 at the end of its useful life of six years.
Installation charges for the new equipment will amount
to $3,000; this is not added to the capital investment
but will be an expensed item during the ﬁrst year
of operation. MACRS (GDS) depreciation (ﬁve-year
property class) will be used. The new equipment will
reduce direct costs (labor, maintenance, rework, etc.) by
$10,000 in the ﬁrst year, and this amount is expected to
increase by $500 each year thereafter during its six-year
life. It is also known that the BV of the fully depreciated
old machine is $10,000 but that its present fair MV is
$14,000. The MV of the old machine will be zero in six
years. The effective income tax rate is 40%. (9.9)
a. Determine the prospective after-tax incremental cash
ﬂow associated with the new equipment if it is
believed that the existing machine could perform
satisfactorily for six more years.
b. Assume that the after-tax MARR is 12% per year.
Based on the ERR method, should you replace the
defender with the challenger? Assume ∈= MARR.
9-21. Five years ago a chemical plant invested $90,000
in a pumping station on a nearby river to provide the
water required for their production process. Straight-
line depreciation is employed for tax purposes, using a
30-year life and zero salvage value. During the past ﬁve
years, operating costs have been as follows:

CHAPTER 9 / REPLACEMENT ANALYSIS

A nearby city has offered to purchase the pumping
station for $75,000 as it is in the process of developing
a city water distribution system. The city is willing to
sign a 10-year contract with the plant to provide the
plant with its required volume of water for a price of
$10,000 per year. Plant ofﬁcials estimate that the salvage
value of the pumping station 10 years hence will be
about $30,000. The before-tax MARR is 10% per year.
An effective income tax rate of 50% is to be assumed.
Compare the annual cost (after taxes) of the defender
(keep the pumping station) to the challenger (sell station
to the city) and help plant management determine the
more economical course of action. (9.9)
9-22. A hydraulic press was installed 10 years ago at a
capital investment cost of $70,000. This press presently
has a market value of $14,000. If kept, the press has
an economic life of three years, operating expenses of
$14,000 per year, and a market value of $10,000 at the
end of year (EOY) three. The existing press is being
depreciated by the straight line method using a 15-year
write-off period with an estimated salvage value for
depreciation purposes of $10,000.
As an alternative, the currently owned press can
be replaced with an improved challenger press which
will cost $65,000 to install, have operating expenses
of $9,000 per year, and have a ﬁnal market value
of $10,000 at the end of its 20-year economic life. If
the replacement is made, the challenger press will be
depreciated with the straight line method over a 20-year
life with an estimated salvage value of $10,000 at EOY
20. It is thought that a hydraulic press will be needed
indeﬁnitely.
If the after-tax MARR is 10% per year and the
effective income tax rate is 40%, should the defender
or the challenger be recommended? (9.9)
9-23. A manufacturing company has some existing
semiautomatic production equipment that it is consi-
dering replacing. This equipment has a present MV of
$57,000 and a BV of $27,000. It has ﬁve more years of
depreciation available under MACRS (ADS) of $6,000
per year for four years and $3,000 in year ﬁve. (The
original recovery period was nine years.) The estimated
MV of the equipment ﬁve years from now is $18,500.
The total annual operating and maintenance expenses
are averaging $27,000 per year.
New automated replacement equipment would
then be leased. Estimated annual operating expenses
for the new equipment are $12,200 per year. The annual
leasing costs would be $24,300. The MARR (after taxes)
is 9% per year, t = 40%, and the analysis period is ﬁve
years. (Remember: The owner claims depreciation, and
the leasing cost is an operating expense.)
Based on an after-tax analysis, should the new
equipment be leased? Base your answer on the IRR of
the incremental cash ﬂow. (9.9, 9.10)
9-24. Five years ago, a company in New Jersey installed
a diesel-electric unit costing $50,000 at a remote site
because no dependable electric power was available
from a public utility. The company has computed dep-
reciation by the straight-line method with a useful life of
10 years and a zero salvage value. Annual operation and
maintenance expenses are $16,000, and property taxes
and insurance cost another $3,000 per year.
Dependable electric service is now available at an
estimated annual cost of $30,000. The company in
New Jersey wishes to know whether it would be more
economical to dispose of the diesel-electric unit now,
when it can be sold for $35,000, or to wait ﬁve years
when the unit would have to be replaced anyway (with
no MV). The company has an effective income tax rate
of 50% and tries to limit its capital expenditures to
opportunities that will earn at least 15% per year after
income taxes. What would you recommend? (9.9)
9-25. Extended Learning Exercise There are two
customers requiring three-phase electrical ser-
vice, one existing at location A and a new customer
at location B. The load at location A is known to be
110 kVA, and at location B it is contracted to be 280 kVA.
Both loads are expected to remain constant indefi-
nitely into the future. Already in service at A are three
100-kVA transformers that were installed some years
ago when the load was much greater.
Thus,
the
alternatives are as follows:
Alternative A: Install three 100-kVA transformers
(new) B now and replace those at A with three
37.5-kVA transformers only when the existing
ones must be retired.
Alternative B: Remove the three 100-kVA trans-
formers now at A and relocate them to B. Then
install three 37.5-kVA transformers (new) at A.

b. Suppose that the defender was set up on a
depreciation schedule with a ﬁve-year MACRS class
life at the time of its purchase (four years ago). The
defender can be sold now for $40,000, or a rebuilt
engine and transmission can be purchased and
installed at a cost of $12,000 (capital investment with
three-year depreciable life, straight line, salvage
value = 0). If the defender is kept in service, assume
that it will have operating and maintenance costs
as shown in Part (a) and a MV of $0 at the end of
four years. Determine the ATCFs for the defender.

three 40-kW units). The company selling the 40-kW
units will reduce the purchase price to $120,000 per
generator if three generators are bought. How does this
new challenger compare to the augmented defender
and the original challenger? (9.10)

CHAPTER 10
Evaluating Projects with the
Beneﬁt−Cost Ratio Method
The objective of Chapter 10 is to demonstrate the use of the beneﬁt–cost
(B–C) ratio for the evaluation of public projects.
Constructing a Bypass to Relieve
Trafﬁc Congestion
T
wo heavily traveled interstate highways currently intersect in the middle of
a major metropolitan area. A 25-mile, four-lane bypass is being considered to
connect the busy interstate highways at a point outside of the metropolitan
area. The projected construction cost of the bypass is $20 million. Annual main-
tenance of the roadway is expected to be $500,000. Major monetary beneﬁts of
reduced time delays due to trafﬁc congestion, improved traveler safety (fewer
trafﬁc accidents), and expanded opportunities for commercial businesses are
anticipated to be around $2 million per year.
This bypass would be state owned and maintained and is therefore considered
a public project. In this chapter, you will learn how public projects such as this are
evaluated using a beneﬁt–cost ratio.

10.1 Introduction
Public projects are those authorized, ﬁnanced, and operated by federal, state, or
local governmental agencies. Such public works are numerous, and although they
may be of any size, they are frequently much larger than private ventures. Since
they require the expenditure of capital, such projects are subject to the principles
of engineering economy with respect to their design, acquisition, and operation.
Because they are public projects, however, a number of important special factors
exist that are not ordinarily found in privately ﬁnanced and operated businesses.
The differences between public and private projects are listed in Table 10-1.

SECTION 10.2 / PERSPECTIVE AND TERMINOLOGY FOR ANALYZING PUBLIC PROJECTS 445
As a consequence of these differences, it is often difﬁcult to make engineering
economy studies and investment decisions for public-works projects in exactly the
same manner as for privately owned projects. Different decision criteria are often
used, which creates problems for the public (who pays the bill), for those who must
make the decisions, and for those who must manage public-works projects.
The beneﬁt–cost ratio method, which is normally used for the evaluation of
public projects, has its roots in federal legislation. Speciﬁcally, the Flood Control
Act of 1936 requires that, for a federally ﬁnanced project to be justiﬁed, its beneﬁts
must be in excess of its costs. In general terms, B–C analysis is a systematic
method of assessing the desirability of government projects or policies when it
is important to take a long-term view of future effects and a broad view of possible
side effects. In meeting the requirements of this mandate, the B–C ratio method
evolved into the calculation of a ratio of project beneﬁts to project costs. Rather
than allowing the analyst to apply criteria more commonly used for evaluating
private projects (IRR, PW, and so on), most governmental agencies require the use
of the B–C method.
10.2 Perspective and Terminology for Analyzing
Public Projects
Before applying the B–C ratio method to evaluate a public project, the appropriate
perspective (Chapter 1, Principle 3) must be established. In conducting an
engineering economic analysis of any project, whether it is a public or a private
undertaking, the proper perspective is to consider the net beneﬁts to the owners of
the enterprise considering the project. This process requires that the question of
who owns the project be addressed. Consider, for example, a project involving the
expansion of a section of I-80 from four to six lanes. Because the project is paid for
primarily with federal funds channeled through the Department of Transportation,
we might be inclined to say that the federal government is the owner. These funds,
however, originated from tax dollars—thus, the true owners of the project are
the taxpayers.
As mentioned previously, the B–C method requires that a ratio of beneﬁts to
costs be calculated. Project beneﬁts are deﬁned as the favorable consequences of
the project to the public, but project costs represent the monetary disbursement(s)
required of the government. It is entirely possible, however, for a project to
have unfavorable consequences to the public. Considering again the widening of
I-80, some of the owners of the project—farmers along the interstate—would lose a
portion of their arable land, along with a portion of their annual revenues. Because
this negative ﬁnancial consequence is borne by (a segment of) the public, it cannot
be classiﬁed as either a beneﬁt or a cost. The term disbeneﬁts is generally used to
represent the negative consequences of a project to the public.
EXAMPLE 10-1
Beneﬁts and Costs of a Convention Center and Sports Complex
A new convention center and sports complex has been proposed to the Gotham
City Council. This public-sector project, if approved, will be ﬁnanced through
the issue of municipal bonds. The facility will be located in the City Park near

trail, and a pond. Because the city already owns the park, no purchase of land
is necessary. List separately the project’s beneﬁts, costs, and any disbeneﬁts.

Operating and maintenance costs of the facility
Insurance costs of the facility
DISBENEFITS

Loss of wildlife habitat in urban area
10.3 Self-Liquidating Projects
The term self-liquidating project is applied to a governmental project that is expected
to earn direct revenue sufﬁcient to repay its cost in a speciﬁed period of time. Most
of these projects provide utility services—for example, the fresh water, electric
power, irrigation water, and sewage disposal provided by a hydroelectric dam.
Other examples of self-liquidating projects include toll bridges and highways.
As a rule, self-liquidating projects are expected to earn direct revenues that
offset their costs, but they are not expected to earn proﬁts or pay income taxes.
Although they also do not pay property taxes, in some cases in-lieu payments
are made to state, county, or municipal governments in place of the property or
franchise taxes that would have been paid had the project been under private
ownership. For example, the U.S. government agreed to pay the states of Arizona
and Nevada $300,000 each annually for 50 years in lieu of taxes that would have
accrued if Hoover Dam had been privately constructed and operated.
10.4 Multiple-Purpose Projects
An important characteristic of public-sector projects is that many such projects have
multiple purposes or objectives. One example of this would be the construction
of a dam to create a reservoir on a river. (See Figure 10-1.) This project would
have multiple purposes: (1) assist in ﬂood control, (2) provide water for irrigation,

SECTION 10.4 / MULTIPLE-PURPOSE PROJECTS 447
Irrigation
Power
Flood Control
Figure 10-1
Schematic Representation of a Multiple-Purpose Project Involving Flood
Control, Irrigation, and Power
(3) generate electric power, (4) provide recreational facilities, and (5) provide
drinking water. Developing such a project to meet more than one objective ensures
that greater overall economy can be achieved. Because the construction of a dam
involves very large sums of capital and the use of a valuable natural resource—a
river—it is likely that the project could not be justiﬁed unless it served multiple
purposes. This type of situation is generally desirable, but, at the same time, it
creates economic and managerial problems due to the overlapping utilization of
facilities and the possibility of a conﬂict of interest between the several purposes
and the agencies involved.
The basic problems that often arise in evaluating public projects can be
illustrated by returning to the dam shown in Figure 10-1. The project under
consideration is to be built in the semiarid central portion of California, primarily
to provide control against spring ﬂooding resulting from the melting snow in the
Sierra Nevadas. If a portion of the water impounded behind the dam could be
diverted onto the adjoining land below the dam, the irrigation water would greatly
increase the productivity, and thus the value, of that land, which would result in
an increase in the nation’s resources. So the objectives of the project should be
expanded to include both ﬂood control and irrigation.
The existence of a dam with a high water level on one side and a much lower
level on the other side also suggests that some of the nation’s resources will be
wasted unless a portion of the water is diverted to run through turbines, generating
electric power. This electricity can be sold to customers in the areas surrounding
the reservoir, giving the project the third purpose of generating electric power.
In this semiarid region, the creation of a large reservoir behind the dam would
provide valuable facilities for hunting, ﬁshing, boating, swimming, and camping.
Thus, the project has the fourth purpose of providing recreation facilities. A ﬁfth
purpose would be the provision of a steady, reliable supply of drinking water.
Each of the above-mentioned objectives of the project has desirable economic
and social value, so what started out as a single-purpose project now has ﬁve
purposes. The failure to meet all ﬁve objectives would mean that valuable national
resources are being wasted. On the other hand, there are certain disbeneﬁts to the
public that must also be considered. Most apparent of these is the loss of farm land

448
CHAPTER 10 / EVALUATING PROJECTS WITH THE BENEFIT–COST RATIO METHOD
above the dam in the area covered by the reservoir. Other disbeneﬁts might include
(1) the loss of a white-water recreational area enjoyed by canoeing, kayaking, and
rafting enthusiasts, (2) the loss of annual deposits of fertile soil in the river basin
below the dam due to spring ﬂooding, and (3) the negative ecological impact of
obstructing the ﬂow of the river.
If the project is built to serve ﬁve purposes, the fact that one dam will serve all
of them leads to at least three basic problems. The ﬁrst of these is the allocation of
the cost of the dam to each of its intended purposes. Suppose, for example, that the
estimated costs of the project are $35,000,000. This ﬁgure includes costs incurred
for the purchase and preparation of land to be covered by water above the dam
site; the actual construction of the dam, the irrigation system, the power generation
plant, and the puriﬁcation and pumping stations for drinking water; and the design
and development of recreational facilities. The allocation of some of these costs to
speciﬁc purposes is obvious (e.g., the cost of constructing the irrigation system), but
what portion of the cost of purchasing and preparing the land should be assigned to
ﬂood control? What amounts should be assigned to irrigation, power generation,
drinking water, and recreation?
The second basic problem is the conﬂict of interest among the several purposes
of the project. Consider the decision as to the water level to be maintained behind
the dam. In meeting the ﬁrst purpose—ﬂood control—the reservoir should be
maintained at a near-empty level to provide the greatest storage capacity during
the months of the spring thaw. This lower level would be in direct conﬂict with
the purpose of power generation, which could be maximized by maintaining as
high a level as possible behind the dam at all times. Further, maximizing the
recreational beneﬁts would suggest that a constant water level be maintained
throughout the year. Thus, conﬂicts of interest arise among the multiple purposes,
and compromising decisions must be made. These decisions ultimately affect the
magnitude of beneﬁts resulting from the project.
A third problem with multiple-purpose public projects is political sensitivity.
Because each of the various purposes, or even the project itself, is likely to be
desired or opposed by some segment of the public and by various interest groups
that may be affected, inevitably such projects frequently become political issues.∗
This conﬂict often has an effect on cost allocations and thus on the overall economy
of these projects.
The net result of these three factors is that the cost allocations made in multiple-purpose
public-sector projects tend to be arbitrary. As a consequence, production and selling
costs of the services provided also are arbitrary. Because of this, these costs
cannot be used as valid yardsticks with which similar private-sector projects
can be compared to determine the relative efﬁciencies of public and private
ownership.
∗The construction of the Tellico Dam on the Little Tennessee River was considerably delayed due to two important
disbeneﬁts: (1) concerns over the impact of the project on the environment of a small ﬁsh, the snail darter, and (2) the
ﬂooding of burial grounds considered sacred by the Cherokee Nation.

SECTION 10.5 / DIFFICULTIES IN EVALUATING PUBLIC-SECTOR PROJECTS 449
10.5 Difﬁculties in Evaluating Public-Sector Projects
With all of the difﬁculties that have been cited in evaluating public-sector projects,
we may wonder whether engineering economy studies of such projects should
be attempted. In most cases, economy studies cannot be made in as complete,
comprehensive, and satisfactory a manner as in the case of studies of privately
ﬁnanced projects. In the private sector, the costs are borne by the ﬁrm undertaking
the project, and the beneﬁts are the favorable outcomes of the project accrued by the
ﬁrm. Any costs and beneﬁts that occur outside of the ﬁrm are generally ignored
in evaluations unless it is anticipated that those external factors will indirectly
impact the ﬁrm. But the opposite is true in the case of public-sector projects. In
the wording of the Flood Control Act of 1936, “if the beneﬁts to whomsoever they
may accrue are in excess of the estimated costs,” all of the potential beneﬁts of
a public project are relevant and should be considered. Simply enumerating all
of the beneﬁts for a large-scale public project is a formidable task! Further, the
monetary value of these beneﬁts to all of the affected segments of the public must
somehow be estimated. Regardless, decisions about the investment of capital in
public projects must be made by elected or appointed ofﬁcials, by managers, or by
the general public in the form of referendums. Because of the magnitude of capital
and the long-term consequences associated with many of these projects, following
a systematic approach for evaluating their worthiness is vital.
There are a number of difﬁculties inherent in public projects that must be
considered in conducting engineering economy studies and making economic
decisions regarding those projects. Some of these are as follows:
1. There is no proﬁt standard to be used as a measure of ﬁnancial effectiveness.
Most public projects are intended to be nonproﬁt.
2. The monetary impact of many of the beneﬁts of public projects is difﬁcult
to quantify.
3. There may be little or no connection between the project and the public, which
is the owner of the project.
4. There is often strong political inﬂuence whenever public funds are used. When
decisions regarding public projects are made by elected ofﬁcials who will soon
be seeking reelection, the immediate beneﬁts and costs are stressed, often with little
or no consideration for the more important long-term consequences.
5. Public projects are usually much more subject to legal restrictions than are
private projects. For example, the area of operations for a municipally owned
power company may be restricted such that power can be sold only within the
city limits, regardless of whether a market for any excess capacity exists outside
the city.
6. The ability of governmental bodies to obtain capital is much more restricted
than that of private enterprises.
7. The appropriate interest rate for discounting the beneﬁts and costs of public
projects is often controversially and politically sensitive. Clearly, lower interest
rates favor long-term projects having major social or monetary beneﬁts in the
future. Higher interest rates promote a short-term outlook whereby decisions
are based mostly on initial investments and immediate beneﬁts.

450
CHAPTER 10 / EVALUATING PROJECTS WITH THE BENEFIT–COST RATIO METHOD
A discussion of several viewpoints and considerations that are often used to
establish an appropriate interest rate for public projects is included in the next
section.
10.6 What Interest Rate Should Be Used
for Public Projects?
When public-sector projects are evaluated, interest rates∗play the same role of
accounting for the time value of money as in the evaluation of projects in the private
sector. The rationale for the use of interest rates, however, is somewhat different.
The choice of an interest rate in the private sector is intended to lead directly to
a selection of projects to maximize proﬁt or minimize cost. In the public sector,
on the other hand, projects are not usually intended as proﬁt-making ventures.
Instead, the goal is the maximization of social beneﬁts, assuming that these have
been appropriately measured. The choice of an interest rate in the public sector
is intended to determine how available funds should best be allocated among
competing projects to achieve social goals. The relative differences in magnitude of
interest rates between governmental agencies, regulated monopolies, and private
enterprises are illustrated in Figure 10-2.
Three main considerations bear on what interest rate to use in engineering
economy studies of public-sector projects:
1. The interest rate on borrowed capital
2. The opportunity cost of capital to the governmental agency
3. The opportunity cost of capital to the taxpayers
As a general rule, it is appropriate to use the interest rate on borrowed capital as
the interest rate for cases in which money is borrowed speciﬁcally for the project(s)
under consideration. For example, if municipal bonds are issued speciﬁcally for

SECTION 10.6 / WHAT INTEREST RATE SHOULD BE USED FOR PUBLIC PROJECTS? 451
the ﬁnancing of a new school, the effective interest rate on those bonds should be
the interest rate.
For public-sector projects, the opportunity cost of capital to a governmental
agency encompasses the annual rate of beneﬁt to either the constituency served by
that agency or the composite of taxpayers who will eventually pay for the project.
If projects are selected such that the estimated return (in terms of beneﬁts) on all
accepted projects is higher than that on any of the rejected projects, then the interest
rate used in economic analyses is that associated with the best opportunity forgone.
If this process is done for all projects and investment capital available within a
governmental agency, the result is an opportunity cost of capital for that governmental
agency. A strong argument against this philosophy, however, is that the different
funding levels of the various agencies and the different nature of projects under
the direction of each agency would result in different interest rates for each of the
agencies, even though they all share a common primary source of funds—taxation
of the public.
The third consideration—the opportunity cost of capital to the taxpayers—is
based on the philosophy that all government spending takes potential investment
capital away from the taxpayers. The taxpayers’ opportunity cost is generally
greater than either the cost of borrowed capital or the opportunity cost to
governmental agencies, and there is a compelling argument for applying the
largest of these three rates as the interest rate for evaluating public projects; it
is not economically sound to take money away from a taxpayer to invest in a
government project yielding beneﬁts at a rate less than what could have been
earned by that taxpayer.
This argument was supported by a federal government directive issued in
1997—and still in force—by the Ofﬁce of Management and Budget (OMB).∗
According to this directive, a 7% interest rate should be used in economic
evaluations for a wide range of federal projects, with certain exceptions (e.g., a
lower rate can be applied in evaluating water resource projects). This 7%, it can be
argued, is at least a rough approximation of the real-dollar return that taxpayers
could earn from the use of that money for private investment. This corresponds to
an approximate nominal interest rate of 10% per year.
One additional theory on establishing interest rates for federal projects advo-
cates that the social discount rate used in such analyses should be the market-
determined risk-free rate for private investments.† According to this theory, a
nominal interest rate in the order of 3–4% per year should be used.
The preceding discussion focuses on the considerations that should play a role in
establishing an interest rate for public projects. As in the case of the private sector,
there is no simple formula for determining the appropriate interest rate for public
projects. With the exception of projects falling under the 1997 OMB directive, setting
the interest rate is ultimately a policy decision at the discretion of the governmental
agency conducting the analysis.

CHAPTER 10 / EVALUATING PROJECTS WITH THE BENEFIT–COST RATIO METHOD
10.7 The Beneﬁt−Cost Ratio Method
As the name implies, the B–C ratio method involves the calculation of a ratio of
beneﬁts to costs. Whether evaluating a project in the private sector or in the public
sector, the time value of money must be considered to account for the timing of cash
ﬂows (or beneﬁts) occurring after the inception of the project. Thus, the B–C ratio
is actually a ratio of discounted beneﬁts to discounted costs.
Any method for formally evaluating projects in the public sector must consider
the worthiness of allocating resources to achieve social goals. For over 70 years, the
B–C ratio method has been the accepted procedure for making go/no-go decisions
on independent projects and for comparing mutually exclusive projects in the
public sector, even though the other methods discussed in Chapter 5 (PW, AW,
IRR, etc.) will lead to identical recommendations, assuming all these procedures are
properly applied.
Accordingly, the purpose of this section is to describe and illustrate the
mechanics of the B–C ratio method for evaluating projects. Two different B–C ratios
will be presented because they are used in practice by various government agencies
and municipalities. Both ratios lead to the identical choice of which project is best
when comparing mutually exclusive alternatives.
The B–C ratio is deﬁned as the ratio of the equivalent worth of beneﬁts to the
equivalent worth of costs. The equivalent-worth measure applied can be present
worth, annual worth, or future worth, but customarily, either PW orAW is used. An
interest rate for public projects, as discussed in the previous section, is used in the
equivalent-worthcalculations. TheB–Cratioisalsoknownasthesavings-investment
ratio (SIR) by some governmental agencies.
Several different formulations of the B–C ratio have been developed. Two of
the more commonly used formulations are presented in this section, illustrating
the use of both present worth and annual worth.
Conventional B–C ratio with PW:
B–C =
PW(beneﬁts of the proposed project)
PW(total costs of the proposed project)
=
PW(B)
I −PW(MV) + PW(O&M)
(10-1)
where
PW(·) = present worth of (·);
B = beneﬁts of the proposed project;
I = initial investment in the proposed project;
MV = market value at the end of useful life;
O&M = operating and maintenance costs of the proposed project.
Modiﬁed B–C ratio with PW:
B–C = PW(B) −PW(O&M)
I −PW(MV)
.
(10-2)

SECTION 10.7 / THE BENEFIT–COST RATIO METHOD
453
The numerator of the modiﬁed B–C ratio expresses the equivalent worth of the
beneﬁts minus the equivalent worth of the operating and maintenance costs, and
the denominator includes only the initial investment costs (less any market value).
A project is acceptable when the B–C ratio, as deﬁned in either Equation (10-1) or
(10-2), is greater than or equal to 1.0.
Equations (10-1) and (10-2) can be rewritten in terms of equivalent annual
worth, as follows:
Conventional B–C ratio with AW:
B–C =
AW(beneﬁts of the proposed project)
AW(total costs of the proposed project)
=
AW(B)
CR + AW(O&M),
(10-3)
where
AW(·) = annual worth of (·);
B = beneﬁts of the proposed project;
CR = capital-recovery amount (i.e., the equivalent annual
cost of the initial investment, I, including an allowance
for market, or salvage value, if any);
O&M = operating and maintenance costs of the proposed project.
Modiﬁed B–C ratio with AW:
B–C = AW(B) −AW(O&M)
CR
.
(10-4)
The resulting B–C ratios for all the previous formulations will give identical
results in determining the acceptability of a project (i.e., either B–C ≥1.0 or
B–C < 1.0). The conventional B–C ratio will give identical numerical results for
both PW and AW formulations; similarly, the modiﬁed B–C ratio gives identical
numerical results whether PW or AW is used. Although the magnitude of the B–C
ratio will differ between conventional and modiﬁed B–C ratios, go/no-go decisions
are not affected by the choice of approach, as shown in Example 10-2.
EXAMPLE 10-2
Equivalence of the B−C Ratio Formulations
The city of Columbia is considering extending the runways of its municipal
airport so that commercial jets can use the facility. The land necessary for the
runway extension is currently a farmland that can be purchased for $350,000.
Construction costs for the runway extension are projected to be $600,000, and
the additional annual maintenance costs for the extension are estimated to be
$22,500. If the runways are extended, a small terminal will be constructed
at a cost of $250,000. The annual operating and maintenance costs for the
terminal are estimated at $75,000. Finally, the projected increase in ﬂights

454
CHAPTER 10 / EVALUATING PROJECTS WITH THE BENEFIT–COST RATIO METHOD
will require the addition of two air trafﬁc controllers at an annual cost of
$100,000. Annual beneﬁts of the runway extension have been estimated as
follows:
$325,000
Rental receipts from airlines leasing space at the facility
$65,000
Airport tax charged to passengers
$50,000
Convenience beneﬁt for residents of Columbia
$50,000
Additional tourism dollars for Columbia
Apply the B–C ratio method with a study period of 20 years and a MARR of
10% per year to determine whether the runways at Columbia Municipal Airport
should be extended.
Solution
Conventional B–C:
B–C = PW(B)/[I −PW(MV) + PW(O&M)]
Equation (10-1)
B–C = $490,000 (P/A, 10%, 20)/[$1,200,000 + $197,500 (P/A, 10%, 20)]
B–C = 1.448 > 1; extend runways.
Modiﬁed B–C:
B–C = [PW(B) −PW(O&M)]/[I −PW(MV)]
Equation (10-2)
B–C = [$490,000 (P/A, 10%, 20) −$197,500 (P/A, 10%, 20)]/$1,200,000
B–C = 2.075 > 1; extend runways.
Conventional B–C:
B–C = AW(B)/[CR + AW(O&M)]
Equation (10-3)
B–C = $490,000/[$1,200,000 (A/P, 10%, 20) + $197,500]
B–C = 1.448 > 1; extend runways.
Modiﬁed B–C:
B–C = [AW(B) −AW(O&M)]/CR
Equation (10-4)
B–C = [$490,000 −$197,500]/[$1,200,000 (A/P, 10%, 20)]
B–C = 2.075 > 1; extend runways.
As can be seen in the preceding example, the difference between conventional
and modiﬁed B–C ratios is essentially due to subtracting the equivalent-worth
measure of operating and maintenance costs from both the numerator and the
denominator of the B–C ratio. In order for the B–C ratio to be greater than 1.0,
the numerator must be greater than the denominator. Similarly, the numerator
must be less than the denominator for the B–C ratio to be less than 1.0. Subtracting
a constant (the equivalent worth of operating and maintenance costs) from both
numerator and denominator does not alter the relative magnitudes of the numerator
and denominator. Thus, project acceptability is not affected by the choice of
conventional versus modiﬁed B–C ratio. This information is stated mathematically
as follows for the case of B–C > 1.0:

SECTION 10.7 / THE BENEFIT–COST RATIO METHOD
455
Let
N = the numerator of the conventional B–C ratio,
D = the denominator of the conventional B–C ratio,
O&M = the equivalent worth of operating and maintenance costs.
If B–C = N
D > 1.0, then N > D.
If N > D, and [N −O&M] > [D −O&M], then N −O&M
D −O&M > 1.0.
Note that N −O&M
D −O&M is the modiﬁed B–C ratio; thus, if conventional B–C > 1.0,
then modiﬁed B–C > 1.0
EXAMPLE 10-3
B−C Ratio of the Proposed Bypass
In this example, we will evaluate the bypass described in the beginning of the
chapter. The construction cost of the bypass is $20 million, and $500,000 would
be required each year for annual maintenance. The annual beneﬁts to the public
have been estimated to be $2 million. If the study period is 50 years and the
state’s interest rate is 8% per year, should the bypass be constructed? What
impact does a social interest rate of 4% per year have on the B–C ratio of the
project?
Solution
At an interest rate of 8% per year, the conventional B–C ratio of the proposed
bypass is
B–C =
$2,000,000
$20,000,000 (A/P, 8%, 50) + $500,000 = 0.94.
Because this ratio is less than one, the bypass is not economically acceptable at
8% interest.
If a social interest rate of 4% per year was used, the B–C ratio would be 1.40
and the bypass would be acceptable.
Two additional issues of concern are the treatment of disbeneﬁts in B–C analyses
and the decision as to whether certain cash ﬂow items should be treated as additional
beneﬁts or as reduced costs. The ﬁrst concern arises whenever disbeneﬁts are formally
deﬁned in a B–C evaluation of a public-sector project. An example of the second
concern would be a public-sector project proposing to replace an existing asset
having high annual operating and maintenance costs with a new asset having
lower operating and manual costs. As will be seen in Sections 10.7.1 and 10.7.2,
the ﬁnal recommendation on a project is not altered by either the approach to
incorporating disbeneﬁts or the classiﬁcation of an item as a reduced cost or an
additional beneﬁt.

456
CHAPTER 10 / EVALUATING PROJECTS WITH THE BENEFIT–COST RATIO METHOD
10.7.1
Disbeneﬁts in the B−C Ratio
In a previous section, disbeneﬁts were deﬁned as negative consequences to the
public resulting from the implementation of a public-sector project. The traditional
approach for incorporating disbeneﬁts into a B–C analysis is to reduce beneﬁts by
the amount of disbeneﬁts (i.e., to subtract disbeneﬁts from beneﬁts in the numerator
of the B–C ratio). Alternatively, the disbeneﬁts could be treated as costs (i.e., add
disbeneﬁts to costs in the denominator). Equations (10-5) and (10-6) illustrate the
two approaches for incorporating disbeneﬁts in the conventional B–C ratio, with
beneﬁts, costs, and disbeneﬁts in terms of equivalent AW. (Similar equations could
also be developed for the modiﬁed B–C ratio or for PW as the measure of equivalent
worth.) Again, the magnitude of the B–C ratio will be different depending upon
which approach is used to incorporate disbeneﬁts, but project acceptability—that
is, whether the B–C ratio is >, <, or = 1.0—will not be affected, as shown in
Example 10-4.
Conventional B–C ratio with AW, beneﬁts reduced by amount of disbeneﬁts:
B–C = AW(beneﬁts) −AW(disbeneﬁts)
AW(costs)
= AW(B) −AW(D)
CR + AW(O&M).
(10-5)
Here,
AW(·) = annual worth of (·);
B = beneﬁts of the proposed project;
D = disbeneﬁts of the proposed project;
CR = capital recovery amount (i.e., the equivalent annual cost of
the initial investment, I, including an allowance for market
value, if any);
O&M = operating and maintenance costs of the proposed project.
Conventional B–C ratio with AW, costs increased by amount of disbeneﬁts:
B–C =
AW(beneﬁts)
AW(costs)+AW(disbeneﬁts) =
AW(B)
CR+AW(O&M)+AW(D).
(10-6)
EXAMPLE 10-4
Including Disbeneﬁts in a B−C Analysis
Refer back to Example 10-2. In addition to the beneﬁts and costs, suppose that
there are disbeneﬁts associated with the runway extension project. Speciﬁcally,
the increased noise level from commercial jet trafﬁc will be a serious nuisance
to homeowners living along the approach path to the Columbia Municipal
Airport. The annual disbeneﬁt to citizens of Columbia caused by this noise
pollution is estimated to be $100,000. Given this additional information, reapply
the conventional B–C ratio, with equivalent annual worth, to determine
whether this disbeneﬁt affects your recommendation on the desirability of
this project.

SECTION 10.7 / THE BENEFIT–COST RATIO METHOD
457
Solution
Disbeneﬁts reduce
B–C = [AW(B) −AW(D)]/[CR + AW(O&M)]
beneﬁts, Equation (10-5)
B–C = [$490,000 −$100,000]/[$1,200,000 (A/P, 10%, 20) + $197,500]
B–C = 1.152 > 1; extend runways.
Disbeneﬁts treated as additional
B–C = AW(B)/[CR + AW(O&M) + AW(D)]
costs, Equation (10-6)
B–C = $490,000/[$1,200,000 (A/P, 10%, 20) + $197,500 + $100,000]
B–C = 1.118 > 1; extend runways.
As in the case of conventional and modiﬁed B–C ratios, the treatment of
disbeneﬁts may affect the magnitude of the B–C ratio, but it has no effect on project
desirability in go/no-go decisions. It is left to the reader to develop a mathematical
rationale for this, similar to that included in the discussion of conventional versus
modiﬁed B–C ratios.
10.7.2
Added Beneﬁts versus Reduced Costs in B−C Analyses
The analyst often needs to classify certain cash ﬂows as either added beneﬁts or
reduced costs in calculating a B–C ratio. The questions arise, How critical is the
proper assignment of a particular cash ﬂow as an added beneﬁt or a reduced cost?
Is the outcome of the analysis affected by classifying a reduced cost as a beneﬁt?
An arbitrary decision as to the classiﬁcation of a beneﬁt or a cost has no impact on project
acceptability. The mathematical rationale for this information is presented next and
in Example 10-5.
Let
B = the equivalent annual worth of project beneﬁts,
C = the equivalent annual worth of project costs,
X = the equivalent annual worth of a cash ﬂow (either an added
beneﬁt or a reduced cost) not included in either B or C.
If X is classiﬁed as an added beneﬁt, then B–C = B + X
C
. Alternatively,
if X is classiﬁed as a reduced cost, then B–C =
B
C −X .
Assuming that the project is acceptable, that is, B–C ≥1.0,
B + X
C
≥1.0, which indicates that B + X ≥C, and
B
C −X ≥1.0, which indicates that B ≥C −X,
which can be restated as B + X ≥C.

458
CHAPTER 10 / EVALUATING PROJECTS WITH THE BENEFIT–COST RATIO METHOD
EXAMPLE 10-5
Added Beneﬁt versus Reduced Cost in a Bridge Widening Project
A project is being considered by the Tennessee Department of Transportation to
replace an aging bridge across the Cumberland River on a state highway. The
existing two-lane bridge is expensive to maintain and creates a trafﬁc bottleneck
because the state highway is four lanes wide on either side of the bridge. The
new bridge can be constructed at a cost of $300,000, and estimated annual
maintenance costs are $10,000. The existing bridge has annual maintenance costs
of $18,500. The annual beneﬁt of the new four-lane bridge to motorists, due to
the removal of the trafﬁc bottleneck, has been estimated to be $25,000. Conduct a
B–C analysis, using a MARR of 8% and a study period of 25 years, to determine
whether the new bridge should be constructed.
Solution
Treating the reduction in annual maintenance costs as a reduced cost:
B–C = $25,000/[$300,000(A/P, 8%, 25) −($18,500 −$10,000)]
B–C = 1.275 > 1; construct new bridge.
Treating the reduction in annual maintenance costs as an increased beneﬁt:
B–C = [$25,000 + ($18,500 −$10,000)]/[$300,000(A/P, 8%, 25)]
B–C = 1.192 > 1; construct new bridge.
Therefore, the decision to classify a cash-ﬂow item as an additional beneﬁt
or as a reduced cost will affect the magnitude of the calculated B–C ratio, but it
will have no effect on project acceptability.
10.8
Evaluating Independent Projects by B−C Ratios
Independent projects are categorized as groupings of projects for which the choice
to select any particular project in the group is independent of choices regarding any
and all other projects within the group. Thus, it is permissible to select none of the
projects, any combination of projects, or all of the projects from an independent
group. (Note that this does not hold true under conditions of capital rationing.
Methods of evaluating otherwise independent projects under capital rationing are
discussed in Chapter 13.) Because any or all projects from an independent set can
be selected, formal comparisons of independent projects are unnecessary. The issue
of whether one project is better than another is unimportant if those projects are
independent; the only criterion for selecting each of those projects is whether their
respective B–C ratios are equal to or greater than 1.0.
Mutually exclusive alternatives can be formed from independent projects. For
instance, from three independent projects there are 23 = 8 mutually exclusive
combinations possible (including “do nothing”). See if you can list them all. For
ﬁve independent projects, there are 25 = 32 mutually exclusive alternatives.
A typical example of an economy study of a federal project—using the
conventional B–C-ratio method—is the study of a ﬂood control and power

project on the White River in Missouri and Arkansas. Considerable ﬂooding and
consequent damage had occurred along certain portions of this river, as shown in
Table 10-2. In addition, the uncontrolled water ﬂow increased ﬂood conditions
on the lower Mississippi River. In this case, there were independent options
of building a reservoir and/or a channel improvement to alleviate the problem.
The cost and beneﬁt summaries for the Table Rock reservoir and the Bull Shoals

channel improvement project has the higher B–C ratio is irrelevant; both options
are acceptable because their B–C ratios are greater than one.
Several interesting facts may be noted concerning this study. First, there was
no attempt to allocate the cost of the projects between ﬂood control and power
production. Second, very large portions of the ﬂood-control beneﬁts were shown to
be in connection with the Mississippi River and are not indicated in Table 10-2; these
were not detailed in the main body of the report but were shown in an appendix.
Only a moderate decrease in the value of these beneﬁts would have changed
the B–C ratio considerably. Third, without the combination of ﬂood-control and
power-generation objectives, neither project would have been economical for either
purpose. These facts point to the advantages of multiple purposes for making ﬂood-
control projects economically feasible and to the necessity for careful enumeration
and evaluation of the prospective beneﬁts of a public-sector project.
10.9
Comparison of Mutually Exclusive Projects
by B−C Ratios
Recall that a group of mutually exclusive projects was deﬁned as a group of projects
from which, at most, one project may be selected. When using an equivalent-worth
method to select from among a set of mutually exclusive alternatives (MEAs), the
best alternative can be selected by maximizing the PW (or AW, or FW). Because
the B–C method provides a ratio of beneﬁts to costs rather than a direct measure
of each project’s proﬁt potential, selecting the project that maximizes the B–C ratio
does not guarantee that the best project is selected. This phenomenon is illustrated
in Example 10-6. As with the rate-of-return procedures in Chapter 6, an evaluation
of mutually exclusive alternatives by the B–C ratio requires that an incremental B–C
analysis be conducted.

Solution
The B–C analysis has been conducted improperly. Although each of the
B–C ratios shown is numerically correct, a comparison of mutually exclusive
alternatives requires that an incremental analysis be conducted.
When comparing mutually exclusive alternatives with the B–C ratio method,
they are ﬁrst ranked in order of increasing total equivalent worth of costs. This rank-
ordering will be identical whether the ranking is based on PW, AW, or FW of
costs. The do-nothing alternative is selected as a baseline alternative. The B–C
ratio is then calculated for the alternative having the lowest equivalent cost. If the
B–C ratio for this alternative is equal to or greater than 1.0, then that alternative
becomes the new baseline; otherwise, do-nothing remains as the baseline.
The next least equivalent cost alternative is then selected, and the difference (!)
in the respective beneﬁts and costs of this alternative and the baseline is used to
calculate an incremental B–C ratio (!B/!C). If that ratio is equal to or greater
than 1.0, then the higher equivalent cost alternative becomes the new baseline;
otherwise, the last baseline alternative is maintained. Incremental B–C ratios are
determined for each successively higher equivalent cost alternative until the last
alternative has been compared. The ﬂowchart of this procedure is included as
Figure 10-3, and the procedure is illustrated in Example 10-7.

−$1,750,000(P/F, 10%, 50) = $17,173,333,

−$2,000,000(P/F, 10%, 50) = $18,923,333,
PW(Beneﬁt, A) = $2,150,000(P/A, 10%, 50) = $21,316,851,
PW(Beneﬁt, B) = $2,265,000(P/A, 10%, 50) = $22,457,055,
PW(Beneﬁt, C) = $2,500,000(P/A, 10%, 50) = $24,787,036.
B–C(A) = $21,316,851/$15,925,463
= 1.3385 > 1.0.
Therefore, Project A is acceptable.
!B/!C of (B −A) = ($22,457,055 −$21,316,851)/($17,173,333 −$15,925,463)
= 0.9137 < 1.0.
Therefore, increment required for Project B is not acceptable.
!B/!C of (C −A) = ($24,787,036 −$21,316,851)/($18,923,333 −$15,925,463)
= 1.1576 > 1.0.
Therefore, increment required for Project C is acceptable.
Decision: Recommend Project C.
Spreadsheet Solution
A spreadsheet analysis for this example is shown in Figure 10-4. For each
mutually exclusive project, the PW of total beneﬁts (cells B11:B13) and the PW
of total costs (cells C11:C13) are calculated. Note that annual operating and
maintenance costs are included in the total cost calculation in accordance with
the conventional B–C ratio formulation.
Since the projects are mutually exclusive, they must be ranked from smallest
to largest according to the equivalent worth of costs (do nothing →A →B →
C). The B–C ratio for Project A is calculated to be 1.34 (row 17), and Project A
replaces do-nothing as the baseline alternative.
Project B is now compared with Project A (row 18). The ratio of incremental
beneﬁts to incremental costs is less than 1.0, so Project A remains the baseline
alternative. Finally, in row 19, the incremental beneﬁts and incremental costs

associated with selecting Project C instead of Project A are used to calculate an
incremental B–C ratio of 1.16. Since this ratio is greater than one, the increment
required for Project C is acceptable, and thus Project C becomes the recom-
mended project.
It is not uncommon for some of the projects in a set of mutually exclusive
public-works projects to have different lives. Recall from Chapter 6 that the AW
criterion can be used to select from among alternatives with different lives as long
as the assumption of repeatability is valid. Similarly, if a mutually exclusive set of
public-works projects includes projects with varying useful lives, it may be possible
to conduct an incremental B–C analysis by using the AW of beneﬁts and costs of
the various projects. This analysis is illustrated in Example 10-8.

B–C(II) = $230,000/$173,629 = 1.3247 > 1.0.
Therefore, Project II is acceptable.
!B/!C of (I–II) = ($245,000 −$230,000)/($190,977 −$173,629)

Therefore, increment required for Project I is not acceptable.
Decision: Project II should be selected.
10.10
CASE STUDY−−Improving a Railroad Crossing
Trafﬁc congestion and vehicle safety are signiﬁcant concerns in most major cities in
the Northeast United States. Amajor metropolitan city in New Jersey is considering
the elimination of a railroad grade crossing by building an overpass. Trafﬁc
engineers estimated that approximately 2,000 vehicles per day are delayed at an
average of 2 minutes each due to trains at the grade crossing. Trucks comprise 40%
of the vehicles, and the opportunity cost of their delay is assumed to average $20
per truck-hour. The other vehicles are cars having an assumed average opportunity
cost of $4 per car-hour. It is also estimated that the new overpass will save the city
approximately $4,000 per year in expenses directly due to accidents.
The trafﬁc engineers determined that the overpass would cost $1,000,000
and is estimated to have a useful life of 40 years and a $100,000 salvage value.
Annual maintenance costs of the overpass would cost the city $5,000 more than the
maintenance costs of the existing grade crossing. The installation of the overpass
will save the railroad an annual expense of $30,000 for lawsuits and maintenance
of crossing guards.
Since this is a public project, there are special considerations and a complete and
comprehensive engineering economy study is more challenging than in the case of

466
CHAPTER 10 / EVALUATING PROJECTS WITH THE BENEFIT–COST RATIO METHOD
privately ﬁnanced projects. For example, in the private sector, costs are accrued by
the ﬁrm undertaking the project, and beneﬁts are the favorable outcomes achieved
by the ﬁrm. Typically, any costs and beneﬁts that are external to the ﬁrm are ignored
in economic evaluations unless those external costs and beneﬁts indirectly affect
the ﬁrm. With economic evaluations of public projects, however, the opposite is
true. As in the case of improving the railroad crossing, there are multiple purposes
or objectives to consider. The true owners of the project are the taxpayers! The
monetary impacts of the diverse beneﬁts are oftentimes hard to quantify, and there
may be special political or legal issues to consider.
In this case study, the city council is now in the process of considering the merits
of the engineering proposal to improve the railroad crossing. The city council is
considering the following questions in its deliberations:
• Should the overpass be built by the city if it is to be the owner and the opportunity
cost of the city’s capital is 8% per year?
• How much should the railroad reasonably be asked to contribute toward
construction of the bridge if its opportunity cost of capital is assumed to be
15% per year?
Solution
The city uses the conventional B–C ratio with AW for its analyses of public projects.
The annual beneﬁts of the overpass are comprised of the time savings for vehicles
(whose drivers are “members” of the city) and the reduction in accident expenses.
The city’s cost engineer makes the following estimates.
Annual Beneﬁts:
Cars =
!2,000×0.6 vehicles

"!365 days

"!

= $194,667
Annual savings = $4,000
Total annual beneﬁts = $58,400 + $194,667 + $4,000 = $257,067.
Notice that the estimated $30,000 annual expense savings for lawsuits and
maintenance of the crossing guard is not included in the annual beneﬁts calculation.
This savings will be experienced by the owners of the railroad, not by the city.
The costs of the overpass to the city are the construction of the overpass (less
its salvage value) and the increased maintenance costs. The cost engineer makes
the following estimates.
Annual Costs:
Capital recovery = $1,000,000(A/P, 8%, 40) −$100,000(A/F, 8%, 40) = $83,474
Increased maintenance = $5,000
Total annual costs = $83,474 + $5,000 = $88,474.

SECTION 10.11 / SUMMARY
467
Based on these estimates, the B–C ratio of the proposed overpass is
B–C Ratio = Annual beneﬁts
Annual costs
= $257,067
$88,474 = 2.91.
The cost engineer recommends to the city council that the new overpass be built
since the B–C ratio is greater than 1.0.
The cost engineer also advises the council that since the railroad company
stands to directly beneﬁt from the replacement of the existing grade crossing by
the overpass, it would not be unreasonable for the city to request a contribution to
the construction cost of the overpass. Given the railroad company’s cost of capital
of 15% per year and an estimated annual savings of $30,000, the cost engineer
calculates that the overpass is worth
PW(15%) = $30,000(P/A, 15%, 40) = $199,254
to the railroad. Any amount contributed by the railroad company would serve to
reduce the denominator of the B–C ratio, thereby increasing the value of the ratio.
The B–C ratio was computed to be 2.91 without any contribution by the railroad.
Therefore, the cost engineer concludes that the city should plan on constructing
the overpass regardless of whether or not the railroad company can be persuaded
to contribute ﬁnancially to the project.
This case illustrates some of the special issues associated with providing
economic evaluations of public-sector projects. While the B–C ratio is a useful
method for evaluating projected ﬁnancial performance of a public-sector project,
the quantiﬁcation of beneﬁts and costs may prove difﬁcult. As the case illustrates,
typically, surrogate or proxy measures are used in the estimation of beneﬁts and
costs. Also, it is especially important to remember the perspectives of the owners in
the evaluation of public projects—not necessarily the elected city council members,
but the taxpayers!
10.11
Summary
From the discussion and examples of public projects presented in this chapter,
it is apparent that, because of the methods of ﬁnancing, the absence of tax and
proﬁt requirements, and political and social factors, the criteria used in evaluating
privately ﬁnanced projects frequently cannot be applied to public works. Nor
should public projects be used as yardsticks with which to compare private projects.
Nevertheless, whenever possible, public works should be justiﬁed on an economic
basis to ensure that the public obtains the maximum return from the tax money
that is spent. Whether an engineer is working on such projects, is called upon to
serve as a consultant, or assists in the conduct of the B–C analysis, he or she is
bound by professional ethics to do his or her utmost to see that the projects and
the associated analyses are carried out in the best possible manner and within the
limitations of the legislation enacted for their authorization.
The B–C ratio has remained a popular method for evaluating the ﬁnancial
performance of public projects. Both the conventional and modiﬁed B–C ratio
methods have been explained and illustrated for the case of independent and
mutually exclusive projects. Aﬁnal note of caution: The best project among a mutually

468
CHAPTER 10 / EVALUATING PROJECTS WITH THE BENEFIT–COST RATIO METHOD
exclusive set of projects is not necessarily the one that maximizes the B–C ratio. In
this chapter, we have seen that an incremental analysis approach to evaluating
beneﬁts and costs is necessary to ensure the correct choice.

10-7. A toll bridge across the Mississippi River is being
considered as a replacement for the current I-40 bridge
linking Tennessee to Arkansas. Because this bridge, if
approved, will become a part of the U.S. Interstate
Highway system, the B–C ratio method must be applied
in the evaluation. Investment costs of the structure are
estimated to be $17,500,000, and $325,000 per year in
operating and maintenance costs are anticipated. In
addition, the bridge must be resurfaced every ﬁfth year
of its 30-year projected life at a cost of $1,250,000 per
occurrence (no resurfacing cost in year 30). Revenues
generated from the toll are anticipated to be $2,500,000
in its ﬁrst year of operation, with a projected annual
rate of increase of 2.25% per year due to the anticipated
annual increase in trafﬁc across the bridge. Assuming
zero market (salvage) value for the bridge at the end of
30 years and a MARR of 10% per year, should the toll
bridge be constructed? (10.7)
10-8. Refer back to Problem 10-7. Suppose that the
toll bridge can be redesigned such that it will have
a (virtually) inﬁnite life. MARR remains at 10% per
year. Revised costs and revenues (beneﬁts) are given
as follows: (10.7, 10.9)
Capital investment: $22,500,000
Annual operating and maintenance costs: $250,000
Resurface cost every seventh year: $1,000,000

expected to be $1,000,000 per year. Annual operating
and maintenance costs are $200,000 per year. A beneﬁt
of this alternative is that it is expected to attract new
industry, worth $500,000 per year, to the region.
Alternative B. Build a hydroelectric generating
facility.
The capital investment,

to periodic ﬂood damage that occurs, on the
average, every two years and results in a $2,000,000
loss. It has been proposed that the river channel be
straightened and deepened, at a cost of $2,500,000, to
reduce the probable damage to not over $1,600,000 for
each occurrence during a period of 20 years before
it would have to be deepened again. This procedure
would also involve annual expenditures of $80,000 for
minimal maintenance. One legislator in the area has
proposed that a better solution would be to construct
a ﬂood-control dam at a cost of $8,500,000, which
would last indeﬁnitely, with annual maintenance costs
of not over $50,000. He estimates that this project
would reduce the probable annual ﬂood damage to not
over $450,000. In addition, this solution would provide
a substantial amount of irrigation water that would
produce annual revenue of $175,000 and recreational
facilities, which he estimates would be worth at least
$45,000 per year to the adjacent populace. A second
legislator believes that the dam should be built and
that the river channel also should be straightened and
deepened, noting that the total cost of $11,000,000
would reduce the probable annual ﬂood loss to not
over $350,000 while providing the same irrigation and
recreational beneﬁts. If the state’s capital is worth
10%, determine the B–C ratios and the incremental
B–C ratio. Recommend which alternative should be
adopted. (10.9)

10-22. Ten years ago, the port of Secoma built a new
pier containing a large amount of steel work, at a cost
of $300,000, estimating that it would have a life of
50 years. The annual maintenance cost, much of it for
painting and repair caused by environmental damage,
has turned out to be unexpectedly high, averaging
$27,000. The port manager has proposed to the port
commission that this pier be replaced immediately with
a reinforced concrete pier at a construction cost of
$600,000. He assures them that this pier will have a life
of at least 50 years, with annual maintenance costs of not
over $2,000. He presents the information in Table P10-22
as justiﬁcation for the replacement, having determined
that the net market value of the existing pier is $40,000.
He has stated that, because the port earns a net
proﬁt of over $3,000,000 per year, the project could be
ﬁnanced out of annual earnings. Thus, there would be
no interest cost, and an annual savings of $19,000 would
be obtained by making the replacement. (10.9)

long, 20-foot-high levee, would have an investment
cost of $25,000,000 with annual upkeep costs estimated
at $725,000. A new roadway along the top of the
levee would provide two major beneﬁts: (1) improved
recreationalaccessforﬁshermenand(2)reductionofthe
driving distance between the towns at opposite ends of
the proposed levee by 11 miles. The annual beneﬁt for
the levee has been estimated at $1,500,000. The second
alternative, a channel-dredging operation, would have
an investment cost of $15,000,000. The annual cost of
maintaining the channel is estimated at $375,000. There
are no documented beneﬁts for the channel-dredging
project. Using a MARR of 8% and assuming a 25-year

should be chosen. (Note: The null alternative, Do

10-25. Extended Learning Exercise The Fox River is
bordered on the east by Illinois Route 25 and on the
west by Illinois Route 31. Along one stretch of the
river, there is a distance of 16 miles between adjacent
crossings. An additional crossing in this area has been
proposed, and three alternative bridge designs are
under consideration. Two of the designs have 25-year
useful lives, and the third has a useful life of 35 years.
Each bridge must be resurfaced periodically, and the
roadbed of each bridge will be replaced at the end of
its useful life, at a cost signiﬁcantly less than initial
construction costs. The annual beneﬁts of each design
differ on the basis of disruption to normal trafﬁc ﬂow
along Routes 25 and 31. Given the information in
Table P10-25, use the B–C ratio method to determine
which bridge design should be selected. Assume that
the selected design will be used indeﬁnitely, and use a

CHAPTER 11
Breakeven and Sensitivity
Analysis
Our aim in Chapter 11 is to illustrate breakeven and sensitivity methods
for investigating variability in outcomes of engineering projects.
Renting versus Purchasing a Home
A
common situation faced by young families is whether to rent or buy a home.
Many of the decision factors are speculative, such as the future resale value
of the house and how long the family will be in a particular area. For
example, what will be the resale value of a home currently valued at $150,000
ﬁve years from now? If you plan to stay in your current location for only three
years, should you rent or purchase a home? In this chapter, you will learn how to
evaluate decision problems such as this by examining the sensitivity of the decision
to changes in the estimates of selected factor estimates.

Money is the seed of money, and the ﬁrst guinea is sometimes more difﬁcult
to aquire than the second million.
—Jean Jacques Rousseau (1762)
11.1 Introduction
There is much common wisdom relating to uncertainty in Yogi Berra’s observation
about the future! In previous chapters, we presented speciﬁc assumptions concern-
ing revenues, costs, and other quantities important to an engineering economy
study. It was assumed that a high degree of conﬁdence could be placed in all
estimated values. That degree of conﬁdence is sometimes called assumed certainty.
Decisions made solely on the basis of this kind of analysis are sometimes called
decisions under certainty. The term is rather misleading in that there rarely is a case
in which the best of estimates of quantities can be assumed as certain.
In virtually all situations, there is doubt as to the ultimate economic results
that will be obtained from an engineering project. The motivation for breakeven
and sensitivity analysis is to establish the bounds of error in our estimates such
that another alternative being considered may become a better choice than the
one we recommended under assumed certainty. Thus, this chapter deals with
nonprobabilistic techniques for dealing with risk and uncertainty.
Breakeven analysis determines the value of a critical factor at which economic
trade-offs are balanced. It is also helpful in some situations to investigate how
sensitive a project’s economics are to variations in its estimates of life, interest
rate, initial capital investment, and so on. Sensitivity, in general, means the relative
magnitudeofchangeinthemeasureofmerit(suchaspresentworth[PW]orinternal
rate of return [IRR]) caused by one or more changes in estimated factor values. The
speciﬁc factors of concern will vary with each project, but one or more of them will
normally need to be further analyzed before the best decision can be made. Simply
stated, engineering economy studies focus on the future, and lack of knowledge
about the estimated economic results cannot be avoided.
In engineering economy studies, breakeven and sensitivity analysis are general
methodologies, readily available, that provide information about the potential
impact on equivalent worth due to variability in selected factor estimates. Their
routine use is fundamental to developing economic information useful in the
decision process.
11.2 Breakeven Analysis
When the selection between two engineering project alternatives (or outcomes) is
heavily dependent on a single factor, we can solve for the value of that factor at
which the conclusion is a standoff. That value is known as the breakeven point, that
is, the value at which we are indifferent between the two alternatives. (The use of
breakeven points with respect to production and sales volumes was discussed in
Chapter 2.) Then, if the best estimate of the actual outcome of the common factor is
higher or lower than the breakeven point, and assumed certain, the best alternative
becomes apparent.
476

SECTION 11.2 / BREAKEVEN ANALYSIS 477
In mathematical terms, we have
EWA = f1(y)
and
EWB = f2(y),
where
EWA = an equivalent worth (PW, annual worth [AW], or future worth
[FW]) calculation for the net cash ﬂow of Alternative A;
EWB = the same equivalent-worth calculation for the net cash ﬂow
of Alternative B;
y = a common factor of interest affecting the equivalent-worth
values of Alternative A and Alternative B.
Therefore, the breakeven point betweenAlternative A andAlternative B is the value
of factor y for which the two equivalent-worth values are equal. That is, EWA =
EWB, or fl(y) = f2(y), which may be solved for y.
Similarly, when the economic acceptability of an engineering project depends
upon the value of a single factor, say z, mathematically we can set an equivalent
worth of the project’s net cash ﬂow for the analysis period equal to zero [EW =
f(z) = 0] and solve for the breakeven value of z. That is, the breakeven value of z is
the value of z at which we would be indifferent (economically) between accepting
and rejecting the project. Then, if the best estimate of the value of z is higher or lower
than the breakeven point value, and assumed certain, the economic acceptability
of the project is known.
The following are examples of common factors for which breakeven analyses
might provide useful insights into the decision problem:
1. Annual revenue and expenses. Solve for the annual revenue required to equal
(breakeven with) annual expenses. Breakeven annual expenses of an alternative
can also be determined in a pairwise comparison when revenues are identical
for both alternatives being considered.
2. Rate of return. Solve for the rate of return on the increment of invested capital at
which two given alternatives are equally desirable.
3. Minimum attractive rate of return. Solve for the interest rate value that would
result in indifference as to the preference for an alternative.
4. Equipment life. Solve for the useful life required for an engineering project to be
economically justiﬁed.
5. Capacity utilization. Solve for the hours of utilization per year, for example,
at which an alternative is justiﬁed or at which two alternatives are equally
desirable.
The usual breakeven problem involving two alternatives can be most easily
approached mathematically by equating an equivalent worth of the two
alternatives expressed as a function of the factor of interest. Using the same
approach for the economic acceptability of an engineering project, we can
mathematically equate an equivalent worth of the project to zero as a function
of the factor of concern. In breakeven studies, project lives may or may not
be equal, so care should be taken to determine whether the coterminated or
repeatability assumption best ﬁts the situation.

478
CHAPTER 11 / BREAKEVEN AND SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
The following examples illustrate both mathematical and graphical solutions
to typical breakeven problems involving one or more engineering projects.
EXAMPLE 11-1
Single Project Breakeven Analysis: Solar Panels
Ahomeowner is considering whether to invest in solar panels. This homeowner
has gathered the following information for her town:
• The average cost for residential energy is $0.124/kWh.
• The government subsidizes 70% of whatever is invested by the household.
• Each square foot of panel produces 19.13 kWh every year.
• The cost of installation per square foot of solar panel is $93.91.
The house has 350 square feet of roof space. What is the breakeven point in years
for the installation of solar panels? Assume the homeowner’s interest rate is 6%
per year.
Solution
The breakeven point is where the annual savings from the solar panels offsets
the initial investment. The initial investment is calculated as follows.
350 square feet of roof space × $93.91/square foot = $32,869
With a 70% government subsidy, the purchase price is (0.3)($32,869) = $9,861.
To ﬁnd the breakeven point in years (X), we set the purchase price equal to the
potential energy savings.
$9,861 = (350 square feet)(19.13 kWh/sq ft-year)($0.124/kWh)(P/A, 6%, X)
$9,861 = ($830.24)(P/A, 6%, X)
11.87 = (P/A, 6%, X)
From Table C-9 (i = 6%), we see that 21 ≤X ≤22 years. It would take
approximately 22 years of energy savings to offset the installation cost of the
solar panels. A graph of this breakeven situation is shown in Figure 11-1.

SECTION 11.2 / BREAKEVEN ANALYSIS 479
EXAMPLE 11-2
Two Alternative Breakeven Analysis: Hybrid Vehicles
Gas-electric (so-called hybrid) vehicles save on gasoline consumption by shut-
ting off the vehicle’s engine while idling, giving the vehicle a boost of electric
power during acceleration, and capturing electrical energy while braking. In
addition to environmental beneﬁts, the primary monetary beneﬁt to the owner
is reduced fuel cost as a result of improved gas mileage. The trade-off, however,
is that the purchase price of the hybrid vehicle is higher than that of a standard
gasoline-only fueled vehicle.
Consider a hybrid vehicle with a sticker price of $31,500. This vehicle will
average 30 miles per gallon of gasoline. A tax credit∗of $1,500 for the hybrid
vehicle effectively reduces its sticker price to $30,000. A comparably equipped
gasoline-only vehicle will cost $28,000 and will average 25 miles per gallon of
gasoline. Assuming an interest rate of 3% per year and a study period of ﬁve
years, ﬁnd the breakeven cost of gasoline ($/gal) if the vehicle will be driven
18,000 miles each year.
Solution
To ﬁnd the cost of gasoline that makes you indifferent between the two vehicles,
you need to develop an equivalent-worth equation in terms of the factor of
interest—the cost of gasoline. In this simple example, we are only considering
the sticker price (investment cost) and fuel cost (annual expenses). By default,
we are assuming that the maintenance of the two vehicles will be the same as
will the future resale value.
In this example, we develop equivalent uniform annual cost (EUAC)
expressions for each of the vehicles. Letting X = cost of gasoline, we get the
following EUAC equations.
Hybrid:
EUACH(3%) = ($31,500 −$1,500)(A/P, 3%, 5)
+($X/gal)
!18,000 mi/year
30 mi/gal
"
Gas-only:
EUACG(3%) = $28,000(A/P, 3%, 5) + ($X/gal)
!18,000 mi/year
25 mi/gal
"
Setting EUACH(3%) = EUACG(3%) and solving for X, we ﬁnd the breakeven
cost of gasoline to be
X = $3.64/gal.
Figure 11-2 shows the breakeven chart for these vehicles as a function of the cost
of gasoline. If our best estimate of the average cost of gasoline over the next ﬁve
years is less than $3.64 per gallon, then purchasing a traditional gasoline-only
vehicle is more economical. The hybrid would be the vehicle of choice if the cost
of gasoline is projected to be higher than $3.64 per gallon.
∗The Energy Policy Act of 2005 provides for certain tax credits for purchasers of hybrid and other alternatively
fueled vehicles. Very speciﬁc requirements must be met. The $1,500 used in the example is for demonstration
purposes only.

In this example, we only considered the easily measured monetary beneﬁt of

reduced emissions and more efﬁcient use of a scarce resource.
EXAMPLE 11-3
Three Alternative Breakeven Analysis: Hours of Operation
Suppose that there are three alternative electric motors capable of providing
100 horsepower (hp) output. These motors differ in their purchase price, main-
tenance costs, and efﬁciency. The efﬁciency of the motor impacts the energy cost
of the motor. Speciﬁc data are listed below.

If we look at the annual cost of owning and operating a motor, a factor of
interest is the hours of operation, which drives the energy cost of the motor.
Over what range of hours operated per year (at full load) is the Beta motor the
best choice? How many hours would the motor have to be operated each year

SECTION 11.2 / BREAKEVEN ANALYSIS 481
before the Gamma motor is the most economical? Use a spreadsheet to answer
these questions. Assume that the minimum attractive rate of return (MARR) =
15% per year, the study period is 5 years, and none of the motors will have a
market value after 5 years.
Spreadsheet Solution
Because we are dealing with costs only in this example (revenues are assumed
to be equal), we use the EUAC metric to solve for the breakeven points between
the motors. The basic equation used to develop the spreadsheet model is
EUAC(15%) = Purchase price (A/P, 15%, 5) + Annual maintenance
+Annual energy cost
The energy cost portion of the equation can be expressed in terms of the hours
of operation.
Energy cost = (Operating hours/year)($0.05/kWh)
!(100 hp)(0.746 kW/hp)
Motor efﬁciency
"
For instance, the annual energy expense of the Alpha motor is
(X hours/year)($0.05/kWh)
!(100 hp)(0.746 kW/hp)
0.74
"
= $5.04 X
where X is the annual hours of operation. We can now solve for the breakeven
point between each pair of motors.
Figure 11-3 shows the spreadsheet model. The Goal Seek function was used
to solve for the individual breakeven points between motors (cells B18, B21, and
B24). In Goal Seek (under the Tools menu), the spreadsheet software changes
the value of a single cell (hours of operation in this example) to ﬁnd the value
that sets a different cell (difference in EUAC) equal to a target amount ($0).

The breakeven graph is shown in Figure 11-4. The numbers at the bottom of
Figure 11-3 (cells A27:D38) are used to generate the breakeven chart. Although
we solved for the exact values of the breakeven points, the graph is useful in
reminding us which motor is preferred over which range of operating hours. In
summary, the Alpha motor is preferred if annual operating hours are less than
1,694; the Gamma motor would be selected if annual operating hours are greater
than 4,389; otherwise the Beta motor is the most economical choice.

11.3 Sensitivity Analysis
Sensitivity analysis is used to explore what happens to a project’s proﬁtability
when the estimated value of study factors are changed. For example, if annual
expensesturnouttobe10%higherthanexpected, willtheprojectstillbeacceptable?
Sometimes, sensitivity is speciﬁcally deﬁned to mean the percent change in one or
more factors that will reverse a decision among project alternatives or reverse a
decision about the economic acceptability of a single project. This percent change
is called sensitivity with respect to decision reversal. Example 11-4 shows the
calculation of decision reversal points.
Another useful sensitivity tool is the spiderplot. This approach makes explicit
the impact of variability in the estimates of each factor of concern on the economic
measure of merit. Example 11-5 demonstrates this technique by plotting the
results of changes in the estimates of several factors, separately, on the PW of
an engineering project. Spreadsheet applications provide an excellent capability to
answer what if questions and are useful for generating the spiderplot.
EXAMPLE 11-4
Decision Reversal
Consider a proposal to enhance the vision system used by a postal service to
sort mail. The new system is estimated to cost $1.1 million and will incur an
additional $200,000 per year in maintenance costs. The system will produce
annual savings of $500,000 each year (primarily by decreasing the percentage of
misdirectedmailandreducingtheamountofmailthatmustbesortedmanually).
The MARR is 10% per year, and the study period is ﬁve years at which time the

484
CHAPTER 11 / BREAKEVEN AND SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
system will be technologically obsolete (worthless). The PW of this proposal is
PW(10%) = −$1,100,000 + ($500,000 −$200,000)(P/A, 10%, 5) = $37,236.
Determine how sensitive the decision to invest in the system is to the estimates
of investment cost and annual savings.
Solution
Our initial appraisal of the project shows it to be a proﬁtable venture. Now let’s
look at what happens if we are wrong in our estimates. Essentially, we need
to ﬁnd the breakeven investment cost and the breakeven annual savings. Let
x be the percent change in investment cost that would cause us to reverse our
decision. Then
PW(10%) = 0 = −$1,100,000(1 + x) + ($500,000 −$200,000) (P/A, 10%, 5)
x = +3.4%.
Similarly, let y be the percent change in annual savings.
PW(10%) = 0 = −$1,100,000 + [$500,000(1 + y) −$200,000] (P/A, 10%, 5)
y = −2.0%
If the investment cost increases by more than 3.4%, the new vision system would
no longer be acceptable. Likewise, if the estimate of annual savings is lower
by more than 2% of its most likely value, the project would be a no-go. The
responsible engineer now needs to take a hard look at how the original estimates
were made and decide whether or not more detailed estimates are required.
Note
When examining the impact of changing one estimate value, all other factor
values are held at their original amounts.
EXAMPLE 11-5
Spiderplot for the Proposed Vision System
We will now further explore the sensitivity of the proposed vision system by
creating a spiderplot. The best (most likely) estimates for the vision system
described in Example 11-4 are listed below.
Capital investment, I
$1,100,000
Annual savings, A
500,000
Annual expenses, E

We are interested in investigating the sensitivity of the PW of the system over a
range of ±20% changes in all of the above estimates. Recall that the useful life
of the system is ﬁve years.

SECTION 11.3 / SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS 485
Spreadsheet Solution
Figure 11-5(a) shows the table of PW values as each factor of the PW calculations
is varied over a range of ±20% from the most likely estimate. Each column has a
unique formula that refers to the factors located in the range C2:C6 to determine
PW. The particular factor of interest—for example, the capital investment in
column B—is multiplied by the factor (1 + percent change as a decimal) to create
the table. You can verify your formulas by noting that all columns are equal at
the most likely value (percent change = 0). The cell formulas in the range B9:E9
(listed below) are simply copied down the columns to complete the spreadsheet.

The spiderplot in Figure 11-5(b) shows the sensitivity of the PW to percent
deviation changes in each factor’s best estimate. The other factors are assumed
to remain at their most likely values. The PW of this project based on the best
estimates of the factors is
PW(10%) = −$1,100,000 + ($500,000 −$200,000)(P/A, 10%, 5) = $37,236.

(continued)
This value of the highly favorable PW occurs at the common intersection point
of the percent deviation graphs for the four separate project factors. The relative
degree of sensitivity of the PW to each factor is indicated by the slope of the curves (the
steeper the slope of a curve the more sensitive the PW is to the factor). Also, the
intersection of each curve with the abscissa (PW = 0) shows the decision reversal
point—the percent change from each factor’s most likely value at which the PW
is zero. Based on the spiderplot, we see that the PW is insensitive to the MARR
but quite sensitive to changes in the capital investment, annual savings, and
annual expenses. Such an analytical tool as the spiderplot can assist with the
insightful exploration of the variable aspects of an engineering economy study.
For additional information, consider using the sensitivity graph technique
to compare two or more mutually exclusive project alternatives. If only two
alternatives are being compared, a spiderplot based on the incremental cash ﬂow
between the alternatives can be used to aid in the selection of the preferred
alternative. Extending this approach to three alternatives, two sequential paired
comparisons can be used to help select the preferred alternative. Another approach
is to plot (overlay) in the same ﬁgure a sensitivity graph for each alternative.
Obviously, if this latter approach is used for the comparison of more than, say,
three alternatives (with two or three factors each), interpreting the results may
become a problem.

EXAMPLE 11-6
Rent or Purchase a Home?
In this example, we return to the decision problem discussed in the chapter
opener: Is it more economical to purchase or rent a home? Evaluate the
economics of renting versus buying a $150,000 home and living in it for ﬁve
years. Use the data below in your analysis.∗
Rental Option: Rent is $1,200 per month for the ﬁrst year. The monthly rental fee will
increase by $25 for each subsequent year of renting. There is also a $1,200 deposit
payable when the lease is signed and refundable when the house is left in good
condition. Renter’s insurance is $35 per month.
Purchase Option: A$30,000 down payment is made, so $120,000 will be ﬁnanced with a
30-year mortgage having a 7% annual interest rate. Additional closing costs of $2,000
are paid at the time of purchase. Property taxes and homeowners’ insurance total $200
per month, and maintenance is expected to average $50 per month. The resale value
of the home after ﬁve years is anticipated to be $160,000. The commission paid to the
realtor at the time of the sale is expected to be 7% of the selling price.
If your personal interest rate is 10% per year (compounded monthly), is it more
economical to rent or purchase this home? Examine the sensitivity of the decision
to changes in the resale value of the home, the mortgage rate, and the length of
ownership.

Now we will examine the sensitivity of this decision to changes in the most
likely estimates of the future resale value of the home, the mortgage rate, and the
length of ownership. Figure 11-7 is a spiderplot of the incremental PW. The dif-
ference in PW of the purchase versus rent alternatives is plotted against the
percent change in the factors of interest. The slope of the lines tells us that
the decision to purchase rather than rent is most sensitive to changes in the
future selling price of the home. The least sensitive of these three factors is
the length of ownership. The Goal Seek function of Excel returns the following
breakeven values for these factors. Note that all other factors are held at their

11.4 Multiple Factor Sensitivity Analysis
In the previous section, we looked at the impact of changing a single factor estimate
on the equivalent worth of a project (all other values were held constant). We
are often concerned about the combined effects of changes in two or more project
factors. In this situation, the following approach can be used to develop additional
information.
1. Develop a sensitivity graph (spiderplot) for the project as discussed in
Section 11.3. For the most sensitive factors, try to develop improved estimates
and reduce the range of variability before proceeding further with the analysis.
2. Select the most sensitive project factors based on the information in the
sensitivity graph. Analyze the combined effects of these factors on the project’s
economic measure of merit by determining the impact of selected combinations
of three or more factors. (These combinations are sometimes called scenarios.)

490
CHAPTER 11 / BREAKEVEN AND SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
The combined impact of changes in the best estimate values for three or
more factors on the economic measure of merit for an engineering project can
be analyzed by using selected combinations of the changes. This approach and the
Optimistic-Most Likely-Pessimistic (O-ML-P) technique of estimating factor values
are illustrated in Example 11-7.
An optimistic estimate for a factor is one that is in the favorable direction (say,
the minimum capital investment cost). The most likely value for a factor is deﬁned
for our purposes as the best estimate value. The pessimistic estimate for a factor
is one that is in the unfavorable direction (say, the maximum capital investment
cost). In applications of this technique, the optimistic condition for a factor is often
speciﬁed as a value that has 19 out of 20 chances of being better than the actual
outcome. Similarly, the pessimistic condition has 19 out of 20 chances of being
worse than the actual outcome. In operational terms, the optimistic condition for
a factor is the value when things occur as well as can be reasonably expected, and
the pessimistic estimate is the value when things occur as detrimentally as can be
reasonably expected.
EXAMPLE 11-7
Optimistic-Most Likely-Pessimistic (O-ML-P) Scenarios
Consider a proposed ultrasound inspection device for which the optimistic,
and most likely, pessimistic estimates are given in Table 11-1. The MARR is
8% per year. Also shown at the end of Table 11-1 are the AWs for all three
estimation conditions. Based on this information, analyze the combined effects
of uncertainty in the factors on the AW value.
Solution
Step 1: Before proceeding further with the solution, we need to evaluate the
two extreme values of the AW. As shown at the end of Table 11-1, the AW for
the optimistic estimates is very favorable ($73,995), whereas the AW for the
pessimistic estimates is quite unfavorable (−$33,100). If both extremeAW values
were positive, we would make a go decision with respect to the device without
further analysis, because no combination of factor values based on the estimates
will result in AW less than zero. By similar reasoning, if all AW values were
negative, a no-go decision would be made regarding the device. In this example,

however, the decision is sensitive to other combinations of outcomes, and we
proceed to Steps 2 and 3.
Step 2: A sensitivity graph (spiderplot) for this situation is needed to show
explicitly the sensitivity of the AW to the three factors of concern: useful life,
N; annual revenues, R; and annual expenses, E. The spiderplot is shown in
Figure 11-8. The curves for N, R, and E plot percent deviation changes from the
most likely (best) estimate, over the range of values deﬁned by the optimistic
and pessimistic estimates for each factor, versus AW. As additional information,
a curve is also shown for MARR versus AW. Based on the spiderplot, AW for
the proposed ultrasound device appears very sensitive to annual revenues and
quite sensitive to annual expenses and reductions in useful life. Even if we were
to signiﬁcantly change the MARR (8%), however, it would have little impact
on the AW.
Step 3: The various combinations of the optimistic, most likely, and
pessimistic factor values (outcomes) for annual revenues, useful life, and annual
expenses need to be analyzed for their combined impacts on the AW. The results
for these 27 (3 × 3 × 3) combinations are shown in Table 11-2.
Making the AW Results Easier to Interpret
Since the AW values in Table 11-2 result from estimates subject to differing
degrees of variation, little information of value would be lost if the numbers were
rounded to the nearest thousand dollars. Further, suppose that management is
most interested in the number of combinations of outcomes in which AW is,

say, (1) more than $50,000 and (2) less than $0. Table 11-3 shows how Table 11-2
might be changed to make it easier to interpret and use in communicating the
AW results to management.
From Table 11-3, it is apparent that four combinations result inAW > $50,000,
while nine produce AW < $0. Each combination of conditions is not necessarily
equally likely. Therefore, statements such as “there are 9 chances out of 27 that
we will lose money on this project” are not appropriate.
It is clear that, even with a few factors, and using the O-ML-P estimating
technique, the number of possible combinations of conditions in a sensitivity
analysis can become quite large, and the task of investigating all of them might be
quite time-consuming. One goal of progressive sensitivity analysis is to eliminate
from detailed consideration those factors for which the measure of merit is quite

PROBLEMS 493
insensitive, highlighting the conditions for other factors to be studied further in
accordance with the degree of sensitivity of each. Thus, the number of combinations
of conditions included in the analysis can perhaps be kept to a manageable size.
11.5 Summary
Engineering economy involves decision making among competing uses of scarce
capital resources. The consequences of these decisions usually extend far into the
future. In this chapter, we have used techniques to deal with the realization that the
consequences or outcomes (cash ﬂows, useful lives, etc.) of engineering projects
can never be known with absolute certainty.
Several of the most commonly applied and useful procedures for dealing with
the variability of estimates in engineering economy studies have been presented in
this chapter. Breakeven analysis determines the value of a key common factor, such
as utilization of capacity, at which the economic desirability of two alternatives is
equal or a project is economically justiﬁed. This breakeven point is then compared
to an independent estimate of the factor’s most likely (best estimate) value to assist
with the selection between alternatives or to make a decision about a project. The
sensitivity graph technique makes explicit the impact of variations in the estimates
of each project factor of concern on the economic measure of merit, and it is a
valuable analysis tool. The technique discussed in Section 11.4 for evaluating the
combined impact of changes in two or more factors is important when additional
information is needed to assist decision making.
Regrettably, there is no quick and easy answer to the question, How should
variability best be considered in an engineering economic analysis? Generally,
simple procedures (e.g., sensitivity analysis) allow reasonable discrimination
among alternatives to be made or the acceptability of a project to be determined on
the basis of the variations present, and they are relatively inexpensive to apply. So
Yogi Berra is right—prediction is usually difﬁcult, especially about the future!
Problems
The number in parentheses that follows each problem
refers to the section from which the problem is taken.
11-1. The Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) has
just opened a new subway line (the Orange Line) in
its underground transportation network. The Orange
Line had a capital investment of $20 million, expected
operating and maintenance expenses are $3 million
per year, and the ﬁnal salvage value at the end of
a 40-year life is negligible. If the revenue generated
by each customer is $3, how many customers per
day will be required before the Orange Line can
break even? The MTA’s hurdle (interest) rate is 5%
compounded annually. Assume there are 365 days in
a year. (11.2)
11-2. Refer to Example 11-2. Assuming gasoline
costs $4.00 per gallon, ﬁnd the breakeven mileage
per year between the hybrid vehicle and the gas-only
vehicle. All other factors remain the same.
11-3. The Universal Postal Service is consider-
ing the possibility of ﬁxing wind deﬂectors on
the tops of 500 of their long-haul tractors. Three types of
deﬂectors, with the following characteristics, are being
considered (MARR = 10% per year):

If 5% in drag reduction means 2% in fuel savings per
mile, how many miles do the tractors have to be driven
per year before the windshear deﬂector is favored over
the other deﬂectors? Over what range of miles driven
per year is air-vantage the best choice? (Note: Fuel
cost is expected to be $4.00 per gallon, and average
fuel consumption is 5 miles per gallon without the
deﬂectors.) State any assumptions you make. (11.2)
11-4. In planning a small two-story ofﬁce building, the
architect has submitted two designs. The ﬁrst provides
foundation and structural details so that two additional
stories can be added to the required initial two stories
at a later date and without modiﬁcations to the original
structure. This building would cost $1,400,000. The
second design, without such provisions, would cost
only$1,250,000. Iftheﬁrstplanisadopted, anadditional
two stories could be added at a later date at a cost
of $850,000. If the second plan is adopted, however,
considerable strengthening and reconstruction would
be required, which would add $300,000 to the cost of
a two-story addition. Assuming that the building is
expected to be needed for 75 years, by what time would
the additional two stories have to be built to make the
adoption of the ﬁrst design justiﬁed? MARR is 10% per
year. (11.2)

a. At what level of operation (hours per year) would
you be indifferent between the two pumping
systems? If the pumping system is expected to
operate 2,000 hours per year, which system should
be recommended?
b. Perform a sensitivity analysis on the efﬁciency of
Pump A. Over what range of pumping efﬁciency is
Pump A preferred to Pump B? Assume 2,000 hours

Plot the AW of each alternative against MARR as the
MARR varies across this range: 4%, 8%, 12%, 16%, and

MARR for which each alternative is preferred? (11.2)
11-9. Your company operates a ﬂeet of light trucks that
are used to provide contract delivery services. As the
engineering and technical manager, you are analyzing
the purchase of 55 new trucks as an addition to the ﬂeet.
These trucks would be used for a new contract the sales
staff is trying to obtain. If purchased, the trucks would
cost $21,200 each; estimated use is 20,000 miles per year
per truck; estimated operation and maintenance and
other related expenses (year-zero dollars) are $0.45 per
mile, which is forecasted to increase at the rate of 5%
per year; and the trucks are MACRS (GDS) three-year
property class assets. The analysis period is four years;
t = 38%; MARR = 15% per year (after taxes; includes
an inﬂation component); and the estimated MV at the
end of four years (in year-zero dollars) is 35% of the
purchase price of the vehicles. This estimate is expected
to increase at the rate of 2% per year.
Based on an after-tax, actual-dollar analysis, what is
the annual revenue required by your company from the
contract to justify these expenditures before any proﬁt is
considered? This calculated amount for annual revenue
is the breakeven point between purchasing the trucks
and which other alternative? (11.2, Chapters 7 and 8)
11-10. Anationwide motel chain is considering locating
a new motel in Bigtown, USA. The cost of building a
150-room motel (excluding furnishings) is $5 million.
The ﬁrm uses a 15-year planning horizon to evaluate
investments of this type. The furnishings for this motel
must be replaced every ﬁve years at an estimated cost of
$1,875,000 (at k = 0, 5, and 10). The old furnishings have
no market value. Annual operating and maintenance
expenses for the facility are estimated to be $125,000.
The market value of the motel after 15 years is estimated
to be 20% of the original building cost.
Rooms at the motel are projected to be rented at an
average rate of $45 per night. On the average, the motel
will rent 60% of its rooms each night. Assume the motel
will be open 365 days per year. MARR is 10% per year.
(11.3)
a. Using an annual-worth measure of merit, is the
project economically attractive?
b. Investigate
sensitivity
to
decision
reversal
for
the following three factors: (1) capital investment,
(2) MARR, and (3) occupancy rate (average percent
of rooms rented per night). To which of these factors
is the decision most sensitive?
c. Graphically investigate the sensitivity of the AW
to changes in the above three factors. Investigate
changes over the interval ±40%. On your graph, use
percent change as the x-axis and AW as the y-axis.
11-11. A large city in the mid-West needs to acquire a
street-cleaning machine to keep its roads looking nice
year round. A used cleaning vehicle will cost $85,000
and have a $20,000 market (salvage) value at the end of
its ﬁve-year life. A new system with advanced features
will cost $150,000 and have a $40,000 market value
at the end of its ﬁve-year life. The new system is
expected to reduce labor hours compared with the used
system. Current street-cleaning activity requires the
used system to operate 8 hours per day for 20 days
per month. Labor costs $50 per hour (including fringe
beneﬁts), and MARR is 12% per year. (11.2)
a. Find the breakeven percent reduction in labor hours
for the new system.
b. If the new system is expected to be able to reduce
labor hours by 17% compared with the used system,
which machine should the city purchase?
11-12. Refer to Problem 11-11. The best estimate for
the reduction of labor hours for the new system is
17% (compared with the used system). Investigate how
sensitive the decision is to (a) changes in the MARR,
(b) changes in the market value of the new system, and
(c) the productivity improvement of the new system.
Graph your results. Hint: Think incrementally! (11.3)
11-13. A group of private investors borrowed $30
million to build 300 new luxury apartments near a large
university. The money was borrowed at 6% annual
interest, and the loan is to be repaid in equal annual
amounts over a 40-year period. Annual operating,
maintenance, and insurance expenses are estimated to

496
CHAPTER 11 / BREAKEVEN AND SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
be $4,000 per apartment. This expense will be incurred
even if an apartment is vacant. The rental fee for each
apartment will be $12,000 per year, and the worst-case
occupancy rate is projected to be 80%. Investigate the
sensitivity of annual proﬁt (or loss) to (a) changes in
the occupancy rate and (b) changes in the annual rental
fee. (11.3)

The company is inclined to make the investment;
however, the managers are nervous because all of the
cash ﬂows and the useful life are approximate values.
The capital investment is known to be within ±5%.
Annual expenses are known to be within ±10%. The
annual revenue, market value, and useful life estimates
are known to be within ±20%. (11.3)
a. Analyze the sensitivity of PW to changes in each
estimate individually. Based on your results, make
a recommendation regarding whether or not they
should proceed with this project. Graph your results
for presentation to management.
b. The company can perform market research and/or
collect more data to improve the accuracy of these
estimates. Rank these variables by ordering them
in accordance with the need for more accurate
estimates (from highest need to lowest need).
11-15. An industrial machine costing $14,000 will
produce net cash savings of $5,000 per year. The
machine has a ﬁve-year useful life but must be returned
to the factory for major repairs after three years of
operation. These repairs cost $5,000. The company’s
MARR is 10% per year. What IRR will be earned on
the purchase of this machine? Analyze the sensitivity of
IRR to ± $2,000 changes in the repair cost. (11.3)
11-16. You
have
decided
to
purchase
a
new automobile with a hybrid-fueled engine and
a six-speed transmission. After the trade-in of your
present car, the purchase price of the new automobile is
$30,000. This balance can be ﬁnanced by the auto dealer
at 2.9% APR (compounded monthly) and repaid over
48 monthly payments. Alternatively, you can get an
instant rebate on the purchase price if you ﬁnance the
loan balance at an APR of 8.9% (compounded monthly)
over 48 months. Determine the amount of the instant
rebate that would make you indifferent between the
ﬁnancing plans. (11.2)
11-17. Two trafﬁc signal systems are being con-
sidered for an intersection. One system costs
$32,000 for installation and has an efﬁciency rating of
78%, requires 28 kW power (output), incurs a user cost
of $0.24 per vehicle, and has a life of 10 years. A second
system costs $45,000 to install, has an efﬁciency rating
of 90%, requires 34 kW power (output), has a user cost
of $0.22 per vehicle, and has a life of 15 years. Annual
maintenance costs are $75 and $100,
respectively.

verting from a coal-burning furnace to one that
burns either fuel oil or natural gas. The cost of con-
verting to fuel oil is estimated to be $80,000 initially;
annual operating expenses are estimated to be $4,000
less than that experienced when using the coal furnace.
Approximately 140,000 Btus are produced per gallon of
fuel oil; fuel oil is anticipated to cost $2.20 per gallon.
The cost of converting to natural gas is estimated to
be $60,000 initially; additionally, annual operating and
maintenance expenses are estimated to be $6,000 less
than that for the coal-burning furnace. Approximately
1,000Btusareproducedpercubicfootofnaturalgas; itis
estimated that natural gas will cost $0.04 per cubic foot.
A planning horizon of 20 years is to be used.
Zero market values and a MARR of 10% per year
are appropriate. Perform a sensitivity analysis for
the annual Btu requirement for the heating system.
(Hint: First calculate the breakeven number of Btus (in
thousands). Then determine AWs if Btu requirement
varies over ±30% of the breakeven amount.) (11.3)

road. Engineers have determined that trafﬁc density on
the new road will justify a two-lane road and a bridge
at the present time. Because of uncertainty regarding
future use of the road, the time at which an extra two
lanes will be required is currently being studied.
The two-lane bridge will cost $200,000 and the four-
lane bridge, if built initially, will cost $350,000. The
future cost of widening a two-lane bridge to four lanes
will be an extra $200,000 plus $25,000 for every year that
widening is delayed. The MARR used by the highway
department is 12% per year. The following estimates

Be sure to clearly state your assumptions. (11.3)
a. How sensitive is the decision to the amount of the
down payment for the purchase option? If a down
payment of less than 20% is used, you will need
to account for monthly mortgage insurance (about
$56/month).
b. How sensitive is the decision to the type of mortgage
acquired? You can look at different repayment
periods (15 or 20 years) as well as the impact of

11-24. We know the standard means of cutting
the high cost of driving our automobiles—slow
down your speed, no jack rabbit starts, inﬂate tires
properly, clean air ﬁlters regularly, and so on. Another
way to reduce the cost of driving is to join every
big-rigger in the United States and half of Europe—
go diesel. Diesels are inherently more efﬁcient than
gasoline engines because they deliver a third better fuel
mileage. They also offer a reliable high-torque engine!
The initial extra sticker price of a diesel-fueled car is
about $1,200. Agallon of diesel fuel costs about the same
as a gallon of gasoline. Assume your gasoline-fueled car
averages 24–27 miles per gallon. You drive an average
of 20,000 miles per year, and your personal MARR is in
the 12–15% per year ballpark. Develop a spreadsheet
to compare the economics of driving 100,000 miles
in your car fueled by gasoline versus diesel. Explore
various what if questions that you have regarding this
comparison. (11.3)

11-27. The world’s largest carpet maker has
just completed a feasibility study of what to do
with the 16,000 tons of overruns, rejects, and remnants
it produces every year. The company’s CEO launched
the feasibility study by asking, Why pay someone to
dig coal out of the ground and then pay someone else
to put our waste into a landﬁll? Why not just burn
our own waste? The company is proposing to build
a $10-million power plant to burn its waste as fuel,
thereby saving $2.8 million a year in coal purchases.
Company engineers have determined that the waste-
burning plant will be environmentally sound, and after
its four-year study period the plant can be sold to a local
electric utility for $5 million.
The ﬁrm’s MARR is 15%. Develop a spreadsheet
to investigate the sensitivity of the proposal’s PW
to changes in the estimates of (a) initial investment
amount,
(b) annual savings of fuel cost,
and (c)
future resale value of the plant. To which factor is
the decision most sensitive? Include in your solution

recycling glassware in general. However, this is not the
case for CFLs. Disposing of CFLs is complicated by the
fact that each lamp contains a small amount of mercury,
which is a very environmentally dangerous substance.
Write a brief report of your ﬁndings for your boss for
each of the following scenarios (11.3):
a. Develop an Excel spreadsheet to investigate the
sensitivity of choice of lighting systems when the
CFL disposal cost varies from $1.00 to $5.00 per

b. Use your spreadsheet to explore the sensitivity of
bulb or lamp choice as the cost of electricity varies

replacement. The new bridge would cost $X and would
last for 20 years. Annual maintenance costs for the
new bridge are estimated to be $24,000. People will be
charged a toll of $0.25 per car to use the new bridge.
Annual car trafﬁc is estimated at 400,000 cars. The
cost of collecting the toll consists of annual salaries
for ﬁve collectors at $10,000 per collector. The existing
bridge can be refurbished for $1,600,000 and would
need to be replaced in 20 years. There would be
additional refurbishing costs of $70,000 every ﬁve years
and regular annual maintenance costs of $20,000 for

CHAPTER 12
Probabilistic Risk Analysis
The aim of Chapter 12 is to discuss and illustrate several probabilistic
methods that are useful in analyzing risk and uncertainty associated
with engineering economy studies.
The Risks of Global Warming∗
R
isk is a condition where there is a possibility of adverse
deviation from a desired and expected outcome. The risks
of global climate change caused by carbon dioxide and other
greenhouse gases include heightened regulation, revenue loss, and increased
physical property impairment. Opportunities for mitigating the risks associated
with climate change are numerous: increased efﬁciency of energy production and
use, improved agricultural practices, and carbon capture and sequestration are
just a few of the choices we have. In this chapter, you will learn how various
probabilistic techniques can be used to assess the risks of engineering projects
such as those that mitigate the effects of global warming.

Higher risk is what we pay for higher return.

12.1 Introduction
In previous chapters, we stated speciﬁc assumptions concerning applicable reven-
ues, costs, and other quantities important to an engineering economy analysis. It
was assumed that a high degree of conﬁdence could be placed in all estimated
values. That degree of conﬁdence is sometimes called assumed certainty. Decisions
made solely on the basis of this kind of analysis are sometimes called decisions under
certainty. The term is rather misleading in that there rarely is a case in which the
best of estimates of quantities can be assumed as certain.
We now consider the more realistic situation in which estimated future
quantities are uncertain and project outcomes are risky. The motivation for dealing
with risk and uncertainty is to establish the bounds of error such that another
alternative being considered may turn out to be a better choice than the one we
recommended under assumed certainty.
Both risk and uncertainty in decision-making activities are caused by lack of
precise knowledge regarding future business conditions, technological develop-
ments, synergies among funded projects, and so on. Decisions under risk are
decisions in which the analyst models the decision problem in terms of assumed
possible future outcomes, or scenarios, whose probabilities of occurrence can
be estimated. A decision under uncertainty, by contrast, is a decision problem
characterized by several unknown futures for which probabilities of occurrence
cannot be estimated. In reality, the difference between risk and uncertainty is
somewhat arbitrary.
The probability that a cost, revenue, useful life, or other factor value will occur,
or that a particular equivalent-worth or rate-of-return value for a cash ﬂow will
occur, is usually considered to be the long-run relative frequency with which the
event (value) occurs or the subjectively estimated likelihood that it will occur.
Factors such as these, having probabilistic outcomes, are called random variables.
For example, the cash-ﬂow amounts for an alternative, such as CO2 capture and
sequestration at a power plant, often result from the sum, difference, product, or
quotient of random variables. In such cases, the measures of proﬁtability (e.g.,
equivalent-worth and rate-of-return values) of an alternative’s cash ﬂows will also
be random variables.
The information about these random variables, which is particularly helpful
in decision making, is their expected values and variances, especially for
the economic measures of merit of the alternatives. These derived quantities
for the random variables are used to make the uncertainty associated with
each alternative more explicit, including any probability of loss. Thus, when
503

504
CHAPTER 12 / PROBABILISTIC RISK ANALYSIS
uncertainty is considered, the variability in the economic measures of merit and
the probability of loss associated with the alternatives are normally used in the
decision-making process.
12.2 Sources of Uncertainty
It is useful to consider some of the factors that affect the uncertainty involved
in the analysis of the future economic consequences of an engineering project. It
would be almost impossible to list and discuss all of the potential factors. There
are four major sources of uncertainty, however, that are nearly always present in
engineering economy studies.
The ﬁrst source that is always present is the possible inaccuracy of the cash-ﬂow
estimates used in the study. The accuracy of the cash-inﬂow estimates is difﬁcult
to determine. If they are based on past experience or have been determined by
adequate market surveys, a fair degree of reliance may be placed on them. On the
other hand, if they are based on limited information with a considerable element
of hope thrown in, they probably contain a sizable element of uncertainty.
The second major source affecting uncertainty is the type of business involved
in relation to the future health of the economy. Some types of business operations are
less stable than others. For example, most mining enterprises are more risky than
one engaged in manufactured homes. Whenever capital is to be invested in an
engineering project, the nature of the business as well as expectations of future
economic conditions (e.g., interest rates) should be considered in deciding what
risk is present.
A third source affecting uncertainty is the type of physical plant and equipment
involved. Some types of structures and equipment have rather deﬁnite lives and
market values. A good engine lathe generally can be used for many purposes in
nearly any fabrication shop. Quite different would be a special type of lathe that
was built to do only one unusual job. Its value would be dependent almost entirely
upon the demand for the special task that it can perform. Thus, the type of physical
property involved affects the accuracy of the estimated cash-ﬂow patterns.
The fourth important source of uncertainty that must always be considered
is the length of the study period used in the analysis. A long study period naturally
decreases the probability of all the factors turning out as estimated. Therefore, a
long study period, all else being equal, generally increases the uncertainty of a
capital investment.
12.3 The Distribution of Random Variables
Capital letters such as X, Y, and Z are usually used to represent random variables
and lowercase letters (x, y, z) to denote the particular values that these variables
take on in the sample space (i.e., in the set of all possible outcomes for each variable).
When a random variable’s sample space is discrete, its probability mass function is
usually indicated by p(x) and its cumulative distribution function by P(x). When a
random variable’s sample space is continuous, its probability density function and its
cumulative distribution function are usually indicated by f(x) and F(x), respectively.

SECTION 12.3 / THE DISTRIBUTION OF RANDOM VARIABLES
505
12.3.1
Discrete Random Variables
Arandom variable X is said to be discrete if it can take on at most a countable (ﬁnite)
number of values (x1, x2, . . . , xL). The probability that a discrete random variable X
takes on the value xi is given by
Pr{X = xi} = p(xi) for i = 1, 2, . . . , L (i is a sequential index of the
discrete values, xi, that the variable takes on),
where p(xi) ≥0 and !
i
p(xi) = 1.
The probability of events about a discrete random variable can be computed
from its probability mass function p(x). For example, the probability of the event
that the value of X is contained in the closed interval [a, b] is given by (where the
colon is read such that)
Pr{a ≤X ≤b} =
"
i:a≤Xi≤b
p(xi).
(12-1)
The probability that the value of X is less than or equal to x = h, the cumulative
distribution function P(x) for a discrete case, is given by
Pr{X ≤h} = P(h) =
"
i:Xi≤h
p(xi).
(12-2)
In most practical applications, discrete random variables represent countable
data such as the useful life of an asset in years, number of maintenance jobs per
week, or number of employees as positive integers.
12.3.2
Continuous Random Variables
A random variable X is said to be continuous if there exists a nonnegative function
f(x) such that, for any set of real numbers [c, d], where c < d, the probability of the
event that the value of X is contained in the set is given by
Pr{c ≤X ≤d} =
d
#
c
f(x) dx
(12-3)
and
∞
#
−∞
f(x) dx = 1.
Thus, the probability of events about the continuous random variable X can be
computed from its probability density function, and the probability that X assumes
exactly any one of its values is zero. Also, the probability that the value of X is less
than or equal to a value x = k, the cumulative distribution function F(x) for a
continuous case, is given by
Pr{X ≤k} = F(k) =
k
#
−∞
f(x) dx.
(12-4)

506
CHAPTER 12 / PROBABILISTIC RISK ANALYSIS
Also, for a continuous case,
Pr{c ≤X ≤d} =
d
!
c
f(x) dx = F(d) −F(c).
(12-5)
In most practical applications, continuous random variables represent measured
data such as time, cost, and revenue on a continuous scale. Depending upon the
situation, the analyst decides to model random variables in engineering economic
analysis as either discrete or continuous.
12.3.3
Mathematical Expectation and Selected
Statistical Moments
The expected value of a single random variable X, E(X), is a weighted average of
the distributed values x that it takes on and is a measure of the central location
of the distribution (central tendency of the random variable). The E(X) is the ﬁrst
moment of the random variable about the origin and is called the mean (central
moment) of the distribution. The expected value is
E(X) =

⎪⎪⎪⎪⎬
⎪⎪⎪⎪⎭
(12-6)
Although E(X) provides a measure of central tendency, it does not measure
how the distributed values x cluster around the mean. The variance, V(X), which
is nonnegative, of a single random variable X is a measure of the dispersion of the
values it takes on around the mean. It is the expected value of the square of the
difference between the values x and the mean, which is the second moment of
the random variable about its mean:
E{[X −E(X)]2} = V(X) =

(12-7)
From the binomial expansion of [X −E(X)]2, it can be easily shown that V(X) =
E(X2) −[E(X)]2. That is, V(X) equals the second moment of the random variable
around the origin, which is the expected value of X2, minus the square of its mean.
This is the form often used for calculating the variance of a random variable X:

The standard deviation of a random variable, SD(X), is the positive square root of
the variance; that is, SD(X) = [V(X)]1/2.

for example, the estimated maintenance labor expense for a time period, Y = cX,
when the number of labor hours per period (X) is a random variable, and the

calculation for a project when the before-tax or after-tax net cash-ﬂow amounts, Fk,
are random variables, and then each Fk is multiplied by a constant (P/F, i%, k) to
obtain the PW value.

(12-10)
12.3.5
Multiplication of Two Independent Random Variables
A cash-ﬂow random variable, say Z, may result from the product of two other
random variables, Z = XY. Sometimes, X and Y can be treated as statistically
independent random variables. For example, consider the estimated annual
expenses, Z = XY, for a repair part repetitively procured during the year on a
competitive basis, when the unit price (X) and the number of units used per year
(Y) are modeled as independent random variables.
When a random variable, Z, is a product of two independent random variables,
X and Y, the expected value, E(Z), and the variance, V(Z), are
Z = XY
E(Z) = E(X) E(Y);
V(Z) = E[XY −E(XY)]2

X2Y2 −2X Y E(XY) + [E(XY)]2+
= E(X2) E(Y2) −[E(X) E(Y)]2.

508
CHAPTER 12 / PROBABILISTIC RISK ANALYSIS
But the variance of any random variable, V(RV), is
V(RV) = E[(RV)2] −[E(RV)]2,
E[(RV)2] = V(RV) + [E(RV)]2.
Then, V(Z) = {V(X) + [E(X)]2}{V(Y) + [E(Y)]2} −[E(X)]2[E(Y)]2
or
V(Z) = V(X)[E(Y)]2 + V(Y)[E(X)]2 + V(X) V(Y).

Evaluation of Projects with Discrete
Random Variables
Expected value and variance concepts apply theoretically to long-run conditions
in which it is assumed that the event is going to occur repeatedly. Application of
these concepts, however, is often useful even when investments are not going to
be made repeatedly over the long run. In this section, several examples are used
to illustrate these concepts with selected economic factors modeled as discrete
random variables.
EXAMPLE 12-1
Premixed-Concrete Plant Project
We now apply the expected value and variance concepts to a small premixed-
concrete plant project. Suppose that the estimated probabilities of attaining
various capacity utilizations are as follows:
Capacity (%)
Probability
Annual Revenue
AW(15%)

729,000
100,850
It is desired to determine the expected value and variance of annual revenue.
Subsequently, the expected value and variance of annual worth (AW) for the
project can be computed. By evaluating both E(AW) and V(AW) for the concrete
plant, indications of the venture’s average proﬁtability and its riskiness are
obtained. The calculations are shown in Tables 12-1 and 12-2.

may well judge the venture to be an acceptable one.
There are projects, such as the ﬂood-control situation in the next example,
in which future losses due to natural or human-made risks can be decreased by
increasing the amount of capital that is invested. Drainage channels or dams, built
to control ﬂoodwaters, may be constructed in different sizes, costing different
amounts. If they are correctly designed and used, the larger the size, the smaller
will be the resulting damage loss when a ﬂood occurs. As we might expect, the
most economical size would provide satisfactory protection against most ﬂoods,
although it could be anticipated that some overloading and damage might occur
at infrequent periods.

CHAPTER 12 / PROBABILISTIC RISK ANALYSIS
EXAMPLE 12-2
Channel Enlargement for Flash Flood Control
A drainage channel in a community where ﬂash ﬂoods are experienced has
a capacity sufﬁcient to carry 700 cubic feet per second. Engineering studies
produced the following data regarding the probability that a given water ﬂow
in any one year will be exceeded and the cost of enlarging the channel:

Records indicate that the average property damage amounts to $20,000
when serious overﬂow occurs. It is believed that this would be the average
damage whenever the storm ﬂow is greater than the capacity of the channel.
Reconstruction of the channel would be ﬁnanced by 40-year bonds bearing 8%
interest per year. It is thus computed that the capital recovery amount for debt
repayment (principal of the bond plus interest) would be 8.39% of the capital
investment, because (A/P, 8%, 40) = 0.0839. It is desired to determine the most
economical channel size (water-ﬂow capacity).
Solution
The total expected equivalent uniform annual cost for the structure and property
damage for all alternative channel sizes would be as shown in Table 12-3. These
calculations show that the minimum expected annual cost would be achieved
by enlarging the channel so that it would carry 1,300 cubic feet per second, with
the expectation that a greater ﬂood might occur in 1 year out of 20 on the average
and cause property damage of $20,000.

Note that when loss of life or limb might result, as in Example 12-2, there
usually is considerable pressure to disregard pure economy and build such projects
in recognition of the nonmonetary values associated with human safety.
The following example illustrates the same principles as in Example 12-2,
except that it applies to safety alternatives involving electrical circuits.
EXAMPLE 12-3
Investing in Circuit Protection to Reduce Probability of Failure
Three alternatives are being evaluated for the protection of electrical circuits,
with the following required investments and probabilities of failure:
Capital

Alternative

$90,000

B

C

If a loss does occur, it will cost $80,000 with a probability of 0.65 and $120,000
with a probability of 0.35. The probabilities of loss in any year are independent
of the probabilities associated with the resultant cost of a loss if one does occur.
Each alternative has a useful life of eight years and no estimated market value
at that time. The minimum attractive rate of return (MARR) is 12% per year, and
annual maintenance expenses are expected to be 10% of the capital investment.
It is desired to determine which alternative is best based on expected total
annual costs (Table 12-4).
Solution
The expected value of a loss, if it occurs, can be calculated as follows:
$80,000(0.65) + $120,000(0.35) = $94,000.
Thus, Alternative B is the best based on total expected equivalent uniform
annual cost, which is a long-run average cost. One might, however, rationally
choose Alternative C to reduce signiﬁcantly the chance of an $80,000 or $120,000
loss occurring in any year in return for a 24.3% increase in the total expected
equivalent uniform annual cost.

CHAPTER 12 / PROBABILISTIC RISK ANALYSIS
In Examples 12-1 through 12-3, a revenue or cost factor was modeled as a
discrete random variable, with project life assumed certain. A second type of
situation involves the cash-ﬂow estimates being certain, but the project life being
modeled as a discrete random variable. This is illustrated in Example 12-4.
EXAMPLE 12-4
Project Life as a Random Variable
The heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC) system in a commercial
building has become unreliable and inefﬁcient. Rental income is being hurt,
and the annual expenses of the system continue to increase. Your engineering
ﬁrm has been hired by the owners to (1) perform a technical analysis of
the system, (2) develop a preliminary design for rebuilding the system, and
(3) accomplish an engineering economic analysis to assist the owners in
making a decision. The estimated capital-investment cost and annual savings
in operating and maintenance expenses, based on the preliminary design,
are shown in the following table. The estimated annual increase in rental
revenue with a modern HVAC system has been developed by the owner’s
marketing staff and is also provided in the following table. These estimates
are considered reliable because of the extensive information available. The
useful life of the rebuilt system, however, is quite uncertain. The estimated
probabilities of various useful lives are provided. Assume that MARR = 12%
per year and the estimated market value of the rebuilt system at the end of
its useful life is zero. Based on this information, what are E(PW), V(PW), and
SD(PW) of the project’s cash ﬂows? Also, what is the probability of PW ≥0?

Solution by Hand
The PW of the project’s cash ﬂows, as a function of project life (N), is

The calculation of the value of E(PW) = $9,984 and the value of E[(PW)2] =

variance of the PW is
V(PW) = E[(PW)2] −[E(PW)]2
= 577.527 × 106 −($9,984)2
= 477.847 × 106($)2.
The SD(PW) is equal to the positive square root of the variance, V(PW):
SD(PW) = [V(PW)]1/2 = (477.847 × 106)1/2
= $21,859.
Based on the PW of the project as a function of N (column 2), and the probability
of each PW(N) value occurring (column 3), the probability of the PW being ≥0 is
Pr{PW ≥0} = 1 −(0.1 + 0.2) = 0.7.
The results of the engineering economic analysis indicate that the project is
a questionable business action. The E(PW) of the project is positive ($9,984) but
small relative to the large capital investment. Also, even though the probability
of the PW being greater than zero is somewhat favorable (0.7), the SD(PW) value
is large [over two times the E(PW) value].
Spreadsheet Solution
Spreadsheets are well suited for the number crunching involved in computing
expected values and variances associated with discrete probability functions.
Figure 12-1 illustrates the use of a spreadsheet to perform the necessary
calculations for this example. The basic format of Table 12-5 is used and
the results are same, subject to rounding differences. Once the spreadsheet,
however, is formulated, we can easily perform sensitivity analyses to support

our recommendation. For example, a 5% decrease in annual savings results in
a negative E(PW), supporting our conclusion that the proﬁtability of the project
is questionable.
12.4.1
Probability Trees
The discrete distribution of cash ﬂows sometimes occurs in each time period. A
probability tree diagram is useful in describing the prospective cash ﬂows, and the
probability of each value occurring, for this situation. Example 12-5 is a problem
of this type.
EXAMPLE 12-5
Project Analysis Using a Probability Tree
The uncertain cash ﬂows for a small improvement project are described by the
probability tree diagram in Figure 12-2. (Note that the probabilities emanating
from each node sum to unity.) The analysis period is two years, and MARR =
12% per year. Based on this information,

(a) The calculation of the values for E(PW) and E[(PW)2] is shown in Table 12-6.
In column 2, PWj is the PW of branch j in the tree diagram. The probability of
each branch occurring, p( j), is shown in column 3. For example, proceeding
from the right node for each cash ﬂow in Figure 12-2 to the left node, we
have p(1) = (0.3)(0.2) = 0.06 and p(9) = (0.5)(0.3) = 0.15. Hence,
E(PW) =

times the E(PW). This indicates a relatively high variability in the measure
of economic merit, PW of the project, and is usually an unfavorable indicator
of project acceptability.
12.4.2
An Application Perspective
One of the major problems in computing expected values is the determination of
the probabilities. In many situations, there is no precedent for the particular venture
being considered. Therefore, probabilities seldom can be based on historical data
and rigorous statistical procedures. In most cases, the analyst, or the person
making the decision, must make a judgment based on all available information
in estimating the probabilities. This fact makes some people hesitate to use the
expected-value concept, because they cannot see the value of applying such a
techniquetoimprovetheevaluationofriskanduncertaintywhensomuchapparent
subjectivity is present.

SECTION 12.5 / EVALUATION OF PROJECTS WITH CONTINUOUS RANDOM VARIABLES
517
Although this argument has merit, the fact is that engineering economy studies
deal with future events and there must be an extensive amount of estimating.
Furthermore, even if the probabilities could be based accurately on past history,
there rarely is any assurance that the future will repeat the past. Thus, structured
methods for assessing subjective probabilities are often used in practice.∗Also,
even if we must estimate the probabilities, the very process of doing so requires
us to make explicit the uncertainty that is inherent in all estimates going into the
analysis. Such structured thinking is likely to produce better results than little
or no thinking about such matters.
12.5
Evaluation of Projects with Continuous
Random Variables
In this section, we continue to compute the expected values and the variances of
probabilistic factors, but we model the selected probabilistic factors as continuous
random variables. In each example, simplifying assumptions are made about the
distribution of the random variable and the statistical relationship among the
values it takes on. When the situation is more complicated, such as a problem that
involves probabilistic cash ﬂows and probabilistic project lives, a second general
procedure that utilizes Monte Carlo simulation is normally used. This is the subject
of Section 12.6.
Two frequently used assumptions about uncertain cash-ﬂow amounts are that
they are distributed according to a normal distribution† and are statistically
independent. Underlying these assumptions is a general characteristic of many
cash ﬂows, in that they result from a number of different and independent
factors.
The advantage of using statistical independence as a simplifying assumption,
when appropriate, is that no correlation between the cash-ﬂow amounts (e.g., the
net annual cash-ﬂow amounts for an alternative) is being assumed. Consequently,
if we have a linear combination of two or more independent cash-ﬂow amounts,
say PW = c0F0+· · ·+cNFN, where the ck values are coefﬁcients and the Fk values are
periodic net cash ﬂows, the expression for the V(PW), based on Equation (12-10),
reduces to
V(PW) =

When we can assume that a random variable, say the PW of a project’s cash
ﬂow, is normally distributed with a mean, E(PW), and a variance, V(PW), we
can compute the probability of events about the random variable occurring. This
assumption can be made, for example, when we have some knowledge of the
shape of the distribution of the random variable and when it is appropriate to do
so. Also, this assumption may be supportable when a random variable, such as a
project’s PW value, is a linear combination of other independent random variables
(say, the cash-ﬂow amounts, Fk), regardless of whether the form of the probability
distribution(s) of these variables is known.∗
EXAMPLE 12-7
Probability of an Unfavorable Project Outcome
Refer to Example 12-6. For this problem, what is the probability that the
internal rate of return (IRR) of the cash-ﬂow estimates is less than MARR,
Pr{IRR < MARR}? Assume that the PW of the project is a normally distributed
random variable, with its mean and variance equal to the values calculated in
Example 12-6.
∗The theoretical basis of this assumption is the central limit theorem of statistics. For a summary discussion of the
supportability of this assumption under different conditions, see C. S. Park and G. P. Sharpe-Bette, Advanced Engineering
Economics (New York: John Wiley & Sons, 1990), 420–421.

CHAPTER 12 / PROBABILISTIC RISK ANALYSIS
Solution
For a decreasing PW(i) function having a unique IRR, the probability that IRR
is less than MARR is the same as the probability that PW is less than zero.
Consequently, by using the standard normal distribution in Appendix E, we can
determine the probability that PW is less than zero:∗
Z = PW −E(PW)
SD(PW)
= 0 −153

= −0.22;
Pr{PW ≤0} = Pr{Z ≤−0.22}.
From Appendix E, we ﬁnd that Pr{Z ≤−0.22} = 0.4129.
EXAMPLE 12-8
Linear Combination of Independent Random Variables
The estimated cash-ﬂow data for a project are shown in the following table for
the ﬁve-year study period being used. Each annual net cash-ﬂow amount, Fk, is
a linear combination of two statistically independent random variables, Xk and
Yk, where Xk is a revenue factor and Yk is an expense factor. The Xk cash-ﬂow
amounts are statistically independent of each other, and the same is true of the
Yk amounts. Both Xk and Yk are continuous random variables, but the form of
their probability distributions is not known. MARR = 20% per year. Based on
this information,
(a) What are the E(PW), V(PW), and SD(PW) values of the project’s cash ﬂows?
(b) What is the probability that PW is less than zero, that is, Pr{PW ≤0}, and
the project is economically attractive?

Solution
(a) The calculations of the E(Fk) and V(Fk) values of the project’s annual net cash
ﬂows are shown in Table 12-7. The E(PW) is calculated by using Equation
(12-14) as follows:
E(PW) =

= −$100,000 + $40,000(P/F, 20%, 1)
+ · · · + $74,000(P/F, 20%, 5)
= $32,517.
Then, the V(PW) is calculated using Equation (12-13) as follows:
V(PW) =
5
!
k=0
(P/F, 20%, k)2V(Fk)
= 100.0 × 106 + (24.25 × 106)(P/F, 20%, 1)2
+ · · · + (85.16 × 106)(P/F, 20%, 5)2
= 186.75 × 106($)2.
Finally, SD(PW) = [V(PW)]1/2
= [186.75 × 106]1/2
= $13,666.
(b) The PW of the project’s net cash ﬂow is a linear combination of the annual
net cash-ﬂow amounts, Fk, that are independent random variables. Each of
these random variables, in turn, is a linear combination of the independent
random variables Xk and Yk. We can also observe in Table 12-7 that the
V(PW) calculation does not include any dominant V(Fk) values. Therefore,
we have a reasonable basis on which to assume that the PW of the project’s

522
CHAPTER 12 / PROBABILISTIC RISK ANALYSIS
net cash ﬂow is approximately normally distributed, with E(PW) = $32,517
and SD(PW) = $13,666.
Based on this assumption, we have
Z = PW −E(PW)
SD(PW)
= 0 −$32,517
$13,666
= −2.3794;
Pr{PW ≤0} = Pr{Z ≤−2.3794}.
From Appendix E, we ﬁnd that Pr{Z ≤−2.3794} = 0.0087. Therefore,
the probability of loss on this project is negligible. Based on this result,
the E(PW) > 0, and the SD(PW) = 0.42[E(PW)]; therefore, the project is
economically attractive and has low risk of failing to add value to the ﬁrm.
12.6
Evaluation of Risk and Uncertainty
by Monte Carlo Simulation
The modern development of computers and related software has resulted in the
increased use of Monte Carlo simulation as an important tool for analysis of
project uncertainties. For complicated problems, Monte Carlo simulation generates
random outcomes for probabilistic factors so as to imitate the randomness inherent
in the original problem. In this manner, a solution to a rather complex problem can
be inferred from the behavior of these random outcomes.
To perform a simulation analysis, the ﬁrst step is to construct an analytical
model that represents the actual decision situation. This may be as simple as
developing an equation for the PW of a proposed industrial robot in an assembly
line or as complex as examining the economic effects of proposed environmental
regulations on typical petroleum reﬁnery operations. The second step is to
develop a probability distribution from subjective or historical data for each
uncertain factor in the model. Sample outcomes are randomly generated by
using the probability distribution for each uncertain quantity and are then used
to determine a trial outcome for the model. Repeating this sampling process
a large number of times leads to a frequency distribution of trial outcomes
for a desired measure of merit, such as PW or AW. The resulting frequency
distribution can then be used to make probabilistic statements about the original
problem.

SECTION 12.6 / EVALUATION OF RISK AND UNCERTAINTY BY MONTE CARLO SIMULATION 523
To illustrate the Monte Carlo simulation procedure,
suppose that the
probability distribution for the useful life of a piece of machinery has been
estimated as shown in Table 12-8. The useful life can be simulated by assigning
random numbers to each value such that they are proportional to the respective
probabilities. (A random number is selected in a manner such that each number
has an equal probability of occurrence.) Because two-digit probabilities are given
in Table 12-8, random numbers can be assigned to each outcome, as shown in
Table 12-9. Next, a single outcome is simulated by choosing a number at random
from a table of random numbers.∗For example, if any random number between
and including 00 and 19 is selected, the useful life is three years. As a further
example, the random number 74 corresponds to a life of seven years.
If the probability distribution that describes a random variable is normal, a
slightly different approach is followed. Here the simulated outcome is based on
the mean and standard deviation of the probability distribution and on a random
normal deviate, which is a random number of standard deviations above or below
the mean of a standard normal distribution. An abbreviated listing of typical
random normal deviates is shown in Table 12-10. For normally distributed random
variables, the simulated outcome is based on Equation (12-15):
Outcome value = mean + [random normal deviate
× standard deviation].
(12-15)
For example, suppose that an annual net cash ﬂow is assumed to be normally
distributed, with a mean of $50,000 and a standard deviation of $10,000, as shown
in Figure 12-4.

Simulated cash ﬂows for a period of ﬁve years are listed in Table 12-11. Notice
that the average annual net cash ﬂow is $248,850/5, which equals $49,770. This
approximates the known mean of $50,000 with an error of 0.46%.
If the probability distribution that describes a random event is uniform and
continuous, with a minimum value of A and a maximum value of B, another
procedure should be followed to determine the simulated outcome. Here the
outcome can be computed with the formula
Simulation outcome = A + RN
RNm
[B −A],
(12-16)
where RNm is the maximum possible random number (9 if one digit is used, 99 if
two are used, etc.) and RN is the random number actually selected. This equation
should be used when the minimum outcome, A, and the maximum outcome, B,
are known.
For example, suppose that the market value in year N is assumed to be uni-
formly and continuously distributed between $8,000 and $12,000. A value of this

SECTION 12.6 / EVALUATION OF RISK AND UNCERTAINTY BY MONTE CARLO SIMULATION 525
random variable would be generated as follows with a random number of 74:
Simulation outcome = $8,000 + 74
99($12,000 −$8,000) = $10,990.
Proper use of these procedures, coupled with an accurate model, will result
in an approximation of the actual outcome. But how many simulation trials are
necessary for an accurate approximation of, for example, the average outcome? In
general, the greater the number of trials, the more accurate the approximation of
the mean and standard deviation will be. One method of determining whether
a sufﬁcient number of trials has been conducted is to keep a running average of
results. At ﬁrst, this average will vary considerably from trial to trial. The amount of
change between successive averages should decrease as the number of simulation
trials increases. Eventually, this running (cumulative) average should level off at
an accurate approximation.
EXAMPLE 12-9
Project Analysis Using Monte Carlo Simulation
Monte Carlo simulation can also simplify the analysis of a more complex pro-
blem. The following estimates relate to an engineering project being considered
by a large manufacturer of air-conditioning equipment. Subjective probability
functions have been estimated for the four independent uncertain factors as
follows:
(a) Capital investment:
Normally distributed with a mean of $50,000 and a
standard deviation of $1,000.
(b) Useful life:
Uniformly and continuously distributed with a minimum life
of 10 years and a maximum life of 14 years.
(c) Annual revenue:
$35,000 with a probability of 0.4
$40,000 with a probability of 0.5
$45,000 with a probability of 0.1
(d) Annual expense:
Normally distributed, with a mean of $30,000 and a
standard deviation of $2,000.
The management of this company wishes to determine whether the capital
investment in the project will be a proﬁtable one. The interest rate is 10% per
year. To answer this question, the PW of the venture will be simulated.
Solution
To illustrate the Monte Carlo simulation procedure, ﬁve trial outcomes are
computed manually in Table 12-12. The estimate of the average PW based on this
very small sample is $19,010/5 = $3,802. For more accurate results, hundreds or
even thousands of repetitions would be required.

The applications of Monte Carlo simulation for investigating risk and uncer-
tainty are many and varied. Remember that the results, however, can be no more
accurate than the model and the probability estimates used. In all cases, the pro-
cedure and rules are the same: careful study of the problem and development of
the model; accurate assessment of the probabilities involved; true randomization
of outcomes as required by the Monte Carlo simulation procedure; and calculation
and analysis of the results. Furthermore, a sufﬁciently large number of Monte Carlo
trials should always be used to reduce the estimation error to an acceptable level.
12.7
Performing Monte Carlo Simulation
with a Computer
It is apparent from the preceding section that a Monte Carlo simulation of a complex
project requiring several thousand trials can be accomplished only with the help of
a computer. Indeed, there are numerous simulation programs that can be obtained
from software companies and universities. MS Excel also has a simulation feature
that can generate random data for seven different probability distributions. In this
section, we will demonstrate that Monte Carlo simulation is not only feasible but
also relatively easy to perform with spreadsheets.

SECTION 12.7 / PERFORMING MONTE CARLO SIMULATION WITH A COMPUTER 527
At the heart of Monte Carlo simulation is the generation of random numbers.
Most spreadsheet packages include a RAND( ) function that returns a random
number between zero and one. Other advanced statistical functions, such as
NORMSINV( ), will return the inverse of a cumulative distribution function (the
standard normal distribution in this case). This function can be used to generate
random normal deviates. The spreadsheet model shown in Figure 12-5 makes use
of these functions in performing a Monte Carlo simulation for the project being
evaluated in Example 12-9.
The probabilistic functions for the four independent uncertain factors are
identiﬁed in the spreadsheet model. The input parameter names and distributions
Figure 12-5
Monte Carlo Simulation Using a Spreadsheet, Example 12-9

528
CHAPTER 12 / PROBABILISTIC RISK ANALYSIS
are identiﬁed in cells A2:B7. The mean and standard deviation of the normally
distributed factors (capital investment and annual expenses) are identiﬁed in the
range C2:D4. The maximum and minimum values for the uniformly distributed
project life are shown in E5:F5. A discrete probability function was compiled for
annual revenues. The associated cumulative probability distribution is shown
in G6:I7.
The formulas in cells B12:E12 return values for the uncertain factors, based on
the underlying distribution and parameters. These values are used in cell F12 to
calculate the PW. As these formulas are copied down the spreadsheet, each row
becomes a new trial in the simulation. Each time the F9 (recalculate) key is pressed,
the RAND( ) functions are reevaluated and a new simulation begins. The formulas
in the range B1013:F1017 calculate basic statistics for the input parameters and the
PW. By comparing these results with the input values, one can rapidly check for
errors in the basic formulas.
A true simulation involves hundreds, or perhaps thousands, of trials. In this
example, 1,000 trials were used. The ﬁrst and last ﬁve trials are shown in Figure
12-5 (rows 17 through 1006 have been hidden for display purposes). The average
PW is $8,345 (cell F1015), which is larger than the $3,802 obtained from Table 12-12.
This underscores the importance of having a sufﬁcient number of simulation trials
to ensure reasonable accuracy in Monte Carlo analyses. The cumulative average
PW calculated in column G is one simple way to determine whether enough trials
have been run. Aplot of these values will stabilize and show little change when the
simulation has reached a steady state. Figure 12-6 shows the plot of the cumulative
average PW for the 1,000 trials generated for this example.
The average PW is of interest, but the distribution of PW is often even more
signiﬁcant. A histogram of the PW values in column F displays the shape of the
distribution, as shown in Figure 12-7. The dispersion of PW trial outcomes in this
Figure 12-6

Simulation Trials Have Been Run

SECTION 12.7 / PERFORMING MONTE CARLO SIMULATION WITH A COMPUTER 529
Figure 12-7
Histogram Showing Distribution of PW for 1,000 Simulation Trials
example is considerable. The standard deviation of simulated trial outcomes is one
way to measure this dispersion. In addition, the proportion of values less than zero
indicates the probability of a negative PW. Based on Figure 12-7, approximately 40%
of all simulation outcomes have a PW less than zero. Consequently, this project may
be too risky for the company to undertake, because the downside risk of failing to
realize at least a 10% per year return on the capital investment is about 4 chances
out of 10. Perhaps another project investment should be considered.
A typical application of simulation involves the analysis of several mutually
exclusive alternatives. In such studies, how can one compare alternatives that
have different expected values and standard deviations of, for instance, PW? One
approach is to select the alternative that minimizes the probability of attaining a PW
that is less than zero. Another popular response to this question utilizes a graph of
expected value (a measure of the reward) plotted against standard deviation (an
indicator of risk) for each alternative. An attempt is then made to assess subjectively
the trade-offs that result from choosing one alternative over another in pairwise
comparisons.
To illustrate the latter concept, suppose that three alternatives having varying
degrees of uncertainty have been analyzed with Monte Carlo computer simulation
and the results shown in Table 12-13 have been obtained. These results are plotted
in Figure 12-8, where it is apparent that Alternative C is inferior to Alternatives A
and B because of its lower E(PW) and larger standard deviation. Therefore, C offers
a smaller PW that has a greater amount of risk associated with it! Unfortunately,
the choice of B versus A is not as clear because the increased expected PW of B has
to be balanced against the increased risk of B. This trade-off may or may not favor B,
depending on management’s attitude toward accepting the additional uncertainty

associated with a larger expected reward. The comparison also presumes thatAlter-
native A is acceptable to the decision maker. One simple procedure for choosing
between A and B is to rank alternatives based on the ratio of E(PW) to SD(PW). In
this case, Alternative A would be chosen because it has the more favorable (larger)
ratio.
12.8
Decision Trees
Decision trees, also called decision ﬂow networks and decision diagrams, are
powerful means of depicting and facilitating the analysis of important problems,
especially those that involve sequential decisions and variable outcomes over
time. Decision trees are used in practice because they make it possible to break
down a large, complicated problem into a series of smaller simple problems,
and they enable objective analysis and decision making that includes explicit
consideration of the risk and effect of the future.
This section has been adapted (except Section 12.8.3) from John R. Canada and William G. Sullivan, Economic and
Multiattribute Evaluation of Advanced Manufacturing Systems (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall, 1989), 341–343,

SECTION 12.8 / DECISION TREES 531
The name decision tree is appropriate, because it shows branches for each
possible alternative for a given decision and for each possible outcome (event) that
can result from each alternative. Such networks reduce abstract thinking to a logical
visual pattern of cause and effect. When costs and beneﬁts are associated with each
branch and probabilities are estimated for each possible outcome, analysis of the
decision ﬂow network can clarify choices and risks.
12.8.1
Deterministic Example
The most basic form of a decision tree occurs when each alternative can be assumed
to result in a single outcome—that is, when certainty is assumed. The replacement
problem in Figure 12-9 illustrates this. The problem illustrates that the decision on
whether to replace the defender (old machine) with the new machine (challenger)
is not just a one-time decision but rather one that recurs periodically. That is, if
the decision is made to keep the old machine at decision point one, then later, at
decision point two, a choice again has to be made. Similarly, if the old machine is
chosen at decision point two, then a choice again has to be made at decision point
three. For each alternative, the cash inﬂow and duration of the project are shown
above the arrow, and the capital investment is shown below the arrow.
For this problem, the question initially seems to be which alternative to choose
at decision point 1. But an intelligent choice at decision point 1 should take
into account the later alternatives and decisions that stem from it. Hence, the
correct procedure is to start at the most distant decision point, determine the best
alternative and quantitative result of that alternative, and then roll back to each
preceding decision point, repeating the procedure until ﬁnally the choice at the
initial or present decision point is determined. By this procedure, one can make
a present decision that directly takes into account the alternatives and expected
decisions of the future.
For simplicity in this example, timing of the monetary outcomes will ﬁrst be
neglected, which means that a dollar has the same value regardless of the year in
which it occurs. Table 12-14 shows the necessary computations and decisions using

a nine-year study period. Note that the monetary outcome of the best alternative
at decision point 3 ($7.0M for the old) becomes part of the outcome for the old
alternative at decision point 2. Similarly, the best alternative at decision point 2
($22.0M for the new) becomes part of the outcome for the defender alternative at
decision point 1.
The computations in Table 12-14 show that the answer is to keep the old
alternative now and plan to replace it with the new one at the end of three years (at
decision point 2). But this does not mean that the old machine should necessarily
be kept for a full three years and a new machine bought without question at the end
of that period. Conditions may change at any time, necessitating a fresh analysis—
probably a decision tree analysis—based on estimates that are reasonable in light
of conditions at that time.
12.8.1.1
Deterministic Example Considering Timing For decision tree
analyses, which involve working from the most distant to the nearest decision
point, the easiest way to take into account the timing of money is to use the PW
approach and thus discount all monetary outcomes to the decision points in question. To
demonstrate, Table 12-15 shows computations for the same replacement problem
of Figure 12-9, using an interest rate of 25% per year.
Note from Table 12-15 that, when taking into account the effect of timing by
calculating PWs at each decision point, the indicated choice is not only to keep the
old alternative at decision point 1 but also to keep the old alternative at decision
points 2 and 3 as well. This result is not surprising since the high interest rate tends
to favor the alternatives with lower capital investments, and it also tends to place
less weight on long-term returns (beneﬁts).
12.8.2
General Principles of Diagramming
The proper diagramming of a decision problem is, in itself, generally very useful to
the understanding of the problem, and it is essential to correct subsequent analysis.
The placement of decision points (nodes) and chance outcome nodes from the
initial decision point to the base of any later decision point should give an accurate
representation of the information that will and will not be available when the choice

tree diagram should show the following (normally, a square symbol is used to
depict a decision node, and a circle symbol is used to depict a chance outcome
node):
1. all initial or immediate alternatives among which the decision maker wishes to
choose
2. all uncertain outcomes and future alternatives that the decision maker wishes to
consider because they may directly affect the consequences of initial alternatives
3. all uncertain outcomes that the decision maker wishes to consider because
they may provide information that can affect his or her future choices among
alternatives and hence indirectly affect the consequences of initial alternatives
Note that the alternatives at any decision point and the outcomes at any chance
outcome node must be
1. mutually exclusive (i.e., no more than one can be chosen)
2. collectively exhaustive (i.e., one event must be chosen or something must occur
if the decision point or outcome node is reached)
12.8.3
Decision Trees with Random Outcomes
The deterministic replacement problem discussed in Section 12.8.1 introduced the
concept of sequential decisions using assumed certainty for alternative outcomes.
An engineering problem requiring sequential decisions, however, often includes
random outcomes, and decision trees are very useful in structuring this type of
situation. The decision tree diagram helps to make the problem explicit and assists
in its analysis. This is illustrated in Example 12-10.

replacement for the most frequently used unit. The new design involves major
changesthathavetheexpectedadvantageofbetteroperatingefﬁciency. Fromthe
perspective of a typical user, the new compressor (as an assembled component
in an air-conditioning system) would have an increased investment of $8,600
relative to the present unit and an annual expense saving dependent upon the
extent to which the design goal is met in actual operations.
Estimates by the multidisciplinary design team of the new compressor
achieving four levels (percentages) of the efﬁciency design goal and the
probability and annual expense saving at each level are as follows:

PW(18%)70 = −$8,600 + $2,920(P/A, 18%, 6) = $1,614

PW(18%)30 = −$8,600 + $1,560(P/A, 18%, 6) = −$3,143
Based on these values, the E(PW) of each installed unit of the new compressor
is as follows:
E(PW) = 0.25($3,538) + 0.40($1,614)
+0.25(−$520) + 0.10(−$3,143)
= $1,086.
The E(PW) of the current unit is zero since the cash-ﬂow estimates for the new
design are incremental amounts relative to the present design. Therefore, the
analysis indicates that the new design is economically preferable to the present
design. (The parallel lines across the current unit path on the diagram indicate
that it was not selected.)

Real Options Analysis
Companies make capital investments to exploit opportunities for shareholder
(owner) wealth creation. Often these opportunities are real options, which are
opportunities available to a ﬁrm when it invests in real assets such as plant,
equipment, and land. Real options allow decision makers to invest capital now or
to postpone all or part of the investment until later. Decision trees are a convenient
means for portraying the resolution of risk/uncertainty in the analysis of real
options.∗
The real options approach to capital investments is based on an interesting
analogy about ﬁnancial options. A company with an opportunity to invest capital
actually owns something much like a ﬁnancial call option—the company has the
right but not the obligation to invest in (purchase) an asset at a future time of
its choosing. When a ﬁrm makes an irreversible capital investment that could be
postponed, it exercises its call option, which has value by virtue of the ﬂexibility it
gives the ﬁrm.
∗The reader interested in details regarding real options analysis is referred to these two articles: Luehrman, T. A.,
“Investment Opportunities as Real Options: Getting Started with the Numbers,” Harvard Business Review, 76, no. 4
(July–August 1998a): 51–67; Luehrman, T. A., “Strategy as a Portfolio of Real Options,” Harvard Business Review, 76,
no. 5 (September–October 1998b): 89–99.

536
CHAPTER 12 / PROBABILISTIC RISK ANALYSIS
An example of a postponable investment is coal-ﬁred generating capacity of an
electric utility. Anticipated capacity needed for the next 10 years can be added in
one large expansion project, or the capacity addition can be acquired in staggered
stages, which permits the utility to better respond to future demand patterns and
possibly different types of generating capacity, such as natural gas or nuclear
power. If the utility company decides to go ahead with a single, large, irreversible
expansion project, it eliminates the option of waiting for new information that
might represent a more valuable phased approach to meeting customers’ demands
for electricity. The lost option’s value is an opportunity cost that must be included
in the overall evaluation of the investment. This is the essence of the real options
approach to capital investment—to fairly value the option of waiting to invest in all
or a part of the project and to include this value in the overall project proﬁtability.
Clearly, viewing capital investments as real options forces a greater emphasis to be
placed on the value of information in risky situations facing a ﬁrm.
In the previous section, we have shown how decision trees are useful in
determining the value of information of anticipated future outcomes. In this
regard, decision trees enable the analyst to model real options that are hidden in
classical present worth analysis. These options, not treated formally in classic single
outcome analyses, are often understood by management and factored informally
into their assessment of the analysis (and the assessment of the analyst!). This
presence of hidden options is most easily understood with an example.
EXAMPLE 12-11
Hytech Industries
Hytech is considering opening an entirely new electronic interface using radio
frequency identiﬁcation with a new coding system that deviates from some
standards but offers advantages to bulk chemical manufacturers. The cost to
develop the manufacturing capacity and build the market is estimated at $700
million, and the resulting net cash inﬂows after income taxes are estimated at
$100 million per year (albeit with much potential variation depending upon
acceptance of the product). The after-tax MARR is 15% per year, and the new
product will have a life of 20 years.
Solution as Classical Single Outcome Analysis
The PW of this project is
PW(15%) = −$700 million + $100 million(P/A, 15%, 20) = −$74.1 million,
and the recommendation would be to avoid the investment.
Suppose, however, that the $100 million cash inﬂow per year is merely an
average. If the device catches on, potential sales will exceed the annual capacity
for the new facilities, and annual inﬂows will be limited to $200 million. In fact,
if this happens, a second plant can be acquired one year later for an additional
investment of $500 million, and it would be able to generate an additional $150
million cash inﬂow annually. On the other hand, if the new product fails to
catch on, sales could effectively be zero, but the plant could be salvaged for
$150 million.

SECTION 12.9 / REAL OPTIONS ANALYSIS 537
Solution as a Decision Tree with Embedded Options
The decision tree appears as shown in Figure 12-11. If the end-of-path convention
is used, then the tip values are as shown in Table 12-16. Note that path 3,
abandoned when ﬁrst year inﬂows exceed $200 million, is not reasonable and is
not evaluated. Similarly, path 4 and 7 would involve expansion when the market
has not developed and are not evaluated.
As shown in the table, when ﬁrst year net inﬂows are high ($200 million +),
the better of paths 1 and 2 is to expand and realize a PW of $926 million. If
response is tepid ($100 million inﬂow), then path 5 is better than path 6. The PW
of path 5 is negative, but staying in business recoups some of the investment and
is better than abandoning the project. Finally, if the market is negligible, path
9 is better than path 8, because the ability to salvage some of the investment
mitigates the loss.

If each outcome of the ﬁrst year cash ﬂows were equally likely and management
is risk neutral, then the expected monetary value is $94.3 (= [+$926 −$74.1 −
$569]/3) million, an improvement of $168.4 million over the $74.1 million loss
projected in the single outcome analysis. This improvement can be viewed as the
value of the combined options to expand, if the market develops, or to salvage
some investment if the project is a ﬂop.

Summary
Engineering economy involves decision making among competing uses of scarce
capital resources. The consequences of resultant decisions usually extend far into
the future. In this chapter, we have presented various statistical and probability
concepts that address the fact that the consequences (cash ﬂows, project lives, etc.)
of engineering alternatives can never be known with certainty, including Monte
Carlo computer simulation techniques, and decision tree analysis. Cash inﬂow and
cashoutﬂowfactors, aswellasprojectlife, weremodeledasdiscreteandcontinuous
random variables. The resulting impact of uncertainty on the economic measures
of merit for an alternative was analyzed. Included in the discussion were several
considerations and limitations relative to the use of these methods in application.
Regrettably, there is no quick and easy answer to the question, How should
risk best be considered in an engineering economic evaluation? Generally, simple
procedures (e.g., breakeven analysis and sensitivity analysis, discussed in Chapter
11) allow some discrimination among alternatives to be made on the basis of the
uncertainties present, and they are relatively inexpensive to apply. Additional
discrimination among alternatives is possible with more complex procedures that
utilize probabilistic concepts. These procedures, however, are more difﬁcult to
apply and require additional time and expense.

property tax revenues. In any given year, there is one
chance in 100 that a major mudslide will occur.
A civil engineer has proposed constructing a culvert
on a mountain where mudslides are likely. This culvert
will reduce the likelihood of a mudslide to near zero.
The investment cost would be $50,000, and annual
maintenance expenses would be $2,000 in the ﬁrst year,
increasing by 5% per year thereafter. If the life of the
culvert is expected to be 20 years and the cost of capital
to Sabino County is 7% per year, should the culvert be
built? (12.4)
12-2. A bridge is to be constructed now as part of a
new road. An analysis has shown that trafﬁc density
on the new road will justify a two-lane bridge at the
present time. Because of uncertainty regarding future
use of the road, the time at which an extra two lanes will
be required is currently being studied. The estimated
probabilities of having to widen the bridge to four lanes
at various times in the future are as follows:

The present estimated cost of the two-lane bridge
is $2,000,000. If constructed now, the four-lane bridge
will cost $3,500,000. The future cost of widening a two-
lane bridge will be an extra $2,000,000 plus $250,000 for
every year that widening is delayed. If money can earn
12% per year, what would you recommend? (12.4)

well. Operating expenses will be 10% of the
revenue from the sale of natural gas from this particular
well. If found, natural gas from a highly productive
well will amount to 260,000 cubic feet per day. The
probability of locating such a productive well, however,
is about 10%. (12.4)

what is the E(PW) of proﬁt to the owner/operator of

of 10 miles on the outskirts of a large metropolitan
area. Hurricanes have hit this area twice in the past 20
years, so there is concern over the structural integrity
of this particular levee. City engineers have proposed
reinforcing and increasing the height of the levee
by various designs to withstand the storm surge of
numerous strength categories of hurricanes.
Study results regarding the probability that high
ﬂood water from a hurricane in any one year will
exceed the increased height of the levee, and the cost
of construction of the levee for each storm category, are

If the life of each generator is 10 years and MARR =

a new ski lift that will cost $900,000. Expenses for oper-
ating and maintaining the lift are estimated to be $1,500
per day when operating. The U.S. Weather Service esti-
mates that there is a 60% probability of 80 days of skiing
weather per year, a 30% probability of 100 days per year,
and a 10% probability of 120 days per year. The oper-
ators of the resort estimate that during the ﬁrst 80 days
of adequate snow in a season, an average of 500 people
will use the lift each day, at a fee of $10 each. If 20 addi-
tional days are available, the lift will be used by only
400 people per day during the extra period; and if
20 more days of skiing are available, only 300 people
per day will use the lift during those days. The owners
wish to recover any invested capital within ﬁve years
and want at least a 25% per year rate of return before
taxes. Based on a before-tax analysis, should the lift be
installed? (12.4)
12-9. Refer to Problem 12-8. Assume the following
changes: the study period is eight years; the ski lift
will be depreciated by using the MACRS Alternative
Depreciation System (ADS); the ADS recovery period
is seven years; MARR = 15% per year (after-tax);
and the effective income tax rate (t) is 40%. Based on
this information, what is the E(PW) and SD(PW) of
the ATCF? Interpret the analysis results and make a

problem of having a limited amount of funds available
for capital projects. He has narrowed his choice down
to two pieces of x-ray equipment, since the radiology
department is his greatest producer of revenue. The
ﬁrst piece of equipment (Project A) is a fairly standard
piece of equipment that has gained wide acceptance
and should provide a steady ﬂow of income. The other
piece of equipment (Project B), although more risky,
may provide a higher return. After deliberation with
his radiologist and director of ﬁnance, the administrator
has developed the following table:

magine a future in which landﬁlls are obsolete and trash is used
as fuel. Although this vision is not new, a southern-based U.S.
company has plans to make this a reality. Instead of placing
consumer waste in a landﬁll, trash would be vaporized into steam and a synthetic
gas that can be used as a substitute for natural gas. The steam could be sold
to neighboring facilities as a power source, and enough synthetic gas could be
produced to power 43,000 homes annually.
The company plans to let no by-product go unused. Organic materials would
be melted and hardened into materials that could be used for roadway and
construction projects. It is projected that the sale of the transformed trash would
allow the company to recoup the initial $425 million investment within 20 years.
This project deals with not only the environmental concern of waste disposal
but also the need for alternative energy sources. Chapter 13 discusses capital
budgeting issues associated with the selection and implementation of this type of
environmentally–friendly project.

13.1 Introduction
The decision by a company to implement an engineering project involves the
expenditure of current capital funds to obtain future economic beneﬁts or to meet
safety, regulatory, or other operating requirements. This implementation decision
is normally made, in a well-managed company, as part of a capital budgeting
process. The capital ﬁnancing and allocation functions are primary components of
this process.
13.1.1
The Capital Financing and Allocation Functions
The capital ﬁnancing and allocation functions are closely linked, as illustrated
in Figure 13-1, and they are simultaneously managed as part of the capital
budgeting process. The amounts of new funds needed from investors and lenders,
as well as funds available from internal sources to support new capital projects, are
determined in the capital ﬁnancing function. Also, the sources of any new externally
acquired funds—issuing additional stock, selling bonds, obtaining loans, and so
on—are determined. These amounts, in total, as well as the ratio of debt to equity

capital, must be commensurate with the ﬁnancial status of the ﬁrm and balanced
with the current and future capital investment requirements.
The selection of the engineering projects for implementation occurs in the
capital allocation function. The total capital investment in new projects is con-
strained by the amount decided upon for this purpose during the capital ﬁnancing
considerations. The capital allocation activities begin in the various organizations
in the company—departments (say, engineering), operating divisions, research and
development, and so on. During each capital budgeting cycle, these organizations
plan, evaluate, and recommend projects for funding and implementation. Eco-
nomic and other justiﬁcation information is required with each project recom-
mendation. Engineering economy studies are accomplished as part of this process
to develop much of the information required.
As shown in Figure 13-1, the available capital is allocated among the projects
selected on a company-wide basis in the capital allocation function. Management,
through its integrated activities in both functions, is responsible for ensuring that a
reasonable return (in dollars) is earned on these investments, so providers of debt
and equity capital will be motivated to furnish more capital when the need arises.
Thus, it should be apparent why the informed practice of engineering economy is
an essential element in the foundation of an organization’s competitive culture.
Insum, thecapitalﬁnancingandallocationfunctionsarecloselylinkeddecision
processes regarding how much and where ﬁnancial resources will be obtained and
expended on future engineering and other capital projects to achieve economic
growth and to improve the competitiveness of a ﬁrm.
13.1.2
Sources of Capital Funds
Outside sources of capital include, for example, equity partners, stockholders,
bondholders, banks, and venture capitalists, all of whom expect a return on their
investment. If a company seeks to obtain new outside capital for investment in
the business, it must attract new investors. It does so by paying a rate of return
that is attractive in a competitive market in which many differing securities are
offered. The variety of securities available and their special provisions are limited
only by human creativity. A complete exploration is beyond the scope of this text,
but an understanding of the cost of capital is a key concept. Hence, the theory of
capital cost is developed for the most important equities and debts or liabilities
that form the capitalization, or total capital base, for a company. Here, we focus
on those ﬁnancing concepts that guide the capital planning phase, as compared
to the speciﬁc details needed in the execution phase (i.e., the actual acquisition
of funds). Many reﬁnements to the models we develop are appropriate when
considering an action such as selling equity shares (stocks) or issuing new bonds.
These kinds of actions and more complex models lie in the realm of ﬁnance and
are not explicitly detailed here. The fundamental models presented in this chapter
convey the understanding needed by engineers and nonﬁnancial managers. Those
readers interested in the speciﬁcs of the capital acquisition process and more
complex models should look to the references provided in Appendix F for details
and procedures involved in the capital acquisition process.
Some perspective on the costs of various sources of capital can be gained by
examining the returns provided to investors for various kinds of securities. To

provide some stable benchmarks, it is helpful to review historical values of rates
of returns on various securities. A widely circulated reference is the yearbook,
published by Ibbotson Associates,∗which tracks the long-term performance of ﬁve
different portfolios of securities.
Information from 1926 to 2002 is compiled in Table 13-1. Returns ﬂuctuate
signiﬁcantly over time, but the long-term perspective used by Ibbotson provides
some valuable insights. For example, it is obvious that the rates earned by investors
increase as we move down the columns in Table 13-1 toward increasingly risky
securities. The standard deviation of annual returns is our proxy measure of risk.
Since the averages are the annual returns that investors expect, they are indicative
of the rates that a company must offer in order to attract investors. During this same
period, the average annual rate of inﬂation has been 3.1%. Investors, of course, are
very aware of inﬂation, and the rates in the table are therefore nominal annual
returns, already adjusted for the inﬂation expected by the marketplace.
13.2
Debt Capital
One source of capital is borrowed money. The money may be loaned by banks as a
line of credit, or it may be obtained from the sale of bonds or debentures. The return
to the buyer or bondholder is the interest on the bond and the eventual return of the
principal. In order to market the bonds successfully, the return must be attractive
to buyers. The attractiveness will depend upon the interest rate offered and the
perceived riskiness of the offering. In the United States, two major investment
companies, (1) Moody’s and (2) Standard and Poor’s Investment Services, publish
ratings of various bond issues based upon their analyses of each company’s
ﬁnancial health. The higher the rating, the lower the interest rate required to attract
investors. The four highest rating categories are associated with investment grade
bonds; the lowest, with junk bonds. The junk bonds have a signiﬁcant risk of default
and therefore offer higher interest rates to attract investors. Many investors pool
that risk by developing investment portfolios that include such risky bonds. At the
other end of the spectrum, treasury bills are backed by the U.S. government and
are regarded as the safest investment, because they have never defaulted. As might

CHAPTER 13 / THE CAPITAL BUDGETING PROCESS
be guessed, the interest rate paid by the government for T-bills is very low. The
current treasury bill rate is often used as a proxy for the risk-free rate of return, RF.
Regardless of the rate that companies pay for the money they borrow, the
interest that they pay is tax deductible. This tax deductibility results in a tax savings
that generally should be considered in engineering economic analysis of capital
investments. There are basically two ways to accomplish this.
One way would be ﬁrst to compute the interest during each year and deduct
it from the project cash ﬂows before computing income taxes and next to consider
interest and principal reductions to the cash outﬂows in lieu of the lump-sum
investment amount. This adds a computational chore, as the interest amount
changes from period to period with level debt service or uniform annual amounts.
More importantly, it is generally not easy to assign debt repayment to a speciﬁc
project, as debt is determined at the corporate, not the project, level.
The second, and most commonly used, approach is to modify the cost of debt
to account for its tax deductibility in the interest rate (MARR) used. To make it
clear that the interest tax shield is being picked up in the MARR, rather than in the
cash ﬂows, we can modify the descriptors for the elements of after-tax cash ﬂow.
Speciﬁcally, in year k let
ATCFk = after-tax cash ﬂow (excluding interest on debt);
NOPATk = the net operating proﬁt after taxes;
EBITk = the earnings before interest and taxes (R −E); and
t = the effective income tax rate (as a decimal).
Then in year k, we have
ATCFk = NOPATk + dk = (1 −t)EBITk + t dk.
(13-1)
When calculating the weighted average cost of capital (WACC), as in
Section 13.4, the cost of debt capital (ib) is offset by the tax deduction it provides,
and the after-tax cost of a company’s debt is (1 −t) ib, where ib is the before-tax cost
of debt as an annual rate.
13.3
Equity Capital
Equity sources of funding include not only stockholder’s capital but also earnings
retained by the company for reinvestment in the business and the cash ﬂow
resulting from depreciation charges against income. Just as with bonds, the
percentage cost of equity funds, ea, can be determined by market forces whenever
new equity is issued. This, however, is often an infrequent event. Furthermore, the
cost of internal equity funds should be based upon opportunity costs associated
with the best use of those funds within the ﬁrm. Here we must resort to some
means of inferring that cost, on the basis of historical performance as a proxy for
anticipatedfuturecosts. Forexample, onewaymightbetoconsiderthetrendinpast
values of return on equity (ROE). If these have been satisfactory, that might be an
indication of the value of ea. Another approach is to look at the return demanded
by the shareholders; however, this ﬂuctuates widely and creates an estimating
challenge. Table 13-1 shows representative long-term values for ea, but these are

SECTION 13.3 / EQUITY CAPITAL 551
not especially useful as indicators at a given point in time. We need a way to obtain
a fairly current value (yet to remove the impact of daily and other ﬂuctuations).
When this equity is issued as common stock, a theoretical construct, the capital
asset pricing model (CAPM), offers a fruitful approach.
13.3.1
The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)
The CAPM appeared in the 1960s as a classic piece of economic research, developed
independently by three eminent economists. Their work is based upon the classical
portfolio theory developed by Harry Markowitz.∗It forms the basis for much of
contemporary thought about risk and return. The economic logic underpinning
this work is elegant. Dedicated readers can consult the seminal works cited in the
footnote or a good ﬁnance text. Our immediate needs are well served with an
intuitive explanation of their results, as shown in Figure 13-2.
Markowitz showed that the best combinations of risk and return on investment
can be achieved by investing in a portfolio that includes a mixture of stocks. Further,
the most efﬁcient portfolios lie on a curve that speciﬁes the maximum return for
a given level of risk. This concave-shaped curve is called the Markowitz efﬁcient
market portfolio and is shown in Figure 13-2. Return is measured as expected
return, and risk is measured as the standard deviation of returns. An investor
could then diversify his or her stock investments to achieve the maximum return,
commensurate with the level of risk he or she is willing to tolerate. Or, conversely,
the investor could minimize the risk associated with a required return by choosing
a portfolio on the Markowitz curve in Figure 13-2.
Using some rather idealistic assumptions and sound economic reasoning, the
CAPM asserts that the best combinations of return and risk must lie along a straight

Conditions of Risk.” Journal of Finance, 19, (September 1964): 425–442 and J. Lintner, “The Valuation of Risk Assets and

line called the security market line, SML. This line is established by the risk-free rate
RF and the point of tangency with the Markowitz efﬁcient market portfolio. That
is, rather than choosing an equity portfolio based upon risk and return preference,
investors can always achieve the best combination of risk and return by investing
in the efﬁcient market portfolio and then borrowing or lending at the risk-free rate
to achieve their personal preference for combined risk and return values. Because
of this ability, any security must lie on the SML. As shown in Figure 13-3, the SML
can be used to develop a standardized estimate of the risk, and hence the return,
associated with any security.
Using this model, risk is calibrated to the risk associated with a market portfolio
(i.e., a portfolio consisting of all the stocks in the market). The return on the market
portfolio, RM, is keyed to a level of risk that we will call βM and assign a value of
1.0. This is one point on the SML, which identiﬁes the market return, RM, and the
level of market risk, βM. The risk-free rate, RF, and a beta value of zero indicate
that the risk-free rate does not ﬂuctuate with the market.
The CAPM asserts that the return RS on any stock depends upon its risk relative
to the market. That risk, βS, is the stock’s contribution to the riskiness of the market
portfolio. CAPM suggests that the risk premium of any stock is proportional to its
beta. That is,
RS −RF = βS(RM −RF).
(13-2)
Equation (13-2) states that the quantity (RS −RF) is the current risk premium
associated with a stock S relative to a risk-free investment. The quantity (RM−RF) is
the market premium for the average stock market risk. Over many years, the market
premium has steadily hovered at 8.4% above the risk-free rate, as suggested in
Table 13-1 and conﬁrmed in studies showing an annual range between 8% and
10%. In this chapter, the long-term average market premium of 8.4% is used.
βs is the beta value of stock S. It is a widely published and periodically updated
statistic for any stock. It is measured by regressing changes in the price of the stock

SECTION 13.4 / THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL (WACC)

against changes in the market index. The slope of that regression line is labeled as
beta and is a widely used measure of a stock’s riskiness. Many investment advisory
services compute and publish estimates of beta.
13.3.2
Estimating the Cost of Equity
The bottom line of all this is that we can estimate the cost of equity, ea, as the return
on equity, Rs, required in the market by solving Equation (13-2).
EXAMPLE 13-1
Microsoft’s Cost of Equity
Microsoft has a beta value of 1.68. They have no long-term debt. What is their
cost of equity, based upon the CAPM?
Solution
Using CAPM, a long-term market premium (RM −RF) of 8.4%, and an estimated
risk-free rate (RF) of 2% in 2002, we see that
ea = RS = RF + βS(RM −RF) = 0.02 + 1.68(0.084) = 0.161 = 16.1%.
In 2002, Microsoft reported a ROE of 15.7%. This is consistent with the preceding
estimate.
13.4
The Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)
TheWACCistheproductofthefractionoftotalcapitalfromeachsourceandthecost
of capital from that source, summed over all sources. To illustrate the concept, we
will simply look at debt and equity sources and their respective costs. This usually
provides an adequate ﬁgure for planning. For our purposes, Equation (13-3) is used
to compute a ﬁrm’s WACC.
Let
λ = the fraction of the total capital obtained from debt;
(1 −λ) = the fraction of the total capital obtained from equity;
t = effective income tax rate as a decimal;
ib = the cost of debt ﬁnancing, as measured from appropriate bond rates;
ea = the cost of equity ﬁnancing, as measured from historical performance
of the CAPM.
Then
WACC = λ(1 −t)ib + (1 −λ)ea.
(13-3)
Equation (13-3) says that the average cost of funds is a weighted average of the costs
of each of its capital sources. Further, if we assess or value investment projects by
discounting their returns at the WACC, then any project with a PW > 0 provides
value in excess of the cost of the capital required to accomplish it.

CHAPTER 13 / THE CAPITAL BUDGETING PROCESS
EXAMPLE 13-2
Weighted Average Cost of Capital
RefertoProblem13-15attheendofthischapter. Determinetheweightedaverage
cost of capital (WACC) for the ﬁrm.
Solution
The weighted after-tax cost of long-term debt is (0.49)(1 −0.4924)(9.34%) =
2.323%. The (1 −t) term is necessary because 9.34% is the before-tax cost of
long-term debt, and we desire an after-tax number. To determine the equity
portion of the WACC for this ﬁrm, we must recognize that the cost of preferred
stock and the cost of common equity are already after-tax values because they
are determined after income taxes are paid. Their weighted after-tax values are
(0.13)(8.22%) = 1.069% and (0.38)(16.5%) = 6.270%, respectively. We calculate
the WACC by adding these weighted components.
WACC = 2.323% + 1.069% + 6.270% = 9.662%
EXAMPLE 13-3
More WACC Calculations
What is the WACC for Microsoft? What is the WACC for Duke Energy?
Solution for Microsoft
Since Microsoft has no debt, it is 100% equity ﬁnanced. Therefore,
WACC = ea = RS = 16.1%, as calculated in Example 13-1.
Solution for Duke Energy
Since the Enron debacle, energy companies have been viewed cautiously by
investors. Research sources show that Duke Energy’s stock prices have been
more stable than most, with a beta of 0.32, but their post-Enron bond rating of
BBB has become much lower than the pre-Enron value. Their effective income
tax rate is 0.35. As of 2003, Duke’s balance sheet shows $20 billion in debt and
roughly $15 billion in equity. But there are 900 million shares outstanding, and
the price per share is approximately $20, resulting in a market value of the equity
of $18 billion. Long-term bonds rated BBB currently earn 6% per year.
λ = $20 billion ÷ ($20 billion + $18 billion) = 0.526
ib = 0.06
ea = RS = RF + βS(RM −RF) = 0.02 + 0.32(0.084) = 0.047
t = 0.35
WACC = 0.526(1 −0.35)(0.06) + 0.474(0.047) = 0.043
Notice that the market value of the equity ($18 billion) rather than the book value
($15 billion) is used to compute λ. This reﬂects the relevance of current market
information vis-a-vis the historical book value of equity. Market values of debt
do not ﬂuctuate as dramatically as equity values.

SECTION 13.4 / THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL (WACC)

13.4.1
The Separation Principle
A related point is that, for every ﬁrm, there is an optimal mix of debt and equity
ﬁnancing that minimizes the WACC to that ﬁrm. The task of the company treasurer
is to identify that mix and maintain it as a permanent part of the capital structure of
thecompany. Onedifﬁcultyisthatitisnoteasytodetermineormaintaintheoptimal
mix. Because any new bond or stock issue incurs underwriting and marketing costs,
there is a ﬁxed charge of “going to the well.” New capital is procured in chunks,
rather than in small amounts, that would permit close adherence to the optimal
ratio. It does not make business sense for the hurdle rate (MARR) for investments
to be low when the cost of capital is low because this year’s projects are to be funded
with debt. A more consistent long-term view is obtained by evaluating investment
projects at the WACC or the MARR, regardless of how they are being ﬁnanced.
This concept is referred to as the separation principle. This, in effect, separates the
investment decision from the ﬁnancing decision and requires projects to have a
PW ≥0 at the WACC or MARR, or an IRR ≥WACC or MARR, thus creating value
for the investors.
13.4.2
WACC and Risk
The economic theory behind the CAPM was hardly needed to persuade experi-
enced managers that some capital projects are riskier than others and that prudence
is required for achieving a higher return (or very conservative estimates of the cash
ﬂows)forriskierprojects. Inreality, everyprojectshouldbeevaluatedonthebasisof
the risk it adds to the company as well as its return. If the risks are roughly normal,
and if there are no signiﬁcant capital limitations, then WACC is an appropriate
hurdle rate (i.e., the MARR). If the project is riskier than the current business, then
an upward adjustment in the MARR might be appropriate. As intuitively appealing
as this may be, the problem becomes one of operationalizing the rate adjustment.
An alternative is to use more formal techniques of risk assessment such as
those discussed in Chapters 11 and 12. In those chapters, we recommended that
risk be attributed to mutually exclusive projects by quantifying the variability of
the estimated cash ﬂows and discounting at a single MARR value. In this chapter,
however, we are frequently dealing with independent projects in capital budgeting
studies, and risk is dealt with by discounting projects at multiple interest rates
(MARRs) to account for different degrees of anticipated riskiness. This practice
is widespread in industry and is used where appropriate in this chapter in the
comparison of independent projects.
13.4.3
Relation of WACC to the MARR
Thus far, we have been comparing investment alternatives with the MARR used
as the hurdle rate. The WACC merely establishes a ﬂoor on the MARR. In many
circumstances, a higher MARR than the WACC may be chosen, because of a
shortage of investment funds as well as differences in risk.
The theory developed thus far has implicitly assumed that the ﬁrm can obtain
as much capital as it needs at the WACC and thus should go forward with any
normal risk project that has a PW ≥0 when evaluated at the WACC. In the real
world, however, opportunities often occur in lumps rather than in a continuous

556
CHAPTER 13 / THE CAPITAL BUDGETING PROCESS
stream. Management may wish to conserve capital in anticipation of a large future
opportunity, or it may wish to encourage investment in a new division while
discouraging investments in mature product lines. For that reason, the MARR
may be deliberately raised above the WACC in some years or for some divisions.
There may be instances in which unusually risk-free cash ﬂows could be evaluated
at a MARR lower than the WACC.
13.4.4
Opportunity Costs and Risk Categories
in Determining MARRs
A commonly overlooked viewpoint on the determination of the MARR is the
opportunity cost viewpoint; it comes as a direct result of the capital rationing
necessary when there is a limitation of funds relative to prospective proposals
to use the funds. This limitation may be either internally or externally imposed. Its
parameter is often expressed as a ﬁxed sum of capital; but when the prospective
returns from investment proposals, together with the ﬁxed sum of capital available
to invest, are known, then the parameter can be expressed as a minimum acceptable
rate of return or cut-off rate.
Ideally, the cost of capital by the opportunity cost principle can be determined
by ranking prospective projects of similar risk according to a ladder of proﬁtability
and then establishing a cut-off point such that the capital is used on the better
projects. The return earned by the last project after the cut-off point is the minimum
attractive rate of return (MARR) by the opportunity cost principle.
To illustrate the preceding, Figure 13-4 ranks projects according to prospective
internal rate of return (IRR) and the cumulative investment required. For purposes
of illustration, the amount of capital shown available is $4 million. By connecting
down (to the next whole project outside the $4 million) and across, one can read
the minimum rate of return under the given conditions, which turns out to be 22%.

SECTION 13.5 / PROJECT SELECTION
557
This is the return on the rejected project that causes the cumulative investment
amount to be more than $4 million.
It is not uncommon for ﬁrms to set two or more MARR levels, according to
risk categories. For example, one major industrial ﬁrm deﬁnes risk categories
for income-producing projects and normal MARR standards for each of these
categories as follows:
1. High Risk (MARR = 25%)
New products
New business
Acquisitions
Joint ventures
2. Moderate Risk (MARR = 18%)
Capacity increase to meet forecasted sales
3. Low Risk (MARR = 10%)
Cost improvements
Make versus buy
Capacity increase to meet existing orders
To illustrate how the preceding set of MARR standards could be determined,
the ﬁrm could rank prospective projects in each risk category according to
prospective rates of return and investment amounts. After tentatively deciding
how much investment capital should be allocated to each risk category, the ﬁrm
could then determine the MARR for each risk category, as illustrated in Figure 13-4
for a single category. Of course, the ﬁrm might reasonably shift its initial allocation
of funds according to the opportunities available in each risk category, thereby
affecting the MARR for each category.
In principle, it would be desirable for a ﬁrm to invest additional capital as
long as the return from that capital were greater than the cost of obtaining that
capital. In such a case, the opportunity cost would equal the marginal cost (in
interest and/or stockholder returns) of the best rejected investment. In practice,
however, the amount of capital actually invested is more limited because of risk
and conservative money policies; thus, the opportunity cost is higher than the
marginal cost of the capital.
13.5
Project Selection
To the extent that project proposals can be justiﬁed through proﬁtability measures,
the most common basis of selection is to choose those proposals that offer
the highest prospective proﬁtability, subject to allowances for intangibles or
nonmonetary considerations, risk considerations, and limitations on the avail-
ability of capital. If the minimum acceptable rate of return has been determined
correctly, one can choose proposals according to the IRR, annual worth (AW)
method, future worth (FW) method, or present worth (PW) method.
For certain types of project proposals, monetary justiﬁcation is not feasible—
or at least any monetary return is of minor importance compared with intangible

558
CHAPTER 13 / THE CAPITAL BUDGETING PROCESS
or nonmonetary considerations. These types of projects should require careful
judgment and analysis, including how they ﬁt in with long-range strategy and
plans.
The capital budgeting concepts discussed in this chapter are based on the
presumption that the projects under consideration are not mutually exclusive. (That
is, the adoption of one does not preclude the adoption of others, except with
regard to the availability of funds.) Whenever projects are mutually exclusive,
the alternative chosen should be based on justiﬁcation through the incremental
return on any incremental investment(s), as well as on proper consideration of
nonmonetary factors.
13.5.1
Classifying Investment Proposals
For purposes of study of investment proposals, there should be some system or
systems of classiﬁcation into logical, meaningful categories. Investment proposals
have so many facets of objective, form, and competitive design that no one
classiﬁcation plan is adequate for all purposes. Several possible classiﬁcation plans
are the following:
1. According to the kinds and amounts of scarce resources used, such as equity
capital, borrowed capital, available plant space, the time required of key
personnel, and so on
2. According to whether the investment is tactical or strategic: a tactical investment
does not constitute a major departure from what the ﬁrm has been doing in
the past and generally involves a relatively small amount of funds; strategic
investment decisions, on the other hand, may result in a major departure from
what a ﬁrm has done in the past and may involve large sums of money
3. According to the business activity involved, such as marketing, production,
product line, warehousing, and so on
4. According to priority, such as absolutely essential, necessary, economically
desirable, or general improvement
5. According to the type of beneﬁts expected to be received, such as increased
proﬁtability, reduced risk, community relations, employee beneﬁts, and so on
6. According to whether the investment involves facility replacement, facility
expansion, or product improvement
7. According to the way beneﬁts from the proposed project are affected by
other proposed projects; this is generally a most important classiﬁcation
consideration, for there quite often exist interrelationships or dependencies
among pairs or groups of investment projects
Of course, all of the preceding classiﬁcation systems probably are not needed
or desirable. As an example, one major corporation uses the following four major
categories for higher management screening:
1. Expanded facilities
2. Research and development

SECTION 13.5 / PROJECT SELECTION
559
3. Improved facilities—for process improvement,
cost savings,
or quality
improvement
4. Necessity—for service facilities, emergency replacements, or for the removal or
avoidance of a hazard or nuisance
13.5.2
Degrees of Dependency Among Projects
Several main categories of dependency among projects are brieﬂy deﬁned in
Table 13-2. Actually, the possible degrees of dependency among projects can
be expressed as a continuum from prerequisite to mutually exclusive, with the
degrees complement, independent, and substitute between these extremes, as shown
in Figure 13-5.
In developing a project proposal to be submitted for review and approval, the
sponsor should include whatever complementary projects seem desirable as part
of a single package. Also, if a proposed project will be a partial substitute for any

CHAPTER 13 / THE CAPITAL BUDGETING PROCESS
projects to which the ﬁrm is already committed or that are under consideration,
this fact should be noted in the proposal.
For cases in which choices involved in planning a proposed project are con-
sidered sufﬁciently important that the ﬁnal decision should be made by higher
levels of management, the project proposal should be submitted in the form of a
set of mutually exclusive alternatives. For example, if it is to be decided whether
to move a plant to a new location and several alternative sites are possible, then
separate proposals should be made for each site so as to facilitate the choice of
which site, if any, should be chosen.
Whenever capital budgeting decisions involve several groups of mutually ex-
clusive projects and independent projects to be considered within capital avail-
ability constraints, the mathematical programming models presented later in this
chapter can be useful for selecting the optimal combination of projects.
13.5.3
Organization for Capital Planning and Budgeting
In most large organizations, project selections are accomplished by sequential
review through various levels of the organization. The levels required for approval
should depend on the nature and importance of the individual project, as well as
on the particular organizational makeup of the ﬁrm. In general, a mix of central
control and coordination, together with authority to make project commitments
delegated to operating divisions, is considered desirable. Three typical basic plans
for delegating investment decisions are as follows:
1. Whenever proposals are clearly good in terms of economic desirability accord-
ing to operating division analysis, the division is given the power to commit, as
long as appropriate controls can be maintained over the total amount invested
by each division and as long as the division analyses are considered reliable.
2. Whenever projects represent the execution of policies already established by
headquarters, such as routine replacements, the division is given the power to
commit within the limits of appropriate controls.
3. Whenever a project requires a total commitment of more than a certain amount,
this request is sent to higher levels within the organization. This is often coupled
withabudgetlimitationregardingthemaximumtotalinvestmentthatadivision
may undertake in a budget period.
To illustrate the concept of larger investments requiring higher administrative
approval, the limitations for a small-sized ﬁrm might be as follows:

SECTION 13.6 / POSTMORTEM REVIEW 561
13.5.4
Communication
The importance of effective communication of capital investment proposals is often
overlooked. No matter how great are the merits of a proposed project, if those
merits are not communicated to the decision maker(s) in understandable terms,
with emphasis on the proper matters, that proposal may well be rejected in favor
of less desirable, though better communicated, proposals. Klausner∗provides
good insight into this problem, with emphasis on the differing perspectives
of engineers responsible for technical design and proposal preparation and
the management decision makers responsible for monitoring the ﬁrm’s capital
resources. The proposal preparer should be as aware as possible of the decision
maker’s perspective and related informational needs. For example, in addition to
basic information such as investment requirements, measures of merit, and other
expected beneﬁts, the decision maker may well want clearly presented answers to
such questions as the following:
1. What bases and assumptions were used for estimates?
2. What level of conﬁdence does the proposer have regarding these estimates?
3. How would the investment outcome be affected by variations in these estimated
values?
If project proposals are to be transmitted from one organizational unit to
another for review and approval, there must be effective means for communi-
cation. The means can vary from standard forms to personal appearances. In
communicating proposals to higher levels, it is desirable to use a format that is as
standardized as possible to help assure uniformity and completeness of evaluation
efforts. In general, the technical and marketing aspects of each proposal should be
completely described in a format that is most appropriate to each individual case.
The ﬁnancial implications of all proposals, however, should be summarized in a
standardized manner so that they may be uniformly evaluated.
13.6
Postmortem Review
The provision of a system for periodic postmortem reviews (postaudits) of the per-
formance of consequential projects previously authorized is an important aspect of
a capital budgeting system. That is, the earnings or costs actually realized on each
such project undertaken should be compared with the corresponding quantities
estimated at the time the project investment was committed.
This kind of feedback review serves at least three main purposes, as follows:
1. It determines if planned objectives have been obtained.
2. It determines if corrective action is required.
3. It improves estimating and future planning.
∗R. F. Klausner, “Communicating Investment Proposals to Corporate Decision Makers,” The Engineering Economist,
17, no. 1 (Fall 1971): 45–55.

562
CHAPTER 13 / THE CAPITAL BUDGETING PROCESS
Postmortem reviews should tend to reduce biases in favor of what individual
divisions or units preparing project proposals see as their own interests. When
divisions of a ﬁrm have to compete with each other for available capital funds,
there is a tendency for them to evaluate their proposals optimistically. Estimating
responsibilities can be expected to be taken more seriously when the estimators
know that the results of their estimates will be checked. This checking function,
however, should not be overexercised, for there is a human tendency to become
overly conservative in estimating when one fears severe accountability for
unfavorable results.
It should be noted that a postmortem audit is inherently incomplete. That is,
if only one of several alternative projects is selected, it can never be known exactly
what would have happened if one of the other alternatives had been chosen. What
might have been if . . . is at best conjecture, and all postmortem audits should be made
with this reservation in proper perspective.
13.7
Budgeting of Capital Investments
and Management Perspective
The approved capital budget is limited typically to a one- or two-year period or
less, but this should be supplemented by a long-range capital plan, with provision
for continual review and change as new developments occur. The long-range plan
(or plans) can be for a duration of 2 to 20 years, depending on the nature of the
business and the desire of the management to force preplanning.
Even when the technological and market factors in the business are so change-
able that plans are no more than guesses to be continually revised, it is valuable
to plan and budget as far ahead as possible. Planning should encourage the
search for investment opportunities, provide a basis for adjusting other aspects
of management of the ﬁrm as needed, and sharpen management’s forecasting
abilities. Long-range budget plans also provide a better basis for establishing
minimum rate of return ﬁgures that properly take into account future investment
opportunities.
An aspect of capital budgeting that is difﬁcult and often important is deciding
how much to invest now as opposed to later. If returns are expected to increase
for future projects, it may be proﬁtable to withhold funds from investment for
some time. The loss of immediate return, of course, must be balanced against the
anticipation of higher future returns.
In a similar vein, it may be advantageous to supplement funds available for
present projects whenever returns for future projects are expected to become less
than those for present projects. Funds for present investment can be supplemented
by the reduction of liquid assets, the sale of other assets, and the use of borrowed
funds.

the opportunities for growth and development and to time their investments to
achieve optimum advantage is a primary ingredient of success for an organization.
13.8
Leasing Decisions
Leasing of assets is a business arrangement that makes assets available without
incurring initial capital investment costs of purchase. By the term lease, we normally
are referring to the ﬁnancial type of lease; that is, a lease in which the ﬁrm has a
legal obligation to continue making payments for a well-deﬁned period of time for
which it has use, but not ownership, of the asset(s) leased. Financial leases usually
have ﬁxed durations of at least one year. Many ﬁnancial leases are very similar to
debt and should be treated in essentially the same manner as debt. A signiﬁcant
proportion of assets in some ﬁrms is acquired by leasing, thus making the ﬁrm’s
capital available for other uses. Buildings, railroad cars, airplanes, production
equipment, and business machines are examples of the wide array of facilities
that may be leased.∗
Lease speciﬁcations are generally detailed in a formal written contract. The
contract may contain such speciﬁcations as the amount and timing of rental
payments; cancellability and sublease provisions, if any; subsequent purchase
provisions; and lease renewability provisions.
Althoughtheﬁnancial lease provides an important alternative sourceofcapital,
it carries with it certain subtle, but important, disadvantages. Its impact is similar
to that of added debt capital. The acquisition of ﬁnancial leases or debt capital
will reduce the ﬁrm’s ability to attract further debt capital and will increase the
variability (leverage) in prospective earnings on equity (owner) capital. Higher
leverage results in more ﬁxed charges for debt interest and repayment and thus
will make good conditions even better and poor conditions even worse for the
equity owners.
Figure 13-6 depicts the types of analyses that should be made for lease-
related decisions and also shows what conclusion (ﬁnal choice) should be made
for various combinations of conditions (analysis outcomes). The buy versus status
quo (do nothing) decision is to determine long-run economy or feasibility and is
sometimes referred to as an equipment decision. In general practice, only if this
is investigated and buy is found to be preferable should one be concerned with
the buy versus lease question, which is considered a ﬁnancing decision. We cannot,
however, always separate the equipment and ﬁnancing decisions. For example, if
the equipment decision results in status quo being preferable and yet it is possible
that the equipment might be favorable if leased, then we should compare status
quo with lease. This, by deﬁnition, is a mixed decision involving both equipment and
ﬁnancing considerations.
The main point one should retain from the preceding is that one should not
merely compare buy versus lease alternatives; one should also compare, if possible,
∗So-called leases with an option to buy are treated as conditional sales contracts and are not considered to be true
ﬁnancial leases.

against the status quo alternative to determine whether the asset is justiﬁed under
any ﬁnancing plan.
A major factor in evaluating the economics of leasing versus buying is the tax
deductions (reductions in taxable income) allowable. In the case of leasing, one
is allowed to deduct the full cost of normal ﬁnancial lease payments. In the case
of buying (ownership), only depreciation charges and interest payments, if any,
are deductible. Of course, other disbursements for operating the property are tax
deductible under either ﬁnancing plan.
EXAMPLE 13-4
After-Tax Analysis: Buy, Lease, or Status Quo
Suppose a ﬁrm is considering purchasing equipment for $200,000 that would last
for ﬁve years and have zero market value. Alternatively, the same equipment
could be leased for $52,000 at the beginning of each of those ﬁve years. The
effective income tax rate for the ﬁrm is 55% and straight-line depreciation
is used. The net before-tax cash beneﬁts from the equipment are $56,000 at
the end of each year for ﬁve years. If the after-tax MARR for the ﬁrm is 10%,
use the PW method to show whether the ﬁrm should buy, lease, or maintain the
status quo.

Thus, the PWs (after taxes) for the three alternatives are as follows:

Lease:
−$23,400 −$23,400(P/A, 10%, 4) = −$97,600.
Status quo:
−$25,200(P/A, 10%, 5)
= −$95,500.
IfthesequenceofanalysisfollowsthatinFigure13-6, wewouldﬁrstcompare
buy (PW = −$116,600) against status quo (PW = −$95,500) and ﬁnd the status
quo to be better. Then we would compare lease (PW = −$97,600) against status
quo (PW = −$95,500) and ﬁnd the status quo to be better. Thus, status quo is the
better ﬁnal choice. It should be noted that, had we merely compared buy versus
lease, lease would have been the choice. But the ﬁnal decision should not have
been made without comparison against status quo.
Another way the problem could have been solved would have been to include
the +$56,000 before-tax cash beneﬁts with both the buy and the lease alternatives.
Then the two alternatives being considered would have been buy rather than status
quo (PW = −$116,600 + $95,500 = −$21,100) and lease rather than status quo
(PW = −$97,600 + $95,500 = −$2,100). Of these alternatives, lease rather than
status quo is the better, but lease is still not justiﬁed because of the negative PW,
indicating that the costs of lease are greater than the beneﬁts.

Capital Allocation
This section examines the capital expenditure decision-making process, also
referred to as capital allocation. This process involves the planning, evaluation, and
management of capital projects. In fact, much of this book has dealt with concepts
and techniques required to make correct capital-expenditure decisions involving
engineering projects. Now our task is to place them in the broader context of upper
management’s responsibility for proper planning, measurement, and control of the
ﬁrm’s overall portfolio of capital investments.

CHAPTER 13 / THE CAPITAL BUDGETING PROCESS
13.9.1
Allocating Capital Among Independent Projects
Companies are constantly presented with independent opportunities in which they
can invest capital across the organization. These opportunities usually represent a
collection of the best projects for improving operations in all areas of the company
(e.g., manufacturing, research and development). In most cases, the amount of
available capital is limited, and additional capital can be obtained only at increasing
incremental cost. Thus, companies have a problem of budgeting, or allocating,
available capital to numerous possible uses.
One popular approach to capital allocation among independent projects uses
the net PW criterion. If project risks are about equal, the procedure is to compute
the PW for each investment opportunity and then to enumerate all feasible
combinations of projects. Such combinations will then be mutually exclusive. Each
combination of projects is mutually exclusive, because each is unique and the
acceptance of one combination of investment projects precludes the acceptance
of any of the other combinations. The PW of the combination is the sum of the PWs
of the projects included in the combination. Now our capital allocation strategy is
to select the mutually exclusive combination of projects that maximizes PW, subject
to various constraints on the availability of capital. The next example provides a
general overview of this procedure.
EXAMPLE 13-5
Mutually Exclusive Combinations of Projects
Consider these four independent projects and determine the best allocation of
capital among them if no more than $300,000 is available to invest:
Independent Project
Initial Capital Outlay
PW
A
$100,000
$25,000
B
125,000
30,000
C
150,000
35,000
D
75,000
40,000
Solution
Figure 13-7 displays a spreadsheet solution for this example. All possible
combinations of the independent projects taken two, three, and four at a time are
shown, along with their total initial capital outlay and total PW.After eliminating
those combinations that violate the $300,000 funds constraint (labeled as not
feasible in column D), the proper selection of projects would be ABD, and the
maximum PW is $95,000. The process of enumerating combinations of projects
having nearly identical risks is best accomplished with a computer when large
numbers of projects are being evaluated.

Linear Programming Formulations of Capital
Allocation Problems
For large numbers of independent or interrelated investments, the “brute force”
enumeration and evaluation of all combinations of projects, as illustrated in
Example 13-5, is impractical. This section describes a mathematical procedure
for efﬁciently determining the optimal portfolio of projects in industrial capital
allocation problems (Figure 13-1). Only the formulations of these problems will
be presented in this section; their solution is beyond the scope of this book.
Suppose that the goal of a ﬁrm is to maximize its net PW by adopting a capital
budget that includes a large number of mutually exclusive combinations of projects.
When the number of possible combinations becomes fairly large, manual methods
for determining the optimal investment plan tend to become complicated and time
consuming, and it is worthwhile to consider linear programming as a solution
procedure. Linear programming is a mathematical procedure for maximizing (or
minimizing) a linear objective function, subject to one or more linear constraint
equations. Hopefully, the reader will obtain some feeling for how more involved
problems might also be modeled.

568
CHAPTER 13 / THE CAPITAL BUDGETING PROCESS
Linear programming is a useful technique for solving certain types of multi-
periodcapitalallocationproblems whenaﬁrmisnotabletoimplementallprojectsthat
may increase its PW. For example, constraints often exist on how much investment
capital can be committed during each ﬁscal year, and interdependencies among
projects may affect the extent to which projects can be successfully carried out
during the planning period.
The objective function of the capital allocation problem can be written as
Maximize net PW =
m
!
j=1
B∗
j Xj,
where
B∗
j = net PW of investment opportunity (project) j during the planning
period being considered;
Xj = fraction of project j that is implemented during the planning period
(Note: In most problems of interest, Xj will be either zero or one;
the Xj values are the decision variables);
m = number of mutually exclusive combinations of projects under
consideration.
In computing the net PW of each mutually exclusive combination of projects, a
MARR must be speciﬁed.
The following notation is used in writing the constraints for a linear
programming model:
ckj = cash outlay (e.g., initial capital investment or annual operating budget)
required for project j in time period k;
Ck = maximum cash outlay that is permissible in time period k.
Typically, two types of constraints are present in capital budgeting problems:
1. Limitations on cash outlays for period k of the planning horizon,
m
!
j=1
ckjXj ≤Ck.
2. Interrelationships among the projects. The following are examples:
(a) If projects p, q, and r are mutually exclusive, then
Xp + Xq + Xr ≤1.
(b) If project r can be undertaken only if project s has already been selected,
then
Xr ≤Xs
or
Xr −Xs ≤0.
(c) If projects u and v are mutually exclusive and project r is dependent
(contingent) on the acceptance of u or v, then
Xu + Xv ≤1
and
Xr ≤Xu + Xv.

SECTION 13.9 / CAPITAL ALLOCATION 569
To illustrate the formulation of linear programming models for capital
allocation problems, Example 13-6 and Example 13-7 are presented.
EXAMPLE 13-6
Linear Programming Formulation of the Capital Allocation Problem
Five engineering projects are being considered for the upcoming capital budget
period. The interrelationships among the projects and the estimated net cash
ﬂows of the projects are summarized in the following table:

which combination (portfolio) of projects is best if the availability of capital is
limited to $48,000.

(No fractional projects are allowed.)

Aproblem such as this could be solved readily by using the simplex method
of linear programming if the last constraint (Xj = 0 or 1) were not present. With

Another Linear Programming Formulation
Consider a three-period capital allocation problem having the net cash-ﬂow
estimates and PW values shown in Table 13-3. MARR is 12% per year, and
the ceiling on investment funds available is $1,200,000. In addition, there is
a constraint on operating funds for support of the combination of projects
selected—$400,000 in year one. From these constraints on funds outlays and the

interrelationships among projects indicated in Table 13-3, we shall formulate
this situation in terms of a linear integer programming problem.
Solution
First, the net PW of each investment opportunity at 12% per year is calculated
(Table 13-3). The objective function then becomes
Maximize PW = 135.3XA1 + 146.0XA2 + 119.3XA3 + 164.1XB1
+ 151.9XB2 + 8.1XC1 −13.1XC2 + 2.3XC3.
The budget constraints are the following:
Investment funds constraint:
225XA1 + 290XA2 + 370XA3 + 600XB1 + 1,200XB2

Interrelationships among the investment opportunities give rise to these con-
straints on the problem:

!
B1, B2 are independent
XC1 + XC2 + XC3 ≤XA1 + XA2
accounts for dependence of
C1, C2, C3 (which are mutually
exclusive) on A1 or A2
Finally, if all decision variables are required to be either zero (not in the optimal
solution) or one (included in the optimal solution), the last constraint on the
problem would be written
Xj = 0, 1
for j = A1, A2, A3, B1, B2, C1, C2, C3.
As can be seen in Example 13-6, a fairly simple problem such as this would
require a large amount of time to solve by listing and evaluating all mutually
exclusive combinations. Consequently, it is recommended that a suitable com-
puter program be used to obtain solutions for all but the most simple capital
allocation problems.

Summary
This chapter has provided an overview of the capital ﬁnancing and capital
allocation functions, as well as the total capital-budgeting process. Our discussion
of capital ﬁnancing has dealt with where companies get money to continue to grow

572
CHAPTER 13 / THE CAPITAL BUDGETING PROCESS
and prosper and the costs to obtain this capital. Also included was a discussion of
the weighted average cost of capital. In this regard, differences between debt capital
and owner’s (equity) capital were made clear. Leasing, as a source of capital, was
also described, and a lease-versus-purchase example was analyzed.
Our treatment of capital allocation among independent investment oppor-
tunities has been built on two important observations. First, the primary concern
in capital expenditure activity is to ensure the survival of the company by
implementing ideas to maximize future shareholder wealth, which is equivalent
to maximization of shareholder PW. Second, engineering economic analysis plays
a vital role in deciding which projects are recommended for funding approval and
included in a company’s overall capital investment portfolio.
Problems
The number in parentheses that follows each problem
refers to the section from which the problem is taken.
13-1. In 2015, a ﬁrm has receipts of $8 million and
expenses (excluding depreciation) of $4 million. Its
depreciation for 2015 amounts to $2 million. If the
effective income tax rate is 40%, what is this ﬁrm’s net
operating income after taxes (NOPAT)? (13.2)
13-2. The Caterpillar Company has a beta (a measure of
common stock volatility) of 1.28. What is its estimated
cost of equity capital based on the CAPM when the
risk-free interest rate is 2.5%? (13.3)
13-3. Refer to the associated graph. Identify when the
WACC approach to project acceptability agrees with
the CAPM approach. When do recommendations of
the two approaches differ? Explain why. (13.3)

13-4. A ﬁrm is considering a capital investment.
The risk premium is 0.04, and it is considered to
be constant through time. Riskless investments may
now be purchased to yield 0.06 (6%). If the project’s
beta (β) is 1.5, what is the expected return for this
investment? (13.3)
13-5. The price to earnings (P/E) ratio is an after-tax
metric reﬂecting growth potential of the common stock
of a corporation. P is the selling price (per share) of
the common stock, and E is the after-tax earnings per
year of a share of stock. A high P/E ratio, for example,
indicates that a ﬁrm is in a high-growth industry (such
as biotechnology) and that annual earnings are not as
important to investors as the growth rate of the price of
common stock is. Because a corporation can be assumed
to have an indeﬁnitely long life, the P/E ratio can be
likened to the (P/A, i′%, N) factor when N approaches
inﬁnity. For a certain transportation company, the P/E
ratio is 12. What is the implied IRR for this relatively
stable company? (13.3)
13-6. Explain the various degrees of dependency
among two or more projects. If one or more projects
seem desirable and are complementary to a given
project,
should those complementary projects be
included in a proposal package or kept separate for
review by management? (13.5)
13-7. A four-year-old truck has a present net realizable
value of $6,000 and is now expected to have a market
value of $1,800 after its remaining three-year life. Its
operating disbursements are expected to be $720 per
year.
An equivalent truck can be leased for $0.40 per mile
plus $30 a day for each day the truck is kept. The
expected annual utilization is 3,000 miles and 30 days.
If the before-tax MARR is 15%, ﬁnd which alternative
is better by comparing before-tax equivalent annual
costs
a. using only the preceding information (13.8);
b. using further information that the annual cost of
having to operate without a truck is $2,000. (13.8)

PROBLEMS 573
13-8. Work Problem 13-7 by comparing after-tax equi-
valent PWs if the effective income tax rate is 40%,
the present book value is $5,000, and the depreciation
charge is $1,000 per year if the ﬁrm continues to own the
truck. Any gains or losses on disposal of the old truck
affect taxes at the full 40% rate, and the after-tax MARR
is 5%. (13.8)
13-9. A lathe costs $56,000 and is expected to result in
net cash inﬂows of $20,000 at the end of each year for
three years and then have a market value of $10,000
at the end of the third year. The equipment could be
leased for $22,000 a year, with the ﬁrst payment due
immediately. (13.8)
a. If the organization does not pay income taxes and
its MARR is 10%, show whether the organization
should lease or purchase the equipment.
b. If the lathe is thought to be worth only, say, $18,000
per year to the organization, what is the better
economic decision?
13-10. The Shakey Company can ﬁnance the purchase
of a new building costing $2 million with a bond issue,
for which it would pay $100,000 interest per year, and
then repay the $2 million at the end of the life of the
building. Instead of buying in this manner, the company
can lease the building by paying $125,000 per year,
the ﬁrst payment being due one year from now. The
building would be fully depreciated for tax purposes
over an expected life of 20 years. The income tax rate is
40% for all expenses and capital gains or losses, and the
ﬁrm’s after-tax MARR is 5%. Use AW analysis based on
equity (nonborrowed) capital to determine whether the
ﬁrm should borrow and buy or lease if, at the end of
20 years, the building has the following market values
for the owner: (a) nothing, (b) $500,000. Straight-line
depreciation will be used but is allowable only if the
company purchases the building. (13.8)
13-11. The Capitalpoor Company is considering
purchasing a business machine for $100,000.
An
alternative is to rent it for $35,000 at the beginning of
each year. The rental would include all repairs and
service. If the machine is purchased, a comparable
repair and service contract can be obtained for $1,000
per year.
The salesperson of the business machine ﬁrm has
indicated that the expected useful service life of this
machine is ﬁve years, with zero market value, but the
company is not sure how long the machine will actually
be needed. If the machine is rented, the company can
cancel the lease at the end of any year. Assuming an
income tax rate of 25%, a straight-line depreciation
charge of $20,000 for each year the machine is kept,
and an after-tax MARR of 10%, prepare an appropriate
analysis to help the ﬁrm decide whether it is more
desirable to purchase or rent. (13.8)
13-12. Aﬁrm is considering the development of several
new products. The products under consideration are
listed in the next table. Products in each group are
mutually exclusive. At most, one product from each
group will be selected. The ﬁrm has a MARR of 10%
per year and a budget limitation on development costs
of $2,100,000. The life of all products is assumed to be
10 years, with no salvage value. Formulate this capital
allocation problem as a linear integer programming
model. (13.9)

investments from multiple sources. To evaluate poten-

must be accounted for in the interest rate used to
discount cash ﬂows and measure project proﬁtability.
Consider a large multinational company with an effec-
tive income tax rate of 49.24%. The percentage of
long-term debt in its capital structure is 49%, and its
before-tax annual cost is 9.34%. In its capital structure,
the ﬁrm also has 13% preferred stock paying 8.22% per
year and 38% common equity valued at 16.5% per year.
What is the weighted average cost of capital for this ﬁrm
(after taxes)?

CHAPTER 14
Decision Making Considering
Multiattributes
The aim of Chapter 14 is to present situations in which a decision maker
must recognize and address multiple problem attributes.
The Aftermath of Hurricane Katrina
I
n 2005, the city of New Orleans and many areas in Louisiana,
Mississippi, and Alabama were devastated by Hurricane Katrina.
The cost in lives and property damage was tremendous. Although
there was much ﬁnger pointing and time spent determining whom to blame,
the biggest questions were how to restore the area and what to do to prevent
such devastation in the future. The answers are not simple. Consider the decision
regarding what to do to prevent this from reoccurring. Of course, cost is a major
element of the decision, but dollars are not the only consideration. Time is also
important—how quickly can residents get some level of protection? What about
the environmental impact of the solution? What about the conﬁdence of the
residents who want to stay and rebuild? In this chapter, we consider how to
make decisions when we take into account the many attributes present in this
type of problem.

All models are wrong, some are useful.
—George E.P. Box
14.1 Introduction
All chapters up to Chapter 14 dealt principally with the assessment of equivalent
monetary worth of competing alternatives and proposals, but few decisions are
based strictly on dollars and cents. In this chapter, our attention is directed at how
diverse nonmonetary considerations (attributes) that arise from multiple objectives
can be explicitly included in the evaluation of engineering and business ventures.
By nonmonetary, we mean that a formal market mechanism does not exist in which
value can be established for various aspects of a venture’s performance such as
aesthetic appeal, employee morale, and environmental enhancement.
Value is difﬁcult to deﬁne because it is used in a variety of ways. In fact, in
350 bc, Aristotle conceived seven classes of value that are still recognized today:
(1) economic, (2) moral, (3) aesthetic, (4) social, (5) political, (6) religious, and
(7) judicial. Of these classes, only economic value (hopefully) can be measured in
terms of objective monetary units such as dollars, yen, or euros. Economic value,
however, is also established through an item’s use value (properties that provide
a unit of use, work, or service) and esteem value (properties that make something
desirable). In highly simpliﬁed terms, we can say that use values cause a product to
perform (e.g., a car serves as a reliable means of transportation), and esteem values
cause it to sell (e.g., a convertible automobile has a look of sportiness). Use value
and esteem value defy precise quantiﬁcation in monetary terms, so we often resort
to multiattribute techniques for evaluating the total value of complex designs and
complicated systems.
14.2 Examples of Multiattribute Decisions
A common situation encountered by a new engineering graduate is selecting his
or her ﬁrst permanent professional job. Suppose that Mary Jones, a 22-year-old
graduate engineer, is fortunate enough to have four acceptable job offers in writing.
A choice among the four offers must be made within the next four weeks or they
become void. She is not sure which offer to accept, but she decides to base her
choice on these four important factors or attributes (not necessarily listed in their
order of importance to her): (1) social climate of the town in which she will be
working, (2) the opportunity for outdoor sports, (3) starting salary, and (4) potential
for promotion and career advancement. Mary Jones next forms a table and ﬁlls it
in with objective and subjective data relating to differences among the four offers.
576

SECTION 14.2 / EXAMPLES OF MULTIATTRIBUTE DECISIONS 577
The completed table (or matrix) is shown as Table 14-1. Notice that three attributes
are rated subjectively on a scale ranging from poor to excellent.
It is not uncommon for monetary and nonmonetary data to be key ingredients
in decision situations such as this rather elementary one. Take a minute or two to
ponder which offer you would accept, given only the data in Table 14-1. Would
starting salary dominate all other attributes, so that your choice would be the Apex
Corporation in New York? Would you try to trade off poor social climate against
excellent career advancement in Flagstaff to make the McGraw-Wesley offer your
top choice?
Many decision problems in industry can be reduced to matrix form similar to
that of the foregoing job selection example. To illustrate the wide applicability of
such a tabular summary of data, consider a second example involving the choice
of a computer-aided design (CAD) workstation by an architectural engineering
ﬁrm. The data are summarized in Table 14-2. Three vendors and do nothing
compose the list of feasible alternatives (choices) in this decision problem, and a
total of seven attributes is judged sufﬁcient for purposes of discriminating among
the alternatives. Aside from the question of which workstation to select, other
signiﬁcant questions come to mind in multiattribute decision making: (1) How are
the attributes chosen in the ﬁrst place? (2) Who makes the subjective judgments
regarding nonmonetary attributes such as quality or operating ﬂexibility?
(3) What response is required—a partitioning of alternatives or a rank-ordering of
alternatives, for instance? Several simple, though workable and credible, models
for selecting among alternatives such as those in Tables 14-1 and 14-2 are described
in this chapter.

CHAPTER 14 / DECISION MAKING CONSIDERING MULTIATTRIBUTES
14.3 Choice of Attributes
The choice of attributes used to judge alternative designs, systems, products,
processes, and so on is one of the most important tasks in multiattribute decision
analysis. (The most important task, of course, is to identify the feasible alternatives
from which to select.) The articulation of attributes for a particular decision can, in
some cases, shed enough light on the problem to make the ﬁnal choice obvious.
Consider again the data in Tables 14-1 and 14-2. Some general observations
regarding the attributes used to discriminate among alternatives can immediately
be made: (1) each attribute distinguishes at least two alternatives—in no case
should identical values for an attribute apply to all alternatives; (2) each attribute
captures a unique dimension or facet of the decision problem (i.e., attributes
are independent and nonredundant); (3) all attributes, in a collective sense, are
assumed to be sufﬁcient for the purpose of selecting the best alternative; and
(4) differences in values assigned to each attribute are presumed to be meaningful
in distinguishing among feasible alternatives.
Selectingasetofattributesisusuallytheresultofgroupconsensusandisclearly
a subjective process. The ﬁnal list of attributes, both monetary and nonmonetary, is
heavily inﬂuenced by the decision problem at hand, as well as by an intuitive feel
for which attributes will or will not pinpoint relevant differences among feasible
alternatives. If too many attributes are chosen, the analysis will become unwieldy,
unreliable, and difﬁcult to manage. Too few attributes, on the other hand, will limit
discrimination among alternatives. Again, judgment is required to decide what
number is too few or too many. If some attributes in the ﬁnal list lack speciﬁcity
or cannot be quantiﬁed, it will be necessary to subdivide them into lower-level
attributes that can be measured.
To illustrate these points, we might consider adding an attribute called
cost of operating and maintaining the system in Table 14-2 to capture a vital
dimension of the CAD system’s life-cycle cost. The attribute ﬂexibility should
perhaps be subdivided into two other, more speciﬁc attributes such as ability
to communicate with computer-aided manufacturing equipment (such as numerically
controlledmachinetools)andabilitytocreateandanalyzesolidgeometryrepresentations
of engineering design concepts. Finally, it would be constructive to aggregate two
attributes in Table 14-2, namely quality and market share. Because there is no
difference in the values assigned to these two attributes across the four alternatives,
they could be combined into a single attribute, possibly named achievement of greater
market share through quality improvements. But one should take great care in doing
this. If it is possible that a new alternative might have differences in the values
assigned to these two attributes, then they should be left as they are.
14.4 Selection of a Measurement Scale
Identifying feasible alternatives and appropriate attributes represents a large
portion of the work associated with multiattribute decision analysis. The next
task is to develop metrics, or measurement scales, that permit various states of
each attribute to be represented. For example, in Table 14-1, “dollars” was an
obvious choice for the metric of starting salary. A subjective assessment of career

SECTION 14.6 / NONCOMPENSATORY MODELS 579
advancement was made on a metric having the gradations poor, fair, good, very
good, and excellent. In many problems, the metric is simply the scale upon which a
physicalmeasurementismade. Forinstance, anticipatednoisepollutionforvarious
routings of an urban highway project might be a relevant attribute whose metric
is decibels.
14.5 Dimensionality of the Problem
If you refer once again to Table 14-1, notice that there are two basic ways to process
the information presented there. First, you could attempt to collapse each job offer
into a single metric or dimension. For instance, all attributes could somehow be
forced into their dollar equivalents, or they could be reduced to a utility equivalent
ranging from, say, 0 to 100. Assigning a dollar value to good career advancement
may not be too difﬁcult, but how about placing a dollar value on a poor versus an
excellent social climate? Similarly, translating all job offer data to a scale of worth or
utility that ranges from 0 to 100 may not be plausible to most individuals. This ﬁrst
way of dealing with the data of Table 14-1 is called single-dimension analysis. (The
dimension corresponds to the number of metrics used to represent the attributes
that discriminate among alternatives.)
Collapsing all information into a single dimension is popular in practice
because a complex problem can be made computationally tractable in this manner.
Several useful models presented later are single-dimensioned. Such models are
termed compensatory because changes in the values of a particular attribute can be
offset by, or traded off against, opposing changes in another attribute.
The second basic way to process information in Table 14-1 is to retain the
individuality of the attributes as the best alternative is being determined. That is,
there is no attempt to collapse attributes into a common scale. This is referred
to as full-dimension analysis of the multiattribute problem. For example, if r
attributes have been chosen to characterize the alternatives under consideration,
the predicted values for all r attributes are considered in the choice. If a metric is
common to more than one attribute, as in Table 14-1, we have an intermediate-
dimension problem that is analyzed with the same models as a full-dimension
problem would be. Several of these models are illustrated in the next section, and
they are often most helpful in eliminating inferior alternatives from the analysis.
We refer to these models as noncompensatory because trade-offs among attributes
are not permissible. Thus, comparisons of alternatives must be judged on an
attribute-by-attribute basis.
14.6 Noncompensatory Models
In this section, we examine four noncompensatory models for making a choice
when multiple attributes are present. They are (1) dominance, (2) satisﬁcing,
(3) disjunctive resolution, and (4) lexicography. In each model, an attempt is made
to select the best alternative in view of the full dimensionality of the problem.
Example 14-1 is presented after the description of these models and will be utilized
to illustrate each.

580
CHAPTER 14 / DECISION MAKING CONSIDERING MULTIATTRIBUTES
14.6.1
Dominance
Dominance is a useful screening method for eliminating inferior alternatives
from the analysis. When one alternative is better than another with respect to
all attributes, there is no problem in deciding between them. In this case, the
ﬁrst alternative dominates the second one. By comparing each possible pair of
alternatives to determine whether the attribute values for one are at least as good
as those for the other, it may be possible to eliminate one or more candidates from
further consideration or even to select the single alternative that is clearly superior
to all the others. Usually it will not be possible to select the best alternative based
on dominance.
14.6.2
Satisﬁcing
Satisﬁcing, sometimes referred to as the method of feasible ranges, requires the
establishment of minimum or maximum acceptable values (the standard) for each
attribute. Alternatives having one or more attribute values that fall outside the
acceptable limits are excluded from further consideration.
Theupperandlowerboundsoftheserangesestablishtwoﬁctitiousalternatives
against which maximum and minimum performance expectations of feasible
alternatives can be deﬁned. By bounding the permissible values of attributes from
two sides (or from one), information processing requirements are substantially
reduced, making the evaluation problem more manageable.
Satisﬁcing is more difﬁcult to use than dominance because minimum accep-
table attribute values must be determined. Furthermore, satisﬁcing is usually
employed to evaluate feasible alternatives in more detail and to reduce the number
being considered rather than to make a ﬁnal choice. The satisﬁcing principle is
frequently used in practice when satisfactory performance on each attribute, rather
than optimal performance, is good enough for decision-making purposes.
14.6.3
Disjunctive Resolution
The disjunctive method is similar to satisﬁcing in that it relies on comparing the
attributes of each alternative to the standard. The difference is that the disjunctive
method evaluates each alternative on the best value achieved for any attribute. If an
alternative has just one attribute that meets or exceeds the standard, that alternative
is kept. In satisﬁcing, all attributes must meet or exceed the standard in order for
an alternative to be kept in the feasible set.
14.6.4
Lexicography
This model is particularly suitable for decision situations in which a single attribute
is judged to be more important than all other attributes. A ﬁnal choice might be
based solely on the most acceptable value for this attribute. Comparing alternatives
with respect to one attribute reduces the decision problem to a single dimension
(i.e., the measurement scale of the predominant attribute). The alternative having
the highest value for the most important attribute is then chosen. When two or more
alternatives have identical values for the most important attribute, however, the
second most important attribute must be speciﬁed and used to break the deadlock.

SECTION 14.6 / NONCOMPENSATORY MODELS 581
If ties continue to occur, the analyst examines the next most important attribute
until a single alternative is chosen or until all alternatives have been evaluated.
Lexicography requires that the importance of each attribute be speciﬁed to
determine the order in which attributes are to be considered. If a selection is made
by using one or a few of the attributes, lexicography does not take into account all
the collected data. Lexicography does not require comparability across attributes,
but it does process information in its original metric.
EXAMPLE 14-1
Selecting a Dentist by Using Noncompensatory Models
Mary Jones, the engineering graduate whose job offers were given in Table 14-1,
has decided, based on comprehensive reasoning, to accept the Sigma position
in Macon, Georgia. (Problem 14-9 will provide insight into why this choice
was made.) Having moved to Macon, Mary now faces several other important
multiattribute problems. Among them are (1) renting an apartment versus
purchasing a small house, (2) what type of automobile or truck to purchase,
and (3) whom to select for long-overdue dental work.
In this example, we consider the selection of a dentist as a means of
illustrating noncompensatory (full-dimensioned) and compensatory (single-
dimensioned) models for analyzing multiattribute decision problems.
After calling many dentists she found through online Web sites, Mary ﬁnds
that there are only four who are accepting new patients. They are Dr. Molar,
Dr. Feelgood, Dr. Whoops, and Dr. Pepper. The alternatives are clear to Mary,
and she decides that her objectives in selecting a dentist are to obtain high-quality
dental care at a reasonable cost with minimum disruption to her schedule and
little (or no) pain involved. In this regard, Mary adopts these attributes to assist
in gathering data and making her ﬁnal choice: (1) reputation of the dentist,
(2) cost per hour of dental work, (3) available ofﬁce hours each week, (4) travel
distance, and (5) method of anesthesia. Notice that these attributes are more
or less independent in that the value of one attribute cannot be predicted by
knowing the value of any other attribute.
Mary collects data by interviewing the receptionist in each dental ofﬁce,
talking with local townspeople, calling the Georgia Dental Association, and so
on. A summary of information gathered by Mary is presented in Table 14-3.
We are now asked to determine whether a dentist can be selected by using
(a) dominance, (b) satisﬁcing, (c) disjunctive resolution, and (d) lexicography.
Solution
(a) To check for dominance in Table 14-3, pairwise comparisons of each
dentist’s set of attributes must be inspected. There will be 4(3)/2 = 6
pairwise comparisons necessary for the four dentists, and they are shown
in Table 14-4. It is clear from Table 14-4 that Dr. Molar dominates
Dr. Feelgood, so Dr. Feelgood will be dropped from further consideration.
With dominance, it is not possible for Mary to select the best dentist.

(b) To illustrate the satisﬁcing model, acceptable limits (feasible ranges) must be
established for each attribute. After considerable thought, Mary determines
the feasible ranges given in Table 14-5.
Comparison of attribute values for each dentist against the feasible range
reveals that Dr. Whoops uses a less desirable type of anesthesia (hypnosis
< acupuncture), and his quality rating is also not acceptable (poor < good).
Thus, Dr. Whoops joins Dr. Feelgood on Mary’s list of rejects. Notice that
satisﬁcing, by itself, did not produce the best alternative.
(c) By applying the feasible ranges in Table 14-5 to the disjunctive resolution
model, all dentists would be acceptable because each has at least one
attribute value that meets or exceeds the minimum expectation. For
instance, Dr. Whoops scores acceptably on three out of ﬁve attributes, and
Dr. Feelgood passes two out of ﬁve minimum expectations. Clearly, this
model does not discriminate well among the four candidates.
(d) Many models, including lexicography, require that all attributes ﬁrst be
ranked in order of importance. Perhaps the easiest way to obtain a consistent

ordinal ranking is to make paired comparisons between each possible
attribute combination.∗This is illustrated in Table 14-6. Each attribute can be
ranked according to the number of times it appears on the left-hand side of
the comparison when the preferred attribute is placed on the left as shown.

is the top-ranked attribute, and Molar’s quality rating is the best of all. If
Dr. Pepper’s work quality had also been rated as excellent, the choice would
be made on the basis of cost. This would have resulted in the selection of
Dr. Pepper. Therefore, lexicography does allow the best dentist to be chosen
by Mary.
14.7
Compensatory Models
The basic principle behind all compensatory models, which involve a single
dimension, is that the values for all attributes must be converted to a common
measurement scale such as dollars or utiles,∗from which it is possible to construct
an overall dollar index or utility index for each alternative. The form of the function
used to calculate the index can vary widely. For example, the converted attribute
values may be added together, they may be weighted and then added, or they may
be sequentially multiplied. Regardless of the functional form, the end result is that
good performance in one attribute can compensate for poor performance in another.
This allows trade-offs among attributes to be made during the process of selecting
the best alternative. Because lexicography involves no trade-offs, it was classiﬁed
as a full-dimensional model in Section 14.6.4.
In this section,
we examine two compensatory models for evaluating
multiattribute decision problems: nondimensional scaling and the additive weight-
ing technique. Each model will be illustrated by using the data of Example 14-1.
The interested reader can consult Canada et al. for a discussion of other methods.†
14.7.1
Nondimensional Scaling
Apopular way to standardize attribute values is to convert them to nondimensional
form. There are two important points to consider when doing this. First, the
∗A utile is a dimensionless unit of worth.
† Canada, et al., Capital Investment Decision Analysis for Engineering and Management, 3rd ed. (Upper Saddle River, NJ:
Prentice Hall, 2005).

SECTION 14.7 / COMPENSATORY MODELS 585
nondimensional values should all have a common range, such as 0 to 1 or 0 to
100. Without this constraint, the dimensionless attributes will contain implicit
weighting factors. Second, all of the dimensionless attributes should follow the
same trend with respect to desirability; the most preferred values should be either
all small or all large. This is necessary in order to have a believable overall scale for
selecting the best alternative.
Nondimensional scaling can be illustrated with the data of Example 14-1.
As shown in Table 14-8, the preceding constraints may require that different
procedures be used to remove the dimension from each attribute. For example,
a cost-related attribute is best when it is low, but ofﬁce hours are best when they
are high. The goal should be to devise a procedure that rates each attribute in
terms of its fractional accomplishment of the best attainable value. Table 14-3, the
original table of information for Example 14-1, is restated in dimensionless terms
in Table 14-9. The procedure for converting the original data in Table 14-3 for a
particular attribute to its dimensionless rating is
Rating = Worst outcome −Outcome being made dimensionless
Worst outcome −Best outcome
.
(14-1)
Equation (14-1) applies when large numerical values, such as cost or driving
distance, are considered to be undesirable. When large numerical values are
considered to be desirable (anesthesia, ofﬁce hours, quality), however, the
relationship for converting original data to their dimensionless ratings is
Rating = Outcome being made dimensionless −Worst outcome
Best outcome −Worst outcome
.

CHAPTER 14 / DECISION MAKING CONSIDERING MULTIATTRIBUTES
If all the attributes in Table 14-9 are of equal importance, a score for each dentist
could be found by merely summing the nondimensional values in each column.
The results would be Dr. Molar = 4.10, Dr. Feelgood = 1.06, Dr. Whoops = 3.00,
and Dr. Pepper = 3.01. Presumably, Dr. Molar would be the best choice in this case.
Figure 14-1 displays a spreadsheet application of the nondimensional scaling
procedure for Example 14-1. The attribute ratings for each alternative are entered
into the table in the range B2:E6. Next, tables for the qualitative attributes (quality
and method of anesthesia) are entered into conversion tables (A9:B12 and D9:E12).
These tables must have the qualitative rating in alphabetical order.
The dimensionless rating for each alternative/attribute combination is deter-
mined by comparing the difference between the alternative under consideration
with the lowest scoring alternative. This difference is then divided by the range
between the best and worst scoring alternatives to arrive at the nondimensional
value. The total score for each alternative is found by summing these values. The
formulas in the highlighted cells in Figure 14-1 are given on the next page.

14.7.2
The Additive Weighting Technique
Additive weighting provides for the direct use of nondimensional attributes such as
those in Table 14-9 and the results of ordinal ranking as illustrated in Table 14-6. The
procedure involves developing weights for attributes (based on ordinal rankings)
that can be multiplied by the appropriate nondimensional attribute values to
produce a partial contribution to the overall score for a particular alternative. When
the partial contributions of all attributes are summed, the resulting set of alternative
scores can be used to compare alternatives directly. In the previous section, these
partial contributions were assumed to be equal, but in this section they can be
unequal based on how important they are believed to be.
Attribute weights should be determined in two steps following the completion
of ordinal ranking. First, relative weights are assigned to each attribute according
to its ordinal ranking. The simplest procedure is to use rankings of 1, 2, 3,…, based
on position, with higher numbers signifying greater importance; but one might
also include subjective considerations by using uneven spacing in some cases. For
instance, in a case where there are four attributes, two of which are much more
important than the others, the top two may be rated as 7 and 5 instead of 4 and 3.
The second step is to normalize the relative ranking numbers by dividing each
ranking number by the sum of all the rankings. Table 14-10 summarizes these
steps for Example 14-1 and demonstrates how the overall score for each alternative
is determined.
Additive weighting is probably the most popular single-dimensional method
because it includes both the performance ratings and the importance weights
of each attribute when evaluating alternatives. Furthermore, it produces recom-
mendations that tend to agree with the intuitive feel of the decision maker
concerning the best alternative. Perhaps its biggest advantage is that removing
the dimension from data and weighting attributes are separated into two distinct
steps. This reduces confusion and allows for precise deﬁnition of each of these
contributions. From Table 14-10, it is apparent that the additive weighting score for
Dr. Molar (0.84) makes him the top choice as Mary’s dentist.
Figure 14-2 shows a spreadsheet application of the additive weighting
technique for the dentist selection problem of Example 14-1. The relative ranking
of attributes (Table 14-6) is entered in the range B3:B7. These values are normalized
(put on a 0–1 scale) in column C. For each alternative, the normalized weight of the
attribute is multiplied by the nondimensional attribute value (obtained from the

EXAMPLE 14-2
Decision Making in the Aftermath of Hurricane Katrina
Let us revisit Hurricane Katrina. Decisions must be made about how to replace
the ﬂood protection and prevent the type of devastation that occurred. These
decisions are based on myriad factors and certainly have many social and
political consequences. There is no way to do justice to this type of problem in
this text, but we will examine a ﬁctitious example based on data available in
the popular press (ABC News and Time magazine—www.time.com/time/
specials/2007/article/0.28804, 1646611_1646683_1648904-2,
00.html).
Plans must be put into place to protect life and property in and around the
city of New Orleans, in the event of another hurricane event such as Katrina.
Interestingly, the hurricane was not one of the most powerful and had been
downgraded to a category 3 storm when she made landfall. This speaks of a
more urgent need, knowing that the devastation could have been worse.
Assume that, after using the noncompensatory models, three primary
alternatives remain available, as given in Table 14-11. Also shown in the table
are a number of attributes to be considered in making the decision about which
alternative to select. In reality, of course, there would likely be many more
alternatives (and variations on alternatives) available after initial analysis, and
many more attributes to consider.
We will use the additive weighting technique to recommend a course of
action.

Solution
Section 14.7.2 presents the methods used in additive weighting. Table 14-12
contains ordinal rankings and the resulting weights of the various attributes (of
course, these may vary from one decision maker to another).
The nondimensional scaling of the possible attribute values (using
maximum and minimum values from the given alternatives) are presented in
Table 14-13.
When the weights are combined with the performance for each alternative,
we obtain the results shown in Table 14-14.

Examining Table 14-14, and given the scaling and weights used, the decision
would be restoration and restructure through nonstructural methods.
14.8
Summary
Several methods have been described for dealing with multiattribute decisions.
Some key points are as follows:
1. When it is desired to maximize a single criterion of choice, such as PW, the
evaluation of multiple alternatives is relatively straightforward.
2. For any decision, the objectives, available alternatives, and important attributes
must be clearly deﬁned at the beginning. Construction of a decision matrix such
as that in Table 14-1 helps this process.
3. Decision making can become quite convoluted when multiple objectives and
attributes must be included in an engineering economy study.
4. Multiattribute models can be classiﬁed as either multidimensional or single-
dimensional. Multidimensional techniques analyze the attributes in terms
of their original metrics.
Single-dimensional techniques reduce attribute
measurements to a common measurement scale.
5. Multidimensional, or noncompensatory, models are most useful for the initial
screening of alternatives. In some instances, they can be used to make a

PROBLEMS 593
ﬁnal selection, but this usually involves a high degree of subjectivity. Of the
multidimensional methods discussed, dominance is probably the least selective,
while satisﬁcing is probably the most selective.
6. Single-dimensional, or compensatory, models are useful for making a ﬁnal
choice among alternatives. The additive weighting technique allows superb
performance in some attributes to compensate for poor performance in others.
7. When dealing with multiattribute problems that have many attributes and
alternatives to be considered, it is advisable to apply a combination of several
models in sequence for the purpose of reducing the selection process to a
manageable activity.
Problems
The number in parentheses that follows each problem
refers to the section from which the problem is taken.
14-1. As a recent college graduate you are ready for
the same thing every recent graduate is ready for—a
new car! You know this is a big decision, so you want
to immediately put to use the tools you learned in
engineering economy. Deﬁne ﬁve attributes you would
use in the selection of a new car and rank them in
order of importance. Assign approximate weights to the
attributes by using a method discussed in this chapter.
Be prepared to defend your attributes and their weights.

14-9. Mary Jones utilized the additive weighting
technique to select a job with Sigma Ltd., in Macon,
Georgia. The importance weights she placed on the
four attributes in Table 14-1 were social climate = 1.00,
starting salary = 0.50, career advancement = 0.33, and
weather/sports = 0.25. Nondimensional values given
to her ratings in Table 14-1 were excellent = 1.00, very
good = 0.70, good = 0.40, fair = 0.25, and poor = 0.10.
a. Normalize Mary’s importance weights.
b. Develop nondimensional values for the starting
salary attribute.
c. Use the results of (a) and (b) in a decision matrix to
see if Mary’s choice was consistent with the results
obtained from the additive weighting technique.

14-10. Hiring an employee is always a multiattribute
decision process. Most jobs possess a diversity of
requirements, and most applicants have a diversity of

applicants for a job in a pharmaceutical company. Use
the tools of this chapter to examine the candidates.

14-11. The town of Whoopup has decided that it needs
a new public library. Although the city leaders have
made this decision, the decision of location of the library
is still an open question. Knowing that you have a
background in economic decision making, they selected
you to formulate their decision problem.
You gather data from the city leaders to determine
the important attributes to consider in the decision; you
then acquire information for both sites and present it in
Table P14-11 (see p. 596).
Use the tools introduced in this chapter to make a
site recommendation. Prepare to defend your analysis.

14-15. When traveling, one always has a choice of
airlines. However, which should you choose? Many
attributes are worthy of consideration, some of which
are cost, airline miles, number of hops (intermediate
stops between departure and ﬁnal destination), and
type of airplane (some people just do not like those
small planes). Some people like more hops because each
brings them more points in their frequent ﬂyer program.
Others want to minimize hops. On a particular trip,
you have gathered data about the possible travel
alternatives, and they are listed in Table P14-15.
Use four noncompensatory methods for dealing
with multiple attributes (dominance, satisﬁcing, disjun-
ctive resolution,
and lexicography) and determine
whether a selection can be made,
or alternatives
eliminated,
with each.
You will need to develop
additional data that reﬂect your preferences. (14.6)
14-16. For the data from Problem 14-15, apply the addi-
tive weighting technique, using weights you develop,
to make a travel decision. (14.7)

store.
According
to
Time
magazine (August 13, 2007, page 50), paper bags cost
5.7 cents each as opposed to 2.2 cents per plastic bag.
After leaving the store with several plastic bags, you
decide to do some research on paper versus plastic
bags. The Time article goes on to inform you that the
United States uses 12 million barrels of oil to produce
its plastic bags consumed annually. Furthermore, paper
bags consumed in the United states equate to 14
million trees a year. What other factors might go
into a multiattribute analysis of the pros and cons of
paper versus plastic bags (e.g., littering, leak potential,
biodegradability, transportation to landﬁlls)? Use the
additive weighting technique to assess the impact of
imposing a 3 cent “ﬁnder’s fee” for returning plastic
bags to an approved recycling center. (14.7)

APPENDIX A
Using Excel to Solve
Engineering Economy
Problems
by James A. Alloway, Jr.
EMSQ Associates
This appendix presents techniques and speciﬁc functions needed to formulate
spreadsheet models for solving engineering economy problems. The spreadsheet
examples in the text use Microsoft Excel because of its widespread use. Other
spreadsheet software, such as Lotus 1-2-3 and Corel Quattro Pro, can be used
equally as well, with only minor changes to the formulas.
A.1 Spreadsheet Basics
The basic spreadsheet components and notation are shown in Figure A-1. The row
immediately above the worksheet column headings is the formula bar. The cell is
the basic building block of the spreadsheet and is identiﬁed by its column letter
and row number. In Figure A-1, the text SAMPLE SPREADSHEET is in cell C2, the
intersection of column C and row 2. The box on the left of the formula bar indicates
the active cell, which in this case is C2. The contents of the active cell appear in the
box to the right of fx on the formula bar.
The other fundamental spreadsheet entity is the range, which can be a single
cell, a portion of a row or column, or any uniform rectangular region. A range is
identiﬁed by its ﬁrst and last cells separated by a colon (e.g., H1:H7). A one-cell
range has the same starting and ending cell (e.g., B1:B1), while a rectangular range
uses the top left and bottom right cells (e.g., A1:G7). When prompted for a range
by Excel, move the cell pointer to the ﬁrst cell in the range and anchor the range
by pressing the colon key. Then move to the last cell in the range and press the
Enter key.
598

SECTION A.2 / TYPES OF INPUT
599
Figure A-1
Sample Excel Worksheet Showing Basic Terms and Relationships
A.2 Types of Input
A cell may contain numbers (e.g., −1.23, 123456789, 49E-15), formulas (e.g., =
A23∗5, = 7+4∧2.3, = 5 + min(A1:A10)), or labels (e.g., AlternativeAlpha). Cells can
be edited by moving to the desired cell and pressing the F2 key. The keyboard arrow
keys will now move the cursor within the expression. Use the Delete or Backspace
key to delete characters. The Insert key toggles between insert and type-over mode.
It is helpful to document the input values and results with explanatory labels,
which are left-justiﬁed by default. In Figure A-1, cell D2 appears to contain
PREADSHEET, but in fact the cell is empty. This is because formulas that are longer
than the column width spill over to adjacent blank cells.
Numbers are right-justiﬁed by default and are entered without commas
or currency signs. These features are added separately by using formatting
commands, which are described in Section A.4.
Formulas consist of algebraic expressions and functions. In Excel, the ﬁrst
character in the cell must be an equal (=) sign. Reference to other cells is done
by either (a) clicking the cell with the mouse, (b) pointing to the cell by using the
four keyboard arrow keys, (c) typing the cell address directly, or (d) entering the
range name, if one has been assigned. Expressions are evaluated left to right and
follow typical precedence rules. Exponentiation is denoted in Excel with the hat
symbol (∧).

(b) There is exactly one period between cash ﬂows.
(c) The period length remains constant.
(d) The end of period cash-ﬂow convention is utilized.
(e) The ﬁrst cash ﬂow in a range occurs at the end of the ﬁrst period.
The last assumption needs to be emphasized, since most problems involve an
investment at k = 0, which is the beginning of the ﬁrst period. This only affects
the NPV function (see p. 609 for more details). Be sure to review the assumptions
made in your particular spreadsheet package.
The most frequently used ﬁnancial functions for engineering economy analysis
are as follows:
PV(i, N, A)
returns the present worth of an annuity.
FV(i, N, A)
returns the future worth of an annuity.
PMT(i, N, P)
returns an annuity-given a present worth.
NPV(i, range)
returns the present worth of any cash ﬂow.
IRR(guess, range)
returns the internal rate of return for a range of cash ﬂows.
There is no space preceding the left parenthesis in Excel functions. A, i, and N
are single values and have the same deﬁnitions as in Chapter 4. Range is the cash-
ﬂow range, and guess is a decimal estimate of the internal rate of return (IRR), which
is used internally by the IRR algorithm. The equivalent worth functions return
monetary amounts, not the discount factor values. Other functions, including
depreciation, are available. Check your particular spreadsheet program for their
availability and usage.
A.4 Spreadsheet Appearance
Blank rows and columns are inserted into a worksheet with the commands Insert
| Rows or Insert | Columns Rows and columns can be removed by highlighting
their row identiﬁer on the left and then using the Edit | Delete command. Be
careful when deleting rows and columns: remember, rows are horizontal, columns
are vertical. Larger areas of the spreadsheet can be cleared by highlighting the
range and using the Edit | Clear command. The dialog box allows one to delete cell
contents and/or cell formatting.
The appearance of numbers, such as the number of signiﬁcant digits and the
presence of dollar and percent signs or commas, is changed with the Format
| Cells command. Figure A-2 illustrates the results of several common formatting
and alignment options.
Long text entries with nonblank cells to the right and large numbers may
require wider columns to display their results. This can be done for each column
individually by using the Format | Column | Width command or by moving the
cursor to the edge of the column heading (the mouse pointer will change to a

double arrow) and dragging it in the appropriate direction. The alternative is to
allow the text to wrap in the cell using Format | Cells | Alignment | Text and check
the Wrap Text box. This will affect the row height.
A.4.1
Moving Cells
Cell contents are removed by highlighting the range and then using the Edit | Cut
command. Cell contents are placed in a new location by highlighting the ﬁrst cell
in the new range and using the Edit | Paste command. Anything in the new range
will be replaced with the new material.
The original location will be blank after the Cut command is issued. When a
formula is cut and subsequently pasted to a new location, the cell references of the
formula are automatically updated to reﬂect its new location. If a value is cut and
pasted to a new location, all formulas that refer to it are automatically revised to
reﬂect the new location.
A.4.2
Copying Cells
To copy the contents of a cell to a new location while leaving the original cell intact,
highlight the cell or range and use the Edit | Copy command. Move the cursor to
the new location and use the Edit | Paste command. Formulas in copied cells are
modiﬁed, as described in section A.5.
A.5
Cell Referencing
The manner in which cells in formulas are referenced internally provides the power
and ﬂexibility of spreadsheet software. These features make it possible to construct
complex models by using a minimal number of formulas and to get updated results
as values change. Many problems encountered by novice spreadsheet users can be
traced back to a lack of understanding of how formulas reference cells.
There are three methods to refer to the reference of a cell: relative, absolute,
and mixed. The distinction between them becomes important only when copying

602
APPENDIX A / USING EXCEL TO SOLVE ENGINEERING ECONOMY PROBLEMS
formulas. If cell B5 contains the formula = A4 + 1 and cell A4 contains the value 7,
then the result displayed in B5 is 8. Although the formula refers to cellA4, internally
the spreadsheet interprets it as “Add 1 to the contents of the cell that is one row
up and one column to the left of this cell.” This is relative referencing, which is
the default. When the formula in B5 is copied, the cell that receives the copy of the
formula will display the sum of 1 plus the contents of the cell that is one row up
and one column to the left of the new cell.
There are occasions when one always wants to refer to a speciﬁc cell, no matter
where a formula is copied. The interest rate, i, is typically a value that is constant
for a problem. Absolute referencing (a $ in front of both the column and row
designation, e.g., $A$1) will always return the contents of that speciﬁc cell, no
matter where the formula is copied.
Sometimes it is necessary to hold either the row or the column constant and
allow the other portion of the reference to vary. This is achieved with mixed
referencing. A $ is placed in front of the row or column that is to be kept constant.
Thus, $A1 will make the column reference absolute and the row reference relative,
while A$1 will make the row reference absolute and the column reference relative.
The F4 key can simplify the process of cell addressing. Each time the key is
pressed, the highlighted cell reference cycles through absolute, mixed row, mixed
column, and relative addressing.
Figure A-3 illustrates the results of the cut, copy, and paste commands for the
three types of referencing. The range A5:C9 contains arbitrary values. Cells E5:E9
contain formulas to compute the respective row totals. The actual formulas are
shown in column F. Results of cut, copy, and paste actions are shown in range
E13:E17, and the resulting formulas are in column F.

SECTION A.6 / STRUCTURED SPREADSHEETS 603
A.6
Structured Spreadsheets
Using a structured approach for model formulation reduces the chance of
overlooking information, aids in locating errors and making revisions, and makes
it easier for others to interpret your analysis. Taking a few minutes to organize the
data and plan the model prior to sitting down at the keyboard will reduce the total
development time. There is no single best format, but the following tips work well
in practice:
a. Treat everything as a variable, even if you do not expect it to change.
Assign key parameters, such as the interest rate, life, and estimates of revenue
and expenses, their own cells. Formulas should reference these cells, not the values
themselves. This way, if these values change, it is only necessary to revise these
few cells rather than try to locate all of the formulas that contain these values. If
these cells are located in the upper left corner of the spreadsheet, you can return to
them from anywhere in the spreadsheet by pressing the keyboard Home key.
b. Next, divide the problem into segments. Combining several calculations
into a single formula saves space, but such an approach makes it more difﬁcult
to verify results and locate errors. Each segment should provide an intermediate
result, which can be referenced in other segments and aids in isolating problems.
This recommendation also applies for different types of cash ﬂows. Rather than
combine revenues and expenses for each period prior to entry on the spreadsheet,
list each type of cash ﬂow in a column and sum them to get a net ﬁgure for each
period.
c. It is helpful to save each type of problem as a separate ﬁle, which is called
a template. When a similar problem is encountered in the future, the appropriate
template is retrieved, revised, and a new analysis is completed. If you are creating
a new spreadsheet from a template, be sure to change the ﬁle name the ﬁrst time
you save it, or the template will be overwritten.
d. It is possible to create new functions, automate commands, and create
new menus by using macros. These are beneﬁcial if you will be using a template
frequently, but macros are generally not productive in the classroom setting.
e. Range names are useful when entering long formulas and when using macros.
They can be assigned to any valid range (including a single cell) with the command
Insert | Name. Range names can be made absolute by preﬁxing the name with a
dollar sign.
Three examples follow that illustrate useful spreadsheet commands and
functions, in addition to basic model formulation techniques needed to solve
engineering economy problems. Keep the following points in mind:
a. Remain familiar with the hand solutions so that the spreadsheet model can
be veriﬁed.
b. Understand the course material ﬁrst, have a plan for solving the problem,
and then use the spreadsheet to help with the calculations.
c. Try the examples in this appendix to verify that they are working properly
with your particular spreadsheet.
d. Blindly copying formulas and pressing keys without taking the time to look
at what is going on doesn’t aid learning.

604
APPENDIX A / USING EXCEL TO SOLVE ENGINEERING ECONOMY PROBLEMS
e. Graphing your results can reveal relationships that may not be easily
discernable when looking at columns of numbers.
f. Save your work frequently and keep backups of your ﬁles.
EXAMPLE A-1
This example uses breakeven analysis to illustrate many basic spreadsheet
features. It includes examples of relative, mixed, and absolute cell addressing;
a simple formula; the use of a spreadsheet function; and a graph. Spreadsheet
commands used include formatting, label alignment, and the copy command.
Because of the copy command, only ﬁve unique formulas are required.
Consider two options, Alpha and Beta, each with its own set-up (ﬁxed)
cost and incremental (variable) cost. We wish to determine the least expensive
option for a given production quantity. The total cost (TC) for Q units produced
by either method is
TCm = FCm + ICm ∗Q,
where m is either Alpha or Beta, FC is the ﬁxed cost, IC is the incremental cost,
and Q is the number of units produced.
The spreadsheet for this problem is shown in Figure A-4. The data input
area is at the top of the worksheet. Here, the speciﬁc ﬁxed and variable costs
are entered (cells B2 to C3), along with the name of each alternative under
consideration (in cells B1 and C1). Cells B6 and B7 contain values that will be
used later to bracket the breakeven quantity.
The total cost formula is entered in cell B12, using mixed addressing,
and copied to the range B12:C22. The choice of cell in which to enter the
initial formula is arbitrary, and any other cell (e.g., Z798) could have been used
as well.
The Units Produced column is created with two formulas. Cell A12 uses
relative addressing to refer to the starting value in cell B6. Cell A13 uses relative
addressing to refer to the contents of the cell above it and absolute addressing
to refer to the increment value to be added to it. While the start and increment
values could be entered directly in the formulas, the current approach provides
greater ﬂexibility.
The general approach for solving a breakeven problem without using the
solver function is to set the start value to 0 and the increment value to some large
value, say 100. You may need to go higher or try other values, depending on
the speciﬁcs of your particular problem. Once the breakeven point is bracketed,
the start and increment values can be changed to get a more exact value. As the
graph in Figure A-5 indicates, the breakeven point occurs between 25 and 30, so
the start value can be changed to 25 and the increment reduced to 1 to locate the
exact breakeven quantity.
An IF function is used in column D to make it easier to identify the breakeven
point. It displays the name of the alternative with the lowest cost.
The graph is produced by highlighting the range A12:C22, then clicking on
the Chart Wizard and selecting the XY(Scatter) option.

APPENDIX A / USING EXCEL TO SOLVE ENGINEERING ECONOMY PROBLEMS
Since all values are treated as variables, a high degree of ﬂexibility is
inherent in the spreadsheet. Note that, as you change values, the spreadsheet is
automatically revised, as is the graph. Even the labels in column D are updated
if the names of the alternatives change!
EXAMPLE A-2
Cash ﬂows can take many forms, such as single unique values, annuities, and
gradients. Single values are entered individually into their respective cells.
Annuities are created by entering the ﬁrst period amount and then using the copy
command to ﬁll in the rest of the range. Both arithmetic and geometric gradients
are created in a spreadsheet with simple formulas and the copy command, as
shown in Figure A-6.
The formula in B8 copies the starting amount from which both gradients
build. By using absolute addressing, we are able to apply the same starting
amount to both columns. For an arithmetic gradient, cell B9 takes the amount
in the cell above it and adds a ﬁxed amount to it, as speciﬁed in B3. In a
geometric gradient, cell C9 takes the cell above it and multiplies it by the ﬁxed
percentage speciﬁed in B4. Note the use of absolute addressing in both gradient
formulastokeepthegradientquantityconstantasitiscopieddowneachcolumn.
Finally, B15 calculates the present worth of the gradient series. Note that absolute
addressing is used to hold the interest rate and base (year 0) amount constant. To
obtain a decreasing gradient, simply substitute a negative sign for the positive
sign in the formulas in row 9.

SECTION A.6 / STRUCTURED SPREADSHEETS 607
EXAMPLE A-3
Once the cash-ﬂow values are entered into the spreadsheet, ﬁnancial measures
of merit can be determined (see Figure A-7). The equivalent worth measures are
obtained with the following combination of functions:
PW: = NPV(i, range) + P0
AW: = PMT(i, N, −PW)
FW: = FV(i, N, −AW)
IRR: = IRR(range, i)
Here, P0 refers to the cash ﬂow at time 0, PW is the result of the NPV function
with P0 added, AW is the result of the PMT function, and range is the cash-ﬂow
range excluding the amount P0.
The NPV function is probably the most useful ﬁnancial function. It works
with any cash ﬂow; it is not restricted to be an annuity, as with PMT and FV,
and provides a unique result regardless of the number of sign changes. Once we
have the PW, we can obtain any other equivalent worth measure.
In the past, many ﬁrms avoided the IRR method in project justiﬁcation
because it is difﬁcult to compute by hand. With the spreadsheet, IRR is actually
easier to compute than PW. The value i is an initial estimate of the IRR in decimal
= NPV (B1, B5:B9) + B4
= PMT (B1, A9, –C11)
= FV (B1, A9, –C12)
= IRR (B4:B9, B1)

form. MARR is usually a good guess. For a unique answer, there must be only
a single change of sign in the cash ﬂow. The IRR function does not provide a
warning if multiple rates of return exist.

Excel Formula Summary
ABS(value)
Returns the absolute value of the argument.
AVERAGE(range)
Returns the average of the values speciﬁed in range.
CEILING(number, signiﬁcance)
Rounds the speciﬁed number up to the signiﬁcance speciﬁed. Signiﬁcance is
typically 1.
FV(i,N,A,{PW},type)
Returns the future worth amount at the end of period N for an annuity A,
beginning at the end of period 1. The interest rate is i per period. {PW} is
optional.
HLOOKUP(class life, table range, k)
This function returns a value from a speciﬁc location in a table. The location
is speciﬁed by values in the header row and the number of rows below the
header.
IF(condition, true, false)
Condition is a logical expression, containing a logical operator (<>, >, <,
>=, <=). If the result of the condition is true, the value or label in the true
argumentisreturned. Iftheresultisfalse, thevalueorlabelinthefalse argument
is returned.
IRR(range, guess)
Returns the IRR for cash ﬂows in the speciﬁed range. Recall that more than
one change of sign in the cash ﬂow may generate multiple rates of return! The
guess argument is a starting point used by the internal algorithm and is often
speciﬁed as the MARR.
ISERR(cell)
Computational errors, such as division by zero, display an error code in the cell
containing the error and any cells that reference that cell. If the cell contains
an error, this function returns a logical TRUE; otherwise, it returns a logical
FALSE.
MAX(range)
Returns the maximum value in the range. Text and logical results are ignored.

SECTION A.7 / EXCEL FORMULA SUMMARY
609
MIN(range)
Returns the minimum value in the range. Text and logical results are ignored.
NORMINV(number, mean; std dev)
Returns the inverse cumulative distribution for a normal distribution with the
speciﬁed mean and standard deviation.
NPV(i,range)
Computes present worth of any arbitrary cash ﬂows in the speciﬁed range.
Caution is required for handling the cash ﬂow (P0) at T = 0. Let
P_range = range containing the cash ﬂows at the end of periods 1, 2, . . . , N
F_range = range containing the cash ﬂows at the end of periods 0, 1, . . . , N
Then the PW can be determined using either formula:
PW = P0 + NPV(i, P_range)
or
PW = NPV(i, F_range)∗(1 + i)
PMT(i,N,P,{F},type)
Returns the annuity amount that is equivalent to P taken over N periods. {F}
is optional. Type = 1 denotes beginning of period cash ﬂows, type = 0 is end of
period. End of period cash ﬂows are assumed if type is blank.
PV(i,N,A,{F},type)
Returns the present worth amount of an annuity A, beginning at the end of
period 1 and continuing until the end of period N. The interest rate is i per
period. {F} is optional. Note that this function works only with an annuity,
while NPV works with any cash-ﬂow pattern.
RAND()
Returns a continuous uniform random variable on the interval (0, 1). Note that
the parentheses are required, but there is no argument.
ROUND(number, digits)
Rounds the speciﬁed value to the number of digits.
STDEV(range)
Calculates the sample standard deviation (divisor = n −1) for the values
speciﬁed in range.
SUM(range)
Returns the sum of the values in the cells of the range speciﬁed.
VDB(B, SVN, N, start, end, percent, no_switch)
Returns dk for the general declining balance depreciation method. The percent
argument is 2 for double declining balance, 1.5 for 150% declining balance,
and so on. If omitted, it is assumed to be 2 (200%). The start and end arguments
permit use of the half-year (and half month) conventions. To permit switching
to the straight-line method, set the switch argument to FALSE. Avalue of TRUE
for this argument disallows switching.

APPENDIX E
Standard Normal Distribution
The standard normal distribution is a normal (Gaussian) distribution with a mean
of 0 and a variance of 1. It is a continuous distribution with a range of −∞to +∞.
The tabled values denote the probability of observing a value from minus inﬁnity
to the z value indicated by the left column and top row. The z value is determined
by applying the following formula to the observed data:
z = (X −µ)
σ
Interested readers are referred to any introductory statistics textbook for an in-
depth discussion of the use of the standard normal distribution function.

4-V (a) For a 30-year loan:
A = $300,000 (A/P, 0.5%, 360) = $300,000 (0.0060) = $1,800 per month
For a 50-year loan:
A = $300,000 (A/P, 0.5%, 600) = $300,000 (0.0053) = $1,590 per month
The difference is $210 per month.
(b) 30-year: Total interest paid = $1,800 (360) −$300,000 = $348,000
50-year: Total interest paid = $1,590 (600) −$300,000 = $654,000
Difference = $306,000
4-W The future lump-sum equivalent cost of the membership is:

The manager is incorrect in his claim.
4-X Number of monthly deposits = (5 years)(12 months/yr) = 60

$418,548.72 −$364,126.69; i′/month = 0.9148%

5-A No. Ahigher MARR reduces the present worth of future cash inﬂows created
by savings (reductions) in annual operating costs. The initial investment (at
time 0) is unaffected, so higher MARRs reduce the price that a company
should be willing to pay for this equipment.
5-B One of many formulations:
PW(10%) = −$50,000 + ($20,000 −$5,000) (P/A, 10%, 5)
−$1,000 (P/G, 10%, 5)
+ $11,000 (F/A, 10%, 5) (P/F, 10% 10)
+ $35,000(P/F, 10%, 10),
so we ﬁnd that PW(10%) = $39,386, and this is a proﬁtable undertaking.
5-C Assume a monthly compounding frequency to match the monthly savings of
$31.25:
PW(1%) = $31.25 (P/A, 1%, 36)
= $31.25 (30.1075)
= $940.86
This is the amount you would pay now for a 760 FICO loan if your FICO
score is 660.
5-D Desired yield per quarter = 12%/4 = 3%; N = 4(10) = 40 quarters
VN = $10,000 (P/F, 3%, 40) + 0.02 ($10,000) (P/A, 3%, 40)

Not a good investment.
5-G AW(18%) = −$15,000 (A/P, 18%, 2) + $10,000 −$3,000

A good investment.
5-H Investment cost of new buses = 35 ($40,000 −$5,000) = $1,225,000
Annual fuel + maintenance = $144,000 −$10,000 = $134,000
EUAC(6%) = $1,225,000(A/P, 6%, 15) + $134,000 = $260,175
5-I PW = 0 = −$200,000 + ($100,000 −$64,000)(P/A, i′, 10)
i′ = 12.4% > MARR; project is justiﬁed.
5-J Letting A = $200 per month, we solve for the unknown interest rate (IRR) as
follows:
4[ $200(120) ] = $200 (F/A, i′ per month, 120 months)
480 = [(1 + i′)120 −1]/i′
Solving this, we ﬁnd that i′ = 1.98% per month. The annual effective IRR is
(1.0198)12 −1 = 0.2653. Thus, IRR = 26.53% per year −not a bad return!
5-K Find the IRR:
0 = −$200,000 (P/A, i′, 3) + $50,000 (P/F, i′, 4)
+ $250,000 (P/A, i′, 5)(P/F, i′, 4)
By trial and error, i′ = 17.65%, which is greater than the MARR. As a matter
of interest, the PW(15%) = $51,094. But the simple payback period is 7 years,
so the gamble in this ﬁrm is probably too great for a risk intolerant investor
(like most of us).
5-L Because the face value (what a bond is worth at maturity) of a bond and its
interest payout are ﬁxed, the trading price of a bond will increase as interest
rates go down. This is because people are willing to pay more money for a
bond to obtain the ﬁxed interest rate in a declining interest rate market. For
instance, if the bond pays 8% per year, people will pay more for the bond
when interest rates in the economy drop from, for example, 6% to 5% per
year.
Chapter 6
6-A (a) Acceptable alternatives are those having a PW(15%) ≥0.
Alt I: PW (15%) = −$100,000 + $15,200 (P/A, 15%, 12)
+ $10,000 (P/F, 15%, 12)
= −$15,738
Alt II: PW(15%) = −$152,000 + $31,900 (P/A, 15%, 12)
= $20,917

APPENDIX G / SOLUTIONS TO TRY YOUR SKILLS 655
Alt III: PW(15%) = −$184,000 + $35,900 (P/A, 15%, 12)
+ $15,000 (P/F, 15%, 12)
= $13,403
Alt IV: PW(15%) = −$220,000 + $41,500 (P/A, 15%, 12)
+ $20,000 (P/F, 15%, 12)
= $8,693
Alternative I is economically infeasible, and Alternative II should be
selected because it has the highest positive PW value.
(b) If total investment capital is limited to $200,000, Alternative II should be
selected since it is within the budget and is also economically feasible.
(c) Rule 1; the net annual revenues are present and vary among the
alternatives.
6-B 1 inch of insulation:
Investment cost = (1,000 feet)($0.60 per foot) = $600
Annual cost of heat lost = ($2 per ft per yr)(1,000 feet)(1 −0.88)
= $240 per year
AW(6%) = −$600 (A/P, 6%, 10) −$240 = −$321.54
2 inches of insulation:
Investment cost = (1,000 feet)($1.10 per foot) = $1,100
Annual cost of heat lost = ($2 per ft per yr)(1,000 feet)(1 −0.92)
= $160 per year
AW(6%) = −$1,100 (A/P, 6%, 10) −$160 = −$309.49
Two inches of insulation should be recommended.
6-C With a 20-year study period, we can compare the present worth of the two
alternatives.
Gas: PW(8%) = −$225,000 −$2,000 (P/A, 8%, 20)
−$5,000[1 −(P/F, 8%, 20) (F/P, 5%, 20)]

Geothermal: PW(8%) = −$200,000 −$10,000 (P/A, 8%, 20)
= −$200,000 −$10,000 (9.8181)
= −$298,181

APPENDIX G / SOLUTIONS TO TRY YOUR SKILLS
The lower cost (less negative PW) alternative is to select the geothermal
heating option.
6-D Let’s use the EUAC method.
EUACA(8%) = $30,000 (A/P, 8%, 20) + X + $7,500 = $10,557 + X
EUACB(8%) = $55,000 (A/P, 8%, 20) + X = $5,604.50 + X
EUACC(8%) = $180,000 (A/P, 8%, 20) + X −$1,500 = $16,842 + X
Because X is equal for all fuel types, select B as the most economical.
6-E List the alternatives in increasing order of initial cost: DN, B, D, A, C.
In general, we have P = A (P/A, i′, 80) which becomes i′ = A/P when the
MARR is 12% and N = 80 years, where i′ is the IRR of the project or the
incremental cash ﬂows. The incremental comparisons follow:
!(B−DN) = 8/52 = 0.154 (15.4%), so select B.
!(D−B) = 1/3 = 0.333 (33.3%), so select D.
!(A−D) = 1/7 = 0.143 (14.3%), so select A.
!(C−A) = 10/88 = 0.114 (11.4%), so keep A.
Therefore, we recommend Alternative A even though it does not have the
largest IRR or the largest !IRR.
6-F Examine ! (New Baghouse – New ESP):
Incremental investment = $147,500
Incremental annual expenses = $42,000 per year for 10 years
Therefore, by inspection, the extra investment required by the new baghouse
is producing extra annual expenses, so the new ESP should be recommended.
Double check:
PW(15%) for the new baghouse = −$1,719,671
PW(15%) for the new ESP = −$1,359,876
The economic advantage of the ESPmay not be sufﬁcient enough to overcome
its inability to meet certain design speciﬁcations under varying operating
conditions.
6-G The cash ﬂows for the difference between the two alternatives can be set equal
to zero to determine the IRR on the increment:
0 = −$400 + $400 (P/F, i′, 5) + $200 (P/F, i′, 10)
Solving yields i′ = 6.44% per year. This is greater than 5%, so the Sauer 45 is
the preferred choice.
6-H AW2cm(15%) = −$20,000 (A/P, 15%, 4) + $5,000 = −$2,006 per year
AW5cm(15%) = −$40,000 (A/P, 15%, 6) + $7,500 = −$3,068 per year
Therefore, the 2 cm thickness should be recommended.

APPENDIX G / SOLUTIONS TO TRY YOUR SKILLS 657
6-I CR5cm(15%) = $40,000 (A/P, 15%, 6) = $10,568
MV5cm after 4 years = $10,568 (P/A, 15%, 2) = $17,180
AW5cm(15%) = −$40,000 (A/P, 15%, 4) + $7,500 + $17,180 (A/F, 15%, 4)
= −$3,071
Still recommend 2 cm thickness.
6-J Compare the annual worth of the two inﬁnite series:
AWA(10%) = $1,000 + [$500/0.10](P/F, 10%, 10)(A/P, 10%, ∞) = $1,192.75
AWB(10%) = $1,200 + [$100/0.10](P/F, 10%, 10)(A/P, 10%, ∞) = $1,238.55
Select Trust B.
6-K Assume repeatability.
AWA(10%) = −$30,000(A/P, 10%, 5) −$450 −$6,000 = −$14,364
AWB(10%) = −$38,000(A/P, 10%, 4) −$600 −$4,000 = −$16,589
Recommend Proposal A, assuming a proposal must be chosen.
6-L Rank order: Gravity-fed (G), Vacuum-led (V)
The IRR of the gravity-fed exceeds 15%, so it is acceptable. We must next
consider the incremental difference, ! (V – G) as follows: 0 = −$13,400 +
$24,500(P/F, i′, 5). TheIRRonthisincrementis12.8%, sowerejectvacuum-led
and stick with gravity-fed as our choice.
6-M 15,000/5,000 = 3 oil changes / year × $30 / oil change = $90
15,000/3,000 = 5 oil changes / year × $30 / oil change = $150
PW(savings) = $60(P/A, 10%, 6) = $261
6-N Bond: FW = $10,000 with certainty (IRR = 5.922%)
CD: FW = $7,500(F/P, 6.25%, 5) = $7,500(1.3541) = $10,155.80 (IRR = 6.25%)
The CD is better, assuming comparable risk in both investments.
Chapter 7
7-A Under MACRS, the ADS might be preferred to the GDS in several cases. If
proﬁts are expected to be relatively low in the near future, but were going to
increase to a fairly constant level after that, the ADS would be a way to “save
up” depreciation for when it is needed later. In essence, income taxes would
be deferred until a later time when the ﬁrm is ﬁnancially better able to pay
them.
7-B t = 0.06 + 0.34(1 −0.06) = 0.3796, or 37.96%
t = 0.12 + 0.34(1 −0.12) = 0.4192, or 41.92%
7-C t = 0.5 + (1 −0.5)(0.39) = 0.4205 (effective income tax rate)

rate will cost (F/P, 4%, 10) = 1.4802 times its current cost. But health care
costs will increase to (F/P, 12%, 10) = 3.1058 times their current value. The
ratio of 3.1058 to 1.4802 is 2.10, which means that health care will cost 210%
more than an inﬂation-indexed service/commodity in 10 years.

Excel Formula Summary
ABS(value)
Returns the absolute value of the argument.
AVERAGE(range)
Returns the average of the values speciﬁed in range.
CEILING(number, signiﬁcance)
Rounds the speciﬁed number up to the signiﬁcance speciﬁed. Signiﬁcance is
typically 1.
FV(i,N,A,{PW},type)
Returns the future worth amount at the end of period N for an annuity A,
beginning at the end of period 1. The interest rate is i per period. {PW} is
optional.
HLOOKUP(class life, table range, k)
This function returns a value from a speciﬁc location in a table. The location
is speciﬁed by values in the header row and the number of rows below the

IF(condition, true, false)
Condition is a logical expression, containing a logical operator (<>, >, <,
>=, <=). If the result of the condition is true, the value or label in the true
argumentisreturned. Iftheresultisfalse, thevalueorlabelinthefalse argument
is returned.
IRR(range, guess)
Returns the IRR for cash ﬂows in the speciﬁed range. Recall that more than
one change of sign in the cash ﬂow may generate multiple rates of return! The
guess argument is a starting point used by the internal algorithm and is often
speciﬁed as the MARR.
ISERR(cell)
Computational errors, such as division by zero, display an error code in the cell
containing the error and any cells that reference that cell. If the cell contains
an error, this function returns a logical TRUE; otherwise, it returns a logical
FALSE.
MAX(range)
Returns the maximum value in the range. Text and logical results are ignored.
MIN(range)
Returns the minimum value in the range. Text and logical results are ignored.
NORMINV(number, mean; std dev)
Returns the inverse cumulative distribution for a normal distribution with the
speciﬁed mean and standard deviation.

NPV(i,range)
Computes present worth of any arbitrary cash ﬂows in the speciﬁed range.
Caution is required for handling the cash ﬂow (P0) at T = 0. Let
P_range = range containing the cash ﬂows at the end of periods 1, 2, . . . , N
F_range = range containing the cash ﬂows at the end of periods 0, 1, . . . , N
Then the PW can be determined using either formula:
PW = P0 + NPV(i, P_range)
or
PW = NPV(i, F_range)∗(1 + i)
PMT(i,N,P,{F},type)
Returns the annuity amount that is equivalent to P taken over N periods. {F}
is optional. Type = 1 denotes beginning of period cash ﬂows, type = 0 is end of
period. End of period cash ﬂows are assumed if type is blank.
PV(i,N,A,{F},type)
Returns the present worth amount of an annuity A, beginning at the end of
period 1 and continuing until the end of period N. The interest rate is i per
period. {F} is optional. Note that this function works only with an annuity,
while NPV works with any cash-ﬂow pattern.
RAND()
Returns a continuous uniform random variable on the interval (0, 1). Note that
the parentheses are required, but there is no argument.
ROUND(number, digits)
Rounds the speciﬁed value to the number of digits.
STDEV(range)
Calculates the sample standard deviation (divisor = n −1) for the values
speciﬁed in range.
SUM(range)
Returns the sum of the values in the cells of the range speciﬁed.
VDB(B, SVN, N, start, end, percent, no_switch)
Returns dk for the general declining balance depreciation method. The percent
argument is 2 for double declining balance, 1.5 for 150% declining balance,
and so on. If omitted, it is assumed to be 2 (200%). The start and end arguments
permit use of the half-year (and half month) conventions. To permit switching
to the straight-line method, set the switch argument to FALSE. Avalue of TRUE
for this argument disallows switching.
