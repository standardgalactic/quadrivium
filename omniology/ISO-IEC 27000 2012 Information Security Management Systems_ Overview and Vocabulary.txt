Foreword 
ISO (the International Organisation for Standardization) and IEC (the International Electrotechnical 
Commission) form the specialized system for worldwide standardization. National bodies that are members of 
ISO or IEC participate in the development of International Standards through technical committees 
established by the respective organisation to deal with particular fields of technical activity. ISO and IEC 
technical committees collaborate in fields of mutual interest. Other international organisations, governmental 
and non-governmental, in liaison with ISO and IEC, also take part in the work. In the field of information 
technology, ISO and IEC have established a joint technical committee, ISO/IEC JTC 1. 
International Standards are drafted in accordance with the rules given in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2. 
The main task of the joint technical committee is to prepare International Standards. Draft International 
Standards adopted by the joint technical committee are circulated to national bodies for voting. Publication as 
an International Standard requires approval by at least 75 % of the national bodies casting a vote. 
Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this document may be the subject of patent 
rights. ISO and IEC shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights. 
ISO/IEC 27000 was prepared by Joint Technical Committee ISO/IEC JTC 1, Information technology, 
Subcommittee SC 27, IT Security techniques. 
This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition (ISO/IEC 27000:2009).

0 Introduction 
0.1 Overview 
International Standards for management systems provide a model to follow in setting up and operating a 
management system. This model incorporates the features on which experts in the field have reached a 
consensus as being the international state of the art. ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 27 maintains an expert committee 
dedicated to the development of international management systems standards for information security, 
otherwise known as the Information Security Management System (ISMS) family of standards. 
Through the use of the ISMS family of standards, organisations can develop and implement a framework for 
managing the security of their information assets including financial information, intellectual property, and 
employee details, or information entrusted to them by customers or third parties. These standards can also be 
used to prepare for an independent assessment of their ISMS applied to the protection of information. 
0.2 ISMS family of standards 
The ISMS family of standards1) (see Clause 4) is intended to assist organisations of all types and sizes to 
implement and operate an ISMS and consists of the following International Standards, under the general title

communicating, consulting, establishing the context and identifying, analyzing, evaluating, treating, monitoring 
and reviewing risk (2.61) 
[ISO Guide 73:2009] 
NOTE  
ISO/IEC 27005 uses the term ‘process’ to describe risk management overall. The elements within the risk 
management process are termed ‘activities’ 
2.71 
risk treatment 
process (2.54) to modify risk (2.61) 
[ISO Guide 73:2009]

10 
© ISO/IEC 2012 – All rights reserved
 
 avoiding the risk by deciding not to start or continue with the activity that gives rise to the risk; 
 taking or increasing risk in order to pursue an opportunity; 
 removing the risk source; 
 changing the likelihood; 
 changing the consequences; 
 sharing the risk with another party or parties (including contracts and risk financing); and 
 retaining the risk by informed choice. 
NOTE 2  
Risk treatments that deal with negative consequences are sometimes referred to as “risk mitigation”, “risk 
elimination”, “risk prevention” and “risk reduction”. 
NOTE 3  
Risk treatment can create new risks or modify existing risks. 
2.72 
scale 
ordered set of values, continuous or discrete, or a set of categories to which the attribute (2.6) is mapped 
[ISO/IEC 15939:2007] 
NOTE 
The type of scale depends on the nature of the relationship between values on the scale. Four types of scale 
are commonly defined: 
 nominal: the measurement values are categorical; 
 ordinal: the measurement values are rankings; 
 interval: the measurement values have equal distances corresponding to equal quantities of the attribute; 
 ratio: the measurement values have equal distances corresponding to equal quantities of the attribute, 
where the value of zero corresponds to none of the attribute. 
These are just examples of the types of scale.

Information security management systems 
3.1 Introduction 
Organisations of all types and sizes: 
a) 
collect, process, store, and transmit information; 
b) 
recognise that information, and related processes, systems, networks and people are important assets for 
achieving organisation objectives; 
c) 
face a range of risks that may affect the functioning of assets; and 
d) 
address their  perceived risk exposure by implementing information security controls. 
All information held and processed by an organisation is subject to threats of attack, error, nature (for 
example, flood or fire), etc, and is subject to vulnerabilities inherent in its use. The term information security is 
generally based on information being considered as an asset which has a value requiring appropriate 
protection, for example, against the loss of availability, confidentiality and integrity. Enabling accurate and 
complete information to be available in a timely manner to those with an authorized need is a catalyst for 
business efficiency. 
Protecting information assets through defining, achieving, maintaining, and improving information security 
effectively is essential to enable an organisation to achieve its objectives, and maintain and enhance its legal 
compliance and image. These coordinated activities directing the implementation of suitable controls and 
treating unacceptable information security risks are generally known as elements of information security 
management. 
As information security risks and the effectiveness of controls change depending on shifting circumstances, 
organisations need to: 
a) 
monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of implemented controls and procedures; 

ISO/IEC 27000:2012(E) 
12 
© ISO/IEC 2012 – All rights reserved
 
b) 
identify emerging risks to be treated; and 
c) 
select, implement and improve appropriate controls as needed. 
To interrelate and coordinate such information security activities, each organisation needs to establish its 
policy and objectives for information security and achieve those objectives effectively by using a management 
system. 
3.2 What is an ISMS? 
3.2.1 Overview and principles 
An Information Security Management System (ISMS) consists of the policies, procedures, guidelines, and 
associated resources and activities, collectively managed by an organisation, in the pursuit of protecting its 
information assets. An ISMS is a systematic approach for establishing, implementing, operating, monitoring, 
reviewing, maintaining and improving organisation’s information security to achieve business objectives. It is 
based upon a risk assessment and the organisation's risk acceptance levels designed to effectively treat and 
manage risks. Analysing requirements for the protection of information assets and applying appropriate 
controls to ensure the protection of these information assets, as required, contributes to the successful 
implementation of an ISMS. The following fundamental principles also contribute to the successful 
implementation of an ISMS: 
a) 
awareness of the need for information security; 
b) 
assignment of responsibility for information security; 
c) 
incorporating management commitment and the interests of stakeholders; 
d) 
enhancing societal values; 
e) 
risk assessments determining appropriate controls to reach acceptable levels of risk; 
f) 
security incorporated as an essential element of information networks and systems; 
g) 
active prevention and detection of information security incidents; 
h) 
ensuring a comprehensive approach to information security management; and 
i) 
continual reassessment of information security and making of modifications as appropriate. 
3.2.2 Information 
Information is an asset that, like other important business assets, is essential to an organisation's business 
and consequently needs to be suitably protected. Information can be stored in many forms, including: digital 
form (e.g. data files stored on electronic or optical media), material form (e.g. on paper), as well as 
unrepresented information in the form of knowledge of the employees. Information may be transmitted by 
various means including: courier, electronic or verbal communication. Whatever form information takes, or the 
means by which the information is transmitted, it always needs appropriate protection. 
In many organisations information is dependent upon information and communications technology. This 
technology is often an essential element in the organisation and assists in facilitating the creation, processing, 
storing, transmitting, protection and destruction of information. 
3.2.3 Information security 
Information security includes three main dimensions: confidentiality, availability and integrity. Information 
security involves the application and management of appropriate security measures that involves 

ISO/IEC 27000:2012(E) 
© ISO/IEC 2012 – All rights reserved 
13
 
consideration of a wide range of threats, with the aim of ensuring sustained business success and continuity, 
and minimising impacts of information security incidents. 
Information security is achieved through the implementation of an applicable set of controls, selected through 
the chosen risk management process and managed using an ISMS, including policies, processes, 
procedures, organisational structures, software and hardware to protect the identified information assets. 
These controls need to be specified, implemented, monitored, reviewed and improved where necessary, to 
ensure that the specific information security and business objectives of the organisation are met. Relevant 
information security controls are expected to be seamlessly integrated with an organisation's business 
processes. 
3.2.4 Management 
Management involves activities to direct, control and continually improve the organisation within appropriate 
structures. Management activities include the act, manner, or practice of organizing, handling, directing, 
supervising, and controlling resources. Management structures extend from one person in a small 
organisation to management hierarchies consisting of many individuals in large organisations. 
In terms of an ISMS, management involves the supervision and making of decisions necessary to achieve 
business objectives through the protection of the organisation's information assets. Management of 
information security is expressed through the formulation and use of information security policies, procedures 
and guidelines, which are then applied throughout the organisation by all individuals associated with the 
organisation. 
NOTE 
The term “management” may sometimes refer to people (i.e. a person or group of people with authority and 
responsibility for the conduct and control of an organisation). The term “management” addressed in this clause is not in 
this sense. 
3.2.5 Management system 
A management system uses a framework of resources to achieve an organisation's objectives. The 
management system includes organisational structure, policies, planning activities, responsibilities, practices, 
procedures, processes and resources. 
In terms of information security, a management system allows an organisation to: 
a) 
satisfy the information security requirements of customers and other stakeholders; 
b) 
improve an organisation's plans and activities; 
c) 
meet the organisation's information security objectives; 
d) 
comply with regulations, legislation and industry mandates; and 
e) 
manage information assets in an organized way that facilitates continual improvement and adjustment to 
current organisational goals. 
3.3 Process approach 
Organisations need to identify and manage many activities in order to function effectively and efficiently. Any 
activity using resources needs to be managed to enable the transformation of inputs into outputs using a set 
of interrelated or interacting activities – this is also known as a process. The output from one process can 
directly form the input to another process and generally this transformation is carried out under planned and 
controlled conditions. The application of a system of processes within an organisation, together with the 
identification and interactions of these processes, and their management, can be referred to as a “process 
approach”. 

ISO/IEC 27000:2012(E) 
14 
© ISO/IEC 2012 – All rights reserved
 
The process approach for the ISMS presented in the ISMS family of standards is based on the operating 
principle adopted in ISO's management system standards commonly known as the Plan – Do – Check – Act 
(PDCA) process. 
a) 
Plan – establish objectives and make plans (analyze the organisation's situation, establish the overall 
objectives and set targets, and develop plans to achieve them); 
b) 
Do – implement plans (do what was planned to do); 
c) 
Check – measure results (measure/monitor the extent to which achievements meet planned objectives); 
and 
d) 
Act – correct and improve activities (learn from mistakes to improve activities to achieve better results). 
3.4 Why an ISMS is important 
Risks associated with an organisation's information assets need to be addressed. Achieving information 
security requires the management of risk, and encompasses risks from physical, human and technology 
related threats associated with all forms of information within or used by the organisation. 
The adoption of an ISMS is expected to be a strategic decision for an organisation and it is necessary that this 
decision is seamlessly integrated, scaled and updated in accordance with the needs of the organisation. 
The design and implementation of an organisation's ISMS is influenced by the needs and objectives of the 
organisation, security requirements, the business processes employed and the size and structure of the 
organisation. The design and operation of an ISMS needs to reflect the interests and information security 
requirements of all of the organisation's stakeholders including customers, suppliers, business partners, 
shareholders and other relevant third parties. 
In an interconnected world, information and related processes, systems, and networks constitute critical 
business assets. Organisations and their information systems and networks face security threats from a wide 
range of sources, including computer-assisted fraud, espionage, sabotage, vandalism, fire and flood. Damage 
to information systems and networks caused by malicious code, computer hacking, and denial of service 
attacks have become more common, more ambitious, and increasingly sophisticated. 
An ISMS is important to both public and private sector businesses. In any industry, an ISMS is an enabler that 
supports e-business and is essential for risk management activities. The interconnection of public and private 
networks and the sharing of information assets increases the difficulty of controlling access to and handling of 
information. In addition, the distribution of mobile storage devices containing information assets can weaken 
the effectiveness of traditional controls. When organisations adopt the ISMS family of standards the ability to 
apply consistent and mutually-recognisable information security principles can be demonstrated to business 
partners and other interested parties. 
Information security is not always taken into account in the design and development of information systems. 
Further, information security is often thought of as being a technical solution. However, the information 
security that can be achieved through technical means is limited, and may be ineffective without being 
supported by appropriate management and procedures within the context of an ISMS. Integrating security into 
an information system after the fact could be cumbersome and costly. An ISMS involves identifying which 
controls are in place and requires careful planning and attention to detail. As an example, access controls, 
which may be technical (logical), physical, administrative (managerial) or a combination, provide a means to 
ensure that access to information assets is authorized and restricted based on the business and information 
security requirements. 
The successful adoption of an ISMS is important to protect information assets allowing an organisation to: 
a) 
achieve greater assurance that its information assets are adequately protected against threats on a 
continual basis; 

ISO/IEC 27000:2012(E) 
© ISO/IEC 2012 – All rights reserved 
15
 
b) 
maintain a structured and comprehensive framework for identifying and assessing information security 
risks, selecting and applying applicable controls, and measuring and improving their effectiveness; 
c) 
continually improve its control environment; and 
d) 
effectively achieve legal and regulatory compliance. 
3.5 Establishing, monitoring, maintaining and improving an ISMS 
3.5.1 Overview 
An organisation needs to undertake the following steps in establishing, monitoring, maintaining and improving 
its ISMS: 
a) 
identify information assets and their associated information security requirements (see 3.5.2); 
b) 
assess information security risks (see 3.5.3) and treat information security risks (see 3.5.4); 
c) 
select and implement relevant controls to manage unacceptable risks (see 3.5.5); and 
d) 
monitor, maintain and improve the effectiveness of controls associated with the organisation's information 
assets (see 3.5.6). 
To ensure the ISMS is effectively protecting the organisation's information assets on an ongoing basis, it is 
necessary for steps (a) – (d) to be continuously repeated to identify changes in risks or in the organisation's 
strategies or business objectives. 
3.5.2 Identifying information security requirements 
Within the overall strategy and business objectives of the organisation, its size and geographical spread, 
information security requirements can be identified through an understanding of: 
a) 
identified information assets and their value; 
b) 
business needs for information processing, storage and communication; and 
c) 
legal, regulatory, and contractual requirements. 
Conducting a methodical assessment of the risks associated with the organisation's information assets will 
involve analyzing: threats to information assets; vulnerabilities to and the likelihood of a threat materializing to 
information assets; and the potential impact of any information security incident on information assets. The 
expenditure on relevant controls is expected to be proportionate to the perceived business impact of the risk 
materialising. 
3.5.3 Assessing information security risks 
Managing information security risks requires a suitable risk assessment and risk treatment method which may 
include an estimation of the costs and benefits, legal requirements, the concerns of stakeholders, and other 
inputs and variables as appropriate. 
Risk assessments should identify, quantify, and prioritize risks against criteria for risk acceptance and 
objectives relevant to the organisation. The results should guide and determine the appropriate management 
action and priorities for managing information security risks and for implementing controls selected to protect 
against these risks. 
Risk assessment should include the systematic approach of estimating the magnitude of risks (risk analysis) 
and the process of comparing the estimated risks against risk criteria to determine the significance of the risks 
(risk evaluation). 

ISO/IEC 27000:2012(E) 
16 
© ISO/IEC 2012 – All rights reserved
 
Risk assessments should be performed periodically to address changes in the information security 
requirements and in the risk situation, e.g. in the assets, threats, vulnerabilities, impacts, the risk evaluation, 
and when significant changes occur. These risk assessments should be undertaken in a methodical manner 
capable of producing comparable and reproducible results. 
The information security risk assessment should have a clearly defined scope in order to be effective and 
should include relationships with risk assessments in other areas, if appropriate. 
ISO/IEC 27005 provides information security risk management guidance, including advice on risk 
assessment, risk treatment, risk acceptance, risk reporting, risk monitoring and risk review.  Examples of risk 
assessment methodologies are included as well. 
3.5.4 Treating information security risks 
Before considering the treatment of a risk, the organisation should decide criteria for determining whether or 
not risks can be accepted. Risks may be accepted if, for example, it is assessed that the risk is low or that the 
cost of treatment is not cost-effective for the organisation. Such decisions should be recorded. 
For each of the risks identified following the risk assessment a risk treatment decision needs to be made. 
Possible options for risk treatment include: 
a) 
applying appropriate controls to reduce the risks; 
b) 
knowingly and objectively accepting risks, providing they clearly satisfy the organisation’s policy and 
criteria for risk acceptance; 
c) 
avoiding risks by not allowing actions that would cause the risks to occur; 
d) 
sharing the associated risks to other parties, e.g. insurers or suppliers. 
For those risks where the risk treatment decision has been to apply appropriate controls, these controls 
should be selected and implemented. 
3.5.5 Selecting and  implementing controls 
Once information security requirements have been identified (see 3.5.2), information security risks to the 
identified information assets have been determined and assessed (see 3.5.3) and decisions for the treatment 
of information security risks having been made (see 3.5.4), then selection and implementation of controls 
apply for risk reduction. 
Controls should ensure that risks are reduced to an acceptable level taking into account: 
a) 
requirements and constraints of national and international legislation and regulations; 
b) 
organisational objectives; 
c) 
operational requirements and constraints; 
d) 
cost of implementation and operation in relation to the risks being reduced, and remaining proportional to 
the organisation’s requirements and constraints; 
e) 
the need to balance the investment in implementation and operation of controls against the loss likely to 
result from information security incidents. 
 The controls specified in ISO/IEC 27002:2005 are acknowledged as best practices applicable to most 
organisations and readily tailored to accommodate organisations of various sizes and complexities. Other 
standards in the ISMS family of standards provide guidance on the selection and application of 
ISO/IEC 27002 controls for the information security management system. 
Information security controls should be considered at the systems and projects requirements specification and 
design stage. Failure to do so can result in additional costs and less effective solutions, and maybe, in the 
worst case, inability to achieve adequate security. Controls can be selected from ISO/IEC 27002 or from other 
control sets, or new controls can be designed to meet the specific needs of the organisation. It is necessary to 
recognize that some controls may not be applicable to every information system or environment, and might 
not be practicable for all organisations. 

ISO/IEC 27000:2012(E) 
© ISO/IEC 2012 – All rights reserved 
17
 
It should be kept in mind that no set of controls can achieve complete information security. Additional 
management actions should be implemented to monitor, evaluate and improve the efficiency and 
effectiveness of information security controls to support the organisation’s aims. 
The selection and implementation of controls should be documented within a statement of applicability to 
assist with compliance requirements. 
3.5.6 Monitor, maintain and improve the effectiveness of the ISMS 
An organisation needs to maintain and improve the ISMS through monitoring and assessing performance 
against organisational policies and objectives, and reporting the results to management for review. This ISMS 
review will check that the ISMS includes specified controls that are suitable to treat risks within the ISMS 
scope.  Furthermore, based on the records of these monitored areas, it will provide evidence of verification, 
and traceability of corrective, preventive and improvement actions. 
3.6 ISMS critical success factors 
A large number of factors are critical to the successful implementation of an ISMS to allow an organisation to 
meet its business objectives. Examples of critical success factors include: 
a) 
information security policy, objectives, and activities aligned with objectives; 
b) 
an approach and framework for designing, implementing, monitoring, maintaining, and improving 
information security consistent with the organisational culture; 
c) 
visible support and commitment from all levels of management, especially top management; 
d) 
an understanding of information asset protection requirements achieved through the application of 
information security risk management (see ISO/IEC 27005); 
e) 
an effective information security awareness, training and education programme, informing all employees 
and other relevant parties of their information security obligations set forth in the information security 
policies, standards etc., and motivating them to act accordingly; 
f) 
an effective information security incident management process; 
g) 
an effective business continuity management approach; and 
h) 
a measurement system used to evaluate performance in information security management and feedback 
suggestions for improvement. 
An ISMS increases the likelihood that an organisation will consistently achieve the critical success factors 
required to protect its information assets. 
3.7 Benefits of the ISMS family of standards 
The benefits of implementing an ISMS will primarily result from a reduction in information security risks (i.e. 
reducing the probability of, and/or impact caused by, information security incidents). Specifically, benefits 
realised for an organisation to achieve sustainable success from the adoption of the ISMS family of standards 
include: 
a) 
a structured manner supporting the process of specifying, implementing, operating and maintaining a 
comprehensive, cost-effective, value creating, integrated and aligned ISMS that meets the organisation's 
needs across different operations and sites; 
b) 
assistance for management in consistently managing and operating in a responsible manner their 
approach towards information security management, within the context of corporate risk management 
and governance, including educating and training business and system owners on the holistic 
management of information security; 

ISO/IEC 27000:2012(E) 
18 
© ISO/IEC 2012 – All rights reserved
 
c) 
promotion of globally-accepted good information security practices in a non-prescriptive manner, giving 
organisations the latitude to adopt and improve relevant controls that suit their specific circumstances and 
to maintain them in the face of internal and external changes; 
d) 
provision of a common language and conceptual basis for information security, making it easier to place 
confidence in business partners with a compliant ISMS, especially if they require certification against 
ISO/IEC 27001 by an accredited certification body; 
e) 
increase in stakeholder trust in the organisation; 
f) 
satisfying societal needs and expectations; and 
g) 
more effective economic management of information security investments.

4.4.8 ISO/IEC 27014 
Information technology — Security techniques — Governance of information security 
Scope: 
This International Standard will provide guidance on principles and processes for the 
governance of information security, by which organisations can evaluate, direct and monitor the management 
of information security. 
Purpose: 
Information security has become a key issue for organisations. Not only are there increasing 
regulatory requirements but also the failure of an organisation’s information security measures can have a 
direct impact on an organisation’s reputation. Therefore, governing bodies, as part of their governance 
responsibilities, are increasingly required to have oversight of information security to ensure the objectives of 
the organisation are achieved. 
4.4.9 ISO/IEC TR 27016 
Information technology — Security techniques — Information security management – Organisational 
economics 
Scope: 
This Technical Report will provide a methodology allowing organisations to better understand 
economically how to more accurately value their identified information assets, value the potential risks to 
those information assets, appreciate the value that information protection controls deliver to these information 
assets, and determine the optimum level of resources to be applied in securing these information assets. 
Purpose: 
This Technical Report will supplement the ISMS family of standards by overlaying an 
economics perspective in the protection of an organisation’s information assets in the context of the wider 
societal environment in which an organisation operates and providing guidance on how to apply organisational 
economics of information security through the use of models and examples.

Annex A 
(informative) 
 
Verbal forms for the expression of provisions 
Each of the ISMS family of standards documents do not in themselves impose an obligation upon anyone to 
follow them. However, such an obligation may be imposed, for example, by legislation or by a contract. In 
order to be able to claim conformity with a document, the user needs to be able to identify the requirements 
required to be satisfied. The user also needs to be able to distinguish these requirements from other 
recommendations where there is a certain freedom of choice. 
The following table clarifies how an ISMS family of standards document is to be interpreted in terms of its 
verbal expressions as being either requirements or recommendations. 
The table is based on the provisions of JTC1 Directives, Part 2, Rules for the structure and drafting of 
International Standards, Annex H 
INDICATION 
EXPLANATION 
Requirement 
the terms “shall” and “shall not” indicate requirements strictly to be followed in order 
to conform to the document and from which no deviation is permitted 
Recommendation 
the terms “should” and “should not” indicate that among several possibilities one is 
recommended as particularly suitable, without mentioning or excluding others, or 
that a certain course of action is preferred but not necessarily required, or that (in the 
negative form) a certain possibility or course of action is deprecated but not 
prohibited 
Permission 
the term “may” and “need not” indicates a course of action permissible within the 
limits of the document 
Possibility 
the term “can” and “cannot” indicates a possibility of something occurring
