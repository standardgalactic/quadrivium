Acknowledgments
Thank you to CA Technologies and to Apress for publishing this book. I hope 
it will be a welcome, if unexpected, addition into this technology company’s 
repertoire. Special thanks to Apress’s Rita Fernando Kim for her infinite 
patience and support.
Thank you to my technical editors and reviewers, especially Amy Willoughby-
Burle for her candid, caring and helpful feedback.
Thank you to my talented nephew, John Michael Borza, who illustrated most 
of this book. He is a gifted artist and I am so happy that we could collaborate 
on this project.
Thank you to girls everywhere who face challenges and persist to embrace 
science, technology, engineering and math along with fashion, art and design 
and all the rest of their hearts’ desires. My hope is that you will create the 
world you want to inherit!
Finally, thank you to my husband, Scott Perlowin, and to my three sons, AJ, 
Christopher and Vincent, who have tolerated not just my rants on this subject 
but also many evening and weekend absences to allow me to write this book.

Introduction
The inspiration for this story came to me when researching a blog, I discov-
ered that girls as young as third and fourth graders were opting out of STEM 
(Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) tracks. That means that at nine 
years old, girls are closing career doors they may not even know exist yet. 
The choices they make have nothing to do with skills or ability but rather are 
driven by unconsious biases and false assumptions. As we hear more about 
the dearth of women in tech fields, it’s easy to connect the dots. We cannot 
wait to address this in college or even in high school, as foundational skills for 
STEM need to be built much earlier. This is a problem that has to be solved 
in elementary and middle school. Girls need to be encouraged to engage in 
STEM subjects as early as possible, not just to fill the pipeline but also to drive 
inclusion and diversity.
This book is written for middle-schoolers facing the pressures of growing 
up in a hyperconnected, technology-driven universe where traditional social, 
educational and personal pressures also persist.
This book shows how one girl stuggles with social pressures, varied academic 
interests and a deep desire to help her friends, family and the world she  
lives in to be better. She embraces her inner geek, her artistic flair and her 
heart’s true desires to find her way. I hope it inspires more girls to pursue 
their interests in math AND the arts and to grow their talents to help make 
our world a better and brighter place for all.

104 Driscoll 
Avenue
The smoky smell of cooking bacon drifted down the hallway of 104 Driscoll 
Avenue, up three stairs, around a bend, and through Missy’s barely cracked 
door to tickle her nose. Twelve feet plus three feet plus one and a half feet 
equals the distance the scent of bacon just traveled from the kitchen. Missy 
Maker’s brain calculated, as her mouth watered, before she was even fully 
awake. She let the smell of bacon pull her up into a sitting position and then 
lead her down the stairs and into her family’s kitchen. If G-ma cooks the 
whole pound . . . Fifteen slices in one pound of bacon divided by three people, 
means at least five slices for me.
G-ma stood with her back toward the counter. She was busy working over 
the stove, a spatula in one hand and an oversize mug, filled with black coffee 
and featuring a photo of Missy and her sister, Molly, both smiling widely, in the 
other. G-ma moved expertly between the frying pan and griddle, her bright 
blue eyes in stark contrast to her black and silver hair. Missy imagined purple 
streaks atop G-ma’s spiky ‘do.

Bubbles exploded from the tops of the perfect pancake spheres. Missy 
thought of her favorite ratio—the diameter of a circle to the circumference of 
a circle—and how it resulted in the irrational and lovely number called pi. In a 
haze of bacon smoke, the elegant equation for the area of a circle, pi r-squared, 
seemed to float about the stove as G-ma adroitly flipped each pancake over. 
Just as it was done to crispy perfection, G-ma swiftly removed the bacon strips 
from the frying pan to a paper-towel covered plate.
“Good morning! Miss Melissa Merry Maker!” G-ma sang out noticing Missy 
watching her prepare breakfast. Then, as if reading Missy’s thoughts, G-ma 
said, “I cooked only six slices of bacon, dearie. And six pancakes. That’s two 
apiece of each.” G-ma winked at Missy who sidled up to the kitchen peninsula 
and sat on a bar stool.

As Missy watched her grandmother cooking breakfast, she felt an odd weight 
on her head. She raised her hand and touched her hair. She felt at once that she 
had forgotten to take down her ponytail before going to bed. Now, it sat askew, 
leaning to the right and creating a heavy sensation. Missy had unruly frizzy, blond 
hair. It was long, and Missy found the easiest way to manage it was to wrangle it 
into a bunch and to tie it tightly atop her head in various positions.
Missy pictured her head as a globe and overlaid a compass in her mind’s eye. 
Zero degrees at the top; hair slipped to about 70 degrees. With determination, she 
grabbed her ponytail, quickly divided the hair between two hands and pulled 
and wrangled it up to the North Pole. Then Missy gave her hair a sharp tug 
pulling each handful in opposite directions to lock in the elastic band. Satisfied 
for now, Missy looked around the kitchen feeling more awake.
Missy’s pet cat, Pi, arched its back and weaved in and out of the legs on Missy’s 
stool. As a calico, Missy thought Pi was the most fashionable cat she knew! 
His brown and black striped fur and green eyes made him ready for any formal 
event; however, it was the perfectly round patch of black over white fur that 
encircled his left eye for which she had named him. Missy reached down to 
stroke Pi’s fur.
“What’s the occasion, G-ma?” Missy asked sitting back up and resting her chin 
in her hands.

G-ma plated breakfast for Missy and herself then set down her spatula and 
delivered the plates to the peninsula. Then she walked to the refrigerator. 
She took out the maple syrup and butter, then said, “We’re celebrating! TGIF: 
Thank G-ma, it’s Friday!”
Missy laughed. Eighteen days of sixth grade down, one hundred and sixty-two left.
“Missy!” Mr. Maker called from the hall toward Missy’s room.
“In here, Dad,” Missy called back, “with G-ma! Breakfast is ready.”
Mr. Maker walked into the kitchen and greeted his family. He was dressed as 
usual wearing a white button-down shirt with a colorful bow tie. Today it was 
green with yellow polka dots. He also wore his so-called dress-up jeans with 
black loafers. His black-rimmed glasses dangled precariously from his shirt 
pocket. “Anyone seen my glasses?” he asked.
“Dad,” Missy said, pointing, “they’re hanging from your pocket!” Pi watched the 
exchange carefully and followed Missy’s hand to stare up at Mr. Maker, too. He 
seemed just as incredulous as Missy that Mr. Maker could not find his glasses.
Mr. Maker patted his pocket. Reassured, he asked, “Did you sign up for any 
clubs last night?” He knew Missy had attended the Cherry Hill Academic Prep 
School’s annual club fair with her best friend AJ, but they hadn’t yet talked 
about it. “I heard from Ms. Jameson that there’s a new math club this year 
and if they have enough students, they can compete in the Math Olympics,”  
Mr. Maker explained.

Ms. Jameson was Missy’s math teacher, her neighbor, and her father’s childhood 
friend. Forty-two minus twelve equals the length of their friendship. Sometimes it 
was awkward to have a teacher who your father knew so well. Ms. Jameson 
was the club advisor and had mentioned the math club to Missy a few times. 
Her teacher had really tried hard to recruit Missy and her friends to join at 
the club fair. Now, it seemed Ms. Jameson had also told her dad about it too.
“I signed up for the fashion club with AJ,” Missy responded.
G-ma poured steaming black coffee into a travel mug, screwed on the lid, and 
placed it on the edge of the counter for Mr. Maker. Then she plated the last of 
the pancakes and bacon and handed it to him.
Mr. Maker sipped his coffee and set the plate down next to Missy’s. He raised 
his eyebrows at Missy who was watching him closely.
“Ha!” she said trying to change the subject away from joining the math club. 
“You drink too much coffee!”
“Well, I think you’d be a great addition to the math club,” Mr. Maker joked. “You 
see what I did there? Math club? Addition?!” He laughed and Missy rolled her 
eyes. “Think about it, kiddo,” he said. ”You’re great at math and the team could 
use your skills.”
“Sure, Dad,” Missy said, knowing that she would never join the math club. 
It was bad enough she had a brain that automatically invented math stories 
about everything she looked at! No way did she want her friends to know 
what a geek she really was. This year, she would shed her childhood nickname, 
“Missy-Math-Maker,” and she would focus on girl stuff. The fashion club was 
just the ticket! She loved fashion and all the creative possibilities and she knew 
it would be time-consuming, maybe too time-consuming to do anything else!

Chapter 1 | 104 Driscoll Avenue

Mr. Maker took a gulp of his coffee then looked at his watch. He put his cup 
down and grabbed a napkin from the napkin holder on the peninsula. He 
placed one pancake on it; he snapped his bacon into four pieces and added 
that to the pancake, he topped that with a pat of butter and a drop of syrup, 
and finally the other pancake; then he rolled his pancake sandwich inside the 
napkin, swapped it with his glasses in his shirt pocket and grabbed his keys 
from the counter. He kissed Missy on the forehead before picking up his mug 
again.
“I want to hear more about this fashion club, kiddo. Have a gee-are-eight day!” 
he said tugging Missy’s ponytail. “See what I did there?” he winked and blew a 
kiss across the kitchen to G-ma. “Early meeting. I’m off!”
G-ma returned the kiss by air mail then smiled at Missy. “Let’s finish up, ­dearie,” 
she said.
Missy cut her pancakes into quarters then eighths, and calculated how many 
bite-sized pieces she’d just made. One bite is one-sixteenth of my pancakes. She 
poured maple syrup over her whole plate drenching her pancake pieces and 
bacon slices. “Did Molly call yet?” she asked G-ma with a mouthful of food.
“Swallow before speaking, dearie. I was just about to check in with her,” G-ma 
said reaching for the kitchen computer keyboard. Just as she clicked the enter 
key, she heard the familiar dong of a video call coming through.
“Molly!” Missy shouted and positioned herself in front of the screen.
“Good morning Miss Molly May Maker!” said G-ma, using a napkin to touch 
the screen to peck Molly’s cheek as if she were kissing her. “Smooch!” she said.
“Hey, G-ma! Hey, Missy! Did Dad leave?” Molly asked.
“You just missed him,” G-ma said.

“Bummer. I wanted to share my news, but I’ll send him an email later,” Molly 
said. “You won’t believe it! I won a scholarship to go to the Grace Hopper 
Celebration of Women in Computing!”
Missy wrinkled her nose and peered at her sister through the screen with 
a confused look on her face. She knew Grace Hopper had been an admiral 
in the U.S. Navy and an early computer scientist, but why was she having a 
celebration? “Is it a party?” Missy asked, “Can I come too?”
Molly had been telling G-ma about the program. “It’s not a party. It’s a 
conference where thousands of women and men get together and talk about 
technology! I’m so excited. I’ll be counting down the days!”
“That’s wonderful, Molly! We are so proud of you!” G-ma said. “Before I retired, 
I attended a few Grace Hopper events myself! It’s a great place to connect 
and network with folks from a variety of technology areas,” G-ma told Molly.
“And maybe I can land a summer internship,” Molly added.
G-ma and Molly chatted while Missy finished her breakfast. “Love you, Miss,” 
Molly shouted to Missy as she ended the call. “Let’s catch up soon.”
Missy missed having her sister at home. Ten weeks till Molly comes home for 
break is seventy days or . . .
Stop! Missy interrupted her thoughts. For a girl who was trying not to be a 
geek, the message sure hadn’t made it to her brain. Missy rinsed her plate in 
the sink and loaded it into the dishwasher along with her fork and knife. Her 
mind was racing. How was she ever going to recreate her image as a regular 
girl if she couldn’t even control her own thinking?
Pi pranced to the dishwasher and gave it a sniff. “Ready for breakfast, Pi?” 
Missy asked. “Tuna or salmon?” Pi wove his way through Missy’s legs as Missy 
got out the can opener and pulled out a can of cat food from the cupboards 
above. Then she reached down and picked up Pi’s dish. She quickly rinsed and 
dried it and then refilled it. She poured fresh water into his water bowl while 
Pi actively ignored her. With the bowls filled and replaced in their familiar 
location, Pi swished his tail and tucked into his own breakfast.
“Fifteen minutes till the bus comes,” G-ma reminded Missy. Missy finished 
feeding Pi and washed her hands in the kitchen sink.
Fifteen divided by brushing teeth and dressing and walking to the corner to get the 
bus equals three minutes to brush, two minutes to walk, which leaves ten minutes 
to dress. Missy sprinted to the hallway bathroom and brushed her teeth. She 
ran up the stairs to her room and threw open the doors to her closet. Missy 
checked her smartphone calendar. “Friday is fun-in-the-sun day,” the calendar 
reminded her.

Chapter 1 | 104 Driscoll Avenue

Missy and her best friend Andrea Jane Dupre, better known as “AJ,” had 
sketched out a fashion calendar for every school day. They had sat down on 
Missy’s bedroom floor and mapped out fashion themes for the first marking 
period of middle school. Each week had a general theme and every Friday had 
a specific outfit idea. They typed it all up and posted it online to share with 
their friends.
As Missy rushed to get ready, she pulled out denim shorts, which at one 
time had been her favorite jeans. When she had grown two inches over the 
summer, G-ma had insisted they go into the donations pile. On a lark, Missy 
cut them off at the knees and frayed the bottom two inches. Now her favorite 
jeans were her favorite shorts! Missy added a teal t-shirt bejeweled with a 
sparkly giant M on the front. Next, from her dresser drawer, she took out 
two knee socks: one black and white striped and one teal with yellow stars.

Shorts plus top plus sock plus coordinating sock equals one rocking outfit! Missy 
dressed quickly and stuffed her feet into her favorite black tennis shoes artfully 
splattered with reflective pink and orange paint.
She stopped by the full-length mirror in the corner of her room, re-tied her 
ponytail and put on a pair of teal and glitter cat-eye sunglasses, then she 
smiled, posed and snapped a selfie. She posted the photo with the hashtags 
OOTD (Outfit of the Day) and FITSD (Fun-in-the-Sun Day). Satisfied with her 
look, Missy headed out to catch her bus, shouting “Bye, G-ma,” as she pushed 
through the spring-loaded front door that slammed shut behind her while she 
scanned her SocialMe feeds to see who else had posted an OOTD.
MATH HACK: WHAT IS PI?
Pi is an irrational number represented by this symbol from the Greek alphabet:
To calculate pi, you simply divide the circumference of a circle by its diameter. This 
is also called a ratio. What’s so awesome about pi is that it never changes. No matter 
how large or how small the circle, pi is always the same! Try it for yourself! You’ll be 
amazed.
Here’s a trick to help you remember the first digits in pi. Just count the number of 
letters in each of the words in this phrase: May I have a large container of coffee?
When you calculate pi, you will also see that the numbers never repeat or create a 
pattern. Many people round it down to just the first two decimal places. However, this 
is pi to its first 100 decimal places:

Codes and Crises
Missy saw two things as soon as she rounded the corner of the Sixth 
Grade Hall at Cherry Hill Academic Prep School or “CHAPS” as it was 
fondly called. CHAPS was more than just a middle school. It was an entire 
school campus made of four large buildings including the elementary school 
or The Lower School and the high school or The Upper School plus an 
administration building. CHAPS had a reputation, at least among parents, 
for having strong academics and a great STEM program. STEM stands for 
science, technology, engineering and math. In her six years in attendance, 
Missy had come to feel that this was not really the case. In her experience, 
all the students seemed to care about were sports and popularity; two 
things she knew nothing about! The CHAPS schools shared a set of offices, 
a gymnasium, an auditorium, and a cafeteria, which were all housed in 
the Gates Admin Building, named for a famous and wealthy CHAPS alum, 
not Bill Gates, though that was one of many school myths that circulated 
every year. The campus included several sports fields and green areas, and 
one big, inconvenient, disruptive and unfair rule: no cell phones during 
school hours. That meant that all cell phones remained locked in lockers 
or switched off in backpacks all day, every day, no exceptions. Even if they 
were allowed, as soon as you made it past the main parking area, all signals 
disappeared and connections dropped. The whole CHAPS campus seemed 
to be in a bubble of bad reception.

Chapter 2 | Codes and Crises

As Missy got closer to her locker, the first thing she noticed was a giant 
sign that ran the length of the wall: “RED?CE. ?EUSE. RECYCLE. WHAT’S 
MISSING? U R!”
That brought a smile to Missy’s face. She liked codes and puzzles, and that was 
an easy one! Her smile quickly turned into a pucker when she noticed the 
second thing.
Missy scrunched her eyebrows and pressed her lips together in concern. The 
neon green sticky note glittered from the center of her locker. She knew that 
could mean only one thing—an AJ Dupre crisis!
AJ and Missy had known each other since the first grade in CHAPS, when they 
met in Mrs. Works’ class and sat next to each other. AJ and her family had 
moved from Pennsylvania to New Jersey when AJ’s mom had taken a new job 
at a pharmaceutical company.

Having a love of puzzles and codes, the two developed many secret languages 
and various ciphers during elementary school. Missy rarely had occasion to 
use any of them; meanwhile, AJ had a knack for uncovering urgent scenarios 
and specific cases to employ their special language.
Missy speed-walked down the hall and peeled the note off her locker door. 
She looked at the notation and decoded the message.
H2O 4A 911! –AJ:(
Missy quickly translated: AJ has an emergency, and she’s not happy. Meet by the 
water fountain near the Discovery Lab (which took up rooms 4A, 4B and 4C).
Missy was experienced with AJ’s emergencies. They ranged from what Missy 
thought of as truly urgent, like forgetting a homework assignment or to study 
for a quiz, to the frivolous such as needing to share news about a friend or 
an upcoming event, to a fashion faux pas like leaving the house dressed for 
the wrong day. Whatever the crisis, as AJ’s best friend, Missy always tried to 
help. Last year, Missy managed to tutor AJ on a whole math chapter in the ten 
minutes before class began; and just last week, she had swapped sweaters and 
one sock with AJ and managed to improve both their looks. Whatever the 
crisis, AJ and Missy could find a workable solution together.

Chapter 2 | Codes and Crises
14
When Missy arrived at the water fountain, AJ was surrounded by a swarm 
including Morgan, Mahdavi, Danny and Kate. Missy calculated the severity of 
the crisis based on the number of people being consulted. Five heads to solve 
one problem. This must be really serious, Missy thought.
As Missy approached the huddle, AJ’s head popped up. AJ was the tallest girl 
in the sixth grade. As a soccer player and runner, she was lean but not willowy, 
with a mop of long, red curly hair that she tamed back with headbands and 
elastics in elaborate configurations.
“You’re here!” AJ reached out her arm and pulled Missy into the huddle. 
“Great! We need you!”
Missy was relieved to see AJ had remembered #FITSD. AJ’s rhinestone-
studded neon shades sat upon her head like a princess crown and matched 
her bejeweled ballet flats perfectly. “Hey guys,” Missy whispered, greeting the 
others. “AJ, what’s the crisis?”
AJ beamed, “You cracked my message?”
“I did. What’s going on?” Missy asked.
AJ peeked above the huddle and scanned the hall before speaking. Then she 
ducked down and in a hushed voice she started her story, “I was just telling 
the girls and Danny . . .” AJ’s voice trailed off, as a teacher approached the 
water fountain and took a sip.
“You won’t believe it! The fashion club has its first competition in a mere two 
weeks!”
The crowd gasped.
“Shucks!” Danny said. Missy noticed that Danny had embraced #FITSD too. 
He wore aviator sun glasses and had somehow painted the tip of his nose 
white, which made Missy smile.
“Seriously?!” Kate interjected. In her crouched position, Missy could not see 
the whole of her outfit, but she knew it would be a replica of the school’s 
old uniform, which had not been enforced since the second grade. “I knew it 
would be soon, but gosh!” Kate said.
“We have to get organized! I’ll die if we fail!” AJ said dramatically.
“How can we possibly get our looks together so quickly?” Morgan asked. 
Morgan was dressed neatly, as was her usual style. Like Kate, Morgan wore 
a tan skirt and a blue golf shirt, but Morgan’s nod to #FITSD was a small 
sunburst pin attached to the collar of her white cardigan.
“OMG! Can we make it work?” Mahdavi asked.

Missy looked at the faces of the people huddled around; each was stunned 
silent. Her mind was spinning as she calculated the number of days and hours 
of free time they each would have between now and the competition.
“We’ve got time!” Missy shouted arriving at her conclusion. Missy startled the 
others and caught the eye of Mrs. Towers, the gym teacher, heading down the 
hallway toward them.
“Eight minutes until the bell, kids,” Mrs. Towers said tapping her watch as she 
passed by them. Mrs. Towers always wore workout gear in school. Every day 
she wore the same uniform of a gray t-shirt sporting the CHAPS Knights team 
logo with black running pants and black trainers. She kept her long, blond hair 
pulled back into a low ponytail. Missy imagined Mrs. Towers, who stood at 
least six feet tall and was rail thin, could have been a beautiful fashion model 
with her hair and make-up done up and wearing the right clothes.
Doesn’t she get bored wearing the same dull clothes every day? Missy 
wondered to herself, as she watched Mrs. Towers turn the corner. Then Missy 
ducked her head back into the huddle.
“Really? You think we can get enough work done in such a short time,” AJ 
whispered to Missy.
Morgan spoke up, “Well, at least we have some weekends. I bet we can put 
something together in time.”
They all nodded, regaining their confidence. Missy also reassured the group, 
“By my calculations, we’ve got plenty of time!”
“Our first official fashion club meeting is Monday,” Kate said, “but I’m sure we 
can make a plan and work over the weekend to be ready by the competition.”

“Okay,” Missy said. “Look at us!” Missy spun around and then pointed to 
Danny’s shades and Mahdavi’s colorful scarf. Danny snapped his fingers in a zee 
configuration to reinforce Missy’s statement. “We are Fashion Forward —all 
the way!” Missy said and high-fived with AJ, then Danny.
“Okay! AJ said, relieved her crisis had been managed. “Let’s meet in the 
cafeteria at lunchtime and figure out what we need to do next.”
“Great!” Missy and Morgan said in unison. “JINX!” they both sang out just as 
the bell rang.
Eleven-forty-eight. Twelve minutes to the lunch bell, Missy calculated. The morning 
seemed to drag on. Even while Ms. Jameson taught a lesson on calculating 
ratios, one of Missy’s favorite topics, Missy found it hard to concentrate. Her 
mind kept drifting to visions of the fashion club’s first fashion competition. She 
pictured Ms. Jameson wearing a high-tech gown that lit up when she walked and 
gestured toward the whiteboard. Ms. Jameson was generally all buttoned-up, 
preferring to wear dark colored pantsuits or skirts and coordinating blouses. 
Ms. Jameson was anything but flashy.
“Missy?” Ms. Jameson called on her. “Missy, can you answer?”
“Uh. What?” Missy said startled. “I mean, excuse me. I didn’t follow the 
question.”
Ms. Jameson raised one eyebrow at Missy, and then called on an eager James 
Kim to answer the question. “The answer is one-twenty-fourth,” said James 
confidently sneering at Missy.
“Of course it is,” Missy scolded herself under her breath for not paying 
attention. She wrote out the equation in her math notebook. She listened 
closely as Ms. Jameson dictated the class’s homework, then carefully packed 
up her planner and notebook just as the lunch bell rang.
When Missy stood up to leave, Ms. Jameson motioned for Missy to come to 
her desk. Missy thought for sure she was about to get a lecture on daydreaming 
in class. Instead, Ms. Jameson said, “I hope you’re planning to come to the math 
club meeting after school on Monday, Missy! We could really use your skills 
on the team.”

“Oh,” Missy said, “I’m still thinking about it.” Missy didn’t want to disappoint 
Ms. Jameson, but there was no way she would be joining math club. Missy was 
certain that would permanently tag her as a super geek. Missy fidgeted with 
her pack, said goodbye and slipped out of the room.
She scrambled through the crowded hallway dodging people making their 
way back to their lockers in order to get to the cafeteria as quickly as she 
could without breaking the school’s no-running-in-the-halls rule. The more 
she thought about it, the happier she was. Math club would be impossible to 
attend because she committed to the fashion club and they met at the same 
time. That was her out—a scheduling conflict! Missy was relieved that she 
now had a great excuse.
When she arrived, the line for hot lunch at the cafeteria counter already 
wound its way back and around the turnstile. So Missy opted for a cold lunch 
and picked up a pre-made sandwich and a bag of fruit crisps. She swiped her 
cafeteria card at the register and headed toward the table where she could 
see the others were already gathering.
Morgan caught up to her and touched her arm to get her attention. “Hey, 
Miss! I was just talking to Ms. Jameson. I think I’m going to go to the math 
club meeting on Monday, and split my time so I can also go to the fashion club 
meeting. You wanna join me?”
“What?” Missy asked. “Uh. No. I don’t think so,” she stammered suddenly 
feeling panicked that her great excuse might not be so great after all.
The girls made their way around the maze of cafeteria tables and settled at 
the one that Danny had reserved with his backpack, both of his shoes and his 
sweatshirt. Missy and Morgan sat on the long bench opposite Danny, AJ and 
Mahdavi who were already seated at the table. Missy pinched her nose and 
picked up one of Danny’s shoes by the laces. She passed it across the table to 
him. “Thanks for saving us seats,” she said in a nasally voice.
“Sure thang, y’all. It was my pleasure,” Danny said with a southern accent that 
always made Missy smile. Danny started at CHAPS in sixth grade. His family 
had moved from South Carolina where he had been home-schooled. He was 
tall for his age with a mop of dark brown hair cut fashionably floppy, copying 
all the current teen icons. He had tested up a year. So, even though he was 
barely eleven, Danny had been placed into sixth grade. Danny seemed to love 
CHAPS and all his classes. Missy liked how he wanted to meet everyone and 
try everything. When Missy had asked Danny about his accent, he exclaimed, 
“That’s no accent. That’s just southern charm.”
AJ started speed-talking, which she did whenever she was excited. Missy could 
tell that no one was following her.
“AJ. AJ,” Missy spoke up. “Slow down. Let’s go back to the beginning.”

Chapter 2 | Codes and Crises

AJ took a breath and started speaking normally again. “Okay. This is what 
we know,” AJ glanced at her smartphone hidden on her lap under the table 
where she had input her intel, “We have exactly ten and one-half days to get 
organized and design and create three to five separate looks.” As she spoke, 
AJ’s words sped up and merged together. Missy gave her a slow-down signal 
with her hands.
“Right,” said Morgan. “And the competition category is ‘True to You’ according 
to Mrs. Frisch, our fashion club mentor who happens to be my homeroom 
teacher.”
Kate slid onto the bench, knocking off Danny’s remaining shoe. She used her 
foot to push it across the floor to Danny’s side of the table. “I found out that 
we can work as a group or in pairs. I read the rules on the library computer 
and that was clearly stated.”
“That makes a lot of sense,” Missy said. “Since there are six of us here, we can 
work in teams of two, so we will have at least three looks, and maybe more if 
there are others in the club who we don’t know yet.”
Danny scratched his head. “Let’s pair up then.”
AJ grabbed Missy’s hand. Kate nodded to Morgan from the end of the table.
“Okay Mahdavi! We’ve got this, girl,” Danny said and flicked the edge of her 
scarf in the air.
With the teams decided, Danny asked, “I’m just wondering . . . where do we 
get our supplies? Like material and zippers. You know, buttons and notions 
and et ceteras?”
“OMG!” AJ put her head on the table. “I hadn’t even thought of that!”
Missy felt a surge of energy that pumped from her toes to her head. “I know!” 
she shouted pointing at the sign in the cafeteria. It was the twin to the sign 
she’d seen earlier that morning above the lockers.
AJ raised her head and looked at Missy, “What?!”
They all swiveled in their seats following Missy’s gaze to read the sign. Mahdavi 
giggled. “That’s cute, but I don’t get it. How does ‘er’ answer the question?”
“Not ‘er,’ YOU ARE,” Danny said. “Get it? The letters U and R are cut out of 
the words Reduce and Reuse?”
“Hah!” Mahdavi laughed. “That’s hilarious. I guess they want us to recycle 
more.”
“Exactly!” Missy said. “Look at my OOTD.” Missy stood up and spun around 
for the second time that day. “It’s completely made up of upcycled clothes! 
These shorts were my old jeans that got too short for me as pants. This shirt 
was a plain boring t-shirt. And, I totally customized these kicks,” she said 
standing on one leg and showing off her painted sneakers.

“Wow!” said Danny. “That’s a great idea! I bet we all have clothes that don’t 
fit or hand-me-downs that need updating or other items that could just use 
some PIZZAZZ!”
“You Are right!” said Morgan, exaggerating a wink.
Missy got the joke right away and repeated, “U R—no you are!” and they all 
laughed.
“I’ll have to see,” said Kate tentatively, “but maybe . . .”
“Perfect!” said AJ. “Problem solved!”
FASHION HACK
What is upcycling?
Upcycling is a way of turning old and discarded materials into something special, 
giving the item a new life through your transformation.
FASHION HACK: T-SHIRT PILLOW HOW-TO
Turn a well-loved tee into a new pillow. Find an old t-shirt that you loved for the color 
or its graphic but has lost its shape or no longer fits you or has a small stain. Turn it 
inside-out and draw a square around the area you want to feature on your pillow, then 
sew along that line, leaving about a four-inch section unsewn. Use that opening to turn 
the t-shirt inside-right and stuff it with batting or strips of cut up discarded clothing. 
Sew up the hole then hot glue oversized buttons or other embellishments. And, enjoy 
your upcycled pillow!

“Settle down. Settle down!” Mrs. Frisch repeated for the third time. The 
fashion club was having its first official meeting of the year and everyone was 
excited to talk about designing and how the club worked and to learn more 
about their first competition of the year.
“Now let’s see,” Mrs. Frisch started, looking at an index card she held in her 
perfectly manicured hand. Mrs. Frisch looked amazing, as usual.
For a middle school teacher, Missy thought Mrs. Frisch always looked 
­glamorous and put together. Today, she wore navy cigarette pants, which were 
all clean lines, narrowing down to the ankle. The pants stopped right at the  
top of her ankles which peeked out above her bright red, canvas espadrilles. 
Mrs. Frisch sported a striped navy and white, three-quarters sleeve jersey 
shirt. To bring the whole look together, she topped it off with a nautical 
themed blue and red silk scarf with gold anchors on it. Très chic, Missy thought, 
wondering why this outfit made her want to speak French.
Navy and red plus gold anchors and white equal dy-no-mite. With her bobbed 
brown hair and golden highlights, Missy thought Mrs. Frisch might spend her 
summers acting in movies or posing for magazine covers.
Everyone settled in their seats at the raised draft tables. “First, we need a 
name for the fashion club,” Mrs. Frisch continued. “Second, we need to elect a 
few leaders. And, third, we need to do some planning.”

AJ’s hand shot into the air as she bounced up and down in her seat waiting for 
Mrs. Frisch to call on her. “Yes, Andrea?” Mrs. Frisch asked.
“What about our first competition?” AJ asked.
“Right. I’m so thrilled to see many of you have taken the initiative to get a 
head start! We will absolutely get to that!” Mrs. Frisch exclaimed. “Let’s get 
the administrivia out of the way—then we’ll jump into the fun!”
Everyone agreed to that and started brainstorming possible club names. 
This led to a heated discussion among all the club members, which included 
another four students from the seventh and eighth grades whom Missy had 
never met. They too must have heard the rumors about the upcoming event, 
as they had brought looks of their own. Missy was eager to hear about their 
inspiration and design process.
Finally, the students narrowed down their club name choices to two possibilities:  
Fashion Figures and Fashion Icons. Five against five is a standstill. And, when the  
matter could not be settled by a vote, Mrs. Frisch suggested a compromise 
taking terms from both name ideas. This new combination suited everyone 
perfectly and the vote to name their club “Figures and Icons” was unanimous.
“Loooove it!” Danny shouted puckering his face and walking like a model. 
Everyone laughed.
“Okay, designers. Time to elect our club leaders.” Mrs. Frisch explained that 
every club had special roles to help keep activities organized and to be sure 
everything was planned appropriately. She also explained that while not every-
one could have a leadership role, everyone in the club was responsible for 
keeping it fun and making it a great experience.
“We need to elect a president to run our meetings and help lead the planning 
for activities. We also need a communications manager to coordinate our 
SocialMe page, write announcements, and blog about our competitions, and 
we need a treasurer to keep track of our fundraising and expenses.”
“If you are interested in one of these roles, please step to the front of the 
classroom.” A strange silence crept across the room as everyone considered 
the leadership roles and gauged their individual interest.

AJ and Missy made their way to the front of the room, stopping to whisper 
their preferences to Mrs. Frisch. Two eighth graders also stepped up. After a 
few minutes, there were still just four people standing with Mrs. Frisch at the 
head of the class, and the chatter resumed.
“Ahem!” Mrs. Frisch cleared her throat to get everyone’s attention. “It seems 
we have an unusual situation. We have two candidates interested in being 
president and two candidates interested in being communications manager. 
We still need a treasurer, which is a vital role for the fashion club! Who’s 
interested in that role? Come on up!”
“I’m terrible at math,” said Mahdavi.
“You are not,” Morgan insisted. Morgan had slipped into the meeting midway 
into the voting for the club.
Kate crossed her arms and scowled at Mahdavi’s comment, “You could be 
treasurer, if you wanted.”
Danny whispered to Morgan, “My mama says I’m only good at spending money. 
Not keeping track of it.”
AJ elbowed Missy who was standing beside her at the front of the room.  
“You should be treasurer. You’re so great at math. And you love it,” she whis-
pered, covering her mouth with her hand.
Missy felt the heat rise up from her stomach to her head, and her cheeks 
turned bright red. The last thing she wanted to be known for were her math 
skills. “No way,” she whispered. “I’m running for president.”
Morgan raised her hand tentatively. “Um. Mrs. Frisch, I suppose I could give it a 
try. I’ve never been a treasurer before. It might be fun?” She said the last part 
like a question, and Mrs. Frisch winked at her.
“Excellent! Yes, it will be fun,” Mrs. Frisch reassured her, as she motioned for 
Morgan to come to the front of the classroom. “Congratulations, Morgan! 
Come on up. You are the club’s treasurer.” The students applauded, eager 
to finish the elections and move on to hear the details of the looming first 
competition.
Mrs. Frisch turned to the four other candidates standing with her. She spoke 
briefly to them, then she separated them into two groups. She announced, 
“Your candidates for president are Paula Teehan and Melissa Maker. Your 
­candidates for communications manager are Andrea Jane Dupre and Yooni 
Park.” AJ tensed up and wrinkled her nose at the use of her full and proper 
name. It always sounded so strange to her ears.
“Each person will speak for two minutes to share their qualifications for the 
roles, and then we will vote!” Mrs. Frisch concluded.

Chapter 3 | Figures and Icons
24
Paula Teehan had been the club’s communications manager the year before, 
and she talked about her experience in the club and how she could lead 
Figures and Icons as club president this school year. Missy spoke about her 
love of fashion and her eagerness to help the club do well. In the end, Paula 
won by a single vote—Missy’s. Missy respected her experience and hoped 
that she could work closely with Paula and learn how to be a good leader. In 
the second vote, AJ won the communications manager position, as she was 
already well known for her social media skills and daily SocialMe postings, 
which had a tremendous following.
With the elections wrapped up and only a few minutes left in the meeting, 
Mrs. Frisch talked about the competitions ahead and how they would work. 
Each competition would have a theme to inspire original designs, and for most 
events, teams would show three to five looks, which meant that the club had 
to work as a team most of the time and not as individuals. There would be 
events later in the year where each participant could show their own designs, 
but that would come later. Each club was responsible for getting their own 
fabrics, notions, and supplies, though they could solicit donations from local 
businesses. Mrs. Frisch brought out the club’s stash—club leftovers and dona-
tions from previous years. To Missy’s eyes, it was a magic box, filled with 
mystery and potential. Mrs. Frisch continued to share that they would act as 
their own models. They would decide who would wear the looks for each 
competition so the models could be fitted properly. Everyone buzzed and 
shared their excitement.
“Finally,” Mrs. Frisch said, “next week we have our first competition. I see 
­several of you have brought in designs. Work among yourselves to sort out 
who will model them and in our remaining time let’s work on fittings.”
They chose AJ, Kate, Mahdavi, a seventh grader named SallyAnn, and Yooni as 
models for the first competition. The girls quickly changed into the ­outfits, 
and Mrs. Frisch consulted on simple adjustments and fitting techniques to 
­consider. She reminded them that accessories and finishing touches like shoes 
and jewelry and handbags would complete their looks. Everyone left the 
meeting excited and feeling ready for their first event.

The bus ride from CHAPS to New Milford Regional seemed to take forever. 
Seven miles never seemed so long as when a whole busload of students was 
eager to arrive. Thirty miles per hour means we should arrive in fourteen minutes 
plus stop lights plus loading and unloading. Will we ever get there, Missy wondered.
When they finally arrived, Mrs. Frisch, a few CHAPS teachers, and all ten 
members of Figures and Icons de-boarded. The club members carried vinyl 
zippered garment bags, make-up cases and boxes with shoes and other 
­accessories. Mrs. Frisch pulled a large rolling suitcase behind her. It was the 
club’s show go-box, which held scissors, double-sided tape, a travel steam iron, 
needles, threads, buttons, zippers and a complete first aid kit.
Today, Mrs. Frisch had really outdone herself! She was dressed in a royal blue 
sheath dress and a smart cropped jacket that matched the dress perfectly. Her 
black heels click-click-clicked as she walked ahead of the students. Everyone 
marched in a line behind Mrs. Frisch. She led the students into the school and 
down a side hallway to the gym.
“Spectators proceed to the gymnasium bleachers. Figures and Icons, we are 
heading into the locker room. There are six teams competing today! We 
will share our locker room with two other teams. Please be courteous and 
respectful of our hosts and other competitors,” Mrs. Frisch reminded the 
students.

Chapter 3 | Figures and Icons
26
As she entered and looked around, Missy was confused. The locker room had 
been transformed. She never would have guessed that sports teams spent 
any time in here. Pipes with drapes hung along one side of the room ­creating 
individual nooks to give models some privacy while they changed clothes. 
Three raised platforms, several full-length mirrors and three clothing racks on 
wheels had been placed strategically around the room so that each team had 
a defined working area. As Figures and Icons set up in their designated space, 
students from the competing schools came by and introduced themselves. 
Everyone was nervous and excited. As the students began opening their 
­garment bags, a hush came over the room. Teams concentrated on dressing 
their models and preparing them for the runway show.
Missy squeezed AJ’s hand. She carefully removed their dress from its ­garment 
bag. Missy and AJ had designed the dress and then constructed it using ­material 
from Molly’s high school prom dress, an old t-shirt from Mr. Maker, and a few 
neckties that AJ’s step-dad had contributed to the cause. It could have been 
a hot mess, but they kept it simple and tasteful while trying to reflect their 
personalities.
Missy had wanted the dress to be knee-length and AJ wanted it to be flowy, 
so they combined their visions and they loved their final creation. After two 
summers at her favorite maker camp, Camp Winnebago, where Missy took 
classes in machine sewing, Missy was an expert seamstress. Plus, G-ma had 
taught her a few hand sewing techniques for embellishment.
Everything Missy loved was coming together. The two-piece look she created 
with AJ combined black lace over a sleeveless, white jersey crop top with a 
printed black and white floral skirt with deep side pockets that poofed out.  
A textured black silk tie made up the waistline and tied at the side. The outfit 
shimmered when it moved under the fluorescent light in the locker room.  
It was sure to dazzle on the runway.

“Not bad for one weekend of work!” AJ bragged.
Missy nodded as she smoothed the lace with her hands. “Twelve hours,  
thirty-nine minutes, to be exact,” she said. “Now let’s put it on you!”
AJ carefully took the dress into one of the changing stalls to put on, while 
Missy unpacked five bracelets and two necklaces, two handbags, three pairs 
of black and one pair of nude shoes. They had not decided how they would 
accessorize or which shoes to wear, so AJ had packed all of her dress shoes 
and Missy had borrowed some jewelry from G-ma and a few bags to try.
When AJ stepped up on the platform in the dress, Mrs. Frisch stepped over. 
“Andrea, you look wonderful! Let’s get your hair up and put on a little blush.” 
She waved over Morgan who carried a small case that looked like a fishing 
tackle box and wore an apron holding multiple brushes and hair notions. 
Though she was not a model for this show, Morgan was made up, dressed in 
a stylish one-piece romper with frilly shorts, and she looked ready to walk 
the runway. “Can you help AJ with a touch of make-up?” Mrs. Frisch directed.
Morgan worked quickly, pinning up AJ’s curly red hair, leaving a few curls to 
frame her face, and swooped and swirled a brushful of blush on each cheek. 
“There you are,” Morgan said and flounced over to Kate who was just ­coming 
out of a changing stall.
Missy was amazed that Morgan could work so well and so quickly, especially 
as AJ was up and down trying on each of the shoes and teetering around on 
the platform. They settled on the nude shoes and added all the jewelry Missy 
had borrowed. They decided to skip a bag.
“I love it!” Missy declared and snapped a photo of AJ alone on the platform 
and another one posing with her. Then she posted them both with the hashtag 
TrueToYou.
The whole team scuttled silently between the clothing racks, go-bags, boxes, 
changing rooms and shared platform. It was like a choreographed dance; 
­everyone somehow knew what to do. Whenever anyone needed help, 
­someone appeared with the solution. Missy felt so grown up and proud to be 
showing off something she had designed and made with her very own hands!
“Okay. Two minutes to the runway models. Take your numbers as you 
exit and hold onto them. Everyone else, head out to chairs and bleachers,”  
Mrs. Frisch announced. “We’ll line up by the door and I’ll send the models out 
one at a time. Remember to smile and hold up your number for the judges 
to see.”
Figures and Icons was the first team to walk the runway. Danny sat next 
to Missy and commented on each outfit as the models showed them off. 
It was hard to hear him over the soundtrack playing over the loudspeaker. 
When his design partner, Mahdavi, emerged Danny nearly leapt out of his seat.  
“Hot dog!” he said. “She looks great!”

Chapter 3 | Figures and Icons
28
Mahdavi wore an outfit that looked like a sari shrunk to just above her knees. 
Layers of colorful fabric swayed around her as she walked. She winked at her 
teammates at the end of the runway, tossed her head back throwing her long, 
flowing brown hair over her shoulder, then quickly turned and walked back to 
the locker room.
Missy nodded. Everyone looked like a real model. She counted the steps each 
model took from the time she stepped out onto the runway until she turned 
to go back. She divided that number by the five models on her team. Twelve 
steps on average from door across floor.
When the Figures and Icons models finished on the runway, they came out 
and sat in another section of the gym opposite Missy and Danny. Missy was 
disappointed that AJ could not be next to her for the rest of the show. She 
waved across the runway and AJ waved back with her paddle number, “134.” 
Then they quickly became mesmerized by the remaining competition.
The schools’ few spectators whooped and whistled for their schools’ teams. 
In awe of the outfits marching down the runway, Missy’s mouth hung open.
“You catchin’ flies?” Danny asked Missy. He tapped Missy’s chin with his index 
finger, and she closed her mouth.
“I’m so impressed,” Missy said.
“And inspired,” she heard Paula say from right behind her. “Isn’t it great how 
everything comes together out of the chaos? I just love it!”
Missy and Danny nodded in agreement. This experience was so different from 
anything she had ever done before. Even at maker camp, though they had a 
show at the end of the two weeks of camp, the production did not measure 
up to this, plus the fashion was intermingled with so many of the campers’ 
other creations.
“Just wait till we get to state finals,” said SallyAnn enthusiastically. A normally 
reserved and very quiet seventh grader in the club, SallyAnn wore a gray 

Fashion Figures

CHAPS sweatshirt over her OOTD. Her skin was very pale, and she had 
­delicate features. With the shirt pulled down over her knees, SallyAnn looked 
as if the sweatshirt had swallowed her whole, Missy thought.
“Don’t get ahead of yourself,” Paula cautioned. “This is our first runway of the 
year. We’ve got a long, LONG way to go before we can even talk about that!”
Missy hit herself on the head with the butt of her hand. OMG, she thought. 
She had been so wrapped up in the production, she had forgotten to take any 
photos. She pulled out her smartphone and snapped pictures of the remaining 
looks, adding notes to remember how the outfits made her feel.
The music suddenly changed, and the remaining models took their seats. Missy 
leaned right and posed next to Danny for a selfie and then leaned left and posed 
with Morgan. As she reviewed the photos, she saw Paula had photo-bombed 
them both. Missy laughed and posted her pix with the TrueToYou hashtag.
The six school club advisors and another adult marched in a line to the end of 
the stage. Missy turned her attention back to the runway as the music quieted.
“Welcome, students and spectators. I am principal of New Milford Regional. We 
are so happy to host the first fashion club meet of the season. Congratulations 
to our teams for an amazing show. Let’s hear it for the fashion club teams.” 
The crowd applauded and whistled. For a small group, their squeals and cheers 
made it feel as if the gym was packed full. The students in the bleachers 
stomped their feet and shook the whole room.
“Yes! Yes!” Principal Edwards spoke over the crowd, and used his hands to 
mime, “Quiet down. Now I’m sure you are all eager to hear the results, but 
first let’s introduce the schools and their advisors.”
Missy tuned out a bit and looked around the room. She tried to spot G-ma 
or her father among the spectators. She knew her dad had to work, but G-ma 
promised to be there. And, there she was sitting in the bleachers. G-ma waved 
wildly when she noticed Missy looking in her direction, and Missy waved back, 
smiling.
Each advisor spent a few minutes introducing their school and having their 
teams stand up to be recognized. Then came the introduction of the judges, 
which included the owner of a local fabric store called Notions, Mrs. Kilpatrick, 
the art and design teacher at New Milford Regional, Mrs. Lopez, and finally a 
special guest judge, the real-life model and designer Sarah DeMott. They all 
waved from their seats at the end of the runway.
The audience cheered. Missy was practically dumbstruck to see Sarah DeMott. 
Here they were in a small New Jersey town and the world-famous, actual 
cover girl, Sarah DeMott, was judging their fashion meet. She had to pinch 
herself to be sure she wasn’t dreaming. “Ouch,” Missy said, reminding her that 
this was no dream.

“We’ll announce the winners by their numbers, so they can come up on the 
runway to hear critiques and feedback from our judges. If you designed in 
teams, the whole team should come up,” the principal explained as the team 
advisors stepped down from the runway. “As a reminder, advisors will receive 
written critiques for all looks to share with their teams.” He took an envelope 
from a student at the end of the runway. “Okay. Here we go,” he announced. 
“We have number one-oh-nine. One-zero-nine. Designers and models, come 
on up.”
Everyone scanned the model section as no one seemed to be moving. Then, 
one teammate from New Milford Regional elbowed her friend who had set 
her number on the floor. She popped up with a screech and ran to the runway. 
From Missy’s section, two students got up to join the model. The three of 
them danced in a circle on the runway.
“Okay. Next, we have one-thirty-four. One-three-four,” the principal read.
Missy didn’t hesitate, she was out of her seat and up on the stage before AJ 
could get there. They hugged each other tightly jumping up and down.
The principal paused, turned to smile at the group on stage then said, “And, 
finally, please join us on the stage, number one-eighteen. One-one-eight!”
A loud whistle emanated from the crowd and someone shouted, “Go IVY!”
“Judges, teachers, students and spectators, I present the winners of the True To 
You fashion competition,” the principal said gesturing toward the group that 
had gathered on the runway behind him.
Everyone clapped and cheered, while Mrs. Frisch and another advisor came 
out and organized the teams on the stage at the top of the runway, so they 
could be seen by everyone.
When the crowd settled down, the principal left the stage and handed his 
microphone to the judges seated at the head of the runway. Mrs. Kilpatrick 
spoke first, “Let me start by saying that you are all winners. Each look we saw 
on the runway wowed us. I am so knocked out by what you have accom-
plished at your age. We judges had a tough time picking only three finalists.”
Missy fidgeted with her ponytail. She tugged it upward, imagining it was shoot-
ing to the moon. AJ touched her arm and Missy brought it down from her 
head back down to her side.
AJ whispered. “I totally cannot believe we are here. This is awesome.”  
AJ swayed slightly, shifting her weight from foot to foot.
“Before we make our final selections, we would like to hear from each team 
about your inspiration and about how your look reflects the True To You 
theme,” Mrs. Kilpatrick continued.

The same student who had delivered the envelope to the principal, appeared 
on the stage with three hand-held microphones. He showed each team where 
the “on” switch was and then disappeared.
“Let’s start with one-eighteen,” supermodel designer Sarah DeMott said. “Tell 
us the name of your school, your team and share your inspiration.”
Ivy fumbled with her microphone, so Missy reached over and helped her 
switch it on.
“Oh. Got it. My name is Ivy,” she started. “I go to Fairmount Prep and our team 
is called the Fashionanimas.” She paused as her team stood up and cheered.
Ivy was wearing an all-white minidress with a backless halter top that showed 
off her shoulders. It was belted by a funky sculpture made of black paper clips 
intertwined with red paracord. Missy had never seen anything like this dress 
and she was fascinated by the fabric draping that seemed so effortless.
“Uh. It’s my design, and I am modeling too,” Ivy said. “My inspiration came to 
me as I was thinking about who was my muse—and I started thinking about 
mythology and the Greek and Roman goddesses—I thought, ‘How can I turn 
that into something that reflects my personality?’ and this is what I came up 
with?” Ivy ended her statement like a question, which always caught Missy off 
guard. She had been drilled by G-ma and her father specifically not to do that, 
because it sounds like you don’t believe what you are saying. So, she tried hard 
not to speak in questions when she was making statements.
Sarah DeMott said, “Well, I just love it. I would wear this on the red carpet. 
Tell me more about your belt. That’s so unusual and interesting.”
Ivy thought for a moment and then spoke, “Actually, engineering is my first 
love. I love to put things together in interesting ways and I was playing around 
with some paper clips and before I knew it, I had a whole chain of them and I 
asked myself what more could I do to make that chain functional.”
Missy was stunned. She had never thought of using something like a paperclip 
in her fashions before. She wondered what other office supplies and trinkets 
she could make use of in some innovative way.
“Thank you, Ivy,” said Mrs. Lopez. “I think you did a great job, too. Let’s hear 
from one-thirty-four, next.”
AJ grasped Missy’s hand and squeezed hard. Missy used her thumb to switch 
on the microphone. “Hi, I’m Missy Maker,” she passed the microphone to AJ, 
“And I’m AJ Dupre. We’re from Cherry Hill.”
AJ passed the microphone back to Missy. “Our team is Figures and Icons,” 
she said and her schoolmates and team answered with whoops and chants of  
“Go CHAPS! Go CHAPS!”

“We were inspired by our school’s recycling campaign,” Missy said. She heard a 
loud whistle and looked up. G-ma was standing in the bleachers smiling widely. 
Missy continued, “We loved the idea of taking something old and remaking it 
into something completely new. Plus, our club got a late start this year and we 
had no money for materials,” she said and the audience laughed.
“I enjoyed the mixture of textures and patterns,” Sarah DeMott commented.
“I really liked the styling,” Mrs. Kilpatrick added.
“Yes.” The art teacher judge, Mrs. Lopez agreed, “This look is so modern and 
funky.”
AJ’s excitement overwhelmed her. Her sway became a full-on hop from one 
foot to the other. Missy shook her hand and arm and AJ slowed her jig back 
into a slow and steady sway.
“Good job. Okay. Team one-zero-nine, there are so many of you,”  
Mrs. Kilpatrick announced.
The last team was huddled together, with their model in the middle holding 
the microphone. “We’re the Gazingers from St. Mark’s Academy. I’m Amy,” said 
the model. “I’m Anthony,” Anthony said dipping his head to the microphone. 
“And I am Lola.”
Amy wore a two-piece outfit. The top was a blue square, which, to Missy, 
looked like a pillowcase with a head hole and arm holes cut out of it. The blue 
top was layered over a long pencil skirt that stayed narrow all the way to the 
floor. Missy wondered how Amy had walked down the runway without trip-
ping on the dress.
Amy held the microphone while Lola continued, “We were inspired by sewing 
simplicity. We wanted to make a look using only straight lines and only sewing 
where it was absolutely needed. So you can see we have raw edges and really 
only one nearly continuous seam in each garment. We think it’s True To You 
because we each added one element to the project while keeping the simplic-
ity and straight line idea at the center.”
“That’s so cool,” Sarah DeMott said.
“I agree,” said Mrs. Lopez. “That’s really a unique perspective!”
Mrs. Kilpatrick wrapped up, “Yes. I love your concept, though that skirt could 
probably be executed a little better so your model can get around more 
easily.”
After the teams’ remarks, the principal hopped up on the runway. “Let’s hear 
it for our finalists one more time.” The cheers and stomping came up and 
quickly died down as everyone was eager to hear the results.
The envelope boy appeared again passing a new envelope on. The ­principal 
pulled out a card and read from it. In third place, Gazingers!” St. Mark’s

Academy fashion club advisor came up on the stage with a small trophy. The 
designers each held a part of it and posed for a picture.
Missy and AJ and Ivy were shaking with excitement and holding hands.
“In first place in the True to You event is Fashionanimas!”
Missy’s stomach dropped and she thought she would cry right on the spot. 
AJ pulled her in and gave her a hug. Then AJ cheered. “Great job, Ivy!” Missy 
liked that about AJ. She guessed it was AJ’s good-sportsman’s nature from all 
her years as an athlete that taught her to always cheer on the winner even in 
the face of defeat.
Mrs. Frisch joined them on stage carrying the second-place trophy. She held 
it high in the air as the team joined in and gathered close for a photo. That 
professional photo was followed by a series of selfies that were texted far and 
wide to social networks and beyond.
The Fairmount Prep advisor hopped onto the runway with a huge trophy. Ivy 
posed with her advisor, and that completed the event.
The competitors all headed back to the locker room to change into their  
normal clothes and to pack up for the bus ride back to CHAPS. Missy  
followed her teammates back to the locker room. She focused on cleaning 
up their area, picking up bobby pins, socks and random notions to pack away 
or throw away, the whole time calculating probabilities, wondering what she 
could have done differently to bring home the first-place trophy.

MATH HACK: WHAT IS A PROBABILITY?
Statistics is an area of math that focuses on probability. A probability is the likelihood 
of something occurring. It can be calculated using a ratio between all possibilities and 
likely occurrences. It is often represented as a fraction or as a percent. Percent means 
per one hundred.
Here’s a hack for you: Figure out the probability of getting a blue gumball from a jar 
of 30 gumballs where there are 10 each of red, blue and yellow gumballs. Looking at 
the whole jar, you know that 10 out of 30 will be blue gumballs. So, your chance of 
getting a blue one is 10/30 or 1/3. The probability is 1 in 3 chances or 33% that you 
will receive a blue gumball.
FUN FACT
Weather newscasters use probabilities to report on the weather. There is no way to 
know exactly what the weather will be on any given day, so they use trends and data 
to determine the most likely scenarios.

Divided We 
Stand
The bus ride back to school seemed to take twice as long as it had taken to 
get to the competition. Spectators and club members kept up the chatter 
on the bus, while Missy counted telephone poles along the route and tried 
not to think about why she felt sad. After all, this was her first ever real 
­fashion ­competition, and her team had placed among the top contestants. She 
guessed that was pretty good for a look they had put together in a weekend, 
using recycled materials.

Missy scrolled through the pictures on her phone. Twenty-five outfits and only 
three winners. Missy calculated the odds of getting any awards facing that  
level of competition. The probability was lower than Missy expected—only 
about 13%.
She took out her phone and looked at all the pix from the event. One selfie 
had her and AJ with their heads together making goofy eyes into the camera. 
Suddenly Missy remembered that in the sweeping excitement of the event, she 
completely flaked and forgot to capture all the CHAPS looks. She would have 
to talk to her friends to see if anyone else had thought to take pictures of the 
CHAPS outfits. Missy hoped at least one person had the presence of mind to 
capture it all. Luckily, she had taken photos of the remaining competitors.
The notes she wrote in her phone brought her back to each exciting and 
lovely moment of the show. She felt so many emotions just thinking back 
to the hours she had just lived through. Camp Winnebago had had a Maker 
Fair at the conclusion of her summer camp. That had been fun too. The Fair 
included a kind of show where every camper shared and showed off what 
they made during the camp. Missy had sported the blue spandex shorts she 
had sewn along with an oversized tie-dyed tee she had made in shades of 
blues and purples. Missy looked down at her hands remembering how long it 
had taken to get all the dye off of them. G-ma and Mr. Maker showered her 
with compliments and Missy ended up making her dad a matching tie-dye shirt 
that he wore with his pajama bottoms. Missy didn’t remember having these 
wild feelings of excitement and anxiety.
As she continued scrolling through the photos, Missy remembered one look 
that she had expected to be a finalist but that had not won any recognition. 
The look appeared to be a long denim dress, but when the model walked, 
Missy could see that the outfit was a wide-legged jumpsuit. The blue denim 
apron covered the model’s top half like a fitted tube with armholes. The jump-
suit had deep side pockets, which Missy thought had looked so cool. Missy 
also liked a simple tank top and shorts outfit she saw. Then she came upon 
another favorite—and remembered Ivy and her architectural approach to 
fashion. Missy daydreamed while the others chattered away.
Seated next to Missy on the bus, AJ was bobbing up and down in her seat 
talking excitedly with the other Figures and Icons members. “That was WILD.  
I was never so excited and nervous and happy all at once in my whole life! Not 
even when I crossed the 5K finish line first last spring! I feel so . . .,” AJ looked 
up to the ceiling trying to come up with the right word, “accomplished!”  
AJ was talking a mile a minute and with her constant bouncing, Missy feared 
AJ might fly right down the aisle of the bus if the driver had to stop fast. 
Thankfully, everyone, including AJ, had their seat belts on.
“I know exactly what you mean,” Danny declared. “That was so fun and every-
one looked awesome and it was all so, I-don’t-know, professional. Just like we 
are real designers and real models.”

“We are!” Paula said. “We are real designers. We created new ideas and we  
sewed fabrics together to make those ideas into actual clothing. Then we 
dressed up our very own models and sent them down an actual runway.  
We are real designers and real models.”
On an inhale, Mahdavi all but screamed. “It’s totally just dawned on me. We 
are!” She side-hugged Danny who was in the seat beside her. “We ARE! Oh, 
my goodness!” Danny and Mahdavi put their heads together and giggled, 
chanting, “We are real designers. We are real designers.” Soon, the whole bus 
caught on and everyone repeated the mantra.
Missy understood exactly what they meant. She and AJ had worked together 
to create something real that started from a few sketches on Missy’s math 
notebook. Then, what started out on paper was brought to life. They pieced 
together random materials until they finally finished. Who else could have 
imagined putting a man’s tie and a t-shirt together with a lace gown to create 
such a magical look as Missy and AJ had done?
Missy thought back to the Aha! moment in her bedroom. They had sketches 
strewn all over the floor and articles of clothing and donated notions and 
fabrics covering Missy’s desk and bed. Pi pranced around as if inspecting each 
piece. With his tail in the air he had checked their work over finally settling 
himself on the sketch Missy and AJ had chosen to bring to life. That moment, 
when it all came together, thrilled Missy.
Oddly enough, that moment reminded Missy of when she learned how to do 
long division. The actual second when everything just clicked and she under-
stood. “Hmm,” Missy said, smiling to herself. She loved connecting the dots in 
her life, finding and creating patterns. And, she had just realized a whole new 
world of discovery lay ahead for her.
When the bus arrived back at CHAPS, Mrs. Frisch gathered the club members 
in a circle on the school’s front lawn before dismissing them to go home. 
“I’m so proud of all of you! You should all feel great about this competition.  
Not everyone can take home a prize, and the judges were clearly impressed.” 
Mrs. Frisch looked around the circle. Most of the fashion club members had 
their arms around each other’s shoulders listening intently to their mentor. 
“At our next meeting, we’ll take a look at the judges’ comments. We can 
always learn by keeping our minds and hearts open! Let’s have a cheer before 
you all rush off to get home.”
The fashion club members piled their hands on top of Mrs. Frisch’s in the 
­center of the circle, then Paula led them in a cheer. “CHAPS designs are 
A-OK! Figures and Icons all the waaaaaaaaaay!”
Everyone shouted, “GOOOO CHAPS!”

Chapter 4 | Divided We Stand

As the circle opened up and began to disband, Danny said to the models,  
“You girls did a great job! You really showed off the designs!” He clapped his 
hands and jumped up, “And, I can’t believe we won!”
“We didn’t win,” Missy corrected. “We came in second.”
“Huh?” Danny said, confused. “There were a lot of teams that did not make 
it back up on that stage, Missy. With a second-place trophy, we surely did win! 
The judges loved the design you and AJ came up with!” Everyone nodded their 
agreement and Missy smiled back.
Danny patted Missy’s arm.
“You’re right, Danny. Sorry I said that,” Missy said sheepishly.
“What a day!” he said and turned to hug Mahdavi who had stepped up beside 
him. “I’ve got some new ideas, Mad. Can’t wait to show you my sketches!” 
Danny linked arms with Mahdavi as they walked toward the parking lot where 
their parents waited to pick them up.
“Great job, everyone,” Mrs. Frisch repeated as she packed up and checked 
her bag.
“I can’t wait to read all the judges’ comments and feedback,” Yooni interjected. 
“I really want to know what they liked and how we can improve.”
“Me too,” said Morgan. “I’m excited for another competition.” The others 
repeated similar comments and exchanged hugs. They scanned the school 
parking lot, looking for their parents and siblings who were coming to pick 
them up.
Missy and AJ were the last two left waiting, so they plopped down on the grass. 
Mrs. Frisch had recruited two senior boys coming off the football field to carry 
the go-bag and the boxes with the garments folded in them back to the studio.

AJ plucked at the grass between them. “Hey Miss?” she asked.
“Yes?” Missy asked in response, looking after the boys and Mrs. Frisch heading 
back into the building.
AJ waited for Missy to look at her, then she spoke: “That was really cool today. 
Ya know?”
“I agree,” Missy said, “but I was kind of sad for a second. You know? We didn’t 
come in first place.” Missy paused and picked out a dandelion from the lawn. 
“Then I started thinking about the work we did to get there. How ­everything 
we did came together to make something really beautiful. We both had 
­different ideas, but then it all worked. And, that’s the best part. That’s what 
I loved—working with my best friend. Making something amazing. Together.  
I can’t wait to do it again! You know?”
“Totally,” AJ said. “I get it. Coming in the top three was a total rush for me.”
“I know,” Missy said, “that was cool, too.” Missy stood up and brushed  
the grass from her bottom. AJ followed suit. G-ma had just pulled into the 
­parking lot.
“Let’s go,” Missy said. They picked up their backpacks along with the bag of 
shoes and accessories and headed to the car.
MATH HACK: PERCENTAGES
Calculating percentages can be tricky! Here are some things to know about 
percentages.
The word percent actually means per, or how many, in one hundred. So, a percentage 
is a number expressed as a fraction or a ratio of 100. It is denoted using the percent 
sign, %. Percentages are used to compare numbers or to determine the relative size 
or quantities of two or more things.
For example, fifteen percent (15%) is equal to 15/100, or 3/20, or 0.15.
Your math grade is a percentage: An A+ means the average of your classwork and 
test scores is between 98% and 100%, while a C+ is between 77% and 79%.

Painted blue in Missy’s favorite shade: not baby blue, not light blue, but 
­cornflower blue. Missy’s room was her sanctuary. She could escape there and 
be alone or invite friends over to play or spread her things all around to work. 
Missy’s room was larger than most of her friends’ bedrooms, because for 
ten years, she had shared it with her sister Molly. Now that Molly lived in an 
­apartment in her college town, Missy had the room to herself. Her sister had 
taken her own double bed and dresser for her new bedroom, and Missy now 
had all the space to herself. That space included everything Missy could ever 
need: books and bookshelves, a desk and laptop computer, a sewing machine 
and table, her very own dress form, a walk-in closet—big enough even to 
fit a bean bag chair, which was the envy of all her friends, and a view of her 
­backyard through the matching oval windows above her desk.
Missy sat on her bed with her math book opened on her lap. She had her 
headphones on tuned to Sean Mendes for inspiration. Across the room, she 
had four old pairs of jeans cut up into a zillion pieces. All the back pockets 
had been carefully removed. The legless seats were carefully folded, while the 
remaining denim fabric from the legs stretched out in long strips hanging from 
her desk, her dresser, and her reading chair in the corner of her room.

Four pair times two pockets mean eight pockets to adorn the skirt. She might be 
able to make that work. Missy imagined the circumference of the skirt she was 
designing and using her mental math skills calculated that she was one pocket 
short. Her original calculations had suggested she would need nine pockets, 
but should she change the design or find another pair of old jeans at the thrift 
store or in her dad’s closet? Missy wondered.
Missy sketched alternate versions of her design in the margins of her math 
notebook. “I bet I can make it work, even with seam allowances,” Missy said 
out loud as she worked.
Seam allowances are extra fabric needed for sewing multiple pieces of ­fabric 
together. If she didn’t add the seam allowances, then her outfit would be 
smaller than she wanted it to be. Missy had learned that lesson the hard 
way during her first summer at Camp Winnebago’s Maker Camp. She made 
a pair of spandex shorts that only fit her because the fabric was so stretchy. 
Her sewing instructor explained the problem. In order to sew a pattern to 
size, it had to be cut slightly larger than the size it was made for. Missy’s 
­problem was that she had cut her pattern to her exact size without adding 
the seam ­allowances. So, on her next try Missy cut out a second pair of shorts 
with an extra quarter inch all around, and those shorts ended up fitting her 
­perfectly—and comfortably.
Missy daydreamed of dancing denim skirts prancing down the imaginary 
­runway in her mind moving in time to the music on her headphones. Bringing 
her back to math, Pi leapt onto Missy’s bed and snuggled his way under Missy’s 
math notebook looking to wriggle his way into Missy’s lap. Pi settled there for 
a moment while Missy stroked his soft, patterned fur, only to be disturbed 
by the sudden vibrations of Missy’s smartphone. Startled, Pi and Missy both 
jumped, sending pencils, books, sketches, homework, and denim remnants 
­flying in every direction.

“Epic math test tomorrow,” Missy read the first part of AJ’s group text out 
loud.
Brain on fire from studying. :S.
Missy laughed and held her phone an arm’s length away trying to take a selfie 
that included the mess of papers on her bed and floor—keeping herself and 
Pi in the center. She replied with a photo and comment.
Totally. ;) Can’t wait 'til it’s over! So psyched for 
Figures and Icons meeting.
I think I’ve got some super ideas!
In response, the selfie storm started.
Morgan sent a photo of herself sitting at her desk peeking over a stack of 
books.
#CHAPSciFi, too! :O.
CHAPSciFi was the hashtag for the middle school’s science and literature 
fair, and all project proposals were due on Friday. Morgan, AJ and Missy had 
teamed up last year for the fifth grade science fair. They came in first place 

Chapter 5 | Patterns and Problems

for their project, which demonstrated that many brands of so-called flushable 
wipes were, in fact, not flushable or environmentally friendly at all. In middle 
school, teams were not allowed, so everyone had to submit proposals for 
unique science projects or outlines for science fiction stories that imagined 
how the world might be in a future time.
The selfies continued to arrive on Missy’s phone—each with a distinctive ding, 
ring, dong or song. Mahdavi shared a close-up of her hands, fingernails bitten to 
nubs. Missy took one look and turned her phone away. “Ouch,” she said to Pi, 
“that looks painful.”
Danny jumped in and sent a photo of his wide-opened eye with a raised 
­eyebrow. He admonished them.
Ya’ll better keep your eye on the ball.
Missy laughed out loud as she leaned over the side of her bed to grab up the 
fallen papers and books. She was hanging half on and half off her bed when  
Mr. Maker knocked and then walked into her bedroom.
“Whoa,” he said. “Looks like a tornado came through here!”
“Not quite,” said Missy pushing herself up one-handed, while clutching papers 
with the other hand. “It was Pi!”
Mr. Maker bent down and picked up a handful of note pages. “Interesting 
designs, Miss. How’s math adding up?”
Avoiding his gaze, Missy said, “To sum up, I’m dividing my time between math 
homework and designing so I don’t get bored.”
“Ah. Good one,” Mr. Maker handed the pages back to Missy and surveyed her 
bedroom.
Missy righted herself on her bed and started organizing her papers and books.
“Maybe you should work at your desk, kiddo,” Mr. Maker suggested, “though 
that might require more division of labor.”
“I’m fine, Dad,” Missy said. Her desk was covered in denim cut-outs and she 
didn’t want to go to the trouble of moving and reorganizing all the pieces she 
had expertly extracted. It had taken more than an hour to lay everything out 
in the current pattern, which alternated the fronts and backs of the denim 
strips. It made a really cool effect that she knew the other Figures and Icons 
members would go crazy for.
“OK,” he said, resigned. “After dinner, you can relocate to the dining room table 
to get your homework done. I really think you need a few less distractions.”
Missy nodded, agreeing with her father just as another selfie popped up on her 
smartphone screen. AJ posed pretending to be unconscious, her math book

covering her face. The caption she read made Missy raise her eyebrows and 
look at her dad in appeal while showing him her screen.
RIP. Here lies AJ Dupre. Died of a serious math 
overdose.
“Looks like AJ needs a resuscitation! Two minutes,” he said as Missy started 
to dial AJ’s number. “Dinner in thirty,” he said leaving the room as he heard AJ 
answer on her end.
“OMG!” AJ shouted. “I really think my head is going to explode.
“You’ll be fine,” Missy assured her.
“Hey, were those pockets you were drawing on your math notes? They looked 
so cute!” AJ commented.
Missy turned the page with her sketch around in her hand, looking at it from 
an odd angle. “I’m just playing with an idea. I like the geometry of the triangles 
and creating visual contrast using different patterns,” Missy said.
“Well, I can’t wait to see the final design! You’re such an inspiration.”
Missy blushed, thankful she had phoned rather than video chatted. “We’ll see,” 
she said. “BTW, this is your wake-up call! You simply cannot DIE of math!”
AJ giggled. “Thanks, Missy! I know I can count on you to get me through!”
“That’s what friends are for.” Missy lowered her voice in an imitation of a 
robot, “Besides, my dad says we need to stay on track with math to be sure we 
keep all our options open for the best careers when we get older.”
AJ laughed and reminded Missy, “If it wasn’t for your help, I never would have 
made it into the advanced math class, anyway.”
“It’s your hard work keeping you there,” Missy said. “Now back to it!” Missy 
ended the call and considered her own options. She could study more or 
work on her design in the few minutes before dinner. She gathered up her 
books and stuffed them in her backpack—she’d had enough math for now. 
She wanted to play around with her design to see how to avoid looking 
for another denim pocket. Missy pulled out her tape measure, made some 
­measurements and jotted them down. Then she started on a calculation using 
the length of the straight tops on the pockets. When she realized what she 
was doing, she threw her pencil down. I’m not using math to do this, Missy 
decided. Who needs math for fashion?
Just as she was settling in at her desk, Missy heard the dong that signaled a 
video call coming from Molly. She had forgotten about their weekly call. Missy 
uncovered the mouse to click the Accept Call button as she greeted her sister. 
“Molly, I almost forgot it was Sunday!” she said.

“Hey, Miss. What’s up? And why is my screen blocked? Is your webcam on?” 
Molly asked.
“OMG!” Missy said, exasperated. “I’ve got a project laid out and,” she explained 
as she carefully picked up the denim strips to reveal her webcam, “I guess it’s 
blocking your view.”
“Nice,” Molly said. “Looks like you’ve been busy.” As Missy straightened and 
repositioned the webcam, Molly got a quick preview of the fabric laid out 
on Missy’s desk along with a close-up view of Missy’s left hand. “Okay. That’s 
­better,” Molly commented once Missy had secured the webcam at the top of 
her monitor.
“I’m working on a design idea for Figures and Icons,” Missy reported. “I am 
thinking about geometric shapes and creating patterns with contrasting the 
right side with the wrong side of the fabrics. And, I’m still kind of stuck on 
the idea of using recycled materials and notions. I really like that I can be 
‘green’ and still create something brand new. I even have an idea for some 
accessories!” Missy reached under her desk and pulled up one of the legless, 
pocket-less pairs of jeans and wiggled them in front of the camera. Molly’s 
eyes opened wide as she tried to take in exactly what Missy was showing her.  
“Hey, not so close! I can’t see—OK—now I get it. So cool. I mean S-E-W cool!”

“Oh. Now you’re channeling Dad, too,” Missy smiled at her sister and 
­continued with her explanation. “I’m going to sew the legs closed and add 
some ­embellishments with the glue gun and a long strap to transform this into 
a messenger bag. What do you think?” Missy asked Molly.
Molly squinted and pulled her head back, trying to get a better view. “Wow, 
Miss! I’m really impressed. I may even place an order for one of your custom 
bags for myself. Have you told Dad about your concepts? I bet he’s thrilled 
to hear you’ve been listening all these years about being green!” Missy loved 
her video chats with Molly, but wished she could spend more time with her 
in person. As Molly talked, Missy examined her sister’s face. She still looked 
the same—same blond hair as Missy’s, though Molly’s hair was straight and 
she kept her long hair down which showed off her amazing green eyes. Missy 
worried when everyone had said that college would change her, so Missy was 
always relieved to see that Molly still looked the same.
“It isn’t easy being green,” Missy mimicked her dad and they both laughed. 
“Right now, Dad’s worried that I’m not focusing enough on my school work.”
Onscreen, Molly looked away and yelled over her shoulder, “Yes! I’ll be down 
in a sec.” Then she turned back and said to Missy, “School is really important 
too and you’re so smart! I know you can balance your passions and your 
­commitments. I love your ideas and Dad will, too. Anyway, I’ve gotta run. We 
are off to the dining hall for dinner. Love ya!”
“Love ya, too,” Missy answered, and her screen went black.
After hanging up, Missy’s heart ached for just a second. She really missed 
her big sister, even though she treasured their weekly video chats. Still, she 
counted the days until Molly would be home for her next break. Missy wished 
Molly could see her designs up close, feel the weight of the fabric and even try 
one of them on. She would make her a hobo bag and send it to her.
Missy thought about what Molly had said. She never felt smart, though school-
work did seem to come easy to her. Lately, though, everything felt like a 
distraction pulling her away from what she had discovered she truly loved—
creating new designs!
“Dinnnnner!” Missy’s dad sang from the kitchen.
“Coming, Dad,” Missy responded as she finished pinning her pockets together, 
without bothering to measure or to make any calculations as she went.

FASHION HACK: SEAM ALLOWANCE
How do you calculate a seam allowance? The small space of fabric between the raw 
edge of the material and where the seam is actually sewn is the seam allowance. 
Common seam allowances range from one-quarter of an inch to as much as several 
inches. Woven fabrics can easily fray, so the seams on those fabrics need to be sewn 
far enough away from the raw edge for security and to avoid having gaping holes in 
your garment.
To be sure your garment will fit to size, add at least one-half inch to all of your 
measurements before cutting out your pattern pieces. That one-half inch adds  
one-quarter inch to each end of your fabric, which helps ensure that you can wear 
your garment after it has been sewn together.
Good advice: Cut just once AFTER you’ve measured TWICE.

Garbage In ≠ 
Garbage Out
“EEEP. EEEP. EEEP. EEEP. EEEP.” Missy came awake through a fog of exhaustion 
as she slammed her fist on the button of her radio alarm clock. She sat up and 
looked around her room. Missy sighed heavily.
For three straight nights, she had stayed up late sewing and ripping apart the 
same skirt. The denim strips that had been neatly laid out before were now 
strewn all over her bedroom. The rest of the skirt fabric lay in a heap on the 
floor under her sewing machine. Missy had thrown it there in a fit of anger 
the night before.
“Up and at ‘em,” Missy mumbled to herself. She was channeling G-ma in order 
to motivate herself to get out of bed. As soon as she set her feet on the 
floor, she heard her father call goodbye to her from the stairwell. She said 
­goodbye and sleepwalked through breakfast, getting dressed and riding the 
bus to school. She wondered how she would make it through the day. Missy 
had never felt this tired in her life.
The first bell rang just as Missy stepped past Mrs. Towers to enter her 
­homeroom class. Missy had health this semester, which was taught by the gym 
teachers. After her restless night, Missy was tired and mismatched. She had 
left her house without posting her #OOTD and had noticed on the bus ride 
that even her pigtails seemed to be drooping. Missy tugged one pigtail north 
as she dragged herself to her seat and noticed a note on the whiteboard 
in the front of the classroom: R U Ready? Recycling Assembly Today.

Chapter 6 | Garbage In ≠ Garbage Out

Missy laughed to herself to see the missing letters from the last recycling 
­promotion poster repeated on the board.
Other students caught sight of the note. Soon the whole class was chattering 
away. Missy yawned widely. She wondered which classes would be suspended 
while the assembly was held.
Mrs. Towers closed the door and picked up the remote for the class TV.  
“OK. Settle down,” Mrs. Towers said. “Let’s hear today’s announcements and 
then we will head to the school assembly.”
As the class settled down to listen, Missy noticed that Mrs. Towers wore her 
usual uniform of CHAPS-wear. She had on a gray sweatshirt and matching 
­sweatpants both emblazoned with the school logo. Topping it all off was a ­silver 
whistle ­dangling from a black cord hung around her neck. Mrs. Towers clicked the 
remote and the CHAPS-TV channel came on. Three girls from the third grade 
led the school in the “Pledge of Allegiance,” then Chris Jones came onscreen to 
talk about the all-school assembly, which would be held in the school’s audito-
rium from 8:30 to 10:00 that morning. First-period classes were suspended and 
all other classes would be shortened by ten minutes, except lunch.
When the video concluded, Mrs. Towers announced, “This will be a great 
assembly! Pay attention, because students will be expected to develop new 
ideas for the Reduce, Reuse, Recycle and Repurpose program. So, be inspired 
and enjoy the assembly!”
Missy half-expected Mrs. Towers to blow her whistle when she finished 
speaking. Instead, Mrs. Towers used arm motions to direct the students to 
line up and then walk over to the common campus building, where the school 
auditorium was located.
For school assemblies, each grade sat together; so, Missy and AJ found their 
way to each other and pulled in the Figures and Icons friends they saw to sit 
with them.

The assembly turned out to be a performance by the Green Team Theatre 
Troupe, or GT3. They performed a tale of two schools—one that didn’t 
­recycle and one that did. Both schools started out the same. Over the 
years, the non-green school spent so much money on waste disposal and 
­replacement purchases that it could no longer afford the latest technologies, 
new books and important materials for its students, and the upkeep of its 
buildings. Meanwhile, the school that focused on reducing waste, reusing and 
repurposing older materials and recycling in other ways had plenty of money 
for new technologies and top-notch labs and facilities. The green school 
also ­encouraged its students to develop innovative programs to continually 
improve their green-status. Over time, the green school and its students were 
able to help the failing non-green school to recover by showing them how to 
be greener.
Missy couldn’t help but laugh out loud, when the troupe’s narrator closed 
the show by saying, “It isn’t easy being green, unless you and you and you  
(he pointed to individuals all throughout the audience) and you and you and 
me JUMP IN!” At those final words, the whole troupe jumped to center 
stage and dance music blared over the speakers. “Jump! Jump! Jump in!” they 
chanted in tune with music. The students cheered and the show ended with 
the curtains closing and all the students dancing in the aisles.
“I’m so pumped!” Morgan said as they headed back to their classes. “I never 
thought I could be so excited by recycling,” she added.
“I know it. Me too,” AJ said.
The show had invigorated Missy, though she had been quiet. “I wonder,” she 
started, feeling a new energy pumping her up.
“What’s that, Miss?” Danny asked.
“What if we made Figures and Icons all about recycling for this whole year?” 
Missy pondered. “I mean, we did a great job on our first fashion competition. 
And, we didn’t even HAVE to use old and recycled materials. What if we make 
using old clothes or donated fabric like part of our charter or something?”
Danny scratched his head, “I like it! It could work. We should talk to  
Mrs. Frisch to see what she says.”
“I’m thinking we could do even more,” Morgan said. “What if we start a 
­mending club? That could help too. We could be greener and be helpful to 
others and maybe get some fabric donations that way too.”
AJ and Missy nodded. “Cool!” they exclaimed together. “JINX!” they both said. 
Then AJ and Missy spent a minute on the Jinx game. Jinx was a longtime favorite 
game played by Missy and her friends. It could only be played when two people 
said the exact same word at the exact same time. Whenever that happened, 
whoever declared “Jinx!” first won the game and silenced the other person.  

Chapter 6 | Garbage In ≠ Garbage Out
52
In order to be released from the jinx, another person had to call the ­jinxed 
person by name. In this round, Missy and AJ had not only said ­matching words 
but also declared matching jinxes, which extended the game into a kind 
of overtime. “I love that too,” Missy finally said, after winning the jinx and 
­silencing AJ until someone said her name.
Danny took pity on AJ who was rocking back and forth on her heels and 
seemed ready to jump out of her skin from excitement. He said, “AJ? What’s 
that?”
AJ high-fived Danny and said, “Let’s talk to Mrs. Frisch after school and see 
what she says!” They all agreed, then split up to get to their second-period 
classes.
Missy shuffled her way through her morning classes eager to get to lunch to 
talk to her friends about their upcycling ideas. As she walked into her math 
class, she remembered the scheduled test. Her heart skipped a beat and she 
held her breath for a moment then blew it out. It was too late to study and 
too silly to panic. Missy would have to make do with what she knew AND 
what she did not know. She looked down at her feet and walked to her seat. 
On the plus side, the test would have to be short since all her classes were 
abbreviated because of the assembly.
When the lunch bell rang, Missy looked down at her math test and noticed she 
still had three problems to complete. Where had the time gone? She quickly 
read the remaining questions and jotted down her answers without taking 
the time to show her calculations, as the instructions had directed her to do.
Ms. Jameson cleared her throat to get the attention of the last few students 
still working. “Wrap up, boys and girls. Class has ended.”
The remaining students handed their tests to Ms. Jameson, packed up their 
belongings and filed out of the room. Missy was the last one to hand in her 
test.
“Everything OK?” Ms. Jameson asked Missy. Missy usually finished her assign-
ments and tests much more quickly, often ahead of everyone else in the class.

Fashion Figures
53
“Oh. Yes,” Missy answered looking dazed and still wondering how the time 
had gotten away from her.
“OK. Off to lunch then,” Ms. Jameson said.
Members of the fashion club congregated in the hallway outside the art ­studio, 
and Morgan and Missy filled them in on their idea to make incorporating 
recycled and repurposed fabrics into their designs as a theme for the year.
Paula had a few reservations. “I’m not sure that will work for the whole 
year,” Paula explained. “Last year, we had a challenge that required alternative 
­materials—like not even fabric. Some teams used hardware and others used 
office supplies—it was super awesome and crazy. I remember that the winning 
look was made entirely out of rope and pieces of colorful garden hoses!”
Missy’s jaw dropped. She was speechless. The belt that Ivy made for the 
first challenge came to mind and other images started dancing in her head. 
The idea of alternative fabrics really excited her. AJ poked her in the ribs to 
get her attention. “Whaaa?” Missy asked, coming back to the conversation.  
“Oh. Sorry,” she added closing her mouth and listening.
Kate chimed in, “Really? That sounds super cool. I wonder if those kinds of 
materials could be collected from recyclables too.”
Missy turned away from the group when she heard the click-click of  
Mrs. Frisch’s taupe pumps coming down the hallway. Mrs. Frisch sported a 
fuchsia sheath dress with a subtle pattern of polka dots that could only be seen 
when the light reflected off the material. An artful scarf with silver threads 
running through it draped her shoulders and accented her perfectly made-up 
face. She wore her hair in a stylish bun with two chopsticks crisscrossed at 
the base. As usual, Mrs. Frisch was looking totally fab.
“Hello Figures and Icons,” Mrs. Frisch sang as she unlocked the classroom. 
“Welcome! I’d like to hear your ideas about fundraising and planning for our 
next competitions.”
The students poured into the room, excitedly speaking over each other.

Chapter 6 | Garbage In ≠ Garbage Out
54
Paula stepped to the front of the room and cleared her throat. “Ok. We’ve 
got a few big things to talk about today,” she started, “but before we jump 
into that, I know we all want to hear the comments from the judges on our  
True To You designs.”
On cue, Mrs. Frisch handed out the scorecards to the teams who had already 
paired up around the room. “As you review the judges’ remarks and ­comments, 
remember that feedback is a gift,” Mrs. Frisch told the students. “The judges 
loved all the designs and want to help us improve as we progress through 
other challenges this year.”
The teams reviewed the scorecards silently, handing them back and forth 
between team members.
“Please let me know if you have any questions or if there is anything that you 
don’t understand,” Mrs. Frisch said.
AJ and Missy scanned their scorecard and read the comments.
“Great, fresh look!”
“Modern and fun.”
“Excellent sewing.”
“Love the inspired reuse of fabrics!”
“OK. Moving on,” Paula announced as the chatter picked up around the room. 
“Fundraising.”
Morgan raised her hand. When Paula called on her, she explained the mending 
club idea. The students discussed how they could raise money and help other 
students not only to be more green but also to continue to wear their favorite 
pieces of clothing even though a repair was needed. After some debate, the 
students agreed that they could charge a small fee—one dollar for sewing on 
buttons and two dollars for sewing on patches and doing other minor repairs. 
The plan was to take in items to be repaired after school one day a week. 
Depending on how much work they received, the club would get together after 
school, do the sewing and patching, and return the items one week later. They 
hoped they could raise one hundred dollars over the course of the year that 
they could use for notions, small accessories and maybe an end-of-year party.
“I’ll make an online form so we can keep track of the mending club activities, 
like the work we get, who does the sewing and how much money we make,” 
said Morgan.
“I love that idea,” Mrs. Frisch commented. “Let’s make it official and vote  
on it!”
The club unanimously accepted the mending club fundraising idea, and Kate, 
Mahdavi and Danny agreed to get permission to use a corner of the library as

a receiving point and to set up the logistics, while AJ committed to promoting 
it around the school and online.
“Next, we want to run something by you, Mrs. Frisch,” Paula said “We were 
all so inspired by GT3 at today’s assembly. We think we can make a positive 
impact by using recycled materials for all of our challenges this year. What do 
you think?”
“Wow! What a great concept!” Mrs. Frisch said.
“Do you think we can use recycled materials for the alternative materials 
competition?” Paula asked.
“I do!” Mrs. Frisch responded excitedly. “That challenge will be next month, 
and the theme is Green-Piece. Teams will have to use items like recycled 
­plastic, cans, cardboard and paper to create designs. So, I think your concept 
can work for this and all the other challenges, too” Mrs. Frisch explained.
Danny raised his hand and Paula called on him. “Are you serious? We have 
to use garbage?” he asked with a look of disgust. “Really?” Danny had been 
onboard with the idea of reusing donated fabrics and repurposing old clothing, 
but the thought of using garbage had changed his mind.
“Well, yes,” Mrs. Frisch answered. “But the point of the alternative ­materials 
challenge is that you will need to transform the so-called garbage into a 
­wearable, lovely garment! What better way to recycle something than to 
­create something beautiful?”
“Hmmm,” Danny pondered the idea, not completely sold on it. He crossed his 
arms in front of his chest. “In any case, we’ll need to set up the ­mending station 
for accepting clothes needing repairs. I can work on that,” Danny ­commented. 
“I’ll have to do some more thinking on this whole garbage thang,” he stage-
whispered to Mahdavi with an extra twang of his accent.
“Maybe we can put out a box to take donations near the mending area?” he 
asked out loud.
“Oooh! Not too near,” Mahdavi commented, “that could be disastrous!”
“Gosh! You’re right!” Missy laughed at the thought of well-loved items coming 
in for repair but ending up remade into something completely new.

Chapter 6 | Garbage In ≠ Garbage Out
56
“OK,” said AJ. “I can put a call out on our SocialMe pages and add an announce-
ment on CHAPS-TV. I’m on it,” she concluded, making a note in her notebook.
The club discussed the challenges set for each of the competitions ahead. 
Then they shared and discussed designs, sketches and ideas until the meeting 
concluded.
Missy noticed her friends Megan and Kim passing by the art room. She 
­wondered where they were heading to in such a hurry. AJ poked Missy in the 
ribs, pointing at the opened door, and whispered, “Where are those two off 
to in such a rush?”
“No idea,” Missy said, though her curiosity was piqued.
When the meeting ended, Missy and AJ meandered down the hallway. When 
they neared Ms. Jameson’s classroom, they slowed down to listen at the open 
door. Peter Ng, the math club president, was speed-reading math problems 
and calling out student names for the answers.
Twenty-three point seven, Missy calculated. Then she heard a mathlete respond, 
“Twenty-three point seven.”
“Right,” said Peter who quickly went on to read the next problem and to call 
on another mathlete.
Six hours and twelve minutes.

“Six hours and twelve minutes,” came another response.
Missy answered a dozen questions correctly in her head before AJ tugged her 
elbow and whispered, “Why don’t you join them? I know you’ll love it!” AJ said.
“Nah,” said Missy walking toward the end of the hall. “It’s not for me.”
FASHION HACK: HOBO BAG HOW-TO
1.	
Find an old pair of jeans and an adult-sized belt that you want to 
remake (get permission from your parents!).
2.	
Cut off the legs at a slight angle, being careful to NOT cut the 
pockets on the back or the pocket liners of the front pockets.
3.	
Sew or staple the leg openings closed. To hide the seams, you 
can sew or staple from the inside of your bag by turning the piece 
inside-out.
4.	
Thread the belt through only the front and side loops (not the 
back), fasten the buckle and voila! You have a long strap to carry 
your bag. You could also use an old necktie or a thin scarf and 
knot it closed.
5.	
Add buttons or ribbons or use fabric paint to create a design on 
it. Have fun while you embellish your bag to make it your own!

Teasing Out the

All month long, students heard reminders to support the mathletes at their 
upcoming meet. Even though CHAPS was known for its high-caliber academics, 
all non-sport activities had to beg for supporters besides parents to show up to 
events. As the math event got closer and closer, the halls buzzed with chatter 
about the upcoming basketball game against their rivals from St. Mark’s Academy.

On Tuesday, Missy noticed another yellow note stuck on her locker.  
“Need advice. K + M,” Missy read. Missy scratched her head, at first thinking 
“K + M” might be a code to crack; then she realized that it was a message 
from Kim and Megan. She exchanged some books from her backpack and 
locker and headed around the corner to look for them. Missy passed by Paula 
who directed her to Ms. Jameson’s math classroom. When Missy got to them, 
Kim and Megan were sitting cross-legged by the door reviewing a long page of 
math problems. Missy had gone through elementary school with the two girls 
and had stayed friends with them even though they had different interests.
“Hey,” she said by way of greeting, and the two girls looked up.
“Oh! Missy! Please, please join the math club!” Megan said and pulled Missy 
down by her hand into a crouched position. “We really need more girls, and 
we could use your elite skills.”
Missy blushed and nearly toppled over. “Whoa,” she said and righted herself 
into a more stable position. “Your note said that you needed advice. How can 
I help? And don’t say by joining the math club!”
“Well,” Kim said, exchanging looks with Megan, “we think someone is acting 
like a bully on the math team. We don’t want to get anyone in trouble, but we 
don’t want to be bullied or watch others be bullied either.”
“OMG!” Missy said. “That’s awful! Why do you think I can help?”
Kim looked down at her hands and fidgeted with her pencil. “I just remember 
that you used to be bullied . . . I mean, I don’t want to make you feel bad, but I 
thought maybe you could tell us how you managed it and maybe what to do.”
Missy let go of Megan’s hand and leaned in closer to the girls. She suddenly 
felt dizzy and on the verge of tears. “I guess you’re right. I used to be called  
‘Missy-Math-Maker.’ It started with one boy calling me that and then ­others 
picked it up and repeated it and repeated it. And, then it kind of stuck.” Missy 
paused, thinking back to just last year and elementary school. Missy wrapped 
her arms together holding her stomach, which suddenly felt tight, as she 
remembered how upset she had been by all the teasing.
“It was really hard for me. It made me feel bad about myself just for being a 
good student. I know that’s weird, but . . .,” Missy’s voice trailed off, she did not 
want to admit that she still struggled with those memories and feelings.
“We remember,” Megan said. “I felt terrible for you.”
“Is someone calling you names?” Missy asked, turning the topic around so she 
didn’t feel so exposed. “You have to tell a teacher or a guidance counselor or 
the principal!” Missy exclaimed.
“I know it. Right?” Megan said. “That’s what I said we should do, too,” she 
looked at Kim who nodded in agreement. “It’s just that we don’t want to get 
anyone on the team in trouble.”

“If you’re talking about the math team, then you should start by talking to 
Ms. Jameson. I know she will listen and help you,” Missy advised. “You know 
CHAPS has a zero tolerance policy against bullying, right? If you tell her, I know 
she can solve the problem.”
The first bell rang and the girls gathered their books and papers and stood up. 
“Thanks, Missy!” Megan said. “I do feel better.”
“Yes,” Kim added. “I knew you could help us!”
The three girls exchanged quick hugs and then dashed to their first-period 
classes. Missy was glad she could help, though she felt sad remembering all the 
teasing that she had lived through.
FASHION HACK: T-SHIRT GROCERY SACK HOW-TO

By Wednesday, Ms. Jameson had graded their latest math assessment. She 
shared that three students had “aced” the test. Missy smiled to herself, 
­assuming she must be one of the top three. So, when Ms. Jameson handed her 
test back, Missy couldn’t believe the last page was covered in red ink. Since 
the instructions had directed the students to show their work, Missy had 
only received half-credit for the correct answers to the last three questions. 
Instead of a perfect score, Missy was looking at a bright red C circled in the 
upper right corner of her test. Tears stung her eyes as she held them back 
and calculated her numeric grade: Eight math questions in total. The first five were 
worth eight points each, and the last three were worth twenty points each, which 
gave her a score of 70 out of a possible 100.

Missy could feel the heat rising from her stomach to her cheeks. She read the 
note from Ms. Jameson at the top of the first page telling Missy to come see 
her after school.

Missy tried to clear her mind by taking a deep breath. She was torn. On the 
one hand, she didn’t want to be known as the geeky girl who always did well 
in math. She still really wanted to get away completely from the “Missy-Math-
Maker” nickname from elementary school; someday, she hoped to be known 
as Missy Maker—Fashionista. Maybe doing poorly on a math test was not so 
terrible after all. Maybe this was the year she would ditch that mean “Missy-
Math-Maker” moniker once and for all. So, why did she feel like such a failure?
At lunch, most students were talking about the upcoming basketball game 
including Missy’s friends. Missy wondered why so many hours were wasted 
reviewing the skills of star players and guessing how they would match up 
against the team from St. Mark’s. On the other hand, the only people talking 
fashion were a few of the Figures and Icons club members; similarly, Missy 
only heard one passing remark about the Math Olympics where Peter was 
­projecting a shut-out for the CHAPS team.
Missy looked for AJ in the crowded cafeteria. When she couldn’t find her, 
Missy sat with Danny and Mahdavi who cheered her up with their playful 
banter. Missy loved listening to the two of them talk about anything. Their 
unique accents were captivating. The two discussed their roles in the CHAPS 
Marching Band. They reviewed the marching band’s playlist and the timing as 
they would be playing both before the big game and ahead of the math meet 
to get everyone stoked up. Danny played the trumpet and Mahdavi ­performed 
with the color guard. They discussed the band’s marching ­routines and 
­concluded that the whole event would be great fun, if not a little crazy because 
of the double-booking. The Math Olympics competition was ­scheduled to 
­follow the basketball game. The two events were being held back-to-back 
on the CHAPS campus. Mahdavi passed Missy a sketch she and Danny had 
worked on that included a new idea for their school logo and a redesign of 
the marching band uniforms.
“Wow. These are so great,” Missy commented.
Toward the end of lunch, AJ slid in and squeezed next to Missy on the ­cafeteria 
bench. Her eyes were red and puffy. It looked as if she had been crying, though 
she kept her head down and focused on unwrapping her lunch.
“You OK?” Missy asked in a hushed voice so no one would overhear. Danny 
and Mahdavi continued chatting away and didn’t seem to notice that AJ had 
joined their table.
“Yeh. I’m fine,” AJ answered finally releasing a granola bar from its packaging, 
hoping to eat it before the bell rang.
“You don’t look fine,” Missy pressed.
“I don’t want to talk about it now,” AJ said stuffing a bite of granola into her 
mouth just as the bell rang.

All afternoon, Missy dreaded her meeting with Ms. Jameson. How could she 
explain what happened? How would a teacher ever understand the strange 
problem Missy had? How weird was it that she loved math but didn’t want 
anyone to know about it? Her classes went by in a daze, and at 3 PM, she 
gathered her books and stopped by her locker to pack up for the night, then 
headed to Ms. Jameson’s room.
Missy was surprised to see Megan and Kim coming out just as she was 
­entering. They exchanged quick greetings and Megan gave Missy a thumbs-up 
as she pulled the door closed on her way out. Missy guessed they had talked 
to Ms. Jameson about the bullying situation. Missy was glad she had helped 
them in some small way.
“Hi, Missy.” Ms. Jameson said and directed her to join her at the round table 
next to her desk. Missy shuffled over and sat down heavily, dropping her 
­backpack to the floor.
“Hi,” Missy replied and looked down at the table in front of her.
“So,” Ms. Jameson started, “it looks like you had some trouble on the test this 
week.”
“Uh,” Missy could not find any words. She fidgeted with her hands for 
­something to do.
“It’s clear that you’re a very smart girl. I know you can do these math ­problems. 
After all, you did get all the answers correct. You just did not follow the clearly 
stated directions.” Ms. Jameson paused to give Missy time to comment. When 
Missy remained silent, she continued, “I could not give you full credit when you 
didn’t show how you worked through those complex problems. It’s great that 
you arrived at the correct answers, but I have no way of knowing HOW you 
got there. Do you understand?”
“Yes,” Missy said without looking up. She could feel heat rising from her 
­stomach and tears filling her eyes again. She thought she might cry if she said 
any more. So, she kept her eyes focused on her two hands now resting on 
the table.

“Now, it’s just one test. It’s not going to ruin your whole year. Still, I really need 
to see your work. You need to show how you are addressing the problem 
and what math concepts you are applying. OK? I need to see that you are not 
just guessing.”
“OK,” Missy said still staring at her hands.
“Please look at me,” Ms. Jameson said.
That was all it took, as Missy turned her gaze from her hands to Ms. Jameson, 
the tears started flowing. “OK. I get it. I do. I just lost track of the time. I did 
all the math in my head and just wrote down my results. I knew I should show 
my work, but the bell already rang and you were calling for us to turn in the 
exams.”
Ms. Jameson seemed prepared for the tears and handed Missy a tissue box. 
“Wow. You answered all three questions in a matter of minutes. That’s 
­amazing, Missy! You really are a gifted young lady.”
Missy dabbed her eyes with the tissue then blew her nose. Right now she 
didn’t feel very gifted, and she was out of words.
“Alright then, I know you will manage your time better and follow the 
­directions more closely in the future. For your homework, please take the 
time to work through those problems again, this time showing your work and 
your calculations,” Ms. Jameson concluded and handed Missy another tissue. 
“You might also consider joining the math club, kiddo. You have some special 
skills.”
Missy shook her head at the comment. She composed herself and grabbed 
her backpack. She threw out her tissues in the garbage pail by Ms. Jameson’s 
desk, then she walked to the exit. Missy took a deep breath and opened the 
door to find AJ standing at the ready about to knock. They exchanged looks 
of surprise as Missy exited and AJ entered the classroom.
“Come in, AJ,” Ms. Jameson called.
Missy thought about waiting by the door, but didn’t want AJ to think she was 
spying on her. Missy thought she would check out what the mathletes were up 
to and then try to catch up to AJ before getting her bus home.

Slipping into the mezzanine of the dark auditorium was easier than Missy 
expected. The only lights lit up a small area on the stage where a table and five 
chairs stood. Eleven students spread out in the front center two rows. Missy 
recognized a few friends including Megan and Kim.
Fifty feet back from the stage and one story high, Missy wondered why she couldn’t 
hear better as she calculated the speed of sound and the distance it would have 
to travel to arrive at her ears. Peter paced in front of the table on the stage. 
He was saying something, but from her elevation, Missy could only catch an 
occasional word. “Win . . . Olympics . . . CHAPS . . .” Missy heard Peter saying.
The math team had been meeting and practicing for weeks. CHAPS was 
­hosting the Math Olympics the next weekend. Missy had stayed away until 
now, but the excitement of the upcoming competition had her friends buzzing 
though not many people really knew what it was all about. Missy’s curiosity 
had finally won out. She wanted to find out more. She took a seat in the 
­second row of the mezzanine and leaned forward to see if she could hear any 
better. Suddenly she heard the clickety-click-squeak of a nearby door opening 
up. She slouched down in her seat so she wouldn’t be seen.

Christopher Jones stepped to the front of the mezzanine and waved his hands 
toward the people on the stage below. He shouted, “Are you talking? Totally 
cannot hear you up here!”
Chris was practically an icon at CHAPS. He was an eighth grader who 
had found his calling early with the Audio-Visual Club and managed to first 
­convince the AV department and then the CHAPS school board to upgrade 
to a modern digital system. He led the efforts to fundraise for it, and he had 
created a CHAPS-TV channel where the AV Club members anchored school 
news and shared school announcements every day during homeroom. And, 
on top of that, Missy thought he was the cutest boy in the school!
Chris had brown eyes. Missy noticed on CHAPS-TV how they sparkled with 
golden highlights. His light brown hair was long and usually swept back from 
his face when he was on camera, but off camera it flopped across his forehead 
and partially hid his eyes. Missy got the sense that Chris wanted to be hiding 
behind his long hair. He looked to be about five and one-half feet tall, which 
made him about six and one-half inches taller than Missy. The perfect boy-to-girl 
height ratio, she imagined. Under other circumstances, Missy might have intro-
duced ­herself or at least said “Hey,” but as it was, she was holding her breath, 
trying to disappear completely and melt into the auditorium floor.
Suddenly, a high-pitched screech pierced the room, interrupting Missy’s 
thoughts. She nearly jumped out of her crouched position. Missy covered her 
mouth because she thought she had gasped.
“OK!” Chris yelled. “Now, Peter, turn on your mic!”
Missy saw Peter fiddle with a black box pinned on his belt. Then, “How’s that? 
Test 1-2-3. Test. Test,” Peter’s voice echoed through the auditorium.
“Great,” said Chris turning to give a thumbs-up signal to someone who must 
have been above and behind Missy. “We’ll get the rest of the mics on the table 
and then you’ll be good to go.”
Chris left the mezzanine and two minutes later showed up on the stage below. 
Missy sat up taller in her seat relieved that she had not been discovered. 
She took a deep breath. Missy turned to look back at who or what Chris 
was ­signaling to and noticed a light shining toward the stage from a small 
square hole at the back of the mezzanine. Then she saw some movement and 
guessed that a few students must be up there working the AV equipment. She 
blushed, wondering if she had been seen.
Peter returned to pacing and now Missy heard every word over the speakers. 
“Like I was saying, we’ve got a good team and with me as your leader, we’ll 
crush this tournament!”

Missy rolled her eyes. Peter was great at math, but winning would be a team 
effort. She was rooting for her friends, but Peter’s comments just rubbed her 
the wrong way. She wondered if that’s what had bothered Megan and Kim.
“Thanks, Peter,” Ms. Jameson appeared below and stepped forward to climb 
the stairs up to the stage. “Isn’t this exciting?” she asked turning toward the 
other students. Missy considered that Ms. Jameson’s meeting with AJ must be 
over, but she stayed in her seat to hear some more.
“Go CHAPS!” Peter pumped his fist in the air, but the other math club 
­members didn’t seem to be as enthusiastic. Missy wondered why.
“Hmmm. I can see you’re all a bit nervous,” said Ms. Jameson. “No need for 
that! You are all great mathletes and to prove it, why don’t we warm up with 
some times tables.” She pointed to the first row at Kim and said, “Come on 
up, Kim! Lead us in twelves.” Kim came up the stairs nearest her and made 
her way to the center of the stage. Chris appeared from backstage and handed 
her a microphone. He switched it on and she started, “Twelve, twenty-four, . . .”  
and the math club members joined in.
When Kim got to one hundred forty-four, Ms. Jameson said, “Great! Team,  
how are we feeling?” and the club members clapped and cheered. “OK, 
­everyone on your feet!” The team stood up. “Peter lead us in fifteens.”
Peter, happy to be back in the spotlight, shouted, “Fifteen, thirty,” and the club 
joined in.
When they got to three hundred, Ms. Jameson said, “Perfect! Now that the 
mics are set up and the stage is set, let’s divide into two teams and have a math 
scrimmage.” She used her arm to divide the mathletes into two teams and 
they all climbed onstage, taking seats at the two tables. Ms. Jameson stood in 
the middle with her back to the audience.
Ms. Jameson explained that the judges and the announcer would be in the 
front row for the actual competition. Mathletes were allowed to have one 
pencil and one notecard in front of them to use as scratch paper. On the stage, 
a giant countdown clock would face the competitors. They would be allotted 
thirty seconds for each problem. In the finals, they would be given a full minute 
to answer the questions. Twelve teams would compete in rounds, with the 
winning teams advancing to the next rounds until only three teams remained. 
The last three teams would compete for first place.
“Let’s run through a series of problems,” Ms. Jameson said and began quizzing 
the teams, using her smartphone to time them.
Missy whispered the responses to herself seconds before the mathletes below.
“Excuse me?” a voice called from behind her. When Missy didn’t respond, 
Chris came around and tapped her on the shoulder. She jumped.

“Hi. Sorry,” Chris said. “The mezzanine is closed. You can watch the team 
practice from the main auditorium,” he said. “By the way, how’d you get those 
answers so quick? I heard you answer before I heard anyone on the team 
respond.”
Where had he come from? Missy had been so absorbed by the scrimmage, she 
had not heard any door opening or any footsteps approaching.
“Uh. Oh. Um,” Missy stuttered, trying to find her words, suddenly feeling 
­nauseous. “Oh. OK. Thanks,” she finally said, standing up and brushing past him 
while nearly hitting him with her backpack. She quick-stepped her way up the 
aisle and out the door. She rounded the corner and ducked into the ­nearest 
girls’ bathroom, leaving Chris standing in the mezzanine looking after her.
Missy stood by the bathroom sink and looked in the mirror. Her cheeks were 
bright red—just like the C on her math test. She had splashed some water on 
her face when she heard a sob coming from one of the stalls.
“Hello?” Missy called out.
“M-m-missy? Is that you?” AJ replied while trying to contain her sobs.
“Oh my goodness! AJ, it’s me!” Missy answered. “Come out and tell me what’s 
going on!”
AJ came out of the stall and washed her hands and face at the sink. Missy 
tore off some paper towels from a nearby dispenser and handed them to her 
friend.
“Oh, Missy! It’s awful. I failed that math test. I don’t know how it happened. 
I just panicked. I thought I knew the material. I studied so hard, but I totally 
flaked and I didn’t even get to the last question,” AJ said in a rush. “I didn’t want 
to tell you before because I know it’s so easy for you and I’m so embarrassed.”
Missy pulled AJ in for a hug and then spilled her guts. She confessed how she 
had lost track of time and flubbed on the last three questions. Soon the two 
girls were consoling each other and each began to feel better.
Suddenly AJ’s face changed and she started to cry again. “But that’s not the 
worst of it!” AJ cried. “My dad said if I can’t keep my grades up, I have to 
drop all my extracurricular activities—including the fashion club and soccer!”  
AJ ended on a sob.
Missy’s stomach turned. How could she keep her friend from failing? How 
could she help AJ stay in the fashion club and keep playing soccer?
“We can fix this!” Missy promised. “Remember last year? We met in the 
­morning to study and worked on homework together after school? We can 
do that again! I can help you with math and you can help me stay focused and 
not get too distracted on fashion and our designs.”

AJ smiled, “You would do that for me?”
“Of course!” Missy exclaimed, “You’re my best friend and my design partner—
we need each other!”
As the two exited the girls’ bathroom, Missy recounted her run-in with Chris 
Jones. AJ raised her eyes, puckered her lips, and made kissing noises. “Love at 
first sight!” AJ declared and both the girls giggled.
Time was not her friend these days! Missy expected to complete her designs 
and still get her homework done long before Dad announced “Lights out!” 
with finality.
This was the third night this week that she had resorted to using her 
­smartphone to light up her textbooks under her covers. How had she gotten 
behind? Why was she so tired? Missy thought back to what she had been doing 
these last weeks. Schoolwork, house chores, helping AJ, and . . . Designing! Oh 
designing was so much fun, and so easy to get lost in.
In her mind’s eye, Missy’s latest fashions high-stepped down the runway, the 
last one waving and entreating her forward. Missy followed the dresses, skirts 
and rompers across the stage and down the runway. She stopped short when 
she noticed that as the garments reached the end of the runway, rather than 
pivoting and turning back, they stepped off the edge and exploded into tiny 
numbers. The numbers rose up before her like a colorful plume of smoke 
and swirled around her making her feel shaky and dizzy. When the numbers 
cleared up, she saw Chris standing and applauding in the front row. One plus 
one equals perfection.
Missy awoke to G-ma’s gentle shaking. “Wakey, wakey, Miss Melissa Merry 
Maker. The day’s awaiting!”
Disoriented and groggy, Missy awoke and asked, “G-ma, what time is it?”
“Time to get up and start the day, dearie,” G-ma said. “Your father called you 
twice before he left. Now you’ll need to hurry if you want to catch the bus.”

Missy dressed in a fury, forgetting to check her fashion calendar or her social 
media feeds until she stopped by her mirror. Despite her brain fog, and ­racing 
around, Missy thought she looked pretty good. She had grabbed a pair of 
striped blue on blue leggings and a long gray t-shirt embellished with tiny 
round cut-outs on the neckline, hem and shoulders. She had experimented 
with a grommet-making tool and loved the effect. She added a white belt with 
a giant metal buckle and cinched it just below her waist. Then she tied her hair 
up in a quick side braid. Missy snapped a selfie and posted it with the hashtags 
OOTD and Never2Late4Fashion. She picked up her backpack, and ran down 
the stairs. G-ma handed her a granola bar as Missy passed through the kitchen 
and headed out the door to catch the bus to school.
Tired as she was, Missy felt like the day swept past her. Only AJ even noticed 
the side braid that replaced Missy’s usual ponytail or pigtails. They spent lunch 
drilling math concepts and reviewing their tests to understand where each 
had made mistakes. AJ was feeling better and had signed up for extra help 
sessions with Ms. Jameson too. Missy was sure AJ could turn things around and 
be able to stay involved in her clubs and activities.
Missy had hoped to run into Chris in the hallway between classes just to say 
hi and to apologize for lurking in the mezzanine, but she never saw him once 
all day—not even on CHAPS-TV that morning. Meanwhile, all her classmates 
talked about was the basketball game to be held Saturday. Missy understood 
the excitement of an impending competition and hoped the whole school 
would one day be just as excited about the fashion club’s meets too!
Missy returned home that evening after an extra-long homework session with 
AJ. She had missed the late bus and ended up walking the two-point-four 
miles home. She dropped her pack by the front door and snapped a selfie. 
Typing hashtag homeatlast and posting that with her picture, Missy climbed 
the five stairs from the foyer and was met by G-ma, her dad and Ms. Jameson 
sitting in her family’s living room.
Taken aback, Missy exclaimed, “Whoa! It’s not my birthday. What’s going on?”
Mr. Maker stepped forward. “Missy, we are here for you.”
Missy stopped in her tracks. She hadn’t yet told her father about her recent 
math test grade. She suddenly felt betrayed that Ms. Jameson had gone behind 
her back directly to her father. Even though she was a family friend to Missy’s 
dad, it did not seem fair that Ms. Jameson would blab to Missy’s father and then 
lounge on the sofa in Missy’s living room.
Recognizing fear on Missy’s face, Ms. Jameson quickly spoke up, “So, I ran 
into your dad at the supermarket this afternoon, and I mentioned that the 
­mathletes urgently need a stand-in for our math competition on Saturday.”

Relieved on some levels, Missy sank into the recliner nearest her and kicked 
off her trainers nearly hitting Pi with one of them. Pi whipped Missy’s legs 
with his tail in rebuke. Missy scooped up Pi and put the cat between herself 
and everyone else. She tucked her legs under her bottom and sat in a strange 
contortion on the leather rocking recliner petting Pi with her cheek as she 
clutched him to her chest.
“Is something going on?” Mr. Maker asked looking suspiciously from Missy to 
Ms. Jameson.
“Are you OK, dearie? You look a little pale,” G-ma added.
Missy imagined she was being interrogated under a single bare lightbulb. In 
her mind, she could hear the tick-tock of an old-fashioned clock counting the 
seconds before her imminent doom. “Um. I don’t know,” Missy answered. Pi 
escaped Missy’s grasp and jumped down to the floor. “Dad, I-I was going to tell 
you about my math test. Then, well, with everyone here, I just thought I was 
in trouble or something.”
“You are not in trouble!” Ms. Jameson said. “But the math team is! We need a 
minimum of twelve people for competition. Since one student dropped out, 
just today, I need to find someone who can jump right in and be successful  
on the team. I thought of you and how quickly you can do mental math.  
It wouldn’t be so urgent if CHAPS were not also hosting the event. Without 
twelve students, we will have to forfeit the competition and still host it. But, if 
I can find a student to join the team, we can avoid that embarrassment.”
Missy resisted asking who had dropped out. Her mind wandered to her 
­conversation with Megan and Kim. Did one of them drop out? Did the bully 
get called out? She pictured the two rows in the auditorium and tried to guess 
who from the team was gone.
“So, Missy, what do you think?” Missy’s dad asked, pulling her focus back to the 
discussion. “I know you said you didn’t want to join before. And what were 
you saying about a math test?”
“Oh that was nothing,” Ms. Jameson supplied. “Just rushing and not reading 
directions. Missy and I agreed she would read and follow instructions more 
carefully from now on.”
“Oh. So, Missy, do you think you can help the math team this weekend?  
It sounds like they really need you,” Mr. Maker asked.
G-ma walked over to Missy and patted her shoulder. “You don’t have to do 
this. It is your decision,” she said.
Missy rocked back and forth and fidgeted with her hair considering the 
­proposal. “I suppose I can help out this weekend, but I don’t want to commit 
for the whole year. Is that OK?”

Ms. Jameson clapped her hands. “Yes! That will be a huge help to the team. 
And, who knows, you might like it—and you would be welcome to stay on!”
One hundred percent chance of staying on the math team minus one hundred 
­percent of interest, meant there was zero percent likelihood of joining the math club 
on a permanent basis. Missy promised that she would help out just this once, 
and Ms. Jameson explained how the competition worked and what to expect 
over the remaining days leading up to the event.
MATH HACK: SHORTCUT FOR MULTIPLES OF 11
For this example, let’s multiply: 11 x 75 = ?
1.	
Add the digits of the number that is being multiplied by 11.
7 + 5 = 12
2.	
Place this sum between the 7 and 5.
7 ( 12 ) 5
3.	
If the sum exceeds 9 like it does in this case, we must carry the 
one over and add it to the digit on the left. In this case, that means 
the 7 becomes an 8, the 2 remains in the center, and 5 is the  
last digit.
11 x 75 = 825

Missy finally made it up to her room. She felt exhausted and overwhelmed. 
She spread out her homework and books across the comforter on her bed. 
She read the flyer from Ms. Jameson with details about the math club and 
Saturday’s competition. Then she flicked the blue piece of paper describing 
the math event like a Frisbee. It flew the length of her bed and then floated 
down to land upon her pillow near the end of her bed just as Pi entered the 
room. Pi surveyed the available space on the bed and leapt up. He pranced 
around, stepping on all the papers and books on Missy’s bed, then nudged 
away the flyer with his nose and settled himself on Missy’s pillow. Missy eased 
herself onto the bed and used her phone to snap candid shots of Pi. Pi cleaned 
his fur and ignored Missy completely.
Missy slithered back down to floor level trying not to disturb Pi. She knelt on 
the floor with her elbows leaning on the foot of her bed. Something stirred 
inside her and she made her decision. She felt excited and worried.
Missy texted AJ, Megan and Kim. U There?
YEP AJ responded. Heading out to soccer practice.
I’m here :). Megan texted adding her usual sideways smile, opting to never 
use the graphical version of the emoji.
Missy sent her three closest friends a picture of Pi with the math club flyer 
by his front paws to warm up. Then Missy posed with Pi positioned in the 
background and Missy peeking over her math notebook, which was covered 
in math formulas and fashion doodles. She snapped the selfie and texted it to 
all of her friends—mathletes and fashionistas alike. Missy wondered what the 
other Figures and Icons would say. AJ was her best friend, after all, and always 
supported her.

Guess who’s subbing on the math team this weekend!?
Wow! That’s super. AJ answered with a series of smiley faces. Catch you 
after practice.
Kim finally responded with a row of happy emojis and a photo of her own 
thumbs-up.
You’ll be great! Danny texted along with a close-up photo of his own face 
winking into the camera, which spurred a round of other selfies imitating 
emojis. Danny had a way of cheering Missy up, no matter the situation.
REALLY?!? Mahdavi jumped in. Our design star is a math whiz too? 
Who knew!
Satisfied and feeling more at ease about her decision, Missy held her phone 
out and posed for a selfie with her tongue sticking out and responded to all.

Super! Kate answered. Missy laughed, knowing Kate was responding to her 
original news and certainly not to her last selfie. Kate was too buttoned up 
for that.
Missy smiled, relieved that her friends did not call her out for being a freak and 
a math geek. Their responses genuinely seemed to support her participation 
in the upcoming math competition.
Abruptly overcome with excitement, Missy abandoned her phone and her 
homework and headed to her closet. Finding the perfect outfit for the Math 
Olympics suddenly seemed more important than anything else. Six pants, four 
skirts and twelve tops means one hundred and twenty possible outfits!
Missy pulled out her favorite pieces and tossed them on top of the books on 
her bed causing Pi to hastily take his leave. She arranged three combinations, 
added accessories and shoes, and snapped pictures of each. She narrowed it 
down to two pants’ outfits and one skirt outfit to choose from.
Missy pictured the auditorium and the table arrangement and quickly tossed 
the skirt to the floor beside her bed. From the mezzanine, she knew you 
couldn’t see any legs beneath the table, but she wasn’t sure about the view from 
the main auditorium to the stage. She rearranged the tops and ­accessories 
and eliminated one top, adding it to the skirt on the floor. She retook her 
photos and posted them with the hashtags possibleOOTDs and mathfashion.

G-ma knocked on the open door. “Really cute,” she commented on the outfits 
as she stepped inside Missy’s room. G-ma looked at Missy standing in the 
middle of her bedroom surrounded by books, papers and items of clothing 
and looking disheveled herself. “Miss Melissa, you feeling OK?” she asked.
G-ma stepped over a heap of papers by the door and sat down on the chair 
beside Missy’s bed. Pi strolled back in and weaved himself through her legs. 
G-ma petted the cat who promptly pointed his nose in the air and squeezed 
himself under Missy’s bed.

“Well, then!” G-ma said to Pi, patiently waiting for Missy to reply.
Missy looked up from her phone and noticed the mess she had created in her 
bedroom. “Sorry for the mess,” Missy said, scooping up papers and clothes 
and dropping them on the desk chair behind her.
“I’m ok, G-ma,” Missy started. “I want to help Ms. Jameson and the mathletes. 
I really do. I just . . .”
“What is it?” G-ma prompted her and patted the bed next to her chair. Missy 
sat down heavily on the bed.
G-ma raised her eyebrows as papers flew up from the bed. “Whoa!” she 
laughed.
“I don’t want to be a geek anymore!” Missy blurted out then jumped up again. 
She busied herself with picking up the outfits and accessories and hanging 
them back in her closet.
“Oh! Missy! You are a smart, generous and loving young lady,” G-ma said.
Missy stopped in her tracks and shook her head. “ARG! Please don’t say that 
I’m smart,” Missy complained. “I don’t want to be called smart. I just want to 
be me.” Missy picked up a shirt from the floor and a hanger from her bed and 
put the two together. She stacked a few hanging garments and lay them over 
her arms and started across the room.
G-ma stood up and crossed the room. She caught Missy in a hug as  
Missy walked back empty-handed from her closet toward her bed. “Oh, 
dearie, being smart is being you. You are a great problem-solver and a gifted 
designer. All that is something to be proud of; it’s not anything to hide or shy 
away from.”
Missy hugged G-ma back, then pulled away and went back to her work tidying 
up her room, putting clothes away and avoiding eye contact. She thought if she 
looked at her grandmother, she might cry. Eight steps from bed to closet. Two 
hands, two arms, two shoulders. Four trips to the closet and back. Sixty-four steps.

Missy looked at her feet, counting her paces. “You have to say that, G-ma. 
Besides, you’re not in middle school,” Missy said, nearly breathless from pacing, 
bending and picking up articles of clothing.
“You are right about that, dearie. I have not been in school for a long time, 
but I do know how you feel,” G-ma said. “It’s hard to be a unicorn. Not 
everyone appreciates the unique abilities and the special skills you have. They 
may be jealous or afraid, but that should never ever stop you from being the 
wonderful you that you are.” G-ma lifted Missy’s chin to look her in the eyes. 
“You are my unicorn,” she said and kissed Missy’s cheek.
Missy sat cross-legged on the floor and put her head in her hands. She felt 
dizzy and confused. She never thought of herself as a unicorn before, but she 
loved that image. “I am a unicorn,” Missy repeated to herself.
G-ma put her hand on Missy’s shoulder. “You should not hide your best parts 
to try to make other people like you,” G-ma said. “The world needs all your 
special talents!”
As if on cue, Pi exploded into Missy’s lap, sprawling across her legs and batting 
at Missy’s arms with his paws. G-ma leaned over and ruffled Missy’s hair. “Your 
dad ordered pizza for dinner,” she said. “Should be here in twenty minutes. 
OK?” She patted Missy reassuringly and walked to the door. G-ma left Missy’s 
room, and Pi leapt off Missy’s lap and followed G-ma out.

Missy stretched out on her bedroom floor and imagined a combined math and 
fashion competition where each model had to solve math problems at the end 
of the runway. She pictured Morgan and Kate dressed to the nines followed 
by Peter and some of the other mathletes, who in Missy’s mind’s eye were not 
nearly as fashionable. Each student paraded their way to a microphone at the 
end of the runway where they were asked to solve a complex math problem. 
When they answered correctly, the mathletes turned and walked backstage. 
She giggled at the thought.
Missy opened her eyes, sat up and started reviewing the math worksheets 
that Ms. Jameson had given her to prepare for the competition. Dressed to the 
nines . . . Missy thought about the expression and laughed. Fashion and math 
intermingled. No wonder she loved both so well!
MATH HACK: DIVISION TRICKS
Divide large numbers at top speed!
3  Divisible by 3 if the sum of the digits of the number are divisible by 3 (492 is 
because 4 + 9 + 2 equals 15, which is divisible by 3).
4  Divisible by 4 if the last two digits of the number are divisible by 4 (2676 is 
because 76 is a multiple of 4).
6  Divisible by 6 if the rules of divisibility for 2 and 3 work for that number (804).
9  Divisible by 9 if the sum of digits of the number are divisible by 9 (5922 because  
5 + 9 + 2 + 2 equals 18, which is divisible by 9).
12  Divisible by 12 if the rules of divisibility for 3 and 4 work for that number (1068 
is because 1 + 0 + 6 +8 = 15, which is divisible by 3, and 68 is a multiple of 4).

Friday evaporated in a haze. As Missy donned her final mathfashion OOTD—a 
mash-up of a blue t-shirt emblazoned with gold-sequined math symbols, the 
denim skirt she created from jeans’ pockets, paired with leggings and her 
­favorite black trainers—she tried to recall where she had spent her time on 
Friday. Between cramming for the competition and scrimmaging with the math 
team, all she could remember was the excitement building up and then just 
waking up today and feeling slightly out of sorts.
“Missy? You ready?” Mr. Maker called from the hallway. “We should get going!”
Missy was ready. She checked her look and re-tied her ponytail in a position 
lower than usual. Her ponytail hung at the back of her head right below the 
equator where she imagined the Indian Ocean might be. She thought the low 
ponytail made her appear more serious and ready for the competition. One 
quick selfie and she was off. “Coming, Dad!” she shouted as she closed her 
bedroom door behind her.

Missy hopped into the front seat and buckled her seat belt. Ever since she 
started middle school, Missy had wanted to ride up front. Mr. Maker winked 
at her. “Nice try, kiddo. Back seat, please. When you reach five feet tall, we’ll 
negotiate. Until then, the back seat is safest.” Mr. Maker smiled and waited for 
Missy to exit.
“Oh, Dad,” Missy whined as she complied. Missy unbuckled and opened the 
front door. She settled into the back seat, buckled up and looked up into the 
rearview mirror. “Okay. Ready, Dad.”
“We’re off!” Mr. Maker declared and started the car.

In the car, Missy posted her selfie to her SocialMe timeline and felt a twang 
in her heart when she read a post on her page: CHAPS Mathletes make 
way—Missy-Math-Maker saves the day! Missy had worked hard to 
­separate herself from that name. She wanted to be known as a fashionista, 
not a math geek.
That post was followed by replies from her friends.
Go Missy! said Kate.
You got this, girl, from Danny.
Missy, you are a math wizard, said Mahdavi.
CHAPS for the win! from Paula.
Missy was torn. The use of the Missy-Math-Maker nickname she had been 
bullied with all through elementary school felt like an assault. She had worked 
so hard this year to escape that moniker. On the other hand, the post was 
praising her. Wasn’t it? Still, her spirits lifted and she felt exalted by her friends. 
“Hmmm. Missy-Math-Maker: M-cubed,” Missy said, embracing the dreaded 
label and rebranding herself in mathematical terms.
Ready! Willing! And able! Missy responded and signed M3 then she turned 
off her phone and concentrated on the ride through her town. She counted 
the street signs and imagined mixing them all up. She wondered if returning 
residents would still be able to find their way home.
It was a quick ride to the CHAPS campus early on a Saturday morning. 
Normally, the ride to school took more than thirty minutes. On school days, 
the roads were clogged with traffic and her school bus made eight stops along 
the way.
“Wow,” Missy commented. She looked at her phone to confirm the time.  
“We got here in twelve minutes!”
Mr. Maker winked at Missy. “No delays today,” he replied. Mr. Maker was 
dressed as usual in a button-down shirt, bow tie and jeans. Missy thought of 
that as her dad’s uniform, though on the weekends, he wore sneakers instead 
of loafers. That was his casual look.
Missy wondered if her sense of style had anything to do with her dad’s unique 
daily uniform. He always left the house put together and even his most casual 
outfits included a button-down shirt and a bow tie. Missy gathered up her 
papers and pencil from her seat taking her time as her dad parked the car. 
Missy looked in the rearview mirror and waited to catch her dad’s eye. Missy 
felt a fluttering in her stomach and caught her breath. “Dad? I’m a bit nervous.”

Mr. Maker turned around in his seat. “Here’s a question: Why is six afraid of 
seven?” he asked.
“Huh?” Missy responded with a confused look on her face. “What? Dad, what 
are you talking about?”
“Because . . .” Mr. Maker dragged out the word to build suspense before 
responding, “seven ATE nine! HAH!”
Missy rolled her eyes at her father and smiled in spite of herself.
“You’ll be great, kiddo!” Mr. Maker said. “A little nervous energy makes you 
sharp. Just have fun and remember this: math is awesome and so is Missy 
Maker!”
Missy repeated that mantra under her breath as she opened the car door and 
headed toward the auditorium. “Math is awesome and so is Missy Maker. Math 
is awesome and so is Missy Maker. Math is awesome and so is Missy-MATH-
Maker!” Missy chanted to herself.
Mr. Maker and Missy got out of the car together. “I’ll meet you after the 
­competition,” Mr. Maker said. Missy noticed the school parking lot was filling 
up with buses and cars filled with students from other schools. Students were 
looking around trying to figure out where to go to register for the event.
They approached the side door to the building, Danny came running out, 
calling to Missy. He was wearing a band uniform jacket and gym shorts with 
flip-flops. Mr. Maker kissed Missy on the cheek.
“Whoa!” Mr. Maker said as Danny approached them.
“Hey, Mr. Maker,” Danny said.
“Hey to you, Danny.”
Danny stopped and looked Missy over from head to toe. He snapped his 
­fingers in a Z configuration. “You look snaz-zy! And, thank heaven you’re 
here!” Danny said, his southern accent exaggerated to the fullest extent.  
“I was waiting for you, Missy! We’ve had a wardrobe malfunction and I know 
you can help.”
“I’ll see you after the competition,” Mr. Maker told Missy and headed to the 
main entrance. Danny took Missy’s hand and pulled her into the building and 
down the hall toward the band room.
When they entered the band room, Missy saw articles of clothing and 
pieces of band uniforms strewn all over. The band director was in a tizzy 
­directing students and tuning instruments. He was so busy reviewing the band 
­choreography and marching drills that he barely noticed the chaos in the room.  
The director had on a full band uniform including a tall stovepipe hat, which 
seemed ready to fall from its perch if not for the chin strap holding it in place.

Other band members were in various states of dress, some were playing their 
instruments, and others were shouting to each other trying to locate a full 
uniform. They looked so motley and mismatched. Suddenly, Missy’s jitters 
were gone. She loved the chaos and clutter; it magically calmed her nerves.
Mahdavi ran past them and out the door. She wore a white tank top tucked 
into her black band uniform pants.
Thomas Barker, Missy’s neighbor and friend since the first grade, wore a full 
uniform, with the red and gold jacket hanging open. With only two buttons, 
there was no way to keep it closed. No two band members seemed to be 
dressed alike. Clearly, the band was in trouble.
“How can I help?” Missy asked, just as Mahdavi came back into the room 
­pulling Megan and Kim beside her. Megan’s hair was braided from the left side 
above her ear all the way across her forehead and tucked in place in the back 
of her right ear, wrapping her head like a crown. She wore black jeans and a 
pink t-shirt with heart-shaped polka dots. Kim was dressed like a banker, Missy 
thought, taking in the black suit and light blue blouse, and her hair was pulled 
back in a neat, low ponytail anchored just north of Antarctica.
“I found them!” Mahdavi, smiling from ear to ear, said to Danny and Missy. 
Megan and Kim looked shocked as they took in the scene. Kim let go of 
Mahdavi’s hand and covered her ears.
“Our new band uniforms were supposed to be here in time for today, but 
they never arrived,” Danny explained, shouting over the cacophony. “Our band 
director was sure they would be here on time since the uniform company 
assured us they would be here this morning. We just found out that the 
plane they were on got delayed. Now, they say the uniforms won’t get here 
until NEXT week!” Danny took a deep breath and continued, “Anyway, we 
never took out these old uniforms before today and we’re finding they are in 
a ­terrible state—missing buttons, broken zippers, moth holes and stains. And 
we don’t even think there are enough for everyone.”
“What does the band director think?” Megan asked.
“He expected us to wear new uniforms,” Mahdavi answered, spinning around 
to show off her half uniform, “I had on a jean skirt and fringed t-shirt. Most of 
us came dressed in really casual clothes. But he said that we could just wear 
what we came in.”
Danny made a face. “We just don’t think that looks very nice.” Danny put his 
arm around Mahdavi, “So, we’re trying to figure out what to do!”
“OMG!” Kim covered her face with her hands to avoid looking at the 
­commotion around the room. “I can’t even look.” She cleared her throat, then 
said, “I’m really sorry about all this, but we have the math competition starting 
in an hour. And I think we need to focus on that.”

Chapter 10 | All the Right Angles

Surprised by Kim’s comments, Megan, Missy, Danny and Mahdavi stared blankly 
at her.
“Oh-kaaaay,” said Danny crossing his arms and sticking out his hip. “We just 
thought y’all might wanna help.” Danny reached out to Missy and Mahdavi. 
“We are the Figures and Icons!”
“Of course!” Missy responded, looking away from Kim and back around the 
room. “Let’s see what we have to work with.” Missy walked around the band 
room and took a quick inventory. She counted the number of band ­members 
and the individual uniform pieces. Surely, they could find a solution using 
the pieces they had! Missy stepped up to the band director and whispered 
­something in his ear. The band director nodded and Missy walked back to 
Danny and her friends.
“Danny, can you gather up all the uniforms and put all the usable pieces into 
piles?” Missy directed. “And, Mahdavi, please find out who wore jeans or pants 
today.”
In a matter of minutes, with the help of the band members, Missy and her 
friends had sorted all the band pants, jackets and hats and found they had 
eleven complete uniforms plus three jackets that needed only minor repairs 
and could be worn as-is today. The other pieces were too tattered to be 
wearable.
“If each band member who wore jeans only wears a band jacket and ­everyone 
who wore shorts or skirts just wears the pants, you can stretch out the 
usable items and you’ll still look like one band with matching uniforms,”  
Missy remarked. “Fourteen jackets and eleven pants will more than cover 
twenty-two people.”

Danny’s eyes bugged out. “Really?!” he said. The girls looked at his current 
state of dress and giggled. “You will really need to wear the band pants,” 
Mahdavi concluded.
“Well, you’ll have to figure out who has appropriate pants and shirts and then 
shuffle things around and maybe trade some items between you,” Missy said. 
“But I think you can do it!”
“Math to the rescue!” Ms. Jameson stepped into the room and approached 
the mathletes. She wore a navy blue pant suit with a crisp white blouse and 
low-heeled matching navy shoes. Ms. Jameson even wore make-up and had 
her hair in a bun. She had a large golden brooch of a Pi symbol pinned to 
her blazer collar and a red scarf tied neatly around her neck. Ms. Jameson 
­shepherded the girls out of the band room commenting, “I’m glad I found you. 
We are getting ready to take our seats for the competition!”
Missy’s head was overflowing with ideas. If the old band uniforms were ­getting 
replaced, they were probably going into the recycling bin. She hoped they 
could be donated to the fashion club. There was so much fabric to mine from 
them, not to mention all the buttons, zippers and trim! As Missy walked down 
the hall, new designs danced in her head.
Missy, Megan, Kim and Ms. Jameson entered one of the backstage practice 
rooms. The CHAPS mathletes silently sat in various positions around the 
tiny room, except Peter who was pacing around in the limited floor space 
surrounding them. The atmosphere felt heavy. It seemed so much quieter and 
more somber and serious in this room compared to the band room. Missy 
wondered if the rest of mathletes even thought math was fun.
Missy noticed how the mathletes on her team had dressed for the day, some 
casual and some downright professional, like Kim. She wished they had 
­uniforms of their own to wear in order to show they all belonged to the same 
team. Even though she loved her OOTD, and thought some other outfits 
looked great too, the whole team looked like a random bunch of kids. Missy 
imagined they could look more cohesive in some kind of uniform. She filed 
that thought away to bring up to Ms. Jameson after the competition.
Missy and Megan looked around for an empty spot to sit down on the floor. 
Kim quickly took a seat in a space by the door.
“OK, mathletes! Today is OUR day!” Ms. Jameson cheered and everyone 
looked up.
“That’s right,” Peter said jumping up and pumping his fist in the air. Just then 
another mathlete stood up and Peter mis-stepped and tripped. He went 
down saying “Oomph.” He flailed out his arms and flopped to the floor in a 
Superman pose. He quickly recovered, and was helped to his feet by Missy and 
Megan who were passing by.

“Uh. Thanks,” Peter said surprised. Then he blushed, seeing that he was 
­holding hands with two girls.
Relieved that he was okay, the room filled with laughter. Peter smiled and 
pretended to reenact his superhero crash. That broke the tension, and the 
chatter and excitement levels rose. Ms. Jameson gathered them together, and 
the team lined up to head to the auditorium. Maybe these mathletes did love 
math as much as she did, Missy decided. Missy wished the math team got the 
same support as other CHAPS teams.
The mathletes took their designated seats beside all the other teams from 
schools around the county. Missy twisted around in her chair and scanned 
the growing crowd. She saw Ivy from Fairmount Prep and a few other ­familiar 
faces from other school competitions. Strangely, Missy even thought she 
­spotted world-renowned fashion designer Sarah DeMott standing next to 
Chris in the mezzanine! The famous designer had judged Missy’s first fashion 
competition of the year. Missy remembered that she had an awesome sense 
of style.
Missy continued scanning. AJ and G-ma had joined Mr. Maker in the audience. 
She made a mental note of where her dad was sitting after spotting him and AJ 
waving wildly to her from the back of the auditorium. Missy was thrilled they 
could all be there to cheer her and the CHAPS mathletes on. Three or more 
friends or family members per mathlete times twelve school teams meant there 
were at least 432 spectators! Not bad for an academic event, Missy thought to 
herself.

AJ held up a sign that said, “Go M3! Go CHAPS!” Missy smiled to herself 
knowing only AJ would have thought to make a sign just for her.
The CHAPS Marching Band expertly performed their rendition of “When 
the Saints Go Marching In” as the remaining students and spectators settled 
in their seats. They followed that up with the National Anthem and led the 
students and their families in the pledge of allegiance. As they exited the 
auditorium, they marched playing “The Ants Go Marching Two by Two.” Missy 
laughed at the math reference and settled into her seat. When the band 
had fully exited, something amazing happened. Sarah DeMott stepped up to 
the center stage microphone. Missy’s jaw flopped open. She couldn’t believe 
that her favorite designer of all-time was here, at her school, hosting a math 
competition!

Chapter 10 | All the Right Angles

Missy took in every detail of Sarah DeMott’s outfit from her pointy-toed, 
thigh-high, black leather boots with giant buttons running down the outsides 
like beetles standing at attention, to her green, white and blue plaid skirt that 
skimmed the top of her boots, to her fitted cable knit sweater with three-
quarter-length sleeves and v-neck neckline. Topping it all off was a mini fedora 
floating atop her blond hair. It tilted slightly above her left eye. Missy wondered 
how many bobby pins had been used to anchor it in place to keep it secure 
from the effects of gravity.
Miss DeMott began speaking and Missy leaned forward on the edge of her 
seat. “Wow! That was a great performance by the Cherry Hill Band. Let’s give 
them another round of applause!”
Everyone clapped, then Miss DeMott said, “Thank you all for coming! My name 
is Sarah DeMott, and I am here to welcome all of you—students, ­teachers, 
parents and supporters—to this exciting STEM event! Science, technology, 
engineering, and math are mind-opening subjects and learning them well 
­prepares us for many opportunities in life.”
Missy listened intently and thought she was hearing a recording of her own 
father’s words. If it had not been Sarah DeMott speaking them, she might have 
rolled her eyes and tuned out completely. How many times had her father 
said that studying math and science were the keys to a successful future?  
She had long ago lost count!
Miss DeMott continued, “As many of you know, I am a fashion designer, but 
you may not know that I am also a mathlete. I have loved math for as long 
as I can remember, especially geometry. And, while I am a designer today, my 
first career was as a mechanical engineer. I love shapes and patterns. I adore 
all the calculations and formulas that we use in design and engineering and 
architecture to make those shapes and patterns fit perfectly together. I am 
thrilled to be your host today.” She went on to discuss the day’s event and the 
rules of the competition. Then Miss DeMott introduced the judges and the 
competition began.
Missy was stunned. Her favorite designer was a mathlete AND an engineer?! 
Missy suddenly had a new perspective. M3 could be a designer and a math 
Olympian and whatever else she wanted to be!
“Math is awesome and so is Sarah DeMott,” Missy said to herself smiling ear 
to ear.
Based on their ranking and a series of coin tosses, CHAPS sat out the first 
­several rounds of the Math Olympics. Missy was glad for that because it 
allowed her to see exactly how the competition worked. She had practiced 
with the CHAPS mathletes and had watched them scrimmage before, but she 
had never participated in or watched an actual live event.

Missy observed that each individual on the team answered one math ­problem, 
rotating back and forth across two teams per round. The competition 
­proceeded in timed rounds, and every round included individual questions 
­followed by more complex team questions. Team questions required the 
whole team to work out a response and to agree before presenting their final 
answer within a specified time limit. Each question had a number of points 
associated with it, and the team with the most points at the end of the round 
advanced to the next level of the competition. Missy noticed how rapt all the 
attending mathletes were. Each raced to solve the problems on their own 
in their heads or by scratching notes on index cards or notebooks. Missy 
could tell from frustrated actions like head slapping and fist banging whenever 
­someone got a wrong answer. In three rounds, Missy had not missed one of 
the questions as she answered along to herself!
CHAPS took the stage for the fourth round, and won by two points, advancing 
to the next level. The CHAPS mathletes also won the following round and 
advanced with two other teams to the final round, which was scheduled after 
lunch. The CHAPS Marching Band returned and performed a classic rock 
mash-up. Then they marched down the aisles, and led the audience to the 
cafeteria. Each of the math teams reported to a different room where pizza, 
juice and water, and cut-up vegetables were served to them for lunch.
As the auditorium was emptying out from the main doors behind all the seats, 
the mathletes were led out through the backstage exit doors. Missy saw Chris 
approach Sarah DeMott in the corner of the stage. Miss DeMott touched his 
arm when she spoke to Chris, and Missy felt a jolt of electricity in her own 
arm. The two seemed so friendly, like they knew each other well.
The CHAPS mathletes regrouped in the small practice room where they had 
met in the morning. It smelled of hot pizza. Missy’s mouth watered when she 
stepped inside.
“Great job!” Ms. Jameson congratulated the team. “I’m so proud of all of you!” 
she said. “Now let’s relax and hydrate and enjoy lunch! We have forty-five 
­minutes before the finals begin.”
From the doorway, Peter looked at Ms. Jameson and raised his eyebrows in a 
question. She signaled back to him with a nod and a wink. “Gooooo CHAPS!” 
he said, and everyone echoed in reply. Then the team lined up to get their 
lunches.
Three pizzas with eight slices for twelve students meant everyone could have two 
slices each. After Missy took a slice and some carrots and celery, she looked 
around the room for a place to sit and saw that Kim and Megan were on 
opposite sides of the room. Missy finally made eye contact with Megan, who 
motioned for Missy to sit down next to her. Missy carefully wound her way 
through the crowded room hoping not to have an epic fall like Peter had done

earlier that day. When she made it safely to Megan, she said “Whew!” and 
carefully folded her legs to sit in the space next to her friend.
“Can you believe Sarah DeMott is our host? Can you even believe that she is 
a mathlete?” Missy asked Megan.
“Totally!” Megan replied.
“Really?” Missy said, considering the facts. “She’s so glamorous and pretty and 
her designs are so AH-MAZING. I guess I never expected someone could love 
both math and fashion!”
Now it was Megan’s turn to be surprised. “Seriously?” she asked. “Did you 
ever look in the mirror?”
Missy smiled. “I guess I just never saw myself that way. But, I really am enjoying 
the competition. I should have joined the team sooner.”
Missy took a bite of pizza and absorbed the quiet vibe of the room. She wanted 
to ask Megan why she and Kim were not sitting together, but ­everyone was 
eating so the room was virtually silent, and Missy did not want to make a big 
deal out of it—especially if it was nothing.
“Mmmm. Good pizza,” Megan commented, wiping her face with a napkin.
“Yep,” Missy responded. “Tastes like Big Jim’s. That’s my family’s favorite.”
As people finished their first slice, several students lined up to take a second 
slice and the chatter picked up. Missy took the opportunity to ask Megan 
about Kim. “It’s simple,” Megan said. “She’s mad because of the band stuff this 
morning. Kim didn’t want to get involved because she said it was a big distrac-
tion, but I wanted to help, and I said she should come along too when Mahdavi 
came to us and explained the situation.”
“Oh. I guess it was a distraction, but it really helped calm my nerves,” Missy 
said. “And, I’m glad we could help the band. They have been awesome today!

They played so well, their uniforms hardly mattered, but I do think they looked 
good.”
“I know it, right? Anyway, I’m glad we could help too, though that band room 
was crazy,” Megan said and smiled at Missy. “Hey—it’s great to have another 
girl on the team! It’s super that you could fill in this weekend. We were so 
happy that we didn’t have to forfeit the competition.”
“Thanks,” Missy said. “I’m really inspired by Miss DeMott! I think I would like 
to join the team if there’s room for me!”
“That’s super! We should tell Ms. J!” Megan exclaimed.
Missy nodded. “And, we should talk to Kim. I feel bad that she’s mad about 
this morning. By the way, whatever happened to the bullying situation?” Missy 
asked Megan.
Megan had just taken a sip of water and swallowed wrong. She coughed and 
sputtered. The question seemed to have caught her off guard. “Oh. That. 
Someone posted on SocialMe that I should quit the math club. At first I was 
so mad. Then I just got sad and a little bit scared.”
“OMG. Really?” Missy asked. “That’s awful!”
“Yeah,” Megan continued. “I wasn’t sure what to do about it. My parents talked 
to the principal. They took the message down and I haven’t seen ­anything 
like it since. It was a mess. I was thinking about quitting even though I didn’t 
want to quit. And, Kim didn’t want me to quit and leave her as the only girl 
on the team.” Megan looked across the room and finger waved at Kim who 
was ­sitting alone by the door. Kim waved back and gave a tentative smile. She 
pushed herself up to her feet and joined the other two girls.
“Hey,” Kim said.
“Hey,” Missy and Megan said in unison.
“Jinx,” Missy whispered. “Later,” she said referring to finishing the game. “We 
were just talking about SocialMe bullies.”
“Anyway,” Megan continued, “I worked so hard and I improved a lot in my 
math skills. It was not easy at first, but I started to really like it. So, I’m glad 
Ms. Jameson and the principal could help, although we still don’t know who 
was behind the mean messages.” Megan looked at Kim who smiled in earnest.  
“All I know is that they just stopped. So, I’m glad that I took your advice and 
talked to a teacher! Ms. J listened and helped me get through everything.”
Missy tried not to think back to the year before when she was bullied for being 
a good student—and especially for showing her math skills. Yet, it all came 
flooding back to her. In her case, two students had been identified and expelled 
from school. Then, the whole school attended anti-bullying ­workshops and 

Chapter 10 | All the Right Angles
98
Missy had hoped it was over forever. The thought of a bully hurting her friends 
upset her. She would be there for them and help in any way that she could.
While Megan was talking, Missy pulled out her phone and brought up her 
SocialMe and showed the girls the message from that morning. “At first, I was 
really upset at seeing that terrible nickname again, but I decided to embrace it. 
I’m ‘M-cubed’. I think it’s sassy!”
Kim raised her eyebrows, “You should probably mention it to Ms. Jameson, 
you know, just so she knows.”
“You’re right. I will. Even though I don’t think it’s bullying in my case,” Missy 
said, and then she made her way over to the trash can to throw away her 
paper plate.
On her way back to her friends, Missy first walked over to Ms. Jameson who 
was sitting at a makeshift desk consisting of a folding chair stacked with boxes 
of copy paper. She was eating a pre-packaged salad and crackers.
“Hey there, Missy! Great job so far. Are you having fun?” Ms. Jameson asked.
“It’s been great,” Missy said, looking down at her feet wondering how to 
approach the subject.
“So, what’s up, kiddo? Do you need something?” Ms. Jameson asked.
“Actually,” Missy started. “I wanted to show you something. I’m not upset—
any more—but with all the cyberbullying, I just wanted you to know about this 
comment on my SocialMe page.”
Ms. Jameson stood up and walked with Missy into the hallway. There, she 
took Missy’s phone from her outstretched hand and read the posting along  
with Missy’s response and the subsequent comments. “You handled that very 
well,” Ms. Jameson said. “I’m sorry to see any name-calling—even if it’s all 
in good fun. I promise to investigate it and we’ll have the comments taken 
down.” She shook her head and handed Missy her phone back. “Thank you 
for ­showing this to me. On the plus side, it looks like your friends are really 
supporting you!”
“Okay. Thanks,” Missy said as she stepped back into the room. “Oh. By the 
way, I think I want to join the math team more permanently, if that’s alright,” 
Missy headed across the room to where her friends sat.
“That’s wonderful,” Ms. Jameson called to her as she made her way across the 
room.
“Hey, Missy, I just read some of the comments out there on SocialMe,” Kim 
said.
“You’ve got quite a fan club, M-cubed,” Megan said, using her fingers to make 
quote signs.

“Do I?” Missy asked looking at her phone and scrolling through. “Wow! I 
guess I do!” Missy was thrilled to see her friends had posted even more com-
ments and responses supporting her.
As the team finished eating and everyone started cleaning up their cups, plates 
and napkins, Peter rallied the team, and called for a cheer. Missy led them 
with the mantra from her dad, “Math is awesome and so are we! Goooooo 
CHAPS!” The team repeated her cheer as they marched out of the room and 
down the hallway.
The stage had been rearranged to accommodate the three teams that had 
made it to the finals. The tables were set in a u-shaped configuration with the 
microphone still set up in the center of the stage.
Chris walked past Missy muttering to himself, bumping her shoulder as she 
took her seat. He was dressed in black from head to toe and carried a length 
of cable over his left shoulder. He held an oversized walkie-talkie in his right 
hand. His long hair hung straight down revealing only one eye. Missy’s heart 
fluttered. Chris sidestepped several other mathletes to avoid a collision as he 
headed down the steps and into the side aisle rushing toward the mezzanine.
Missy wondered what the hurry was all about just as Sarah DeMott spoke 
into the microphone and feedback tore through the overhead speakers. The 
high-pitched sound had students and supporters covering their ears with their 
hands or plugging them with their fingertips. Missy noticed AJ had held onto 
her posterboard sign when she covered her ears, so it now formed a strange, 
giant bonnet over her head.
After a loud click, the feedback ended and Miss DeMott shouted to the 
­audience that they were having some technical difficulties and that the band 
would perform one last time before the final round. The CHAPS Marching 
Band started playing in the hallway, then they marched into and around the 
auditorium playing “Seventy-six Trombones” from the Music Man musical.
“What a perfect song!” Missy thought and found herself humming along to the 
catchy tune. She looked for and spotted Chris in the mezzanine waving signals 
to someone backstage. The song wrapped up and the band exited to roaring 
applause. No microphones were needed for that team! Missy watched Chris 
and smiled when she saw him give the thumbs-up signal. She knew it was for 
his AV contact backstage, but she felt like it was aimed directly at her.
Sarah DeMott spoke into the now working mic and reviewed the rules. 
“Congratulations to our three finalist teams! What an exciting day we have 
had so far! At the end of this round, the highest scoring team will be named 
champion of the Math Olympics!” she explained.
For the final round, CHAPS was seated stage left, Fairmount Prep was stage 
right, and St. Mark’s Academy sat at the center table. Missy waved across the 
stage to Ivy who winked at her and waved back. The Fairmount Prep team 

Chapter 10 | All the Right Angles

all wore red golf shirts with the school logo on the front and the students’ 
last names in yellow letters across the back. St. Mark’s mathletes wore their 
school uniform jackets with white shirts and khaki pants and skirts. Missy 
looked down the line at the CHAPS mathletes. She envisioned them all wear-
ing gray t-shirts each with a different white math notation, CHAPS Knights 
graphic, and their names imprinted on the back. Ten dollars per t-shirt for each 
mathlete and Ms. J. Missy wondered if the math club had at least $130 in their 
treasury to fund her uniform idea.
Silence settled over the stage as Miss DeMott read out the questions. The 
mathletes solved a plethora of problems. One after the other no one got a 
wrong answer. Missy imagined the final round might last until midnight. Then, 
St. Mark’s got eliminated. They lost two points on a team question when one 
student blurted out a correct answer without the agreement of his ­teammates. 
Ms. Jameson had cautioned them about presenting answers in the team chal-
lenges, so Peter made sure everyone agreed on the final answer even when 
time was short.
The whole competition came down to a duel between CHAPS and Fairmount 
Prep! The two teams had perfect scores for the day.
“Okay! Great job mathletes,” Miss DeMott announced. “We have one last 
question and the first team to respond with the correct answer will win the 
Math Olympics. Are you ready?” she asked and everyone nodded.
Missy heard someone in the audience crinkling a wrapper through the quiet.
“I am designing a dress for a gala,” Miss DeMott said, beginning the math 
­problem. “The dress is made of eight identical right triangles plus two identical 
rectangles. I also need 15% more fabric to account for fittings and ­adjustments. 
How many yards of fabric do I need to purchase to construct my dress? And, 
if I don’t have to make any adjustments, how much may become waste?” Sarah 
DeMott shared the dimensions and set the time clock.

As Miss DeMott asked the question, Missy saw shapes lining up in her mind’s 
eye. She quickly realized that the four right triangles came together to ­measure 
the same size as the rectangle. Missy multiplied it all out. She determined that 
seventy-two inches or two yards of material measuring thirty-six inches wide 
would need to be purchased, and two yards by six inches could be waste. 
Though in Missy’s mind, there was always another project to be made from 
any scraps.
“Got it!” Missy said, and Peter rang the buzzer. Without him asking, the whole 
team nodded. Missy presented the solution.
“Correct!” Miss DeMott declared. “Congratulations to Cherry Hill Academy 
and Preparatory School!”
“Wahoo!” Missy heard her father’s cheer from the back of the auditorium as 
her team surrounded her and patted her on the back.
The mathletes lined up and congratulated the other teams on their  
well-fought math battle. Each of the finalists received a medal, and the CHAPS 
mathletes received a team trophy too.
“Well done!” Ms. Jameson shook everyone’s hands as they filed back into the 
tiny practice room. She gave Missy a squeeze around her shoulders as she 
passed by. “I am so proud of you. You all did a great job!”
“Hey, M-cubed,” Peter called to Missy. “Thanks for helping us today. I hope you 
will consider joining the team.”
“I will! Ms. Jameson has promised me a spot! And, I can’t wait for the next 
meet,” Missy announced, and everyone high-fived.
Missy took a selfie with the team that she noticed was photo-bombed by 
Danny and Mahdavi still dressed in their band uniforms. The two had slipped 
into the room amidst the celebration. Missy posted the photo to her SocialMe 
page with the hashtags mathmakers and CHAPSforthewin. Then she gathered 
up her coat and backpack to leave. When Missy turned around to say goodbye 
to her friends, she saw Chris at the door with Sarah DeMott. She felt her face 
flush with color.
“OMG. OMG,” Megan said, jumping in place and tugging on Missy’s coat. 
“That’s Sarah DeMott!”
“I know it!” said Missy.
Ms. Jameson cleared her throat. “And, here’s a special surprise. Miss Sarah 
DeMott would like to congratulate you in person.”
“Thank you, Jenn.” she said to Ms. Jameson. “Great job, mathletes. I’m so 
­honored to be here at CHAPS. I am really impressed by all the students today, 
and I hope you continue your math studies! Good luck to you all!”

“Miss DeMott has time for a few questions if anyone would like to talk to her,” 
Ms. Jameson announced.
Missy had so many questions: How did you go from engineering to fashion? 
What did you like to do in middle school? Who’s your favorite designer?
As the students stepped up to ask their questions, Missy noticed Chris was 
lingering in the doorway. When she looked at him, he smiled and nodded at 
her. She bravely walked over and said hello.
“Hey. Good job on the competition,” Chris said. “Did you see I gave you a 
thumbs-up at halftime?”
Missy blushed. “I did!” she said, and then she scratched her head. “So. Wait a 
sec. Do you know Miss DeMott? You two looked so chummy today and now 
you’re here—with her.”
Chris tossed his head back, flipping his hair and briefly revealing a glimpse into 
both eyes. “Oh yeah. She’s my aunt. My mom’s sister.”
“That’s super,” Missy said. “Wow! You’re so lucky to know her. She’s ­amazing—
electrifying, really.”
Chris nodded, “Yeah. She’s cool.”
“Okay. Ready?” Miss DeMott said over Missy’s shoulder to Chris.
“Mmhmm,” Chris said. “This is Missy,” Chris introduced the two.
Missy gushed, “OMG! Wow! You’re my inspiration.” Missy turned to shake 
Sarah DeMott’s hand. “I love your mini fedora! How did you get it to stay in 
place?”
“Thank you, Missy. Between you and me, I used seven hairpins and some 
­double-sided tape—a designer’s favorite insurance policy! By the way, you are 
quite an inspiration yourself. Nice job on that last question, and on your outfit. 
That skirt is divine!”
Missy beamed at the fashion icon nearly forgetting how to speak, “I-I made it,” 
she finally said.
“The shapes, the pattern. The geometry of your skirt is like a poem. It’s a great 
design. I hope I’ll be seeing you again! Ta-ta,” Miss DeMott said. She looped her 
arm through Chris’s and they headed out.
Missy stared after them, watching them disappear down the hall. Without 
turning back, Chris put his arm out to the side making a thumbs-up signal with 
his hand that Missy knew he aimed directly at her.

FASHION HACK: BLANKET SHAWL HOW-TO
1.	
Find a favorite old blanket or towel that you want to upcycle. It 
should be a long rectangle.
2.	
Sew or staple the corners 1 to 2 and 3 to 4 together to create a 
simple shawl. Turn the garment inside-out to hide your sewing or 
staples. Embellish with buttons, ribbons or paint.
3.	
Put your arms through the newly formed sleeves (the openings 
created though corners 1 + 2 and corners 3 + 4).

Pi for All
Missy, AJ and the Makers celebrated the CHAPS win over General Tso’s 
Chicken and Hot and Sour Soup at Missy’s favorite Chinese restaurant, Amazing 
Chow. Mr. Maker, AJ and G-ma shared the high points of the competition from 
the audience perspective, while Missy relived the suspenseful moments the 
team experienced when the microphones stopped working after lunch. They 
all laughed at the image Missy painted of AJ’s posterboard bonnet.
Just as the fortune cookies came out, Ms. Jameson appeared. “Matt! I’m so sorry 
I couldn’t join you sooner,” she said to Mr. Maker. “I had some investigating to 
do! And, I hoped to have some news to share.”
Missy and AJ exchanged perplexed looks.
“Do join us, Jennifer!” Mr. Maker said smiling widely. He leaned back and 
pulled a chair from a neighboring table and slid it between himself and G-ma.
Ms. Jameson settled into the chair and gave G-ma a kiss by way of greeting and 
said hello to the girls.
“Jenny, would you like to order some dinner? I’m sure they can get you 
something quickly,” G-ma said.
“Oh. No thank you,” Ms. Jameson said.
“Well, congratulations, dearie! The kids were great today—and so were you!” 
G-ma added.
“Thank you! You are right. The students did an outstanding job. I could not 
be more proud! The only blight on our day was the cyberbullying incident,”  
Ms. Jameson added.

Missy’s jaw dropped open. She had not said anything to her dad and she hoped 
the whole thing would just fade away.
“You okay, Missy?” Mr. Maker asked.
Missy made a show of opening her fortune cookie and popping it into her 
mouth. “Mmm hmmm,” she answered. AJ nudged her leg from under the table 
and looked at her with raised eyebrows.
Mr. Maker turned his attention to Ms. Jameson, “What’s this about 
cyberbullying?”
“A few of the mathletes reported hurtful posts on their SocialMe pages earlier 
this school year. With CHAPS’ zero tolerance policy, I was shocked to see 
another post today with name-calling,” Ms. Jameson explained. “Missy showed 
me the comment calling her ‘Missy-Math-Maker’ and I raised the flag and let 
the principal know we needed to start an investigation.”
“Oh no!” AJ jumped up from the table. “I’m so sorry.” She pulled Missy’s arm 
and grabbed her hand. “That was me. I meant to cheer you on and let everyone 
know you were helping the team today and that you’d be great. OMG. It wasn’t 
to bully you. Missy, I’m sorry if I hurt you,” AJ said and dropped back into her 
chair sobbing into her hands. “Plus I was in a rush. I was making your poster 
and getting out to practice. Then catching a ride with G-ma.”
“Wow,” Missy said. “I thought it was weirdly supportive, but since you called 
me out using the name I hate, it hurt my feelings. I thought you were an 
anonymous bully. I worked so hard this year to show people that I’m not just 
about math—that I love other things like fashion—and wow. I don’t know 
what to say,” Missy said.
“Please forgive me,” AJ said to Missy. “I’m really sorry that I hurt your feelings. 
I would never do that on purpose. I posted it from my cousin’s account when 
I didn’t have my phone with me. It’s not anonymous. Oh Missy! You’re my best 
friend!”
“Okay. Okay,” G-ma said. “Everyone take a deep breath.”
“I-I forgive you,” Missy said. “I know you meant it in the best possible way.”
AJ leaned over and side-hugged Missy. “I’m ready to face my consequences,” 
AJ said to Ms. Jameson.
“Girls, I think you both agree this was not the cyberbullying that we initially 
thought it was,” Ms. Jameson said and the two nodded. “So, we will close the 
investigation and move on from here. Agreed? We do have a more serious 
investigation going on that resulted in losing one member from the math 
team.”
Missy and AJ nodded again.

Mr. Maker scratched his head and straightened his pink and blue plaid bow tie. 
“I’ve never told you this Missy, but I had a nickname in school too, didn’t I Jenn? 
Mom, do you remember?”
Ms. Jameson’s face lit up, “Matt! I had completely forgotten about that.”
“Oh, sonny!” G-ma said. “Didn’t your friends call you Matty-Math-Maker?”
“They sure did!” Mr. Maker said proudly. “To me, it was a badge of honor. With 
my interests in math and science, I have built a successful career as a software 
engineer.”
Missy rolled her eyes. She never knew about her dad’s nickname, but she had 
heard this math-path story many times before. Mr. Maker liked to remind 
Missy that studying math and science opened doors to wealth and success. 
And, after hearing Sarah DeMott earlier that day, Missy was starting to believe 
it!
Mr. Maker reached for a fortune cookie, cracked it open and read his fortune. 
“Listen to this,” he said. “Math teachers love Pi for dessert.”
“It does not say that!” Ms. Jameson grabbed the tiny strip of paper from  
Mr. Maker.
“I swear, it does!” Mr. Maker said putting his hand over his heart.
Ms. Jameson re-read the fortune. “It really does say that! Okay, then. I guess  
I will have some pie, after all!” she said.
“Make that pie for everyone,” Mr. Maker said to the waiter.

Afterword
Inspiration comes from crazy places. The inspiration for Missy Maker and this 
book comes from my enduring love of math and science, my love of learning 
and my longtime desire to write a book for young people. When I think about 
my early education, I have lovely memories of attending St. Cecelia’s Catholic 
Elementary School. There I was taught Earth Science along with multiplication 
and division by nuns and lay teachers.
One of my fondest memories is the exact moment when long division just 
clicked for me—when all the times’ tables’ memorization finally paid off. Sister 
Ann taught third grade math at St. Cecelia’s. One sunny afternoon she spent 
showing the class how to set up long division statements and how to work 
out the answers. At first, it seemed so strange, so foreign. I didn’t believe it 
could work at all. What kind of math sentence was this? And why did we have 
to use multiplication and subtraction in division? Then it clicked. It all made 
sense, and I begged for extra homework. How strange is THAT? I begged for 
homework just to have more long division problems to practice solving!
While many of my friends never believed or even understood my true love for 
long division, they did appreciate my mean math skills! To this day, I still enjoy 
a really juicy long division problem. Don’t you?
I poured that love of math (and so much more!) into my character, Missy 
Maker. I hope you enjoyed meeting her, and I hope you will come along with 
us for another adventure. Missy Maker has many great escapades ahead of her.
