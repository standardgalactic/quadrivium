Dedication
For the angels in my life: Fran, Joshua, Adam, and for my mother, Anna, an
angel that left us to touch the face of God.
Author’s Acknowledgments
First and foremost, I offer my appreciation and gratitude to the wonderful
people at Wiley. It has been a pleasure to work with such a top-notch organi-
zation that works so hard to create products that offer readers tremendous
value and information. I wish all of you continued success! There are some
notables there whom I want to single out.
The first person to acknowledge is Jennifer Connolly, my Project Editor. Calling
her magnificent is just not enough. Her professionalism, expert guidance,
patience, and kind nature helped me get this book done during a personally
difficult summer. She is a true publishing professional who has been extremely
helpful, understanding, and patient. Those words are not enough to express
my thanks for her fantastic guidance.
My Acquisitions Editor, Stacy Kennedy, has been fantastic from start to finish.
I thank her for her efforts and the vision to see this project through from idea
to reality. May the folks at Wiley always appreciate this pro!
I send my appreciation to Sheree Bykofsky and Janet Rosen for their profes-
sional assistance and personal support during the entire project. Through
the years they have been superb, and I look forward to more of the same in
the years to come.
To my wonderful wife, Fran, for her love, support, friendship, and devotion. I
thank her for the free “tips” on precious metals and the numerous offers to
do research at the jewelry outlets. Her tireless efforts will probably put me in
Visa and MasterCard’s hall of fame. 
My thanks to my technical editor, Noel Jameson, another true professional
and a great editor.
To all the great publishing, production, marketing, and distribution folks at
Wiley, thank you for your dedication and wonderful efforts to bring For
Dummies guides to our readers.
Lastly, I want to acknowledge you, the reader. Over the years, you have made
the For Dummies books what they are today. Your devotion to these wonder-
ful books created a foundation that played a big part in the creation of this
book and will for many more yet to come. Thank you!

Introduction
T
he time for precious metals has come. Emerging from the doldrums of a
two-decade-long bear market, this millennium is witnessing a historic bull
market for precious metals. Yet, the public hasn’t caught on . . . yet. As you
read this book, you can catch on as well and hopefully before the crowd does.
In recent years, I have told my clients and students that precious metals are
(and will be) a necessary part of a healthy and growing portfolio. I don’t tell
people that precious metals are great because I wrote a book; I wrote a book
because precious metals are great. For Dummies guides have become the
quintessential nuts ’n’ bolts introduction to a popular or necessary topic. Why
not precious metals because I think they are necessary and their popularity is
strong and growing? The time is now and the place to be is in precious metals
(and some related places, too, such as base metals).
About This Book
Over the years, I have read and reviewed many investing books and lots of
stuff on precious metals, but I didn’t see much that could offer enough infor-
mation and guidance for anyone interested in precious metals, especially if
you are a novice in the topic. You may have some headlines on gold or even
some commercial from some precious metals firm selling gold coins, but what
is there to educate you as you dive into this fantastic topic?
Just about everything a beginner (or investor with rudimentary knowledge)
needs to know about gold, silver, and other prominent metals is found right
between the covers of the book that you are holding right now. As is the hall-
mark for For Dummies guides, the topic is laid out nicely so that you won’t
have to read from start to finish like so many other books. If the only thing
you are interested in is how to buy gold or what you need to know about
investing in silver, the information is there, easily found and ready to be 
read and comprehended in minutes.
Fortunately, (for me and for you), this For Dummies guide is not a clunky,
laborious read. The writing is not stuffy and loaded with academic or indus-
trial jargon. I get to write the book in my own voice; otherwise I’d fall asleep
myself! It’s a fun way to find out more about precious metals, and you can
apply the info from this book immediately.

Conventions Used in This Book
I’ve used the following conventions to make your read through this book a bit
easier:
 Italics: Although you probably know most of the basic investing jargon, 
I put words or phrases in italics when I define them for you.
 Monofont: Whenever you see a Web address, it will appear in monofont.
This makes it easy to distinguish between the entire address and the rest
of the text.
 When this book was printed, some Web addresses may have needed to
break across two lines of text. If that happened, rest assured that I haven’t
put in any extra characters (such as hyphens) to indicate the break. So,
when using one of these Web addresses, just type in exactly what you see
in this book, pretending as though the line break doesn’t exist.
What You’re Not to Read
Okay, so I may not be the wordsmith my brain has me cracked up to be, but
that doesn’t mean you can go skipping stuff in this book . . . oh, wait . . . you
can actually.
Perhaps you’re in a hurry to get ahead of the crowd and start investing in
some precious metals, so you need to cut to the chase and don’t want to be
bothered with the stuff that doesn’t apply to you. Well, although I’d love to
think that you’re hanging on my every word, you can skip two things:
 Any text appearing with the Technical Stuff icon: This text, while mean-
ingful and interesting, won’t hurt you if you bypass it.
 Any text included in a sidebar: Whenever you see text in a gray-shaded
box, those are sidebars. Of course, I love precious metals, so I’ve tried 
to include anything and everything about them in this book . . . well, at
least as much as my editor allows me to. But some things just aren’t nec-
essary for your complete understanding of investing in precious metals.
I’ve tucked those things away in sidebars, which, while interesting, again
won’t hurt you if you skip ’em.
Foolish Assumptions
Dear reader, I make a few assumptions about you. No . . . you’re not a dummy
but you would like more information on the topic of precious metals. You
have some very basic knowledge of investing, and you understand that 
2
Precious Metals Investing For Dummies 

diversification means considering investments beyond merely stocks or
bonds. You understand that inflation is a problem of modern life and that
investments that excel in inflationary environments are a good consideration
for any long-term investor.
How This Book Is Organized
Hopefully the book is laid out for you to easily find exactly what you want to
find and with enough detail to give you some important insight on the topic —
but not too much to overwhelm or bore you. Fortunately, every chapter refers
you to other sources (such as books, Web sites, or other chapters) that can
offer as much detail as you need or want.
Part I: Breaking Down Precious Metals
You need to find the real deal on precious metals — why they’re such a good
thing and why the future looks so shiny for this stuff. Chapter 1 gets you
started on what’s all the hubbub. Sometimes the brightest futures really have
their strongest foundations in history. Precious metals have been a useful
part of economic history since civilization got . . . well . . . civilized.
Once you see the significance of precious metals, you can see why a com-
monsense portfolio needs to be diversified with (at least) a small portion
devoted to precious metals. (Chapter 2 gives you more on this.)
The beauty of precious metals goes beyond just having a pretty face or a lus-
trous quality. It’s also about “beautifying” your portfolio. You find out more
about the beauty and benefits of metals in Chapter 3.
Nothing worthwhile in this life is without risk. Precious metals are no different.
You can’t have gold and silver and other attractive investments dazzle you,
and then ignore the ugly parts. Risk is part of life and it is part of investing as
well. It is also the 800-pound gorilla in the world of speculating and trading so
a whole chapter is devoted to nothing but risk in the world of precious metals.
In that case, make Chapter 4 required reading so that profits are easier to
achieve (not to mention being able to sleep at night).
Part II: Mining the Landscape of Metals
Yeah . . . you’re right, “precious metals” can be a vague phrase so I get spe-
cific in this part. Each of the major metals deserves its own spotlight so I
devote a chapter to each in this part.

Introduction

You can’t talk precious metals without the king — not Elvis — gold. The
allure and prominence of gold throughout history has put it at or near 
the pinnacle of investment success and it has become an ageless symbol 
of wealth. Find out more about gold in Chapter 5.
I love silver even though it has been dubbed the poor man’s gold. Silver’s per-
formance in the coming years will probably shock most people so look at it
closely in Chapter 6.
Most books stop at gold and silver and tend to ignore the rest. Not I. There
are lots of goodies to be discovered, such as platinum and palladium. This 
is also pricey stuff with a bright future. Find out more about the platinum
group metals in Chapter 7.
I couldn’t do a book on precious metals without the hot commodity of ura-
nium. Energy is and will continue to be a major problem needing major 
solutions. Uranium will keep glowing, so find out why it’s untouchable (no
kidding!) in Chapter 8.
When was the last time you read something exciting about zinc or copper?
Stop scratching your head and don’t frown because base metals are a hot
investment topic. Get the profitable perspective in Chapter 9.
Part III: Investing Vehicles
The variety of ways that you can invest, trade and speculate in precious metals
are numerous and span from very safe and conservative to aggressive and
speculative. Precious metals can be a vehicle to generate capital gains or
income. They can be used as portfolio insurance or as risky venues that
could be very profitable. This part covers the gamut.
Buying physical metals directly in bullion form is easier than you think, and I
think that serious investors should have at least a small portion of their
wealth in physical precious metals. Find out more in Chapter 10.
Another great way to get into metals like gold and silver is through numis-
matic (or collectibles) investment. It can be a little tricky so make sure you
read Chapter 11 before you decide to proceed.
Probably the easier way to play the metals in a brokerage account is through
mining stocks. They can be very profitable but there are some things to
watch out for. Chapter 12 gives you the lowdown on mining stocks.
4
Precious Metals Investing For Dummies 

Maybe investing or speculating directly in mining stocks is not your bag. No
problem — you can find great alternatives, such as mutual funds and ETFs,
that are more conservative ways to add metals to your portfolio. Chapter 13
provides some great insights in this area.
For those who want the “high-flying” market where phrases like “get rich”
and “crash and burn” are as common as “please” and “thank you” then you
might consider precious metals futures (see Chapter 14).
Don’t stop there! There are more opportunities in the world of precious
metals by using options. There is an option strategy for just about anyone,
and you can find the details in Chapter 15.
Part IV: Investment Strategies
Okay. You know that precious metals can be good and you now know what
ways there are to participate. Now what?
If you are going to trade metals for fun and profit, start at Chapter 16.
If you are getting into stocks, futures, or options, you need a broker so check
out Chapter 17.
For those who want the short-term moves in precious metals and in markets
such as futures and options, find out more about technical analysis in
Chapter 18.
You’d be surprised to find out that political intrigue has a big impact on pre-
cious metals (and your potential profits). The skullduggery can be found in
Chapter 19.
After you start raking in the big bucks, then, of course, you have to grapple
with taxes. Chapter 20 is the place to start.
Part V: The Part of Tens
The Part of Tens reads like top-ten lists for common topics on precious
metals. Whether you need reminders on mining stocks (see Chapter 21),
rules for metals investing (Chapter 22) and trading (Chapter 23), or you just
want to check out some ways to limit risk (Chapter 24), take a stop at the
Part of Tens.

Introduction

Icons Used in This Book
I include some handy icons that you may notice in the margin of the book.
They point you to certain types of information, so be sure you know which 
is which.
I include some text that tips you off into certain directions — this icon makes
sure you notice. These are not tips of the “Psssst mac, have I got a tip for you”
variety. They are more like “hokey smoke...such a great tip!”.
Although I’d like for you to remember everything I say, I do have two kids and
realize that’s a losing battle. However, if you see this icon, be sure to ingrain
this info on your brain.
Just like I want you to remember everything I say in this book, I’d love for you
to do everything I say, but again, having two kids, I can calculate the rate 
of return on that. But to truly stay away from pitfalls that can cause you seri-
ous financial harm, you should heed any warnings you see associated with
this icon.
Just like any expert, I do have nuggets of knowledge that only Alex Trebek, my
Trivial Pursuit teammates, and my mother could love. But I guarantee that
after discovering the value of precious metals could have in your portfolio,
you could fall in love with some of this technical stuff, too. However, if you
prefer, you can skip the info associated with this icon. This is the only icon
that points you to info that you can skip if you prefer to.
Where to Go from Here
At this point . . . browse! Check out the detailed table of contents and go
straight to those chapters that pique your interest. This is not a novel that
you need to read from start to finish. It is like opening your fridge and pulling
out what interests you. As you watch the precious metals markets become
more popular (for many good reasons), come back and discover more as well
as get pointed in the right direction for more and better ways to profit from
precious metals.

L
ong, long before government-issued currency, such as the dollar or the
euro, existed, people must have had something else to help them trade
with each other. How did people buy stuff they needed? Before there was 
any kind of currency, there was bartering unless you were a barbarian and pre-
ferred plundering. Civilized merchants and consumers traded goods and ser-
vices, but trade did get cumbersome. For example, what if the merchant selling
food didn’t really want your 47 pounds of lint in exchange for a head of lettuce?
To make commerce a little easier, the buyers and sellers in the marketplace
slowly decided on what could be used to facilitate trade. They decided that
something had to be used as a currency, and that currency had to be portable
and widely accepted as a unit of transaction, a store of value, and a medium
of exchange. Whatever they chose as currency needed to be something 
that performed the role of . . . money! For thousands of years, precious
metals — primarily gold and silver — filled the bill nicely. Very nicely.
Gold and silver came to be recognized as precious, valuable, and desirable in
virtually every nation across the globe dating back to the dawn of civilized
society. Now, you might ask “What the heck does history have to do in a For
Dummies book?” Actually, history is very important because it will impact
your portfolio in the coming years. History has shown us that there were (are)
two major types of currency: precious metals and manmade (or government-
issued) paper currencies. This chapter explains why the vast majority of paper
currencies lost their value and are now gone but precious metals are still . . .
uh . . . precious, making them worth a long look from investors.
In this book, I even take a step outside the word “precious” because I don’t
want anyone to call me “baseless.” So I give you a look at the great opportuni-
ties that base metals (such as zinc and copper) offer investors and specula-
tors (see Chapter 9).

Mining the History of Precious Metals
Everyone has used paper currency or credit measured in paper currency, such
as dollars, but precious metals have withstood the test of time as a “store of
value” and as a “medium of exchange” while most paper currencies in history
went kaput — precious metals experts always use such technical terms as
kaput.
Understanding why less is more
Paper currencies have a big problem: They’re “manmade.” Precious metals,
such as gold and silver, on the other hand, aren’t. Depending on who you 
are, you may consider gold and silver as created by God or Mother Nature’s
money, but in either case, gold and silver aren’t — and can’t be — created by
mankind. Yes, you can find and extract or mine precious metals, but you can’t
create them out of thin air. On the other hand, over the centuries paper cur-
rencies (also called fiat currencies) were created by simply running a printing
press — government-approved, of course. These days, the money creation
authorities can do so even easier using a computer!
But being manmade gives room for abuse and misuse. Because the primary
creators of fiat currencies were governments, those governments (through
their power to enforce and mandate) made fiat currencies the money of
(forced) choice. Because man can make money, man can then make a lot of
money. However, you incur risk by creating a lot of money: if you create too
much of it, it can slowly become less valuable, which is known as inflating the
currency. Keep in mind that money is a reference to something of value that
is used in exchange for something of value (such as goods and services).
Currency is essentially a form of money that is generally accepted by a 
society as a convenient way to pay for those same goods and services.
Money retains its value by being limited or scarce. So, if you make lots and lots
of money then each successive unit of that same currency becomes less and
less valuable. This flaw in manmade currency explains why most currencies
in history became worthless, and this danger still exists today. Yet, through-
out time, gold and silver have retained their value. I guess you really can’t
fool Mother Nature!
Giving the gold standard a gold medal
Now before you think I totally love gold and silver while totally hating paper
or fiat currency, guess again — it’s the competition between the two that I’m
not so crazy about. History tells us that the middle ground is actually a great
place to be: Backing up manmade currency with gold — called the gold 
standard — works. Some forms of currency was backed up by silver by 
10
Part I: Breaking Down Precious Metals 

usually silver was used directly (in coinage, for example) since it was less
valuable than gold. In modern times (the 1960s and later) silver generally 
disappeared from circulation as a form of money and was replaced by coins
made of base metals.
Throughout history, the strongest and most stable fiat currencies were
backed up by precious metals. Having a gold standard in place made the 
currency stable and its ability to purchase goods and services also tended 
to remain stable. Problems usually occurred when the currency was taken off
the gold standard. Just take a look at American history for an ideal example:
When America was on the gold standard from about 1800 to the late 1920s,
general consumer prices were stable. However, as America gradually got off
the gold standard and subsequently started to increase the number of dollars
circulating in the economy, prices started to skyrocket. Alan Greenspan
pointed out in 2002 that consumer prices doubled in the immediate years 
following the abandonment of the gold standard and had quintupled by mid-
20th century.
A great primer on the history of money is available at the venerable Ludwig
von Mises Institute (www.Mises.org). There are both a video and audio
(MP3) to explain in laymen’s terms the role of money and the Federal Reserve
(America’s “central bank”). This primer presents an excellent explanation of
why gold and silver are critical to our economy’s well-being.
The most common financial collapse occurs when too much money is created
(inflation) thereby debasing it, resulting in a currency collapse or devaluation.
The U.S. dollar is currently being created (“increasing the money supply”) at
a record pace and its value is shrinking at an alarming rate. History tells us
loud and clear that diversifying even a small amount into precious metals is 
a prudent move.
Going for the gold
Nobody knows the exact details regarding the origin of gold usage, but the
use of gold as money goes back to ancient times. Gold became an ideal form
of money because of its durability and easiness to carry. It quickly became
the most widely accepted currency among many different societies.
Gold became widely used as money in the American colonies with the Coinage
Act of 1792. It played a major role in the U.S. economy up until 1933 when
President Franklin D. Roosevelt prohibited the ownership of gold by private
citizens. This prohibition only affected gold assets that could have been used
as a competing currency, such as gold coins, bullion, and gold certificates.
(For more information on gold coins and bullion, see Chapters 10 and 11.)
Imagine that you do the smart thing in accumulating gold to preserve your
wealth during the Great Depression and the government ends up confiscating
it. Let’s hope that it doesn’t happen again.
11
Chapter 1: A Compelling History

Fast forward to our times and to what is unfolding in our economy and finan-
cial markets and you see that the conditions are ripe for gold to return as a
necessary element in not only investors’ portfolios but for consumers in 
general. As currencies lose valuable across the globe, more sturdy forms of
money will emerge and nations will return to what has worked for centuries;
precious metals.
Seeing the silver lining
Silver over the centuries had a unique dual role: monetary (used as money)
and industrial. Going back to ancient times, silver was very commonly used
as money, whether as minted coins or as a backing to paper money (such as
silver certificates). Since it typically had a much lower monetary value than
gold, it was actually more commonly used in commerce since it was great for
smaller transactions. After all, wouldn’t it be silly to buy a candy bar with
gold anyway? Silver also proved to be a very versatile and useful metal for
industry. Because of this, silver actually has some outstanding qualities 
for investment-minded folks. (See Chapter 6 for more details.)
Mentioning other metals
No book on precious metals would be complete without mentioning the other
metals that have such great potential for investors. Here are some to consider: 
 Platinum: A very pricy metal with attractive prospects for investors and
speculators. (See Chapter 7 for more information.)
 Palladium: The “other white metal” offers some affordable investment
opportunities as well (see Chapter 7).
 Uranium: Is a spectacular precious metal that is a great way to speculate
in the world of energy as nations the world over build nuclear power
plants (see Chapter 8 for full details).
 Base metals: They may be cheaper than precious metals but don’t dis-
count their powerful profit potential (Chapter 9 gives you the exciting
details).
Taking a Look at Track Records
Before you check out each metal’s track record, keep in mind that precious
metals undergo major multiyear bull or bear markets reflecting the overwhelm-
ing economic and financial factors of that era (see the section, “Grappling with
Bulls and Bears,” later in this chapter for more about those markets in spe-
cific eras). Metals, both precious and base, are solid considerations for
12
Part I: Breaking Down Precious Metals 

investors and speculators to get involved with but the bottom line is really
the profit potential. The simplest way to judge the future potential of some-
thing is to check its past performance: the track record. Since 2000, metals
and their related investments have had an enviable track record. I get into
the specifics in the following sections.
Gold
Gold is the quintessential precious metal. “Good as gold” is more than a catch
phrase; it ‘s the essence of gold’s performance in recent decades. Some years
from now they may change that phrase to “as sensational as gold.”
That ’70s metal
The 1970s was a historic time for our country’s economy as well as for gold.
For decades leading up to this decade, gold had a connection to the U.S.
dollar. Gold began the decade at the government imposed fixed price of
$35.08. However, the controls on the gold were gradually removed as the
Federal government devalued the dollar in 1971. By February 1973, the gov-
ernment devalued the dollar again and raised gold’s price to $42.22. During
this year, the dollar ceased to be tied to the price of gold; it was now allowed
to float and compete with international currencies in a free market. This
unleashed the price of gold and its bull market was off and running! By 
June 1973, the market price of an ounce of gold reached $120 in London.
In 1974, the gold market really opened up. Americans were now permitted to
own gold and many countries such as Japan lifted restrictions on gold buying
and selling. In 1975, trading in gold futures (see Chapter 14 for more details
on futures) began at New York’s Commodity Exchange (COMEX) and the price
of gold was left to find its free-market level. Market demand drove the price of
gold per ounce to $180 in early 1975 before temporarily dropping to $100 in
late 1976. Gold then steadily zig-zagged upward until it hit $240 in mid-1978
before . . . again . . . it fell temporarily to $190 in late 1978.
1979 was the big year for gold. By any measure, it had a great performance
from the beginning of the decade to this point. Especially since it was a tough
decade for the stock market and other investment vehicles. By early 1979, it
was evident to all that commodities in general and precious metals & energy
in particular. The cocktail parties were soon abuzz with people talking about
international tensions, economic problems and . . . precious metals. I’m sure
that if “The Graduate” came out in that year that some boorish party guest
would have told Dustin Hoffman the opportunity of the day . . . “gold.” The
yellow metal zoomed to an all-time $420 by the fall of 1979 before taking a
final breather to $380. Within weeks, gold spiked up to its famous-yet-brief
high of $870 in mid-January 1980 before it came crashing down like a rocket
ship that ran out of gas at the worst possible moment. It was time to switch
your money from gold investments to parachute manufacturers.
13
Chapter 1: A Compelling History

For gold, 1980 started an extended bear market (a long period of dropping
prices). However, the 1970s was one for the record books. Those who
invested early on and persevered through the roller-coaster ups-and-downs
of the gold market were handsomely rewarded with some spectacular profit
opportunities: Gold’s ride from $35 at the beginning of the decade to its peak
of $870 at the tail end of the decade. That represents a percentage gain of a
whopping 2,386%. To contrast, look at the performance of the Dow Jones
Industrial Average (DJIA), a major barometer of stock market performance.
The DJIA started the decade at 809 (January 2, 1970) and ended it at 839
(December 31, 1979). That 30-point gain represents a pretty measly gain of
about 3.7% (for a whole freakin’ decade!). To be meticulous about it, I realize
that I’m off a few weeks; gold’s all-time high occurred on January 21, 1980.
That month, gold started at $559.50 before it spiked to its all-time high and
then settling month-end at $653. Anyway, I think you get the picture. For the
late seventies, it was indeed “as good as gold.”
Gold stocks go berserk
As gold raced towards its all-time high during the late 1970s (hitting $870 in
an intra-day high January 1980), gold mining stocks went ape. That’s right;
there was (and is) more than one way to make money with gold. During the
late 1970s, stocks of companies that mined the yellow metal saw their share
prices rise far greater than conventional stocks. Seeing share prices triple
and quadruple in the gold mining sector was a common sight. There were
two types of gold-mining stocks: the large companies (“the majors”) and the
smaller companies (“the juniors”).
Large mining stocks easily beat the stock market averages. Homestake Mining,
for example, was one of the majors. Its share price went from under $5 in 1978
to over $25 in 1980. Four hundred percent up in about two years: not bad! As a
category, the large mining stocks did better in the last two years of the 1970s
than the entire stock market did all decade long. Junior mining stocks did
even better.
Silver
Silver isn’t just a second banana serving as gold’s sidekick. Its past, present
and future look just as shiny. 
Hi-ho silver!
Dubbed the poor man’s gold, silver did extremely well in the late 1970s. While
the world watched the higher-profile gold market, more astute investors and
speculators noticed silver in gold’s shadow. On a percentage basis, it did far
better than gold. Silver started the decade at under $2 an ounce. However,
the market for silver was opened up in similar vein to the gold market. Silver
14
Part I: Breaking Down Precious Metals 

steadily rose to $10 by the beginning of 1979. Speculative demand by investors
push the white metal’s price past $20. The major influence on silver’s meteoric
rise came from a single private source: the billionaire Hunt brothers.
It is now a part of investment folklore but it was an intriguing true story. The
Hunt brothers along with two wealthy Arab investors formed the company
International Metals Investment Company, Ltd., for the purpose of cornering
the silver market. Silver quickly soared to nearly $50 by January 1980. The
market was to change rapidly as regulators moved in. Since the buying pri-
marily took place at New York’s Commodity Exchange (COMEX), exchange
officials took steps to reverse the price rise. COMEX raised margin require-
ments (explained in Chapter 15) and temporarily allowed only sell orders 
on silver. These new rules created forced liquidations and caused the price 
of silver to plummet. By March 1980, silver fell to under $11, a drop of over
78% from its all-time high in less than two months.
It was indeed a wild ride for silver at the end of the 1970s. As the dust settled,
nimble silver investors and speculators (learn more about the difference
between these two in Chapter 3) made some spectacular profits in silver. The
metal went from $1.29 in 1970 to its zenith of $49.45 in 1980. The percentage
gain for the decade was an astounding 3,733%, certainly a silver lining for
anyone’s portfolio.
The 1970s might have been a great story and a distant memory that might
cause us to daydream about what fortunes we coulda, shoulda, woulda made.
The wealth-building power of precious metals is behind us, right? Well . . . 
not quite. This writer believes that the conditions are ripe in our time for a
possible repeat performance. Why do you think I’m writing this book? Stay
tuned . . .
Silver stocks go to the moon
In the late 1970s, there were silver mining companies that, of course, had a
lot of silver. Millions of ounces of the stuff. How well do you think they (and
their shareholders) fared? By 1979-1980, many of them experienced legendary
profits. Take Lion Mines, for example. It was a junior mining company that
you could have picked up for only 7 cents a share in 1976. By 1980, it was
worth a staggering $380 a share. No, that’s not a misprint. In other words, if
you had bought $184 worth of that stock in early 1976, your shares would
have been worth one million dollars only 41/2 years later.
Other metals
Platinum’s general price action and market fundamentals were not that dis-
similar to gold and silver. Just as the 1990s (for example) were relatively quiet
for gold and silver, it was a similar experience for platinum. Its price moved
15
Chapter 1: A Compelling History

in comatose fashion around the $400 level (give or take $25) from 1992 to the
end of the decade. From 2000 onward, it was a different story. Its price soared
upward and ended 2006 at $1,118 per ounce. Since it started the decade at
$433, it rose a very nifty 158% during that time frame. A similar story line 
happened for its lesser cousin, palladium, during the early part of the decade.
(Platinum and palladium are covered in greater detail in Chapter 7.)
Palladium traded for most of the 1990s in the $100-$200 range until 1996.
Market demand (palladium is primarily an industrial metal) surged for it in
the second half of the decade, driving its price skyward to just over $1,000
(Jan. 2000) before crashing down to the $300-$400 range in 2001. By the end
of 2006, it hit a respectable $323.50. Even after you factor in the tremendous
up-and-down of the 1999-2000 period, the price was still nearly a double after
10 years ended 2006. The market fundamentals for palladium (and the other
metals) look very attractive going forward (I am writing this in early 2007).
Grappling with Bulls and Bears
The 1970s showed us a decade-long bull market while the 1980s and 1990s
were an extended bear market (it was generally a period of falling prices for
precious metals). The factors that made the 1970s very positive for precious
metals (especially gold and silver) are back with a vengeance in this decade.
As the saying goes, “History may not repeat but it does rhyme.” History is an
important tool in deciphering what to do today. If the 1970s, for example,
were a period of high inflation and economic difficulty, how do people react?
How will they react today with similar conditions? In a nutshell, the past gives
us real-time information to help us make appropriate investment decisions
with “cause-and-effect” conditions. For me, it was a big reason for writing a
book on precious metals since their bull market is the “effect” from the
causes (inflation, economic difficulty, and so on). Kapish?
The precious metals 1980–1999 
bear market
More times than not, you’ll see a bear market after (and before) a bull market
(duh!). For gold and silver, 1980–1999 was such a time. Although there were
some interesting rallies (brief periods of price upswings), these two decades
witnessed a long, painful zig zag down. 1980–1982 was indeed a brutal period
for the metals. People walking the streets would have to watch out for traders
and speculators hitting the pavement like water balloons at a shriners’ 
convention.
16
Part I: Breaking Down Precious Metals 

There was a batch of reasons for gold’s plummet. The early 1980s witnessed 
a dropping inflation rate which in turn meant decreasing consumer prices.
Gold plummeted from its all-time high in early 1980 to $297 in 1982. However,
gold staged a brief rally where the price rose to $500 in early 1983. During the
late 1980s the catalyst for driving the price up during its two brief rallies was
not inflation, economic problems, or international tensions. It was a market
phenomenon as more buyers came in because of more discoveries of gold as
new gold-rich mines were found that sparked renewed interest.
The second rally in the 1980s drove the price of gold again upward to briefly
kiss the $500 level (for the last time in the century) and then it continued its
downward, long-term trend. In the 1990s gold was able to touch the $400 level
on several occasions, but it ended the century under $300. (The New York
spot market closing price on December 3, 1999, was exactly $287.80.) The
new century brought better price action for gold investors and speculators.
For silver, those last two decades were especially trying. Except for a few
brief rallies to the $10, $8 and $7 levels, silver traded most of that time in a
narrow range from $3.80 to $5.50. It ended the century at $5.33. What can
investors learn from this?
The greatest profits come from understanding that market conditions can
change dramatically over a period of years and decades that offer bullish (or
bearish) profit opportunities. Sometimes a market gets beaten up so much
that it gets to a point where it ultimately has nowhere to go but up. When
your investment or asset hit rock bottom (what better phrase for metals?)
then investigate and see if the data suggests a good entry point. The years
1999–2001 was just such a period as both precious and base metals hit rock
bottom and began a long-term, powerful up move that rewarded many early
investors.
The precious metals bull market of 2000–
History isn’t always about what happened thousands (or dozens) of years ago.
It offers valuable lessons right here . . . in your own decade! The years from
2000–2010 are an inflationary environment. Every major nation has been
inflating its currency and in 2006–2007 the pace has accelerated. This is not
good. At all! Unless, of course, you are into precious metals. At the beginning
of 2000, you could have bought gold for 288.50 (New York spot market price)
an ounce and silver for about $5.34 an ounce. By the last business day of 2006,
gold hit $636while silver ended the year at $12.85. Percentage-wise, gold went
up 121% and silver 141%. In contrast, the Dow started the millennium at
$11,497 and ended 2006 at $12,463 for a modest gain of 8.4%.
17
Chapter 1: A Compelling History

Gold and silver stocks fared even better. Goldcorp, for example, is a major
gold-mining firm that could have been bought for $2.88 a share at the begin-
ning of 2000. By the end of 2006, your stock would have been worth $28.44 a
share for a long-term gain of 887%. Silver Standard Resources, Inc. is a major
silver-mining company that you could have gotten that first crisp trading day
in January 2000 for a paltry $1.25 a share. You would have seen it climb into
nose-bleed territory at $29.49 a share for a whopping gain of 2,359%. Many
gold and silver mining companies had phenomenal results similar (or close)
to these results.
Investors who had even a small allocation of their portfolio in precious metals
or their related stocks could have boosted their total portfolio returns very
nicely. In this chapter I use gold and silver as examples because they are the
first things that people think of when they hear the phrase “precious metals.”
But the topic does encompass much more than the two famous metals. As
you read earlier in this chapter, platinum and palladium offer great opportu-
nities and their future looks pretty shiny too (pardon the pun).

iversification is always seen as a positive move for investors. Every
investor (where possible) should have a variety of investment vehicles
in his or her portfolio for obvious reasons. Diversification helps to minimize
risk as well as increase the chances of seeing your overall portfolio grow, and
the time has come for investors to diversify with precious metals because the
economic and financial environment for precious metals is better than ever.
Working with Rising Inflation
The U.S. and other major countries have been increasing the money supply at
a blistering pace. The increasing money supply means rising inflation, which
is bad news for many conventional investments (such as bank certificates of
deposit, bonds, and other fixed investments).
As the money supply grows, this monetary inflation then shows up as price
inflation (higher prices for goods and services), which ties into hearing folks
say “the U.S. dollar is losing value.” Of course, the more dollars you create,
the less valuable each dollar is worth. Inflation, then, is a serious problem
that could wreck a traditional portfolio. Precious metals then become a solid
addition to your arsenal of wealth-building vehicles.
As inflation and other ominous trends unfold, precious metals become not
only a good investment, but also a necessary tool in your overall wealth-
building and wealth-preservation picture. Gold and silver, for example, make
for excellent long-term inflation hedges.

Understanding the Versatility of Metals
Precious metals have the unique quality (for investors, anyway) of coming in
a variety of “formats” to fit a variety of investor needs. Think about that for a
moment. If you bought a stock, it comes in one format . . . stock! Well, it could
be a paper certificate or a digital blip that you see on your computer screen
when you visit your brokerage firm’s Web site but essentially, the only way
you could invest in stock is . . . stock.
Precious metals, on the other hand, can be had as a “paper investment” (such
as through a certificate of ownership or a futures contract) or shares in an
exchange-traded fund (ETF; see Chapter 13 for more details) or in the actual
physical metal itself. Unlike many other investments, the form the precious
metal takes does indeed have a bearing on its level of risk and appropriate-
ness (more on risk in Chapter 4).
The most versatile precious metals are gold and silver (and sometimes plat-
inum). Gold and silver can be held as coins or jewelry but other metals are
difficult to keep in physical form. Platinum, although available, is very expen-
sive and not as widely available in physical form. Uranium? Don’t even think
about it!
Reaching Your Financial Goals
What do you want to do with your money? Money, precious metals, and all
the other things that are part of your financial landscape are really tools for
living — nothing more, nothing less. In the world of investing, trading, and
speculating, precious metals become a means to an end. What is that end 
for you personally: making ends meet this week, paying off the mortgage 
next year, becoming financially independent within ten years, or another
goal? Regardless of the goal you choose, precious metals provide you with 
an excellent vehicle to help you reach your future financial goals.
In 2001, a bull market began to unfold when the general investing public didn’t
even notice: Gold was under $300, and by the spring of 2007 it was nearly
$700; silver was under $5 in 2001 and in the same time frame went to about
$14. This bull market should continue, making metals a worthy investment.
You can find many investments and strategies suitable for long-term investing
and many designed for short-term results. In the world of precious metals, the
longer the term, the better your chances become for building wealth. The short
term is more appropriate for traders and speculators, but keep in mind that 
the short term is fraught with volatility and risk. So short-term and long-term
goals should address three things:
20
Part I: Breaking Down Precious Metals 

 Your risk tolerance (see Chapter 4)
 Your investing style (see the section, “Discovering Your Investing Style,”
later in this chapter)
 What your objective or goal is
The following sections give you an idea of how precious metals can help you
achieve specific financial goals.
Seeking appreciation
Precious metals are primarily a vehicle for capital gain. In other words,
investors seek to buy it at a low price and sell it at a higher price later.
Precious metals do not usually generate income. Yes, there are mining stocks
that issue dividends but these dividends are not substantial enough to merit
consideration for investors seeking income. Precious metals have proven to
be great vehicles that appreciate during long periods of economic, political,
and financial distress. A good example is the late 1970s but a great example 
is . . . right now!
Early in this decade (about 2001), precious metals and precious metals–related
investments (such as mining stocks) started an impressive bull market. The
beginning was, however, a roller-coaster ride that zig-zagged upward. Every
12 to 18 months there was a pull-back or correction in their prices of 10% to
30%. For those not familiar with the volatility in precious metals prices, it was
a scary moment, but for those with some patience and fortitude, the rewards
were great.
Gold, silver, and other precious metals have shown excellent price growth
and have been among the top performing assets so far in this period. They
easily beat out financial assets such as stocks, bonds, and certificates of
deposit. In the wake of the bursting housing bubble they even beat out real
estate (cool!). For the rest of this decade and probably well into the next
decade, the environment for rising precious metals prices is very bullish.
Precious metals will shine (pardon the pun), but again, some patience and
fortitude are necessary.
Looking for the home run
There are investors seeking appreciation (aren’t we all?), but some of you may
be looking for only truly fantastic gains. I know personally of one case in 1999
where $3,000 was turned in $80,000 in only four weeks in a commodities bro-
kerage account. The vehicle he used was options on gold futures. During that
brief time frame gold rallied from $250 to over $300. Of course, another four
weeks later the amount shrunk to $22,000 when gold went back down.
Remember: Home runs can also easily turn into strikeouts.
21
Chapter 2: Diversifying with Metals

For those looking for home runs, precious (and base) metals offer realistic
opportunities for great gains during the coming years. Base metals have 
been very profitable in recent years, and they are covered in Chapter 9.
Precious metals are part of the natural resource sector, which includes not
only metals but also commodities (grains, meats, and so on) and energy (ura-
nium, oil, natural gas, and so on). Because metals are a finite, nonrenewable
commodity whose supply is strictly limited to what we can find both above
and below ground, it offers the chance for great gains since demand and usage
for them keeps going up. The population keeps growing right along with the
money supply. As consumer and industrial demand keeps going up and as we
print up more and more dollars (along with euros, yen, and other currencies)
then what do you think will happen to the price of finite resources? Can you
say “powerful, long-term, profitable bull market” three times fast?
Preserving your capital
Keep in mind that precious metals are assets with intrinsic value; value that’s
been there for literally thousands of years through all sorts of economic con-
ditions. In recent decades precious metals performed very well but in part it
was due to what was going on around the economic and financial markets.
Inflation is a dreadful problem. Inflation became more of an issue in this
decade, and the prospects look bleak for the next decade. Why? Our govern-
ment (and governments of the other major nations) is increasing the money
supply at record rates. Coupled with persistent problems in areas such as,
the war on terror, Social Security, healthcare, budget deficits — just to name a
few — ensure (unfortunately) an environment conducive to precious metals.
Precious metals have a long record of maintaining and rising value so they
can be an attractive part of even conservative portfolios.
Using precious metals to generate income
Although precious metals are best suited for gains, there are precious metals
vehicles and strategies that can generate income. This is important to keep in
mind because no one says that once you are into a strategy to generate gains
that you must stay that way. Au contraire! When your situation changes and
you want to start reaping some of the fruits of your labor to augment your
income needs then you can do something about it with these income choices:
 Dividend-paying mining stocks: If you have grown your money with
small mining stocks and you are changing your strategy from capital
gain to income, then you can sell your no-dividend stocks and use the
proceeds to buy larger, established companies that offer a dividend.
Some offer quarterly dividends and there are companies that offer
monthly dividends.
22
Part I: Breaking Down Precious Metals 

 Covered call writing: This strategy could easily generate income of 5%
to 15% or more from your existing stock portfolio with no added risk.
Covered call writing could be done with the stocks of large mining com-
panies no longer looking for gain.
 Bonds issued by mining companies: I include this to be complete but
they are not that different from bonds issued by other companies. Don’t
consider it to be a “precious metals” investment; it’s just a bond so 
don’t get too excited.
 Marketsafe certificates of deposit: Issued by Everbank (www.ever
bank.com) this has the features of a regular CD (interest) and it’s tied 
to precious metals such as gold and silver. If gold goes up, your CD 
(protected by FDIC) can increase in value with no added risk. Visit the
Everbank Web site for more details.
Discovering Your Investing Style
When you think of style, perhaps you think of famous labels and famous
people, but you probably don’t think about those folks with their colored
coats waving and yelling at each other on the stock trading floor. Regardless
of what you may think, they’ve got style, and so do you — an investing style.
In the following sections, you can nail down your style and match it up with
the best vehicles for precious metals investing.
Distinguishing between styles
In my investing seminars I talk to my students about the differences in the
concepts of saving, investing, trading, and speculating because it matters so
much and because I find it unsettling that even financial advisors don’t know
the difference. These are important to distinguish because people should know
otherwise the financial pitfalls will be very great. The differences aren’t just
in where your money is but also why and in what manner. Right now as you
read this, millions of people are living with no savings and lots of debt, which
tells me that they are speculating with their budgets; retirees are day-trading
their portfolios; and financial advisors are telling people to move their money
from savings accounts to stocks without looking at the appropriateness of
what they’re doing. Make sure you understand the following terms — knowing
the difference is crucial to you in the world of precious metals:
 Saving: The classical definition of saving is “income that has not been
spent” but the modern-day definition is money set aside in a savings
account (regardless of the interest rate) for a “rainy day” or emergency.
Everyone should have a savings account with money that is safe and
accessible just in case you encounter an unexpected interruption in
23
Chapter 2: Diversifying with Metals

your cash flow. In fact, you should have at least three months’ worth of
gross living expenses sitting blandly in a savings account or money
market fund. Do you know that 2008 is the year that the first wave of
baby boomers (there are a total of 78 million baby boomers) start to
retire? These retirees have more debt than any prior group of retirees
and their savings rate is around . . . zero! Although precious metals in
the right venue is appropriate for most people, including savers, you
need to have cash savings in addition to your precious metals invest-
ments. A good example of an appropriate venue in precious metals is
buying physical gold and/or silver bullion coins as a long-term holding
(see Chapter 10).
 Investing: This term refers to the act of buying an asset that fits an
investor’s profile and goals that is meant to be held long-term (in years).
The asset will always run into ups and downs, but as long as the asset
you’re holding is trending upward (a bull market), you’ll be okay. Investing
in precious metals may not be for everyone but it is an appropriate con-
sideration for many investment portfolios. The common stock of large or
mid-size mining companies is a good example of an appropriate vehicle
for investors. (See Chapter 12 for more details.)
 Trading: Trading is truly short-term in nature and is meant for those
with steady nerves and a quick trigger finger. There are many “trading
systems” out and this activity requires extensive knowledge of market
behavior along with discipline and a definitive plan. The money employed
should be considered risk capital and not money intended for an emer-
gency fund, rent, or retirement. The venue could be mining stocks but
more likely it would be futures and/or options since they are faster-
moving markets. (See Chapter 14.)
 Speculating: This can be likened to “financial gambling.” Speculating
means that you’re making an educated guess about the direction of a
particular asset’s price move. You are looking for big price moves to gen-
erate a large profit as quickly as possible, but you also understand that
it can be very risky and volatile. Your appetite for greater potential profit
coupled with increased risk is similar to the trader but your time frame
is different. Speculating can be either short term or long term. Your
venue of choice could be stocks, but more likely, the stocks would be 
of mining companies that are typically smaller companies with greater
price potential. Speculating is also done in futures and options. (See
Chapters 14 and 15.)
Understanding yourself first
Saving, investing, trading, and speculating aren’t just limited to understand-
ing precious metals. They’re also to a great extent understanding yourself.
Sometimes I get asked if an investment vehicle is appropriate and I have to
24
Part I: Breaking Down Precious Metals 

provide a cop-out answer such as, “It depends.” Any investment could be
good but it depends on who the person is. How well do you understand 
yourself? Here are some points to consider:
 What are your goals? Are they short-term or long-term goals? Do you want
to build wealth to buy real estate property next year or a large nest next
decade?
 What is your profile? Are you just out of college or are you retired? Are
you heading into your peak earning years or are you slowing in your 
pre-retirement years?
 What is your risk tolerance? Do you have the stomach to watch your
investments rise and fall? Are you the type that sweats bullets when
your nickel gets lost in the deep recesses of your couch?
 What is your investing style? Are you conservative or aggressive? Do
you quietly sip your drink at the party or do you dance on the table 
with a lampshade on your head?
You need to understand what type of wealth builder you are or you will have
difficulty. Personalities and investing vehicles do have a correlation. Half the
battle in successful wealth-building and/or wealth preservation is knowing
yourself.
The saver
The saver is actually not worried about a return on his/her money (like the
investor, for example). The saver is more concerned about minimal risk and
having money for a rainy day. The saver will have money in an account where
the doesn’t zig or zag; it just slowly grinds higher with compounding interest,
ready to be used later for reasons both good (to finally invest it) or bad (pay
for an unexpected problem such as a medical emergency or covering living
expenses in the wake of a job layoff).
The investor
Are you an investor? Every investor is marked by the phrase “long-term” and
this is indeed important. The classic investor does his or her homework to
choose investments that are undervalued and that show great potential. The
reason that these investors are “long-term” is that it takes a while for the
market (other investors) to notice what you have and then buy it. If you have
chosen your asset correctly, then “buy and hold” is your style and it has
worked very well.
25
Chapter 2: Diversifying with Metals

When people think of a successful investor the first name that comes to mind
is invariably billionaire Warren Buffet. I can fairly label his investment style
along the lines of “measure twice and cut once.” He spends a lot of time ana-
lyzing the investment and if it truly measures up, he will buy it and hold it for
a looooong time. I will tell you something interesting about Mr. Buffet that I
recently told my clients.
Warren Buffet is not a spectacular investor but long-term you can’t argue with
the results. I told my clients that Mr. Buffet, to my knowledge, has never been
the “top-ranked investor” in any year during his entire investing career. In
other words, find his best year of stock-picking and there will be someone
who did better in that given year. I doubt that he’s ever made anybody’s “top
ten investors for the year xxxx.”. And yes . . . he’s had some bad or mediocre
years. So what’s his secret?
Warren Buffet certainly does his research and then invests but investing does
take patience. He takes the phrase “long-term” very seriously. If the investment
is growing, why get rid of it? He minimizes the transactions costs (fees, com-
missions, taxes, and so on), and he holds on to his winning positions indefi-
nitely. In today’s world, investors are impatient and are in a hurry to make a
profit. And if they make it they sell too quickly to lock in their gain and then
scurry off to hopefully make another choice. In other words, investors are fre-
quently their own worst enemies. These principles and observations apply to
precious metals as well.
The trader
For many, the words “trader” and “speculator” are one and the same. Trading
is basically short-term in nature and more active in its scope than speculat-
ing. Markets do indeed go up and down constantly, and the ups and downs
happen in the course of a year, a month, a week, or a single day. A market 
can have some amazing price swings that can occur in a single trading ses-
sion. I’ve seen people buy, say, an option that morning and sell it in the 
afternoon and make a few hundred dollars (or more) in just a few hours.
Trading is usually about making money with the ripples in the market (the
short-term ups and downs) versus riding the overall tide for perhaps greater
profits over a longer term. They’re happier, I presume, with lots of smaller
profits versus waiting it out a few more weeks or months for bigger profits.
In Chapter 16, you find out more details on the different types of traders and
trading styles. You may have heard about day-trading and swing-trading since
they have had their moments of popularity in recent years. So trading can be
profitable and rewarding, but to me it can be a pain: Trading can require a lot
26

of attention; trades can go against you; then, of course, there are the transac-
tion costs. Day-trading simply presents too many pitfalls for inexperienced
folks. Besides, can you imagine me trying to day-trade while I’m watching my
five-year-old and my six-year-old? Fortunately, I work on the first floor and
the sharp objects are locked away.
The speculator
I love speculating! It’s not for everybody, but it can be done with a small por-
tion of your portfolio (again, if you don’t mind the risks). The speculator does
a lot of research and tries to position the speculative portion of the portfolio
for a spectacular gain. You do the research and apply some rigorous economic
logic and you can tip the scales in your favor. Let me use a great example of
someone who did this with oil futures (though you can easily do the same
with precious metals).
I’ll call this speculator Joe. Joe opened a commodities brokerage account 
in the same firm that I use. Being bullish on oil, he opened the account in
February 2004 with $90,000 and he concentrated entirely on call options on
oil futures. A call option is basically a bullish bet that the asset (in this case
oil) will be going up in price. Those of you who remember that year are
already salivating — 2004 was a very bullish year for oil as it nearly doubled.
Of course, investments tied directly to oil did well. In Joe’s case, he used
long-dated call options that he rolled forward. In other words, he would 
buy the options and sell them at a profit when they rose in value and then
use the proceeds to buy new options with longer time values and so on.
The key to powerful profits is leverage and that’s what you get with options.
A single option can help you profit from the price swing of an oil futures con-
tract that is tied to 1,000 barrels of oil. Every penny move in oil equates to a
$10 move in the futures contract which in turn means a magnified move in
the value of the option. If you didn’t follow that don’t worry: Chapter 14
covers futures and Chapter 15 tackles options.
What’s the bottom line for Joe? He was right about the direction of oil and his
original $90,000 account value became $1.1 million by December 2004. This
does not include the fact that he took out $300,000 from the account! I guess
he needed it to buy gasoline. Anyway, that’s a great example of speculating
done successfully. Just understand that for every successful “Joe” in futures
and options, there are many unsuccessful ones. “Leverage” has made some
speculators rich while it’s sent many speculators into new professions where
they say things like “Did you want that order to go?”

Chapter 2: Diversifying with Metals

Knowing Whether to Get Physical 
or Own the Paper
First of all, let me make this very clear: I think that everyone should own some
physical gold and/or silver. If you had to choose between the two of them, I
like silver a tad better. In terms of currency problems, we are living in historic
times. Currencies are losing value, which will only get worse as the major
nations of the world keep their respective money supplies growing and grow-
ing. Using precious metals as an inflation hedge or counterbalance to the
shrinking value of the dollar will become imperative. Whether you stick to
the physical metal or own it on paper depends on your trading style, as the
next sections point out.
In the following sections, if I don’t specifically label something  “physical”
then consider it “paper” such as stocks, mutual funds, and similar vehicles.
For the conservative investor
For conservative investors and other folks who are risk averse, the precious
metals area can be an unusual and skittish place. That’s understandable, but
they still deserve a place in your portfolio to some extent. Current and future
economic conditions warrant it. If you’re a conservative investor, consider
the following investment vehicles:
 Physical: Bullion coins and/or bars (see Chapter 10)
 Large, established mining stocks (see Chapter 12)
 Mutual funds that specialize in precious metals (see Chapter 13)
The above may be conservative but that doesn’t necessarily mean unexcit-
ing. Those who made it a regular practice to buy, say, some gold eagles 
(bullion coins issued by the U.S. Mint) every now and then during 2000–2006
would have been handsomely rewarded as the price of gold rose from $288 
at the start of 2000 to a 2006 year-end price of $636 (a rise of 121%). Cool!
A good example of a large, established mining stock is Newmont Mining
Corporation (symbol: NEM). It started the decade at $24 per share and ended
2006 at $45.15. Over a span of seven years NEM gained 88% not including divi-
dends. Keep in mind that I’m using NEM as an example, not a recommenda-
tion. Not a spectacular performance but it certainly did better than the major
market averages during that same time frame. The Dow Jones Industrial
Average, for example, went from $11,358 at the start of 2000 to $12,463 at 
the end of 2006 for a percentage gain of almost 10%. Don’t even think about
asking about how Nasdaq did during that time.
28
Part I: Breaking Down Precious Metals 

Mutual funds traditionally have been a major part of investors’ portfolios. For
conservative investors, mutual funds are a great way to participate in pre-
cious metals. It’s probably not a surprise to you by now; precious metals
mutual funds (along with other mutual funds that concentrate on the natural
resource sector) were definitely among the top-performing funds during
2000–2006.
For the growth investor
As world populations grow along with the money supply, there will be strong
and growing demand for natural resources, such as precious metals. In other
words, precious metals and their related investments are a very appropriate
choice for investors seeking growth. With that, the following considerations
are appropriate:
 Physical: Bullion coins and/or bars (see Chapter 10)
 A cross section of both small, mid-size and large mining stocks (see
Chapter 12)
 Precious metals ETFs (see Chapter 13)
 Long-dated options on mining stocks and ETFs (see Chapter 15).
By the way, precious metals can be purchased directly for retirement in an
Individual Retirement Account (IRA), which I cover in Chapter 10. In terms 
of acceptance and choices, precious metals have come a long way since the
days the government banned private ownership.
A good example of a gold mining company appropriate for growth investors
is Goldcorp Inc. (symbol: GG). It started the decade as a mid-size company
priced at a very reasonable stock price of $2.59 (price adjusted for stock
split). GG ended 2006 at $28.37. The percentage gain would have been over
995% (not including dividends). That’s more like it! Sure the stock price hit
bumps and potholes along the way, but patient growth investors reaped an
excellent gain.
Now options can be a dicey matter. Some call them vehicles that can be part
of the growth portfolio while a larger crowd would label them speculative with-
out question. The honest answer is “it depends.” Did I shock you? Options are
very versatile and they can be applied in various strategies of differing risk
levels. There are even some options strategies that are appropriate for con-
servative investors and for income-oriented investors. For those buying
options, be they call options or put options check out Chapter 15.
29
Chapter 2: Diversifying with Metals

For the speculator
In recent years, I have had the pleasure of seeing some of my clients (who
didn’t mind the added risk exposure) see $40,000 in risk capital (money, if
lost, that didn’t force you to eat dog food) and turn it into $250,000 in less
than three years. Speculating, again, is like financial gambling, but I don’t do
it justice calling it that because enough knowledge and research can greatly
offset the “gambling” portion of it. There is nothing wrong with speculating
(heck, I do a lot of it), but it does require more diligence, research, and risk
tolerance than other styles investing. The “thrill with your money” can defi-
nitely turn into the “kill of your money,” and it can happen all too suddenly.
With all that said, here are good considerations for speculators:
 Small mining stocks
 Options on mining stocks
 Precious metals futures
 Options on precious metals futures
My favorite of the four choices is options but hey . . . all the choices I list are
good. In addition, even speculators should get some physical gold and/or
silver as well because inflation will affect speculators, too.
For the trader
Even people who trade also have some savings and investments elsewhere in
their financial picture. To me, trading is an active pursuit whereas the other
areas are technically considered passive. I even consider speculating passive
because it’s a case of having your money work for you in spite of the added
risk. Speculating could be long-term as well as short-term, but trading is
exclusively a short-term pursuit. Therefore, trading best occurs with assets
in a market that can move far and fast. Also, successful trading tries to create
or find profit opportunities in both up and down moves in the markets.
Therefore, the best venues for trading are:
 Precious metals futures
 Options on mining stocks
 Options on precious metals futures
I cover more on trading in Chapter 16.

Getting the Amount Just Right
I can’t give you any hard and fast rules for what percentage of metals should
be in your overall financial picture. I can’t turn to you and say, “Yup . . . 11.3%
is a must for you.” I know guys in their 40s who will have a fairly small por-
tion of their assets in precious metals, and I know some senior citizens in
their 70s with large holdings. Some guidelines you just can’t find inside this
or any book — they’re inside of you. You’re an individual, and what’s a right
amount for you may not be for others and vice versa. Remember that I am
writing this in 2007. I definitely would not have written the same guidelines in
1997 and I have no idea what I’m going to write in 2017 but now . . . today . . .
precious metals are a necessity. I don’t see that changing for the rest of this
decade. With that said, the following sections give you my take on what
amounts each different type of investor should shoot for.
For the conservative investor
I think that conservative investors ought to consider having 10% of their
financial portfolio in the physical metal (coins, and so on) and 15% in paper
such as mining stocks. This should span both the precious metals such as
gold, silver, and platinum along with base metals and uranium. The emphasis
should be on larger, established companies in politically friendly countries.
Of course, if you do more or a little less that’s fine since your personal style
and comfort level come into play as well.
Although this book is intended for precious metals let me say (as a public
service going beyond the call of my author duties) that some of your other
portfolio holdings ought to be in areas such as consumer staples, energy, and
other necessities. Take it up with your financial advisor and tell ’em I sent ya.
For the growth investor
Just as with the conservative investor, I like the 10% in physical and the 15%
in paper approach. Of course, the character of the 15% paper portion can be
different and certainly more aggressive. Look into junior stocks and mid-size
companies. Learn about options and how they can boost your portfolio.
31
Chapter 2: Diversifying with Metals

For the speculator
After you get past the 10% in physical, consider 20% in the same type of
venues as the growth investor and 10% in the speculative area, maybe more 
if you feel you’re up to it and you have enough diversification in the rest of
your financial situation. The 10% (or more) speculative portion can be options
in a stock brokerage account or futures and/or options in a commodities 
brokerage account.
For successful speculating, I believe that you shouldn’t try to spread that
speculative 10% portion around in a batch of metals. I know that I am speak-
ing heresy in some circles but hear (or read) me out. Successful speculating
requires time, research, and attention. Watching half a dozen different specu-
lative vehicles makes it difficult. It reminds me of that guy I saw on the Ed
Sullivan Show (yup . . . I’m that old) who would have a bunch of plates spin-
ning on sticks and he would keep running to each one while his lovely assistant
smiles from a distance . . . close to the nearest broom.
In the past few years I traded silver options almost exclusively, and I got to
know the silver market very intimately. It paid off since the average account
gain for my clients and dedicated students for three consecutive years was
about 100% per year on an annualized return basis. It was very gratifying to
accomplish that. The broker servicing the accounts at the commodities bro-
kerage firm tells me that this is very difficult to do and is a higher success
rate than most of the programs in the industry. For me the secret was that
speculating is best done like a laser beam and not like a shotgun blast.
Before you take the plunge, test the water first. Do some simulated transac-
tions. Web sites such as www.Marketocracy.com and www.stocktrak.
com have great programs for simulated or paper trading without risking 
your money.
For the trader
This is a different animal. I hope that traders do put 10% into physical and
maintain a diversified portfolio not unlike the growth investor. After that they
can take the risk capital portion of their portfolio much like the speculator
and start trading. If you are considering trading as a part-time activity, then
you may want to consider the simulated trading programs that can be found
on the Internet to test your approach before you decide to risk your money
(see above section for suggestions).
32
Part I: Breaking Down Precious Metals 

As in speculating, trading is best done if you watch a single market like a hawk.
Because the transactions are more short-term in nature and you’re catching
the ripples, it is important to have a plan in place. The first thing you should
plan to do is simulated trading (see above section for suggestions). Next,
instead of trading futures directly, do options so that you greatly limit your
risk. Options have great leverage but you can also limit your risk going in.
Lastly, plan to read up on the trading styles of successful traders. One of the
greats in the history of financial markets is Jesse Livermore. His thoughts on
trading can be found in the book Reminiscences of a Stock Market Operator
(John Wiley & Sons). Just a thought . . . speaking of which, I have many more
thoughts on trading in Chapter 16.

The Beauty and Benefits of Metals
In This Chapter
 Understanding the need for metals in your portfolio
 Getting a look at the benefits for investors
 Taking a glimpse at the benefits for traders and speculators
I
n 2006, I celebrated my 25th year in business. Looking at investments was
an uneventful moment outside of looking at their financials and so on
because investments are generally intangibles; you can’t touch or taste them
(not that you would want to munch on a stock certificate), but they are more
or less abstract things. Precious metals — and I’m talking primarily gold and
silver — can be beautiful things that you can actually hold and admire. Once
in a long while I get the chance to look at the gold eagles and the silver eagles
that I have acquired over the years, and I see that above and beyond the fact
that I got them for cold, hard economic reasons I am reminded that physical
gold and silver can also be works of art.
Fortunately, the beauty can also extend to your wealth-building picture as
well. This chapter covers the benefits of precious metals and their related
investments. Don’t think that I am mesmerized though; Chapter 4 goes into
the ugly side of metals (risk).
Protecting Your Portfolio 
Against Inflation
Inflation is one of the greatest dangers to your investing and wealth-building
pursuits. Many people make the common error of thinking of inflation in terms
of its symptoms instead of seeing inflation for what it really is, and I’m not
immune to such an error. I’ve been known to think, “Gee whiz . . . how much
for that bag of groceries?! Here . . . why not take my whole freakin’ wallet!!
Never mind . . . I’ll just put back the breath mints. Harrumph.”
But high prices aren’t the cause of inflation; they are the result or symptom.
Inflation means that the government is printing a lot of money (dollars or

euros or whatever the currency is of that particular country) and this
increasing supply of money is used to buy a limited basket of goods and 
services. The following sections show you why diversifying your portfolio
with precious metals can strengthen your wealth building.
Precious metals against the dollar
Monetary inflation refers to increasing the money supply (“monetary” is just
an official way of referring to “money” such as dollars). Monetary inflation
then leads to price inflation, which is what most people are familiar with. The
bottom line is that you end up paying more for the stuff you regularly buy.
The end result isn’t that goods and services cost more — the money you use
is worth less. That’s the insidious side of inflation; it acts like a hidden tax
that destroys your purchasing power. Take a look at the following charts.
Figure 3-1 shows you the value of the U.S. dollar since the beginning of the
decade. Now compare that with Figure 3-2, the chart of gold’s performance,
and Figure 3-3, the chart of silver’s performance. You tell me which is the
good and the bad (before I get ugly):
Keep in mind that whatever investments you have, they are denominated in
dollars. If you are a U.S. citizen then the odds are pretty good that virtually
everything you own is measured and valued in American dollars. Therefore,
as the dollar goes down in value, that will have an adverse effect on your
financial well-being.
If you had $1,000 tucked away in your sock drawer in 2006 and you checked
in 2007 and it’s still there, you might say that you still have $1,000 (or “Thank
God no one checks this drawer!”). From a nominal point of view, your wealth
hasn’t budged. It’s still $1,000 and you feel fine. But before you check your
mattress, understand that your wealth actually shrunk. The official rate of
inflation for 2006 was 2.8%. That means that, according to the U.S. Department
of Commerce (more specifically, a subdivision called the Bureau of Labor
Statistics found at www.bls.gov), you would have needed an additional $28
in your sock drawer just to buy the same “basket of goods” as the original
$1,000 from a year ago.
Now before you extract $28 from your mattress and transfer it to your sock
drawer, keep in mind that the “official rate of inflation” is probably not accu-
rate. The fine print for the official rate of inflation states that it does not
include food and energy costs. Yes . . . I find that aggravating, too. According
to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, as long as you don’t eat food, use a car, or
turn on lights in your home . . . you’re doing fine! For 2006, had you calcu-
lated the real-world rate of inflation, you’d be looking at a rate somewhere in
the 6% to 9% range. Fortunately there are alternate sources of inflation data
and analysis available at places such as www.inflationdata.com and www.
shadowstats.com to help you get a more accurate assessment of the infla-
tion problem. The reality for your sock drawer is that you really should have
an additional $60 to $90 added. Hmmm . . . time to replenish your mattress.

Chapter 3: The Beauty and Benefits of Metals

Inflation is not a short-term problem. In the above example, whether the actual
difference is $28 or $60 or $90 is not that big a deal. But . . . it becomes a very
big deal over an extended period of time. In 2007, the U.S. dollar has lost over
half its value from 20 years ago. That’s a problem and that’s why diversifying
into tangible assets such as precious metals makes sense.
Diversification against all currencies
You encounter a purchasing-power risk in any manmade currency that could
be produced at will by a government authority (such as a government central
bank). What does this mean for you going forward? As I mention in other
chapters, a growing (mismanaged?) money supply is at the heart of the prob-
lem. Because paper or fiat currencies first started being used centuries ago,
governments have never resisted the temptation to print up lots of it. This is
why the dustbin of history is top heavy in currencies that were over-printed
into oblivion. Could that be the case today? Are currencies being created in
ever increasing amounts?
Oh yeah. Inflation isn’t just a problem for you and me. It’s affecting many
people across the globe. Gold and silver are doing well and should continue
to do well regardless if we are talking dollars, euros, francs, yen, or salt. It is
safe to say that hyper-inflation, a currency crisis, or collapse is destined to
hit in the dollar and/or other currencies at some point in the coming years.
What does this have to do with the benefits of precious metals? It’s like look-
ing through a window, watching a torrential downpour, and discussing the
benefits of umbrellas. Yes . . . inflation will rain on your wealth-building
parade and the forecast is for a batch of storms on our radar screens for 
the foreseeable future.
The most obvious and familiar precious metals are gold and silver, and these
two should suffice for most portfolios. However, precious metals also encom-
pass the following . . .
 Platinum: Although you can get platinum in physical form such as bul-
lion coins, it is not a huge, liquid market. For more details see Chapter 7.
 Palladium: A cousin to platinum that is also not a huge, liquid market
(see Chapter 7).
 Uranium: Not meant for your sock drawer (see Chapter 8).
 Obscure precious metals (such as rhodium): Too obscure for this book
in today’s marketplace . . . perhaps a Rhodium For Dummies . . . in the
future.
I also touch on base metals in Chapter 9 because they do deserve a spot in
some portfolios. In recent years, some base metals have seen their prices
double and triple. Those gains would qualify as “precious” in my book (at
38
Part I: Breaking Down Precious Metals 

least this book). Even though copper and nickel are readily found in the com-
position of your pocket change, they are base metals that offer investment
opportunities as well.
Benefits for Investors
You always need a good reason to do something, especially when you’re talk-
ing about where to put your hard-earned, inflation-ravaged money. I think
that precious metals in their various formats offer many benefits (see the 
following sections), and the sum total of these benefits makes them a com-
pelling choice as a part of your portfolio.
Safe haven
One point that you will hear on a regular basis from gold aficionados is that
gold and silver are real money that are someone else’s liabilities. For new-
comers to the world of precious metals that would be an intriguing statement.
What does it mean?
A currency such as the U.S. dollar is backed up by the “full faith and credit of
the United States.” You can surmise that a dollar is not money in the truest
sense of the word; it is a type of claim or liability backed up by the issuing
authority which is in this case the federal government. There was a time when
the U.S. dollar was redeemable in gold and silver. That dollar was backed up
by something that was universally considered a “unit of exchange” and a
“store of value,” which is what gold and silver were considered for literally
thousands of years. This was the whole point behind the “gold standard.”
As long as the dollar was backed by gold, it had strength and people had confi-
dence in it. Starting in 1913 with the creation of the Federal Reserve (America’s
“government central bank”), the dollar started to decouple from gold until 
the connection between gold and silver was totally severed during the Great
Depression. At that point, the spigots on producing dollars opened up. The U.S.
dollar started a long, slow-motion bear market where a dollar in 1913 is only
worth two cents today. In all that time, the dollar lost 98% of its value!
Precious metals such as gold were a different story. It has been said that a
single ounce of gold could have bought you a decent suit during the 1800s. If
you sold a single ounce of gold on December 24, 2006, you would have gotten
$620 (not including transaction fees) and that would have been plenty of dol-
lars to buy a nice suit for Christmas.
In good times and bad, precious metals have retained their value and earned
their title as a safe haven.
39
Chapter 3: The Beauty and Benefits of Metals

Privacy
In the world of financial assets, reporting such as 1099s is common. With cer-
tain types of precious metals vehicles, there is no reporting (for transactions
under $10,000 value). This is especially true of gold and silver collectibles
such as numismatic coins. Of course this does not relieve you of the obliga-
tion of paying taxes in the case of capital gains transactions.
Rules can change obviously especially in post-9/11 times so make sure that
you discuss your purchases and sales with your tax advisor.
Inflation hedge
In early 2006, Harry Browne died. I thought it was a great loss to the invest-
ment and political world. (He ran for President on the Libertarian platform in
1996 and 2000.) His claim to fame is that he is a legendary investor who was
right on the money during the 1960s and ’70s. One of the last books that he
wrote was a short book that was a concise, true gem of financial wisdom
called Fail-Safe Investing: Lifelong Financial Security in 30 Minutes (St. Martin’s
Press). In it he detailed a model portfolio that was easily constructed by the
average investor and it had performed very well in a variety of economic con-
ditions. It consisted of 25% each of cash, stocks, bonds, and . . . gold. He sug-
gested that you rebalance it each year to keep the 25% allocation.
Mr. Browne was keenly aware of the dangers of inflation, recession, and other
systemic problems that occur because of political and governmental misman-
agement (such as through inflation, taxes, and regulation). He recognized that
gold was not easily produced and manipulated by government. One question
that may pop up is “Can’t gold be produced as well?” Gold is mined but the
average annual addition of gold to our world gold supply is roughly 2%. That
physical limitation keeps gold growing at a pace that helps it to retain its value
yet plentiful enough to keep pace with population growth.
Dollar hedge
A dollar hedge seems synonymous with an inflation hedge since you’re deal-
ing with the same issue. But dollar hedge is more related to those who see the
dollar as an entity worth trading against. You can invest or speculate based
on the direction of the U.S. dollar as its own investment vehicle.
In the same way you can look at the relationship of a common stock to the
company it is attached to, you can look at a currency as it is attached to 
a country. There are definite similarities. When a country’s currency is strong,
it is to the rest of the world a representation of how strong or well-managed
the country is. During the 1980s and 1990s, the dollar was considered a
40
Part I: Breaking Down Precious Metals 

strong currency, but in this decade, due to factors including a ballooning
national debt and a large trade deficit, the dollar started a long decline.
Coupled with the fact that we keep printing more and more of it, that trend
will probably continue.
A hedge against the dollar can manifest itself in a variety of ways. For exam-
ple, some will speculate in the currencies of other countries because if one
currency declines in value then some other currency is probably rising. Of
course, the other currencies could also decline as well. The bottom line is
that gold and silver are solid choices as dollar hedges.
Confiscation protection
In Chapter 4 I spend some time dealing with the risks of precious metals and
in one segment the focus is on political risk. The issue was how government
can affect your investment. In the 1930s, the FDR administration authorized
government confiscation of gold and essentially banned ownership of gold.
But they exempted gold coins, having a recognized special value to collectors
of rare and unusual coins. 
Even in the extreme case of heavy-handed government intervention, gold can
still be a store of value.
Liquidity
Liquidity is an important benefit for investors. All liquidity really means is how
quickly you convert an asset to cash. Securities such as stocks and bonds are
very liquid assets. Assets such as real estate are not. Precious metals and
their related investments tend to be very liquid. Mining stocks, like other
stocks, can easily be sold in seconds either with a call to the broker or a visit
to a Web site. You can do likewise with options and futures (you get them and
get rid of them through your brokerage account).
In terms of physical metals, the most liquid precious metals are gold and
silver. If you have gold and/or silver coins, they are very liquid as you can go
to virtually any coin dealer store or Web site and quickly convert bullion or
numismatic coins to cash.
Numismatic coins carry a high markup so if you were to liquidate them you
may get only 70 cents on the dollar (or less). Most people sell their coins to
coin dealers but these dealers will basically offer you wholesale prices since
they will end up trying to resell the coins at retail. Consider selling coins to
other investors or collectors as they are easier to find now through the
Internet.

Chapter 3: The Beauty and Benefits of Metals

Portfolio diversification 
In the book Stock Investing for Dummies, 2nd Edition (John Wiley & Sons), I
wrote extensively on portfolio diversification. It was important to have stocks
in different sectors so that the overall portfolio could be safer yet still grow
without you having to reach for the antacid on those volatile days. In this
book, I get to tell you what I think is a good part of the diversification. Metals
mining stocks (and uranium) have been among the top-performing stocks in
the country in this decade. Yet, I am sure that many in the public haven’t real-
ized it. You already know about physical metals and their performance along
with their advantages. Their “disadvantages” are covered in Chapter 4. How
about the stocks?
Take Agnico-Eagle Mines Ltd. (symbol: AEM) for example. AEM is a Canadian
gold-mining stock listed on the New York Stock Exchange. You could have
purchased it at the beginning of the decade for around $5 a share. It hit $45 
in 2006 for a total long-term gain of 800% (not including dividends). If that’s
diversification, I want more of it. Other selective mining stocks in gold as well
as other metals (and uranium) had similar results. I realize that the key word
is “selective,” but you can find more details on choosing mining stocks in
Chapter 12. Yes, I spill my stock-picking guts there!
Your retort to me after that paragraph might be, “Gee, Paul, I’m sure that if 
I look hard enough that I will certainly find stocks that did just as well and
probably a heck of a lot better in totally different sectors. Why choose stocks
in the metals sector if there are also healthcare, biotech, and so on?” I’m glad
you asked. Or I’m glad that I wrote down that you asked what I’m glad you
asked.
In the realm of investing and speculating, the past is something you learn from
so that you can prepare for the future. In that prior example, AEM went up
800% in the same time frame that the asset it mined (primarily gold) went
from under $300 to over $650 an ounce (gold more than doubled). I, along
with an army of gold experts, see economic conditions that are very fertile
for gold to shoot past $1,000 and much higher in the coming years (more
exciting details on gold in Chapter 5). In the event that gold does go into four
figures, what happens to gold-mining companies that are profitably sitting on
millions of ounces of the stuff? Can you say “jackpot”?
It doesn’t stop there. Consider the rest of the metals that are covered inside
the pages of this book. Gold is great but there are also silver, uranium, and 
so much more. Cool profits in hot markets; I like the sound of that.

Benefits for Traders and Speculators
Traders and speculators want a market that makes profits easier to achieve.
The current and pending precious metals market offers an environment for
just that.
In the next sections, I want you to consider supply and demand as the ulti-
mate factors in your wealth-building pursuits.
Supply and demand
As a trader or a speculator, what do you think of when you hear the phrase
“supply and demand”? Say what? Do you think of Mrs. Krapalbee in your col-
lege econ course on the first day of the semester? Let me change that
dynamic. Think “profits.” When you understand this simple, age-old, founda-
tional economic idea and apply its eternal wisdom to today’s fast-moving,
modern markets, you can make a profit easier. This idea sits at the heart of
your trading/speculating success.
The natural resource (or commodities) sector is wonderfully positioned for
gains in the coming years. Breaking it down a step further, natural resources
can be neatly separated into two segments: finite natural resources and
renewable natural resources. Renewable natural resources include things 
such as corn, sugar, coffee, and so on. Now don’t get me wrong — I like 
these areas and they have been profitable markets since natural resources
have been in a multiyear bull market and it will continue for years to come.
But you know what happens with renewable resources. The news reports
“the coffee crop in Brazil will be down this season” and the price of coffee
goes up on the news and you say “time to percolate some profits!” and you
buy coffee futures. Then . . . as you smell the aroma of fresh-brewed money . . .
wham! The next report says “Chile expects record coffee harvest” and your
coffee futures nose-dive as you say “I knew I shoulda done cocoa instead!”
Well, I know that over-simplifies it and maybe I’m a little biased. These are
great markets with great opportunities but I prefer to speculate with finite
natural resources. Yes . . . by a country mile. Why?
Finite natural resources refer to resources that are not readily renewable or
replaceable. Good examples are oil, natural gas, base metals, uranium, and
precious metals. In other words, whatever we find that is above and below
ground . . . that’s it! No more. Our society ultimately finds substitutes, but
only if it really, really, really has to. That’s humanity. We go through a painful
transition as we move from one resource to the next but we hang on to the
43
Chapter 3: The Beauty and Benefits of Metals

original resource until a suitable substitute comes along. A good example 
is oil. Modern societies use oil and will keep using it until it’s gone, but
progress has been too slow into cleaner substitutes such as solar and wind
energy. In the meanwhile, think about the following dynamic:
 The world population keeps growing.
 The nations of the world keep expanding their money supplies.
 Finite natural resources are slowly being used up.
Put those three together and you have dynamic opportunities in things such
as . . . precious metals. The benefits for traders and speculators then become
obvious. I cover trading strategies in Chapter 16.
Huge gains potential
I have one client who opened a commodities brokerage account in late 2003
with $40,000. Options on silver futures were purchased. After a roller-coaster
ride complete with bone-jarring corrections, the account was worth over
$300,000 by May 2006. A 650% return in about two and a half years. Nice! That
doesn’t include the fact that the original $40,000 was taken out of the account
and sent back to her. Nicer! This was of course speculation but it was done
with only 10 percent of her money. Silver in that time frame went from under
$5 in 2003 to over $14 in May 2006.
What would happen to an account like that if silver was to go to its old high
of $50? Of course, $50 was its old high in 1980. Adjusted for inflation it would
be in three figures. That’s the type of potential that makes speculators salivate.
Trading versus speculating
I know an associate who likes to speculate and he hates trading. Trading is
too much work and it requires a lot of time, attention, and timing. Plus you
add in the transactions costs. After you factor it all in, you may make a profit
of . . . say a few hundred bucks. Now there are traders out there who make
some great profits and even a good living at it. Trading with options and/or
futures has a lot of advantages. As for me . . . I’m not a trader. I’m a speculator.
Being in a full-time business and helping to raise my two young boys means
that trading is not right for me. Successful trading takes a lot if you are going
to make it work. I prefer speculating because I can do all of my homework
and make a few transactions such as buying that small stock with great
potential or getting a long-dated option on, say, a silver futures contract 
and then wait for the fireworks. This has worked better for me.
44
Part I: Breaking Down Precious Metals 

The benefits of speculating
As I have mentioned before, speculating is akin to financial gambling, but if
you do your homework, you can greatly increase the odds in your favor. It is
possible to take a small amount of risk capital and parlay it into a much
larger sum. Here are some benefits of speculating:
 With knowledge, research and discipline it is possible to make great
money. During 2004–2006 virtually everyone of my long-term clients
either made good money or great money. I know real-life examples of
clients who turned $5,000 into $20,000 or more in a few months.
 You can do it with little money. I know several clients and students who
started with as little as $1,000 in futures options and some who started
with as little as $500 in stock speculating and all have made great profits.
 You can minimize your risk. Many think that to turn a small sum into a
great sum that you need more leverage. Not really; you can utilize vehi-
cles that have leverage with the risk of leverage (such as options).
Futures is a great area for speculating and I certainly cover futures (in
Chapter 14), but my favorite for speculating is options. Whether it’s options
on stocks or on futures, my belief and experience tell me that it is a great 
way to profit without incurring undue risk. The phrase “undue risk” sounds
loaded, but it will make sense. Futures carry risk beyond your purchase
price. You could get into futures with, say, $5,000 and within days lose the
entire sum plus still owe thousands. Yikes . . . who needs that?
This is why it is important that besides knowing the benefits of speculating
you should understand the risks before you begin transacting. For those who
want to speculate with unlimited profits while limiting risk and loss, consider
options. I love options and I get into greater details on them in Chapter 15.

Recognizing the Risks
In This Chapter
 Getting a grip on risk
 Figuring out how to minimize your risk
 Using risk-management tools
 Seeing how risk stacks up against return
I
n my financial seminars I spend a lot of time talking about risk because it
obviously needs to be dealt with, but also risk is entwined with the deep-
est desires of most investors . . . increasing return. It goes without saying (so
I’ll write it down) that the age-old equation in the world of investing is risk
versus return. This equation states that if you want a greater return on your
investment, then you have to tolerate greater risk. If you don’t want greater
risk, then you have to tolerate a lower rate of return. The world is full of pit-
falls and precious metals are no different but keep in mind that precious metals
can excel when your other investments don’t. Precious metals guard or hedge
against risks that can hurt conventional stocks, bonds, or other fixed-rate
vehicles. Here are some of the risks against which precious metals excel:
 Purchasing power risk: As inflation rears its ugly head, this results in
higher prices.
 Currency crisis: As nations increase their money supplies, the long-term
result is usually a crisis or even collapse of the currency.
 Geo-political risk: This can range from war to terrorism to international
strife.
 Systemic financial risks: When a crisis occurs due to problems with
vehicles such as derivatives.
A good example of the value of, say, gold or silver is what happened in
Zimbabwe in 2006. On paper almost everyone is a millionaire but most people
are really poor! The country underwent hyper-inflation as the inflation rate
hit the nose-bleed level of 914% in March 2006. Basic goods like a roll of toilet
paper soared to $145,750 (only 69 cents in U.S. dollars). Gee, that might
encourage some of their citizens to . . . uh . . . use Zimbabwe’s currency

instead. As incredible as that hyper-inflation was, it is actually not an odd
example because it also recently occurred in Argentina and Serbia and
numerous times across history. Those folks who had gold, silver, or other
hard assets fared much better than those who didn’t.
In this chapter, you not only get the chance to check out what types of risks
are associated with precious metals investing, but you also find ways to 
minimize those risks.
What Risk Means to You
Before I make you paranoid about risk, keep in mind that it is ubiquitous and
just a normal part not only in building wealth but also in living life. Heck, just
getting out of bed in the morning could pose a problem. Here are the various
types of risks (now that you are out of bed):
Physical risk
Now I don’t mean that you may hurt your back from picking up precious metals
(heavy metal is a different animal altogether). It just means that if you have
gold in physical form then you have to understand that having it has risks as
does owning any valuable property. You have to keep it safe. For some that
means keeping your physical metal (such as gold, silver, and platinum) pos-
sessions in a safe-deposit box at the bank. For others it means in a secure
hiding place at home.
You have to decide. Gold as a physical holding means you need to be con-
cerned about the risk of loss or theft. Then there’s relative risk; in other
words, what if your relative finds out? Removing some risk always means
common sense. After all, if gold hits $3,000 an ounce, I don’t think you should
be boasting about your investing skills at the local bar.
Market risk
Market risk may be the most prevalent risk associated with gold. Market risk
refers to the fact that whenever you buy an asset (physical, common stock,
and so on) its price is subject to the ups and downs of the marketplace. In
gold, as in many investments, the price can fluctuate and it could do so very
significantly. What if you buy today but tomorrow there are more sellers than
buyers in the gold market? Then obviously the price of gold would go down.
The essence of market risk in commodities such as precious metals is supply
and demand.
48
Part I: Breaking Down Precious Metals 

Another element of market risk can occur when you are involved in a thinly
traded market — in other words, there may not be that many buyers and sell-
ers involved. This is also called liquidity risk. This can happen, for example, in
futures. Although futures are usually a liquid market (an adequate pool of
buyers and sellers) there may be some aspects of it when it might not be that
liquid. Say that you want to sell a futures contract that you recently bought
that is not an actively traded contract. What if there are no buyers when you
want to sell? Your order to sell through the broker may sit there for a long
time. The sale price of the contract would drop and you would lose some
gain or even end up with a loss. Be sure to communicate with the broker
regarding how active that particular market is.
It is probably appropriate to place in this segment the market risk of mining
stocks. The stock of mining companies certainly can go up and down like
most any other publicly traded stock. Stock investors can sell stock when
they see or expect problems with the company. If, for example, you are con-
sidering a gold-mining company, the risk to consider is more that just the fact
that it is into gold and the commensurate market risks with gold itself. Also
consider the company. Is management doing a good job? Is the company
profitable? Are sales increasing? How about their earnings? Do they have 
too much debt . . . and so on. Mining stocks are covered in Chapter 12.
Exchange risk
This one sounds odd. What the heck is exchange risk? Well, it’s not a refer-
ence to currency exchange; exchange risk is a reference to the risks that
could occur at the exchanges where futures and options are traded. When
futures and options are transacted at the exchange such as at the Chicago
Board of Trade (CBOT) or the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX), they
are done so under the rules and regulations of the exchange. The exchange
can either purposely or accidentally encourage market outcomes by chang-
ing the rules and regulations on an ongoing basis.
A real-life example happened in the Spring of 2006 with silver futures at the
NYMEX. Silver was rallying nicely as speculators were buying into silver futures
contracts. There were great expectations for silver due to the then-pending
silver exchange-traded fund (ETF). (You can find out more information on
precious metals ETFs in Chapter 13.) The exchange decided to raise the
margin requirements on margin contracts to try to quell over-speculation.
When normally you could put down 10% to speculate on a futures contract,
the new amount would be raised to, say, 12% or 15% or possibly more. When
you require people to put more funds in for the ability to speculate then of
course you will diminish that activity. If the margin requirements are raised
too high that will result in more selling. More selling results in prices dropping.
49
Chapter 4: Recognizing the Risks

The exchanges want an orderly market and they may change regulations or
adjust requirements to encourage or exact an outcome. Sometimes that out-
come may result either purposely or accidentally in a negative way for you.
Here are the three events that may happen at an exchange:
 Changing margin requirements: I gave an example above and this is the
most common event that an exchange could enact.
 Liquidation only: This is a rare event but it can happen. This means that
the exchange may temporarily restrict the buying side and only selling
can occur thus forcing the price down. This occurred with silver in 1980
when it hit its then all-time high of $50.
 Halt trading. Another rare event. The exchange may temporarily halt
trading in a particular futures contract.
Political risks
Political risk is probably one of the biggest dangers that investors and specu-
lators don’t see coming. It is the one that comes out of the blue and blindsides
your portfolio. Political refers to politicians who in turn run government. As
far as we are concerned, political risk and governmental risk can be synony-
mous. In my seminars I mention that politicians are Dr. Frankenstein while
government is Frankenstein’s monster. The bottom line is that political risk
means that government can change laws and regulations in a way that can
harm your investment or financial strategy. This can happen in your own
country or by another country. Consider what happened in the 1930s right
here in America.
In 1934, FDR and congress passed the Gold Reserve Act which made gold
ownership illegal. Had you bought gold in prior years to preserve your
wealth in the midst of the Great Depression, well . . . you were now out of
luck. FDR then issued a presidential order fixing the price of gold at $35 an
ounce which stuck for decades to come. FDR didn’t want private citizens 
to have an alternative outside of the official paper currency.
Fast forward to our times. Political risk is alive and well (unfortunately). In
many countries such as Bolivia and Venezuela, the government nationalized
properties (government taking private property by force) by foreign compa-
nies, among them, mining companies. Had you owned stock in these mining
companies you would have seen the share prices drop. Sometimes the share
prices drop at the mere threat of government action. In 2005, for example, the
Venezuelan government mentioned that it may take property owned by the
Toronto-based gold-mining company, Crystallex International. Its share price
fell by a whopping 50% in a single day. Venezuela’s dictator Chavez did increase
taxes on many foreign companies while nationalizing some industries (maybe
he needed the funds to buy toilet paper from Zimbabwe).
50
Part I: Breaking Down Precious Metals 

That’s the problem with political risk. As an investor or speculator, you could
do all your homework and make a great decision with your portfolio backed
up by great research and unflinching economic logic and still lose money
because of a government action that could have been unforeseen.
An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. It is best to stay away from
investments (such as mining companies) that are too exposed to risk in a
politically unstable or unfriendly nation. There are still plenty of precious
metals opportunities in politically friendly environments such as the United
States, Canada, Australia, and Mexico (at least until the next election!).
The risk of fraud
The risk of fraud is as real in precious metals as in every other human
endeavor. It’s tough enough trying to make a buck when the market seems
honest. But we must understand that as a market becomes popular or “hot”
so it becomes a target for scam artists. Fraud can materialize in a variety of
ways but I think that it can be safely categorized into three segments, which 
I discuss in the following sections: scams, misrepresentations, and market
manipulation.
Scams
Scams are those events that the consumer organizations always warn about.
The image is conjured up about those boiler-room operations where a slick
con artist calls up a little old lady in Pasadena and talks to her about riches
to be made in gold and silver if she could crack open her piggy bank and
send off a nice money order chunk of her savings. This is certainly a real risk
and it becomes more apparent when the source of potential fraud is popular.
When Internet auctions became a hot consumer area, there were more Internet
auction–related scams. When the real estate market became red-hot in 2005,
there were more real estate scams. When precious metals become the
“bubble du jour” then we will need to be wary of scammers here as well.
Misrepresentations
I put this as a separate topic because it can be a different animal. Basically
the point is that you may put your money into a venue and you may not be
getting what you think you are buying. A good example is what the respected
silver analyst Ted Butler recently warned about regarding silver certificates.
There have been millions of silver certificates issued in recent decades but
there is the real possibility that there isn’t any real silver backing them up. In
other words there are purchasers of silver certificates who believed that they
could convert their paper into actual silver in due time but in fact will not be
able to. That sounds like misrepresentation to me.
51
Chapter 4: Recognizing the Risks

Market manipulation
Earlier in 2007, the financial media reported a serious matter regarding naked
short selling among the smaller stocks. Short selling can send the stock’s
price plummeting. Some large brokers and their clients have been caught ille-
gally profiting through a manipulative technique called naked short selling.
This was an especially egregious activity with the stock of smaller mining
companies. In naked short selling, the perpetrator can sell massive quantities
of stock essentially created out of thin air to force the price of the stock to
come crashing down. Imagine if you owned shares of a small mining company
and you saw the share price plummet by 40% or 50% or more for no apparent
reason.
Minimizing Your Risk
Including precious metals (to whatever extent) in your portfolio minimizes
risk because precious metals, such as gold and silver, have historically
helped investors in times of economic uncertainty and political and financial
tensions in the world at large. The long-term picture for precious metals
should continue to bear this out. But as this chapter points out, nothing is
without risk. Precious metals do carry risks and you can minimize your 
risks — just check out the following sections.
Gaining knowledge
I remember getting into options on silver futures some years ago. It was early
2004 and silver was rising very well and my account was performing superbly.
I thought to myself “gee what a genius am I!” then along came April 2004.
Silver plummeted by nearly 40%. I thought to myself “gee what a moron am I!”
In retrospect, it worked out just fine and I made some great profits but I was
sweating bullets that spring. Seeing the value of your “investment” drop by
40% can make you freak out. I would have jumped out the window but I’m on
the first floor. The point is that I learned that precious metals futures and
options can have very wide and scary price swings. That is the nature of the
market.
In fact it is not uncommon for precious metals to correct by 20% to 30% or
even more at least once a year (I’ve come to learn that a “correction” seems
awfully incorrect at the time).
The terms correct or correction means that a market came back down after
going up too far and/or too fast. Don’t confuse a market correcting with a
market experiencing a bear market. The correction is a temporary pull-back
in the price of the asset that is in a long-term bull market or rising market.
The term bear market means that the asset is in a long-term falling or
52
Part I: Breaking Down Precious Metals 

decreasing market. In other words, the difference between a correction and 
a bear market is the same difference as fainting and dropping dead. In the
former you recover and get back on track.
Being disciplined
When markets go up and down, it can be difficult to stay disciplined. Markets
can’t be controlled by individual investors, but investors can and should
exercise self-control. People can let their emotions overrule their thinking
and do the wrong things when they ought to do the opposite. It happens
especially in fast-moving markets.
My client (I’ll call him Bob) had put $2,000 in a commodities brokerage
account. Under my guidance he purchased some options on silver futures.
Within a few weeks the value shrunk to $900. Imagine that; he was down 55%.
Of course he was very concerned (wouldn’t you be?), and we discussed the
situation. I told him to stay the course because my research told me that the
underlying asset (silver) was in a bull market and that this drop in price was
a temporary condition. In addition, the options that were purchased had two
full years to go before they expired (options are covered in Chapter 15). This
is an example of what happens in the marketplace; no matter how solid your
research and logic, the market can go against you. If your research and logic
were sound then the odds would swing back in your favor in due course. He
decided not to panic and stay the course.
For Bob, the discipline paid off. The $2,000 he speculated with became $4,000
a few months later as the silver market rebounded. Those options were
finally cashed in for $5,000 about 12 months after the initial purchase for a
gain of 150%. To this day, the account is still growing as we stayed disciplined
and bought (and cashed in) at points that made sense. Bob could have pan-
icked when it was at $900, cashed out, and leaped out the nearest window,
but thankfully he stayed disciplined and reaped some excellent profits.
When you are in fast-moving markets, have a plan in place regarding how much
you will put at risk, when you plan to get in, and under what conditions and
price points you will take profits (or losses).
Being patient
Everyone wants to get rich quick. Who wouldn’t like to make a fast buck?
Well, people who reach for the fast gains end up with fast losses. I can say
with confidence (verifiably) that the vast majority of my long-term clients
made money and in many cases a lot of money, but the key to their increase
has been patience. The year 2006 is a great example.
53
Chapter 4: Recognizing the Risks

A new batch of stock-investing clients came on board during the spring of
2006. At this time, the precious metals (and base metals) were having a fan-
tastic rally. In this real-life example I want to highlight those that were in
mining stocks. There were investors who came in and immediately saw their
accounts go down by mid-summer as a correction took place. Take a different
client (a real client with the fictitious name Fred). Fred came on board in
February 2006 with $10,000 and closed out his account 16 weeks later with
$9,800. He got impatient and ended up losing $200. I feel bad that he lost $200
and I wasted my time coaching him during that brief period of time. The amaz-
ing thing is that had he continued his account, he would have been profitable
in a few weeks and he would have had over a 30% gain on his positions in only
a few months. A little patience could have made Fred a winner soon enough.
In a nutshell I think that impatience has been the greatest “personal” problem
among investors in this decade. I’m not just saying this for long-term investors;
the same goes for traders and speculators. Very often, that investment or
speculative position you underwent may go down or sideways for what seems
like forever. Sooner or later, if you chose wisely, others notice it too and the
payoff can then be swift and impressive.
Diversification
The advice to use diversification is probably the oldest advice in investing
(right after “don’t loan money to your relatives” and “use a tissue . . . ”).
Diversification in precious metals can mean several things. It could mean
spacing out your money among different metals (some precious metals and
some base metals). It could mean spreading your money among different
classes of investment vehicles (a mix of gold- and silver-mining stocks along
with a precious metals mutual fund). For speculators it may mean deploying
strategies that could benefit in up or down markets (such as using an option
combination like the long straddle — more details in Chapter 15).
You can even diversify when you are speculating on a single vehicle. Last year
most of my clients with commodities accounts were overwhelmingly in silver
futures options. It is indeed a high-risk approach but it paid off very well.
Silver that year ended up 45% and most of the silver futures options were up
in triple digit percentages (sweet!). But, where possible, the options strate-
gies involved a diversified mix of strike prices, time frames, and some hedg-
ing, meaning that you do something in the account that could do well if the
market goes against you. Hedging is covered in greater detail in Chapters 14
and 15.
54
Part I: Breaking Down Precious Metals 

Since this book covers the world of precious metals I can cover diversifica-
tion in this area, but it’s important to understand that this singular area
should only be a single slice of your total financial picture. You need to
address other areas of your situation such as . . .
 Money in savings
 Reduce and manage liabilities (such as debt, taxes, and so on)
 Money in conventional investments such as stocks and bonds
 Real estate and other tangible assets
 Insurance and other risk-management tools and strategies
 Pension matters and retirement security
It’s not a complete list but it’s important to point out that whatever you do in
precious metals, it doesn’t happen in a vacuum. Hopefully you’ve looked at
your entire financial picture and the economic/political landscape, and you’ve
discovered that the best way to protect and grow your wealth in these times
is by diversifying into . . . precious metals!
Diversification can be accomplished in two ways:
 Add precious metals into your portfolio to gain benefits that may not be
there with other, more traditional investments.
 Have both physical metal (such as gold and/or silver bullion coins) and
paper investments (such as mining stocks and precious metals ETFs),
which make you diversified inside the precious metals portion of your
portfolio.
Making risk your friend
I realize that after writing an entire chapter on risk that you may think that
risk is a terrible concept; however, some things in this world thrive on risk.
The world can be an uncertain place and many potential events and entities
out there have no problem with raining some bad news on the U.S. economy
in general (and your portfolio in particular). When those types of risks
become evident, precious metals revert to their historical role as a safe
haven. Without risk, how can you grow your money faster? It is a necessary
part of your success and in many cases it is the reason for your success.

Risk is not like the weather (“Everyone talks about it but nobody does any-

are some proven strategies:
 Buy the dips. If you bought what you think is a great stock at $10 per
share and a correction hit sending it down to $8, don’t just crawl under 
a rock and wait it out; if possible buy some more. Why not? If it is truly a
great stock and your research and logic tell you it’s still a solid invest-
ment, buy some more. Ultimately time will pass and the odds are good
that when that stock goes to $12 or $15 or more you’ll end up saying
“Gee whiz! I coulda had it at $8!” No guts . . . no glory.
 Keep cash on the sidelines. This goes in tandem with the above point.
Have some money sitting somewhere safe, liquid, and earning interest
waiting for an opportunity. I tell my students that if they’re ready to take
the plunge with, say, $10,000 don’t invest everything in one shot. Invest
half now and stagger the rest in over a few weeks or a few months.
Opportunities go hand-in-hand with risks so do the Boy Scout thing 
and be prepared.
 Utilize stop-loss orders. If you have a brokerage account, and it’s with 
a major firm with a full-featured Web site, that firm has some excellent
risk-management tools available for you. The most commonly used tool
for keeping your portfolio’s value intact is the stop-loss order. If you
bought a stock at $10 then put a stop-loss order in at, say $9, or 10%
below the purchase price. That way, if the stock goes up there is no limit
to the upside but if the stock goes down and hits $9 a sell order is trig-
gered and you get out. You minimize loss. A stop-loss order can be acti-
vated for a single trading day or for an extended period of time (referred
to as a GTC order or good-’til-cancelled order). Stop-loss orders are a
common feature in a stock brokerage account, but they may not be in 
a commodities brokerage account. Find out more in Chapter 16.
 Consider put options. Put options are a great way to protect your invest-
ment during corrections or bear markets. They can be used as insurance
to protect gains or the original principal. The put option is too involved to
describe at this point, but I cover it in detail in Chapter 15.
Risk (or the lack of it) isn’t just where you put your money; it’s also how you
go about doing it. Nuff said.

Weighing Risk Against Return
After considering the risks, you may say “Gee, why have metals at all?” Well,
risk is a double-edged sword. Any (and all investments) have risks, and some
investments have great value because they protect you from risk, which is,
perhaps, the greatest value of precious metals. Before you check out the
track record, keep in mind that precious metals (especially gold and silver)
are back with a vengeance in this decade. Hey . . . why do you think I’m writ-
ing this book?!
To offset some of the risk potential that is inherent in any place you put your
money, use a very simple criterion, which I like to call the 10% rule: The most
you should have in any single vehicle is 10% of your money. Easy! Yes . . . you
could make it more precise, more customized, and more complicated. Go
ahead, but it’s good to have a starting point and a simple strategy before you
start to tweak and “optimize.”
Table 4-1gives you a neat summary of the major ways you can get involved in
precious metals based on risk. Use it to leapfrog into your investment of choice

 Finding data, info, and resources on the gold market
“G
oing for the gold” and “good as gold” and many other familiar
phrases mentioning gold have been around for what seems like 
forever but for good reason. Few things conjure up thoughts of wealth and
affluence the way gold does. I don’t recall any pirate in a B-movie shouting
“Aargh! There’s aluminum buried on that island, mateys!” On the other hand —
gold . . . now we’re talking. Few things have had the endurance of gold both
as a metal and as a store of value. It is then the first precious metal to consider
for wealth-builders today. It has through the ages become the quintessential
precious metal.
Gold is an element that is found on the standard periodic table of the chemi-
cal elements. Gold is listed there with the symbol AU and the atomic number
79 (don’t worry, the quiz has been cancelled). The most malleable and ductile
of the metals, you could actually take a single ounce of gold and essentially
stretch it out into 300 square feet (no, I don’t know why you would do it but it
sounds impressive). Gold is a good conductor of heat and electricity (and
probably thieves as well). Because it is generally resistant to rust and corro-
sion gold quickly became an ideal material to fashion into jewelry, coins and
therefore . . . money! The desirability of gold now became ensured.
However, as you read this book, every major society is inflating its currency
at record rates. All the major currencies are subsequently losing their value
slowly but surely. Because paper currencies are easily inflated, each unit of
currency (dollar, euro, yen, and so on) looses value — not so for gold. As a
tangible investment, use the sections in this chapter to find out how gold
stacks up amidst all the investment choices available today.

The Ancient Metal of Kings
Since the early days of civilization, gold achieved its status as a symbol of
wealth, a unit of exchange, and the essence of money. As an object of desire 
it had the qualities virtually everyone deemed as necessary to be called
“money”: It was a rare element that was easily carried and exchanged, and
was also a universal form of money that crossed nationalities and cultures.
When nations traded goods and services, gold could have easily had the
slogan “Don’t leave home without it.” For centuries gold had a place of 
honor in society — even after paper currencies came on the scene.
Paper currencies (also called fiat currencies) started coming into usage in the
days of Mesopotamia when the drachma was used. Paper currencies didn’t
have any intrinsic value like gold; it was more or less a claim to intrinsic value.
In other words, a paper currency had value because it had a claim of value
from another asset such as grain or precious metals. So, paper currency was
really an IOU. Paper currency gained popularity because it was easier to carry
and transact with versus carrying bags of coins.
Many ancient societies used paper currencies as an IOU, attaching precious
metals held at a bank or secure storage facility as the asset. So, the paper
currency had value as long as you could redeem the currency in precious
metals such as gold. During the course of history, paper currency soon
decoupled from gold and became a competitor instead. First kings and then
governments saw that paper currencies were a better alternative to gold . . .
or so they thought . . .
They discovered that paper currencies issued by the government had certain
advantages over gold — the main advantage was that paper currencies could
be printed at will while gold was not easily produced. The supply of gold
throughout history only grew at about 2% per year. On the other hand, paper
currencies could be produced very easily and very quickly. Although this
may have been the advantage of currency, this was also currency’s fatal flaw.
During the past 3,000 years, there have been literally thousands of different
paper currencies that came into existence and ultimately ended up van-
quished. When governments can create money by printing up endless sup-
plies of paper currencies then the temptation to inflate becomes too great. 
If you can create money at will, why not? This would fill up the government’s
treasury early on but as more money is created, its value diminishes and it
becomes worth less and less until it’s . . . well, worthless. Paper currencies
end up with the intrinsic value of nothing, but in the long run, gold is still
gold. Gold endures. Aargh, mateys!
As the Great Depression unfolded during the 1930s, most of the major indus-
trialized nations abandoned the gold standard in an attempt to stabilize their
economies. This unfortunately opened up a long-term problem as inflating
62
Part II: Mining the Landscape of Metals

their currencies became a way of life. The subsequent result is something
we’re all paying now . . . much higher prices.
Gold for the Record
We know that gold has a track record dating back thousands of years, but let’s
fast forward to recent times. In the late 1970s, gold experienced a 20-year
bear market, and then the bull market started earlier in this decade. The late
’70s was a time of inflation, energy problems, international conflict, and eco-
nomic hardship. Hmmm . . . does that sound familiar? The conditions in the
’70s definitely have a lot in common with this decade. From 2000 to mid-2007,
gold has begun a bullish, upward slope. Examining gold’s history and trends
impacts how you decide to invest, so take a close look at the sections that
follow to get an idea of gold’s history as well as its promising future.
Explaining all the bull
So after a 20-year bear market, gold awakened at the start of the millennium.
Gold (and other natural resources) was in the early stages of a bull market in
the early part of this decade and history suggests that this gold bull market
has the makings of a powerful up-trend that could easily last into the middle
of the next decade (and maybe longer). Why? Several reasons explain gold’s
historic bull market that is unfolding in front of our eyes:
 China and India: These two countries alone will have an economic impact
that will reverberate across the globe. Virtually every major economy
and financial market will be affected, directly or indirectly. As they mod-
ernize their economies and as their collective 2.5 billion occupants
increase their consumer spending, this will require much in the way 
of natural resources.
63
Chapter 5: Gold: All That Glitters
Causing trouble with Keynes
In 1923, the economist John Maynard Keynes
said that gold was “a barbarous relic.” He was
actually referring to the gold standard (having
paper currencies backed up by gold).
Considering the damage that ensued in the
coming decades from his policies, I can safely
call Mr. Keynes a barbarous relic right up there
with Karl Marx and the pet rock.
Unfortunately, he was probably right about the
gold standard because it was abandoned by
governments. The abandonment of the gold
standard by so many governments back then
(and that no major country has one today) will
probably be the primary reason why gold
investors today will ultimately benefit.

More specifically to the topic of gold, both of these countries have a long
history of being very gold friendly. India is a huge consumer market for
gold. China is loosening its formerly strict regulations and allowing its
ample citizenry the ability to own gold and build wealth in a freer econ-
omy. All of this adds up to great news for gold aficionados like you and
me. Whew . . . 2 billion people with money who like gold! Can you say
“soaring demand”? The tears are welling up in my eyes.
 The Middle East: In spite of all the conflict and turmoil, this area has
great potential. Although these countries wield economic and political
clout that offers great challenges to our country, this area is yet another
gold-friendly region. Many in the region are using their oil profits to buy
precious metals. This means more demand.
 Inflation everywhere: Perhaps the most compelling bullish reason is
that every major country in the world is growing its money supply at
historically high levels; most of them are growing their money supply 
at double-digit rates making this an unprecedented inflationary environ-
ment. This means more dollars chasing fewer goods.
 Other factors: Other factors will play a part in gold’s near and long-term
future. I cover these in Chapter 19.
Telling the tale of the tape: Gold 
versus other investments
Gold has retained its value through good times and bad but make no mistake
about it: It has an edge over other investments during difficult or uncertain
economic times. In the 1930s, gold was resilient during the Great Depression;
stock prices plummeted yet gold was strong. Gold did drop in price during
the 1930s but not because of market supply-and-demand factors; the govern-
ment banned private ownership of gold so people were essentially forced to
sell it.
So you’re better off comparing gold with other investments starting with the
1970s and moving onward (see Table 5-1). As of December 1974, gold owner-
ship became legal for private citizens. Just in time . . .
Gold shines brightest during periods of inflation (especially hyper-inflation).
In a period of stagflation, such as in the 1970s, hard assets (precious metals,
real estate, natural resources, and so on) tend to do better than paper assets
(such as stocks and bonds).

*Inflation isn’t an asset, of course, but it’s important to compare.
Table 5-1 is very telling. Certainly there are a year here and a month there
that show that gold performed poorly. But then, you’re not investing; you’re
trading or speculating. The table clearly shows that some common paper
investments just couldn’t keep pace with inflation. Notice the column for
inflation illustrates that you would need to have at least $14,755 in 2007 just
to match the same purchasing power of $10,000 in 2000. Gold resoundingly
beat inflation while paper investments fell short.
By the way, the above table might make you ask about gold-mining stocks
and how they fared during this period. A good barometer of the gold mining
industry would be an index found at the American Stock Exchange (www.
amex.com) called the Amex Gold BUGS Index (HUI). BUGS stands for “Basket
65
Chapter 5: Gold: All That Glitters

of Unhedged Gold Stocks.” The HUI is an index representing a batch of stocks
that are gold-mining stocks that do little or no hedging. Basically, hedging is
the practice of selling next year’s production at this year’s prices to lock in a
profit. This practice is fine if gold’s price is flat or declining. But if gold is
rising, then the company foregoes the potential profit. Done too excessively
in the wrong market conditions could spell bankruptcy for the company. I
explain hedging in more detail in Chapter 12 — it’s not a good practice in a
rising gold bull market.
Anyway, back to the HUI. How did it perform during the time frame as com-
pared to the other investments in the table? At the beginning of the decade,
the HUI started at 73.77 (1/3/00), and it ended the day of trading on June 30,
2007, at 329.35 for a total percentage gain of 346%. In other words, a $10,000
investment in a representative portfolio of gold-mining stocks that made 
up the HUI index at the beginning of the decade would have been worth
$44,626.27. Sweet! Yes . . . gold mining stocks are “paper” investments but for-
tunately they derive their value from a desirable underlying asset . . . gold.
Assuring gold’s success
Gold is a tangible investment that has its own intrinsic value. I know that
sounds weird, but this concept is important when you compare it to “paper”
investments. All paper investments are basically “derivatives,” meaning they
derive their value from another entity or from a promise from another party.
Think about paper investments and you see that they’re essentially a promise
that needs to be fulfilled. Paper investments have major risk associated 
with them: the risk of default by the other party. This is also referred to as
counterparty risk. Look at the panorama of paper investments:
 The dollar and other currencies: When you hold a dollar in your hand,
what are you holding? The dollar is a piece of paper with official printing
on it. It has no intrinsic value; it is a promise of value backed up by the
full faith and credit of the United States government. However, if the 
government (any government for that matter) prints up lots and lots of
dollars (monetary inflation), the risk is that each dollar becomes dimin-
ished in value.
 Stock: Stock, common or otherwise, represents a piece of ownership in a
public company. If the company is in business and doing well, the stock
for that company will have value. But what happens if the company goes
bankrupt? In that case, what will be the value of that stock beyond just
being a printed piece of paper? Therefore, stock also has the risk of
default.
 Bonds: A bond is a form of debt. If you have a bond investment, it is a
piece of paper that states that another party will pay you interest and
ultimately pay you back the sum of money (the principal) that was
66
Part II: Mining the Landscape of Metals

loaned. In the bond investment, you are the lender and the person oblig-
ated to pay you back is the borrower. What happens if the borrower can’t
(or won’t) pay you back? You could lose some or all of your money in a
bond. Because bonds are a paper investment they have the risk of default.
 Mortgages and loans: As this is being written in the summer of 2007,
markets across the globe are in turmoil because of problems with sub-
prime mortgages. A sub-prime mortgage is where money was loaned for
the purpose of buying real estate (typically a home) to individuals who
have below-average credit. The point is that mortgages and loans, like
bonds, are paper investments that have . . . you guessed it . . . the risk of
default. All situations of extending credit — whether it is a bond from a
corporation, government agency or some cash you loaned to your uncle
Stanley — run the risk of default.
Securing a Safe Haven 
from the Coming Storm
Understanding the value of gold is like understanding an umbrella without
discussing rain. People quickly see the value of an umbrella when it rains.
They also understand the value of buying an umbrella on a sunny day, espe-
cially when rain is forecast for the next day. To understand gold (as the
umbrella) you should understand its role in bad economic conditions 
(the rain).
Reading and understanding inflation
As more and more people wise up to inflation, ultimately they will do some-
thing about. Although inflation has been high in recent years and has the
potential to go higher, much of the public hasn’t caught on. I can’t say that I
blame them; the responsibility for informing the public rests squarely on the
shoulders of the government and the financial media. This is where I get angry.
The reporting of inflation is in fact dreadful. You should understand inflation
not only because of how it helps gold go up, but you should also understand
it because it is a pernicious and pervasive problem. The following sections
should help you sort through and gain an understanding of inflation.
Monetary inflation and price inflation
There are two types of inflation. One is a “problem” while the other is a “symp-
tom.” The “problem” is monetary inflation. That is just a fancy phrase for the
government’s central bank practice of printing money (actually, printing cur-
rency). The more a government prints, the more the supply of money grows.
67
Chapter 5: Gold: All That Glitters

After the money is created, it’s circulated through member banks. This money
makes its way into the economy through actually printed currency (such as
the dollar), electronic transfer, or through loans (credit). This is the problem.
The end result of the problem of monetary inflation is the next phenomenon,
price inflation. Price inflation is the one everyone talks about. That’s when
your uncle goes to the store and says to the sales clerk, “You’re charging how
much for this?!” Don’t get me wrong, price inflation can be a problem for you
and me but in the big picture, price inflation is the “symptom.”
“Headline inflation” and the CPI
The government reports inflation as something called the CPI or Consumer
Price Index. The CPI (in its various forms) is compiled and reported by 
the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS and its Web site are www.bls.gov).
Unfortunately, the government keeps changing the way it’s reported. An
example occurred as I was writing this chapter.
I went to the BLS Web site and tried out the agency’s inflation calculator. I put
the year 2000 into the inflation calculator and it told me how much buying
power $10,000 then would have today (August 2007). It gave me the amount
of $12,096.34, which seemed too low. When I put the numbers in a financial
calculator I get the annual inflation rate of 2.93%. Huh?! My dear reader, do you
know any consumer necessity that has gone up only 2.93%? I didn’t think so.
When you get a chance, head over to John Williams’ Shadow Government
Statistics (SGS) at the Web site www.ShadowStats.com. He compiles and
reports inflation the way the government used to report. Starting in 1994, the
federal government changed the way it reported inflation. The change low-
ered inflation by means such as substitution and other statistical methods
that can be used to lower the inflation rate. For example, if beef is too expen-
sive and the consumer switches to chicken, which is cheaper . . . poof! The
inflation rate is lower.
Anyway, SGS reconstructs the data to report inflation in the real world. Guess
what? The real rate of inflation would be a minimum of 6% (and actually
higher in some years). In other words, people think that inflation is lower
because of the reporting. What does all of this mean for you in this chapter
on gold? It tells you that it’s time to get an inflation hedge for your long-term
portfolio such as gold and silver.
The core rate of inflation
In the 1990s, the Federal Reserve started reporting something called the core
rate of inflation. What is it? The core rate is inflation excluding food and energy.
Say what? You’re giving me a rate of inflation that does not include food and
energy? Right. Are you insane? What good is it?
68
Part II: Mining the Landscape of Metals

The reason often stated for why the Fed and the financial media report the
core rate is because food and energy prices are too volatile. This is not an
adequate reason since food and energy are pervasive, and they are found in
every corner of a typical budget. But here is what irks me: The core rate gets
more headlines than even headline inflation. The core rate gets more atten-
tion than Paris Hilton, and it’s more misleading than “jumbo shrimp.”
When the core rate is constantly reported, more and more people then say
“Gee . . . it must be important!” and then react accordingly. For example, a
headline from a major financial news Web site read: “The core rate is at a
three-year low of 1.9%. The good news causes the Dow to rally 100 points.”
But that measly 1.9% doesn’t include food and energy. The problem is that
the data in recent years show most consumer necessities are up 6% to 9%
and even higher. Heck . . . I’m sure that the core rate could be almost zero if
you exclude more consumer necessities. While you’re at it, why don’t we
start reporting the price of clouds? I can see a great headline: “Cumulous
clouds are at 50-year low . . . Stock prices in stratospheric rise!” The bottom
line is that the core rate is useless and misleading. As a financial planner I
ignore it. After all, what consumer necessity has only gone up 1.9% in the
past year? I rest my case.
Why should gold investors (and the public in general) be annoyed at the core
rate? If investors (either by design or by accident) get the idea that inflation
is only 1.9%, then they will invest accordingly. They will assume a 4% certificate
69
Chapter 5: Gold: All That Glitters
Deflating inflation reporting
Why is inflation (the CPI) reported this way?
Why does the CPI under-report price inflation?
First, CPI is used as a deflator for the Gross
Domestic Product (GDP). The GDP is the total
market value of all final goods and services pro-
duced in our country in a given year (reported for
the four quarters). This number is equal to total
consumer, business and government spending
plus exports, less imports, and less inflation. The
emphasis is mine. What all that means is that if
inflation is lower, then the GDP is higher. Lower
inflation makes the economy look better and
higher inflation does not. When you calculate
inflation the old way, guess what? The U.S.
recently experienced a recession, and a lower
inflation number makes the picture rosier.
But there is another reason that is more signifi-
cant that you should know about. As you may
know, millions of senior citizens get Social
Security checks (and other pension checks). 
As you also know, they periodically get “cost-
of-living” increases. Question: how do they 
calculate that “cost-of-living” increase? It is
calculated from the official CPI. The lower the
CPI, the less money government has to pay all
of those retirees. The bottom line is this: If real-
world inflation is running at 6% (and more) and
you are a retiree getting a 2.93% increase, you
are falling behind (more and more) as the
months and years go by.

of deposit or a 5% bond is helping them financially because inflation is a “lowly
1.9%.” But . . . what would they do if they knew that inflation was really 6% to
9% and/or higher? Then they would adjust their portfolios to include more of
those investments that would meet or beat the rate of inflation; such as . . .
food and energy! In other words, consumer staples, natural resources, energy
and . . . precious metals. Got gold?
Watching the dollar
The dollar is the “other side of the coin” so to speak. When people refer to
“rising inflation,” they’re really referring to the falling value of the dollar (or
other currency). When you look at the long-term chart of gold versus the U.S.
dollar (Figure 5-1), you will see the dollar zig-zagging downward and gold zig-
zagging upward. It stands to reason that the more and more dollars you add
to the system, the less each unit is worth.
If there was ever a picture that was worth a thousand words, it’s that one. (Of
course, when you adjust it for inflation, it is actually worth 1,200 words).
To monitor the price of the U.S. dollar (as a trading currency), you can go to
major financial Web sites, such as Market Watch (www.marketwatch.com)
and Bloomberg (www.bloomberg.com). Futures markets-related Web sites
also track the dollar (along with other currencies) so you can check out
places such as Future Source (www.futuresource.com), FX Street (www.
fxstreet.com) and Yahoo! Finance (www.finance.yahoo.com).
Buying and owning gold

In addition to the above list is yet another way to invest in gold, and this is 
an interesting way to do it . . . with no downside risk. It’s a gold bullion CD
issued by Everbank (www.everbank.com). Called the “Marketsafe Gold
Bullion CD,” it’s similar to regular bank certificates of deposit (it even is pro-
tected by FDIC insurance). However the investment return on it is not based
on interest but is instead tied to the price of gold. If gold goes up, your CD
rises in value. However, if gold goes down, the CD does not. They even have a
similar CD for silver. Go to their Web site for more details.
The Gold Market
Gold is a worldwide market and the long-term supply-and-demand fundamen-
tals are very bullish. The following sections give you some insights into the
gold market.

Gold market data and information
The more you know about what is happening in the gold market, the better
prepared you will be to profit. The following organizations provide extensive
research and data on the yellow metal:
 Gold Fields Mineral Services (GFMS): Gold Fields Mineral Services is
probably the leading global consulting firm doing specialized research
on the world’s precious metals market, specifically gold, silver, platinum,
and palladium. GFMS is based in the United Kingdom and has offices and
representatives stretched across the globe.
The lead executives, Philip Klapwijk (Chairman) and Paul Walker (CEO),
are active on the conference circuit and their articles are regularly pub-
lished and worth reading. Find out more about GFMS at their Web site
(www.gfms.co.uk).
 CPM Group: CPM is another leading consulting firm that specializes in
commodities and precious metals research. They provide extensive
research on the precious metals markets and publish their work in sev-
eral annual yearbooks: The GoldYearbook, The Silver Yearbook, and The
Platinum Group Metals Yearbook. The CPM Group was founded in 1986
by Jeffrey Christian, a metals analyst and the author of the book
Commodities Rising. Its Web site is www.cpmgroup.com.
 Gold Anti-Trust Action Committee (GATA): The Gold Anti-Trust Action
Committee was formed in January 1999 by well-known gold analyst Bill
Murphy. GATA advocates and undertakes litigation against illegal collu-
sion between financial institutions (such as central banks and large bro-
kerage firms) that intervene in the gold market. GATA’s aim is to foster a
more free market for gold since the central banks and brokerage firms
have on an ongoing basis managed to control the price and supply of
gold and related financial securities. More information on the topic of
political market intervention in precious metals is in Chapter 19. GATA’s
Web site is www.gata.org.
 World Gold Council (WGC): The World Gold Council was created by gold
mining companies and refiners in 1987. Its mission is the promotion of
investment and usage of gold by consumers, investors, industry, and
central banks. The WGC’s Web site is www.gold.org.
 National Mining Association (NMA): The NMA is the voice of the
American mining industry in Washington, D.C. and the only national
trade organization that represents the interests of mining before
Congress, the Administration, federal agencies, the judiciary and the
media (www.nma.org).

Industrial supply and demand
The major determinants for gold’s performance (its price going up or down)
boil down to inflation and supply-and-demand factors.
Total demand and supply
Let me give you the big picture first. In recent years, total average annual
worldwide demand has been in the range of 3,800 to 4,000 tons. Total average
annual worldwide supply (coming on board from mines, and so on) is in the
range of 2,500 to 2,700 tons. Because of the slight reporting differences from
several sources, I thought it best to give a reliable range. The bottom line is
that there is an annual shortfall in the range of 1,100 to 1,500 tons, depending
on which numbers you calculate.
No matter which way you slice it, the big picture in the long-term is that
supply-and-demand factors for gold are bullish.
Demand
Demand for gold comes from two places: investment and industry. Industrial
demand is roughly 10% to 15% of worldwide annual demand. Gold has unique
properties which mean more applications of it in technology, healthcare, and
other vital industries. Gold is extremely resistant to corrosion and it has high
thermal and electrical conductivity. Therefore, it is an excellent component in
electrical devices. Gold is also used in medical equipment because it is resis-
tant to bacteria. New uses for gold have been found in pollution control
equipment and fuel cells. In addition, gold has promising application in 
the new area of nanotechnology. The practical uses for gold keep growing.
(Hmmm . . . I wonder how much they would offer me for my wife’s jewelry?)
For current news on the many new ways gold is being used in industry and
medicine, check out gold’s growing uses UtiliseGold at www.utilise
gold.com.
Supply
Gold is mined on all the major continents. Specifically, it has been most plen-
tiful in places such as South Africa, Canada, the United States, Russia, and
Australia. There is no mining in Antarctica but then again, why would you
want to? At present there are over 400 mines active across the globe. With
supply from these mines coming on board in the range of 2,500-2,700 tons,
this means that the world supply of gold increases by roughly 2% per year.
That’s significant. Why?
73
Chapter 5: Gold: All That Glitters

For thousands of years, gold was (and is) considered money. It has outlived
thousands of currencies, and in due course, it will outlive more currencies.
Part of the reason for its durability as a desirable form of money is directly
tied to its rarity. You can create lots of paper currencies almost instantly but
you can only increase gold by a mere 2% per year. It is easy to inflate man-
made currencies and history tells you this has happened very, very often. It
is happening today! But . . . it’s not easy to inflate gold.
Although new mines do come on board every year, it doesn’t have a signifi-
cant impact on total worldwide supply since old mines do close down after
no more gold is found. In addition, it often takes mines 5 to 10 years (some-
times longer) to go from discovery to production. Although increased market
prices for gold are indeed an incentive for more gold exploration, it doesn’t
happen quickly. It does take years to translate higher market prices into new
gold mine discovery and production.
When the price of gold does go up significantly, gold “scrap” does find its way
into the marketplace. Scrap is basically recycled gold. As the price of gold goes
up, it becomes more economical to recover scrap to refine it and reuse it.
Investment demand
Since the beginning of the decade and obviously due to gold’s bull market,
investment demand has grown tremendously. Actually, according to market
studies by the CPM Group, a very unusual situation had arisen during 2006–07.
In that time, private investors (as a collective group) owned more gold than
the group of central bankers. The first time in world history!
Much of the new investment demand comes from two sources: the popularity
of precious metals-related exchange-traded funds (ETFs: more on those in
Chapter 13) and from international investors such as from China, India, and
the Middle East. More and more investors are seeing the big picture, and they
understand that gold has unique advantages and is a good part of a well-bal-
anced portfolio.
Central banks
Central banks play a pivotal role in the gold market and sometimes that role
can be a controversial one. It stems from the “love/hate relationship” 
that central banks have with gold (maybe they need therapy). On the one
hand, central banks are the single largest holders of gold in the world. Most
governments have gold as an asset in their official reserves. Yet, on the other
hand, gold is a “competitor” to the currency that is issued by the central bank
on behalf of its government.
74
Part II: Mining the Landscape of Metals

You’ll notice that whenever gold is rallying, one or more of the central banks
will either announce a large sale of gold or actually sell a large amount of it.
And they have a considerable amount of the yellow metal; it is estimated 
that central banks along with other governmental institutions (such as the
International Monetary Fund) hold roughly 20% of the world’s above-ground
supplies of gold. This stockpile is approximately 30,000 tons (that’s tons, not
ounces) of gold.
Keep in mind that not all central banks work in unison. Some are buying gold
while others are selling. Although the central banks have much autonomy
about how to manage their individual gold reserves, most of the major cen-
tral banks have agreed to do their buying and selling according to guidelines
stipulated in agreements such as the 1999 Central Bank Gold Agreement
(CBGA). You do see some interesting developments in recent years.
Central banks in “the West” such as the U.S. Federal Reserve and central banks
in Western European governments (such as the United Kingdom, France,
Spain, and others) have been net sellers of gold. Meanwhile, central banks in
the East (both middle and far) have been net buyers of gold. This tends to
generally reflect attitudes about gold in both spheres. Folks in Asia and
peripheral regions as groups embrace gold far more than those in North
America and Europe. As a total group, it has been a net seller which was a
contributing factor to some of those steep corrections that have been experi-
enced by precious metals investors in recent years.
Central banks don’t have to just buy and sell their gold to influence the market.
They are also involved in activities such as gold derivatives and in leasing
gold. More about some of these activities in Chapter 19.
Central banks report their gold position and activities to the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) and you view some of this information at the Web site
at www.imf.org.
Gold Bugs
The term “gold bugs” has sometimes been used as a pejorative but many vet-
eran gold analysts and well-known commentators have come to wear the name
like a badge of honor. The following is really like a “hall of fame” for the world
of gold since some of these stalwarts (actually most of them) were successful
and active back in the late 1970s.
What these folks have in common goes beyond an affinity for gold investing.
Through the years they have offered research and insights that benefited the
gold-investing community for decades. Some of their forecasts became 
75
Chapter 5: Gold: All That Glitters

legendary. Yes, they have had their misses, but in the investment world,
when you have far more hits than misses and keep doing it for years and
even decades, this is something we can’t ignore.
To me, another reason for checking them out is that I like to know that you
just don’t talk the talk you need to also walk the walk. If I know that the
person involved made a lot of money on his or her own advice, that goes
much further than people who tell you to invest in X and then you find out
that they made most of their money by selling reports and newsletters about
“How to invest in X.” In other words, these folks are primarily self-made in
their financial independence due to the adherence and application of their
own knowledge.
Drum roll please! Here is a pantheon of gold bugs worthy of the name:
 Howard Ruff (www.rufftimes.com)
 Jay Taylor (www.miningstocks.com)
 Doug Casey (www.kitcocasey.com)
 James Sinclair (www.jsmineset.com)

 James Turk (www.goldmoney.com)
 Mary Anne and Pamela Aden (www.adenforecast.com)
 Harry Schultz (www.hsletter.com)
 Adam Hamilton (www.zealllc.com)
By the way, they’re still all more bullish than ever on gold (and other precious
metals). ’Nuff said.

Discovering the Secret of Silver
In This Chapter
 Understanding a unique metal with dual benefits
 Finding silver market information
 Exploring a future with a silver lining
S
ilver is hands-down my favorite precious metal. Maybe it’s because it’s
more affordable than gold. Maybe it’s because I like the color better. Oh
wait . . . now I remember: When I buy my wife silver jewelry instead of gold I
still have some cash left to buy something for my boys! Well, really . . . I like
silver most because of the great profit potential that I think it will generate. It
has served me well in recent years and there is no reason why that shouldn’t
continue (and get better!) in the coming years.
Silver started the decade at around $4 and in early 2007 silver hit $14 an
ounce — it did very well. I believe that the conditions for it to beat its old
high ($50 in 1980) are excellent in the next few years. I think devoting a 
whole chapter to the poor man’s gold is a good idea. Silver’s future profit
potential is truly its silver lining (you were expecting that line . . . right?).
Understanding the Hybrid 
Potentials of Silver
Silver is a fascinating metal and it has the unique, dual quality of being both a
monetary metal (used as money) and an industrial metal. This lies at the
heart of its potential. There are countries that are reconsidering the use of
silver again in their currencies. Meanwhile, more uses for silver in technology
and healthcare mean more opportunities for silver investors and speculators.
Silver is unique in that no other metal combines strength with a softness that
allows it to be formed and stretched. You would be hard-pressed to find a
metal that conducts electricity as well or is as pliable, corrosion, or fatigue

resistant. Nothing else has such high-tensile strength, is wear resistant, has
such a long functional life, or is as light sensitive. Silver endures extreme tem-
peratures, conducts heat, reflects light, provides catalytic action, and has a
great reputation for its bactericidal qualities. It alloys (easily combines with
other metals) and helps to reduce friction. Due to its exceptional properties
and reasonable price, there is no substitute for silver.
Monetary uses for silver
For centuries gold and silver were used as money. Silver was probably more
widely used since gold was too expensive for day-to-day use. Silver was not
as valuable as gold as a monetary unit so it served nicely for the smaller
transactions. Silver was used in ancient times and it was part of our currency
in the United States since colonial times. It was regularly used in our coinage
(up to 90% silver content) as dimes, quarters, and higher denominations until
1964. From 1965 onward, dimes and quarters ceased having silver content.
Halves commemorating John F. Kennedy contained 40% silver content from
1965 to 1970 before joining the other coins and only having base metal (such
as copper and nickel) in their composition. If you see any of those old silver-
content coins appear in your change — keep them! A silver coin is far more
valuable for its metal content than for its face value. Silver (and gold) coins
are covered in Chapter 11.
Silver is rarely used in coinage for general circulation today. The exception
was for special collectible issues that the U.S. Mint did from time to time. In
1986 the U.S. Mint did start minting the silver eagle, which quickly became
prized by collectors and investors (see Chapter 10).
Industrial uses for silver
In the past, the primary engine of industrial usage for silver was photography.
As traditional photography started slowly going the way of the buggy and the
corset, the true strength and versatility of silver started to come forward.
David Morgan of www.silver-investor.com makes a fascinating point
about silver: There are more new patents with silver than with all other metals
combined. There are thousands of industrial applications for silver. As a matter
of fact, out of all the commodities in use in our economy, only petroleum is
used in more different ways. (Of course, I am also bullish on energy.)
The largest use of silver comes from industrial demand, jewelry/silverware,
and photography, in that order. Although photography has gotten all the
attention in recent years, of the three major categories, it is the smallest.
80
Part II: Mining the Landscape of Metals

Industrial demand for silver makes up 43% of total demand, and this area is
also the fastest growing area of silver demand. The industrial portion of the
market is growing at about 2% per year. It is important to understand that in
almost all instances, the amount of silver used in a cellphone, laptop computer,
or microwave oven is so small that it cannot be recovered. For all practical
purposes, the silver used in these applications is lost and unrecoverable.
This type of demand is called price-inelastic by economists. The small amount
of silver that is used makes it an insignificant factor in the price of the product.
The amount of silver used in the manufacture of a battery, an automobile, a
computer, or cellphone is insignificant when compared to the price of labor
and other materials. A doubling in the price of silver would not affect, for
example, what Honda uses in making an automobile. Since the price of silver
has such a small relationship to the cost of the finished product, there is
really no substitute. If the price of silver went to over $100 per ounce, for
example, the only possible substitute for silver would be palladium or plat-
inum, both costing much more than $100 per ounce.

Chapter 6: Discovering the Secret of Silver
Sorting through silver’s many uses
The multiple uses for silver started growing
almost exponentially as industry figured out that
silver’s unique properties made it an ideal com-
ponent in a broad array of products. Here is a
partial list:
 Bactericide
 Batteries
 Bearings
 Brazing and soldering
 Catalysts
 Clothing (lining to kill bacteria)
 Coins
 Computer components
 Electrical
 Electronics
 Electroplating
 Jewelry and silverware
 Medical applications
 Mirrors and coatings
 Nanotechnology
 Photography
 Plasma screens
 Solar energy
 Super conductivity
 Surgical instruments
 Washing machines
 Water purification
Yes . . . it is a partial list and it keeps growing.

Researching Silver
Making fantastic profits in anything is not easy, and silver is no different.
Even when you think a speculation is a slam dunk, it can backfire in the short
term. You need to be armed with market intelligence. You need the facts, and
if you’re seeking options, then get informed opinions from long-established
sources.
Sources of data
Sometimes opinions are no more valuable than fiat currency (normally a solid
laugh line at precious metals conferences). In other words, get the facts.
Silver investors and speculators fortunately live in the best of times when it
comes to gaining access to reliable information. With some time and effort at
a good business library and the Internet, of course, you can find the informa-
tion necessary to render an informed decision. The following sections list the
top sources.
The Silver Institute
Established in 1971, the Washington, D.C.–based Silver Institute is a nonprofit
international association with members that span across the silver industry.
They regularly track the sources and uses of silver and they publish their
research in their World Silver Survey. Their recent research was made avail-
able in reports covering topics such as the Chinese Silver market and a study
of stockpiles of silver around the world. More information can be found at
www.silverinstitute.org.
The CPM Group
The CPM Group is a research and consulting firm that specializes in the metals
industry. They produced annual studies in the individual precious metals
(called yearbooks) and the most relevant one is the CPM Silver Year Book
2007. Their research includes data on production, consumption, and silver
output. More details are at www.cpmgroup.com.
New York Mercantile Exchange
For those seeking market data on silver futures and options, go to the source:
the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) at www.nymex.com. Silver is
just one commodity traded at NYMEX but you can find relevant information
on silver and this fast-moving market.
SilverStrategies.com
For those researching silver companies, market data, and relevant news, Silver
analyst Sean Rhakimov’s www.silverstrategies.com is worth a visit.
82
Part II: Mining the Landscape of Metals

Sources of informed opinion
As silver and precious metals in general become more popular and visible,
more and more newsletters and advisory services start to come out of the
woodwork. When a new batch of “experts” and “gurus” emerge, that might
tell you that it’s a popular market, but it becomes a dart-throwing exercise
when it comes to choosing the ones that have helpful guidance and informa-
tion. Who do you turn to?
I think it’s good to turn to those sources that have had a consistent track
record and have followed the silver market for years in both up and down
markets. Two that specialize in silver are the Morgan Report (at silver analyst
David Morgan’s www.silver-investor.com) and the Silver Stock Report
(silver analyst Jason Hommel at www.silverstockreport.com). Ted Butler’s
essays and features are provided at www.investmentrarities.com. Doug
Casey’s International Speculator also does a great job covering silver stocks
(www.kitcocasey.com).
There are many gold advisory services that also report on silver opportuni-
ties and they can be found in Chapter 5.
Owning Silver
To maximize your profit opportunities and provide some safety and a measure
of diversification, get involved in both physical ownership as well as paper
investments of silver. Owning physical silver is a solid, long-term, buy-’n’-hold
strategy that should work well. For those seeking more growth (along with
more risk) then consider paper investments such as mining stocks. The fol-
lowing sections give you some pointers for both.
Physical silver
Silver experts Ted Butler and Jason Hommel are staunch proponents of buying
and holding physical silver. They enumerate the benefits in their respective
Web sites. The easiest way to get into silver is through bullion silver coins such
as the U.S. silver eagle. It is produced by the U.S. Mint (www.usmint.gov), and
it’s readily available either directly or through coin shops and dealers.
The benefit of buying bullion is that the price you pay primarily covers the
silver content. A silver eagle, as you shop around, could be bought for what-
ever is the spot price of silver plus a premium of 5% to 12% to cover produc-
tion and marketing costs. Therefore, if the spot price of silver is $10, you
could find the cost for a silver eagle to vary from $10.50 to $11.20. Be careful
as there are dealers that have higher premiums, so do shop around.
83
Chapter 6: Discovering the Secret of Silver

There are silver commemoratives, medallions, ingots, and other collectibles
available, but you’ll find that the price of what you are buying will cost far
more than the silver content. You may not even get as much silver as you
think. The standard is .999 fine silver so find out as quality can vary.
Another area is numismatic coins but that is a different animal altogether.
Numismatics (or collectible coins) are covered in Chapter 11.
Keep in mind that another benefit of buying bullion coins such as silver eagles
is that you can easily sell them as it’s a large and liquid market. Collectibles
and numismatic coins require more diligence, effort, and expertise in both
buying and selling them.
Paper silver
You can invest in silver without actually holding or storing the physical silver.
Many people buy silver through things such as silver certificates or through
brokers and dealers that store it for you and provide proof of ownership such
as through a warehouse receipt. There are some pitfalls so you would need to
choose reputable dealers that document the existence of the silver it holds
on your behalf. It was a common problem where people bought silver (or so
they thought) only to find out that they paid good money for a piece of paper
that was not backed up by actual physical silver allegedly held by the vendor.
Another way to invest in silver is through buying common stock of silver-
mining companies. There are a few large silver-mining companies and several
dozen smaller companies. To invest in them it requires not only some due
diligence in understanding the silver market but also about public companies
in general. You need to know how they make money and what their financials
tell you. In addition you need to know what the pitfalls are. Mining stocks are
covered in Chapter 12, and there are companies that can be good choices for
either conservative or aggressive investors.
A safer way to invest in mining stocks (especially for beginning or novice
investors) is through mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and
Chapter 13 gives you more guidance. You will find very few (if any) mutual
funds that are purely into silver-mining stocks, but there are many precious
metals funds that have silver mining stocks as part of their portfolio.
Lastly, I can mention the most aggressive and/or speculative way to be in
paper silver vehicles and that would be futures and options. This requires
much more due diligence and a greater tolerance to risk. Fortunately, books
like this will help (you’re welcome!). Futures are covered in Chapter 14 and
options are covered in Chapter 15. Between the two, my personal preference
for speculating is options since I can still get “the bang for my buck” similar
to futures but I can limit my risk.
84
Part II: Mining the Landscape of Metals

Silver’s Compelling Future
According to the CPM group’s 2003 silver survey, there are approximately 400
million ounces of silver bullion and 2 billion ounces of gold bullion available.
Before moving on, it is important to qualify this fact. First, this comparison is
between gold bullion and silver bullion. In both cases, I am not talking about
jewelry or art forms of the metals. However, to clarify the point, if silver
coinage was added to the silver bullion, the total would still be approximately
one billion ounces. This is less than one-third of the gold supply, if we count
both gold coin and gold bullion. Since then, the supply of gold has increased
and the supply of silver has decreased. The following sections give you an
idea of what factors into silver’s compelling future.
Market fundamentals
There was a time when silver was plentiful. At one time the U.S. government
had over two billion ounces of silver stockpiled during the 20th century, but
as of 2003 it has no more. As we consume more silver than we produce, a
major drawdown of supplies begins to occur. You begin to see how rare silver
is when you compare it to gold. Virtually all the gold that has been mined is
still around in some form. You can find large supplies held by central banks,
and gold ownership (through coins and jewelry) is at an all-time high. Silver,
though, is a different story.
The demand side
One of the most incredible things regarding silver is that demand for it has
outstripped supply for 15 straight years. This trend is projected to continue
for at least the next several years. Annual silver supply deficits have run as
high as 200 million ounces in boom years, and as low as 70 million ounces in
years of recession. It is important to realize that even in years of decreased
silver demand, the mining supply on an annual basis did not meet demand.
There is nothing more bullish for a commodity than such a deficit condition,
a condition where demand is greater than available supply.
The supply side
Because the vast majority of silver is mined as a byproduct of mining lead,
zinc, copper and gold, the price of silver can be sensitive to the amount pro-
duced as a byproduct. This, however, is a condition that has a flipside. Since
85
Chapter 6: Discovering the Secret of Silver

the total amount of silver produced by mining has fallen short of total demand
and the price of silver has started to climb, there is little incentive for base
metal miners to rev up their production because the silver produced is not
instrumental to their business. The ongoing commodity boom will continue,
and base metal production will increase in the future, but it is highly doubtful
that the increase will keep pace with the increasing demand for silver for
many years.
The world needs more silver
All too often, we think in terms of America and what we produce and consume.
In today’s economy, we’re no longer the 800-pound gorilla. While America is
slowing down, the rest of the world is speeding up. Precious metals (and com-
modities in general) could easily have a long-term bull market with just two
reasons: China and India (and the rest of Asia).
Asia will be a tremendous factor for two reasons. First — industrial demand —
Asia’s growth and accelerating industrialization mean it will need more natural
resources. Remember that precious metals are finite natural resources.
Secondly, China and India have always embraced gold and silver in their 
cultural and social circles. There is natural demand that will only increase as
their respective nations become more affluent. More details about the interna-
tional demand for precious metals are in Chapter 18.
The Legends of Silver
Every market has those trailblazers that stay on the cutting edge of market
movements. The stock market had Benjamin Graham and Warren Buffet. The
mutual fund industry had Peter Lynch and John Bogle. If you had followed
their research, you would have very done well in those markets. The precious
metals market is no different. The following sections profile the trailblazers in
silver.
Jerome Smith
One of the first legendary “silver bulls” was Jerome Smith. In 1972 his book
Silver Profits in the Seventies accurately detailed the bull market for silver
during the high-flying ’70s. At the time, he was also very accurate about the
rise in gold and other precious metals. His writings influenced the Hunt
brothers in their infamous attempt at cornering the silver market.
86
Part II: Mining the Landscape of Metals

Smith expected silver to explode during the 1980s but was way off the mark.
The reasons he cited are probably more appropriate now, a quarter-century
later, since he did not foresee how much silver would enter the marketplace
from government sources that depressed the price. He also didn’t foresee the
extent that large financial firms in the silver market would be active in forcing
the price of silver down (referred to as shorting the market). Fortunately, his
work influenced others to continue tracking the silver market and its great
potential today.
Ted Butler and the silver shortage
In recent years, landmark studies and research into the silver market was
undertaken by silver analyst Ted Butler (www.butlerresearch.com). He
has been one of the very few analysts to track and research the silver market
on a full-time basis. Although he usually doesn’t issue specific forecasts and
recommendations, he was correct on a consistent basis on warnings about
problems with silver and other metals. He warned about practices such as
forward selling, naked short selling, and metals leasing. In recent years, he
has warned investors and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission
(CFTC) about a huge and untenable short position in silver at the New York
Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX).
Butler is on record that silver has the long-term realistic potential of going
into three figures ($100 or more). He also embraces Jerome Smith’s forecasts
that silver has an outside chance of becoming more valuable than gold when
the world marketplace realizes that silver is actually more rare than gold. Ted
Butler cites the following points as the fundamental reasons to be bullish on
silver long term:
 The huge supply and demand imbalance: As new industrial applications
need silver and as the rest of the world continues modernizing and grow-
ing (again, places like China and India), demand will outpace (and is
already outpacing) new silver being mined. Long-term, a very bullish
condition.
 The huge short position in silver: In the futures market, you can go long
in silver (buying a contract) or you can go short (selling a contract) as a
market strategy. Going short in silver means that you borrow silver (in
this case a futures contract) and sell it immediately, and if the price of
silver goes down, you can buy back the silver at a profit. The key point
to remember is that going short involves a liability: If you borrow, then
you must return or pay back. If you go short, say, 100 silver futures con-
tracts, then ultimately you need to buy back those 100 contracts to com-
plete your transaction (covering your short position). Don’t worry if you
87
Chapter 6: Discovering the Secret of Silver

don’t get it immediately — I explain it further in Chapter 14. The bottom
line is that Butler warns that there is a huge short position in silver that
exceeds the known inventory of silver available — a very unusual situa-
tion that could prove to be explosive for the price of silver in due course.
In early May 2007, records showed a short position at NYMEX of over
508 million ounces of silver while total silver on hand at NYMEX-approved
storage facilities was about 132 million ounces. In other words, there’s
not enough silver to cover potential purchases of silver. When a forced
purchase in a shorting situation occurs, this is called a short squeeze.
Long term, this is a very bullish condition.
 Unbacked silver bank certificates: Over a period of decades, approxi-
mately one billion silver bank certificates were sold with the provision
that they can be converted to physical silver. However, there aren’t a 
billion ounces available to back up these certificates. In due course, as
some certificates begin to be converted, what happens when the point is
reached and no silver is readily available? The signal to the marketplace
is that there is a silver shortage and . . . yes . . . this would be yet another
reason that silver would increase in price.
The above major points come from Ted Butler’s research and from publicly
available data. Butler makes additional points about the bullish case for
silver but you get the picture.
David Morgan
For years David Morgan of www.silver-investor.com tracked the silver
market and offered cutting-edge research on silver and especially silver mining
companies. His book Get the Skinny on Silver (www.gettheskinnyon
silver.com) quickly became a key reference source especially for beginners.
Although Morgan made a number of accurate short-term forecasts for silver,
his research indicates that long-term silver is heading for an all-time high
price since the supply-and-demand fundamentals are so strong. After survey-
ing the industry, Morgan notes that silver supplies are at historically low levels
to the point that if any large investor or industrial firm wanted a significant
supply of silver that it could trigger a buying panic causing the price of silver
to spike (move upward very quickly). Figure 6-1 illustrates the latest supply
and demand data for silver.

Chapter 7
Platinum and Palladium
In This Chapter
 What the platinum group metals are
 The ways you can invest and speculate in them
 Resources to help you choose
P
latinum and palladium (and four other metals) are part of what is called
the platinum metals group. Before you think it’s a new rock group, think
again (well, now that I think about, it really is a rock group). The six metals
that are in this group are elements that are found together in the table of ele-
ments and as metals have much in common. I’ll get to the six metals later in
this chapter. Because platinum is the most significant metal of the group, it
became the nominal leader of the pack. Platinum and palladium are the most
common metals in this group for investors, traders, and speculators.
Naturally occurring platinum and platinum-rich alloys have been known for a
long time. Centuries ago, Spanish explorers came across the metal and named
it platina or “little silver” when they first discovered it in South America. They
initially didn’t want platinum because they regarded it as an impurity in the
more desirable silver they were mining. Oh, man . . . if they only knew! As I
write this chapter, I just checked the price; platinum (at $1,270 an ounce) is
about 100 times pricier than silver. I could certainly tolerate that kind of four-
figure impurity in my portfolio.
In this chapter, I explore how this rock group can help you diversify your
portfolio, much like other precious metals, such as gold and silver.
The Platinum Group Metals
The platinum group metals include platinum, palladium, rhodium, osmium,
ruthenium, and iridium. We need ’em, we use ’em, so we might as well invest
in ’em. Okay, so let’s see ’em. Drum roll please . . . 

Platinum
Platinum is the principal and most well-known metal of the group. It is gener-
ally used in jewelry and in industry. The largest single demand for platinum is
in jewelry, which accounts for 51% of the demand. The second largest use is
in the automotive field (29%) for components such as catalytic converters
and related parts. Lastly, the remaining demand is used in a small variety of
other uses. Among them: electronics, chemical and petroleum refining cata-
lysts, and collectibles such as bullion coins.
Platinum is an excellent conductor of electricity and does not corrode. It is
among the world’s scarcest metals where new mine production amounts to
approximately 5 million (troy) ounces a year. To put that relatively small
figure into perspective, gold production is in the general neighborhood of
80-85 million ounces per year. Platinum is mainly found in places like South
Africa, Russia and North America. In fact, South Africa accounts for about
80% of the world’s supply.
Because of platinum’s limited supply and the world’s continuous demand for
it, investment interest should keep growing as well. In case you were wonder-
ing, the platinum credit cards that have been so popular lately don’t have any
platinum.
Palladium
Number two on the list is palladium but it keeps trying harder. Palladium has
become more established in recent years as a useful industrial material as
well as a very tradeable metal on the world market. In industry, it is used in
diverse areas such as automotive, electronics, oil refining, dentistry, chemi-
cal, medicine, fuel cells, hydrogen purification, water treatment, and more.
Consumers are buying more palladium jewelry and coinage.
And you thought that it was just a name for a popular dance club!
Rhodium
Rhodium was discovered by the English chemist William Hyde Wollaston in
1803. That was a hot year for him since he also discovered palladium (alas,
since he didn’t discover the “futures market,” he couldn’t discover some real
money either). Rhodium tends to occur along with deposits of platinum and
is primarily obtained as a byproduct of mining and refining platinum. (Rhodium
was also discovered as a byproduct in nickel in Canada.) The leading source
of rhodium is South Africa with 60% of the known supply (Russia is second).
It is rare; only about 7 to 8 tons hit the market every year.
92
Part II: Mining the Landscape of Metals

Rhodium is used to make electrical contacts, as jewelry, and in catalytic con-
verters, but is most frequently used in tandem (as an alloy) with other mate-
rials like . . . you guessed it . . . platinum and palladium. These alloys, in turn,
are used in industry such as aerospace and manufacturing.
For me, the most eye-popping point about rhodium is its price tag: over $6,000
an ounce as of September 2007. (It could have been had for only $380 an ounce
in 2002.) When she asks, I’ll tell my wife to put a little rhodium in my Christmas
stocking.
Osmium
Osmium. Yep. It’s real stuff. I’m trying hard to write something clever about it
but to no avail. Anyway, it’s a lustrous, bluish white metal that is extremely
hard and it has the highest melting point and the lowest vapor pressure of
the platinum group (tell everyone at your next cocktail party).
Osmium is used to produce very hard alloys with other metals of the platinum
group so that it can be used in a variety of products ranging from fountain
pen tips to pacemakers and medical instrumentation replacement valves.
Iridium
Ya see, when you do a book like this, you have to occasionally scrape the
bottom of the barrel. You get to write (if only briefly) about things that 
sound like they came out of an old episode of Star Trek (Captain Kirrrrk! We
got no powerrrr. We need more iridium crystals . . . and a better script!)
Iridium is found with platinum and other platinum group metals in alluvial
deposits. Iridium is the most corrosion-resistant metal known. It is used in
medical instrumentation, electrical contacts, and as a hardening agent for
other metals.
Ruthenium
Ruthenium is also found with the other platinum group metals found in loca-
tions such as the Ural Mountains and in North and South America. It is used
as a hardening agent for platinum and palladium. When it is alloyed with these
metals it is then used to make electrical contacts for severe wear resistance.
Ruthenium, when added to titanium, makes its corrosion resistance 100 times
better. You go, Ruth!
I’ve been told that when you combine osmium, iridium and ruthenium as an
alloy to cement you get . . . stadium. I could be wrong . . .
93
Chapter 7: Platinum and Palladium

The investor’s best choices in the group
Let’s face it; at this point in time it is not practical for folks to get involved in
osmium, iridium, ruthenium, and the expensive kid on the block, rhodium.
There are probably some publicly traded companies that deal with them but
the real action and investment activity are with the Lennon and McCartney of
the group, platinum and palladium. These two have much profit potential to
offer investors as well as more different vehicles.
Platinum’s performance
This metal has lots of style and grace but more importantly, it packs a nice
investment punch. Figure 7-1 gives you a snapshot of what it has done
recently . . . 
Platinum may be attractive as jewelry but it’s downright gorgeous as an
investor’s price chart. As you can see, platinum had a nice, steady up-move
during the five years ending September 2007. The metal was under $500
during 2002 and it hit $1,270 for a total percentage gain of well over 150%.
During the spring 2006 rally, it did trade as high as $1,355.
As investment vehicles, platinum (as well as palladium) has the same dual
qualities (investment demand and industrial demand) as silver. However, 
the composition is a little different.
It can be argued that silver’s investment and industrial demands are roughly
equal while platinum and palladium have much more industrial demand than
investment demand. Therefore, platinum and palladium (and the other 
metals in this group) are much more correlated with economic growth. In 
this respect, the platinum group metals more closely approximate the move-
ment of base metals.

Part II: Mining the Landscape of Metals

In the “big picture,” however, the platinum group metals should continue to
flourish in the current investment climate. As supply and demand factors and
inflationary pressures continue, investment and industrial demand will con-
tinue to enhance potential returns for platinum group metals investors and
speculators.
Palladium’s performance
Of all the major tradeable and investable metals, palladium had the greatest
swings in the course of its past five years of market action. Just look at the
chart in Figure 7-2.
As the chart shows, palladium has been a great trading vehicle since there
was such a roller-coaster ride for its price. For those who don’t mind the
short-term volatility, palladium would have been an ideal vehicle for those
who like to employ option strategies such as a straddle. A straddle is basically
two bets that you make simultaneously on the same asset: one bet that it is
going down and the second that it is going up. This is done by buying both a
call option and a put option at the same time on the same asset (see Chapter
15 for more details on the straddle). When palladium shot up, you could have
cashed in the call at a nice profit. Then later on as palladium plummeted, you
could have made another profit by cashing out the put option.
For long-term investors, you would have thought that nothing happened with
the metal at all. Palladium in September 2002 was in the mid $300s range, and
by September 2007 it still ended up in the mid $300s range. Oh well. You can’t
always have a runaway success. Fortunately, the mining stocks involved in
platinum and palladium did manage to beat the stock market averages.
Platinum Group Investment Vehicles
Moving forward, the next issue is if you are going to get involved with plat-
inum and palladium, how can you proceed? The following sections discuss
the several ways you can get involved with these metals.

Chapter 7: Platinum and Palladium

Bullion
Buying platinum and/or palladium through bullion coins and/or bars is the
safest way to do it, and it is appropriate if you are taking a long-term approach.
Which you buy will be based on your budget and personal tastes. Obviously,
platinum is much more expensive than palladium at this time so that will be 
a factor.
Fortunately, those who want platinum bullion do not have to buy a full ounce
given the four-figure price tag. There are dealers that make platinum available
in smaller sizes (such as a half-ounce and quarter-ounce). For more details on
buying bullion, check out Chapter 10.
Futures
Platinum and palladium are widely traded in the futures market. You can spec-
ulate with futures contracts directly or (my preference) buy options on those
futures contracts. The most suitable place to trade futures in the United States
is the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX). You can get full details about
NYMEX and platinum/palladium futures at www.nymex.com. You find out
more about futures in Chapter 14.
Platinum futures
A platinum futures contract is based on 50 troy ounces of platinum (trading
symbol: PL). Therefore, at a per-ounce price of $1,270 times 50 ounces, that
means a platinum futures contract would be valued at $63,500. A very hefty
price indeed. When you trade futures contract (such as platinum), you don’t
have to have the full amount in your account; you can put a portion of the
amount in your futures account (margin). How much? As an example, if you
opened an account as of September 5, 200,7 and you wanted to trade one
platinum futures contract, you’d have to put in a minimum of $2,700 (as a
non-member customer).
With futures, you have the power (and potential problem) of leverage. If plat-
inum goes up $50, then the futures contract’s value would increase to $66,000
(50 ounces times the new price of $1,320 per ounce) and you could have a
potential gain of $2,500. Since the margin in this case was $2,700, you would
nearly double your money. But what if platinum goes down?
Keep in mind that if platinum goes down in price you may have to put more
margin in your account. You would get the dreaded margin call from the broker
to contribute either more money or marginable assets into the account. The
volatility and risk make futures financially dangerous for those who are not
experienced and with limited funds.
96
Part II: Mining the Landscape of Metals

Palladium futures
A palladium futures contract is based on 100 troy ounces of palladium (trad-
ing symbol: PA). If palladium is at $350 per ounce, then the futures contract
would be worth $35,000. This is certainly cheaper than the platinum futures
contract but not exactly chicken feed. The same basic rules and risks would
apply. Again, check out Chapter 14 regarding more details about the risks and
opportunities in futures.
Both platinum and palladium futures (along with futures in general) are appro-
priate for investors and speculators who understand the risks and rewards of
this fast-moving market. It is generally not appropriate for conservative or risk-
adverse investors and it sure isn’t a good place for your savings, your rent
money, your nest egg, or what is in your kid’s piggybank.
Final points
As a last reminder, options on these same futures contracts are a very active
market and done at the same exchange (www.nymex.com). At this point, there
are not “Mini” futures contracts on platinum or palladium but stay tuned.
New derivatives are regularly issued and I am not surprised anymore. After
all, if someone told me that after the brutal hurricane season of 2005 that we
would have “hurricane futures,” I would have called them crazy. But lo and
behold we have hurricane futures. (Don’t believe it? Check it out at the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange’s Web site www.cme.com!) What next? How about
Election Season futures? Hmmmm . . . more wind.
Stock Investments
For investors, this is a more appropriate venue. There are mining stocks that
are in the platinum group metals. Some examples of mining stocks are North
American Palladium (symbol: PAL), Anglo American Platinum (symbol:
AAUKD), and Impala Platinum (symbol: IMPUY). I list these only as examples
so please don’t take them as recommendations (confer with your stock advi-
sor on whether they are appropriate for you).
It is important to point out that stocks, especially mining stocks, tend to be a
“derivative” of the underlying asset. It is common to talk about an option being
a derivative since an option “derives” its value from the underlying assets.
The same point is generally true for futures contracts since futures (like
options) are basically pieces of paper that have no intrinsic value; they are
claims to things that do have value and certainly have value in the market-
place. Stocks can have the same quality. In addition, another trait that stocks
have with futures and options is a certain measure of leverage, albeit to a 
different degree. Here’s an example.
97
Chapter 7: Platinum and Palladium

If I own platinum bullion and the price of platinum goes up 10%, then my bul-
lion will go up a corresponding amount. But, all things being equal, a platinum
mining stock will probably go up more than 10% (20% or 30% or more). Why?
That type of mining stock (along with most mining stocks) probably has
plenty of platinum on its property.
There is a very rough rule of thumb that says that a generic mining stock will
have a 3-to-1 correlation in price movement compared to the underlying metal.
In other words, if platinum goes up 10% then the stock of a strictly platinum-
mining company would most likely go up three times as high (or more)
because of the amount of platinum it has in the ground. It may have thou-
sands or even millions of ounces but the important point is that a mining
stock can be a leveraged play on that particular metal.
Keep in mind that few mining stocks are a “pure play” on a single metal. In
most cases, the mining process can usually unearth many metals and miner-
als that can be clustered together in the same location. This is especially true
with the platinum group metals. For more information on mining stocks, go to
Chapter 12.
Mutual Funds and ETFs
There are very few mutual funds that exclusively get in investments (typically
stocks) that mine the platinum group metals. The reason is that mining stocks
in this singular area is a relatively small area of what is really a relatively small
industry. As of the summer of 2007, the value of all the mining stocks in the
U.S. stock market combined is still less than the market value of a single
mega-cap stock (like Exxon Mobil or Microsoft).
Like base metals, they tend to be lumped in a mutual fund broadly referred to
as “metals and mining,” “basic materials,” “raw materials,” or even “natural
resources.” It is still worthwhile to do some research since it is not that diffi-
cult to find mutual funds with mining stocks. For more assistance on locating
mutual funds with platinum group metals, check out the resources listed in
Chapter 13 on mutual funds.
As of August 2007, there are no exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that are a pure
play on platinum directly or the group in general. There has been ongoing
chatter in the marketplace for a platinum ETF due to the metal’s increasing
price rise and popularity so it is possible that one could come out in the near
future. Keep an eye on where ETFs typically emerge, the American Stock
Exchange (www.amex.com).

in general but offer plenty of research on individual metals.

Uranium
In This Chapter
 Checking out uranium’s profit potential
 Understanding how to invest in uranium
 Finding resources to help you with uranium
I
’ll try to keep the comments about “glowing returns” and a “radio-active
future” to a minimum. But really, I think that uranium deserves considera-
tion for any portfolio because it will be (and already is) a major player in the
energy sector.
Maybe the first question you will ask is, “Uranium? Does it really belong in a
book on precious metals?” The answer is a resounding “Why not?” It is indeed
metallic, it does need to be mined, and it is indeed very precious. In the big
picture, uranium is (and will be) playing an important role in the world as we
enter the “twilight” period in our historic usage of oil (more about oil later in
this chapter). Why address oil in a chapter on uranium? Uranium’s future 
is tied to the prospects of oil in a big way.
Uranium is the primary element needed in nuclear power. Because there are
different grades of uranium, you will hear a reference to “U3O8” yellowcake
uranium. This reference is actually to the element symbol for uranium oxide
concentrate. This is the primary grade used by industry and by all means
don’t confuse “yellowcake” uranium with any other cake.
In this chapter, I give you all the info you need to make smart decisions regard-
ing investments in uranium so you can have your (yellow)cake and eat it, too.

Controversial Past, Bright Future
If any metal qualifies as going from an old beast to a new beauty, then ura-
nium fits the bill. It was vilified stuff in the anti-nuclear protest days of the
1970s and 1980s. Yet in recent years environmental activists embraced
nuclear power. Talk about a turnaround! Why this change of heart? It hap-
pened due to two major developments:
 Nuclear power is safer than it used to be. New technology coupled with
better, safer, and more efficient ways to manage nuclear power and
nuclear waste byproducts has made it a friendlier energy source.
 The global warming controversy. Public debate stirred up concerns
over “greenhouse gases” and emissions from oil and coal based energy
usage. Although there is considerable debate on the topic, that hasn’t
stopped political, business, and social movement towards energy usage
that didn’t impact the earth’s climate. Nuclear power fits the bill nicely
since nuclear power plants have no carbon emissions.
The uranium market
In terms of usage, uranium does have a “Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde” quality about
it. Uranium has both peaceful uses (energy and industrial applications) and
maybe-not-so-peaceful uses (military applications).
Uranium’s primary use in industry is as the fuel in nuclear power reactors to
generate electricity. A secondary use is in the manufacturing of radio isotopes
in medical applications. Uranium helps to provide about 16% of the world’s
electricity. As of the summer of 2007, there are 443 active commercial nuclear
power plants operating in 30 countries across the globe providing 370
gigawatts of electricity. Anywhere from 50 to 200 new nuclear power plants
are in some stage of planning worldwide during the next 10 to 15 years.
Demand and usage from individual countries are very diverse. France doesn’t
have much in the way of uranium but it imports much since 70% if its energy
needs is provided by nuclear power. Australia, on the other hand, doesn’t use
very much uranium so it is a major exporter of uranium. China has a vora-
cious need for energy for its growing economy so it’s planning to significantly
expand its nuclear power (adding 30 to 40 power plants during the next five
to ten years). How about us?
As of 2006, the United States derives about 19 percent of its total electricity
from 66 nuclear power plants. There hasn’t been a new nuclear power built
since the late 1970s although that may change due to the new realities for 
our economy, such as peak oil.

Uranium supply
Part of the bullish picture for uranium is the limited supply of it. However, the
supply is more limited than you think.
Uranium is found in areas that are often geologically fragile. This means that
problems may occur when companies attempt to extract it. Although prob-
lems with mines are present in all types of mining, uranium mining is espe-
cially delicate. Two recent major mining problems illustrate this.
In September 2006, flooding occurred at the Cigar Lake mine due to geologi-
cal instability. The mine is owned and managed by the large mining company
Cameco (listed in the New York Stock Exchange with the symbol CCJ). This
was a very significant event for the uranium industry since the flood shut
down production of a mine that geologists report has the world’s largest
deposit of undeveloped commercial-grade uranium. This mine was scheduled
to reach production level by 2008 but now it may take much longer. Although
the company is progressing with efforts to remedy the project, the earliest
that production can begin is 2010 or 2011. Since Cigar Lake had estimated
reserves of over 226 million pounds of U3O8 grade uranium, this is a major
setback for available, worldwide supply.
If that wasn’t bad enough, then there is another problem in Australia; the
Ranger mine incident. Tropical Cyclone George flooded the Ranger mine,
which was already a producing property. The drop in production was esti-
mated at about 4 million pounds. It is likely that other problems with uranium
mines may surface. All this adds up to a big negative on the supply side of the
uranium market. How about demand?
Uranium demand
Because of the world’s voracious need for energy, this bodes well for uranium.
China, Russia, India, Japan, South Korea, and even the United States have
major plans to build more nuclear power plants. Just China and Russia will
add 80 to 100 nuclear power plants by the end of the next decade. Until ura-
nium production catches up, this burgeoning demand will be met by a combi-
nation of current production and what is available in stock piles. The stock
piles include uranium being recovered and re-used from sources such as mis-
sile warheads formerly used by the old Soviet Union.
When you combine limited or shrinking supply with strong and growing
demand, you have an investment winner. Uranium radiates long-term success!
103
Chapter 8: Uranium

Uranium’s market performance
The price of uranium experienced a strong bull market in the late 1970s before
disenchantment with it sent the price plummeting in the early 1980s. Uranium
(U3O8 grade) witnessed its spot price rise from under $7 a pound in 1972 to
just over $40 by 1979. Keep in mind that the demand for uranium was not just
because of the energy situation; it was also due to the military buildup of
nuclear forces by the United States and the old U.S.S.R.
By 1980, uranium started on a long, steady decline before it hit rock bottom
in 2000 (back below $7 a pound). This bear market lasted two decades until
world demand caught up and surpassed world supply. So as with most com-
modities in this decade, it turned around in 2000 and started an impressive
and uninterrupted climb to $138 a pound by the spring of 2007. During the
summer of 2007 it experienced a sizable correction and retreated to the $90
level by early September 2007 (see Figure 8-1).
Some of the major reasons for uranium’s price rise during 2000-2007 are the
reduction in above-ground supplies available, the increased costs of oil, and
the outlook for greater demand. The correction in the summer of 2007
occurred as the market perceived reduced demand for energy due to a slow-
ing U.S. economy and seasonal weakness. (Summer time is usually a slow or
weak time for commodities in general.) Even the hottest market can have
pull-backs in the price which is actually normal and necessary for a long-term
bull market.
A major factor going for uranium is the imbalance in supply and demand. Much
of the demand is due to the rising price of oil. However, demand can grow
faster than supply because it takes a long time to find and mine new sources
of uranium. A uranium company has to jump through many hoops (permits,
regulations, political barriers, and so on.) over a period of years before it can
stick the first shovel in the ground. This is an important fact for nimble
investors and speculators.

Part II: Mining the Landscape of Metals

That ’70s metal
With the looming energy crisis of the early 1970s upon us, America sought
alternatives. Because the United States hit “peak oil” circa 1971, the need 
for alternative energy became apparent. More about peak oil in the next sec-
tion. Anyway, the energy crisis of the 1970s was a primary catalyst for oil-
consuming countries such as the United States to diversify into other energy
sources. This in turn helped to create a boom for nuclear power during the
late 1970s. However, it was not without controversy. The potential hazards of
nuclear power, both real and perceived, dogged it into a national controversy.
Moves like “China Syndrome” and incidents such as the 1979 accident at the
Three Mile Island nuclear power plant near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, turned
public (and hence political) opinion against nuclear power.
Peak oil and uranium
I use an example in the gold chapter about umbrellas and rain. I compare
gold to an umbrella and monetary inflation to rain. When you see the prob-
lem of rain (monetary inflation), you can see the solution of an umbrella
(gold). The same umbrella-and-rain example fits with uranium and . . . peak
oil. I mention it earlier, but it is something that you should be aware of.
Peak oil is a condition first covered in landmark research done by the geolo-
gist Marion King Hubbard in the early 1960s. Peak oil refers to the lifespan of
a pool of oil found in the ground. The first 50% of its life, the oil comes gush-
ing out easily. The second 50% is more difficult and expensive to extract.
Peak oil doesn’t necessarily mean we are running out of oil; it means that we
are running out of cheap oil. This condition will have a profound effect on our
economy and lifestyle. In 2007, the 20 largest oil fields in the world are declin-
ing in production and in the coming years we will need to find new sources of
energy. (Got uranium?)
To find out more about peak oil, you can go to the Association for the Study
of Peak Oil and gas (www.aspo.net) and there are more links to resources
on peak oil through the Web sites below. An excellent book on the topic is
Twilight in the Desert by Matthew Simmons (published by Wiley). Consider
peak oil as a “must” topic in your research.

Chapter 8: Uranium

Uranium Investing Vehicles
First let me say right up front that you shouldn’t have uranium in any physi-
cal form (not suitable for kids, seniors, or as gift items)! Did I really need to
say that? Considering how hare-brained things are these days, why not? There
are bottles of sleeping pills that have a notice on them that says “Warning! The
contents may cause drowsiness.” Huh? Great . . . just as I was about to oper-
ate heavy machinery! Anyway, I can look like a consumer hero and tell you to
stay away from uranium in all its physical forms. But embrace it as an invest-
ing opportunity. The following sections give you some of the ways that you
can power up your portfolio returns with uranium.
Futures
Uranium in the form of a futures contract is a very new animal. Uranium
started trading in the futures market on the New York Mercantile Exchange
(NYMEX) in May 2007 with the symbol “UX.” The futures contract is attached
to 250 lbs. of U3O8 grade uranium and it is traded “cash only.” In other words,
all trades are settled in cash; there is no delivery of actual uranium allowed
(whew!). Actually, if anyone was looking for physical delivery we can only
hope that the exchange lets those national security folks know about it.
Because uranium futures are relatively new, the market does not (yet) have
options on futures but there’s no reason why that can’t change in the near
future. As the market heats up (pardon the pun), more activity and excite-
ment will result in more ways to play uranium.
Mining stocks
Generally the same issues with mining stocks apply to uranium stocks so
Chapter 12 is important to read. Uranium stocks have the same issues of
volatility as the regular metals mining stocks. However, there are different
factors affecting uranium stocks.
If you recall from prior chapters, inflation is a major driving force for precious
metals such as gold and silver, and therefore it has a major influence on gold
and silver mining stocks. For uranium stocks, the more direct influence is, in
a word, “oil.” In other words, the world’s consumption and demand for energy
(oil and otherwise) is the primary driver for uranium stocks. As the price of
oil in this decade soared from under $10 a barrel to well over $70, uranium
also went higher and more steeply; it went from under $7 a pound to over $90
in the same period. How did uranium stocks perform?
106
Part II: Mining the Landscape of Metals

As you can guess, uranium stocks went up dramatically and beat the pants
off the general stock market. Both classes of uranium stocks, the major pro-
ducers and the junior explorers, did exceptionally well. Take Cameco, for
example. It went from under $2 per share in 2000 to over $40 in 2007. (That
does not include two stock splits during that time, which means you did even
better.) Some of the junior uranium stocks did even better.
We can see the rewards with uranium stocks but the risks do come along as
well. A well-selected uranium stock has powerful profit potential in this envi-
ronment but keep in mind the potential problems. In addition to having the
usual challenges by mining firms (regulations, political risks, and so on) there
are the geological risks as well. Remember Cameco’s Cigar Lake problem.
When this incident hit the news, Cameco’s stock fell from about $39 to $31 in
about four weeks. Fortunately, it is a well-financed company that was able to
get through this setback, but what if it were a junior exploration firm? It would
have gone into bankruptcy and the share price would have been vaporized.
The bottom line is that the larger uranium stocks are suitable for long-term,
growth-oriented investors. The junior mining stocks are more speculative so
they are more suitable for aggressive investors. For more research into ura-
nium stocks, see the resources at the end of this chapter.
Uranium exchange-traded funds
For investors, investing in uranium through ETFs is the safest way to go.
Although there are currently only two choices, these are in fact great choices.
Uranium ETFs remove the risk of holding only one company. There is risk
with uranium ETFs but the risk is related to the overall industry. If the indus-
try goes down (meaning market value), then the ETF will go down; if the
industry prospers and prices go up, the ETF will rise in value as well. Since
uranium is a worldwide market and its prospects look good for the next few
years, uranium ETFs are a solid way to play this market.
Uranium Participation Corporation
The Uranium Participation Corporation is listed on the Toronto Stock
Exchange (www.tsx.com) with the symbol “U” and it’s been around since
2005. Fortunately for U.S. investors, the security is also listed on Nasdaq’s
Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board (www.otcbb.com) with the symbol URPTF.
URPTF is managed by Denison Mines and it is a way for investors to easily
participate in uranium without having to buy stock in a particular company.
The security mirrors the market price of uranium directly. Technically, it is
not an ETF but it has enough of the characteristics to effectively be one.
107
Chapter 8: Uranium

As an over-the-counter security, there are no options on it and you can not buy
it on margin in the U.S. Consider it an aggressive choice for your portfolio.
The Market Vectors Nuclear ETF
The Market Vectors Nuclear Energy ETF (symbol: NLR) is an ETF issued by Van
Eck Global. It mirrors a nuclear energy index called the DAX Global Nuclear
Energy Index (DXNE). The DXNE is an index that tracks large uranium mining
companies (and large firms related to uranium such as processing, services,
and so on). Currently, they track 38 companies engaged in the nuclear energy
industry and that are traded on leading global stock exchanges.
For long-term investors, this is a solid way to invest in the uranium market.
You get the safety of diversification (as if it were a mutual fund) and the 
convenience of an ETF. More details on ETFs are in Chapter 13.
Other choices
As I write this book, more choices are jumping on the bandwagon. Premiering
on the Toronto Stock Exchange is the Uranium Focused Energy Fund, which
invests in securities of issuers that operate in or have exposure to the ura-
nium sector (symbol: UF.UN on the Toronto Stock Exchange). As the uranium
market heats up (sorry about that), you can expect more choices for
investors and speculators.
Options
Of course, those who want to get aggressive and “push the envelope” for more
speculative gains, options are the way to go. Right now, the most active options
areas for uranium are options on the larger uranium companies. As of the
date of this book, there are no options on uranium futures or on uranium
ETFs but I expect that to change. More “options on options” are probably on
the way.
Fortunately, there are many choices on options with the major uranium com-
panies and as of September 2007, there are options with expiration dates
going out to 2010. Another point to keep in mind is that many smaller ura-
nium stocks do have warrants which are very similar to options and also
have expiration dates that go out two years or longer.
For options, do your research by getting the stock symbols for the major firms
and find out if there are options available at the Chicago Board Options
Exchange (www.cboe.com). For warrant information, check with the individ-
ual companies. Use the resources in the next section to find companies and
more information. Happy digging!

O
kay. Admit it. As soon as you got this book you immediately flipped to
this chapter. Didn’t you? After all, who wouldn’t want to read about
copper and nickel? Well, the chapter is a reality and now you don’t have to
wait for the movie! But just in case you count base metals instead of sheep at
night to get to sleep, I’ll keep the technical stuff to a minimum. You can thank
me later.
Anyway, base metals can be exciting as a speculative and investment vehicle
because they’re indeed the building blocks of civilization. Putting your money
into base metals investments is a bet on society at large and its continual
advancement. Whatever of substance is to be created — cars, computers,
buildings, highways, and so forth — needs base metals.
Now, to add some interest in this chapter (as if I needed to with this scintil-
lant topic), I will quiz you with the following question: What base metal was
used the most by the Swiss navy? The answer appears somewhere later in
this chapter. That aside, use this chapter to check out what profitable oppor-
tunities await you (and why) with base metals.
Understanding How Base Metals 
Fit into Your Portfolio
You’ve probably never been more interested in base metals than you are now,
or perhaps you really aren’t interested at all and you just flipped to this chap-
ter by accident. In either case, you need to check out the following sections so
you can fully understand why base metals should play a role in your portfolio.

The building blocks of society
The world’s population keeps growing. In recent years it has surpassed 6 bil-
lion and in years to come there will be more and more people. Now whether or
not you decide to become a hermit, you can at least benefit from this relentless
growth in “people” production. After all, more people means that more things
have to be created. More people mean more cars, more houses, more hospitals
and schools, and oodles of other stuff that need raw materials.
A huge part of the world’s need for more base metals is the economic growth
of huge population centers such as China, India, and lesser (but still robust)
countries such as Brazil. In recent years, China and India transformed them-
selves into economic giants as they became more free-market in their orienta-
tion. This culminated in voracious demand for consumer and industrial
goods. So, current and future demand for base metals becomes assured.
The need for base metals as the building blocks of society isn’t just limited to
the relatively new economies burgeoning across the globe; it is also an issue
in the United States and Europe. Our relatively older societies have massive
infrastructures that need replacement or refurbishing. The old building blocks
need to be replaced with new building blocks. In other words, base metals will
be in demand for the foreseeable future.
As populations and economies keep growing, base metals such as copper,
aluminum, zinc, nickel, and lesser-known metals will need to be provided.
Well-run companies that find these metals and extract them from the earth
will continue to be profitable (for stock investors as well). Trading and specu-
lating in base metals will continue to provide opportunities for us in futures
(and options on futures).
The up and down for base metals
The first thing that you would probably extract from the above section is that
supply and demand for base metals are definitely positive. Economic growth
is a huge plus for base metals and investments tied to them. Long-term
investors and speculators will ultimately see growth in their base metals–
related investments. But base metals are a double-edged sword (they are
probably in the sword, too). Because the fortunes of base metals are tied 
to the economy, they will therefore be very sensitive to economic shifts.
Base metals and inflation
Besides supply and demand, another factor in the ongoing picture for base
metals is inflation. Why is that a factor? Review the following two points and
put your economic thinking hat on. Inflation is the excessive creation of a
112
Part II: Mining the Landscape of Metals

country’s currency. As in the case of the U.S., the more dollars the govern-
ment creates, the more dollars there are out there chasing a limited supply of
goods and services. Inflating the currency results in price inflation. How does
this impact base metals?
Base metals are a finite commodity. In other words, you can’t make any more
of them. Whatever base metals you find (both above and below ground) . . .
that’s it! As a strictly limited resource, you can’t simply grow more (as we 
can with grains or other food stuffs), and you can’t create more (like those
pesky widgets we keep reading about). You get the picture. So that’s the 
first point: whatever you have . . . that’s it.
The supply of humans and fiat currencies (such as dollars, yen, and so on)
keep expanding. The bottom line is that more humans with more money
means more demand, which is inflationary and results in higher prices for
finite supplies of stuff, such as base metals (and other metals mentioned
throughout the book). Hence, the price of base metals–related investments
has a bright, long-term picture. Kapeesh?
Base metals versus precious metals
Some investors may have the attitude that “metals are metals” and that they
have the same economic and financial qualities, but that is not so. Base metals
and precious metals, despite the “metallic similarity,” are quite different ani-
mals. It is like talking about the jaguar in the Amazon jungle and the Jaguar in
the dealer showroom (actually the one in the showroom has both base and
precious metals but that’s a different story altogether).
The performance of base metals as an investment category is closely tied to
the performance of the general economy, especially in cyclical industries such
as housing, construction, technology, and automotive. In addition, base metals
are used in industries tied to government spending that may or may not cor-
relate with economic growth. Good examples of this are national defense and
municipal infrastructure expenditures. Tanks, bullets, and bridges use lots of
base metals.
Precious metals, on the other hand, have different dynamics. Their historical
performance bears this out. When inflation and economic stagnation (stagfla-
tion) were raging in the 1970s, precious metals provided superlative gains for
investors that far outpaced base metals and for obvious reasons.
Let me just give you a down-’n’-dirty, nitty-gritty comparison: When the econ-
omy is wonderful and growing, consider base metals. When the economy is
struggling and uncertain, consider precious metals. When energy prices are
soaring, precious metals (gold, silver, and . . . yes . . . uranium) are a good
consideration. In real time (as I am writing this book), I think that a prudent
course is to have “all the above.” In other words, diversify.
113
Chapter 9: Base Metals

Past performance
Imagine a greater percentage that some of the sexy, big-name tech stocks
couldn’t outdo. Yes, if base metals were in Hollywood they would be like
Phyllis Diller, but the returns on base metals would be like Sophia Loren!
During 2000–2007, most of the attention was on the general stock market, real
estate, and energy. Few noticed precious metals and even fewer noticed base
metals. Yet, base metals as an investment category performed very well. GFMS
Metals Consulting (www.gfms-metalsconsulting.com) created an index
to track the general price performance for the leading base metals (on the
official LME cash settlement price for primary aluminum, copper, lead, nickel,
tin, and zinc) based on the official London Mercantile Exchange (LME) cash
settlement prices extracted from daily trading activity on the LME. The GFMS
index is an average of the six base metals prices with equal weight given to
each of them.
Covering All the Bases
A base metal is a common and generally inexpensive metal that can oxidize
or corrode relatively easily (not that that is a selling point, mind you). Base
metals are also referred to as nonferrous metals, which means that they are
metals or alloys that are entirely (or mostly) free of iron in their physical
makeup. These qualities distinguish themselves from precious metals that
generally do not corrode (such as gold or platinum, which are referred to as
noble metals).
Centuries ago, base metals were used in alchemy to try to convert them to
precious metals (but . . . surprisingly . . . to no avail). Today we don’t try to
convert base metals to precious metals since base metals had great use in
more down-to-earth pursuits like building houses and such. Besides, if you
want precious metals that badly then just go and buy them instead. In the fol-
lowing sections, I give you the stars of this show — the most common base
metals that offer investment opportunities.
Copper
Copper has been used by civilization for centuries. Few commodities are as
“in lock step” with the world economy as copper. After iron and aluminum, it
is third on the hit parade of the world’s most widely used metals. It is used
extensively in industries such as construction, manufacturing, and machin-
ery parts. As the rest of the world modernizes and keeps building infrastruc-
ture, copper will continue to have a bright future. How has it done so far?
Just check out Figure 9-1.
114
Part II: Mining the Landscape of Metals

In September 2002, you could have bought copper for about 60¢ a pound.
Five years later, a pound of copper is priced at $3.25 for a total percentage
gain of over 441%. Sweet!
Keep in mind that the above chart (and the charts that follow) shouldn’t just
show you how well that particular base metal did over the long term (such as
five years) but also to show how the short term (such as a three-month period)
can be so volatile. Look at the price of copper during 2006. In the first six
months it shot upward like a rocket ship, doubling from $2 in January 2007 to
$4 by May 2006. It then experienced a mini-crash as it plunged to under $2.50
by February 2007 (ouch!).
There are lessons here for investors, traders, and speculators of all stripes. The
long term is easier to manage than the short term since the overall trend will
benefit you in spite of the zigs and zags. Short-term investors can get burned
since corrections can come fast and furiously. Traders, on the other hand,
look for this volatility so that they can put on a variety of positions that could
benefit from the downs as well as the ups.
Aluminum
Aluminum is a light, corrosion-resistant metal widely used in our economy. And
I don’t just mean the aluminum foil you keep in your kitchen drawer! You 
will also see it used in aerospace, housing, automotive, and technological
applications.
Believe it or not, the largest single area that consumes and uses aluminum is
the transportation sector. It absorbs approximately 30% of U.S. aluminum
production. The uses for it keep growing and so it is a good investment bet 
as the world economy keeps growing as indicated in Figure 9-2.

Chapter 9: Base Metals

Aluminum was 60¢ a pound in September 2002 and after briefly spiking to
nearly $1.50 in May 2006 still settled at $1.10 per pound by September 2007
for a total percentage gain of 83%. Considering how some of the other base
metals did over the same time frame (the other primary base metals went up
from 288% to 650%), that 83% seems like a real laggard! Then again, when you
compare it to standard barometers of investment performance (such as the
S&P 500 index), it’s a solid gain. Incidentally, the S&P 500 went up 65%.
Nickel
Nickel is used in many applications as an alloying metal. An alloy is a material
composed of two or more chemical elements of which at least one is a metal.
Stainless steel, for example, is an alloy. It is composed of carbon, chromium,
iron, and . . . you guessed it . . . nickel.
Nickel has a high melting point and it is resistant to corrosion. Early in the 20th
century, it was discovered that by combining nickel with steel, even in small
quantities, the durability of the steel increased significantly with regards to
corrosion resistance and strength. The steel industry is now the largest con-
sumer of nickel. Figure 9-3 shows you nickel’s performance.
In the five-year span that ended September 2007, nickel’s price went from
under $3 a pound to $12.50 for a total percentage gain of 317%. Pretty good
but that’s not the whole story. In 2006, nickel was the single highest perform-
ing asset. In fact, during the 12-month period ending in June 2007, nickel went
from $5 to $25 in one year . . . a blistering 400% gain that would make any
trader salivate. Of course, in the ebb and flow of the market, nickel took a
breather and retreated to $13 by August 2007. What a ride!

Zinc
Zinc is usually found as a co-product with other base metals such as lead. It
is mainly used for industrial purposes such as galvanizing which gives extra
protection against corrosion in a wide array of manufactured goods such as
building construction, automobiles, machinery and other hard goods. As the
world economy continues to grow, the price of zinc will certainly grow along
with it (see Figure 9-4). Keep this in mind next time you have a zinc lozenge.
Lead
The uses of lead can be traced back to the earliest days of history. The Romans
described it as the basest of base metals due to the ease with which it could
be beaten or melted. In recent time, lead has come into its own with the evo-
lution of applications such as petrol additives, pigments, chemicals, crystal

glass, and batteries. The largest market for lead is in battery production, con-
suming approximately two thirds of the lead produced in the western world.
Lead’s relationship with the LME began before the turn of the century,
although dealings were unofficial. By 1903, it was being traded in a small sec-
ondary ring, but still without an official price setting. Lead was first officially
traded in 1920 and the current standard lead contract, introduced in 1953,
has become the mainstay for international free trade in this metal. You can
check out lead’s performance in Figure 9-5.
Whew! What a performance. When they say “get the lead out” they’re not kid-
ding. During the five-year time frame, lead went from 20¢ a pound to $1.50 for
a total percentage gain of 650%. It just makes the tears well up in my eyes!
Tin
Tin is a base metal that has been fused to other metals such as lead, zinc, and
steel to prevent corrosion. Tin-plated steel containers are widely used for
food preservation, and this forms a large part of the demand for tin. Tin’s 
performance is illustrated in Figure 9-6.

As you can see, tin has performed very well in recent years. The price of tin
was about $1.80 per pound in September 2002 and it hit $7 by September
2007. That makes for a total percentage gain of nearly 289%. If the Tin Man in
the Wizard of Oz only knew! His tin futures could have bought him a heart
and a nice duplex in Kansas.
Other metals
How about some other metals that few are talking about? As if there is a cock-
tail party where some fellow with an ascot and brandy is saying, “Hmmm. 
You mean there is more to life than merely lead and tin?!” Get a life. This stuff
doesn’t have to be interesting — it just has to be profitable — which leads us
to other metals that may be obscure but still offer profitable opportunities.
Using the resources at the end of the chapter, take a look at metals that have
stirred some interest in the marketplace. You just might find the next metal to
score a triple-digit percentage gain in a short period of time. Here are some
potential winners:
 Molybdenum
 Cobalt
 Titanium
 Manganese
 Chromium
 Iron ore
 Tungsten
 Kryptonite
Base Metal Investing Vehicles
The ways to invest, trade, or speculate in base metals are really quite varied.
Whether you are aggressive or conservative in your approach, whether you
are long-term or short-term in your time horizon, there are a variety of ways
to include base metals in your portfolio.
119
Chapter 9: Base Metals

Futures
Base metals in the form of futures contracts are the most speculative vehicles.
Futures, in general, tend to be risky and volatile and metals-related futures
(either precious or base) tend to have even greater risk and volatility.
Experienced traders and other short-term speculators embrace this roller-
coaster aspect of the futures market. For anyone else, either have extra
antacid and aspirin handy or just plain avoid this area.
For those who are aware of the risk and still want to proceed with a portion
of their risk capital (as opposed to rent money or your retirement nest egg),
then base metals futures offer lots of choices and opportunities.
To investigate what base metals futures contracts are available, the best
places to start your research are at the New York Mercantile Exchange
(www.nymex.com) and the London Mercantile Exchange (www.lme.com).
The futures market is covered in Chapter 14.
For those who want to try risking some money on futures, it is probably more
advisable to look at options as a way to limit risk and still have opportunities
for speculative gains.
Options
In recent years, the variety and availability of options has been explosive.
Options (such as calls and puts) are a huge and popular segment of the world
of derivatives. I couldn’t do justice to this topic in this segment so please
read Chapter 15 for a better treatment of this phenomenal topic.
With options, I can choose strategies that can be ultra-aggressive or very con-
servative. You can use options to make a bet on the underlying investments to
go up . . . or down. You can use options to make potentially explosive gains or
steady income. Some options strategies can be risky and volatile; other strate-
gies can be used to increase safety and peace of mind by helping to limit risk.
The options strategies available for base metals (and their related invest-
ments) are just as varied as in any other assets.
There are options on
 Futures (all the primary base metals mentioned in this chapter have
options available on them)
 Stocks of base metals–mining and –processing companies
 Base metals–related ETFs
120
Part II: Mining the Landscape of Metals

Options are also good vehicles that can work in tandem with your investments.
If, for example, you have shares of stock in a major base metals–mining 
company, check to see if it publicly traded options on the stock.
You can find out easily by going to the Chicago Board Options Exchange
(www.cboe.com) and get a detailed listing of options available by going to
their Web site and entering your stock’s symbol. Then you employ strategies
that could generate extra income from your stock holdings (such as through
covered call-writing). Or you can do a protective put to limit your stock’s
downside risk. These strategies are further detailed in Chapter 15.
Mining stocks
For most folks, especially those who have a long-term investing approach
(again, as opposed to short-term trading and/or speculating), base metals–
mining stocks would make sense. These can be easily broken down between
small-cap and large-cap stocks. The cap is a reference to market capitaliza-
tion (not headgear). Market capitalization is just a fancy phrase for the com-
pany’s market value. The market value is simple math: the number of shares
outstanding times the current market price per share. A company that has 
1 million shares outstanding and is $12 per share would then have a market
cap of $12 million. Easy! Market caps of under $1 billion are generally consid-
ered small cap. One to ten billion is generally the range for mid-cap, and
above $10 billion is large-cap. If they are, say, over $50 billion then they are
referred to as mega-cap. Just to jump to the other end, firms that are under
$100 million tend to be called “micro caps.” Don’t be too hung up on the
exact numbers; I think you get the picture.
Base metals miners tend to be broken up into firms that are explorers and the
majors. The explorers are typically small caps and are also called junior mining
stocks. The majors are established firms that are producing and selling what
metals and minerals that they are extracting from the ground.
Fundamental analysis
Because I think that the stocks should be considered long-term, fundamental
analysis is the preferred approach (versus technical analysis, which is covered
in Chapter 18). In fundamental analysis, you look at the company’s financial
strengths, profitability, and its standing in the marketplace.
Investing in stocks and other investment vehicles that cater to human needs
is a long-term winning formula. Since base metals are so necessary for a
modern society it stands to reason that if you have a company that consis-
tently provides it at a profit and that manages its financial affairs accordingly,
you have a solid stock pick. Fundamental analysis brings it together: A prof-
itable company that provides something that the market wants. But let’s dig 
a little deeper.
121
Chapter 9: Base Metals

There are very few companies in the metals industry that only do one metal.
Many metals are found in the same geologic locations. Silver, for example, is
usually a byproduct that accompanies other metals such as gold or copper.
Therefore, it is common that mining companies have more than one base
metal (and/or precious metal) that they mine and resell. This is a net positive
since companies with diversified mining assets are a safer bet than a com-
pany that is banking on a lone metal.
Keep in mind that the resources at the end of this chapter are also great
resources to find and analyze mining companies. Lastly, the mining com-
pany’s leading asset is, of course, its proven reserves of metals. In that 
case, a mining firm that specializes in base metals has similar attributes to
precious metals mining firms. Get some important points and resources
about choosing mining stocks in Chapter 12.
Looking at the numbers
I won’t make you go nuts by looking at and analyzing all the numbers, but
you should ask some crucial questions about the financials of the company
after you get past the point of knowing that the company offers something
that the market wants and needs:
 Is the company profitable? It should be consistently making a profit in
each of the past three years and each successive year’s profit should be
greater than the year before. This data is in the company’s income state-
ment that is made publicly available. If you are looking at junior mining
stocks which may not be generating a profit, then you should look into
the company’s cash flow and cash on-hand to keep it afloat until it scores
with metals discoveries.
 Does the company have enough capital on hand to finance growth?
You can look at the balance sheet and see that it has cash on hand,
accounts receivables (money coming in from customers), and lines of
credit. Mining is an expensive pursuit so adequate capital is necessary
as it takes time to extract saleable metals from the ground.
 Does the company have low or manageable levels of debt? Its assets
should be double the size of its liabilities (or better). Having too much
debt will be a problem, especially if there is a slowdown in the economy
which affects the company’s cash flow (and therefore its ability to pay
its debts).
There’s more to choosing a company than that but those are among the top
considerations. Get more details on the financials of the company with some
guidance and resources in Chapter 12.
122
Part II: Mining the Landscape of Metals

Mutual funds
There are very few ways to invest in base metals through mutual funds and
exchange-traded funds (ETFs; see next section) that are “pure plays” (being
100% in base metals or close enough) in base metals. Typically, mutual funds
that have base metals-related investments (such as mining stocks) would be
in a more broadly based sector called basic materials, raw materials, or natu-
ral resources.
Additionally, there are mutual funds that cover metals in general. Some tend
to lump in base metals with precious metals to have an “all-purpose metals
sector fund.” Although this sounds like it makes sense it is really an optimal
strategy since base metals work a little differently compared to precious
metals. To play base metals based on expectations of economic growth, 
they are best paired with natural resources with similar supply and demand
dynamics (such as lumber and cement). Precious metals tend to play off of
different dynamics such as inflation and economic uncertainty.
When you seek out mutual funds that generally cover the “natural resources”
(or commodities) industry you will see plenty of choices since many mutual
fund firms have added mutual funds that emphasize this industry since the
start of the natural resources bull market in 2000.
Because mutual funds that concentrate on natural resources can have a wide
variety of choices (both stocks of companies that do base metals and many
that don’t) it is advisable to check the most recent “portfolio snapshot” pro-
vided by the mutual fund manager. It usually accompanies the mutual fund
prospectus and it is commonly available at the firm’s Web site. In addition,
many major financial Web sites (such as www.marketwatch.com and www.
finance.yahoo.com) will usually list the top holdings of that particular fund.
Exchange-traded funds (ETFs)
Alas, although the ETF choices are limited for base metals enthusiasts, the
growing interest in this necessary industry will no doubt offer more alterna-
tives in the coming months and years. After all, there were no base metals-
related ETFs at all in early 2006. But by January 2007, there were two with
substantial base metals exposure (see below). To see what else may become
available, check in every now and then with the exchange that has been lead-
ing the pack with ETF listings, the American Stock Exchange (www.amex.com).
123
Chapter 9: Base Metals

SPDR Metals and Mining ETF (XME)
XME is an ETF issued by Standard and seeks investment results that, before
expenses, generally correspond to the performance of the SandP Metals and
Mining Select Industry Index.
How has it fared since it started trading (June 22, 2006)? That day, XME closed
at the price of $44.85 per share. At the end of trading on August 31, 2007, it
closed at $57.92. For the time frame (a hair over fourteen months), it did well
with a total percentage gain of 29% (not bad!). During the same time frame,
the S&P 500 index scored a total percentage gain of 18.3%, which is pretty
good too but again, base metals displayed their “precious mettle.”
The PowerShares DB Base Metals Fund (DBB)
DBB is an ETF issued by DB Commodity Services. They maintain a series of
ETFs called “PowerShares TM.” DBB premiered in January 2007 and it tracks
the Deutsche Bank Liquid Commodity Index–Optimum Yield Base Metals
Excess Return (whew . . . that’s a mouthful). It is an index ETF composed of
futures contracts on three of the most liquid and widely used base metals –
aluminum, copper, and zinc. DBB is intended to mirror the performance of
the base metals (also called “industrial metals”) industry. How has it fared?
On its first day of trading (January 5, 2007), it closed that day at $23.71 per
share. On the last trading day of August (barely eight months later) it ended
the day at $25.93. A not-too-shabby percentage gain of 9.4% (for a measly
eight months, that’s more-than-respectable). During the same time frame, the
S&P 500 (a broad stock market index) had a percentage gain of about 4.6%. In
other words, DBB did twice as well as the S&P 500 index. Keep in mind that
the time frame is too short to make a valid observation. However, it does give
a small example of the power of diversifying your portfolio with some of the
building blocks of society.
For now, there are some great ETFs that offer a conservative way to add base
metals exposure to any portfolio. More information on mutual funds and ETFs
in Chapter 13.
By the way, about that question from the beginning of the chapter, you know,
the one about what base metal was used most by the Swiss navy. The answer
is . . . fooled you! There is no Swiss navy (it is a land-locked nation). However,
you do earn extra points if you said that base metals are used in their
watches and army knives.

Chapter 10
Buying Metals Direct
In This Chapter
 Sizing up metals
 Checking out gold and silver bullion
 Finding dealers and resources
M
ost folks know something about gold and silver and can figure out to
some extent what bullion coins and bars are. Although there are a
wide variety of choices even in this apparently narrow area of the precious
metals world, it actually won’t be that difficult to choose. Buying and selling
can be as easy as a phone call or a visit to a Web site. In this chapter, I explore
the various ways you can buy metals directly.
Weighty Matters
The most common measure of weight that you’ll come across is the ounce
but we need to understand what kind of ounce. There are troy ounces and
avoirdupois. My goodness . . . who thought that up? Probably the same guy
who called cave exploring spelunking. Anyway, precious metals are measured
in troy ounces.
Regular weight that you and I and the guy at the deli counter are familiar 
with is the avoirdupois. Avoirdupois (why don’t they change that to regular
weight?) is 16 ounces to a pound while that same 16 ounces is 14.58 in troy
ounces. The troy ounce is roughly 10% heavier than the avoirdupois 
equivalent.
Bullion coins and bars are those in which you pay every cost above the actual
metallic content. Gold may be $600 an ounce but that same ounce as a bullion
gold coin or bar may be a few bucks more (due to fabrication costs). Bullion
coins and bars are about as close as you can conveniently get to tracking 100%
of the price of that metal, be it gold, silver, platinum, or palladium. Bullion
coins and bars are generally bought purely because of the metal content and
little else.

The Case for Physical Ownership
Physical ownership means having the actual asset in your possession. This
contrasts with paper assets where most investors have greater familiarity.
Examples of paper assets are stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. In the world
of bullion there is paper in the form of silver (or other precious metal) certifi-
cates and pooled account programs.
In a paper asset, you have a claim on an asset via that piece of paper. The
paper derives its value from the value of the underlying asset. For example, if
you owned 100 shares of Gobbledegook Corporation, you own a small sliver
of that company and the value of your shares rises and falls with the fortunes
(or lack of fortune) of the company involved. If the public goes ga-ga over
Gobbledegook (it happens more often than you think), then your shares will
go up. If the company has problems or goes bankrupt, your shares will end
up no better than bits of paper. Paper assets have potential problems quite
different from owning the physical asset. For many investors, having the
physical in your possession is more desirable.
Let’s make the paper versus physical comparison more relevant since having,
say, silver coins and having shares in a stock (even more specifically a silver
mining stock) can be an example of comparing apples to oranges. Whenever
investors are debating the merits of physical ownership, they are most likely
talking about physical metal and paper representing the physical metal.
Since the 1970s, ownership in precious metals has taken various forms. The
most obvious is the subject of this chapter which is physical ownership. In
addition, there are competing forms of ownership through paper. Some 
examples are
 Silver certificates and warehouse receipts (can be allocated or 
unallocated)
 Perth Mint Bullion Certificates (unallocated)
 Perth Mint Bullion Certificates (allocated)
 Pooled Accounts (unallocated)
Note the terms allocated and unallocated. Allocated to metal means that it is
segregated from other assets held by that company. It usually has its own serial
number and you are charged more for this type of arrangement. Unallocated
means that you have an ownership share along with others in a large pooled
amount of metal that is not segregated and is not separately numbered. It’s
like when you go to a baseball game and you see the difference between pres-
tigious box seats and the bleacher seats out in right field. Well . . . I hope you
got that. Anyway, the unallocated usually has lower transaction and storage
charges. The safer of the two is allocated.
130
Part III: Investing Vehicles 

For those who want to consider these venues then at least make sure that the
companies you deal with have a long and unblemished record. A good exam-
ple is the Perth Mint (based in Australia; visit its Web site www.perth
mint.com.au). Some other places to consider are Sunshine Mint, Monex,
and Kitco, Inc.
What could go wrong with paper assets
When I talk about what could go wrong with paper assets, I emphasize the
point that there is a clear distinction between physical metal and paper rep-
resenting the physical metal. You’ll run into both. Because metals-related
paper investment vehicles come in many forms, I think that it is helpful to
summarize what could go wrong with paper assets versus the physical metal.
The most obvious potential pitfall with paper assets is the risk of default. The
second potential pitfall is fraud. When you buy physical silver, for example,
and you have it delivered . . . you have the physical silver. Period! With paper
silver we need to keep in mind that the paper is a promise to deliver the
underlying asset or to otherwise have a claim to that asset or to beneficial
ownership, be it silver, gold, or other precious metal. For potential pitfalls 
of the various categories of paper assets, please review the accompanying
Table 10-1 below.

Bullion versus numismatics
Let’s get physical; how does bullion stack up versus numismatic? The prime
benefit of buying bullion is that you get 100% correlation with the asset itself.
If you have silver bullion and silver goes up 20% or down 10% then your silver
bullion will perform accordingly. It is a pure play on the asset.
Numismatics involve far more than just the metal content. The metal content,
even if it was a precious metal, may still be a secondary or even minor factor
in the value. A good example is some uncirculated gold double eagles. You
could easily see a coin valued at $50,000 but the intrinsic metal value portion
of the coin could be far lower. That coin may only have an ounce of gold and
if the market price of gold is $650 then the intrinsic metal value would be only
$650. What would account for the remaining $49,350 of value in that double
eagle? The other factors of course, such as scarcity, condition, popularity,
and so on. Chapter 11 goes into greater detail about numismatic coins.
The downside to numismatic coins can be the cost and the potential for
problems in areas such as grading and dealer markups. Numismatic coins
have a wholesale and a retail price that could have a wide margin that could
be 30% or more (the premium over dealer cost). Bullion coins have a lower
premium that could range from 2% to 10%. Bullion bars could have an even
lower premium. Of the two, the coins have a higher premium because they
aren’t just lumps of metal; they are minted coins so the cost of fabrication is
a factor.
When you are buying bullion coins, you pay a small premium over the metal
content cost and it could vary depending on the dealer. Also keep in mind
that when the time comes to sell your coins, you will get the price of the
metal and some premium as well. Of course you will receive a lower premium
132
Part III: Investing Vehicles 

than you paid but at least you get something extra. This is why bullion coins
(and especially numismatic coins) should be held for the long term so that
there is enough appreciation to hopefully more than offset the transaction
costs you incur at the time of purchase.
Other metals
Owning physical metals is usually a reference for gold and silver. Having gold
and silver is a practice dating back to the dawn of civilization but . . . how
about other metals? Owning other metals directly in bullion form is not a large
market at all. After gold and silver, the next one is platinum but it is a distant
third. Recently, palladium has become available as a bullion investment.
Beyond those four precious metals, there’s really nothing else in a convenient
venue for physical ownership. What else could there be? Uranium might as
well be kryptonite. Base metals are principally available as numismatic items
and even then the base metal content is not the primary catalyst for investors.
Is there such a thing as bullion base metals? Naah . . . not really. Nickel, for
example, is measured in tons. Unless you have a really big yard, nickel and
other base metals in bullion form are not feasible and out of the question.
Even aluminum is out of the question . . . unless you’re keeping some in your
kitchen cabinet for wrapping food.
The risks of owning physical
The biggest concern of owning the physical outright is safeguarding it.
Keeping the physical entails two risks:
 Someone could steal it. This is the most likely risk.
 The government could confiscate it. This may seem unlikely or very
improbable but it’s not impossible. History has taught us that govern-
ment encroachment has happened before and it could happen again.
Heck . . . if I told you in 2004 that local governments would have the
power to take the home of a law-abiding, tax-paying citizen and that
person could have no recourse (the eminent domain issue, authorized
and expanded by the Supreme Court in 2005) you would have thought I
was crazy.
In safeguarding your precious metals, how you secure it is also important. If
you have gold and silver stored in a bank safe deposit box, the government
can confiscate under certain conditions. Many folks prefer putting it in a
secure place at home or their business. Use your discretion.
133
Chapter 10: Buying Metals Direct

If keeping precious metals at home is a little unsettling for you then consider
an alternative that many precious metals investors have used in recent years:
James Turk’s Gold Money program at www.goldmoney.com. The metals are
allocated and insured.
Forms of Gold Physical Bullion
The first area of bullion to consider is with the ancient metal of kings: gold.
With its beauty, reputation, and long history as a store of value and safe
haven investment, it is a great experience to hold some in your hands.
Fortunately, there are plenty of ways to do it, starting right here in the U.S.
One of the first things you learn about is karats. Also known as carats but def-
initely not known as carrots. The karat is a measure of fineness. A karat in
gold is equal to 1⁄24 part of pure gold (in an alloy). Here is a rundown of how
many karats you need to be aware of:
 24 karat gold: Equals pure gold (100% gold).
 22 karat gold: 11⁄12 gold and 1⁄12 other (such as copper). A bullion coin or
bar that is 22 karat gold is roughly 92% pure gold.
 18 karat gold: 18⁄24 gold (the other 6⁄24 is copper or other metal). Basically
75% of the item is pure gold.
 14 karat gold: 14⁄24 of the item is gold. In other words, 58.3% of it is pure
gold.
One hundred percent pure gold is too malleable (soft) for regular use and it
needs to be hardened by alloying it (mixing or combining it) with another
metal such as copper or silver (or other metal). Twenty-four karat jewelry, for
example, needs to be handled with much greater care than twenty-two karat
(or lower) jewelry. This is why I try to get my wife to buy zero karat jewelry
because . . . you know . . . it’s a heck of a lot more durable . . . really. But I
haven’t succeeded in presenting my case. Oh well . . .
American eagle gold bullion coins
For gold investors, this coin is the first bullion vehicle to look into. In 1986 the
United States Mint first starting minting the Eagle coin series (22 karats). 
The gold eagle caught on very fast and it’s the top selling gold eagle in the
country today. They are beautiful coins. The coin’s design echoes the original
design of the $20 gold eagle done by Augustus Saint-Guadens as commissioned
by then-President Teddy Roosevelt.
134
Part III: Investing Vehicles 

The authenticity, content, weight, and metallic purity of gold eagles are guar-
anteed by the United States government, which makes them an acceptable
investment not only to American investors but in international markets as well.
The advantages of gold eagles are numerous. Many financial advisors see
them as a good way to diversify the typical portfolio. Gold is well known as
an inflation hedge and gold eagles are a convenient way to add this benefit 
to long-term investment strategies. Gold eagles are very popular and the
market for them is very large so buying and selling them is not a problem.
Buying or selling them is usually private and nonreportable when done in
small quantities.
Gold eagles are typically sold as one-ounce bullion coins. However, you can
also get them in half-ounce, quarter-ounce, and 1⁄10 ounce denominations. 
This makes gold affordable for just about any portfolio.
The American Buffalo Gold Bullion Coin
As gold rose in value in recent years, the interest in gold bullion picked up.
Since the gold eagle was hitting record sales levels, why not other gold coins?
It was at that point that the newest gold bullion kid on the block showed up:
the 24-karat American Buffalo Gold Bullion Coin.
The face value of the coin is $50 and for the first time ever investors can get
one troy ounce of pure gold in bullion coin form. These coins were manufac-
tured by the U.S. Mint at West Point and they come in special protective hold-
ers. (Remember that pure gold is soft.)
The Krugerrand
Issued in 1970 by South Africa, the Krugerrand was the world’s first gold bul-
lion coin. Since their issuance, nearly 55 million coins have been bought and
sold across the globe. The 22-karat coins are available in 1 oz., 1⁄2 oz., 1⁄4 oz.,
and 1⁄10 oz. denominations. Because they have a huge market and are highly
liquid, buying and selling them are easy.
The Canadian Maple Leaf
Issued by the Royal Canadian Mint, the Maple Leaf is one of the world’s most
popular gold bullion coins. Guaranteed by the Government of Canada for its
authenticity and metallic content, the Maple Leaf has a purity extremely
close to 24 karats: It’s 99.99% gold, making it the world’s purest gold coin. In
addition to its reputation and quality, the Maple Leaf is also very liquid and
accepted internationally.

Other gold bullion
Gold bars are popular and safe choices for investors and they have relatively
lower premiums than minted coins. It’s a good idea to buy them from sources
that get these bars manufactured by Pamp Suisse and Credit Suisse. The gold
bullion bar available sizes are
 400 oz. bullion bars
 100 oz. bullion bars
 Kilo bullion bar (32.15 oz.)
 10 oz. bullion bars
Silver Physical Bullion
I like silver and I am very bullish on silver. I think that long term it is a good
part of virtually any portfolio. Silver bullion is the best and easiest way to
start participating. I give you several ways to get involved in silver in the 
following sections.
American Eagle Silver Bullion Coins
The U.S. Mint started minting these beautiful coins in 1986. With nearly 135
million coins sold since then, the American Eagle Silver Bullion Coins have
become the world’s best-selling silver coins. The design of these 1-oz. coins
(.999 silver content) was inspired by Adolph A. Weinman, the designer of the
1916 Walking Liberty half dollar.
A primary advantage of the silver eagle is that it is very liquid so buying and
selling are easy and convenient. A primary disadvantage is that the premium
can run as high as $2 over the metal content value (depending on the dealer).
One-ounce rounds
These bullion coins weigh one ounce and they are .999 pure silver. They’re
like the silver eagle, but they have lower premiums. Private mints create
them and the premium is typically 40¢ to 50¢ above the metal content value.
Silver rounds aren’t as well known as silver eagles, but they make good
choices for investors who want to get more silver bang for the buck.

Junk silver bags
This may sound like an odd way to invest in silver but it is actually a great
consideration. A junk silver bag has $1,000 of face-value silver coins issued 
in 1964 or earlier. The reason it has that less-than-appealing name is because
the coins in the bag are in poor condition and you won’t find any coin that is
rare or has numismatic value. The coins are generally worn down from usage
and would not be considered at any numismatic grade above good. For more
information about grading and numismatic coins, see Chapter 11.
The $1,000 bag weighs about 55 pounds and it contains about 715 oz. of pure
silver. What kinds of coins are in the bag? If half dollars were used there
would be 2,000 coins. If the coins were quarters then there would be 4,000
coins. Dimes? Then there would be 10,000 coins. Because the bag of coins is
bought as a bullion investment, the price of the bag would move in correla-
tion with the price of silver. Many firms can sell you half bags that have $500
of face-value silver coins to make it easier for storage and handling.
Even though these old coins are generally priced as bullion, they are coins
that are no longer minted. That tells you that there is a finite supply so 
prices for these bags could rise further if demand increases.
The difference between the buy and sell is fairly constant and there are
investors who buy bags when premiums are cheap or negative and trade
them when premiums increase substantially. Keep in mind that you’re
required by law to report your sale of $1,000 face 90% bags on IRS Form
1099B. Smaller quantities of 90% are not reportable.
The $1,000 bag of silver dollars
This interesting play in silver is not exactly a bullion investment but it is not
a rare coin investment either. Circulated silver dollars struck between 1878
and 1935 carry higher premiums, yet they are a prime source of legal tender
silver coins because they are so recognizable. These early dollars are divided
into two price categories. The more expensive Morgan dollars struck between
1878 and 1904 and the Peace dollars struck between 1921 and 1935.
The Peace dollar being the less expensive is quoted by the bag. Such coins
are always in average condition and grade VG (Very Good). A Morgan dollar
bag and better quality coins are available at slightly higher prices so it pays
to ask questions before placing an order. This option is popular because
silver dollar bags have represented real, portable wealth for more than 
100 years.
137
Chapter 10: Buying Metals Direct

The 40% silver bag
The last silver coin the United States made for general circulation was the 40%
silver clad 50¢ struck from 1965 through 1969. This is another popular way to
own silver bullion in legal tender form. Like circulated 90% coins these $1,000
face bags are traded primarily for content. Because they are 40% pure a bag
contains substantially less silver (296 troy oz.) which is reflected in a lower
selling price.
The buyer has a number of advantages. First these are real U.S. coins and
therefore are legal tender of our nation. In an emergency this could be signifi-
cant. Second, the bag has a high face value ($1,000) which limits the money
anyone could lose should silver move lower. This is easily seen in a down
market because premiums almost always move higher. And finally, unlike 
90% silver bags, you are not required to fill out I.R.S. Form 1099B on 40% 
bags when you sell.
Silver bars and ingots
In terms of getting the most silver metal content against the purchase price
(in other words, paying the least amount of premium over metal content),
bullion bars are the way to go. Ingots are really just small bars that are
imprinted with designs to make the bar attractive and/or collectible. Ingots
are more appropriate for collectors rather than for investors. In this segment
we’ll concentrate on bars (uh . . . bullion bars not adult drinking places).
The common popular brands that most investors will come across are
Engelhard (www.engelhard.com) and Johnson-Matthey (www.matthey.
com). There are more obscure sources but these two have a long-time 
reputation for their standards such as metallic quality and authenticity.
1,000 oz. silver bars
These bars tip the scales at about 68 pounds. They are typically used to
settle the delivery obligations of futures contracts at NYMEX (the New York
Mercantile Exchange; more about futures contracts in Chapter 14). A typical
futures contract is tied to 5,000 oz. of silver so five of these bars will cover
the physical requirements for delivery. The bottom line is that this size is not
practical for average-sized or small transactions typically done by investors.
Besides, why get sued by the delivery guy for his backache?
100 oz. silver bars
Another popular way to own bullion silver is the 100 troy oz. bar which is
.999 fine. At a tenth of the size, it is also a tenth of the weight: 6.8 pounds.
This is the most typical weight for large retail transactions among investors.
138
Part III: Investing Vehicles 

10 oz. silver bars
These are popular and the most common for small investors. They come with
a slightly higher relative cost but as an absolute transaction, fit the small
investor’s budget.
There are other bar sizes (such as odd-weight retail bars) but these are the
best sizes due to their acceptability in the marketplace and the high degree
of liquidity (being able to convert to cash).
Platinum bullion
Platinum is the third most well-known precious metal, yet (according to
industry reports) it is more rare than either gold or silver. Platinum is 15
times more scarce than gold! What better precious metal to consider adding
to your portfolio? One quality that platinum shares with silver is that there
are a variety of industrial uses for it. Its rarity and utility give it a bright
future. There are several ways to invest in platinum bullion:
 Platinum American Eagle Bullion Coin
 Platinum Bullion Bars
 Platinum Canadian Maple Leaf Bullion Coin
Palladium bullion
Palladium used to be too obscure to invest in. It was the precious metals’
equivalent of the one Marx brother whom no one knew (Grouch, Chico,
Harpo, and . . . ah . . . Gummo?!), but it has gained respectability and quickly
became, after silver and platinum, the “other white metal.” You won’t find
much in the way of palladium coinage in general but there is palladium 
bullion that you can purchase and invest in. As palladium becomes more
attractive in the ongoing precious metals bull market that started early in
this decade, it can become a part of your portfolio. Here are ways to invest 
in palladium bullion:
 Palladium Bullion Bars (manufactured by companies such as Pamp
Suisse and Credit Suisse)
 Palladium Canadian Maple Leaf Bullion Coin
 Palladium Chinese Panda Bullion Coin
For more details about palladium, see Chapter 7.

Chapter 10: Buying Metals Direct

Bullion’s costs and fees
When you are buying bullion coins or bars, you will come across “bid” and
“ask” prices. The difference between the bid and ask amounts is the spread.
Generally, coins and bars that are actively bought and sold have a relatively
small spread. Coins and bars that are in a slow or thinly traded market tend
to have wider spreads. This you need to know; when you are buying, you pay
the ask price. When you are selling, you will receive the bid price. The bid
and ask prices vary greatly from dealer to dealer.
In addition, find out about fees that cover costs such as shipping, storage,
and any transaction fees. The size/quantity of the order will matter. The pre-
mium per ounce on a 1,000-oz. bar order will be relatively lower than the 
premium on a 100-oz. bar order, which in turn will be relatively lower than 
for the 10-oz. bar order.
Even in the realm of precious metals, the advice from every consumer guide
in the history of humanity says “shop around for the best price.” Hey . . . the
best advice isn’t always the most original!
So, what kind of silver is best?
Some of this is tied to your preference. Those who are purists like the bars and
one ounce rounds. Those who want a more popular, more liquid, and easier
bullion transaction would opt for the U.S. Eagle coins. Your budget will also
dictate the transaction. Some buy a large, lump sum now. Still others will allo-
cate a portion of their monthly budget and do some dollar-cost averaging.
I think that serious investors would consider a portion into bullion as a part
of their precious metals foundation and then allocate a portion of their
investable funds among some of the paper assets (such as mining stocks and
ETFs). Over the long haul, accumulating your investing among the different
classes of physical and paper assets will prove rewarding as the precious
metals bull market unfolds in the coming months and years.
Gold and silver commemorative coins
I could have easily put the topic of commemorative coins in the numismatic
chapter, but I thought it would have a better fit here. Why? Commemorative
coins were not issued for circulation and the modern commemoratives had
greater value due to their metal content. But these coins can indeed be col-
lectible. These coins could easily become a beer commercial debate. (Tastes
great! Less filling!)
140
Part III: Investing Vehicles 

The real answer is that commemorative coins have something to offer both
the collector and the bullion investor. There are two types of commemorative
coins: early commemoratives issued 1892–1954 and modern commemoratives
issued from 1982 to the present. As the folks point out, the early commemora-
tive coins are highly collectible (they have both numismatic and investment
value), while the vast majority of modern issues are not. Some modern com-
memoratives have taken off such as the 1997-W gold Jackie Robinson $5 half
eagle. By mid-July 2007, that coin was trading in the $5,000 to $6,000 range.
The vast majority of modern commemorative coins do not fetch any substan-
tial value beyond their metal content. For serious investors, the early issues
are where the numismatic and investment action is.
The public is offered newly issued commemoratives that are very overpriced.
Frequently the price is ten times (or more) the value of the actual bullion
content if it is marketed with a recently deceased celebrity or famous event.
It may be touted as a collectible but it is either way overpriced or simply a
rip-off. The bottom line is that if you see it being marketed in expensive
venues such as television, then the items sold will be too expensive.
Among the more popular commemoratives are the 1892 Colombian Exposition
half-dollar (the first commemorative coin authorized by Congress) and 
the half-dollar commemorating George Washington-Carver (issued during the
years 1951–1954). During 1892–1954 the U.S. Mint produced commemorative
coins for 53 different events and honored individuals on a total of 157 differ-
ent gold and silver coins.
The same sources (listed throughout this chapter) that sell bullion coins usu-
ally sell commemorative coins. For more information on quality commemora-
tives you can turn to the sources listed in Chapter 11 (on numismatic coins)
as well as the U.S. Mint (www.usmint.gov) and the Society for United States
Commemorative Coins (www.suscconline.org).

through reports available at the Web site. His personal preference is silver
bought as bullion bars, rounds, and junk silver bags. Hommel is a staunch
proponent of owning (and taking delivery of) physical silver. He regularly
publishes consumer reports on buying physical silver.
Putting Precious Metals in Your IRA
If you think that paper assets (stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and so on) are
the only things that can sit inside an IRA (Roth or traditional), think again.
Actual physical bullion assets (gold, silver, and/or platinum) can now be part
of your retirement strategies under the tax-advantaged umbrella of your IRA.
Precious metals allowed for IRAs
The following coins are examples of the types of coins that are allowed to be
placed in an IRA:
 American gold, silver, and platinum Eagle Bullion Coins
 Canadian gold, silver, and platinum Maple Leaf Bullion Coins
 Gold, silver, platinum, and palladium bars and rounds manufactured by a
NYMEX or COMEX approved refiner/assayer and meeting minimum fine-
ness requirements. Can be 1,000 oz. or 1,000 oz. bullion bars.
 Other coins that specifically meet the IRS requirements for inclusion.
Here are some types of precious metals investments that are not allowed to
be placed in an IRA:
 Krugerrands (gold bullion coins minted by South Africa)
 Old U.S. Gold numismatic or collectible coins
 U.S. 90% silver coins (1964 and before)
The IRS laws covering precious metals IRAs can change from time to time so

Establishing an account
Get the full details through organizations that have met IRS regulations which
govern retirement accounts. As of June 2007, the following organizations have
been approved for precious metals IRAs:
Sterling Trust Company

The first organization you should contact is the bullion/coin dealer to find
out which of the above companies it works with. Once you know that, con-
tact them directly and find out about the paperwork and fees involved.
The actual ordering of the approved coins and bars will occur through the
dealers and they will work with the IRA firms for logistics such as where 
the bullion is to be shipped for approved storage. The approved storage is 
an important part of the arrangement because without it, you couldn’t have
the precious metals IRA at all.

umismatics. Who thought up that name? Why not call coin collecting . . .
uh . . . coin collecting? And then there’s stamp collecting: philately
(probably from the same re-naming genius). Why stop there? Why not call
wine tasting grapeology or skydiving splat-o-lympics? Anyway, coin collecting . . .
uh . . . numismatics . . . is a great and interesting way to get into precious
metals. Don’t confuse it with bullion coins and bars (as covered in Chapter 10)
since the metal content is only part of the reason that you get into numismatic
coins.
In 2002, a 1933 gold double eagle coin sold for $7.5 million. Whew . . . now
that’s not chump change. But it does attest to the clout of investment-grade
numismatic coins. Rare, high-quality coins can command prices of five, six, or
even seven figures so it certainly pays to consider the power of coins in your
portfolio, especially in an era of growing demand and inflation.
Numismatic coins offer some of the same advantages as other investment
vehicles such as scarcity, liquidity, and appreciation. But another dimension
comes into play; it can be an interesting and absorbing hobby. For years I was
an active numismatist who was initially drawn by the opportunity for long-
term appreciation but came to see the other appealing features of the world 
of coin collecting.

The Basics of Numismatics Coins
Numismatic coins are coins that have achieved value due to their rarity. As
you may recall, bullion coins are primarily acquired for their metal content.
For numismatic coins you need to consider (or be aware of) the following:
 Metal content: This is first only because this is a major consideration in
the book. The major types of precious metals are silver and gold. There
are also other metals as well (base metals such as copper and nickel)
but this is not a factor in the value as is the case with precious metals.
 Rarity: The fewer there are of a particular coin, the greater the potential
value. Many old coins are valuable because of their rarity.
 Grade (or condition): The better the condition, the higher the value.
The grade is a crucial factor in the coin’s value (more on this later in this
chapter).
 Age: This is a relatively minor issue but it is worth listing. All things being
equal, a 100-year-old coin has greater value than a one-year-old coin.
 Popularity: Some coin series are more popular than others. The coin’s
popularity may be attributed to its beauty or historical significance.
 Mint mark: Coins were minted at a variety of minting facilities throughout
U.S. history. A coin in the same year but from a different mint could be
more scarce, hence more valuable.
As you can see, numismatics can be a little bit more complicated than just the
age and/or metal content. Of course if you have an old coin made of a precious
metal such as gold or silver that is in excellent condition and is rare and 
popular then you have a winner!
Profitable coin investing
If you are going to be successful in coin investing (certainly financially success-
ful) there are some golden rules that will enhance your efforts:
 Stick to precious metals: Because of other factors covered in this book
(such as inflation), it will enhance your long-term profitability to stick to
gold and silver coins due to the metals’ appeal for a variety of reasons. As
contemporary coinage becomes more debased (the government is using
cheaper metals to keep coin mintage costs low) that means that more
valuable coins will keep rising in price.
 Specialize: It’s hard to keep track of all the coin series. It is advisable 
to stick to a single popular series (certainly in the beginning anyway)
such as Mercury dimes or Morgan dollars. Get to know the key dates
and grades.
146
Part III: Investing Vehicles 

 Quality: Buy the higher grades since they will fetch a higher price.
Investors will generally look at the uncirculated and proof grades first
(see grading explanations below). Depending on the year and mint, an
uncirculated Morgan silver dollar, for example, could easily be worth
thousands of dollars more than the same coin in Good or Fine condition.
Making the grade
Grading is a reference to the coin’s physical condition. The grading system,
referred to as the Sheldon Scale (see Table 11-1; named after William Sheldon
who standardized coin grading in 1948) is an industry standard that helps
dealers, collectors, and investors find an easier way to determine the coin’s
condition. The Sheldon Scale works on a numeric system ranging from 1 to 70,
with 70 being the highest and most flawless level.

This is the top grade. The coin has a mirror-like look

The grades of MS - 1 to MS - 59 could really be called the collectable grades.
For collectors who are simply seeking to add to or complete their coin collec-
tions, these grades are okay. Because the grades are low, the prices are also
generally low so coins at these levels are affordable.
Those seeking coins with the best potential for investment gain need to con-
cern themselves with the higher grades of MS - 60 to MS - 70. To get a truly
good idea about these investment grades, it’s best to get it from the source,
of course. You can find full descriptions straight from the Fifth Edition of

Collectible Coins
Once you get a good understanding of the coin market and important features
such as the grade (quality) and mintage (quantity), you can choose what coin
series you want to get involved with. In this segment, I won’t cover every series
that is out there since there are lots of coins to deal with. It is important to
stick to those series that have a large, popular market since it will make it
much easier to buy and sell when the time comes.
Gold coins
Although the U.S. Mint (www.usmint.gov) has minted gold bullion coins in
recent years, the last numismatic gold coins were issued in the early 1930s.
One of the most popular gold coins is the $20 Saint-Gaudens coin issued
1907–1933. It is still a very popular coin for collectors and investors and it
serves as the quintessential gold coin. Here are the most popular numismatic
gold coins:
 The $20 Saint Gaudens double eagle
 Liberty head $1 gold
 Liberty capped bust 21⁄2 dollar gold
 Indian 21⁄2 dollar gold
 Indian $5 gold
 Indian $10 gold
By the way, some of the coins are referred to by the designer’s name. The $20
gold double eagle coin was designed by Augustus Saint-Gaudens. Later in this
chapter you see a reference to coins such as the Barber halves. Before you
look for the razor and shaving cream in the design, keep in mind that it is
another reference to a coin designer, Charles E. Barber. Barber designed
many of the coins in the late 1800s.
Silver coins
Silver coins were more prevalent than gold coins and they were in common
circulation until 1964. From the early days of our country’s history to 1964, we
have had silver dimes, quarters, halves and dollar coins. These coins were
90% silver. An exception was Kennedy halves that still contained 40% silver
during 1965–1970. After that, all common coins in circulation were made from
base metals.
149
Chapter 11: Purchasing Numismatic Coins

The most common silver coin series are
 Morgan Silver Dollars (1878–1921)
 Peace Silver Dollars (1921–1935)
 Trade dollars (1873–1885)
 Liberty seated dollars (1836–1873)
 Early silver dollars (1794–1804)
 Franklin Halves (1948–1963)
 Walking liberty halves (1916–1947)
 Barber halves (1892–1915)
 Liberty seated halves (1839–1891)
 Liberty bust halves (1807–1838)
 Early halves (1794–1807)
 Washington silver quarters (1932–1964)
 Standing liberty quarters (1916–1930)
 Barber quarters (1892–1916)
 Liberty seated quarters (1838–1892)
 Draped bust quarters (1796–1838)
 Roosevelt silver dimes (1946–1964)
 Mercury dimes (1916–1945)
 Barber dimes (1892–1916)
 Liberty seated dimes (1837–1891)
 Liberty bust dimes (1796–1837)
To get much more detail on these and other coin series, consult the various
coin resources and publications in this chapter.
Other coins
Beyond gold and silver (there are no platinum numismatic coins, only platinum
bullion coins as in Chapter 10), there is little else in the way of precious metals
for collectible coinage. However, you will find plenty of base metals used.
Copper, zinc, and nickel are common in coinage and there are plenty of choices
here for collecting and investing. Here are the most common collectible series
with base metals:
150
Part III: Investing Vehicles 

 The Lincoln wheat cents (1909–1958)
 Jefferson nickels (1938–present)
 Buffalo nickels (1913–1938)
 Liberty nickels (1883–1913)
 Shield nickels (1866–1883)
 Indian cents (1859–1909)
 Flying eagle cents (1856–1858)
 Large cents (1793–1857)
Keep in mind that even coins with base metals have risen in value very nicely
in recent years. The same things that have a positive impact on precious
metals (such as money supply growth and price inflation, for example) have 
a similar impact on base metals. A good example is the Lincoln wheat cent.
The original Lincoln cent was 100% copper. During World War II, copper was
so necessary for the war effort that Lincoln cents were made primarily with
steel instead of copper temporarily in 1943. In recent years, the price of
copper rose dramatically and in recent years copper is only a miniscule part
of pennies today. The increase in the price of copper was just another reason
for why the older Lincoln cents rose in value.
Still other coins: Commemoratives
One area of the coin world that I don’t want to leave out is commemoratives.
These are not coins in the normal sense; they are not issued for general 
circulation. Every coin that I have written about in this chapter could actually
be used as regular money in that you can use these coins to buy stuff at the
store but . . . please . . . don’t do that! Anyway, commemoratives are just 
that; they commemorate a person, organization or event. Gold and silver
commemoratives are a large market for collectors and investors. Some of 
the same rules apply (such as scarcity, metal content, and grade).
It is important to stay with commemoratives that have a substantial market
so that buying and selling are easier. Stick with quality and with reputable
dealers. For more information, check out the same Web sites and resources
indicated in this chapter. Some sources for information on commemoratives
are the Coin Alley (www.thecoinalley.com) and the U.S. Mint
(www.usmint.gov).

Chapter 11: Purchasing Numismatic Coins

Coin Services and Organizations
If you are serious about numismatics as a long-term investment vehicle, then
it pays to join one or more of the organizations in this specialized area. As
you will find out, numismatic coins are more complicated than bullion coins
and you need to keep informed. The first place to start is the associations:
 American Numismatic Association (ANA; www.money.org)
 The American Numismatic Society (ANS; www.amnumsoc.org)
 Professional Numismatists Guild (PNG; www.pngdealers.com)
The associations provide a lot of information and guidance to collectors and
investors. Member benefits usually include newsletters, books, and confer-
ences. Meeting other members is easy and you can quickly get information
from others on the particular coins that you are focusing on. Speak to experi-
enced members and ask a lot of questions about grading, mintage, rarity, 
selling tips, and so on.
Information sharing
Besides the associations, the Internet has another venue for you to meet
folks and exchange opinions and information on numismatics. Use your
favorite search engine to find newsgroups. Some of the more active ones are
Coin Forum (www.coinforum.org) and Coin Talk Forum
(www.cointalk.org).
Grading services
Because grading can be such a touchy and delicate matter — a single level 
difference in grade could mean thousands of dollars — it is recommended that
you consult a grading certification service. A reliable grading certification
service is crucial whether you are buying or selling your coin. The service can
not only certify the grade of the coin, but also authenticate it as well. The 
following are the major coin grading services in the industry:
 Numismatic Guaranty Corporation (NGC; www.ngccoin.com)
 Professional Coin Grading Service (www.pcgs.com)
 American Numismatic Association Coin Service (www.anacs.com)
 Independent Coin Grading Company (www.icgcoin.com)
152
Part III: Investing Vehicles 

Generally they will request that you fill out their form and send it in with the
coin(s) and their fee. Depending on how busy they are, expect to receive
your coin back with their certification in several weeks or longer. Here are
some questions that you should consider asking right after “How much does
it cost?” and “When will my coin collection be worth a million bucks?” . . . 
 How many years have you been grading and authenticating coins?
 Does your firm offer a guarantee in your grading and authenticity service?
 What type of holders (containers) do you use to safeguard the coins?
 What grading standard do you use?
 What established dealer or collector groups use your services?
 Where do your firm’s certified items trade (auctions and so on)?
 What’s the capital of Bolivia?
Selling Your Coins
Understanding what you are buying is important but what better way to end
the chapter than understanding selling your coins. After all, the whole point
of buying collectable coins (at least from an investment perspective in this
book) is to gain by selling it at a higher price later on. For maximum invest-
ment gain, it is best to hold your coins long-term to give them adequate time
to appreciate in value. Coins are not really appropriate as tradeable vehicles.
Keep in mind that to achieve maximum gains with your coins, the issue isn’t
just when to sell (again, later is better than sooner). It is also important to
understand whom you sell to.
Back to dealers
The most convenient way to cash in your coin investments is to sell to a coin
dealer. The reputable ones are members of the long-standing organizations
such as the Professional Numismatists Guild and you shouldn’t have a prob-
lem making a fast and efficient sale. However, keep in mind that what you are
seeking to get paid is not the same as what dealers are willing to pay.
I’m sure that after you poured over all the price listings in coin publications
you have a preconceived idea of what your coins are worth. Keep in mind that
you are probably looking for the retail price while the dealers are only looking
to pay a wholesale price. Oh sure, you read the dealer’s ad stating “We pay the
153
Chapter 11: Purchasing Numismatic Coins

highest prices in the industry” and it may even be 100% true but in reality the
point is highest wholesale prices. Dealers are in business and they need to
make a profit to stay in business. If you think that the value of your coin
should be, say, $100 (that’s what you saw in those coin publications) then the
amount you will likely be offered will be in the $50 to $65 range. This is why
you should consider your coins to be a long-term investment to give them
enough time to appreciate. The difference will mean another 30% to 40% in 
the price to cover the difference between wholesale and retail.
Of course, if the coins you are seeking to sell were found in your attic or
inherited, then the wholesale/retail price difference may not mean much to
you since your purchase price was effectively zero.
Dealers will generally pay a wholesale rate for your coins. Therefore, if you are
settling for dealers to make a fast and convenient sale, call several dealers to
size up the offers.
To other investors
If you want to gain a higher price, then it may behoove you to skip past the
middleman and go straight to the buyer . . . another investor. You may say
“great! The heck with the dealer . . . I’ll go direct to the buyer and get more
money!” Here is where you discover the trade-off. If you want to realize more
money from the sale of your coins, then you’ll need to put in the time, effort,
and diligence. Realizing a higher price entails more marketing and sales
efforts on your part.
You can find coin investors in a variety of places and the Internet makes 
it easier to locate would-be buyers. There are numismatic clubs and chat
rooms. There are markets for buyers and sellers of coins at Web sites such as
www.allcoins.com. You can also go to coin shows and conferences (there
are sites such as www.coinshows.com).
Selling directly to individuals will be easier if you get your coins certified.
Investors are more apt to make a deal with you if a credible organization (see
the grading services above) has certified the coin and its condition and
authenticity.
eBay and other auctions
Online auctions are one of the most active areas of the Internet. Unless
you’ve been spelunking (a weird word that means exploring caves) for the
154
Part III: Investing Vehicles 

past dozen years, you’ve heard of eBay (www.ebay.com). It is, of course, the
premier online auction site and lots of coins are bought and sold there regu-
larly. There are lots of great information sources on how to buy and sell on
eBay and it’s the first place to look when you are considering selling your
stuff online.
eBay is a horizontal auction site which means everyone sells all sorts of stuff
to everyone else. If you can’t sell your coins on eBay then consider finding a
vertical auction site. This type of auction site means the buying and selling
are in a narrow niche or specialty. There are auction sites that specialize in
coins. You can find these sites by utilizing a major search engine (or you can
go to a comprehensive site such as www.internetauctionlist.com).
Also keep in mind that there are dealers and auctions that do consignment
sales. Consignment means that you sell your item through a sales agent but
you still retain ownership of the item until the sale is made.
Here are some of the major coin auction Web sites:
 Bowers and Merena (www.bowersandmerena.com)
 Heritage Auction Galleries (www.coins.ha.com)
 Teletrade (www.teletrade.com)
 R.M. Smythe & Company (www.smytheonline.com)
Pricing information
Whether you are buying or selling, the price is everything. You shop around 
if you are going to buy. If you are going to sell, you need to verify with reliable
sources regarding the market value of your coin(s). The following sources
have pricing information that can help.
 Numismedia Fair Market Value Price Guide (www.numismedia.com)
 Coin Universe Price Guide (www.coinuniverse.com)
 Coin Net (www.coinnet.com)
A book that achieved renown as the bible for coin prices and values is the
Red Book. The full title is The Official Red Book: A Guide Book of United States
Coins. It is inexpensive and compact. Although it gets updated annually, that’s
enough. Coin values are not that volatile so an annual book is sufficient for
most folks.
155
Chapter 11: Purchasing Numismatic Coins

One final note . . . 
Last but not least . . . check your pocket change everyday. You’d be surprised
by what you can find that has greater value than you think. Many years ago
when I was a kid, I went into a bank and gave them twenty bucks and asked
for some rolls of halves. Being a coin collector and a hunter I always checked
my change and even went to the bank to check their change, too! In those
rolls of half-dollar coins, I was delighted to find over half of the coins were
Kennedy 40% silver halves. Even today, you can still spot the occasional
silver dime or wheat cent. It’s like finding real money.

A
h yes . . . stocks. My old stomping grounds (shameless plug here for
Stock Investing For Dummies)! Well . . . I still stomp here in my daily 
professional activities so you know why I’m misty-eyed about the topic. In
this chapter, I get to give you a summary of some of my favorite (and most
essential) stock investing points but also get to customize it for the world of
precious (and base) metals. Some of your greatest profits (and risks) will be
in mining stocks. For most investors, mining stocks are the easiest way to
participate in precious metals investing and speculating.
Before we get to the information relevant for mining stocks, it will be useful
for you to get some important points on stock investing.
Essential Stock Investing 101
I love stock investing. It is an appropriate venue for most investors and specu-
lators. The act of buying and selling stock is easier and more widespread than
ever before. What isn’t easier is the act of choosing which stocks to initially
buy. Successful stock investing isn’t just understanding stocks . . . it’s also
understanding yourself and your goals. There are different kinds of investors
just as there are different kinds of stocks. Before you get to the specific area 
of mining stocks, it is important to summarize what to look for in stocks 
in general.

Stock investing for all
The whole point of stocks is to choose one that has the greatest chance of
having a rising share value. We all want to buy a $3 stock and sell it later on
for $257 per share or better. But . . . how would you proceed to accomplish
such a feat? What would make a stock rise so much?
Buying a stock is essentially buying a piece of a company and its potential for
profit and growth. If the company does well, ultimately the price of the stock
attached to it will rise. If the company does poorly, ultimately the stock will go
down. Why would the stock go up (or down)? Always keep in mind that the
real force that moves the price of the stock up or down is the marketplace.
The marketplace is composed of buyers and sellers that are individuals and
organizations. If there are more buyers (versus sellers) of a stock, then it will
go up. If there are more sellers (than buyers) then the stock price will go
down. The buying and selling goes on in stock exchanges such as the New
York Stock Exchange (www.nyse.com) and places that are not technically
exchanges such as Nasdaq (www.nasdaq.com). For you to conduct your
stock transactions, you would need a stock brokerage account.
Why does anyone buy a stock? Of course, we can say the obvious, that you
buy a stock because you think that the stock’s price will go up and you can
sell it later at a profit (capital gain). So the primary reason the public buys 
a stock is for gain. The second reason a stock is bought is for income (divi-
dends). Ultimately, the stock and its performance will be based on the com-
pany’s performance as measured by sales and profits. It seems like a pretty
logical process: Find a company with strong prospects and potential success
and the stock attached to it will rise and you will profit. Not so fast . . . 
Sometimes you will see Company A doing well and being profitable yet the
stock’s price go down. Or you may see Company B doing poorly and losing
money and yet . . . its stock rises. It makes you scratch your head. What
gives? I can boil down to one word why anyone buys a stock: expectation.
When you see the stock of a profitable company go down, it is obvious that
there were more sellers than buyers . . . but why? The answer is that stocks
don’t go up and down because of how well (or how poorly) a company is
doing presently; they go up or down because of what buyers or sellers expect
will happen with that company in the near future.
Understand that the behavior of a stock in the short-term is irrational; the
stock’s price will behave in ways that are seemingly crazy and illogical.
However, the performance of the company and the performance of the stock
over the longer term do become a logical relationship. Long term, solid, prof-
itable companies have rising stock prices while poorly run, unprofitable com-
panies have declining stock prices. The lesson to investors is that trying to
158
Part III: Investing Vehicles 

make short-term profits in their stock investing approach is a gamble (it is
speculating) while making money is easier when you are patient and focused
on the longer term. Sooner or later, the market figures it out. Good companies
whose share prices have gone down in the short-term become a buying oppor-
tunity. Bad companies whose share prices have gone up in the short-term give
you the opportunity to unload the shares.
The bottom line is to not worry about the short-term gyrations of the stock.
Instead, focus your time and effort in finding companies that are strong, well-
positioned in the right industries, and have solid fundamentals (good products
or services, growing industry, rising sales, increasing profits, and so on). Let’s
focus on some of those fundamentals, such as . . . 
A growing industry
Ever heard the expression a rising tide lifts all boats? Well . . . before you go
buy a yacht, think over what that really means for your stock portfolio. Having
tracked the stock market over the past few decades, I’ve seen it over and over
again. I’ve seen the stocks of mediocre companies go up because they are in 
a strong and growing industry. And of course I’ve seen the reverse. Picking a
stock doesn’t happen in a vacuum. Understanding and being aware of that
company’s industry and the overall economic environment is critical to stock
picking success. Sometimes I think that the industry and overall economy
matter more than the company itself. I have avoided good companies because
I expected their industry to experience tough times. I also had no problem
buying shares of average or below-average companies that were in hot 
industries. You will also find out that figuring out the general direction of the
industry is easier than for the individual company.
Become very proficient and knowledgeable on an industry that has good
growth prospects. Real time (summer 2007), I am telling my clients and 
students the following . . .
For conservative investors, consider consumer staples such as food, 
beverages, utilities, and established companies in energy and natural
resources.
For aggressive investors and speculators, consider energy, alternative
energy (such as uranium, solar, and so on), and natural resources such 
as . . . precious metals! (You must have seen that one coming.)
Go do your research at a well-stocked business library or on the Internet at
Web sites such as:
 Market Watch (www.marketwatch.com)
 Bloomberg (www.bloomberg.com)
159
Chapter 12: Mining Stocks

A profitable company
What insightful advice: choose a company that’s profitable! Well this point 
is not as obvious as it sounds. There have been many companies that were
unprofitable whose stock rose dramatically. There’s nothing wrong in buying
the stock of a company that is losing money. But . . . if you do that, you’re 
not investing, you’re speculating. Investing means that you are putting your
money into assets (stock, bonds, gold, and so on) that have provable value
and that you understand how the investment works and that it is appropriate
for you and your financial objectives.
Speculating is a different animal altogether. Speculating is a form of financial
gambling. Now that may be too extreme a definition since speculating is a bit
more complicated than tossing some dice at a casino table. However, the
essence of the transaction is an educated guess. In speculating, the payoff
could be big and fast. However, the potential loss could be equally big and
fast. You should only speculate with a relatively small portion of your total
finances. I personally enjoy speculating and I do a lot of it but I still keep the
bulk of my money in more stable, predictable venues such as conservative
stocks, cash, and so on.
Back to profitability. Profit is important. Actually, profit is the most important
part of the company’s total financial picture. It is profit that is the lifeblood of
the company; profit is the engine of growth for innovation, jobs, and so on. I’ll
take it a step further; profit is the lifeblood of a successful economy. You
show me an economy where profit is abolished and I’ll show you an economy
that either has or will collapse. It’s true for the company as well. How do you
find out about the company’s profitability?
The profit is also expressed as net earnings, net gain, and net income. It is the
end result in the company’s income statement (sales less expenses equals
net profit or net loss) which can be found in a number of places. The income
statement (also called the P&L statement or profit-and-loss statement) can be
found in the company’s annual report or Web site. In addition, it is part of the
financial statements that are made available at other venues such as at the
Securities and Exchange Commission (go to www.SEC.gov and use the
agency’s EDGAR database to locate any public company’s public filings) and
many financial Web sites such as Market Watch, and so on.
As a general rule of thumb, investors should look at how profitable the 
company has been in the most recent three consecutive years. You want to
see consistent profits and it is preferable that the profits are at least 10% 
(or more) higher than the year before.
160
Part III: Investing Vehicles 

In addition, you want to see rising sales in conjunction with those rising 
profits. Total sales should be consistently rising year-over-year (again, I like
to use an easy benchmark like 10% or more).
Low debt? High assets?
The next thing to look at is the company’s balance sheet. It is simply a snap-
shot at a point in time showing what the company owns and what it owes. It
is expressed as assets minus liabilities equals shareholders’ equity (or net
assets or net worth). A company’s financial statements are not that difficult
to figure out since there is a lot of similarity to your financial picture. You 
personally have a budget and you need to track your income and outgo (just
like a corporate income statement). You track what you own and what you
owe (again, just like a corporate balance sheet). Look for a few things that are
key to the company’s financial health:
 Is the company’s net worth growing every year? Each year should be
at least 10% higher than the year before (preferably more).
 Are assets increasing? The more it owns, the better.
 Are its debts stable, low and/or decreasing? The less it owes, the better.
See . . . that wasn’t so bad! Yes, there’s always more to know but if you get 
the major numbers right, you’ll be almost home free. Now, one more thing
regarding the numbers . . .
Some ratios give you perspective
You need to take a close look at an intimate relationship. No . . . don’t go
peering into your neighbor’s window . . . I mean the company’s numbers! I am
talking about ratios that help you analyze a company’s finances to get a clear
picture of the company’s financial health. Here are some ratios that are 
critical for your analysis:
 Price-to-earnings ratio (PE): This is based on a per-share basis. You divide
the price of a share price by the net earnings per share. The PE ratio
establishes a connection between the share price and the company’s
bottom line. All things being equal, a relatively low PE ratio (under 15) is
considered safer than a relatively high PE (over 30). Large, stable compa-
nies tend to have low PE ratios. Small, speculative companies tend to 
have very high PE ratios (some are over 100, sometimes way over!) which
indicates greater risk. Companies with no PE ratio are the riskiest. (They
have a share price but have no earnings or have losses, therefore no 
PE ratio.)
161
Chapter 12: Mining Stocks

 Debt-to-asset ratio (DA): This ratio puts the company’s total debt (or
total liabilities) and total assets in perspective. For example, a company
with total debt of $1 million and total assets of $2 million has a .50 DA
ratio. In other words, the company has 50 cents of total debt for every
dollar of assets. A DA ratio of .50 or less is desirable. A DA higher than
1.0 indicates a debt load that is too high and it could cause the company
problems, especially if the economy is slowing down.
 Comparative year ratios: This is simple. You compare the important line
items of one year to the prior year. If total sales this year are $15 million
and last year they were $10 million, your sales are 50% higher. You do
the same calculation with net earnings and with the important numbers
on the balance sheet (such as the net equity).
There are excellent Web sites with information for beginners looking for
explanations regarding ratios and other financial terms. Check out
www.investorwords.com and the glossary at www.investopedia.com.

That went by fast. There was so much I couldn’t squeeze in but I do hope you
continue reading up on stock investing; it can only help you. Here are some
great places to turn to:
 Value line: Most business libraries have their excellent publications and
you can check out the Web site of the same name.
 Standard & Poor’s: Ditto.
 The stock exchanges have great resources, glossaries, and even some
tutorials on stock investing. Go to

 Yahoo! Finance has lots of investing information and stock market data.
Mining stocks 101
The points above are indeed a mini-crash course in stock investing (“Paul,
don’t use the word crash in a stock investing chapter!”) so it doesn’t do the 
full justice to such a great topic so do catch up with other books. I mention
the book Stock Investing For Dummies as a resource not because I wrote it but
because it has all the important things that I think budding investors should
know about. With that caveat and setting aside the basics of stocks in general,
let’s take a closer look the heart-and-soul of this chapter, the mining stocks.
162
Part III: Investing Vehicles 

It’s all mine
Why do you buy the stock of a gold mining stock? How about a silver mining
stock? Or any stock of any company involved primarily or exclusively in nat-
ural resources? It’s what they have. It pays for you to find out about their
properties and find out about their provable reserves. It can tell you if the
stock’s price is undervalued or overvalued.
Here’s an example. I know of one silver mining company that was recently
priced at $37 per share. Yet the company has in provable reserves over one
billion ounces of silver in its properties. With silver at $13 an ounce, it means
that its total silver reserves are valued at $13 billion. When you divide the
company’s total shares into that number, the company would be worth on a
silver per share basis of over $200 a share. If you can buy a stock for $37 that
is actually worth at least $200, then you have an undervalued stock. Always
find out the total value of the metal/mineral reserves since that will give you
a strong idea of the company’s potential worth, especially in a bull market.
Management that you can dig
The management team should be loaded with mining professionals with 
at least a decade or more of industry experience. This is information that is
usually readily available at the company Web site or industry Who’s Who
directories. They should have had successful top-management positions with
prominent, recognizable mining companies in their career. Professionals that
lead mid-size companies and/or have developed a track record of successful
mining projects/properties are also desirable.
Using bucks to find ounces
Companies are already producers, majors or top tier companies should
already be profitable, and there’s no reason you can’t find companies with
the financial parameters covered in this chapter.
Smaller companies such as explorers and early stage drillers do not necessar-
ily have to have a profit to be considered but financing is important. For them,
analyze their financial statements to determine what cash they have on hand
and what type of cash flow they generate. They don’t necessarily need to be
producing a profit now (remember . . . this is speculating) but they need to be
involved in projects that will produce a profitable payoff later on.
Politics — Not in my backyard
Where the company’s mining properties are located (the political jurisdic-
tion) is very important. On the global scene, lots of mining is being done in
countries that have an unfriendly or hostile political climate. Many mining
firms were victimized by socialist or authoritarian governments that changed
163
Chapter 12: Mining Stocks

the rules on them. Some of these dictators imposed draconian steps such as
arbitrarily raising taxes to exorbitant levels or just outright confiscating the
mining company’s property (a practice referred to as nationalizing). This can
be dangerous for the mining company and, of course, the shareholders as
well. There are companies that have seen their stock fall by 50% or more in a
single day!
Investors need to keep informed about the politics involved. They need to ask
what countries are risky and does the company have much exposure there.
Political risk is very real but investors and speculators can add a measure of
safety by making sure that they invest in companies that predominantly (or
exclusively) are in mining-friendly jurisdictions such as the U.S., Canada,
Australia, Mexico, and a few other countries. More about political risks in
Chapter 19.
Mining Stocks — Digging Deep
The world of mining stocks is very varied. There are choices that are conser-
vative as well as aggressive. There are some that are appropriate for the
stodgy investor as well for the firebrand speculator. You just need to know
the difference.
Mix and match
Diversifying is more that just buying a bunch of different stocks. In the world
of precious metals, it is more than just a bunch of different mining stocks. It
also means understanding yourself and your goals, and being aware of the
different kinds of mining stocks. You’ll read about the three basic categories
of stocks. From an investor’s point of view, you can reasonably assume that
the first category (the majors) is conservative, the second is growth (the
mid-tier, development companies), and the third is speculative (exploratory
companies). Depending on the amount you are willing to invest/speculate
with, consider 5 to 15 companies across the categories. If you are conserva-
tive then by all means have more of your choices tipped in favor of the
majors and the development companies.
If you put 100% of your portfolio money into mining then you are getting too
speculative so it’s a safer idea to have a large portion of your money elsewhere,
such as energy, consumer staples, and so on.
164
Part III: Investing Vehicles 

The majors
Among mining stocks, this is the safest bet. Besides the fact that they are
large companies, they are producing companies. This means that the
metals/minerals are already being extracted from producing properties and
being sold.
Some examples of large gold mining companies that are producers are
Newmont Mining (NEM), Anglogold Ashanti (AU), Freeport McMoran (FCX),
and Barrick Gold (ABX). Although they are referred to as gold mining compa-
nies, they do mine in the course of their business other metals/minerals that
are found in the same mines.
There are fewer primary silver producers but among the major ones are Pan
American Silver (PAAS), Apex Mining (SIL), and Coeur D’Alene Mines (CDE). I
could probably include a mining stock that is referred to as a land bank, which
is Silver Standard (SSRI). A company referred to as a land bank means that it
has properties with provable reserves but hasn’t mined them. The potential is
to ultimately either sell the property to a producer or development company
or lease it to others for mining purposes.
The large producers are listed on the major stock exchanges and you can 
find them and other mining companies at the stock exchange’s Web site and 
do a key word search. In addition, Web sites such as Yahoo! have great stock
screening tools that let you find stocks by industry, size (such as market 
capitalization), and key word.
This top tier is the most appropriate category for conservative investors 
considering precious metals for their stock portfolios.
Development companies
This category is also referred to as the mid-size or mid-tier companies. They
may very well have producing properties but they are primarily developers.
They may even do some exploratory activity. Some mature into producing
companies. Some examples include Gold Corporation (GG), Agnico-Eagle
Mines (AEM), and SeaBridge (SA). They may operate properties that have
proven reserves that they are ready to take into the production phase.
This middle category is appropriate for growth-oriented investors. It can be
aggressive but not as speculative as the lower tier of small miners.
165
Chapter 12: Mining Stocks

Eureka! Exploratory companies
This is the category for those looking for the home run. The problem is that
you get lots of strikeouts too. In this category you have the smaller compa-
nies that are drilling and exploring on properties that may or may not prove
to be valuable. This becomes the crapshoot for those who want to speculate.
It’s important to look for companies (and management) that have a proven
record for successful projects.
Unless you have the contacts and the time to do exhaustive research (like visit-
ing the companies and their properties) it is best to get the guidance of experts
who extensively cover this corner of the mining world. Some names that come
to mind are Jay Taylor, Doug Casey, David Morgan, and Lawrence Roulston.
These individuals have newsletters and Web sites so they are easy to find on
the Internet, but more importantly they have a long track record and the 
experience necessary to help speculators in the world of precious metals.
Ancillary companies
Mining is more than just gold, silver, and platinum. It is also more than just
U.S. companies. Check out some other places for your money to diversify
your portfolio. Consider
 Conglomerates: These are mining firms that have diversified properties
(with different metals) in diversified locations (different countries). Rio
Tinto, BHP Billiton, and Xstrata are good examples of diversified firms
that don’t put all their metal eggs in one mining basket.
 Base metals companies: There’s money to be made beyond precious
metals. As the global economy keeps growing, the demand for base
metals will grow as well. There are profitable companies mining copper,
nickel, zinc, aluminum, and other base metals.
 International opportunities: Due to globalization, many mining compa-
nies based in resource-rich countries such as Canada and Australia are
available to U.S. investors through your brokerage account.
Getting Down to the Nitty-Gritty
Every industry has specialized concerns and the mining industry is no 
different. The followings sections provide you with some points to ponder.

Part III: Investing Vehicles 

The upside to mining stocks
The bulk of the upside to mining stocks is certainly focused on capital gains. A
solid, well-managed company that owns a portfolio of properties with precious
metals in a natural resource bull market means achieving fabulous gains that
can be legendary. History teaches the best lessons here. Gold and silver mining
companies from the late 1970s still count among the greatest percentage 
gainers in stock market history.
Why? For investors, the secret is that mining stocks offer leverage. If you
bought gold at $400 and it gets to $600, you would make a simple investment
return of 50%. But what if you took that $400 and bought 100 shares of a $4
gold exploration company? Say it discovers a rich vein of gold at its drilling
site that has 2 million ounces of gold. The odds are good that the company’s
stock price would rise far beyond 50%. That $4 stock could easily double or
triple or much more. What if gold goes to $700? $1,000? What would that
stock be worth then? You get the picture.
The risks of mining stocks
Any company can run into problems. If you have followed the financials at 
all in recent years you get a good idea. Most companies go bankrupt for a
variety of reasons with the #1 reason always being: not enough money.
Among the surviving companies, you can run across lots of rough patches
such as economic slowdowns, regulatory problems, too much debt, not
enough sales, lawsuits, yadda yadda. This you knew. But every industry or
sector has unique negatives and positives as part of the territory. You know
about the positive stuff (that’s what drew you to begin with). But for the sake
of completeness, here’s a rundown of pitfalls in the mining industry:
 Mineworkers strike
 Inflationary production costs
 Rising costs of raw materials and energy
 Regulatory changes
 Environmental problems (regulations, protestors, and so on)
 Mining accidents
 Political changes/upheaval (especially in unfriendly countries)
If you have a mining stock and you are concerned about its prospects or
unsure about economic conditions facing your stock, consider making some
defensive moves. Here are some considerations . . .
167
Chapter 12: Mining Stocks

 Protective put: This strategy means buying a put on your stock. It
becomes a cheap form of insurance. Get more information on puts in
Chapter 15.
 Stop-loss orders: If your stock is at $20 per share, consider putting a stop-
loss order at a price of, say, $15 and make it a GTC (good-’til-cancelled)
order. If the stock rises, you can cancel your stop-loss order and replace it
with a new stop-loss order at a higher price. Your brokerage firm can give
you more details about this.
Mining properties
At the crux of the mining company’s success is the property to be mined and
how productive that property is. A company will either refer to a property’s
resources or its reserves. There is a crucial difference. When a property has
resources that means it may have metals/minerals in the ground but it is not
confirmed about the quality and quantity. Reserves is a higher standard.
Extensive and reliable testing took place and the company is assured of the
quantity and quality of the metals/minerals in the property. The bottom line
here is you want to be sure the company has reserves.
When you are researching the company, here are the types of properties that
are most desirable:
 Producing properties: Properties where high-grade deposits are being
mined and the metal is extracted and sold.
 Development properties: This property has proven and extractable
reserves verified by a reliable feasibility study.
 Pre-development properties: Preliminary drilling indicates it has
reserves and is ready for a feasibility study.
Any other type of property is purely speculative. If it’s referred to as dormant,
dead, or speculative, then you are better off leaving it to a man named Jed
Clampett and just moving. However, remember that the locations of these
properties are very important so read the section entitled “Politics — Not in
my backyard,” earlier in this chapter.
Hedging practices
Although the general practice of hedging is an honorable one and very neces-
sary for those of us who seek to minimize risk in our portfolios, it is quite a
different animal in the mining industry. It can be in fact, a dangerous practice.
168
Part III: Investing Vehicles 

Hedging is a practice in the mining industry whereby a mining firm sells, say,
next year’s mine production this year to lock in a price. Presume that Gopher
Gold Corp. sells 1 million ounces of gold today that will be mined next year
(also referred to as forward selling). Say that today we sell that gold for $600
per oz., which means we generate current income of $600 million. Some
miners do this to lock in income today without worrying about next year’s
production. Of course, Gopher Gold will have to go to the expense and effort
next year to cough up those million ounces of gold that will be due to those
folks who paid way in advance. If gold stays at $600 or goes down, then these
forward sales look like a smart move. But . . . what if gold goes up?
If gold goes up to $690 an ounce, you have now forgone potential profits of
$90 million. Hedging or forward sales are dangerous in a rising market. There
have been mining companies that went bankrupt due to excessive hedging.
Understand that for a mining company, significant hedging is tantamount to
betting against your own asset. This is why many mining analysts prefer
unhedged mining companies because in the event the underlying asset (gold,
silver, and so on) is rising, the company (and the shareholders) get to fully
participate on the upside. Can you visualize that lone protester at the annual
shareholders meeting shouting hedging is for gardeners!?
Resources
Because mining stocks can be a specialized area, you need ongoing information
and analysis from reliable sources. Here are some of my favorites:

Chapter 12: Mining Stocks

Boosting Your Returns
Merely buying and holding mining stocks for future capital gain can be 
profitable but you can find ways to boost the profitability in your portfolio
and squeeze more return on your investment.
Generating income
Until your mining stocks go through the roof ‘cause gold zoomed to $3,000 an
ounce and the other metals hit nose-bleed territory, you can do something to
make more money on your portfolio. The following sections show you a few
ways to do it.
Dividends
Normally, mining stocks are not considered income stocks. An income stock
refers to a stock that pays dividends greater than the average stock. Lately
this means a dividend yielding 4% or higher. Most mining stocks are not
income stocks but there are some that issue regular dividends. Some of the
large firms do provide a regular dividend (such as Newmont Mining and Gold
Corp.). Also, just because the stock has a low dividend, that doesn’t mean
that it stays there. As company revenues grow, the dividend tends to grow as
well. Studies have shown that dividends rise faster than the rate of inflation.
That’s another plus for long-term investors.
In addition, during the heydays of gold mining stocks (the late 1970s), many
in fact issued dividends that very briefly qualified them as high-income
stocks. Should gold and other precious metals hit new highs in the coming
years then it is very possible that some high dividends can be paid again.
Stay tuned!
Writing covered calls
A very easy way to generate income from a portfolio of mining stocks is to
write covered calls on your stocks. It is in fact not difficult to safely generate
income through this specific strategy of 10% to 20%. Imagine getting income
that could be four or five (or more) times greater than a bond or certificate 
of deposit starting with a mining stock that issues no dividend! It’s like being
in the twilight zone. Aside from the usual risk of stock investing, covered 
call-writing is virtually risk-free. To get more information regarding this
income-generating approach, look up covered call-writing in Chapter 15.

Leveraging with warrants
Warrants can be an unusual security and most investors are not familiar with
them. Technically, they trade like stock (bought and sold like stocks covered
in this chapter) but essentially they work like options (covered in Chapter 15).
Sooo . . . they warrant coverage here.
A warrant is a financial vehicle that gives the investor the right, but not 
the obligation, to buy the underlying security (usually common stock) at a
specific price during the life of the warrant. A warrant is a wasting asset which
means that it will expire on a specific date in the future. However, usually war-
rants have a long shelf life; freshly issued warrants could expire in as little as
two years or as long as five years (or longer). You can say that a warrant can
be a hybrid of both a stock and an option. Warrants can be private financial
instruments but of course there are many that are publicly traded.
The holder of a warrant (much like the holder or buyer of an option) can exer-
cise the warrant to buy the underlying security but what you can buy differs
somewhat with the option. When you buy the typical option, a single option
contract represents 100 shares of that particular stock (or ETF). A 2 option
contracts means 200 shares and so on. A warrant, on the other hand, is not
rigidly standardized the way publicly traded options are.
A typical warrant would have a ratio of one warrant to one share of stock. In
other words, if you have 100 warrants of Groundhog Mining Co., this gives
you the ability to purchase 100 shares of Groundhog Mining’s stock. However,
there are plenty of options that are not so cut and dry. There are warrants
where the ratio is 1 warrant to 2 shares of stock or to 1 share of common
stock and 1 share of preferred stock and so on. Check with the issuer of the
warrant (in this case, Groundhog Mining) or the company’s shareholder 
service department.
Before you invest in warrants, get the full details. The most common place 
to find publicly traded warrants is Nasdaq’s Over-The-Counter (OTC) small
company market, and information can be found at the OTC Bulletin Board
(OTCBB; its Web site is www.otcbb.com). Don’t invest in a warrant just
because it’s available. Instead, do your research on mining stocks and then
contact the company’s shareholder service department and ask if that partic-
ular company has or will issue warrants. Frequently, the details are available
at the company’s Web site.
Keep in mind that you can also find warrants at the New York Stock Exchange
(www.nyse.com) and the American Stock Exchange (www.amex.com), but
your most successful searches for metals and mining-related warrants will
171
Chapter 12: Mining Stocks

most likely be at the OTCBB and some international exchanges. Some obvious
ones will be in Canada, such as the Vancouver Stock Exchange and the Toronto
Stock Exchange. Fortunately, many foreign stocks and warrants do trade on the
OTCBB. At the OTCBB, you will notice that foreign securities will be assigned a
fifth letter in their symbol, the letter “f,” to signify a foreign security.
How profitable can a warrant be? Let me give you a real-life example of how
the warrant can work. Silver Wheaton (SLW) is a great example of a major
silver mining firm (please don’t take this as advice; it is purely an educational
example) that also has warrants. One of its warrants (symbol: SLWBF found
at the OTCBB site) gives you the ability to buy SLW at $10 per share until the
expiration date in late 2010. In late-April 2007, you could have bought SLW for
$10 per share and you could have gotten the warrant SLWBF for about $4.50
per warrant. By mid-July, SLW hit $14 while the warrant hit $7.30. How did
you fare? During that very brief period (about 3 months), the stock rose 40%
while in that same time frame, the warrant went up 62%.
On an annualized return basis, the stock SLW in that time frame shot up 160%
while the warrant went up an eye-popping 249%. If a stock doubles or triples
(higher?) then the corresponding warrants would perform even more spec-
tacularly. For aggressive investors and speculators that definitely warrants
attention.
Another thing that warrants attention is the risk. If the company’s stock falls,
then the warrant’s price would fall and it would likely fall more so. Remember
that a warrant (like an option) is a derivative. It is a fancy term which is essen-
tially very simple. A derivative means that this particular financial vehicle or
instrument derives its value from something else, the underlying asset.
A warrant or option on Groundhog Mining Corporation would derive its value
from the price and performance of Groundhog’s common stock. Actually, when
you think about, its common stock is a derivative too; it derives its value from
the operations, assets, and profitability of the company itself. Stretching it a bit
further, a gold mining company would derive its value from the value of the
gold it owned or controlled. All right . . . I’ll stop at this point before you derive
a headache (aspirin is a derivative of tree bark). The bottom line is that you
wouldn’t analyze the warrant to understand its potential; you would analyze
the underlying asset (the company and the metals involved).
Lastly, the most important risk with warrants is the major risk that is also
present with options; they can expire worthless. You must do something with
them before they expire (such as sell them or acquire the underlying secu-
rity). Fortunately, unlike most options, warrants do have a long shelf life and
that longer time frame does make them less speculative in comparison.
172
Part III: Investing Vehicles 

There are very few sources of information on warrants but one that I like is
Dudley Baker’s Web site at www.preciousmetalswarrants.com. Discuss
warrants with your financial advisor. I wouldn’t be surprised if you end up
educating him or her about the topic!
Indexes
Indexes give us a great snapshot of the broad market or of a specific market,
industry, or sector. 
If you want to invest or speculate on the indexes, you can do it through
exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and/or through options. For investors, there
are ETFs that closely mirror or track indexes. You can find more information
on ETFs in Chapter 13. For speculators and experienced investors, consider
options on the indexes (see Chapter 15 regarding the world of options).
Further, there are options on ETFs as well. Man . . . are there choices or what?
This is cool stuff . . .
I cover the most widely followed indexes in the following list:
 PHLX Gold/Silver Sector Index (XAU): This is a capitalization-weighted
index created and maintained by the Philadelphia Stock Exchange
(www.phlx.com). Their index, the Philadelphia Gold/Silver Sector Index
(XAU), is the broadest index of the gold and silver mining sector.
 Amex Gold Bugs Index (HUI): I like this name; gold bugs is a reference to
those folks who are very enthusiastic about gold and its prospects. This
index is called that because it includes only mining stocks that do not
hedge (see segment on hedging earlier in this chapter). To be unhedged
in gold production is to be very bullish in gold. The American Stock
Exchange (Amex)’s Gold BUGS Index (HUI) is a modified equal dollar
weighted index of companies involved in gold mining. To find out more
about the HUI, go to Amex’s Web site at www.amex.com.
 Amex Gold Miners Index (GDM): This index is not as widely followed 
as the XAU or HUI but it is an important index for precious metals
investors. The Amex Gold Miners Index (GDM) is a modified market 
capitalization weighted index comprised of publicly traded companies
involved primarily in the mining for gold and silver. The Index divisor
was initially determined to yield a benchmark value of 500.00 starting 
in December 2002.

Investing in Mutual 
Funds and ETFs
In This Chapter
 Gaining insight on mutual funds
 Understanding exchange-traded funds
 Using these vehicles to invest in precious metals
T
here was a great author who started off a book with “these are the best of
times, these are the worst of times” or something like that. As I write this
chapter, the conditions on the world scene could qualify as the worst of times
depending on how you look at it. In 2007, we worry about too much debt in
our country, high taxes, terrorism, Paris Hilton, environmental concerns, infla-
tion, retirement concerns, and so on. On the other hand, when it comes to the
fantastic panorama of investing choices, techniques, and strategies available
today, it can easily qualify as the best of times. This chapter offers a glimpse
of the best of times.
There are many ways of investing, speculating, or otherwise participating in
the world of precious metals. Mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs)
are yet another way for investors and speculators to get involved. They are
actually ideally suited for conservative investors but can also have features
traders and speculators can find appealing.
Mutual Funds
For those of you who see the choices in precious metals or precious metals-
related investments a little bit too dizzying, I don’t blame you. The feeling’s
mutual. Sooooo . . . why not a mutual fund? A mutual fund is a great way to
invest for many small investors and investors in general who are unsure
about any specific investment.

A mutual fund is basically a pool of money that is managed by an investment
firm. This pool of money (the fund) is an accumulation of money from people
like you and me and many other investors. The fund is managed by an invest-
ment firm with a particular investment objective in mind. That objective
could be growth, income, preservation of capital, or some other objective.
The investment firm will put this pool of money to use by buying a portfolio
of securities such as stocks and bonds that the firm believes will meet the
stated objective. The bottom line for the investor here is that you choose the
fund and you leave the task of choosing the investments in the fund to the
investment firm.
Advantages of mutual funds
Mutual funds have endured in popularity since the 1960s and for some very
good reasons. The number of mutual fund offerings when I first started in busi-
ness in 1981 was under 800. By 2006, that number exceeded 10,000 choices, not
including hedge funds (at first I thought a hedge fund was something for land-
scapers). The point here is that there is a mutual fund for virtually any financial
purpose and investors can choose one that can truly pinpoint their need(s).
Fill a specific need
With mutual funds, you can choose a fund that fits your needs, not vice
versa. If you want growth, you can choose a growth fund. From there you
have either aggressive growth or conservative growth. The lesson here is
that you don’t have to fit your needs into a fund and hope that it works out.
You can use a fund that comfortably fits into your personal situation.
Diversification
This is the perennial reason that every source in the universe points out as
the advantage of mutual funds. Number 1 is that you can choose mutual
funds that invest in only stocks or only bonds, or some mix of the two. Then
there are mutual funds that will invest in securities such as stocks in a given
sector or industry. And yes, Virginia, there are mutual funds that specialize in
the world of precious metals and related investments.
The financial commentators on TV are always crowing about diversification
for investors to maintain a balance of both growth and safety. This is where
mutual funds come into the picture. Because of this pool of money the mutual
fund receives from all these investors they have the financial clout to provide
great diversification. This is especially true when you have a sector that could
be more volatile and is uncertain and much harder for the average investor to
choose winners from. The convenience of the mutual funds is you pick the
funds and let portfolio managers of that investment firm pick the winners for
you. The great thing is they can choose a losing stock and little harm is done
because their financial clout gives them the ability to buy 40 or 50 or more 
different stocks in the same portfolio.
176
Part III: Investing Vehicles 

Convenience
Choosing an investment for your portfolio is not easy. It can take consider-
able research and due diligence that is not only good but also appropriate.
For investors who can’t (or won’t) do the necessary homework, mutual funds
can be the answer. Of course, you still have to choose a fund but it’s not that
difficult once you understand your investment objective and personal profile.
For precious metals investors who are not sure about what to invest in and
don’t have the time or inclination to do the research and due diligence that is
required of finding a good start to invest in, why not just choose a mutual
fund? In a mutual fund, the professionals oversee the entire portfolio on a
full-time basis and know what they make by sell and hold decisions on the
securities every day.
For precious metals investors . . .
Therefore if you’re the type of investor who just scratches his head when he
thinks about buying gold, the physical or the paper, gold-mining stocks, or pre-
cious metals futures, then you may want to consider a precious metals mutual
fund. Would you have made some great money? As I mention in a prior chapter,
precious metals have done very well in the year 2000 onward. Therefore, pre-
cious metals mutual funds have done very well. In fact, precious metals mutual
funds were among the best performers in this decade! See Table 13-1.

The downside of mutual funds
Now keep in mind that investing in mutual funds is not all peaches and cream
(unless you choose a food and beverage sector fund). Mutual funds do have
their downside as well. For example the professional management of the
mutual funds is a double-edged sword. The good part is that you get the
investment decisions of professionals. But . . . the bad part is that you get the
investment decisions of professionals. In other words, you may choose a
mutual fund but you generally cannot make the decisions inside the fund and
must rely on others. I read an industry report some years ago that pointed
out that the average age of the average mutual fund manager was under 35.
Hmmm . . . I have socks older than that (just ask my wife). Usually that means
that you have someone who hasn’t had enough exposure to the markets and
their ups and downs over an extensive period of time.
Relying on other decision makers
During the stock market’s 2000–2002 bear market, many mutual funds lost
money needlessly because the money managers who ran these funds gradu-
ated from college during an extensive bull market (the stock market’s power-
ful rise during 1982–1999) so they were clueless about how to manage money
in a bear market. The end result is that millions of investors including mutual
fund investors lost trillions of dollars. The word to the wise here is simple;
make sure you’re choosing mutual funds that have been around a very long
time and that have experienced both bull and bear markets (and that goes for
their financial advisors too!).
Fees and service charges
Another drawback to mutual funds are the various fees involved that investors
are assessed through the mutual fund itself. There are two types of fees to be
aware of: management fees and marketing or sales fees. Every mutual fund has
management fees; obviously you have to pay the people who manage the funds
178
Part III: Investing Vehicles 

as well as pay for the expenses to maintain the fund such as office and utilities,
research costs, and so on. The marketing or sales fees are different matters
since they get paid out to those who are actually marketing the fund. The mar-
keting fees that you pay have no bearing on the performance of the fund but
they do have a bearing on the financial profitability of the fund. If, for example,
you get into a mutual fund that has a 5% front-end loader and that year the
mutual fund was up 10%, the real net gain to you as the investor is 5%.
Please understand that I don’t necessarily think of fees as a negative. After
all, people should be paid for service, performance, and so on. I list them
here just as a heads-up so that you understand the cost of investing. Some
charge high fees; some charge reasonable fees. As an investor and consumer,
you should be aware of all fees involved since they will ultimately have an
impact on your investment return. The following sections run down the fees
you should be aware of. . . .
Management fees
As I mention, all mutual funds have management fees. These fees cover the
operating expenses of the fund (research, office, utilities, and so on) and pay-
ment to the professionals running the fund. The amount of the management fee
will be expressed as a percentage of the fund and it will vary according to the
mutual fund category.
Growth funds, for example, charge a higher management fee usually than,
say, a money market fund. A growth fund could charge a management fee of
1.5% to 3% and possibly higher while a money market fund would have a
management of under 1% and usually under.5%.
There are also some investment firms (such as hedge funds) that charge a
performance fee, which is technically a management fee since it is directly
tied to how well the fund is managed. Performance fees can vary widely but
most firms charge in the neighborhood of 10% to 20%.
As a general rule of thumb, the more involved, complicated, and aggressive
the portfolio, the greater the management fee. Always check the prospectus.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issues guidelines to make it
clear to investors what the costs of investing are for that fund.
Marketing fee #1: The front-end load
The second category of fees are the marketing and sales expenses; referred to
as the load. This is paid to the people or organizations that are marketing the
fund for the investment firm. Sometimes the load is paid in-house if the invest-
ment firm has its own sales force. The first type of load is the front-end load.
The load is typically expressed as a percentage of the investment amount.
The front-end load is a fee that is paid in the beginning. If you invest $1,000
with a fund that has a 5% front-end load, then the initial value of your invest-
ment is $950. If the investment firm tells you the fund has gone up 15%, don’t
179
Chapter 13: Investing in Mutual Funds and ETFs

assume that your investment is now worth $1,150. Your net gain (after factor-
ing in the 5% load) is really up only 9.25% since you have to remember that
your investment started at $950.
All fund fees are paid from the fund; no one will send you an invoice. If
anyone calls you, you won’t have to say the check is in the mail.
Marketing fee #2: The back-end load
The back-end load is a fee that might actually be good for you since it encour-
ages long-term investing. It is a fee that is charged at the time you get out of
the fund. It is also called a redemption fee or charge. Most back-end fees are
staggered; the longer you are in the fund, the lower the fee is. Many funds
actually wipe out the fee once you pass an extended time.
A typical back-end load might be structured as 5% if you are in the fund for
less than a year, 3% if you are in one to three years, 1% if you are in three to
five years, and 0% after five years. Again, double-check the prospectus for the
specifics.
Marketing fee #3: The 12(b)-1 load
The 12(b)-1 load (named after the section in the securities regulations that
allow such a charge) is usually a small percentage that is charged every year
for as long as you are in the fund.
Say you are in a fund with a 1% 12(b)-1 load. If you are in that fund for a year,
your charge would be 1%. If you are talking a $1,000 investment amount, then
the charge would be $10. If you are in the fund for 5 years then over that time
span you would have paid 1% per year or a cumulative amount of 5%. It may
be a small fee but it can erode the return on your investment if you happen to
be in that fund for an extended period of time.
Questionable track records
How often do you see that mutual fund ad that raves “The Fantabulous fund
was up 47% last year,” or “If you invested in our fund when it started ten years
ago, today you could buy Rhode Island with enough change to fill your gas
tank!” or “Our ultra-growth fund was up 97% just before breakfast.” Well . . .
some of it could be true but more likely there was some tweaking of the 
numbers. It’s important to put any numbers in perspective.
For example, take the top-performing fund of 1979: a gold fund. 1979 was a
hot year for gold as it rose through the late ’70s and hit its high in January
1980. During the last five years of the 1970s, the U.S. Gold Services Fund
soared over 1,000%. In 1980 and 1981, gold collapsed and gold-related invest-
ments plummeted. Guess what? In 1982, that gold fund was still in the top 20
180

performing mutual funds even though it was at the bottom of the heap for
1980 and 1981. How could that be? When you add up 3 ultra-fantastic years
with 1 bad year and 1 horrible year, you still come up with a high, positive
yearly average. Energy sector funds had a similar run since oil shot up during
the late 1970s and collapsed during the early 1980s.
The lesson is that you have to analyze track records in context and understand
the effects of mega-trends. Both bull and bear markets tend to last years so it is
important to stay alert when trends stall, sputter, or change directions.
Keys to success with mutual funds
No, this isn’t a book or a chapter on mutual funds per se; but there are things
to look for when you are looking at mutual funds in the metals and mining
sector (and yes . . . some of these points apply no matter what kind of mutual
fund you will be investing in). The following sections give you some points to
keep in mind.
Analyze yourself first before you analyze the fund
If you are conservative with your money and can’t stomach risk and volatility
then spread your money over several funds that invest in larger, established
companies. In the same way there are aggressive and conservative growth
funds in the generic mutual fund realm, there are aggressive and conservative
choices in the world of metals and mining. Mutual funds can buy the stock of,
say, gold mining stocks that are large, major firms in the industry. Mutual
funds can also buy the stock of smaller, more speculative mining companies.
(Mining stocks are covered in Chapter 12).
How you invest is as important as what you invest
A famous investing genius once proclaimed stocks fluctuate. Man . . . I wish 
I said that! Anyway, investments, no matter how well chosen, don’t move in 
a straight line up. The same way bad investments don’t go down in a straight
line. Single investments, or portfolios, or entire markets tend to either zig-zag
up or zig-zag down. Good investments that occasionally pull back (that’s
called a correction; don’t ask me why) present you with a buying opportunity.
Bad investments that occasionally go up (a bear market rally) give you a
chance to cash out at a better price before they resume declining. Since the
world of precious and base metals is in the midst of a long-term bull market,
any pull-back provides the opportunity to add to your position for further
gains as the up-trend in the market unfolds. (That is . . . if you agree with my
prime contention in this book that we are indeed in the midst of a historic 
bull market for gold, silver, and other metals).
181
Chapter 13: Investing in Mutual Funds and ETFs

How would you profit on the upward zig zag of the market with a mutual
fund? There are three ways.
 Reinvest the distributions: When you initially get into a mutual fund,
you are asked (in the fund application) to decide what to do with the
distributions. Distributions are what the portfolio generates, such as
interest, dividends, and/or capital gains. Any and all income or capital
gains generated should be totally reinvested. Numerous studies have
shown that total reinvestment yields the greatest long-term gains
(versus having the distributions sent to you or partially reinvested).
 Dollar-cost averaging: On a regular basis, or on pull-backs (or both)
send in money to your fund. When the fund’s shares are cheaper during
those temporary corrections, you get a buying opportunity.
 Both! Why not? If you are indeed bullish then consider both total reinvest-
ment of distributions and adding to your fund as opportunities present
themselves.
The Prospectus: Netting it out
Yeah . . . I know. You’d rather wait for the movie. Fortunately it’s not that bad.
Here is a quick way to get through the mutual fund prospectus with relatively
little pain. You gotta read before you invest, right? As my uncle Yorgi would
say, an ounce of prevention is worth a cheap suit or something like that, so
read this before you dig into the prospectus:
 What is the objective of the fund? You will usually find the fund’s objec-
tive right on page 1. In a brief paragraph, you’ll know immediately if the
objective is yours as well. If not, fuggetaboutit! If the objective is indeed
your objective, read on.
 What does it cost to invest in that fund? The prospectus should clearly
spell out the fees and charges. The less you pay, the more you’ll gain (all
things being equal).
 What is the fund invested in and what do they plan to invest in? A
snapshot of the portfolio usually accompanies the prospectus. Now you
can see what is in the portfolio and how diversified it is.
 How has it done in the past? What is the fund’s record and how well did
it do not only last year but also over the past three and five years. If you
are a long-term investor and the fund has a long history, check out how
well it did over ten years.
 What services does the fund provide? Ask how they can handle distribu-
tions and can they do things such as automatic transfer of money from
your checking account for purposes of dollar-cost averaging.
182

Now if you want to also ask them, “What’s the capital of Bolivia?” well, that’s
up to you. Now if you don’t follow all these great tips and then make a mistake
with mutual funds, don’t complain. Like my Uncle Yorgi would say, “You
spoiled the broth . . . now you lie in it!” Man . . . I wish I said that.
Mutual Fund Resources
I can’t tell you everything I want to write but there are some great places to
turn to for extensive information on mutual funds in general and in the great
area of metals and mining. Here are some great Web sites for mutual fund
investors:

 Mutual Fund Education Alliance (www.mfea.com)

 Value Line (www.valueline.com)
Exchange-Traded Funds
I love exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Really! I think that they are the best
financial innovation in the past five years. The investing public must think so
too; nearly $500 billion had been invested in ETFs by the end of 2006.
First of all, what is an ETF? An ETF is like a mutual fund but it trades like 
a stock. It’s like a mutual fund in that it has a basket of securities that it 
maintains but the similarity ends there. The basket of securities in the ETF is
typically a fixed basket of securities while the mutual fund’s securities are an
actively managed portfolio. In other words, the mutual fund’s basket of securi-
ties (such as stocks, bonds, and so on) is not static; the securities are regularly
bought and sold as well as held.
The ETF also trades like a stock, another difference it has with mutual funds.
When investors buy or sell shares of a mutual fund, they deal directly with 
the fund. The ETF, on the other hand, is bought and sold like stock. Just like 
a stock, you can buy 1 share or 1,000 easily through any stock brokerage
account. In the following sections, I give you an overview of ETFs, specifically,
precious metals ETFs.
183
Chapter 13: Investing in Mutual Funds and ETFs

The pros and cons of ETFs
ETFs have the following advantages:
 Diversification: Depending on the industry, the ETF could have 20 to 50
different issues in its portfolio. Most ETFs tend to focus on a specific
industry or sector.
 Personal control: You decide how many shares you want to buy. You
decide whether to hold or sell. You can even use brokerage orders such as
stop-loss orders or virtually any brokerage order that applies to a stock.
 Tax advantages: Because the ETF’s basket of securities is a relatively
fixed portfolio, it is tax efficient in that the individual securities are
seldom sold.
 Liquidity: Just as with a stock, you can buy or sell it very easily.
 Flexibility: You can dictate how many shares and be able to buy the
right amount in your account whether you have a large or small account.
 Lower costs: ETF fees are relatively low and a small percentage of the
portfolio (especially when compared to mutual funds with high loads).
 Ownership benefits: You own an ETF as though it’s a stock; you can use
it as collateral (ETF’s are marginable) and you use it to write covered
call options (options are covered in Chapter 15).
Those are great benefits. Just thinking about them makes the tears well up in
my eyes. Ok . . . let’s get back down to earth. Here are some of the drawbacks:
 The shortcoming of diversification: Diversification reduces risk but it
can also reduce gain. A singe stock may have great risk but if you are
right about it, it has great potential for gain. Yes . . . there are trade-offs.
 Industry or sector risk: If you choose an ETF in an industry that is
having a rough time, it will cause the ETF’s price to fall.
There is a unique risk with ETFs that specialize in the metal itself. ETFs such
as the Gold ETF (symbol: GLD) and the Silver ETF (symbol: SLV) do have a
question about whether they actually have the metal itself.
The world of precious metals ETFs
Because ETFs are an excellent way for investors and speculators to partici-
pate in the precious metals arena, here are all the ETFs (so far!) that you
should be aware of . . .
184
Part III: Investing Vehicles 

The gold ETFs
Investing in gold gets easier and easier. These are the primary gold ETFs in
order of trading volume (with their trading symbols):
 streetTRACKS Gold Shares (GLD)
 iShares COMEX Gold Trust (IAU)
 PowerShares DB Gold Fund (DGL)
The gold ETFs act like the metal but in paper form. In other words, the gold
ETFs allow you to get involved in gold but as a paper investment that you 
can transact much like a stock. You see, you can’t normally (or at least conve-
niently) buy physical gold through a stock brokerage account (or through 
an IRA if it is in, say, a self-directed brokerage account or a mutual fund). But
with the advent of gold ETFs, you can now participate in the gold market 
conveniently and as easily as any stock or bond.
The silver ETFs
For those who are excited about the potential profits in silver (like me) then
these silver ETFs are worth considering:
 iShares Silver Trust (SLV)
 PowerShares DB Silver Fund (DBS)
Here again is the same point as with the gold ETFs. The silver ETF gives
investors and financial institutions the ability to include silver as an invest-
ment choice inside the realm of a brokerage account or IRA.
Other precious metals ETFs
The following are metals-oriented ETFs that add a level of diversification.
They have more than just one metal:
 PowerShares DB Precious Metals Fund (symbol: DBP). This ETF concen-
trates on the two most prominent precious metals, gold and silver.
 Central Fund of Canada (symbol: CEF). Technically not an ETF but has
all the characteristics of one. CEF has gold and silver physical bullion
reserves.
Other ETFs for the metals-minded
For the sake of completeness, I want to include some ETFs that have metals
as an important component but that have other, non-metal components as
well. I do this because investors should be aware of other securities that are
not necessarily a pure-play involving 100% precious metals. The reason is
185
Chapter 13: Investing in Mutual Funds and ETFs

that an ETF can have diversification for those investors who want to hedge
their bets, so to speak, about precious metals.
 Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (GDX). This ETF mirrors the 30 gold
mining indexes found in the AMEX gold mining index.
 PowerShares DB Base Metals Fund (DBB). This fund is based on an index
of the most commonly used and most liquid base metals, such as 
aluminum, copper, and zinc.
 PowerShares DB Commodity Index Tracking Fund (DBC). This fund
reflects an index of six of the most heavily traded commodities in the
global marketplace: gold, aluminum, crude oil, heating oil, corn, 
and wheat.
 SPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF (XME). This ETF mirrors the S&P metals
and mining index which is composed of 30 companies involved with 
precious and base metals and mining.
All the above ETFs have generally performed well during the past few years
of the metals’ bull market. If you’re looking to participate in precious metals
with some measure of safety, this is the venue for you. Just ask Uncle Yorgi.
Oops . . . before I forget, I want you to investigate options on ETFs. Some of
the greatest profits in recent years for myself and my clients and students
have not just been in ETFs; they have also been with options on ETFs. There
are a variety of ways to profit with options and there are options strategies
suitable for virtually any investor. To find out more about options see
Chapter 15.
ETF Resources
As ETFs proliferate, so will the information and opinions about them. Here
are among the best resources to help you choose. I’m sure you’ll see a lot
more coming out of the woodwork in the coming months.
The exchanges
Most of the ETFs you’ll come across will most likely emerge on either the
American Stock Exchange (www.amex.com) or the New York Stock Exchange
(www.nyse.com). As of this writing, the American Stock Exchange has more
information and resources for ETF investors since it has been a trailblazer in
this hot area. You’ll find lots of details on ETFs and you have the ability to
download prospectuses (in Adobe PDF file format).

The issuers
Since the ETF universe keeps expanding, you should get to know the major
firms that issue ETFs. These firms do the heavy lifting of creating the ETFs,
listing them on the stock exchanges, and maintaining them. See Table 13-2 for
an extensive listing of ETF issuers.

Peruse the extensive list of ETF issuers and their roster of ETFs. More are
added constantly and due to the boom in natural resources in general and
metals in particular, you have (and will have) a great selection of precious
(and base) metals–related ETFs.
Investors are best served if they stick to ETFs that are very liquid. (Yes, there is
a water ETF but that’s not what I mean!) In other words, stick to ETFs that have
a large market (many buyers and sellers) so that it is easier to buy and sell
your ETF. Judging the liquidity can be as easy as looking at the trading volume.
(Most active ETFs have a daily volume of over 50,000 shares.) Low liquidity or
low activity sometimes results in unfavorable prices due to matters such as 
a wide bid/ask spread or a difficulty to quickly fill an order.

Newsletters
The ETF part of the financial landscape is here to stay and it will continue to
grow. Their limitation is only set by the imagination of the issuers. You can
find an ETF for almost any purpose
 ETF Investment Outlook (www.investmentoutlook.com)
 ETF & CEF Newsletter (www.etfinvestornewsletter.com)
 ETF Watch (www.etfwatch.com)
The large publishers such as Forbes, Weiss Research, and Value Line have
newsletters and research reports that cover ETFs (and mutual funds) with 
in-depth data. Well-stocked business libraries carry their publications. And 
of course, use a major search engine to find them and other sources.
Web sites
Fortunately, the same general financial information Web sites that tell you
about the economy in general and the financial markets in particular will very
likely have lots of information on ETFs (and mutual funds) and how each one
is faring lately. Here’s some to start you off:

asten your seat belts. Check your helmets. Grab some bromo-seltzer.
You’re now ready for the world of futures! Fortunes can be made quickly.
They can be lost even faster. Let’s dip our collective toes in the water of this
exciting corner of the financial world.
Back to the Futures
Commodities and futures are mentioned as though they are synonymous but,
at the risk of nit-picking, they are truly different. First of all, commodities make
up the raw stuff that is indeed the building blocks of society. Commodities
encompass food, building materials, precious metals, energy and more.
Commodities range from the typical (wheat, soybeans, sugar, and so on) to
the odd sounding (pork bellies?). Commodities end up in their ultimate forms
as produce and processed foods found at the local supermarket or in other
venues such as the gasoline you get at the local gas station or the components
found in the circuits of a computer or cellphone. They are in every corner of
modern life.
Now how about futures? Futures are nothing more than commodities that
come in a standardized quantity and are delivered in the future at a specified
price and a specified date in the future (hence the term futures). The word
futures is technically short-hand for futures contract since futures contracts
are really legal claims to an underlying asset (the commodities). The reality
then is that commodities are real stuff while futures are paper. So futures 
contracts are derivatives; they derive their value from the underlying asset.
This is a crucial distinction (you’ll see why later in this chapter).

I think that a good way to remember the difference between commodities and
futures is somewhat like the difference between a car and a car title. The car
is the underlying asset and the car title is a formal piece of paper that has a
legal claim to a car. In the same way a futures contract precisely describes
what it is a claim to (a certain quantity and quality of a commodity), a car
title precisely describes what it is a claim to (a 1987 Ford Torino, its serial
number, and so on). This is a very insightful paragraph so I might as well end
it here.
Although the futures market may look sometimes like a crazy and haphazard
market, the futures market is an orderly market that performs important
functions in our overall economy. Although futures are a speculative and
risky market for our purposes, it is actually a market that removes risk and
uncertain for those in industry that need the underlying commodities to keep
making the stuff that you and I need on a daily basis.

Part III: Investing Vehicles 
A brief history on futures
In the mid-1800s, merchants began organizing
centralized markets to make the act of buying,
selling, and trading commodities much easier.
These places gave them the ability to set stan-
dards for quality and quantity. The first commodi-
ties to be commonly traded were grains and other
agricultural products. By the mid-1900s, over
1,500 markets or exchanges had been set up at
every major port and rail station. As America
became industrialized, these exchanges went
beyond agricultural commodities into almost any-
thing that had an active market.
The major commodity hubs sprung up during the
19th and 20th centuries at two large urban cities . . .
Chicago and New York. In New York City, circa 1872,
a group of dairy merchants came together to create
a formal exchange which came to be called the
Butter and Cheese Exchange of New York.
As they added commodities, the exchange grew
and so did the name. It became the Butter,
Cheese and Egg Exchange. I would hate to think
what the local supermarket would have been
called then but fortunately, they made it a con-
venient name in 1882 when it became the New
York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX). A second
exchange, Commodity Exchange, Inc., was estab-
lished during the Great Depression in the early
1930s. This came to be called COMEX and 
it specialized in hard goods and metals such as
copper, silver, and tin.
Because the federal government banned private
ownership of gold during the Great Depression,
it was not available for futures trading on the
COMEX until December 1974. New York’s two
largest commodities exchanges, COMEX and
NYMEX, merged in August 1994.
The two exchanges became two divisions of one
entity. The NYMEX Division traded energy (such
as crude oil, heating oil, gasoline, and natural
gas) and the precious metals platinum and pal-
ladium. The COMEX Division covered gold, silver,
copper, aluminum, and several stock indexes.
In the early days (the 1800s and early 1900s) trans-
actions were primarily in cash on the spot 
for immediate delivery (the spot market) and in 
forward contracts (described later in this chapter)
before the advent of futures contracts.

How the futures market works
The futures market operates in a centralized marketplace called the futures
exchange. The exchange makes sure that the market works smoothly. Those
floor brokers are there to match buyers and sellers with the best prices. Each
of the stations represents a batch of commodities and that chaotic crowd that
hovers around the stations is making buy and sell bids based on the open cry
system. In that crowd are brokers who are buying futures for their clients or for
their own accounts. Those shouting for the buyers are looking for the lowest
prices. Those shouting for the sellers are looking for the highest prices. This
method has real and beneficial impact not only for those in futures but also 
the economy at large.
Two very important events occur on the floor of the exchange with all these
brokers:
 Price discovery: Because of how competitive it is, the futures market
becomes an important way to determine prices based on current and
future estimated supply and demand. The futures market receives a 
non-stop flow of information from around the world, all of which gets
absorbed and ends up being reflected in the price through the bidding
process. This is how the price is discovered. This helps the rest of the
economy figure out prices and values of an entire range of goods from 
A to Z. Capitalism at its finest!
 Risk reduction: The futures markets provide a place for commerce and
industry to reduce risk when making purchases. Risk is reduced because
the price in the futures contract is set which helps those who want 
delivery of the underlying asset know exactly what they are buying (or
selling), how much they are paying (or receiving), and when delivery
can (or should) be made. Some examples appear later in this chapter
(see hedging).
That’s right . . . futures can reduce risk. Your response might be “Reduce risk?!
Are you crazy?! I lost a fortune going long umbrella futures just before the
drought! How can futures possibly reduce risk?” Glad you asked. Technically,
risk is not reduced . . . it is transferred. Merchants and manufacturers seek to
reduce the risk in buying their raw materials and the folks who take on this
risk for them are the speculators. Speculators take on risk because of the
incentive to possibly make a lot of money.
The futures market is a crystal clear example of the age-old equation of risk
versus return. Desiring a greater return on your money means tolerating
greater risk. If you don’t want more risk, then you have to tolerate a lower
return on your money (yep . . . it can be a vicious cycle).
191
Chapter 14: Exploring Futures

What can be traded as a futures contract
The average person would be surprised as to the range of things that can 
be traded as futures (the average person is also annoyed at being called 
average). Although we concentrate on precious metals, it’s important for you
to see the range since many traders do two or more commodities (or other
tradeable entities such as currencies and financial instruments). A trader
may, for example, take positions in gold and the U.S. dollar to take advantage
of opposing price moves. It’s important for you to know what’s available for
trading opportunities or to just plain diversify your futures account:
 Precious metals: The basic ones are gold, silver, platinum, and palladium.
 Base metals: Copper, aluminum, zinc, lead, tin, and nickel (the non-ferrous
metals). Find more details on base metals in Chapter 9.
 Steel: A ferrous metal (not to be confused with a Ferris wheel).
 Currencies (also known as Forex which is short for foreign exchange):
The most actively traded are the U.S. dollar, euro, Japanese yen,
Canadian dollar, British pound, Australian dollar, and others.
 Indices: The S&P 500, E-Mini S&P, Nasdaq, Dow Jones, FTSE, DAX, 
and others.
 Grains: The most active are corn, wheat, soybeans, soy meal, bean oil,
oats, rice, rapeseed, barley, and others.
 Financial instruments: Treasury notes, treasury bonds, muni-bond,
eurodollar, BUND, Schatz, Euroyen, and others.
 Food and fiber: Coffee, cocoa, sugar, cotton, orange juice, lumber, 
and others.
 Energy: Crude oil, Brent Crude, West Texas Intermediate Crude, natural
gas, unleaded gasoline, propane, and others.
 Meats: Live cattle, pork, lean hogs, and others.
 Plastics: That includes . . . uh . . . plastics.
 Stocks: There are futures on single stocks.
 The unusual: Hurricane (you read that right), home prices, and who
knows what else they’ll think up.
The futures market is such a growing area, I wish there were futures on
futures (maybe in the future).

The Players in the World of Futures
The main players in the world of futures are the exchanges, speculators,
hedgers, and the regulators. Check out the sections that follow for more
information on each.
To make all this great futures activity happen, you will need a broker and an
account approved, funded, and ready to go. I could write a whole chapter on
brokers so I did . . . see Chapter 17.
The exchanges
All the futures trading action has to happen somewhere. That place would a
centralized market that makes the buying and selling efficient and liquid; that
place would be a futures exchange. Here are the major futures exchanges in
the United States:
 New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX): This is the most active
exchange for precious metals (www.nymex.com).
 Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME; www.cme.com).
 Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT; www.cbot.com).
Don’t forget that these exchanges also offer options on futures contracts.
Speak to your broker about options since they are great tools for speculators.
For speculators in base metals (both futures and options), you may need to
look outside the United States for opportunities not readily available at
exchanges mentioned. A sign of how markets have become global is that now
it can be easy to trade futures in your account that are in an international
futures exchange. The largest and most active ones are 
 London Mercantile Exchange (LME): They offer futures and options on
zinc, lead, nickel, tin, aluminum, and copper. Their Web site is www.lme.
co.uk.
 Eurex: This is a European futures exchange very active in financial
instruments such as derivatives (www.eurexchange.com).
 Tokyo Commodity Exchange (TOCOM): They have precious metals
futures contracts (as well as some unusual ones such as rubber and
kerosene futures). Find out more at www.tocom.or.jp.
193
Chapter 14: Exploring Futures

As the world becomes a more global market, more and more exchanges will
either spring up or existing exchanges will make available their own offerings
in precious metals. Exchanges ranging from Dubai (pronounced “do buy”;
hopefully they “do sell”) to Shanghai have already approved trading in 
precious metals such as gold and silver.
Keep in mind that all this international futures trading will benefit you even if
you don’t buy or sell a single ounce of any precious metal. As more investors
across the globe get involved, that will increase demand. Couple this with
limited supply and you have yet another bullish factor for precious metals.
Speculators
This is the category that you and I belong to. We don’t want to take delivery
of 25,000 pounds of copper – we just want to profit from its market action. As
market participants, speculators are out to profit from the futures market risk
and volatility. Speculators are not involved in some business that needs the
goods tied to the futures contract; they are looking for cash transactions.
Depending on the market, only 1% to 5% of futures contracts result in a physi-
cal delivery. Speculators are not seeking safety but the financial benefits that
could accompany the risky side of the market.
Hedgers
Hedgers are not landscapers. That is just a term for those who practice hedg-
ing, which is a practice of making an order to reduce the risk of an unfavor-
able price move in an asset or commodity by taking an offsetting position in 
a related security (such as a futures contract). The odds are that the hedger
is an organization in commerce or industry (such as a manufacturer or an
agricultural business) that regularly buys raw materials for its production
facilities. Here’s an example . . .
Baubles Galore, Inc. (BG), is a gold jewelry manufacturer that must secure
some gold before the holiday season to produce earrings and necklaces for
retail consumers who are already being marketed in catalogs and Web sites
with prices already publicized. Say that season is six months away. What 
happens if the price of gold goes up during that time? The prices that the
consumers would be paying are already set. If gold goes down in that period,
not a problem. BG would end up making more money. But the real problem is
if prices go up. That is a real risk for BG since it cannot pass along the higher
cost to its customers. What can the company do?
194
Part III: Investing Vehicles 

Fortunately, the company can hedge or diminish the risk of the potential gold
price increase by entering the futures market and purchasing a gold contract
that would settle in a suitable time frame (such as August) and lock in a
price. Let’s say that time has passed and it is now August and the price of
gold is up $50 per ounce. Fortunately, BG is not affected by the increase of
the price of gold since the futures contract locked in the lower price.
Now you see the value of hedging and how the firms that do take delivery 
benefit from a futures contract. Locking in a price protects you from unfore-
seen price increases. Hedging with futures contracts can protect buyers and
sellers. Once you understand who has the incentive to lock in a lower price (or
a higher price) you can understand the economic value of futures contracts to
hedgers. Cattle ranchers would hedge against lower meat prices while a large
restaurant chain would hedge against higher meat prices. In each case, the risk
was transferred to the other side of those futures contracts, the speculators.
The regulators
America’s futures market is regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission (CFTC), a federal government agency (www.cftc.gov). The
market is also subject to regulation by the National Futures Association
(NFA), a private, self-regulatory body authorized by the U.S. Congress and
subject to CFTC supervision. The NFA (www.nfa.futures.org) primarily
overseas the brokers and enforces a code of business ethics.
A futures broker (the firm and those individuals employed as brokers) must
be registered with the CFTC in order to issue or buy or sell futures contracts.
Futures brokers must also be registered with the NFA and the CFTC in order
to conduct business. The CFTC has the power to seek criminal prosecution
(through the Department of Justice) when it thinks that the law may have
been violated. The NFA can permanently bar a company or an individual from
dealing on the futures exchange because of violations of business ethics and
the NFA code of conduct.
Investors and speculators should become more informed about how futures
should work and aware of anything improper. To find out more, head to the
Web sites for the CFTC and the NFA. You will find great consumer information
on choosing a broker and educational materials for how the market works.
If you feel that you have been victimized by fraud or improper behavior, 
contact the CFTC and the NFA for assistance.

Chapter 14: Exploring Futures

The Fundamentals of Futures Contracts
At the core of futures trading is the futures contract. The futures contract
derives its value from the underlying asset (corn, gold, and so on). In this
respect a futures contract is really a derivative. A derivative sounds compli-
cated but the essence of a derivative is that it (a paper contract, for example)
derives its value from something tangible.
In a futures contract, the agreement is between two parties. Party #1 agrees
to deliver a commodity (referred to as the short position). Party 2 agrees to
receive a commodity (referred to as the long position). 
After all, what is being traded? The futures contract is a paper vehicle with
the underlying promise to deliver the goods, the commodities involved. A
buyer of a futures contract may or may not want delivery. It depends on why
they are buying into the futures contract. Buying the futures contract is also
referred to as going long. There are two basic reasons that a buyer will buy a
futures contract:
The buyer is an organization that may want to see a delivery of the physi-
cal commodity made. Maybe the organization is a jewelry manufacturing
firm that needs raw materials (such as gold or silver) to make jewelry.
The buyer is a speculator seeking profit. He or she doesn’t want the
underlying commodities (who wants a ton of pork bellies or copper
dumped on their lawns anyway?); they are just looking for making some
money betting on the price move of the underlying commodity.
Features of the futures contract
Like any contract, a futures contract is an agreement. It is a saleable contract
and it is made on the trading floor of a formal futures exchange. The contract
is for the buying or selling of a particular commodity (in our case, metals) at
a predetermined price at a specified delivery date in the future.
A specified size
Futures contracts get standardized for the same reason when you go to the
store to get a loaf of Wheat-O brand bread: it is the exact same as any other
loaf of the same type.
The futures contract is tied to an asset with a set size. Each security futures
contract has a set size. The size of the security futures contract is deter-
mined by the regulated exchange on which the contract trades. For example,
196
Part III: Investing Vehicles 

a security futures contract for a single stock may be based on a hundred
shares of that stock. If prices are reported per-share the value of the contract
would be the price times 100. For a narrow-based security indices the value
of the contract is the price of the component securities times the multiplier
set by the exchange as part of the contract firms.
Specified quality
Not just any old batch of stuff can be an underlying asset to a futures con-
tract. The exchange is usually pretty vigorous about quality. Take the Chicago
Board of Trade (CBOT) and its silver futures contract. The description of 
the underlying metal states clearly that it must be “5,000 troy ounces (±6%) 
of refined silver, assaying not less than .999 fineness, in cast bars weighing
1,000 or 1,100 troy ounces each.” You can’t just slap on some silver paint to 
a copper brick and expect it to be acceptable. Buyers and sellers expect a
standardized quality.
Specified prices
The prices of security futures contracts are usually quoted the same way
prices are quoted in the underlying asset. For example, a contract for an 
individual security would be quoted in dollars and cents per share. Contracts
for indices would be quoted on an index number, usually stated to two deci-
mal points. Each security futures contract has a minimum price fluctuation
(called a tick), which may differ from product to product or exchange to
exchange. For example, if a particular security futures contract has a tick size
of one dollar, you can buy the contract at $100 or at $101 but not at $100.50.
A specified delivery date
Futures contracts on precious metals will continue to be traded right through
the deliver money until trading is terminated on a day specified by the
exchange near the end of the month. Up until expiration you may liquidate an
open position by offsetting your contract with an equal and opposite contract
that expires in the same month. If you do not liquidate an open position before
it expires, you will be required to make or take delivery of the underlying 
security or to settle the contract in cash after expiration.
Although security futures contracts on a particular security or a narrow-
based security index may be listed in and traded on more than one regulated
exchange, a contract specifications may not be the same. Also, prices for 
contracts on the same security or index may vary on different regulated
exchanges because of different contract specifications.
Because each futures exchange has slightly differing terms for its contracts,
review the contract specifications at the exchange’s Web site. Discuss it with
your broker so you’re not surprised.

Metals Futures Contracts
You can find futures contracts for both precious as well as base metals, and
you can also get in the futures games with a smaller amount of dough by using
mini-futures contracts. I discuss these futures contracts as well as special 
considerations, such as margin and leverage, that you should keep in mind
if you decide to get involved in futures.
Precious metals contracts
There are futures contracts on gold, silver, platinum, and palladium. There are
more obscure precious metals (like rhodium) but their markets are very thinly
traded and not really practical for the average investor. Table 14-1 gives you a
rundown on the main precious metals futures contracts (at NYMEX).

A different animal: The forward contract
Sometimes you may hear the phrase “forward
contract” when commodities are discussed. This
is not the same as a futures contract. A forward
contract is usually a private contract (not a pub-
licly tradeable contract like a futures contract)
that is created in a cash market between a buyer
and a seller of the asset in question. Although the
delivery of the underlying asset is made in the
future, the price is settled on the day of the trade.
Forward contracts are not standardized nor are
they transacted at the exchange.

Trades on a futures contract continue through its delivery month until a final

terminated for trading as of December 29, 2008.

Mini-futures contracts
For those of you who think you need a zillion bucks to get into futures, think
again. The exchanges have something for those who would like to speculate
with less money, which also means less risk.
Recently, some of these mini contracts had margin requirements of under
$500, which makes it more affordable to speculators with limited funds. Of
course, check with your broker since initial margin can change.
See Table 14-4 for a list of mini-futures contracts.

Pass the margin
A futures contract is an obligation and not an asset; it has no value as collateral
for a loan. Because of the potential for a loss as a result of the daily market to
market process, however, a margin deposit is required of each party to a secu-
rity futures contract. This required margin deposit also is referred to as a per-
formance bond. This performance bond or margin is security for the broker.
The basic margin requirement is 20% of the current value of the security
futures contract. Some types of futures strategies may have lower margin
requirements. Requests for additional margin are known as margin calls. 
Both the buyer and seller must individually deposit required margin to their
respective accounts.
It is important to understand that individual brokerage firms can, and in
many cases do, require margin that is higher than the exchange require-
ments. Additionally margin requirements may vary from brokerage firm to
brokerage firm. Furthermore, a brokerage firm can increase its house margin
requirements at any time without providing advance notice, and such
increases could result in a margin call.
For example, some firms may require margin to be positive the business day
following the date of the deficiency, or some firms may even require deposit
on the same day. Some firms may require margin to be on deposit in the
account before they will accept an order for a security futures contract. You
should get very familiar with the customer agreement with your brokerage
firm before entering into any transactions in security futures contracts.
Brokerage firms generally reserve the right to liquidate a customer’s security
futures contract positions or sell customer assets to meet a margin call at any
time without contacting the customer. Brokerage firms may also enter into
equivalent but opposite positions on your account in order to manage the risk
created by a margin call. Some customers mistakenly believe that a firm is
required to contact them for a margin call to the valve and that the firm is not
allowed to liquidate securities or other assets in their accounts to meet a
margin call unless a less the firm has contacted them first. This is not the case.
While most firms notify their customers of margin calls and allow some time to
deposit additional margin you are not required to do so. Even if a firm notifies
the customer of a margin call and sets a specified due date for a margin
201
Chapter 14: Exploring Futures

deposit, the firm can still take action as necessary to protect its financial 
interests, including the immediate liquidation of positions without advance
notification to the customer.
For speculators who want to avoid the problems inherent in margin of your
account, consider options on futures. Generally, options on futures for retail
investors and speculators can be bought with cash and done so without
margin. Options on futures have the same basic volatility and can offer great
profit potential but can be done without the risks of margin. You can lose
money in options but at least the worst case scenario is that losses are limited
to the price of the option and no more. See Chapter 15 for more about options.
Almost every precious metal and base metal covered in this book has options
available. Explore this with your broker.
Leverage: The double-edged sword
The futures market can offer leverage which can magnify your gains (or your
losses). Leverage is the ability to retain control over a valuable asset with a 
relatively small amount of money. Most people are familiar with leverage in real
estate; you gain control of a property valued at $250,000 by making a small
down payment of, say, 10% ($25,000) and borrow the remaining 90% ($225,000).
Then if the property goes up to $300,000 in value (a gain of $50,000), your initial
invested amount of $25,000 at that point made you 200%.
In futures, you get similar leverage. On the plus side, you don’t have to use as
much money as in real estate and you don’t have to wait a long time to see
results. On the negative side, the leverage can work against you and you can
lose money big time. I tell you . . . there’s always a catch!
In futures, the down payment is your initial deposit (not really a down pay-
ment; just comparing it with the prior example). As in the previous example,
the initial deposit or margin is a small sum that in turn controls a valuable
asset as represented by the valuable futures contract.
Take a futures contract on gold. The contract’s underlying asset is 100 oz. of
gold. If gold is $650 an ounce, then the contract would be worth $65,000 (100
ounces times $650 an ounce). Say the initial margin is $5,000 and you are going
long on the gold contract. If gold rises to $710, then that contract would be
worth $71,000 (100 ounces times $710 an ounce). Since the price rise would be
$6,000, your profit percentage would be 120% (the $6,000 gain is 120% of your
initial margin deposit of $5,000).
Again, if gold fell in that example, you would lose money as your broker
makes that margin call so that you can kick in more funds to maintain margin.

Basic Futures Trading Strategies
The whole point of speculating in futures contracts is an attempt to figure 
out what the price will be in the near future and profit from that move. Your
strategies all flow from what your expectation is. Although there are many
sophisticated strategies with futures (especially when you combine them
with options on futures), that is something you can look forward to learning
after this book. For now, the basics will be covered. Very basic. But some of
the best strategies are indeed simple.
Basic strategy #1: Going long
In going long, the speculator is making a bullish bet (thinking that the asset will
go up in price) on that futures contract. The speculator gets into the contract
by agreeing to buy and receive delivery of the underlying asset at a set price.
The bet is that the market price will rise above the set price and the profit is
the difference.
Say that Fred the speculator is bullish gold. Fred would therefore go long a
gold futures contract. Presume he starts with an initial margin of $2,000 in
August. He buys one December contract with gold at $600 per ounce. Since
the contract is for 100 ounces of gold for a total contract value of $60,000, and
since Fred is going long in August he is expecting (hoping?) that the price of
gold will go up by the time the contract expires in December.
Say that gold rises by $30 to $630 in October. He decides to sell the contract
to lock in a profit. The contract would be worth $63,000 and the profit would
be $3,000. That $3,000 would be a profit of 150% in about two months.
Of course, gold could go down. If it had gone down $30 instead, then the 
contract would be worth $57,000 and Fred would realize a loss and a margin
call would be made since he would have to kick in more margin.
Basic strategy #2: Going short
In going short, the speculator is making a bearish bet (thinking that the asset
will go down in price) on that futures contract. The speculator gets into the
contract by agreeing to sell and deliver the underlying asset at a set price. The
bet is that the market price will fall below the set price and make a profit on
the difference.
Let’s say that after doing some research, Barbara expects the price of palla-
dium to go down in the next few months. It is September and she decides to
sell (go short) a January futures contract. Starting with an initial margin
203
Chapter 14: Exploring Futures

deposit of $3,000 Barbara would then sell a contract today, in September, at
the higher price of $25,000, and buy it back after the price declined and
before January. Remember, going short is a strategy to profit in a declining
(or bear) market.
By November the price of palladium had gone down and the contract’s
market value had subsequently declined to $20,000. After buying back her
short position, she nets a gain of $5,000 ($25,000 less $20,000). Of course, if
palladium rallied (gone up) she would have lost money. Say that palladium’s
rally caused the futures contract’s market value to rise and hit $31,000 in
November. Barbara would have lost $6,000 (yes, the margin call would have
been painful).
Basic strategy #3: Spreads
Going long and going short are out-and-out directional strategies. In other
words you are 100% committed to a particular direction, either up or down.
Once you get past those two, you get into strategies that offer some hedging
opportunities for you the speculator. This means the next strategy . . . spreads.
Speculators can use spreads to take advantage of the price difference between
two different contracts of the same underlying asset. Spread strategies are less
risky than directional strategies which may make them good considerations for
speculators with limited funds.
Check out the three common spreads in the following sections.
The calendar spread
In futures this is also called an intracommodity spread because it is done
within the same commodity or asset. Say that Eddie is doing a calendar
spread on silver futures. He will buy (go long) the further-out month while
selling (going short) the closer month. Table 14-5 gives you an idea of how
the trade looks.

Part III: Investing Vehicles 

As you can see, the contract for Dec ’08 is valued at $68,375 and the July ’08
contract is $67,100. The difference is $1,275. There is a difference because the
market places greater value on the December contract.
In this spread, Eddie anticipates that the price difference between July and
December silver futures will widen. Ideally, he’d like to see the short position
(on July silver) go down and his long position (on December silver) go up.
More likely the two contracts’ prices will move in the same direction but
Eddie is betting that the latter month contract will rise more so than the 
earlier month. He starts with initial margin of $600.
The spread between July silver (at $13.42 an ounce) and December silver (at
$13.675) is 25.5 cents. Since a silver futures contract is on 5,000 ounces of
silver, the total spread is then easy math (5,000 × 25.5 cents = $1,275).
As time passes and we get closer to July, Eddie is ready to cash out his calen-
dar spread. Both prices rise but, as Eddie anticipated, the December contract
increased more than the July contract. Presume that July silver rose by 20
cents and that December silver rose by 35 cents. After you do all the math, July
silver is $13.62 and December silver is $14.025. The contracts are now worth
$68,100 (July) and $70,125 (December). The spread has widened to $2,025.
Eddie closes out the spread. The loss on the short position was offset by the
greater gain on the long position. His profit is $750.
In the case that silver went down, the value of his position would go down 
but he could still realize either a smaller loss or a partial profit since his short
position would become profitable. In the calendar spread, you have two posi-
tions that are like bets against each other. In a spread, you are hoping that
your winning position is more successful than your losing position.
The inter-market spread
In the calendar spread, I provide an example to flesh out the concept to show
you how a spread works. That gives you the gist so I won’t have to beat you
up with more detailed examples. You know now how a basic spread works.
Beyond that, other spreads are the same basic structure but they may have
some twist.
An inter-market spread is a spread with two contracts of the same month 
but two different markets. You go long in one market while you go short in
another market. For example, you can go long one oil futures contract and
short one natural gas futures contract.
The inter-exchange spread
This is another type of spread in which you go long on a contract in one
futures exchange while you go short another contract in a different futures
exchange. For example, the speculator may go long a contract on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange (CME) and go short a contract on the London Mercantile
Exchange (LME).
205
Chapter 14: Exploring Futures

And if you go long and short two dairy contracts then I believe it’s called a
cheese spread (but don’t quote me).
Fundamental analysis
Fundamental analysis is usually used for stock investing but it is also done
with futures. With stocks, fundamental analysis involves reviewing and ana-
lyzing the company’s finances, operations, and its market to determine how
well its stock will perform. As a side point it is recommended for long-term
investing (measured in years).
The same methodology is used for futures but instead you are looking at the
factors affecting its market price such as supply-and-demand data along with
economic and political variables that could influence its value. As a side point,
futures tend to be more short-term (usually measured in weeks or months). 
In general, futures certainly have a shorter time horizon than stocks.
Technical analysis
This method of analyzing futures and their underlying assets is based on the
idea that market data, such as charts of price, volume, and open interest, can
help predict the future (usually short-term) direction of market prices. The
folks who use technical analysis believe that they can accurately predict the
future price of a stock by looking at its historical prices as recorded in charts
and accompanying data. In part, technical analysis makes the assumption
(with the data) that market psychology influences trading in a way that
enables predicting when futures prices will rise or fall. More on technical
analysis in Chapter 18.
Fundamental versus technical
This one reminds me of that beer commercial where the two sides heatedly
exchange those immortal words “tastes great!” and “less filling.” That humor-
ous debate made it sound as if it were one versus the other. But who says that
you couldn’t have both. I think that investing and speculating can taste great
and be less filling. Well . . . you know what I mean.
In the financial world, fundamental versus technical analysis is a long-time
debate but it’s not a heated one. No fights break out in the bleachers and one
group doesn’t throw water balloons at the other one (at least not to my
knowledge).
Considering my background and what has worked for me, I can be rightly
called a fundamental analyst since I use an approach labeled value investing.
Because stocks are predominantly a long-term pursuit, fundamental analysis
works extremely well for me and others. For people with a long-term perspec-
tive, fundamental analysis generally wins out over technical analysis. As proof,
in the historical pantheon of investors, you will find far more familiar names
that are proponents of fundamental analysis and value investing (or some vari-
ation of these) versus those that use technical analysis and charting methods.
206
Part III: Investing Vehicles 

In the short term, it is a far different picture. Technical analysis has shown to
be valuable and using it to determine short-term buy-and-sell trading decisions
has shown some fruitful results. A great way to show these two approaches 
in action is to view an illustrative example. Here are the charts for silver for 
the year 2006 (Figure 14-1) and for the longer time frame 2000 to July 2007
(Figure 14-2). Combined, these two charts give a compelling perspective.
As you can see, silver was a trader’s dream in 2006 (Figure 14-1): several solid
rallies (up moves in the price) and several steep corrections (down moves in
the price). Technical analysis was useful in determining conditions such as
oversold and overbought which worked much like red flags to be careful 
and green lights which indicated a good entry point. During 2006, the funda-
mentals were very strong for silver but that didn’t stop the short-term price
corrections that are really present in most bull markets (and certainly 
present in precious metals).
Chart B shows how the fundamentals could have been a superior catalyst to
higher prices for silver. In the early part of the decade, silver was in the $4 to
$5 range and it climbed to the $12 to $14 range during early 2007 (up 200%+,
nearly tripling!). For long-term investors, fundamental analysis was more 
beneficial.

Chapter 14: Exploring Futures

Chart A also shows you that the short term can be haphazard and irrational.
The buying and selling sometimes doesn’t make sense since market 
psychology — the hopes and fears that can drive the short-term buying and
selling activity of speculators and investors — isn’t always easy to figure out.
This is why the short-term world of futures can be a risky and volatile one.
The bottom line is that both approaches have critical value to you since each
approach’s strengths can be used to your advantage. It is also why I tell my
clients and students to put greater emphasis on the portion of their financial
assets geared toward the longer term and a smaller portion (sometimes no
portion!) geared toward the short term.
One of the biggest factors in the short-term volatility in futures is the very fact
that futures contracts are paper assets. Since they are paper, you can create a
lot of it and a lot of it can be bought and/or sold. Since relatively few contracts
result in physical delivery, there is little standing in the way of creating more
contracts than there are physical assets. Imagine that you have a market with
one million cars (the underlying asset); what if there were two million car titles
being bought and sold? If too many car titles are being sold (going short), then
that would temporarily and unusually drive the price down. If too many car
titles are sold, then it would have the same effect upward. (The CFTC is there
to prevent excessive events such as these.) Too much paper can warp the
market price causing it to go unnaturally higher or lower as the case may be.
The bottom line is that futures can cause more radical swings in the price in
the short-term that you should be aware of.
Futures versus Options on Futures
By now, you are aware of the good, the bad, and the ugly of futures. It is a
great market but it can be a scary one as well. You’ve seen the statistics
about how 80% of all speculators lose money in futures and that some of
them end up in insane asylums singing Ethel Merman tunes while drinking
Bosco without milk (it’s tragic). Darn it . . . I don’t want you to end up like
that. So let’s add some sanity to this topic.
Futures trading is great but it’s obviously not for everyone. I think that if
beginners and those with limited funds want to experience the action of the
futures market, let me give you a strong recommendation to make your entry
into this market a little less stressing. Consider long-dated options on futures.
As I have written earlier in this chapter, options on futures can have some of
the same characteristics as futures. Generally, options are considered a short-
term market much like the futures market. But notice that I write long-dated
options. This is a reference to a category of options referred to as LEAPs.
208
Part III: Investing Vehicles 

LEAP stands for Long-term Equity AnticiPation securities. They are almost
exactly like regular options but with one small yet major difference: LEAPs
have a much longer time frame or shelf life. Typical options can be up to nine
months before expiring; LEAPs can go out three years (and sometimes
longer).
Take the above example on silver. I use silver futures contracts with deliver
dates in 2008. But there are options on other silver futures contracts that go
out to December 2009 and even into 2010 and 2011. You would have to speak
with your broker about availability since sometimes the exchange may issue
futures contracts and options for far-away dates but there may not be an
active market yet for those securities. Granted, futures may have more profit
potential, but to me the difference in profit potential is not that attractive
since options on futures has very significant profit potential (with significantly
less downside potential).
The bottom line is that long-dated options on futures (LEAPs) are a good way
to play the futures market and still have the benefit of more time so that you
can work the market as if it were an investment (albeit an aggressive one).

 Understanding how options work
 Checking out conservative, defensive, and aggressive options strategies
 Taking a look at options on metals and related investments
O
ptions are a very versatile investing vehicle. They are, in fact, excellent
adjuncts to your precious metals strategies. When I do my national sem-
inars on options it does my heart good to see bright-eyed and bushy-tailed
budding investors in the room have their faces light up when I discuss the
possibilities in their portfolios with options.
In general, options are extraordinarily versatile. They could be used for short-
term or long-term purposes. Options can be used for games or for generating
income. You can use options for speculative purposes or for defensive or 
conservative purposes. Options can be used for that home run shot where
you can make a lot of money very quickly or more to protect the position in
your portfolio. You can use options to make money in up markets or in down 
markets. Heck, you could even use options to make money on flat or boring 
markets. In my eyes, options are perfect for virtually any portfolio depending
on the type of strategy and the suitability.
Options are perfect vehicles for the portfolio of any precious metals investor
no matter how aggressive or conservative. Options can help juice up the
returns on your precious metals stocks or futures contracts, or to get help
removing some of the risk and volatility that are part and parcel of the world
of precious metals.
How Options Work
An option is a contract. That means that it doesn’t have its own value; it
derives its value from the underlying asset.

There are two types of options contracts: Calls and puts. A call gives the holder
or buyer of the options contract the right but not the obligation to buy the
underlying asset at a specific price during the life of the options contract.
The most important risk to be aware of when you buy an option, whether it’s
a call or put, is that it has a finite life and it can, if you’re not careful, expire
worthless. An example of a call option is presented in the next section.
Please keep in mind that you can get an option on virtually any marketable
securities that are assets available in the marketplace today. You’d be sur-
prised what things have options on them to be a stock exchange-traded funds
or futures contract (or other assets). There are two parties in this contract,
the buyer of the contract and the seller or writer of the contract.
The call option
A call option is a contract that allows the buyer to buy a particular security
or asset at a specific price on or before a certain date. Just like the name
implies it is an option; the person doesn’t have to buy the underlying asset
but can if she wants to. Buying a call option is basically a bet that the under-
lying asset will be going up. The call buyer is also betting that the up move
will occur before the option expires. It may sound a little complicated or
legalistic, but when you think about it, you have probably bought options 
in the past. An option is a contract that is called a derivative. A derivative is
nothing more than an investment vehicle that derives its value from some-
thing else; in the case of options, it is the underlying asset.
Examples of options
A good example of a call option is, believe it or not, a lottery ticket. A lottery
ticket doesn’t have its own value; after all, it is a small piece of paper with
printing on it that doesn’t have any intrinsic value. So why would you buy a
lottery ticket? A lottery ticket is like a call option on a set of numbers. A lot-
tery ticket derives its value from of that particular set of numbers. It is also
like options because it has a finite shelf life; that lottery ticket will expire on
the specific date whether or not those numbers come out. If those lottery
numbers do not come out then a lottery ticket is worth nothing. The lottery
ticket is worth nothing because it derives its value from numbers that are
worthless. Now how much would that lottery ticket be worth if the numbers
did come out? Obviously that lottery ticket would, at that point, be worth a
lot of money, maybe even millions. That lottery ticket would then derive its
value from some very valuable numbers. Of course, if the winning numbers
come out after the date of a lottery ticket, then that ticket will expire worthless.
Another example of a derivative is a car title. A car title has very little of its
own intrinsic value; it’s just a piece of paper with some printing on it. The car
title derives its value from the underlying asset, which is an automobile. Now
if that automobile is a brand-new luxury car with all the bells and whistles
212
Part III: Investing Vehicles 

then that car title is a very valuable piece of paper. Since the underlying asset
(a snazzy car) is very valuable, therefore that piece of paper is valuable. Now
if that car title is attached to a 1987 Ford Torino that was in several major car
crashes and had a dozen paint jobs then that car title would derive . . . uh . . .
much less value. But let’s get back to the call option.
In a call option there is a call buyer and the call writer (the seller). The call
buyer pays money (called the premium) to the call writer for the right but
not the obligation to buy the underlying asset at a specific price before the
call option expires. 
When you buy an option, whether it is a call or a put, it has a finite life. The
remaining life may be a few weeks or a few months or even a few years but 
an option will expire sooner or later. The great danger with buying an option
is that you could easily lose 100% of your money in the option if you’re not
careful. For this reason I do not call an option an investment. Buying options
is not investing; it is really speculating. Speculating is a form of financial gam-
bling and is much different than investing. Investing means you’re putting
your money into an asset (such as stock or real estate) that has changeable
value, is appropriate for your situation, and can be held for long-term. This
asset may fluctuate but if chosen wisely will keep trending upward. An
option, on the other hand, is a wasting asset; as the clock keeps ticking 
the options time value will keep shrinking until it expires.
All the possible outcomes for the option buyer
The following are all the possible outcomes for an option buyer:
 The option can expire worthless. This is the worst case. Since options
can be relatively inexpensive (versus buying the underlying investment
outright) it’s not a huge loss.
 You can exercise the option. Exercising means that you formally request
the buying (or selling) of the underlying security at the strike price.
 The option goes up a lot. You can cash out the option and make a large
profit.
 The option goes up a little. The asset is moving in your direction and
you cash out the option and still make a profit.
 The option goes down. You can still cash out the option and take a loss
and at least recoup some of your investment.
All the possible outcomes for the option writer
The following are all the possible outcomes for an option buyer:
 The option can expire worthless. You would like this outcome since it
means that you get to keep 100% of the option premium.
213
Chapter 15: Options

 You may have to fulfill your obligation. The buyer may exercise the
option, forcing you to make good on your obligation to buy or sell 
the underlying security.
 The option gains value. You can let the option trigger your obligation or
you can buy back the option at a loss.
 The option loses value. You can let the obligation keep losing money or
you can buy it back at a profit and remove your obligation.
 You want to get out of your obligation regardless. You don’t want the
risk of the option being exercised by the buyer so you buy back the option
at a loss (or gain) depending on the price of the option.
The strike price
The strike price is the agreed-upon price in the call options contract. Say that
you have an option on a stock called Juggernaut, Inc. Presume that the stock
is at $50 per share and that the strike price in the option is $55. Say that the
option will expire in nine months (for our example, assume that the expira-
tion date is December 31, 2007) and the option buyer paid $200 for this option.
The option buyer is making a bet that Juggernaut will rise toward $55 (and
hopefully exceed it) before the expiration date. In this case, the stock’s market
price ($50 per share) is $5 away from the strike price. I like to remember it as
the market price striking the target price, in this case $55. If the stock stays at
$50, or rises a little to $51 or $52, or if it falls lower, then the odds are that the
option will expire worthless. After all, what good is an option that gives you
the ability to buy the underlying asset at $55 if the market price is much lower?
As you can see, the relationship of the asset’s market price to the option’s
strike price is critical.
Is it out, in, or at the money?
In the world of options, the relationship of the asset’s market price to the
option’s strike price is referred to as being
 Out of the money: With Juggernaut at $50 and the strike price at $55, it
is out of the money (or OTM). OTM options don’t have much value.
 At the money: If Juggernaut rose to $55, it would be called at the money
(or ATM) because the market price of the asset and the strike are basi-
cally equal. ATM options are usually more valuable than OTM options.
 In the money: If Juggernaut rose to, say, $60 per share, then the option
would be referred to as being in the money (or ITM). The ability to buy a
$60 stock for only $55 (the option’s strike price) makes that a valuable
option. An ITM option would have both time and equity value.
Time and equity value
So what does the whole buyer get with the premium that he or she pays? The
call buyer gets some combination of time and equity value for the premium is
paid. This is what you get, given the three different types of options:
214
Part III: Investing Vehicles 

 Out of the money (OTM). The premium you pay for an OTM option is
100% time value. There is no equity value. You have paid for the duration
of the option’s life span. An OTM is the riskiest option because basically
you’re hoping the underlying asset will hit the strike before it expires.
OTM options are the cheapest options but also the riskiest. Fortunately,
the full amount at risk is only the premium you paid for the option, which
is probably not that much. Because with an OTM option you are buying
time, the longer the option period, the more time you are paying for. A
one-year option, for example, is more valuable than a six-month option.
In a nutshell, an OTM option is 100% time value and 0% equity value.
 At the money (ATM). Because the market price of the asset and the
option’s strike price are equal or at parity, the value of the option is defi-
nitely higher than the OTM (all things being equal). An ATM option has a
greater chance of becoming an in the money option, of course, than the
OTM option. The value of the ATM is still more time value than equity
value but at least it has some equity value. How much equity value it has
will depend on the marketplace.
 In the money (ITM). Because the market price of the asset is higher than
the option’s strike price, the value of the option is higher than either the
ATM or the OTM. The OTM option will have plenty of equity value and
will still have some time value, of course, depending on how much time
is left.
Keep in mind that the time premium is the amount buyers are willing to pay
for the options contract above its intrinsic value on the chance that, at some
time prior to its expiration, it will move into the money. Out-of-the-money
options all carry time premium since their intrinsic value is zero, as is that 
of at-the-money options.
The time premium for the in-the-money options contract is the amount that
exceeds the option’s intrinsic value and reflects the possibility that the options
contract may move deeper into-the-money. The time value of an options con-
tract shrinks as the expiration date approaches, with less and less time for a
major change in market opinion, and a decreasing likelihood that the options
contract will increase in value (see Table 15-1).

Chapter 15: Options

The put option
The put option is making a bet that the underlying asset is going down in
price (see Table 15-2). Officially, a put option is a contract that gives the
buyer (or holder) the right to sell a certain quantity (such as 100 shares of
stock) of an underlying asset (such as stock or a commodity) to the writer
(or seller) of the options contract at a specified price (the strike price) on
any business day during the life of the option.

Resources for beginners
The best places for information on options for beginners are the options
exchanges and their trade association. I have visited their Web sites and
there is a tremendous amount of free educational materials, tutorials, publi-
cations, and so on. And for good reason . . . the exchanges make money 
each time an option is transacted. The more people doing more options
transactions makes for a happy exchange. Given this, you might as well take
advantage of the great stuff they offer.
 Chicago Board Options Exchange (www.cboe.com): This is the place to
turn to for extensive information regarding options on stocks, stock
indexes, and exchange-traded funds.
 New York Mercantile Exchange (www.nymex.com): Offers extensive
information on futures and options on futures.
 Options Industry Council (www.888options.com): Lots of publications
as well as free audio and video online programs well suited for beginners.
Working Out Your Options
If you want to go forward with options, you will need to open an account first.
The account will need to be funded and approved for options.
216
Part III: Investing Vehicles 

For options on stocks, stock indexes, and ETFs, a standard stock brokerage
account will suffice. For options on commodities/futures, you will need a
futures brokerage account.
Understanding the orders
When you are ready to make your options order, the brokerage firm has infor-
mation, customer service, and so on to help you. Just keep in mind the fol-
lowing order types to make sure you are transacting what you truly want:
 Buy to open: When you initially buy an option (put or call), you are
essentially paying for a contract that you are opening. This is called
buying to open.
 Sell to open: When you are writing an option (put or call), you will receive
income (as in selling) for opening a contract. This is called selling to open.
 Buy to close: When you want to end or close out an option that you had
initially sold then you need to buy back your option to close it out. This
is called buying to close. This completes the option described in #2
above.
 Sell to close: When you want to cash in an option that you had initially
bought, then you need to close out the options contract. This is called
selling to close. This completes the option described in #1 above.
Something for Everyone
The great thing about options is not only their tremendous versatility and
profit potential but also their ability to generate income and even act as
insurance. In this section there are important points for investors and specu-
lators and even worrywarts.
For those seeking gains
If you’re going to speculate, there’s probably no better way than with options.
With unlimited upside and limited downside then you have some powerful
speculative advantages. I remember buying some options on silver futures 
in 2005 that I bought for only $600 when silver was $7 an ounce. Within six
months, silver went over $10 an ounce and each of the silver futures options
was worth $10,000! This is the power of leverage.
As I mention, options are technically not an investment. They have a limited
life and you must do something with them before they expire. It’s hard to
invest with something that typically has a life span of only nine months.
217
Chapter 15: Options

That’s why I like to invest using LEAPs. LEAPs are Long Term Equity
AnticiPation Securities. They are the same in almost every way to regular,
conventional options with one basic difference: the time span. LEAPs can 
be up to three years.
Income strategy #1: Writing covered calls
When you write a covered call option you are doing so on a stock that you
own. For every 100 shares of an optionable stock that you own, you can write
(sell) a covered call and you will receive income (the premium) in exchange
for an obligation to sell your stock at the strike price.
Say you own 200 shares of General Electric (GE). On July 17, 2007, the stock
price was at $40.71. On that day you could have written a September 2007
call with a strike price of $42.50 and received income of $60 (leaving out the
brokerage commission to keep it simple). Since a call contract is tied to a
round lot of 100 shares, you could write two calls (since you own 200 shares
of GE) and receive income of $120. In return, you take on the obligation to sell
your GE stock for $42.50 on any business day starting July 17 up to the third
Friday in September 2007 (September 21).
It is a risk-free transaction for you in that there is no risk of financial loss. If 
GE rises significantly between now and September ’07, the worst that happens
is that you sell your stock for $42.50, which is a higher stock price than the
$40.71 price back on July 17. In addition, you made the $120 income from 
the premium.
If GE stays flat or goes down during that time frame, you get to keep the stock
and the $120 from writing the two calls. Owning the GE stock has the usual
risk of stock ownership; it can go up, down, or stay at the same level. Writing
the covered call itself was a risk-free way to generate income from your stock
holding.
Covered call-writing is a safe strategy because you own the underlying stock
and you simply relinquish the stock if it hits the strike price during the life of
the option. In others the call obligation is covered. However, it is possible to
write an uncovered (or naked) call. This transaction is the same in every way
to the covered call except in one crucial way: you don’t own the stock. You
could still generate the $120 (in this example) but if GE rises and hits $42.50,
you have the obligation to provide the 200 shares. Since you didn’t own the
stock, you’d have to buy it at the market price (whatever price it is) and then
sell the stock for the $42.50. If GE rose to $50 a share, you’d end up losing $7.50
per share (on a 200-share transaction, you’d lose $150). In a naked call you
gamble to make the option income but you risk having a loss that is poten-
tially far higher. Most retail investors are not allowed to do naked call-writing
because of the potential loss involved.
218
Part III: Investing Vehicles 

Income strategy #2: Writing puts
If you write a put, you will receive the premium income but in exchange you
take on the obligation of buying stock if it hits the strike price. To be allowed
to write a put in a stock brokerage account, you would need to have enough
cash (or marginable securities) in your account to handle the potential 
purchase. This is referred to as a cash-secured put. If you are using margin-
able securities, that is referred to as a portfolio-secured put. So-called naked
puts — writing puts without sufficient cash or marginable securities in the
account — are not allowed for most retail investors.
You should only write puts on stocks that you personally would enjoy owning.
Writing a put option on a mining stock when it’s at $35 and the put option’s
strike price is at $30 means that (in the worst case) you end up buying that
stock at the bargain $30 price. The great thing is that the premium helped
make the purchase more affordable. If you got $100 for writing the put and
you need to buy the stock, you really only had to shell out $2,900 for those
100 shares ($3,000 total purchase price less $100 premium).
Minimizing Risks with Options
In earlier chapters (such as Chapter 11) I briefly discuss the defensive merits
of stop-loss orders and the active strategy of trailing stops. (I discuss these 
in great detail in Stock Investing For Dummies.) But a great way to protect
your stock position without having to sell the stock is to buy a put on your
own stock. In this instance, the put that you bought would be referred to as 
a protective put. It becomes a form of insurance.
Say you own 100 shares of Gold Corp. (GG). On July 17, 2007, GG stock was at
$25.85 per share. Let’s say that you are nervous about market conditions for
GG during the summer but you don’t want to sell the stock because you bought
it a few years earlier for only $8 a share and you don’t want to generate a cap-
ital gain and worry about the tax on the potentially large gain (the market
price less the $8 original cost). Instead of selling, you could buy a put for that
time period to give you some protection. You could buy an out-of-the-money
put with a strike price of $22.50 that expires in October ’07 for only $60 or an
at-the-money $25 put (same month) for $140, depending on your expectation
or budget. The bottom line is that you could buy insurance in the form of a
protective put for very little money.
219
Chapter 15: Options

Some Profitable Combinations
Options are very versatile and once you figure out the ins and outs of a call
option and a put option, then consider moving to the next level, combina-
tions. There are literally dozens of options combinations. You can structure
combinations to give you some exceptional profit potential.
The zero-cost collar
This is one of my favorite combinations and it is an ideal strategy for those
who are worried about some positions in their portfolios. It is done on a
stock that you own and hold in your stock brokerage account.
It is the act of buying a put option and selling a call option on your stock.
Let’s say that you have 100 shares of Kabluki Corp. (KC) stock and it’s $30 a
share. Say the market is getting you concerned about your KC stock. Table
15-3 shows you the zero-cost collar for it.

Take a look at some of the advantages. First of all, the zero-cost collar is pro-
tection that can be structured to cost nothing (I like that part). If KC stays flat
or trades sideways, the options could expire. But . . . you don’t mind because
the collar was zero-cost.
220
Part III: Investing Vehicles 

What happens if your concern is realized? Although your KC stock would fall,
the zero-cost collar helps offset the loss with a double profit. When KC falls,
the put would increase in value and the call would lose value. The put would
be profitable. Now about that call, keep in mind that you didn’t buy it; you
sold it. Therefore, you don’t mind it losing value. Now you can buy it back at
a profit.
The drawback for the zero-cost collar is if the stock goes up significantly
during the options period. Because part of the combination was a covered
call, that limited your upside since you would have to end up selling the
stock at the strike price of $32.50.
The straddle
This is a simple combination. It is buying both an at-the-money call and an 
at-the-money put (both have the same expiration date) on the same security
or asset. Table 15-4 uses the example of XYZ Mining Corp. stock (price:
$50/share) to illustrate the straddle.

The basic point behind the straddle is very simple. You don’t care where XYZ
goes (up or down); you just want the stock’s price to go somewhere and to
get there very fast. Certainly you want it to happen long before the call and
put options expire. Options strategies can be bullish, bearish, or . . . in this
case . . . neutral. The buyer of the straddle combination is neutral and is 
actually seeking high volatility, a big move in either direction.
221
Chapter 15: Options

The bottom line is that you’re hoping (in this example) that XYZ goes far
enough (up or down) that one of the options in the straddle will be worth
more than the two options combined. If, for example, XYZ skyrockets to $70
then the call will be very valuable while the put would be almost worthless.
In the case of a $70 stock price, the call option would be worth at least $2,000
while the put option’s value would be close to zero. In valuing the straddle,
we can say that it went from a total value of $600 to an ending value of $2,000
(the $2,000 call plus the $0 put).
Keep in mind that technically the option combination that I just described is
the long straddle. It is labeled long because you bought both options. Yes . . .
there is a short straddle but that goes beyond the scope of this chapter. Any
and all the options terms, combinations, and so on are described more fully
through the resources referenced.
Options in the World of Precious Metals
The first half of this chapter goes into the generic world of options. That is
necessary so that this section has more meaning for you. There are many
ways to play precious metals, and few vehicles give you as much oomph as
options and when you combine precious metals with options you get . . . 
uh . . . ultra-oomph!
Options on mining stocks
The most obvious place to start is with the mining stocks, of course. There
are many mining stocks with options available on them. Some of the stocks
have a limited number of options issued and available for investors (many
may have only 30 to 40 options going out nine months at most). Some of the
larger and more active companies have 75 to 150 (or more) options available
and stretching out two years or more (LEAPs).
Here are some examples of mining stocks with plenty of long-term options 
on them:
As of July 2007, the gold-mining company Gold Corp. (GG) had options
available all the way out to January 2010 (a full two and a half years of
time value). By the time you read these words, there will be options on
that stock going out to 2011 or beyond.
As of July 2007, the silver mining company Pan American Silver (PAAS)
also has options stretching out to January 2010.
As of July 2007, Cameco (CCJ), the world’s largest uranium miner, had
options available with expiration dates of January 2009.

These are mentioned as illustrative examples of what you can find. To find
more, use the resources in Chapter 12 (on mining stocks) to locate and 
analyze the mining stocks. The same resources can tell you if they have 
publiclytraded options available. If the answer is yes then you can go to the
Chicago Board Options Exchange (www.cboe.com) and do your search. At
the Web site you can simply enter the stock symbol of your choice and up
will come the options available for you to buy (or write).
An option with no expiration?
As you know by now, options are a derivative. But some stocks, especially
those in the natural resource sector, can be considered derivatives of the
resources they are involved with. Last year I bought a stock that had substan-
tial nickel reserves at about the time that industry reports mentioned supply
problems with . . . you guessed it . . . nickel.
That stock quickly shot up from under $2 a share to over $5 in a few weeks
for a solid gain of over 150%. That was a small company and it had no pub-
licly traded options. However, the stock acted like an option on the underly-
ing asset. In that case, $200 would have gotten you 100 shares and the best
part is that, unlike options, there is no expiration date.
Options on ETFs and indexes
Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are explained in detail in Chapter 13 but I bring
them up here because they are great underlying assets for options investors
and speculators. Why make a bet on an individual security when you can bet
on an entire industry or sector? You have the same options capabilities as
with stocks. You can buy or sell options (calls or puts).
ETFs with options
The following are ETFs with options available (go to www.cboe.com for
details):
PowerShares DB Base Metals Fund (DBB)
PowerShares DB Precious Metals Fund (DBP)
PowerShares DB Silver Fund (DBS)
PowerShares DB Gold Fund (DGL)
PowerShares DB Commodity Index Tracking Fund (DBC)

Indexes with options
There are indexes that have options available on them. A good example of
one is found at the Chicago Board Options Exchange: the CBOE Gold Index
(GOX). It is an equal-dollar weighted index composed of 10 companies
involved primarily in gold mining and production.
Options on futures
For those who want the speculative, high-flying, ultra-aggressive, no guts, no
glory home-run or strike-out type of vehicle, then you may want to consider
options on futures. Check out Table 15-5 for a list of options on regular futures.

Golden Rules for Options Success
After watching this stuff for a few decades, teaching thousands of students,
and actively doing this day-in and day-out, you get to see what works and
what doesn’t work. Options are no different and there are points you can take
to heart and apply to your own approach. After reading everything in this
chapter (along with the referenced resources), here are my golden rules for
options success:
 Understand the risk in your strategy. One speculator (I’ll call her Betty)
whom I know of got a hot tip about Google and she immediately bought
350 call options. Google didn’t go the way she expected and she lost over
$20,000. Yikes! The options she bought had only two month of time! That
wasn’t speculating . . . that was outright gambling. She might as well have
taken the money to the local casino. Betty didn’t realize the risk of too
little time. Also, why risk so much and so quickly?
225
Chapter 15: Options

Sometimes the risk is not only in the vehicle (very short-term options)
but also in the person. Impatience and acting without full information
can be the kiss of death for your wealth-building aspirations.
 Decide what is the most amount you will put at risk. In the previous
example, Betty sadly told me afterward that the total amount she lost
was a huge portion of her financial assets. It caused her hardship. As I
have said before, buying options is a speculative pursuit and you should
know from the start how much you are willing to risk and no more. You
should ask yourself “Will my lifestyle change drastically if I lose this
money?” If that question makes you pause then you may be risking too
great a portion of your financial assets. For most people, 5% to 10% of
your financial assets is a comfortable limit. As you grow in experience,
confidence, and skill, you can certainly do more.
Options buyers should get the longest time available and a strike price
that is as close as possible.
What do you think has less risk — a two-month option or a two-year
option? The more time, the better for you. What has a greater chance 
to be profitable — an at-the-money option or an out-of-the-money? The
closer the strike price is to the market price, the better your chance of
success. However, there is a better strategy: both! Your chance for suc-
cess grows tremendously in your favor when the option you have has
lots of time value and a strike price that is as close as possible to the
market price.
 Options sellers should write options that are out-of-the-money and
expire soon. For those who are seeking income and want to minimize
the risk of covered call-writing (the chance that your asset could rise to
hit the strike price and subsequently trigger the sale of your asset) then
you need to do the mirror opposite of the call buyers’ golden rule (see
previous paragraph). In covered call-writing you need to write options
that are comfortably out-of-the-money and will expire in a relatively
short period of time.
 Don’t wait too long to cut your losses. Depending on the type of asset
and the length of the option period, the options buyer should not wait
until the final 30-60 days of the option’s remaining time value. Again,
options are wasting assets and they have the tendency to lose value dra-
matically in the final weeks. If you cash out the option while it still has
some time value then you can recoup some money and put the funds to
work elsewhere.
 Take profits sooner if you’ve written options. Say that you wrote a cov-
ered call and you got some nice premium. If that stock had made a
sudden yet temporary drop in price, consider taking some profits by
buying back your covered call. Why wait? Make a profit and now your
stock is free and clear and available for the next covered call option.
 Focus on one area and become an expert in that area. Ironically, the
best advice I could give for options success actually is not even an out-
right options-related recommendation. Remember the point earlier in the
226
Part III: Investing Vehicles 

chapter that options are derivatives. Options derive their value from the
underlying asset so it behooves you to become as knowledgeable and as
proficient as possible in that underlying asset. Nine times out of ten, when
you see someone who consistently succeeds with options it is usually
due to the fact that the investor or speculator focuses on that singular
area and gets really good at understanding that particular market.
 Be patient. Maybe it’s a sign of the times and how people’s behavior and
attitudes have changed. Investors today are way too impatient and they
are not allowing their strategies and investment choices enough time to
bear fruit. Frankly, it has me scratching my head. It makes me compare
today’s investors with investors from the good ol’ days. When I first
started my financial planning business (1981 — I hope I don’t look that
old) investors had a more realistic attitude toward time and money. Back
then long-term was over five years, intermediate term was one-to-five
years, and short-term was one year or less. Today, I think that investors
measure long-term in months, intermediate term in weeks, and short-
term in days. I asked one client what his idea of short-term was and he
responded, “What time is it?”
Long-term investors and speculators have an easier time making money.
When I say “long-term” that doesn’t necessarily mean you have wait 57
years for something good to happen. It doesn’t even have to mean a rigid
time frame. It means giving the market enough time to discover what you
have. One client I had bought a uranium stock in 2005. It went up nicely
that year but then during 2006 it stayed in a narrow trading range of $35-
$39 for many months. His impatience resulted in the sale of that stock
but guess what? Within a few months that stock shot up to $56 a share
for a gain of 43% in less than five months. The call options on that stock
did even better. Over the years I have seen many situations where impa-
tience led some to prematurely sell (or buy) something, needlessly
resulting in a loss or missed opportunities.
Options Resources
You can find lots of great educational resources on options at the library and
on the Internet. Here are some that you shouldn’t miss:
 Educational resources:
• There are free and/or low-cost seminars on options. The Options
Industry Council conducts free options seminars across the coun-
try. You can get on their mailing list by calling them at 888-OPTIONS

Chapter 16
Choosing a Trading Approach
In This Chapter
 Preparing to trade
 Deciding on a trading vehicle
 Taking a look at your outlook as well as trading strategies
N
ow for the fast-moving stuff. No one can say that trading is boring. It’s
exciting — you just want any discussion on trading to remove the words
“losing,” “terrifying,” and “depressing.” Of course, trading can be profitable.
Some have successfully turned trading into a full-time pursuit, which takes lots
of preparation and the right frame of mind because it can be stressful at times.
For a trader, “risk” and “volatility” aren’t just words — they’re a way of life.
Before you delve fully into the trading lifestyle, prepare yourself by first going
through this chapter. In this chapter, I explain the various ways to prepare
before you even begin trading as well as provide you with trading techniques
to choose from. Preparing yourself and choosing the technique that best fits
you should make the exciting life of trading more profitable and, well, exciting.
Being a Boy Scout — Being Prepared
You get the greatest benefit from trading before you risk a single copper cent
(well, it was copper but now it is an even baser metal) by simply preparing.
Preparing for your trading pursuits puts you one step closer to successful
trading. The sections that follow give you an idea of how to begin thorough
preparations.
Know the difference between trading and investing. You’re trading, which 
is a short-term play on the price moves of the asset. Whatever you’re putting
your money in you will be exiting this position relatively quickly. You just 
want someone to buy your stuff at a greater price and sooner rather than later.
Investing means you’re putting your money into an asset that has value today
and that will essentially have long-term appreciation. This difference dictates

your approach, and it dictates which trading philosophy will dominate your
actions: fundamental or technical analysis. For traders, “price action” is the
name of the game.
Be a voracious reader
Paraphrasing the Bible, there is nothing new under the sun, and this is true 
in the world of trading. The technology may have changed radically, but the
principles have remained the same. The successes and failures and strategies
are there to learn from. The same way that investors should read the works
of Benjamin Graham and Warren Buffet, traders should be reading about the
exploits, strategies, and principles of great traders such as Jesse Livermore.
Two books worth checking out are Reminiscences of a Stock Operator by Edwin
Lefevre (Wiley) and How to Trade in Stocks, which is in Jesse Livermore’s own
words but re-published by McGraw-Hill (the copyright is owned by Richard
Smitten). Livermore was a very colorful character and he became the ultimate
rags-to-riches trader as he made and lost four fortunes during the 1920s and
’30s before he committed suicide in 1940. The amazing thing is that he started
trading as a teenager starting with five dollars (of course, five dollars was
worth something back then), and he went on to make millions.
In today’s market, some of the well-known traders include long-time veterans
such as Larry Williams, Dick Diamond, and Roger Wiegand. There are more
trading resources at the end of the chapter.
Have your plan
Making a trade with guesswork or your best hunch isn’t enough. Certainly not
if you want to build wealth over time. You need to decide on a “framework” for
your trading activity. Your plan needs to have clear and detailed answers to
questions such as
 How much risk capital will you be playing the trading game with?
 What is your outlook on the asset in question (bullish, bearish, or neutral?
 Will you be focused in a single specialty or diversified in different 
assets (such as stocks, options, futures, or in different industries or 
commodities)?
 At what point will you enter a trade? What signals will you use (such as
technical indicators explained in Chapter 18) as your entry points?
 How long will you stay in your position? Will it be a fixed time period or
until a particular event occurs (such as when it hits a certain price)?
232
Part IV: Investment Strategies 

 Will you be doing any hedging (a way to reduce risk by having positions
in your account that go up if your main positions go down — more on
this later)? If so, what kind of hedge?
 What will you do if the position goes down in price during your time
period? Buy more or get out?
 If you buy more at the lower price, what will you do if the asset’s price
goes down even further? What price level or loss percentage will you 
tolerate before you decide to cut losses?
 At what point do you cash out profitable trades? Is there a specific
amount or is it based on market events (such as technical indicators or
news from the industry)? Will your advisory service or software tell you?
 At what point will you say “I can’t take it anymore! I’m getting a job!”
You know what I mean. There are questions that no amount of research or
professional guidance can answer for you. Much of what you do will be your
own preferences and trading objectives. The point is to address these issues
since the market will make mincemeat of traders who are throwing darts.
Decide your market
Until you are proficient and experienced with markets in general, your best
bet is to get thoroughly familiar with a particular asset. Trading gold and
silver futures is fine, but beginners shouldn’t trade gold and silver along with
grains, pork bellies, and natural gas. Commodities can be specialized and the
more you stretch yourself over more different markets the less time you will
be able to become an expert in the markets that count.
Many of my clients and students will get extremely knowledgeable about a
particular market and then apply their trading strategies to take advantage 
of what they researched and studied. I know one trader who researched the
oil market and turned $90,000 into $1.4 million in about 18 months during
2004–2005. He used bullish trading strategies such as buying call options 
that skyrocketed as oil prices nearly doubled during that time period. He did
focused research (specialized in one market) and focused activity (buying
call options), which paid off handsomely.
Specializing in one market will make it much easier to succeed. After the
learning curve to find out what’s going on then you can monitor the market
and implement your trades in minutes.
Fortunately, precious metals investments have a lot to offer. You can specialize
in different metals (precious or base) and in different vehicles (stocks, futures,
and/or options). What will you concentrate on?
233
Chapter 16: Choosing a Trading Approach

Practice with simulated trading
The various tools available to help you become more proficient are fantastic. In
terms of technology, resources, and brokerage services available, it is a better
time to be a trader than ever before. You can practically automate the process.
The first thing to do before you commit funds to your trading activity is to do
some simulated trading to get a comfort level before you actually trade.
Picking Out Your Vehicle
I’m not putting the cart before the horse, or, er, the car before the profits. Yes,
you will get a chance to pick out a shiny new toy if you make wise choices in
trading, but this section deals with the trading vehicles you put your money
in. Whether you are bullish, bearish, or neutral on precious metals, there are
great choices for trading vehicles. The following sections discuss the main
vehicles that are very tradeable:
Stocks
Done in a stock brokerage account, stock trading can be affordable and there
are plenty of precious metals and base metals stocks that are tradeable. You
can probably start with a few thousand dollars and should only concentrate
on a few stocks so you can watch them like a hawk. Choose them based on
fundamentals and use technical analysis for your entry and exit points.
Fortunately, most good brokers have a fully featured Web site and relatively
low commissions. Services such as automated trailing stops and stock alerts
that you can program make it easier for your trading activity. This venue can
be as aggressive or as conservative as you prefer. Chapter 12 has more
details for you.
Futures
Trading in futures contracts is, of course, the riskiest choice among the
trade-able vehicles. For a taste of volatility and a chance to make a great
profit in a relatively short time frame (in days or weeks), trading futures is
the one for you. You can either be aggressive or . . . very aggressive! For
beginners, a good approach would be to do spreads to limit your risk as you
gain knowledge and experience. The lowest appropriate amount to do futures
is risk capital in the range of $10,000 to $20,000. For more information on
futures, go to Chapter 14.
234
Part IV: Investment Strategies 

Options
This is my favorite area for traders (considering all the options seminars I do,
it better be!). It has both the potential for large returns and the opportunity to
take advantage of volatility. Combine this with limited risk, relatively low cost,
and versatility (you can do options on stocks, ETFs, or futures contracts).
Selecting Your Trading Strategy
The following sections indicate some trading strategies as they are matched
up with your outlook. This is probably a better way to choose your strategy
than to load you up with a batch of paragraphs (you’re welcome!). I limit my
examples with two tables: one on stocks with options and the second covers
futures contracts with options. These tables provide a good cross-section for
beginners.
Choosing your market outlook
Yogi Berra said, “When you come to a fork in the road, take it.” Of course, 
in today’s market, that fork (probably made of base metals) gives you two
options: buy or sell. Everyone has an idea about “where the market is going
and what to expect for that asset’s next price move.” There are as many trading
ideas and strategies as there are traders. What is your outlook? Your strategies
(for either short-term trading or long-term investing) flow from your outlook:
bullish, bearish, or neutral.
Secondly, you should decide the degree to which you have your outlook. 
For example, say that you are bullish. That’s your outlook but how bullish 
are you? Are you very bullish or moderately bullish? This would affect your
trading approach. If you think a stock will do well then certainly, you can buy
the stock. If you were very bullish on the stock then you can buy multiple call
options on the stock with the same money. If you were moderately bullish,
then you could buy the stock and put on a trailing stop to limit the downside
while keeping the upside unlimited (of course, if the stock goes down that
could trigger the trailing stop and get you out). You get the picture.
Stock trading coupled with options
Say you are looking to trade stocks (and options on stocks). Your strategies
will focus on a particular stock, the Mining Trading Corp. (MTC), which is 
$20 per share and you have a stock brokerage account funded with $2,000.
Presume that the calls and puts that you would buy (or write) are all long-term

efore your roll up your sleeves and leap into some precious metals invest-
ments, it will be highly important to choose a broker or dealer who will
help you make the transaction. Besides the fact that you don’t want the broker
to make you . . . uh . . . broker, a good broker is a critical part of your investing
arsenal. Good brokers can save you money and make sure that your strategy is
implemented. Bad brokers can lose you money and drive you crazy.
Believe me. I’ve been through brokers who brought tears to my eyes (and not
because I was buying onion futures!). A good broker helps you make money.
You have to watch out for creeps and morons. And, of course, avoid the worst
of all . . . creepy morons. This chapter should guide you as you sift through
the good, the bad, and the ugly when it comes to brokers.
Getting Down Some General Points
In the world of securities, you will need an individual or a firm (the broker) to
help you buy, sell, and/or manage securities for your portfolio. Here is a simple
breakdown for whom you need for what securities:
 Buying physical precious metal coins, bullion, and so on. Let me get this
out of the way first. This is handled in other chapters. For bullion coins
and bars, go to Chapter 10. For numismatic coins and collectibles, go to
Chapter 11.
 If you are looking into buying mining stocks, exchange-traded funds
(ETFs), or options on these securities, you will need a stock brokerage
account.
 If you want to get into futures (commodities) or options on these specu-
lative vehicles, you will need a futures brokerage account.

 If you are considering a managed futures account (described later in this
chapter), that will require a futures brokerage account.
A stock brokerage account is an easy account to understand since buying
stocks is a familiar and a pervasive part of our financial landscape. However,
it can be a little confusing when it comes to an account in the world of
futures and commodities. The words “futures” and “commodities” are used
interchangeably but they are distinctly different things. Before you try to
decide on a broker, you should first decide what you will get involved with.
If you are going to speculate in the world of futures, then get familiar with the
market before you open an account. You can start with reading Chapter 14. If
stock investing is your interest, then read Chapter 12.
Both stock and futures accounts have a lot of commonality (margin, order
types, and so on) but for the sake of accuracy and orderliness, I will put them
in different segments since enough differences exist. The first thing to tackle
is a futures brokerage account.
Futures Brokers and Accounts
If you are going to speculate with futures and options on futures, you will
need a futures brokerage account. You will read a lot about investing in the
literature and Web sites and I am even using that term in context, but please
notice that I try to use the term “speculate” and not “invest” since this is an
area that is high-flying, volatile, risky, and can in some ways like financial
gambling. Even if you are very comfortable and proficient with futures and
options on futures, you should devote only a relatively small amount of your
total financial assets in this roller-coaster world.
I find it okay to price-shop brokerage accounts for stock investing but I don’t
feel the same way about futures. It’s important to have a professional broker
who is experienced with the ebb and flow of this market. You want someone
who has integrity and who can implement your trades according to your
strategy. In terms of how they relate to you, there are two types of futures
brokerage accounts, full-service and discount.
Full-service futures broker
In a nutshell, you will pay more for a full-service broker but you will get more
services. In futures, a broker with experience, expertise, and resources can
be valuable. The broker involved works with you to help you choose strategy
and implement transactions. He or she offers advice and research on the 
various markets. The full-service futures broker also provides feedback on
developments that can affect futures in general and the positions in your
account in particular, such as the day’s news and events.
240
Part IV: Investment Strategies 

Discount futures broker
The discount brokerage firm will basically place your orders for you with 
no guidance or advice. You get fewer services so that you end up paying less
in fees and commissions. Ultimately you will do your own research and due
diligence. A discount broker is a good choice for confident, experienced 
individuals who just want an inexpensive way to trade.
Both types of brokers usually offer good Web sites with content and links
that can help you be more informed with your speculating. As a financial
planner who does all of his own, hands-on investing, I am very comfortable
with a stock discount broker but I prefer a full-service futures broker. I
believe that beginners and intermediate level investors and speculators are
better off with a full-service broker because of all the reasons and risks 
mentioned in this chapter as well as in Chapter 14. And hey . . . if you get
really good at it you can always move on to discount brokers.
Let me put another wrinkle in this topic about the different types of brokers.
Whether the broker is full service or discount, you should know something
about what type of brokerage firm it is from an industry and regulatory 
perspective.
The futures commission merchant (FCM)
The FCM is an organization that provides the principal order clearing ser-
vices for the futures industry. In other words, they are the main organizations
through which the buy and sell orders of futures contracts (and options 
on them) are made. FCMs are members of the individual futures exchanges
such as the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) and the Chicago Board
of Trade (CBOT), among others. You can actually see a complete listing of
FCMs at the Web site of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (www.
cftc.gov).
Introducing broker (IB)
Unless you are working with the retail division at the FCM, you are likely to
work with an introducing broker (IB). The IB can be a full service or a dis-
count brokerage firm that works through the FCM. The transactions done by
the IB are cleared through the FCM. The IB may or may not be a recognizable
name but it provides the service you seek (either full service or discount).
Although IBs can be large firms, they tend to be smaller firms which means
the service can be more personalized.
241
Chapter 17: Finding and Using a Broker

Selecting a Broker
Unless you get a referral to a broker from someone you trust, such as a close
friend or your tax or legal advisor, you’ll end up doing some research to find
a broker for your futures business. There are several places to start.
Commodities Futures Trading 
Commission (CFTC)
The CFTC has consumer information on futures and futures brokers. You can
visit them at www.cftc.gov.
National Futures Association (NFA)
I highly recommend that investors visit their Web site at www.nfa.futures.
org for several reasons. They do provide information and guidance on
choosing brokers. In addition, you can find out if there are any complaints 
or problems with brokers in question. If you have been victimized, you can
file a complaint. Even though it is a private entity, the NFA does work as a 
regulatory body that can discipline wayward brokers.
In addition, the NFA does have educational resources and links for the 
investing public.
Futures Industry Association (FIA)
The Futures Industry Association (FIA) is the trade group for futures brokers. 
It offers a wealth of information at its Web site (www.futuresindustry.org),
including an extensive directory of brokers, futures information services, and
links to futures-related companies, programs, and educational resources.
The exchanges
The futures exchanges also provide information on choosing a broker. A good
example is the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. It runs a service called the “Find
a Broker Program” at its Web site, www.cme.org. Other exchanges that have
lots of useful information are
 Chicago Board of Trade (www.cbot.com)
 New York Mercantile Exchange (www.nymex.com)

Part IV: Investment Strategies 

Keeping your eyes peeled for ICE
When you are selecting a broker, you are basically choosing someone for
your financial team in the same way you choose a tax advisor or insurance
broker. It will hopefully be a long-term relationship. You obviously need
someone whom you are comfortable with. Let me share with you what I look
for when I’m meeting people whom I hope to do business with. I look for
people who have ICE in their veins. What is ICE?
Integrity: They must have integrity or why bother working with them?
Competence: If they are true professionals, then they should know what
they are doing.
Enthusiasm: Do they enjoy what they are doing? If they don’t, how will
they get good at it? If they are not enthusiastic about their work, there’s 
a good chance they won’t be doing this line of work in due course.
After going through several brokers and firms, I finally found my broker
Charlie. He’s been my futures broker since 2003. He treated me well and it
paid off for him because I sent him dozens of clients. In my book, he has ICE
in his veins (kinda catchy, isn’t it?).
That’s probably a good lesson for anyone in business. If you treat people
well, they will not only stick with you but they will also send you business.
Dealing with Futures
I personally like options on futures versus futures directly. Yes . . . find out as
much as possible about futures, but options on futures offer much of the
same potential but with less risk. When I buy an option on a futures contract
and the futures contract goes down the next day, I don’t worry about a
margin call. And if it’s a cloudy day . . . I stay home and play Parcheesi. The
sections that follow should give you a good look at choosing and using a
futures broker.
Interviewing a futures broker
After you get past “What’s your name?” and “How ‘bout those Mets!” you
start getting into that uncomfortable silence. Have no fear! This Dummies
guide is here. Here are some questions that should merit some answers:
243
Chapter 17: Finding and Using a Broker

 How many years of experience do you have working futures? You would
like three or more years (but not 87).
 Do you have an area of futures that you specialize in? Some brokers 
specialize in metals; for others it is currencies or grains. Make sure they
have proficient knowledge in your desired markets.
 Does your approach embrace fundamental analysis, technical analysis,
or a mix of both? You should know something about their knowledge of
these areas and what they favor as an approach.
 What size account are you comfortable working with?
 What are your firm’s requirements for margin? Can you give me some
examples of how margin would work with my account?
 What are the commissions and fees and what services are provided?
 What is your track record (provided they have done discretionary trading
for clients)?
 How are disputes or concerns handled at this firm?
Margin in a futures account
Margin in a futures account is a tad more complicated than margin in a stock
brokerage account. Well . . . a big tad indeed.
For the futures broker, margin is a performance bond. In the area of futures,
the volatility in market prices from day to day can be great. Since you put
down money roughly equal to 20% (sometimes more) of the futures contract,
it is possible that the futures contract market price goes against you. The
margin in a futures account acts as a good faith deposit to cover swings in
the market value of the contract. If the market price change is significant and
adverse, you may be required to put more money in the account (the margin
call) to maintain the necessary margin. Keep in mind that in futures, the
margin you put down is not a down payment on a futures contract. A futures
contract is not an asset you own; it is a liability, especially if the market
moves against you. The margin is a good faith amount sitting in your account
just in case you are wrong about the performance of the futures contract
market price.
The margin is effectively an estimate of your possible loss in the next trading
session (the next day) escrowed in advance. Because no one knows in
advance which way the market could move, margin is posted by both the
buyer and the seller.
Because the rules for margin can differ from broker to broker, work through
some what-if scenarios with your chosen broker given the market you are
looking to trade.
244
Part IV: Investment Strategies 

Avoiding problems in your account
Churning is a problem that you need to watch out for. Churning is when a
broker performs a high level of activity (buying and selling) in the account for
the (unspoken) purpose of generating commission income. Sometimes it
doesn’t seem evident in a commodities account since it can be quite normal
to see lots of trading transactions in a relatively short period of time. You
must be most wary of churning especially when you have given the broker
discretionary trading authority in that account.
A new client came to me after closing out an account with a dubious firm
located in Florida. He started the account with $60,000 and got out four
months later with $57,000. Getting out with a net loss of $3,000 is not the end
of the world . . . but that’s not the story. The real eye-opener came when
Charlie (my broker) analyzed the account’s activity. The statements indicated
over $17,000 of commissions during that brief four-month period! Gee . . .
maybe if my new client was so concerned with making a killing he should
have gotten a job there instead.
In addition to churning, the most often cited complaints have been high com-
missions and poor service. There are many brokers and you can shop around.
Once you find a broker whom you are comfortable with, then it’s time for the
fun stuff: filling out forms.
Opening a futures account
Here are the steps in finally opening your futures account:
1. Read the forms and ask the questions (see the section above).
2. Put in the usual information: name, address, and so on.
3. Decide on the initial investment.
4. Understand what risks you will tolerate.
5. Read the disclosure agreements about risk.
6. Submit the application and your funds and wait for the green light to
start trading.
7. Once you are ready, remember to read (re-read?) Chapter 14 on
futures.
After you have done your due diligence, you can now open up a futures
account. When you see the paperwork and supporting documentation, you’ll
think that they cut down an entire redwood tree just for the forms (makes me
regret not going long on those lumber futures!). Anyway, after the usual stuff
about your name, address, social security number, and so forth, you’ll see
questions and forms covering the topic of risk.
245
Chapter 17: Finding and Using a Broker

Commodities regulations try to make sure that small investors are made fully
aware of the risks associated with futures and options on futures. You’ll see
for our purposes that there are really two different categories of investors in
the world of futures (again, it’s really speculating): the retail investor and the
accredited investor.
The retail investor is the little guy or the small speculator (technically called
the non-accredited investor). If you have a regular job or you run a small
business and your income is less than $200,000, then you are a retail investor.
This category covers most folks. This is the category that the authorities
(such as the Commodity Futures Trading Commission) attempt to give some
protection through documents that need to be filled out when you open your
futures account. You’ll be required to sign risk disclosure documents so that
you are made aware of potential risks.
The accredited investor is a different animal. It may not necessarily mean
that you are particularly proficient at futures but it does indicate that you
can sustain losses without undue impact on your financial situation. An
accredited investor is generally defined as one with total financial assets of
$1 million or more (not including the value of your residence) and/or income
exceeding $200,000 per year.
Futures account commissions and fees
The costs of transacting futures is a major issue. Asking your potential broker
about how much he or she charges in commissions is necessary and obvious.
Choosing on price alone is not always the wisest thing since you want to
make sure that you are getting value. Let me give you an example.
My futures broker is Charlie and I think he’s great. His commissions are not 
the cheapest and they’re not the most expensive; the commission price is in
the middle of the pack. I could certainly find cheaper commissions elsewhere.
Heck . . . just go on the Internet and you can see bare-bones commissions.
However, we can’t confuse price with cost. I may pay $50 for a trade and some-
one else may only pay $10 because it’s an Internet trade. Yet, more times than
not, I will save money over that Internet trade. Why? In my case, Charlie “shops
the price” as he places the order with the folks on the exchange floor. He will
end up buying the trade at a good price and save me $100 or more on the total
trade. This is not easy to do with a cookie-cutter approach at a futures Web site
since the Internet approach may lock in a price without negotiating.
Here are more points about commissions and fees:
 Round-turn commissions: A round-turn commission covers both the
buy and sell sides of the trade. This is typical when you purchase an
option on futures.
246
Part IV: Investment Strategies 

 Half-turn commissions: A half-turn commission only covers the buy or
sell side of the trade. This is typical when you purchase futures directly
(versus options on futures).
 Negotiable commissions: Push for lower rates, especially if you are (or
will be) an active trader.
As of early 2007, average commissions per half-turn are in the range of
$30 to $80. If you are in the upper part of the range, negotiate.
If you are using a full-service broker whose guidance has lost you money,
consider negotiating for lower rates or (if they really do a bad job) then
move your business elsewhere.
If you are using a full-service broker and they are helping you make money
then don’t be that concerned about the commission. Good guidance is
hard to find so why ruin a good thing?
All in all, commission rates are a better deal now in the Internet age versus
what they were 10 or 20 years ago. During the 1990s, many futures brokers
charged $120 to $150 or more.
Remember that whatever person actually helps you in the trade, that person
will not be getting 100% of the commission amount. It does get divvied up by
several parties. If that person is an introducing broker then he or she must
pay roughly $10 to $15 from that commission to the organization clearing the
trade, the FCM.
Futures orders
In the world of futures, there are many different orders you can implement
and I’ll try to list as many as space can accommodate, but the most common
trade orders that individuals will come across are market orders, limit
orders, and stop orders, so they’ll be covered first.
In speaking to your broker to put in an order, he/she will take your instructions
and repeat the order back to you before it is submitted. Remember that even
though it is a verbal order, it is effectively a contractual transaction. The odds
are that the conversation will be recorded just in case there is a question or a
dispute regarding the verbal order.
Once the order is confirmed between the client and the broker, the broker will
then relay the order by telephone (or electronically) to the broker’s representa-
tive on the trading floor at the futures exchange (more on exchanges in
Chapter 14).
Before we get to the transactional orders (like market orders), let’s first 
mention time condition orders.
247
Chapter 17: Finding and Using a Broker

Time condition orders
This is a simple order and it goes in conjunction with the transactional
orders. The time order is your order to make the transactional order either a
day order or a good-’til-cancelled or GTC order. In other words, you will tell
the broker that your order is in effect either for the day or if it will be in effect
indefinitely.
In a day order, you may say, “Buy a December silver futures contract at the
price of $X or better and this order is good for the day.” This order will be filled
only if silver hits $X (or a better price) during that day’s trading session. If it
doesn’t hit $X by the end of the trading day, then the order will not be executed
and it will expire and be cleared off the slate. That’s a day order.
A GTC in that same situation may be, “Buy a December silver futures contract
at the price of $X or better and this order is good ’til cancelled (GTC).” With a
GTC order, if that December silver futures contract doesn’t hit the price
target that day then the order will stay on during the days to come until it
gets filled. The GTC order won’t stay there forever. Either it is filled, or the
client cancels it, or it may expire based on a time frame designated by the
broker. Depending on the broker, the GTC order can remain active (open
order) for 30, 60, 90 days, or other time frame (check with your broker).
That wasn’t so bad. Remember that if you are not sure if you are placing the
order properly, don’t be shy; tell the broker what you are trying to accomplish
and ask for assistance in understanding and implementing the order. Hey . . .
it’s your money and you’re paying for service.
Market orders
This is the most common transactional order. In a market order, the broker
tries to fill your order as soon as you submit it. A market order could be voiced
by the client as, “For my account #1234 buy 2 Gold April futures contracts at
the market.”
The market order is a simple and common order and I use it frequently.
Understand that a market order won’t always get you the best price because
in the order you are basically saying that you will accept the market’s price
instead of waiting for a better price. For me, if I’m getting into a transaction
worth thousands of dollars, I won’t sweat $50 either way because if I dig in
my heels to wait for a $50 savings, I may miss out on the order altogether.
Limit orders
In a limit order, the client requests that the trade be done at a specific price
(or better). An order may be, “Buy 1 platinum July futures contract at $75 or
better good for the day.” It may be filled at $75 or you might get it at a better
price like $74.50 or $74. But it won’t be filled at a price above your specified
price. Limit orders are good to use during weak or quiet markets since it will
be easier to obtain your price. A limit order can be a day order or a GTC order.
248
Part IV: Investment Strategies 

Stop orders: Buy and sell stops
A stop order is an order that turns into a market order the moment the
market price of that futures contract hits a specified price. More accurately,
stop orders can be buy stop orders or sell stop orders.
The buy stop is placed above the market price and it becomes a market order
when the futures contract trades at or above the specified stop price.
The sell stop is placed below the market price and it becomes a market order
when the futures contract trades at or below the specified stop price.
Cancellation orders (CXL orders)
Also called a straight cancel order, this order instructs the broker to cancel
an order previously entered. That was simple!
Cancel former order (CFO order)
This order basically does the work of two orders. It cancels a prior open
order and then replaces it with a new order.
Market on close order (MOC order)
This order instructs the broker to fill the order during the closing of market
trading (during the last 30 seconds). The order must be filled at a price that
is within the closing range. Whew! I wouldn’t want to be a broker missing this
order by seven seconds with a temperamental client.
Opening-only orders
This order gets implemented during the opening of trading that day. As 
with the MOC order, the order is transacted within a range of prices as the
market opens.
One cancels the other order (OCO order)
This is technically two orders entered simultaneously but there is a condi-
tion. The condition is that if one order is filled then it automatically cancels
the other order. Order #1 may be the desired order to be filled but if market
conditions make it impossible to fill, then order #2 would be filled. The filling
of either order means that the other order is not filled. Say that fast three
times. Made ya try! Well, this order is akin to “If it’s sunny today, we’re going
to the monster truck rally and get rowdy but if it’s cloudy we’ll stay home and
play Parcheesi.”
Other orders
There are other orders as well and for the sake of completeness, I’ll just list
them here. Speak to your broker about their applicability to you and your
account:
249
Chapter 17: Finding and Using a Broker

 Market-if-touched orders (MIT order)
 Fill-or-kill orders (FOK orders)
 Disregard tape orders (DRT orders)
 Wire orders
Most brokers list the various orders that they can transact with complete
description (or a glossary) and examples in their literature or at their Web site.
Managed futures accounts
Managed futures accounts have been around since the late 1970s. A managed
futures account is a futures account that is managed by a professional money
manager registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)
and officially called a commodity trading advisor (CTA).
The CTA is a regulated professional who meets the educational requirements
of the National Futures Association (NFA), a self-regulatory industry watchdog
organization. (It operates similarly to the National Association of Securities
Dealers [NASD].) Most CTAs use a proprietary trading system or some other
formal method through which they make their trading decisions. CTAs could
go long or short futures contracts.
A managed futures account has the following advantages:
 Diversification: For investors with money in stocks and bonds, commodi-
ties add a new dimension to their portfolio.
 Professional management: You don’t have to choose the individual
futures to include; the CTA makes the day-to-day decisions.
 Protection against political crises and natural disasters.
 A hedge against inflation (such as rising food and energy costs).
An important aspect of commodities is that they do perform quite differently
from stocks and bonds so they add value to your overall portfolio. Many
studies over the past quarter century have shown that commodities as a 
general investing class have performed very well during periods of political
and economic stress.
Commodities performed very well during the economic and political turmoil
of the late 1970s and again during the first half of this decade in the wake of
9/11, hurricanes, and rising inflation. Diversified managed accounts were
among the best performing accounts in those time frames.
If you are in (or considering getting into) a managed account, ask the CTA
about the approaches used to maximize profit and minimize risk. Here are
the most common approaches used by CTAs:
250
Part IV: Investment Strategies 

 Going long: Making a bet that something will go up in price.
 Going short: Making a bet that something will go down in price.
 Spreads: A hedging approach where both a long and short position are
held. More about spreads in Chapter 15.
Some considerations about CTAs
You don’t have to blindly accept anything the CTA says. Their track record
and methodology can be reviewed.
Drawdowns
This is important information regarding the CTA’s track record in the event
that there was a decline in the equity (or account value) of a managed
account. A drawdown represents the maximum downward move of the
account value from the peak to the trough or valley. It is like a worst case sce-
nario taken from the CTA’s recent activity. It is not meant to make you think
that the same dip in account value is going to happen to you but it is meant
to indicate that losses can happen. It can also indicate how long losses can
be recouped as the market rebounds. Past performance is included in the dis-
closure documents as required by the National Futures Association (NFA).
The disclosure documents also indicate how the performance did over an
extended period of time and also show annualized percentage gains and
losses to make it easy for prospective clients to compare with other CTAs
and with acceptable market averages.
Dispersion
Dispersion is the distance of CTAs’ monthly and annual performance using a
mean or average level, which is a common way to evaluate how well they
have done.
Fees and account minimums
A managed account by a CTA is not like a mutual fund or hedge fund. The
client has the ability to review the account and see what trades are made.
CTAs don’t make money from commissions since that would be a conflict of
interest. The account’s trades are cleared through a FCM (see above). CTAs
typically make money as a percentage of the account’s performance.
Minimum account sizes can vary but they have been as low as $25,000
although most CTAs require $50,000 or more.
Managed futures accounts are not for everyone. Small investors are better off
looking elsewhere (such as the stock market). But for those with large portfo-
lios who want commodities in the mix, managed accounts are a viable choice.
251
Chapter 17: Finding and Using a Broker

They must be doing something right; managed futures have over $150 billion
under their guidance. As inflation heats up and more of the world’s population
needs more of the basics of life, commodities will continue to be an attractive
alternative. To find out more about CTAs, head over to the NFA’s Web site at
www.nfa.futures.org.
Stock Brokerage Accounts
After slogging through all that stuff about futures accounts, this should be a
breeze. Many folks have opened a stock brokerage account and it’s probably
the most appropriate for most small and mid-size investors (or speculators).
For most investors seeking growth (either conservative or aggressive) without
the volatility and risk of futures, stocks and ETFs (and options on these securi-
ties) offer plenty of variety. A stock brokerage account should actually be the
cornerstone of the long-term investor’s wealth-building program because of
the wide array of investments, techniques, and strategies available. There are
several types of brokers . . .
Stock brokers
A long time ago, there was one category of stockbroker. That category was
called . . . stockbroker! Then things changed during the 1980s. For investors
like you and me, there came to be two basic categories:
 The full-service broker: For investors who wanted more attention 
and service from their broker, a full-service broker was the choice. The
commission was high but many investors felt the price was justified 
due to personalized service and more guidance in the realm of choosing
investments and setting financial objectives. If you think you need more
attention and assistance and don’t mind the extra cost, the full-service
broker is for you.
 The discount broker: With deregulation in the early 1980s, this paved
the way for greater competition in the stock brokerage industry. With
trailblazers like Charles Schwab, the discount broker was born and soon
became a new and growing force in the world of stocks (and futures).
Account types
As you get into stock investing, you’ll find that there are three basic types of
accounts: cash, margin (or margin and options), and discretionary. Retirement
accounts (such as Individual Retirement Accounts, or IRAs) are covered in
Chapter 20.
252
Part IV: Investment Strategies 

Cash account
This is the simplest and easiest account to open. In a cash account you pay
everything in cash with no credit involved. This one is appropriate for small
investors or for conservative investors. As you shop around, you will find
stockbrokers who take accounts with initial minimum investments of $2,000
or less.
Margin account
A margin account basically means that you have borrowing privileges in your
account. In other words, you have the ability to use securities in your account
as collateral and use the loan proceeds to purchase other securities in your
account.
Other accounts
Another type of account is a discretionary account where you give trading priv-
ileges to others to trade your account. Of course you have to do some serious
due diligence before you do this, but I think that you are better off doing your
own research through the resources mentioned throughout this book.
Lastly, just about every stock brokerage has the capacity to help you open
Individual Retirement Accounts (traditional or Roth). They are covered in
Chapter 20.
Opening a stock brokerage account
It’s not difficult to open up a stock brokerage account but just to be sure,
here’s a step-by-step rundown:
1. Do the research. There are plenty of sources that evaluate brokers. You
can head down to the library and look up Forbes magazine and Barron’s
that do regular reviews and comparisons of brokers. Web sites such as
www.smartmoney.com, www.investopedia.com, and www.sec.gov
also give great consumer information on choosing a broker.
2. Ask your questions. What are the commissions? What is the minimum
investment? The sources in Step #1 can help with your inquiry.
3. Choose the type of account. A cash account is easy to get but you’re
better off getting the margin and options account open so that you have
more choices (such as buying/selling calls and puts).
4. Get the paperwork. Either call the broker or visit their Web site. The
forms can be downloaded and mailed (after you fill them out, of course).
Many brokers let you fax the application or fill them out online at the
Web site.
253
Chapter 17: Finding and Using a Broker

5. Fund it. Either mail in a check for the initial investment amount or 
transfer money electronically from your bank account.
6. Make a truckload of money! Well . . . let’s hope so.
Once you’ve got all that, you’re ready for business! Keep in mind that just
about all the broker Web sites have complete details on how to do an order
and so on. Of course, you can call customer service at their ubiquitous 800
number.
Types of Orders
When you are getting into stocks, futures, or options, how you invest can be
just as important as what you invest in. Of course, the “what” is precious
metals (and securities related to them) but “how” you do it is important as
well. When you make that buy or sell transaction, you will need to be familiar
with what type of order. Doing the order through the broker’s Web site is
your best bet.
 Market order: This one works the same as with the futures broker. A
market order is the instruction to the broker to purchase (or sell) that
security immediately.
 Buy limit order: The order to purchase a security at a specified price
(or better).
 Sell limit order: The order to sell a security at a specified price 
(or better).
 Stop-loss order: An order to sell a security you purchased previously at
a specified price below the market price only in the event the security is
dropping in price. A stop-loss order has the purpose of minimizing the
downside risk.
Stock brokerage services
In today’s market and with today’s technology, brokerage service is no longer
merely a way to buy and sell securities. The stockbroker (even a discount
one) has features and bells and whistles that can make for a more profitable
investing experience. In the prior segment, I mention stop-loss orders. Now
take it a step further with the trailing stop strategy.
Trailing stops
For those of you who read Stock Investing For Dummies (pat yourselves on
the back) you will know that I am a big proponent of trailing stops. I spent a
254
Part IV: Investment Strategies 

lot of time on the advantages to investors that brokerage services can pro-
vide (such as the trailing stop). I don’t use them in every circumstance but I
consider them an important risk-management tool in the investors’ arsenal.
What is the trailing stop? I’m glad you asked! It is an active strategy of imple-
menting stop-loss orders. The stop-loss order (see above) is an order to help
you reduce or remove the downside risk to holding a stock. A trailing stop
means that you keep adjusting the stop-loss order to protect more and more
of your investment as it increases in value. Let me provide an example.
Presume that you have 100 shares of Eureka Gold Mining Company (EGM) at
$30 a share. Let’s say you put on a 10% stop-loss order and you make it GTC
(good ’til cancelled). In that case, the stop loss would be at $27 and would
stay on indefinitely (based on how long that particular broker decides a GTC
order time frame would be). Remember that if EGM’s stock price falls, the
worst that would happen is that it could hit $27 and be sold immediately and
you wouldn’t have to see EGM go to $26 or lower. What happens when EGM
does what you hope it does and goes up?
Say EGM goes to $40. This is great. So what happens with the stop-loss order?
At this point you should cancel that stop loss at $27 and replace it with one
at, say, $36. That would make it again 10% (10% of $40 is $4; $40 less $4 is $36)
and again it would be a GTC order. At this point, you are protecting the origi-
nal $30 per share plus a profit of $6. Again, the upside would have no limita-
tion while we are limiting the downside. To protect 100% of your original
investment plus a nice chunk of profit is a good deal.
Broker e-mail alert services
Do you know that you could program your account at the broker’s Web site
as if it were a computer?! Sounds almost futuristic but it’s really cool. Here’s a
brief rundown of what you can do:
 Price alerts: If a stock you have (or one you’re interested in) hits a price
you specify, an e-mail will be sent by the broker to let you know.
 News alerts: When something happens such as major market-moving
news, an e-mail will alert you.
 Trade pre-programming: You can go to the Web site and put in orders
to buy or sell a stock, ETF, or option when certain conditions are met
(when that security hits a price or when another event occurs). An
e-mail will then be sent to let you know it happened.
 Trade triggers: Being able to set up orders to occur when primary or
secondary events occur. An example would be “buy or sell security B
when security A does something (such as reach a 52-week high).” 
The things you can do are limited only by your imagination. The point is that
these added services give you more control over your securities in today’s
marketplace. These are just more tools in your wealth-building arsenal.
255
Chapter 17: Finding and Using a Broker

If your broker doesn’t yet have these services, it’s okay. There are some great
Web sites that can give many of these features. A good example is Market
Watch (www.marketwarch.com).
Stock brokerage commissions and fees
The obvious charge for your trading comes in the form of commissions. But
fortunately, with the advent of the Internet, most of the discount brokers give
you the ability to buy or sell securities ranging from $7 to $15, making stock
investing affordable for almost anyone.
Margin in a stock brokerage account
Using margin in your account can increase the positive . . . or increase the
negative. After you have been approved for margin trading, you will be
allowed to borrow against marginable securities. A marginable security is
basically almost any stock that is not an over-the-counter stock or a small
stock on Nasdaq. Most stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange, for
example, are marginable.
With margin, you could, say, put $2,000 in an account and be able to buy up to
$4,000 in stock. The minimum amount to set up a margin account will depend
on the broker (it could be for $5,000 or more). When you initially put that
$2,000 in the account, you will see (at the broker’s Web site, for example) that
you have cash of $2,000 and buying power of $4,000. (The broker lends you
the difference.) With listed or marginable stock, the borrowing ratio is 50%.
The ratio could be different depending on the security. (You can borrow up to
90% of the market value of Treasury bonds, for example.) Keep in mind that
you will pay margin interest on anything you borrow through your account.
The use of margin can magnify gains or . . . if you’re not careful . . . losses. 
Say you decide to start with $3,000 and the stock you’re going to buy is 100
shares of the Hokey Smoke Gold Company (HSG) at $60 a share. In this case,
you would use the full limit of 50% to make the purchase. The 50% is the limit
and you don’t have to go that high. It could certainly be less. Say that HSG
goes up to $75 per share making the total stock value $7,500. How did you
do? That $15 gain amounted to a 25% gain ($15 is 25% of $60, the original
stock price) but since you used only $3,000 of your own money your actual
percentage gain is 50%. Cool! At that point you could choose to sell the stock
and pay off the margin (don’t forget margin interest and commissions). It’s
nice if it happens . . . but . . . what if you’re wrong?
Let’s say that HSG’s stock price drops to $40 (Hokey smoke!!). Now what? The
account is now worth $4,000 but $3,000 is the margin loan from the broker; the
loan ratio has fallen to 25% (your equity portion of the $4,000 account value 
is only $1,000 or 25% of the total amount). This is a problem and you will get 
a margin call to get that ratio back to 50% within one trading day. You would
256
Part IV: Investment Strategies 

either have to kick in another $2,000 or deposit more marginable securities in
the account to restore the ratio to 50% (or better). If you don’t then the broker
can liquidate positions in the account to restore the ratio. This is in keeping
with the agreement you have with the broker which says that you must 
maintain your margin ratio at the required level (or better).
To stay out of trouble with margin, here are some reminders . . .
 With margin, you will be charged interest. The longer the borrowing
period, the more you will pay.
 Margin can magnify losses as well as gains.
 Some stocks are eligible for margin trading and some are not. Check with
your broker for more details.
 The money that you receive from selling stocks that were initially bought
on margin will first go into liquidating any margin loans outstanding
before you have any funds to withdraw or reinvest.
 Different brokers have different requirements regarding margin so, again,
check with the broker about terms and conditions.
 Novice investors are best advised to use little or no margin to avoid the
risks and volatility that can occur. Wait until you accumulate more funds
and . . . more importantly . . . more experience and expertise.
Margin interest can be tax-deductible as investment interest so discuss it
with your tax advisor (more on taxes in Chapter 20).

Using Technical Analysis
In This Chapter
 Getting the basics of technical analysis
 Understanding the value of charts and price data
 Finding out about indicators and other warning flags
W
hen figuring out what to do in the investment world, most professionals
use one of two basic approaches: fundamental analysis or technical
analysis (many use some combination of the two). Both approaches are used
in a number of markets ranging from the stock market to commodities. I’ll limit
the comments to our narrow segment of the financial world, precious metals 
in the forms of futures (and options on futures). Of course, fundamental and
technical analyses can be applied to individual mining stocks, exchange-traded
funds, (ETFs), and on precious metals indexes (such as through options).
Generally, technical analysis is not used with some precious metals vehicles
such as bullion.
In regards to precious metals futures, fundamental analysis goes into the eco-
nomics of the underlying investment such as supply and demand information
as well as factors affecting the investment such as politics and regulations. (If
the investment in question was a company then you would include analysis on
its financial strengths and profitability.) Technical analysis tries to understand
where the investment’s price is going based on market behavior as evidenced
in its market statistics (presented in charts, price, and trading volume data).
This will all be fleshed out in this chapter of course. Technical analysis doesn’t
try to figure out the worth of an investment; it is used to figure out where the
price of that asset or investment is trending.
Because technical analysis is indeed technical, don’t try to understand it all
immediately. What normal person gets into stochastic oscillators and divergent
and convergent who-z-what-is the first day?! “Not I!” said the author (“Amen,
brother!”). Understanding technical analysis is like eating an elephant: You eat
one bite at a time (and you put the rest in the trunk for later).
Technical analysis is most useful for those who are trading and/or speculating
during a relatively short time frame measured in days, weeks, or months. It is
not that useful when you are trying to forecast where the price will be a year or
more down the road.

Technical versus Fundamental Analysis
Although technical analysis is “the star” of this chapter, it is useful to take in its
shortcomings and juxtapose it with fundamental analysis. The first and major
drawback of technical analysis is that it is a human approach tracking human
behavior in that particular market. In other words, just because it is called
technical analysis doesn’t mean that it’s technical a la the law of physics. It is
called technical analysis because the data you look at is technical but the
movement of the price of the underlying asset or investment moves due to the
cumulative decisions of many buyers and sellers who are human and therefore
fallible. Why mention this?
Everyone is looking to make money and there are many trading systems and
approaches that are based on technical analysis. Unfortunately, making prof-
itable investments isn’t just 2+2 = 4. If technical analysis made things so easy
that mere computer models or trading systems could give you a voila-money-
making decision then everyone could and would do it. Yet, that is not the case.
Let me give you my take.
I favor fundamental analysis for long-term investing. I have shunned technical
analysis for choosing individual stocks because I didn’t see the long-term value
in it. In stock market history, if you did a nose count of successful investors
and what approach they used, you would find that those long-term investors
who used some variation of fundamental analysis (as those who use a value-
investing approach) are overwhelmingly the larger category. The legendary
investors such as Warren Buffet and Peter Lynch rarely looked at a chart. But
before you throw out the technical analysis with the bath water, read on.
Those who use technical analysis in short-term trading or speculating in larger
scope investments tend to do better than those who don’t use it. What does
that mean? What I mean is that if you apply technical analysis in something
larger than a company such as an index or a commodity, then you will tend to
do better. If you are getting into trading futures on entities such as grains, or
energy or precious metals, then understanding the basics of technical analysis
will make you, overall, a better (hence more profitable) trader. Since short-term
market behavior and psychology can be very mercurial and irrational (human),
then technical analysis will have usefulness.
The guts of technical analysis
When you are using technical analysis, understand how it operates and what
it is that you look at. Technical analysis, for purposes in this book, is based
on several assumptions:
260
Part IV: Investment Strategies 

The price tells all
The asset’s market price provides enough information to render a trading
decision. Those who criticize technical analysis point out that it considers the
price and its movement without adequate attention to the fundamental factors
of the company. The argument made favoring technical analysis is that the
price is a snapshot that does reflect in and of itself the basic factors affecting
the company; that includes the company’s (or asset’s) fundamentals.
Technical analysts (also called technicians) believe that the company’s funda-
mentals, along with broader economic factors and its market psychology, are
all priced into the stock, removing the need to actually consider these factors
separately. The bottom line is that technicians look at the price and its 
movement and extract from this a forecast for where it is going.
It’s all about the trend
The price tends to move in trends. In the world of technical analysis, the
phrase “the trend is your friend” is as ubiquitous as the phrase “you spoiled
the broth, now you lie in it!” is in the restaurant industry. Uh . . . maybe more
so. Following the trend is a bedrock principle in technical analysis and the
data is either there to support the trend or not. When a trend in the asset’s
price is established, the tendency is that it will continue. The three types of
trends are up, down, and sideways (but you knew that).
History repeats
Another foundational idea in technical analysis is that history tends to repeat
itself, mainly in terms of price movement. The repetitive nature of price move-
ments is attributed to market psychology; in other words, market participants
tend to provide a consistent reaction to similar market stimuli over time.
Technical analysis uses chart patterns to analyze market movements and
understand trends. Although many of these charts have been used for more
than 100 years, they are still believed to be relevant because they illustrate
patterns in price movements that often repeat themselves.
How about both?
I think that a useful way to combine both is to use the strength of each.
Fundamental analysis should help you understand “what” to invest (or trade
or speculate) in while technical analysis guides you as to “when” to do it.
Since markets ebb and flow, and they zig and zag, technical analysis can help
you spot low-risk points to either enter or exit a trade. Technical analysis,
therefore, helps to stack the deck a little more in your favor. Considering how
markets are going lately, every little bit helps.
261
Chapter 18: Using Technical Analysis

Blending the two approaches to some extent has been done with success.
Obviously, if the fundamental and the technical factors support your decision
then the chance for a profitable trade has more going for it. How could this
blend occur?
For example, look at the concepts of oversold and overbought (see the seg-
ment on Relative Strength Indicator later in this chapter). If you were looking
at buying a stock (or other asset) because you thought that it would be a
strong investment but were not sure about when to buy, you would want to
look at the technical data. If the data told you that it was oversold then it
would be a good time to buy. Oversold just means that the market was a little
too extreme in selling that particular investment during a particular time.
By the way, I like to think that the technical terms oversold and overbought
have a parallel to fundamental terms such as undervalued and overvalued.
Since fundamental analysis is a major part of a school of thought referred to
as value investing, the concepts make sense (yes . . . I am into value investing).
Just as it is usually a good idea to invest in an undervalued stock so it is a
good trading idea to buy a stock that is oversold. It is logical to presume that
an oversold stock is undervalued (all things being equal). Of course, the other
terms (overbought and overvalued) can also run in tandem. I might as well
finish here before you are overwhelmed and under-interested.
On the other hand, the fundamentals can help a technical analyst make a better
trading decision. Say that technical analyst has a profitable position in a mining
stock called Six Feet Under Co. (SFU). If the technical indicators are turning
bearish and the new quarterly earnings report for SFU indicates that net profit 
is significantly lower, then selling SFU’s stock is probably a good idea.
The tools of the trade
When you roll up your sleeves and get into technical analysis, what will you
be dealing with? It will depend also on what type of technical analyst you are.
In technical analysis, there are two subcategories: those who predominantly
use charts (these technicians are called . . . chartists!) and those who predom-
inantly use data (such as price and volume data). Of course, many technicians
use a combination of both.
Charts: The neat pictures that graph price movements (such as chart 
patterns)
Data: Such as price and volume information (along with technical and
behavioral indicators derived from it)
Technical analysts don’t look at the fundamentals because they believe that
the marketplace (as depicted in the charts, price, and volume data) already
takes into account the fundamentals.
262
Part IV: Investment Strategies 

Tracking the Trend
Identifying the trend is a crucial part of technical analysis. A trend is just the
overall direction of that security or commodity. Which way is the price
headed? It’s easy to see which way the asset is headed in Figure 18-1.
Unless you are a skier, that’s not a pretty picture. The bearish trend is 
obvious. But what do you do with a chart like Figure 18-2?
Yup . . . looks like somebody’s heart monitor while he or she is watching a
horror movie. A sideways or horizontal trend just shows a consolidation pat-
tern that means that the security or asset will break out into an up or down
trend. Regardless of whether the trend is up, down, or sideways, you will
notice that it is rarely (closer to never) in a straight line. The line is usually
jagged and bumpy since it is really a summary of all the buyers and sellers
making their trades. Some days, the buyers have more impact and some days
it is the sellers’ turn.
Keep in mind that there are formal definitions of the three basic trends.
 An uptrend or bullish trend is when each successive high is higher
than the previous high and each successive low is higher than the 
previous low.

Chapter 18: Using Technical Analysis

 A down-trend or bearish trend is when each successive high is lower
that the previous high and each successive low is lower than the 
previous low.
 The sideways trend or horizontal trend shows that the highs and the
lows are both in a generally sideways pattern with no clear indication of
trending up or down (at least not yet).
Figure 18-3 shows all three trends.
Technical analysts call the highs peaks and the lows troughs. In other words,
if the peaks and troughs keep going up, that’s bullish. If the peaks and
troughs keep going down, it’s bearish. And if the peaks and troughs are 
horizontal then you are probably in California (just kidding).
Trend lengths
With trends, you are not just looking at the direction, you are also looking at
the trend’s duration or length of time that it is going along. Trend durations
can be (you guessed it) short term, intermediate term, or long term. Generally,
a short-term (or near-term) trend is less than a month. An intermediate term
is up to a quarter (three months) long while a long-term can be up to a year.
And to muddy the water a bit, the long-term trend may have several trends
inside it (don’t worry; the quiz has been cancelled).
Trendlines
This is a simple feature added to the chart to show a straight line to desig-
nate a clear path for that particular trend. The trendline simply follows the
troughs in the trend to show a distinctive direction. They can also be used to
identify a trend reversal or change in the opposite direction. Figure 18-4
shows a trendline.

Channels
Channel lines are lines that are added to show both the peaks and troughs of
the primary trend. The top line indicates resistance (of the price movement)
and the lower line indicates support. Support and resistance are important
concepts in technical analysis (more about support and resistance later in
this chapter). The channel can slope or point upward, downward, or go side-
ways. Technical traders will view the channel with interest because the
assumption is that the price will continue in the direction of the channel
(between resistance and support) until technical indicators signal a change.
(This tells me to change to a cable channel but that’s just me. Please continue
reading . . .) Check out the channel in Figure 18-5.
As you are seeing the asset’s price moving upward, you see where the price 
is on both the top and bottom. The channel shows you how the price is
range-bound. The continuance emphasis on trends is to help you make more
profitable decisions since you are better off trading with the trend than not.

Chapter 18: Using Technical Analysis

Resistance and support
The concepts of resistance and support are critical to technical analysis the
way tires are to cars. When the rubber meets the road, you want to know
where the price is going.
Resistance is like the proverbial glass ceiling in the market’s world of price
movement. As the price keeps moving up, how high can or will it go? That’s
the $64,000 question and technical analysts watch this closely. Breaking
through resistance is considered a positive sign for the price and the expec-
tation is definitely bullish.
Support is the lowest point or level that the price is trading at. When the price
goes down and hits this level, it is expected to bounce back but what hap-
pens when it goes below the support level? It is then considered a bearish
sign and technical analysts watch closely for a potential reversal and expect
the price to head down.
Both the resistance and support form the trading range for the asset’s price. If
the price continues in this range then it is a sideways or horizontal pattern and
technical analysts watch for indicators that it will break out of the pattern 
and then either presume an upward or downward path.
Charts
Charts are to technical analysis what pictures are to photography. You can’t
avoid them ’cause you’re not supposed to. That’s why you see more charts in
this chapter than all the other chapters combined. But trust me, especially 
if you are serious about trading metals (or stocks or other commodities),
charts and the related technical data will come in handy.
In terms of visualization and utility, the following are the four most common
charts used in technical analysis.
Line charts
A chart simply shows a series of prices plotted in a graph showing how the
price moved over a period of time. The period of time could be a day, week,
month, year, or longer. The prices that are usually chosen for a line chart are
the closing prices for those market days.
You will notice in other chapters that I prefer to use a five-year chart because
I like to encourage my clients, students, and readers to be focused on the
longer term because positive results can be easier to achieve.
266
Part IV: Investment Strategies 

With a line chart, you can see how the stock has progressed during the 12-
month period and you can do some simple analysis. When were the peaks?
How about the troughs? What were the strongest seasons for this stock’s
price movement?
Bar charts
Now we are getting a little fancier. Where the line chart gives you only the
closing prices for each market day, the bar chart gives you the range of trad-
ing prices for each day during that chosen time period. Each trading day is a
vertical line that represents the price movements and you see the asset’s
high, low, and closing prices.
In a bar chart, the vertical line will have two notches. The notch on the left
indicates the opening price and the notch on the right indicates the closing
price. If the opening price notch is higher than the closing price notch then
the line would be in red to indicate that the closing price of the asset
declined versus the opening price. An up day would be in black and the clos-
ing price notch would be higher than the opening price notch.
Candlestick charts
Candlestick charts have been all the rage in recent years. They are basically
bar charts but with a little more complexity to them. The full name for them
is Japanese candlestick charts since they originated as a form of technical
analysis in the 17th century when they were trading in rice markets.
Candlestick charts are too involved to adequately describe in this space so
please continue your research with the resources provided at the end of this
chapter.
It stands to reason that since candlestick charts provide more information in
a visual form than bar charts, they can provide more guidance in trading.
Point and figure charts
A more obscure chart that chartists use is the point-and-figure chart. When
you look at it, you will notice a series of X’s and O’s. The X’s represent
upward price trends and the O’s represent downward price trends.
267
Chapter 18: Using Technical Analysis

Chart Patterns
Chart patterns are very interesting and they are the graphical language of
technical analysis. For technical analysts, the pattern is important since it 
provides a potential harbinger for what is to come. It is not 100% accurate but
it is usually accurate better than 50% of the time as odds go. In the world of
trading, being right over 50% of the time can be enough. Usually a proficient
technician is better than that.
Head and shoulders
The head and shoulders pattern is essentially bearish. It is usually a signal that
an uptrend has ended and the pattern is set to reverse and head downward.
Technical analysts consider this to be one of the most reliable patterns. The
pattern shows three peaks and two troughs.
The first components of this pattern are the three peaks that break down into
the tall center peak (the head) and the shorter peaks (the shoulders) that are
on each side of the center peak. The two troughs form the neckline.
The head and shoulders pattern tells technical analysts that the trend that just
preceded this pattern basically ran out of gas. The selling pressures build up
and overpower the buyers. Hence, the price starts to come down. The shoul-
der on the right is like a last effort for the bullish trend to regain its traction but
to no avail. Keep in mind that the neckline in this pattern is the support. As
support is broken, then the tendency is that it is a bearish expectation.
Reverse head and shoulders
As you can infer, this pattern is opposite to the prior chart pattern and it is
essentially bullish. This pattern signals that a downtrend has ended and is
set to reverse and head upward. In this pattern, you have three troughs and
two peaks. The middle trough is usually the deepest one. 
In this pattern, buying pressures build up and form a base to spring upward.
Remember that a bullish pattern is a series of higher highs and higher lows.
In the reverse head and shoulders pattern, the neckline is resistance. Once
resistance is broken then the expectation is for an upward move.
Keep in mind that with this chart (as with all charts), there is not 100% reliabil-
ity or guaranteed accuracy. Technical analysts don’t say that the next step after
a particular pattern is a certainty; it is a probability. Probable outcomes, more
times than not, tend to materialize. Increasing the probability of success for
more profitable decision-making (entering or exiting a trade) is the bottom-line
mission of technical analysis.
268
Part IV: Investment Strategies 

Cup and handle
This pattern is generally bullish. In the pattern, the price first peaks then
craters into a bowl-shaped trough (the cup) and peaks at the end of it with a
small downward move (the handle) before it moves up.
This pattern basically tells the technician that the security’s price took a
breather to build support and then continue the bullish pattern.
Double tops and bottoms
Both the double top and the double bottom chart patterns indicate a trend
reversal. The double top is essentially a bearish pattern as the price makes
two attempts (the double top) to break through resistance but failing to do
so. The bottom of the trough between the two peaks indicates support.
However, the two failed attempts at the resistance level are more significant
than the support at the trough so this pattern signals a potential downturn
for that asset’s price.
The double bottom is the opposite reversal pattern. It is a bullish pattern as
the support level indicators are stronger than the resistance. This signals a
potential upturn in the asset’s price.
As a further variation, there are also triple tops and triple bottoms. These are
sideways or horizontal patterns that do portend a trend reversal. Don’t even
think about quadruple tops and bottoms.
Triangles
A triangle is formed when the resistance line and the support line converge
to form the triangle point which shows a general direction in the asset’s price
movement. There are three types of triangles: symmetrical, ascending, and
descending.
The symmetrical triangle points sideways so this tells you it is a horizontal
pattern which becomes a setup for a move upward or downward once more
price movement provides a bullish or bearish indicator. The ascending trian-
gle is a bullish pattern while the descending triangle is bearish. Of course, if
you see a divergent trapezoidal and octagonal candlestick formation sup-
ported in a bowl-shaped isosceles triangle then do nothing! Just take two
aspirin and try again tomorrow.

Chapter 18: Using Technical Analysis

Flags and pennants
Flags and pennants are familiar chart patterns that are short-term in nature
(usually not longer than a few weeks). They are continuation patterns that
are formed immediately after a sharp price movement and then usually fol-
lowed by a sideways price movement.
Both the flag and the pennant are similar except that the flag is triangular
while the pennant is in a channel formation. Because these patterns are so
short term, they’re usually considered continuation patterns.
Wedges
The wedge pattern can be either a continuation or reversal pattern. It seems
to be much like a symmetrical triangle but it slants (up or down) while the
symmetrical triangle generally shows a sideways movement. In addition, the
wedge forms over a longer period of time (typically three to six months).
Gaps
A gap in a chart is an empty space between two trading periods. This hap-
pens when there is a substantial difference in the price between those two
periods. Say that in the first period the trading range is $10 to $15 and then
the next trading session opens at $20. That $5 discrepancy will be a large gap
on the chart between those two periods. These gaps are typically found on
bar and candlestick charts. This may happen when positive (or negative)
news comes out about the security or commodity in the interim and initial
buying pressure causes the price jump with the subsequent period as soon
as trading commences.
There are three types of gaps: breakaway, runaway, and exhaustion. The
breakaway gap forms at the start of a trend and the runaway gap forms
during the middle of the trend. So obviously, what happens when the trend
gets tired at the end? Why, the exhaustion gap, of course! See, this stuff isn’t
that hard to grasp.
Moving Averages
In terms of price data, a favorite tool of the technical analyst is the moving
average. A moving average is the average price of a security or commodity
over a set period of time. This is done because frequently a chart shows
price movements as too jumpy and haphazard so the moving average
270
Part IV: Investment Strategies 

smoothes it out to show a clearer path for the price. This helps to decipher
its trend. There are three types of moving averages: simple, linear, and 
exponential.
Simple moving averages (SMA)
The first (and most common) type of average is referred to as a simple
moving average (SMA). It is calculated by simply taking the sum of all of the
past closing prices over the chosen time period and dividing the result by the
number of prices used in the calculation. For example, in a ten-day simple
moving average, the last ten closing prices are added together and then
divided by ten.
An example of the ten-day moving average
Say that the prices for the last ten trading days are (in order) $10, $11, $12,
$10, $11, $13, $14, $12, $12, and $14. It is hard to derive a trend from that but
a moving average can help. First you add up all the prices; in this case the
total is $119. Then you take the total of $119 and divide it by ten (the total
number of trading days). You get an average price of $11.90. As you do this
with more and more price data (in ten-day chronological sets) you can see a
trend unfolding.
Say that on the 11th day, the closing price is $15. At this point the next 10-day
trading starts with $11 (this was the closing price from the second day in our
first example) and ends with a new closing price for the 10th day, $15. Now
when you add up this new ten-day range, you get a total of 124. Once you
divide that number by ten, you get the average of $12.40 ($124 total divided
by 10 days). In this brief and simple example, we see that the 10-day moving
average tells us the price trend is up (from $11.90 and moving to $12.40).
Of course, you need to see a much longer string of ten-day sets to ascertain a
useful ten-day moving average but you get the point. These averages can also
be plotted on a graph to depict the trend to help render a trading decision.
The more time periods that you graph the easier it is to see how strong (or
weak) the trend is.
Moving averages are very useful in plotting out the support and resistance
levels in the trend. They are very helpful in figuring all the various peaks and
troughs necessary in analyzing the trend’s direction.
The most common simple moving averages
Technical analysts most frequently use 10-day, 20-day, or 50-day for short-
term trading. To confirm longer-term trends, they also watch the 100-day and
200-day moving averages. Of course, there are other time frames as well but
these are common.
271
Chapter 18: Using Technical Analysis

The longer period moving averages help to put the short terms in perspective
so that the trader can still view the big picture. In other words, you may have
an asset correct and see its price fall significantly but does it mean that a trend
has reversed? If the asset is in a long-term bull market, it is common for it to
violate or go below its short-term averages (such as 10-, 20-, or 50-day moving
averages) temporarily. The more serious red flags start to appear when it 
violates the longer-term averages such as the 200-day moving average. And 
if it violates the ten-year moving average . . . hey . . . watch out!
Other averages
Some critics believe that the SMA is too limited in its scope and therefore not
as useful as it should be. This is why more involved variants of it are also
used, such as the Linear Weighted Average (LWA) and the Exponential Moving
Average (EMA). It would be too involved to adequately cover these averages
in this chapter. You can get more details on them through the resources at the
end of the chapter. For beginners, the SMA is sufficient.
Indicators and Oscillators
An indicator is a mathematical calculation that can be used with the asset’s
price and/or volume. The end result is a value that is used to anticipate
future changes in prices.
There are two types of indicators: leading and lagging. Leading indicators
help you profit by attempting to forecast what prices will do next. Leading
indicators provide greater rewards at the expense of increased risk. They 
perform best in sideways or trading markets. They work by measuring how
overbought and oversold a security is.
Lagging (or trend-following) indicators are best suited to price movements
that are in relatively long trends. They don’t warn you of any potential
changes in prices. Lagging indicators have you buy and sell in a mature trend
when there is reduced risk.
Oscillators
Oscillators are indicators that are used when you are analyzing charts that
have no clear trend. Moving averages and other indicators are certainly
important when the trend is clear, but oscillators are more beneficial when
the asset is either is in a horizontal or sideways trading pattern, or has not
been able to establish a definite trend because the market is volatile and the
price action is very uneven.
272
Part IV: Investment Strategies 

Relative Strength Index (RSI)
As you read earlier, the technical conditions of overbought and oversold are
important to be aware of. They are good warning flags to help you time a
trade, whether that means getting in or getting out of a position. The Relative
Strength Index (RSI) is a convenient metric for measuring the overbought/
oversold condition. Generally, the RSI quantifies the condition and gives you 
a number that acts like a barometer. On a reading of 0 to 100, you can see that
the RSI becomes oversold at or about the 30 level and overbought at or about
the 70 level.
Moving Average Convergence/
Divergence (MACD)
This is a lagging indicator that shows the relationship between two moving
averages of prices. The MACD is calculated by subtracting the 26-day exponen-
tial moving average (EMA) from the 12-day EMA. A nine-day EMA of the MACD,
called the signal line, is then plotted on top of the MACD, which acts as a 
trigger for making buy and sell orders.
That’s the technical definition of the MACD but don’t worry if you didn’t
understand it on the first round. The MACD indicator is usually provided 
by the technical analysis software or trading service that you may use. It’s
fortunately not something that you have to calculate on your own.
Crossovers and divergence
A crossover is the point when the asset’s price and an indicator intersect (or
cross over). This is used as a signal to make a buy or sell order. Say that a
stock, for example, falls past $20 per share to $19 and the 20-day moving
average is $19.50. That would be a bearish crossover and it would indicate a
good time to sell or risk further downside. The opposite is true as well; there
are crossovers that indicate a good time to buy.
Divergence occurs when the price of an asset and an indicator (or index or
other related asset) part company and head off in opposite directions.
Divergence is considered either positive or negative, both of which are signals
of changes in the price trend. Positive divergence occurs when the price of a
security makes a new low while a bullish indicator starts to climb upward.
Negative divergence happens when the price of the security makes a new high,
but bearish indicators signal the opposite and instead close lower than the 
previous high.
273
Chapter 18: Using Technical Analysis

Bollinger bands
A band plots two standard deviations away from a simple moving average.
The bollinger band works like a channel and moves along with the simple
moving average.
Bollinger bands help the technical analyst watch out for overbought and
oversold conditions. Basically, if the price moves closer to the upper band, it
is an overbought condition. If the price moves closer to the lower band, it is
an oversold condition.
Alas, as I get near the end of this chapter, I just know that I didn’t do the topic
justice due to space limitations, but as an overview, I think that it will help
you. I don’t think that you have to absorb every point and arcane calculation
but you should get a good grounding in the basics.
Short Term versus Long Term
I hope that this chapter gives you a good taste of technical analysis without
making you scratch your head. I am personally an adherent of fundamental
analysis and a value investing approach. Over the long term, history tells us
that the fundamentals ultimately win. This has usually been true even though
in the short term, the zigs and the zags can fool you. When the fundamentals
are in your favor, any short-term move against you is a buying opportunity
(provided that you chose wisely from the start). But unfortunately, too many
investors are not patient and they get too busy with the short-term trees to
be bothered by the long-term forest. Yet that long-term forest has a lot more
green, if you know what I mean. (I hope I’m not meandering here.)
In other words, a long-term investor doesn’t have to bother with things such
as triangles, pennants, cup-and-handles, or other paraphernalia. Long-term
investors just ask questions like “Is the company making money?” or “Are
financial and economic conditions still favorable for my investment?”
Now the short term is a different animal. It requires more attention and disci-
pline. You need to monitor all the indicators to see if your investment is on
track or if the signals are warning a change in course. The technicals can be
very bearish one month, very bullish the next month, and then give you mixed
signals the month after that. Being a proficient technician ultimately requires
more monitoring, more trading, and more hedging, which in turn likely means
more commissions. For more on short-term trading, turn to Chapter 16.
274
Part IV: Investment Strategies 

Remember that all this activity also means more taxes and administrative
work (tax reporting and so on). After all, who do you think will pay more in
taxes, someone who buys and holds for a year or longer or someone who
makes the same profit but by jumping in and jumping out based on which
way the technical winds are blowing? Short-term gains don’t have the same
favorable rates as long-term gains. Sometimes the issue is not what you make
but what you keep (taxes are covered in Chapter 20).

 Profiting from interventional analysis
I
n the world of investing and speculating, investors consider the usual
things, such as supply-and-demand factors, market analysis, and so on.
But you need to be aware of political and governmental intervention as well
to minimize your risk and maximize gains.
Precious Metals and Skullduggery
This is juicy stuff. Greed. Manipulation. Drama. Conflict. And that’s just before
breakfast! Precious metals — in this case gold and silver — do have a side
filled with international intrigue. Precious metals is a topic that reaches back
to the dawn of civilization and across the globe and could end up in your
wallet. International economics, politics, and financial markets have much to
do with helping you profit.
The controversy over market manipulation
Although I fully cover market-based schools of thought such as fundamental
and technical analysis in other chapters, I don’t want to leave out another
center of influence: politics. Politics and government intervention have to be
considered as well.
So what does all of this government and market intrigue mean for investors?
How can one profit from watching this stuff unfold?

Strategic assets
Among all the investment categories, precious metals — specifically gold and
silver — are in a class of investment assets referred to as strategic assets.
Strategic assets are a special category that gains interest not only from the
usual suspects — you and I and other private investors such as brokerage
firms, mutual funds, and so on — but also public entities such as govern-
ments and international government agencies such as the International
Monetary Fund.
Strategic assets are assets that have a high importance to the viability and
survivability of a sovereign state — the country’s government and economy.
Assets may become strategic, and they may also lose their strategic status.
Wood, for example, was probably a strategic asset to some society centuries
ago since it could be used for energy (fire), constructing shelters, and making
weapons (such as bows and arrows).
Examples of current strategic assets are gold, silver, oil, and government-
issued entities such as a currency. Because currencies are issued by govern-
ments, currencies can easily be used as strategic assets. A particularly good
example of this is the U.S. dollar.
A currency as a strategic asset
The U.S. dollar, which is the world’s reserve currency, can be considered a
strategic asset since it is issued by a government (our government) and held
by other countries for both economic and political purposes. Many countries
have dollar reserves because they sold the U.S. goods and services and of
course the U.S. paid in dollars. As of the summer of 2007, China had total dollar
reserves exceeding $1 trillion since it sold the U.S. so much stuff. China’s plan
is to use these dollars to buy up necessary commodities and other strategic
assets (such as precious metals, oil, and energy).
All of these dollars held by China have a political side to them: China has
threatened to sell them on the open market, which would have a harmful
effect on the value of the dollar (an inflationary impact as more dollars
become available). Such events are ultimately bullish for precious metals.
When politics heat up between countries, it stirs up other potentially nega-
tive exchanges between countries such as trade wars and tariffs.
Some commodities can be strategic assets given market and political condi-
tions. A good example is uranium. During the late 1970s, the United States had
an energy crisis and it was involved in a nuclear arms race with what was then
the Soviet Union. Since uranium was necessary for the U.S. for both economic
and military purposes, it was a strategic asset.
278
Part IV: Investment Strategies 

Strategic oil
Some assets have been strategic for centuries (such as gold). Others became
strategic assets since the 1950s as the world became more industrialized and
interdependent (such as oil). Oil is a great example of a strategic asset and its
market does ebb and flow generally with the gold market so gold investors
should be aware of this market.
Oil is a very important strategic asset for obvious reasons. Until the globe can
wean itself off of it, oil will grow in importance. The U.S. has been increasingly
dependent on foreign sources of oil since the 1970s. For this reason, the U.S.
government maintains the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR), which has (as
of 2006) over 700 billion barrels of oil. This is a critical backup supply because
of the increasingly hostile world; the U.S. imports most of its oil from coun-
tries that are unfriendly to it or that are politically unstable. As the peak oil
situation unfolds (see some information on this in Chapter 8) this situation
will get more problematic.
The impact on precious metals
In 2007 and in the years to come, due to government policy (both domestic
and international), currency issues (inflation and related currency matters),
and the relentless growth of the world population, the conditions are ripe for
a bull market in precious metals. As precious metals (along with other strate-
gic assets) grow in demand and visibility, increasing government participa-
tion in these markets has become a fact of life.
The bottom line for investors and speculators is that strategic assets gain the
attention of unusual market participants: governments and their proxies
(organizations acting on behalf of governments). Investors need to be aware
of movements in these markets to make better investment decisions.
The gold market manipulation controversy
Governments have a love/hate relationship with gold. On the one hand, it is
indeed a treasured asset and has been for centuries. How often throughout
history did that particular king or queen tell those stout-hearted explorers of
the New World they wanted gold and silver to be found and brought back. I
could just imagine some ruler saying to a returning explorer, “I pay for your
six-month trip to bring me back gold and silver and you come back with noth-
ing but spices?! And little bottles of shampoo?! Guards!”
279
Chapter 19: Following Politics and Markets

The other side of gold for governments is the part that they hate: Gold 
competes with manmade currencies. Throughout history, gold retained
acceptance as a store of value and as a medium of exchange. For smaller
transactions, silver fit the bill (literally). Currencies, on the other hand, were
subject to the whims and machinations of whomever was in power. The end
result is that abuse of currencies (increasing or inflating their supply) was
common. There have been literally thousands of currencies throughout his-
tory and across the globe that were created, inflated, and devastated. The
most common act of governmental mismanagement that impacted an entire
society has been the inflating of a currency right into oblivion. It’s incredible
how often it has happened.
Why? Think about it. If you were a ruler and you can make your central bank
create money at will by simply printing (or today, doing it electronically)
money and no one can stop you, would you? Maybe not you, but how about
the ruler after you? Ultimately, it gets done (monetary inflation). When people
hold currency that is losing value (remember that monetary inflation begets
price inflation), they’ll seek alternatives, such as gold and silver.
This is why governments frequently seek ways to suppress the price of gold.
Gold is more than an enduring asset and monetary metal. In modern times it
acts like a barometer of problematic economic ills (such as inflation). When
gold goes up in value, that becomes a signal to the public that something is
wrong. History bears this out as well.
During the late 1960s, some governments with a few favored private financial
institutions conspired to suppress the price of gold. This was the scandalous
“London Gold Pool” affair that ultimately failed. During this decade, the issue
of gold market manipulation does take on credibility as a growing body of
research and market data suggests that it is occurring (compiled by organiza-
tions such as the Gold Anti-Trust Action committee, which you can check out
at www.gata.org).
The Plunge Protection Team (PPT)
In the wake of the 1987 stock market crash, the government decided to do
something that it believed should be done to protect investors from what
seemed to be shocking gyrations in the market. As a result, a presidential
directive (Executive order 12631) was issued in early 1988 which created the
“Working Group on Financial Markets.” It was composed of the U.S. Secretary
of the Treasury, the chairman of the Federal Reserve (the central bank of the
U.S.), the chairmen of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the
Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the heads of some large
Wall Street firms, and a few others. They became a task force that would use
resources and funds provided by the federal government to intervene when
the market is experiencing a particularly bad day. This committee was nick-
named the Plunge Protection Team (PPT).
280
Part IV: Investment Strategies 

The PPT did its work in a low-profile way so that the general public was not
aware of its activity. Its activity became more noticeable after market-shaking
events such as the horrific terrorist strikes on September 11, 2001. In due
course, more congressional testimony and publicly available data (such as
minutes from meetings) slowly became available. It became evident that
some intervention did take place, either to keep the stock market from falling
or to keep some strategic assets from rising. The most common way that
gold’s price was kept from rising too far was by efforts from central banks
such as the Federal Reserve. The retired Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, did
admit that some intervention was taking place.
There were some allegations that oil, gold, and other strategic assets were
targeted to be brought down during the summer and fall of 2006 (by the gov-
ernment’s proxy brokerage firms through massive shorting techniques in the
futures market) to affect outcomes in the November 2006 elections, but that
is purely speculation at this point (until more data and evidence are made
public). Stay tuned.
The profit in market meddling
If you owned an asset and you saw its price plummet, it would be disconcert-
ing for you. If you saw it plummet because someone forced its price down,
that would be infuriating. But if you are aware of how it works, it can actually
help you profit.
The price of an asset (such as a stock or commodity) can go up or down due
to one (or both) of two factors: natural and artificial forces.
Natural forces
Natural forces means the voluntary buying and selling of market participants
(a free market). Free markets mean voluntary participation by willing buyers
and willing sellers. In a proper market, the government’s most desirable role
is a limited one; it acts like a referee. Technically (and morally) it should not
be a participant. This is supply and demand at its finest, and it has been the
most efficient human mechanism for discovering the market value and price
of goods, services, and assets. Those natural forces are folks like you and me
and umpteen consumers, producers, investors, and speculators. Natural
forces through the age-old formula of supply-and-demand result in natural
prices which are in fact an important concept for investors.
Artificial forces
Artificial forces means involuntary actions by entities that have an undue abil-
ity to force an asset’s price up or down. This is typically embodied through
governmental actions ranging from (but not limited to) taxes and customs
tariffs to market regulations and price controls. The key point to remember is
281
Chapter 19: Following Politics and Markets

that government is a coercive instrument no matter how beneficial the objec-
tive or result may be (either real or perceived). Economists such as Ludwig
von Mises (www.mises.org), Henry Hazlitt, and many others accurately
pointed out the results of this intervention.
Government intervention can affect the price of an asset in the short term,
but ultimately market forces bring the price of the asset to its natural price
over a longer period of time. If the natural price of an asset is, say, $50 and
government intervention has forced its price down to $25, then this coercion
tends to have the same impact as you forcing a spring down; ultimately the
spring whipsaws back up and typically to a higher point than its natural level
(at least temporarily). In the example of the $50 asset being forced down to
$25, the end result will probably be that it will go to, say, $75 before market
forces bring it to a natural level.
Artificially forcing a price down, for example, can be done through govern-
mental price controls. In other words, why not just pass a law decreeing that
some asset (or product or service) is fixed (or legally forced) to be at a man-
dated price? Keep in mind that when an asset’s price is artificially low, then
demand for it will be artificially stimulated while supply becomes artificially
suppressed. If producers make a profit at a natural price of $50 and the law
states that the price must be $25 then the natural result will be that produc-
ers will make less while consumers are encouraged (by the artificially low
price) to buy or consume more. Shortages will then result and will persist
until natural forces of supply and demand operate again.
Some unlikely buying and selling opportunities
In other words, government intervention (such as price controls or market
manipulation schemes) ultimately backfire. If gold, silver, and other finite,
valuable assets have a price that is artificially lower then what you have is a
classic buying opportunity. Let’s summarize. For informed investors, the fol-
lowing points offer opportunities:
 When an asset’s price is artificially suppressed below its natural price, the
asset becomes undervalued and hence becomes a buying opportunity.
 When an asset’s price is artificially raised above its natural price, the
asset becomes overvalued and hence becomes a selling opportunity.
I like the way that one market analyst put it (I wish I thought of it). He called
these government forces interventionals. So when he analyzes an investment,
he looks at three things: the fundamentals, the technicals, and the interven-
tionals. In other words, he uses fundamental analysis, technical analysis, and
interventional analysis to factor in government-related intervention.
A good example of this was China and how it played the copper market in 
the middle of this decade. China (through its intermediaries) went into the
futures market to aggressively short-sell copper futures. This heavy selling
forced the price of copper down below its market price. It then proceeded to
282
Part IV: Investment Strategies 

buy physical copper by the boatload. Immediately after this slight-of-hand
intervention, the price of copper skyrocketed. At that time, astute investors
saw that copper’s price was lower, yet their fundamental analysis suggested
that copper was very bullish. Anyone who bought (or went long) copper
futures or copper-related investments (such as copper mining stocks) would
have enjoyed some excellent gains.
Yet another take on this singular area is a variation on it called inter-market
analysis (IMA), which tries to figure out how one market can and will affect
another market; that includes government intervention. In this approach, one
doesn’t analyze government actions directly, but indirectly. If, for example, a
government entity is participating in the futures market, then IMA would take
into consideration the futures market activity and how that would affect
related markets (such as in the physical market).
Either way, it behooves the serious investor to be aware of the intervention-
als. This is more important than ever since governments across the globe are
vying more and more over natural resources. Among them, strategic assets
such as precious metals.
The metals more affected by the interventionals are gold and silver. Resources
that help you understand this are listed at the end of this chapter.
Precious Metals and Geo-Politics
In spite of the effects of government intervention in the world of strategic
assets, the global market has become more competitive so it is highly likely
that supply and demand on a global scale will win out over any intervention
that may be affecting us in American markets. There is some interesting jock-
eying for position internationally.
While central banks (technically national governmental banks) such as the
Fed and central banks in Europe have been selling off their gold reserves
(which either unwittingly or purposely has artificially driven down the price
of gold), other central banks (such as in China, Russia, and the Middle East)
have been buying gold. In the age of increasing inflation, this is disturbing.
Isn’t more gold in the national treasury a good thing especially since curren-
cies have collectively been shrinking in value due to excessive creation?
The unfolding worldwide supply and demand situation is a bullish harbinger
for precious metals. It was recently reported by the respected international
metals consulting firm, the CPM Group (www.cpmgroup.com), in their
annual publication, The CPM Gold Yearbook 2007 a very interesting fact. The
year 2006 was the first year in world history that private investors (individu-
als and private organizations) owned more gold, cumulatively, than the
world’s central banks. Go get ’em!
283
Chapter 19: Following Politics and Markets

Couple this with the fact that demand for precious metals in China, India, and
the Middle East is projected to increase and you have a very bright and shiny
outlook for gold, silver, and other precious metals.

omplicated. Expensive. Annoying. Unfair. Of course, taxes also have their
negative side, too. This is life and we deal with it. And look . . . if you’re
paying taxes, that means you’re making money so there is a bright side. The
other side of tax obligations is, of course, tax benefits. In this chapter, I explore
both as they apply to the world of precious metals and related investments.
Keep in mind that tax laws change quickly, too quickly. If this chapter is to be
relevant and accurate (as relevant and as accurate can be given relentlessly

should check and double-check with your tax advisor.
Taxable Activity
First things first. Before I discuss any tax liability from any investment trans-
actions, you first need to find out if there is any liability to begin with. Keep in
mind that your investment and speculative activity will generally take place
in one of two types of accounts: a regular account with regular activity and 
a tax-sheltered account, such as an individual retirement account (IRA) or
other retirement account (such as a 401k plan). I cover both of these accounts
in the sections that follow.
You should be aware of whom you’re paying tax to. In this chapter, although
the major concern is paying your federal taxes, you will probably also have to
deal with state and local taxes.

The regular account
The regular account is one almost all of us have. There are no special rules
except to pay tax on the following transactions:
 Dividends: Dividends are payouts by a company to its shareholders. In 
a regular account, dividends are taxable.
 Interest: Interest is paid by debtors to creditors. You can receive interest
from holding bank accounts, corporate bonds, and United States Treasury
securities (such as treasury bills and savings bonds). Municipal bonds are
generally tax-free, but find out about your own state’s tax laws.
 Capital gains: A capital gain is any gain you generate when you sell a
security or asset. If you bought something for $10 and you sell it for 
$14, then your taxable capital gain is $4. Remember that for regular
investors, you pay the capital gains tax on gains that are realized.
Those are the basic taxable transactions you will need to deal with. If your
regular account is with a stock brokerage firm, it will provide you with a 
year-end 1099 and you should keep all statements. In addition, brokerage
firms usually let their customers download trading data from their Web 
sites, which makes it easy to calculate gains and losses.
Table 20-1 shows you the types of precious metals assets covered in this
book and the potential gains you may have. This table gives you a snapshot
of what to watch out for and what could potentially be taxable with precious
metals. Check the special rules for gold and silver later in this chapter.

*In this table I mention only taxable gains (such as capital gains). Of course there are capital
losses and they are generally deductible. For more information, see the section on capital gains
and losses later in this chapter.
**Some types of precious metals investments are classified as “collectibles” and therefore get
different tax treatment (see the section “Special Tax Considerations” later in this chapter). The
treatment is actually odd and unfair but it is something to be aware of when the time comes to sell
your precious metals investment.s
One of the ways around the current taxation of your gains in a regular account
is to be aware of the benefits in the second basic type of account, the retire-
ment account.
The individual retirement account
Although there are different types of retirement accounts, I’ll just comment
about precious metals–related investments inside a typical retirement account.
The most common types are Roth IRAs and traditional IRAs. In addition, many
firms allow employees (past or present) to rollover the proceeds from a 401k
plan to an IRA (called a “rollover IRA” of course!). For simplicity, I just refer to
each of these various accounts as an IRA.
The biggest benefit of the IRA is that any gains generated in the account are
shielded from current taxes. Except for physical bullion, most forms of pre-
cious metal investments (especially paper ones such as stocks and ETFs) can
be inside an IRA. Inside the IRA, any dividends and interest can be reinvested
and are sheltered from current taxes. A major criteria in the IRA is that you
don’t withdraw any money until retirement time (you can start in the tax year
when you turn 591⁄2 years old), although there are some allowable exceptions.
287
Chapter 20: Dealing with Taxes

Because capital gains are the primary reason for getting into precious metals,
buying and selling for gain can take place inside the IRA with no tax conse-
quence. You won’t have to worry about taxes until you start removing money
from the account.
By the way, if you want to find a way to place gold and silver bullion into an
IRA, get more details in Chapter 10. The IRA is also a way to remove the pesky
unfair tax treatment of gold and silver bullion (as collectibles).
Reporting your activity
As a U.S. citizen, you report your annual taxes using Form 1040. Investment
income such as dividends and interest are reported on Schedule B. Capital
gains and losses are reported on Schedule D. Deductible investment expenses
are taken on Schedule A. These schedules cover most of the reporting that
most individuals are required to do. As always, check with your tax advisor if
you have other transactions and issues in your particular situation.
Capital Gains and Losses
The most common way to profit from precious metals–related investments is
through capital gains. The most basic point about capital gains is that they’re
taxable (see exception above regarding retirement accounts) and the tax rate
is different based on how long you hold the asset. Capital losses are generally
tax-deductible.
To keep it straight, there are two basic time frames for capital gains tax rates.
There are short-term gains (one year or less) and long-term gains (over one
year). Short-term capital gains are taxed as ordinary income, which is the
same basic tax rate as income that you earn at your job or business.
Ordinary income tax rates are considered the highest individual taxes and
because we have a progressive tax system, the more income you earn, the
higher the taxes you pay. Higher taxes refers to paying more in taxes as well
as higher tax rates (as in, you’ve made more money that bumps you into a
higher tax bracket). So if you’re not careful it ends up being a double
whammy. Check with your tax advisor.
Technically, a loss is not deductible in the same sense as when you pay a tax-
deductible expense. A loss is deductible in the sense that you can apply it
(offset it) against other income. In other words, if you have income from your
job of $30,000 and you have a loss from the sale of stock of $2,000 then your
gross income for tax purposes would be $28,000.
Generally, any capital losses you have must first offset capital gains before
they can be used against other income on your Form 1040 individual tax
return. After that, you can use up to a maximum of only $3,000 of capital
288
Part IV: Investment Strategies 

losses per tax return per year. Any amount above that is treated as “carry-
forward” losses that can be taken in future years. For more information 
about gains and losses, check out IRS publication 544.
Tax-Deductible Activity
After touching on the ugly side of taxes (paying them) we can then see the
beauty of reducing their payment (tax deductions). There is no need to go
nuts here and list all of the possible deductions but there are many.
As a general rule of thumb, the IRS allows deductibility of investment expenses
as long as they are ordinary and necessary expenses paid or incurred to either
produce or collect income or manage property held for producing income. The
expenses must be directly related to the income or income-producing property
and the income must be taxable to you. For most investors, the following
deductions generally fit that criteria and can be reported on Schedule A:
 Attorney or accounting fees
 Investment counsel and advice (which includes advisory services)
 Fees to collect income
 Safe deposit box rental fees
 Investment interest
By the way, commissions you pay when you are buying and selling securities
are not deducted directly. Instead, they become part of the cost basis of the
sale. For example, if you buy a security for $4,000 and the commission is $20,
the actual cost basis (when you figure your gain/loss at the sale later on) is
$4,020. If you sold that same security later on and sold it for $5,000 (with
another commission of $20) then the sale amount would be $4,980. The gain
would then be $960 ($4,980 sale amount less the cost of $4,020).
Keep in mind that the IRS disallows tax deductibility of some items such as
travel expenses to a stockholders’ meeting or the cost of an investment-
related seminar. IRS Publication 550 goes into greater detail.
Special Tax Considerations
For precious metals, you will probably bump into some tax concerns that are
especially related to your pursuits. In the sections that follow, I describe a
couple of these concerns that you should consider.
289
Chapter 20: Dealing with Taxes

Gold and silver as collectibles
Gold and silver are considered capital assets (unless you are a dealer, in which
case they are effectively merchandise and the income is ordinary business
income). So far, so good. However, they are considered in the same class as
collectibles such as stamps or art. Why does this matter? Collectibles are
taxed at the maximum 28% federal rate even if you hold them for more than a
year. The rule applies to both bullion and numismatic coins and bars. If you
hold the physical metal for less than a year, then the gain would be taxed as
ordinary income up to the maximum 35% federal rate. That is astonishing
and disappointing but that is the law. This rule also applies to bullion-specific
ETFs such as the Gold (symbol: GLD) and Silver (symbol: SLV) ETFs.
The tax rates hit you when the gains are realized. If you hold these properties
and they have appreciated, there is no tax consequence until the actual sale.
Fortunately, the rule generally does not affect other precious metals such as
mining stocks, options, futures, and metals-related mutual funds. Hopefully,
future tax laws will correct this unfairness.
Tax rules for traders
If you are actively trading futures contracts or options on futures contracts,
check with your tax advisor about how to proceed. If you are the occasional
trader or speculator, the odds are that the regular tax rules would apply (not
that the regular rules are so good to begin with but read on). But what if
you’re an active trader?
You may qualify as a professional trader conducting a business. It could mean
more tax deductions for you (hey . . . sounds good), but your trading then
takes on a different characteristic. It is now a business activity and the trad-
ing you do gets treated much differently. Welcome to the world of mark-to-
market accounting.
Mark-to-market (MTM) is an accounting procedure by which assets are marked,
or recorded, at their current market value, which may be higher or lower
than their purchase price or book value.
Part of the benefit of mark-to-market accounting is that you don’t have the
same tax constraints as investors. Investors, for example, have a capital loss
limit of $3,000 but not with MTM because they’re considered a trader doing
business and not an investor doing personal transactions. MTM accounting
can be complicated and you definitely need professional tax assistance with it.

Tax Resources to Keep You Up-to-Date
Yeah . . . it’s all pretty heady stuff. You may end up needing to make a fortune
with your precious metals just to have the money to pay your taxes.
Fortunately, it’s not that bad. And besides, there are countries with steeper
tax rates (like Canada and France) so you may want to consider moving to
lower-tax places (such as Ireland and the Ukraine). But you can do just fine
here in the good ’ol USA by doing a little homework. The old adage fits: The
more you know about taxes, the more money you end up keeping. Keep
informed and hopefully keep more money by checking out the resources I
discuss in the next sections.
The IRS . . . of course!
What better source on taxes than the IRS itself? You pay them the big bucks
so you might as well get the free assistance you paid for. You can get the fol-
lowing publications from the IRS by either calling 800-TAX-FORM (800-829-3676)
or by downloading them at www.irs.gov. The following publications go hand
in hand with investing in precious metals:
 Publication 17 Your Federal Income Tax: If you file form 1040 (who
doesn’t?) then this extensive guide will be very helpful.
 Publication 550 Investment Income and Expenses: This publication is
tied directly to this chapter so cozy up with it tonight.
 Publication 590 Individual Retirement Arrangements: This publication
covers IRAs in-depth and is worth a peek.
 Publication 544 Sales and other Dispositions of Assets: This publica-
tion goes into greater detail about capital gains and losses (investments
and otherwise).
If you have any tax questions and need to speak with someone, call the IRS
during business hours at 800-TAX-1040 (800-829-1040). They have extended
hours during the tax season.

An ounce of prevention . . .
Perhaps the best recommendation I can give you is the last thing I want to
express. Plan your future taxes. You heard that right. The best way to mini-
mize the tax bite is to start tax planning before the year is up. Most taxpayers
start figuring out their taxes after the tax year is done. In other words, mil-
lions of taxpayers try to figure out how to lower their tax bills (or increase
their tax refunds) for the tax year 2007 in the year 2008. With 2007 over with,
you can’t change a darn thing; you can’t change history! You can only report
what happened and spend time finding deductions and credits for what you
already did. Too late!
The best way to prepare your taxes (for, say, 2007) is to start long before 2007
ends. Keep in mind that when you do your taxable transactions, the timing is
within your power. You can control when you transact, which means you
have the power to defer, and you have the power to accelerate transactions
(like paying tax-deductible expenses). In the world of taxes, timing means a
lot. Selling securities is a perfect example: If you sold your losing positions 
in December and you sold your winning positions the following month (in
January, which is part of the subsequent tax year), you defer taxes on your
winning positions until the next tax year. Keep good records of your transac-
tions and have a tax planning session with your tax professional long before
the tax year ends. That way you will have a profitable jump on your taxes
when you can do something about them.

The Part of Tens

In this part . . .
You can’t have a For Dummies guide without the Part

track with your precious metals activity. You can find out
more about mining stocks, get some helpful guidelines for
investing and trading, and even discover some great ways
to limit your risk.

Chapter 21
Ten (Nearly) Reminders 
about Mining Stocks
In This Chapter
 Knowing what to look for
 Checking on important financial details
 Understanding the effects of regulatory and political environments
I
n stock investing, you learn to look at the company from various perspec-
tives. One analyzes the company’s products/services, management team,
financial strength, and so on. Beyond the usual, you check out those things
that are indigent to their market or industry. In that way, every group of
stocks has its own quirks and specialties. Mining stocks are no different.
The Company’s Management
The people who run an enterprise make all the difference in the world. Good
management can take mediocre properties to a profitable end result. Mediocre
or incompetent management is better off looking for loose change with a
snazzy metal detector over at the local public beach. Odds are they’ll find
base metals instead of precious metals (aluminum soda cans do have value).
Basically you want the company led by people who have experience, exper-
tise, and a track record. An easy way to do this is to see their resumés (usu-
ally posted at the company Web site). Here are some things that are a must:
 Experience: Do the executives on the management team have experi-
ence with well-known companies in the mining industry? You should be
able to see plenty of references like “The President, Abner Kaputski, has
had 47 years of experience” at large, recognizable mining companies
such as Newmont Mining or Goldcorp.

 Expertise: Besides management experience, they need to have experi-
ence in areas directly related to precious metals such as geology and
metallurgy. Having degrees from renown schools is a big plus.
 Track record: Have these executives had successful projects such as
finding properties with proven reserves? Have their projects been 
successfully converted into profitability for the company?
 Other experience: Besides precious metals–related experience, other
experience is valuable. If, for example, the company has operations in
Australia, how much experience do they have with Australia in terms of
markets and governmental issues (such as Australian mining regulations)?
Having a management team that is highly competent and experienced makes
everything else happen. Their experience, expertise, and track record should
not be a guessing game; it should be verifiable. For more information on
mining stocks, see Chapter 12.
Financing
The whole point of mining is to extract some valuable stuff from the ground
(gold, silver, and so on) and sell it to make a profit. This is a simple point but
it is not easy to do. It requires a lot of money to pay for everything from mining
equipment, to hiring geological staff, regulatory costs, and much more. A
mining project could take years before you see a dime of profit. So financing 
is a critical issue. There are some questions that need good answers:
 Does the firm have ample lines of credit to hold it through times when
profits are not rolling in?
 Does the firm have cash in the bank to cover the day-to-day expenses
until the metals are extracted and sold?
 Does the firm have joint ventures with other firms that have financial
clout (such as a major mining company)?
Mining can be a difficult and daunting task that can take a long time. Much of
the time is tied to all sorts of regulatory hurdles that must be met before any
substantive progress can be made. Until that progress materializes, the com-
pany’s bills need to be paid. Financing in the form of cash on hand or credit
(or both) will be instrumental for the company’s viability.
296
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Earnings and Cash Flow
Consistent earnings is not an issue regarding junior exploration and drilling
companies because earnings are at best inconsistent. The point about consis-
tent earnings relates to the majors — those large mining firms that are already
extracting metals and have established sales. For those investors who are
seeking conservative growth, major mining firms with consistent earnings are
a reasonable objective that will provide a catalyst to keep pushing the com-
pany’s stock price upward as the bull market unfolds.
How consistent should the earnings be? Three years or more is a good bench-
mark. In addition, each year’s profits should be greater than the year before.
Many analysts will also point out the cash flow is another important factor
and can sometimes be more important than reported earnings. Cash flow
means funds coming into the company, which may or may not include earn-
ings. Cash flow includes money coming in from the sale of metals/minerals
but also from other things, such as the sale of assets or revenue from rents
and property leasing. The point is that cash must be flowing in to cover the
day-to-day expenses until potentially profitable projects come to fruition.
The company’s publicly available financial statements can provide this 
information.
Balance Sheet Strengths
The balance sheet gives us a snapshot of where the company stands in regards
to its net worth (or stockholders’ equity). The balance sheet reflects the
equation: total assets minus total liabilities equals net worth. The balance
sheet is key to the company’s value, both real and perceived.
This is especially true if the company is a junior mining/exploratory firm
because it may not yet have revenue because they are occupied with getting
the metals out of the ground first. For these companies, the following strengths
in their balance sheet are a must:
 Proven reserves: If the company is sitting on property that has lots of
metals/minerals, this is critical to their success.
 Cash on hand: Do they have money to pay the bills until their
drilling/exploring bears fruit?
These numbers are easy to find at the company’s Web site or in its 10-K
reports which are found at www.sec.gov (use the stock symbol and find
these documents through the SEC’s EDGAR database at their Web site).
297
Chapter 21: Ten (Nearly) Reminders about Mining Stocks

Regulatory Environment
The regulatory environment is the framework inside which the company has
to operate. The regulatory environment is created and maintained by the
government. Just because a company is allowed to operate in an area, that
doesn’t mean that it can operate successfully. A good example of this is in
juxtaposing California with its neighboring state, Nevada.
California has a stringent regulatory environment that can effectively be hos-
tile to developing mining properties. I know of one company there that is still
waiting (after ten years!) for approval to develop a mining property in that
state. Nevada, on the other hand, is the most mining-friendly state in the
union. Nevada, to its credit, streamlined the regulatory process to make it
easier to mine while still adhering to environmental standards.
A mining enterprise always has to face regulatory hurdles that can be present
at many levels of government: federal, state, and local. Some hurdles are good,
of course, to address environmental concerns. However, sometimes regulations
can cross the line from being necessary to just being a barrier that ultimately
means more costs and delays for the company and its customers.
Keep in mind that regulations go beyond the U.S. It also means the countries
across the globe that allow mining. Just because a country is “politically
friendly” that doesn’t always mean that it has a conducive regulatory envi-
ronment. Companies generally send off press releases regarding what
approval they have achieved so check their Web sites for details.
Hedging and Forward Sales
Sometimes a good company with good management can make a miscalcula-
tion when it comes to the practice of hedging, which can also be called for-
ward sales. Hedging is something that could harm a company that does it in
the wrong market conditions.
Hedging refers to an industry practice of selling next year’s mine production
and locking in this year’s price. Hedging is a way to receive predictable income
for the coming year, and it can be a good practice if what you are selling has 
a price that is stable or declining during that year. However, it can be a real
problem if what you are selling is going up in price.
Say a company called Ironic Gold Mining Company (IGM) has a hedging pro-
gram and they are committed to selling one million ounces of gold (it can be
other metals, too) next year at this year’s price of $600 per ounce. If next
year’s price of gold is $600 or less, then it was a good decision. But what if
gold is in a bull market and the price is higher next year? If gold goes to $650,
298
Part V: The Part of Tens 

$700, or more, then the company won’t able to make the extra profit. IGM is
stuck with the commitment to deliver that gold at $600 per ounce no matter
how high the market price of gold goes.
It indeed becomes an ironic situation; a gold-mining company losing money
in a gold bull market! It’s like a fish drowning in water. The bottom line is that
hedging for a mining company is fine when metals prices are flat or declining
(bear market), but it is a bad practice in a bull market. Check the company’s
annual report (or Web site) to see if it engages in hedging and to what extent.
Valuable Projects or Properties
The more properties that a company has that are producing properties and/or
properties with proven reserves, the more valuable that company will be,
especially in a precious metals bull market. Again, check out the company’s
Web site and/or annual report for details.
A good analytical tool is to find out how many ounces of metal they have and
multiply it by the market price. Taking it a step further, many analysts will
look at the total shares outstanding and the total value of its metals to come
out to an asset or “book value” per share. I know of one silver company that
is at $37 per share but when you tally up the value of its total reserves, the
book value is at over $200 per share! In a precious metals bull market, that
company would be very valuable and could even be a takeover candidate by
other, larger mining companies that need reserves.
Extraction on Cost Per Ounce
This point gets to the heart of profitability. The more a company can be per-
forming cost-effectively and economically, the more profit it can make. The
more profit it can make, the better the prospects are for its stock price.
The extraction cost on a cost per ounce basis is not difficult to find out and
usually the work is already done for you. If you have a gold-mining company
that can successfully mine gold at a cost of $200 per ounce and the price of
gold is over $600 an ounce, is it profitable? At a $400 gross profit per ounce, 
I can concur with a “yee-haa!” which is Croatian for “nice profit.” Yes, mining
costs can and do go up. But . . . the price of what you are mining can and
does go up.
The wider the spread between the company’s cost of mining and the price of
what it mines (in this case, the price of gold) the more profitable the com-
pany can be (and the happier the shareholders are).
299
Chapter 21: Ten (Nearly) Reminders about Mining Stocks

Political Considerations
Governments can be hostile to gold in general and to mining companies that
own and operate properties in that government’s jurisdiction. Government
can enact high taxes and fees and/or tough restrictions. They can also simply
seize the property or otherwise harm the company. A hostile government can
break a company so this issue is an important consideration for investors.
For more details on this, check out Chapter 19.
The bottom line here is to avoid companies with exposure to problematic
governments (as of August 2007, good examples are Russia and Venezuela).
You are better off sticking to companies that operate on friendly terrain
(good examples are the United States, Canada, and Australia).

Chapter 22
Ten Rules for Metals Investors
In This Chapter
 Diversifying for success
 Using different forms of precious metals
 Understanding changes in the markets and adjusting appropriately
P
recious metals were an important part of a well-balanced portfolio in the
1970s, and they play an even more important part during this (and the
next) decade. But that doesn’t make investing in precious metals a “no-
brainer.” You need to keep some things in mind to maximize the gains and
minimize the risks.
Diversifying Your Vehicles
Although society has forced families into two-car environments, I’m talking
about making sure you have an SUV and a hybrid in your driveway. I’m refer-
ring to diversifying in precious metals by utilizing both paper and physical
vehicles. By the way, just because SUVs and hybrid cars have precious and
base metals, they are depreciating assets!
You have heard about diversification being a key factor in the long-term suc-
cess and viability of your portfolio for what seems like forever. But diversifica-
tion isn’t just a good thing for the overall portfolio; it is also important for the
particular segments inside your portfolio. Because precious metals come in dif-
ferent forms and vehicles, each of these has its own merits and drawbacks. All
the prior chapters cover these points exhaustively (believe me; I’m pooped).
Diversification can be a double-edged sword. It can minimize risk, but it can
minimize gains as well. However, if the overall precious metals market is per-
forming well, then your diversified portfolio of precious metals investments
and related vehicles should also perform well. At a bare minimum, you should
have a portfolio with 10% precious metals investments in both physical and

paper forms. If you had 50% of the precious metals portion of your portfolio 
in physical and 50% in paper form (such as stocks and ETFs), that would be a
simple and effective diversification. That could be quite appropriate for con-
servative investors.
For those who consider themselves to be aggressive investors or speculators,
a different diversification could fit. A sample model precious metals portfolio
could be 30% physical, 40% conservative paper (such as larger mining com-
pany stock and ETFs) and the remaining 30% could (should) be a mix of junior
mining stocks and options.
For those investors who are seeking income, consider the conservative port-
folio coupled with writing options such as covered calls to generate income.
(Chapter 15 has more on writing covered call options.)
Having Some Bullion Coins
Having physical precious metals is a good part of the foundation of your port-
folio. Although I like collectible numismatic coins (as covered extensively in
Chapter 11), it may not be suitable for beginners because of all the issues
involved that one must be aware of (such as grading, mintage, dealer markups,
and so on), so bullion coins make a lot of sense (cents?).
The best ones to concentrate on are gold and silver bullion coins and issues
that have a large market to make it easy to buy and/or sell them. The U.S. Mint
issues both gold and silver eagles, and they can be affordable. The gold eagles
come in 1 ounce, 1⁄2 ounce, 1⁄4 ounce and even 1⁄10 ounce sizes, which make
owning physical gold convenient. A silver eagle is 1 ounce of silver and also
affordable. Many investors also like to acquire bags of “junk silver” which also
have a large and fluid market. More details on bullion coins are in Chapter 10.
Part of bullion’s appeal is its enduring value and that you don’t have to worry
about a third party’s performance. An example is a mining stock. You could
have say, a gold-mining company’s stock price plunge due to factors, such as
company mismanagement or external factors, such as political risk. A variety
of factors could plausibly make a gold-mining stock go bankrupt even when
gold’s price is rising. Owning physical gold or silver in bullion form gives you
a measure of safety when there are so many things that could go wrong in the
world, precious metals–related or not.
The bottom line is that bullion coins are a reasonable, convenient and rela-
tively low-risk way to participate in a long-term bull market in precious
metals. Every serious investor (and a few light-hearted speculators) should
consider bullion.

Part V: The Part of Tens 

Limiting Your Exposure
You may think that this is advice for you sun bathers out there, but it’s another
wrinkle to iron out in your portfolio. Is there any single investment that occu-
pies too large a percentage of your total financial picture? Yes, if it does well
you would look like a genius and you could go shopping for that yacht that you
always dreamed of. However, more times than not, it can have a negative
impact. Either reduce how much you have or watch it like a hawk by using a
disciplined approach (such as trailing stops, which are detailed in Chapter 16).
Watching the Markets That 
Affect Precious Metals
Precious metals don’t operate in a vacuum. They do get affected, positively
or negatively, by other markets that may not seem related to precious metals.
The same way that aspirin and bear markets are connected (think about it),
so precious metals are affected by:
 Currency markets — if national currencies (such as the dollar or yen) are
strong, this generally translates into weaker or lower prices for metals.
 News about rising prices at the grocery store or the gasoline pump alert
people to price inflation and hence will have a positive impact on gold
and silver.
 Reports of metal supply shortages in countries with extensive mining
industries would have an upward effect on precious metals.
All investors and speculators should make it second nature in their decision-
making process to look at the cause-and-effect aspects of the economy and
financial markets. There is in fact an entire school of thought on this very
idea: inter-market analysis. It makes a lot of sense because markets and
economies across the world are becoming more interdependent.
For precious metals, the most obvious markets to watch are
 Currencies: Especially the dollar and the euro.
 Industry: Any industry that produces or uses a lot of metal in its
processes (both in the U.S. and foreign markets).
 Commodities: Food and energy are sensitive to inflation and supply-and-
demand factors.
 Money supply: The growth of the money supply is a leading factor in the
precious metals market.

Using Options to Boost Performance
Options are a fantastic tool in the investors’ wealth-building arsenal. Just
about any portfolio, aggressive or conservative, could benefit from some
options strategy.
Whether you use options to generate income (covered call-writing) or as
insurance against a drop in your stock’s price (protective put), look into
options. For more information, check out Chapter 15.
Adding Alternatives
Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and mutual funds (MFs) are ideal additions to
any portfolio. Because there are some excellent precious metals (and mining
stocks) ETFs and MFs, they make a convenient way to automatically add a
diversified investment to your portfolio.
I could write a whole chapter on these great securities. Wait a minute... I did!
Check out Chapter 13 and be glad I remembered.
Adjusting along the Way
No investment strategy is set in stone. Set-it-and-forget-it is a fine anthem for
that gizmo advertised on late-night TV, but markets are constantly moving
and changing. Companies are constantly changing. The political and economic
environments are constantly changing. As you have investments that have
performed well and have been with you over the years, modest or major
adjustment is prudent. Pruning and rebalancing the portfolio is not done for
cosmetic purposes; you need your investments to keep growing. Bull and
bear markets go a long way but they do end at some point.
You don’t have to time it exactly but as you read the news and industry
reports, you start to get clues and warnings about what’s happening. Some-
times those clues come from the public and not the usual suspects in the
financial media. When the whole world was crowing about getting rich with
Internet stocks in 1999, prudent investors started adjusting their portfolios.
Start either paring back some of your holdings (or at least put trailing stops
on) when you see lots of media attention about precious metals and how
average folks are getting rich. Make those adjustments. It’s better to be a 
year too early than a day too late.

Understanding the Difference between 
a Correction and a Bear Market
In the summer of 2006, precious metals, energy, and other commodities expe-
rienced a correction or a temporary pull-back in their prices. Gee, why say
correction? It sure as heck doesn’t feel correct (it feels pretty incorrect actu-
ally). Anyway, a correction is a temporary, normal, and healthy part of a bull
market. Sure it might make you twinge when you see your investment go
down 10% or 20%. It is not unusual to see precious metals corrections go
down an unsettling 30%. What are you going to do?
First, understand the difference between a correction and a bear market. It is
like the difference between fainting and dropping dead. In a healthy, long-term
bull market, frequent corrections are part of the process. Prices drop tem-
porarily for various reasons such as profit taking and similar events that 
are not evidence of a fundamental change in the prospects of that asset or
industry.
Take gold for example. If you saw a chart spanning 2000–2007, you’d see a
beautiful sight: a gorgeous zig zag sloping upward through that seven-and-a-
half-year time frame. It went from under $300 (technically, the bottom was in
2001 at $252), and it went over $670 in early August 2007. But during that time
it had some scary, financially bruising periods. That chart would show you
no less than seven corrections of 10% to 30%. Ouch! However, that’s part of
the precious metals world. Bull markets and corrections go together like . . .
uh . . . Jekyll and Hyde (sort of).
How would you know the difference? In a word: fundamentals. What are the
fundamentals? For precious metals, this is a general reference to things such
as supply and demand, economic trends, and other factors that affect the
price. Over the span of this decade, investment and industrial demand for
gold rose significantly while supply (mined from the earth) did not. As China
and India became economic powerhouses, their appetite for gold also grew.
The bottom line is that gold’s market looks strong for years to come.
A good example of a bear market (when an asset or industry has a very long
period of dropping prices) is what happened to Japan’s real estate market
during the 1990s. Real estate values hit an all-time high in early 1991. However,
the very expensive prices diminished demand. More houses put on the
market increased supply. What followed was 12 consecutive years of falling
prices. In late 1991, Japan’s housing market didn’t faint; it dropped dead.
305
Chapter 22: Ten Rules for Metals Investors

Watching Political Trends
Gold and silver do have political overtones. The reason being that for thou-
sands of years gold and silver served as money. In recent centuries (espe-
cially since the 1930s), governments came to see gold and silver as competing
with their own money (currency or fiat money). It became one of those weird
relationships you’d see on Dr. Phil. Governments hated gold and silver
because they wanted their own currency to dominate, but they also loved
gold so their central banks kept a batch of it in safekeeping. The bottom line
is that gold can be coveted and confiscated in some political jurisdictions
and during certain economic conditions (as was the case in the U.S. during
the Great Depression).
How could this affect you in a real way? Say you own stock of a gold-mining
company that has significant gold-rich properties in a politically unstable
country. What would happen to the value of your stock if that foreign govern-
ment seized that company’s properties?
Make sure you invest in mining stocks with little or no exposure to hostile or
unfriendly political jurisdictions. Generally, governments that are communist,
fascist, or socialist are more apt to nationalize (seizure by government force)
the property of foreign companies (such as U.S. mining companies). Keep a
close eye on those elections! Check out Chapter 19 for more on the politics of
precious metals.
Monitoring Inflation
Many precious metals analysts will tell you that the primary catalyst for a
precious metals bull market (and natural resources in general) is inflation.
History bears this out. Governments may have the power to print more and
more money (inflate the money supply otherwise known as monetary inflation),
but they can’t print more gold and silver. When a growing supply of dollars
seeks out limited supplies of gold and silver, ultimately gold and silver go up.
As this book is being written, the major countries of the world are increasing
(again, “inflating”) their money supply at double-digit rates. In an inflationary
environment (as we have now), gold and silver (and other precious metals)
are sensible parts of a well-balanced portfolio.

Ten Rules for Metals Traders
In This Chapter
 Knowing what to do before you start trading
 Benefiting from the experience of others
 Minimizing losses
I
f you read nothing else about trading (and you should read everything
about it) then at least get the most important points for beginners by
checking out this chapter.
Faking Out the Markets First
The cheapest lessons are the ones that you learn without losing a fortune. It
almost sounds like “starve a cold and feed a fever” (or was that the oppo-
site?), but it says that the novice or beginning intermediate trader doesn’t
save up a big chunk of money and jump right into the market while saying “I
better get in now before I miss some opportunities.” No, there is no hurry.
There are trading opportunities every day and in every free market, in good
times, bad times, and some mediocre ones as well.
It is better to miss ten good opportunities than to get steamrolled by a bad
one. The first thing you should do (besides educating yourself on the market,
which I hope that you are doing long before you got to this chapter) is to do
some simulated trading.
Also called “paper trading” (for that matter, call it make-believe trading), sim-
ulated trading is easier to do than ever before thanks to the Internet and lots
of great trading software and services covering the booming financial mar-
kets. Apply your ideas, thoughts, theories, and hunches without risking your
money. Start with some fake, play money of $10,000 or whatever. Price out
some trades and strategies and then track your simulated positions over a
few days or a few weeks. How well do you do? More importantly, what did
you learn about your choices and how the market behaves?

Having a Plan
You don’t have to be General Patton with a grand strategy to proceed. But for
crying out loud, have some plan. Ask yourself:
 What am I trying to accomplish?
 What losses am I willing to tolerate?
 What are my strategies to accomplish my trading objectives?
The adage is as old as the hills: Those who fail to plan, plan to fail. Such a
phrase was probably coined by that “starve a fever” guy.
A plan is just a disciplined approach in paper (or on your computer) that gives
you clear, unemotional guidance about how to go about accomplishing your
trading objectives. Trading shouldn’t be guesswork (the markets may require
some guesswork), but you should have your bases covered so that you know
 When to get out
 When to get in
 When you take profits
 How much losing you will tolerate
It’s not that different from when my wife and I would go to a casino. We would
play $40 (yeah, big spenders!) at the roulette table. If we lose, we lose $40. If
we win a little, then we had some fun. If we are winning nicely, we pull out the
original $40 (it can pay for parking and lunch) and maybe another $20 just in
case and play the rest for a limited time (for an hour or until show time). It
works for us. More importantly, it’s a plan we stick to. What’s your plan? What
are your limits?
Avoiding Committing All 
Your Cash at Once
I think that this is a big point especially with novice traders. If you have a few
thousand and you deploy it immediately, then you can lose it immediately. I
spoke to my friend and futures broker, Charlie, and he told me something
quite profound. He quoted an observation in the futures industry. The aver-
age beginning investor who starts with $5,000 or less in a brokerage account
usually loses all of it and closes the account within six months. Yikes!
308
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Yet, if you commit some money now and wait, you could catch more opportu-
nities. If your position is down and you think you chose wisely, then having
some extra cash on the sidelines means that you could jump in at a much
better price. It’s a good idea to stagger the approach so you can take advan-
tage of the market’s short-term ups and downs.
Taking Profits Doesn’t Hurt
If you are on a hot streak it’s a common enticement to “let it ride!” That may
not be a bad idea in the world of investing when you can afford to ride out
the market’s short-term ebbs and flows, but trading means looking for oppor-
tunities on a more regular basis. You may end up in a position that will be
profitable, and you may agonize about getting out or staying in. That’s your
call, but the bottom line is that there is no harm in locking in a profit when
the market is. That means that you will have cash on the sidelines ready to
get back in with the next opportunity.
I have for my students something I call the “100% club.” This means that the
account is grown to the point that 100% of their original money is taken out
and the only money left in the account is 100% profit (we like to call it “house
money”). Even if the worse-case scenario hits — losing all the money — does
no harm. When times look great, consider taking some money “off the table.”
Using Hedging Techniques
Before you leave that message with your gardener, think again. Proficient
traders do some things in their trading to protect themselves if the market
goes against them. If they buy stock because they expect that stock to go up,
they may also buy a protective put just in case the stock goes down. In other
words, if you are very bullish about the market or a particular asset, consider
hedging; do some things in the account that would do well if you are wrong
or if the market temporarily moves against you. A seasoned trader will have
on a variety of positions to take advantage of different market outcomes
(especially if they are unwelcome outcomes!). Discover all the ways that you
can hedge in your account (do your homework and speak to your broker
about your various options).
309
Chapter 23: Ten Rules for Metals Traders

Knowing Which Events Move Markets
Except for sudden, unexpected events (such as a terrorist attack or that visit
from Uncle Mo), most market-driving events can be seen coming and you can
prepare for them. Events such as government announcements, industry news,
political developments, and so on can help you be a more proficient trader.
Financial markets don’t act in a vacuum; they frequently react to the world
around them. Become an avid news and market observer and keep asking
yourself questions that test your logic and common sense. Learn the differ-
ences between problems and symptoms and causes and effects. Although
markets can seem crazy and irrational in the short term, they ultimately end
up acting logically as market conditions unfold. That means that ultimately,
your common sense, logic, and market intelligence can help you meet your
trading objectives (and make lots of bucks!).
Checking the Trading History
How does your chosen trading vehicle behave, price-wise? Does it have a
slow season? What has it done in the past? Also, what has it done in the 
past under the same conditions today? In trading, you may only be looking
forward a few days, weeks, or a few months, but looking backward, you
should be reviewing that asset’s behavior over years (if possible). Some
investment vehicles have trading data going back decades. Because markets
tend to be cyclical and they tend to take on characteristics that have hap-
pened before, the trading history does matter. Be aware of it and learn to 
act accordingly.
Using Stop-Loss Strategies
Because the markets do move fast and in unexpected ways, it’s good to have
a disciplined approach that can “automatically” limit losses. Speak to your
broker about what loss-limiting orders and techniques can help enhance 
your trading proficiency. Many traders will use stop-loss orders or trailing-
stop strategies, which can limit the downside. Don’t confuse this with hedg-
ing which means employing strategies that can be profitable in the event you’re
wrong or if the market goes against you. Stop-loss strategies are there to get
you out of a position before small losses turn into big losses.

Part V: The Part of Tens 

Embracing the Experience of Others
Whatever you think of the market or whatever ideas or strategies you may be
considering, keep in mind that many people came before you and they have
cumulatively seen it all! There are many winners and even more losers and
their experiences are there for you to learn from. There are scores of books,
Web sites, and newsletters from those who have done it. I include some of my
favorites in Chapter 16. If you find out that the majority of successful traders
do technical analysis and also employ techniques A, B, and C, then learn 
from that. What did they do that worked? What mistakes of theirs can you
learn from?
Minimizing Transaction Costs
Profitable trading isn’t just about what you make; it’s also about what you
keep. It wasn’t that long ago that day-trading was all the rage. But for every
day-trader who made a profit, there were hundreds who lost money. The one
thing that both winners and losers in the world of day-trading had in common
was paying lots of commissions. More trading activity means more commis-
sions and fees. Find ways to cut costs without compromising on your plan
and your trading objectives because these costs affect your net profit.

I
nvesting and speculating isn’t just about making money. It’s also about lim-
iting losses. Anything you put your money in that trades in a marketplace
of buyers and sellers has the chance to go down as well as up. Maximizing the
upside while minimizing the risk of loss can be done without much difficulty.
Successful investing isn’t just what to invest in, it’s also the way you do it.
Staggering Your Entry
If you open an account, say stock brokerage account, and your initial invest-
ment is $20,000, what will you do? Many investors will probably invest all 
or most of it immediately. Hey, you sure don’t want to miss that gravy train
leaving the station for “fabulous-profits-ville”! Do you?
Well, if you’re a patient investor and you chose wisely, that’s okay. But the
reality is that investments zig-zag. Sometimes watching investments is like
watching water on a stovetop wondering when it’s going to boil. Investments
tend to go up a little today and then go down a little tomorrow. Sometimes
you get in on a Monday and watch as prices plunge the next day. You then get
into the “woulda, coulda, shoulda” of the world of investing. “Gee, had I only
waited a day or two I could have gotten in at a much better price!” What’s an
investor to do?
The odds are overwhelming: You’ll probably never buy something at the exact
bottom, and you’ll never sell something at the exact top. You can only look at
that price of that investment on that day and say “Is it worth it for me to buy
now?” Much of the market can be unknowable since you can’t read the minds
of literally millions of investors both big and small. Don’t even try. But who
said that investing all of your money in one fell swoop immediately was the
right way to go?

In the short term, markets today are more volatile and more irrational than at
any time in history. Large financial institutions, governments, hedge funds,
and other large players are moving large amounts of money — billions and
trillions — in and out of the market at lightning speed. With the advent of
globalization, the Internet, and other technology, huge amounts of money can
zip around markets and economies at the speed of a mouse-click, 24 hours a
day. This is why you should stagger your entry.
If, say, you have $10,000 or more to invest, start off investing a quarter or a
third of that and wait a few days or a few weeks. Watch your investment and
watch the marketplace for news, events, and announcements. If your invest-
ment went down and it is still a good asset (say a stock or an ETF), then con-
sider buying more of it. If it was a great investment when you first bought it
then it’s better as you buy it at a bargain price.
Unless you have a small amount to invest, it’s always good to have some
investable funds on the sideline — earning interest — waiting for 
opportunities.
Using Trailing Stops
Although I cover this point in other venues (such as Chapter 16), I think it
merits some attention especially in a chapter dealing with risk.
Trailing stops is the active strategy of putting a stop-loss order on your invest-
ment (usually a stock or ETF) and adjusting it upward as the investment rises
in price. Basically, the purpose of a stop loss is to sell your investment at a
specified time if it falls to keep it from losing further. Stop-loss orders don’t
stop the investment from going up or limit how high it goes; the orders are
there to limit the downside.
As I write this in the summer of 2007, there are dozens of mortgage companies
that are struggling or going out of business. Many of them are publicly traded
and were in many investors’ portfolios. Although there were reports around
for months that there are massive problems with mortgages (specifically 
sub-prime mortgages which are mortgages issued to those who have below-
average or poor credit), the stock prices of mortgage firms held up well until
2007. Then, you see their stock prices plummet 80% to 95% in literally a few
days. This would have been an ideal situation in which trailing could have
been used.
Using trailing stops doesn’t mean that you were certain that the stocks you
held were going to plummet. After all, if you were certain, then you’d defi-
nitely sell your stock immediately. Trailing stops are there for those who are
not certain about what will happen to the stock in question.
314
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Put yourself in that position for a moment. If you had stock in a mortgage firm
and the stock’s price was rising yet you are reading about potential problems
in the mortgage industry, what would you do? What would a prudent investor
do? If that was me, I’d put on a trailing stop so that I can have a measure of
protection (and be able to sleep at night).
For precious metals stocks and ETFs, there will come a time when the outlook
for them will be uncertain. Not this year or even this decade but sometime in
the distant future reports will come out about stagnating or falling demand
for precious metals and how supply is increasing because of a mining boom
due to sky-high prices. It will be a time when the industry is still feeling ebul-
lient, the same way that the mortgage industry was feeling ebullient in 2005
and early 2006. But when that time comes for your investments, don’t get
cutesy about it and don’t assume that your crystal ball is correct; take some
commonsense protective measure such as applying loss-limiting strategies
such as the trailing stop.
Diversifying Positions
Being diversified in your investments is certainly addressed elsewhere in this
book and in just about every investing how-to book out there. But how could
I avoid the topic of diversification in a chapter on limiting risk? It’s like trying
not to write about fruits and vegetables in a book about avoiding meat.
All that aside, diversifying the positions (such as stocks) in your account is
more essential now than it was in the past. Today, the markets are faster and
more volatile. Conditions (such as globalization) and challenges (such as ter-
rorism) are more complex and problematic. Large swings up and down by the
market indexes are more frequent and more extreme. The moment a problem
is reported in an industry you can see a major sell-off occur very rapidly.
Having different positions in different stocks will minimize risk.
Diversifying in Markets
Yes, this is a book that unabashedly embraces precious metals. But that
doesn’t mean to only be in the precious metals market. I mean, I like Elvis
Presley too but he is only a small part of my record — uh — CD collection.
Allow me to take this small snippet of the book to encourage you to have
your money in some other segments of the market that will benefit you and
be a good diversification away from just metals.
315
Chapter 24: Ten Ways to Limit Risk

Of course, in my financial seminars I tell my students to be diversified, but
what do you diversify in? A hundred investing experts will tell you a hundred
different ideas about what to put your money in. In the realm of stock invest-
ing, there are areas to invest in that just make a lot of sense and have proven
results over time. I think that every investor, conservative or aggressive,
should invest in the stocks of proven companies that produce goods and 
services that people need.
As this book is being written, major events are happening across the global
financial markets. The world is overburdened with massive debt and with
huge derivative positions. How huge? The world’s gross domestic product
(GDP) is approximately $45 trillion (as of the end of 2006), yet worldwide
derivatives total a staggering $400+ trillion! The United States has a GDP (as
of early 2007) of $13 trillion, yet it alone has a debt load of $46 trillion (not
including unfunded Social Security and Medicare liabilities of over $50 trillion).
These issues don’t include other issues that will adversely affect financial mar-
kets such as inflation, mortgage-market meltdowns, currency devaluations, 
terrorism, trade wars, natural disasters, and so on. This complex and uncer-
tain environment poses many risks for the economy in general and the stock
market in particular. All of these reasons are why precious metals are high 
on my list, but, in addition, I want to invest in the necessities of life.
In addition to precious metals, consider diversifying into things that the
world’s burgeoning population needs such as buying stock in proven compa-
nies that provide food, water, energy, and other necessities. Since 2000, the
general area of natural resources has quietly been outperforming other areas
of the investment world, yet the public is barely aware of it. Let me give you
an example: water stocks. There are few things more necessary for life 
than water (outside of oxygen and chocolate, of course). During 2000–2006,
investors who put their money in water stocks did much better than investors
in tech stocks or Nasdaq or the Dow.
Investing in the necessities of life may not sound sexy or exciting (compared to
the latest Internet or biotech stock) but the long-term results can be superior.
Diversify among Different Vehicles
Don’t confuse “vehicles” with “markets” (while you’re at it, don’t confuse
investment vehicles with “automobiles”). Stocks, bonds, and options are dif-
ferent investment vehicles. With precious metals, you are best advised to
spread your money across different vehicles in the galaxy of precious metals.
Look into precious metals bullion, stocks, ETFs, and so on. Read a good book
in various precious metals investments. (Hold on . . . you already have one in
your hands, so take a look at the table of contents.)

Read the Best Sources
It might cause some suspicion when you hear anyone using the word best. To
some it is a subjective term: What’s best to you may not be best to me. But
fortunately, I’m not talking about movies or 17th-century antique furniture.
I’m talking about information and advisory services that have consistently
offered quality recommendations and research to help you make informed
decisions. Different sources have different strengths. For the best source of
financial and economic news and data, I like 
 Market Watch (www.marketwatch.com)
 Bloomberg (www.bloomberg.com)
 Publications, such as the Wall Street Journal, Barron’s, and Investors
Business Daily (and their Web sites)
In the specific realm of precious metals, I want to read sources that specialize
in them, have tracked them for a long time, and have a good track record in
terms of profitable recommendations. Another big plus is if they generally
embrace the economic school of thought that has been the most “on target”
with economic analysis and forecasting such as the Austrian school of eco-
nomics (the best place to learn about this is the Ludwig von Mises Institute at
www.Mises.org). Sources that fit this description include analysts, such as:
 Doug Casey
 Jay Taylor
 James Sinclair
 Peter Grandich
 David Morgan
 Howard Ruff
 Harry Schultz
Not including these names in a book about precious metals would be like
writing a book about stocks and not mentioning Warren Buffet and Benjamin
Graham.
For market news on precious metals, some of the best sources of information,
data, and commentary are
 Gold Eagle (www.gold-eagle.com)
 Mine Web (www.mineweb.com)
 The Bullion Desk (www.thebulliondesk.com)
 Kitco’s Gold Sheet Links (www.goldsheetlinks.com)

Chapter 24: Ten Ways to Limit Risk

Use your broker as an informational resource. Many brokers can provide e-mail
alerts on conditions that you stipulate, such as when a stock hits a certain
price level or to provide you alerts on news items such as government
announcements, industry developments, and so on.
Using Protective Puts
A put option is a vehicle that you can buy that can go up in value when the
asset you are buying it on is dropping in value. Basically, buying a put on
some security is like making a bet that it will go down and you get a chance
to sell that put at a profit. Buying a put option is speculating, but in this chap-
ter that is not why it is being mentioned. You can use it as a form of insurance
called the protective put.
A protective put is an option that you buy on your own stock or ETF. The pro-
tective put is a great way to offset the potential downside risk associated with
your stock or ETF. Say you own 100 shares of XYZ company stock and its 
current market value is $50 per share. You are concerned that it may drop in
value (for whatever reason) in the near future. You buy a protective put on
XYZ so that if the stock goes down in value, the protective put will go up in
value. The temporary loss in the stock price could be offset either partially
or completely by the profit on the protective put, thereby protecting the
value of your position in XYZ stock.
(By the way, I think XYZ stock should be okay. I’ve seen it mentioned in nearly
every stock book I have ever read so I’m sure that lots of people are buying
it.) Protective puts are a great way to limit risk. Find out more about puts
(protective and otherwise) in Chapter 15.
Avoiding Unstable Political Markets
Finding and tapping into a gold mine is great. But what if it is located in a
politically unfriendly jurisdiction? That will be an issue for the health and
well-being of your mining stocks. Across the world, more governments view
natural resources as strategic assets and are forcibly extending their reach
into these areas. In recent years, investors in natural resources (such as pre-
cious metals) witnessed these unsettling events. The governments of Russia,
Mongolia, and Venezuela (among others) nationalized (the governments
seized) properties, such as mines, of foreign companies (many from the U.S.),
which resulted in declines of the companies’ stock.
318
Part V: The Part of Tens 

It’s not difficult to find out if a company has too much exposure to politically
unfriendly governments. Generally, the more “free” a country is, the better
the political environment. Specifically, you would like a country that has a
free market and established private property rights in an English common
law framework. Organizations like Freedom House (www.freedomhouse.
org) keep track of countries and rate them as “free,” “partly free,” and 
“not free.”
The next things to look at are the company’s Web site and annual report,
which will tell you where the company’s properties are located. After that, 
it becomes easier to decide what companies are safer than not for your
investment dollars.
Looking at Past Trading Patterns
Although I am not usually an aficionado of technical analysis, there are some
things about charts that give you some valuable guidance. A stock chart (or
one on futures or indexes) that spans the most recent six months, a year, or
longer can give you some valuable perspective. You can see the price ranges
and patterns that will give you a gauge that measures that investment’s
volatility and activity. Say you’re looking at a mining stock that is at $40 a
share and its chart shows that in the past 12 months the stock has swung
from $30 a share to $50 in a roller-coaster fashion. You can compare it to the
trading patterns of other stocks in general and with stocks in the same indus-
try. This helps you decide if this stock is too volatile (or not volatile enough)
for your tastes. It helps you decide where to set stop-loss orders or when it
might be time to reduce your exposure.
Taking Some Chips off the Table
It never hurts to take profits. Every now and then, you will have a position
that is very profitable. Why not take some profits by cashing in? How would
you know when to do it? In some cases, the investment itself will tell you
(news and data you come across as you monitor your investment). In other
cases, your own personal situation may tell you. Do you have or can you see
coming some financial needs? If you have a profitable stock and you noticed
that your credit card bill has gotten too high, perhaps that is a good signal to
cash out some of your winning positions.
