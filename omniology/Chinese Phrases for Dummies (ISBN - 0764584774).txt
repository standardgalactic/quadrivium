Introduction
G
lobalization has made familiarity with other
people, cultures, and languages not only prefer-
able in the 21st century, but also essential. With the
help of the Internet, reaching out and touching some-
one on the other side of the world has become as
easy as the click of a mouse. And yet, nothing quite
beats the excitement of a face-to-face encounter with
someone who hails from the other side of the globe in
his or her own language. Communication in cyber-
space doesn’t even come close.
Whether you’re going around the world for business,
getting ready to study overseas, interested in fre-
quenting Chinatown, befriending a Chinese-speaking
classmate or coworker, or just plain curious about
China, Chinese Phrases For Dummies can help you get
acquainted with enough Chinese to carry on a decent
conversation on any number of topics. You won’t
become fluent instantly, of course, but this book
helps you greet a stranger, buy a plane ticket, order
some food, and even adopt a baby. This book also
gives you some invaluable cultural tips so that you
can not only rattle off those newly acquired words
and phrases, but also back them up with the right
behavior at the right time.
I design this book to help guide you toward the suc-
cessful use of one of the most difficult languages on
earth. I hope this book makes studying Chinese fun.
About This Book
The good news is that you can use Chinese Phrases
For Dummies anytime, anywhere. No mandatory class
sessions, no exams, and no homework assignments to
dread. Need to get to a business meeting after you
arrive in a new town? Just turn to the chapter on

Chinese Phrases For Dummies 
2
travel to find out how to haggle for a plane ticket,
determine the price, and get to the airport on time.
Have to make a sudden trip to the doctor? Turn to the
chapter on health and figure out how to tell your care-
givers exactly what ails you.
The beauty of this book is that it can basically be all
things to all people. You don’t have to memorize one
chapter before moving on to the next, if what the
second chapter deals with what you really need. Read
as much or as little as you want, as quickly or as
slowly as you like. Whatever interests you is what you
can focus on. And remember: You’re discovering a
language that simultaneously represents one of the
world’s oldest civilizations and one of today’s fastest
growing economies.
Note: If you’ve never taken Chinese before, you may
want to read Chapters 1 and 2 before you tackle the
later chapters. They give you some of the basics that
you need to know about the language, such as how to
pronounce the various sounds.
Conventions Used in This Book
Pay attention to a couple of conventions that can help
you navigate this book’s contents:
 Chinese terms are set in boldface to make them
stand out.
 Pronunciations and meanings appear in paren-
theses immediately after the Chinese terms. The
pronunciations are in italics.
This book uses the pinyin (literally: spelling the way it
sounds) romanization of Chinese words. What does
that mean? Well, if you go to China, you see signs in
Chinese characters, but if you look for something in
English, you may be hard pressed to find it. Whatever
signs you see in roman letters are in pinyin, the
romanization system developed by the Communists
in the 1950s, so seeing pinyin in this book is good
practice for you.

Introduction

Something else to keep in mind as you begin to under-
stand Chinese is that many of the English translations
you see in this book aren’t exactly literal. Knowing the
gist of what you hear or see is more important instead
of what individual words in any given phrase mean.
For example, if you translate “horse horse tiger tiger”
literally into Chinese, you have the phrase meaning
“so so.” You’re not actually talking about animals.
Whenever I give a literal translation, I preface it with
“literally” in italics.
Foolish Assumptions
Some of the foolish assumptions I made about you
while writing Chinese Phrases For Dummies are
 You don’t know any Chinese, except for maybe 
a couple of words you picked up from a good
kung-fu movie or the word “tofu,” which you
picked up while grocery shopping.
 Your goal in life isn’t to become an interpreter of
Chinese at the United Nations. You just want to
pick up some useful words, phrases, and sen-
tence constructions to make yourself under-
stood when speaking Chinese.
 You have no intention of spending hours and
hours memorizing Chinese vocabulary and
grammar patterns.
 You want to have fun while trying to speak 
a little Chinese, like at your local Chinese 
restaurant.
Icons Used in This Book
The cute little icons in the left-hand margins highlight
the kind of information you’re looking at and can help
you locate certain types of information in a hurry.
This book’s five icons are

The bull’s-eye appears wherever I highlight 
a great idea to help make your study of
Chinese easier.
This icon serves as a reminder about particu-
larly important information concerning
Chinese.
The icon acts as a stop sign in your mind. It
warns you something you need to avoid
saying or doing so that you don’t make a fool
of yourself.
This icon clues you in on fascinating bits of
information about China and Chinese cul-
ture. Knowledge of a culture goes hand in
hand with knowledge of a foreign language,
so these icons help light the way as you
embark on your journey.
This icon highlights various rules of gram-
mar that may be unusual. Even though this
book doesn’t focus primarily on grammar, by
paying attention to these little grammatical
rules as they pop up can only enhance your
successful execution of the language.
Where to Go from Here
Chinese is often considered one of the toughest 
languages in the world to master. Don’t worry. The
good news is that you’re not trying to master it. All
you want is for people to understand you when you
open your mouth. All you have to do now is turn to
whichever chapter piques your curiosity and keep
practicing your favorite Chinese phrases when you’re
with your family and friends in Chinatown.

ime to get your feet wet with the basics of
Chinese. This chapter gives you the guidelines
that help you pronounce words in standard Mandarin
(the official language of both the People’s Republic 
of China and Taiwan) like a native speaker and helps
you get a handle on the four tones that distinguish
the Mandarin dialect. After you have the basics down,
we show you how to construct basic Chinese phrases.
But before you dive in, here’s a bit of advice: Don’t be
intimidated by all the tones! When studying a foreign
language, don’t worry about making mistakes the
minute you open your mouth.

The Written Word: Yikes! 
No Alphabet!
With so many distinct dialects in Chinese, how do
people communicate with each other? The answer
lies in . . . (drum roll) . . . the written word.
Say you see two Chinese people sitting next to each
other on a train traveling from Canton to Shanghai. If
the Cantonese speaker reads the newspaper out loud,
the guy from Shanghai won’t have a clue what he’s
saying. But if they both read the same newspaper arti-
cle silently to themselves, they could understand
what’s going on in the world. That’s because Chinese
characters are uniform all across the country.
Chinese words are written in beautiful, often
symbolic configurations called characters.
Each character is a word in and of itself, and
sometimes it’s a part of a compound word. It
makes no difference if you write the charac-
ters from right to left, left to right, or top to
bottom, because you can read and under-
stand them in any order. 
During the Han dynasty, a lexicographer named Xu
Shen identified six ways in which Chinese characters
reflected meanings and sounds. Of these, four were
the most common:
 Pictographs: These characters are formed
according to the shape of the objects them-
selves, such as the sun and the moon.
 Ideographs: These characters represent more
abstract concepts. For example, the characters
for “above” and “below” each have a horizontal
line representing the horizon and another stroke
leading out away above or below the horizon.
 Complex ideographs: Combinations of simpler
characters, such as the sun and moon together
which mean “bright.”

Chapter 1: I Say It How? Speaking Chinese
7
 Phonetic compounds: Also called logographs,
these compound characters are formed by two
graphic elements — one hinting at the meaning
of the word and the other providing a clue to
the sound. Phonetic compounds account for
more than 80 percent of all Chinese characters.
No matter which type of character you see, you won’t
find any letters stringing them together like you see in
English. So how in the world do Chinese people con-
sult a Chinese dictionary? In several different ways.
Because Chinese characters are composed of several
(often many) strokes of the writing brush, one way to
look up a character is by counting the number of
strokes and then looking up the character under the
portion of the dictionary that notes characters by
strokes. But to do so, you have to know which radical
to check under first. Chinese characters have 214 
radicals — parts of the character that can help iden-
tify what the character may signify, such as three dots
on the left-hand side of the character representing
water. Each radical is itself composed of a certain
number of strokes, so you have to first look up the
radical by the number of strokes it takes to write it,
and after you locate that radical, you start looking
once more under the number of strokes left in the
character after that radical to locate the character
you wanted to look up in the first place.
You can always just check under the pronunciation of
the character (if you already know how to pronounce
it), but you have to sift through every single charac-
ter with the same pronunciation first, according to
which tone the word is spoken with — first, second,
third, or fourth. And because Chinese has so many
homophones, this task isn’t as easy as it may sound
(no pun intended). For example the word pronounced
“ma” if spoken with a first tone, means “mother,” with
a second tone it means “hemp,” with a third tone it
means “horse,” and with a fourth tone it means “to
scold.” So if you’re not careful you can scold your
mother and call her a horse.

I bet you feel really relieved that you’re only focusing
on spoken Chinese and not the written language
about now.
Pinyin Spelling: Beijing, 
Not Peking
To spell the way it sounds . . . that’s the literal mean-
ing of p∫ny∫n. For decades, Chinese had been translit-
erated in any number of ways. Finally, in 1979, the
People’s Republic of China officially adopted p∫ny∫n
as its official romanization system. After the adoption,
U.S. libraries and government agencies diligently
changed all their prior records from other romaniza-
tion systems into p∫ny∫n.
Keep in mind the following quick facts about some of
the initial sounds in Mandarin when you see them
written in the relatively new p∫ny∫n system:
 J: Sounds like the “g” in “gee whiz.” An “i” often
follows a “j.” “Jî kuài qián?” (jee kwye chyan)
means “How much money?”
 Q: Sounds like the “ch” in “cheek.” You never
see it followed by a “u” like in English, but an “i”
always follows it in p∫ny∫n, possibly before
another vowel or a consonant. Q∫ngdâo (cheeng
daow) beer used to be spelled “ch’ing tao” or
“Tsingtao.”
 X: The third letter that’s often followed by an
“i.” It sounds like the “sh” in “she.” One famous
Chinese leader, Dèng Xiâopíng (dung shyaow
peeng), boasted this letter in his name.
 Zh: Unlike “j,” which often precedes a vowel —
making it sound like you’re opening your 
mouth — “zh” is followed by vowels, which
make it sound like your mouth is a bit more
closed. Take Zh∂u √nlái (joe un lye), for exam-
ple, the great statesman of 20th-century China.
When you say his name, it sounds like Joe 
Un-lye.

Chapter 1: I Say It How? Speaking Chinese

 Z: Sounds like a “dz.” You see it in the name of
the PRC’s first leader, Máo Zéd∂ng (maow dzuh
doong), which used to be spelled Mao Tse-tung.
 C: Pronounced like “ts” in such words as cài
(tsye; food) or cèsuô (tsuh swaw; bathroom).
 B, D, and G: In the past, the sounds made by
these three letters were represented by P, T, and
K, respectively, and the corresponding aspirated
initial sounds (like in the words “pie,” “tie,” and
“kite”) were written as “p’,” “t’,” and “k.” Today,
the letters “P,” “T,” and “K” represent the aspi-
rated sounds.
Sounding Off: Basic 
Chinese Sounds
Don’t worry about sounding like a native speaker the
first time you utter a Chinese syllable — after all, who
does? But the longer you procrastinate becoming
familiar with the basic elements of Chinese words, the
greater your fear of this unique language may
become.
The main thing to remember about the
Chinese language is that each morpheme (the
smallest unit of meaning in a language) is
represented by one syllable, which in turn
consists of an initial sound and a final sound,
topped off by a tone. This applies to each
and every syllable. Without any one of these
three components, your words may be
incomprehensible to the average Chinese
person. For example, the syllable “m≈” is
comprised of the initial “m” and the final “a,”
and you pronounce it with what’s called a
first tone. Together, the parts mean “mother.”
If you substitute the first tone for a third
tone, which is written as “mâ,” you say the
word “horse.” The following sections break
up the three parts and give each their due.

Chinese boasts many more consonants than vowels. In
fact, the language has only six vowels all together: a, o,
e, i, u, and ü. If you pronounce the vowels in sequence,
your mouth starts off very wide and your tongue starts
off very low. Eventually, when you get to ü, your mouth
becomes much more closed and your tongue ends
pretty high. You can also combine the vowels in vari-
ous ways to form compound vowels. Table 1-2 lists the
vowels and some possible combinations.

Tone marks in p∫ny∫n always appear above
the vowel, but if you see a couple of vowels
in a row, the tone mark appears above the
first vowel in that sequence. One exception
is when you see the vowels iu and ui
together. In that case, the tone marks fall on
the second vowel.
Sometimes vowels appear without initial consonant
accompaniment, but they still mean something. The
word âi, meaning “short” (of stature), is one example.
Perfect pitch: Presenting . . . 
the four tones
Mandarin has only four tones. The best way to imag-
ine what each of the four tones sounds like is to visu-
alize these short descriptions:
 First tone: High level. The first tone is supposed
to be as high as your individual pitch range can
be, without wavering. It appears like this above
the letter a: ≈.
 Second tone: Rising. The second tone sounds
like you’re asking a question. It goes from the
middle level of your voice to the top. It doesn’t
automatically indicate that you’re asking a ques-
tion, however — it just sounds like you are. You
mark it like this: á.
 Third tone: Falling and then rising. The third
tone starts in the middle level of your voice

Chinese Phrases For Dummies 
14
range and then falls deeply before slightly rising
at the end. It looks like this if you were to see it
above the letter a: â
 Fourth tone: Falling. The fourth tone sounds
like you’re giving someone an order (unlike the
more plaintive-sounding second tone). It falls
from the high pitch level it starts at. Here’s how
it looks above the letter a: à.
Even though tones reduce the number of
homophones (words that are pronounced
alike even if they differ in spelling, meaning,
or origin), any given syllable with a specific
tone can have more than one meaning.
Sometimes the only way to decipher the
intended meaning is to see the written word.
One third tone after another
When you have to say a third tone followed by
another third tone out loud in consecutive fashion,
the first one actually becomes a second tone. If you
hear someone say “T≈hên hâo” (tah hun how; she’s
very well), you may not realize that both “hên” and
“hâo” individually are third tone syllables. It sounds
like “hén” is a second tone and “hâo” is a full third
tone.
Half-third tones
Whenever a third tone is followed by any of the other
tones — first, second, fourth, or even a neutral tone —
it becomes a half-third tone. You only pronounce the
first half of the tone — the falling half — before you
pronounce the other syllables with the other tones. In
fact, a half-third tone barely falls at all. It sounds more
like a level low tone (kind of the opposite of the high
level first tone). Get it?
Neutral tones
A fifth tone exists that you can’t exactly count among
the four basic tones, because it’s actually toneless, or
neutral. You never see a tone mark over a fifth tone,
and you only say it when you attach it to grammatical

Chapter 1: I Say It How? Speaking Chinese
15
particles or the second character of repetitive sylla-
bles, such as bàba (bah bah; father) or m≈ma (mah
mah; mother).
Tonal changes in y∫and bù
Just when you think you’re getting a handle on all the
possible tones and tone changes in Chinese, I have
one more aspect to report: The words y∫(ee; one) and
bù (boo; not or no) are truly unusual in Chinese, in
that their tones may change automatically depending
on what comes after them. You pronounce y∫by itself
with the first tone. However, when a first, second, or
third tone follows it, it instantly turns into a fourth
tone, such as in yìzh≈ng zhê (ee jahng jir; a piece of
paper). If a fourth tone follows y∫, however, it auto-
matically becomes a second tone, such as in the word
yíyàng (ee yahng; the same). I know this all sounds
very complicated, but when you get the hang of
tones, pronunciation becomes second nature. These
concepts will sink in quicker than you expect.
Adding Idioms and Popular
Expressions to Your Repertoire
The Chinese language has thousands of idiomatic
expressions known as chéngyû (chung yew). Most of
these chéngyû originated in anecdotes, fables, fairy
tales, or ancient literary works, and some of the
expressions are thousands of years old. The vast
majority consists of four characters, succinctly
expressing morals behind very long, ancient stories.
Others are more than four characters. Either way, the
Chinese pepper these pithy expressions throughout
any given conversation.
Here are a few chéngyû you frequently hear in
Chinese:
 Àn bù jiù b≈n. (ahn boo jyoe bahn; To take one
step at a time.)
 Huô shàng ji≈yóu. (hwaw shahng jyah yo; To
add fuel to the fire; to aggravate the problem.)

Chinese Phrases For Dummies 
16
 Hú shu∂b≈dào. (hoo shwaw bah daow; literally:
to talk nonsense in eight directions.) To talk
nonsense.
 Mò míng qí miào. (maw meeng chee meow; liter-
ally: No one can explain the wonder and mys-
tery of it all.) This saying describes anything
that’s tough to figure out, including unusual
behavior.
 Quán x∫n quán yì. (chwan sheen chwan ee; liter-
ally: entire heart, entire mind.) Wholeheartedly.
 Rù xi≈ng suí sú. (roo shyahng sway soo; When in
Rome, do as the Romans do.)
 Yì jh liûng dé. (ee jyew lyahng duh; To kill two
birds with one stone.)
 Yì mó yì yàng. (ee maw ee yahng; Exactly alike.)
 Yê sh√n zuò zé. (ee shun dzwaw dzuh; To set a
good example.)
 Yì zh√n jiàn xiê. (ee jun jyan shyeh; To hit the
nail on the head.)
Another fact you quickly become aware of when you
start speaking with chéngyû is that the expressions
are sometimes full of references to animals. Here are
some of those:
 gôu zhàng rén shì (go jahng run shir; literally:
the dog acts fierce when his master is present;
to take advantage of one’s connections with
powerful people)
 guà yáng tóu mài gôu ròu (gwah yahng toe my
go roe; literally: to display a lamb’s head but sell
dog meat; to cheat others with false claims)
 dâ câo j∫ng shé (dah tsaow jeeng shuh; literally:
to beat the grass to frighten the snake; to give a
warning)
 duì niú tán qín (dway nyo tahn cheen; literally:
to play music to a cow; to cast pearls before
swine)

Chapter 1: I Say It How? Speaking Chinese
17
 xuán yá lè mâ (shywan yah luh mah; literally: to
rein in the horse before it goes over the edge; to
halt)
 huà shé ti≈n zú (hwah shuh tyan dzoo; literally:
to paint a snake and add legs; to gild the lily; to
do something superfluous)
 hû tóu shé wêi (hoo toe shuh way; literally: with
the head of a tiger but the tail of a snake; to
start strong but end poorly)
 ch√shuî mâ lóng (chuh shway mah loong; liter-
ally: cars flowing like water and horses creating
a solid line looking like a dragon; heavy traffic)
Mastering Basic Phrases
If you make it a habit to use the following short
Chinese phrases whenever you get the chance, you
can master them in no time:
 Nî hâo! (nee how; Hi; How are you?)
 Xièxiè. (shyeh shyeh; Thank you.)
 Bú kèqì. (boo kuh chee; You’re welcome; Don’t
mention it.)
 Méi shì. (may shir; It’s nothing; Don’t mention it.)
 Hâo jíle. (how jee luh; Great; Fantastic.)
 Duì le. (dway luh; That’s right.)
 G∂ngxî g∂ngxî! (goong she goong she;
Congratulations!)
 Duìbuqî. (dway boo chee; Excuse me.)
 Suàn le. (swan luh; Forget it; Never mind.)
 Méiyôu gu≈nxi. (mayo gwan she; It doesn’t
matter.)
 Dêng yíxià. (dung ee shyah; Wait a minute.)

Communicating with body language
Ever think you know what certain couples are saying or
thinking just by observing their gestures and body language?
Well, people can make the same observations in China.
Although the gestures are different, they contain important
clues as to social status between people, their emotions, and
so on. Observe Chinese people wherever you can to see if
you notice any of the following gestures:
 Pointing to one’s own nose. You may find this hard to
believe, but Chinese people often point to their own
noses, often touching them, when they refer to them-
selves by saying the word “wô” (waw; I). The Chinese
are probably just as curious as to why Westerners point
to their hearts.
 Nodding and bowing slightly. When greeting older
people, professors, or others in positions of power or
prestige, people lower their heads slightly to acknowl-
edge them and show respect. Unlike the Japanese, who
bow deeply, the Chinese basically bow with their heads
in a slight fashion.
 Shaking hands. People of vastly different status gener-
ally don’t give each other a handshake, but it’s common
among friends and business colleagues.
 Bowing with hands clasped. If you see hand clasping
and bowing going on at the same time, you know the par-
ticipants have something to celebrate. It indicates con-
veying congratulations or greeting others during special
festival occasions. Their hands are held at chest level
and their heads are slightly bowed (and they often have
big smiles on their faces).

 Getting the hang of the parts of speech
 Discovering how to ask questions
You’re probably one of those people who cringe
at the mere mention of the word grammar. Just
the thought of all those rules on how to construct
sentences can put you into a cold sweat.
Hey, don’t sweat it! This chapter could just as easily
be called “Chinese without Tears.” It gives you some
quick and easy shortcuts on how to combine the
basic building blocks of Chinese (which, by the way,
are the same components that make up English).
How Chinese Is Easier 
Than English
The basic word order of Chinese is exactly the same
as in English. Just think of it this way: When you say 
“I love spinach,” you’re using the subject (I), verb
(love), object (spinach) sentence order. It’s the same
in Chinese. Only in Beijing, it sounds more like Wô
xîhu≈n b∂cài (waw she hwahn baw tsye).

Chinese Phrases For Dummies 
20
And if that weren’t enough to endear you to Chinese
already, maybe these tidbits of information will.
 You don’t need to conjugate verbs!
 You don’t need to master verb tenses. (Don’t
you just love it already?)
 You don’t need to distinguish between singular
and plural nouns.
 You don’t need to worry about gender-specific
nouns.
 You can use the same word for both the subject
and the object.
The way you can tell how one part of a Chinese sen-
tence relates to another is generally by the use of par-
ticles and what form the word order takes. (For those
of you presently scratching your heads, you can 
find particles at the beginning or end of sentences;
they serve mainly to distinguish different types of
emphatic statements but can’t be translated in and 
of themselves.)
Some interesting characteristics of the
Chinese language include 
 You don’t have to think about first, second, or
third person (for example, “I eat” versus “he
eats”).
 You don’t have to worry about active or passive
voices (for example, “hear” versus “be heard”).
 You don’t have to concern yourself with the past
or present (“I like him” versus “I liked him”).
In addition, Chinese language has only two aspects —
complete and continuous — whereas English has 
all sorts of different aspects: indefinite, continuous,
perfect, perfect continuous, and so on. (Examples
include ways of distinguishing between “I eat,” “I ate,”
“I will eat,” “I said I would eat,” “I am eating,” and so
on.) Aspects are what characterize the Chinese lan-
guage in place of tenses. Aspects refer to how a
speaker views an event or state of being.

Chapter 2: Grammar on a Diet: Just the Basics
21
Naming Those Nouns
Chinese is just chock-full of nouns:
 Common nouns that represent tangible things,
such as háizi (hi dzuh; child) or yè (yeh; leaf)
 Proper nouns for such items as names of coun-
tries or people, like Fâguó (fah gwaw; France)
and Zh≈ng Xi≈nsheng (jahng shyan shung;
Mr. Zhang)
 Material nouns for such nondiscrete things as
k≈f√i (kah fay; coffee) or j∫n (jin; gold)
 Abstract nouns for such items as zhèngzhì
(juhng jir; politics) or wénhuà (one hwah;
culture)
Pronouns
Pronouns are easy to make plural in Chinese. Here’s
what you need to know: Just add the plural suffix 
-men to the three basic pronouns:
 Wô (waw; I/me) becomes wômen (waw mun;
we/us).
 Nî (nee; you) becomes nîmen (nee mun; you
[plural]).
 T≈(tah; he/him, she/her, it) becomes t≈men
(tah mun; they/them).
Sometimes instead of using the term wômen
for “us,” you’ll hear the term zánmen
instead. This word is used in very familiar
settings when the speaker is trying to
include the listener in an action, like when
you say Zánmen zôu ba (dzah mun dzoe bah;
let’s go).
When speaking to an elder or someone you
don’t know too well and the person is some-
one to whom you should show respect, you

Chinese Phrases For Dummies 
22
need to use the pronoun nín (neen) instead
of the more informal nî (nee). On the other
hand, if you’re speaking to several people
who fit that description, the plural remains
nîmen (nee mun).
Classifiers
Classifiers, sometimes called measure words, help
classify particular nouns. For example, the classifier
bên (bun) can refer to books, magazines, dictionaries,
and just about anything else that’s printed and bound
like a book. You may hear Wô yào yìbên sh∆(waw
yaow ee bun shoo; I want a book.) just as easily as
you’ll hear Wô yào kàn yìbên zázhì (waw yaow kahn
ee bun dzah jir; I want to read a magazine.).
Classifiers are found in between a number (or a
demonstrative pronoun such as “this” or “that”) and 
a noun. They’re similar to the English words such as
“herd” (of elephants) or “school” (of fish).
Because you have so many potential classi-
fiers to choose from in Chinese, the general
rule is: When in doubt, use ge (guh). It’s the
all-purpose classifier and the one used the
most in the Chinese language. Just don’t give
into the temptation to leave a classifier out
altogether because no one may understand
you at all. 
Table 2-1 lists classifiers for natural objects, but first
here are some other examples:
 g√n (gun): Used for anything looking like a stick,
such as a string or even a blade of grass
 k√(kuh): Used for anything round and tiny, such
as a pearl
 zh≈ng (jahng): Used for anything with a flat sur-
face, such as a newspaper, table, or bed

kuh

lì
lee
grain (of rice, sand, and so on)
zh∫
jir
animals, insects, birds
zuò
dzwaw

Whenever you have a pair of anything, you
can use the classifier shu≈ng (shwahng).
That goes for yì shu≈ng kuàizi (ee shwahng
kwye dzuh; a pair of chopsticks) as well as
for yì shu≈ng shôu (ee shwahng show; a pair
of hands). Sometimes a pair is indicated by
the classifier duì (dway), as in yí duì êrhuán
(ee dway are hwahn; a pair of earrings).
Singular and plural: It’s not an issue
Regular nouns in Chinese make no distinction
between singular and plural. Whether you want to
talk about one píngguô (peeng gwaw; apple), two júzi
(jyew dzuh; oranges), or both píngguô hé júzi (peeng
gwaw huh jyew dzuh; apples and oranges), the fruits
always sound the same in Chinese. On the other
hand, if you want to refer to human beings, you can
always add the suffix men (mun). The word for “I” or
“me” is wô (waw), but “we” becomes wômen (waw
mun). The same goes for nî (nee; you) and t≈(tah; he,
she, and it). “They” becomes nîmen (nee mun) or
t≈men (tah mun). If you want to refer to a specific
number of apples, however, you don’t use “men” as a
suffix. You can either say píngguô (peeng gwaw) for
apple (or apples) or liângge píngguô (lyahng guh
peeng gwaw), meaning two apples. Got it?

Chinese Phrases For Dummies 
24
Never attach the suffix -men to anything not
human. People will think you’re nuts if you
start referring to your two pet cats as wôde
xiâo m≈omen (waw duh shyaow maow mun).
Just say Wôde xiâo m≈o hên hâo, xièxiè,
(waw duh shyaow maow hun how, shyeh
shyeh; My cats are fine, thank you), and that
should do the trick.
Those Little Words: Definite
Versus Indefinite Articles
If you’re looking for those little words “a,” “an,” and
“the” in Chinese, they simply don’t exist. The only
way you can tell whether something is being referred
to specifically (hence, considered definite) or just
generally (and therefore it’s indefinite) is by the word
order. Nouns that refer specifically to something are
usually found at the beginning of the sentence, before
the verb.
 Sh∆zài nàr. (shoo dzye nar; The book[s] are
there.)
 Háizimen xîhu≈n t≈. (hi dzuh mun she hwahn
tah; The children like her.)
 Pánzi zài zhu∂zishàng. (pahn dzuh dzye jwaw
dzuh shahng; There’s a plate on the table.)
You can often find those articles that refer to some-
thing more general (and are therefore “indefinite”) at
the end of the sentence, after the verb.
 Nâr yôu hu≈? (nar yo hwah; Where are there
some flowers? Or, Where is there a flower?)
 Nàr yôu hu≈. (nar yo hwah; There are some
flowers over there. Or, There’s a flower over
there.)
 Zhèige yôu wèntí. (jay guh yo one tee; There’s a
problem with this. Or, There are some problems
with this.)

Chapter 2: Grammar on a Diet: Just the Basics
25
These rules do have a few exceptions: If you
find a noun at the beginning of a sentence, it
may refer to something indefinite if the sen-
tence makes a general comment (instead of
telling a whole story), like when you see the
verb shì (shir; to be) as part of the comment:
Xióngm≈o shì dòngwù. (shyoong maow shir
doong woo; Pandas are animals.)
You use the same rule if an adjective comes after the
noun, such as
Pútáo hên tián. (poo taow hun tyan; Grapes are
very sweet.)
Or if there’s an auxiliary verb:
Xiâo m≈o huì zhu≈lâoshû. (shyaow maow hway
jwah laow shoo; Kittens can catch mice.)
Or a verb indicating that the action occurs habitually:
Niú ch∫câo. (nyo chir tsaow; Cows eat grass.)
Nouns that are preceded by a numeral and a classi-
fier, especially when the word d∂u (doe; all) exists in
the same breath, are also considered to be definite:
Sìge xuésh√ng d∂u hên c∂ngmíng. (suh guh
shweh shung doe hun tsoong meeng; The four stu-
dents are all very smart.)
If the word yôu (yo; to exist) comes before the noun
and is then followed by a verb, the reference may be
indefinite:
Yôu sh∆zài zhu∂zishàng. (yo shoo dzye jwaw
dzuh shahng; There are books on top of the table.)
If you see the word zhè (juh; this) or nà (nah; that)
plus a classifier used when a noun comes after the
verb, it indicates a definite reference:
Wô yào mâi nà zh≈ng huà. (waw yaow my nah
jahng hwah; I want to buy that painting.)

Chinese Phrases For Dummies 
26
Describing Adjectives
Adjectives describe nouns — the question is where to
put them. The general rule in Chinese is, if the adjec-
tive is pronounced with only one syllable, it appears
immediately in front of the noun it qualifies. The fol-
lowing are a couple examples:
 lh chá (lyew chah; green tea)
 cháng zh∫tiáo (chahng jir tyaow; long stick)
If the adjective has two syllables, though, the posses-
sive particle de (duh) comes between it and whatever
it’s qualifying:
 g≈njìng de y∫fu (gahn jeeng duh ee foo; clean
clothes)
 c≈ozá de wânhuì (tsaow dzah duh wahn hway;
noisy party)
And if a numeral is followed by a classifier, they 
both need to go in front of the adjective and what it’s
qualifying:
 yí jiàn x∫n y∫fu (ee jyan shin ee foo; a [piece of]
new clothing)
 s≈n bên yôuyìsi de sh∆(sahn bun yo ee suh duh
shoo; three interesting books)
One unique thing about Chinese is that when
an adjective is also the predicate, appearing
at the end of a sentence, it follows the sub-
ject or the topic without needing the verb shì
(shir; to be):
 T≈de fángzi hên g≈njìng. (tah duh fahng dzuh
hun gahn jeeng; His house [is] very clean.)
 Nà jiàn y∫fu tài jiù. (nah jyan ee foo tye jyoe;
That piece of clothing [is] too old.)

Verbs

someone say T≈men ch∫Yìdàlì fàn (tah men chir ee

just as easily as it could mean “They are eating Italian
food.” Table 2-2 lists some common verbs.

Feeling tense? Le, guò, and 
other aspect markers
Okay, you can relax now. No need to get tense with
Chinese because verbs don’t indicate tenses all by
themselves. That’s the job of aspect markers. Those
are little syllables that indicate whether an action has
been completed, is continuing, has just begun, and
just about everything in between.

Chinese Phrases For Dummies 
28
Take the syllable le (luh), for example. It can indicate
an action has been completed if it’s used as a suffix to
a verb:
 Nî mâi le hên du∂sh∆. (nee my luh hun dwaw
shoo; You bought many books.)
 T≈dài le t≈de yûsân. (tah dye luh tah duh yew
sahn; He brought his umbrella.)
And if you want to turn it into a question, just add
méiyôu (mayo) at the end. It automatically negates
the action completed by le.
 Nî mâi le hên du∂sh∆méiyôu? (nee my luh hun
dwaw shoo mayo; Have you bought many
books? Or, Did you buy many books?)
 T≈dài le t≈de yûsân méiyôu? (tah dye luh tah
duh yew sahn mayo; Did he bring his umbrella?)
Then there’s guò (gwaw). It basically means that
something has been done at one point or another
even though it’s not happening right now:
 T≈qù guò Mêiguó. (ta chyew gwaw may gwaw;
He has been to America.)
 Wômen ch∫guò Fâguó cài. (waw mun chir gwaw
fah gwaw tsye; We have eaten French food
before.)
If an action is happening just as you speak, you use
the aspect marker zài (dzye):
 Wômen zài ch∫fàn. (waw mun dzye chir fahn; We
are eating.)
 Nî m≈ma zài zuòfàn. (nee mah mah dzye dzwaw
fahn; Your mother is cooking.)
If something is or was happening continually and
resulted from something else you did, just add the
syllable zhe (juh) to the end of the verb and you can
say things like

Chapter 2: Grammar on a Diet: Just the Basics
29
 T≈dài zhe yíge huáng màozi. (tah dye juh 
ee guh hwahng maow dzuh; He’s wearing a

 Nî chu≈n zhe yí jiàn piàoliàng de chènsh≈n.
(nee chwan juh ee jyan pyaow lyahng duh ee foo;
You’re wearing a pretty shirt.)
Another way you can use zhe is when you want to
indicate two actions occurring at the same time:
T≈zuò zhe ch∫fàn. (tah dzwaw juh chir fahn; She
is/was sitting there eating.)

The coverb bâ often appears right after the subject of
the sentence, separating it from the direct object,
which is always something concrete rather than an
abstract idea. It separates the indirect and direct
objects.
Instead of having the following sentence pattern:
Subject + Verb + Complement (+ Indirect Object) +
Object
You have:
Subject + bâ + Object + Verb + Complement 
(+ Indirect Object)
Here are some examples:
 Wô bâ sh∆jiè gêi nî. (waw bah shoo jyeh gay
nee; I’ll loan you the book.)
 Qîng nî bâ bênzi ná gêi lâosh∫. (cheeng nee bah
bun dzuh nah gay laow shir; Please give the note-
book to the teacher.)
You use the coverb bâ (bah) when you want
to put the object right up front before you
state the verb that tells what you did or will
do with the object.

To be or not to be: The verb shì
Be careful not to put the verb shì (shir) in
front of an adjective unless you really mean
to make an emphatic statement. In the
course of normal conversation, you might
say Nà zh∫bî tài guì (nah jir bee tye gway;
That pen [is] too expensive). You wouldn’t
say Nà zh∫bî shì tài guì (nah jir bee shir tye
gway) unless you really meant to say “That
pen IS too expensive!” in which case you’d
emphasize the word shì when saying it, too.
To negate the verb shì, put the negative prefix bù in
front of it. “Shì bú shì?” (shir boo shir; Is it or isn’t it?)
and “Zhè bú shì táng cù yú” (jay boo shir tahng tsoo
yew; This isn’t sweet and sour fish.) are two examples.
The special verb: Yôu (to have)
Do you yôu (yo) a computer? No?! Too bad. Everyone
else seems to have one these days. How about a
Ferrari? Do you yôu one of those? If not, welcome to
the club. People who have lots of things use the word
yôu pretty often. It means “to have.”
 Wô yôu yí wàn kuài qián. (waw yo ee wahn
kwye chyan; I have $10,000.)
 Wô yôu s≈nge fángzi — yíge zài ∂uzh∂u, yíge
zài Yàzh∂u, yíge zài Mêiguó. (waw yo sahn guh
fahng dzuh — ee guh dzye oh joe, ee guh dzye
yah joe, ee guh dzye may gwaw; I have three
homes — one in Europe, one in Asia, and one in
America.)
Another way yôu can be translated is “there is” or
“there are”:
 Yôu hên du∂háizi. (yo hun dwaw hi dzuh;
There are many children.) As opposed to: Wô
yôu hên du∂háizi. (waw yo hun dwaw hi dzuh; I
have many children.)
 Sh∆zhu∂shàng yôu wû zh≈ng zhî. (shoo jwaw
shahng yo woo jahng jir; There are five pieces of
paper on the desk.)

Chapter 2: Grammar on a Diet: Just the Basics
31
To negate the verb yôu, you can’t use the
usual negative prefix bù. Instead, you must
use another term indicating negation, méi:
 Méiyôu hên du∂háizi. (mayo hun dwaw hi
dzuh; There aren’t many children.)
 Sh∆zhu∂shàng méiyôu wû zh≈ng zhî. (shoe
jwaw shahng may yo woo jahng jir; There aren’t
five pieces of paper on the desk.)
Asking for what you want: 
The verb yào
Yào (yaow) is one of the coolest verbs in Chinese.
When you say it, you usually get what you want. In
fact, the mere mention of the word yào means that
you want something.
 Wô yào yì b√i k≈f√i. (waw yaow ee bay kah fay;
I want a cup of coffee.)
 Wô yào g√n nî yìqî qù kàn diànyîng. (waw
yaow gun nee ee chee chyew kahn dyan yeeng;
I want to go to the movies with you.)
You can also give someone an order with the verb
yào, but only if you use it with a second-person 
pronoun:
 Nî yào xiâox∫n! (nee yaow shyaow sheen; You
should be careful!)
 Nî yào xî shôu. (nee yaow she show; You need to
wash your hands.)
Advocating Adverbs
Adverbs serve to modify verbs or adjectives and
always appear in front of them. The most common
ones you’ll find in Chinese are hên (hun; very) and yê
(yeah; also).

Chinese Phrases For Dummies 
32
If you want to say that something isn’t just hâo (how;
good), but that it’s very good, you say it’s hên hâo
(hun how; very good). If your friend wants to then put
his two cents in and say that something else is also
really good, he’d say “Zhèige yê hên hâo” (Jay guh
yeah hun how; This is also very good.) because yê
always comes before hên.
The adverb yê always comes not only before
the adverb hên but also before the negative
prefix bù.
Bù and Méiyôu: Total Negation
Boo! Did I scare you? Don’t worry. I’m just being 
negative in Chinese. That’s right, the word bù is pro-
nounced the same way a ghost might say it (boo) and
is often spoken with the same intensity. 
Bù can negate something you’ve done in the past or
the present (or at least indicate you don’t generally
do it these days), and it can also help negate some-
thing in the future:
 T≈xiâo de shíhòu bù xîhu≈n ch∫sh∆cài. (tah
shyaow duh shir ho boo she hwahn chir shoo
tsye; When he was young, he didn’t like to eat
vegetables.)
 Wô búyào chàng g√. (waw boo yaow chahng
guh; I don’t want to sing.)
 Wô bú huà huàr. (waw boo hwah hwar; I don’t
paint.)
 Diànyîngyuàn x∫ngq∫liù bù k≈imén. (dyan
yeeng ywan sheeng chee lyo boo kye mun; The
movie theater isn’t open on Saturday.)
The negative prefix bù is usually spoken with
a fourth (falling) tone. However, when it pre-
cedes a syllable with another fourth tone, it
becomes a second (rising) tone instead, as in
such word as búqù (boo chyew; won’t/didn’t/

Chapter 2: Grammar on a Diet: Just the Basics
33
doesn’t go) or búyào (boo yaow; don’t/
didn’t/won’t want). (For more about tones,
see Chapter 1.)
Remember that when Chinese people speak quickly,
they may leave out the second syllable in a few bisyl-
labic verbs and even a few auxiliary verbs like in the
“verb-bù-verb” pattern. So, instead of saying “T≈
xîhu≈n bùxîhu≈n h√jiû?” (tah she hwan boo she
hwan huh jyo; Does he or she like to drink wine?), you
may hear someone say “T≈xî bùxîhu≈n h√jiû?” (tah
she boo she hwan huh jyoe.).
Méiyôu is another negative prefix that also goes
before a verb. It refers only to the past, though, and
means either something didn’t happen or at least
didn’t happen on a particular occasion.
 Wô méiyôu kàn nèi bù diànyîng. (waw mayo
kahn nay boo dyan yeeng; I didn’t see that
movie.)
 Zuóti≈n méiyôu xiàyû. (dzwaw tyan mayo shyah
yew; It didn’t rain yesterday.)
If the aspect marker guò is at the end of the verb
méiyôu, it means it never happened (up until now) in
the past. By the way, you’ll sometimes find that
méiyôu is shortened just to méi:
 Wô méi qù guò Fâguó. (waw may chyew gwaw
fah gwaw; I’ve never been to France.)
 Wô méi ch∫guò Yìndù cài. (wo may chir gwaw
een doo tsye; I’ve never eaten Indian food.)
Getting Possessive 
with the Particle De
The particle de is ubiquitous in Chinese. Wherever
you turn, there it is. Wôde ti≈n! (waw duh tyan; My
goodness!) Using it is easy. All you have to do is

Chinese Phrases For Dummies 
34
attach it to the end of the pronoun, such as nîde ch√
(nee duh chuh; your car) or other modifier, such as 
t≈g∂ngs∫de j∫nglî (tah goong suh duh jeeng lee; his
company’s manager), and — voilà — it indicates 
possession.
Nîde diànnâo yôu méiyôu y∫ntèwâng? (nee duh
dyan now yo mayo een tuh wahng; Does your
computer have Internet?)
Kêx∫méiyôu. Nîde ne? (kuh she mayo. nee duh
nuh; Unfortunately not. How about yours?)
The particle de acts as an apostrophe “s” (’s)
in English when it’s not attached to a pro-
noun. It also makes the process of modifica-
tion exactly the opposite of the French
possessive “de” or the English “of,” with
which you may be tempted to compare it.
Asking Questions
You can ask questions in Chinese in a couple easy
ways. You may be so curious about the world around
you that you ask tons of questions after you know how.
The question particle “ma”
By far the easiest way to ask a question is simply to
end any given statement with a ma. That automati-
cally makes it into a question. For example, T≈ch∫fàn
(tah chir fahn; He’s eating/he eats.) becomes T≈
ch∫fàn ma? (tah chir fahn mah; Is he/does he eat?). Nî
shu∂Zh∂ngwén (nee shwaw joong one; You speak
Chinese.) becomes Nî shu∂Zh∂ngwén ma? (nee
shwaw joong one mah; Do you speak Chinese?).
Using bù to ask a question
The second way you can ask a question is just to
repeat the verb in its negative form. The English
equivalent would be to say something like “Do you

Chapter 2: Grammar on a Diet: Just the Basics
35
eat, not eat?” for example. You can use this format
only for a yes or no question, though. For example:
 Nî shì búshì Zh∂ngguórén? (nee shir boo shir
joong gwaw run; Are you Chinese?)
 T≈yào búyào háizi? (tah yaow boo yaow hi
dzuh; Does he want children?)
 T≈men xîhu≈n bùxîhu≈n ch∫Zh∂ngguó cài?
(tah mun she hwahn boo she hwahn chir joong
gwaw tsye; Do they like to eat Chinese food?)
Interrogative pronouns
The last way of asking questions in Chinese is to use
interrogative pronouns. The following are pronouns
that act as questions in Chinese:
 nâ (nah + classifier; which)
 nâr (nar; where)
 shéi (shay; who/whom)
 shéi de (shay duh; whose)
 shénme (shummuh; what)
 shénme dìf≈ng (shummuh dee fahng; where)
Don’t confuse nâ with nâr. That one extra
letter makes the difference between saying
“which” (nâ) and “where” (nâr).
Figuring out where such interrogative pronouns
should go in any given sentence is easy. Just put them
wherever the answer would be found. For example:
 Question: Nî shì shéi? (nee shir shay; Who 
are you?)
 Answer: Nî shì wô péngyôu. (nee shir waw
puhng yo; You are my friend.)
 Question: T≈de nhpéngyôu zài nâr? (tah duh
nyew puhng yo dzye nar; Where is his girlfriend?)
 Answer: T≈de nhpéngyôu zài ji≈lî. (tah duh
nyuew puhng yo dzye jyah lee; His girlfriend is at
home.)

Chinese Phrases For Dummies 
36
This rule also goes for the verb-bù-verb pattern. All
you have to do to answer that type of question is omit
either the positive verb or the negative prefix and
verb following it:
Question: Nî hâo bù hâo? (nee how boo how;
How are you? Literally: Are you good or not
good?)
Answer: Wô hâo. (waw how; I’m okay.). Or 
Wô bùhâo. (waw boo how; I’m not okay.).

If the number “two” comes before a classifier
(see Chapter 2), use the word liâng instead
of èr. So you would say that you have liâng
bên sh∆(lyahng bun shoo; two books)
instead of èr bên sh∆(are bun shoo).

When you get to 20, you have to literally think “two
tens” — plus whatever single digit you want to add 
to that up until nine for 21 through 29, as shown in

The same basic idea goes for s≈nshí (sahn shir; thirty;
literally: three tens), sìshí (suh shir; forty), wûshí (woo
shir; fifty), liùshí (lyo shir; sixty), q∫shí (chee shir; sev-
enty), b≈shí (bah shir; eighty) and jiûshí (jyoe shir;
ninety). What could be easier?
After the number 99, you can no longer count by tens.
 100 is yì bâi (ee bye).
 1,000 is yì qi≈n (ee chyan).
 10,000 is yí wàn (ee wahn; literally: one unit of
ten thousand).
 100,000 is shí wàn (shir wahn; literally: ten units
of ten thousand).

Chinese Phrases For Dummies 
40
 1,000,000 is yì bâi wàn (ee bye wahn; literally:
one hundred units of 10,000).
 100,000,000 is yí yì (ee ee; one hundred million).
Chinese people count all the way up to wàn (wahn;
ten thousand) and then repeat up to yì (ee; a hundred
million), unlike in English, where counting goes up 
to a thousand before being repeated all the way to a
million.
Numbers are represented with the higher
units of value first. So the number 387 is s≈n
bâi b≈shí q∫(sahn bye bah shir chee). The
number 15,492 is yí wàn wû qi≈n sì bâi jiû shí
èr (ee wahn woo chyan suh bye jyoe shir are).
The number 1 (y∫) changes its tone from its
first (high) to the fourth (falling) tone when
followed by a first (high) tone as in yì qi≈n
(ee chyan; 1,000), by a second (rising) tone
as in yì nián (ee nyan; one year), and by a
third (low dipping) tone as in yì bâi (ee bye;
100). (See Chapter 1 for a review of the four
tones.) And it changes to the second (rising)
tone when followed by a fourth (falling) tone
as in yí wàn (ee wahn; 10,000). It remains its
original first tone mark only when people
count numbers: one, two, three, and so on.
If you want to add a half to anything, the word for half
is bàn (bahn), and it can either come at the beginning,
such as in bàn b√i kêlè (bahn bay kuh luh; a half a glass
of cola), or after a number and classifier but before
the object, to mean “and a half,” such as in yí ge bàn
x∫ngq∫(ee guh bahn sheeng chee; a week and a half).
Discovering Ordinal Numbers
Ever tell someone to make a right at the second
ji≈ot∂ng d√ng (jyaow toong dung; traffic light) or that
your house is the third one on the left? Creating ordi-
nal numbers in Chinese is quite easy. Just put dì in
front of the numeral:

Chapter 3: Numerical Gumbo: Counting of All Kinds
41
 dì y∫(dee ee; first)
 dì èr (dee are; second)
 dì s≈n (dee sahn; third)
 dì sì (dee suh; fourth)
 dì wû (dee woo; fifth)
 dì liù (dee lyoe; sixth)
 dì q∫(dee chee; seventh)
 dì b≈(dee bah; eighth)
 dì jiû (dee jyoe; ninth)
 dì shí (dee shir; tenth)
You may need to use these examples to give directions:
 dì y∫tiáo lù (dee ee tyaow loo; the first street)
 dì èr ge fángzi (dee are guh fahng dzuh; the
second house)
 zuô bi≈n dì b≈ge fángzi (dzwaw byan dee bah
guh fahng dzuh; the eighth house on the left)
If a noun follows the ordinal number, a classi-
fier needs to go in between them, such as dì
b≈ge xuésh√ng (dee bah guh shweh shuhng;
the eighth student) or dì y∫ge háizi (dee ee
guy hi dzuh; the first child).
Telling Time
All you have to do to find out the shíji≈n (shir jyan;
time) is take a peek at your shôubiâo (show byaow;
watch) or look at the zh∂ng (joong; clock) on the wall. 
You can indicate the hour by saying 3-diân
or 3-diân zh∂ng. Diân (dyan) means “hour,”
but it’s also a classifier, and zh∂ng (joong)
means “clock.” Feel free to use either to say
what time it is. (Check out Table 3-3.)

When mentioning 12 o’clock, be careful! The
way to say noon is simply zh∂ngwû (joong
woo), and the way to say midnight is bànyè
(bahn yeh).
The Chinese are very precise when they tell time. You
can’t just say 3-diân zh∂ng (sahn dyan joong) when
you want to say 3 o’clock; you need to add what part
of the day or night you mean:
 q∫ngzâo (cheeng dzaow; midnight to dawn)
 zâoshàng (dzaow shahng; 6 a.m. to noon)
 xiàwû (shyah woo; noon to 6 p.m.)
 wânshàng (wahn shahng; 6 p.m. to midnight)
The segment of the day comes before the actual time
itself in Chinese:

Chapter 3: Numerical Gumbo: Counting of All Kinds
43
 wânshàng q∫diân zh∂ng (wahn shahng chee
dyan joong; 7 p.m.)
 xiàwû s≈n diân bàn (shyah woo sahn dyan bahn;

 q∫ngzâo yì diân yí kè (cheeng dzaow ee dyan ee
kuh; 1:15 a.m.)
 zâoshàng b≈diân èrshíwû f√n (dzaow shahng
bah dyan are shir woo fun; 8:25 a.m.)
If you want to indicate half an hour, just add bàn
(bahn; half) after the hour:
 3-diân bàn (sahn dyan bahn; 3:30)
 4-diân bàn (suh dyan bahn; 4:30)
 11-diân bàn (shir ee dyan bahn; 11:30)
Do you want to indicate a quarter of an hour or three
quarters of an hour? Just use the phrases yí kè (ee
kuh) and s≈n kè (sahn kuh) after the hour:
 2-diân yí kè (lyahng dyan ee kuh; 2:15)
 4-diân yí kè (suh dyan ee kuh; 4:15)
 5-diân s≈n kè (woo dyan sahn kuh; 5:45)
 7-diân s≈n kè (chee dyan sahn kuh; 7:45)
Here are some other examples of alternative ways to
indicate the time:
 chà shí f√n wû diân (chah shir fun woo dyan;
10 to 5)
 wû diân chà shí f√n (woo dyan chah shir fun;
10 to 5)
 sì diân wûshí f√n (suh dyan woo shir fun; 4:50)
 chà yí kè q∫diân (chah ee kuh chee dyan;
a quarter to 7)
 q∫diân chà yí kè (chee dyan chah ee kuh;
a quarter to 7)
 liù diân s≈n kè (lyo dyan sahn kuh; 6:45)
 liù diân sìshíwû f√n (lyo dyan suh shir woo fun;
6:45)

When talking about time, you may prefer to say
before or after a certain hour. To do so, you use either
yîqián (ee chyan; before) or yîhòu (ee ho; after). Here

 xiàwû 3-diân zh∂ng yîqián (shyah woo sahn

Using the Calendar and Dates
To ask what today’s date is, you simply say J∫nti≈n
jîyuè jîhào? (jin tyan jee yweh jee how; literally: Today

When answering, remember that the larger unit of the
month always comes before the smaller unit of the
date in Chinese:
 Y∫yuè èr hào (ee yweh are how; January 2nd)
 S≈nyuè sì hào (sahn yweh suh how; March 4th)
 Shí’èryuè s≈nshí hào (shir are yweh sahn shir

Even though you say each month by adding
the number of the month in front of the word
yuè (which means “month”), if you add the
classifier ge (guh) in between the number
and the word yuè, you say “one month,”
“two months,” and so on. For example, b≈
yuè (bah yweh) means August (which is the
8th month), but b≈ge yuè (bah guh yweh)
means eight months.
You can’t check out the months of the year without
first looking at the holidays. First you celebrate

always occurs sometime in January or February.

sents a different personality type.

In mainland China, Láodòng jié (laow doong jyeh;
Labor Day) is celebrated on wû yuè y∫hào (woo yweh
ee how; May 1st), and Guó qìng jié (gwaw cheeng
jyeh; National Day) is celebrated on shí yuè y∫hào
(shir yweh ee how; October 1st) in commemoration of
the day Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist
Party declared the founding of the Zh∂nghuá rénmín
gònghé guó (joong hwah run meen goong huh gwaw;
the People’s Republic of China) in 1949. In Taiwan,
Guó qìng jié is celebrated on shí yuè shí hào (shir
yweh shir how; October 10th) to commemorate the
day in 1911 when China’s long dynastic history ended
and a new era of the Zh∂nghuá mín guó (joong hwah
meen gwaw; the Republic of China) began, under the
leadership of Dr. Sun Yat-sen.
In Taiwan, you often see years written out
that seem to be 11 years short of what you
think is correct. That’s because the founding
of the Republic of China in 1911 is consid-
ered the base line for all future years. So 1921
is listed as mín guó shí nián (meen gwaw
shir nyan; “meen gwaw” is the abbreviation
for Zh∂nghuá mín guó [joong hwah meen
gwaw], or the Republic of China, and “shir
nyan,” meaning 10 years, refers to 10 years
following the founding of the Republic of
China). The year 2005 is noted as mín guó
jiûshí sì nián (meen gwaw jyo shir suh nyan;
94 years after the establishment of the
Republic of China).

Money, Money, Money
Qián (chyan; money) makes the world go around. In
this section, pick up important words and phrases for
acquiring and spending money.
The basic elements of all Chinese currency
are the yuán (colloquially referred to as a
kuài), which you can think of as a dollar, the
jiâo (colloquially referred to as the máo),
which is the equivalent of a dime, and the
f√n (fun), which is equivalent to the penny.

Chapter 3: Numerical Gumbo: Counting of All Kinds

Want to know how much money I have right now in
my pocket, Nosy? Why not just ask me?
 Nî yôu jî kuài qián? (nee yo jee kwye chyan;
How much money do you have?)
Use this phrase if you assume the amount is less
than $10.
 Nî yôu du∂shâo qián? (nee yo dwaw shaow
chyan; How much money do you have?)
Use this phrase if you assume the amount is
greater than $10.
Making and exchanging money
You can always huàn qián (hwahn chyan; exchange
money) the minute you arrive at the f√ij∫châng (fay
jee chahng; airport) at the many duìhuànchù (dway
hwahn choo; exchange bureaus), or you can wait until
you get to a major yínháng (een hahng; bank) or
check in at your lhguân (lyew gwahn; hotel).
The following phrases come in handy when you’re
ready to huàn qián:
 Qîng wèn, zài nâr kêyî huàn qián? (cheeng one,
dzye nar kuh yee hwahn chyan; Excuse me,
where can I change money?)
 Qîng wèn, yíngháng zài nâr? (cheeng one, eeng

 J∫nti≈n de duìhuàn lf shì shénme? (jin tyan

 Qîng nî gêi wô sì zh≈ng wûshí yuán de.
(cheeng nee gay waw suh jahng woo shir ywan

 Wô yào huàn yì bâi mêiyuán. (waw yaow hwahn

 Nîmen sh∂u du∂shâo qián shôuxùfèi? (nee mun

Cashing checks and 
checking your cash
When you talk about how much something costs, you
put the numerical value before the word for bill or
coin. For example, you can call a dollar yí kuài (ee
kwye; one dollar) or s≈n kuài (sahn kwye; three 
dollars). You translate 10 cents, literally, as one 
10-cent coin — yì máo (ee maow) — or 30 cents as,
literally, three 10-cent coins — s≈n máo (sahn maow).
Here’s how you speak of increasing amounts of
money. You mention the larger units before the
smaller units, just like in English:
 s≈n kuài (sahn kwye; $3)
 s≈n kuài yì máo (sahn kwye ee maow; $3.10)
 s≈n kuài yì máo wû (sahn kwye ee maow woo;
$3.15)
 Qîng wèn, zhè jiàn y∫fu du∂shâo qián? (Cheeng
one, jay jyan ee foo dwaw shaow chyan; Excuse
me, how much is this piece of clothing?)
 Nîmen sh∂u bù sh∂u zh∫piào? (nee mun show

 Nîmen sh∂u bù sh∂u xìnyòng kâ? (nee mun

Doing your banking
If you plan on staying in Asia for an extended time or
you want to continue doing business with a Chinese
company, you may want to open a huóq∫zhànghù
(hwaw chee jahng hoo; checking account) where you
can both cún qián (tswun chyan; deposit money) and
qû qián (chyew chyan; withdraw money). If you stay
long enough, consider opening a dìngq∫cúnkuân
hùtóu (deeng chee tswun kwan hoo toe; savings
account) so you can start earning some lìxi (lee she;
interest). Earning interest sure beats stuffing dà
piàozi (dah pyaow dzuh; large bills) under your
chuáng diàn (chwahng dyan; mattress) for years.
How about trying to make your money work for you
by investing in one of the following:
 chûxù cúnkuân (chew shyew tswun kwan;
Certificate of Deposit; CD)
 guókù quàn (gwaw koo chwan; treasury bond)

 tàotóu j∫j∫n (taow toe jee jeen; hedge fund)
 zhàiquàn (jye chwan; bond)
If you plan to cash some checks along with your
deposits, here are a couple useful phrases to know:
 Wô yào duìxiàn zhèi zh≈ng zh∫piào. (waw
yaow dway shyan jay jahng jir pyaow; I’d like to

Accessing an ATM machine
Zìdòng tíkuânj∫(dzuh doong tee kwan jee; ATM
machines) are truly ubiquitous these days. In order to
use one, you need a zìdòng tíkuân kâ (dzuh doong tee
kwan kah; ATM card) to find out your jiéyú (jyeh yew;
account balance), to cún qián (tswun chyan; deposit
money), or to qû qián (chyew chyan; withdraw
money). And you definitely need to know your mìmâ
(mee mah; PIN number); otherwise, the zìdòng
tíkuânj∫is useless.
And one more thing: Make sure you don’t let anyone
else know your mìmâ. It’s your mìmì (mee mee;
secret).

Making New Friends and
Enjoying Small Talk
In This Chapter
 Introducing yourself and others
 Using question words
 Greeting and chatting with family, friends, and 
colleagues
N
î hâo! (nee how; Hello!; How are you?) These
two words are probably the most important
you need to know to start a conversation.
In this chapter, I show you how to greet people, intro-
duce yourself, and make small talk.
Making Introductions
Nothing beats making new friends at a wânhuì (wahn
hway; party), a x∫n g∂ngzuò (sheen goong dzwaw;
new job), on the dìtiê (dee tyeh; subway), or just 
zài lùshàng (dzye loo shahng; on the street). This 
section gives you a head start in making a good first
impression.

Chinese Phrases For Dummies 
58
Acquainting yourself
You have options other than nî hâo (nee how; hi; how
are you) when you first meet someone, such as
 Hên g≈oxìng jiàndào nî. (hun gaow sheeng jyan
daow nee; Glad to meet you.)
 Wô hên róngxìng. (waw hun roong sheeng; I’m
honored to meet you.)
Or if you want a time-specific greeting, try
 zâo (dzaow; good morning)
 zâo ≈n (dzaow ahn; good morning; literally:
early peace)
 wân ≈n (wahn ahn; good night)
Don’t know what to say after the first nî hâo? The fol-
lowing are a few examples of common opening lines
to get you started:
 Qîng ràng wô jièshào wô zìjî. (cheeng rahng
waw jyeh shaow waw dzuh jee; Please let me
introduce myself.)
 Wô jiào ______. Nî ne? (waw jyaow ____. nee
nuh; My name is _____. What’s yours?)
 Nî jiào shénme míngzi? (nee jyaow shummuh
meeng dzuh; What’s your name?)
 Wô shì Mêiguórén. (waw shir may gwaw run; I’m
an American.)
Introducing your friends and family
To introduce your friends to each other, say “Qîng
ràng wô jièshào wôde péngyôu, Carl.” (cheeng rahng
waw jyeh shaow waw duh puhng yo, Carl; May I please
introduce my friend, Carl.) In addition to introducing
your péngyôu (puhng yo; friend), you can also intro-
duce these important people:

Chapter 4: . . . Enjoying Small Talk
59
 àirén (eye run; spouse — used mostly in main-
land China [as opposed to Taiwan])
 bàba (bah bah; father)
 érzi (are dzuh; son)
 fùmû (foo moo; parents)
 mûqin (moo cheen; mother)
 fùqin (foo cheen; father)
 háizi (hi dzuh; children)
 lâobân (laow bahn; boss)
 lâosh∫(laow shir; teacher)
 m≈ma (mah mah; mother)
 nán péngyôu (nahn puhng yo; boyfriend)
 nh’ér (nyew are; daughter)
 nhpéngyôu (nyew pung yo; girlfriend)
 q∫zi (chee dzuh; wife)
 s∆nnh (swun nyew; granddaughter)
 s∆nzi (swun dzuh; grandson)
 tàitài (tye tye; wife — used mostly in Taiwan)
 tóngshì (toong shir; colleague)
 tóngw∆(toong woo; roommate)
 tóngxué (toong shweh; classmate)
 wôde péngyôu (waw duh puhng yo; my friend)
 xi∂ngdì jiêmèi (shyoong dee jyeh may; brothers
and sisters)
 zhàngfu (jahng foo; husband)
 zûfù (dzoo foo; grandfather)
 zûmû (dzoo moo; grandmother)
When introducing two people to each other,
always introduce the one with the lower
social status and/or age to the person with
the higher social status. The Chinese con-
sider it polite.

Chinese Phrases For Dummies 
60
Asking people for their names
Many situations call for informal greetings like 
 Wô jiào Sarah. Nî ne? (waw jyaow Sarah. nee
nuh; My name is Sarah. And yours?)
 Nî jiào shénme míngzi? (nee jyaow shummuh
meeng dzuh; What’s your name?)
To show a greater level of politeness and respect, ask 
Nín guì xìng? (neen gway sheeng; literally:
What’s your honorable surname?) 
When answering this question, don’t use the honorific
guì to refer to yourself. Such a response is like saying
“My esteemed family name is Smith.” The best way to
answer is to say Wô xìng Smith. (waw sheeng Smith;
My family name is Smith.)
The polite way to ask the name of someone who’s
younger than yourself or lower in social status is
Nî jiào shénme míngzi? (nee jyaow shummuh
meeng dzuh; What’s your name?) 
Even though míngzi usually means “given name,”
when you ask this question, it may elicit an answer of
first and last name.
If a guy tells you his name in Chinese, you
can be sure the first syllable he utters will 
be his surname, not his given name. So if he
says his name is Lî Shìmín, for example, his
family name is Lî and his given name is
Shìmín. Keep on referring to him as Lî
Shìmín (rather than just Shìmín) until you
become really good friends. If you want to
address him as Xi≈nsh√ng (shyan shuhng;
Mr.), or if you’re addressing a female as
Xiâojiê (shyaow jyeh; Miss), you put that 
title after his or her last name and say Lî
Xi≈nsh√ng or Lî Xiâojiê. Even though the
Chinese language has words for Mr., Miss,
and Mrs. (tàitài; tye tye), it doesn’t have an
equivalent term for “Ms.” At least not yet.

This little conversation shows how to introduce a
friend:
Sylvia: Irene, qîng ràng wô jièshào wôde
péngyôu Mel. (Irene, cheeng rahng waw jyeh
shaow waw duh puhng yo Mel; Irene, allow me to
introduce my friend Mel.)
Irene: Nî hâo. Hên g≈oxìng jiàndào nî. (nee how.
hun gaow sheeng jyan daow nee; Hi. Nice to 
meet you.)
Mel: Hên g≈oxìng jiàndào nî. Wô shì Sylvia de
tóngxué. (hun gaow sheeng jyan daow nee. waw
shir Sylvia duh toong shweh; Good to meet you.
I’m Sylvia’s classmate.)
Irene: Hên g≈oxìng jiàndào nî. (hun gaow sheeng
jyan daow nee; Nice to meet you.) 
Mel: Nîmen zénme rènshì? (nee mun dzummuh
run shir; How do you happen to know each
other?)
Irene: Wômen shì tóngshì. (waw mun shir toong
shir; We’re coworkers.)
Addressing new friends and strangers
You can always safely greet people in professional set-
tings by announcing their last name followed by their
title, such as Wáng Xiàozhâng (wahng shyaow jahng;
President [of an educational institution] Wang) or J∫n
Zhûrèn (jeen joo run; Director Jin). Here are some
other examples of occupational titles:
 bùzhâng (boo jahng; department head or 
minister)
 fùzhûrèn (foo joo run; assistant director)
 jiàoshòu (jyaow show; professor)
 j∫nglî (jeeng lee; manager)
 lâosh∫(laow shir; teacher)

Chinese Phrases For Dummies 
62
Sometimes people add the terms lâo (laow;
old) or xiâo (shyaow; young) in front of the
last name and omit the first name com-
pletely. It indicates a comfortable degree of
familiarity and friendliness that can only
develop over time. But make sure you know
which one to use — lâo is for someone who’s
older than you, and xiâo is for someone
who’s younger than you.
Taking (a.k.a. rejecting) 
compliments
Chinese people are always impressed whenever they
meet a foreigner who has taken the time to learn their
language. So when you speak Zh∂ngwén (joong one;
Chinese) to a Zh∂ngguórén (joong gwaw run; Chinese
person), he may very well say “Nîde Zh∂ngwén tài
hâole.” (nee duh joong one tye how luh; Your Chinese
is fantastic.) But don’t give in to the temptation to
accept the compliment easily and say xièxiè (shyeh
shyeh; thanks), because that implies that you agree
wholeheartedly with the complimentary assessment.
Instead, try one of the following replies. Each of them
can be roughly translated as “It’s nothing” or the
equivalent of “No, no, I don’t deserve any praise.”
 guò jiâng guò jiâng (gwaw jyahng gwaw jyahng)
 nálî nálî (nah lee nah lee)
 nâr de huà (nar duh hwah)
Saying goodbye
When it comes time to say goodbye, refer to the fol-
lowing list of phrases:
 Huítóu jiàn. (hway toe jyan; See you later.)
 Míngnián jiàn. (meeng nyan jyan; See you next
year.)
 Míngti≈n jiàn. (meeng tyan jyan; See you 
tomorrow.)

Chapter 4: . . . Enjoying Small Talk

 Xiàge lîbài jiàn. (shyah guh lee bye jyan; See you
next week.)
 X∫ngq∫’èr jiàn. (sheeng chee are jyan; See you on
Tuesday.)
 Y∫huîr jiàn. (ee hwahr jyan; See you soon.)
 Yílù píng’≈n. (ee loo peeng ahn; Have a good
trip.)
 Zài jiàn. (dzye jyan; Goodbye.)
Practice your adieu’s with this conversation:
Christopher: Lâosh∫zâo. (laow shir dzaow; 
Good morning, Professor.)
Professor: Zâo. Nî hâo. (dzaow. nee how; Good
morning. Hello.)
Christopher: J∫nti≈n de ti≈nqì hên hâo, duì
búduì? (jin tyan duh tyan chee hun how, dway
boo dway; The weather today is great, isn’t it?)
Professor: Duìle. Hên hâo. (dway luh. hun how;
Yes, it is. It’s very nice.)
Christopher: Nèmme míngti≈n shàngkè de
shíhòu zài jiàn. (nummuh, meeng tyan shahng
kuh duh shir ho dzye jyan; So, I’ll see you again in
class tomorrow.)
Professor: Hâo. Míngti≈n jiàn. (how. meeng tyan
jyan; Okay. See you tomorrow.)
Asking Basic Questions
A surefire way of initiating a conversation is to ask
someone a question. Here are some basic question
words to keep in mind:
 Du∂jiû? (dwaw jyoe; For how long?)
 Shéi (shay; Who?)
 Shénme? (shummuh; What?)
 Shénme shíhòu? (shummuh shir ho; When?)

Chinese Phrases For Dummies 
64
 Wèishénme? (way shummuh; Why?)
 Zài nâr? (dzye nar; Where?)
 Zênme? (dzummah; How?)
These examples can help you use these question
words in simple sentences — sometimes you can also
use some of them on their own, just as in English:
 T≈shì shéi? (tah shir shay; Who is he/she?)
 Nî yào shénme? (nee yaow shummuh; What
would you like?)
 Jî diân zh∂ng? (jee dyan joong; What time is it?)
 Cèsuô zài nâr? (tsuh swaw dzye nar; Where’s the
bathroom?)
 Nî shénme shíhòu ch∫fàn? (nee shummuh shir
ho chir fahn; When do you eat?)
 Nî wèishénme yào qù Zh∂ngguó? (nee way
shummuh yaow chyew joong gwaw; Why do you
want to go to China?)
 Nî zênme yàng? (nee dzummah yahng; How’s it
going?)
 Nî yîj∫ng zài zhèr du∂jiû le? (nee ee jeeng dzye
jar dwaw jyoe luh; How long have you been here
already?)
 Xiànzài jî diân zh∂ng? (shyan dzye jee dyan
joong; What time is it now?)
You can also use the following responses to the ques-
tions in the preceding list if someone happens to
approach you. These statements are the basics of
small talk and really come in handy when studying a
foreign language:
 Wô bùdông. (waw boo doong; I don’t 
understand.)
 Wô bùzh∫dào. (waw boo jir daow; I don’t know.)
 Wô búrènshi t≈. (waw boo run shir tah; I don’t
know him/her.)

 Duìbùqî. (dway boo chee; Excuse me.)
 Hên bàoqiàn. (hun baow chyan; I’m so sorry.)

Chatting It Up
Xiánliáo (shyan lyaow) means “small talk” in Chinese.
Xiántán (shyan tahn) is “to chat” . . . either term does
the trick. This section helps you master a few key
phrases and questions you can use to establish a 
relationship.
Yakking about the weather
Talking about the ti≈nqì (tyan chee; weather) is
always a safe topic in any conversation. In fact, it’s
kind of the universal icebreaker. If the skies are blue
and all seems right with the world, you can start by
saying 

Chapter 4: . . . Enjoying Small Talk
67
J∫nti≈n de ti≈nqì zh√n hâo, duì bú duì? (jin tyan
duh tyan chee juhn how, dway boo dway; The
weather today is sure nice, isn’t it?) 
The following adjectives can help you describe tem-
perature and humidity:
 lêng (lung; cold)
 liángkuài (lyahng kwye; cool)
 m√nrè (mun ruh; muggy)
 nuânhuó (nwan hwaw; warm)
 rè (ruh; hot)
The sìjì (suh jee; four seasons) — d∂ngti≈n (doong
tyan; winter), ch∆nti≈n (chwun tyan; spring), xiàti≈n
(shyah tyan; summer), and qi∆ti≈n (chyo tyan; fall) —
all have their charms. They also all have their distinc-
tive characteristics when it comes to the weather,
which you can express with the following words in
any conversation:
 bàof√ngxuê (baow fuhng shweh; blizzard)
 dàf√ng (dah fuhng; gusty winds)
 du∂yún (dwaw yewn; cloudy)
 f√ng hên dà (fuhng hun dah; windy)
 léiyû (lay yew; thunderstorm)
 qínglâng (cheeng lahng; sunny)
 qíngti≈n (cheeng tyan; clear)
 xià máomáoyû (shyah maow maow yew; drizzle)
 xiàwù (shyah woo; fog)
 xiàxuê (shyah shweh; snow)
 xiàyû (shyah yew; rainy)
 y∫nti≈n (yeen tyan; overcast)
Try out this small talk on the weather:

warm.)

shweh, hi kuh yee chyew lyo beeng. nummah hah
are been doong tyan duh shir ho hun how wahn;
In cold weather, you can go skiing or ice-skating.
So Harbin during the winter is a lot of fun.)
Finding out where people are from
Wondering where people are from when you first
meet them is only natural. You ask them by saying 
Nî shì cóng nâr láide? (nee shir tsoong nar lye
duh; Where are you from?)
To answer, you replace the word nî (nee; you) with
wô (waw; I) and put the name of wherever you’re
from where the word nâr is.
Wô shì cóng Paris láide. (waw shir tsoong paris
lye duh; I am from Paris.)
People in Taiwan say nálî (nah lee) rather
than nâr (nar) for the word “where.” Nâr
indicates a northern accent and is used pri-
marily by people from mainland China.
This list includes countries that may come up in 
conversation:

Chatting about family
If you want to talk about your family when answering
questions or making small talk, you need to know
who is in your family. (Check out “Introducing your
friends and family” earlier in this chapter for impor-
tant vocabulary words.)
Join with these women chatting about their families:
Lî Huá: Beverly, nî yôu méiyôu xi∂ngdì jiêmèi?
(Beverly, nee yo mayo shyoong dee jyeh may;

Making small talk on the job
The kind of job you have can say plenty about you. It
can also be a great topic of conversation or spice up
an otherwise dull exchange. To ask someone about
his or her g∂ngzuò (goong dzwaw; work), you can say
Nî zuò shénme g∂ngzuò? (nee dzwaw shummuh
goong dzwaw; What kind of work do you do?)
You may even try to guess and say, for example,
Nî shì lâosh∫ma? (nee shir laow shir mah; Are
you a teacher?)
The following are some occupations you or the
person you’re talking with may hold:
 bi≈njí (byan jee; editor)
 cáifeng (tsye fung; tailor)
 chéngwùyuán (chuhng woo ywan; flight 
attendant)
 ch∆nàyuán (choo nah ywan; bank teller)
 diàng∂ng (dyan goong; electrician)
 f√ixíngyuán (fay sheeng ywan; pilot)

 j∫nglî (jeeng lee; manager)
 miànshì (myan shir; interview)
 quán rì g∂ngzuò (chwan ir goong dzwaw; full-
time work)

In China, your d≈nwèi (dahn way; work unit)
is an important part of your life. (This term
refers to your place of work, which can be
anywhere in the country. Your d≈nwèi is the
group that’s responsible for both taking care
of you and being responsible for any mis-
steps you happen to make.) In fact, when
people ask you to identify yourself over the
phone, they often say “Nî nâr?” (nee nar;
literally: Where are you from?) to find out
what d≈nwèi you belong to.

Talking about where you live
After folks get to know each other through small talk,
they may exchange addresses and phone numbers to
keep in touch. That introductory question covered

Chinese Phrases For Dummies 
74
earlier in this chapter, “Nî zhù zài nâr?” (nee joo dzye
nar; Where do you live?), may pop up. You may also
want to ask a few of these questions:
 Nîde dìzhî shì shénme? (nee duh dee jir shir
shummuh; What’s your address?)
 Nîde diànhuà hàomâ du∂shâo? (nee duh dyan
hwah how mah dwaw shaow; What’s your phone
number?)
 Nî shénme shíhòu zài ji≈? (nee shummuh shir ho
dzye jyah; When will you be at home?/When are
you home?)
You may also talk about your home from time to time.
These words and phrases can come in handy:
 Wômen zhù de shì fángzi. (waw mun joo duh
shir fahng dzuh; We live in a house.)
 T≈zhù de shì g∂ngyù. (tah joo duh shir guh
goong yew; She lives in an apartment.)
 T≈men yôu yíge yuànzi. (tah mun yo ee guh
ywan dzuh; They have a yard.)
 Nî yôu yíge hu≈yuán. (nee yo ee guh hwah
ywan; You have a garden.)
 Wô zhù zài chénglî. (waw joo dzye chuhng lee;
I live in the city.)
 Wô zhù zài ji≈owài. (waw joo dzye jyaow why;
I live in the suburbs.)
 Wô zhù zài nóngc∆n. (waw joo dzye noong
tswun; I live in the country.)
In addition to your diànhuà hàomâ (dyan hwah how
mah; phone number) and your dìzhî (dee jir; address),
most people also want to know your diànzî yóuxi≈ng
dìzhî (dyan dzuh yo shyahng dee jir; e-mail address).
And if you find yourself in a more formal situation, it
may be appropriate to give someone your míngpiàn
(meeng pyan; business card).

xploring Chinese food and Chinese eating eti-
quette is a great way to discover Chinese culture.
You can also use what you discover in this chapter to
impress your date by ordering in Chinese the next
time you eat out.
All about Meals
If you feel hungry when beginning this section, then
stop and ch∫(chir; eat) some fàn (fahn; food). Different
meals throughout the day, for example, are called
 zâofàn (dzaow fahn; breakfast)
 wûfàn (woo fahn; lunch)
 wânfàn (wahn fahn; dinner)
For centuries, Chinese people greeted each other not
by saying “Nî hâo ma?” (nee how ma; How are you?),
but by saying “Nî ch∫fàn le méiyôu?” (nee chir fahn
luh mayo; literally: “Have you eaten?”)

Chinese Phrases For Dummies 
76
If you’re hungry, you can say wô hên è (waw hun uh;
I’m very hungry) and wait for a friend to invite you for
a bite to eat. If you’re thirsty, just say wôde kôu hên
kê (waw duh ko hun kuh; literally: my mouth is very
dry) to hear offers for all sorts of drinks.
Or you can be subtler with one of these phrases:
 Nî è ma? (nee uh mah; Are you hungry?)
 Nî è bú è? (nee uh boo uh; Are you hungry?)
 Nî hái méi ch∫wânfàn ba. (nee hi may chir wahn
fahn bah; I bet you haven’t had dinner yet.)
When having dinner at someone’s home, don’t be hes-
itant to use some of these phrases at the table:
 Màn ch∫or màn màn ch∫! (mahn chir or mahn
mahn chir; Bon appetite!) This phrase literally
means “Eat slowly,” but it’s loosely translated
as “Take your time and enjoy your food.”
 Zìjî lái. (dzuh jee lye; I’ll help myself.)
 G≈nb√i! (gahn bay; Bottoms up!)
 Du∂ch∫yìdiâr ba! (dwaw chir ee dyar bah; Have
some more!)
 Wô ch∫bâo le. (waw chir baow luh; I’m full.)
Whenever a dining partner begins to serve
you food, as is the custom, you must always
feign protest with a few mentions of zìjî lái
(dzuh jee lye; I’ll help myself) so you don’t
appear to assume that someone should be
serving you. In the end, permit the person
to follow proper etiquette by serving you
portions from each dish if you’re the guest.
Dining Out
Whether you eat in a friend’s home or in a fancy
Chinese restaurant, you need to know how to ask for
some basic utensils and how to refer to items already
on the table.

Chapter 5: Enjoying a Drink and a Snack (or Meal!)
77
You ask for something politely by saying Qîng nî gêi
wô . . . (cheeng nee gay waw; Would you mind please
getting me a . . .)
You can also say Máfan nî gêi wô . . . (mah fahn nee
gay waw; May I trouble you to please get me a . . .)
Here are some items you commonly encounter or
need to ask for when dining out:
 yíge wân (ee guh wahn; a bowl)
 yíge pánzi (ee guh pahn dzuh; a plate)
 yíge b√izi (ee guh bay dzuh; a glass)
 yíge tiáog√ng (ee guh tyaow guhng; a spoon)
 yíge d≈ozi (ee guh daow dzuh; a knife)
 yíge ch≈zi (ee guh chah dzuh; a fork)
 yì zh≈ng c≈nj∫n (ee jahng tsahn jeen; a napkin)
 yì g√n yáqi≈n (ee gun yah chyan; a toothpick)
 yíge sh∫máoj∫n (ee guh shir maow jeen; a wet
towel)
 yíge rè máoj∫n (ee guh ruh maow jeen; a hot
towel)
 yì shu≈ng kuàizi (ee shwahng kwye dzuh; a pair
of chopsticks)
When in doubt, use the measure word ge
(guh) in front of the noun you want to modify
by a numeral or a specifier, such as “this”
(zhè; jay) or “that” (nà; nah). As you can
see from the previous list, the word for “a”
always begins with y∫(ee), meaning the
number 1 in Chinese. In between y∫and the
noun is the measure word. For chopsticks, it’s
shu≈ng (shwahng), meaning pair; for napkin,
it’s zh≈ng (jahng), used for anything with a
flat surface (such as paper, a map, or even a
bed); and a toothpick’s measuring word is g√n
(gun), referring to anything resembling a stick,
such as rope, a thread, or a blade of grass.
Chinese has many different measure words,
but ge (guh) is by far the most common.

When you’re thinking about dining out, here’s a con-
versation you may have:
Livia: Charlotte, nî hâo! (Charlotte, nee how;
Charlotte, hi!)
Charlotte: Nî hâo. Hâo jiû méi jiàn. (nee how.
how jyoe may jyan; Hi there. Long time no see.)
Livia: Nî è bú è? (nee uh boo uh; Are you

Charlotte: Wô hên è. Nî ne? (waw hun uh. nee

Charlotte: Bêij∫ng kâo y≈diàn hâoxiàng bú cuò.
(bay jeeng cow ya dyan how shyang boo tswaw;
The Peking Duck place seems very good.)
Understanding What’s
on the Menu
Familiarize yourself with the basic types of food on
the càid≈n (tsye dahn; menu) in case you have only
Chinese characters and pinyin romanization to go on.
Having the knowledge allows you to immediately know
which section to focus on (or, likewise, to avoid).
Table 5-1 shows the typical elements of a càid≈n:

Dipping into some dim sum
Dim sum takes the shape of mini portions, and it’s
often served with tea to help cut through the oil and
grease afterwards. Part of the allure of dim sum is
that you get to sample a whole range of different
tastes while you catch up with old friends. Dim sum
meals can last for hours, which is why most Chinese
people choose the weekends to have dim sum. No
problem lingering on a Saturday or Sunday.
You can tell the waiter you want a specific kind of dim
sum by saying: 
Qîng lái yì dié _____. (cheeng lye ee dyeh
_______; please give me a plate of _____). Fill in
the blank with one of the tasty choices I list in
Table 5-3.

Placing an Order and Chatting
with the Wait Staff
Chinese table etiquette dictates that every-
one decides together what to order. The two
main categories you must decide upon are
the cài (tsye; food dishes) and the t≈ng
(tahng; soup). Feel free to be the first one to
ask wômen y∫ngg≈i ji≈o jîge cài jiîge t≈ng?
(waw men eeng gye jyaow jee guh tsye jee guh
tahng; How many dishes and how many
soups should we order?). Ideally, one of each
of the five major tastes should appear in the
dishes you choose for your meal to be a
“true” Chinese meal: su≈n (swan; sour), tián
(tyan; sweet), kû (koo; bitter), là (lah; spicy),
or xián (shyan; salty).
Here are some questions your server is likely to
ask you:
 Nîmen yào shénme cài? (nee men yaow shum-
muh tsye; What would you like to order?
Literally: What kind of food would you like?)
 Nîmen yào h√diâr shénme? (nee mun yaow huh
dyar shummuh; What would you like to drink?)
 Yào jî píng píjiû? (yaow jee peeng pee jyoe; How
many bottles of beer do you want?)
And here are some phrases that come in handy when
you need to give an answer:
 Wômen yào yíge su≈n là t≈ng. (waw mun yaow
ee guh swan lah tahng; We’d like a hot-and-sour
soup.)
 Wô bù ch∫là de. (waw boo chir lah duh; I don’t
eat spicy food.)
 Qîng bié fàng wèij∫ng, wô guòmîn. (cheeng
byeh fahng way jeeng, waw gwaw meen; Please
don’t use any MSG, I’m allergic.)

Chapter 5: Enjoying a Drink and a Snack (or Meal!)
87
When addressing a food server, you can call him or
her by the same name: fúwùyuán (foo woo ywan; ser-
vice personnel). In fact, “he,” “she,” and “it” all share
the same Chinese word, too: t≈(tah). Isn’t that easy to
remember?
 Qîng gêi wô càid≈n. (cheeng gay waw tsye dahn;
Please give me the menu.)
 Nî gêi wômen jièshào jîge cài, hâo ma? (nee
gay waw men jyeh shaow gee guh tsye, how ma;
Can you recommend some dishes?)
 Dà sh∫fu náshôu cài shì shénme? (dah shir foo
nah show tsye shir shummuh; What’s the chef’s
specialty?)
 Yú x∫nxi≈n ma? (yew shin shyan mah; Is the fish
fresh?)
 Wô bú yuànyì ch∫hâish√n. (waw boo ywan yee
chir hi shun; I don’t want to try sea slugs.)
 Nîmen yôu kuàngquán shuî ma? (nee mun yo
kwahng chwan shway mah; Do you have any
mineral water?)
 Wô bú yào là de cài. (waw boo yaow lah duh
tsye; I don’t want anything spicy.)
 Wô bù néng ch∫yôu táng de cài. (waw boo
nuhng chir yo tahng duh tsye; I can’t eat anything
made with sugar.)
 Wô bù ch∫zh∆ròu. (waw boo chir joo row; I
don’t eat pork.)
 Qîng c≈zhu∂zi. (cheeng tsah jwaw dzuh; Please
wipe off the table.)
 Qîng bâ yînliào sòng lái. (cheeng bah yin lyaow
soong lye; Please bring our drinks.)
 Wô méi jiào zhèige. (waw may jyaow jay guh; I
didn’t order this.)
Here’s how a conversation may go when ordering:
Tom: Wômen néng bùnéng kànkàn càid≈n?
(waw mun nung boo nung kahn kahn tsye dahn;
May we see the menu?)

Tom: Qîng wèn, nîmen de náshôu cài shì

Finding the Restrooms
After you have a bite to eat, you may be in need of a
restroom. The need may be dire if you’re smack in the
middle of a 12-course banquet in Beijing and already
had a couple of glasses of máotái (maow tye), the
stiffest of all Chinese drinks.
Now all you have to do is garner the energy to ask
“Cèsuô zài nâr?” (tsuh swaw dzye nar; Where’s the
restroom?) if you’re in mainland China or “Cèsuô zài
nâlî?” (tsuh swaw dzye nah lee) if you’re in Taiwan.
You can also ask “Nâlî kéyî xî shôu? (nah lee kuh yee
she show; Where can I wash my hands?)
In most cases, the pictures on the bathroom
doors are self-explanatory, but you may also
see the pinyin for male (nán; nahn) and
female (nh; nyew) before the word cèsuô.
Those are the words you want to pay atten-
tion to above all else.

Finishing Your Meal and
Paying the Bill
After you’re through sampling all possible permuta-
tions of Chinese cuisine, you need to pay the bill, my
friend. I hope the food was worth the expense. Here
are some phrases you need to know when the time
comes:
 B≈okuò fúwùfèi. (baow kwaw foo woo fay; The
tip is included.)
 f√nk≈i suàn (fun kye swahn; to go Dutch)
 jiézhàng (jyeh jahng; to pay the bill)
 Qîng jiézhàng. (cheeng jyeh jahng; The check,
please.)
 Qîng k≈i sh∂ujù. (cheeng kye show jyew; Please
give me the receipt.)
 Wô kéyî yòng xìnyòng kâ ma? (waw kuh yee
yoong sheen yoong kah mah; May I use a credit
card?)
 Wô qîng kè. (waw cheeng kuh; It’s on me.)
 Zhàngd≈n b≈okuò fúwùf√i ma? (jahng dahn
baow kwaw foo woo fay mah; Does the bill
include a service charge/tip?)
 Zhàngd≈n yôu cuò. (jahng dahn yo tswaw; The
bill is incorrect.)
The following is a short conversation about paying
a tip:
Rebecca: Wômen de zhàngd≈n yígòng s≈nshí
kuài qián. Xiâo fèi y∫ngg≈i du∂shâo? (waw mun
duh jahng dahn ee goong sahn shir kwye chyan.
shyaow fay eeng guy dwaw shaow; Our bill comes
to $30 altogether. How much should the tip be?)

Rebecca: Tóngyì. (toong ee; I agree.)
All the Tea in China
You encounter about as many different kinds of tea
as you do Chinese dialects. Hundreds, in fact. To
make ordering or buying this beverage easier, how-
ever, you really only need to know the most common
kinds of tea:
 Lf chá. (lyew chah; Green tea) Green tea is the
oldest of all the teas in China, with many unfer-
mented subvarieties. The most famous kind of
Green tea is called lóngjîng chá (loong jeeng
chah), meaning Dragon Well tea. You can find it
near the famous West Lake region in Hangzhou,
and people in the south generally prefer this
kind of tea.
 Hóng chá. (hoong chah; Black tea) Even though
hóng means red in Chinese, you translate this
phrase as Black tea. Unlike Green tea, Black teas
are fermented and enjoyed primarily by people
in Fujian Province.
 W∆lóng chá. (oo loong chah; Black dragon tea)
This kind of tea is semifermented. It’s a favorite
in Guangdong and Fujian provinces and in
Taiwan.
 Mòlì hu≈chá. (maw lee hwah chah; Jasmine)
This kind of tea consists of a combination of
Black, Green, and W∆lóng teas, in addition to
some fragrant flowers like jasmine or magnolia
thrown in for good measure. Most northerners
are partial to jasmine tea, probably because the
north is cold and this type of tea raises the
body’s temperature.

(gwahng shahng dyan; window shopping) or actually
about to mâi d∂ngxi doesn’t matter. You can still
enjoy looking at all the sh≈ngpîn (shahng peen;

 ch≈ojí shìchâng (chow jee shir chahng;

 xiédiàn (shyeh dyan; shoe store)
 yàofáng (yaow fahng; drugstore)
When you finally make up your mind about what to
shop for, you may want to call ahead to check out the
store’s hours. The following questions can be helpful:
 Nín jî diân zh∂ng k≈i/gu≈n mén? (neen jee dyan
joong kye/gwahn mun; What time do you open/

 Nîmen wûdiân zh∂ng yîhòu hái k≈i ma? (nee

 Nîmen x∫ngq∫ti≈n k≈i bùk≈i? (nee mun

If all you want to do is browse, you don’t want a
shòuhuòyuán (show hwaw ywan; salesperson) sneak-
ing up behind you and asking Nî xiâng mâi shénme?
(nee shyahng my shummuh; What would you like to
buy?). At this point, just say Wô zhî shì kànkàn.
Xièxiè. (waw jir shir kahn kahn. shyeh shyeh; I’m just

But if you really do want help, here are some phrases
that can help:

 Nî yôu méiyôu Y∫ngwén de sh∆? (nee yo mayo

 Nîmen mài búmài gu≈ngpán? (nee mun my boo

Shopping for Clothes
Going shopping for clothes is an art — one requiring
plenty of patience and fortitude, not to mention new
vocabulary if you’re going to do it in Chinese. 
What’s your size?
To find the right dàxiâo (dah shyaow; size) in Chinese,
here are some useful phrases you may want to know:

Chinese Phrases For Dummies 
96
 Nín chu≈n du∂dà hào? (neen chwan dwaw dah
how; What size are you?)
 Dàxiâo búduì. (dah shyaow boo dway; It’s the
wrong size.)
 Hên hésh√n. (hun huh shun; It fits really well.)
 Zài Mêiguó wôde chîcùn shì wû hào. (dzye may
gwaw waw duh chir tswun shir woo how; In
America I wear a size 5.)
Instead of using the word dàxiâo, you can say 
 Wô chu≈n s≈nshíq∫hào. (waw chwahn sahn shir
chee how; I wear a size 37.)
 Nín chu≈n jî hào de chènsh≈n? (neen chwahn
jee how duh chun shahn; What size shirt do
you wear?)
 Wô chu≈n xiâohào. (waw chwahn shyaow how; I
wear a size small.)
Of course, you can always guess your approximate
size just by indicating you want to see something in
one of the following categories:
 xiâo (shyaow; small)
 zh∂ng (joong; medium)
 dà (dah; large)
Here’s a sample conversation using some of these
phrases:
Julia: Wô xiâng mâi yíjiàn jiákè. (waw shyahng
my ee jyan jyah kuh; I’m looking for a jacket.)
Clerk: Hâo ba. Nî chu≈n jî hào? (how bah. nee
chwahn jee how; Very well. What size are you?)
Julia: Wô bùzh∫dào. Mêiguó de hàomâ hé
Zh∂ngguó de hàomâ hên bùyíyàng. (waw boo jir
daow. may gwaw duh how ma huh joong gwaw duh
how ma hun boo ee yahng; I don’t know. American
sizes are quite different from Chinese sizes.)

wear a size small.)

Would you mind showing me the small size 
jackets, then? Thank you.)

What are you wearing?
Chu≈n versus dài
Dài (dye) and chu≈n (chwan) both mean to wear, but
Chinese uses them differently depending on what
you’re putting on your body. You dài things like
màozi (maow dzuh; hats) and yânjìng (yan jeeng;
glasses) — in other words accessories, but you chu≈n
things like qúnzi (chewn dzuh; skirts) and dày∫(dah
ee; coats).

 wàzi (wah dzuh; socks)
 yûy∫(yew ee; raincoat) 
 g≈og√nxiê (gaow gun shyeh; high heels)
Here are some things you dài:
 lîngdài (leeng dye; necktie)
 shôubiâo (show byow; wristwatch)
 shôutào (show taow; gloves)
 zh∆bâo (joo byaow; jewelry)
Asking about the color
Yánsè (yan suh; colors) are an important considera-
tion when buying clothes. Do you generally prefer
d≈nsè (dahn suh; solid colors) or hu≈(hwah; pat-
terned) shirts? The following is a list of handy words
the next time you go shopping either for clothes or
for material to create your own.

Laurel: Zhè jiàn máoy∫nî juéde zênmeyàng?
(jay jyan maow ee nee jweh duh dzummuh yahng;

John: Nà jiàn máoy∫tài xiâo. Yánsè yê

Laurel: Nî xîhu≈n shénme yánsè? (nee she hwahn

John: Wô xîhu≈n hóngde. Búyào nèige h√ide.
(waw she hwahn hoong duh. boo yaow nay guh

black one.)
Laurel: Hâole. Nà, wô jiù mâi hóngde ba. (how
luh. nah, waw jyo my hoong duh bah; Okay. In
that case I’ll buy the red one.)

When the possessive particle de is attached
to an adjective and no noun follows it, it can
be translated as the one which is (adjective),
as in hóngde (hoong duh; the red one), dà de
(dah duh; the big one), tián de (tyan duh; the
sweet one), and so on.
You can use two classifiers when it comes
to clothing: jiàn and tiáo. Classifiers are
the words used in between a number or the
words this or that and the clothing you’re
talking about. Jiàn is used when you’re talk-
ing about clothing worn on the upper part
of the body, and tiáo is used for clothes
worn on the lower part. So you’d say yíjiàn
chènsh≈n (ee jyan chun shahn; one shirt)
or s≈ntiáo kùzi (sahn tyaow koo dzuh; three
pairs of pants).
Shopping for Other Items
Of course clothes aren’t the only items in the world to
buy. How about some antiques or hi-tech toys? The
possibilities are endless in today’s consumer-oriented
world.
Hunting for antiques
One of the best places in the world to go searching for
gûdông (goo doong; antiques) is — you guessed it —
China. The following words and phrases can come in
handy when hunting for antiques:
 Zhè shì nêige cháodài de? (jay shir nay guh
chaow dye duh; Which dynasty is this from?)
 Néng dài ch∆guó ma? (nung dye choo gwaw

 Nîde gûdông dìtân zài nâr? (nee duh goo doong

Getting a Good Price and Paying
When you’re ready to buy some merchandise, here are
two simple ways to ask how much the products cost:
 Du∂shâo qián? (dwaw shaow chyan; How much
money is it?)
 Jîkuài qián? (jee kwye chyan; literally: How
many dollars does it cost?)
The only difference between the two questions is the
implied amount of the cost. If you use the question
word “du∂shâo” (dwaw shaow), you want to inquire
about something that’s most likely greater than $10. If
you use “jî” in front of kuài (kwye; the term for dol-
lars), you assume the product costs less than $10. Of
course, whether you accept that price depends on
where you’re shopping.
Negotiating prices at the night market
Among the more fun things to do in Taiwan and main-
land China is visit one of the many lively night mar-
kets. Because the Chinese love to mâi d∂ngxi (my
doong she; shop) and tâojià huánjià (taow jyah hwahn
jyah; haggle), you’ll have plenty of company on your
sojourns.
You always need to assume that prices are negotiable
in an open-air market. You can always ask one of the
following and see what happens:
 Néng bùnéng piányì yìdiâr? (nung boo nung
pyan yee ee dyar; Can you sell it more cheaply?)
 Néng bùnéng shâo yìdiâr? (nung boo nung
shaow ee dyar; Can you lower the price?)
Or you can always play hardball and say something
like Zênme zhèmme guì a? (dzummah jummah gway
ah; Why is this so expensive?) in an exasperated voice,
start walking away and see what happens. These 
haggling-related phrases are also worth knowing:

Chinese Phrases For Dummies 
106
 Nîmen sh∂u bù sh∂u Mêiyuán? (nee mun show
boo show may ywan; Do you accept U.S. dollars?)
 Zhèige du∂shâo qián? (jay guh dwaw shaow
chyan; How much is this?)
 Dâ zhé, hâo bùhâo? (dah juh, how boo how;
How about giving me a discount?)
 Kéyî jiâng jià ma? (kuh yee jyahng jyah mah;
Can we negotiate the price?)
The following conversation uses some of these
phrases:
Kate: Zhè tiáo hóng qúnzi du∂shâo qián? (jay
tyaow hoong chwun dzuh dwaw shaow chyan;
How much is this red skirt?)
Clerk: Nà tiáo qúnzi èrshíwû kuài qián. (nah
tyaow chwun dzuh are shir woo kwye chyan; That
skirt is $25.)
Kate: Nà tài guìle! Nî néng bùnéng dâ zhé? (nah
tye gway luh. nee nung boo nung dah juh; That’s
too expensive! Can you give me a discount?)
Clerk: Kênéng. (kuh nung. Perhaps.)
Kate: Nî néng gêi wô du∂dà de zhékòu? (nee
nung gay waw dwaw dah duh juh ko; How much
of a discount can you give me?)
Clerk: Bâi f√n zh∫shí, hâo bùhâo? (bye fun jir
shir, how boo how; How’s 10 percent?)
Kate: Nà tài hâo le. Xièxiè. (nah tye how luh.
shyeh shyeh; That’s great. Thanks.)
Demanding a refund
If you end up being bùyúkuài (boo yew kwye;
unhappy) about your purchase, one of these phrases
may come in handy when you try to tuì (tway; return)
your huò (hwaw; merchandise):
 Wô y≈oqiú tuìkuân. (waw yaow chyo tway
kwahn; I want a refund.)

Chapter 6: Shop ’til You Drop 107
 Wô yào tuì huò. (waw yaow tway hwaw; I would
like to return this.)
 Qîng nî bâ qián jìrù wôde xìnyòng kâ. (cheeng
nee bah chyan jee roo waw duh sheen yoong kah;
Please refund my credit card.)
 Wô néng bùnéng jiàn zôngj∫nglî? (waw nung
boo nung jyan dzoong jeeng lee; May I see the
manager?)
 Qîng nî b≈o qîlái. (cheeng nee baow chee lye;
Please wrap these/this.)
 Duì wô bù hésh√n. (dway waw boo huh shun; It
doesn’t fit me.)
Comparing Quality:
Good, Better, Best
When you want to let loose with a superlative in order
to say something is absolutely the best — or, for that
matter, the worst — always keep this one little word
in mind: zuì (dzway), which means the most (it’s the
equivalent of the suffix -est).
Zuì is a word just waiting for something to follow it;
otherwise it won’t have much meaning. Here are some
superlatives you may need to use from time to time:
 zuì lèi (dzway lay; the most tired)
 zuì màn (dzway mahn; the slowest)
 zuì máng (dzway mahng; the busiest)
 zuì qíguài (dzway chee gwye; the strangest)
 zuì yôumíng (dzway yo meeng; the most
famous)
 zuì yôuqián (dzway yo chyan; the richest)
If you just want to say that something is better than
something else, or “more” something, rather than the
best necessarily, you use the word gèng (guhng)

Chinese Phrases For Dummies 
108
before an adjective. You can consider these the equiv-
alent of the suffix -er. Another word that has the
meaning of more or -er is yìdiân (ee dyan). Although
the term gèng comes before an adjective, the term
yìdiân must appear after it. Instead of saying gèng
kuài (gung kwye; faster), for example, say kuài yìdiân
(kwye ee dyan) to mean faster.
Here are some examples:
 gèng c∂ngmíng (guhng tsoong meeng; smarter)
 gèng guì (guhng gway; more expensive)
 piányi yìdiân (pyan yee ee dyan; cheaper)
 gèng kuài (guhng kwye; faster)
 gèng màn (guhng mahn; slower)
 hâo (how; good)
 gèng hâo (guhng how; better)
 zuì hâo (dzway how; best)
 duân yìdiân (dwahn ee dyan; shorter)
 cháng yìdiân (chahng ee dyan; longer)
 xiâo yìdiân (shyaow ee dyan; smaller)
 dà yìdiân (dah ee dyan; larger)
 gèng piányi (gung pyan yee; cheaper)
When you want to compare people or
objects, you generally put the word bî (bee;
compared to) between two nouns, followed
by an adjective: A bî B (adjective). This
means A is more ____ than B.
Here are a few examples:
 Píngguô bî júzi hâoch∫. (peeng gwaw bee jyew
dzuh how chir; Apples are tastier than oranges.)
 Zhèige fànguâr bî nèige fànguâr guì. (jay guh
fahn gwar bee nay guh fahng gwar gway; This
restaurant is more expensive than that one.)
 T≈bî nî niánq∫ng. (tah bee nee nyan cheeng;
She’s younger than you.) 

Chapter 6: Shop ’til You Drop 109
If instead you want to convey similarity between two
things, use the coverbs g√n (gun) or hé (huh) in
between the two things being compared, followed by
the word yíyàng (ee yahng; the same) and then the
adjective. So if you say A g√n B yíyàng dà (A gun B ee
yahng dah), you’re saying that A and B are equally large
or as big as each other. You can also just say A g√n B
yíyàng, meaning A and B are the same. Here are some
other things you can say with this sentence pattern:
 G√ge hé dìdi yíyàng g≈o. (guh guh huh dee dee
ee yahng gaow; My older brother is as tall as my
younger brother.
 M≈o g√n gôu yíyàng tiáopí. (maow gun go
ee yahng tyaow pee; Cats are just as naughty
as dogs.)
 Wô g√n nî yíyàng dà. (waw gun nee ee yahng
dah; You and I are the same age.)
To make a negative comparison, such as I’m not as tall
as he, use the following sentence pattern:
A méiyôu B nèmme adjective
The means “A is not as (adjective) as B.” You can see
this pattern in action in the following sentences:
 Sh≈yú méiyôu j∫nyú nèmme kê’ài. (shah yew
mayo jeen yew nummah kuh eye; Sharks are not
as cute as goldfish.)
 Y∫ngwén méiyôu Zh∂ngwén nèmme nán. (eeng
one mayo joong one nummah nahn; English is
not as difficult as Chinese.)
 M≈o de wêiba méiyôu tùzi de wêiba nèmme
c∆. (maow duh way bah mayo too dzuh duh way
bah nummah tsoo; Cats’ tails aren’t as thick as
the tails of rabbits.)
Here’s a dialog using comparisons:
Olivia: Zhè jiàn qípáo zênmeyàng? (jay jyan
chee paow dzummah yahng; What do you think
of this traditional Chinese dress?)

Chinese Phrases For Dummies

Lêiléi: Wô juéde hên hâo. (waw jweh duh hun

Olivia: J∫nsède hé hóngde yíyàng guì ma? (jeen

Lêiléi: Méiyôu. J∫nsède bî hóngde piányi.
(mayo. jeen suh duh bee hoong duh pyan yee; No.
The gold one is less expensive than the red one.)
Olivia: Nà, wô jiù mâi j∫nsède. (nah, waw jyoe my

Exploring museums and galleries
Theater shows and live musical performances aren’t
the only forms of entertainment you can see to get
your fill of wénhuà (one hwah; culture). One of the
nicest, calmest activities to do at your own pace is 
to visit a bówùguân (baw woo gwahn; museum) or
huàláng (hwah lahng; gallery). Sometimes the best

Chapter 7: Making Leisure a Top Priority 115
reason to go to a bówùguân is to buy some lîwù (lee

Here are some questions you may want to ask in a
museum or gallery:
 Bówùguân jîdiân zh∂ng k≈imén? (baw woo

Listening to a concert
You often hear that the language of music crosses
international boundaries. If you’re feeling a bit
exhausted after practicing Chinese, you can head
to a concert in the evening where you can relax. Let
the music transport you to another mental space.
At the end of a concert in China, you don’t
hear anyone yelling “Encore!” What you do
hear, however, is “Zài lái yíge, zài lái yíge!”
(dzye lye ee guh, dzye lye ee guh; Bring on
one more!)
Here are some words that may come in handy:
 dàiwèiyuán (dye way ywan; usher)
 g√chàng huì (guh chahng hway; choral recital)
 gûdiân y∫nyuè (goo dyan een yweh; classical
music)
 ji≈oxiâng yuè (jyaow shyahng yweh; symphonic
music)
 jiémùd≈n (jyeh moo dahn; program)
 juéshì y∫nyuè (jyweh shir een yweh; jazz music)
 míng√(meen guh; folk song)
 qì yuè (chee yweh; instrumental music)
 shìnèi yuè (shir nay yweh; chamber music)
 yáogûn yuè (yaow gun yweh; rock ‘n’ roll)
 y∫nyuè huì (een yweh hway; concert)
 Zh∂ngguó gûdiâny∫nyuè (joong gwaw goo dyan
yeen yweh; classical Chinese music)
Hopping around bars and clubs
The following phrases may come in handy when
you’re out exploring the local pubs and dance halls:
 Qîng lái yìpíng píjiû. (cheeng lye ee peeng pee
jyo; Please bring me a bottle of beer.)

Chapter 7: Making Leisure a Top Priority 119
 Nî xiâng g√n wô tiàowû ma? (nee shyahng gun
waw tyaow woo mah; Would you like to dance?)
 Wô néng bùnéng qîng nî h√jiû? (waw nung boo
nung cheeng nee huh jyo; May I get you a drink?)
 Wômen dào nâr qù tiàowû? (waw mun daow
nar chyew tyaow woo; Where can we go to
dance?)
 Yôu méiyôu rùchâng fèi? (yo mayo roo chahng
fay; Is there a cover charge?)
When you go to a bar with friends, you may ask for
some b∫ngzhèn píjiû (beeng juhn pee jyo; cold beer)
or maybe some hóng (hoong; red) or bái (bye; white)
pútáo jiû (poo taow jyo; wine). And don’t forget to ask
for some hu≈sh√ngmî (hwah shung mee; peanuts) or
tûdòupiàn (too doe pyan; potato chips) so you don’t
get too sloshed with all that píjiû.
Naming Your Hobbies
Having at least one yèyú àihào (yeh yew eye how;
hobby) is always good. How about getting involved in
some of the following?
 diàoyú (dyaow yew; fishing)
 guójì xiàngqí (gwaw jee shyahng chee; chess)
 kàn sh∆(kahn shoo; reading)
 niâo (nyaow; birds)
 p√ngtiáo (pung tyaow; cooking)
 p∫ngp≈ngqiú (peeng pahng chyo; Ping Pong) 
 pú kè (poo kuh; cards)
 tàijíquán (tye jee chwan; commonly referred to
just as Tai Ji, a slow form of martial arts)
 yóupiào (yo pyaow; stamps)
 yuányì (ywan ee; gardening)

Chinese Phrases For Dummies 
120
If you want to ask a person what his or her hobby is,
use the following terms.
 Nî huì búhuì dâ tàijíquán? (nee hway boo hway
dah tiye jee chwahn; Do you know how to do
Tai Ji?)
 Nî dâ bùdâ p∫ngp≈ngqiú? (nee dah boo dah
peeng pahng chyo; Do you play Ping Pong?)
 Nî dâ májiàng ma? (nee dah mah jyahng mah;
Do you play mah-jongg?)
Both tàijíquán and májiàng are quintessential
Chinese pastimes. In addition to tàijíquán, everyone
is familiar with other forms of wûshù (woo shoo;
martial arts), including kung fu — a martial art prac-
ticed since the Tang (tahng) dynasty back in the
eighth century. In fact, you can still see kung fu mas-
ters practicing at the Shaolin Temple in Zhengzhou,
Henan Province — one great reason for making a trip
off the beaten path if you ever visit China.
Exploring Nature
If you want to get far from the madding crowds, or
even just far enough away from your bàng∂ngshì
(bahn goong shir; office) to feel refreshed, try going
to one of the seven sacred sh≈n (shahn; mountains)
or a beautiful hâit≈n (hi tahn; beach) to take in the
sh≈nshuî (shahn shway; scenery).
Here are some things you would see along the way if
you were to travel through the Chinese countryside:
 bâotâ (baow tah; pagoda)
 dàomiào (daow meow; Daoist temple)
 dàotián (daow tyan; rice paddies)
 fómiào (faw meow; Buddhist temple)
 kôngmiào (koong meow; Confucian temple)
 miào (meow; temple)
 nóngmín (noong meen; farmers)

Chapter 7: Making Leisure a Top Priority 121
If you’re ever exploring dàzìrán (dah dzuh rahn;
nature) with a friend who speaks Chinese, a few of
these words may come in handy:
 àn (ahn; shore)
 chítáng (chir tahng; pond)
 hâi (hi; ocean)
 hâit≈n (hi tahn; beach)
 hé (huh; river)
 hú (hoo; lake)
 sh≈mò (shah maw; desert)
 sh≈n (shahn; mountains)
 sh≈ndòng (shahn doong; cave)
 xiâo sh≈n (shyaow shahn; hills)
Words to Know
f√ngjîng
fung jeeng
scenery
piàoliàng
pyaow lyahng
beautiful
ti≈ntáng
tyan tahng

To indicate a similarity between two ideas
or objects, use the phrase xiàng . . . yíyàng.
Here are some examples:
 xiàng nî dìdi yíyàng (shyahng nee dee dee ee
yahng; like your younger brother)
 xiàng q∫ngw≈yíyàng (shyahng cheeng wah ee
yahng; like a frog)
 xiàng f√ngzi yíyàng (shyahng fungdzuh ee
yahng; like a crazy person)

Tapping into Your Artistic Side
Okay, now you’re ready to tap into your more sensi-
tive, artistic side in Chinese. Don’t be afraid of
expressing your gânqíng (gahn cheeng; emotions).
The Chinese appreciate sensitivity to their Song
(soong) dynasty sh≈nshuî huà (shahn shway hwah;
landscape painting) or the beauty of a Ming (meeng)
dynasty cíqì (tsuh chee; porcelain).
I bet you have tons of chuàngzàoxìng (chwahng
dzaow sheeng; creativity). If so, try your hand at one
of these fine arts:
 di≈okè (dyaow kuh; sculpting)
 huà (hwah; painting)
 sh∆fâ (shoo fah; calligraphy)
 shuîcâihuà (shway tsye hwah; watercolor)
 sùmiáohuà (soo meow hwah; drawing)
 táoqì (taow chee; pottery)
Like kids all over the world, many Chinese children
take xiâo tíqín (shyaow tee cheen; violin) and
g≈ngqín (gahng cheen; piano) classes — often under
duress. Do you play a yuè qì (yweh chee; musical
instrument)? How about trying your hand (or mouth)
at one of these? 
 chángdí (chahng dee; flute)
 chánghào (chahng how; trombone)
 dà hào (dah how; tuba)
 d≈nhuángguân (dahn hwahng gwan; clarinet)
 dà tíqín (dah tee cheen; cello)
 g≈ngqín (gahng cheen; piano)
 gû (goo; drums)
 lâba (lah bah; trumpet)
 jíta (gee tah; guitar)
 nán d∫y∫n (nahn dee een; double bass)

Chapter 7: Making Leisure a Top Priority 123
 s≈kès∫guân (sah kuh suh gwahn; saxophone)
 shu≈nghuángguân (shwahng hwahng gwan;
oboe)
 shùqín (shoo cheen; harp)
 xiâo tíqín (shyaow tee cheen; violin)
 zh∂ng tíqín (joong tee cheen; viola)
If you’ve heard any traditional Chinese music at a con-
cert or on a CD, you’ve probably heard one of these
Chinese yuè qì (yweh chee; musical instruments) at
one point or another:
 èrhú (are hoo; a two-stringed bowed instrument)
 gûzh√ng (goo juhng; a long, plucked string
instrument that rests on a large stand in front
of you)
 pípa (pee pah; a plucked string instrument with
a fretted fingerboard that sits on your lap)
The Chinese language has a couple of differ-
ent verbs that you can use to indicate the
practice of various instruments. 
 For stringed instruments: Use the verb l≈(lah;
to draw, as in draw a bow). For example, l≈
zh∂ng tíqín (lah joong tee cheen; play the viola).
 For wind instruments: Use chu∫(chway;
to blow).
 For other instruments: Use tán (tahn; play) a
g≈ngqín (gahng cheen; piano).
Getting into Sports
No matter where you go in the world, you’ll find a
national pastime. In the United States, it’s bàngqiú
(bahng chyo; baseball). In most of Europe, it’s zúqiú
(dzoo chyo; soccer). And in China, it’s p∫ngp≈ngqiú
(peeng pahng chyo; Ping Pong). The following are 
popular sports you may encounter.

Chinese Phrases For Dummies 
124
 bàngqiú (bahng chyo; baseball)
 b∫ngqiú (beeng chyo; hockey)
 y∫ngshì zúqiú (eeng shir dzoo chyo; soccer 
(literally: English-style football)
 lánqiú (lahn chyo; basketball)
 lêiqiú (lay chyo; softball)
 páiqiú (pye chyo; volleyball)

 wângqiú (wahng chyo; tennis)
 yûmáoqiú (yew maow chyo; badminton)
 zúqiú (dzoo chyo; football)
Yóuyông (yo yoong; swimming) is also a quite popular
sport. Here are some related words: 
 cè yông (tsuh yoong; side stroke)
 dié yông (dyeh yoong; butterfly stroke)
 w≈yông (wah yoong; breast stroke or frog-style)
 yâng yông (yahng yoong; backstroke)
 yóuyông mào (yo yoong maow; swimming cap)
 zìyóu yông (dzuh yo yoong; freestyle swimming)
Some games require the use of p∫ngp≈ngqiú p≈i
(peeng pahng chyo pye; Ping-Pong paddles); others
require wângqiú p≈i (wahng chyo pye; tennis rackets)
or lánqiú (lahn chyo; basketballs). All games, however,
require a sense of g∂ngpíng jìngzh√ng (goong peeng
jeeng jung; fair play).
Here are some useful phrases to know, whether you’re
an amateur or a professional athlete:
 Wô xiâng qù kàn qiúsài. (waw shyahng chyew
kahn chyo sye; I want to see a ballgame.)
 Bîsài shénme shíhòu k≈ishî? (bee sye shummuh

Picking Up a Telephone
This section gives you all the phrases you need to use
the phone, to call friends as well as work, and to leave
messages.
Telephone basics
Before even going near a diànhuà (dyan hwah; tele-
phone), you may want to become familiar with some
common Chinese words and phrases connected to
using one.
 bênshì diànhuà (bun shir dyan hwah; local call)
 chángtú diànhuà (chahng too dyan hwah; long-
distance call)
 diànhuà hàomâ (dyan hwah how mah; telephone
number)

Chinese Phrases For Dummies 
128
 diànhuàkâ (dyan hwah kah; phone card)
 duìf≈ng fùfèi diànhuà (dway fahng foo fay dyan
hwah; collect call)
 g∂ngyòng diànhuà (goong yoong dyan hwah;

 guójì diànhuà (gwaw jee dyan hwah; interna-
tional phone calls)
 ji√xiànyuán (jyeh shyan ywan; operator)
 shôuj∫(show jee; cell phone)
 wúxiàn diànhuà (woo shyan dyan hwah; cord-
less phone)
Here are some things you can do before, during, or
after your call:
 chá diànhuà hàomâbù (chah dyan hwah how
mah boo; look a number up in a phonebook)
 dâ diànhuà (dah dyan hwah; to make a phone
call)
 ji√diànhuà (jyeh dyan hwah; answer a phone
call)
 guà diànhuà (gwah dyan hwah; hang up)
 huí diànhuà (hway dyan hwah; return a phone
call)
 liú yíge huà (lyo ee guh hwah; leave a message)
 náqî diànhuà (nah chee dyan hwah; pick up the
phone)
 sh∂udào diànhuà (show daow dyan hwah;
receive a phone call)
If you’re like me, you need to ask plenty of basic ques-
tions before you figure out what you’re doing with a
telephone overseas. These questions may come in
handy:
 Zênme dâ diànhuà? (dzummuh dah dyan hwah;
How can I place a phone call?)
 Zài nâr kéyî dâ diànhuà? (dzye nar kuh yee dah
dyan hwah; Where can I make a call?)

Chapter 8: When You Gotta Work 129
 Bênshì diànhuà sh∂ufèi du∂shâo qián? (bun
shir dyan hwah show fay dwaw shaow chyan;
How much is a local phone call?)
The following words may come in handy now that
most people use cell phones and beepers:
 h∆(who; beep)
 h∆j∫(who jee; beeper)
 h∆j∫hàomâ (who jee how mah; beeper number)
 shôuj∫(show jee; cell phone)
 shôuj∫hàomâ (show jee how mah; cell phone
number)
Here are some problems you may encounter while
trying to make a phone call:
 dênghòu (dung ho; be on hold)
 diànhuà huàile (dyan hwah hwye luh; the phone
is broken)
 méi rén ji√diànhuà (may run jyeh dyan hwah;
no one answers)
 méiyôu b∂hàoy∫n (mayo baw how yeen; no dial
tone)
 nî b∂cuò hàomâle (nee baw tswaw how mah
luh; you dialed the wrong number)
 záy∫n (dzah yeen; static)
 zhànxiàn (jahn shyan; the line is busy)
Making a phone call
“Wéi?” (way; hello). You hear this word spoken in the
second (or rising) tone a lot on the other end of the
line when you make a phone call. It’s kind of like test-
ing the waters to see if someone is there. You can
reply with the same word in the fourth (or falling)
tone so it sounds like you’re making a statement, or
you can just get right to asking if the person you want
to speak with is in at the moment. (For more about
the four tones, see Chapter 1.)

Chinese Phrases For Dummies 
130
A phrase you may hear on the other end of the line in
mainland China is “Nî nâr?” (nee nar; literally: where
are you?). It asks what d≈nwèi (dahn way; work unit)
you’re attached to. After these first little questions,
you may finally be ready to ask for the person you
intended to call in the first place.
For decades after Communist rule took over
mainland China in 1949, all Chinese people
were assigned a d≈nwèi, which pretty much
regulated every aspect of one’s life — from
where one lived, when one married, and even
when one had children. Asking about one’s
d≈nwèi is still pretty common when answer-
ing the phone.
Here’s how you might call to talk to a friend: 
Mr. Chéng: Wéi? (way; Hello?)
Margaret: Qîngwèn, Luò Chéng zài ma? (cheeng
one, law chung dzye mah; May I please speak to
Luo Cheng?)
Mr. Chéng: Qîngwèn, nín shì nâ yí wèi? (cheeng
one, neen shir nah ee way; May I ask who’s 
calling?)
Margaret: Wô shì t≈de tóngxué, Margaret. (waw
shir tah duh toong shweh, Margaret; I’m his class-
mate, Margaret.)
Mr. Chéng: Hâo. Sh≈odêng. Wô qù jiào t≈. (how.
shaow dung. waw chyew jyao tah; Okay. Just a
moment. I’ll go get him.)
Calling places of business may be a bit different than
the more informal call to a friend or coworker. When
you call a lybguân (lyew gwahn; hotel), sh≈ngdiàn
(shahng dyan; store), or a particular g∂ngs∫(goong
suh; company), you may be asked what f√nj∫hàomâ
(fun jee how mah; extension) you want. If you don’t
know, you can ask for the same:
Qîngwèn, f√nj∫hàomâ shì du∂shâo? (cheeng
one, fun jee how mah shir dwaw shaow; May I ask
what the extension number is?)

Chapter 8: When You Gotta Work 131
After you figure out the extension, the ji√xiànsh√ng
(jyeh shyan shung; operator) may say
Wô xiànzài jiù gêi nî ji√hào. (waw shyan dzye
jyo gay nee jyeh how; I’ll transfer you now.)
If you finally do get through to an employee’s office
only to discover the person isn’t there, you can
always leave a yôu sh√ng yóujiàn (yo shung yo jyan;
voicemail). When dealing with voicemail, you may
have to deal with the following kinds of instructions
on a recorded message:
 Nín rúguô shîyòng ànjiàn shì diànhuàj∫, qîng
àn 3. (neen roo gwaw shir yoong ahn jyan shir
dyan hwah jee, cheeng ahn sahn; If you have a
touch-tone phone, please press 3 now.)
 Nín rúguô shîyòng xuánzhuân b∂hào j∫, qîng
bié guà. (neen roo gwaw shir yoong shwan jwan
baw how jee, cheeng byeh gwah; If you have a
rotary phone, please stay on the line.)
 Yào huí dào zhû mùlù qîng àn jîngzìhào. (yow
hway dow joo moo loo cheeng ahn jeeng dzuh
how; If you want to return to the main menu,
please press # [pound] now.)
If you want to reach your kèhù (kuh hoo; client) or
your hégûrén (huh goo run; business partner) in
today’s business world, you may want some help
from the mìsh∆(mee shoo; secretary) to connect you
to the person you want to reach:
Jacob: Liú Xiâojiê, zênme ji√wàixiàn? (lyo
shyaow jyeh, dzummuh jyeh wye shyan; Miss Liu,
how can I get an outside line?)
Liú Xiâojiê: Méi wèntí. Wô b≈ng nî dâ zhèige

Checking the answering machine
Because people lead such busy lives, you often have
to liúhuà (lyo hwah; leave a message) on the lùy∫n
diànhuà (loo yeen dyan hwah; answering machine).
Here are some common greetings you may hear if you
reach an answering machine:
 Zhè shì Barry Jones. (jay shir Barry Jones; You
have reached Barry Jones.)
 Wô xiànzài búzài. (waw shyan dzye boo dzye;

When you leave a message on an answering machine,
be sure to leave clear instructions about what you
want the person to do:
 Wô zài dâ diànhuà gêi nî (waw dzye dah dyan

 Nî huí ji≈zh∫hòu qîng dâ diànhuà gêi wô. (nee

 Bié wàngle huí wôde diànhuà. (byeh wahng luh
hway waw duh dyan hwah; Don’t forget to return

If a live person answers and you have to leave a mes-
sage, be polite. Keep these phrases in mind:
 Qîng gàosù t≈wô gêi t≈dâ diànhuà le. (cheeng

Please tell her I called.)
 Máfan nî qîng t≈huí wôde diànhuà. (mah fahn

 Qîng gàosù t≈wô huì wân yìdiâr lái. (cheeng

 Qîng gêi wô zhuân t≈de liúyánj∫? (cheeng gay
waw jwan tah duh lyo yan jee; Could you please
transfer me to his voicemail?)
Heading Off to Work
Time to get down to sh≈ngyè (shahng yeh; business).
Your sh≈ngyè, that is. Want to know how to manage
that job in Jiangsu or how to deal with the head
honcho in Harbin? This section shows you everything
from making a business appointment to conducting a
meeting to checking your e-mail on the fly.
Your office digs
Whether you’re a mìsh∆(mee shoo; secretary) or the
zhûxí (joo she; chairman) of the board, the atmos-
phere and physical environment of your bàng∂ngshì
(bahn goong shir; office) is important.
These days, just about any office you work in or visit
has the following basic items:
 chuánzh√n (chwan jun; fax)
 diànhuà (dyan hwah; telephone)
 diànnâo (dyan now; computer)
 dâyìnj∫(dah een jee; printer)
 fùyìnj∫(foo een jee; copier)

Chapter 8: When You Gotta Work 135
Of course, you first may want to look for the k≈f√ij∫
(kah fay jee; coffee machine), especially in the morn-
ing. In fact, the one part of the day you may look for-
ward to the most is your xi∆xi (shyo she; coffee break).
As you look around your xiâogéji≈n (shyaow guh jyan;
cubicle), I bet you can find all of these items:
 bîjìbên (bee jee bun; notebook)
 dâng’àn (dahng ahn; file)
 dìngsh∆j∫(deeng shoo jee; stapler)
 g≈ngbî (gahng bee; pen)
 huíwénzh√n (hway one jun; paper clip)
 qi≈nbî (chyan bee; pencil)
 ji≈odài (jyaow dye; scotch tape)
 xiàngpíj∫n (shyahng pee jeen; rubberband)
If you can’t find some indispensable item just
when you need it, you can always ask some-
one in the next xiâogéji≈n. The simplest way
to ask is by using the phrase 
Nî yôu méiyôu ____? (nee yo mayo _______? do
you have any _____?)
Use that phrase as often as you like. Just make sure
you can reciprocate whenever your tóngshì (toong
shir; coworker) needs something as well.
 Nî yôu méiyôu g≈ngbî? (nee yo mayo gahng
bee; Do you have a pen?)
 Nî yôu méiyôu dìngsh∆j∫? (nee yo mayo deeng
shoo jee; Do you have a stapler?
Conducting a meeting
Congratulations! You’ve finally set up shop in your
new office in Beijing and are all set to have your first
business meeting on foreign soil. But just what is the
mùdì (moo dee; purpose) of your huìyì (hway ee;

Chinese Phrases For Dummies 
136
meeting)? Is it to yânshì (yan shir; give a presenta-
tion) about a new chânpîn (chahn peen; product)?
Is it to tánpàn (tahn pahn; negotiate) a hétóng (huh
toong; contract)? How about for the purpose of
shòuxùn (show shewn; training) — either you or your
Chinese colleagues? Do you have a specific yìchéng
(ee chung; agenda) in mind already? I hope so. You
definitely don’t want to look unprepared.
Scheduling and planning a meeting
You may be one of those people who needs to ≈npái
huìyì yìchéng (ahn pye hway ee ee chung; schedule
a meeting) just to prepare for another meeting. The
following list includes a few tasks you may need to
do at such a preliminary meeting:
 jiêjué wèntí (jyeh jweh one tee; solve problems)
 tâolùn wèntí (taow lewn one tee; discuss 
problems)
 tuánduì jiànshè (twan dway jyan shuh; team
building)
 zhìdìng huìyì yìchéng (jir deeng hway ee ee
chung; set an agenda)
If you want to make sure everyone has a say in plan-
ning matters, these phrases can help:
 Jack, nî hái yôu shénme x∆yào bûch∂ng ma?
(Jack, nee hi yo shummuh shyew yaow boo
choong mah; Jack, do you have anything else
to add?)
 Wômen x∆yào duì zhèige xiàngmù biâojué
ma? (waw mun shyew yaow dway jay guh
shyahng moo byaow jweh mah; Do we need to
vote on this item?)
 Shéi hái yôu shénme yìjiàn huòzhê wèntí?
(shay hi yo shummuh ee jyan hwaw juh one tee;
Who still has any comments or questions?)

Chapter 8: When You Gotta Work 137
Starting the meeting
When you’re ready to get a business meeting started,
these phrases can be helpful.
 Zâoshàng hâo. (dzaow shahng how; Good 
morning.)
 Hu≈nyíng nín dào wômen de bàng∂ngshì.
(hwahn eeng neen dqow waw mun duh bahn
goong shir; Welcome to our office.)
 Zài k≈ihuì yîqián, ràng wômen zuò zuò zìwô
jièshào. (dzye kye hway ee chyan, rahng waw
mun dzwaw dzwaw dzuh waw jyeh shaow; Before
the meeting begins, let’s introduce ourselves.)
 Wô xiâng jièshào yíxià huìyì de c≈nji≈zhê.
(waw shyahng jyeh shaow ee shyah hway ee duh
tsahn jya juh; I’d like to introduce the conference
participants.)
 Zánmen k≈ishî ba. (dzahn mun kye shir bah;
Let’s begin.)
Always greet the person who holds the high-
est rank first, before saying hello to others.
Hierarchy is important to the Chinese, so try
to always be conscious of this or you may
unintentionally cause someone to “lose face”
by not acknowledging his or her importance
in the overall scheme of things. In order to
follow this protocol, you need to know
people’s titles:
 chângzhâng (chahng jahng; factory director)
 dôngshì (doong shir; director of the board)
 fù zôngcái (foo dzoong tsye; vice president)
 j∫nglî (jeeng lee; manager)
 shôuxí kuàijì (show she kwye jee; chief financial
officer)
 zhûrèn (joo run; director of a department)

Chinese Phrases For Dummies 
138
 zhûxí (joo she; chairman)
 zôngcái (dzoong tsye; president)
 zûzhâng (dzoo jahng; team leader)
In Chinese, last names always come first.
When addressing someone with a title,
always say the last name first, followed by
the title. So if you know someone’s name is
Li Peijie (Li being the surname), and he is the
company director, you would address him as
Lî Zhûrèn (Lee joo run; Director Li).
Making a presentation
When you need to give a presentation during the
meeting, you may want to use these terms:
 bânzi (bahn dzuh; board) and fênbî (fun bee;
chalk)
 biâogé (byaow guh; charts)
 ch≈tú (chah too; illustrations)
 huàbân (hwah bahn; easel) and câibî (tsye bee;
marker)
 túbi≈o (too byaow; diagrams)
 z∫liào (dzuh lyaow; handouts)
Planning to go hi-tech instead? In that case you might
want one of these:
 PowerPoint yânshì (PowerPoint yan shir;
PowerPoint presentation)
 huànd√ngj∫(hwahn dung jee; slide projector)
and píngmù (peeng moo; screen)
 tóu yîng piàn (toe eeng pyan; transparency)
If you plan on videotaping your presentation, you
need a lùxiàngj∫(loo shyahng jee; video recorder). If
the room is pretty big, you may also want to use a
màikèf√ng (my kuh fung; microphone).

Chapter 8: When You Gotta Work 139
Ending the meeting
Here are some phrases that can come in handy at the
meeting’s conclusion:
 Gânxiè dàji≈j∫nti≈n ch∆xí huìyì. (gahn shyeh
dah jyah jeen tyan choo she hway ee; Thank you
everyone for participating in today’s meeting.)
 Wômen x∆yào zài k≈ihuì tâolùn zhè jiàn shìqíng

lwun jay jyan shir cheeng mah; Do we need
another meeting to continue the discussion?)
 Zài lík≈i zh∫qián, wômen bâ xià cì huìyì de rìq∫

Using the Internet
These days you can reach your business partner 
in Beijing in a matter of seconds through diànzî
k∂ngji≈n (dyan dzuh koong jyan; cyberspace). With
shôutí shì (show tee shir; portable) computers and
multiple jiânsuô yînqín (jyan swaw yeen cheen;
search engines), you can jiânsuô guójì wângluò (jyan
swaw gwaw jee wahng lwaw; search the Internet) and
find just about anything.

T
his chapter helps you make your way around the
f√ij∫châng (fay jee chahng; airport), survive the
hâigu≈n (hi gwahn; Customs) experience, and board
different types of ji≈ot∂ng (jyaow toong; transporta-
tion) after you reach your destination. It also shows
you how to ask the occasional bystander for direc-
tions or give them yourself.
On the Move: Types
of Transportation
You need to be able to get around with your language
skills. The following sections give you some basic
phrases to get you on the move.

Chinese Phrases For Dummies 
144
Catching a plane
Ready to bànlî d√ngj∫shôuxù (bahn lee duhng jee show
shyew; check in)? After lugging your bags around, you
finally get to tu∂yùn (twaw yewn; check) your xíngli
(sheeng lee; luggage). You receive a d√ngj∫pái (duhng
jee pye; boarding pass) at the check-in counter, at
which point you’re ready to make your way to the
appropriate ch∆kôu (choo ko; gate), taking only your
shôutí xíngli (show tee sheeng lee; carry-on luggage).
All sorts of questions may be running through your
mind about now. Here are some basic phrases that
may come in handy during check in:
 Wô xiâng yào kào guòdào de wèizi. (waw
shyahng yaow cow gwaw daow duh way dzuh;
I’d like an aisle seat.)
 Wô xiâng yào kào chu≈ng de wèizi. (waw

 Zài jî hào mén hòuj∫? (dzye jee how mun ho jee;

The following conversation can help you with phrases
you may encounter when getting on a plane:
Zhíyuán: Nín hâo. Qîng ch∆shì nínde j∫piào.
(neen how. cheeng choo shir neen duh jee pyaow;

(jeeng jee tsahng; economy class) the whole time?
Either way, here are some people you see get on the
plane before you:
 chéngwùyuán (chung woo ywan; flight 
attendants)
 jiàshîyuán (jyah shih ywan; pilot)
 j∫zû (jee dzoo; crew)
And if you’re like me, you get worried about some
things as the plane begins to taxi down the runway:
 qîf√i (chee fay; take off)
 qìliú (chee lyo; turbulence)
 zhuólù (jwaw loo; landing)
You may also hear the chéngwùyuán say the follow-
ing instructions:
 Jìjîn nîde ≈nquándài. (jee jin nee duh ahn
chwan dye; Fasten your seat belt.)
 Bù zhûn ch∂uy≈n. (boo jwun cho yan; No smok-
ing permitted.)
 Bâ zuòyî kàobèi fàngzhí. (bah dzwaw ee cow

 Bâ tu∂pán c≈nzhu∂sh∂u qîlái. (bah twaw

 Rúguô k∂ngqì y≈lì yôu biànhuà, yângqìzhào
huì zìdòng luòxià. (roo gwaw koong chee yah
lee yo byan hwah, yahng chee jaow hway dzuh
doong lwaw shyah; If there’s any change in air
pressure, the oxygen mask will automatically
drop down.)
If you’re not a nervous flyer, you’ll probably spend
all your time listening to y∫nyuè (een yweh; music)
through the êrj∫(are jee; headset), flipping píndào
(peen daow; dials) on the radio or diànshì tái (dyan

Chinese Phrases For Dummies

shir tye; channels) on the television, or trying to
shuìjiào (shway jyaow; sleep). I hope the flight is
showing a good diànyîng (dyan yeeng; movie) on
such a long trip. 
If things are going a little slow, you may use these
phrases:
 Qîng wèn, wômen de f√ij∫huì búhuì zhèngdiân
qîf√i? (cheeng one, waw mun duh fay jee hway
boo hway juhng dyan chee fay; Excuse me, but

Hailing a cab
Renting a car in China is virtually impossible,
so take a taxi and relax. Let the driver worry
about how to get you from point A to point B.
Here’s what you say to the hotel door atten-
dant if you want help hailing a cab:
Wô yào jiào j∫chéngch√. (waw yaow jyaow jee
chung chuh; I would like a taxi.)

Chapter 9: I Get Around: Transportation 149
You can also say
Wô yào jiào ch∆z∆ch√. (waw yaow jyaow choo
dzoo chuh; I would like a taxi.)
The two methods are interchangeable, just like saying
“taxi” or “cab.”
After you’re safely in the cab, you need to know how
to say the following phrases:
 Qîng dài wô dào zhèige dìzhî. (cheeng dye waw
daow jay guh dee jir; Please take me to this
address.)
 Qîng dâ biâo. (cheeng dah byaow; Please turn
on the meter.)
 Qîng k≈i màn yìdiâr. (cheeng kye mahn ee dyar;
Please drive a little slower.)
 Qîng k≈i kuài yìdiâr. (cheeng kye kwye ee dyar;
Please drive a little faster.)
 Wô dêi gân shíji≈n. (waw day gahn shir jyan; I’m
in a hurry.)
 Qîng zôu f√ngjîng hâo de lù. (cheeng dzoe fung
jeeng how duh loo; Please take a scenic route.)
 Zài zhèr guâi w≈r. (dzye jar gwye wahr;
Turn here.)
 Nî kéyî dêng jî f√n zh∂ng ma? (nee kuh yee
duhng jee fun joong mah; Can you wait a few
minutes?)
Oh, and one more thing. As you ch∆f≈(choo fah; set
off) with your taxi s∫j∫(suh jee; driver), make sure you
put on your ≈nquándài (ahn chwan dye; seat belt).
Finally, before you get out of the cab, these phrases
may come in handy for price negotiations:
 Wô g≈i gêi nî du∂shâo qián? (waw guy gay nee
dwaw shaow chyan; How much do I owe you?)
 Wô huì àn biâo fù kuân. (waw hway ahn byaow
foo kwahn; I’ll pay what the meter says.)

 Bié q∫piàn wô. (byeh chee pyan waw; Don’t

 K≈i wán xiào! Wô jùjué fù zhèmme du∂qián.
(kye wahn shyaow! waw jyew jweh foo juhmmah

Riding the rails
If you want to get where you need to go really
quickly, especially in Hong Kong, the fastest way
is the dìtiê (dee tyeh; subway). Hong Kong’s dìtiê
zbàn (dee tyeh jahn; subway stations) are pretty
easy to navigate.
Unlike in Hong Kong, the subway system in mainland
China is relatively new, and you only find stations
in less than a handful of cities. Aboveground huôch√
(hwaw chuh; train) travel, however, is tried and true.
You can find plenty of huôch√zhàn (hwaw chuh
jahn; train stations) in China. They even come
equipped with hòuch√shì (ho chuh shir; waiting
rooms).
If you plan to travel a long distance, be sure to
book a ruânwò (rwan waw; soft sleeper) for such
occasions — or at least ask for a ruânzuò (rwan
dzwaw; soft seat). Table 9-1 gives you the goods on
the types of seats in trains.

Before you shàngch√(shahng chuh; board the train),
you need to go to the shòupiàochù (show pyaow
choo; ticket office) to buy your piào (pyaow; ticket).
You use the following words and phrases to get the
job done:
 d≈nchéngpiào (dahn chuhng pyaow; one-way
ticket)
 láihuípiào (lye hway pyaow; roundtrip ticket)
 mànch√(mahn chuh; local train)
 piào (pyaow; ticket)
 piàojià (pyaow jyah; fare)
 shòupiàochù (show pyaow choo; ticket office)
 tèkuài (tuh kwye; express train)
The following questions may come in handy at the
train station:
 Piàofáng zài nâr? (pyaow fahng dzye nar;
Where’s the ticket office?)
Notice the different way of saying ticket office in
this question. Options abound in the Chinese
language.
 Wô yào yìzh≈ng yìngwò piào. (waw yow ee

ticket.)
 Huôch√cóng nêige zhàntái k≈i? (hwaw chuh
tsoong nay guh jahn tye kye; Which gate does the
train leave from?)
And when you finally hear the lièch√yuán (lyeh chuh
ywan; conductor) say “Shàng ch√le!” (shahng chuh
luh; All aboard!), you can board and ask the following
questions:
 Zhèige zuòwèi yôu rén ma? (jay guh dzwaw

 C≈nch√zài nâr? (tsahn chuh dzye nar; Where’s

Asking for Directions
Everyone (yes, even you) has to ask for f≈ngxiàng
(fahng shyahng; directions) at some time or another.
This section helps you figure out exactly how to
ask for directions before you ever mílù (mee loo;
get lost). 

Chapter 9: I Get Around: Transportation 157
Avoiding 20 questions:
Just ask “where”
The easiest way to ask where something is in
Chinese is to use the question word nâr
(nar). It means “where.” But you can’t just
say nâr, or folks still won’t know what you’re
talking about. You have to use the coverb zài
(dzye) in front of nâr (zài nâr), which can be
translated as “in” or “at.” Just put the name
of whatever you’re looking for before the
word zài to create a complete question:
 Yóujú zài nâr? (yo jyew dzye nar; Where’s the
post office?)
 Sh∆diàn zài nâr? (shoo dyan dzye nar; Where’s
the bookstore?)
 Nî zài nâr? (nee dzye nar; Where are you?)
Here are some more places you may be looking for
when you lose your way:
 cèsuô (tsuh swaw; bathroom)
 ch∆z∆qìch√zhàn (choo dzoo chee chuh jahn;
taxi stand)
 dìtiêzhàn (dee tyeh jahn; subway station)
 fànguân (fahn gwahn; restaurant)
 g∂nggòngqìch√zhàn (goong goong chee chuh
jahn; bus stop)
 huôch√zhàn (hwaw chuh jahn; train station)
 jízhênshì (jee juhn shir; emergency room)
 Mêiguó Dàshîguân (may gwaw dah shir gwahn;
American Embassy)
 piàofáng (pyaow fahng; ticket office)
 xuéxiào (shweh shyaow; school)
 yínháng (een hahng; bank)

Chinese Phrases For Dummies 
158
When you travel in unknown areas, you may need to
determine whether you can walk or if you need to
take a g∂nggòng qìch√(goong goong chee chuh; bus)
or ch∆z∆qìch√(choo dzoo chee chuh; taxi) to reach
your destination:
 Hên jìn ma? (hun jeen mah; Is it near?)
 Hên yuân ma? (hun ywan mah; Is it far?)
The word nâr spoken with a third (low falling
and then rising) tone means “where,” but the
same word said with a fourth (falling) tone,
nàr, means “there,” so be particularly careful
which tone you use when you ask for direc-
tions. The person you ask may think you’re
making a statement, not asking a question.
(See Chapter 1 for more on tones.)

Getting direction about directions
Knowing how to ask where you can find a particular
place is the first step, but you also need to know how
to get there. Here’s the simplest way to find out:
Qù . . . . zênme zôu? (chyew dzummuh dzoe;
How do I get to______?)

Chapter 9: I Get Around: Transportation 159
Here are some examples of how to use this question
pattern:
 Qù f√ij∫châng zênme zôu? (chyew fay jee
chahng dzummuh dzoe; How do I get to the 
airport?)
 Qù túsh∆guân zênme zôu? (chyew too shoo
gwahn dzummuh dzoe; How do I get to the
library?)
 Qù xuéxiào zênme zôu? (chyew shweh shyaow
dzummuh dzoe; How do I get to the school?)
Answering “where” questions
Short of using international sign language with a pan-
tomime act, you may want to get a handle on some
basic terms that indicate direction and location. Read
on for a quick list:
 yòu (yo; right)
 zuô (dzwaw; left)
 qián (chyan; front)
 hòu (ho; back)
 lî (lee; inside)
 wài (why; outside)
 shàng (shahng; above)
 xià (shyah; below)
 duìmiàn (dway myan; opposite)
 kàojìn (kaow jeen; next to)
If you plan to indicate that something is
inside, outside, above, below, in front of, or
behind something else, you can use three dif-
ferent completely interchangeable word end-
ings with any of the location words:
 biàn (byan)
 mi≈n (myan)
 tóu (toe)

Chinese Phrases For Dummies 
160
So, for example, if you want to say that the dog is out-
side, you can say it in any of the following ways:
 Gôu zài wàimiàn. (go dzye why myan; The dog
is outside.)
 Gôu zài wàibi≈n. (go dzye why byan; The dog is
outside.)
 Gôu zài wàitóu. (go dzye why toe; The dog is
outside.)

Giving directions
Knowing how to give directions comes in handy when
you think the taxi driver is about to take you for a
ride (figuratively, that is) because he figures you don’t
know your way around town.
If you really do know your way around the city, you
use the following words to instruct the taxi driver
which way you want to go:

Chapter 9: I Get Around: Transportation 161
 dìxiàdào (dee shyah daow; underpass)
 g≈osùg∂nglù (gaow soo goong loo; freeway)
 g∂nglù (goong loo; highway)
 guâijiâo (gwye jyaow; corner)
 lù (loo; road)
 qiáo (chyaow; bridge)
 ti≈nqiáo (tyan chyaow; overpass)
 xiàngzi (shyahng dzuh; alley or lane)
Wherever you want to go, you need to know a few key
verbs to instruct the cab driver:
 guò (gwaw; to pass)
 shàng (shahng; to go up)
 xià (shyah; to go down)
 yòu zhuân (yo jwan; turn right)
 zuô zhuân (dzwaw jwan; turn left)
 zhí zôu (jir dzoe; go straight ahead)
 zhuân w≈n (jwan wahn; turn around)
If you don’t know an exact location, you can also
convey less specific details:
 fùjìn (foo jeen; near)
 sìzh∂u (suh joe; around)
Expressing distances with lí
To indicate the distance from one place to another, you
need to use the “distance from” coverb “lí” (lee). The
general sentence pattern looks something like this:
Place word + lí + place word + description of the
distance

Chinese Phrases For Dummies 
162
For example:
 G∂ngyuán lí túsh∆guân hên jìn. (goong ywan
lee too shoo gwan hun jeen; The park is very
close to the library.)
 Wô ji≈lí nî ji≈tîng yuân. (waw jyah lee nee
jyah teeng ywan; My home is really far from
your home.)
If you want to specify exactly how far one place is
from another, you use the number of lî (lee; the
Chinese equivalent of a kilometer) followed by the
word lî and then the word lù (loo; literally: road).
Whether you say sì lî lù (suh lee loo; 4 kilometers),
b≈lî lù (bah lee loo; 8 kilometers), or èrshís≈n lî lù
(are shir sahn lee loo; 23 kilometers), people know
the exact distance when you use this pattern. You
also have to use the word yôu (yo; to have) before
the number of kilometers. If the answer includes an
adjectival verb such as yuân (ywan; far) or jìn (jin;
close) rather than a numerical distance, however,
you don’t need to specify the number of kilometers
or use the word yôu.
Check out the following samples questions and
answers that use these new patterns:
 G∂ngyuán lí túsh∆guân du∂me yuân? (goong
ywan lee too shoo gwahn dwaw mah ywan; How
far is the park from the library?)
 G∂ngyuán lí túsh∆guân yôu b≈lî lù. (goong
ywan lee too shoo gwahn yo bah lee loo; The
park is eight kilometers from the library.)
 Yínháng lí nî ji≈du∂me jìn? (een hahng lee nee
jyah dwaw mah jin; How close is the bank from
your home?)
 Hên jìn. Zhî yì lî lù. (hun jin. jir ee lee loo; Very
close. Just one kilometer.)

Chapter 9: I Get Around: Transportation 163
You may have some other questions when you inquire
about locations and distances:
 Yào du∂cháng shíji≈n? (yaow dwaw chahng
shir jyan; How long will it take?)
 Zôu de dào ma? (dzoe duh daow mah; Can I
walk there?)
 Zôu de dào, zôu bú dào? (dzoe duh daow, dzoe
boo daow; Can one walk there?)
Specifying cardinal points 
with directional coverbs
You can tell someone to go yòu (yo; right) or zuô
(dzwaw; left) until you’re blue in the face, but some-
times the best way to give people directions is to
point them the right way with the cardinal points:
north, south, east, or west.
In Chinese, however, you say them in this order:
 bêi (bay; north)
 d∂ng (doong; east)
 nán (nahn; south)
 x∫(she; west)
To give more precise directions, you may have to use
the following:
 d∂ng bêi (doong bay; northeast)
 d∂ng nán (doong nahn; southeast)
 x∫bêi (she bay; northwest)
 x∫nán (she nahn; southwest)
When indicating north, south, east, west, left,
or right, you can use either -bi≈n (byan) or 
-miàn (myan) as word endings, but not -tóu
(toe), which you can use with other position
words such as front, back, inside, and outside.

Chinese Phrases For Dummies 
164
Giving directions often entails multiple
instructions. You can’t always say “make a
right and you’re there” or “go straight and
you’ll see it right in front of you.” Sometimes
you have to use a common Chinese pattern
for giving multiple directions. That pattern is
xi≈n + Verb #1, zài + Verb #2
This translates into “first you do X, and then you do
Y.” Here are some examples:
 Xi≈n wàng d∂ng zôu, zài wàng yòu zhuân.
(shyan wahng doong dzoe, dzye wahng yo jwan;
First walk east, and then turn right.)
 Xi≈n zhí zôu, zài wàng x∫zôu. (shyan jir dzoe,
dzye wahng she dzoe; First go straight, and then
turn west.)
Here’s an example conversation:
George: Qîng wèn. Shànghâi bówùguân lí zhèr
hên yuân ma? (cheeng one. shahng hi baw woo
gwahn lee jar hun ywan mah; Excuse me. Is the
Shanghai Museum very far from here?)
Stranger: Bù yuân. Shànghâi bówùguân jiù zài

George: Rénmín dà dào lí zhèr du∂me yuân?
(run meen dah daow lee jar dwaw mah ywan;
How far is the Avenue of the People from here?)
Stranger: Rénmín dà dào lí zhèr zhî yôu y∫lî lù

(tsoong jar dzoe duh daow, dzoe boo daow; Can I

Making a Room Reservation
Are you thinking of yùdìng (yew deeng; reserving) a
hotel fángji≈n (fahng jyan; room)? What kind do you
want? A d≈nrén fángji≈n (dahn run fahng jyan; single
room) all for yourself? A shu≈ngrén fángji≈n (shwahng

someone? Or perhaps a penthouse tàoji≈n (taow jyan;
suite) for a special occasion like your 50th wedding
zh∂unián (joe nyan; anniversary)?

The coverb hé (huh; and), along with the
noun that always follows it, precedes the
main verb or adjective of a sentence. Some
synonyms of hé are g√n (gun), yû (yew), and
tóng (toong), although tóng translates more
closely to “with.”
Checking In Before
You Hit the Pool
Aaahhh, Yàzh∂u (yah joe; Asia)! Its allure often begins
as soon as you pull up to the front entrance and walk
through the hotel door. You may even find yourself
mysteriously lingering a bit in the dàt∫ng (dah teeng;
lobby), visually casing the joint long enough to take
in all sorts of amenities. The luxuries at your disposal
may include the following:
 diànshì (dyan shir; television)
 g≈nxî fúwù (gahn she foo woo; dry cleaning)
 huíy≈ànm∂chí (hway yah ahn maw chir; hot tub)
 lhguân fàndiàn (lyew gwahn fahn dyan; hotel
restaurant)
 sh≈ngwù zh∂ngx∫n (shahng woo joong sheen;
business center)

171
 tîyùguân (tee yew gwahn; gym)
 yóuyôngchí (yo yoong chir; swimming pool)
Before you can take advantage of these conveniences,
however, you have to officially bànlî rùzhù shôuxù
(bahn lee roo joo show shyew; check in). You don’t
want to be caught red handed running in the tîyùguân
or relaxing in the huíy≈ànm∂chí unless you’re a bona
fide guest, right? 
When you walk up to the fàndiàn qiántái (fahn dyan
chyan tye; reception desk), you’ll invariably find your-
self needing to say one of the following sentences:
 Wô yîj∫ng yùdìng le fángji≈n. (waw ee jeeng
yew deeng luh fahng jyan; I already made a 
reservation.)
 Wô méiyôu yùdìng fángji≈n. (waw mayo yew
deeng fahng jyan; I don’t have a reservation.)
 Nîmen hái yôu fángji≈n ma? (nee mun hi yo
fahng jyan mah; Do you have any rooms 
available?)
If you’re in luck, the hotel will have at least one k∂ng
(koong; empty, vacant) fángji≈n (fahng jyan; room). If
the hotel has no available space, you’ll hear 
Duìbùqî, wômen kèmân le. (dway boo chee,
waw mun kuh mahn luh; Sorry, there are no
vacancies/we’re full.) 
In this case, you may need these phrases:
 Z≈og≈o! Nî néng bù néng tu∫jiàn biéde lhguân?
(dzaow gaow. nee nung boo nung tway jyan byeh
duh lyew gwahn; Rats! Could you perhaps rec-
ommend another hotel then?)
 Kéyî. Gébì de lhguân yôu k∂ng fángji≈n. Nî zuì
hâo zôu guò qù shì shì kàn. (kuh yee. guh bee
duh lyew gwahn yo koong fahng jyan. nee dzway
how dzoe gwaw chyew shir shir kahn; Yes. The
hotel next door has vacancies. You may as well
walk over there and have a look.)

The qiántái fúwùyuán (chyan tye foo woo ywan; front
desk clerk) will ask you to tián (tyan; fill out) a couple
of biâo (byaow; forms) to book your room, so have a
g≈ngbî (gahng bee; pen) and some form of zhèngjiàn
(juhng jyan; ID) ready — especially your hùzhào (hoo
jaow; passport). Voilà! You’re officially a hotel kèrén
(kuh run; guest).
After you successfully manage to check in, a
xínglîyuán (sheeng lee ywan; porter/bell boy) immedi-
ately appears to help take your xínglî (sheeng lee; lug-
gage) to your fángji≈n. After he lets you in, he’ll give
you the yàoshi (yaow shir; key) if you didn’t get it from
the qiántái fúwùyuán downstairs.
Now you can finally xi∆xi (shyo she; take a rest) and
maybe fall asleep. Before you do, however, you may
want to put in for a wake-up call. All you have to say is
Qîng nî jiào wô qîchuáng. (cheeng nee jyaow
waw chee chwahng; literally: Please call me to get
out of bed.)

Taking Advantage
of Hotel Service
You’re finally ensconced in your big, beautiful hotel
room when you discover that the mén suô bú shàng
(mun swaw boo shahng; door doesn’t lock) and the
k∂ngtiáo huài le (koong tyaow hwye luh; air condi-
tioning doesn’t work). To make matters worse, your
chu≈nghu dâ bù k≈i (chwahng hoo dah boo kye;
window won’t open). Heat wave! It may be hard to
believe, but in addition to all that, your mâtông
dûzhùle (mah toong doo joo luh; toilet is clogged).
Time to call the nearest kèfáng fúwùyuán (kuh fahng
foo woo ywan; hotel housekeeper) and ask for help.
You may want the kèfáng fúwùyuán to sòng (soong;
send) the following items right over:
 chu∫f√ngj∫(chway fung jee; hair dryer)
 máoj∫n (maow jeen; towel)
 máotân (maow tahn; blanket)
 wèish√ngzhî (way shung jir; toilet paper)
 zhêntóu (jun toe; pillow)
Quickly call if the following pieces of equipment are
huàile (hwye luh; broken) and need immediate fixing:
 ch≈zuò (chah dzwaw; electric outlet)
 k≈igu≈n (kye gwahn; light switch)
 k∂ngtiáo (koong tyaow; air conditioner)
 mâtông (mah toong; toilet)
 nuânqì (nwan chee; heater)
 yáokòng qì (yaow koong chee; remote control)
Maybe you just need someone to dâsâo fángji≈n (dah
saow fahng jyan; clean the room). Oh well. Even the
best hotels need some tweaking every now and then.

You interact with many different employees on any
given hotel stay:
 fúwùtái j∫nglî (foo woo tye jeeng lee; concierge)
 fúwùyuán (foo woo ywan; attendant)
 fúwùyuán lîngb≈n (foo woo ywan leeng bahn;
bell captain)
 zhùlî j∫nglî (joo lee jeeng lee; assistant manager)
 zôngj∫nglî (dzoong jeeng lee; general manager)
Before you decide to order room service, however, just
remember that it’s often guì liâng bèi (gway lyahng bay;
twice as expensive) as dining in the lhguân fàndiàn
(lyew gwahn fahn dyan; hotel restaurant), because the
service is more f≈ngbiàn (fahng byan; convenient).
Here’s a practice conversation:
Housekeeper: Kèfáng fúwùyuán! (kuh fahng foo
woo ywan; Housekeeping!)
David: Qîng jìn! (cheeng jin; Come on in!)
Housekeeper: Yôu shénme wèntí? (yo shummuh
one tee; What seems to be the trouble?)
David: Zhèige shuîlóngtóu huàile. Yê méiyôu
rèshuî. (jay guh shway loong toe hwye luh. yeah
mayo ruh shway; This faucet is broken. There’s
also no hot water.)
Housekeeper: Hên duìbùqî. Mâshàng sòng
shuînuâng∂ng guòlái kànkàn. (hun dway boo
chee. mah shahng soong shway nwan goong gwaw
lye kahn kahn; I’m so sorry. We’ll send a plumber
right away to have a look.)
David: Xiâojiê, nîmen yôu méiyôu xîy∫fúwù?
(shyaow jyeh, nee men yo mayo she ee foo woo;
Miss, do you have any laundry service?)
Housekeeper: Yôu. (yo; Yes we do.)
David: Hâo jíle. J∫nti≈n kêyî bâ zhè xi√y∫fú xî
hâo ma? (how jee luh. jin tyan kuh yee bah jay
shyeh ee foo she how mah; Great. Can I have
these clothes cleaned today?)

175
To make a comparison by saying that some-
thing is a number of times more expensive
than something else, you first use the word
guì (gway; expensive), followed by the
number of times you think it’s more expen-
sive and the word bèi (bay; roughly trans-
lated as “times”). You can compare the
relative cost of two products or services by
using the word bî (bee; compared to) in the
following pattern:
X bî Y guì # bèi
Here are some examples:
 Zuò ch∆z∆ch√bî zuò g∂nggòng qìch√guì wû
bèi. (zwaw choo dzoo chuh bee dzwaw goong
goong chee chuh gway woo bay; Taking a cab is
five times more expensive than taking the bus.)
 Zhèitiáo qúnzi bî nèige guì shí bèi. (jay tyaow
chwun dzuh bee nay guh gway shir bay; This skirt
is ten times more expensive than that one.)
Every hotel room in China has a large flask of
boiling water that you can use to make tea or
for drinking water. Never drink directly from
the tap. You can brush your teeth with tap
water because you just spit it out. Local
Chinese don’t dare drink the tap water either,
so you’re in good company.

Dealing with
Emergencies
In This Chapter
 Yelling for help
 Visiting your doctor
 Going to the authorities
 Looking for legal advice
T
his chapter gives you the language tools you need
to communicate your problems during your times
of need — whether you need a doctor, the police, or
an attorney.
Calling for Help in Times of Need
When you’re faced with an emergency, you don’t want
to waste your time searching for an oversized
Chinese-English dictionary to figure out how to
quickly call for help. Try memorizing these phrases
before a situation arises:
 Jiù mìng! (jyo meeng; Help; Save me!)
 Zhu≈zéi! (jwah dzay; Stop, thief!)
 Zháohuô la! (jaow hwaw lah; Fire!)
 Jiào jiùhùch√! (jyaow jyo hoo chuh; Call an
ambulance!)
 Jiào jîngchá! (jyaow jeeng chah; Call the police!)

Chinese Phrases For Dummies 
180
Be careful when you say the words jiào
(jyaow; to call) and jiù (jyo; to save) in the
previous phrases. You don’t want to mistak-
enly ask someone to save the police when
you want him to call the police.
Sometimes you have to ask for someone who speaks
English. Here are some phrases you can quickly blurt
out during emergencies:
 Nî shu∂Y∫ngwén ma? (nee shwaw eeng one
mah; Do you speak English?)
 Wô x∆yào yíge jiâng Y∫ngwén de lfsh∫. (waw
shyew yaow ee guh jyahng eeng one duh lyew
shir; I need a lawyer who speaks English.)
 Yôu méiyôu jiâng Y∫ngwén de dàif u? (yo mayo
jyahng eeng one duh dye foo; Are there any
English-speaking doctors?)
When you finally get someone on the phone who can
help you, you need to know what to say to get imme-
diate help:
 Wô bèi rén qiâng le. (waw bay run chyahng luh;
I’ve been robbed.)
 Yôu rén shòu sh≈ng le. (yo run show shahng luh;
People are injured.)
 Wô yào huì bào yíge ch√huò. (waw yaow hway
baow ee guh chuh hwaw; I’d like to report a car
accident.)
Receiving Medical Care
If you suddenly find yourself in the y∫yuàn (ee ywan;
hospital) or otherwise visiting an y∫sh√ng (ee shung;
doctor), you need to explain what ails you — often in
a hurry. Use Table 11-1 to figure out how to say the
basic body parts.

Finding a doctor
If your yùnqì (yewn chee; luck) is good, you’ll never
need to use any of the phrases I present in this chap-
ter. If you end up running dâoméi (daow may; out of
luck), however, keep reading. Even if you’ve never
ch∂uy≈n (cho yan; smoked) a day in your life, you 
can still develop késòu (kuh so; a cough) or even
qìguânyán (chee gwahn yan; bronchitis). Time to see
an y∫sh√ng (ee shung; doctor). The following is a
sample dialog between a nurse and patient.
Nurse: Nî zênme bùsh∆fu? (nee dzummah boo

Patient: Wô gânjué bùsh∆f u kêshì bù zh∫dào wô

Making a diagnosis
You may have heard stories about how doctors who
use traditional medical techniques from ancient cul-
tures can just take one look at a person and immedi-
ately know what ails him or her. The truth is, aside
from simple colds and the flu, most doctors still need
to take all kinds of tests to give a proper diagnosis.
They may even need to perform the following tasks:
 huà yàn (hwah yan; lab tests)
 x∫ndiàntú (shin dyan too; electrocardiogram)
 huàyàn yíxià xiâobiàn (hwah yan ee shyah
shyaow byan; have your urine tested)
Here are some other phrases you may hear:
 Nîde tîw√n zhèngcháng. (nee duh tee one juhng
chahng; Your temperature is normal.)
 Kêyî chuánrân ma? (kuh yee chwahn rahn mah;
Is it contagious?)

Chapter 11: Dealing with Emergencies 187
 Yánzhòng ma? (yan joong mah; Is it serious?)
 T≈dêi zài chuángshàng tâng du∂jiû? (tah day
dzye chwahng shahng tahng dwaw jyo; How long
must she rest in bed?)
When you give approximate numbers or
amounts, you don’t need to use the word “or
(huò zhe),” as in “three or four days.” Just
say the numbers right after each other to
automatically imply the “or.” For example,
wû liù ge rén (woo lyo guh run) means five
or six people, and sì wû ti≈n (suh woo tyan)
means four or five days.

medicine) to make you feel better. After you ná (nah;

following instructions on the bottle:

(neen nung boo nung gay waw jwah jay guh

Calling the Police
Have you ever had your pocketbook t∂u le (toe luh;
stolen)? Being a victim is an awful feeling, and I know
from personal experience. You feel sh√ngqì (shung
chee; angry) at such a kêpà (kuh pah; scary) experi-
ence, especially if it happens in another country and
the zéi (dzay; thief) táopâo (taow paow; escapes)
quickly.
You always need to be prepared with some key words
you can use when the jîngchá (jeeng chah; police)
finally pull up in the jîngch√(jeeng chuh; police car)
and take you back to the jîngchájú (jeeng chah jyew;

police station) to identify a potential zéi. Hopefully
the culprit will be zhu≈zháo le (jwah jaow luh;
arrested).
You may also find yourself in an emergency that 
doesn’t involve you. If you ever witness an accident,
here are some phrases you can relay to the police or
emergency workers:
 T≈bèi qìch√yà zháo le. (tah bay chee chuh yah
jaow luh; He was run over by a car.)
 T≈zài liúxiê. (tah dzye lyo shyeh; He’s bleeding.)
 Bié k∆. Jîngchá hé jiùhùch√láile. (byeh koo.
jeeng chah huh jyo hoo chuh lye luh; Don’t cry.
The police and the ambulance have arrived.)
Acquiring Legal Help
Nine out of ten foreigners never need to look for a
lawyer during a stay in China, which isn’t as litigious a
society as the United States, to be sure. If you do need
a lfsh∫(lyew shir; lawyer), however, your best bet is
to check with your country’s dàshîguân (dah shir
gwahn; embassy) or lînshìguân (leen shir gwahn;
consulate) for advice.
It can be very máf an (mah fun; annoying) and stress-
ful to have to deal with lfsh∫, no matter what country
you’re in, but you have to admit — they do know the
fâlf (fah lyew; law). And if you have to go to fâyuàn
(fah ywan; court) for any serious shìjiàn (shir jyan;
incident), you want the judge to pànjué (pahn jweh;
make a decision) in your favor. Moral of the story:
Good lfsh∫are worth their weight in j∫n (gin; gold),
even if you still consider them sh≈yú (shah yew;
sharks) in the end.

Ten Favorite Chinese
Expressions
T
his chapter offers some idiomatic expressions
that make you sound like a native. You hear these
expressions all the time in typical daily situations.
G∂ngxî G∂ngxî
goong she goong she; Congratulations!
You say g∂ngxî g∂ngxî for happy occasions when
congratulations are in order.
“My wife just had a baby!” your friend says. “Wow! 
I didn’t even know she was pregnant,” you say.
“G∂ngxî g∂ngxî!”
Hey! You just turned 21. Now you can finally go to a
bar. G∂ngxî g∂ngxî! Let’s go!
On the Chinese New Year, you hear not only
“g∂ngxî g∂ngxî,” but also “g∂ngxî f≈cái”
(goong she fah tsye), which means
“Congratulations and may you prosper.”
Yí Lù Píng’≈n
ee loo peeng ahn; Bon Voyage! Have a good trip.

Chinese Phrases For Dummies 
192
This phrase is great to use when a friend or acquain-
tance is about to embark on a long journey. When you
see someone off at the airport, you hear many people
say this phrase. You may want to teach your family
and friends yí lù píng’≈n before you board the plane!
Yì Yán Nán Jìn
ee yan nahn jeen; It’s a long story.
Maybe someone wants to know how you got that
black eye. Maybe you don’t really want to go into the
details. Just say yì yán nán jìn to save the blow-by-
blow description for when you’re ready.
Mâmâ H∆h∆
mah mah hoo hoo; So-so
The phrase mâmâ h∆h∆literally means “horse horse
tiger tiger.” You use this expression when you want to
indicate a situation is just okay or mediocre.
K≈i Wán Xiào
kye (rhymes with pie) wahn shyaow; Just kid-
ding, or You’ve got to be kidding!
You say k≈i wán xiào when you can’t believe your
ears. Suppose your coworker just told you she’s been
fired, even though she was promoted only a month
ago. That definitely calls for a k≈i wán xiào in
response. When she finally tells you it’s not true, she
adds k≈i wán xiào at the end. She was just kidding.
(Now you’re really angry.)

Chapter 12: Ten Favorite Chinese Expressions 193
Máfan Nî
mah fahn nee; Sorry to trouble you.
You say máfan nî when, although you don’t want to
put anyone out, you politely accept an extended offer
to do something for you. If you can’t reach the salt at
the other end of the dinner table and someone offers
to pass it to you, you say máfan nî. It means, “So
sorry to trouble you, but would you mind?”
Zênme Yàng?
dzummah yahng; How’s it going, or what’s up?
A great catchall expression when you run into old
friends and want to find out how they’ve been or what
they’re up to these days. You just say: Hey! Zênme
yàng?
Another way you can use zênme is by adding
“le” in place of “yàng” at the end. (Nî zênme
le?) If you do, you say, “Hey, what’s wrong
with you?” Kind of like, “What could you pos-
sibly have been thinking when you did such
a stupid thing?”
Qîng Wèn
cheeng one; Please, may I ask; excuse me, but . . .
Before you ask a question, be polite and preface it
with qîng wèn. You’re asking if you can even ask
about something. You can use it when you go shop-
ping and need to address a store clerk:
Qîng wèn (Please, may I ask), how much is that
thousand-year-old egg?

Chinese Phrases For Dummies 
194
You can also use it when you need directions and
have to approach a total stranger:
Qîng wèn (Excuse me), which bus can take me
to the Temple of Heaven?
Zìjî Lái
dzuh gee lye; I’ll help myself, thanks.
The rules of Chinese eating etiquette dictate
that you should never start to fill up your
plate before at least attempting to serve
someone else first. Zìjî lái is a polite expres-
sion you use to indicate that you can help
yourself as soon as someone starts to serve
you. A host always starts to serve the guests
sitting closest, but the guests should always
say zìjî lái (and then relent and let the
person serve them anyway) for each and
every course. After the host has started a
dish, however, you may indeed begin to
serve yourself.
∑iya!
eye yah; Oh my!
∑iya can be heard all over China whenever people
feel frustrated, shocked, or even just plain old
annoyed. You hear it when you show up to your par-
ents’ home for dinner with a friend who looks like he’s
in a punk rock band. You may even say it yourself
when you realize you left your briefcase in the taxi,
which is now halfway across town.

Chapter 13
Ten Phrases That Make
You Sound Like a Local
T
his chapter gives you phrases that help your con-
versation for many social occasions. Notice that
the Chinese often repeat phrases. Repeating words
happens often in spoken Chinese.
Hu≈nyíng Hu≈nyíng!
hwan yeeng hwan yeeng; Welcome!
Use this phrase when guests arrive at your home or in
your country to make them feel at home. And if you
say hu≈nyíng zài lái (hwan yeeng dzye lye) before
they leave, it means you welcome them to come
again.
Bîcî Bîcî
bee tsuh bee tsuh; same to you; you too
This little phrase comes in handy when someone
wishes you well or gives you a compliment that
merits return so you don’t appear vain. What’s that
you say? Great looking dress I have on? Bîcî bîcî.
(Yours looks great, too.)

Chinese Phrases For Dummies 
196
Jiûyâng Jiûyâng
jyoe yahng jyoe yahng; Pleased to meet you; liter-
ally: I have admired you for a long time.
Saying Jiûyâng jiûyâng when you first meet someone
you’ve heard something about is a polite gesture.
Màn Màn Ch∫!
mahn mahn chir; Bon Appetit!
Be sure to say màn màn ch∫! to the others at your
table before you take your first bite. You’ll win hearts
all around. It actually means “eat real slowly.” This
phrase lets everyone know you hope they take their
time and enjoy the meal.
Wô Qîng Kè
waw cheeng kuh; It’s on me; My treat.
You hear this phrase day in and day out all over
China. Everyone wants to be the one to pay the bill,
so folks make a big deal out of being the first person
to go to the hip when the check comes. 
Friends often make a joke by adding “nî fù qián” (nee
foo chyan) at the end of this phrase. If you hear some-
one say “wô qîng kè, nî fù qián,” it means “I’ll take
the bill, but you’ll be the one to pay it.” Only say this
when you dine with a good friend who can take a joke.
Yôu K∂ng Lái Wán
yo koong lye wahn; Please come again.
Just before guests leave your home, say “Yôu k∂ng
lái wán.” (literally: When you have time, come back
and play.) Sometimes you also hear people say “màn

Chapter 13: . . . Sound Like a Local 197
zôu,” (mahn dzoe) which literally means “walk
slowly” and is loosely translated as “careful going
home.” 
Láojià Láojià
laow jyah laow jyah; excuse me; pardon me
Ever wonder what to say when you need to pass a
person who’s standing in your way? Láojià láojià is the
phrase you want to remember for crowded moments.
It offers you a nice way of getting someone’s attention
without being rude.
Zhù Nî Zâo Rì K≈ng Fù
joo nee dzaow ir kahng foo; Get well soon.
Ideally you won’t have to use this expression too
often, but if you do, at least the folks hearing it will
know your colloquial Chinese is good.
Búkèqi
boo kuh chee; you’re welcome; no problem; don’t
mention it
You say búkèqi as the bookend to xièxiè (shyeh shyeh;
thanks). You can’t say one without expecting to hear
the other. Búkèqi represents more than just a response
to “thank you,” however. It’s part and parcel of a larger
group of words that express a humble spirit, which the
Chinese always treasure in friends and acquaintances.
If someone thanks you profusely for something you do,
whether big or small, never accept the thanks as some-
thing you agree you deserve. Giving yourself a pat on
the back is the opposite of what you want to convey.
Always make it sound like your deed is no big deal,
something you prefer to downplay. 

Chinese Phrases For Dummies 
198
Hâo Jiû Méi Jiàn
how jyoe may jyan; long time no see
You can use this phrase in all seriousness or in jest if
you’ve just seen someone an hour before. Either way,
it puts people in a good mood to know that you care
about being in their presence again.
