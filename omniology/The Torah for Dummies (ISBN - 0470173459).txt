About the Author
Arthur Kurzweil is one of the most popular lecturers and teachers on the
Torah, Talmud, Kabbalah, and other topics of Jewish interest in synagogues
and at other Jewish gatherings across the United States and Canada. He is a
direct descendant of Rabbi Chaim Yosef Gottlieb (1790–1867), Rabbi Isaiah
Horowitz (1555–1630), and Rabbi Moses Isserles (1530–1572), three illustrious
and revered rabbis and teachers of the Torah.
Arthur is the author of Kabbalah For Dummies (Wiley) and On the Road with
Rabbi Steinsaltz: 25 Years of Pre-Dawn Car Trips, Mind-Blowing Encounters, and
Inspiring Conversations with a Man of Wisdom (Jossey-Bass). He’s also the
author of the best-selling classic From Generation to Generation: How to 
Trace Your Jewish Genealogy and Family History (Jossey-Bass), coeditor 
of The Hadassah Jewish Family Book of Health and Wellness (Jossey-Bass),
and editor of Best Jewish Writing 2003 (Jossey-Bass). He also wrote My
Generations: A Course in Jewish Family History (Behrman House), which is
used in synagogue schools across America.
Arthur is the recipient of the Distinguished Humanitarian Award from the
Melton Center for Jewish Studies at The Ohio State University for his unique
contributions to the field of Jewish education. He also received a Lifetime
Achievement Award from the International Association of Jewish Genealogical
Societies for his trailblazing work in the field of Jewish genealogy.
A member of the Society of American Magicians and the International
Brotherhood of Magicians, Arthur frequently performs his one-man show
“Searching for God in a Magic Shop,” in which he blends the performance of
magic tricks with a serious discussion of Jewish theological ideas. Arthur
lives with his wife, Bobby, in a suburb of New York City.

Dedication
For Bobby
“He must have loved me so much
to send me someone as fine as you.”

Author’s Acknowledgments
My goal in these acknowledgments is to recognize those people who have
helped me, in many different ways, to think I’m qualified to write this book.
Who am I to write a book on such a sacred subject as the Torah? And who
helped me have the nerve to claim I have the qualifications? I think I know.
But before I acknowledge them, I take full responsibility for this book. Any
errors are mine.
Many years ago, when my children were young, I asked my teacher, Rabbi
Adin Steinsaltz, for some advice: How do I teach my children the Torah? He
told me to speak with them about the most difficult and abstract spiritual
ideas I knew to exist. I took his advice, and the result has been extraordinary.
For the past quarter of a century, I have had the deepest religious discussions,
sharing amazing words of Torah with my three children. My decision to enroll
my children full time in schools of Torah study (with full secular studies as
well) created three knowledgeable Torah teachers surrounding me daily. The
experience has been mind-blowing — for me. My Torah education has unfolded
every day from the process of learning from my children, each of whom is my
teacher. I have insisted upon it.
My greatest thanks, appreciation, love and gratitude go to:
Miriam Kurzweil: You will surely see how important your help with this book
has been because there is clear evidence of your hard work, knowledge of the
Torah, and eager, unfailing assistance on so many of these pages. I hope and
pray you also know how precious, deep, intimate, and profound our countless
hours of conversations have been to me over the years. You’re awesome.
Moshe Kurzweil: If I were asked 20 years ago to dream my wildest dreams and
express what I would hope for in a son, I would have described the person
you’ve become. You’re a spiritual searcher and teacher, kind and articulate,
gentle, strong, and wise. You and I can speak about God forever. And I hope
we will. As I write this, you are in the Holy Land for a year of advanced Torah
study. Please keep teaching me.
Malya Kurzweil: As you know, when a question of Torah comes up among
some of our family members, the first words spoken are, “Let’s ask Malya.”
You have deservedly earned the reputation of having Torah knowledge that 
is broad and deep and so often profound. And you have proven to so many
people that your talents as a teacher of Torah are on the highest level. How
rare and priceless have your words of Torah been for me. You are a treasure.
Heartfelt thanks are also due to:
Rabbi Adin Steinsaltz: You are the Light of our generation. I’m just one of so
many who simply don’t know where we would be without you. If I have one

wish for this book it is that its readers will seek out your books and learn
from your endless wisdom, understanding, and knowledge.
Saul Kurzweil: My extraordinary father. You personify the spirit of the
Talmud. You were always in my mind as I wrote this book and as I tried to
anticipate your rich flow of deep and important questions.
Evelyn Kurzweil: My beautiful mother. You personify the words of Hillel when
he taught the essence of the Torah, and you are a role model of patience,
kindness, empathy, and refinement. Your Hebrew name, Zisil, captures you
perfectly.
My editors: Georgette Beatty, Mike Lewis, Elizabeth Rea, and Rabbi Alan Kay.
Georgette, your firm and wise guidance, your delicious laughter, and your
genuine warmth made the whole process an uplifting one. Mike, thank you 
for your vision and for your confidence in me. Elizabeth, every question,
suggestion, and insight from you enhanced this book. Alan, it is no surprise
that your participation inspired me to be more sensitive to others; you are a
rare gem. Because I have been in the world of publishing for 30 years, I know
the kind of magic that talented editors perform. The four of you are the best!
My editorial consultants: Rebecca Allen — If there’s an editorial job to do,
you’re the one for me. Alan Zoldan — When I need creative help, you’re first
on my list.
My ancestors: Rabbi Chaim Yosef Gottlieb (1790–1867), Rabbi Isaiah Horowitz
(1555–1630), Rabbi Moshe Isserles (1530–1572), Reb Avraham Abusch
Kurzweil, Rabbi Shlomo Zalke Rosenvasser, Rabbi Asher Yeshia Gottlieb, Reb
Yekutiel Yehudah (Zalman Leib) Gottlieb, and Reb Yehuda Yaakov Kurzweil.
May your descendants continue to invest their lives in the study of Torah.
My teachers: Reb Shabtai Zisel ben Avraham Zimmerman of Hibbing, MN, Reb
Eliezer Nehemiah HaCohen of Montreal, Ram Dass, Reb Eliezer ben Shlomo of
Sighet, Rabbi Shlomo ben Benzion Halberstam (1907–2000), Rabbi Menachem
Mendel ben Levi Yitzchak Schneerson (1902–1994), Rabbi Meshullam Zalman
ben Shlomo HaKohen Schachter-Shalomi, Reb Yaakov Yehuda ben Yitzchak
Zelig Halevi v’Yehudis Siegel, Yosef Puglisi HaMalamud HaGadol, and Rabbi
Israel Nobel of East Meadow.
Ken Kurzweil: My brother and friend. You’re always there when I need you,
with patience and endless support.
Ruth Rothwax: With my love and gratitude. Thanks for your belief in me and
for the advice and support you always give freely.
My wife’s family, especially the inspirational Estelle and Eugene Ferkauf, Howie
and Liz Kleinberg, Josh Kleinberg and Donna LaGatta, Gal Dor, and Orna Dor.
Special thanks and heartfelt love to Rachel Dor: I will always be grateful for the

very first moment we met, and I am truly impressed by your fertile mind, moved
by your sweet soul, and inspired by your thirst for the delicious waters of
Torah learning.
Rabbi Simcha Prombaum: Loving friend, gifted Torah teacher, and cherished
advisor. I consult you almost daily on all things large and small.
Ed Rothfarb: In every way an artist, fellow seeker, loving friend for nearly 50
years. We went to Hebrew school together, walked to grade school together,
and here we are, still celebrating life together and continuing to share our
search for spiritual wisdom.
Richard Carlow: Source of infinite joy and delight, loving friend for over
40 years. I can’t imagine life without you.
Robin Kahn Bauer: Loving and loyal friend, and fellow seeker for over 40 years.
Rick Blum: Loving friend, Torah buddy, and confidant for over 40 years. 
Your spiritual journey and love of Torah is a true inspiration to me.
Gary Eisenberg: My spiritual brother. No words can even begin. From the
moment we met, it was love at first sight.
Marc Felix: Loving friend, joined at our soul’s root.
Marcia Cohen: Loving friend for over 45 years. You’ve taught me about spiritual
devotion, crazy wisdom, and the pure joy of lifelong friendship.
Margy-Ruth Davis: Special friend, Jewish leader, and role model.
Zsuzsa Barta: Trusted friend and beautiful cousin. I knew you and began
loving you the moment I met you on that train platform in Budapest.
Dr. Helen Hecht: Loving friend, gifted healer, extraordinary soul.
Reb Tuvia Frazer: Thank you for inviting me in.
Alan Rinzler: Friend, teacher, soul-brother.
Rashi and Shabbos, who sang as I wrote.
Bobby Dor Kurzweil: My wife, my life, my best friend and chevrusa.
Blessed are You, Lord our God, King of the universe, who has kept us alive,
sustained us, and permitted us to reach this moment.

Introduction
T
he Torah is both the most sacred object and the most sacred text in
Judaism. It consists of the first five books of the Bible: Genesis, Exodus,
Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. The word “Torah” comes from the same
root as the Hebrew word hora’ah (hoe-rah-ah), which means “instruction” or
“teaching.” The Torah’s purpose, simply stated, is to provide people with
instructions for finding and following the path of God and the path to God.
Although the words in the Torah, which is also known as the Five Books of
Moses, consists of exactly 304,805 letters, the great sages of Jewish tradition
teach that all the wisdom in the universe is hidden within these letters. Jewish
tradition looks carefully at these letters and at the words they form, and great
sages throughout history have provided — and continue to provide — the
proper instruction for analyzing the Torah text and revealing its divine messages.
As my teacher, the renowned Rabbi Adin Steinsaltz of Jerusalem, has said,
“Other religions have a concept of scripture as deriving from Heaven, but only
Judaism seems to be based on the idea that the Torah Scripture is itself Heaven.
In other words, the Torah of the Jews is the essence of divine revelation; it is
not only a basis for social, political, and religious life but is something of
supreme value.”
When you study the Torah, you aren’t just studying the word of God. According
to Jewish belief, Torah study is actually an authentic encounter with God. The
Torah can be viewed as a collection of concentrated emanations and trans-
mutations of divine wisdom. I’m a Jew who studies the Torah in one form or
another every day. I’ve been studying the Torah for nearly 40 years, and I’ve
come to believe that the Torah is the most profound collection of wisdom
and guidance I’ve ever encountered.
About This Book
It’s essential to know that you can’t understand the Five Books of Moses
simply by reading it like a storybook. A core belief among the Jewish people
is that when Moses encountered God on Mount Sinai and received the Torah,
he actually received two Torahs — one written and one oral. The two parts
together make up what the Jewish people consider to be the Torah.
The relationship between the Written Torah and the Oral Torah has often
been compared to the relationship between the United States Constitution on
the one hand and both federal and state legislation as well as the decisions of

2
The Torah For Dummies 
the Supreme Court on the other hand. The written Constitution contains
basic principles, but it’s the legislation and court decisions that expand upon
these principles and give them life. Jewish tradition teaches that the Oral
Torah works in much the same way, expanding upon the basic written princi-
ples of the Five Books of Moses. These basic principles are constantly being
applied to new situations as human history unfolds.
In The Torah For Dummies, I explain how both aspects of the Torah work
together to form an operating manual for life. Like all For Dummies books,
you don’t need to read The Torah For Dummies from cover to cover. Each
chapter is self-contained. I’ve constructed each section so that you can flip
through the book, find something of interest, and read it without needing to
know what the other chapters say. I’ve written this book in plain, down-to-
earth language, and if I need to mention an essential technical or foreign
word or phrase, I make sure to define it the first time I use it.
Even though the Torah is deep and profound, Jewish tradition teaches that
the Torah is written in the language of humans and is meant to be accessible
and understandable. I’ve made sure that my explanations and descriptions of
the Torah and its contents resulted in a plain-language reference book that
will serve you well, even if you have had absolutely no prior experience or
familiarity with the Torah.
My goal in writing The Torah For Dummies is to introduce you to the Torah,
its structure, its contents, and its significance in Jewish life. I also want you to
understand how the ideas in the Torah provide the basis of Western civilization
and the foundations of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.
Conventions Used in This Book
Because the Torah is a vast subject with so many parts, qualities, aspects,
and subjects, I had to establish a few conventions while writing to make the
subject as clear and understandable as possible. As you read The Torah For
Dummies, please keep in mind my conventions regarding the following:
 The word “Torah”: Don’t jump too quickly to define the word “Torah.” It
has abstract connotations as well as very specific usages. For the most
part, when I use the word in this book, I’m referring to the Five Books of
Moses. But as you will find out, “Torah” also refers to the oral tradition
that has been passed down from generation to generation ever since
Moses encountered God at Mount Sinai. In addition, the word “Torah”
refers to the entire body of Jewish teachings.
 References to God: Although the Five Books of Moses refers to God
using male pronouns like “He” and “Him,” in principle God has no gender
and is beyond anything the human mind can grasp on any level.

Occasionally, I refer to God using male pronouns for simplicity’s sake,
but I try to avoid this as much as possible.
 Pronunciation of Hebrew words: Many Hebrew words and phrases
appear throughout this book in boldface text, and because not every-
one’s familiar with the language, I offer pronunciation help. The syllable
that receives the accent is always in italics. But you should be aware that
there are two ways to pronounce many Hebrew words:
• Ashkenazic: This is the Central and Eastern European pronuncia-
tion that’s used in most, but not all, Orthodox synagogues. An
example is Shabbos (shah-bus; Sabbath), with the accent on the
first syllable.
• Sephardic: This is the modern Israeli pronunciation that’s used in
most liberal synagogues and some Orthodox synagogues in the
United States. An example is Shabbat (shah-baht; Sabbath), with
the accent on the second syllable.
In this book, I mostly use the transliteration and pronunciation com-
monly used in Israel, but sometimes I give the Ashkenazic pronuncia-
tion, especially if it has become common usage.
 The names of the Five Books of Moses: I use the common names for
each of the Five Books of Moses. For example, the first book, Genesis, is
actually called Bereshit (beh-ray-sheet) in Hebrew and in Jewish tradition.
Even though I would love for you to know the “real” names of each book,
I’ve come to the conclusion that using the common names is more
useful, especially for a beginner.
 Sages, commentators, and rabbis: Throughout this book, I use these terms
interchangeably. The term “sage” is a common one in Jewish life and
generally refers to any highly regarded Torah teacher. By definition, some-
one whose commentaries on the Torah have come to be accepted among
traditional Jews throughout history is known as a sage. Occasionally, I refer
to “the rabbis.” What I mean by that isn’t simply anyone who happens to
be a rabbi but rather those rabbis who have earned reputations as-
luminaries among the Jewish people.
 English translations of verses from the Torah: The Torah is written in
Hebrew; the English translations appearing in this book are mine, but I
want you to know that I’m quite familiar with all the available English
translations of the Torah and I’ve often borrowed phrases from them.
Generally, my translations are composites of all the available English
translations as well as my own translations, and my decisions are based
on my judgments as to what’s the clearest and most understandable lan-
guage to modern English-speaking readers.
 Jewish observance: This book is not a guide to Jewish religious obser-
vance. If you’re interested in following the teachings of the Torah, there are
many books available specifically to help you with that. The best way to
learn how to live a religious Jewish life is to find a qualified rabbi or teacher
who can direct you in the process of learning the way of the Torah.

Introduction

What You’re Not to Read
If you have the time and inclination to read this book from cover to cover, by
all means, get to it! However, if you’re only looking for the most helpful, most
essential facts and explanations, you can skip the sidebars, which appear in
shaded gray boxes throughout this book. They’re interesting (I hope!) anec-
dotes and pieces of information that supplement the text but aren’t essential
for an understanding of the topics being explored.
Foolish Assumptions
When writing this book, I had to make some assumptions about you. First of
all, I don’t assume that you’re Jewish, nor do I assume that you want to be.
And although the Torah is just as much about spiritual practice as it is about
general spiritual ideas, I don’t assume that you want to adopt every practice,
custom, and ritual, nor do I assume that you necessarily agree with all the
theological assumptions found in the Torah.
Following are some additional assumptions I’ve made. If you fit into any of
these categories, this book is for you:
 You’ve heard about the Torah and are curious about it because you
know that it’s the central book and foundation of Judaism.
 You know that both Christianity and Islam have their roots in Judaism
and the Torah, and you’re interested in understanding those roots.
 You have some familiarity with the Bible and know some of its contents
(like Noah’s Ark and the Ten Commandments), but you still want more.
 You’re a spiritual seeker, and you’ve heard that the Torah is the corner-
stone of the Jewish path and the hiding place of all the secrets of Kabbalah.
 You’re Jewish but realize that you never received a good Jewish educa-
tion or you want to supplement, enrich, broaden, and expand your
Jewish knowledge.
 You’re not Jewish, but you’d like to understand more about Jewish life,
including that of your Jewish friends and neighbors.
 You’ve attended a synagogue service and have witnessed the reverence
that the Jewish people give to the Torah, and you’d like to know more
about it.
 You’ve seen popular films like The Ten Commandments and Raiders of the
Lost Ark, and you’re curious about the contexts of those films.
 You’ve seen a lot of Christian preachers on television quoting from and
explaining the Torah from their points of view, but you’d like to know
how Judaism understands its holy book.

The Torah For Dummies 

How This Book Is Organized
I’ve organized this book so that you can skip around easily. In order to help
you get in, get the information you need, and get out without reading cover to
cover, I divided the book into parts that give you one piece of the Torah pic-
ture at a time.
Part I: The Torah 101
This part provides you with the basics. You get an overview of the entire subject,
in particular the major sections of the Torah as well as some of its most
important ideas and concepts. I introduce the main “character” of the Torah —
God. There’s a lot to say about God, even though, by definition, it’s impossible
for humans to grasp God. But once you understand the paradox that the Torah
expects you to establish an intimate, personal relationship with a God whom
you can’t conceive of, you begin to understand that God is the basis of every-
thing. And because the Torah is often profoundly misunderstood, I also explore
what the Torah isn’t in this part.
Part II: One by One: The Books 
of the Torah
The Five Books of Moses consists of, well, five books: Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus,
Numbers, and Deuteronomy. In this part, I walk you through each of the five
books, one by one, summarizing the major events and concepts appearing in
each. After reading each chapter in this part, you should have a pretty good
idea of the books’ contents, from stories you didn’t know of to ones that sound
familiar (like the splitting of the Red Sea or the giving of the Ten Commandments).
I’ll warn you now that you may end up saying to yourself, “Oh, so that’s where
that comes from!”
Part III: The Torah: An Operating 
Manual for Planet Earth
Even though the Torah has a lot to say about spiritual topics like God, faith,
good and evil, and angels, it’s a book of action. Its emphasis is on the world in
which people live and function. In this part, I show you how the Torah concerns
itself with personal behavior, like honoring parents, giving charity, treating
animals with kindness, and just about every personal human activity. I also
show you how the Torah has an equal concern for behavior in communal
affairs, like the court system, employee/employer relations, and property rights.

Introduction

Part IV: The Importance 
of the Torah in Judaism
The Torah scroll is the most sacred object in Jewish life. In this part, I show
you how the contents of the Torah form the basis for Jewish holy days and
Jewish customs and practices (like eating kosher food), and the way in which
the Torah scroll is used during synagogue services. According to Jewish tra-
dition, every Jewish person must either write a Torah scroll or support those
who do, so in this part, I provide you with the details of how a Torah scroll is
written. Finally, every Jewish person is required to study the Torah, so I
describe just how this is done and provide you with some suggestions if you
want to participate in the study of the Torah.
Part V: The Part of Tens
Every For Dummies book has a Part of Tens. One natural list of ten items relat-
ing to the Torah is the Ten Commandments. But it’s not so simple: Not only are
there two versions of the Ten Commandments in the Torah, but different groups
of Christians even count them differently! Another group of ten that I give you
in this part is ten famous (and often misunderstood) quotations from the
Torah, many of which you’ll know.
Part VI: Appendixes
In this part, I include a glossary of terms that you should know for a basic
vocabulary about the Torah. And last but not least, I give you a list of the 613
commandments found in the Torah, broken down into positive commandments
(what you should do) and negative commandments (what you shouldn’t do).
Icons Used in This Book
All For Dummies books feature icons (little pictures that grab your attention)
in the margins to serve you well. Think of them as road signs pointing to dif-
ferent kinds of information in the chapters.
This icon alerts you to ideas and concepts that my Torah teachers have given
me over the years.
6
The Torah For Dummies 

This icon alerts you to concepts, terms, and ideas in the Torah that are of
particular importance. Keep the points marked with this icon in mind, and
you can’t go wrong.
This icon points out helpful information that you can use if you make the
Torah a part of your life.
This icon points to misconceptions about the Torah or actions that are strictly
forbidden by the Torah. Read this information carefully!
This icon highlights instances when I quote directly from the Torah or some
other important Jewish source, often from some of the great sages of Jewish
history.
Where to Go from Here
You can begin this book wherever you like. But you may want to start with
the following suggestions:
 If you’re interested in all 613 commandments in the Torah, go to
Appendixes B and C.
 If you want to get a good overview of each of the Five Books of Moses,
read Part II.
 If you want to put the Torah’s basic principles into practice immediately,
read Chapters 9 and 10.
No matter where you start, I can’t deny that I’m excited for you. The Torah is
awesome. There’s a blessing that Jews have said for centuries before study-
ing the Torah as a way of offering thanks to God; the blessing is this: “Blessed
are You, Lord our God, Ruler of the universe, Who has sanctified us by Your
commandments and has commanded us to get involved with the words of 
the Torah.” This blessing doesn’t require you to obey the Torah, believe in the
Torah, or follow the Torah. It simply says to “get involved with its words.” I
hope you do.

The Torah For Dummies 

Part I
The Torah 101

In this part . . .
E
ven though you can begin reading any chapter in 
this book ﬁrst, you may want to get some of the
basics under your belt. In this part, I cover some of the
fundamental elements found in the Torah itself, such as 
its setup and laws. I also give you a quick overview of 
the contents of the Five Books of Moses. Perhaps most
importantly I devote an entire chapter to God, who is the
ultimate author of the Torah; in fact, God is the author of
the universe and everything that exists.

Chapter 1
Beginning with Torah Basics
In This Chapter
 Meeting the Torah’s author — God
 Discovering the most important elements of the Torah
 Glimpsing each of the Five Books of Moses
 Understanding how to live a righteous life according to the Torah
 Seeing how the Torah guides the lives of the Jewish people
T
he Torah, also known as the Five Books of Moses, is the most sacred
object and the most important text of the Jewish people. As a sacred
scroll found in every synagogue throughout the world, it’s referred to as a
sefer Torah (say-fehr toe-rah; Torah scroll); as a bound book, it’s referred to
as a chumash (khuh-mahsh; five).
The Torah is more than a text, though; it’s also the spiritual tradition of the
Jewish people, communicated by God (the Creator and Master of the uni-
verse) to Moses (the greatest prophet of the Jewish people) on Mount Sinai
in 1280 BCE and handed down from generation to generation.
You can understand the word “Torah” in a third way as well. Torah is the vast
and constantly growing body of teachings and wisdom of Judaism, and in this
sense it even includes what a qualified Jewish teacher will teach tomorrow.
The “study of Torah” is not necessarily the same as the “study of the Torah.”
“The Torah” usually means the Written Torah, the Five Books of Moses,
whereas “Torah” is Torah studies in the more general sense.
In this chapter, I introduce you to various aspects of the Torah, such as its
structure, teachings, and study. I invite you to explore this chapter and dis-
cover some basics about this unique document of documents that has taught
the world about charity; love; the importance of educating children; honesty
in the marketplace; the concepts of bankruptcy, courts, and witnesses; and
so many other aspects of modern experience that are embedded into the
fabric of our lives.

12
Part I: The Torah 101 
Introducing God, the Torah’s Author
Even though the Torah is mainly about God, it’s also important to remember
that the Torah’s author is God. Although the first line of the Torah says, “In
the beginning of God’s creation of heaven and earth . . .,” it’s God who is
speaking. God chose Moses to receive and write down a divine message,
which is why the Torah is also known as the Five Books of Moses, but the
Torah emanates from God. God reaches into the human world with the Torah.
Jewish tradition teaches that God didn’t create the world out of nothing.
God’s creation is an emanation of divine light that God sculpted into all that
exists. God is not just “in” everything. Rather, everything is God. This is, of
course, a paradox. On the one hand, people live their lives feeling separate
from God, but at the same time, Jewish tradition teaches that on the deepest
level everything is God.
In studying the Torah, you’ll often encounter paradoxes. Many spiritual
teachers teach that when you encounter a paradox, it usually means that
you’re going in the right direction. The endless struggle to grasp and under-
stand what is meant by God is both the most important activity of life and, at
the same time, an impossible task. The study of Torah is the way in which
Jews participate in this paradoxical struggle. Some of the ideas that students
of the Torah struggle with include:
 Humans are created in God’s image.
 God has many names, but no name can possibly be adequate.
 God exists.
 God has no gender.
 God is unique; nothing is like God is any way.
 God is everywhere.
 God is, was, and will be; God transcends time.
 God is beyond human comprehension.
The Torah is mainly God’s communication to people about how to behave. Most
of the Torah is directed toward the Jewish people, although it also contains
instructions for all other peoples of the world. But for reasons that only God
knows, the Jewish people are given extra burdens and responsibilities. 
God chose the Jewish people, but in no way does this status of being 
chosen by God imply superiority.
People have responsibilities to God and to each other, and the Torah is filled
with instructions about how to fulfill both (see the later section “Living Life
According to the Torah” for more about people’s responsibilities to each
other). Regarding a person’s relationship to God, the Torah stresses

 Connecting with God through God’s commandments
 Having faith in God
 Maintaining trust in God
 Accepting direction from God
 Understanding that God directs everything that occurs
 Struggling to comprehend God
 Communicating with God through prayer

Examining the Torah’s
Important Elements
Jewish tradition maintains that the Five Books of Moses contains everything.
Yes, everything. Although the Torah is a religious document, it isn’t a collection
of abstractions in spiritual language. Rather, it uses concrete descriptions in
the form of laws and stories to express abstract notions. The Torah also deals
with all aspects of life, from business, agriculture, and industry to family life,
sexuality, and ritual. The Torah directs human conduct in all its aspects. It
urges followers to see the whole world as a Holy Temple in which each
student functions as a priest whose job it is to constantly purify and sanctify
the entirety of life.
The Torah consists of two parts: One is written and the other is oral. Flip to
Chapter 3 for a full introduction to the treasures of the Torah.
The Written Torah
As the Torah describes, Moses was the greatest teacher and prophet who ever
lived. It’s important, however, to always keep in mind that Moses wasn’t a
perfect being. He had the noble attribute of humility, although he was also
self-effacing sometimes, and he didn’t always do the right thing. As my
teacher has often said, “In Judaism, there are no plastic saints.”
At Mount Sinai, Moses encountered God in an intimate way unlike anyone
before or since, and Moses wrote down what God told him to write. The
result was the Five Books of Moses. It is these five books that are the main
focus of The Torah For Dummies. Table 1-1 shows you the names of the Five
Books of Moses, which come from Greek because a few thousand years ago
the Torah was translated into that language. The table also gives you the
Hebrew names of the books and their translations.

The Torah isn’t the Bible. The Jewish Bible is the book that Christians call the
Old Testament, and the Five Books of Moses are the first five sections of the
Jewish Bible. The other sections are the books of the Prophets (of which there
are eight) and the books of other sacred writings (of which there are 11). In all,
there are 24 books in the Jewish Bible, also often referred to as the Hebrew
Scriptures.
The Oral Torah
When Moses encountered God and received God’s message, the divine trans-
mission included oral teachings that were never meant to be written down.
An oral tradition allows for flexibility; too often when an oral teaching is written
down, it’s taken too literally and loses its power to adapt to changing times and
circumstances. It was only after much debate and discussion that the great
sages of the Jewish people decided to write down the oral teachings in a
process that began a few thousand years ago. This compromise was based on
the historical fact that the enemies of the Jewish people were killing so many of
the Children of Israel and the sacred traditions were at a great risk of being lost.
The major elements of the Oral Torah include
 The Mishnah (mish-nah; repetition): A book consisting of six sections,
written in Hebrew, that serve as a summary of the oral teachings as
handed down by Moses, along with the Written Torah, to the elders of
the Jewish people.
 The Gemara (geh-mah-rah; completion): Additions, written mostly in
Aramaic, that serve to analyze the Mishnah, define its fine points, and
also illustrate how the Five Books of Moses and the Mishnah are applied
to the ever-changing conditions of life.
The Mishnah and the Gemara appear together in the Talmud (tahl-mood;
learning), which is a set of books consisting of 63 sections and also includes
additional commentaries by great teachers throughout the centuries.
14
Part I: The Torah 101 

 The Midrash (mid-rahsh; interpretation): A few dozen books written over
a number of centuries that serve to expand upon the details found in the
Five Books of Moses and other books of the Jewish Bible. The various
collections of Midrashim (plural for Midrash) teach both divine moral
lessons and divine laws.
 Halachah (ha-lah-khah; the way to walk): The term for Jewish law.
Jewish laws are either positive (“do this”) or negative (“don’t do this”),
and 613 of them are traditionally found in the Five Books of Moses (see
Appendixes B and C for the full list). This number is deceptive because
there are actually thousands of Jewish teachings that grow out of the
primary 613 commandments in the Torah.
Taking One Torah Book at a Time
There’s an ancient Jewish tradition that the entire Five Books of Moses is
actually one long name of God. The Written Torah is also traditionally seen as
five separate books, each with its own character and content. The following
are the Five Books of Moses, which I cover in detail in Part II:
 Genesis: The book of Genesis focuses on the creation of the universe
and the creation of the Jewish family, starting with Adam and Eve, Noah,
his son Shem, and ultimately with the patriarch Abraham and matriarch
Sarah. The book is filled with many dramas involving the individuals
who form the foundation of the Jewish people, most notably Abraham,
Isaac, Jacob, Sarah, Rebecca, Rachel, Leah, and Joseph.
 Exodus: The book of Exodus essentially tells the story of the Jewish
people’s experience of slavery in Egypt and ultimate liberation under the
leadership of Moses and his brother Aaron. This book also describes
Moses’s encounters with God and the receiving of the divine transmission
called the Torah at Mount Sinai.
 Leviticus: This book of the Torah contains the least amount of narrative
among the five. Rather, it’s concerned with the rules and functions of a
branch of the Jewish family that serves a unique priestly role within
Judaism; it’s also filled with laws, rules, and regulations of a wide variety.
 Numbers: The book of Numbers largely concerns itself with the 40-year
journey through the desert, from Egypt to the Promised Land (Israel),
taken by the Children of Israel. Earlier in the Torah, God promises the
Land of Israel to Abraham, and it’s Moses’s mission to lead the freed
slaves — who are the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob — to
the Promised Land. The book of Numbers provides details of many of
their encounters and experiences in the desert and also includes many
of the laws incumbent upon the Jewish people.
15
Chapter 1: Beginning with Torah Basics

 Deuteronomy: The book of Deuteronomy is largely Moses’s farewell
address to his people. In this book, Moses recounts many of the key
experiences of the Jewish people after their liberation from Egypt. He also
takes the opportunity to repeat many teachings contained in the first four
books of the Written Torah. This book ends with the death of Moses.
Living Life According to the Torah
The Torah is God’s instruction book to humankind. For practical purposes,
you can see these instructions as two different yet overlapping types: One is
the instructions by God about how people should behave as individuals on a
personal level, and the other is how people should behave in a community.
Watching your personal behavior
The Torah’s instructions to people about personal behavior are based on the
assumption that the details are what matters. Sure, it’s lovely to say that people
should be nice to each other and should love each other, but it has been
proven again and again that lofty generalizations like “Be nice” or “Be fair”
are never enough. The trend in the Torah is to add details rather than to
make broad, sweeping statements. Without specific instructions to follow,
people all too often don’t really get the picture or behave as they’re supposed
to. The Written and Oral Torahs together show how the highest, deepest, and
most profound ideals from God are applied to the ever-changing circumstances
of life.
Head to Chapter 9 for more information on keeping your personal behavior in
line with the Torah, including tips on treating both your family and strangers
kindly.
Playing well with others in the community
The great American poet Robert Frost wrote, “Good fences make good neigh-
bors.” This is a terrific summary of the way in which the Torah concerns itself
with communal behavior. As with the Torah’s teachings about personal
behavior, the details are what matters. While some of the general principles
can be summarized as “Be honest,” “Be compassionate,” “Be a good boss,” and
“Be a good citizen,” it’s not enough to give sweet, abstract instructions on how
people in a community should behave toward one another. Good rules, good
definitions, and good fences serve a community well. The Written Torah and
the Oral Torah go into minute detail on the main principles, covering just
about every conceivable situation in community life.

community, including information on doing better business, dealing with
property rights, and keeping order in the court.
Connecting the Torah to Judaism
The way of Judaism as a spiritual tradition is the way of Torah. The Torah is
the link between God and the Jewish people. Jewish belief, Jewish law, Jewish
practice, Jewish customs, Jewish holy days, and Jewish values all grow out of
the Torah, as you find out in the following sections.
Taking note of the holiness of time
The great Jewish sages teach that it’s possible to connect with holiness
(which means connecting with God) in three ways: the holiness of space, the
holiness of the human soul, and the holiness of time:
 The holiness of space focuses on a spot in Jerusalem known as the Holy
of Holies; it’s surrounded by the Holy Temple. The Holy Temple is situ-
ated in the Holy City of Jerusalem, and the Holy City is in the Holy Land
of Israel. An example of a constant recognition of the holiness of space is
that the Torah instructs Jews throughout the world to face Jerusalem
during the three daily prayer sessions.
 The holiness of the human soul implies that the human soul can refine
itself and make itself holy through the holy behavior as instructed by
the Torah.
 The holiness of time is expressed through special rituals and prayers that
are recited at special times and occasions. The Torah instructs the Jewish
people that one of the best ways to connect with God is to observe the
commandments that guide them through the various units of time.
The Jewish sages teach that the Torah concerns itself with every moment of
life: from the moment of birth to the moment of death, and from the moment
you wake until the moment you sleep. Just as God is everywhere in space, so
too is God everywhere in time. The Torah instructs its students regarding
 The day (three prayer sessions and other daily requirements)
 The week (the six working days and the Holy Sabbath)
 The month (the observation of the new moon each month)
 The year (many holy days that appear throughout the annual Jewish
calendar and are detailed in the Torah)
Chapter 11 has the complete scoop on observing holy days in Torah time.

Chapter 1: Beginning with Torah Basics

Following Jewish customs
The Written Torah and the Oral Torah have a lot to say about how Jewish
people should conduct themselves throughout each important stage of life,
as shown in Table 1-2.

The Torah also has a lot to say to the Jewish people regarding all aspects of
life, including
 The use of symbols in Judaism, such as
• Mezuzah (a sign on the doorpost of every Jewish home)
• Tzitzit (a sign on the corners of clothes that some Jews wear)
• Tefillin (a sign that actually wraps itself around your head and arm)
 The way to eat (eating according to the kosher laws is explained in great
detail)
Go to Chapter 12 for more instruction on following Jewish customs according
to the Torah.
Witnessing a Torah synagogue service
The best way to understand how the Jewish people revere the Torah is to
watch or participate in the weekly Torah service held on Shabbat (Saturday)
in the synagogue; I walk you through this service in Chapter 13. The elaborate
ritual and public reading of the Torah is filled with solemnity, joy, reverence,
and formality. The Torah resides in a special — and usually beautiful —
closet found in every synagogue sanctuary. The Torah, in the form of a scroll,
18
Part I: The Torah 101 

starts out literally dressed in the finest royal attire and then is undressed,
studied, read aloud, and redressed with the utmost care and devotion.
Since ancient times, the Torah has been read publicly each week on Shabbat.
This custom certainly served the Jewish people well when printed copies
weren’t common like they are today, and the communal gathering of Jews to
hear the words of the holy Torah continues to be an emotional high point for
Jewish people throughout the world. The Five Books of Moses is divided into
weekly sections, and every synagogue community reads the same section each
week. The entire Torah is read in the course of one year. On the Jewish holy
day of Simchat Torah (sim-kaht toe-rah; the joy of the Torah), the last sen-
tences are read and the first sentences begin the round of the year once again.
Writing a Torah scroll
The Five Books of Moses actually comes in two formats:
 A handwritten scroll on parchment, essential for use in the synagogue
service
 A book printed on a printing press and readily available to the masses
According to the Torah, it’s the responsibility of each Jewish person to
handwrite a Torah scroll. Because the task is so difficult, not to mention time-
consuming, Jewish law is lenient and permits you to fulfill this commandment
in a number of ways, including providing financial support to qualified scribes.
Some authorities say that you can also fulfill this commandment by buying
books about the Torah. So purchasing The Torah For Dummies means that
you’ve already begun to fulfill one of the Torah’s commandments!
Flip to Chapter 14 for more information about the commandment of writing a
Torah scroll.
Analyzing and studying 
the Torah all your life
Throughout the ages it has been frequently said that the most important
activity in all Jewish life is the study of the Torah, which is the subject of
Chapter 15. Many statements in Jewish holy texts support the notion that
Torah study throughout a lifetime is of supreme value. Here are a few from
the Talmud:
 In the same way that it’s essential to feed a child, it’s essential for the
Jewish people to study the Torah.
19
Chapter 1: Beginning with Torah Basics

 A single day of Torah study is more important than 1,000 sacrifices in
the Holy Temple.
 God cries over people who are able but nevertheless neglect Torah study.
 God studies the Torah every day.
 Non-Jews who study the Torah to learn of their obligations are as great
as the High Priest in the Holy Temple.
Jewish tradition considers every letter, word, line, story, and detail of the
Written Torah to be of divine origin and therefore containing an infinity of
meanings. In principle, it’s impossible to say that any one line, story, or book
of the Torah means only one thing. There are levels upon levels of meaning in
every tiny detail of the Written Torah.
In principle, it’s assumed that everybody hears the Torah differently. This
doesn’t mean that Torah study is a free-for-all where every and any interpre-
tation is always correct. But as my teacher says, each person has a personal
relationship with God, and that relationship is a completely private affair. You
can and should work with a Torah teacher and try to understand the Torah
through the commentaries of the great sages, but in the final analysis, you
have to trust yourself and make your own decisions. As one tradition states,
each of us is a letter in the Torah, and each of us must find our letter.
Although the Written Torah is in Hebrew and the Oral Torah is mostly in
Aramaic, the good news is that there are lots of English translations of the
Five Books of Moses and also English translations of the commentaries that
are essential to arriving at a more complete understanding of the Torah (as
you find out in Chapter 16). Jewish life is an immersion into the Torah and
into the literature that the Torah has inspired. My home library is filled with a
few thousand books (literally) on the Torah. The Torah For Dummies is one
more book for that ever-growing Torah library. In fact, this book is designed
to be a doorway that opens into a vast garden of profound Torah knowledge.
A well-known statement in the Oral Torah summarizes the importance of
Torah study:
Rabbi Tarfon used to say: You are not required to complete the task, but
neither are you free to withdraw from it. If you have learned a lot of Torah,
much reward has been prepared for you, and your Employer can be trusted
to compensate you for your labor. But know that the reward of the righteous
is reserved for the World to Come.

the Ultimate Author
In This Chapter
 Understanding how God created the world and its people
 Discovering some of God’s names
 Getting a grip on God’s nature
 Grasping the ways to grow closer to God
 Finding out how to communicate with God
T
he Torah is full of teachings on just about every aspect of human experience.
As you find out in Part III and throughout this book, there are teachings
about human relations, business practices, ethical behavior, treatment of the
poor, family life, sexual relations, holy days, rituals, courts, and criminal law,
and that’s just the tip of the iceberg.
But at its core, the Torah is a holy book about God and God’s relation to the
world. The Torah establishes that the source for all teachings, and indeed the
source of everything that exists, is God.
It’s not easy to talk about God because, according to Jewish wisdom, it’s
impossible for humans to fully conceive of God. God is ultimately beyond
anything that humans can grasp. The study of Torah is, according to Jewish
tradition, the way for Jews to travel a path to God. In this chapter, I introduce
you to God’s creation of the world, some of the ways in which the Torah
describes the nature of God, and ways in which you can relate to and commu-
nicate with God.

Enter God, Stage Center: Creating a New
World (And People to Fill It)
The Torah doesn’t waste any time introducing God. The very first sentence of
the very first book of the Torah, the book of Genesis (see Chapter 4), begins
with the famous line, “In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.”
Getting to know God is essential to Jewish life, and as you find out in the
following sections, a good way to start gathering this knowledge is to understand
the basics of God’s creation of the world as described in the Torah.
Switching on the light
(and keeping it on)
The first words spoken by God as recorded in the Torah are “Let there be
light” (Genesis 1:3). Torah commentators (you meet some of them in Chapter
16) have observed that the light created by God at the very beginning of
Genesis is in some ways similar but is really not the same as the light that
people know in their everyday lives. The natural light of the world comes
from the sun. But when God says “Let there be light” at the beginning of the
Torah, this light exists before God’s creation of the sun, moon, stars, and
planets. Sometimes this original light is referred to in sacred Jewish texts as
“Primordial Light.” Many Torah commentators over the centuries point out
that an understanding of the light in the world can lead to a deeper under-
standing of the original light.
God’s divine light emanates from its divine source. According to the great
sages of Jewish tradition, everything in the world ultimately is formed by the
primal light at the beginning of the creation story. There’s a fundamental view
within Jewish thought that makes an important point about creation: Some
people in the world believe that God did indeed create the world but that after
the creation was finished, God withdrew from the world. In contrast, Jewish
sages express the oral tradition within Judaism that God is continuously creating
the world, continuously speaking the words “Let there be light.”
One illustrious Jewish sage illustrates the point of continuous creation by
suggesting that if God were to turn His attention away from the universe for a
moment, it would all disappear. As a primary belief, Jewish tradition teaches
that God continues to create the world (or sustains it) and is involved in
every aspect of it. As the founder of Chasidism, the great Rabbi Israel, known
as the Baal Shem Tov (bah-ahl shem towv; the Master of the Good Name),
teaches, “Not even a blade of grass moves without God as its mover.”
22
Part I: The Torah 101 

The use of electrical imagery helps to explain this view of creation. When you
turn on an electric light switch, the current flows and illuminates an electric
light bulb. If you turn off the light switch, the current is blocked, and the light
extinguishes itself. As the great Torah sages say, the world is created by the
downpour of divine plenty that’s constantly flowing from above; in other
words, God never turns off the switch of light and creation.
Using the Torah as a blueprint
Ancient rabbinic tradition offers a startling and profound image regarding the
creation of the world. The rabbis suggest that when God created the world,
the Torah was God’s plan. The Zohar (an ancient mystical commentary on
the Torah; see Chapter 3) actually says that God looked into the Torah and
made the world accordingly.
This image presents a challenge, because how could God create and look into
the Torah before He even created the world? After all, isn’t the Torah the sacred
text that God gave to Moses? The Jewish spiritual path requires that you
establish a unique and intimate relationship with a Torah that is Infinite. The
Torah scroll used today is a physical form of the primordial Torah. The image
of God looking into the Torah to create the world is also the basis for Torah
students’ assumption that everything is contained in the Torah. A well-known
saying from a sage who lived many centuries ago named Ben Bag Bag can be
found in the standard daily Jewish prayer book. Ben Bag Bag speaks about the
value of studying the Torah and says: “Turn it and turn it again for all is in it.”
A basic assumption of the study of the Torah is that every last letter of the
Torah was dictated to Moses by God and has meaning. Even if a word is spelled
incorrectly for example, with a missing letter, the assumption on the part of
students of the Torah is that this missing letter is not an error but in fact has a
reason and has content of its own. After all, the Torah is a book unlike any
other book. Many of its most profound teachings are buried deep within the
text; the Torah requires ingenuity and brilliance in order to decipher its
message. The assumption remains that everything — including the plans for
the creation of the world — is contained in the Torah. Jewish tradition teaches
that by carefully analyzing the Torah text you can discover many mysteries,
even the mystery of God’s ongoing creation of the world at this very moment.
Creating the world in six “days”
Early in the book of Genesis (the first book of the Torah), a description of the
creation of the world appears. According to the story, it took God six days, or
stages, to create the world and everything in it. Students of the Torah don’t
understand this passage on the literal level.
23
Chapter 2: Encountering God, the Ultimate Author

Why? People measure time in the world by the movement of the sun, earth,
and moon. But the Torah narrative doesn’t introduce the sun and moon until
the fourth day, leading Torah commentators to conclude that the “day” spoken
of in the process of God’s creation wasn’t the typical 24-hour day as humans
experience it. Rather, the six days of creation represent six stages of the world’s
development, and as great Torah commentaries throughout the centuries
indicate, the descriptions of these days contain some of the profound secrets
of the mystery of creation. The bottom line is that the Torah is neither a
sourcebook for scientific information nor a book of history (as you find out in
Chapter 3). Rather, the Torah is concerned with eternal spiritual matters and
how to make them a part of your life.
Taking a break from creating (and not
because God grew tired)
According to the Torah, God created the world in six days and then “rested”
on the seventh day. This day of rest, known as Shabbat (shah-baht; Sabbath),
isn’t actually considered a real day according to the sages of the Torah.
Instead, Shabbat is a special phenomenon, a special gift that God created and
gave to the world. Throughout the centuries, Jews have received this divine
gift of Shabbat, and convincing arguments claim that the Jewish people’s
adherence to the rhythm of the week and the culmination of that week in the
celebration of Shabbat has been crucial to their survival. (I go into much
greater detail about the Torah’s conception of Shabbat in Chapter 11.)
Making humans in God’s image
This unusual phrase appears in the book of Genesis: “Let us make man in our
image, after our likeness” (Genesis 1:26). Many students of the Torah have
asked the question, “Who is the ‘us’ and the ‘our’ referred to in this line?”
Torah sages suggest that the “us” refers to the ministering angels with whom
God consulted. The Talmud and many other Jewish spiritual texts also teach
that a person is to be considered a whole world, so when God said “Let us,”
He was referring to the entire universe. (And “world” and “universe” are
synonymous.)
People also have asked how God actually created man. The great Torah
commentator Rashi (rah-she; see Chapter 16) indicates that the verse implies
that God first created a mold, or a conceptual archetype, from which to create
humans. The great Torah commentator known as the Ramban (rahm-bahn;
see Chapter 16) teaches that humans are a microcosm of the whole of Creation
and that contained within each person are elements of everything in the
universe.
24
Part I: The Torah 101 

Physical descriptions of God in the Torah text in no way literally describe God;
rather, the words were chosen based on familiar things to attempt to express
the inexpressible. So, for example, when you read of God’s “eyes,” the Torah
isn’t suggesting that God has physical eyes. It’s suggesting that one attempt
to know the unknowable God is to try to grasp God as being infinite and
therefore as knowing (or seeing) everything. (For more about this concept, see
the later section “God stretches out His arm, but He has no arms.”)
Given the nonphysical nature of God, the great rabbis ask in what way man 
is made in God’s image. The answer is in the fact that man has free will. Man is
given the ability to choose freely and therefore to create and destroy. The Torah
sees a human being as the pinnacle of creation, the reason for the creation of
the world. Man occupies a unique place in the cosmos of the Torah: He’s
considered the only actor on the cosmic stage who has a spark of God within,
as evidenced by man’s power of will and power to create and destroy. One of
the profound paradoxes of Jewish theology is expressed in the Talmud by Rabbi
Akiva, who says, “All is foreseen and free will is given.” This paradox is a great
challenge but is an essential part of Jewish life and thought: On the one hand,
God is in control of everything, and yet, at the same time humans function
under the assumption that there is free will. Jewish tradition requires students
of the Torah to meditate throughout life on this theological riddle or paradox.
Calling God by Many Names in the Torah
The Torah refers to God by many different names. No one name can possibly
represent God, nor can any long list of names even begin to suggest something
close to the inconceivable nature of God. As you find out in the following
sections, the Torah suggests a number of keywords that, being rich and 
deep with meaning, may be used as God’s names.
Different aspects of God revealed
in common names
Each name of God that appears in the Torah invokes its own meaning.
Students of the Torah constantly try to reach the unreachable, by which I
mean reach with their minds and hearts to more and more vast conceptions
of God. As the author of the Torah, God gives Himself many different names,
each one revealing a different aspect of the Divine.
25
Chapter 2: Encountering God, the Ultimate Author

The many names of God that appear in the Torah text and that have been
used for centuries among Jews include:
 Adonai (ah-doe-noy): This name of God, which appears in every stan-
dard Jewish blessing, is technically the plural form of “my Lord.”
According to Jewish tradition, you pronounce this name of God only
when you’re reciting a blessing.
 Ehyeh Asher Ehyeh (eh-yeh ah-share eh-yeh): This phrase from Exodus
3:14 in which Moses asks God for His name is often translated as “I will
be Who I will be” or “I am that I am.” The word ehyeh (eh-yeh) also can
be translated in the future tense to mean “I am what I will be,” “I will be
what I will be,” or “I am becoming what I am becoming.” This aspect of
the future is noteworthy because the Torah represents God as being
beyond time; God knows everything, including the way in which history
will unfold.
 Elohim (el-oh-heem): This form of God’s name often refers to God’s jus-
tice. It’s only spoken during prayers and blessings.
 HaMakom (hah-mah-comb): Jewish theology often refers to God as “the
place” of the world, so this term literally means “the place.” This is my
favorite name for God.
 HaShem (hah-shem): Torah students worldwide use this name, which
means “the Name.”
 Shaddai (shah-die): Often translated as “the Almighty,” this name of God
often is used in reference to God as the guardian of the Jewish people.
It’s only spoken during prayers and blessings.
 Yah: This is the first part of the Tetragrammaton (see the following
section). It’s also the source of the Rastafarian name of God, Jah, which
often is heard in reggae music.
Many scholars have misinterpreted the names of God that appear in the
Torah. In fact, a whole field of biblical studies known as the Documentary
Hypothesis developed out of the attempt to prove that the Torah is made up
of lots of old documents and stories, thus explaining the variety of God’s
names. Torah scholars reject this theory based on the understanding that
there are profound reasons for the many different names of God that appear
in the Torah. Each name reveals a different aspect of the Divine. It’s really no
different from people’s names and how they’re used in daily life. Take my
name, for example: Depending on the situation, I’m called “Arthur,” “Mr.
Kurzweil,” “Abba” (Hebrew for “dad”), “sir,” “Avraham Abba ben Chayim
Shaul” (my Hebrew name, used when I am called up to bless the Torah),
“mister,” “rabbi,” and still other names. Each name reveals a different aspect
of my activities and relationships in the world.

YHVH: The name of God 
that’s never spoken
YHVH (in Hebrew, it’s the letters, “yud,” “hay,” “vav,” and “hay”), which appears
over 6,500 times in the Torah, often is considered the most important of God’s
names and is the one referred to as the Tetragrammaton, or the four-letter name
of God. The pronunciation of this name of God is strictly forbidden because, of
all the names of God, it contains the most hidden and profound mysteries. This
precious name must be protected and not simply bandied about or used
informally. Paradoxically, although this name of God is the deepest and most
profound name, it’s the one that must not be spoken. This name is so significant
and powerful, but ultimately there’s no word or name that can adequately
represent God. According to Jewish law, only the High Priest in Jerusalem’s Holy
Temple is allowed to pronounce the four-letter name of God, and he can only
do so one day a year — on the holy day of Yom Kippur.
The four-letter name of God has been the subject of much study and the
object of intense meditation by Jews throughout history. One explanation of
the four letters indicates the following:
 The first letter, the yud, is the smallest letter in the Hebrew alphabet
(see Chapter 14 for more details) and represents the essential, original
point out of which everything grows.
 The second letter, the hey, expands upon the yud just as the human
intellect takes ideas and expands them.
 The third letter, the vov, is the sixth letter of the Hebrew alphabet and
refers to the six central attributes of God (and of man) as represented in
Jewish theology.
 The fourth letter, the hey, represents the vastness of everything. As the
fifth letter of the Hebrew alphabet, it represents the quintessential, or
the summation of all creation.
27
Chapter 2: Encountering God, the Ultimate Author
A big name from a big misunderstanding
One popular name for God throughout the world
is Jehovah (jeh-hoe-vah). But Jehovah actually
is based on a big misunderstanding. In some
ancient texts, an unusual combination of two of
God’s names were merged. The four-letter
name of God was written with the vowels of the
word “Adonai” (another name of God; see the
earlier section “Different aspects of God
revealed in common names”) beneath it. In
other words. the vowels “a,” “o,” and “a” were
inserted into YHVH, resulting in “YAHOVAH,”
which was ultimately translated as “Jehovah.”

Getting to Know the Nature of God
through the Torah
In Jewish tradition, the way to find the path to God is to study the Torah. In
addition to all its teachings about behavior and ritual (see Parts III and IV for
details), the Torah is also the main source for information about the nature of
God. Just as it’s impossible to summarize God in a sentence or a paragraph,
it’s impossible to confine one’s understanding of God to one thing or one
level of understanding. But by studying the Torah and seeing the way in
which it describes God, students begin to understand some of God’s nature.
God exists eternally
According to the Torah’s view of existence, God is the source of everything,
and God is eternal — He is, He was, and He will be. The first of the Ten
Commandments, “I am the Lord thy God,” is the commandment to recognize
God’s existence. This simple statement is at the core of all Jewish belief and
everything that the Torah represents. (Flip to Chapter 17 for more on the Ten
Commandments.)
The Torah sage Maimonides, known as the Rambam, is the author of a
masterpiece known as the Mishneh Torah (mish-neh toe rah; the Second
Torah). The 14-volume work accomplishes an amazing goal: to document
every Torah law and teaching, both in the Written Torah and in the Oral
Torah (see Chapter 3). For centuries, Maimonides’s Mishneh Torah has been
considered an extraordinary masterpiece. Maimonides begins the work by
saying, “The foundation of all foundations and the pillar of all wisdom is to
know God.” His message is that knowing that God exists is fundamental.
God isn’t a “He”
The Torah is written in Hebrew, and its references to God often use the
masculine form. As in English, the use of male pronouns often has no relation
to gender; for example, people talk about “mankind” when they really mean
“humankind.” In the Torah, God isn’t a male, and any effort to conceive of
God as a male is limiting and therefore is forbidden according to the tradition
of the Torah. Using gender-specific pronouns in reference to God is merely a
linguistic limitation.
The rabbis in the Talmud often use a female form in reference to God; when
they write of hearing the voice of God, they use the phrase bat kol (baht kole;
daughter’s voice). The term also means “echo,” implying that when the
28
Part I: The Torah 101 

Talmudic rabbis heard a heavenly voice, it wasn’t God’s actual voice but
more like an echo of God’s voice. Recall that the Talmud is a recording of the
oral tradition of the Jewish people and an explication of the teachings of the
Oral Torah that Moses received on Mount Sinai along with the Written Torah
(see Chapter 5).
God is a single entity
A prayer known as the Shema (sheh-mah) is recited twice a day in Jewish life,
and its words come from the Torah. Its lead sentence, which is best known
among Jews, is Shema Yisrael Adonai Elohaynu Adonai Ekhad (sheh-mah
yis-rah-ehl ah-doe-nahy eh-low-hay-new ah-doe-nahy eh-khahd; Hear O Israel,
the Lord our God the Lord is One). In other words, the daily ritual among
Jews establishes and repeats the view of God as One.
As long as there has been a Torah, students have contemplated the meaning of
the word Ekhad (one). After all, they know that God has many names because
no name can contain him (I discuss God’s names earlier in this chapter). On
the other hand, Torah conception of God is that God is One, and it’s forbidden
to ultimately conceive of God as having parts. The oneness of God is a
profound, deep, and mysterious concept as well as the subject of deep Jewish
meditation. God is considered to be a unity, which means that God is a single
whole and a complete entity. Ultimately, God can’t be divided into parts.
God is everywhere — yes, everywhere
Jewish teachings describe God as omnipresent. With the idea that God is
everywhere and both near and far, it’s important to make a distinction
between the Torah view of God and pantheism. The point of view of the Torah
is that everything resides in God, whereas pantheism is marked by the notion
that everything is God. As I mention earlier in this chapter, my favorite name
of God is HaMakom, which means “the place;” God is “the place” of the world.
According to Kabbalah, which is the abstract theology of Judaism (see my
book Kabbalah For Dummies, published by Wiley), God contracted His infinite
self, creating a vacated space within Himself, to make room for the world.
Here’s another way to think of this concept: One way that God is described in
Jewish liturgy is Aviynu Malkaynu (ah-vee-new mahl-kay-new; our Father our
king). This phrase implies that God is both near and far. Your father is close
and familiar; you can sit on your father’s lap and touch his cheek. A king, on
the other hand, is someone whom you may never see in your lifetime.
29
Chapter 2: Encountering God, the Ultimate Author

God stretches out His arm, 
but He has no arms
Students of the Torah constantly confront a seeming contradiction within the
text. The Torah makes it clear that no person can conceive of God, and yet at
times it describes God in human terms.
A famous image from the Torah is of the “outstretched arm of God.” The Torah
says, “I am God, and I shall take you out from under the burdens of Egypt. I
shall rescue you from their service. I shall redeem you with an outstretched
arm and with great judgments” (Exodus 6:6). An outstretched arm is a very
concrete image. Yet it’s forbidden by Jewish law to conceive of God in any
concrete way or to limit God with any image. So how do you reconcile this
image? An important principle of Torah study is that “the Torah speaks in 
the language of man.” This notion, repeated so often in commentaries on the
Torah throughout the centuries (see Chapter 16), is a reminder that people
use finite images to grasp the infinite, knowing full well the impossibility of 
the task. These human concrete images make suggestions, but Torah literature
throughout the ages warns Torah students to beware of the ways in which
concrete images can get in the way rather than clarify.
Growing Closer to God 
with the Torah’s Help
The spiritual path in Judaism has as its main goal the deepening of one’s rela-
tionship with God. The Jewish answer to the question, “What is the purpose
of life?” is pleasure; God creates humans to provide them with pleasure. And
what is the greatest pleasure according to Jewish tradition? It’s knowledge of
God. In the Jewish tradition, the more you know God, the closer (spiritually)
you can get to God, and the closer you are to God, the greater the pleasure
you feel and experience. As you discover in the following sections, one way
to grow closer to God is through the Torah’s teachings.
Understanding how awesome God is
The Hebrew term yir’at HaShem (year-aht hah-shehm) is sometimes trans-
lated as “a fear of God” but is better understood as “in awe of God.” When
you think about the fact that there are billions of stars in the galaxy, which is
just one of a vast number of galaxies, it becomes clear that the universe is
inconceivably gigantic. Thinking, then, that God is the Creator of the universe
begins to inspire me to feel that God is indeed awesome.
30
Part I: The Torah 101 

Today, with advancements in computer technology, I think that grasping the
notion that God knows everything isn’t quite the challenge that it once was.
After all, it’s fair to say that we’re just at the beginning of the computer age,
and yet a small computer sitting on your desk easily can keep track of billions
of bits of information. If a tiny computer can track all that information, then
God, the Creator of the universe, surely can keep track of and have knowledge
of everything. To even begin to imagine this is to imagine an awesome God.
For me, I relate the awesomeness of God to the awesome sight I see when I
look down on the Grand Canyon. The immensity is awesome and makes me
feel very small. So when I stand before God and recite my prayers, one of the
emotions that comes over me is the apprehension of God as awesome.
The Torah urges people to build relationships with God. At the beginning of
one of the most popular sections of the Oral Torah, known as The Saying of 
the Fathers, the text says, “Be not like servants who serve their masters for the
sake of receiving a reward, but be like servants who serve their master not
upon the condition of receiving a reward; and let the awe of Heaven be upon
you.” In other words, the Torah teaches Torah students to serve God without
an ulterior motive and to feel awe as they serve. This kind of instruction moti-
vates and molds students of the Torah as their relationships with God deepen.
Developing faith in and trusting God
The Hebrew word for “faith” is emunah (eh-moo-nah). The great sages of
Jewish tradition teach that one of life’s ongoing activities is a deepening of
faith in God. Even if you believe that you receive faith as a gift from above, it’s
a common spiritual activity to work on one’s faith through prayer, study, and
deep contemplation. The goal is the belief in the following:
 That there is a God
 That God sustains the world
 That nothing happens without God allowing it to happen
 That God reveals Himself to His creation in many ways, including
through His instruction book, the Torah
My teacher has taught me how important it is to recognize that even the
most pious people have moments or periods of doubt. Given the abundance
of bad news and tragedy in the world, it’s easy to feel doubtful about the exis-
tence and nature of God. Does God exist? Is God a God of love and compas-
sion? Does God take care of his creation? These kinds of questions can
inspire doubt. The cultivation of faith in God is one of the important spiritual
challenges of life.
It doesn’t take much to shake your faith when you witness painful events
around you or when you see bad things happening to good people or vice
31
Chapter 2: Encountering God, the Ultimate Author

versa. It’s easy to wonder if life makes any sense or if there’s any justice in
the world. The great Jewish sages teach the spiritual concept of bitachon
(bit-ah-khone; trust), which has become traditional Jewish belief. As small
specks in a vast universe, humans can barely expect to see everything or
understand everything. The view is quite limited, making it easy to draw
negative conclusions from the events around you. The spiritual attribute of
bitachon expresses the feeling that despite your doubts, you know in the
inner recesses of your heart that God knows what He is doing, so everything
that happens is ultimately for the best.
Two of the major story lines in the Five Books of Moses are those of Abraham
and of Moses. Both Abraham (the father of the Jewish people) and Moses
(Judaism’s greatest teacher, prophet, and leader) begin their journeys with calls
from God to listen and to trust God. By studying the Torah and by learning how
to listen to God, students of the Torah learn to trust that what happens in life
has a divine purpose.
What’s the purpose of bad news and suffering? Trust in God includes two seem-
ingly paradoxical assumptions: It’s important to improve and repair the world,
and at the same time it’s vital to trust that what God allows has a purpose. As
one of my Torah teachers says, “Every descent is for the sake of ascension.”
Dealing with the paradox of free will
When you cultivate a deeper relationship with God, you eventually arrive at
the point that deals with the paradox of free will. On the one hand, Jewish
tradition teaches that everything is foreseen by God and that God knows
everything that will happen. On the other hand, Jewish tradition teaches that
human beings have free will and can choose freely. Two concepts in relating
to God can help students of the Torah handle this paradox: clinging to God
and being supervised by God.
Clinging to God
The paradox of free will is resolved within the concept of d’veykut (dih-vay-
khoot; clinging). D’veykut implies a clinging to God with such faith, devotion,
dedication, and awareness that your will and God’s will merge into one will.
Sometimes d’veykut is described as a smashing of the ego and a merging into
God. When a person arrives at a profound level of d’veykut, he almost stops
being aware of his separateness from God and begins to glimpse the secret of
the unity of all things.
In the book of Deuteronomy, Moses offers a long discourse on the ways of
relating to God and getting closer to God. Moses said, “Oh Israel, what does
God ask of you? Only to be in awe of God, to go in all His ways, and to love
Him, and to serve Him, your God, with all your heart and all your soul, to
observe the commandments of God, both those you can understand and
those you cannot understand” (Deuteronomy 10:12–13).
32
Part I: The Torah 101 

Moses continues with many details of instruction and advice about relating
to God. Finally, Moses summarizes and says that the commandment to
develop a relationship with God is really an effort “to love God, to walk in
God’s ways through God’s commandments, and to cleave to God”
(Deuteronomy 11:22). The great Torah commentator the Ramban teaches
that cleaving to God means always remembering God.
Being supervised by God
An important spiritual concept in traditional Jewish thought is hashgakha
pratit (hahsh-gah-khah prah-teet; private supervision). This concept recognizes
that every individual is under the private supervision of God. It’s the awareness
that the infinite God is constantly involved in every detail of existence, from
the largest cataclysm to the tiniest movement of an insect.
The concept of hashgakha pratit also seems to challenge the belief in free
will. While Jews recognize that the whole universe is under God’s direct and
individual supervision, they also recognize the divine human characteristic
of free choice. The entire contents of the Five Books of Moses can be seen as
stories of divine intervention, hashgakha pratit. Although there are hundreds of
moments when the Torah tells of God’s actions, students of the Torah don’t
assume that God is active in the world only when the Torah specifically indi-
cates something that God has done. God ultimately allows everything to happen.
An interesting example is the book of Esther, found in the Holy Scriptures
(the Bible). The book of Esther is the only book in the Scriptures where God
isn’t mentioned even once. The great Torah commentators point out that the
book of Esther contains a great number of details about a complicated story
and that God’s name doesn’t appear because God is present in every detail of
the story, as in life. Jews live with the assumption of free will despite the fact
that God foresees everything and knows everything that will happen.
Realizing you can never fully grasp God
(and what to do about it)
My teacher taught me that if you ever think or feel that you fully understand
God, one thing is sure: You’re wrong. He also taught me that, in his words,
“being Jewish is difficult: We have to establish a personal relationship with a
God that we cannot conceive of.” This reality often is a huge stumbling block
for people because it’s difficult to live with uncertainty. But although humans
can’t fully grasp God, the Torah teaches that we can be certain that there is a
God, that God cares about and guides His creation, and that everything is
ultimately for the best.
My bulletin board holds a quote from a book about physics that says, “In
physics you never understand a new idea, you just get used to it.” In some
ways you can say the same thing about God: You can’t really understand God,
33
Chapter 2: Encountering God, the Ultimate Author

you simply get used to God. Jews who haven’t grown up with a spiritual practice
but who decide later in life to explore traditional Judaism often report an
experience of God’s presence unfolding and developing as a result of studying
sacred texts regularly and praying daily. For the last 30 years, I’ve been
studying the Torah, its commentaries, and related texts. I’ve been trying to
follow the teachings of the Torah through proper behavior and the fulfillment
of the commandments. I pray daily, and when I’m not praying, I’m often thinking
about God. I can honestly say that I experience God as a constant presence in
my life. But do I know God? Of course not. As my teacher says, “If you think
you’ve arrived, you’re lost.”
But there came a point in my life when God’s presence was constant for me
and, in fact, God was more real than anything else I experienced. It’s my expe-
rience that Torah study, prayer, the observance of the commandments, pri-
vate meditation, and the performance of good deeds result in the awakening
to God. At a certain point, as my teacher put it, you become aware of the fact
that you’re in the palace of the King. It becomes possible to establish a very
close relationship with a God whom you can’t conceive of.
Communicating Directly with God
It has been said that the Torah is God speaking to humans and that, in Jewish
life, the Talmud (the Oral Torah) is humans speaking to God. The Talmud
consists of over 60 volumes of discussions and debates covering just about
every possible topic that exists. It’s also an incredibly close reading of the
Torah and is basically an effort to hear God’s voice and to understand what it
is that God wants of His people. In the following sections, I give you a quick
rundown on how to communicate directly with God with the help of the
Torah. For more about the Talmud, turn to Chapter 3.
Shhh . . . God is speaking!
Hearing God’s voice
In Jewish thought, the entire creation — all the details of everything that
exists — is really the Voice of God. In fact, the Jewish sages describe creation
as being constantly sustained by God’s speaking.
In Jewish life, there are a number of ways to hear God’s voice. The first and
most primary is to study the Torah (see Chapter 15 for tips on Torah analysis)
and the commentaries by the great sages (see Chapter 16 for details).
34
Part I: The Torah 101 

A student once asked my teacher how to hear God, and my teacher said, “Well,
the first thing you must do is quiet down.” He went on to say that people’s
thoughts are often the very thing that gets in the way of hearing God. In a tale
from Buddhist tradition, a student asked a master to teach him wisdom. The
teacher suggested that they first have some tea. When the teacher began to
pour the tea into the student’s cup, the student saw that the teacher kept
pouring the tea without stopping. The student said, “Teacher, the cup is full.”
The teacher said, “This is your first lesson: Unless you make room for new
teachings, you will not be able to receive them.”
One of the most powerful phrases in the entire Five Books of Moses is Lech
l’chah (lehkh le-khah; go): God tells Moses to go “from your land, from your
relatives and from your house” (Genesis 12:1). When young Abraham left his
home and essentially took the first steps of what would become the traditions
of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, he emptied himself of the ways of his
former culture in order to hear God. Several times a day in the daily Jewish
prayer book, Jews recite the Shema prayer. (I describe this prayer in more
detail later in this chapter.) The divine command in this prayer is to listen.
Saying hello to God
In Judaism, prayer is basically a human effort to simply say hello to God. The
Jewish sages instituted formal prayer three times a day as well as the hundreds
of blessings to say throughout the day as a vehicle to keep a person on the
right track and to constantly cultivate a close, deep, personal relationship
with God.
Formally pray to God three times daily
The great sages of Jewish tradition established three daily prayer sessions:
morning, afternoon, and evening. These three prayer sessions are said to
derive from verses in the Torah regarding the three Patriarchs: Abraham,
Isaac, and Jacob.
 Abraham: The rabbis in the Talmud teach that the morning prayers,
known as Shacharit (shah-khah-reet), are based on the verse in the Torah,
“And Abraham arose in the morning to the place where he had stood
before God” (Genesis 19:27).
 Isaac: The rabbis teach that the afternoon prayers, known as Mincha
(mihn-khah), are based on the verse in the Torah, “Isaac went out to con-
verse in the field towards evening” (Genesis 24:63). The rabbis teach that
the conversation was between Isaac and God. Because the Torah describes
this as happening “before evening,” they conclude that the time of Mincha
is in the afternoon before sunset.
 Jacob: The rabbis teach that the evening prayer service, known as
Ma’ariv (mah-ah-reev), is based on this Torah verse that speaks of
Jacob: “He came to the place and slept there” (Genesis 28:11).
35
Chapter 2: Encountering God, the Ultimate Author

The centerpiece of all three prayer sessions is an ancient prayer called the
Amidah (ah-mee-dah; standing). As the name implies, the prayer is recited
while standing in silence and facing Jerusalem. The prayer consists of 19
parts. Here are the names of those parts and their content:
1. Avot (ancestors): Praising the God of the patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, 
and Jacob
2. Gevurot (powers): Praising God for God’s power
3. Kedushat ha-Shem (the sanctification of the Name): Praising God’s holiness
4. Binah (understanding): Petitioning God for wisdom and understanding
5. Teshuvah (return or repentance): Praising God for repentance
6. Selichah (forgiveness): Asking for forgiveness for all sins
7. Geulah (redemption): Praising God as a rescuer of the Children of Israel
8. Refuah (healing): Asking God to heal the sick
9. Birkat HaShanim (blessing for years): Asking God to bless the earth’s
produce
10. Galuyot (diasporas): Asking God for the Jews to return to the land of Israel
11. Birkat HaDin (justice): Asking God to restore righteous judges
12. Birkat HaMinim (the heretics): Asking God to destroy anti-Jewish
heretical sects
13. Tzadikim (righteous): Asking God to have mercy on all who have divine
trust
14. Bo’ne Yerushalayim (Builder of Jerusalem): Asking God to rebuild
Jerusalem
15. Birkat David (Blessing of David): Asking God to bring the messiah
16. Tefillah (prayer): Asking God to accept our prayers and be compassionate
17. Avodah (service): Asking God to restore the Temple services
18. Hoda’ah (thanksgiving): Giving thanks for our lives, our souls, and miracles
19. Shalom (peace): Praying for peace, blessings, kindness, and compassion
Read the Shema twice daily
The oldest prayer in Judaism is the Shema (sheh-mah; hear or listen). Based
on a few verses in the Torah, its core is as follows:
Hear, O Israel, God is our Lord, God is One.
Love God your Lord with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your
might.
36
Part I: The Torah 101 

These words which I am commanding you today must remain on your heart.
Teach them to your children and speak of them when you are at home,
when traveling on the road, when you lie down and when you get up.
Bind these words as a sign on your hand and let them be an emblem in the
center of your head.
Also write them on your doorposts of your houses and gates.
Deuteronomy 6:4–9
Notice that the verses command you to speak of God “when you lie down and
when you get up.” This Torah commandment is fulfilled by reciting the Shema
twice a day, in the morning and at night.
Express gratitude before and after you eat
Deuteronomy 8:10 says, “When you eat and are satisfied, you must therefore
bless God your Lord for the good land that He has given you.” In the Jewish
tradition, this commandment is fulfilled by reciting the Birkat HaMazon
(beer-khaht ha-mah-zone; blessing of the food) after each meal.
Here are the names of each of four blessings of the Birkat Ha-Mazon, along
with their content:
 Birkat Hazan (beer-khat ha-zahn; the blessing for providing food):
Thanks God for giving food to the world
 Birkat Ha-Aretz (beer-khat ha-ah-retz; the blessing for the land): Thanks
God for bringing His children forth from the land of Egypt and for giving
them the land of Israel
 Birkat Yerushalayim (beer-khat yeh-roo-shah-la-yeem; the blessing for
Jerusalem): Asks God to rebuild Jerusalem and to bring the messiah
 Birkat Ha-Tov v’Ha-Maytiv (beer-khat ha-towv v’ha-may-teev; the blessing
for being good and doing good): Stresses that God’s work is good, that
God is good, and that God does good

Examining the Treasures
of the Torah
In This Chapter
 Getting a little historical background
 Familiarizing yourself with the structure of the Torah
 Figuring out what the Torah isn’t
 Checking out the commandments in the Torah
T
he Torah is filled with dazzling gems of all kinds. There are stories, spiri-
tual ideas, laws, life lessons, and more. So when Jews say “Torah,” the
meaning goes beyond the text of the Five Books of Moses and includes all the
teachings of the Oral Torah as well as the teachings and commentaries that
grow out of both the Written and the Oral Torahs.
The Torah is like an onion, with layer upon layer of teachings. Understanding
the structure of the Torah and its basic elements can help you uncover the gems,
work through the layers, and be illuminated by the divine light embedded
within it. I introduce you to the basics of the Torah’s form and function in this
chapter.
A Little History: Moses and the Torah
Knowing a little background about Moses’s involvement with the Torah is
important because aside from God, who is, in a sense, the main character of
the Torah, Moses is the central figure throughout most of the Five Books of
Moses; after all, the Torah isn’t called the Five Books of Moses for nothing! In
the following sections, I explain the role of Moses in bringing the Torah to the
world. (If you want to get to know the man a little better, turn to Part II.)
There has been lots of speculation and so-called scholarship about the Torah.
Some people have tried to prove through what’s known as the Documentary
Hypothesis that the Torah is really a bunch of ancient documents from different
times and different places that were somehow thrown together to form what’s

40
Part I: The Torah 101 
now known as the Five Books of Moses. Others, including the greatest rabbis
throughout history, insist that the Torah has always been one whole docu-
ment and that the “evidence” to the contrary is based on ignorance of the
Torah and the way the Torah communicates its teachings and ideas. While
the debates about the Torah will surely rage for as long as there are people
around to debate, the important thing to remember is that the Torah is a spir-
itual document containing eternal ideas, lessons, and instructions for living.
Who wrote the Five Books of Moses?
The Five Books of Moses was written . . . by Moses. Of course, not everyone
believes that, and there appears to be some evidence to support these
doubts about Moses being its author.
For example:
 There are references to Moses in the third person. For example,
Deuteronomy 34:10 states, “There has never been another prophet like
Moses. . . .”
 The names of the Edomite kings appearing in Genesis 36 apparently
lived after Moses died.
 Different names for God appear in different places in the Torah.
 Deuteronomy 34:5–9 contains verses that describe the death, burial, age
at death, physical condition at death, and mourning period for Moses.
Despite these provocative examples, every great sage throughout Jewish history
has taught that Moses wrote the Torah as dictated by God. Jewish tradition
also teaches that Moses was the greatest prophet who ever lived. If you accept
the notion of prophecy, you should have no difficulty in accepting that elements
of the Torah like those listed here are quite possibly true.
In all fairness, not all the groups within Judaism today believe that the Torah
was written by Moses and dictated by God. Whereas traditional Judaism
accepts the divinity of the Torah and accepts Moses as its sole author
(except, perhaps, for the last eight verses, which describe the death of
Moses), some representatives of the modern, liberal movements in Judaism
teach otherwise.
 Many in the Conservative movement teach that the Torah is a human
document written in response God’s revelation of Himself to humans at
Mount Sinai. One leading Conservative scholar suggests that God didn’t
reveal specific commandments but rather simply revealed His existence.
 The Reconstructionist movement often teaches that the Torah wasn’t
inspired by God but is the folklore of the Jewish people.

 The Reform movement often suggests that the Torah may be the product of
divine inspiration but was written by people in the language and context 
of its time.
Despite these views, the great sages throughout the centuries and the leading
traditional Torah scholars today teach that the Five Books of Moses was written
by Moses himself.
Are the five books about Moses
or by Moses?
The Five Books of Moses are both about Moses and by Moses. God dictated
the Torah to Moses, so although it seems like the Torah was written about
Moses, Moses was the scribe who wrote as God spoke.
It’s important to stress that Moses is in no way considered a god or even a
perfect person. The Torah describes the mistakes that Moses made and con-
cludes by indicating that Moses didn’t get his wish to enter the Promised
Land. In fact, there’s no marker for the grave of Moses, and tradition doesn’t
indicate its location. Jewish tradition resists all temptation to make Moses
into a saint.
A great teacher named Reb Zusia put a well-known teaching from Jewish tra-
dition into words. It’s recorded that Reb Zusia said, “When I stand before the
heavenly court, I am not afraid that they will ask me ‘Zusia, why weren’t you
Moses?’ But I am afraid they will ask, ‘Zusia, why weren’t you Zusia?’” Moses
isn’t represented as a complete role model for everyone to emulate. He certainly
had many admirable qualities (such as humility), but Judaism teaches that each
person, in a sense, must become himself or herself and not mimic others.
Understanding the Torah’s Structure
In a nutshell, the Torah is a written document made up of five parts that are
further divided into 54 sections; this document, while important on its own,
is also the start of the Jewish Holy Scriptures. But the Torah doesn’t end there!
The Written Torah is also accompanied by the Oral Torah and additional
commentaries that can help you improve your understanding of the divine
wisdom it contains.

Chapter 3: Examining the Treasures of the Torah

Introducing the Five Books of Moses
As you find out in Part II, the Written Torah has five distinct sections. This is
why it’s called the Five Books of Moses. The five sections are
 Genesis, or Bereshit (bur-aye-sheet; in the beginning)
 Exodus, or Shemot (sheh-mote; the names)
 Leviticus, or Vayikra (vah-yik-rah; and He called)
 Numbers, or Bamidbar (bah-mid-bar; in the wilderness)
 Deuteronomy, or Devarim (dih-vah-reem; words)
The Hebrew names of each of the five books are taken from the first words of
each book. The English names for the books come from the Greek translation
of the Torah from its original Hebrew.
Don’t let the name “the Five Books of Moses” mislead you. A Torah scroll
found in a synagogue consists of one long parchment made up of dozens of
pieces of parchment that have been sewn together. (Chapter 14 has more
about Torah scrolls.) In ancient times, there were no bound books with pages
to turn. Ancient books were scrolls, so although there are five sections of the
Torah, it’s really one big book.
One of the names used to refer to the Five Books of Moses is chumash (khoo-
mahsh; the five). The source for this word is another Hebrew term, chumesh
(khoo-maysh; a fifth), which was used to refer to one of the Five Books of Moses.
But “chumash” refers to a one-volume book (with pages and a binding)
containing all five books.
Dividing the Five Books of Moses
into 54 sections
The five sections of the Torah are divided into 54 sections known as parshiot
(par-she-oat; portion). (The singular form is parasha, pronounced par-ah-shah.)
Each parasha has a name that’s usually taken from either the first word or one
of the first words of the parasha. Sometimes it’s a word of significance indicating
some important aspect of that particular Torah portion.
For example, the second parasha of the Torah is called Parashat Noach
(par-ah-shot no-akh). “Noach” is the Hebrew name for the biblical figure
commonly known as Noah, the builder of the ark that survived the great biblical
Flood. As you may have guessed, the central story in this parasha is the story
of the Flood, but the word “Noach” is the fourth word in the parasha. The
parasha begins Zeh sefer Toledot Noach (zeh safe-air toll-dote no-akh; This 
is the book of the generations of Noah).

Part I: The Torah 101 

One portion of the Torah is read during the weekly synagogue service that I
describe in Chapter 13. Because 52 weeks are in a year, sometimes two por-
tions of the 54 are doubled up so that the entire text can be completed in one
annual cycle, which begins and ends on the Jewish holy day of Simchat Torah
each fall (see Chapter 11). On that day, the last verses of the fifth book of the
Five Books of Moses (Deuteronomy) are read publicly, followed by the first
verses of the first book of the Five Books of Moses (Genesis.) Table 3-1 lists

Marking the start of the Jewish
Holy Scriptures
The book that Christians know as the Old Testament is referred to as the
Tanakh (tah-nakh) by Jews. In English, it’s often called the Holy Scriptures,
and the word “Tanach” is actually an acronym for three words that represent
the three parts of the Jewish Holy Scriptures.
 T stands for “Torah” (the Hebrew letter “tav”). In this context, Torah
means the Five Books of Moses.
 N stands for “Neviim” (the Hebrew letter “nun”). Neviim means the
prophets. Eight books are in this part.
 Ch stands for “Ketuvim” (the Hebrew letter “kaf”). Ketuvim means the
writings. Eleven books are in this part.
Building on the Written Torah
The term “Torah” has a number of meanings. In this book, my main focus is
on the Torah as the Five Books of Moses. But the word also refers to the two
Torahs received by Moses: the Written Torah and the Oral Torah. The Written
45
Chapter 3: Examining the Treasures of the Torah

Torah is the text of the Five Books of Moses, whereas the Oral Torah consists
of the explanations of the Written Torah as well as additional wisdom imparted
to Moses by God. In addition, Midrash can help you read between the lines of
the Written and Oral Torahs. I discuss the Oral Torah and Midrash in the
following sections.
The Oral Torah
One of the oral traditions of the Jewish people is the prohibition against writing
down the oral tradition. But at a certain point in Jewish history (about 2,000
years ago), the Oral Torah was cautiously put into writing because the leader-
ship of the Jewish people knew that there was a great risk that the tradition
would be lost. Hostility, murder, and repression of Jews put terrible strain on
the transmission of the oral tradition. The Jewish leadership concluded that
unless the oral teachings were recorded, there was a good chance they would
be lost.
The leadership also understood the risks of writing down a tradition that was
meant to remain oral. Once it’s put into writing, it’s apt to lose its flexibility.
The act of writing it may mislead the reader into thinking that the written
explanation of the verse is thorough and complete. But new situations are
always presenting themselves, and the oral tradition must remain flexible
enough to be applied to these new conditions.
You can see one simple example of this idea of flexibility in Exodus 21:28, which
states, “And if an ox gore a man or a woman. . . .” This verse is the basis of
the area of Jewish law known as personal injury or damages. Today, people
rarely find themselves confronted by oxen. Therefore, the biblical law must
be applied to contemporary situations. The biblical “ox” may be a dog or a
bus or a bicycle today.
So how did the Oral Torah come to be written down? In the second century
CE, the leader of the Jewish people at that time, Judah HaNasi (Judah the
Prince), wrote down in a brief, sometimes cryptic outline the basic principles
of the Oral Torah. The document, which is divided into six sections, is known
as the Mishnah (mish-nah; repetition). The Mishnah codified the oral tradition
and immediately became a part of the sacred literature of the Jewish people.
After the Mishnah was compiled, the next several generations of great rabbis
and sages analyzed the Mishnah, explaining its principles and adding addi-
tional oral teachings that had been part of Jewish tradition since the revelation
of the Torah at Mount Sinai. These additions became known as the Gemara
(geh-mah-rah; completion). The Mishnah and the Gemara together are known
as the Talmud. Check out a page from the Talmud in Figure 3-1.

Midrash
Understanding the Five Books of Moses isn’t limited to one meaning and
certainly isn’t limited to its literal meaning (see Chapter 15 for more about
the different levels of meaning in the Torah). Although the Jewish approach
to the Torah includes an inquiry into the plain meaning of the text, some say
that there are countless ways of interpreting the many levels of the Torah.
Included within the many ways of approaching the Torah is one general
method known as Midrash (mid-rahsh; explanation or interpretation). The
word “midrash” has two meanings:
 It means analyzing the Torah.
 It’s used to refer to the body of literature that contains the midrashic
analysis of the Torah.
The Oral Torah includes precise ways in which the Written Torah is to be
analyzed and understood. One set of rules for delving into the Torah text and
its meaning is found in the traditional Jewish prayer book; the rules are
known as Rabbi Ishmael’s Measures. Rabbi Ishmael, who lived around the
year 200 CE, presented a series of 13 principles that are applied to the Torah
text. A review of these 13 principles is beyond the scope of this book, but I
can offer a brief look at one principle — in fact, the first one — in order to
help explain the approach. This principle forms the basis of Midrash.
The first principle is called Kal v’chomer (kahl v’khow-mare; all the more so).
In modern logic, you may know it as “if . . . then.” For example, if it’s forbid-
den to work on the Shabbat, then “kal v’chomer” it’s forbidden to work on
Yom Kippur, which is known in Jewish tradition as the “Sabbath of Sabbaths.”
50
Part I: The Torah 101 

Within the world of Midrash, there are two general subdivisions:
 Midrash Halachah (mid-rahsh ha-lah-khah; biblical interpretation to derive
laws) is the way in which the great sages look at the Torah to identify
divine laws. Although there are 613 laws in the Five Books of Moses (see
Appendixes B and C for a full listing), in fact there are thousands of laws
that can be derived from the teachings of the Five Books of Moses.
These laws are derived through the method called Midrash Halachah.
 Midrash Aggadah (mid-rahsh ah-gah-dah; biblical interpretation to
derive more details of biblical stories and moral lessons) is the way in
which the great sages look at the Torah to fill in the blanks in the stories.
For example, the Bible tells the famous story of Noah and his ark and the
great Flood. But the Torah doesn’t give any detail of what happened
within the ark filled with animals during the Flood. The Midrash
Aggadah tells the oral tradition, filling in the details.
There are many large, book-length collections containing midrashim (the plural
of midrash). They provide a huge amount of details to supplement to text of the
Five Books of Moses and to help to explain the meaning of the verses in the Torah.
Several of the major midrashim are available in English translations from
various publishers. Consult a good Jewish bookstore for available volumes.
These collections are considered part of the Oral Torah and therefore part 
of the sacred texts of the Jewish people. The major ones include:
 Mekhilta (Midrash on the book of Exodus)
 Sifra (Midrash on the book of Leviticus)
 Sifre (Midrash on the books of Numbers and Deuteronomy)
 Sifre Zutta (legal Midrash on the book of Numbers)
 Tanna Devei Eliyahu (Midrash on many verses in the Torah)
 Midrash Rabbah (literally “the great Midrash”), which includes
• Bereshit Rabbah, on Genesis
• Shemot Rabbah, on Exodus
• Vayikra Rabbah, on Leviticus
• Bamidbar Rabbah, on Numbers
• Devarim Rabbah, on Deuteronomy
The Zohar
The Zohar (zoh-har; splendor) is the major work of Kabbalah. It contains the
most concentrated and extensive gathering of mystical teachings in Judaism.
These teachings explore the nature of God, the structure and origins of the uni-
verse, the nature of the human soul, sin, good and evil, and many other subjects.
51
Chapter 3: Examining the Treasures of the Torah

Originally, the Zohar consisted of many individual manuscripts, but it eventually
was arranged parallel to many of the weekly Torah portions. The text, written
mostly in Aramaic with some Hebrew, has been described as a mystical novel
telling of a group of rabbis who wander about the Galilean countryside
exchanging the secret teachings of the Torah. See the opening page of the
Zohar in Figure 3-2.
Jewish lore relates that Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai, the author of the Zohar
who lived during the later part of the second century, was pursued by the
Romans. He and his son took refuge in a cave for 13 years, during which time
they studied the Torah. The result of these years of hiding and studying was
the writing of the Zohar.
The English-language reader doesn’t have many options when it comes to
studying the Zohar. For many years, the only English-language translation of a
significant piece of the Zohar was a literal translation available from Soncino
Press. But it’s not useful for the beginner. More recently, a new translation
has appeared known as the Pritzker Edition (Stanford University Press). It’s a
highly scholarly edition and also isn’t terribly useful for the beginner. A
number of single-volume anthologies quoting from portions of the Zohar are
also widely available in both Jewish and major general bookstores. While the
English-language material isn’t very useful, insights from the Zohar do appear
in small doses in many books on the Torah.

Getting a Grip on What the Torah Isn’t
Sometimes an effective way of understanding what something is is knowing
what it isn’t. This is certainly true of the Torah. Many misconceptions about
the Torah are floating around, so in the following sections, I clarify what the
Torah is by making sure you know what it isn’t. It all boils down to this fact:
At its core, the Torah is a set of instructions from God meant to provide divine
wisdom; it simply uses several methods, such as stories, commandments, and
history, to impart those instructions.
The Torah isn’t a storybook
The Torah begins with the phrase “In the beginning,” but this doesn’t simply
mean “Once upon a time.” The Torah contains many stories, but they’re far
more than casual narrations. It’s a fundamental principle that every letter of
the Torah is rich with meaning.
Here’s an example: The Hebrew letter “bet” that begins the Torah is the first
letter of the Hebrew word bereshit (buh-ray-sheet; in the beginning). Often you’ll
see the first sentence of the Torah translated as “In the beginning God created
the heaven and the earth.” But the great Torah commentator Rashi (see Chapter
16 for more about him) says that the phrase should be read as, “In the beginning
of God’s creation of heaven and earth. . . .” In other words, God created the
beginning and therefore existed before the beginning. The great sages of Jewish
tradition teach that God is, was, and will be. God is beyond space and beyond
time. The Torah begins with the second letter of the Hebrew alphabet, not
the first, signifying that the Torah doesn’t begin at the beginning; it begins
when God created existence and time.
I offer this example to show you that the very first letter of the Torah is more
than just the start of the first word of a story. The letter itself contains a pro-
found teaching. Divine insight and wisdom lie within every letter and every
word and every so-called story in the Torah.
This doesn’t mean that the Torah is devoid of stories. There are lots of stories
in the Torah. But they’re more than just stories. The Torah is a message written
by God to the world.
The Torah isn’t a law book
One of the greatest misconceptions about the Torah comes from the mistrans-
lation of the word “Torah.” Too often throughout history the word has been
translated as “law,” when it should actually be translated as “instruction.”
The Torah is God’s instructions to the world.
53
Chapter 3: Examining the Treasures of the Torah

If you want to learn about the details of how to observe Jewish law, by the
way, don’t go to the Torah. The Five Books of Moses don’t give the details of
how a law is to be clearly understood and observed. And don’t go to the
Talmud, which is often thought to be the repository of Jewish law. Neither
the Torah nor the Talmud contains the specifics of how Jewish laws are to be
followed. Both the Five Books of Moses and the Talmud form the basis of
Jewish law, but Jewish law is to be found in the various codes of law com-
piled throughout Jewish history. One such compilation (in fact the most
authoritative one) is called the Shulchan Aruch (shool-khan ah-rookh; the
prepared table). It was compiled by Rabbi Joseph Karo in the 16th century.
The Shulchan Aruch has not been translated into English.
It may not contain Jewish laws, but the Torah certainly does contain lots of
commandments. And the Talmud certainly contains lots of discussions,
debates, and explanations on the commandments. But the Written Torah and
the Talmud (the record of the Oral Torah) contain the raw material from
which Jewish law is derived. Only a rabbi who’s highly trained in the correct
methodology of reading the Torah and Talmud is qualified to determine
Jewish law.
The Torah isn’t a history book
A fundamental principle regarding the Five Books of Moses is expressed in
this well-known saying among Torah scholars: “There is no earlier or later in
the Torah.” It means that the Torah isn’t a historical narration and isn’t in
chronological order.
This expression doesn’t mean, of course, that it’s impossible to find facts of
history within the Torah. After all, the story of the exodus of the Children of
Israel, for example, is a major part of the Torah and is basically the history of
the birth of the Jewish people as a growing family. The Torah contains the
earliest recorded history of the family history of the Jews. But the Torah is
not primarily a source for history; rather, it’s a spiritual document with the
purpose of communicating divine eternal wisdom.
The Torah isn’t literal (even 
though it’s essentially true)
An important principle repeated often in books of Jewish wisdom and Torah
commentaries can be found in many places in the Talmud: “The Torah speaks
in the language of man.” What this means is that when you read the Torah, you
need to be aware of the fact that just as in conversation and literature and
poetry, the literal meaning often limits your understanding of what’s being said.
54
Part I: The Torah 101 

For example, the saying “a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush” has
little practical meaning when taken literally. But as an expression taken as a
metaphor or an analogy, the statement has wisdom. It means that it’s better
to be satisfied with what you have than to risk losing it by trying (perhaps
unsuccessfully) to get something better. There’s truth to the expression, but
only when you break it open and discover its true meaning.
The Written Torah works in a similar way. By speaking in the language of
man, the Torah often makes a point, but taking it at face value misses the
point. However, when you understand how to read the text based on tradi-
tional teachings and the Oral Torah, the literal meaning falls away and you’re
left with the true meaning of the text.
The best example of the fact that Jews don’t read the Torah literally is the
famous quote, “An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth” (Leviticus 24:20).
According the Jewish tradition, taking this biblical phrase literally is totally
against Torah law! Jewish tradition interprets the Torah by using ancient
principles that go beyond the literal meanings of the words.
According to Jewish law, if I knock your tooth out, you don’t get to return the
favor. Rather, I have to compensate you monetarily for the injury I caused.
The rabbis suggest that “an eye for an eye” really refers to a system of mone-
tary compensation; payment is required for the injury, the pain, the cost of
medical care, and lost wages as well as the shame of it all.
Considering the Torah’s Commandments
The Written Torah is the cornerstone of Jewish life and law. The basic
commandments, principles, ideas, and teachings of Judaism are found in the
Written Torah (also known as the Five Books of Moses). In the following sections,
I introduce the commandments found in the Written Torah; I discuss these
commandments throughout this book, but if you would like a full listing of the
commandments on their own, see Appendixes B and C.
Halachah: The way to walk
The term for “Jewish law” in Hebrew is Halachah (ha-lah-khah; the way to walk).
Throughout the centuries, the great sages of Jewish tradition have consulted
both the Written and Oral Torahs in order to determine how God wants the
Children of Israel to act and behave. But it’s never enough to simply look into
the text and decide what God wants. The development of Jewish law is a com-
bination of both an understanding of the text as well as an understanding of
how to apply it to real life. For example, there’s only one appropriate and
acceptable answer to the question, “What is the Jewish view of abortion?” 
And that answer is, “Tell me the case!”

Chapter 3: Examining the Treasures of the Torah

Jewish law isn’t a static list of do’s and don’ts. The Torah provides both general
principles and details, but all the details in the world can’t easily fit into each
unique case of life. By understanding the Torah and how it communicates,
trained rabbis throughout the centuries have been able to determine the
Jewish way to walk, the halachah.
The three types of commandments: Rituals,
morals, and the mysterious
A key verse in the Torah lists the three basic types of commandments that
appear in the Torah. Deuteronomy 4:45 states, “These are the testimonies,
decrees and ordinances that Moses discussed with the Israelites when they
left Egypt.” The important words here are
 Testimonies or eidot (aye-dote): The testimonies referred to are religious
rituals. Jewish rituals are commandments from God that remind people
of important events in the life of the Jewish people or important spiritual
truths. The reasons for eidot are always indicated in the Torah. For example,
the wearing of tefillin (see Chapter 12) is a ritual that serves as a reminder
of the presence of God as well as a reminder to keep God, God’s Torah,
and God’s commandments in one’s mind and heart at all times.
 Decrees or chukim (khoo-keem): Decrees are the tough commandments
of the Torah. They’re the ones that don’t seem to have any rational reason
behind them. They aren’t commemorative of events or ideas like eidot,
and they aren’t obvious ethical teachings like mishpatim. An example of
one of the Torah’s chukim is the prohibition against combining wool and
linen in a garment. This commandment, known as shatnez (shot-nez), is
stated in the Torah: “Do not wear shatnez, wool and linen together”
(Deuteronomy 22:11).
It’s important to note that the great sages urge students of the Torah to
try to grasp the inner meaning of the many commandments that are
actually beyond human understanding. See Chapter 15 for details on
Torah analysis.
 Ordinances or mishpatim (mish-pah-teem): Ordinances (sometimes
referred to as “rules”) are the ethical commandments in the Torah.
These are the commandments that are self-evident, good ideas, and
moral or ethical acts. Mishpatim don’t really need justification because
they’re obvious to reasonable people. “Thou shall not murder” is an
example of one of the mishpatim.

Breaking down the 613 commandments
In the Talmud, the Jewish sages teach that there are 613 commandments in
the Torah (see Appendixes B and C for a list of these commandments). In a
sense, the idea of 613 commandments is misleading because there are actu-
ally thousands of correct and incorrect actions as taught by Jewish tradition.
But all the thousands of commandments grow out of the basic 613 command-
ments in the Five Books of Moses. A number of sages throughout Jewish his-
tory have made lists of these 613 commandments, and they sometimes differ
slightly. The list in this book is based on the teachings of Maimonides.
The term used to refer to these 613 commandments is Taryag (tar-yahg). It’s
an acronym made up of four Hebrew letters:
 Tav (T)
 Resh (R)
 Yud (Y)
 Gimmel (G)
Each letter in the Hebrew alphabet corresponds to a number (see Chapter
15), so taf is 400, resh is 200, yud is 10, and gimmel is 3. The four numbers
add up to 613.
The 613 commandments are the do’s and don’ts of the Torah. Here are some
of the many categories of commandments that have been identified:
 Positive commandments
 Negative commandments
 Time bound commandments (for specific times)
 Non–time bound commandments (for any time)
 Simple commandments (known as mitzvoth kallah)
 Complex commandments (known as mitzvoth chamurah)
 Rational commandments (mishpatim)
 Non-rational commandments (chukim)
 Ritual commandments (eidot)
 Commandments between humans and God
 Commandments for all Jews at all times
 Commandments for the priesthood only
57
Chapter 3: Examining the Treasures of the Torah

 Commandments for women only
 Commandments for all humankind
 Commandments for the King of Israel only
 Commandments in the Holy Temple
 Commandments for specific times and places
 Commandments that are constant
Another way to classify commandments (and the way in which I break them
down in Appendixes B and C) is by negative and positive:
 There are 365 negative commandments called mitzvoth lo ta’aseh (mitz-
vote low tah-ah-seh) in the Torah. By negative, I mean commandments
that tell you what not to do. They’re said to correspond to the 365 days
of the year. The symbolism of these commandments lies in the idea that,
according to the Torah, these prohibitions must be observed every day.
 There are 248 positive commandments called mitzvoth aseh (mitz-vote
ah-seh) in the Torah. By positive, I mean commandments that tell you
specific actions or beliefs that you must do. These commandments
correspond to the 248 parts of the body (as counted by the Talmudic
rabbis). The symbolism of these commandments lies in the idea that the
Torah is saying that the positive commandments must performed with a
wholeness of being. The Torah must be integrated into your life every
day and with your whole body.
One Jewish teaching says that all 248 positive commandments are contained
within the first of the Ten Commandments: “I am the Lord thy God,” and all
365 negative commandments are contained within the second of the Ten
Commandments: “Thou shall have no other gods before me.”

One by One: The
Books of the Torah

In this part . . .
T
he term “Torah” has a number of different meanings,
each of which I explain in this book. But the primary
meaning is the Five Books of Moses: Genesis, Exodus,
Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. In this part, I go
through each of the ﬁve books, almost page by page and
topic by topic, and provide you with a detailed overview
of each one. The Torah begins with the creation of the
world and ends with the Children of Israel about to enter
the Promised Land. The ﬁve chapters in this part take you
on the journey from pre-history to the death of Moses,
just before his people arrived in the Land of Israel.

“In the Beginning”: 
The Book of Genesis
In This Chapter
 Witnessing the creation of the universe
 Meeting Adam and Eve
 Telling the story of Noah and the Flood
 Understanding the story of the Tower of Babel
 Getting to know Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Sarah, Rebecca, Rachel, and Leah
 Becoming familiar with Joseph, the Jewish leader of Egypt
T
he first book of the Torah (which is also the first book of the Bible) is
commonly known as the book of Genesis. The word “Genesis,” which means
“creation or birth,” is Greek and comes from the ancient Greek translation of
the Torah from its original Hebrew; that Greek work is known as the Septuagint.
Among the Jewish people, the book of Genesis is called Bereshit (buh-ray-sheet;
in the beginning), which is the very first word of the Torah.
The book of Genesis is the story of the birth of the universe and also the birth
of the Jewish people, originally known as the Children of Israel. As you find
out in this chapter, the patriarch Jacob was ultimately renamed Israel, and
Jews are the descendants of his children and his children’s children, down to
the present. This is why all Jews today are the Children of Israel.
In this overview of the book of Genesis, I focus on the main characters, the
most important ones being the three patriarchs of Judaism: Abraham, Isaac,
and Jacob. It’s crucial to be aware of the fact that the three patriarchs had
wives (and concubines) and that these women are also significant personali-
ties not only in the Torah text but also in the commentaries. For example,
Abraham’s wife, Sarah, is considered the mother of the Jewish people; when a
woman converts to Judaism, her name is changed and she becomes the
“daughter of our mother Sarah.” Isaac’s wife, Rebecca, and Jacob’s wives,
Leah and Rachel, join Sarah, and as a group, these four women are known as
the four matriarchs of Judaism. These four women were strong and wise and
became spiritual leaders of the Jewish people along with their husbands.

The book of Genesis is filled with episodes and stories and is rich with detail.
It’s impossible to summarize the entire book in just one chapter of The Torah
For Dummies. In fact, because the Torah often uses multiple words to mean
so much more than is literally written, a summary of every story would use
far more words than this book itself! In this chapter, I explain a selection of
some of the key characters, episodes, and stories found in the book of
Genesis. Some who are very familiar with Genesis may wonder why I choose
some incidents, descriptions, and stories and leave others out, or why I omit
key details from my selections. The answer is that I include some of the more
well-known events and stories in Genesis as well as some of my favorites to
give you a taste of the kinds of timeless and prophetic tales that appear in the
first book of the Torah.
Before You Begin: Approaching
the Story of Creation
A friend of mine once asked me, “Does Judaism have a creation myth?” Being
one of those people who often answers a question with another question, I
said, “What do you mean by the word ‘myth’?” My friend responded, “You
know, a made-up story that foolish people claim to be true.”
Well, the Torah does have an account of the creation of existence and the cre-
ation of the world, but many contend that a “made-up” story can be more
true than a so-called true story. The story of Creation as it appears in the
Torah may be of interest to fools, but it has also been contemplated by
geniuses, including some of the greatest minds in Jewish history.
Anyone who reads novels or watches movies quickly finds out that a work of
the imagination often captures reality — inner reality, that is — more accurately
than the daily newspaper, for example. What happens in a person’s life has
much more to do with what’s occurring beneath the surface — in emotions,
memories, experiences, and dreams. A story or tale can capture the unseen
reality of lives with far more accuracy than the most-objective reporter or the
highest-quality camera.
It’s in this light that I approach the account of Creation in the Torah — and the
entire Torah, for that matter. Moses, the “author” of the Five Books of Moses, is
considered by Jewish tradition to be the greatest prophet who ever lived. And
a prophet is someone who experiences a profound level of consciousness that
makes it possible to receive images and communications from God; God com-
municates to a prophet in ways that humans can grasp. The story of Creation
and the entire Torah is the result of a prophetic experience by the greatest of
prophets. You don’t look to the Torah for scientific information or objective
history. Rather, the Torah communicates deeper and more profound messages
from the Creator.
62
Part II: One by One: The Books of the Torah 

You can spend a lifetime studying the amazing books that brilliant Torah
scholars have written over the centuries on just on the first few lines in the
Torah. In Jewish tradition, this field of study is called Ma’aseh Bereshit (mah-
ah-she buh-ray-sheet; the Work of Creation). Jewish law actually urges the
study of Creation (as found in the Torah) to be done one-on-one, with a
teacher of the Work of Creation teaching only one student at a time. The
words, their meanings, and their relationships to each other give expression
to an abstract vision of the elements of Creation itself, and an understanding
of this process leads to an understanding of oneself. Jewish theology sees the
human as a microcosm of the whole of Creation, so by addressing the elements
that God used to create the world, the Torah provides students with information
on the same elements that comprise humankind.
The book of Genesis begins, “In the beginning God created heaven and earth.
The earth was without form and empty, with darkness on the face of the
deep, but God’s spirit moved on the water’s surface” (Genesis 1:1–2). This is
only the first sentence, and when combined with the traditions in the Oral
Torah (see Chapter 3), deep concentration, analysis, and scholarship, each
word is revealed as being rich with meaning and containing profound insight.
For general information on studying the Torah and using helpful commentaries,
see Chapters 15 and 16.
Get Going: God Creates the World
As I mention in the previous section, the book of Genesis starts with these
words: “In the beginning God created heaven and earth. The earth was without
form and empty, with darkness on the face of the deep, but God’s spirit
moved on the water’s surface” (Genesis 1:1–2). What happened next? Keep
reading to find out.
Setting up took six days
The Torah teaches that it took God six days to complete Creation (Genesis
1:1–31). Please don’t get hung up on evolution and whether the whole thing
really took less than a week. By definition God can do anything, so God
certainly could complete Creation in any amount of time.
The Torah’s concerns are more spiritual than scientific. The Torah is deeply
practical and offers teachings on every aspect of physical life. But the Torah
is both physical and metaphysical in that it explores spiritual questions and
concerns such as: Who am I? Where did I come from? Where am I going?
What for? Why? For centuries, Torah students have been captivated by the
study of the six stages of creation as found in the Torah, and the commentaries
are rich with meaning.
63
Chapter 4: “In the Beginning”: The Book of Genesis

Here’s how Creation unfolds in the book of Genesis:
 First day: Light, Day, Night
 Second day: Sky, Water Below the Sky, Water Above the Sky, Heaven
 Third day: Earth, Seas, Vegetation, Seed-bearing Plants, Fruit Trees
 Fourth day: Sun, Moon, Stars
 Fifth day: Living creatures of all kinds (except humans)
 Sixth day: Adam, an androgynous being (I talk about Adam later in this
chapter)
The important commentaries all connect each day of the week with one of the
seven “lower attributes,” as they’re sometimes called in the books of Kabbalah,
the Jewish traditional teachings on God. The seven lower attributes combine to
form the constant downpour of divine light as it creates and sustains the world.
For example, the seventh day of the week, known in the Torah as Shabbat
(shah-baht; the Sabbath), corresponds to the seventh of the lower divine
attributes, known as malchut (mahl-khoot; kingdom). The more you understand
the significance of malchut and its relationship to the other divine attributes,
the more you pierce the surface of the Torah text to explore the secrets of
Creation.
God rested on the seventh day
The Torah says that after the six stages of Creation, God stopped, looked at
Creation, and said that it was “very good” (Genesis: 1:31). The seventh day, the
day God stopped the initial Creation, is known as Shabbat. The Torah says,
“God rested on the seventh day from all the work that He had been doing”
(Genesis 2:2).
The great Torah commentaries say that before Creation, there was no existence.
The original pattern of Creation, with God actively constructing existence,
consisted of six stages of activity followed by one stage of stillness. This
pattern ultimately became the basis of the Jewish view of time. Traditional
Jewish life based in the Torah is a life in which time centers around Shabbat,
the echo of the stillness that followed God’s work with the Creation.
The human calendar is based on this pattern of seven, with seven days making
up the week. In Jewish thought, there are six days and then there’s Shabbat,
which corresponds with Saturday on the calendar but actually begins Friday
night and ends Saturday night. More importantly, Shabbat isn’t even really
considered a day; rather, it’s a different level of time that’s more unlike the
other days than similar to them. Shabbat may feel like a day, but in Jewish
tradition, it’s an oasis from time when stillness reigns and Jews celebrate as
though they were royalty in the Palace of the King of King of Kings. See
Chapter 11 for more on Shabbat and the general concept of time in the Torah.
64
Part II: One by One: The Books of the Torah 

It Takes Two: Adam and Eve
Before there was Adam and Eve, there was one being, Adam, who the Torah
says was created by God. The Hebrew word Adam (ah-dahm) shares the
same linguistic root as the Hebrew word adama (ah-dah-mah; earth). The
Torah says that unlike the other living creatures, each of which God created
out of nothing, “God formed man out of the dust of the ground” (Genesis 2:7).
The creation of woman followed shortly thereafter. The Torah calls Eve by
the Hebrew word Chava (khah-vah; life).
Turning dust and breath 
into body and soul
God made Adam by forming him out of the dust of the earth and by breathing
what the Torah calls nishmat chaim (nish-maht khah-yeem; the spirit of life)
into the body (Genesis 2:7). Torah scholars point out that the Oral Torah
explains that this spirit is actually the soul. Humans, according to the Torah’s
view, are made of body and soul.
 The body comes from the earth and ultimately returns to the earth after
death.
 The soul comes directly from God, and it lives on after the death of the
body.
People aren’t bodies with souls but rather are souls with bodies. The soul
existed before the body, it uses the body as an instrument, and then the soul
drops the body and continues on.
Splitting male and female
If you were to ask most people how females were created according to the
Bible, they would probably say that Eve was made from Adam’s rib. But the
actual text doesn’t explain it that way. Rather, the Torah says that first the
human was made androgynous, meaning both male and female. One of the
most mysterious verses in the Torah states, “In the image of God, He created
him, male and female He created them” (Genesis 1:27).
Several verses later, the Torah says, “God then made man fall into a deep
state of unconsciousness and he slept. He took one of his sides and closed
the flesh in its place. God built the side that he took from the man into a
woman and He brought her to the man” (Genesis 2:21–22). The authoritative
Torah commentator Rashi establishes that the traditional understanding of
“side” refers not to a body part but rather to the idea that the original “man”
65
Chapter 4: “In the Beginning”: The Book of Genesis

was split into two sides. This verse establishes one of the pillars of thought in
the Jewish concept of marriage: Each person is really half and in coupling
becomes, in a sense, whole.
Avoiding the Tree of Knowledge
of Good and Evil
The Torah tells that Adam and Eve lived in Gan Eden (gahn aye-den; the
Garden of Eden), a perfect environment. Jewish thought represents the view
that the Garden of Eden exists at both the beginning and the end of time:
Humans began in a perfect environment, and man’s goal is to rebuild the
imperfect world and return it to its pristine state. Jewish thought sees the
world as incomplete and in need of human participation to repair the world
and make it whole again.
One of the deep and profound riddles of the book of Genesis surrounds God’s
statement, “You may definitely eat from every tree of the garden, but from the
Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil do not eat, for on the day you eat from it
you will die” (Genesis 2:17). Jewish scholars and students of the Torah under-
stand this image in many ways.
One profound interpretation of this verse explains that humans don’t always
know good from bad. What often seems like a good event in fact may be the
beginning of a bad event, and vice versa. One example is lottery winners; many
lottery winners who suddenly become wealthy ultimately tell sad stories of
misfortunes resulting from the sudden windfall. Others see this verse as
referring to God’s desire that humans work at the struggle to know how to
choose freely and correctly rather than just “eat” of that knowledge without
doing the necessary work.
Only God knows true good and true evil. Only God has the infinite vantage
point to be able to see the results of things clearly. Despite the free will given
to people by God, God sees what will be. As the great Talmudic sage teaches,
“All is foreseen and free will is given.” But when humans think they have
quickly eaten (by which I mean that they think they understand) what’s good
and evil, the arrogance of such a posture often spells trouble.
Falling to the temptation of the serpent
The story of Adam and Eve includes the serpent or snake, which is a symbol
of temptation and evil. The Torah says, “Now the snake was cunning beyond
every beast of the field that God had made” (Genesis 3:1). The snake cunningly
involves Eve and then Adam in the eating of the forbidden Tree of Knowledge
66
Part II: One by One: The Books of the Torah 

of Good and Evil. When Eve encountered the snake, she said of the Tree, “You
shall neither eat it nor touch it” (Genesis 3:3). Drawing from this story, Jewish
thought understands the human situation as a constant struggle between two
urges found in each person’s being — a good urge and an evil urge.
An exploration of the primal sin, the function of the serpent and the result of
the whole episode, forms the basis of Judaism’s understanding of human inner
struggle. This seemingly fanciful tale is really the basis of the subtle and com-
plex Jewish understanding of human psychology and the human predicament.
Also, it’s important to keep in mind that Jewish commentaries on the Torah
don’t view the sin of the Garden of Eden as a sexual sin.
The result of Adam’s and Eve’s failure to follow God’s command not to be
tempted by things that are inappropriate or forbidden is that God tossed Adam
and Eve out of the Garden of Eden. The Torah says, “God banished him from
the Garden of Eden, to work the soil from which he was taken” (Genesis 3:23).
Sibling Rivalry: Cain and Abel
Adam and Eve’s first two children were Cain and Abel. The Torah says that
“Abel became a shepherd and Cain became a tiller of the ground” (Genesis 4:2).
When it came time for each of them to present an offering to God, Cain offered
fruit from the ground, and Abel offered the firstborn of his flocks. Then the
Torah offers a mysterious line: “God turned to Abel and to his offering, but to
Cain and his offering He did not turn” (Genesis 4:4–5).
God told Cain, who was disappointed in God’s rebuff, that he needed to
improve himself. Cain then confronted Abel and murdered him. When God
asked Cain where his brother was, Cain spoke one of the most well-known
lines in the Torah, “Am I my brother’s keeper?”
Cain and Abel are the first human beings to be born of human parents, and
they’re the first pair of siblings, the first brothers. They’re also involved in
the first murder. (That’s a lot of firsts!) But there’s great spiritual significance
in the very first fully human episode in the Torah. The Torah teaches that the
greatest human pleasure is nearness to God, and the proper perspective on
life has God at the center. Viewed in this light, there’s a vast difference
between the symbolic offering of Cain with his rather lowly “fruit from the
ground” and Abel’s offering of “firstborn of his flocks.” Torah commentators
also explain that the occupation of shepherd symbolically represents a
profession that allows for contemplation of God, whereas a tiller of land often
becomes a worshipper of the earth and not God.
67
Chapter 4: “In the Beginning”: The Book of Genesis

When It Rains, It Pours: 
Noah and the Flood
There’s an old joke about a rabbi who was in a hospital bed next to an atheist.
The atheist said to the rabbi, “Oh rabbi with your silly beliefs. Don’t you know
that there are dozens of cultures that have an ancient flood myth!?” The rabbi
replied, “That makes me feel so much better. I’ve often wondered how nobody
heard of the Flood except we Jews. Now that I know others have also heard
about it, I’m sure it happened.”
Whether the Flood actually happened or not, it’s a story that has captivated
the imaginations of countless children and adults for many centuries. I give
you an overview of the story in the following sections.
A 40-day trip on the high seas
Basically, the story of Noah and the Flood says that the world was filled with
wicked people and God saw that Noah was the most righteous. As the Torah
says, “God saw that the wickedness was great . . . but Noah found grace in the
eyes of God” (Genesis 6:5–8). God decided to send a Flood that essentially
wiped away the first experiment and allowed the human family to begin
again. God commanded Noah to build a huge boat, an ark, in preparation for
the Flood. Noah, his wife, his sons, and their wives joined a sampling of every
animal for 40 days while the rains turned to floods and wiped out the rest of
the humans and animals in the world.
You may be wondering: Did Noah really take two of each kind of animal with
him on the ark? When I was a librarian working at the reference desk of a
public library, I occasionally got phone calls that librarians call “bar bets.”
The assumption is that two people are sitting at a bar (or elsewhere) and get
into a debate over some fact, which prompts them to call the library to get
the answer. Well, here’s a good bar bet: Bet someone that Noah didn’t take
two of each kind of animal into the ark but instead took two of each “unclean”
animal and seven of each “clean” animal. (A clean animal can be used in the
Holy Temple as a sacrifice. See Chapter 6 for more about Temple sacrifices.)
Common knowledge of the story of Noah and the Flood says that Noah took
two of each species with him. But if you check the Torah, you find that it
says, “God said to Noah, ‘Come into the ark, you and your family . . . Take
seven pair of every clean animal, and of the animal that is not clean, two, a
male and its mate . . .” (Genesis 7:1–2).
68
Part II: One by One: The Books of the Torah 

The rainbow covenant
As a result of the Flood, “All flesh that walked the earth perished” (Genesis
7:21). When the rains stopped and the water subsided, God spoke to Noah,
saying, “Leave the ark, you along with your wife, your sons, and your sons’
wives. Take out with you every living creature . . .” (Genesis 8:15–16).
The human race began again but this time with a promise from God. The Torah
says that God said to Noah and his sons, “I am making a covenant with you and
with your offspring after you. It will include every living creature that is with
you among the birds, the livestock, and all the beasts of the earth . . . all life will
never be cut short by the waters of a flood. There will never again be a flood to
destroy the earth” (Genesis 9:9–11).
The statement and promise from God has become known as the rainbow
covenant because, in reference to that promise, God said, “I have placed My
rainbow in the clouds and it shall be a sign of the covenant between Me and
the earth.”
The sons of Noah
Throughout this book, I explain that the Torah is filled with commandments
and that the Jewish people are obligated to observe them by doing the positive
commandments and avoiding the negative commandments. (See Appendixes B
and C for more about these commandments.) The idea that the Jews are the
chosen people has nothing to do with any belief in superiority. In the Torah,
the Jewish people are chosen by God for more burdens and responsibilities,
not for privileges.
Through a careful analysis of the Torah text along with the oral tradition,
Jewish tradition teaches that there are seven universal laws, commonly known
as the Noahide Laws, that were commanded of the sons of Noah and are now
incumbent on all humankind. These seven laws aren’t listed in the Written
Torah; they’re named and elucidated in the Talmud. They are as follows:
 Idolatry is forbidden.
 Incestuous and adulterous relations are forbidden.
 Murder is forbidden.
 Cursing the name of God is forbidden.
 Theft is forbidden.
 Eating the flesh of a living animal is forbidden.
 Mankind is commanded to establish courts of justice.
69
Chapter 4: “In the Beginning”: The Book of Genesis

The story of Noah’s sons in Genesis doesn’t stop there. The entire tenth chapter
of the book of Genesis (10:1–32) is sometimes referred to as the Table of Nations
because it gives the genealogies of two of Noah’s three sons, Ham and Japheth.
These families’ trees, consisting of dozens of names, form the basis of the view
that after the Flood, the descendants of Noah spread throughout the world and
established families and ultimately nations. Ham’s family settled in northern
Africa, and Japheth’s family settled in Europe.
Noah’s third son was Shem, and it’s from Shem that Jews, Arabs, and others,
descend. The term “Semite” comes from the Greek translation of Shem, which
is Sem.
Reach for the Sky: The Tower of Babel
The English word “babble,” meaning incomprehensible sounds coming from a
person’s mouth, comes from the story in the book of Genesis about the
Tower of Babel. The Torah explains that at one time everyone in the world
spoke the same language. A unity existed among the people of the world, but
unity turned to arrogance when some people got the idea that they could
conquer God.
The Torah says, “They said to each other, ‘Come let us mold bricks and fire
them.’ They then had bricks to use as stone, and asphalt for mortar. They
said, ‘Come, let us build ourselves a city, and a tower whose top shall reach
the sky. Let us make ourselves a name . . .’” (Genesis 11:3–4).
Torah commentaries point out that by trying to build a tower to God, human
arrogance destroyed the peace and unity in the world. Before the tower, God
and humans maintained their proportions. But because of the attempt to
disrupt this original combination, God punished the people by scattering
them both geographically and through the development of many languages.
The Torah says, “Come, let us descend and confuse their speech” (Genesis
11:7). (The commentators say that the “us” in this verse are the angels.)
The story of Babel helps explain why the humble position is honored in
Jewish thought. One way this translates into daily experience is that people
are supposed to teach themselves that they’re just a small piece of a vast
universe and simply can’t understand God’s ways. God’s thoughts aren’t
human thoughts; God’s logic isn’t human logic. There’s no way for humans to
grasp the universe as God does. By cultivating a humble view, humanity ulti-
mately looks more realistically at its capacities and limitations. By trying to
reach the sky with the Tower of Babel, human arrogance took over and
attempted to fool itself.

Part II: One by One: The Books of the Torah 

Father Figure: The Story of Abraham
The book of Genesis contains many genealogies. Even people who aren’t that
familiar with the Bible are vaguely aware of all the “begats” in the text. One of
the most striking family trees appearing in the Torah is the continuous line
traced from Adam and Eve to one of the three patriarchs of Judaism, Abraham.
Before I delve into the story of Abraham, it’s important to clear up a common
misconception about Abraham. It’s often said that Abraham was the inventor
of monotheism, the belief in one God, and that before Abraham there were
pagans, and then Abraham came and introduced the idea of God to the world.
As my teacher points out, Abraham was surely not the inventor of an idea
called monotheism. God isn’t an idea that someone invented; God is the
Creator and Ruler of the universe, and God was known long before Abraham,
by Adam and Eve, Noah, and others. It seems that in Abraham’s birthplace of
Ur and in many other places in the world, knowledge of God was forgotten
and idolatry blossomed. So Abraham didn’t invent God; he simply reminded
the world that there’s one nameless, formless, all knowing, all powerful,
omnipresent God, and that although generally hidden from the world, God is
nevertheless always present and the mover of everything. (As for pagans, they
aren’t people who lived a long time ago. Pagans, as one common definition
suggests, are people who deny God’s existence.)
Abraham (whose original name was Abram — more on that later in this chapter)
was born in the city of Ur, whose remnants can be found today in Iraq. The
son of Terach, he lived in a community of idolaters. The Torah records a
pivotal moment in Abraham’s life, and this episode ultimately became 
a pivotal moment in the history of humankind.
Abram gets a call and leaves town
In Genesis 12, this previously unknown man named Abram heard the voice of
God saying, “Go for yourself away from your land, from your birthplace, and
from your father’s house, to the land that I will show you. I will make you into
a great nation. I will bless you and make you great. You shall become a bless-
ing. I will bless those who bless you, and he who curses you I will curse. All
the families of the earth will be blessed through you” (Genesis 12:1–3).
The call from God begins with the Hebrew words lech l’cha (lekh leh-khah; go
for yourself). Torah commentators point out that this unusual phrase, which
could easily have just been “Go” rather than “Go for yourself,” teaches that
this call from God was for Abram’s own benefit. He needed to leave the pagan
environment of his family, but he needed to take a great risk. Of course, when
God speaks directly to you, it’s more of a risk to disobey God’s charge than to
do what He says.
71
Chapter 4: “In the Beginning”: The Book of Genesis

In any event, the call from God to Abram urged him to leave his home and
become the father of a great nation, the Children of Israel, the Jewish people.
Abram left his home and began his journey, which begins in the Torah with
Genesis 12:1. He went
 From Ur to Haran (near the border of today’s Turkey and Syria): Haran
was Abram’s first stop. It was already a well-settled area, so Abram
moved on in search of a better place to settle.
 From Haran to Shechem (a few miles from Nablus in modern Israel’s
West Bank): Shechem was Abram’s first stop in the Holy Land, and the
Torah says that he built an altar there but then moved on in search of
the right place to settle.
 From Shechem to Bethel (also in modern Israel’s West Bank): Bethel is
10 miles north of Jerusalem and 20 miles south of Shechem and was one
of the highest points in the region. Abram built an altar there (as he did
in Shechem) and left the place, although he would eventually return.
 From Bethel to Egypt: Abram was prompted to go to Egypt because of a
famine, and he planned to stay there until the famine ended. In Egypt,
Abram and Sarah got entangled in a little difficulty. Because Sarah was
beautiful, the Pharaoh’s assistants brought her to the Pharaoh.
Fortunately, Abram and Sarah miraculously managed to escape the
Pharaoh’s advances (Genesis 12:10–20).
 From Egypt to Bethel: Lot, Abram’s nephew, went with Abram and his
family to Egypt. Then God commanded Abram to go back to the Holy
Land, so they returned to Bethel. At a certain point, it became clear that
Abram and Lot could no longer live together because they both had siz-
able flocks and their shepherds argued. Abram gave Lot the choice of
where to live. Lot headed to the southeast, near the cities of Sodom and
Gomorrah (Genesis 13:10–12).
 From Bethel to Hebron (in modern Israel’s West Bank): Abram settled in
Hebron, and that’s where you can visit his tomb.
Abram and Sarai become 
Abraham and Sarah
Abram’s original name was a contraction of av Aram, meaning “the father of
Aram,” which was his native country. In Genesis 17:5, the Torah explains that
God changed Avram’s name to Avraham, a contraction of av hamon, or “the
father of a multitude,” because Abraham ultimately became the direct ancestor
of millions of Jews, Arabs, and others.
Sarah, Avraham’s wife and the first matriarch of the Jewish people, was originally
named Sarai, which means “my princess.” In Genesis 17:15, the Torah explains
that God changed her name to Sarah, a change in spelling and pronunciation
72
Part II: One by One: The Books of the Torah 

that changes the meaning of the name to “princess to all the nations of the
world.” In both cases, the name changes were the result of adding the fifth
letter “hey,” which traditionally represents the name of God. Much of the
heart of the book of Genesis is the story of Abraham and Sarah, their off-
spring, and their fate.
God’s covenant with Abraham
The Hebrew word brit (brit; covenant) is also the term used for ritual
circumcision in Jewish life. The Torah explains the connection between the
two meanings in Genesis 17:9–14. God promises Abraham that
 Abraham will be the father of a great nation.
 Abraham shall be a blessing.
 Abraham will be given, for eternity, the land of Canaan (also known as the
Holy Land, the Land of Israel, and the Promised Land) for his descendants.
 Abraham’s descendants will be as numerous as the stars in the sky.
 Abraham’s descendants will be in a foreign land for 400 years (foreshad-
owing of the slavery of the Children of Israel in Egypt; see Chapter 5).
 Abraham and God will have a covenant that will last for eternity.
And what will Abraham do in exchange? God commands that, in return,
Abraham will circumcise himself and all his male descendants shall be
circumcised, and he and his descendants will walk with God — meaning that
they will promote knowledge of God in the world, will have faith in God, will
believe in God, will trust in God, and will work to better know God. Abraham
agreed and circumcised himself (he was 99 years old). The sign of this
covenant, this promise between God and Abraham, was the circumcision,
and to this day it’s a strict requirement both for Jews at the age of eight days
and for all males who convert to Judaism to be circumcised. (Turn to Chapter
12 for more about the subject of circumcision.)
The destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah
In Genesis 18, the Torah describes the sins of the cities Sodom (where Abraham’s
nephew Lot settled) and nearby Gomorrah. The Torah tells of three angels who
were sent to inflict divine vengeance on the residents of the cities. Abraham
accompanied them in the direction of Sodom; two of the angels went to the city
of Sodom, and the third stayed with Abraham and told Abraham of the coming
destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah. Abraham prayed (Genesis 18:23–26)
that if 50 righteous persons were found in the city, it should be spared.
Gradually, he reduced the number to ten, but not even ten righteous men
73
Chapter 4: “In the Beginning”: The Book of Genesis

could be found (or God, in answer to his prayers, would have averted his
design). Lot, the only man deserving, was spared.
The modern word “sodomy,” referring to a variety of “unnatural” or non-
procreation-oriented sexual acts, unfortunately perpetuates the popular false
notion that the sin of the wicked ancient city of Sodom described in the Torah
was a sexual sin. Both cities of Sodom and Gomorrah are described as sinful
cities, but the Torah text in combination with the Oral Torah provides a clear
vision of Sodom and, by association, Gomorrah as well. What emerges from
careful analysis of the holy texts is surely a picture of a sinful city, but the sins
of the city of Sodom and Gomorrah were insensitivity to others, perversions
of justice, excessive wealth, conformity, and cruelty.
The Birth and Binding of Isaac
The Torah says that Sarah was childless, so she offered Hagar, a concubine,
to be the mother of Abraham’s child, and Hagar gave birth to Ishmael. In her
old age, Sarah finally gave birth to Isaac. Abraham was 100 years old when
Isaac was born, and Sarah was 90. In response to giving birth at such an old
age, the Torah says that Sarah declared, “God has given me laughter” (Genesis
21:6). Isaac, or Yitzchak (yihtz-khak) in Hebrew, means “he will laugh.”
Abraham’s son Isaac is the second of the three patriarchs in Jewish tradition.
The book of Genesis includes many stories about the patriarchs, and perhaps
the most challenging one deals with Abraham and Isaac. Known in Jewish
tradition as the Akedah (ah-kay-dah; binding), the Torah story of the binding
of Isaac is a pivotal one in Jewish life, Jewish liturgy, and Jewish scholarship.
In a nutshell, Genesis 22:1–19 says that God commanded Abraham to sacrifice
(and therefore kill) his son Isaac on an altar. Abraham and Isaac were prepared
to go through with it when God stopped Abraham and an animal took the
place of the sacrifice; Isaac was spared, and Abraham was spared from
having to slaughter and sacrifice his son.
A myth that I’m happy to correct is that the meaning of this story is not an
indication of a historical moment when human sacrifice was eliminated from
the rituals of ancient people. According to the great Torah commentaries, the
story is about the boundaries of faith, belief, trust in God. The Oral Torah
teaches that “With Ten Trials was our father Abraham tried, and he stood firm
through all of them” (Mishnah, Ethics of the Fathers 5:4). Ten different events
described in the Torah are singled out by the sages as Abraham’s ten tests.
 The first test was God’s call to Abraham to leave his home (which I cover
earlier in this chapter in the section “Abram gets a call and leaves town”).
 The last test was God instructing Abraham to sacrifice his son Isaac in
perhaps the ultimate test of faith. Many commentators have taught that
74
Part II: One by One: The Books of the Torah 

Abraham knew two things at once: That God wouldn’t allow Abraham to
go through with the sacrifice; and that Abraham still had to go through
the process, listen to God, be prepared to do what God commanded, and
show his absolute faith and obedience to God.
Based on the Torah, Judaism takes the fundamental position that, as with
Abraham, life for each human is a series of tests of trials given by God for
their benefit. All trials, from the smallest frustration to the greatest tragedy,
are really for the best even though you can’t always see them that way. A
basic tenant of Jewish faith is the principle that God knows what He is both
doing and allowing and that the tests you face are for the benefit of your soul.
The Story of Jacob
Isaac’s son Jacob is the third of the three patriarchs of Judaism, but he holds
a particularly special place in the history of the Jewish people, spiritually and
otherwise, because he fathered 12 sons whose descendants eventually
became the nation of Israel.
Jacob and his twin brother Esau, born to Isaac and his wife Rebecca, were at
odds with each other even before they were born (“the children struggled
together within her” [Genesis 25:22]). Before their birth, God spoke to
Rebecca and told her that she would have twins and that the older would
serve the younger (Genesis 25:23).
Jacob and Esau had very different personalities. Jacob valued the tradition of
his ancestors, but Esau did not. Jacob was gentle and studious, whereas Esau
was a harsh man and a hunter. Although Esau was the older twin, he sold his
birthright to Jacob in exchange for some food following an unsuccessful
hunting trip (Genesis 25:29–34).
When Isaac was old and blind, he sent for his oldest son Esau in order to offer
his son a blessing, but Isaac’s younger son, Jacob, at the encouragement of
Rebecca (his mother and the wife of Isaac), fooled his blind father into thinking
that he was Esau and received the blessing. As the Torah says, “Rebecca then
took her older son Esau’s best clothing and put them on her younger son Jacob”
(Genesis 27:15). This episode is of great interest to commentators as they
explain what this apparent moment of deception by Jacob actually means. This
story, like so many from the Torah, contains explorations of deep mysteries
about the human condition, the nature of good and evil, and the path of God.
The deception in this story isn’t a legal detail in the Torah; what I mean is that
it doesn’t give permission to be deceptive or to lie. Both the Written Torah
and the Oral Torah contain strict laws on the requirement of honesty in one’s
life and dealings.
75
Chapter 4: “In the Beginning”: The Book of Genesis

Many verses before the story of this great deception, the Torah tells of the
birth of these twins and says, “God’s word to her was, ‘Two nations are in
your womb . . . the greater one will serve the younger’” (Genesis 25:23). The
commentators point out that, in helping Jacob deceive Isaac, Rebecca was
merely doing what was necessary to help Jacob fulfill the message that she
received from God.
But the central message in the story comes from an understanding of the
differences between the nature of Jacob and the nature of Esau. The Torah
quotes Jacob as saying, “But my brother, Esau is a hairy man and I am a
smooth skinned man” (Genesis 27:11). The vast differences between the twins
are what occupies the Oral Torah’s discussions of Esau. Jacob is the refined,
educated scholar who’s faithful to God. The Oral Torah describes Esau as an
evil man who attacked Jacob while they were in the womb. The sages speak of
his insults to women as well as his murderous, bloodthirsty nature.
A well-known story in the book of Genesis is Jacob’s dream. According to
Jewish tradition a dream in the Torah is considered prophecy. The Torah
says of Jacob, “He dreamed that . . . a ladder was standing on the ground and
its top reached toward heaven . . . and angels of God were ascending and
descending on it” (Genesis 28:12). The great Torah sages suggest that the
ladder is a symbol of Mount Sinai, indicating that the Torah is the connection
between heaven and earth, God and people.
Jacob also is involved with the great love story of the Torah. He wanted to
marry a girl named Rachel and worked seven years to earn the right, but at
the wedding her older sister Leah was secretly put in her place by their
father. Jacob then worked another seven years to marry Rachel. Jacob also
had two concubines, Bilhah and Zilpah. These four women bore him 12 sons
and one daughter, Dina (Genesis 35:22–26). With the exception of Levi, whose
descendants served a sacred function in the Holy Temple (see Chapter 6),
and Josef, each of Jacob’s sons became the head of one of the Twelve Tribes
of Israel (see Chapter 7): Reuven, Shimon, Yehuda, Issachar, Zebulun, Dan,
Naphtali, Gad, Asher, and Benjamin. The sons of Josef (also spelled Joseph),
Manasseh and Ephraim, each became the head of a tribe of their own, while
the descendants of Levi were not a separate tribe, totaling 12 tribes in all.
Losing track of all these people is easy, but rest easy; Figure 4-1 shows the
family tree of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Jacob’s many sons.
In the last part of his story, Jacob wrestled with an angel, and in the process,
God changed his name to Israel. The Torah says that “Jacob was alone and a
strange man wrestled with him until just before dawn. When the man saw
that he could not defeat him, he touched the upper joint of Jacob’s thigh.
76
Part II: One by One: The Books of the Torah 

Jacob’s hip joint became dislocated as he wrestled with the man” (Genesis
32:25–26). The man wanted to leave, but Jacob held him. Before Jacob let the
man go, Jacob asked for a blessing. When asked for his name, Jacob told him,
and the man said, “Your name will no longer be Jacob, but Yisra’el” (yis-rah-ail;
one who wrestles with God) (Genesis 32:29). The great Torah commentators
teach that the man was an angel and that just as Jacob was hurt but only
temporarily, the Jewish people suffer loses but always emerge with great
strength and blessings.

Chapter 4: “In the Beginning”: The Book of Genesis

Introducing Joseph, Jacob’s Favorite Son
The book of Genesis ends with the story of Jacob’s favorite son, Joseph
(Genesis 37:1–50:26). Joseph’s brothers sold him into slavery as a boy
because they were jealous of Joseph’s status in the family and of Joseph’s
dreams about his brothers bowing down to him. They were also jealous of
the coat of many colors that Jacob gave him.
The person who bought Joseph sold him again to Potiphar, a leader of Egypt.
In Egypt, Joseph gained a position of authority in the household of Potiphar
by the will of God. The Torah says, “God was with Joseph, and God made him
very successful” (Genesis 39:2); he was later imprisoned when Potiphar’s
wife wanted to have sexual relations with Joseph and Joseph refused. She
falsely accused him of attempted rape. Of her account, the Torah says, “He
came to rape me but I screamed as loud as I could” (Genesis 39:14).
Joseph earned a reputation as an interpreter of dreams and was released
from prison after wisely and correctly interpreting the Pharaoh’s dream. The
Pharaoh renamed him Zaphnath-paaneah (Genesis 41:45) and ultimately
appointed Joseph in charge of all Egypt. Some Torah commentators say the
name Zaphnath-paaneah means “revealer of secrets,” whereas others suggest
different meanings including “Lord of life.”
According to the Torah, Joseph recognized his brothers when they came to
Egypt looking for food during a famine. After some tense moments, he invited
them to settle in Egypt. The rest of their family, including Jacob, joined them
in Egypt, and the story continues in the book of Exodus, which I cover in
Chapter 5.

espite the popular view that the Jewish people are a religion, the Jewish
people are essentially a family. To be Jewish has nothing to do with
subscribing to a religion, which makes it different from other religions. For
example, a person who’s born into a Buddhist or Christian family and who
decides to leave his faith is no longer considered a member of that religion.
But a person who’s born into a Jewish family can abandon all Jewish beliefs
and even convert to another religion and still be considered Jewish — that is,
a part of the Jewish family.
The Jewish people also aren’t a race. Anyone who visits Israel quickly sees
that there are European Jews, Ethiopian Jews, North African Jews, and Middle
Eastern Jews. They come in different colors with different racial features, but
they all belong to the Jewish family.
The Jewish family is centered upon a belief in God, but essentially the Jewish
people are one big family. This family grew in size and ultimately became a
nation. But Judaism never lost sight of the fact that Jews are all part of one
family.
In this chapter, I introduce the book of Exodus, which is the second of the
Five Books of Moses, and its story of the Jewish family growing into a nation.
It tells of the transformation of a group of 70 descendants of Jacob the patri-
arch, the son of Isaac and the grandson of Abraham (see Chapter 4), and
their departure from Egypt under the leadership of Moses. Moses led the
Children of Israel to Mount Sinai, where they (all 2 to 3 million of them)
encountered God and received God’s teachings.

80
Part II: One by One: The Books of the Torah 
The Rise of a New Pharaoh
and the Early Life of Moses
Jacob’s favorite son Joseph arrived in Egypt and ultimately was promoted to
high office. Joseph’s position and reputation protected his relatives, the
Children of Israel. But when a new regime took over in Egypt, problems began
for Jacob’s descendants. In this section, I describe how the new Pharaoh forced
them to do backbreaking work and surrender their baby boys to be killed.
Moses was an Israelite child whose parents put him (as an infant) into a floating
box and put the box in the river with the hope that the baby would survive
rather than be killed. As fate had it, Moses ended up as a prince in the
Pharaoh’s palace. One day, Moses ventured out of the palace and witnessed
an Egyptian guard beating an Israelite. In this section, I explain that Moses
killed the guard, realized he was in trouble for it, and then fled to a place
called Midian. It was in Midian that Moses met his wife.
The peaceful life of Jacob’s descendants
The book of Exodus begins, “These are the names of Israel’s sons who came
to Egypt with Jacob” (Exodus 1:1). As I explain in Chapter 4, Jacob and Israel
are the same person, so the descendants of Jacob are often called Israelites or
the Children of Israel.
The Torah indicates that “The original number of Jacob’s direct descendants . . .
was seventy” (Exodus 1:5). But it also states, “The Israelites were fertile and
prolific, and their population increased. They became so numerous that the
land (of Egypt) was filled with them” (Exodus 1:7).
An ancient Jewish commentary on the book of Exodus, called the Mechilta
(meh-khil-tah), teaches that while the Jewish family in Egypt grew, it retained
its family identity and didn’t assimilate. The Children of Israel, says the
commentary, did four things that resulted in their being able to maintain
their identity:
 They were sexually moral.
 They did not gossip.
 They did not change their names.
 They did not change their language.
As vast as the group had become, the descendants of Jacob knew who they
were and from whom they descended. They also knew that they were related
to Jacob’s son Joseph, who had attained the highest status in the palace of

the Egyptian Pharaoh, that of viceroy. And as long as the Israelites’ connec-
tion to Joseph was known, they lived peacefully in the land of Egypt.
The new Pharaoh’s plan to deal
with the Israelites
A line appears in the beginning of the book of Exodus that indicates when
things changed for the Jewish family in Egypt: “A new king arose over Egypt
who knew not Joseph” (Exodus 1:8). With the event reflected in that one line,
the situation changed radically. The new king (or Pharaoh) in Egypt said,
“The Israelites are becoming too numerous and strong for us. Let us deal
wisely with them. Otherwise they might increase so much that if there is a
war they will join our enemies and fight against us” (Exodus 1:9–10).
The Torah explains that the Pharaoh wanted to crush the spirit of the Jews
and tried to do so by forcing them into hard labor, requiring them to build up
the cities of Pithom and Raamses. But the Egyptians soon discovered something
seen many times in Jewish history: Instead of crushing the spirit of the Jewish
people, oppression had the opposite effect as the Jews proliferated and
spread out.
The expression of the events of this period is an excellent example of the Torah
as an eternal document and not just an ancient history. Jewish commentators
throughout the centuries observe that the Jewish people function as a plant
does in that, when it’s cut back, the result is growth. So it is with the Jewish
people: After many periods of oppression against Jews, the result has been
unprecedented growth.
The Egyptians saw this continued growth among the Children of Israel and
put even more pressure on them. Jews were forced to do even more hard
labor to break not only their spirits but their bodies as well. As the Torah
says, the Egyptians “made their lives bitter with harsh labor involving mortar
and bricks” (Exodus 1:14).
The Pharaoh’s plan to break the Children of Israel involved more than hard
labor. He spoke with two midwives who were apparently in charge of helping in
the delivery of Jewish children. Jewish tradition teaches that the two midwives
were Yocheved and Miriam (see the next section for more about these women).
The Pharaoh declared, “When you deliver Hebrew women . . . if the child is a
boy, kill it” (Exodus 1:16). The midwives disobeyed this order, explaining that
the Hebrew women were unlike the Egyptian women who needed midwives to
help in their births. The midwives said, “They know how to deliver. They can
give birth before a midwife even gets to them” (Exodus 1:19). So the Pharaoh
instructed that every Hebrew boy must be thrown into the Nile River.
81
Chapter 5: “These Are the Names”: The Book of Exodus

An Israelite baby floats up the Nile River
One of the sons of Jacob was Levi. Jewish tradition teaches that Levi had a
son named Kehoth, who had a son named Amram. Amram married Yocheved
(yoh-kheh-vehd), a daughter of Levi. She was the mother of the baby who was
eventually named Moses.
Yocheved hid Moses successfully for three months to avoid being forced to
surrender him to the Pharaoh’s decree. But when she realized that hiding the
baby was no longer practical, she built a little box out of the same materials
used by Egyptian boat builders. She placed the baby in the box and put the
box into the Nile River, among the uncut papyrus shoots. The baby’s sister
Miriam stood by and watched the floating box to see what would happen to it.
The Pharaoh’s daughter finds the Israelite
baby and names him Moses
The Torah explains that the Egyptian Pharaoh’s daughter went to the Nile
River to bathe and discovered the box with the baby inside. The Talmud
(also known as the Oral Torah; see Chapter 3) teaches that she either sent
one of her slaves or reached out herself and took the box from the river.
When she opened the box, she discovered the baby boy inside. Suddenly the
baby boy began to cry, inspiring pity from the Pharaoh’s daughter, who knew
it was a Hebrew boy.
Miriam, the baby’s sister, was watching this discovery; she approached the
Pharaoh’s daughter and asked her if she would like her (Miriam) to find a
Hebrew wet nurse to suckle to baby. The Pharaoh’s daughter agreed, and
Miriam went to get her own mother — the mother of the baby himself! The
Pharaoh’s daughter offered Yocheved a job to care for the baby until he grew
up, at which point Yocheved would return him to the Pharaoh’s daughter.
That’s just what Yocheved did. The Pharaoh’s daughter adopted the boy “and
named him Moshe” (Exodus 2:10). Moshe (mow-sheh), the Hebrew name as it
appears in the Torah, is translated into English as “Moses.”
Moses grows up in the Pharaoh’s palace
The Torah gives no details about Moses’s experience growing up in the
palace of the Pharaoh. But the Oral Torah teaches one of the most famous
stories about Moses’s childhood.
When Moses was 3 years old, he was sitting on the Pharaoh’s lap. Suddenly
he reached for the gems on the royal crown and knocked it off the Pharaoh’s
82
Part II: One by One: The Books of the Torah 

head. An evil advisor to the Pharaoh said that this was a bad omen that
predicted that one day Moses would try to overthrow the Pharaoh.
Tradition teaches that God assigned the angel Gabriel to watch over Moses’s
safety. Gabriel transformed himself into one of the Pharaoh’s advisors and
suggested that 3-year-old Moses be put to a test. Two bowls were placed in
front of Moses — one containing gems and the other containing red-hot
coals. The test was this: If Moses reached for the coals, he would be seen as a
normal child because he wanted the coals that burned brighter than the
gems. But if Moses reached for the gems, it would be a sign that he was out to
usurp the Pharaoh’s power.
Moses, of course, was a highly intelligent child and knew the difference
between hot coals and gems. He began to reach for the gems when the angel
Gabriel moved his hand in the direction of the hot coals. Moses grabbed a
hot coal and brought it to his mouth, burning his tongue. The Pharaoh
concluded that Moses was only an innocent child.
This ancient tale is one of the traditional Jewish explanations for the view
that Moses had a stutter or some speech impediment. As the Torah says,
“Moses said to the Lord: ‘Oh Lord, I am not a man of words, neither yesterday
and not the day before and not from the very first time You spoke to me, for I
am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue’” (Exodus 4:10).
Moses kills an Egyptian guard and flees
When Moses, who knew he was one of the Children of Israel, was old enough,
he began leaving the palace of the Pharaoh where he grew up; the Torah
says, “He began to go out to his own people” (Exodus 2:11). Moses saw the
oppression that the Children of Israel were subjected to. One fateful day, he
saw an Egyptian beating one of the Hebrews. Moses looked around, and when
he saw that nobody was watching, Moses killed the Egyptian and hid the
man’s body in the sand.
The next day Moses went out of the palace again and saw two Hebrews fighting.
Moses said to the man who was in the wrong, “Why are you beating your
brother?” (Exodus 2:13). But the other one said, “Who made you our prince
and judge? Do you intend to kill me the way you killed the Egyptian?” (Exodus
2:14). At that moment, Moses knew that the incident was no longer his secret.
In fact, the Pharaoh learned that Moses had killed an Egyptian and gave
directions that Moses be put to death. Moses fled and ended up in the land of
Midian, where he met and married his wife, Tzipporah, and fathered a son,
Gershom.
83
Chapter 5: “These Are the Names”: The Book of Exodus

Get Moving! The Exodus from Egypt
In the book of Genesis, when God calls Abraham to take his son Isaac to be a
sacrifice, Abraham responds to God’s call by saying Heneni (hee-nay-knee;
Here I am). And in the book of Exodus, when God calls Moses to lead the
Children of Israel out of the bonds of slavery in Egypt, Moses also responds
to God’s call by saying, “Heneni.”
In this section, I describe how God convinced a reluctant Moses to lead the
Hebrew slaves to freedom. With his brother Aaron, Moses repeatedly tried to
convince the Pharaoh to let the Children of Israel go, but the Pharaoh dug in
his heels, and things went from bad to worse as conditions for the Israelites
worsened. Finally, God created ten terrible plagues that ultimately forced the
Pharaoh to grant freedom to the Children of Israel. In this section, I discuss
the first Jewish family holy day of Passover ever celebrated; it took place in
Egypt the night before the former slaves fled to freedom.
The burning bush
The Torah explains that, despite the death of the Egyptian Pharaoh under
whom Moses had grown up, the subjugation of the Children of Israel continued.
They cried out to God, and “God heard their cries, and he remembered His
covenant with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob” (Exodus 2:24). God then took
action by appearing to Moses in a burning bush.
Receiving a directive from God
Moses worked for his father-in-law, Yitro (yit-row; Jethro), as a shepherd. One
day, Moses took his sheep to the edge of the desert to a mountain known as
Horeb, eventually to be known as the mountain of God. It’s also the location
of Mount Sinai. Moses then noticed a fire in the middle of a thorn bush and
saw that the flame was not damaging the bush. Intrigued by the phenomenon,
he decided to investigate.
It was at that moment that Moses had his first encounter with God. As Moses
approached the burning bush, God called out to him, “Moses, Moses”
(Exodus 3:4). Moses said, “Here I am,” and God told Moses not to come any
closer. God instructed Moses to take his shoes off, explaining that he was
standing on holy ground.
God said, “I am the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of
Isaac, the God of Jacob” (Exodus 3:6). Moses hid his face, fearful of looking at
the Divine. God then said, “I have seen the suffering of My people in Egypt. I
have heard how they cry out because of what their slave drivers do, and I am
aware of their pain. I have come down to rescue them from Egypt’s power. I
will bring them out of that land, to a good, spacious land, to a land flowing
with milk and honey” (Exodus 3:7–8).
84
Part II: One by One: The Books of the Torah 

God then gave Moses a directive to go to the Egyptian Pharaoh. God said to
Moses, “Bring My people, the Israelites, out of Egypt” (Exodus 3:10).
Objecting to God’s directive
Moses objected to God’s directive. He said to God, “Who am I that I should go
to Pharaoh and that I should take the Children of Israel out of Egypt?”
(Exodus 3:11). God assured Moses that He would be with Moses. Moses said
that when he got to Egypt, the people would ask him who sent him; they
would ask Moses to tell them God’s name. He asked God, “What shall I say to
them?” (Exodus 3:13). God’s response was, “Ehyeh Asher Ehyeh” (eh-yeh ah-
share eh-yeh; I will be Who I will be). God said, “This is what you must say to
the Israelites: ‘I will be’ sent me to you” (Exodus 3:14).
God instructed Moses to go to Egypt and gather the elders of the Israelites,
describing to the elders that God had appeared to Moses and would bring
them out of their wretched oppression. God told Moses that he and the
elders should request that the Pharaoh allow the Israelites to leave.
Moses was skeptical and insisted that the people wouldn’t believe him. God
asked Moses to throw his staff on the ground. When Moses did as God asked,
the staff suddenly turned into a snake. God told Moses to grab the snake’s
tail, upon which the snake turned back into a staff. God then told Moses to
put his hand on his chest inside his robe. When Moses did this, his skin
suddenly turned white like a leper. Moses touched his chest again, and his
skin returned to normal. God assured Moses that when the Egyptians saw
these things, they would see God’s power. God suggested that if they weren’t
impressed, Moses should take some water from the Nile River and throw it on
the ground, upon which it would turn to blood.
Moses didn’t want the job, and he explained to God that he was “heavy of
mouth and heavy of speech” (Exodus 4:10). God told Moses that his slow
speech and everything else in the world was the result of what God created.
God insisted again that He would be with Moses.
Moses still wasn’t convinced. He pleaded with God to send someone else to
do the job. God told Moses that He would send Moses’s brother Aaron with
him and explained that Aaron would be the spokesperson. But God also
suggested that Moses take the staff and do the “staff into snake” trick to
really drive the message home with the Israelites.
Preparing for the trip to Egypt
Moses asked his father-in-law for permission to go to Egypt to see his people,
and Yitro agreed. Moses packed up his wife and two sons and headed to
Egypt. Before they left, God offered Moses this additional reassurance:
“Return to Egypt. All those who want to kill you are now dead” (Exodus 4:19).
That must have sounded pretty reassuring, but then God told Moses some
85
Chapter 5: “These Are the Names”: The Book of Exodus

seemingly bad news: Even though you know that I (God) have amazing
powers and that I have given some of those powers to you (the magical staff),
“I will harden Pharaoh’s heart and Pharaoh will not allow the people to leave”
(Exodus 4:21).
Arriving in Egypt to deliver God’s message
Moses’s brother, Aaron, was in Egypt, and God instructed him to meet Moses in
the desert. Moses told Aaron about his encounter with God and the instructions
that Moses received. The two brothers then proceeded with their important
task.
Meeting with the Children of Israel and the Pharaoh
Together, Moses and Aaron went to the elders of the Children of Israel in
Egypt, told them what God had instructed, and gave the elders a little demon-
stration of the amazing staff. The elders were convinced (I would be too if I
saw a wooden staff turn into a snake and then back again!). They also now
knew that God understood their misery.
Moses and Aaron then went to see the Pharaoh and said to him, “God told us
to tell you: Let My people go.” The Pharaoh understandably said, “Who is
your God that I should obey him? I don’t believe in your God and I won’t let
the Children of Israel leave.”
Protesting to God
Just as God promised, the Pharaoh’s heart was hardened, and things got
worse for the Children of Israel. The Pharaoh’s new, harsher orders included
denying Jewish slaves straw, a key ingredient for making the bricks for the
Pharaoh’s cities. But the Pharaoh insisted that their daily brick quota remain
the same, and he also added additional tasks, making their work even more
difficult. The Pharaoh said, “Make the work more difficult for the people and
make sure they do it. Then they will stop believing in false ideas” (Exodus 5:9).
The Pharaoh’s supervisors whipped the Jewish slaves, and the slaves
protested to Moses and Aaron, claiming that they had only made things
worse. So Moses spoke to God and said, “Why did you send me? You have
done nothing to help Your people.” God urged Moses to believe that the
Pharaoh would let the Jews go, reminded Moses that He promised Abraham
that He would give them the Holy Land, and asked Moses to reassure the
people that they would be free and would get a chance to see the might of
God firsthand. Moses conveyed God’s message to the Children of Israel, but
they didn’t believe him.
86
Part II: One by One: The Books of the Torah 

God instructed Moses to go back to the Pharaoh and reminded him that the
Pharaoh’s heart would be hardened once again. But God explained that
hardening the Pharaoh’s heart ultimately would be a good thing because it
would result in a major display of God’s power. In other words, if the Pharaoh
were to simply let the Children of Israel go, there would be no reason to show
Egypt and the world God’s absolute might. But when they saw God’s might,
they would know that God is, well, God!
Performing magic (but to no avail)
Moses and Aaron returned to the Pharaoh (the Torah says that at the time
Moses was 80 years old and Aaron was 83). God had warned them that the
Pharaoh would want proof of their God’s powers. God suggested that Aaron
throw his staff on the ground in front of the Pharaoh, which is just what he
did. Aaron threw down the staff, and it turned into a snake.
The Pharaoh summoned his scholars and magicians, who were able to duplicate
the demonstration with their magic tricks. Several Egyptian magicians threw
down their staffs, and they all turned into snakes. Suddenly, Aaron’s staff
swallowed all the other staffs. It was a very cool demonstration, but the
Torah says, “Pharaoh remained obstinate and did not pay attention — just as
God predicted” (Exodus 7:13).
The Ten Plagues
After the demonstration with the staffs for the Pharaoh and his magicians,
God instructed Moses to go to the Pharaoh again the next morning with his
staff and to tell the Pharaoh that God wanted His people to be free. Moses
found the Pharaoh by the Nile River and, as instructed by God, said to him,
“So far, you have not paid attention. God now says, ‘Through this you will
know that I am God. I will strike the water of the Nile and it will turn to blood.
The fish will die and it will stink’” (Exodus 7:17–18).
87
Chapter 5: “These Are the Names”: The Book of Exodus
The Egyptian cobra’s magic trick
A species of snake known in Egypt as a naja haje
is commonly called an Egyptian cobra. (It’s the
kind of snake that killed Cleopatra.) It’s said that
applying pressure to this snake just below its
head makes it temporarily paralyzed and quite
rigid, so that it looks like a stick. When the rigid
snake is then thrown to the ground, the temporary
paralysis breaks and the snake becomes active
again. Many have speculated that this snake is
the explanation of the illusion performed by the
Pharaoh’s magicians. But there’s no similar
explanation of how a staff can swallow other
staffs, as Aaron’s staff did!

As promised, all the water in Egypt turned to blood, but once again, the
Pharaoh’s magicians claimed to be able to duplicate the “trick.” And the
Pharaoh just continued to be obstinate.
God then produced additional plagues adding up to ten in all. With each
plague, life became worse for Egyptians, but miraculously the plagues had no
ill effect for the Children of Israel. And with each plague, the Pharaoh just dug
in his heels and remained stubborn.
Following are the plagues and the verses where you can find them described
in the Torah:
 Dam (dahm; blood): Exodus 7:14–25
 Tzefardaya (tzeh-fahr-day-ah; frogs): Exodus 7:26–8:11
 Kinim (kee-neem; lice): Exodus 8:12–15
 Arov (ah-rove; wild animals): Exodus 8:16–28
 Dever (deh-vehr; livestock disease): Exodus 9:1–7
 Sheckin (sh-kheen; boils): Exodus 9:8–12
 Barad (bah-rahd; hail): Exodus 9:13–35
 Arbeh (are-beh; locusts): Exodus 10:1–20
 Choshech (khoh-shekh; darkness): Exodus 10:21–29
 Makat b’Chorot (mah-khat beh-khor-oat; death of Egypt’s firstborn):
Exodus 12:29 (see the next section for more about this plague)
Celebrating the first Passover 
before leaving Egypt
Egyptians experienced great suffering during the Ten Plagues, but as God had
predicted (and caused), the Pharaoh remained obstinate and refused to
release the Israelites. Before the final plague, the death of the firstborn of
Egypt, God told Moses that the Pharaoh would finally let the Children of
Israel leave Egypt after one more plague. God instructed Moses to discreetly
tell the people to gather their things and prepare to leave.
Moses said to the Pharaoh, “Around midnight, every firstborn in Egypt will
die” (Exodus 11:5). The plague would include every firstborn male, female,
and animal but wouldn’t touch the Children of Israel. As the Torah states, 
“. . . among the Israelites, not even a dog will whimper” (Exodus 11: 7).
Under God’s instruction, Moses told the Israelites that each family must
slaughter a perfect 1-year-old lamb, sheep, or goat as a sacrifice. They were
88
Part II: One by One: The Books of the Torah 

to rub blood from the sacrifices on their doorposts and on the beams above
their doors before roasting and eating the meat.
God told Moses that during that night He would kill each firstborn of Egypt
and would pass over the homes with blood on them. God instructed the
Israelites to remember this day forever and to eat matzah for seven days.
These events resulted in the Jewish holy days of Pesach (pah-sakh; to pass
over), or Passover (see Chapter 11 for more about this holiday).
The final plague happened, and God killed every firstborn in Egypt (Exodus
12:29). There was terrible suffering on that night, and the Pharaoh sent for
Moses and Aaron, saying to them, “Get out.” The Israelites took their belongings
and rushed out of Egypt. They were in such a rush that their bread didn’t
have time to rise, resulting in matzah (mah-tzah; unleavened bread).
What a Trip: Journeying 
through the Wilderness
The Torah states that God showed the Children of Israel the way out of Egypt
by means of a cloud and a pillar of fire: “God went before them by day in a
pillar of cloud to lead them on the way, and at night in a pillar of fire to provide
them with light, so that they could travel by day and by night” (Exodus 13:21).
In the following sections, I describe the Israelites’ adventures as they journey
through the wilderness, including crossing the Red Sea, finding food and
water, and fighting battles.
Crossing the Sea of Reeds
(also known as the Red Sea)
The Torah explains that 2 to 3 million Israelites, 600,000 of whom were men,
left Egypt. And so ended 430 years of bitter servitude by the Children of Israel
in Egypt. But trouble from the Pharaoh wasn’t completely behind them. God
directed the Israelites as they fled but took them on a circuitous route. The
Pharaoh learned of their path, and one last time God hardened the Pharaoh’s
heart, causing him to change his mind about letting the Israelites go. The
Pharaoh realized that he had released millions of people who provided free
labor to Egypt — what a mistake! About 2,000 years ago, the historian Josephus
wrote that Pharaoh gathered 600 chariots, 50,000 horsemen, and 200,000 foot
soldiers and went after the Israelites.
The Israelites wound up caught between the Egyptian army on one side and
the Red Sea on the other. The Torah calls the sea the yam suf (yahm soof; Sea
of Reeds); it’s better known as the Red Sea, which is the erroneous Greek
89
Chapter 5: “These Are the Names”: The Book of Exodus

translation. They protested to Moses, saying “How could you do this to us?”
(Exodus 14:11). Moses reassured the people and told them that they were
about to see something amazing.
God instructed Moses to raise his staff and arms. The sea split, dividing the
waters. The Israelites entered the dry sea bed and the water formed as two
walls, one on each side of them. The Egyptian army followed them into the
sea bed, where the wheels of their chariots got stuck and they all drowned.
As the Torah says, “Not a single one was left” (Exodus 14: 28).
Singing a Song at the Sea
According to the Torah, “On that day God rescued the Israelites from Egypt . . .
the Israelites saw the hand of God and the power He unleashed on Egypt, 
and the people were in a state of awe. They believed in God and in Moses”
(Exodus 14:31).
As the Pharaoh’s horse came into the Red Sea and the Egyptians drowned,
Moses and the Israelites sang a song together known as Shirat Ha Yam
(sheer-aht ha yahm; the Song at the Sea). The song commemorates the miracle
of the Israelites’ escape from Egypt’s armies through the divided sea. The
song appears in the standard Jewish prayer book and has become a part of
the daily liturgy. Some of the key verses are:
I will sing to God a song for His great victory . . . Horse and rider He threw in
the sea . . . The Lord is my strength and song, and He has become my
salvation; He is my God, and I will praise Him; my father’s God, and I will
exalt Him . . . Pharaoh’s chariots and his army has he thrown into the sea;
his chosen captains also are drowned in the Red Sea . . . Your right hand, O
Lord, is glorious in power; Your right hand, O Lord, has dashed in pieces the
enemy . . . The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the
plunder . . . You blew with Your wind, the sea covered them; they sank as
lead in the mighty waters . . . Who is like You, O Lord, among the gods? Who
is like You, glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders? You
stretched out Your right hand, the earth swallowed them . . . You in Your
mercy have led forth the people whom You have redeemed . . . You shall
bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of your inheritance, in the
place, O Lord, which You have made for You to dwell in, in the Sanctuary, O
Lord, which Your hands have established . . . The Lord shall reign forever
and ever.
It’s interesting to see the way in which a Torah scribe writes the verses of
this song in the Torah scroll. The verses are set up to look like a brick wall
(see Figure 5-1). Remember that there are strict and exact laws for writing a
Torah (see Chapter 14 for details). In the case of the Song at the Sea, it must
be written in 30 lines exactly the way it has been written since the beginning
of the writing of Torah scrolls.
90
Part II: One by One: The Books of the Torah 

After the Song at the Sea appears in the Torah, Miriam, the sister of Moses
and Aaron, is mentioned by name for the first time. The Torah says that
“Miriam took a drum in her hand, and all the women followed her with drums
and dancing” (Exodus 15:20). According to Torah commentators, Miriam’s
drum was more like a tambourine or a timbrel.
Gathering manna from heaven
and water to drink
After the Children of Israel crossed the Red Sea and were in the desert, they
faced new challenges, one of them being hunger. The Torah says that the
whole community began to complain and protest to Moses and Aaron. They
said, “If only we had died by the hand of God in Egypt. At least in Egypt we
could eat. But you brought us into the desert and you will kill us all through
starvation” (Exodus 16:3).
God told Moses that food would fall from the sky but also that this food
would be the basis of a test of faith for the Children of Israel. The Israelites
were instructed to go out each day and gather enough food for themselves
for one day. The hungry people would be tempted to gather more than they
needed for a day, but God promised that the food would be replenished for
Figure 5-1:
The Song at
the Sea, as
it appears in
a Torah
scroll.
91
Chapter 5: “These Are the Names”: The Book of Exodus

each day’s gathering. The only exception would be Friday, when God would
provide a double portion of food so that the Israelites wouldn’t have to work
on Saturday (Shabbat; see Chapter 11 for more about this day).
The food appeared each morning in the form of dew with little grains underneath
called manna in English; in Hebrew, the word is mun (muhn). Each day, the
people were instructed to gather a quantity called an omer (oh-mare; approx-
imately two quarts). If someone gathered a little less or a little more, he or
she would still have the perfect amount. Any manna that was left over to be
eaten the next day would spoil and become putrid.
Although the food problem was solved, the Israelites complained that they
were thirsty and had no water. Once again, they asked Moses why he had
brought them out of Egypt, where they’d had water. When they insisted that
he provide them with water, Moses cried to God and asked God what to do.
Moses was frightened that the people would stone him. God told Moses to
march in front of the people, take his trusty staff that had served him well
until then, and strike a large boulder to produce flowing water from it. Moses
named the place Massa U’Merrivah (mah-sah oo-muh-ree-vah; testing and
argument).
Fighting the war against Amalek
After the Israelites’ food and water issues were resolved, Amalek, a tribe who
descended from Esau (see Chapter 4), suddenly attacked the Israelites from
behind. Moses told his assistant Joshua to prepare for battle against Amalek.
Moses told Joshua that during the battle he (Moses) would stand on the top
of the hill overlooking the battle and have God’s staff in his hand. As long as
Moses held his hands up, the Israelites would be winning, but if he put his
arms down, Amalek would gain strength. The battle began, and Moses kept
his arms up, but after a while he grew tired. Aaron and another person
helped Moses keep his hands up, and the Israelites were victorious.
Over the centuries, the memory of the evil Amalek has persisted among the
Jewish people, and the Torah presents a paradox regarding Amalek that’s
often addressed: The Torah says to remember to obliterate the memory of
Amalek. Moses said, “God shall be at war with Amalek for all generations”
(Exodus 17:16). In fact, the enemies of the Jewish people are often referred to
as “Amalek.” For example, Hitler has been referred to as “Amalek” among the
Jewish people.
Appointing judges
Moses’s father-in-law, Yitro, heard about the Israelites’ exodus from Egypt
and traveled to be with Moses and the people. Yitro brought along Moses’s
92
Part II: One by One: The Books of the Torah 

wife Tzipporah and their two sons, Gershom and Eliezer. Moses updated his
father-in-law on all that had occurred since they last saw each other.
There were inevitable conflicts among the Israelites as they continued to travel,
and Moses spent his days listening to their cases and acting as a judge. After
some observation, Yitro told Moses, “You are going to wear yourself out . . .
you cannot do it all alone” (Exodus 18:18). He suggested that Moses share his
wisdom with the people and then appoint God-fearing men, “men of truth
who hate injustice” (Exodus 18: 21), to listen to disputes and make judgments.
This arrangement became the basis of the court system of the Jewish people
(see Chapter 10) and court systems throughout history. Yitro said, “You must
appoint them over the people as leaders of thousands, leaders of hundreds,
leaders of fifties, and leaders of tens” (Exodus 18:21). Moses only served as
the judge of the toughest cases; the minor cases were left to the God-fearing
judges.
Arriving at Mount Sinai
Three months into the Israelites’ journey from Egypt, they arrived at Mount
Sinai; I discuss the momentous events that happened there (including the
receipt of the Ten Commandments and the Torah) in the following sections.
Connecting with God
The Torah says that when the Israelites arrived at Mount Sinai, Moses “went
up to God” (Exodus 19:3), and Torah commentators say that this means that
Moses connected directly with God by way of meditation. The message Moses
received from God was a pivotal moment in the history of the Children of
Israel. God said to Moses, “This is what you must say to the Children of Israel”:
 “You saw what I did in Egypt.”
 “If you obey Me and keep My covenant you shall be My special treasure.”
 “You will be a kingdom of priests and a holy nation to Me.”
The Children of Israel responded, “All that God has spoken we will do”
(Exodus 19:8).
God told Moses that in three days He would descend on Mount Sinai. The
Children of Israel then prepared for the momentous time by setting a boundary
around the mountain.
93
Chapter 5: “These Are the Names”: The Book of Exodus

Going up the mountain to get 
the Ten Commandments
Three days after Moses received God’s message, thunder, lightning, and
smoke were heard and seen. A loud trumpet blast from a ram’s horn was
sounded, and the Divine Presence was perceived by all who were at Mount
Sinai. God instructed Moses to ascend to the peak of the mountain. Moses
climbed up the mountain but then came down to warn the people not to
cross over the boundary they had set around the mountain. Moses cautioned
that people could die if they got too close to Mount Sinai.
God then spoke the Ten Commandments. Some Torah commentaries claim 
that all the gathered Israelites heard the Voice of God as He spoke all 
Ten Commandments, whereas others insist that everyone heard the first 
two commandments from the voice of God and Moses taught them the
remaining eight. Following is a summary of the Ten Commandments (Exodus
20:1–14) (check out Chapter 17 for a more-complete discussion of the Ten
Commandments):
1. I am the Lord your God.
2. Do not have any other gods or idols.
3. Do not take God’s name in vain.
4. Remember the Sabbath and keep it holy.
5. Honor your father and your mother.
6. Do not murder.
7. Do not commit adultery.
8. Do not steal.
9. Do not bear false witness (don’t lie!).
10. Do not be envious of your neighbor.
God gave Moses two tablets, which Jewish tradition says were written on by
God’s finger. Jewish commentaries differ as to what was written on the
tablets. One opinion says that of the Ten Commandments, five were written
on one tablet and five on the other. Another opinion suggests that all Ten
Commandments were written on each of the two tablets. The Talmud also
indicates that there were two miracles regarding these tablets:
 The writing went right through the stones but could be read from either side.
 The central parts of some of the letters, even though they weren’t
connected, didn’t fall out but floated.
You can find out what happened to these tablets in the later section “Aaron
and the Incident of the Golden Calf.”
94
Part II: One by One: The Books of the Torah 

Returning with the Torah
When Moses returned from Mount Sinai after 40 days (Exodus 34:28–29), in
addition to the Ten Commandments, he had received an enormous number of
teachings from God. Some of these teachings are recorded in detail in the
Torah, resulting in the Five Books of Moses. Many other teachings were to
remain oral and became the basis of the Oral Law of the Jewish people. In a
very real sense, Moses received two Torahs on Mount Sinai: a Written Torah
and an Oral Torah (eventually to be known as the Talmud; see Chapter 3).
Both are essential parts of the Torah of the Jewish people.
As a whole, the Five Books of Moses contains 613 laws scattered throughout
the text (see Appendixes B and C for full details on these laws), but a great
number appear in the book of Exodus in particular. Some of these laws relate
to the following issues:
 Prohibition against idolatry
 How to treat indentured servants
 Capital crimes such as murder, injuring or cursing your parents, and
kidnapping someone
 The laws of damages
 The laws of stealing
 Proper wages
 Prohibition against occult practices
 Treatment of widows and orphans
 The laws of money lending
 The laws of court procedure
Aaron and the Incident 
of the Golden Calf
While Moses was still on the mountain speaking with God (see the previous
section), the Israelites were getting restless. They felt that Moses was taking
quite a long time (wouldn’t you be impatient after 40 days?), so they gathered
around Moses’s brother Aaron and asked him to make them an idol to worship.
Aaron instructed the people to give the women’s gold earrings to a designated
goldsmith, who melted the gold and formed it into the shape of a calf. The
Torah says that some people actually said of the calf, “This is the god who
brought us out of Egypt” (Exodus 32:4). When Aaron saw and heard the
95
Chapter 5: “These Are the Names”: The Book of Exodus

people’s reactions, he built an altar before the golden calf and announced a
festival to be held the next day. (The great Torah commentators indicate that
Aaron really didn’t believe in or condone the building of a golden calf idol; he
was merely buying time, hoping that Moses would return soon.) The next
morning, the people awoke and prepared for a festival. They brought sacri-
fices to be burned, and they ate, drank, and had a great time.
God saw what was going on among Aaron and the Israelites and told Moses
that the people were becoming corrupt. God said, “They are quick to forget
what I commanded of them and they have made an idol.” God described 
the Children of Israel as a “stiff-necked people” (Exodus 32:9). A great Torah
commentator points out that describing the Jewish people as stiff-necked is
not a negative comment; the commentator explains that this stubborn trait is
a positive trait when the Jewish people get it right and are stubborn about
the right things.
Moses tried to plead to God on behalf of the people and managed to convince
God to be patient with them. Moses went down the mountain, holding the
two tablets with the Ten Commandments, and saw the golden calf and the
dancing. In anger, Moses smashed the tablets and destroyed the golden calf
by melting it and grinding it into powder. He scattered the powder into the
water of a brook and forced the people to drink the water.
Moses and Aaron spoke about the incident with the golden calf, and Moses
understood that Aaron had actually restrained the people. Moses also saw
that it was only a small minority of people who had led the rest astray. In a
bold act of housecleaning, Moses ordered the rebellious leadership to be
killed, and on that day, 3,000 people were executed.
The Torah indicates that Moses and God had an intimate chat about the
whole sinful golden calf affair, the way two friends would. During this conver-
sation, Moses asked God if he could see God, but God replied that no man
could see Him and survive. God then instructed Moses to create a duplicate
set of the Ten Commandments. Moses did as God asked and then recited
words that became one of the most sacred prayers of the Jewish people:
“God, God, Omnipotent, merciful and kind, slow to anger, with tremendous
love and truth. He remembers deeds of love for thousands of generations, for-
giving sin, rebellion and error” (Exodus 34:6–7).
Building a Movable Worship Tent
In the book of Exodus, the Torah describes in rather precise detail the structure
of the movable place of worship that accompanied the Children of Israel. In
English, it’s known as the Tabernacle, which comes from the Latin word for
“hut,” but the Hebrew term mishkan (mish-kahn; to dwell), describes it more
accurately. The Hebrew word “mishkan” is from the same root as the Hebrew
96
Part II: One by One: The Books of the Torah 

word shechinah (sheh-khee-nah; God’s presence). The mishkan was the focal
point of worship for the Children of Israel as they worked their way from
Egypt to the land of Israel where the Holy Temple was eventually built in
Jerusalem. The layout of the sanctuary in synagogues today is based on the
description of the mishkan in the Torah.
Six chapters in the book of Exodus offer the details of the mishkan (the books
of Leviticus and Numbers also discuss the Tabernacle; see Chapters 6 and 7
for details). The Exodus chapters speak of many of the details of the mishkan,
including:
 The materials required to build the Tabernacle (Exodus 25:1–9 and
Exodus 35:4–9)
Moses tells the people which materials God has instructed be used to
build the Tabernacle and asks that the people make offerings of these
materials if they have them. The materials included gold, silver, copper,
various-colored wool, animal skins and hides, acacia wood, lamp oil, fra-
grances to make incense, and precious stones.
 The details of the Ark of the Covenant (Exodus 25:10–22 and 
Exodus 37:1–9)
The Torah says that the chief architect of the Tabernacle was an artist
named Bezalel (betz-ah-layl). Bezalel made the Ark of acacia wood with
a layer of pure gold on the inside. The Torah describes its precise
dimensions (21⁄2 cubits by 1⁄2 cubits and 11⁄2 cubits in height; a cubit is the
ancient yardstick that measures from the tip of the middle finger to the
tip of the elbow). The Torah also describes the two gold cherubs that
decorated the top of the Ark. The Ark of the Covenant was where the
tablets of the Ten Commandments were kept.
 The table (Exodus 25:23–30 and Exodus 37:10–16)
The table in the Tabernacle was also made of acacia wood and layered
with pure gold. Once a week, freshly baked bread made of the finest
flour was placed on the table as part of the divinely directed ritual.
Echoing this today are the two loaves of bread called challah (khah-lah)
that are on the Shabbat table in Jewish homes each week.
 The menorah (Exodus 25:31–40 and Exodus 37:17–24)
Bezalel created the seven-branched lamp called the menorah (meh-no-rah;
lamp) by hammering one single piece of pure gold. On each side of the
central shaft were three branches. Each branch was decorated with
three cups, a sphere, and a flower. The central shaft had even more of
these decorations. All the details of the menorah design were dictated
by God, and it’s rich in its symbolism. The menorah that was used in the
second Temple in Jerusalem was brought to Rome when Rome conquered
the Holy Land. In Rome today, you can see a sculpted representation of this
event on the Arch of Titus.

Chapter 5: “These Are the Names”: The Book of Exodus

 The copper altar (Exodus 27: 1–8 and Exodus 38:1–7)
This altar was made of acacia wood plated with copper. Located outside
the Tabernacle itself, it was the location of the offerings of sacrifices, the
major activity at the Tabernacle site. The Torah describes it as a square,
5 cubits by 5 cubits and 3 cubits in height.
 The clothing of the priests (Exodus 28: 1–43 and Exodus 39: 2–31)
The priests’ vestments were ornate and looked like garments created for
royalty. In Exodus 28:2, the Torah says that the vestments were designed
for “glory and splendor,” regarding the priests as well as for the honor God.
 The incense altar (Exodus 30:1–10 and Exodus 37:25–29)
This altar was made of acacia wood and plated with gold. It was a
square, 2 cubits by 2 cubits and 3 cubits tall. Incense burned morning
and night in the Tabernacle.
 The washstand (Exodus 30:17–21 and Exodus 38:8)
In the courtyard of the Tabernacle was a big copper basin filled with
water. The priests were required to wash their hands and feet at this
basin before each sacrificial service. Many pious Jews today also wash
their hands before a prayer service.
The Ark of the Covenant (yes, the one
Indiana Jones looked for)
In Hebrew, the Ark of the Covenant is known as Aron Habrit (ah-rone ha-brit).
It’s the container that stored the tablets containing the Ten Commandments.
The Ark included two cherubim (cheh-roo-beem; forms or images of angels)
situated on the top of the Ark. The Torah states that Moses was able to receive
teachings from God by standing beneath and between these two cherubim. See
Exodus 25:10–22 for the Torah’s description of this famous object.
The Holy of Holies
The kodesh hakodashim (kow-desh ha-koh-dah-sheem; the Holy of Holies)
was the most sacred spot in the mishkan because it was the location of the
Ark of the Covenant. As such, the voice of God spoke to Moses in this place.
Many years later, when the Holy Temple stood on the Temple Mount in
Jerusalem, it too had a Holy of Holies. Only on one day of the year (Yom
Kippur) was the High Priest permitted to enter this most sacred space.

The menorah
The seven-branched candelabra known as the menorah is one of the major
pieces of furniture in the mishkan (and ultimately in the Holy Temple). The
Torah goes into precise detail about the menorah’s construction. Included in
this detail are the following requirements:
 It must be pure gold.
 It is formed by hammering.
 It must be one single piece of gold.
 There must be seven lamps.
 On each side of the central branch are three branches.
 Each branch must have three cups with a sphere and flower on each.
The menorah’s structure is filled with symbolic significance and has been the
subject of a lot of commentaries over the centuries.
The priests, their special garments,
and their rituals
Moses’s brother Aaron was designated as the first High Priest of the mishkan,
and along with his sons, he arranged for the menorah to burn and to oversee
the other activities in the mishkan (and eventually in the Holy Temple). To
this day, Jewish men who trace their ancestry to Aaron refer to themselves as
priests called kohanim (ko-ha-neem) and have special roles in the synagogue
service (see Chapter 13 for details of this service). The Torah goes into great
detail about the responsibilities and rituals performed by the priests and their
99
Chapter 5: “These Are the Names”: The Book of Exodus
Why do Jews avoid the Dome of the Rock?
In photographs of present-day Jerusalem, one
structure that dominates the skyline is the Dome
of the Rock, part of an Islamic mosque in
Jerusalem’s old city. Jewish tradition teaches that
this mosque was built on the very spot where
the Holy of Holies is located. It isn’t just for
political reasons that Jews today don’t visit that
mosque or the area surrounding it. Because it
isn’t known precisely where the Holy of Holies
is (the spot was located by means of prophecy),
Jews avoid that area in order to not enter this
sacred space.

descendants as well as the special clothing worn by the priests. The Torah
includes the following information about the priests’ clothing:
 The basic garment, called the ephod
 The design of the ephod
 The breastplate, including the material to be used
 The precious stones on the breastplate
 The robe worn under the ephod
 The forehead plate and its details
 The head covering or turban
Remember that the main activity in the mishkan was the offering of sacrifices.
These weren’t bribes to God by primitive people. Rather, a sacrifice was a
profound ritual. When you study the details and symbolism of each sacrifice,
or when you experience the emotional, intellectual, and spiritual impact on
those involved with the sacrifice, the results are deep spiritual connections
with God and profoundly personal religious experiences.

“And He Called”: 
The Book of Leviticus

I
n Hebrew, the book of Leviticus is called Vayikra (vah-yih-krah). It’s the
first word of the book, and it means “and He called,” referring to God. In
every Torah scroll, the word “Vayikra” consists of five letters, the fifth of
which is the “aleph,” the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet. In every accurate
Torah scroll, the aleph in the first word is written extra small, and all the sur-
rounding letters are normal size.
Jewish tradition teaches that the small aleph serves as a reminder of the major
character trait of Moses: humility. Jewish tradition teaches that Moses was
the most humble man in the world. Because of his humility, Moses wouldn’t
enter the Tabernacle unless he was called by God. Moses also is known by Jews
to be the greatest prophet and greatest teacher who ever lived. The message
is clear: In order to receive God, you must humble yourself. The book of
Leviticus begins with a call from God, and the way to receive God’s call is 
to diminish your ego and make room for the Divine.
The third of the Five Books of Moses is known as Leviticus because it’s largely
about the Levites, the descendants of Jacob’s son Levi. When the Children of
Israel entered the Promised Land (the Land of Israel), each received a part of
the land to call their own. But the descendants of Levi received no land;
rather, they worked in the Holy Temple, assisting the kohanim (koh-hah-neem;
priests) and supporting themselves with donations from those who came to the
Temple. The Levites also were the singers in the Holy Temple. The book of
Leviticus, as you find out in this chapter, details the holy duties that the Levites
were responsible for carrying out. In this chapter, you also find out that the
book of Leviticus deals with many of the most basic moral commandments in
the Torah that pertain not only to the priests and Levites but to all the Children
of Israel.

Part II: One by One: The Books of the Torah 
Drawing Near to God: 
The Laws of Sacrifices
A major part of the first section of the book of Leviticus deals with the sacrifices,
or offerings, that the Israelites brought to the mizbaiach (miz-bay-akh; altar) in
the mishkan (mish-khan; to dwell). (Turn to Chapter 5 for more about the
mishkan, or Tabernacle.) Whether they were animal, vegetable, or baked items,
the sacrifices were burned in the mishkan. A sacrifice wasn’t intended as a
bribe to God. After all, it’s foolish to think that God would be forgiving or loving
in response to an animal slaughtered on the altar, for example. And what would
the Creator of the Universe want with the smoke of a burnt pigeon?
So what’s the purpose of a sacrifice? The answer starts with the word itself.
The Hebrew word for “sacrifice” is korban (core-bahn; to draw near). The
purpose of the Tabernacle was to give the people an opportunity to focus all
their attention on God and to feel closer to God. So the Tabernacle in general
and the sacrifices in particular were designed to draw one near to God.
There were a number of aspects to every sacrifice:
 It created a pleasurable smell, offered with heartfelt and sincere love
and devotion to God.
 It was offered in the place of the person who offered the sacrifice. By
offering the sacrifice, the person was saying, “I offer myself to You, God,
with utmost sincerity and completeness, just as this sacrifice is being
completely offered.”
Hearing God’s call through sacrifice and education
In the Jewish world today, it’s considered a
deed of the highest order to help others get
involved in Jewish life, study the Torah, and
deepen their faith in God. Performing acts of
outreach and trying to influence family, friends,
and others to reconnect with Judaism is called
Kiruv (kee-roov). Every Hebrew word is based
on a root that’s usually three letters. The word
“kiruv” shares the same root as the word
“korban” (sacrifice).
Just as the purpose of the sacrifice is to bring a
person near to God, the efforts to educate other
Jewish people in the ways of Judaism are really
an effort to also bring them near. A person hears
the call of God and is inspired to call out to
others and to bring a person’s soul closer to the
Divine.

 It was usually an animal that represented a life; the sacrifice was symbolic
of a total offering of life itself and an acknowledgment that life is a gift
from God.
 It was burned completely because the sincerity of a sacrifice had to be
total. (In some cases, part of the sacrifice was eaten by the priests who
performed the ritual sacrifices on behalf of others.)
According to the teachings of the sages, every sacrifice requires a special inner
attitude on the part of the individual involved in the ritual. This order reflects
the order in which all people, not just priests, are supposed to serve God:
1. The person opens himself to God and hears God’s call.
2. The person must come close to God and be ready to give his whole
being to God.
3. In place of giving his own life, the person offers the sacrifice.
In the following sections, I describe the many kinds of sacrifices detailed in
the book of Leviticus.
Burnt offerings
In the book of Leviticus, the most common sacrifice or offering is the olah
(oh-la; burnt offering), which symbolically represented one’s complete devo-
tion to and submission to God (Leviticus 1:1–17). The root of the word “olah”
means “ascension.”
Burnt offerings consisted of different kinds of animals; the choice of animal
was based on what a person could afford. The person’s first choice, accord-
ing to the Torah, would be a fine bull, cow, sheep, or goat. But if he couldn’t
afford such an animal, a bird (such as a pigeon or a turtledove) was used. If
the person wasn’t able to afford any animal, a meal offering was permissible.
Meal offerings
A meal offering is known as korban mincha (core-bahn min-khah) (Leviticus
2:1–3). The meal offering was supposed to be made of the finest flour available
mixed with oil and frankincense, but it was an inexpensive offering used by
those who were too poor to use more expensive items such as animals. 
Because grain is the basic ingredient for prepared food, it’s the sustainer of
life. Symbolically, the meal offering expressed the fact that the true source
103
Chapter 6: “And He Called”: The Book of Leviticus

and sustainer of all life is God. The person making the sacrifice gave the korban
mincha to a priest who took a part of it and burned it on the altar. The rest
was available to be eaten by the priests. Various types of meal offerings are
detailed in Leviticus, including
 Baked offering
 Pan (fried) offering
 Deep-fried offering
 Grain offering using the first reaping
Peace offerings
A peace offering (Leviticus 3:1–17) is an expression of gratitude to God. It’s an
offering of thankfulness for all that God has given and gratitude for God’s gen-
erosity. In Hebrew, a peace offering was known as zebach sh’lamim (zeh-bakh
sheh-la-meem) or simply sh’lamim, which is connected to the Hebrew word
“shalom,” which means meaning “peace” or “whole.” According to the Torah,
people offered peace offerings after surviving life-threatening situations or
fulfilling vows. Peace offerings had nothing to do with sins or regret.
The objects of peace offerings included
 Cattle
 Sheep
 Goats
As with other sacrifices, the animal was cooked. A portion was eaten by the
person making the offering, a portion was eaten by the priests, and a portion
was burned.
Sin offerings
A sin offering serves as an expression of regret for a sin. This kind of sacri-
fice, called chatat (khah-tat), was only appropriate for a sin that was uninten-
tional. One of the Hebrew words for “sin” is chayt (khayt) which actually
means “to miss the mark.”
There were several kinds of offerings made by different people or groups who
committed sins as described in Leviticus 4:1–35. Here are some examples:
 The sin offering made by a High Priest who sinned was a young bull.
 The sin offering made by a community that sinned was a young bull.
104
Part II: One by One: The Books of the Torah 

 The sin offering made by a king who sinned was an unblemished male goat.
 The sin offering made by commoner who sinned was an unblemished
female goat.
Guilt offerings
A guilt offering, known as an asham (ah-shahm), is an offering to atone for
possible sins. When a person thought that perhaps he or she had sinned but
wasn’t completely sure, he or she made a guilt offering. A guilt offering was
also made when knowledge of a past sin was later realized. The Torah
requires a variety of items for the sacrifice depending upon what the person
could afford (Leviticus 5:1–13). The wealthiest people offered a female sheep
or goat. If that couldn’t be afforded, the other choices were two turtledoves,
two common doves, and, for the poorest people, a portion of wheat meal.
105
Chapter 6: “And He Called”: The Book of Leviticus
The purpose of sacrificing animals
The great Torah sage known as the Ramban
(see Chapter 16) says in his Torah commentary
that when a person’s animal sacrifice is being
slaughtered and burned on the altar, his or her
thoughts should include the knowledge that it’s
God’s mercy and generosity that allow us to
substitute a sacrifice in our place (Leviticus 1:9).
Animal rights advocates have a problem with
this subject, asking why it’s necessary to kill a
poor animal in order to feel closer to God? A few
things need to be remembered regarding the
Jewish view toward animals:
 In principle, animals are in the world to
serve people.
 Slaughtering an animal must be done in the
most painless way possible. Jewish laws go
into great detail about how an animal is
slaughtered. To this day, an animal is kosher
(see Chapter 12) because of the type of
animal it is, how it’s prepared, and how it’s
slaughtered.
 Hunting for sport isn’t permissible.
 Pets and animals raised for food must be
treated humanely while they’re alive, and
you must feed your animals before you feed
yourself.
Sacrifice on the altar in the Tabernacle or the
Holy Temple is an ancient ritual intended to raise
one’s consciousness and to purify one’s soul.
Humans are considered the central actors on the
world stage, and sacrificial animals serve
humans in a process that’s mysterious, deeply
psychological, deeply spiritual, and ultimately for
the purpose of elevating the human spirit.
Because God spared the firstborn Children of
Israel during the last plague in Egypt (see
Chapter 5 for details), the Torah teaches that all
firstborn animals have a special connection to
God. While all Creation obviously belongs to
God, firstborn animals are said by the Torah to
“belong” to God in a more profound way.

Surveying the Priestly Duties
The Torah designates Aaron, the brother of Moses, as the source of all future
priests. Aaron was the High Priest and his sons were the first actual priests
who worked in the Tabernacle (in the desert) and in the Holy Temple in
Jerusalem. They supervised the daily and holy day sacrifices. Many of the
verses in the book of Leviticus offer details about the vestments and activities
of the priests and the High Priest. Here are some examples:
 Priests must have no contact with corpses other than close relatives
(Leviticus 21:2).
 Priests must never use God’s names in vain (Leviticus 21:6).
 Priests must not marry divorced women (Leviticus 21:7).
 The High Priest must have no rips in his clothing (Leviticus 21:10).
 The High Priest must wear special clothing or vestments (Leviticus 16:4
and Leviticus 21:10). The details of these vestments are in Exodus 28.
In addition to details about priestly vestments and duties, the book of
Leviticus tells of a powerful and troubling incident concerning the two oldest
sons of Aaron, Nadav (nah-dahv) and Avihu (ah-vee-who). The Torah says
that these two priests offered a “strange fire” to God during their sacrificial
activities. The Torah is blunt and dramatic about it, saying, “Fire came forth
from God and consumed them and they died before God” (Leviticus 10:2).
106
Part II: One by One: The Books of the Torah 
Tracing your lineage back to Aaron, 
the first High Priest
In Hebrew, the word for priest is kohen(ko-hayn).
The popular Jewish surname Cohen comes
from this word, as do surnames like Kahn and
Kahane. Although not completely guaranteed,
it’s usually the case that a Jewish person with
one of these names is a descendant of the orig-
inal priests — and therefore of Aaron himself.
The status of the kohen is passed down in a
patrilineal way (from father to son), and an
unbroken chain exists for 3,300 years and more
than 100 generations! In fact, in the synagogue
Torah service (see Chapter 13), the first person
to be called to the Torah during its public reading
is a direct descendant of Aaron. As amazing as
it seems, Jewish families today usually know if
they descend from Aaron or from the Levites. A
Jew who isn’t a descendant of either is consider
an Israelite.
Genetically, if two people have the same ances-
tor, a genetic marker is present in both of their
DNA. An article published in 1997 in the highly
regarded science journal Nature reported that
DNA analysis revealed that, of 188 Jewish men
who had been told that they were descendants
of Aaron, 98.5 percent of these men shared the
same ancient genetic marker. Since that report,
many other studies have been done and indicate
a clear tradition of shared descent among most
of those today who claim descent from Aaron.

The Torah also clearly says that their “strange fire” was part of a ritual that
was unauthorized and not part of the specific instruction in the Torah.
This incident is the subject of much commentary among the Torah sages
throughout the centuries. The major accusations against the two brothers
and sons of Aaron are as follows:
 They didn’t first consult with Moses.
 Their offering was supposed to be the activity of only the High Priest.
 They may have been drunk at the time of their offering, according to one
Talmudic opinion (see Chapter 3 for more about the Talmud). Drinking
wine before participating in the service was forbidden.
 They used items that were privately owned. According to the Torah, the
utensils used in offerings must be communally owned.
 They entered the Holy of Holies, which was forbidden to all except the
High Priest one day a year (Yom Kippur.) See Chapter 5 for more about
this sacred space in the Tabernacle.
Apart from the specific accusations against Nadav and Avihu, the general
problem is clear: Jewish tradition leaves much room for creativity and fluidity,
but when the Torah provides very specific instructions, it’s unacceptable for
someone in authority to say, “I’m going to do it a different way.”
The Laws of Purity and Impurity
The book of Leviticus contains many of the details that make up the ritual life
of the Jewish people. It also covers many of the laws that comprise the back-
bone of Jewish family life. In the Torah, they’re referred to as laws of purity
and impurity. Many of the 613 commandments also appear in the book of
Leviticus; for more about these commandments, see Appendixes B and C.
Clean and unclean animals
Many aspects of Jewish life have made the Jewish people distinctive among the
other families of the world, and the laws of kashrut (kahsh-root; kosher) are
prominent among them. The book of Leviticus outlines a great number of details
of the laws of eating kosher food; some of these major commandments are
 Among mammals, only those with split hooves and those who chew
their cud are permitted. (Cows are in, but pigs are out.)
 Only sea animals with fins and scales are permitted. (Salmon is okay, but
lobsters are out.)
107
Chapter 6: “And He Called”: The Book of Leviticus

 All insects are forbidden.
 Certain birds are acceptable as food, but others listed in the Torah are
not acceptable. (Chickens and ducks are permitted, but eagles, hawks,
owls, and falcons are not. See Leviticus 11:13–18 for details.)
 Only animals that have been slaughtered properly can be eaten. For
example, you can’t shoot an animal and eat it, nor can you eat an animal
that has died of natural causes.
You can find a more detailed discussion of the Torah’s kosher laws in Chapter 12.
Ritual cleanliness
One of the most misunderstood and maligned parts of Jewish law has to do
with the concept of ritual impurity. The Torah addresses this subject at
length, including the rules about pouring water on one’s hands after leaving a
cemetery and after waking up in the morning, as well as the necessity for
married women to enter and submerge in a mikvah after their menstrual
cycles each month (see Chapter 14 for more about mikvahs). The book of
Leviticus contains instructions regarding a time period after a woman gives
birth when she’s considered to be “ritually impure” (Leviticus 15:19–28).
These laws and commandments about ritual cleanliness have nothing what-
soever to do with physical uncleanness, and they don’t imply that a woman is
inferior, dirty, or in need of a washing after giving birth. These Torah com-
mandments are all of a symbolic and spiritual nature. They have to do with
rebirth, transformation, and renewal. They’re also the original sources for the
Christian practice of baptism.
The laws of tzarat (some call it leprosy)
The book of Leviticus provides an interesting example of how the Torah has
been mistranslated and how mistranslations often get passed from one edition
to the next and from one century to the next. A rather large number of passages
in this section of the Torah deal with a physical condition called tzarat (tzah-raht).
Scholars have determined that this condition is absolutely not leprosy, yet
that’s what it’s called in most English translations of the Torah. Although there
are some similarities between tzarat and leprosy, there are also enough
significant differences to prove conclusively that the Torah isn’t speaking of
leprosy. The condition presented in the book of Leviticus is marked by white
spots on the skin as well as on sheets, houses, and other surfaces.
The important thing about tzarat isn’t the name of the disease but rather the
causes of it. The Torah considers it a punishment for certain disobedience of
Torah commandments, and the Talmud teaches that the infractions include
murder, pride, and theft. But the major wrongdoing that Jewish tradition says
108
Part II: One by One: The Books of the Torah 

causes tzarat is the sin of lashon hara (la-shone hah-rah; evil speech).
Abusive language is a serious crime according to Jewish law, and I go into
detail about this in Chapter 9.
The laws concerning tzarat are complex, and while the Written Torah
addresses tzarat a great detail, the Oral Torah is even more expansive on the
topic. Essentially, it’s the role of the priesthood to identify tzarat, to declare
the person or object as clean or unclean, and to quarantine the person or
object outside the camp for various lengths of time. As with all suffering, the
Torah views the appearance of tzarat mainly as a signal to an individual with
tzarat to examine his or her deeds and to repent.
Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement
One of the most well-known Jewish holy days is Yom Kippur (yome kee-poor),
also known as the Day of Atonement. In the Torah, this holy day is discussed
in the book of Leviticus (as well as in other places). For example, permission
is given to the High Priest alone to enter the Holy of Holies, the most sacred
place in physical space, and to pray to God on behalf of the people. Leviticus
16:1–34 provides some of the details of the Yom Kippur Service as performed
in the Tabernacle, including the sacred vestments required of the High Priest
as well as special Yom Kippur sacrifices and rituals made on behalf of the
community. The hope on Yom Kippur is that the rituals and offerings symbol-
ize the personal repentance and purification on the part of all the people. For
more on Yom Kippur, see Chapter 11.
Sexual laws
Leviticus outlines many of the commandments for men that deal with forbidden
sexual relations. It’s forbidden for men to have sexual relations with the
following people:
 Parents
 Stepmother
 Sister
 Grandchildren
 Half sister
 Aunt
 Daughter-in-law
 Sister-in-law
109
Chapter 6: “And He Called”: The Book of Leviticus

This section of the Torah also contains a controversial commandment directed
at men: “Do not lie with a male as you would with a woman” (Leviticus 18:22).
There are many interpretations of this passage, but Torah commentaries
make it relatively clear that this commandment refers specifically to anal
intercourse between men. (Chapter 9 has more information about sexual laws.)
Holiness laws
The book of Leviticus contains some of the most well-known and highly admired
commandments that form the basis of civilization. The Torah indicates that
observance of these commandments is the basis of a righteous, pure, and holy
lifestyle. These commandments include:
 Respect your parents.
 Observe the Sabbath.
 Don’t make idols.
 Don’t steal.
 Don’t lie.
 Pay employees on time.
 Don’t gossip.
 Don’t hate people in your heart.
 Admonish your neighbor.
 Don’t bear a grudge.
 Love your neighbor as you love yourself.
 Be honest with your weights and measures.
 Honor the elderly.
These commandments are followed by a number of commandments that aren’t
obvious moral ideas but are just as important in Jewish tradition. They include:
 Don’t plant fields with different species in them.
 Don’t wear garments that contain a mixture of linen and wool.
 Don’t eat blood.
 Don’t follow astrology.
 Don’t shave the corners of your beard or the corners of your head
(which is why many Jewish men wear beards!).
 Don’t wear tattoos.
Appendixes B and C cover these and other commandments found throughout
Leviticus and the rest of the Torah.
110
Part II: One by One: The Books of the Torah 

Priestly laws
Toward the end of the book of Leviticus, the Torah reviews some of the laws
that specifically pertain to the priesthood. For example, the laws deal with
whom priests are and aren’t allowed to marry, forbidden contact (a priest can’t
have contact with a corpse, for example), and conditions that disqualify a
priest, such as certain physical blemishes that prohibit a priest from partici-
pating in an offering (Leviticus 21:16–23).
After presenting these details, Leviticus outlines the major Jewish holy days
including:
 Shabbat: This is a weekly day of rest.
“For six days labor may be done, and the seventh day is a day of complete
rest.” (Leviticus 23:3)
 Passover: This holy day period commemorates the exodus from Egypt.
“You shall eat matzos for a seven day period.” (Leviticus 23:6)
 Shavuot: This holy day commemorates the receiving of the Torah.
“This day shall be celebrated as a sacred holy day.” (Leviticus 23:21)
 Rosh Hashanah: This holy day is a the start of a new year and begins an
intense ten-day period of prayer and introspection.
“The first day of the seventh month shall be a day of rest.” (Leviticus 23:24)
 Yom Kippur: This holy day is known as the Day of Atonement and is the
climax of the intense ten-day period of self-reflection and prayer.
“It is a day of atonement, when you gain atonement before God.”
(Leviticus 23:28)
 Sukkot: This holy day period commemorates the Children of Israel’s
experience of wandering in the desert and living in temporary shelter.
“The fifteenth of the seventh month shall be the festival of Succot.”
(Leviticus 23:33)
 The Sabbatical Year: The Torah requires that the farmland in Israel rest
every seventh year.
“For six years you may plant your fields, prune your vineyards, and harvest
your crops. But the seventh year is a Sabbath of Sabbaths for the land.”
(Leviticus 25:3)
 The Jubilee Year: This year, according to the Torah, is when debts are
canceled out and people return to the lands that their ancestors originally
owned.
“You shall count seven sabbatical years, that is seven times seven
years.” (Leviticus 25:8)
111
Chapter 6: “And He Called”: The Book of Leviticus

Each Jewish holy day or holy day period has its own customs, laws, history,
and significance. But all have one thing in common: the constant goal of inner
refinement and purification. The details of each holy day ultimately focus on
these goals. I discuss these days in more detail in Chapter 11.
Reward and punishment
The book of Leviticus ends with an exploration of reward and punishment.
Essentially, the Torah says that if you live a pure life and follow the divine
commandments in the Torah, you’ll reap rewards. And if you don’t live such a
life, you’ll suffer consequences.
It’s important to keep in mind the great Jewish sages’ teaching that a funda-
mental principle in Jewish tradition is reincarnation. The idea is that your
soul existed before your current body, and when you die, the soul drops that
body. If you haven’t fulfilled your tasks in this lifetime, you come back and get
additional chances. (For a full exploration of this concept in Jewish thought,
see my book Kabbalah For Dummies, published by Wiley).
Reward and punishment don’t occur immediately. Ultimately, God is the True
Judge as well as the ultimate bestower of understanding and compassion. God
knows what’s in your heart, what you’re capable of, and what you ultimately
deserve.

“In the Wilderness”: 
The Book of Numbers
In This Chapter
 Taking a census of the Children of Israel
 Getting a grip on some important laws
 Recapping the journey through the desert
L
ike each of the other books in the Torah, the book of Numbers has a
different name in Hebrew: Bamidbar (bih-mid-bar; in the wilderness). It’s
somewhat understandable that the Greek translation is “the book of Numbers”
because the book begins with a lengthy census of the Children of Israel in 
the desert. But the book of Numbers is really an account of the 40 years the
Israelites spent wandering from Egypt to the Promised Land, the Land of Israel.
The trip didn’t have to take as long as it did. If the Children of Israel had fol-
lowed a straight route, the journey would have taken far less time. But the 40
years in the desert, which I describe in this chapter, transformed the Children
of Israel into a nation capable of defending itself and establishing itself as an
organized group. The trials in the desert (of which there were many) forged
them into a nation with a deep commitment and faith and obedience to God.
Also, enough time passed in the desert for a new generation to be born — a
generation without the slave mentality that those who left Egypt unfortunately
couldn’t fully shake.
Counting the Children of Israel
The book of Numbers begins with a command by God to Moses and his
brother Aaron to take a census of the Israelites. In the following sections, I
explain the results of the census of the Twelve Tribes of Israel and tell you
about an exception to the census: the tribe of Levi.

114
Part II: One by One: The Books of the Torah
Organizing the Twelve Tribes of Israel
The purpose of the census was to count those members of each major family
(sometimes called a tribe) who were qualified for military duty, defined by the
Torah as all males over age 20. Each of the Twelve Tribes of Israel descends
from one of the 12 sons of the patriarch Jacob, whose name was changed by
God to “Israel.” The sons of Jacob/Israel were literally the “fathers” of the
tribes, as each tribe bore the name of one of the sons. When the Children of
Israel left Egypt, they did so as tribes — that is, as huge family groups each of
whom descended from one of the sons of Israel. When the Children of Israel
arrived at Mount Sinai to receive the Torah, they camped around the moun-
tain as tribes. When they finally arrived in the Holy Land, they settled in sepa-
rate areas as tribes. Each tribe had its own flag, traits, special abilities, and
other distinctive characteristics.
Each tribe also was organized patrilineally, or by the father, during the census.
My last name, for example, is Kurzweil because it’s customary to take the last
name of your father, who took the last name of his father, and so on. This is
exactly how the census and the tribes of Israel in the book of Numbers were
organized — by the father: “Take a census of the entire community of the
Children of Israel and do it following the paternal line” (Numbers 1:2).
Here’s the result of the census:
 Asher: 41,500
 Benjamin: 35,400
 Dan: 62,700
 Ephraim: 40,500
 Gad: 45,650
 Issachar: 54,400
 Manasseh: 32,200
 Naphtali: 53,400
 Reuven: 46,500
 Shimon: 59,300
 Yehuda: 74,600
 Zebulun: 57,400
The total came to 603,550 male Israelites over 20 years of age divided among
12 tribes. In Jewish literature throughout the ages, this number is often
rounded to 600,000.
It has been taught that the word “Israel,” which actually means “a person of
God,” can also be an acronym for the phrase Yesh Shishim Ribo Otiot LaTorah,

which means “There are 600,000 letters in the Torah.” In Chapter 14, which
covers writing a Torah scroll, you see that this claim isn’t literally true. There
are actually a little over 300,000 letters in the Torah. But Jewish spiritual tradi-
tion suggests that the figure of 600,000 comes from a special way of counting
not only the letters but also other marks that appear on a Torah scroll. The
Jewish people are taught to see themselves as “letters in the Torah” and as
part of a whole. It’s a goal in life for each Jewish person to find his or her own
letter — that is, his or her own special task that belongs to nobody else.
Appointing the Levites to serve
in the Tabernacle
The only people not counted in the census were those from the tribe of Levi,
who were put in charge of the Tabernacle and its holy items. (The Tabernacle
was the portable holy space set up each time the Israelites stopped their
wandering in the desert; see Chapter 5 for more details about the Tabernacle.)
The beginning of the book of Numbers says, “Take a census of the entire
assembly of the Children of Israel according to their families, according to
their fathers’ household” (Numbers 1:2). After the Torah gives the numerical
results of the census of each tribe, it says, “The Levites according to their
fathers’ tribe were not counted among them” (Numbers 1:47). The text of 
the Torah goes on to say, “God spoke to Moses saying ‘But you shall not
count the tribe of Levi, and you shall not take a census of them . . . you shall
appoint the Levites to be in charge of the Tabernacle’” (Numbers 1:48–50).
The tribe of Levi was divided into two groups:
 Kohanim (ko-ha-neem; priests) were the priests who served in the
Tabernacle and performed the ritual sacrifices (see Chapter 6 for more
about these sacrifices).
 Leviyim (leh-vee-eem; the priests’ assistants) took the Tabernacle apart
before the Israelites traveled, carried the parts of the Tabernacle as they
traveled, and constructed the Tabernacle when the Israelites stopped.
The Leviyim also sang every day in the Tabernacle.
When the Tabernacle was built, each tribe had a specific spot around the
structure of the Tabernacle in which to set up camp (see Figure 7-1). The
Torah provides detailed instructions as to how the Tabernacle was to be set
up at each rest stop:
 The Tabernacle was built in the middle.
 The Levites set up their tents around the Tabernacle.
 The other families set up their tents around the tents of the Levites in a
precise formation detailed in the Torah.
 A special flag assigned to each tribe by God was displayed.
115
Chapter 7: “In the Wilderness”: The Book of Numbers

The Torah doesn’t give reasons for the arrangement of the tribes in their
precise configuration, but Torah commentators throughout the ages have
weighed in on the issue and have come up with many ideas, from the mystical
to thoughts about the creation of order itself. Some commentators point out that
the beginning of the Torah speaks of the original chaos of existence and that the
precise details of the layout of the camp of tribes suggest that it’s a task of
humankind to bring order to the world, to harness its energy and elevate it.
Looking at a Few Important Laws
The Torah has a habit of sticking important commandments and laws in
seemingly strange places. Right in the middle of one subject you can find a
divine edict that appears to have little to do with the surrounding text. But
every detail of the Torah has divine intention; nothing in the Torah is left up
to chance. Many commentators throughout the ages have offered insights to
explain why it is that, on the surface, some passages don’t seem to fit, but
when you look at them on deeper levels, the connections are meaningful.
A good example of this characteristic of the Torah is the number of important
teachings that appear in the book of Numbers right after the census. I review
some of the most prominent and important ones in the following sections.
Confessing sins
The Torah teaches the importance of confession. If you do something wrong
to another person, you have to make it up to the person by abiding by the
Figure 7-1:
The
arrangement
of the
Tabernacle.
116
Part II: One by One: The Books of the Torah

instruction of Jewish law. For example, when something is stolen, in some
cases the thief has to pay double the value of the object. But he also has to
confess, out loud, to God.
The book of Numbers says, “He must confess the sin he has committed” (Numbers
5:7). The great Jewish sage Maimonides defines the process of confession in his
writings. According to Jewish law, that process has three essential parts:
 Acknowledgment of the sin
 Remorse for the sin
 Resolution that the sin will never be committed again
Every infraction of the Torah deserves confession. If you gossip, steal, dese-
crate Shabbat, eat non-kosher food, lie, slander, worship idols, embarrass
someone publicly, fail to give charity, judge someone too harshly, commit
adultery, and so on, confession is essential.
Addressing adultery
Like it or not, polygamy was practiced in ancient times. Specifically, it was
the practice of a husband with more than one wife, not the reverse. Suspicion
of adultery, therefore, meant suspicion that a wife was intimately involved
with a man other than her husband. In Numbers 5:11–29, the Torah outlines
what’s done in the case of a suspected adulteress.
The central part of the process is this: A priest created a special mixture that
the suspected woman had to drink. If she was guilty, the drink caused her
belly to burst and her sexual organs to rupture. The suspected woman was
allowed to refuse the drink and proceed to dissolve the marriage. It’s likely
that a woman of faith who was guilty wouldn’t want to drink the formula and
would probably confess.
Throughout the ages, commentators have offered a variety of ways to look at
this process, most of them focusing on the importance of the sanctity of
marriage. The procedure has traditionally been seen as one involving divine
intervention; it worked by way of a miracle. But the fear that the ritual
procedure would actually work surely served as a deterrent.
The laws of the Nazirite
Numbers 6:1–21 presents an interesting option for someone who wanted to
enter into an intense state of discipline, constraint, and spiritual devotion.
The category is known as nazir (nah-zeer; separated or consecrated), and the
117
Chapter 7: “In the Wilderness”: The Book of Numbers

person who made a vow to be a nazirite had to commit himself to do the
following for at least 30 days:
 Abstain from wine
 Refrain from cutting one’s hair and beard
 Avoid dead bodies and graves
Jewish tradition teaches that the primary purpose of entering into this state
is to combat sexual temptation. But becoming a nazirite was also part of a
process of fighting pride as well as acquiring spiritual gifts and even the
power of prophecy (according to some).
The Priestly Blessing
One of the most well-known passages in the entire Torah is the Priestly
Blessing. In the book of Numbers, God directs Moses to tell Aaron and his
sons (all of whom are priests) to bless the Israelites with the following words:
May God bless you and keep you.
May God shine His face upon you and be gracious to you.
May God direct His providence toward you and give you peace.
Numbers 6:24–27
Jewish tradition teaches that the priests held their arms up over the people as
they blessed them. They also held their fingers in a special way and brought
their hands together, as shown in Figure 7-2. When the fingers of each hand
are positioned properly, they form the Hebrew letter “shin,” which is the first
letter of Shaddai (shah-die), a name for God that implies God’s infinite power
and strength. Do you remember how Star Trek’s Mr. Spock held his hand when
he gave the Vulcan sign and said, “Live long and prosper”? Leonard Nimoy, the
actor who played the part, based this hand configuration on the blessing of
the priests as taught in Jewish tradition.
A number of laws are connected to the Priestly Blessing, including the following:
 While customs vary, the blessing is part of the daily liturgy and is also
part of the liturgy of most major Jewish festivals.
 A priest must not be under the influence of alcohol when he recites the
blessing.
 Many parents recite the blessing each Friday evening at the Shabbat
table to bless their children.

Part II: One by One: The Books of the Torah

Witnessing Some Wild Events
in the Desert
The book of Numbers records many incidents that took place as the Children
of Israel traveled through the desert during the 40 years of wandering. It’s
understandable that an experience like wandering in the desert for so many
years could provoke rebellion and impatience. Much of the book of Numbers
describes these kind of incidents, all of which were ultimately designed by
God to strengthen the Israelites’ faith, resolve, and trust in God. God was
grooming Israel not simply to be a nation but to be a holy nation, steadfast in
its faith and dedication to God and God’s commandments.
Complaining about manna
One incident occurred when some of the Israelites complained that they were
fed up (no pun intended) with eating manna every day (see Chapter 5 for more
about manna). Even though the manna was delicious and one tradition says
that it would taste like anything one wanted it to taste like, some of the Children
of Israel wanted meat. They said, “We also remember the fish we ate in Egypt,
along with cucumbers, melons, leeks, onions and garlic.”
Moses spoke to God and told Him that some of the people were complaining
bitterly. God told Moses to tell the people to prepare to receive all the meat
they wanted. In fact, the Torah says, “God is going to give you meat and you
will have to eat it. You will not eat it for a day or two, nor five nor ten nor
Figure 7-2:
The Priestly
Blessing.
119
Chapter 7: “In the Wilderness”: The Book of Numbers

twenty days. You will eat it for an entire month until you are stuffed and sick
of it” (Numbers 11:18–20). And that’s just what happened. The Torah records
that lots of people became ill and died.
The journey in the wilderness for 40 years was designed by God to forge the
Children of Israel into a spiritual nation steadfast in its faith and trust in God.
God’s reaction to their petty complaints served, as most good punishments
should, to strengthen the people and to show them that the best approach is
to trust God.
Miriam’s sin and punishment
A brief but important incident involving the siblings of Moses, Miriam and
Aaron, is recorded in Numbers 12:1–15. Miriam spoke privately to Aaron about
Moses, questioning the state of Moses’s marriage and also questioning whether
Moses was the only one to whom God spoke. This gossip was punishable by
God, so God punished Miriam by giving her the condition known as tzarat
(see Chapter 6 for more about tzarat as a punishment for evil speech and
gossip in particular).
Aaron pleaded with Moses, asking him to pray on behalf of Miriam. Moses
said, El nah refa nah-la (ehl nah reh-fah nah-lah; O Lord, make her well).
Moses prayed, and in a week Miriam was cured.
This story isn’t an illustration of a cruel and harsh God but rather of the process
of purification, discipline, and the highest standards necessary to prepare the
Jewish people for their task and role as a priesthood for the world.
The report of spies to the Holy Land
The Torah indicates that God’s intention was to get the Children of Israel
from Egypt to the Holy Land as soon as possible, but entry into the Promised
Land took preparation, from the hardships in Egypt to the trials in the desert.
After all, the Promised Land is unlike anywhere on earth; for the Jewish
people, it’s the focal point of physical life.
When the Israelites were getting close to their destination, God instructed
Moses to send out a group of men to take a peek at the Promised Land. Moses
gathered one representative from each of the 12 tribes (I cover these tribes
earlier in this chapter) and gave them the assignment to find out the following:
 What kind of land is it?
 Are the people living there strong or weak?
 Are they few or many?
120
Part II: One by One: The Books of the Torah

 Are their communities open or fortified?
 Is the land good or bad?
 Is the soil rich or weak?
 Are there trees?
 Bring back some samples of the fruit growing there
The men set off to investigate the Promised Land. The Torah describes their
40-day journey in Numbers 13:1–14:10. When they returned, they issued their
report to Moses, Aaron, and the entire community; here’s what they found:
 The land is flowing with milk and honey.
 The fruit is terrific.
 The people are aggressive types.
 Their cities are fortified.
 The people are giants. We felt like tiny grasshoppers.
When the people heard the report, they shouted, complained, and wept. As
was their practice (see Chapter 5), they complained to Moses and told him
that they wished they had never left Egypt. They wanted to know why God
would bring them to a place where they would be killed, and they even con-
sidered deposing Moses, appointing a new leader, and going back to Egypt! At
this point, the Torah says that Moses and Aaron “fell on their faces”
(Numbers 14:5).
Two of the 12 spies spoke up and gave this minority report:
 The land we explored is fantastic.
 If God brought us this far, we can enter the land.
 It is indeed flowing with milk and honey.
 Don’t rebel against God.
 Don’t be afraid of the people who are there.
 God is with us — don’t be afraid.
The community didn’t much care for this report and threatened to stone the
two spies to death.
By this time, the Torah indicates, God was growing impatient. “How long shall
this nation continue to provoke me? How long will they not believe in Me,
despite all the miracles that I have done?” (Numbers 14:11). Moses pleaded
with God to forgive the people, and his words included one of the most
important descriptions of God: “God is slow to anger, great in love, and for-
giving of sin and rebellion” (Numbers 14:18).
121
Chapter 7: “In the Wilderness”: The Book of Numbers

Moses was successful in convincing God to forgive the Israelites’ rebellion.
But God said, “I will grant forgiveness as you have requested . . . but I will
punish all those who tried to test me . . . They will not see the land I promised
to their ancestors” (Numbers 14:20–23). The only exceptions were Caleb and
Joshua, the two spies who issued the minority report. They saw the Promised
Land. The rest of the Children of Israel wandered in the desert for 40 years
and eventually died. Only the children and grandchildren, who weren’t in
Egypt and weren’t part of all the rebellions against God in the desert, entered
the Land of Israel.
Who does Moses think he is? 
Korach’s rebellion
As the book of Numbers makes clear in verses 16:1–35, things didn’t go smoothly
for Moses, and Korach’s rebellion was just one more headache. Korach was a
great grandson of Levi and therefore a great grandson of the patriarch Jacob.
He was also a wealthy man who decided to gather some followers and stage a
rebellion against Moses. Why? Korach challenged Moses’s leadership and
expressed the desire to be the High Priest. He said to Moses, “All the people
in the community are holy . . . why are you setting yourself above everyone
else?” (Numbers 16:3). The Torah says that Korach had 250 followers, and
among them were some of the most well-known leaders of the Israelites.
The great Torah commentators are actually somewhat sympathetic to Korach.
After all, Korach wanted to serve God and wanted to participate more fully in
the spiritual activities in the Tabernacle. But someone else got there first
when Moses selected Aaron to be the High Priest at the direction of God.
In the face of Korach’s rebellion, Moses prayed for divine guidance and then
told Korach that he and Aaron should both bring pans of fire and burn incense
on the altar. They did as Moses had instructed, and ultimately the ground
opened up and swallowed Korach and his cohorts. Then a fire descended
from heaven and destroyed all the people who supported the rebellion.
The Torah reports that the entire community protested so much that God
was about to destroy them too. Aaron offered a sacrifice, and although 14,700
people died, the plague against them stopped.
The great Torah commentators have a lot to say about Korach and his rebellion.
They make a major point: Korach acted based on jealousy and ego, not on a
pure desire to do God’s will. The moral of this story from the book of Numbers
is made clear in the famous book of the Oral Torah called The Sayings of the
Fathers: “Any controversy which is for the sake of Heaven will endure; and that
which is not for the sake of Heaven will not endure. What is a controversy 
that is for the sake of Heaven? The controversy between Hillel and Shammai.
122
Part II: One by One: The Books of the Torah

And which is not for the sake of Heaven? The controversy of Korach and all
his faction” (Avot 5:17). In other words, there’s nothing wrong with questions
or challenges of authority — as long as the motives are pure.
Getting water from a rock
The book of Numbers relates that at a certain point the Children of Israel
didn’t have any water (Numbers 20:2–12). The people once again “gathered
against Moses and Aaron” (Numbers 20:2). As they had in the past, the
people demanded to know why Moses brought them into the wilderness from
Egypt, where they had enough to eat and to drink, to the desert, which they
described as a “terrible place” (Numbers 20:5). Moses and Aaron prayed to
God for guidance.
God told Moses to take the staff and gather the people. God then instructed
Moses to speak to the rock and promised that water would come out of the
rock; God said that the rock would provide enough water for the people and
for their animals. Moses angrily said to the people, “Listen to me, you rebels.
Shall we bring water from this rock?” (Numbers 20:10). At that moment,
Moses lifted his hands and struck the rock twice with the staff. A great quan-
tity of water began flowing from the rock, providing the community with
plenty of water.
But God didn’t tell Moses to strike the rock in anger; God asked Moses for faith.
As a result of the anger that Moses expressed by striking the rock, he and
Aaron were punished. God said them, “Because you did not believe in Me . . .
you will not bring this congregation to the Land that I have given them”
(Numbers 20:12). This episode in the Torah has great significance, not only as a
story about the importance of having faith in God but also as an illustration
that Moses was just a human being. Unlike other religious traditions in which
followers end up revering and even worshipping their leaders, in Judaism,
Moses may have been the greatest prophet and teacher but he also was
mortal, imperfect, and punished for his errors.
The death of Aaron
The death of Aaron, brother of Moses, High Priest, and ancestor of all priests
forever, seems like an aside in the Torah text. Numbers 20:27–29 says, “Moses
did as God commanded in full view of the whole community. They went up
Mount Hor. Moses stripped Aaron of his robes and gave them to Aaron’s son,
Eleazar. Aaron died there on the mountaintop. When Moses and Eleazar came
down from the mountain, the Israelite community saw that Aaron had died
and the people mourned for thirty days.”
123
Chapter 7: “In the Wilderness”: The Book of Numbers

And that’s about it. The rest is up to the Oral Torah (known as the Talmud;
see Chapter 3), which fills in the blanks and helps you to picture the scene.
One well-known story from the oral tradition teaches that Moses woke up
early and approached his brother Aaron. Moses told Aaron that during the
night he (Moses) was studying the story of Adam and Eve and was thinking
about the fact that Adam brought death into the world through his sin. Moses
told Aaron that death was inevitable for both of them and asked Aaron how
much more time he thought they had. Aaron said that he didn’t think they
had too much longer to live, and then Moses told Aaron that God said it was
Aaron’s time to die.
Judaism is a tradition that considers life to be sacred and holy, and yet it
faces death realistically. When God decides that it’s a person’s time to die, it
may be sad for those left behind, but it’s different for the deceased, whose
soul continues on beyond the body. (Check out Chapter 12 for more about
Jewish views on death.)
Balak and Bilaam
Belief in angels is an important part of Jewish life. The Torah story of Balak
(bah-lahk) and Bilaam (bih-lahm) is partly about an angel (Numbers 22:1–24:25).
After almost 40 years in the desert, the Children of Israel were finally close to
the Promised Land. The rich and successful King of Moab, Balak, felt threatened
by Moses and the Israelites because they’d successfully battled a few kings
during their wandering (see Chapter 5 for an example). Balak contacted Bilaam,
a prophet, and told him to curse the Children of Israel. Bilaam refused after God
told him not to do it. After repeated orders from Balak to curse the Children of
Israel, Bilaam continued to receive prophetic messages from God to refrain from
cursing the Israelites.
Bilaam traveled to see Balak, but on the road his donkey suddenly stopped,
refused to continue, and veered off the road. Bilaam beat the donkey until it
began to speak, telling Bilaam that it had never failed him, so the beating
wasn’t justified. The donkey said that it stopped moving because it saw an
angel standing before them wielding a sword. Bilaam then saw the angel as
well and knew that it was sent by God. Had the donkey not stopped, Bilaam
would have been killed by the angel’s sword.
Like every story in the Torah, the episode of Balak and Bilaam is rich with
meaning. One of my teachers says that a major moral of the story of Balak and
Bilaam is that everyone ultimately answers to God. Balak used his position as
King to attempt to pressure and use a prophet of God for his own evil reasons.
Jewish tradition addresses the question of why good things happen to bad
people in different ways. The Torah utilizes the story of Balak and Bilaam to
remind the reader that the sinner will ultimately fail, even if he’s a king with
124
Part II: One by One: The Books of the Torah

everything going for him today. A benevolent God will give him enough rope
and then exact a penalty. Napoleon met his Waterloo, and Bilaam was
disgraced by his she-ass.
One of the most well-known verses in the Torah comes from Bilaam
(Numbers 24:5). When Balak sent Bilaam to the top of a mountain to curse
the Israelites, God caused the opposite to happen: Bilaam saw the Israelites
and said, Ma-tovu oha-leicha Ya’akov (mah toe-voo oh-ha leh-khah ya-ah-
cove; How good are your tents, O Jacob). These are the very words that Jews
recite whenever they enter a synagogue to pray.
The boundaries of the Holy Land
Near the end of the book of Numbers, the Torah defines the precise bound-
aries of the Holy Land. Needless to say, the impact of these verses continues
to reverberate today. After centuries, the Jewish people have reclaimed the
Holy Land, and in 1948, with the support of the United Nations, the Jewish
people established the modern state of Israel. Some Jews have lived in the
region throughout history, but since the destruction of the Holy Temple in
Jerusalem in 70 CE, the Jewish people have mostly lived in exile. But they’ve
held onto the dream of returning to the Holy Land promised by and given by
God as recorded in the Torah.
Chapter 34 of the book of Numbers provides the exact details of the bound-
aries of the Holy Land. The Torah begins by defining the extreme southeast
border, then the western boundary, followed by the north, east, and south
boundaries. One of the reasons the precise boundaries are important is that
there are some commandments in the Torah that are only applicable for
people who are actually in the Holy Land. One example is the Sabbatical Year.
In Leviticus 25:1–6, the Torah states that God says, “When you come to the
land that I am giving you, the land must be given a rest period. For six years
you may plant your fields . . . but the seventh year is a Sabbath of Sabbaths
for the land. It is God’s Sabbath during which you may not plant your fields
nor prune your vineyards. . . .”
This is just one of many Torah commandments that’s dependent on precise
knowledge of the boundaries of the Holy Land. Of course, the precise bound-
aries also have profound political implications. The Holy Land is the ancient
homeland of the Children of Israel. Since the time when the Jewish people
were conquered and banished, Jews have been well-known victims in the
lands of other people. The worst chapter of Jewish history occurred a mere 65
years ago during the Holocaust, when one out of every three Jews in the world
was murdered. Today, the Jewish people have reclaimed their Promised Land
and have a security that they haven’t known for many centuries.

“Words”: The Book 
of Deuteronomy
In This Chapter
 Listening to Moses review the major teachings of the Torah
 Reviewing the Ten Commandments and the major Jewish statement of faith
 Revisiting some of the most important laws in Jewish life
 Witnessing the death of Moses
L
ike those of the first four books of Moses, the name “Deuteronomy”
comes from the Greek translation known as the Septuagint. In Greek,
“Deuteronomy” means “the repetition of the law” or the “second law.” In large
part, this book of the Torah records three speeches by Moses as he bids
farewell to the Children of Israel before his death; in the three speeches,
Moses repeats many of the things he has previously taught.
The Jewish people refer to Deuteronomy as Devarim (deh-vah-reem; words).
The book begins, “These are the words which Moses spoke to all of Israel.”
Very little “happens” in the fifth book of the Torah, and yet I can easily argue
that the book of Deuteronomy is the richest of the Five Books of Moses. The
first four books are filled with drama and intrigue: The universe is created, 
the patriarchs and matriarchs of the Jewish people establish the Jewish family,
the Children of Israel are slaves in Egypt (and finally find their freedom), the
people rebel many times, they fight their enemies, and they encounter God at
Mount Sinai, among many other things.
But the book of Deuteronomy, as its Hebrew title suggests, is mostly words.
These words are basically a long sermon in which Moses, knowing that he
would soon die, tried one last time to teach the Torah to the Children of
Israel. The Children of Israel gathered on the east bank of the Jordan River,
and, as the Torah says, “Moses spoke to the Israelites regarding all that God
had commanded” (Deuteronomy 1:2).

The First Discourse of Moses
Moses began the first of three discourses to the Children of Israel by reminisc-
ing. It isn’t surprising that he started his farewell speech by remembering what
he and the people had been through together. It’s also natural that Moses, who
knew that he would die soon, then focused on the fact that he wasn’t going
with the people to the Promised Land. It’s as though he said to them, “This is
where I get off.” But before he “went,” Moses started telling his people of the
foundations of Judaism, and he stressed that God is at the center of all being.
Recalling 40 years of wandering
in the desert
With the Children of Israel camped at the banks of the Jordan River overlook-
ing the Land of Israel (the Promised Land), Moses began the first part of his
talk by looking back at some of the major events that took place following the
exodus from Egypt. Included in Moses’s summary are these key points:
 God gave the Promised Land to the Jewish people.
“I have placed the land before you,” said Moses. “Come and occupy the
land that God swore He would give your fathers, Abraham, Isaac and
Jacob, and to their descendants.” (Deuteronomy 1:8)
 Moses, not being able to settle all the conflicts among the people by
himself, established a system of courts to settle disputes.
“Designate people who are wise, understanding and known to your
tribes and I will appoint them as your leaders.” (Deuteronomy 1:13)
 Moses assured the people many times not to be afraid but rather to
trust in God.
“Do not be afraid and do not be concerned.” (Deuteronomy 1:21)
 Moses sent spies to check out the land to which they were headed and
instructed them to report back on what they had found.
“I appointed twelve men, one from each tribe.” (Deuteronomy 1:23)
 Moses reminded the Children of Israel of their frequent rebellions.
“You rebelled against God, your Lord.” (Deuteronomy 1:26)
 God saw that most of those who were slaves in Egypt weren’t spiritually
ready to live in the Promised Land, so He decided that the generations
born after the exodus would enter the Promised Land.
“Nobody of this evil generation will see the good land that I swore to
give to your fathers.” (Deuteronomy 1:35)
128
Part II: One by One: The Books of the Torah 

 Moses was forbidden to enter the Promised Land.
“You also will not enter the Land.” (Deuteronomy 1:37)
 While wandering toward the Promised Land, the Children of Israel
encountered hostile foes. They avoided some of them, fought victori-
ously against others, and finally arrived at the Promised Land.
“The Lord, your God, has given you this land as a heritage.”
(Deuteronomy 3:18)
Asking permission to enter the Promised
Land (permission denied)
My teacher is fond of teaching that in Judaism there are no “plastic saints.”
What my teacher means by that is that there are no perfect heroes in
Judaism. Every person, including Moses — the greatest teacher and prophet
who ever lived — is imperfect. Moses had moments of weakness and made
lots of mistakes. It was because of one of these flaws that Moses wasn’t
permitted to enter the Promised Land. While wandering in the desert, God
told Moses to speak to a rock in order to get water from it. Instead, Moses
struck the rock with his rod, displaying not only anger but also a lack of faith.
As punishment, God refused to let Moses enter the Land of Israel. (You can
read more about this story in Chapter 7.)
Moses asked God to change this decree on a number of occasions. In the
book of Deuteronomy, Moses reminded the Children of Israel that he prayed
to God, asking to be permitted to enter the Land, but that God refused. God,
like a parent who says “I’m not going to say it again,” tells Moses, “Do not
continue to speak with Me about this matter” (Deuteronomy 3:26).
Instead of entering the Land of Israel, God instructed Moses to climb on top
of a mountain so that he could see the land that the Children of Israel would
inherit for all eternity.
Teaching the foundation of faith
The bulk of the book of Deuteronomy consists of teachings and laws. Moses
makes a number of declarations that are fundamental to Judaism. I para-
phrase some of the more important ones here:
 When you listen to the teachings of the Torah and do them, you will
remain alive (Deuteronomy 4:1).
In Jewish thought “alive” and “dead” have much more profound meaning
than the literal senses of the words. Someone alive can be considered
dead and vice versa. Jewish thought sees a person as an eternal soul
129
Chapter 8: “Words”: The Book of Deuteronomy

with a temporary body, so if that person follows God’s teachings, he will
surely die physically, but his soul will remain alive. Likewise, a person who
lives a life of sin is alive but in Jewish thought can be considered dead.
 Don’t add or subtract from the word of God (Deuteronomy 4:2).
The Torah is considered perfect. According to Jewish tradition, it’s
unthinkable for someone to come along claiming that the Torah includes
verses that it’s never had or that there are verses that don’t belong in
the Torah.
 Keep all the commandments (Deuteronomy 4:2).
The Torah urges Jews to observe all the commandments that are possible
for them to perform. In fact, it’s impossible for everyone to keep all the
commandments. For example, some commandments are just for women
or just for men, and some can only be performed in the Holy Land. Others
can only be performed by the King of Israel (when there is one).
 Safeguard the laws (Deuteronomy 4:6).
Jewish law has developed many ancillary laws that serve to protect the
laws. For example, although some say it’s technically permissible to play
a musical instrument on Shabbat, it’s not permissible to tune the guitar
on Shabbat because that would involve altering the world. To insure that
a person doesn’t transgress and unconsciously tune the instrument, a
safeguard is added to the law forbidding that the instrument be played.
 When the Children of Israel follow God’s teachings, the nations of the
world will see them as a great nation, wise and understanding.
(Deuteronomy 4:6)
Jewish thought conceives of the nations of the world as different parts
of one single body, so when any part of the body is injured or ill, it
impacts the entire body. The Jewish people are a vital organ of the body.
 Do not forget the history of the Jewish people (Deuteronomy 4:9).
It is a principle of Jewish life that its family history be recalled. The
Jewish holy day of Passover, when families gather to retell the story of
the Children of Israel and their exodus from Egypt, is just one of many
times when Jewish law commands that history be remembered.
 Teach your children and your children’s children the ways of God
(Deuteronomy 4:9).
Universal education has always been a fact of Jewish life. All Jewish
children are required to be literate in order to spend a lifetime learning
the teachings of the Torah. The Jewish people have had an almost 100
percent literacy rate for centuries.
 Do not depict God with any physical image or symbol. God is not like an
animal, nor is God male or female (Deuteronomy 4:16).
130
Part II: One by One: The Books of the Torah 

My teacher taught me that it’s difficult to be Jewish. As he said, “One must
establish a personal relationship with a God that you cannot conceive of.”
My teacher also taught me that if you ever think you know God, one thing
is certain: You’re wrong. God is beyond anything a person can imagine.
 Do not bow down to the sun nor the moon nor the stars 
(Deuteronomy 4:19).
The prohibition of idolatry is at the core of Jewish life. This prohibition
not only pertains to the creation of statues; many people seem to worship
money, for example, and this is a modern form of idolatry.
 Do not forget the covenant the God made with the Children of Israel
(Deuteronomy 4:23).
The Torah is, in a sense, a contract between God and the Jewish people.
The idea of a covenant is frequently discussed in Jewish texts, beginning
with the Torah. God basically says to Abraham and to all the Jewish
people: If you keep My teachings, I’ll do my part for you.
Stressing allegiance to God
The Jewish people are a theocentric family, which means that God is at the
center of all being and is the center of life. In the book of Deuteronomy,
Moses stresses the fundamental importance of the Children of Israel remaining
loyal to God and God’s teachings. For example, Moses teaches that
 If the Children of Israel become idolaters, they will be banished from the
Holy Land (Deuteronomy 4:25–26).
 If the Children of Israel become idolaters, they will be scattered among
the nations and will serve man-made gods, but when “you will begin to
seek God, and pursue God with all your heart and soul, you will find God”
(Deuteronomy 4:29).
 When the Children of Israel stray from God but then try to return to God,
they will be able to do so (Deuteronomy 4:30).
 God will never abandon or destroy the Children of Israel; God will not
forget the promises He made to them (Deuteronomy 4:31).
Moses concludes his first discourse by saying, “Realize today and ponder it
in your heart that God is the Supreme Being in heaven above and on earth
below. There is no other. Keep God’s decrees and commandments that I am
presenting to you today, and God will be good to you and to your children.
Then you will exist for a long time in the land that the Lord, your God, is
giving to you for all time” (Deuteronomy 4:40).
131
Chapter 8: “Words”: The Book of Deuteronomy

The Second Discourse of Moses
The second of the three discourses delivered by Moses to the Children of
Israel is really the heart of the book of Deuteronomy. In this second speech,
Moses repeats the Ten Commandments (they’re enumerated earlier in the
Torah), teaches the most important prayer and declaration of faith in all
Jewish life (known as the Shema), and reviews many of the core teachings to
be found in the Torah and Judaism.
Reviewing the Ten Commandments
Moses begins his second discourse to the Children of Israel by demanding
that they listen to him. Moses insists that the people learn what the Torah is
teaching and uses a form of a key Hebrew word, shomor (shoh-more; to guard
or protect). It’s not enough to learn a law and follow it; Jewish tradition urges
Jews to protect the Torah’s laws. How does a person guard a law? By review-
ing it, repeating it, focusing on its meaning, and sometimes by adding addi-
tional customs to make sure that the law is followed.
Moses reminds the Children of Israel that God made a deal with them at Mount
Sinai, where He gave them the Ten Commandments (see Chapter 5). It’s inter-
esting and important to note that at this point in his discourse Moses was
speaking to many people who didn’t actually stand at Mount Sinai but were
born afterward. Nevertheless, Moses says, “Not with our forefathers did God
seal this covenant, but with us — we who are here. All of us who are alive
today” (Deuteronomy 5:3). This verse in the Torah implies and teaches at least
two things:
 There are 600,000 primary souls of the Children of Israel, all of whom
stood at Mount Sinai and heard God. Today, with over 12 million Jews in
the world, the traditional Jewish notion is that the original 600,000 souls
spread out and are within the Jewish people as a whole. The traditional
Jewish belief in reincarnation includes the assumptions that all Jews
throughout history stood at Mount Sinai and that these 600,000 original
souls still “live” within Jews throughout time.
 The Torah was given at Mount Sinai thousands of years ago, yet the
Torah is constantly being given by God to the Jewish people. Every Jew
has the responsibility to symbolically stand at Mount Sinai and reach to
hear God’s teachings.
Here’s a loose translation of the words of Moses as he recounted the Ten
Commandments in his second discourse (Deuteronomy 5:1–18):
 I am the Lord, your God, Who has taken you out of the land of Egypt,
from the house of bondage.
132
Part II: One by One: The Books of the Torah 

 You shall not have any other gods before Me. Do not make images of
other gods, do not bow down to them. I, God, demand that you worship
Me exclusively.
 Do not take the name of the Lord, your God, in vain.
 Safeguard the Sabbath to keep it holy. You can work during the six days
and do all that you must, but the seventh day is the Sabbath to God, so
do not do any work. This prohibition against work also includes your
children, your male and female servants, your animals, and the foreigners
in your gates.
In the version of the Ten Commandments in the book of Exodus, the
fourth commandment says, “Remember the Sabbath” (Exodus 20:8).
Jewish tradition teaches that the Children of Israel heard the words
“safeguard” and “remember” at the same time.
 Honor your father and your mother.
 Do not commit murder.
 Do not commit adultery.
 Do not steal.
 Do not be a false witness against your neighbor.
 Do not desire your neighbor’s wife, house, fields, servants, animals, or
anything that belongs to your neighbor.
Presenting the most important Jewish
statement of faith: The Shema
In the middle of the second discourse, Moses repeats the statement of faith
known as the Shema (sheh-mah; listen or hear). The Shema is a crucial part
of the morning and evening prayer services every day of the year. It can be
recited in any language the reciter can understand. It’s traditional for a
person on his or her deathbed to recite the Shema, and it’s also customary to
recite the first paragraph of the Shema before going to sleep at night.
Here’s the text of the Shema:
Listen, Israel, God is our Lord. God is One.
You shall love the Lord, your God, with all of your heart, with all of your
soul, and with all of your resources.
And these words that I command you today shall be upon your heart. You
shall teach them thoroughly to your children and you shall speak of them
while you sit in your home, while you walk on the way, when you lie down
133
Chapter 8: “Words”: The Book of Deuteronomy

and when you rise up. Bind them as a sign upon your arm and let them be
ornaments between your eyes. And write them on the doorposts of your
house and upon your gates.
Deuteronomy 6:4–9
Often a Jewish person who knows absolutely no Hebrew can still recite the
very first line of the Shema in Hebrew because it’s such a common part of
Jewish life and is heard so often. It’s usually the first prayer taught to children.
This first line, as pronounced in Hebrew, is “sheh-mah yis-row-ale ah-doe-noy
eh-low-hay-new ah-doe-noy eh-khahd.”
Trusting, loving, and remembering God
The Talmud (see Chapter 3) contains a discussion about what the Children of
Israel actually heard when standing at Mount Sinai. Some say they heard the
whole Torah, whereas others say they heard the Ten Commandments. Of the
various opinions recorded, all agree that the Children of Israel heard the first
two of the Ten Commandments. The first is the commandment to know God.
The second is the commandment to know that idolatry is a great temptation.
Throughout the Torah, Moses warns against idolatry in all its forms, and in
his second discourse, Moses repeats this prohibition. In the eighth chapter of
Deuteronomy, Moses presents the teaching against idolatry in the harshest of
terms: “If you ever forget God and follow other gods, worshipping and bowing
to them, I bear witness to you today that you will be totally annihilated”
(Deuteronomy 8:19).
Along with this fierce warning, Moses reviews some basic Jewish beliefs and
commandments related specifically to God:
 Remain in awe of God (Deuteronomy 6:13).
 Don’t follow the gods of other nations (Deuteronomy 6:14).
 Don’t test God (Deuteronomy 6:15).
 Do what is good and upright in God’s eyes (Deuteronomy 6:18).
 Don’t intermarry with other nations (Deuteronomy 7:3).
 God loves you (Deuteronomy 7:8).
 God is the one and only Supreme Being (Deuteronomy 7:9).
 Have confidence in God (Deuteronomy 7:18).
 Don’t be afraid of other nations, even if they’re bigger than Israel,
because God is always with you (Deuteronomy 7:17–21).
 Thank God after each meal for the food He has given to you
(Deuteronomy 8:10).
134
Part II: One by One: The Books of the Torah 

 Don’t forget God, God’s laws, and teachings (Deuteronomy 8:11).
 Don’t be haughty when God gives you what you need (Deuteronomy 8:14).
 All life’s trials and tests are from God (Deuteronomy 8:16).
 Don’t think that what you’ve accomplished is your own doing. God is
involved in everything (Deuteronomy 8:17).
 If you’re prosperous, don’t forget that God made it that way
(Deuteronomy 8:18).
 Don’t be self-righteous and think that you can accomplish anything with
God’s help (Deuteronomy 9:4).
 Be in awe of God, cling to God, and serve God (Deuteronomy 10:20).
 Love God always (Deuteronomy 11:1).
Making the right choices
One of the great paradoxes within the Torah is this question: Do humans
have free will or is everything determined by God? The great Talmudic sage
Rabbi Akiva (see Chapter 15) states the Jewish solution succinctly: “All is
foreseen and free will is given” (Mishnah, Ethics of the Fathers 3:19). On the
one hand, nothing happens without God allowing it to happen. On the other
hand, God gave humans one of the divine aspects: free will.
The Torah urges students to constantly be aware that God is the moving force
behind everything (yes, everything!). At the same time, paradoxically, each
person is to be aware that he’s always facing choices and that the basic trial
of life is to make the right choices. The importance of this challenge — that
you’re always free to choose — appears in a number of places in the Torah;
in his second discourse in the book of Deuteronomy, Moses repeats it: “I
present before you today a blessing and a curse. The blessing: that you listen
to the commandments of God that I command you today. And the curse: if
you do not obey the commandments of God and you stray from the path that
I command you, to follow the gods of others” (Deuteronomy 11:26–28).
Recounting the laws of Judaism
Although the entire book of Deuteronomy is really a last-ditch effort on the
part of Moses to teach the Children of Israel the ways of God, the second
discourse summarizes and reviews several broad areas of Jewish law. (Flip to
Part III for more about these laws.)
135
Chapter 8: “Words”: The Book of Deuteronomy

Dietary laws
The kosher laws are those teachings in the Torah that explain what’s permissible
and forbidden to be eaten by Jews. The details of these laws are found in the
Oral Torah, mainly in the Talmud. These teachings include the following:
 Only fish with fins and scales may be eaten (Deuteronomy 11:10).
 Certain birds may be eaten and others may not (Deuteronomy 11:11–18).
 Animals must be properly slaughtered in order to be fit to eat
(Deuteronomy 11:21).
 Meat and dairy products may not be eaten together (Deuteronomy
11:21).
 The only mammals that can be eaten are those that have split hooves
and chew their cud (Deuteronomy 14:6).
 Consuming pork isn’t permissible under any circumstances
(Deuteronomy 14:8).
Laws of charity
Giving charity, or tzedakah (tseh-dah-kah; justice), is one of the most impor-
tant practices in Jewish life. The Torah requires that one-tenth of one’s income
go to charity, and specific laws in the Torah explain how this is calculated
(Deuteronomy 14:22–23). The important idea is that you have a responsibility
to see to it that people in need have what’s needed to survive.
A variety of other laws
As Moses continues to review the major teachings of the Torah in his second
discourse, he touches upon the following topics, most of which are also dealt
with elsewhere in the Five Books of Moses:
 Lending money (Deuteronomy 15:7–11): Be generous, and don’t charge
interest when lending to family members.
 A justice system (Deuteronomy 16:18–20): Don’t bend justice, don’t take
bribes, always pursue perfect honesty, and don’t give special consideration
to anyone, rich or poor.
 The laws of waging war (Deuteronomy 20:10–18): If you have just built a
new house or have planted a vineyard and not had a first crop yet, or if
you’ve just gotten married, or if you’re terrified of fighting, in all these
cases you’re exempt from military service. The Torah also has detailed
laws about taking captives and the proper ways to treat them.
 Returning lost objects (Deuteronomy 22:1–3): If you find a lost object,
you must make every effort to find the owner and take care of the object
until you locate its owner.
 How to deal with a rebellious child (Deuteronomy 21:18–21): Be strict.
136
Part II: One by One: The Books of the Torah 

 Cross-dressing (Deuteronomy 22:5): Don’t do it.
 Keeping vows (Deuteronomy 23:22–24): If you make a promise using
God’s name, you had better keep your word.
 Divorce (Deuteronomy 24:1–3): Divorce is permissible, and the parties
may remarry others.
 Weights and measures (Deuteronomy 25:13–16): Be accurate.
The full range of topics and teachings in the book of Deuteronomy can be
found in Appendixes B and C, where I list all the positive and negative
commandments in the Five Books of Moses.
A warning against breaking laws
At the end of the second discourse, Moses warns that disobeying the Torah
will result in curses (while obedience results in blessings). Moses stresses
the following sins (Deuteronomy 27:11–28:68):
 Idolatry
 Disrespect to parents
 Moving fixed boundaries
 Misdirecting the blind
 Mistreating orphans, widows, and foreigners
 Sexual misconduct (in particular, sex with one’s father’s wife, with animals,
or with one’s mother-in-law)
 Hurting a neighbor secretly
 Taking a bribe to convict an innocent person
The Final Discourse of Moses
The third and final discourse by Moses (before he says farewell and dies) in the
book of Deuteronomy is most familiar to me because it’s the part of the Torah
that I chanted in public in my synagogue when I was 13 years old and marking
the time of my Bar Mitzvah. Because my birthday is in August, I received a
Torah portion close to that date in the annual cycle of the public reading of the
Torah. (You can find more on the Bar and Bat Mitzvah in Chapter 12 and more
about the annual public reading of the Torah in Chapter 13.) In this section of
the Torah, Moses makes many important statements, including:
 Everyone stands before God at all times (Deuteronomy 29:9).
 The covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob will always exist for all
their descendants — past, present, and future (Deuteronomy 29:11–14).
137
Chapter 8: “Words”: The Book of Deuteronomy

 All Jews stood at Mount Sinai and all Jews must avoid worshiping
anyone but the true God, the God of Israel (Deuteronomy 29:15–17).
 When you make a mistake and repent, God accepts your repentance
(Deuteronomy 30:1–4).
 The Torah isn’t some remote document that’s too difficult to under-
stand. Rather, it’s available to all who want to learn from it
(Deuteronomy 30:11–13).
 All the Children of Israel have free choice (Deuteronomy 30:15–20).
The third discourse wraps up with the final days of Moses, as you see in the
following sections.
God asks Moses for a song
Toward the end of the book of Deuteronomy, God tells Moses that the time is
coming for him to die. God tells Moses to send for Joshua, who will take over
as leader of the people. God then informs Moses that the future will be a
challenge for the Jewish people: “When you go and lie with your ancestors, this
nation shall rise up and stray after alien gods . . . they will abandon Me and
violate the covenant . . . I will hide My face from them” (Deuteronomy 31:16–17).
God knows that there will be many times in history when the Jewish people
will stray from the covenant and will feel as though God has abandoned
them. (I talk more about the covenant in the earlier section “Teaching the
foundation of faith.”)
God instructs Moses to write a song for Him — a song that Moses will sing
before the people and teach to them. The song, known as HaAzinu (ha-ah-
zee-new; listen), is both a warning and a promise.
 The warning tells of how easy it will be for the Children of Israel to stray
from the holy covenant with God.
 The promise speaks of the final redemption, when the Children of Israel
will be faithful to God and the enemies of Israel will crumble.
Moses blesses each tribe for the last time
At the end of the Five Books of Moses, God speaks one final time to Moses,
instructing Moses to climb a mountain and telling him that he will die on that
mountain. God permits Moses to see the Holy Land, but only from afar.
From the mountaintop, Moses looks out on the Children of Israel and blesses
each of the tribes one last time. God says, “This is the land regarding which I
138
Part II: One by One: The Books of the Torah 

made an oath to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, saying ‘I will give it to your
descendants.’ I have let you see it with your own eyes but you will not cross
the river to enter it” (Deuteronomy 34:4).
The death of Moses
The Torah records that Moses was 120 years old when he died and states that
“No man knows the place that he is buried even to today” (Deuteronomy 34:6).
The people mourned him for 30 days. When the mourning period was over,
Joshua took over. The Torah says that “Joshua was filled with a spirit of wisdom
because Moses had laid his hands on him” (Deuteronomy 34:9). The word for
“laid his hands” is of the same root as semichah (she-mee-khah; ordination).
Thus, when a rabbi is ordained, it’s said that he receives semichah.
It’s interesting to note that as important as Moses is to the Jewish people, his
burial place is unknown. Some commentators suggest that the location of
his grave is unknown because his greatness may have inspired people to wor-
ship him. As I say throughout this book, Judaism has no concept of the perfect
person. As great as Moses and the patriarchs were, they were human, with
failings and mortality. Here’s how the burial of Moses is described in the Torah:
“So Moses the servant of God died there in the land of Moab, by the mouth of
God. And He buried him in the valley in the land of Moab, opposite Beth-peor;
but no man knows his burial place to this day” (Deuteronomy 34:5–6).
The Torah ends with the following words: “Never again has a prophet like Moses
arisen in Israel who knew God face to face. Nobody else could reproduce the
signs and miracles that God let Moses display in the land of Egypt, to Pharaoh
and all his land, nor any of the mighty acts or great sights that Moses performed
before the eyes of all Israel” (Deuteronomy 34:10–12).

ore than a book of theological and spiritual 
ideas, the Torah is a plan for action in the world.
Although the Torah does concern itself with sublime and
profound concepts about the meaning of existence, it’s 
far more concerned with human behavior, both between
people as well as between humans and God. In this part, 
I show you how this ancient book is an instruction manual
for healthy, ethical, righteous living, and you come to
understand how simple statements in the Torah are actu-
ally the foundation for huge areas of human life and law.

n Judaism, there are lots of holidays, lots of rituals, and lots of profound
theological concepts. But the heart of Judaism, as taught by the Torah, is a
combination of faith and deeds. The Torah is emphatic about it: Faith without
deeds is bankrupt. It’s never enough to simply believe.
Here’s a story that illustrates this concept: A man who was once a thief went to
my teacher to tell him that he had changed his ways. The former thief admitted
his past failings and announced proudly that he had become a new person. He
had repented in his heart and had found God. My teacher wasn’t terribly
impressed, and the former thief could tell. It wasn’t the response that the
former thief had anticipated, so he asked, “Aren’t you pleased with my new
turn?” My teacher responded, “When you were a thief, didn’t you take lots of
things that belonged to other people?” “Yes,” said the repentant man. “Well,”
said my teacher, “when you find those people and repay them, then you can
come back to me and be so proud of yourself.”
In this chapter, I discuss some of the many ways the Torah speaks to your
personal deeds in this world. By the way, every time you do a good deed, the
sages say that you create a good angel who will be your advocate when your
case arrives at the heavenly court.

Defining the Essence of the Torah
The term “Torah” implies far more than the Five Books of Moses (which I
describe in Part II). It’s also far more than the Holy Scriptures (commonly
referred to as the Bible). And it’s far more than the Oral Torah (generally
known as the Talmud; see Chapter 3). “Torah” includes the vast body of
Jewish teachings throughout the ages and even includes what a Jewish
teacher will teach tomorrow!
Nevertheless, many attempts have been made to define the essence of the
Torah, and the definition best known in Jewish tradition sounds very much
like the Golden Rule — but with a difference. But like the Golden Rule, this
definition in Jewish tradition focuses on a person’s own behavior.
The most frequently quoted attempt to define the Torah comes from a famous
story found in the Talmud. A certain non-believer came before a great teacher
named Shammai and said to him, “I will convert to Judaism on the condition
that you teach me the whole Torah while I stand on one foot.” Shammai impa-
tiently chased him away with the builder’s measuring stick in his hand. When
the same man came before another great teacher named Hillel and asked the
same question, Hillel replied, “What is hateful to you, do not do to your neighbor:
that is the whole Torah while the rest is commentary; go and learn it.”
It’s interesting to note that the famous Golden Rule spoken by Jesus of
Nazareth expresses almost the same notion but in the positive: “Do unto
others what you would have others do unto you” (New Testament, Luke
6:31). Historians point out that Jesus almost surely knew this teaching of 
the great sage, Hillel.
And what, exactly, should be hateful to you so that you don’t do it to others?
You can start to figure out this concept with the help of two popular expres-
sions: One is “God is in the details,” and the other is “the devil is in the details.”
For Judaism and the Torah, it’s surely true that “God is in the details.” As I
explain many times in this book, it’s never enough to look into the Five Books
of Moses to see what Judaism says. A simple verse like “Love thy neighbor as
thyself” prompts many questions: What is “love”? Who is one’s “neighbor”? In
what way does one love oneself? These kinds of questions inspire significant
discussion and detail in Jewish thought. The Torah in its broadest sense is
the result of that ongoing, eternal pursuit for an understanding of what it is
that God wants from His creation.
In light of this pursuit, a basic guiding principle for Jewish life and personal
behavior based on the Torah is to imitate God. Just as God is charitable, so
must people be charitable. Just as God is merciful, so must people be merciful.
This idea is based on a verse in the Torah: “God will establish you to Him as a
holy people as He swore to you, if you guard the commandments of the Lord
your God, and you walk in His ways” (Deuteronomy 28:9).

Be a Mentsch: Some Basic Torah
Principles about Personal Behavior
In Judaism, trying to be a good person — a mentsch — isn’t enough. Jewish
life requires a lifetime of Torah study to continue to learn and to constantly
refine your actions and personal qualities. But there are some basic principles
that guide personal behavior in Judaism; as you may have already figured out,
they’re based on important verses found in the Torah.
Good works
Ma’asim tovim (mah-ah-seem toe-veem; good works) is the general term for
good actions and attitudes. The divine command to be a good person appears
in many forms in the Torah, including:
 “You shall not take revenge, and you shall not bear a grudge for the
people of your nation, and you shall love your fellow man as yourself.”
(Leviticus 19:18)
 “You shall not hate your brother in your heart, and you shall reprove
your friend and not carry a sin because of him.” (Leviticus 19:17)
Acts of kindness
Gemilut chasadim (geh-meh-loot khah-sah-deem; acts of kindness) is the
general Hebrew term for being nice to others. There are many hundreds of
verses in the Torah that obviously reflect this attitude, but the great Torah
sages point out that the proverbial kindness shown to people tends to be
expressed as kindness to “orphans and widows,” as found in the Torah:
“Every widow and orphan you shall not oppress” (Exodus 22:21).
Some guidelines taught by the Torah and the sages regarding acts of kindness
include:
 Speak kindly to people.
 Offer people words of comfort.
 Judge people positively.
 “Love your neighbor as yourself.” (Leviticus 19:18)
 Pursue peace actively.
 Greet people cheerfully.

Chapter 9: Keeping Your Personal Behavior in Line with the Torah

Hospitality
Hachnasat orchim (hakh-nah-saht ore-kheem; inviting guests) is an important
commandment that every Jewish person and family must make every effort
to fulfill. Jewish lore tells of the great patriarch Abraham and his wife Sarah,
and their exceptional reputation for welcoming guests into their home. While
the stories about Abraham and Sarah and their habit of inviting guests has
inspired generations of Jews, the basis of this custom is found in the Torah:
“You shall love the stranger, for you were strangers in the land of Egypt”
(Deuteronomy 10:19). (I go into more detail about treating strangers and
other people fairly later in this chapter; I share the general story of Abraham
and Sarah in Chapter 4.)
The Torah teaches the following details regarding hospitality:
 Seek out guests; don’t just wait for people to show up.
 Make your guests feel wanted.
 Make sure your guests feel comfortable about their need for food, drink,
and washing facilities.
 When guests arrive, give them time to get relaxed and rested after their
journey to see you.
 Make sure your guests don’t feel like they’re an imposition.
 Treat guests royally.
 Tend to your guests’ needs as quickly as possible.
 Teach your children to do this mitzvah.
Charity
The Hebrew word for “charity” is tzedakah (tzeh-dah-kah), which really means
“justice.” The Torah view of charity is that justice is being served when a person
gives charity to someone in need. Many verses in the Torah command that
you give charity, including: “If there will be in your midst a poor person, from
among your brothers, in one of your cities, in your land which the Lord your
God has given you, you shall not harden your heart, or close your hand from
your poor brother” (Deuteronomy 15:7). The Torah also teaches: “For the poor
shall not cease to exist from amidst your land, therefore I have commanded
you, saying, ‘You shall surely open up your hand to your brother, to the poor
and to the destitute in your land’” (Deuteronomy 15:11).
The Torah’s laws regarding charity to the poor also deal with the realities of
an agricultural society and the obligation of farmers to leave some of the
crops for the poor and needy. Here are a couple relevant verses:
146
Part III: The Torah: An Operating Manual for Planet Earth 

 “When you reap the harvest of your land, you shall not reap entirely the
corner of your field, and the gleanings of your harvest you shall not
gather.” (Leviticus 19:9)
 “When you gather your harvest in your field and you forget a bundle in
the field, you shall not return to take it, for the stranger and the orphan
and the widow it shall be in order that the Lord your God shall bless all
the work of your hand. When you beat your olive tree, you shall not
remove its splendor from behind you; for the stranger and the orphan
and the widow it shall be.” (Deuteronomy 24:19–20)
Visiting the sick
The act of visiting the sick is known in Hebrew as bikkur cholim (beer-khoor
khoh-leem). Interestingly, there’s no verse in the Torah that explicitly tells
you to visit the sick. However, the great Torah sages have noticed that God
visits Abraham just after Abraham circumcises himself in the book of Genesis
(see Chapter 4). Based on the principle of “walking in God’s ways” that I
describe in the earlier section “Defining the Essence of the Torah,” just as
God visits Abraham when he’s healing, so should you visit people when
they’re sick or trying to heal.
Evil speech
The Torah disagrees with the last phrase in the adage that “sticks and stones will
break my bones but words will never harm me.” The Torah represents the view
that words can surely harm a person. Jewish thought, as based on the Torah,
recognizes many sins concerning speech. One is lashon hara (lah-shone ha-rah;
evil tongue), which the rabbis define as telling someone something true about
a third party, with the result that the person who hears what was said diminishes
his or her opinion of the person being described (Leviticus 25:17). This is
different from lying, which is its own sin (Exodus 23:7).
Other sins of speech include making a vow and ignoring it, embarrassing
someone in public, telling tall tales — “You shall not be a talebearer amongst
your people” (Leviticus 19:16) — and one of the Ten Commandments, “You
shall not bear false witness” (Exodus 20:16).
Look Sharp! Dressing Appropriately
The Oral Torah explains that one of the ways to understand the word “humble”
in the description of Moses in the Torah as being “exceedingly humble, more
than any man in the world” (Numbers 12:3) is in terms of modesty. The teachings
147
Chapter 9: Keeping Your Personal Behavior in Line with the Torah

of the Torah include principles and concerns about the virtues of behaving
modestly. The Hebrew term for “modesty” is tzniut (tsnee-oot), and it
includes guidelines for appropriate and inappropriate dress.
The Oral Torah teaches that both men and women should dress modestly,
with particular concern about avoiding the exposure of the body publicly in
provocative ways. Jewish practices concerning modesty have always been
flexible and are often influenced by local custom.
Everything Is Relative: The
Torah’s Family Rules
It isn’t surprising that the Torah places great value on the family unit; after all,
the Jewish people as a whole are considered to be a family, as implied by the
phrase “the Children of Israel.” Even though a few million people stood at
Mount Sinai to receive the Torah (as I describe in Chapter 5), the entire group
knew itself to be one large family, with all descended from Jacob, the patriarch.
In a sense, the entire Torah is really the rules and history of one large family, but
within the Torah you find many specific commandments designed to regulate
the individual family unit.
Be fruitful and multiply
The Torah contains 613 commandments (take a look at them in Appendixes B
and C), and the first one found in the first chapter of the first book is the
commandment to have children: “And God blessed them, and God said to
them, ‘Be fruitful and multiply and fill the land and conquer it, and you shall
rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the sky, and all the animals that
move upon the earth’” (Genesis 1:28).
Honor your father and mother
Honoring your father and your mother is known in Hebrew as kibbud av
v’em (kih-bood ahv vah-eem). It’s one of the Ten Commandments, but there
are other verses in the Torah that also concern themselves with how to treat
your parents. They are as follows:
 “Honor your father and your mother in order that your days shall be
lengthened upon this land that the Lord your God has given you.”
(Exodus 20:12)
 “He who smites his father or his mother shall surely be put to death.”
(Exodus 21:15)
148
Part III: The Torah: An Operating Manual for Planet Earth 

 “He who curses his father or his mother shall surely be put to death.”
(Exodus 21:17)
 “A man, his mother and his father shall he fear, and my Sabbaths shall
he guard, I am the Lord your God.” (Leviticus 19:3)
Just married? Take a year off
An unusual set of commandments in the Torah pertains to a newly married
couple. The Torah teaches that a newly married husband shall be free for one
year to rejoice with his wife: “When a man takes a new wife, he shall not enter
military service, nor shall he be charged with any business; he shall be free
for his house one year, and shall cheer his wife whom he has taken”
(Deuteronomy 24:5).
The wife’s rights are just as important
as the husband’s
The Torah protects the rights of wives in many ways. To mention just one
example, Jewish law states that if a husband wants to change careers, his wife
can forbid him to do so if it means that he will be away from home more often
and therefore will not be able to make love as often as the wife would like. The
Torah states, “If he takes a wife, her food, her clothing, and her conjugal rights,
he shall not diminish” (Exodus 21:10).
Steer clear of forbidden relationships
According to the Torah, sexual relations are confined to being between a
husband and wife. It’s forbidden to have sex with another person outside of
the marriage as well as to have sex with an animal. Here are the relevant
verses:
 “And you shall not lie carnally with your neighbor’s wife, to defile yourself
with her” (Leviticus 18:20). Note that although the technical definition of
adultery according to the Torah only pertains to the wife, tradition also
forbids extramarital relations by the husband because, at one time,
polygamy was a common practice.
 “And you shall not lie with any beast to defile yourself with it; neither
shall any woman stand before a beast, to lie down with it; it is perversion.”
(Leviticus 18:23)
149
Chapter 9: Keeping Your Personal Behavior in Line with the Torah

In addition, incest is defined as forbidden sexual relations within a family.
According to the Torah, there are many such forbidden combinations, including
sex with your mother, father, daughter, sister, father’s wife, father’s daughter,
son’s daughter, daughter’s daughter, father’s sister, mother’s sister, father’s
brother’s wife, wife’s daughter, and daughter-in-law. (Did you get all that?)
These prohibited sexual relations and others are detailed in Leviticus 18.
All You Need Is (A Lot More than)
Love: Treating Everyone Fairly
According to Jewish tradition, treating people fairly doesn’t mean to simply
love everyone. The great Torah sages understand life to be far more complex
than that. One of the fundamental principles in Jewish thought and life, and
one of the biggest differences between Christianity and Judaism, is that no
emotion is defined intrinsically as good or bad. Love isn’t always good, and
hate isn’t always bad. Sometimes hate is good (the Torah teaches to hate evil
and to hate evil people, for example) and sometime love is bad (for example,
the Torah says that there’s no sense in loving an enemy who hates you).
Every pharmacist knows that the fine line between a medicine and a poison
has to do with timing and dosage; these rules also apply to love and hate. But
the Torah does teach some important principles that guide you in the general
way to behave toward others, as you find out in the following sections.
One basic principle underlying all Jewish law is the assumption that being
honest is the way to be. One exception in Jewish law, though, is the permissi-
bility of telling a white lie to spare someone pain. For example, when you
walk in to a hospital room to visit a patient, you aren’t supposed to say, “You
look like you’re about to die.” Similarly, when a bride asks you how she looks
in her gown, you don’t say, “It makes you look terrible.” In cases in which the
truth is likely to hurt, a white lie is the way to go.
Be kind and welcoming to strangers
One of the most important Jewish values has to do with being fair, kind, and
welcoming to strangers. The Jewish people know from hard experience that
being a stranger in a strange land can be a difficult and precarious situation.
Jews have been in such a situation countless times, beginning with slavery in
ancient Egypt and continuing through the centuries in exile from the Promised
Land. Several verses in the Torah stress the value of sensitivity to strangers:
 “The stranger you shall not taunt or oppress for you were strangers in
the land of Egypt.” (Exodus 22:20)
 “You shall love the stranger, for you were strangers in the land of Egypt.”
(Deuteronomy 10:19)
150
Part III: The Torah: An Operating Manual for Planet Earth 

The commandment to invite guests and welcome strangers is a topic that
countless sages have discussed throughout history. Jewish tradition identi-
fies the patriarch Abraham as a master of hospitality. The Torah says, “God
appeared to Abraham while he was sitting at the entrance of the tent in the
heat of the day. Abraham lifted his eyes and he saw three strangers standing
near him. When he saw them from the entrance of his tent, he ran to greet
them, bowing down to the ground” (Genesis 18:1–2). The following verses
indicate that Abraham and his wife Sarah did several things. They
 Ran to help them (Genesis 18:2)
 Brought them water (Genesis 18:4)
 Washed their feet (Genesis 18:4)
 Offered them a place to rest (Genesis 18:4)
 Fed them (Genesis 18:5)
 Fed them the finest food (Genesis 18:6–7)
 Attended to them while they ate (Genesis 18:8)
These details found in the verses of the Torah form the basis of the attributes
of a good host. The sages teach that hosts must provide physical comfort to
guests, must feed them as best as they can, and must be alert to their needs.
Don’t just stand there — do something
for someone in need
Several times in the Torah, God commands people not to stand idly by while
someone is in need. The Torah’s answer to the question, “Am I my brother’s
keeper?” is “yes.” In fact, there’s a special commandment concerning your
responsibility to try to correct the ways of others around you: “You shall not
hate your brother in your heart, and you shall reprove your friend and not carry
a sin because of him” (Leviticus 19:17). Other verses in the same spirit include:
 “If you see the donkey of your enemy crouching under its burden, shall
you refrain from helping him? You shall surely help him!” (Exodus 23:5)
 “You shall not be a talebearer amongst your people. You shall not stand
by while your friend’s blood is shed. I am God.” (Leviticus 19:16)
 You shall not see the donkey or the ox of your friend falling along the
road and hide yourself from them. You shall surely stand them up with
him [your friend].” (Deuteronomy 22:4)
151
Chapter 9: Keeping Your Personal Behavior in Line with the Torah

Keep the vows you make
The Torah recognizes the power of words and holds people responsible for
what they say. Within Torah law is the concept of the vow, which is a solemn
promise. One Torah commandment says, “That which has gone out of your
lips you shall observe and do” (Deuteronomy 23:24).
The Hebrew word for “vow” is neder (neh-dehr), and an entire section of the
Oral Torah (see Chapter 3) is called Nedarim (neh-dah-reem; vows). Detailed
laws are explained and explored in Nedarim.
When a person states something and uses God’s name in the statement, the
words spoken are considered a vow. According to the Torah, if you make a
vow and don’t fulfill it, you’re breaking a divine command: “When a man vows
a vow to the Lord . . . he shall not break his word; he shall do according to all
that came out of his mouth” (Numbers 30:3). Keeping a vow made in God’s
name is so important to the Torah that it’s actually mentioned four times.
Here are the other three verses:
 “You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain; for the Lord
will not hold guiltless one who takes His name in vain.” (Exodus 20:7)
 “And you shall not swear by My name falsely, so that you profane the
name of your God: I am the Lord.” (Leviticus 19:12)
 “You shall fear the Lord your God; Him shall you serve; and to Him shall
you cleave, and by His name shall you swear.” (Deuteronomy 10:20)
B’li neder (bih-lee neh-dehr) is a common expression that I’ve heard count-
less times; it’s used by religious Jews when they’ve expressed something but
don’t want it to be considered a solemn vow. For example, if I tell you that I
will call you tonight, I may say, “I will call you tonight b’li neder.” Although I
have every intention of calling you, I also want to cover my back so that I’m
not breaking a vow if I can’t make the call.
Honor and respect your elders
The Torah teaches that you must honor people who are elderly and people
who are wise. The Hebrew word for “honor” is kovod (kah-vode). But the
word “honor,” which is also used to refer to the commandment to honor your
parents (which I discuss earlier in this chapter), doesn’t mean “obey.” As an
adult, you aren’t obligated to obey your parents. For example, if your parents
tell you to do something that’s wrong, you certainly don’t have to do it.
Whether it’s your parents or an elderly person or a wise person, honoring
them means displaying respect and kindness to them according to the Torah.
152
Part III: The Torah: An Operating Manual for Planet Earth 

One of the ways to show honor and respect is to stand up. When an elderly
or wise person enters a room and surely when he or she approaches you, the
Torah urges you to rise out of honor. As the Torah says: “Before an old person
shall you arise, and you shall honor the face of an elder, and you shall fear
your God, for I am the Lord” (Leviticus 19:32).
Showing Kindness to Furry Friends
Several verses in the Torah form the basis of a Torah attitude of being kind to
and preventing the suffering of animals. One well-known aspect of this attitude
among Jews is the absolute necessity to minimize the suffering of an animal
being slaughtered for food. The sharpest knife must be used, and the skill of
the person who does the slaughter must include the ability to be swift and
painless.
It’s also a Jewish law that you feed your animals (including pets, of course)
before you feed yourself. Other Torah verses dealing with kindness to animals
include:
 “And whether it be cow or ewe, you shall not kill it and its young both in
one day.” (Leviticus 22:28)
 “If a bird’s nest happens to be before you in the way, in any tree or on
the ground, with young ones or eggs, and the mother sitting upon the
young, or upon the eggs, you shall not take the mother with the young.”
(Deuteronomy 22:6)
 “You shall not muzzle the ox when he treads the corn.” (Deuteronomy 25:4)
In other words, let the animal eat and enjoy!

I
n Chapter 9, I explain the Torah laws that apply to personal behavior, but
Judaism isn’t just the spiritual path for individuals. The Torah also is
concerned with the community at large — both Jews and those who aren’t
Jewish. As you find out in this chapter, the Torah has lots to say about the
general community, how it functions (especially in business and law), and
how it should behave.
It’s Universal: The Seven Laws
of the Sons of Noah
Some religions give the impression that it’s their way or no way. Either you
believe in their religion or you’re going about your life all wrong. Judaism has 
a different point of view. According to Jewish tradition, the Torah certainly
pertains to everyone, but Jews have a responsibility to the Torah that others
do not. The whole meaning of the concept of the chosen people is 3that God
has chosen the Jewish people to carry extra burdens in this world. If you aren’t
Jewish, Judaism doesn’t require you to change your ways and accept the
Jewish way.
But the Torah is a message to all humankind and does have requirements for
people who aren’t Jewish. These requirements amount to seven universal
laws called the seven laws of the sons of Noah, also called the Noahide (no-uh-
khayd) laws.

According to the Torah, Noah and his wife are the ancestors of all humankind.
The Jewish people originally descend from one branch of Noah’s family —
from Shem, one of his three sons. (The name Shem is the source of the word
“Semite.”) The Noahide laws are required of all the descendants of Noah — in
other words, everyone.
Jewish tradition teaches that both Jews and non-Jews must follow seven
rules in order to be considered righteous. The seven laws expand on two
verses in the Torah: “And God said to Noah and his sons with him saying,
‘And as for Me, I establish My covenant with you and your offspring after
you’” (Genesis 9:8–9); and “remember the covenant between God and every
living being” (Genesis 9:16). The Oral Torah details the seven universal laws,
consisting of six prohibitions and one positive commandment:
 Do not commit the sin of idolatry.
 Do not commit blasphemy.
 Do not murder.
 Do not steal.
 Do not engage in sexual immorality.
 Do not eat from the limb of a living animal.
 Establish courts of justice.
156
Part III: The Torah: An Operating Manual for Planet Earth 
Applying common sense from the Torah
There’s no denying that much of the Torah is
simply common sense. The general principle is
“Be nice and be fair to others.” And an ancillary
principle is this: Take what you have learned
and apply it to life situations.
My oldest daughter, who was raised as a tradi-
tional Jew and follows a traditional Jewish
lifestyle, was once told by a non-traditional Jew,
“It must be easy being Orthodox. The books tell
you what to do and you just do it.” My daughter
explained that the traditional Jewish way is
usually misunderstood. The books can’t possi-
bly anticipate every situation and set of circum-
stances that one experiences in life. It’s actually
quite difficult to be a traditional Jewish person
because you spend a lifetime studying the
Torah, but when you go out and live your life,
you’re basically on your own. You have to take
what you’ve learned, apply common sense, and
try to do what you think is best in light of your
Torah studies.

Doing Better Business
A fundamental principle of Jewish law as found in the Torah regards honesty
in business. The Torah says, “And if you sell anything to your neighbor, or
buy from your neighbor’s hand, you shall not wrong one another” (Leviticus
25:14). The notion of honesty in business, known in Jewish law as ona’ah
(oh-nah-ah; fraud), is examined in great detail in the Talmud. Overcharging or
underpaying, for example, are considered serious infractions. The Torah
teaches several principles about doing better business, and the following
sections help you understand some of those important principles.
Lend money compassionately
In the Torah, God encourages people to lend money to those who need it
(Exodus 22:24). Lending money to someone in need is considered a great and
meritorious act. But the Torah adds something to the subject and strictly
forbids a person to charge interest on a loan to a relative. So if a family member
needs money and you can afford it, you must lend the money and not charge
interest, even if the family member offers to pay it. As the Torah says plain and
simple, “Do not charge interest on a loan to a family member” (Leviticus 25:37).
The Torah also insists that if you loan someone money, you must be compas-
sionate and liberal about the situation. You must not demand that a poor
person who owes you money pay if you know that he or she can’t. The Torah
also warns that you must not pressure the person to pay (Exodus 22:24).
157
Chapter 10: Living by the Word of the Torah in the Community
Exploding a myth about Jews lending money
Jews have often been viewed in a negative light
as moneylenders, and the fact is that there were
periods in history when Jews were frequently
in the business of lending money. Ironically, this
profession was imposed on Jews during a time
when they were forbidden to be landowners or
participate in most professions. In addition,
Jews who were moneylenders were severely
restricted regarding how much interest they
could charge (it was a very small percentage).
So, while others were landowners and thrived
in many kinds of businesses, Jews were
restricted to lending money at a small profit.
They had money but little opportunity to use it to
build a good life. A Jewish moneylender was
actually a very poor person.

Many discussions recorded in the Talmud and many laws in the Code of Jewish
Law concern aspects of paying back a loan. Here are a couple examples:
 Written agreements with witnesses are recommended for loans in which
the two parties agree explicitly to the rate of payback.
 As great as loaning money is, you shouldn’t feel obligated to give a loan
to someone if you have good cause to believe that he or she will squander
the money.
Make sure your scales and 
weights are correct
Years ago, I worked in a store that sold gourmet foods and cheeses. I’ll never
forget the day when another employee showed me how to read the scale. In
fact, the person was teaching me how to cheat people by tipping the scale. I
was taught that it was easy to make difficult customers literally pay for their
obnoxious behavior.
As you can imagine, the Torah objects to this horrible practice (and so do I,
for the record!). The Torah emphatically says, “Just balances, just weights, both
dry measures and liquid measures, shall you have: I am the Lord your God, who
brought you out of the land of Egypt” (Leviticus 19:36). The principle of accurate
scales and weights is so important that it’s considered both a positive and a
negative commandment: On the positive side, the Torah calls for “Just balance
and weights,” and on the negative side, it teaches not to possess inaccurate
measures and weights by saying, “You shall not have in your bag weights of
different inaccurate sizes, a great and a small” (Deuteronomy 25:13).
This is an area of Torah law in which the Talmud demonstrates that the Five
Books of Moses can easily be applied to every era of history and to every
new development. The word in the Written Torah for “just weights” — mean-
ing accurate ones — actually represents the Torah’s requirement for honesty
in every conceivable way that you can measure things.
Treat your employees well
The Torah is concerned with all life, and it’s said that everything is con-
tained in the Torah. This includes something as (seemingly) mundane as 
how employers treat their employees. In fact, the Torah urges employers to
be fair and supportive of the people who work for them and identifies some
specific ways to do so.
158
Part III: The Torah: An Operating Manual for Planet Earth 

Pay wages on time
One of the important aspects of the employer-employee relationship has to do
with when to pay the employee. The Torah is clear: Unless you (the employer)
and your employee have agreed upon some other schedule, you must pay your
employee at the end of each day. This doesn’t mean that you can’t arrange for
weekly payments, as many do. But if that’s the agreement, you must fulfill it
promptly. It’s not permissible to delay payment; as the Torah says, “Thou shall
not oppress your neighbor, or rob him; the wages of a hired servant shall not
stay with you all night until the morning” (Leviticus 19:13).
When Moses repeats the laws of the Torah in the book of Deuteronomy, he
again stresses this point of prompt payment and says, “In the same day you
must give him his pay, the sun shall not go down upon it; for he is poor, and
is counting on it: lest he cry against you to the Lord and it will be a sin for
you” (Deuteronomy 24:15).
Allow a worker to eat what he or she is reaping
A very positive aspect of my work experience in a gourmet food and cheese
store long ago has to do with a fascinating law found in the Torah. The
management of the store permitted employees to eat as much as they wanted
from the store free of charge during the workday. The Torah describes much
the same approach:
 A hired laborer may eat from the produce of the field he or she is working
on (Deuteronomy 23:25–26).
 The hired laborer must not take more than he or she can eat
(Deuteronomy 23:25).
 The hired laborer shall not eat produce that is not being harvested
(Deuteronomy 23:26).

Slavery in the Torah
The Torah explores the subject of slavery in
detail. The Hebrew word for “slave” is eved (eh-
ved), but the Torah’s notion of a slave is quite dif-
ferent than what you may imagine. You may
think of a slave as someone who’s oppressed
and treated cruelly. Such is not the case in the
Torah. A slave was a servant who was obligated
to the person he or she worked for, but the eved
had rights and was carefully protected by the
laws of the Torah. For example, a slave owner is
severely punished if he strikes a slave (Exodus
21:20–21), and the slave must be housed,
clothed, and fed in a most satisfactory way.
Finally, the Torah stipulates that a slave isn’t a
slave forever; after a specified period of time (no
more than seven years), a slave must be freed of
his status. When a slave is released, he must be
given gifts and additional support to help him
become independent. The Torah says, “When
you send him away free you shall not send him
away empty-handed. Adorn him generously from
your flocks, from your threshing floor, and from
your wine cellar. As God has blessed you, so
shall you give him” (Deuteronomy 15:13–14).

Property Rights: What’s Mine is Mine,
What’s Yours Is Yours
An ancient saying found in one of the most popular books of the Oral Torah,
The Ethics of the Sages, describes four categories of attitudes:
 An average person thinks, “What’s mine is mine and what’s yours is yours.”
 A fool thinks, “What’s mine is yours and what’s yours is mine.”
 A righteous person thinks, “What’s yours is yours and what’s mine is
yours.”
 An evil person thinks, “What’s yours is mine and what’s mine is mine.”
Although the way of the righteous person is the spiritual ideal, Jewish law is
satisfied by the position of the average person, with the mindset “What’s mine
is mine and what’s yours is yours.” Certainly you should reach as high as
possible spiritually, but if you can simply be respectful of others and 
their property, the Torah law is satisfied. I share a couple of guidelines
regarding property rights in the following sections.
Don’t be sneaky and change boundaries
One important principle in the Torah concerns itself with boundaries. For
example, if you own a piece of land and the community knows that your land
extends to a large boulder in a field, it would be a transgression of the Torah
for someone to move the boulder in an attempt to cheat you. As the Torah
states, “You shall not remove your neighbor’s landmark” (Deuteronomy 19:14).
Other laws in the Torah dealing with property include:
 Be honest when dealing with the property of others (Leviticus 19:11).
For instance, the Oral Torah includes detailed discussion about buying
and selling, with particular focus on the question of the precise moment
that a transaction and transfer of property takes place.
 Don’t steal the property of others (Leviticus 5:23).
A sacred obligation: Return lost objects
A large section in the Talmud expands on the teaching in the Written Torah
about lost objects. According to Torah law, it’s your responsibility to make
conscientious efforts to locate the owner of a lost object that you’ve found.
160
Part III: The Torah: An Operating Manual for Planet Earth 

The Torah verse on which the whole body of law regarding lost objects is
based is, “You shall not see your brother’s ox or his sheep driven away, and
hide your eyes from them; you shall surely bring them back to your brother”
(Deuteronomy 22:1). The Torah is so serious about this that there’s another
verse teaching that you can’t pretend to overlook a lost object because you
don’t want the responsibility of finding the owner: “And so shall you do with
his donkey; and so shall you do with his garment; and so shall you do with
every lost thing of your brother’s, which he has lost, and you have found; you
may not hide yourself” (Deuteronomy 22:3).
When I lived in Brooklyn and spent most evenings for ten years studying
Torah in a local Beit Midrash (bait mid-rahsh; house of Torah study), I often
saw notices on the bulletin board in the lobby from people who had found lost
objects like pens or books or overcoats. The finders placed announcements
attempting to find the items’ owners. The laws of the Torah were taken very
seriously; to try to find the owner of a lost object was as much a sacred duty
as studying, praying, or observing any other religious laws.
Order in the Court — the Torah Way
As I explain in Chapter 5, the Torah tells of Moses not being able to keep up
with all the disputes between and among the Children of Israel. With many
hundreds of thousands of people wandering in the desert, no one person
could possibly keep up with all the disagreements that arose. That’s why
Moses’s father-in-law Yitro (yit-row; Jethro) suggested that Moses set up a
court system to handle the cases. When Moses gave his farewell speeches to
the Children of Israel (see Chapter 8), he reminded them of the necessity of a
court system and said, “Accept the rulings of every court in Israel and do not
rebel against the orders of the court” (Deuteronomy 17:11). I survey some
important court guidelines in the following sections.
The appointment of judges
In order for a court system to work, it needs the full cooperation of the citi-
zenry. Judges need to be appointed, and respect for the judges must be main-
tained. The Torah instructs the Children of Israel “to appoint judges and
officers in every community of Israel” (Deuteronomy 16:18) and also to make
sure that the judges are qualified. The Torah states that the people must not
appoint as a judge a person who isn’t well-versed in the laws of the Torah
even if he’s expert in other branches of knowledge (Deuteronomy 1:17). In
addition, the Torah instructs the people not to curse a judge (Exodus 22:27).
One reason for this is that a judge and his court are surrogates for God’s judg-
ments, so cursing the judge is blasphemy.
161
Chapter 10: Living by the Word of the Torah in the Community

The rules of testimony
Setting up a court system isn’t a simple task. Rules, regulations, and guiding
principles must be in place for the system to work. The Torah deals with
many aspects of a functioning court system, a primary one being the rules of
testimony. These Torah rules, which sometimes appear in the Written Torah
and sometimes are clearly stated in the Oral Torah, include the following:
 If you have some evidence, you must testify (Leviticus 5:1).
 Be honest in your testimony (Exodus 20:13).
 The court can’t accept the testimony of a close relative, and a parent
can’t be punished for a child’s crime (Deuteronomy 24:16).
 When testimony is heard, all parties involved must be present 
(Exodus 23:1).
 Witnesses must be examined thoroughly (Deuteronomy 13:15).
 One witness isn’t enough (Deuteronomy 19:15).
 No one gets special treatment (including great people or poor people)
(Leviticus 19:15 and Exodus 23:3).
 Beware of bribes (Exodus 23:8).
 Don’t be impressed or intimidated by people in court (Deuteronomy 1:17).
Punishments for wrongdoings
Another aspect of a court and legal system is punishment. When a person is
found guilty of a crime, an appropriate punishment must be ordered. The
Written Torah and the Oral Torah establish a complex and thorough system
for punishment, compensations to victims, and all the many details that go
into constructing an effective and just penal system.
Corporal punishment
The Torah teaches that corporal punishment is sometimes appropriate. For
example, the Torah says, “If a wicked man has incurred the penalty of flogging,
the judge shall make him lean over and have him flogged (whipping or beating)
with a fixed number of lashes for his crime” (Deuteronomy 25:2). The crimes
whose punishment is flogging include idol worship, breaking one’s vow,
perjury, and crimes of sexual immorality.
162
Part III: The Torah: An Operating Manual for Planet Earth 

Theft and price fraud
Someone found guilty of stealing must pay the person back, and in some
cases must pay double or more. For example, the Torah says, “If someone
steals an ox or sheep and then slaughters or sells it, he must repay five oxen
for each ox and four sheep for each sheep” (Exodus 21:37). If the thief can’t
afford to pay, he’s forced by the court to work for the person from whom he
stole. As the Torah states, “A thief must make full restitution. If he is unable
to pay, he is sold as a slave for his crime” (Exodus 22:2).
Another extensive area of Torah law is called ona’ah (oh-nah-ah; fraud, over-
charging, underpaying). As with each area of law, the laws of fraud grow out
of a verse in the Torah: “When you buy or sell to your neighbor, do not wrong
one another” (Leviticus 25:14). In cases of fraud and all other monetary
crimes, the Oral Torah teaches how to evaluate the extent of the crime and
what the restitution should be.
Bodily injury and monetary compensation
As I explain in Chapter 18, the verse in the Torah that states “an eye for an
eye, a tooth for a tooth” is one of the most misquoted and misunderstood
passages in the Torah. It’s absolutely forbidden to understand this verse-
literally, meaning that you may never take physical revenge on a person who
has injured you physically.
In the book of Exodus, the true Torah attitude is revealed that a person who
inflicts a bodily injury shall pay monetary compensation to the victim: “And if
men argue, and one strikes the other with a stone, or with his fist, and he
does not die, but is confined to his bed; if he rise again, and walk abroad with
his staff, then he that struck him shall be quit, only he must pay for the loss
of time, and shall cause him to be thoroughly healed” (Exodus 21:18–19).
Capital punishment
The Torah describes four types of capital punishment (the Oral Torah connects
these methods with the Torah verses that I indicate):
 Decapitation with the sword (Exodus 21:20 and Leviticus 26:25)
 Strangulation (Leviticus 20:10)
 Burning with fire (Leviticus 20:14)
 Stoning (Deuteronomy 22:24)
163
Chapter 10: Living by the Word of the Torah in the Community

It’s extremely important to recognize that in the annals of Jewish history, when
the Jewish system of courts was functioning, there was almost never a case for
which capital punishment was actually used. Although capital punishment is
certainly a part of Torah law, it’s extremely difficult to fulfill all the essential
requirements needed to enact such punishment. For example, it’s almost
impossible for two witnesses to see the capital crime and the murderer to have
been clearly warned of the implications of his deed before he did it. The
system is constructed so that the punishment is on the books as a deterrent
and as a way to express the severity of the illegal acts. But in actuality, capital
punishment is rarely used.
Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya states in the Talmud: “More than one person exe-
cuted in 70 years would be called a murderous court.” Rabbi Tarfon and
Rabbi Akiva state: “If we had been members of the Supreme Court, no defen-
dant would ever have been executed.”

The Importance 
of the Torah in
Judaism

In this part . . .
T
he Jewish People are called “the people of the book,”
and that book is the Torah. There are many important
books in Jewish life, but the Torah is the most important
book in all of Judaism. It contains basic instructions for
Jewish holy days and Jewish religious practice and serves
as the central focus of the synagogue Sabbath service. In
this part, I explain how the Torah impacts all of Jewish
life, ultimately focusing on the study of the Torah, a daily
practice among all traditional Jews. You ﬁnd out why the
study of the Torah is so crucial for Jews and how to take
the necessary steps to engage in Torah study yourself
(whether or not you’re Jewish).

Observing the Holy Days
in Torah Time
In This Chapter

 Brushing up on the Jewish holy days established in the Torah
I
n case you hadn’t noticed, Jews have lots of holy days. They aren’t 
holidays — they’re holy days. Whereas a holiday is a day off, a Jewish 
holy day is a day devoted to prayer, study, meditation, celebration, rituals,
and family gatherings. All the activities of Jewish holy days are ultimately
about God and the teachings of the Torah. As you find out in this chapter,
Jews see special holy days that are placed on the calendar by God and taught
in the Torah as ways to elevate oneself spiritually.
Time in general is an important category of thought in Jewish tradition. Time
has its own unique ability to provide people with opportunities to connect
with God and receive divine awareness and delight. In this chapter, I explain
the ways the Torah and Judaism look at different units of time.
Breaking Down Time 
According to the Torah
The Jewish sages teach that holiness — connection to and awareness of God —
is possible to attain through vehicles of time. The day, the week, the month,
the year, and multiyear cycles of time each have a special ability to connect
people with God and raise their consciousness.

The day: “It was evening and 
it was morning, one day”
The very first verses in the Torah, found in the book of Genesis (see Chapter 4),
contain a precise description of the events leading up to the creation of the first
Day and the first Night.
These five verses have been the object of Jewish meditation for millennia.
Each verse is full of meaning and secrets, some that have been uncovered
and others that remain to be discovered by some scholar of the future.
God creates the heaven and the earth
The first verse of the Torah, “In the beginning when God created the heaven
and the earth” (Genesis 1:1), is understood by one of my teachers to mean that
in Jewish tradition a person’s spiritual work includes the struggle to grasp
the paradox that God created existence and therefore existed before existence.
God is beyond all time, space, or any concepts you can possibly think of (refer
to Chapter 2 where I explore the Torah’s view of God in more detail).
God hovers over the earth when the world is still formless and void
The second verse of the Torah is, “The earth was without form and empty, with
darkness on the face of the deep and God’s spirit moved on the surface of the
waters” (Genesis 1:2). This verse contains a profound mystery of the Torah
that only the greatest of scholars have pierced over the centuries: The phrase
tohu v’vohu (toe-who v’voh-who), which is often translated as “darkness on the
face of the deep,” is the subject of contemplation particularly among Kabbalists
(see my book Kabbalah For Dummies, published by Wiley, in which I describe
the Kabbalistic teachings on the Torah). Much of the scholarly discussion
focuses on what the terms literally mean. Some say that the terms can be
translated as “formless and void.” The very words “tohu v’vohu” rhyme, similar
to a phrase like “topsy-turvy.”
The image of a world that’s formless and void is impossible to picture. As one
great Torah teacher writes, existence is based on “divine non-being,” which is
also quite a challenge to grasp. Modern cosmologists also play with ideas like
non-being as the basis for all creation.
God creates light
The third verse of the Torah states that “God said ‘Let there be Light,’ and
there was Light” (Genesis 1:3). The Light that was created, called Ohr (oar),
isn’t the same as the light that we know, which comes from the rays of the sun,
our local star. But neither the stars nor the sun (nor the moon) were created
until the fourth day, according to the Torah. So what’s going on? Jewish tradition
considers what’s sometimes called “the primordial light” to be the divine
emanation that forms the basis of creation. In short, God didn’t create the
world out of nothing; rather, creation is a contracted and sculpted emanation
of Light from God (see Chapter 2 for more details).
168
Part IV: The Importance of the Torah in Judaism 

God divides light and darkness
The fourth verse of the Torah introduces the concept of the “day” as being a
cycle of light and darkness: “God saw that the light was good, and God divided
between the light and the darkness” (Genesis 1:4). The rhythm of the two,
which corresponds to the rhythm of each day of your life, is the framework
for much of Jewish life. A person has certain responsibilities every day in
Jewish life, and the Torah fixes that rhythm as an eternal pattern of time.
God puts evening before morning
The fifth verse contains the statement, “And there was evening and there was
morning, one day” (Genesis 1:5). This biblical phrase, putting “evening” first,
is the basis of the fact that Jewish holy days begin at sundown. A Jewish “day”
begins in the evening, which is why Shabbat begins at sundown on Friday night
and ends the following sundown, Saturday night. (I discuss Shabbat in more
detail later in this chapter.)
Each day contains three prayer sessions (see Chapter 2 for details):
 Ma’ariv (mah-ah-reeve; evening)
 Shacharit (shah-khah-reet; morning)
 Mincha (min-khah; afternoon)
The Torah also teaches that the famous prayer, the Shema (you can read it in
Chapter 2), is to be said every evening and every morning. The prayer
commands people to speak of God “when you lie down and when you rise
up.” The order reflects the fact that the Jewish day begins at night.
The week: Torah time is a 
spiral, not a straight line
The round nature of the week in Jewish life is based on the story of creation
found in the entire first chapter of the book of Genesis. According to the Torah,
God creates the world in six days. After the sixth day comes Shabbat, which isn’t
even considered a day in Jewish life; it’s more of a unique category, an oasis in
time, with special activities, restrictions, customs, and goals.
The Sabbath, called Shabbat (shah-baht), is essentially a day of rest. God
creates the world in six days and rests on the seventh, and the Torah instructs
the Jewish people to do the same. The cyclical nature of the Jewish week
creates a spiral so that the week always returns to Shabbat. One of my Torah
teachers suggests that the passing weeks should be seen as a spiral or helix
rising. The weeks go around and around, returning to the same place but
hopefully with participants who are spiritually elevated and who feel closer
to God with each new cycle.
169
Chapter 11: Observing the Holy Days in Torah Time

The Torah laws of Shabbat are complex and lengthy, as I explain in the later
section “Shabbat: Observing the Holiest of Holy Days.” But all these laws are
ultimately part of a design for a day of peace, rest, prayer, tranquility, and
delight every week.
The month: When the moon hits your eye
The concept of the month in the Torah is based on the cycle of the moon.
The moon looks like it changes and grows each month, going from a narrow
crescent to a full moon and then back to a reversed narrow crescent. In the
book of Genesis, God creates the moon on the fourth day, but the significance
of the moon in the marking of months appears much later. In Exodus 12:1–2,
the Torah refers to the establishment of the Jewish calendar and the counting
of months by the cycle of the moon.
On Shabbat before the new moon each month, the new Hebrew month is
announced during the weekly synagogue Shabbat service. There are also
some additional prayers added to the synagogue service as well as special
readings from the Torah on the occasion of the beginning of the new month.
The day beginning the new month is called Rosh Chodesh (rowsh khowe-
desh; the head of the month).
Here’s the order of the Hebrew months and their equivalents in the solar
calendar:
 Tishre (September/October)
 Heshvan (October/November)
 Kislev (November/December)
 Tevet (December/January)
 Shevat (January/February)
 Adar (February/March)
 Adar II (the leap month)
 Nisan (March/April)
 Iyar (April/May)
 Sivan (May/June)
 Tammuz (June/July)
 Av (July/August)
 Elul (August/September)
Each month has to have full days, not fractions of days, so each Hebrew month
has either 29 or 30 days in it, adding up to 354 days in the year. This is 11 days
less than a solar calendar with 365 days in a year. To balance things out so that
170
Part IV: The Importance of the Torah in Judaism 

Jewish holy days stay in the same season instead of move around the calendar,
the Jewish calendar has a leap month called Adar II. It’s added to the calendar
seven times every 19 years.
Why is all this important? Because holy days described in the Torah can be
scheduled properly only by establishing each new month. For instance:
 Rosh Hashanah is observed on the first day of Tishre. It’s the day when
the creation of the world was completed (Leviticus 23:24).
 Yom Kippur is observed on the tenth day of Tishre (Leviticus 23:26).
 Sukkot is in Tishre, from the 15th to the 21st (Leviticus 23:34).
 Passover is observed from the 15th to the 21st of Nisan (Leviticus 23:6).
The year: When holy days abound
According to the Torah, the Jewish year begins on the first day of the month
Tishre, the anniversary of God’s completion of the creation of the world. In
Jewish time, the years go around and around with the celebration of the New
Year being not only the start of the year but also the anniversary of existence
itself. The Jewish New Year, Rosh Hashanah (which I cover later in this chapter),
is a sacred occasion.
During the year, the Jewish calendar is filled with holy days that are all about
God and the Torah’s teachings. In addition to Shabbat (celebrated weekly),
Rosh Chodesh (celebrated monthly), and the holy days that I discuss later in
this chapter, holy days include those in Table 11-1.

The seven-year cycle: Giving the
land and debtors a break
The Torah describes cycles of seven years as having great significance. The
seven-year cycle, mentioned several times in the Torah, is called sh’mita
(sheh-mee-tah). There are two main parts of sh’mita:
 After six years, farmed land is given a year of rest.
 After seven years, debts among the Children of Israel are canceled out.
Here are a few of the verses that teach about the sh’mita year:
It is permitted for six years to plant your land and gather crops. But during
the seventh year, you must leave it alone and withdraw from it.
Exodus 23:10–11
God spoke to Moses at Mount Sinai and told him to speak to the Children of
Israel and say to them: When you come to the land that I am giving you, the
land must be given a Sabbath rest for God. For six years you may plant your
fields and prune your vineyards and harvest your crops, but the seventh year
is a Sabbath of Sabbaths for the land.
Leviticus 25:1–4
At the end of every seven years you shall institute the remission year. Here
is the point: every creditor shall remit any debt owed by his neighbor and
brother when God’s remission year comes around.
Deuteronomy 15:1–2
172
Part IV: The Importance of the Torah in Judaism 

The basic idea of sh’mita is still alive and well among the Jewish people:
 Many religious Jews in Israel allow their farming land to rest for a year.
 It’s considered an act of great merit to offer a free loan to someone in need.
The 50-year cycle: When all 
land belongs to God
In ancient times, the Children of Israel observed the Yovel (yoh-vail; jubilee) in
accordance with this Torah verse: “You shall count for yourself seven cycles
of Sabbatical years, seven years seven times . . . it shall be the Jubilee year
for you . . . You shall not harvest, you shall not sow” (Leviticus 25:8–12).
The details of the Jubilee are complex and haven’t been observed for centuries,
but the basic, profound idea behind the concept of the Jubilee year is the
assumption that land ultimately belongs to God.
Shabbat: Observing the 
Holiest of Holy Days
There’s an old saying among Jews that more than Jews keep Shabbat,
Shabbat has kept the Jews. Shabbat is the most important Jewish holy day
(contrary to popular belief, it’s not Yom Kippur) and is so holy that it isn’t even
considered a real day among the Torah sages but rather is a special creation by
God as a gift to His children. Shabbat is a day of liberation, when Jews are free
from the routine of the workweek. Keeping Shabbat is even one of the Ten
Commandments (see Chapter 17); passages about it appear in both the book of
Exodus and the book of Deuteronomy.
In the following sections, I explain the basic rules of observing Shabbat
according to the Torah, including forbidden activities.
The Torah’s basic Shabbat instructions
Shabbat is like a dance in that it has certain steps to follow. Looking at any
one moment of a dance doesn’t reveal much about the dance as a whole. You
have to watch an entire dance performance to appreciate its wholeness. The
same is true of Shabbat. When you participate in it from the inside, and par-
ticipate fully, you’re able to grasp the holiness of Shabbat.
173
Chapter 11: Observing the Holy Days in Torah Time

The laws of Shabbat are complex and numerous, but they all grow out of
verses in the Written Torah that the great Torah sages and Talmudic scholars
have supplemented with the Oral Torah. The basics consist of the following
commandments and their corresponding verses in the Torah:
 Stay close to home on Shabbat.
“Let no man go out of his place on the seventh day.” (Exodus 16:29)
 Make Shabbat a special day.
“Remember the Shabbat day, to keep it holy.” (Exodus 20:8)
 Don’t “work” on Shabbat. (See the later section “The 39 things you
can’t do on Shabbat” for specifics.)
“But the seventh day is Shabbat for the Lord your God, in it you shall not
do any manner of work: You, nor your son, nor your daughter, nor your
male servant, nor your maidservant, nor your cattle, nor the stranger
that is within your gates.” (Exodus 20:9)
 Rest on Shabbat.
“Six days shall you do your work, but on the seventh day you shall rest;
that your ox and your donkey may have rest, and the son of your handmaid,
and the stranger, may be refreshed.” (Exodus 23:12)
“Six days shall you work, but on the seventh day you shall rest; in plowing
time and in harvest you shall rest.” (Exodus 34:21)
The activities within the Tabernacle were altered on Shabbat, and parallel or
similar alterations in the liturgy on Shabbat can be seen in synagogue services
today. For example:
 Offer up an additional sacrifice every Shabbat (two lambs). Today, this
is represented in the Shabbat synagogue service by the addition of a rel-
atively brief service called mussaf (moo-sahf; addition) at the end of the
morning service.
“And on the Shabbat day, two male lambs in their first year without
blemish, and two tenth parts of an ephah of fine flour for a meal-offering,
mingled with oil, and the drink-offering with it.” (Numbers 28:9)
 Set the showbread (12 loaves representing the tribes of Israel) and the
frankincense before God every Shabbat. Every Shabbat table includes
at least two loaves of challah (bread). Some Shabbat tables include 12
loaves to reflect the ancient practice.
“And you shall set upon the table showbread before Me always.”
(Exodus 25:30)
174
Part IV: The Importance of the Torah in Judaism 

The start of Shabbat
Shabbat begins at sundown on Friday evening. Just before the sun sets, Shabbat
candles are lit in Jewish homes. Traditionally, Jewish families gather for a
festive meal on Friday night to usher in Shabbat. The meal includes the
singing of sacred songs, blessing the children of the household, reciting a
special prayer over a cup of wine in honor of Shabbat, and then partaking in
the festive meal, which always begins with ritual hand washing and a special
blessing before Shabbat challah loaves are eaten. The Written and Oral
Torahs provide the basis of Shabbat customs and rituals. They include the
following:
1. Candle lighting.
Traditionally, the woman of the household lights at least two candles,
one for each of the two important references to Shabbat in the Torah:
“Remember Shabbat” (Exodus 20:8) and “Observe Shabbat”
(Deuteronomy 5:12).
2. Blessing the children of the household (see Figure 11-1).
This custom is based on a verse in the Torah describing how Jacob
blessed his grandsons Ephraim and Menashe (Genesis 48:20).
Figure 11-1:

175
Chapter 11: Observing the Holy Days in Torah Time

3. Reciting the blessing over a cup of wine.
The Oral Torah explains that the way to fulfill the Torah’s command to
“remember” Shabbat is by reciting the special prayer called the Kiddush
(kih-doosh; sanctification) over wine. Figure 11-2 shows a Kiddush cup.
4. Washing hands before reciting the blessing to eat bread.
Although it’s not explicitly in the Written Torah, the oral tradition bases
this custom on two verses: one from the Written Torah (Leviticus 15:11)
and the other from Psalms 26:6. Each verse refers to rinsing hands for
purification purposes (Figure 11-3 shows a cup used for rinsing hands).

Part IV: The Importance of the Torah in Judaism 

Two loaves of challah are used on Shabbat to commemorate the two
portions of manna that God provided the Children of Israel before
Shabbat each week when they were in the wilderness. You can see a loaf
of challah in Figure 11-4.
The 39 things you can’t do on Shabbat
With regard to Shabbat, one verse in the Torah states, “For six days you may
perform melachah, but the seventh day is a day of complete rest, holy to the
Lord” (Exodus 31:15).
The great rabbis and sages of Jewish tradition explain that the word melachah
(meh-lah-khah; work) actually means far more than work. The oral tradition
teaches that melachah consists of 39 categories of work that correspond to 39
activities, most relating to the building of Tabernacle, that appear in the Torah
(see Chapter 5 for more on the Tabernacle). They can be better understood
as four general categories (which I cover in the following sections), all related
to the physical activities performed by the Children of Israel as they wandered
in the desert.
The following 39 activities are actually terms that represent more than their
literal meaning. Jewish tradition teaches that each of these 39 categories of
work have what’s known as toledot (toll-dote; offspring). For example, the
fifth melachah, threshing, means any extraction of something from something
else. In other words, squeezing a lemon for its juice isn’t permitted on
Shabbat because it falls into the category of threshing.

177
Chapter 11: Observing the Holy Days in Torah Time

Baking bread
The first category consists of activities that were part of the process of
baking bread. The book of Exodus describes how the Children of Israel didn’t
gather manna (food sent from heaven) on Shabbat but instead gathered two
portions of manna on the day before Shabbat (see Chapter 5). The prepara-
tion of food is forbidden on Shabbat, so the food for Shabbat is prepared in
advance. The following activities are necessary for making the basic food —
bread — and so they’re forbidden on Shabbat:
 Zoreah (sowing)
 Choresh (plowing)
 Kotzair (reaping)
 M’amair (gathering)
 Dush (threshing)
 Zoreh (winnowing)
 Borer (sorting)
 Tochain (grinding)
 Miraked (sifting)
 Lush (kneading)
 Ofeh; Bishul (baking; cooking)
Creating clothing
The second category is based on the fact that in the Tabernacle the Priests
wore special clothing described in detail in the book of Exodus. The materials
in these beautiful garments were created by the following activities, which
are forbidden on Shabbat:
 Gozez (shearing)
 Melabain (whitening)
 Menafetz (disentangling; combing)
 Tzovayah (dyeing)
 Toveh (spinning)
 Maisach (mounting the warp)
 Oseh Beit Batai Neirin (preparing to weave)
 Oraig (weaving)
 Potzai’ah (separating threads)
 Koshair (tying a knot)
178
Part IV: The Importance of the Torah in Judaism 

 Matir (untying a knot)
 Tofair (sewing)
 Ko’reah (tearing)
Making leather and parchment
The third category relates to the creation of leather, an essential part of the
physical Tabernacle in that it was used for the roof of the structure, as well as
to the creation of parchment for writing. As a verse in Exodus says, “Make a
roof for the tent out of reddened rams’ skin. Above it, make a roof out of the
blue processed hides” (Exodus 26:14). These materials require the following
activities that are forbidden on Shabbat:
 Tzud (trapping)
 Shochet (slaughtering)
 Mafshit (skinning)
 M’abaid (salting; tanning process)
 Mesharteit (tracing or scratching lines)
 Memacheik (smoothing; scraping)
 Mechateich (cutting to shape)
General types of work
The last category includes writing as well as various general kinds of labor.
There are no explicit references to these activities in the Written Torah, but the
Oral Torah, specifically the section of the Mishnah called Shabbat, lists these
prohibited activities as well as all 39 categories considered “work” on Shabbat:
 Kotaiv (writing two or more letters)
 Mochaik (erasing two or more letters)
 Boneh (building)
 Soiser (demolishing)
 Mechabeh (extinguishing a flame)
 Ma’avir (kindling)
 Makeh B’Patish (completing; putting on finishing touches)
 Hotza’ah (transferring from domain to domain)
179
Chapter 11: Observing the Holy Days in Torah Time

The end of Shabbat
There are no specific instructions in the Torah for the conclusion of Shabbat,
but over the centuries a brief ritual developed called havdalah (hahv-dah-lah;
separation). The ritual, usually performed at home, includes the recitation of
verses from the Torah and other sacred Jewish writings as well as lighting a
decorative candle, saying a blessing over a cup of wine, and smelling sweet
spices.
Celebrating Holy Days 
Appearing in the Torah
Earlier in this chapter, I describe the way the Torah looks at various units of
time: those that are seemingly natural, like the day, the month, and the year;
and those more-human inventions, like the week, the cycle of seven years,
and the cycle of 50 years. The Torah considers all these cycles of time to be
“natural” and woven into the fabric of God’s universe.
The Jewish holy days that appear in the Torah also are considered to be
embedded within the rhythm of time itself; I discuss these holy days, in order
of their appearance on the Jewish calendar, in the following sections. In the
view of the Torah, each holy day, even those that seem to simply commemo-
rate historical events, is a part of the creation itself.
The Jewish concept of time isn’t linear and, as such, isn’t so easy to grasp. As
my teacher explains, time is more like a spiral or a helix rising up from
Creation. There’s always a certain return to the past; the past is never a con-
dition that has gone by and is no more. Each year, Creation returns in a sense
to the same place. Each holy day is considered to be a part of the pattern of
time and is built into Creation itself.
It may surprise you to know that the holy days of Chanukah and Purim don’t
appear in the Torah. Both days commemorate historical events that occurred
after the Torah was given to Moses at Mount Sinai.
Rosh Hashanah: Happy birthday, 
dear universe
The Jewish New Year celebration, Rosh Hashanah (rowsh hah-shah-nah;
head of the year), is the anniversary of the creation of the universe and
begins a period of ten days of profound introspection and prayer. Jews 
180
Part IV: The Importance of the Torah in Judaism 

celebrate it on the first day of the month of Tishre (I discuss the months of
the Jewish year earlier in this chapter). The Torah instructs several things
about the observance of Rosh Hashanah that form the basis of Rosh
Hashanah practice today.
There are a few different “new years” in Judaism, so although Rosh Hashanah
is in the month of Tishre, which is sometimes seen as the first month of the
year, you should note that the Torah says that Rosh Hashanah is in the seventh
month. This may seem strange to you, but in modern life in the United States
there are also a few different “beginnings” of the year. There’s January 1st,
which is the beginning of the calendar year. There’s September, which is the
beginning of the school year for most students. There’s also a fiscal year,
which varies from company to company. The Jewish calendar year actually
begins with the Hebrew month of Nisan.
It’s a day of rest
Like Shabbat (also known as the Sabbath, which I cover earlier in this chapter),
there are many laws and customs on Rosh Hashanah that help to create an
atmosphere contrary to the hustle and bustle of ordinary days. One of the
primary laws stresses that the holy day is a day of rest. (Keep reading to find
out some of these laws and customs.)
Speak to the children of Israel, saying, “In the seventh month, in the first day
of the month, shall be a solemn rest for you, a memorial proclaimed with
the blast of horns, a holy convocation.”
Leviticus 23:24
You can’t work, but you can make food
Jewish law requires that almost all the restrictions appropriate for Shabbat also
pertain to Rosh Hashanah. One of the exceptions allows for food preparation on
this holy day.
You shall do no manner of work, and you shall bring a fire offering to the Lord.
Leviticus 23:25
Hear the sound of the shofar
The shofar (show-far; ram’s horn) is blown in the synagogue on Rosh
Hashanah, and a highlight of the day is hearing its blasts.
And in the seventh month, on the first day of the month, you shall have a
holy convocation: you shall do no manner of work; it is a day of blowing the
horn for you.
Numbers 29:1
181
Chapter 11: Observing the Holy Days in Torah Time

Offer an additional sacrifice
Although the Temple is no longer standing, the synagogue service reflects 
the Torah’s injunction for an additional sacrifice. The Rosh Hashanah liturgy
includes an additional part of the prayer service that substitutes for the
additional sacrifice. Today, there are no sacrifices at all because the Holy
Temple is not standing. Instead, prayers are offered.
And in the seventh month, the first day of the month shall be called holy for
you . . . And you shall prepare a burnt-offering for a pleasant offering for the
Lord.
Numbers 29:2–4
Yom Kippur: The day of at-one-ment
The climax of ten days of introspection, soul-searching, and prayer that begins
on Rosh Hashanah (during the month of Tishre) is Yom Kippur (yohm kee-poor).
It’s a day of prayer and fasting and ultimately merging with God. The Torah
teaches the following directives about Yom Kippur.
Observe the services appointed for the day
There are a number of special rituals performed on Yom Kippur, such as the
eating of a festive meal before the holy day begins and the recital of the Kol
Nidre (kohl nihd-ray; all vows) prayer, which is the first part of the synagogue
service as the holy day begins. In this service, the individual asks God for
forgiveness in the event that a vow made to oneself is not fulfilled.
“Aaron shall come into the holy place, with a young bull for a sin-offering,
and a ram for a burnt-offering . . . And this shall be an everlasting statute for
you, to make atonement for the children of Israel because of all their sins,
once in the year.” And he did as the Lord commanded Moses.
Leviticus 16:3–34
Observe a fast
For over 24 hours, Jews don’t eat or drink on Yom Kippur as a symbol of the
injunction in the Torah to “afflict your soul” on this holy day.
However, on the tenth day of this seventh month is the day of atonement;
there shall be a holy convocation for you, and you shall afflict your souls;
and you shall bring a fire offering to the Lord.
Leviticus 23:27
182
Part IV: The Importance of the Torah in Judaism 

For whatever soul it be that shall not be afflicted on that same day, he shall
be cut off from his people.
Leviticus 23:29
Rest and do no work
Yom Kippur is sometimes referred to as the Sabbath of Sabbaths. Like
Shabbat (which I discuss earlier in this chapter), no work is done on this day.
You shall do no manner of work; it is a statute forever throughout your
generations in all your dwellings.
Leviticus 23:31
It shall be to you a Sabbath of solemn rest, and you shall afflict your souls;
on the ninth day of the month at evening, from evening to evening, you shall
keep your Sabbath.
Leviticus 23:32
Offer an additional sacrifice
Because the Temple isn’t standing in Jerusalem, the Yom Kippur liturgy includes
an additional part of the prayer service that substitutes for the additional
sacrifice. There are no sacrifices at all today because the Holy Temple is not
standing. Instead, prayers are offered.
And the tenth day of the seventh month shall be called holy for you, and you
shall present a burnt-offering to the Lord for a pleasant offering: one young
bull, one ram, seven male lambs in their first year; they shall be for you
without blemish.
Numbers 29:7–8
Sukkot: Recreating the exodus from Egypt
Sukkot (sue-kote; booths or huts) is a festival lasting several days in the fall
(in the month of Tishre). Jewish families around the world build temporary
dwellings reminiscent of the living conditions of the Children of Israel as they
wandered in the desert before reaching the Promised Land. You can see a
sukkah in Figure 11-5. The following sections point out the commandments in
the Torah about Sukkot.
183
Chapter 11: Observing the Holy Days in Torah Time

Celebrate three special festivals
The Torah singles out the three holy days of Passover, Shavuot, and Sukkot
as special festivals to celebrate.
Three times during the year you shall celebrate a feast for Me.
Exodus 23:14
Rest and do no work on the first day of Sukkot
The Torah defines Sukkot as a seven-day holiday. The first of the seven days
has a special status and is treated like Shabbat (except regarding food; on
Shabbat, there are special restrictions about preparing food that don’t apply
on other holy days). The remaining days are still part of the holiday of
Sukkot, and the customs and rituals apply to all the days.
On the first day shall be a holy convocation; you shall do no manner of work.
Leviticus 23:35
Figure 11-5:

184
Part IV: The Importance of the Torah in Judaism 

Rest and do no work on the day after Sukkot
The day after Sukkot is called Shemini Atzeret (sheh-mee-nee ah-tzehr-et; the
eighth day of assembly). Although it’s often thought to be the last day of
Sukkot, the Torah defines it as a holy day in itself. In Israel, it’s also called
Simchat Torah (sim-kaht toe-rah). Outside of Israel, Simchat Torah is the day
after Shemini Atzeret.
Seven days you shall bring a fire offering to the Lord; the eighth day shall be
called holy to you; and you shall bring a fire offering to the Lord; it is a day
of solemn assembly; you shall do no manner of work.
Leviticus 23:36
Shake four different plants
Each day between the first and eighth days of Sukkot, four species of plants —
a date palm, the bough of a myrtle tree, a willow branch, and a lemon-like
citrus fruit called an etrog (eht-rohg) — are taken together. They’re shaken in
six directions — north, east, south, west, up, and down — as an expression of
the belief and faith that God is everywhere.
And you shall take for you on the first day the fruit of goodly trees, branches
of palm-trees, and boughs of thick trees, and willows of the brook, and you
shall rejoice before the Lord your God seven days.
Leviticus 23:40
Dwell in booths for seven days
Traditional Jews build temporary huts for Sukkot and at minimum eat meals
in the hut during the festival. Some people sleep in them, too.
You shall dwell in booths for seven days; every native in Israel shall dwell in
booths.
Leviticus 23:42
Offer an additional sacrifice
As I explain in regard to other holy days, the additional sacrifices that the
Torah requires aren’t offered today because there’s no Holy Temple. Instead,
an additional prayer service is placed at the end of the usual morning service.
And you shall present a burnt-offering, an offering made by fire, as a
pleasant offering for the Lord: thirteen young bulls, two rams, fourteen male
lambs in their first year; they shall be without a blemish.
Numbers 29:12–34
185
Chapter 11: Observing the Holy Days in Torah Time

Rejoice during Sukkot
A key part of the observance of Sukkot is experiencing the feeling of joy. In
fact, the holy days of Sukkot are also referred to as ziman simchataynu
(zih-mahn sim-khah-tay-new; the season of joy).
And you shall rejoice in your feast, you, and your son, and your daughter,
and your male servant, and your maidservant, and the Levite, and the
stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, that are within your gates.
Deuteronomy 16:14
Appear in the sanctuary during all the festivals
The holy days of Sukkot, Passover, and Shavuot are called the Pilgrimage festi-
vals because Jews went to Jerusalem, and specifically to the Holy Temple, on
these three occasions each year (if practical).
Three times a year all your males shall appear before the Lord your God in
the place which He shall choose; on the Feast of Unleavened Bread, and on
the Feast of Weeks, and on the Feast of Tabernacles; and they shall not
appear before the Lord empty.
Deuteronomy 16:16
Simchat Torah: Let’s hear it for the Torah!
Simchat Torah (sim-kaht toe-rah; rejoice in the Torah) isn’t mentioned by
name in the Torah. It’s the day (on the 23rd of Tishre) when the Torah is fin-
ished and is begun again during the weekly public readings of the Torah (see
Chapter 13). In the Torah, the holy day is called Shemini Atzeret, as I mention
in the earlier section “Rest and do no work on the day after Sukkot.” On
Simchat Torah, Jews gather in synagogues and take turns dancing with the
Torah.
Passover: The oldest Jewish holy day
The central event of the Torah is the story of the bondage of slavery, ultimate
liberation, and the receiving of the Torah at Mount Sinai by the Children of
Israel. The holy day of Passover (in the month of Nisan) is designed for
observers to retell the story in great detail each year and be nourished by its
lessons. Retelling this story each year on Passover is the oldest communal
ritual in the tradition called Judaism. In many places throughout the text, the
Torah explains how to observe the holy day of Passover.
186
Part IV: The Importance of the Torah in Judaism 

Remove chametz from your home and property on the eve of Passover
Chametz (khah-maytz) is hard to define. Generally, it’s any food that rises,
such as breads and cakes that rise with yeast. The bread of Passover is
matzah, which is unleavened bread. The basic framework of the observance
of Passover comes directly from the Torah.
Seven days shall you eat unleavened bread; however the first day you shall
put the leaven away, out of your houses; for whoever eats leavened bread
from the first day until the seventh day, that soul shall be cut off from Israel.
Exodus 12:15
Don’t possess chametz during Passover
On the days immediately before Passover, Jews prepare their homes by
searching for, finding, and discarding all products that contain leavening
agents as well as food products that the sages have added because of their
similarity to food products that rise like leaven.
For seven days there shall be no leaven found in your houses; for whoever
eats that which is leavened, that soul shall be cut off from the congregation
of Israel, whether he be a sojourner, or one that is born in the land.
Exodus 12:19
Unleavened bread shall be eaten throughout the seven days; and no
leavened bread shall be seen with you, nor shall there be leaven seen with
you, in all your borders.
Exodus 13:7
Don’t eat any food containing chametz on Passover
It’s forbidden to have chametz in a Jewish home and also forbidden to eat
these products during the days of Passover.
You shall eat nothing leavened; in all your homes shall you eat unleavened
bread.
Exodus 12:20
And Moses said unto the people, “Remember this day, in which you came out
from Egypt, out of the house of bondage; for by the strength of His hand the
Lord brought you out from this place; there no leavened bread shall be eaten.
Exodus 13:3
187
Chapter 11: Observing the Holy Days in Torah Time

Discuss the departure from Egypt on the first night of Passover
This law is the basis of the family Passover meal, known as the seder
(say-der; order), when the story of the Exodus is told.
And you shall tell your son on that day, saying, “It is because of that which
the Lord did for me when I came out of Egypt.”
Exodus 13:8
Eat the flesh of the Paschal lamb with unleavened
bread and bitter herbs
Unleavened bread (matzah) and bitter herbs are two of the important symbols
that are essential to have on the table during the Passover feast (seder).
Matzah is a symbol of the oppression of the Children of Israel in Egypt. The
Israelites left Egypt quickly and didn’t have time to wait until their bread had
risen. The bitter herb is also a symbol of oppression; it reminds participants
of the bitterness of slavery. In addition, a small shank bone is placed on the
Passover table as a symbol of the Paschal lamb once offered as a sacrifice
when the Holy Temple stood in Jerusalem.
In the second month on the fourteenth day at dusk they shall keep it; they
shall eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.
Numbers 9:11
Shavuot: When God gave 
the Torah to the world
The book of Exodus says “Three times during the year you shall celebrate a
feast for Me” (23:14). One feast is Sukkot, one is Passover, and the third is
Shavuot. Shavuot is the commemoration of the giving and receiving of the
Torah at Mount Sinai; it’s celebrated during the month of Sivan. It’s custom-
ary for Jews to stay up all night and study the Torah on Shavuot. During the
morning service on Shavuot, the Ten Commandments are publicly read.
Following are the Torah commandments that address Shavuot.
188
Part IV: The Importance of the Torah in Judaism 

Rest and do no work
As I discuss in the context of the other major Jewish holy days, most Jewish
festivals forbid Jews from working. The holy days require special treatment;
mundane activities are inappropriate.
And you shall make proclamation on the same day; it shall be called holy to
you; you shall do no manner of work; it is a statute forever in all your
dwellings throughout your generations.
Leviticus 23:21
Rejoice during the festivals
As with Passover and Sukkot, Shavuot is a day of rejoicing and festivity. It’s
not a regular workday, and the mood is always one of joy and celebration.
And you shall rejoice in your feast, you, and your son, and your daughter,
and your male servant, and your maidservant, and the Levite, and the
stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, that are within your gates.

Following Jewish Customs
According to the Torah
In This Chapter

 Eating the Torah way
I
t has been said that Judaism isn’t a religion but a way of life. In this chap-
ter, you see lots of evidence of this fact. Judaism, which is the so-called
“religion” of the Torah, is far more than a set of spiritual beliefs and is also far
more than a set of rules.
The Jewish people, originally known as the Children of Israel, are a family that
grew into a nation. As a nation, the Jewish people have customs, folkways,
legends, rituals, signs, symbols, history, and more. In particular, Judaism has
a distinctive set of life cycle practices, a distinctive set of symbols, and an
extremely distinctive set of laws and customs surrounding the most basic of
human activities: eating.
Torah Traditions Related
to the Cycle of Life
The five major life cycle events described in the Torah are
 Birth
 Becoming an adult
 Marriage
 Divorce
 Death

Each of these events is of concern to God, and each is explored at length
starting in the Written Torah and then with more depth in the Oral Torah (see
Chapter 3). As you find out in the following sections, the Torah is an instruction
manual for life and all its many details.
Circumcision: A big issue
over a little piece of tissue
When you think of circumcision, you probably think of the surgical procedure
that removes the foreskin from a penis. But the Hebrew word for “foreskin,”
orlah (oar-lah), is used in more than one way in the Torah — and ultimately
provides an explanation, or at least some insight, into the ancient Jewish
practice of male circumcision. In the following sections, I go over the Torah’s
discussion of this ceremony and explain when and why it takes place.
The Torah’s mention of circumcision
In the book of Deuteronomy, the Torah says, “You shall circumcise your heart”
(Deuteronomy 10:16). According to the great Torah commentators, this verse
means that a person must remove the barriers that dull the heart, which is
the seat of compassion. Circumcision is a process of removing barriers, whether
it’s an emotional barrier that causes people to be insensitive to others or a
physical barrier, like the foreskin of a penis.
The Hebrew term for circumcision is brit milah (b’rit mee-lah; covenant of
circumcision). The word “brit” (or the more common pronunciation, “bris”)
means “covenant or agreement” and appears in the Torah in relation to
Abraham, one of the patriarchs of Judaism, whom I discuss in Chapter 4.
The Torah relates that when Abraham was 99 years old, God appeared before
him and told him to perfect himself. Even though perfection is a concept that
really only applies to God, Judaism urges the Jewish people to participate in
a lifelong pursuit of refinement and perfection. The Hebrew term middot
(mee-dote; measures) refers to a person’s character traits, such as compassion,
empathy, or honesty; the goal of Torah study is to learn how to refine those
traits, to deepen your understanding of those traits, and to ultimately elevate
yourself spiritually. God commands Abraham to “walk before Me and be
perfect” (Genesis 17:1).
In the Torah, right after God commands that Abraham perfect himself, God
changes Abraham’s name. (In Hebrew, Abraham is Avraham, pronounced
ahv-rah-hahm.) In the Torah, his name was originally Avram, and God says,
“Your name shall no longer be Avram, but your name shall be Avraham”
(Genesis 17:5). Torah commentators point out that the name Avraham is
actually a contraction of the words “av hamon,” which means “father of a
multitude.” In other words, God sets in motion a transformation from Avram
192
Part IV: The Importance of the Torah in Judaism 

(which means “father of Aram,” Aram being his former country) to Avraham,
with Abraham ultimately becoming the head of a huge number of people and
his family becoming a nation.
After God changes Abraham’s name, God makes an eternal agreement with
him — and with his descendants. God promises to give Abraham’s offspring
the Land of Canaan (Israel). Finally, God seals the deal with the ritual of
circumcision and declares:
This is My covenant which you shall keep, between Me and you and the
descendants after you. Every male among you shall be circumcised. And you
shall be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskin; and it shall be a token of a
covenant between Me and you. At eight days old every male among you
shall be circumcised, every male throughout your generations . . . and My
covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant. And the
uncircumcised male who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin, that
soul shall be cut off from his people; he has broken My covenant.
Genesis 17:10–14
Circumcision is a Jewish symbol and perhaps the most powerful Jewish
symbol of all. It’s a sign between each Jewish man and God, like the signing of
an agreement or contract. What is the contract about? It’s a promise to the
Jewish people that God will never abandon them. And it’s a promise to God
that the Jewish people will never abandon Him. (I discuss other symbols of
Judaism later in this chapter.)
The basics of the ceremony
The ancient practice of circumcision is a crucial ritual in Jewish life. On the
eighth day of their lives, all Jewish boys are circumcised (unless the ritual
needs to be postponed for some medical or developmental reason) and
officially named. The Jewish sages point out that there’s great significance in
the fact that the Torah commands that the ritual be done on the eighth day.
As I explain in Chapter 11, the cycle of seven days is the cycle of creation.
God created the world in six days and rested on the seventh day, Shabbat.
The eighth day is the first day of a new cycle, when humankind is charged
with the task of taking over and perfecting the world. In the same spirit, the
circumcision of a boy on the eighth day of his life is a symbolic act reflecting
his lifelong assignment to perfect himself.
According to the Jewish view, the world is imperfect. This is a basic and
important assumption on the part of the Torah sages. The Hebrew term for it
is tikkun olam (tee-koon oh-lahm; repairing the world). God created the world
unfinished, and it’s humankind who must participate in the perfection of both
the individual and also the world at large. The Jewish ritual of circumcision
reflects this assumption that each person is a work in progress. And every
part of a person, from inner personality traits to private physical form and
sexuality, is in need of refinement.
193
Chapter 12: Following Jewish Customs According to the Torah

The Bar (or Bat) Mitzvah: Starting to
accept responsibility when puberty sets in
A Bar Mitzvah or Bat Mitzvah ceremony commonly refers to the public
Jewish “coming of age” ritual. The term Bar Mitzvah (bar mitz-vah) uses the
Aramaic word bar (son), and literally means “son of the commandment.” The
female equivalent is Bat Mitzvah (baht mitz-vah); “bat” means “daughter” in
both Aramaic and Hebrew.
The Written Torah doesn’t mention Bar Mitzvahs (the actual plural, in
Hebrew, isn’t “Bar Mitzvahs” but rather “B’nai Mitzvah,” pronounced bih-nay
mitz-vah), but the process of becoming a responsible adult, beginning at the
age of Bar and Bat Mitzvah, is built into the legal structure of the Oral Torah.
According to Jewish law, when a boy reaches age 13 or a girl reaches age 12,
the occasion marks the beginning of a process during which the young
person takes on responsibility.
According to traditional Jewish belief, a baby isn’t born “pure.” On the contrary,
children seem quite willing and able to participate in all kinds of forbidden and
even destructive activities. It’s parents’ responsibility to educate their children,
to refine their character traits, and to instruct them in the proper ways to behave
and live. These proper ways are spelled out in the Torah and its commentaries.
194
Part IV: The Importance of the Torah in Judaism 
Do Jewish girls undergo a special
ceremony at birth?
There’s no female equivalent to circumcision in
Jewish practice. Female circumcision, as prac-
ticed in some cultures, involves the removal of
the clitoris and is really a form of mutilation with
profound and horrible results. A victim of such a
procedure loses the pleasurable physical sen-
sation that is the result of sexual stimulation. The
Jewish ritual of brit milah, despite some claims
to the contrary, has no such negative results
among men. In fact, some people throughout
history have suggested that circumcision actu-
ally has a health benefit. Recent studies prove
conclusively that circumcision is effective in
helping to stop the spread of AIDS.
A Jewish girl, however, is officially named
shortly after her birth, just like a Jewish boy is
named at his brit milah. A baby girl is customarily
named on the first Shabbat after her birth during
the Torah service when the baby’s father is hon-
ored by being called to bless the Torah (see
Chapter 13 for more on the public reading of the
Torah).
Another form of celebration that has developed
on the occasion of the birth of a girl is a party
called a brit bat(b’rit baht; a daughter’s covenant).
It’s usually a home celebration, but there’s no set
ritual. Either with the assistance of a local rabbi or
by themselves, the baby’s parents put together a
ceremony with appropriate prayers and spiritual
intention.

Until the ages of Bar and Bat Mitzvah, Jewish children aren’t considered (by
Jewish law) to be responsible for their misdeeds. But when they hit the right
age, responsibility begins to shift. From these teen years until the age of 20,
Jewish law teaches that the heavenly court doesn’t consider the individual to
be fully responsible for his or her misdeeds. Full personal responsibility is a
gradual process that reaches its climax after age 20. The Torah considers a
20-year-old man to be a full adult, and according to Jewish law, after age 20
the heavenly court begins to look at a person as fully independent.
A public or private ritual isn’t essential to mark a Bar or Bat Mitzvah. It hap-
pens automatically, according to the Oral Torah, either when the young
person reaches 13 (boys) or 12 (girls) or when physical signs of puberty
appear. The Talmud specifically refers to the appearance of two pubic hairs.
One significant relationship between the Bar Mitzvah and the Torah is that
when a boy turns 13, he’s permitted to be called up to the Torah during the
public reading of the Torah and is permitted to recite the Torah blessing. In
liberal synagogues, this privilege is extended to girls of Bat Mitzvah age. See
Chapter 13 for more about the Torah synagogue service.
Marriage: Two halves make a whole
To understand the Jewish concept of marriage, it’s important to remember
that God created humans by creating one person first. The original Adam was
then split into two halves. In the first chapter of the Torah, Genesis 1:27 says,
“God created man in His own image, in the image of God He created him;
male and female He created them.” The original person was androgynous.
(See Chapter 4 for more details.)
Then, in the second chapter of the Torah, God said:
It is not good for man to be alone; I will make him a helper suitable for him.
Out of the ground God formed every beast of the field and every bird of the
sky, and brought them to the man to see what he would call them; and
whatever the man called a living creature, that was its name. The man gave
names to all the cattle, and to the birds of the sky, and to every beast of the
field, but for Adam there was not found a helper suitable for him. So God
caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and he slept; then He took one of
his sides and closed up the flesh at that place. God fashioned into a woman
the side which He had taken from the man, and brought her to the man. The
man said, “This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh; she shall be
called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.” For this reason a man
shall leave his father and his mother, and be joined to his wife; and they
shall become one flesh.
Genesis 2:18–24
195
Chapter 12: Following Jewish Customs According to the Torah

The great Torah sages understand this passage to mean that each person’s
soul is really only half. The deeper meaning of marriage in Jewish tradition is
a joining of two halves to form one whole soul. In Jewish tradition, marriage
isn’t for procreation. Procreation is certainly a Torah commandment; in fact,
it’s the very first actual commandment in the Torah (“Be fruitful and multi-
ply” [Genesis 1:22]). But the purpose of marriage according to the Torah is
companionship (“It is not good for man to be alone” [Genesis 2:18]).
In the following sections, I explain the procedure and duties of marriage
according to the Torah.
The process of getting hitched
According to the Oral Torah, there are actually three possible marriage
procedures:
 A man hands a woman an object of value (like a ring or a coin), which
she accepts for the expressed purpose of creating a marriage.
 A man and woman sign a properly written marriage contract.
 A man and woman engage in sexual intercourse with the intention, by
both parties, of creating a marriage.
Today, Jewish marriages are usually a combination of these three methods: a
marriage contract (called a ketubah, pronounced keh-too-bah, which means
“contract”) is signed, a ring is given, and the marriage is consummated.
The duties of marriage
The Written Torah contains little detail concerning marriage. A verse in
Exodus (21:10) indicates that a husband and wife have responsibilities to
each other in three areas:
 Food
 Clothing
 Conjugal rights
However, the rights and responsibilities between a husband and wife are
discussed in great detail in the Oral Torah, most specifically in the Talmud.
One interesting aspect covered is sexuality. Jewish law is firm: A husband’s one
obligation during sex is to make sure that his wife is experiencing a pleasant
encounter. In fact, if a husband wants to change careers, he must have his
wife’s permission if the change may result in his being home less and therefore
less apt to make love with his wife.
196
Part IV: The Importance of the Torah in Judaism 

Here are some additional teachings from the Torah regarding marriage:
 A newly married husband shall be free for one year to rejoice with his
wife. A bridegroom shall also be exempt for a whole year from taking
part in any public labor, such as military service.
“When a man takes a new wife, he shall not enter military service, nor
shall he be charged with any business; he shall be free for his house one
year, and shall cheer his wife whom he has taken.” (Deuteronomy 24:5)
 A husband who defames his wife’s honor (by falsely accusing her of
unchastity before marriage) must live with her throughout all his lifetime.
“And they shall fine him a hundred shekels of silver, and give them to
the father of the woman, because he has brought an evil name upon a
virgin of Israel; and she shall be his wife; he may not divorce her all his
days.” (Deuteronomy 22:19)
Divorce: Fix it or get out
While some religious traditions forbid divorce, Judaism does not. In the Torah,
divorce is viewed as a common and acceptable occurrence (Deuteronomy
24:1–4), and although the Talmud teaches that the “altar in heaven weeps” on
the occasion of a divorce, there’s no requirement that a husband and wife
continue their marriage if they’re miserable together. As one of my teachers
advised me when I was considering divorce, “If you can fix it, fix it. If you
can’t fix it, get out.”
A Jewish marriage has two levels: One is spiritual (as I explain earlier in this
chapter), and the other is down-to-earth and quite practical. The practical
aspect of marriage is reflected in the fact that Jewish marriages are finalized
by a contract. The contract is mostly about the rights of the parties and the
terms if a divorce occurs. Yes, when a Jewish couple gets married, they sign a
document that has a lot to do with what happens in the case of a divorce. When
a divorce occurs, the marriage contract is fulfilled and then destroyed, severing
both the spiritual and the physical connections between the two people.
Here are some rules of divorce according to the Torah:
 A man may not divorce his wife concerning whom he has published an evil
report (about her unchastity) before marriage (see the preceding section).
“And they shall fine him a hundred shekels of silver, and give them to
the father of the woman, because he has brought an evil name upon a
virgin of Israel; and she shall be his wife; he may not divorce her all his
days.” (Deuteronomy 22:19)
 A divorce must be enacted by a formal written document.
197
Chapter 12: Following Jewish Customs According to the Torah

“When a man takes a wife, and marries her, then it comes to pass that
she does not find favor in his eyes, because he has found something
unseemly in her, then he writes her a bill of divorce, and gives it in her
hand, and sends her out of his house.” (Deuteronomy 24:1)
The topic of divorce provides a good example of how the Torah can’t
simply be read literally (see Chapter 15 for details). Deuteronomy 24:1
makes it seem as though only a husband can initiate a divorce. The fact
is that the Oral Torah explains how both husband and wife have rights
and responsibilities in a marriage, including the right to go to a Jewish
court to request that the marriage be dissolved.
 A man who divorced his wife shall not remarry her if she married
another man after the divorce.
“Her former husband, who sent her away, may not take her again to be
his wife. After that she is defiled, for that is an abomination before the
Lord, and you shall not cause sin in the land which the Lord thy God
gives you as an inheritance.” (Deuteronomy 24:4)
Death: The end and the beginning
A common misconception about Judaism is that Jewish teachings don’t say
much about death and the afterlife. This is a gross distortion of Judaism
based in part on the fact that the Written Torah has little to say about death.
The Oral Torah, including the Talmud and the teachings of Kabbalah, is
where you find extensive treatment of death and the afterlife. In the following
sections, I discuss teachings about death and customs related to death as
they’re described in the Torah.
Torah teachings about death
A person is a combination of body and soul; the soul is immortal, but the
body isn’t. In the book of Genesis (see Chapter 4), the loss of immortality is
one of the consequences of Adam and Eve eating from the Tree of Knowledge
of Good and Evil. Had Adam and Eve obeyed God, eternal life would have
been theirs. The verse in the Torah that describes the result of the primal sin
is, “For you are dust and to dust you shall return” (Genesis 3:19). It estab-
lishes that humans are mortal; they are born, live, and die.
The Torah also teaches that death isn’t the end. A verse in Genesis is the
basis for the teaching that the soul, which God breathed into Adam’s nostrils,
continues on after death: “Abraham breathed his last and died in a ripe old
age, an old man and satisfied with life; and he was gathered to his people”
(Genesis 25:8).
198
Part IV: The Importance of the Torah in Judaism 

Other Jewish teachings on death include the following:
 Every human soul has its own assignment and has an obligation to fulfill
its assignment. If a soul fails, it’s reincarnated and given another chance.
 Heaven and hell exist (called shamayim and gehennom, pronounced
shah-mah-yeem and geh-heh-num). But the Jewish ideas of heaven and hell
are quite different from Christian views. Judaism doesn’t conceive of
hell as a place of eternal torment with fiery pits and desperate loneliness. In
Judaism, hell is a more of a waiting room or temporary place where the
soul is refined or where it waits before its next incarnation in the body of
another person. Jewish tradition also describes hell as somewhere a
person can be in this world when he or she is stuck in some unfortunate
state of consciousness. (See my book Kabbalah For Dummies, published
by Wiley, for more on these concepts.)
199
Chapter 12: Following Jewish Customs According to the Torah
Burying the patriarchs and matriarchs of Judaism
The practice of burying a corpse is well-estab-
lished in the Torah, which specifically describes
the burials of the three patriarchs — Abraham,
Isaac, and Jacob.
 Abraham: “These are the days of the years
of Abraham’s life that he lived, one hundred
and seventy-five years. Abraham breathed
his last and died in a ripe old age, an old
man and satisfied with life; and he was
gathered to his people. Then his sons Isaac
and Ishmael buried him in the cave of
Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of
Zohar the Hittite, facing Mamre, the field
which Abraham purchased from the sons of
Heth; there Abraham was buried with Sarah
his wife.” (Genesis 25:7–10)
 Isaac: “Isaac breathed his last and died and
was gathered to his people, an old man who
was fulfilled; and his sons, Esau and Jacob
buried him.” (Genesis 35:29)
 Jacob: “His sons did for him as he had
instructed them; his sons carried him to the
land of Canaan and buried him in the cave
of the field of Machpelah facing Mamre,
which Abraham had bought along with the
field for a burial site from Ephron the Hittite.
After he had buried his father, Joseph
returned to Egypt, he and his brothers, and
all who had gone up with him to bury his
father.” (Genesis 50:12–14)
The Torah also mentions the burials of two of
the four matriarchs. Here’s a bit of trivia for you:
The burial of Rachel contains the first mention
of a gravestone in the Torah.
 Sarah: “Abraham buried Sarah his wife in
the cave of the field at Machpelah facing
Mamre, that is, Hebron, in the land of
Canaan. So the field and the cave that is in
it, were confirmed as Abraham’s as an
estate for a burial site by the sons of Heth.”
(Genesis 23:19–20)
 Rachel: “Rachel died, and she was buried
on the road to Ephrath, which is Bethlehem.
Jacob set up a monument over her grave.”
(Genesis 35:19–20)

Mourning and burial traditions
The Jewish laws and customs pertaining to death are quite extensive. In fact,
Judaism is well-known for the many stages that mourners must go through
from the moment of the death of a close relative. Cremation is forbidden by
Jewish law. The phrase in the Torah that says, “You must bury the body on
the same day” (Deuteronomy 21:23) is the basis of this commandment.
Here are two common Jewish death and mourning customs and their corre-
sponding verses in the Torah:
 When a person learns about the death of a close relative, he must tear
his clothing as a symbol of mourning.
“Then Jacob rent his garments and placed sackcloth on his loins.”
(Genesis 37:34)
 Jewish law requires that a corpse be buried as soon as possible.
“You shall surely bury him that day.” (Deuteronomy 21:23)
It’s a Sign! Surveying Some Well-Known
Jewish Symbols
The use of symbols is important in Judaism, and the Torah provides the
Jewish people with powerful symbols as reminders of God and God’s teachings.
Three major symbols of Judaism, as found in the Torah, are:
 Mezuzah (a sign on the doorpost of every Jewish home)
 Tzitzit (a sign on the corners of clothes that Jews wear)
 Tefillin (a sign that literally wraps itself around your head and arm)
Mezuzah: A sign of God on the
doorpost of your house
One of the most well-known Jewish symbols is the mezuzah (meh-zooz-ah). A
mezuzah is basically a piece of parchment on which specially selected verses
from the Torah are written by a certified scribe (see Chapter 14 for more
about scribes). The texts written on the parchment include the verses in the
Torah that refer to the mezuzah. The parchment is usually put into a little
box and attached to the right side of a doorpost as you walk into a Jewish
home (see Figure 12-1). Some people put a mezuzah on each of the doors
within a house (with the exception of the bathroom). The mezuzah functions
200
Part IV: The Importance of the Torah in Judaism 

as a reminder that God is everywhere and that the Torah instructs you to
speak about God and God’s teachings as much as possible.
Jews recite special blessings when attaching a mezuzah to a doorpost. In
addition, there are other rules pertaining to a mezuzah, including exactly
where it should be placed (on the doorpost on the right side as you walk into
a home or room, about one-third of the way down from the top of the door
frame) and the exact style of calligraphy that the trained scribe uses on the
parchment inside. The commandment to put up a mezuzah can be found
twice in the Torah (note the text not in italics):
Hear, O Israel! The LORD is our God, the LORD is one! You shall love the
LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your
might. And these words, which I am commanding you today, shall be on
your heart. You shall teach them diligently to your children and you shall
talk of them when you sit in your house and when you walk on the way and
when you lie down and when you rise up. You shall bind them as a sign on
your arm and they shall be ornaments between your eyes. You shall write
them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates.
Deuteronomy 6:4–9
You shall therefore impress these words of mine on your heart and on your
soul; and you shall bind them as a sign on your arm, and they shall be an
ornament between your eyes. You shall teach them to your children, talking
of them when you sit in your house and when you walk along the road and
when you lie down and when you rise up. You shall write them on the
doorposts of your house and on your gates, so that your days and the days
of your sons may be multiplied on the land which God swore to your fathers
to give them, as long as the heavens remain above the earth.
Deuteronomy 11:18–21
Figure 12-1:

201
Chapter 12: Following Jewish Customs According to the Torah

It’s customary among traditional Jews to touch the mezuzah as they pass
through the doorway where a mezuzah is attached. Some people touch a
hand to their mouths, kiss the hand, and then touch the mezuzah (or vice
versa), as though they’re kissing the mezuzah itself.
Tzitzit: Strings attached
In the Torah, God instructs the Children of Israel to attach special threads to
the four corners of their garments. In Hebrew, the threads are called tzitzit
(tzee-tzeet; fringes). This commandment appears twice in the Torah text:
 “God also spoke to Moses, saying, ‘Speak to the sons of Israel, and tell
them that they shall make for themselves tzitzit on the corners of their
garments throughout their generations.’” (Numbers 15:37–38)
 “You shall make yourself tzitzit on the four corners of your garment with
which you cover yourself.” (Deuteronomy 22:12)
Tzitzit are placed on the corners of garments to serve as a reminder of God
and God’s commandments. Today, you can see tzitzit on the four corners of a
Jewish prayer shawl called a tallit (tah-leet; prayer shawl); Figure 12-2 shows
a shawl with tzitzit. In ancient times, typical clothing had four corners, so the
tzitzit were on most pieces of clothing. Today, it’s not required to attach
tzitzit to all garments; in order to fulfill this commandment, some traditional
Jewish men wear something called a tallit katan (tah-leet kah-tahn; little tallit)
under their shirts. The tallit katan is a square piece of cloth with a hole in the
center for the head and tzitzit on the four corners.
Figure 12-2:

202
Part IV: The Importance of the Torah in Judaism 

The great Torah commentator, Rashi, points out that the numerical value of
the Hebrew letters that make up the word “tzitzit” as it’s spelled in the
Mishnah is 600. He also points out that for tzitzit to be correct, each corner
has 8 threads and 5 knots, which totals 13. 600 plus 13 adds up to 613, which
is the number of commandments in the Torah (see Appendixes B and C).
Tefillin: The ties that bind
The two passages that I reproduce in the earlier section “Mezuzah: A sign of
God on the doorpost of your house” are the same source for the commandment
to put on tefillin. Tefillin (teh-fill-een) look quite unusual to someone who has
never seen them before or who doesn’t know what they are. Tefillin are basically
two leather boxes containing pieces of parchment on which verses from the
Torah (including the verses that refer to tefillin themselves) are written by a
trained and qualified scribe. The boxes have leather straps connected to them,
which are used to attached the tefillin to the forehead and the arm (next to the
heart), as you can see in Figure 12-3.
Figure 12-3:

203
Chapter 12: Following Jewish Customs According to the Torah

The message behind wearing tefillin is simple and clear: Consciousness of God
and God’s commandments must be in your mind and in your heart. Traditionally,
Jewish men wear tefillin on weekdays during the morning prayer service, but
the commandment can be fulfilled any time during the day.
There are many aspects to the proper creation and wearing of tefillin. These
details are found in the Oral Torah and include:
 The proper way to make tefillin
 The proper materials to be used (for example, the leather must be from
a kosher animal, and the sinew used as the thread that sews the tefillin
together must also be from a kosher animal)
 The proper texts, their contents, and the way they should be written
 The proper order of the texts within the tefillin
 The proper way to put on tefillin
 The proper blessings to say when putting on tefillin
 The proper way to remove tefillin
 The proper way to store tefillin
But Is It Kosher? Jewish Eating Practices
One of the most distinctive religious practices among the Jewish people
involves the kosher laws found in the Torah. The Jewish laws of kashrut
(kahsh-root; kosher) are complex and wide-ranging, but I summarize their
major principles in the following sections.
Don’t eat the flesh of a beast
that died naturally
A part of the laws of kashrut is the prohibition against eating an animal that
has died of natural causes (including death by another animal or by disease).
In order for an animal to be acceptable, it must be slaughtered in as painless
a way as possible (see the next section). Here are two Torah verses that
express this requirement:
 “And you shall be holy men unto Me; therefore you shall not eat any
flesh that is torn of beasts in the field; you shall cast it to the dogs.”
(Exodus 22:30)
204
Part IV: The Importance of the Torah in Judaism 

 “You shall not eat of any thing that dies of itself; you may give it to the
stranger that is within your gates, that he may eat it; or you may sell it to
a foreigner; for you are a holy people to the Lord your God.”
(Deuteronomy 14:21)
Slaughter animals as painlessly
as possible
The laws of kosher slaughtering of an animal for food are complex. But all the
laws (outlined in detail in the Oral Torah) support the basic goal of minimizing
the suffering of the animal. Those who are qualified to slaughter animals for
kosher food are highly trained. In addition, they have the sharpest knives (to
prevent tearing the flesh) and must kill the animal with one gesture of the
knife — again with the goal of minimizing the animal’s suffering. The key phrase
in the following passage is “as I have commanded you”; this is the phrase that
refers to the proper slaughtering technique.
If the place which the Lord your God shall choose to put His name there is
too far from you, then you shall kill from your own herd and from your own
flock, which the Lord has given you, as I have commanded you, and you
shall eat within your gates, whatever your soul desires.
Deuteronomy 12:21
Cheeseburgers are for never
Jews who observe the kosher laws can’t eat cheeseburgers. Nor can they eat
a steak with bread and butter. I can give many more examples, but the gen-
eral rule according to the Torah is that meat and dairy may not be prepared,
served, or eaten together. While the details of this law are complex, the Torah
verse that alludes to it appears quite simple: “You shall not cook a kid in its
mother’s milk” (Deuteronomy 14:21).
This brief statement in the Torah reflects a large area of Jewish law, expanded
in the Oral Torah, that forms an essential part of the Torah’s kosher laws. Jewish
tradition has also developed rules regulating how much time you must wait
between eating a meat meal and consuming a dairy product. Although this
practice varies from place to place, observant Jews wait between three and
six hours between eating meat and then eating a dairy product.
205
Chapter 12: Following Jewish Customs According to the Torah

Don’t stuff yourself
Although not exactly laws about kosher food, Jewish tradition has developed
laws known as sumptuary laws that are basically prohibitions against waste and
overabundance. Throughout Jewish history, leaders of various communities
have tried to enforce these laws and have gone to great efforts to minimize
wasteful habits. Scholars point to two passages in the Torah that support these
efforts:
 The first is the passage in Genesis when, during seven years of famine,
Jacob tells his sons, “Why do you make yourselves so conspicuous?”
(Genesis 42:1). The Talmud explains that Jacob said to his sons, “Do not
show yourselves to be sated either before Esau or Ishmael in order that
you do not arouse their envy against you.”
 The second verse connected to sumptuary laws is, “And they shall say
to the elders of his city, ‘This, our son, is stubborn and rebellious, he
does not listen to our voice; he is a glutton, and a drunkard’”
(Deuteronomy 21:20).
Other important kosher laws
Additional kosher laws found in the Torah include the following:
 Blood must be removed from meat as completely as possible before
consumption.
“And you shall eat no manner of blood, whether it be of fowl or of beast,
in any of your dwellings.” (Leviticus 7:26)
“Only be steadfast in not eating the blood; for the blood is the life; and
you shall not eat the life with the flesh.” (Deuteronomy 12:23)
 The only mammals permissible as food are those that chew their cud
and have split hooves (such as cows, lambs, and buffalos).
“Nevertheless, these you shall not eat: those that only chew the cud, or
those that only have split hooves. The camel, because he chews his cud
but does not have split hooves, is unclean to you.” (Leviticus 11:4)
 Only fish with fins and scales are permissible as food (in other words, no
shellfish is allowed).
“These you may eat of all that are in the waters: whatever has fins and
scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the rivers, them you may eat.”
(Leviticus 11:9)
206
Part IV: The Importance of the Torah in Judaism 

 Birds of prey are forbidden as food.
“And these you shall detest among the fowls; they shall not be eaten,
they are a detestable thing: the great vulture, and the bearded vulture,
and the osprey.” (Leviticus 11:13–19)
 Do not eat things that creep upon the earth nor a worm found in a fruit.
“And every swarming thing that swarms upon the earth is a detestable
thing; it shall not be eaten. Whatever goes upon its belly, and whatever
goes upon all fours, or whatever has many feet, even all swarming things
that swarm upon the earth, them you shall not eat; for they are a
detestable thing.” (Leviticus 11:41–42)
 Do not eat things that swarm in the water.
“You shall not make yourselves detestable with any swarming thing that
swarms, neither shall you make yourselves unclean with them, that you
should be defiled thereby.” (Leviticus 11:43)
 Do not eat any vermin of the earth.
“For I am the Lord your God; sanctify yourselves therefore, and be holy;
for I am holy; you shall not defile yourselves with any manner of swarming
thing that moves upon the earth.” (Leviticus 11:44)
 Do not eat winged insects.
“And all winged swarming things are unclean unto you; they shall not be
eaten.” (Deuteronomy 14:19)

Synagogue Service
In This Chapter
 Understanding the Jewish custom of publicly reading from a Torah scroll
 Getting set for the Torah service
 Surveying the steps of the Torah service
P
eople attend synagogues on Shabbat for many reasons — not all of them
so great. Some sit in the back and gossip. Some come just for the refresh-
ments after the services. Still others like to pray among their neighbors.
But the truly compelling reason for attending a synagogue Shabbat service on
Saturday morning is to hear the public reading of the Torah. According to
Jewish tradition, there’s no requirement for prayer to be public; but what is
required is the public reading from the sacred Torah scroll.
A Torah scroll, found only in a synagogue, is treated with the highest regard;
it’s the primary sacred object of Jewish life. Every aspect of the care and
treatment of a Torah scroll serves to protect the Torah’s sanctity. The physical
scrolls are treated with the same delicacy shown to a newborn baby.
In most synagogues, the Torah service is breathtakingly dramatic and moving.
The most sacred object in Judaism is carried in a procession throughout 
the synagogue. It’s undressed from its elegant wrapping, and a portion of the
wisdom it contains is read aloud and listened to carefully by the community 
of worshipers. In this chapter, I describe a Torah service in its entirety.

Understanding the Basic Customs
of Torah Readings
The reading of a Torah scroll on Shabbat has two key characteristics: The
reading is public, and it involves only a small portion of text. Given the length
of the Torah, if a congregation were to try to read the entire Torah scroll in
one sitting, everyone would be at the synagogue for a while! In the following
sections, I explain these customs in more details.
Reading the Torah publicly
It’s a Jewish custom to read the Torah out loud publicly. In fact, Moses read
portions of the Torah to the congregation of Israel. The Torah says, “And he
took the book of the covenant, and read it in the hearing of the people; and
they said: ‘All that the Lord has spoken will we do, and obey’” (Exodus 24:7).
Torahs have been read publicly on a weekly basis in Jewish communities and
synagogues for thousands of years. It’s easy for everyone today to own a
copy of the Torah text, but for many centuries, the only way to ensure that
everyone heard God’s instructions to the Jewish people was to conduct
public readings.
Why is the public reading of the Torah so important? Judaism has a basic belief
that it’s the responsibility of every individual in a community to commit himself
or herself to a lifelong habit of learning. And what’s contained in the Jewish
definition of learning? For thousands of years, it has meant the study of the
Torah. Young children study the Torah, teenagers study the Torah, adults
study the Torah, and the community elders study the Torah.
The Torah teaches that on a daily basis one should be occupied with the study
of the Torah. After all, if the Torah is God’s communication through Moses of
the truth about reality, why shouldn’t there be a preoccupation and dedication
to the study of it? In the words of the Torah, “You shall teach them diligently to
your children, and shall talk of them when you sit in your house, and when you
walk by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise up”
(Deuteronomy 6:7).
Reading a portion of the Torah weekly
Centuries ago, Jewish sages developed a system that allows an individual or a
community to read the entire Torah in one year. The system divides the
Torah into bite-size, weekly portions, and one portion is read each Shabbat.
210
Part IV: The Importance of the Torah in Judaism 

Most synagogue congregations throughout the world and throughout history
have followed this system. The main purpose of the weekly Torah program,
as established by the sages, is to make sure that everyone in the community
becomes familiar with the Torah’s teachings.
This weekly Torah program can be compared to going to a gym. If you go to
a gym once a month for eight hours, you’re wasting your time because you
don’t get into shape and can easily injure yourself. But if you go to the gym
every few days and work out for 20 minutes each visit, you can make real
progress. It’s the same with studying the Torah: Studying one small portion
each week allows you to absorb a lot more than you would in a handful of
marathon sessions. And within a year, you’re back to the beginning again.
In the following sections, I describe the origins of reading the entire Torah in
one year and compare it to another tradition: reading the Torah in a three-
year cycle. I also explain the importance of dividing the Torah into weekly
portions.
Comparing the one-year cycle to the three-year cycle
The annual cycle of Torah study was developed and practiced in ancient
Babylonia. (Generally speaking, today this area where a large and important
Jewish community existed for centuries is known as Iraq.) But a three-year
cycle was used in the ancient Land of Israel. There, the Five Books of Moses
was divided into at least 154 sections that took three years to complete. This
three-year cycle of Torah study lasted until the 12th century, when it ended
because there were too few Jews in the area to maintain the custom.
Today, some liberal congregations prefer to work on a three-year cycle. In
most cases, the three-year cycle doesn’t divide up the Torah differently from
those on an annual cycle but rather a smaller part of the weekly portion is
publicly read. So every three years it can be said that the entire Torah from
beginning to end was available to be heard publicly. Because liberal congre-
gations tend to have synagogue services that are shorter than those of more
traditional congregations, one way to shorten the length of the service is by
shortening the public Torah reading.
There are at least two ways to determine the custom of a congregation today.
One is simply to ask the rabbi. The other is pay close attention during the
Torah reading and follow along to find out whether the whole weekly portion
is being read. During the synagogue service, each person has a copy of the
text of the Five Books of Moses in book form called a chumash (khoo-mahsh).
Someone announces the portion of the week and its location in the text. If
you’re following the reading in your personal copy and notice that only a part
of the portion is read, the congregation is almost surely on a three-year cycle.
211
Chapter 13: Walking through the Torah Synagogue Service

Dividing the Torah into 54 sections
The Torah is divided into five separate parts known as the Five Books of Moses
(I discuss these books in Part II). All five books taken together are divided into
54 smaller units. Because there are 52 weeks in a year and sometimes the annual
calendar has a slightly different number of Saturdays, there are times when 2 of
the 54 portions are studied in the same week so that the entire text can be
completed in one annual cycle.
The annual cycle ends and begins on the Jewish holy day of Simchat Torah
(sim-kaht toe-rah) each fall (see Chapter 11 for more about this day). On that
day, the last verses of the fifth book of the Five Books of Moses (Deuteronomy)
are read publicly, followed by the first verses of the first book of the Five
Books of Moses (Genesis.)
Each Torah portion has a name generally taken from the first few words of the
Torah portion itself. For example, the first Torah portion is known as Parashat
Bereshit (pahr-ah-shat bah-ray-sheet; In the beginning) and is about the creation
of the world. The second Torah portion is called Parashat Noakh (pahr-ah-shat
noh-akh; Noah) and contains the story of Noah and the Flood. The term
“parashat” means “portion.” (See Chapter 3 for a complete list of Torah
portions and their corresponding verses.)
Connecting with others by reading the same section at the same time
One factor that contributes to the special experience of attending a public
reading of the Torah on Shabbat is the knowledge that people all around the
world who also attend public Torah readings are focusing their attention on
the very same section of the Torah on the same day. People say that the strong
emotional element of this custom has surely served the Jewish people well.
Throughout the centuries, the shared focus on a life based on the Torah has
been largely responsible for the sustained sense of family among Jewish people
throughout the world. The Jewish people aren’t a religion, nation, or race; the
Jewish people are a family. The whole Jewish family, from biblical times to the
present, has focused on the Torah, and for centuries the Jewish community
has sustained a system whereby Jews throughout the world are, in a sense,
all on the same page at the same time.
Preparing for the Torah Service
The Torah contains the sacred words of God and is God’s representative in the
world. I compare preparing to be in a room with a Torah scroll to preparing to
be in a room in which a king is about to enter. In fact, in Jewish tradition, God is
sometimes referred to as melekh malkhay ha’melakhim (meh-lekh mahl-khay
ha-mehl-lah-kheem), which means “the King of King of Kings.” If the king of a
kingdom were about to arrive, it would seem appropriate for a minimum
212
Part IV: The Importance of the Torah in Judaism 

number of people to be present in order to show the king respect. And one
always stands in the presence of a king. So it is with the Torah, as you find out
in the following sections.
Having a quorum of ten
In the synagogue, you just don’t grab a Torah scroll and read it. First of all, a
Torah scroll in a synagogue is only read when a minyan (min-yahn; quorum)
of ten individuals is present. Traditionally, the minyan must consist of ten
males who have reached age 13, the age of Bar Mitzvah, the coming-of-age
ceremony in Judaism. In recent decades, liberal synagogues throughout the
United States have included women in that quorum.
Why is a quorum of ten necessary to read a Torah scroll? It’s an ancient
Jewish belief that when ten souls come together in one place to worship or to
study the Torah, the presence of God is more keenly felt. This special cate-
gory of God’s presence is called the Shekhinah (sheh-khee-nah).
What happens if in a traditional synagogue there are fewer than ten men pre-
sent when a prayer service is about to begin? It’s common in Jewish neigh-
borhoods for someone to go outside of the synagogue to see if there are men
around who would be willing to join the prayer group in order to establish
the minyan. In the synagogue of my hometown, there were occasions when
someone actually telephoned local Jews asking them if they could come by to
complete the quorum.
If nine men are present and no tenth man can be found, in such cases it’s
permissible to do one of two things:
 Ask a boy in the congregation to touch a dressed Torah scroll (see more
on dressing and undressing a Torah later in this chapter) or hold a
Torah text that’s printed in book form.
 Open the holy closet where the Torah scrolls are kept as a symbolic way
of completing the minyan. Ordinarily, this holy closet is closed during the
reading of the Torah. (I describe this holy closet later in this chapter.)
If fewer than nine men are present but no more can be located to complete
the minyan, there’s no solution. And without a quorum, the Torah simply
can’t be read.
213
Chapter 13: Walking through the Torah Synagogue Service

Showing respect by standing
According to Jewish law, it’s permissible to sit on a seat or chair while the
Torah is publicly read, but in some synagogues it’s customary to stand during
the entire public reading of the Torah (which can take 30 to 45 minutes on a
Shabbat morning).
Standing during the reading of a Torah scroll is a gesture of respect both for
the Torah and for God. But standing also transforms the Torah service into
an even more special experience. Personally, standing for the reading of the
Torah has always been my habit. In fact, I prefer to stand during the syna-
gogue service throughout the entire public reading of the Torah. The experi-
ence of standing before a Torah scroll while it’s being read often prompts me
to feel what so many others have felt throughout the centuries: that I am
standing at Mount Sinai and listening to the Word of God.
The general rule of thumb is to stand when the Torah is present — that is,
from the moment the Torah scroll is taken from its holy closet (see the fol-
lowing section) until it is put back. Some people feel that it’s appropriate to
sit while the Torah scroll is lying on the table from where it’s read. But even
with this more relaxed custom, as soon as someone picks up the Torah scroll,
it’s time to stand again.
Taking the Torah Scroll
from Its Holy Closet
A synagogue’s Torah scrolls are stored in a special place in the sanctuary.
The Jewish people consider the Torah scroll the most sacred object in the
world and not to be compared to any other object, but it’s useful to think of
the Torah’s storage place as a fancy china closet in your grandmother’s home
that contains some beautiful heirloom dishes that your family rarely uses —
and only on special occasions. Imagine, for example, a special set of dishes
that has been in your family for generations. They’re stored carefully and
taken out of their storage place gently. Using them inspires deep, emotional
feelings. That’s how it is with the synagogue’s Torah scrolls.
Facing the Ark and Jerusalem
Sacred Torah scrolls are kept in the synagogue sanctuary, which is the room
for prayer. The impressive and beautifully decorated holy closet known as
the Aron HaKodesh (ah-rohn ha-koh-desh) in which Torah scrolls are kept
(most synagogues have more than one Torah scroll) is located in the most
honored position in that sacred space. The Aron HaKodesh, which is also
214
Part IV: The Importance of the Torah in Judaism 

referred to simply as the Aron (ah-rohn; Ark), dominates the synagogue sanctu-
ary, and all seats face it. You can see the layout of a typical synagogue
sanctuary in Figure 13-1.
During the prayer service, people who pray according to Jewish custom face
the holy city of Jerusalem, which has been a focal point of Jewish history
since the time of Moses. In Jewish sanctuaries throughout the world, the
Aron HaKodesh is situated so that an individual facing it also faces the Holy
Land in general and Jerusalem in particular. For example, in the Western
Hemisphere, you look east when facing the Ark in your local Jewish house of
prayer; on the other side of the world, the Ark faces in the opposite direction.
Opening the doors
An Aron HaKodesh typically has two doors. In front of the doors is a decorative
curtain called a parochet (pah-row-khet), which is reminiscent of the curtain
that was on the original Ark of the Covenant. During the Torah service, it’s
generally the custom to give an honor to an individual by asking him (or her,
in liberal synagogues) to move the parochet to the side and to open each of
the two doors (sometimes it’s one sliding door) at the beginning of the Torah
service. A congregation usually appoints one person whose responsibility it

Chapter 13: Walking through the Torah Synagogue Service

is to give out the various honors. In order to make appropriate selections for
honors, this individual is usually well-informed about the members of the
congregation and the guests who are present at each Torah service.
Any of the following people may receive the honor of opening the Aron
HaKodesh:
 An honored guest in the synagogue that week
 A member of the congregation who was ill and absent for a period of
time but has returned to services
 A person celebrating a special occasion like a birthday, anniversary, and
so on
 A person who is in the synagogue to recite a special prayer marking the
anniversary of the death of a loved one
 A person who has made a financial donation to the synagogue and is
given an honor as thanks for the gift
Retrieving the scroll and closing the doors
After the doors of the Aron are opened, usually someone else approaches
and takes the Torah scroll out. (This role is also considered an honor.) At this
stage, the Torah scroll is beautifully dressed in all its detail (I discuss the
dressing and undressing of the scroll later in this chapter).
When the Torah is removed from the Aron HaKodesh, the congregation sings
lines from the classic Kabbalistic text, the Zohar, and then recites additional
prayers and songs. (I go into detail about the Zohar in Chapter 3.)
The individual who takes the Torah out of the Aron HaKodesh hands it off to
the chazzan (khah-zahn; cantor). The chazzan receives the Torah scroll and
holds it in his right arm in a way best described as a hug or embrace.
The Aron HaKodesh doors are closed, and the Torah scroll is one step closer
to the time and place of its public reading. But first, it must go through a pro-
cession, which I cover in the next section.
Following the Torah Scroll Procession
During a synagogue Torah service, the appearance of the Torah scroll outside
of the Ark is an emotional moment. Participants stand in awe as the beautifully
wrapped Torah scroll makes an appearance in the community during a
216
Part IV: The Importance of the Torah in Judaism 

processional. After all, the Torah scroll is a precise copy of the ancient scrolls
believed to be traceable back to Moses, who received the teachings
contained in the Torah from God.
The Torah is a beautiful and sacred object and is so much at the core of
Judaism that its presence in the sanctuary as the processional winds its way
through the people brings a mood of awe — both of the holiness of the Torah
scroll and its awesome contents. In the following sections, I describe the
phases of this amazing processional.
Moving through the synagogue sanctuary
The person carrying the Torah is usually the chazzan, but it can be the rabbi
of the congregation or others. Behind him are other honored individuals who
follow as the Torah is carried through the sanctuary and among those present.
This processional group may include the rabbi, the chazzan, the leadership of
the synagogue, and the individual(s) who received the honor of opening the
Ark (see the earlier section “Opening the doors” for more information). The
group also may include a young person celebrating a Bar or Bat Mitzvah.
The congregation remains standing and watches the Torah as it makes the
rounds. There’s no set path for the processional; the winding line of people
often goes up and down the aisles of the synagogue sanctuary or uses some
other path. The goal is to bring the Torah scroll as close to as many people
present as possible so that they have an opportunity to actually kiss the Torah.
Kissing the Torah as the
procession passes by
The affection and connection experienced by participants in the Torah service
is outwardly expressed by kissing the dressed Torah as the processional passes
by. The leader of the processional has the right to stop at any time, but gener-
ally the processional moves slowly and people kiss the Torah as it passes by.
Sometimes the processional passes by too quickly for some to make actual
physical contact with the Torah. When this happens to me, I simply throw a
kiss in the Torah’s direction.
In synagogues today, the kissing takes various forms but always involves the
mantle covering the Torah. (I describe the mantle in more detail in the later
section “Undressing the Torah Scroll.”)
217
Chapter 13: Walking through the Torah Synagogue Service

 Some people touch the mantle covering the Torah and then kiss their
hands.
 Others kiss their hands and then touch the Torah’s mantle.
 Some people don’t use their hands but rather hold a prayer book or the
end of a prayer shawl and touch it to the Torah mantle as it passes by in
the processional. Then they kiss the book or shawl.
 Some kiss the Torah mantle with their lips if they get close enough to the
Torah scroll as it passes by.
There’s no fixed rule on how to kiss the Torah. The method is one of personal
preference and custom.
Regular participants in Torah services confirm that in no way is the proces-
sional a form of idolatry. Although physical, even kissing the Torah as it
passes by doesn’t imply that the Torah scroll is treated like a god. Students of
the Torah know that God is beyond all form. The great honor and respect
that the Torah scroll receives is really aimed at the Infinite One.
Reaching the reading platform
The processional accompanies the Torah scroll to its reading platform,
known as a bimah (bee-mah). Once the Torah arrives at the bimah, members
of the processional return to their places in the sanctuary.
When the person holding the Torah during the processional places the Torah
scroll on the bimah, a ba’al koray (bah-ahl koe-ray; master of the reading), an
individual in the community who is skilled at publicly reading the Torah,
approaches along with at least one or two others who stand at the sides of
the reading stand. These people are assigned the task of making sure the
reader makes no mistakes. The gabbai (gah-bye; attendant), whose job it is to
invite and announce each honoree who blesses the Torah, also stands at the
bimah. (I describe all these folks in more detail later in this chapter.)
Undressing the Torah Scroll
You can find this verse in the Torah: “This is my God and I will adorn Him”
(Exodus 15:2). Over 2,000 years ago, the Jewish sages interpreted this verse
as meaning that all Jewish ritual objects should be made as beautiful as pos-
sible. The concept is known in Hebrew as hiddur mitzvah (hih-door mitz-vah;
beautiful commandment). The sages wrote, “Adorn yourself before Him in the
fulfillment of the commandment. Make a beautiful Torah scroll . . . and wrap it
with beautiful silk” (Talmud: Tractate Shabbat. 133b).
218
Part IV: The Importance of the Torah in Judaism 

Torah scrolls are beautifully dressed. The “dress” of the Torah is based on
special clothing and ornaments worn by the High Priest in the holy temple in
Jerusalem. During a synagogue service, when the dressed Torah scroll
arrives at the bimah, it must be undressed; this is done with an attitude of
reverence and formality. There are no special words sung during this
undressing. Usually a gabbai carefully and reverently removes each of the fol-
lowing items (as shown in Figure 13-2) and sets them aside except for the yad
(the pointer), which is used during the Torah reading:
 Keter Torah: Synagogues that can afford it dress the Torah with a very
fancy crown, often made of silver or even gold, on top of the scroll. A
Torah crown is known as Keter Torah (keh-tehr toe-rah); in Hebrew, “keter”
means “crown.”
 Rimmonim: Ornamental items called rimmonim (rih-moe-neem;
pomegranates) are frequently hung over the wooden poles of the scroll,
which are called the etz chayyim (aytz khah-yeem; the Tree of Life).
Shaped like pomegranates with bells attached, the rimmonim usually are
made of silver or some other precious metal.
 Yad: Ancient Jewish tradition forbids people from touching the actual
Torah scroll with bare hands, so the Torah reader uses a ritual object
known as a yad (yahd; hand) to point to each word as he pronounces it
out loud. The yad is a small pointer, usually made of metal or wood,
that’s often ornate and at the end of which is the shape of a pointing
hand. A yad generally has a chain attached to it, and it’s hung on the
mantle or around one of the wooden poles of the Torah scroll.
 Tas: A decorative breastplate called a tas (tahs; shield) hangs from the
Torah poles. The use of a tas to decorate the Torah began in the 16th
century and recalls the breastplate worn by the High Priest of the Temple.
Today, the tas usually is made of silver and is decorated with intricate
carvings that may include biblical scenes, two twin columns recalling the
ancient Temple, floral designs, lions, and other ornate shapes and images.
 M’eel: A wound and tied scroll is dressed in a cylindrical mantle known
as a m’eel (meh-eel; robe or mantle) that’s constructed out of fabric
(most typically plush velvet).
 Wimpel: A band of cloth known as a wimpel (whim-pull; cloth) holds
together the tightly wrapped Torah scroll.
219
Chapter 13: Walking through the Torah Synagogue Service

Receiving the Honor of Blessing
the Holy Words
Each weekly Torah portion read publicly on Shabbat is divided into seven
sections, which allows for seven individuals to receive the great honor of
being called to the bimah and to stand before the Torah scroll as it is read.
It’s one of the most coveted honors in all Jewish life, and the choreography of
participating in this highly valued honor has developed with precision over
the centuries. An additional honor called the maftir (mahf-teer) adds an
eighth honor. On Shabbat morning, the maftir is a repetition of the last sev-
eral lines of the Torah portion. The person who recites these lines often also
recites a portion from the books of the Prophets. This prophetic reading is
called a haftarah (hahf-tah-rah).

Part IV: The Importance of the Torah in Judaism 

Understanding who can be called
To understand the way in which the eight people are called to the Torah on
Shabbat, you need some background. Throughout the centuries, Jews have
known, genealogically, which of the following they descend from:
 Kohanim (co-ha-neem), the priests of the Temple in Jerusalem
 Leviim (leh-vee-eem), the tribe who didn’t have land in ancient Israel
but were assigned the task of helping in the Temple, mostly singing
during the Temple service
A Jewish person who isn’t a descendant of the priests or the helpers is in a
third general category called Yisroel (yis-roe-ale; Israel).
With this breakdown in mind, the Jewish sages decided many centuries ago
that the first honor of blessing the Torah should go to a Kohan, the second to
a Levi, and the rest to anyone else. If no Kohan is present, the first honor
goes to a Levi. If both are absent, anyone qualified (meaning a male adult in
traditional congregations and a male or female adult in liberal congregations)
may be called to bless the Torah.
Announcing the honorees’ names
Most synagogues have a gabbai (gah-bye; attendant), a layperson who is
assigned a variety of tasks in the synagogue. These tasks may include
 Choosing or identifying people to receive the honor of reciting a blessing
over the Torah reading
 Undressing and dressing the Torah
 Reading from the Torah
 Standing next to the person who is reading from the Torah in order to
check pronunciation and correct any mistakes in the reading
One doesn’t approach the Torah without receiving an invitation to do so, and
the gabbai issues that invitation. Although there are many customs for how
this is done and what the gabbai says, the invitation generally takes the form
of an announcement of the person’s name in Hebrew. (See the sidebar “What’s
in a Hebrew name?” for more information about Hebrew names.)
The invitation to come before the Torah is never a surprise. Usually some-
time during the early part of the synagogue service, the gabbai approaches
each of the seven individuals who are to be called so that they’re ready to
receive the honor. After the gabbai calls your name, it’s customary to go to
the bimah quickly and with enthusiasm, using the shortest path from your
seat to the bimah.
221
Chapter 13: Walking through the Torah Synagogue Service

Ascending to the Torah
The honor of being called to stand before the Torah during its public reading
is known in Hebrew as aliyah la-Torah (ah-lee-yah leh-toe-rah; ascending to
the Torah). The reference to “ascending” has two meanings.
 On a literal level, the person called to the bimah is going up to a raised
platform, so the act involves an actual physical ascent.
 On a more sublime level, the person called to the Torah is participating
in a spiritual ascent, an ascent to see and hear the word of God.
When standing before an open Torah scroll, those who know the significance
of the Torah usually experience an amazing and unique sensation. The
ancient calligraphy, written precisely as it has been written for centuries,
seems to jump off the parchment and reverberate with holiness.
In traditional synagogues and as custom has dictated for centuries, only men
are called to the Torah. Today, in liberal synagogues where women are counted
in the minyan (quorum), women are also given the honor of participating fully
in the Torah service, including the reciting of the blessings. In addition, in liberal
222
Part IV: The Importance of the Torah in Judaism 
What’s in a Hebrew name?
Most Jews have Hebrew names, most often
taken from deceased family members (in the
German and Eastern European custom) or living
relatives (in the Spanish, Portuguese, North
African, and Middle Eastern custom). Sometimes
one’s Hebrew name comes from that of a
revered person, such as a great rabbi, whom
parents want to honor.
Names are extremely important in Jewish tra-
dition, and Jewish parents usually take great
care and deliberation in making this decision.
It’s believed that if a Jewish person doesn’t like
his or her Hebrew name, the parents may have
made an error and given the wrong name. In
such cases, it’s important that the person find
his or her “true” name. This idea is based on the
belief that every Jewish person has a Hebrew
name designated by God. When parents think
they’re deciding what to name their children,
they’re really being inspired by a holy spirit. If the
parents aren’t in tune with this spirit or con-
sciously avoid the divine inspiration, the baby
doesn’t get his or her proper name. Hebrew
names for both males and females include the
name of one’s father, and some people also
include one’s mother’s name.
Here’s how my name breaks down: My secular
name is Arthur Kurzweil, but my Hebrew name,
which the gabbai at my synagogue uses to call
me to the Torah, is Avraham Abba ben Chaim
Shaul.
 Avraham Abba was one of my great
grandfathers.
 The word “ben” means “son of.”
 Chaim Shaul is my father’s first name.

communities, when the patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are mentioned,
the four matriarchs of Judaism, Sarah, Rebecca, Rachel, and Leah, are also
included.
Blessing the Torah before and after
each part of the reading
In the biblical book of the prophet Nehemiah, Ezra the Scribe blessed God
before he read publicly from the Torah. The blessing recited in synagogues
today is referred to in the Talmud as the most supreme of all blessings. (Head
to Chapter 3 for more information about the Talmud.)
When the individual who is called to bless the Torah arrives before the open
Torah scroll, the gabbai or the person reading the Torah uses the yad to point
to the word that will begin the reading (I describe the yad in the earlier section
“Undressing the Torah Scroll”). The honoree touches his tallit (tah-leet; prayer
shawl) to the scroll in the place where the reader will begin and then kisses the
tallit. (Remember that one’s hands never touch the parchment directly; this is
forbidden by Jewish law.) The honoree then recites:
Blessed be the Lord who is blessed.
The congregation responds:
Blessed be the Lord who is blessed for all eternity.
The honoree repeats:
Blessed be the Lord who is blessed for all eternity.
The honoree then says:
Blessed are You, Lord our God, King of the universe, who has chosen us
from among all the nations and given us His holy Torah. Blessed are you, O
Lord, who gives the Torah.
After the section of the Torah has been read (I discuss the actual Torah reading
later in this chapter), the honoree once again touches the Torah with his tallit,
kisses it, and recites this concluding blessing:
Blessed are You, Lord our God, King of the universe, who has given us the
Torah of truth and planted eternal life within us. Blessed are You Lord, who
gives the Torah.
223
Chapter 13: Walking through the Torah Synagogue Service

After the first honoree finishes his concluding blessing, he steps aside and
the next honoree is called. It’s generally the custom for an honoree to stay
on the bimah while the next honoree recites the blessings and the next section
of the Torah portion is read; then the previous honoree goes back to his place
in the congregation.
Reciting a healing prayer
Customs vary from synagogue to synagogue, but within every Torah-reading
service on Shabbat is the recitation of a special prayer for healing. In some
congregations, the gabbai recites the prayer seven times, after each of the
seven honorees ascend and recite their Torah blessings. In other synagogues,
the gabbai recites the prayer once, intending to include all seven honorees as
well as all others in need of healing.
The prayer is known as Mi Sheberakh (mee sheh-bay-rakh; the One who
blessed). There are various forms of this prayer. Here is one popular example:
He who blessed our forefathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob — may He bless
[the person’s Hebrew name] because he has come to the Torah in honor of
the Omnipresent, in honor of the Torah. As a reward for this, may the Holy
One, Blessed is He protect him and rescue him from every trouble and
distress, from every plague and illness; and may He send blessing and
success in his every endeavor together with all Israel, his brethren. Now let
us respond: Amen.
224
Part IV: The Importance of the Torah in Judaism 
Delving deeper into the blessing of the Torah
Two aspects of the honoree’s blessing over the
Torah prompt a little clarification:
 The reference to the chosen people: The
concept of the chosen people has
absolutely nothing to do with any assumed
superiority. Judaism doesn’t teach that
Jews are better than others; rather, the
label refers to added requirements and
obligations imposed by God upon the
Jewish people. As “priests among the
nations” (as the Torah states), Jews have
the task of relating to the world as though
it’s sacred and every detail can be raised to
holiness.
 The use of present tense: It’s noteworthy
that the blessing is in the present tense, as
in “who gives the Torah.” Present tense is
used because, according to the teachings
of Judaism, God is constantly giving the
Torah to the world and new understandings
are happening all the time.

The Big Event: Reading 
the Torah Out Loud
When the moment arrives for the Torah to be read out loud, there’s absolute
silence in the sanctuary. Talking and even whispering to a neighbor are
forbidden, and failure to obey this custom is considered the utmost disrespect
to the Torah and to God. At this point, everyone in the congregation has a
copy of the Five Books of Moses in book form in front of them, open to the
page for the current week’s Torah portion. There’s an air of great anticipation
throughout the sanctuary because the high point of the service has arrived.
Qualifying as “the master of the reading”
According to Jewish tradition, if you’re called to the Torah during the Torah
service, it is to recite the proper blessings. But technically, you can recite
the blessings and read from the Torah. Unfortunately, in most congregations the
majority of those present aren’t qualified to read. In order to read from the Torah
scroll, a person must
 Be able to read Hebrew without any vowels or punctuation, because
ancient Hebrew has only consonants and no commas or periods
 Be able to read from the Torah in a specific style of chanting known as trop
(trup) used exclusively for public Torah readings
 Understand what he’s reading
 Be able to identify where each of the seven sections of each week’s
Torah portion begins and ends
 Know how to pronounce words with various spellings, because one
word may be spelled in different ways in different parts of the Torah
Most congregations have at least one Hebrew expert in their midst. He may be
the rabbi of the congregation or may even be a knowledgeable person hired
by the congregation to read from the Torah scroll. Regardless of his background,
this person is called the ba’al koray (bah-ahl koh-ray; the master of the reading).
Looking at every word — no memorizing!
According to the Jewish law, the ba’al koray (Torah reader) must look at the
words while reading. Even if he has the text memorized, he must look at
every word as he pronounces it. This rule is based on a verse from the Torah
225
Chapter 13: Walking through the Torah Synagogue Service

itself: “You shall not add to the word which I am commanding you, nor take
away from it, that you may keep the commandments of the Lord your God
which I command you” (Deuteronomy 4:2).
By looking carefully at the text as he reads a particular portion of the Torah,
the ba’al koray is less likely to add or subtract from the text. In addition, in
order for a Torah scroll to be considered acceptable for public reading, it
must be letter-perfect (see Chapter 14 for more details). The reader who
looks at each word is in a good position to detect errors.
More than once in my life, I’ve been in a Torah service when the reader sud-
denly sees a mistake in the text. When this happens, the Torah reading is
stopped and another Torah scroll is taken out of the Aron HaKodesh. The
ba’al koray continues the reading with the replacement scroll.
Pronouncing every word correctly
It’s not unusual for people in a congregation to call out loud when the Torah
reader makes an error in pronunciation. And pronunciation errors aren’t
uncommon given that there aren’t any vowels in the Torah.
To use an example from English, assume that a sentence reads, “Th ct st n th
flr.” With the correct vowels, the sentence is “The cat sat on the floor.” But
the word “st” may also be pronounced “sit” or “set.” Of course, from the con-
text of the other words, interpreting “st” as “sat” makes the most sense. The
absence of vowels is why the Torah reader needs to be knowledgeable.
Nevertheless, even the most well-informed Torah reader can make a mistake
from time to time. When someone realizes the error and shouts out a correction,
the reader isn’t insulted. On the contrary, the serious ba’al koray is far more
devoted to reading the Torah correctly than to proving that he’s perfect.
It’s customary for every synagogue to have at least one person standing at
the side of the bimah, next to the Torah reader, following along in a printed
version of the Torah that has vowels and punctuation. This person may be
the gabbai (see the earlier section “Announcing the honorees’ names” for
more on the gabbai) or someone else who’s qualified and asked to take on
this responsibility. Sometimes both the gabbai and an additional person par-
ticipate in carefully following along with the reading. These people can help
the reader quietly if he makes any errors.
Concluding the Torah Service
So seven or eight people have blessed each piece of the Torah reading for the
week, and you’ve enjoyed a flawless reading by the reader. What happens next?
226
Part IV: The Importance of the Torah in Judaism 

A Torah service concludes with lifting the Torah for everyone to see, dressing
it, walking through another procession, and returning it to its rightful place in
the Ark.
Lifting the Torah for all to see
The Talmud contains a record of an ancient custom of raising the Torah scroll
after the reading and showing it to all of those present (see Chapter 3 for more
about the Talmud). A new honoree who’s strong enough to lift the Torah scroll
(which is often quite heavy) grasps each of the two poles, picks up the Torah,
and turns it so that at least three columns of the parchment text are visible to
the congregation. It’s the duty of each member of the congregation to stand
and look at the scroll with great affection and devotion. The honor of lifting the
Torah in this way and at this time is known as hagbahah (hahg-bah-ah; lifting);
see Figure 13-3.
After the lifting and display of the Torah scroll, another new honoree performs
what is known as gelilah (geh-lee-lah; rolling), when the Torah is dressed.
Figure 13-3:

227
Chapter 13: Walking through the Torah Synagogue Service

Dressing the Torah
Dressing the Torah is the reverse process of undressing it, which I discuss earlier
in this chapter. It’s usually done by the same person who did the undressing.
1. The scrolls are rolled up and tightened at the place where the week’s
portion ends so that the scroll is ready for the continuation of the reading
the next week.
2. The wimple is wrapped around the scroll to further tighten it, and it’s
tied securely.
3. The mantle is placed on the scrolls, followed by the breastplate, the
crown, and the rimmonim. The yad, which usually has a looped chain on
its handle, is placed over one of the poles of the Torah scroll.
When it’s fully dressed, the Torah scroll is ready to be returned to the Aron
HaKodesh.
Going through another procession
(and more kissing!)
Just as there’s a procession when the Torah scroll is taken out of the Aron
HaKodesh (which I describe earlier in this chapter), a similar procession
takes place before the scroll is returned to the Aron. The gabbai or the person
who read from the Torah holds the scroll in his right arm and is followed by the
rabbi and honored individuals. (These honored individuals include the two
people who lifted and dressed the Torah scroll.) The procession winds its way
around the sanctuary, again giving everyone an opportunity to kiss the dressed
Torah scroll.
Returning the Torah to the Ark
Generally, the honored person who originally took the Torah out of the Aron
HaKodesh (as I describe earlier in this chapter) waits in front of the Aron to
physically return the scroll back to its place. After that, the doors of the Aron
are closed, and the Shabbat prayer service continues.

 Discovering the basic rules about writing a Torah scroll
 Gathering the necessary writing supplies
 Knowing what to do when a Torah needs repair
You can count 613 commandments in the Torah when you start with 
the beginning of the first book of Moses, the book of Genesis, and work
your way through to the last words of the fifth book of Moses, the book of
Deuteronomy. (See Part II for more about all five books.) The first of these
many commandments is the divine injunction to “be fruitful and multiply” —
in other words, to have children (Genesis 1:28). The last commandment is
God’s directive that each of the Children of Israel “write down this song,”
interpreted as meaning to write a Torah scroll (Deuteronomy 31:19).
Nobody can actually perform all 613 commandments. Some are for men, and
others for women. Some can only be performed in the Holy Land, and others
are required of specific people like a priest or a king. But many Torah authori-
ties teach that everyone must write a Torah scroll. In this chapter, I explain
the reasoning behind and process of writing a Torah scroll. I also discuss the
proper care and repair of handwritten Torah scrolls.
God Said So! The Law behind
Writing a Torah Scroll
The Torah used in synagogues today is a precise document. Every letter,
every unusual spelling, and every dot is a duplication of the original Torah,
handed down from one generation to the next. The original Torah was

recorded by Moses, who’s considered in Jewish tradition to be the greatest
teacher and prophet who ever lived. Moses received the Torah from God
during his encounter on Mount Sinai. Moses didn’t author the ancient and
timeless document called the Five Books of Moses, however; Moses was
simply God’s secretary or scribe.
In the book of Exodus (see Chapter 5), the Torah explains that Moses gathered
all the people who were with him, read the scrolls he was writing as he recorded
God’s message, and taught God’s laws. When Moses read his Torah, the Children
of Israel responded in a phrase that reveals an important lesson about how to
grasp the Torah’s message: “The people all responded with one single voice. . .
they said, ‘We will do and we will hear’” (Exodus 24:7). In Hebrew, that phrase
is na’aseh v’nishmah (nah-ah-seh vuh-nish-mah).
Jewish commentaries on the Torah frequently point out that the Children of
Israel didn’t say, “We will hear and then we will do.” Rather, they said, “We
will do and we will hear,” meaning that first we will do it and only after we do
it will we really hear it. As it says in the Torah, to understand the Torah is to
experience it, to participate in it, and to do it. And only by doing the Torah do
you come to understand it from the inside.
In addition, near the very end of the Five Books of Moses in the book of
Deuteronomy (see Chapter 8), during the final speech that Moses delivered 
to the Children of Israel, Moses quotes God as saying “Therefore write down this
song and teach it to the people of Israel; put it in their mouths, in order that
this song may be My witness against the people of Israel” (Deuteronomy 31:19).
In his authoritative code of Jewish laws dealing with the writing of a Torah
scroll, the commentator Maimonides writes, “Each and every man of Israel is
commanded to write a Torah scroll for himself, as it says ‘Therefore write down
this song’ which means write a Torah scroll. . . .” Commentator Abraham Ibn
Ezra teaches that everyone who knows how to write must participate in the
activity of writing a Torah, and another Torah commentator known as the Ralbag
claims that the reason for this is “so that every person of Israel will be able to
study the Torah when he has the opportunity.” (See Chapter 16 for more about
Torah commentators.)
But not all Jewish sages agree on this point. The great Torah commentator
Nachmanides, for example, explains that this verse refers to Moses and Joshua
and means that only Moses and Joshua were instructed to write a Torah. In
addition, Rav Sa’adiah Gaon, a revered sage who lived around the year 900 and
was the leading Torah authority in his generation, doesn’t include writing 
a Torah scroll among his list of the 613 commandments. Despite some
disagreement, all the other early authorities list this commandment as 
the last of the 613, and this is the law.
230
Part IV: The Importance of the Torah in Judaism 

Decisions, Decisions: Hiring a Scribe
versus Completing a Torah Yourself
According to Jewish law, even if you inherit a Torah scroll from your father or
mother, you’re still commanded to write one for yourself. But obviously not
everyone is qualified to do so. Writing a Torah scroll carries many requirements
and also involves quite a bit of artistic skill and talent (see the later section
“Understanding the Ground Rules of Torah Writing” for more information).
Therefore, it has become a custom among Jews to hire a qualified scribe to
write a Torah in order to fulfill this commandment. However, it’s still possible to
fulfill the commandment without hiring a professional Torah writer. I explain
both options in the following sections.
Hiring a professional
Writing a Torah is a specialized skill. A person trained and qualified to write a
Torah scroll is known as a sofer (sow-fair; scribe). A sofer must be a spiritual
person observant in the laws and customs of Judaism and especially knowl-
edgeable in the laws governing the proper writing of a scroll. Believe it or not,
a sofer needs to know more than 4,000 laws in order to be qualified to write a
Torah scroll! For example, there are ten laws just concerning the writing of the
first letter of the Hebrew alphabet, the aleph.
231
Chapter 14: The Final Commandment: Writing a Torah Scroll
A dispute about the first Torah scroll
The Talmud (see Chapter 3) contains a well-
known disagreement between two famous
sages in the rabbinic period (70 to 500 CE), Rabbi
Yochanan and Resh Lakish. Rabbi Yochanan
was of the opinion that the Torah was given
scroll by scroll. However his friend and frequent
Torah study partner, Resh Lakish, insisted that
the Torah was given in one piece. Then another
sage, Rabbi Levi, taught that many lines from
Leviticus and Numbers were written before the
rest of the Torah. Rashi, the great Bible and
Talmud commentator, writes that Resh Lakish
didn’t mean that the whole Torah was literally
given all at once on Mount Sinai; rather, he was
implying that Moses wrote down each passage
as God told it to him. During the 40 years of wan-
dering in the desert, Moses compiled these pas-
sages and sewed them all together into one
document.

Tradition suggests that scribes be right-handed, although it’s surely not
forbidden for a left-handed person who’s highly skilled and qualified to be a
Torah scribe. The recommendation simply comes from the fact that Jewish
tradition is partial to the right side, which is considered to be the side of
expansiveness and love whereas the left side is the side of restraint and justice.
If you want to become a Torah scribe, this is usually achieved by becoming
an apprentice to someone who is a master of the art and who is completely
versed in the thousands of laws pertaining to the writing of a Torah scroll.
You don’t need to be a rabbi or have a certain degree from a school. But
tradition requires that, in addition to all the required technical knowledge
and artistic talent, you must be a pious person, observant of Torah law,
honest, ethical, and faithful.
To fulfill the commandment to write a Torah scroll, you don’t usually hire one
person by yourself. Most often a synagogue will arrange to buy a Torah from
a qualified scribe or his agent, and members of the congregation participate by
sharing the expenses (see the next section). Regardless of the scribe’s reputation,
nothing replaces examining the Torah itself, and this must be done by someone
who knows what he’s looking for. Some questions asked include:
 Is the writing beautiful?
 Is the writing legible?
 Is the writing the same throughout? (Sometimes a scribe will have other
scribes do parts of the scroll and then have them sewn together. While
this is acceptable, it isn’t always preferred.)
 Is the parchment clean?
Writing your own Torah
The tradition has evolved that one need not write an entire Torah; it’s enough
to simply “complete” a Torah scroll. And writing just one letter is thought to
actually complete the Torah scroll and fulfill this commandment. This point
is codified in the Talmud: “One who corrects even a single letter in a Torah
scroll is like one who has written the entire scroll.”
So how do you go about completing a Torah scroll in this manner? Here’s a
common example: When a synagogue purchases a new Torah scroll, the event
often is used as a fundraiser. The synagogue announces to the congregation
that a Torah scroll is being purchased and then organizes a fundraising effort
by selling letters or words to be written to the members of the congregation.
In this way, funds are raised to purchase the Torah scroll and everyone who’s
interested gets the opportunity to participate in its writing.
232
Part IV: The Importance of the Torah in Judaism 

Here’s a bit more about how this process of Torah writing often works: The
synagogue purchases an unfinished Torah; often the parts left out include
well-known passages like the Ten Commandments or famous prayers and sto-
ries. Members of the congregation donate money in order to have the honor
of writing these letters or words. A skilled scribe is called in for the occasion,
and each donor holds the pen with the scribe as the scribe does the writing.
It’s only symbolic, but the participants truly feel and know that they’re
involved in the completion of a 100 percent kosher Torah.
If you aren’t able to participate in the purchasing or writing of a Torah scroll,
there is, according to many authorities, another way to fulfill this commandment:
by simply purchasing books that teach about the Torah and its wisdom.
Purchasing this book, The Torah For Dummies, can actually be considered a
way of fulfilling the commandment of writing a Torah.
Understanding the Ground
Rules of Torah Writing
A scribe must adhere to many rules, regulations, and guidelines in writing a
Torah; the following sections provide an overview of the general rules
entailed in the writing of a Torah.
Undergo a ritual bath before beginning
A mikvah (mihk-vah) is a pool of water constructed from exact specifications
according to Jewish tradition that’s used ritually for many reasons in Jewish life.
(You can see a mikvah in Figure 14-1). When you go to a mikvah, an essential
part of the ritual is being completely covered with water. Immersion in a mikvah
is considered to be a symbolic spiritual cleansing. It’s an unfortunate myth that
entering a mikvah has anything to do with physical impurity or being dirty
because the ritual is purely spiritual.
233
Chapter 14: The Final Commandment: Writing a Torah Scroll

Scribes who write Torah scrolls visit mikvahs for immersion. Some immerse
themselves when they begin a new Torah whereas others go at the beginning
of each day while they’re working on a Torah. I’ve even heard of scribes who
immerse themselves in a mikvah before writing God’s name each time. For
practical purposes, they usually leave spaces where the names of God appear
in the text, visit the mikvah, and then fill in those names.
Test a pen by writing the name 
of the ultimate villain
The quintessential enemy of the Jewish people is the biblical figure Amalek, who
attacked the children of Israel from behind as they left Egypt. The Torah states,
Remember what Amalek did to you along the way when you came out from
Egypt, how he met you along the way and attacked among you all the
stragglers at your rear when you were faint and weary; and he did not fear
God. Therefore it shall come about when the Lord your God has given you
rest from all your surrounding enemies, in the land which the Lord your God
gives you as an inheritance to possess, you shall blot out the memory of
Amalek from under heaven; you must not forget.
Deuteronomy 25:17–19
Figure 14-1:

scroll.
234
Part IV: The Importance of the Torah in Judaism 

While it’s paradoxical that the Torah says both to blot out Amalek’s name and
to remember him, this idea is reflected in the way Torah scribes begin the
actual writing process. In order to be sure that the ink they’re using is both
the proper color and flows properly, and that the quill pen distributes the ink
in the proper thickness, the scribe tests the pen and ink on some piece of
parchment other than the Torah scroll itself. (I discuss all these supplies later
in this chapter.)
The test is simple. Each time the scribe sits down to begin his work, he writes
the name “Amalek” on the parchment and then crosses it out a number of
times. Just like a painter preparing his or her paint on a palette, the scribe is
looking for the right color and consistency of the ink and confirmation that
it’s flowing from the pen to the parchment evenly and smoothly.
Refrain from relying on memory
No matter how many Torah scrolls a scribe has written or how familiar a scribe
is with the words of the text being written, it’s forbidden by Jewish law for 
a scribe to write any words of the Torah by memory or by dictation. Even if 
the scribe is writing a familiar verse of the Torah (or even a phrase of just a
few words), the scribe is absolutely obligated to look carefully at a previously
written Torah scroll (or an exact facsimile of a Torah scroll). He must use it as a
reference, reading each word in the text out loud before writing it down. By
working closely with a previously written copy, a scribe ensures that he has the
right attitude to write a new Torah and that the new Torah is accurate.
Having the proper attitude
Whether it’s prayer, the act of giving charity, the celebration of holy days, or
making love with one’s partner, there’s the physical aspect of the action and
the spiritual aspect. One’s private inner attitude is considered to be an
important part of every religious action. The important Jewish concept of
inner intent is called kavanah (kah-vah-nah).
Writing a Torah scroll is more than the act of copying the text. The inner atti-
tude of the scribe is an essential part of the process. A chef I know once told
me that one of the most important ingredients of a dish is the attitude of the
chef as he or she prepares it. I’ve even heard that a person can get sick if he
or she eats a dish made by a chef who had a bad attitude while cooking! So it
is with the writing of a Torah: It’s a holy act and one for which the scribe
must be able to maintain a spiritually elevated state of mind and heart.
By not relying on his memory, the scribe is more conscious of the words he’s
writing. When I was in grade school, we said the Pledge of Allegiance every
morning. I remember that it quickly became automatic, and I was able to
recite the words without even thinking about them. If the words had been
projected in the front of the classroom for me to see, I’m sure that I would
have been much more aware of what I was saying.
235
Chapter 14: The Final Commandment: Writing a Torah Scroll

Maintaining accuracy
Scribes must look at a copy of the Torah text they’re writing for a practical
reason as well. Torah scrolls must be perfect and without even the slightest
error, so looking at a copy of what he’s writing helps the scribe concentrate and
be precise. (See the later section “Avoid making an error” for more information.)
For similar reasons, it’s strictly forbidden for someone to orally dictate the
text of a Torah to a scribe. One obvious reason for this rule is that just as
there are various accents spoken in the United States — for example a
Southern accent is quite different from a New England accent — so too are
there various accents for spoken Hebrew. It would be quite easy for a scribe
to make a mistake in writing the text if he were to hear the words spoken with
a particular accent rather than read them.
For ten years I lived in the largest and most densely populated religious
Jewish neighborhood in America, Boro Park in Brooklyn, New York. In this
one neighborhood, different subgroups spoke with radically different
accents. For example, in one synagogue people said the word “baruch,”
which is the first word of every blessing, as “bahw rookh” while another
group down the street said “bahw reekh.” If a scribe were to hear these two
variations, he may write them differently, but in Torah writing, only one
would be correct. If the scribe wrote the incorrect one, the Torah would then
be imperfect, and he would have to start over again.
236
Part IV: The Importance of the Torah in Judaism 
The Torah’s vital statistics
The Torah scroll has been intricately studied
since it was received by Moses. Every letter,
every word, every space between words, and
every dot — in short, every detail — is of inter-
est to students of the Torah and the scribes who
write Torah scrolls. One way to protect and
ensure the perfection of a Torah scroll is to take
inventory of its details. Here are some such
Torah statistics:
 A Torah scroll has 187 chapters, 5,845
verses, 79,976 words, and 304,805 letters.
 The book of Genesis has 1,534 verses.
 The book of Exodus has 1,209 verses.
 The book of Leviticus has 859 verses.
 The book of Numbers has 1,288 verses.
 The book of Deuteronomy has 955 verses.
 The Hebrew alphabet has 22 letters and 5
final letters.
 The most common letter in the Torah is a
“yud,” which appears 31,530 times.
 The least common letter in the Torah is a
“tet,” which appears 1,802 times.
 The most common final letter in the Torah is
the Final “Mem,” which appears 10,623
times.
 The least common final letter in the Torah is
the Final “Feh,” which appears 834 times.
 There are 248 columns in a Torah scroll.
 Every column of the Torah scroll has 42
lines.
 Every line in the Torah scroll has about 30
letters in it.

Write every word by hand in Hebrew
Torah scrolls aren’t printed; according to Jewish law, they must be handwritten
in Hebrew.
Figure 14-2 shows the Hebrew alphabet and the English pronunciations of the
letters. The form that the letters take is known as ketav Ashuri (keh-tahv ah-
sure-ee; Assyrian writing).
Following are the three major styles of writing the Hebrew alphabet for a
Torah. They’re distinguished from each other in the same way that typefaces
are different, with slight differences in the details of how certain letters are
formed. Each synagogue selects its Torah scrolls based on the preferences of
the community:
 Beit Yosef (beyt yo-safe; the house of Joseph): This style is named after
Rabbi Joseph Karo, the 16th-century author of the Shulchan Aruch
(shool-khahn ah-rookh; the Code of Jewish Law). Rabbi Karo codified
this style of writing, which is the standard style used by most Ashkenazi
(European) Jews.
 ARI (ah-ree): The 16th-century Kabbalist Rabbi Isaac Luria was known
for the acronym of his name, ARI. For Torah writing, ARI refers to the
style of writing he instituted. This style is usually used by Chassidim and
others who follow Kabbalistic tradition.
 Sefardi (seh-far-dee; Spanish): Regarding Hebrew writing, Sefardi refers
to the style of writing used by Jews of Spanish, Portuguese, and Middle
Eastern descent.
Avoid making an error
There are 304,805 letters in a Sefer Torah (say-fehr toe-rah; the book of the
Torah). The term “Sefer Torah” is the specific way to identify a Torah scroll
as opposed to a printed and bound version of the Torah text. If even one letter
is missing or added, the Torah’s considered pasul (pah-sewl; unacceptable or
not kosher). It is interesting to note that one letter of the Torah is .000328
percent of the entire Five Books of Moses, but that’s all it takes for a Torah
scroll to be unacceptable and use of it is forbidden.
The most typical errors found in Torah scrolls are
 The omission of one or two letters that are the same and that follow
each other
 The omission of words or phrases that are repeated in a passage near
the one being written
 The writing of the same word or letter twice

A Torah scroll with an error can be repaired, of course (I discuss the repair of
scrolls later in this chapter), but until it’s repaired, it’s forbidden to read from
it publicly. In recent years, computers have helped in the task of proofreading

for many years and is assumed to be perfect.

Chapter 14: The Final Commandment: Writing a Torah Scroll

Recite a blessing every time
God’s name is written
Many names for God are included in the Torah (see Chapter 2 for a list).
When the text calls for the writing of one of God’s names, the scribe must
raise his pen before writing the last letter of the word immediately preceding
the name of God and inspect the tip of the pen to be certain that it isn’t defec-
tive. The scribe then recites the blessing, “I am now writing this Holy Name in
order to sanctify the Divine Name” and finishes writing the name.
There are about 2,000 occurrences of the various versions of God’s name in
the Torah. If a scribe makes a mistake when writing one of these names, he
isn’t allowed to erase and correct it as he is permitted to do with other words
(see the later section “Discovering errors in a Torah scroll”). Rather, the
panel of parchment is put into a genizah (geh-nee-zah; storage). Destroying
anything with God’s name on it is strictly forbidden, so sacred texts with
errors either are put into permanent storage or buried in a Jewish cemetery.
(I discuss Torah storage and burial later in this chapter.)
Using the Right Torah Writing Supplies
Every aspect of writing a Torah scroll is dictated by Jewish tradition, including
the scribe’s supplies and techniques. The writing of a Torah is like a carefully
choreographed dance.
A copy to copy
As I explain earlier in this chapter, scribes must not write a Torah (not even a
letter) from memory. Therefore, a tikkun sofer (tee-koon sow-fair) is available
to them. A tikkun sofer, sometimes just called a “tikkun,” is an exact facsimile
of a Torah scroll in book form and is designed as a guide for scribes writing a
copy of the Torah. Each and every letter must be copied directly from either
a Torah scroll that’s known to be letter-perfect or a tikkun sofer. You can see
a sample of a tikkun sofer in Figure 14-3.
Before there were printed books, a scribe had to use a perfect Torah scroll as
his guide. Today, it’s common for scribes to use the book form because it’s
simply more manageable. In addition, the scribe would rather not run the risk
of damaging or staining an actual Torah scroll by copying from it. Although a
tikkun sofer sometimes has additional information in it, such as the Torah
blessings, it’s basically and simply a facsimile of a Written Torah used by
scribes to write a new Torah scroll.

Chapter 14: The Final Commandment: Writing a Torah Scroll

Parchment (but not just 
any old parchment)
A Torah scroll may be written only on parchment from the skin of a kosher
animal. Kosher animals are those that have split hooves and chew their cud,
like cows and sheep (see Chapter 12 for more about keeping kosher). This
parchment is known as a klaf (klahf), and a sheet of it is known as a yeriah
(yeh-ree-yah; sheet). Nowadays, the skin is treated by soaking it in limewater
and other chemicals and then scraping the hair off; in ancient times (at least
2,000 years ago), the skin was soaked in barley and salt water. Regardless of
the initial preparation, when the surface no longer has hair, the scribe or
someone who’s qualified to make sacred parchment that qualifies for making
a Torah scroll stretches the skin, waits for it to dry, and then presses it flat.
The skin is then sanded until it becomes smooth and its sheets are prepared
for being written upon.
Parchment used for a Torah scroll must be prepared by a Jewish person who’s
creating the parchment expressly for use as a Torah. It’s not permissible to buy
parchment from any source. Generally, a scribe who writes a Torah also knows
how to make parchment properly. In addition to the necessity of being made
of the right materials, the parchment must be made with the proper intention.
The supplies needed to write a Torah scroll can be purchased from vendors
in Israel as well as in the United States. Because this is an extremely specialized
activity, the best way to locate these sources is to ask a qualified scribe.
Although there’s a proper way to slaughter an animal for it to be kosher and
fit for eating, the animal whose skin is used as parchment need not be slaugh-
tered in a ritually acceptable manner. As long as the animal is qualified as
kosher, the parchment can be used for a Torah scroll.
242
Part IV: The Importance of the Torah in Judaism 
The first 13 copies of the Torah
In the fifth of the Five Books of Moses, it says
that the Torah was recorded by Moses. In fact,
Moses handwrote 13 copies — not just one.
Jewish tradition teaches that when Moses
knew that he was going to die, he proceeded to
write the 13 copies. The Torah also says, “Take
this Torah, and put it by the side of the Ark of the
Covenant” (Deuteronomy 31:26). With regard to
this verse, Talmudic sage Rabbi Yannai teaches,
“He wrote out thirteen Torahs; twelve for each
of the twelve tribes, and one that he placed in
the ark, so that if anyone were to try to misrep-
resent anything, they would find it in the copy
that was in the ark.”

Parchment made of fish skin can’t be used for a Torah scroll due to its unpleas-
ant odor. Also, although parchment made from the skin of birds is permissible,
it’s impractical because it’s so thin and is liable to have holes in it.
A quill from a turkey or a goose
Quills for writing a Torah come from kosher birds, like a goose or turkey. The
turkey quill is more commonly used because the points of turkey quills last
longer than others. A scribe prepares his quill by shaving the thick end of the
feather and then slitting the end. Most traditional scribes make their own quills,
but quills are also available commercially from supply houses that sell quills and
special ink for Torahs and other sacred scrolls. There are no special rituals
regarding the quill, but as with every other aspect of writing a Torah scroll,
the proper intention is always essential.
Permanent black ink
According to Jewish tradition, only black ink is acceptable for Torah writing,
and ink of any other color is not kosher for a Torah scroll. The Talmud contains
a story describing a Torah scroll used in ancient Alexandria in which God’s name
was written in gold ink each time it appeared. The sages declared the Torah scroll
to be unusable, reasoning that the gold was reminiscent of the gold used to
make the Golden Calf (see Chapter 5 for more about this story).
According to Jewish law and tradition, the ink must also be permanent, not
erasable.
Torah scribes prepare their ink in very small quantities in order to keep it
fresh. Today, the ink used for Torahs is made from a mixture of gum arabic,
gallnut or tannic acid, copper sulfate, and water; centuries ago, Torah ink was
made from soot, honey, wax, gum, gallnut, and water.
A Little TLC: Proper Torah
Care, Repair, and Burial
All sacred Jewish texts that contain God’s name, including Torah scrolls,
receive special treatment. If a Torah scroll is disqualified for use for one
reason or another, it’s not thrown away (God forbid!) but is repaired, placed
in a genizah, or buried properly in a Jewish cemetery.
243
Chapter 14: The Final Commandment: Writing a Torah Scroll

Taking good care of a Torah scroll
Various recommendations are made regarding the proper care of a Torah
scroll. Here are the general rules of good Torah scroll care:
 The Aron HaKodesh (ah-rohn ha-koh-desh; Holy Ark) where the Torah
scrolls are kept in a synagogue must be moisture-free and well-ventilated
to prevent mold growth on the Torah.
 If a Torah scroll needs to be transported, extreme care must be taken to
avoid humidity, rain, or excessive bumps — all of which can cause
damage to the Torah scroll.
 Each time the Torah is unrolled to be read publicly (see Chapter 13), it
needs to be rolled again carefully and not too tightly before being put
back in the Aron HaKodesh. Parchment is easily crushed or even ripped
if one isn’t careful, and if a Torah scroll is rolled tightly, letters may rub
together and be worn away or the parchment may crack.
 It’s crucial that a Torah scroll gets enough air. Even if it’s not being
unrolled for public reading, the scroll should be rolled from one end to
the other from time to time to prevent molding and drying out.
 The Torah reader as well as those people who receive the honor of offering
a blessing before the open Torah scroll must never touch the parchment
directly. Even when the Torah is read with a yad (pointer), the reader
must not to touch the letters with the pointer because of the risk of
scratching the parchment and damaging the letters.
Discovering errors in a Torah scroll
There are many possible reasons for declaring a Torah scroll unfit for use.
Some examples include:
 A word is missing or misspelled.
 A letter is missing or improperly written.
 A name of God is misspelled.
 Two letters are touching each other.
Sometimes an error in the text is discovered during a public reading of the
Torah. If the error is significant, such as a missing word or a misspelling of
one of God’s names, the Torah is immediately set aside and the reading pro-
ceeds with another Torah scroll. If there are no other Torah scrolls available,
the Torah reading must stop, as if there are no Torah scrolls present at all.
244
Part IV: The Importance of the Torah in Judaism 

But it also may happen during a reading that the reader thinks a word is mis-
spelled but the error is less obvious, such as a letter looking somewhat
unclear because it’s slightly smudged or was written sloppily. This can easily
happen because some letters in Hebrew are remarkably similar; for example,
the three letters “vav,” “zayin,” and “nun” aren’t all that different (refer to
Figure 14-2). One way to determine the status of such a letter is to ask a child
who knows the Hebrew alphabet to approach the Torah and identify the
letter. If the child says the wrong letter, the Torah is set aside. If the child
says the correct letter, the reading goes on. In either case, after the reading,
arrangements are made to try to repair or clarify the letter so that there’s no
doubt about its identity. After all, Torahs must be perfect!
An error found in a Torah scroll can be considered minor or major.
 Minor errors are correctable. For example, if a thin letter (such as the
Hebrew letter “vav,” which is simply a thin vertical line) is missing, there’s
usually enough space for the scribe to fit it in.
 Major errors are generally not correctable. For example:
• When a thick letter is found to be missing, there usually isn’t enough
space to make a repair. Even if there’s enough room, inserting a
letter is often aesthetically unpleasing and not acceptable.
• In the case of a name of God being misspelled, there’s no choice
but to place that sheet of parchment in a genizah. According to
Jewish law and tradition, erasing the written form of any of God’s
names is strictly forbidden.
Repairing a Torah scroll
Even with the most careful treatment, periodically most Torahs need some
kind of maintenance or repair. The most common problems that need a
skilled scribe’s attention are:
 Some of the letters need sharpening or fixing, or broken letters need
repair. If spelling errors or calligraphy errors are small, the scribe can
scrape out the text in error with a sharp blade or piece of glass and then
rewrite it. If possible, an incorrect letter can be altered. Some Hebrew
letters are easily turned into other letters by adding a stroke (similar to
changing a “P” into a “B” by adding one curved line). If a spelling error is
significant, the entire sheet of parchment must be replaced. If two
Torahs have errors and are the same size, it’s permissible to remove a
sheet of parchment with an error from one Torah and replace it with a
perfect sheet from the Torah. The incomplete Torah is then either
repaired or put in a genizah.
245
Chapter 14: The Final Commandment: Writing a Torah Scroll

 Some of the sheets of parchment need resewn. When a sheet of parchment
is torn, the tear may be sewn up if it extends into two lines of text on an
old Torah. If the tear extends to the third line of text of a newer Torah, it
also may be sewn up. However, larger tears require the sheet to be
replaced.
 The parchment needs cleaning. A qualified scribe can clean a Torah without
damaging it. Sometimes the parchment needs to be scraped, but appropriate
cleaning solutions can also be used by someone with experience.
If a Torah needs repair because of an error in the writing, it must be repaired
within 30 days or else it must be put in a genizah.
Storing or burying a Torah scroll
when it’s beyond repair
A genizah is the storage place for old and seriously worn sacred books and
scrolls that will no longer be used. Usually books and scrolls that are no
longer usable are held in a genizah before burial, but there are also genizahs
that simply store unusable sacred scrolls and books forever, and no further
burial occurs. Sacred Jewish books are put in a genizah or buried in a Jewish
cemetery because anything containing any one of the several forms of God’s
name in Hebrew is considered too holy to throw away or dispose of in any
way other than proper burial.

Always Up for Discussion:
Analyzing the Torah
In This Chapter
 Accepting that the Torah has many levels of meaning
 Grasping the four basic approaches to the Torah text
 Pondering the legitimacy of the Torah codes
T
he Torah isn’t a book that you can read, finish, and then say that you
understand. Even if you reread the Torah a second time, a third time, or
even a hundred times, you can’t say that you really know it. Not fully. Serious
students of the Torah know that studying the work is an endless process
because the Torah is said to be infinite in its depth.
Even if you spend a lifetime studying the Torah, memorizing it, understanding
it, and mastering every commentary that has ever been written on the Torah,
you still could not say that you now know it completely. This is because, by
definition, everyone understands the Torah in his or her own way.
In this chapter, I introduce you to the basics of Torah analysis. I explain that
the Torah has endless possibilities for interpretation and that you can read
the Torah on four general levels, from the most literal to the most hidden. I
also touch on the idea of codes and numbers in understanding the Torah. For
details on using different translations and commentaries to help you study
the Torah, head to Chapter 16.
Grasping the Infinite Possibilities
of Interpreting the Torah
I often watch Christian preachers on Sunday morning television, and I get the
impression that they generally believe that the Torah (the first five books of
the Christian Bible) should be understood literally. They read a verse and

understand it just as it’s written. I also get the impression that they believe
that only one “accepted” interpretation is allowed. The Jewish people relate
to the Torah in a very different way.
In principle, the Torah has an infinite number of levels of meaning. Because of
this, it’s a document that requires careful analysis as well as the aid of com-
mentaries. It’s the responsibility of all Jews everywhere to establish a rela-
tionship with the Torah and to participate and struggle while exploring its
myriad of levels.
The fact that the Torah has so many levels of meaning doesn’t mean that any
and every interpretation is always correct. The ancient tradition of the study
of the Torah includes limits and parameters. One of my teachers uses the anal-
ogy of a game of chess to explain this fact. Chess is a game with well-established
rules. For example, a pawn is permitted to make certain moves on the chess
board; you may want the pawn to move like a queen, but the rules dictate
that it simply can’t make that move. A pawn moves like a pawn, and a queen
moves like a queen. Nevertheless, countless chess games are played by millions
of people every day and for centuries past, and there seems to be no end to
the creativity and diversity that can be expressed on the 8-x-8-inch playing
board. Similarly, Torah interpretation has its rules, as described in the Oral
Torah, but within those rules there are infinite possibilities for creativity and
individual participation.
In the following sections, I explain some basics about understanding the nature
of both the Torah and Torah interpretation, such as the multiple facets of the
Torah, the idea that the Torah contains everything, the concept of everyone
being on a different level of Torah understanding, and the possibility of finding
your identity in the Torah.
Just like a diamond: Studying
the Torah’s 70 facets
The number 70 appears frequently in Jewish life and lore. Some commentators
point out that the number 70 is the result of multiplying 7, which is a profound
number in Judaism (the 7 days of creation), with 10, which is also a 
profound number (10 commandments, 10 essences of existence according to
Jewish theology, and 10 fingers). Seventy, some sages point out, is a number
that implies completeness. Following are just a handful of examples of its
prominence:
 Seventy nations existed in the world of the Torah.
 Seventy Jewish souls from Jacob’s family went down to Egypt.
 Moses chose 70 elders.
 Seventy sages make up the Jewish supreme court, the Sanhedrin.
248
Part IV: The Importance of the Torah in Judaism 

 Seventy words make up the original Kiddush, the special prayer sanctifying
Shabbat.
 The numerical value of the Hebrew word for wine is 70.
 The numerical value of the Hebrew word sod meaning “secret” is 70.
 Noah had 70 descendants.
 A line in the Midrash (mid-rahsh; rabbinic commentary on the Torah;
see Chapter 3) says, “The Holy One Blessed be He has seventy names;
Israel has seventy names; the Torah has seventy names; Jerusalem has
seventy names (Numbers Rabbah 14:12).”
 Jewish tradition speaks of the 70 faces of the divine Shekhinah (sheh-
khee-nah; God’s presence in the world). Tradition teaches that it’s possible
for individuals to participate in bringing God’s presence into the world.
The tradition of Torah study includes the idea that the Torah has 70 facets,
and like a diamond, these facets help to make the Torah shine in one’s eyes.
Shiv’im panim laTorah (shih-veem pah-neem lah-toe-rah) is an ancient
Hebrew phrase that means “there are 70 faces in the Torah.”
Even though the Torah text is exact and never changes, your understanding
of each word, sentence, story, and detail is never limited to its literal meaning
(I discuss the literal meaning of the Torah in the later section “Just the facts,
ma’am: The literal level”). Rather, by looking at the Torah from various angles,
every detail shines and twinkles like a star. Stars are like diamonds in the sky,
and the image of a diamond with 70 facets has become a way in which stu-
dents of the Torah understand a part of its nature.
What a great teacher teaches tomorrow is
Torah: Finding everything in the Torah
As I describe in Chapter 1, it’s difficult to define the word “Torah.” It’s used to
refer to the Five Books of Moses, but “Torah” also has a broad meaning that
transcends any specific document or collection of documents. Yes, the Torah
is the Five Books of Moses, and yes, the Holy Scriptures of the Jewish people
begin with the Five Books of Moses and then continue with the books of the
Prophets and other holy writings. But the term “Torah” transcends the
definition that includes all the sacred books of Jewish literature throughout
the centuries.
Torah transcends time and what can be contained within finite letters on
finite pages. It may sound outrageous that Torah includes the notion that
what a great teacher teaches tomorrow is Torah, but this is precisely how
serious students see the Torah.
249
Chapter 15: Always Up for Discussion: Analyzing the Torah

But students of the Torah encounter an important paradox (and acknowledge
that they need to embrace it): On the one hand, the Torah is infinite and there-
fore can’t be contained in any finite document or body of literature. On the other
hand, the Five Books of Moses, the document most well-known as the Torah of
the Jewish people, contains everything — past, present, and future.
When looked at through the right lens at the right time and on the proper
spiritual level, everything can be found in the Torah. The Torah scroll and 
its contents are multidimensional to the infinite degree. It has been said that
whereas many religious traditions conceive that Scripture comes from heaven,
the Jewish tradition conceives of the Torah as heaven. In Jewish tradition, involving
oneself in the analysis and interpretation of the Torah is considered an act of
participating with God in the creation of the universe.
Recognizing that everyone’s on a
different level of understanding
In traditional circles, where Torah is studied daily and intensely, there’s a
general assumption that each person understands the Torah on his or her
own individual level. Everyone seeks their own level. The Torah is conceived
of as so vast that it can easily contain all these levels, from the level of the
simplest child to the level of the greatest genius.
Traditional Jewish life contains the notion of the maggid (mah-geed). This
term is often translated as “storyteller” or “preacher,” but it actually refers to
a very specific kind of teacher — one who can speak to a group of students
who are all on different levels and make them feel as if they’re being addressed
individually. The greatest of Torah teachers can be said to do two things simul-
taneously: speak to each student on his or her own level, and raise each student
to a higher level.
It would be irresponsible of me to give the impression that Torah study is
some kind of free-for-all, where everything goes, every point of view is
acceptable, and no one can make a mistake. That simply isn’t true. What is
true is that everything is up for discussion. Questions are not only permissi-
ble but are a required part of the process of Torah study.
One can even go as far as saying that if it weren’t for questions, the traditional
Jewish process of Torah study couldn’t happen. Traditional Torah study is
never a process of one person insisting to everyone else that “this is the way
it is.” Rather, a student of the Torah can express a point of view that should
and often does get challenged by another student. As my teacher put it,
“Every question is permissible; not every answer.”
250
Part IV: The Importance of the Torah in Judaism 

Every person is a letter: Using the 
Torah to discover your identity
One popular image used among the community of Torah students throughout
the ages that also reflects the view that each person understands the Torah
on his or her own level is that of each student of the Torah finding his or her
“letter” in the Torah. One of the meanings contained in this image is that it’s
not one’s task to mimic others.
A well-known story from Jewish tradition talks about Rabbi Zusya (zoo-sha),
who was a student of the great master the Maggid of Mezeritch (mah-geed of
mehz-rich). Rabbi Zusya taught that when his soul arrives in heaven, he
won’t be asked why he wasn’t Moses but rather why he was not Zusya. Each
student must become an individual, not some rubber stamp of someone else.
Finding one’s letter in the Torah, therefore, is finding one’s own identity.
It’s widely acknowledged among Torah students that each tends to be drawn
to his or her own part of the Torah. For many people, certain verses resonate
deeply. Some traditional Jews even acknowledge the fact that they have their
own pasuk (pah-sook; line of text in the Torah). For example, each of my
three children wears a silver bracelet or ring engraved with specific lines
from the Torah that resonate with them.
I once did a project in which I asked a number of leading Jewish educators the
following question: Where do you suggest that someone who’s just beginning
to get involved in Jewish life begin? Each gave me the exact same answer: Find
one mitzvah (one divine commandment from the Torah), and do it forever.
Become an expert on that one mitzvah by learning all its facets, its history,
and its details.
Each of those teachers knew that the Torah is like a hologram in that every
tiny part actually contains the whole. Students of the Torah know that by
focusing on one sentence, or by delving into one mitzvah, or even by locating
and exploring one single letter of the Torah, the process will lead to studying
the Torah in its entirety.
Entering the Garden of 
Torah Interpretation
The English word “paradise” comes from the Hebrew word for garden or
orchard. Because Hebrew vowels aren’t part of the Hebrew alphabet and usually
aren’t used in ancient texts, the four letters p-r-d-s are pronounced par-des. The
image of the student of Torah entering the pardes of Torah, the garden of Torah,
is an ancient one.
251
Chapter 15: Always Up for Discussion: Analyzing the Torah

Centuries of Torah students have confirmed that the process of Torah study
is profoundly pleasurable. Some students study Torah for hours each day,
spending every spare moment studying the Torah. It’s common to see traditional
Jews carrying at least one book around with them at all times; the book is
usually a traditional text that focuses on one aspect of the Torah. The practice
of carrying the book allows constant access to the most pleasurable experience
of entering the plush and beautiful garden of Torah.
The garden of Torah contains all levels of meaning. It’s considered dangerous
to your spiritual and psychological health to go beyond the level for which
you’re ready (see the sidebar “Rabbi Akiva and a tale of four rabbis” for an
example). Four general levels are represented by each of the Hebrew letters
for the word “orchard,” PaRDeS:
 P for p’shat (literal)
 R for remez (the hint)
 D for d’rash (the moral)
 S for sod (the secret)
I explore each of these levels in the following sections.
Torah study can be quite demanding. Traditional students of Torah often
engage in deep and profound analysis of the text that requires high levels of
concentration and the ability to understand and work with abstract ideas.
Sometimes the Torah challenges a person on a deeply emotional and per-
sonal level and cuts to the very core of his soul. Sometimes, Torah study lays
a person bare as he confronts the most personal of spiritual issues.
Nevertheless, entering the process of Torah study is entering paradise, the
absolutely beautiful and perfect garden.
Interpreting the Torah on different levels is similar to the way you perceive
any art form. A poem can have many meanings, as can a film, a sculpture, and
all other creative efforts. The difference is that with art, you’re free to have
any interpretation you want; it’s completely personal. Interpreting the Torah
has its boundaries, and it’s essential to have a qualified teacher who can help
guide your understanding of the Torah text and help to make sure that you
don’t misinterpret the Torah in a way that’s incompatible with Jewish tradition.
There’s still room for unprecedented interpretations that have never before
been taught. The term for a new interpretation of the Torah is chidush (khih-
doosh; new development). But a new insight into the meaning of the Torah
must be tested over time by learned individuals to make sure that it’s in har-
mony with the teachings of the sages and the oral tradition.
252
Part IV: The Importance of the Torah in Judaism 

Just the facts, ma’am: The literal level
The Hebrew letter with the sound of a “p” in the word prds stands for the
Hebrew word p’shat (puh-shot). P’shat asks for the literal meaning of words.
One general area of Torah study includes a search for the basic meaning of
the text itself. An example of a literal interpretation of a verse in the Torah is
the very first commandment found in Genesis. When the Torah says, “Be
fruitful and multiply” (Genesis 1:28), it means just that: Have children!
Just because the text says something literally doesn’t mean that you’re only
supposed to understand it literally. Instead, you may see another meaning in the
verse on your own, or you may read a commentary that suggests another level
of meaning. Torah commentators throughout the ages have earned reputations
regarding the various levels of Torah interpretation. Some mainly focus on the
literal meaning; others are more inclined to write or teach on the homiletic level
or mystical level. Serious students of the Torah find that they become partial to
certain commentators because the students are personally inclined to see
things on the same general level as the commentators. The best example is a
253
Chapter 15: Always Up for Discussion: Analyzing the Torah
Rabbi Akiva and a tale of four rabbis
Every student of Torah sooner or later falls in
love with Rabbi Akiva (ah-key-vah) (c. 50 CE–c.
135 CE). Rabbi Akiva was one of the greatest
rabbis of all time and perhaps the greatest rabbi
in the entire rabbinic period of Jewish history.
One of the remarkable parts of his personal
story is that that he didn’t know the ABC’s of
Hebrew until he was 40 years old. According to
the Talmud, before he was 40, Rabbi Akiva was
an ignorant shepherd who was hostile toward
religion in general and Jewish tradition in par-
ticular. But as the story goes, a young woman
named Rachel saw Akiva the shepherd and
detected his great potential. Rachel said to
Akiva that she would marry him if he would
promise to dedicate himself to learning Torah.
The insight that Rachel had into Akiva’s charac-
ter, abilities, and potential was accurate.
Rabbi Akiva is clearly the great hero for all who
decide late in life to return to the spiritual path.
Rabbi Akiva also started late in life and grew to
the very pinnacle of spiritual development.
He appears hundreds and hundreds of times in
rabbinic literature and is known as one of the
great spiritual masters of Jewish history and
tradition. In fact, a story that every Kabbalist is
familiar with tells of Rabbi Akiva’s greatness
when describing four rabbis who entered an
orchard.
Four great rabbis — Ben Azzai, Ben Zoma,
Elisha ben Abuya, and Rabbi Akiva — entered
the pardes, the orchard or garden of Torah
study. These four rabbis explored the Torah to
the greatest depth and encountered the most
sublime, esoteric, and profound teachings.
The story of the four rabbis indicates the dan-
gers of studying on a level you’re not prepared
for. Ben Azzai entered the most profound depths
of Torah study and died. Ben Zoma entered and
went crazy. Elisha ben Abuya entered and
became a heretic. Only Rabbi Akiva, as the text
indicates, “Entered in peace and left in peace.”

well-known phrase from the Torah, “an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth”(Exodus
21:23). Read literally, it means that equal retaliation is appropriate; literally, it
means that if you poke my eye out, I can poke your eye out. Jewish tradition and
law absolutely forbids this kind of retaliation. Jewish tradition has a far more
humane approach to subjects of retribution and reconciliation, so this literal
interpretation is false. The Oral Torah teaches that monetary compensation
is paid to the injured person (Talmud, Tractate Bava Kamma 83b).
What exactly are you implying? The hint
When you read a book or a poem, or when you watch a movie, a TV show, or a
play, it’s obvious that not every detail is said explicitly; some things are implied.
For example, if you watch a movie about New York City and the camera pans
the skyline, the presence or absence of the World Trade Center Twin Towers
can help you determine when the movie takes place and perhaps even the
mood of the urban setting. By gathering other clues and by close examination
of the facts, all sorts of conclusions can be drawn that aren’t explicit.
Similarly, there is a level of understanding and study of the Torah called remez
(reh-mehz; the hint) that points to an effort to read the Torah text and to reveal
what’s implied but not stated explicitly. For example, the Torah doesn’t say that
divorce is permissible (at least it doesn’t come out and say it directly). But the
Torah does lay out what a couple must do to get divorced, implying that divorce
is in fact permissible. The text offers hints and implications that allow you to
make certain assumptions about facts that aren’t revealed through specific
words.
When a commentator on the Torah or any student of the Torah comes up with
a hint or remez, it’s open to severe analysis because of how easy it is to jump
to conclusions and convince yourself that something is being hinted at when in
fact it isn’t. For instance, do you remember the magician David Copperfield’s
magic trick of making the Statue of Liberty disappear? Obviously, he didn’t
make the Statue of Liberty actually disappear. If he had those powers, he
wouldn’t be an entertainer but would use his powers for all kinds of other
important things. David Copperfield created the illusion of the disappearance.
In the same way, the student of Torah has to be cautious when jumping to
conclusions about the Torah text — what seems to be there may be an illusion.
So, what’s the point? The moral
One core aspect of the Torah is its focus on deeds and human experiences in
the world. Yes, the Torah deals with eternal ideas and spiritual concepts such
as the soul, miracles, and faith, but it’s largely a document teaching proper
behavior and healthy attitudes.
254
Part IV: The Importance of the Torah in Judaism 

One of the four general levels of Torah explication is d’rash (duh’rahsh). This
level signifies the homiletic, the ethical message, the inspiration for more refined
behavior, the adage that can change your life, or simply put, the moral of the
story.
When a student of the Torah reads and studies the text, he or she is often
looking for guidance for living life. That guidance can be quite concrete, such
as in the area of good business practices, or it can be more spiritual in
nature, like how and when to pray and deepen one’s relationship to God. The
Jewish view of both spiritual and physical acts is that they are both spiritual.
The d’rash level of Torah interpretation usually provides practical teachings
that nourish the student.
For example, the Torah and the great texts of Jewish tradition contain the
story of Abraham leaving his family home to begin his journey. Students can
learn an inspiring amount from the results of a major life decision like
Abraham’s.
The word “Torah” comes from the same root as the Hebrew word for instruction.
And you can find much of the instruction contained in the Torah when pursuing
the d’rash of the text. I devote Part III to the behavior lessons found in the Torah.
Do you want to know a secret?
The deepest level
A central image of the Jewish tradition is one of God looking into the Torah
and creating the world. One of the implications of this image is that everything
is contained in the Torah, or as the great rabbinic sages put it, the Torah is the
blueprint for the world. The sod (sohwd; secret level) of Torah interpretation is
the pursuit of the deepest spiritual ideas and most sublime revelations.
For thousands of years, Jews of all ages and at all levels of understanding have
pursued the secrets of the Torah. The Five Books of Moses in the form of a
Torah scroll isn’t just one more document among the great collection of sacred
texts of the world. Rather, in Jewish tradition the Torah is considered to be
part of the root structure of the world. Every letter, every space between every
letter, and indeed every aspect of the Torah is filled with divine revelation.
The greatest Torah commentators throughout the centuries have done the
following and found profound meaning:
 Counted letters
 Given letters numerical values
 Reversed letters
255
Chapter 15: Always Up for Discussion: Analyzing the Torah

 Found inconsistent spellings of the same word and discovered important
lessons in these inconsistencies
 Found some letters written larger or smaller in the Torah scroll and
taught the meaning of these differences
Many other details of the Torah have infinite potential to reveal the deepest
secrets that God has revealed. One example of how a word can have deeper
meaning than you may think about at first glance is the Hebrew word tzibbur
(tzee-boor; community). It consists of three Hebrew consonants that, when
seen together, the great Torah sages consider an acronym for a basic spiritual
concept having to do with three types of individuals on the spiritual path:
 The “tz” sound, called a tzadee (tzah-dee), is connected with the perfect
saint known as the tzadik (tzah-deek). There are people in the world
who are at such a high level of purity that they don’t even know what
temptation feels like.
 The “b” sound, which is made by the Hebrew letter bet, the second
letter of the Hebrew alphabet, is connected to the beinoni (bay-no-nee),
the intermediate individual on the spiritual path (the level in which most
people find themselves). Unlike the tzadik, the beinoni knows temptation
but is able to resist it. The constant tension of that struggle is the level
at which the beinoni lives his life.
 The “r” sound, which is called the resh (raysh), is connected with the
rasha (rah-shah; the evil individual). At the root of his being, the rasha
has a point of view about life that’s a major distortion of the way it
should be. The evil individual is wicked through and through.
In other words, the simple Hebrew word for community, tzibbur, is far richer
in meaning than just a combination of letters that signifies one concept of
community. Rather, those three letters point to the essence of the human
soul in the world, where the student of Torah asks the question “Who am I?”
Analysis of the word “tzibbur” reveals that human beings are souls in con-
stant struggle. Inner urges and elements of the soul are at odds with each
other, and one of the primary activities of life is the struggling with these var-
ious forces in the soul in order to be able to choose and reject the urges
properly, at the right time and the right place. The close analysis of the word
“tzibbur” is an example of the sod, the secret hidden in the Torah and waiting
to be revealed.
Although anyone can potentially have a deep, mystical insight into the
hidden meaning of a verse or verses in the Torah at any time, the sod level of
Torah interpretation generally comes after years of experience and scholar-
ship. As with any personal interpretation, it’s always advised that a Torah
student have a qualified teacher with whom he can test new ideas.
256
Part IV: The Importance of the Torah in Judaism 

Examining the “Bible Codes”: 
Are They Legit?
Trying to pierce through the Torah text to locate secret or hidden messages
has always been a part of legitimate Torah study. But it’s not always easy to
separate tried-and-true methods that have stood the test of time and are
based on solid Torah scholarship from faddish approaches using question-
able methods. One such highly questionable approach is generally known as
the Bible Codes.
The meaning of hidden codes
In 1997, a former reporter for the Washington Post and the Wall Street Journal
wrote the bestseller The Bible Code (Touchstone). In his book, Michael
Drosnin expresses what many people have speculated about the Torah: that
it’s actually a secret code and the proper approach can reveal its secrets.
257
Chapter 15: Always Up for Discussion: Analyzing the Torah
A twist on understanding the Zohar
One of the classic books of Torah literature that
has achieved the status of a sacred text among
the Jews is the Zohar (see Chapter 3 for full
details on this text). The Zohar is often referred
to as a commentary on the Torah containing the
sod (in other words containing many of the
secrets hidden within the Torah). Some say that
the Five Books of Moses is the p’shat (the literal)
and the Zohar is the sod (the mystical or secret).
My teacher teaches an interesting twist on the
Zohar that’s actually the opposite of that point
and that offers a profound insight into the Five
Books of Moses itself. My teacher teaches that
the Zohar is the p’shat and the Torah is the sod.
In other words, when one reads the Zohar, the
mystical concepts are there for the taking;
they’re explained and explored rather explicitly.
In contrast, in the Five Books of Moses, the
deepest and most profound ideas aren’t on the
surface but rather are embedded in the text. So
the Torah student is like a miner looking for dia-
monds. Like diamonds, the ideas aren’t always
visible but nonetheless exist deep within the
text and are accessible to the student who’s dili-
gent and invests time in the pursuit of Torah
wisdom.

According to Drosnin, a number of techniques can be used to reveal the
Torah’s messages, including counting letters in certain arithmetic sequences.
For instance, if you take the first letter of each word in a sequence of words,
those letters may create another word. For example, the first letter of each of
the words in the phrase “great out doors” spell out GOD.
The best-known example in Drosnin’s book reveals through a sequencing
method that the Torah seems to predict the assassination of the former
prime minister of Israel Yitzhak Rabin. The words “Yitzhak Rabin” and the
phrase “assassin that will assassinate” intersect when Drosnin applies a cer-
tain method of counting in sequences.
People may ask, “Are these calculations mere coincidences, or can secrets of
the Torah actually be revealed by recognizing the text as a secret code?”
Many critiques of The Bible Code reveal deep skepticism and even scorn at
Drosnin’s techniques. One critic, for example, applied Drosnin’s methodology
to Moby Dick and found that the book references the assassinations of Prime
Minister Indira Gandhi, Soviet exile Leon Trotsky, Reverend Martin Luther
King, Jr., John F. Kennedy, Princess Diana, and Abraham Lincoln. This critic’s
intent is simply to show that finding so-called “hidden” messages is coinci-
dence and that the messages aren’t legitimate messages imbedded into the
texts by their authors.
But whether Drosnin is right or not, one good lesson that comes from The
Bible Code is that the approach is consistent in one significant way with the
traditional way Torah scholars have been relating to the text since time
immemorial. The basic assumption is that the Torah contains far more than a
simple narration of stories and laws from ancient times. If the Bible Code phe-
nomenon does nothing else but inspire people to look at the Torah more
carefully, it’s my opinion that it has done some good in the world.
An example of how a coincidence can seem to make sense is the interesting
phenomenon in the 46th Psalm of the King James Version of the Bible. If you
count to the 46th word of Psalm 46, and if you count 46 words from the last
word of Psalm 46, the two words put together spell “Shakespeare.” It’s said
that Shakespeare was 46 years old when the King James Version of the Bible
was published. Is this a coincidence? Or did the author deliberately put this
into the translation of the book of Psalms? I have my opinion: I think it’s a fan-
tastic coincidence.
258
Part IV: The Importance of the Torah in Judaism 

The significance of numbers
Unlike the Bible Codes, which use methods not sanctioned by Jewish tradi-
tion, there are traditionally accepted methods of analyzing the Torah as a
hidden code through the system known as gematria (geh-mah-tree-yah;
Aramaic for “numerology” with a connection to the Greek word “geometry”).
An ancient and accepted approach to exploring the depths of the Torah,
gematria is based on the fact that each letter in the Hebrew alphabet has a
numerical value. The system calculates the numerical values of letters,
words, or phrases and thereby gains insight into the text.
The assumption in gematria is that the numerical values aren’t coincidental
but rather are part of God’s intention. For example, if two words have the
same numerical value, scholars say that there’s a connection between them
that needs to be revealed.
Following are three of a number of ways Jewish tradition determines the
numerical value of each letter (see Figure 15-1):
 Absolute value: Absolute value means that each letter has an accepted
numerical equivalent. For example, the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet,
aleph, equals 1, the second letter, vet, equals 2, and so on through yud,
which has the value of 10. After the yud, the next several letters are
increased by 10 until the last three letters, which are increased by 100.
These values are traditionally accepted as one way of using Hebrew letters
to represent numbers.
 Ordinal value: Ordinal value calculates each of the 22 letters of the Hebrew
alphabet differently and assigns consecutive numbers from 1 to 22 to each
letter. For example, aleph equals 1, khaf equals 11, tav equals 22. (Some
Hebrew letters have final forms; you can see all the values for final letters
in Figure 15-1.)
 Reduced value: Reduced value reduces each letter to a figure of one
digit. For example, aleph (which equals 1), yud (which equals 10), and
kuf (which equals 100) all have a numerical value of 1. Similarly, bet (2),
khaf (20), and reish (200) all have a numerical value of 2. In this method,
the letters have only nine equivalents rather than 22.
Related to reduced value is integral reduced value, in which the numerical
value of an entire word is reduced to one number. If the sum of the numbers
in one word is more than nine, the numbers are added together until one
digit remains.

Part IV: The Importance of the Torah in Judaism 

The divine name Elohim is a simple example of gematria: The name has the
same absolute value (86) as the Hebrew word hateva (hah-teh-vah; nature).
The name of God “Elohim” refers to that part of God who can be seen as the
Creator and expresses Himself in nature. Here’s how the Hebrew spellings of
the two words add up:
Elohim = aleph-lamed-hey-yud-mem = 1 + 30 + 5 + 10 + 40 = 86
Hateva = hey-tet-bait-ayin = 5 + 9 + 2 + 70 = 86
Are you interested in finding out more about gematria? You can uncover a good
amount of gematria in the Torah commentaries of Rabbi Judah Loew ben Bezalel
(1525–1609). He’s generally known among scholars as the Maharal of Prague or
simply the Maharal. Another great Torah commentator, Rabbi Isaiah Horowitz
(who happens to be a direct ancestor of mine), also uses gematria frequently in
his masterpiece of Kabbalah, The Two Tablets of the Covenant. A good book to
help you begin to explore this subject in more detail is The Wisdom of the
Hebrew Alphabet by Michael L. Munk (Artscroll Mesorah).

Studying the Torah with
Translations, Commentaries, and
Other Resources
In This Chapter
 Checking out contemporary Torah translations
 Meeting the great Torah commentators of yesterday and today
 Starting your study of the Torah with additional resources
T
he original language of the Torah is Hebrew, and it is best if you can read
the original for the same reason it’s best to read any work of literature in
its original language: Every translation is itself a commentary and must, by
definition, reflect the bias of the translator. However, most people, including
most Jews, can’t read Hebrew. Luckily, many translations of the Torah are
available, along with many commentaries and additional tools to help you to
understand the text. In this chapter, I start you on the road to deeper Torah
study with information on translations, commentaries, and other helpful
resources. Turn to Chapter 15 for basics on analyzing the Torah.
Reading a Translation of the Torah
If you want to read or study the Torah (the Five Books of Moses) and can’t do
so in its original Hebrew, turn to a translation. Most English translations of
the Torah include additional commentaries, which either are written by
contemporary writers or are translations of classical commentaries. 
(I discuss commentators in more detail later in this chapter in the section
“Getting Help from Great Classic and Contemporary Commentators.”) 

A Torah commentary is usually a word-by-word, phrase-by-phrase, or line-by-
line explanation of the meaning of a text offered by some Torah authority.
Torah commentaries may include
 Additional information that helps the reader understand the text
 Definitions of terms
 A comparison of one verse to similar language in a different verse
 Answers to anticipated questions or problems that a Torah student
may have
 Expansion of ideas contained in the text
 Indication that a verse is actually a commandment
 Help relating the text to contemporary life

Part IV: The Importance of the Torah in Judaism 

Surveying translations used by 
different Jewish movements
Different movements within the American Jewish community usually favor one
or two translations of the Torah over others. While every synagogue selects
the translations it wants to use — as well as all other Jewish practices — the
following list runs down who generally reads what:
 Chassidic: Chassidic Judaism, which is based on the original teachings
of the Baal Shem Tov (bah-ahl shem towv; master of the Good Name),
contains many subgroups. Three of the largest groups are Satmar,
Lubavitch, and Bobov. The synagogues of each of these groups generally
use editions of the Torah in Hebrew. The most well-known Chassidic group
is Lubavitch; the teachings of this group’s leaders and revered teachers
from past generations can be found in the Gutnick edition of the Torah.
 Orthodox: The Orthodox movement in America is divided into modern
Orthodox and haredi (khah-ray-dee; one who is in awe of God), sometimes
known as ultra-Orthodox. In Orthodox synagogues that have English
translations of the Torah, the one most commonly found is The Chumash:
The Stone Edition. I’ve also known some Orthodox synagogues to
use The Living Torah.
 Conservative: There are some Conservative synagogues where you can
find equal participation among men and women in all rituals, while other
Conservative synagogues continue to follow the traditional divisions
between male and female roles. (Check out Chapter 13 for more about the
Torah synagogue service.) The authorized Conservative Torah translation
and commentary is Etz Chayyim.
 Reform: The Reform movement, like the other movements listed previ-
ously, isn’t monolithic in synagogues’ practices. Some are more traditional
than others. For example, some Reform houses of worship use no Hebrew,
and some actually refuse to allow their rabbis to wear a kippah (key-pah;
skullcap), while other Reform synagogues are more traditional. The
Reform movement uses an authorized Torah translation and commentary
called The Torah: A Modern Commentary; it’s commonly referred to as
“Plaut” after the surname of its major translator and commentator.
 Reconstructionist and Renewal: Neither the Reconstructionist movement
(the first movement to have begun in North America) nor the Renewal
movement (a relatively new movement that considers itself transdenom-
inational) has its own official Torah translation and commentary, and
the resources used vary widely among the synagogues and prayer
groups of both movements.
The following sections summarize (in order of my most to least favorite) the
most popular translations of the Five Books of Moses currently available in
English.
265
Chapter 16: Studying the Torah with Translations and Commentaries

The Living Torah
The Living Torah, written by the late Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan, was published in
1981. It’s probably the most clear and readable English edition of the Five
Books of Moses that exists.
One of the most important features of this edition is Rabbi Kaplan’s foot-
notes, in which he explains and justifies his decisions regarding the transla-
tion of difficult words and concepts. It’s important to be aware of the fact that
The Living Torah isn’t always a literal translation; rather, it’s a translation
based on the accepted rabbinic commentaries and Jewish laws that are a
part of authentic Jewish practice and belief. As far as Torah translations go,
The Living Torah by Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan is my personal favorite.
The Chumash: The Gutnick Edition
The Gutnick Edition by Rabbi Chaim Miller is a noteworthy Torah translation
because it’s written in modern English, but despite its contemporary sound,
it’s quite faithful to traditional Jewish commentaries and understandings of
the text.
In addition to a translation of the Torah text, The Gutnick Edition contains lots of
supplementary material to aid and nourish the reader. You get translations 
of classic commentaries and running commentary based on the oral teachings
of the greatest rabbi and Jewish leader of the 20th century, Rabbi Menachem
Mendel Schneerson, also known as the Lubavitcher Rebbe. And if that weren’t
enough, throughout each volume of this translation are hundreds of additional
insights from Jewish tradition to further enlighten the Torah text. The book
also contains many diagrams and tables to help you get a firm grasp of the text.
The Chumash: The Stone Edition
The Stone Edition of the Five Books of Moses is a beautiful volume with a
contemporary-sounding English translation. It’s also well-known in traditional
Jewish circles as being faithful to the classic commentators.
Of particular note in The Stone Edition is the contemporary commentary pro-
duced by a team of scholars under the direction of Rabbi Nosson Scherman.
This commentary draws upon classic biblical commentaries, Talmudic
insight, and contributions from contemporary scholars. This Torah transla-
tion also includes an excellent index.
Meam Loez
The English edition of Meam Loez (meh-ahm low-ez; people of a foreign tongue)
is a 20-volume set that’s well worth the investment. The original edition of
this Torah translation was written by Rabbi Yaakov Culi and published in
1730. Meam Loez was originally written in Ladino (lah-dee-no), a language
that’s a synthesis of Hebrew and Spanish, and is often considered to be the
greatest publication to ever to appear in that language. It became a major
266
Part IV: The Importance of the Torah in Judaism 

classic among Jews in the entire Mediterranean region and has remained an
important publication within the Jewish world. Although this translation and
commentary is in no way connected with a movement within Judaism, the
content is based on traditional teachings.
This edition is really much more than a translation and commentary on the
Torah. It’s a rich Jewish education in itself, filled with background information,
history, customs, laws, and thorough explanations of holidays and rituals.
The Pentateuch and Haftaroth: The Hertz Edition
With a running commentary that moves phrase-by-phrase throughout the
translation, the English translation in The Hertz Edition comes from the first
Jewish Publication Society translation and was completed in 1917. Although
an out-of-date and often difficult translation to understand, The Hertz Edition
of the Five Books of Moses was surely the most popular edition used in
American synagogues in the 20th century. In my opinion, this translation is
generally uninspired. Many American synagogues continue to use The Hertz
Edition, but it’s rapidly being replaced with the many better alternatives. I
predict that it will soon completely disappear, but it was the accepted
translation for the last few generations. Because of its widespread use, most
American Jews over the last several decades, regardless of their movement
affiliation, are familiar with The Hertz Edition.
The Chumash: The Hirsch Edition
Nineteenth-century German Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch had a significant
influence on Modern Orthodox Judaism, and his commentary on the Five Books
of Moses remains quite popular (as does his German translation of the Torah).
The English version of The Chumash: The Hirsch Edition contains translations
of Rabbi Hirsch’s selected commentary, which draws upon rabbinic commen-
taries as well as includes Hirsch’s own insights. Some people feel that even
though it was published in the 19th century, The Hirsch Edition has a strikingly
modern feel to it. It’s not widely used but is highly regarded and certainly
worth using due to the fine reputation of its author.
Etz Hayim
Produced by the Conservative movement in the United States, Etz Hayim
(aytz khah-yeem; the tree of life) is a modern translation of and commentary
on the Torah. Although it’s growing in popularity among nontraditional Jews,
Etz Hayim has received fierce criticism from the traditional Jewish community,
particularly for some of the 40 topical essays written by scholars within the
Conservative movement.
Unfortunately, when you read the commentary and essays closely, you may
get the sense that a number of the individuals involved in the translation and
commentary are skeptical at best about the divine nature of the Torah. The
commentaries are more firmly based on historical speculation, cross-cultural
analysis, and archaeology than on Jewish spiritual tradition. The commentary
267
Chapter 16: Studying the Torah with Translations and Commentaries

is surprisingly literal; its editors seem to completely avoid traditional Jewish
theology and are more preoccupied with contemporary academic scholarship.
Simply put, the translation and commentary have strange priorities, looking
at the Torah more as a historical document than a spiritual one.
The Torah: A Modern Commentary
This volume, popular among liberal synagogue congregations, is basically 
a gender-sensitive version of a Jewish Publication Society translation, with
largely gender-neutral God language and a new translation of the book of
Genesis. The commentary by W. Gunther Plaut, a leading Reform rabbi,
combines modern and classical sources.
Although A Modern Commentary is used widely, its heavy reliance on modern
points of view that haven’t stood the test of time and that often contradict
some basic views of traditional Judaism make it questionable as a reliable
source for discovering what the classical commentators have to say about
the Torah.
268
Part IV: The Importance of the Torah in Judaism 
It’s Greek to me: The Septuagint
When the Second Temple was completed in
Jerusalem in 516 BCE, the Jewish people lived
under Persian rule. When the Persian Empire fell
apart in 330 BCE, the Jewish people found them-
selves under Greek rule. Around 313 BCE, the
Greek king Ptolemy ordered the Jewish sages to
translate the Torah into Greek. The story of what
happened is recorded in the Talmud (see Chapter
3 for more about the Talmud):
“King Ptolemy once gathered 72 sages. He
placed them in 72 chambers, each of them
in a separate one, without revealing to them
why they were summoned. He entered
each one’s room and said: ‘Write for me the
Torah of Moshe, your teacher.’ God put it in
the heart of each one to translate identi-
cally as all the others did.” (Tractate
Megillah 9)
Jewish legend records that Ptolemy discovered
all the translations to be exactly the same. Even
though the identical translations are considered
to be a miracle, the Talmud says, “On the 8th of
Tevet, the Torah was rendered into Greek during
the days of King Ptolemy, and darkness
descended upon the world for three days.” The
day the sages finished their Greek translations
of the Torah is considered to be a sad one on the
Jewish calendar because of the view that the
Torah would be neither understood nor easily
misunderstood as long as it remained in
Hebrew. The thinking was that a person who
was knowledgeable in Hebrew was also prob-
ably knowledgeable about how the Torah was
to be understood. But if the Torah were to
appear in another language, people without the
proper understanding of how it’s to be read and
grasped could easily distort its message. After
all, the Torah was given to Moses along with the
methodologies for cracking it open.
Although 72 Jewish sages participated in the
translation, the Greek translation of the Torah is
known as the Septuagint, which means the
number 70, thus rounding the number of sages
involved down from 72 to 70.

Selecting the right translation
for your needs
Be careful when you select a translation of any book, especially the Torah.
Often the translator, publisher, or committee supervising the translation has
a bias that comes through in the text — either subtly or obviously. You may
find that one translation is too stiff and almost incomprehensible, whereas
another is warm, down-to-earth, and reader-friendly. For example, many
people are used to the King James Version of the Bible, whose language has
crept into our culture, but it’s difficult to imagine Moses using Old English
phraseology or God using words like “hath” and “shalt.”
It’s important to keep in mind that every translation is a commentary, which
means that the translator’s choice of words can differ vastly from one book
to another. You can see a good example of this in a comparison of two of the
more popular English translations of the Five Books of Moses: the Jewish
Publication Society edition and The Living Torah. In an incident recorded in
the Torah about a person named Dina, the Jewish Publication Society translation
(Tanakh — The Holy Scriptures, Jewish Publication Society) says he “saw her,
and took her and lay with her by force.” In contrast, The Living Torah says he
“seduced her, slept with her, and then raped her.” Clearly, there’s an emotional
difference between the words “saw” and “seduced” and even more of a difference
between the phrases “lay with her by force” and “slept with her and raped
her.” Both translations communicate what happened, but by using the word
“raped” rather than “lay with her by force” The Living Torah is using blunt,
modern language that doesn’t sanitize the event for today’s reader. When I
read “lay with her by force,” I surely don’t get the same sense of the violence
of the act as I do when I hear the word “raped.”
The selection of a translation should be based not only on the language used
in the translation but also on the additional materials included in the volume.
Some Torah translations are simply translations, whereas others include
additional commentaries and other aids to support the reader.
If you’re looking for a translation and commentary that accurately represents
what Jewish tradition has taught for centuries and that’s based on ideas firmly
rooted in Jewish tradition, I strongly suggest The Living Torah, The Chumash:
The Gutnick Edition, or The Chumash: The Stone Edition. If you want to see what
mainstream Conservative congregations are using, Etz Hayim is the one for you.
If you want to see what most Reform congregations are using, go with The Torah:
A Modern Commentary. My suggestion is to focus on the traditional editions so
that you can see what Jews have been studying for centuries and so that you
can familiarize yourself with classical Jewish tradition and fundamental ideas
of Judaism. It’s much like seriously learning how to dance: You first learn the
basic, classical dance steps and techniques, and then you can consider
modern improvisations and new approaches.
269

“Jewish books” into your favorite search engine to find what you’re looking for.
Getting Help from Great Classic
and Contemporary Commentators
Throughout Jewish history, thousands of Torah commentaries have been
written. Most of these commentaries don’t accompany complete translations
of the Torah text; rather, they’re essays or books on selected details of the
Torah. There also are books containing commentaries on the various Jewish
holy days, on specific commandments appearing in the Torah, and on count-
less other topics from the Torah. As with Torah translations, I suggest that
you visit a good Jewish bookstore in order to build your library. You’ll be
amazed at the vast number of books on just about every possible subject
relating to topics found in the Torah. Remember, the Jewish people have
been known for centuries as “the people of the book.”

Part IV: The Importance of the Torah in Judaism 
Writing your own Torah commentary
I used to be a regular visitor to Biegeleisen’s, a
bookshop in New York City. It was a cramped,
multilevel shop with thousands of used Jewish
books piled high to the ceiling and so many piles
that it was almost impossible to walk around.
When flipping through old Hebrew books that
were once owned by students, I could always
see the margin notes written by the individuals
who had owned the volumes. From a cross-
reference in the margin to the place where a par-
ticular Torah verse or a similar one appears again
to some clarification of a difficult phrase or defi-
nition of some difficult vocabulary word, these
notes by book owners are Torah commentaries.
It’s the obligation of every student of the Torah
to write his or her own commentary. I’m not
referring to a commentary that’s worthy of being
published. Rather, it’s totally appropriate for
every Torah student to record insights, ques-
tions, and points of clarification in the margins
of their Jewish books, including the chumash.
This practice is comparable to highlighting and
making notes in college textbooks.
In the case of Torah study, active participation
and involvement by the student of the Torah is
essential. Remember that the blessing said
before beginning to study the Torah is a statement
of thanks to God for requiring that you la’asok
b’divrei Torah (la-ah-soak b’div-ray toe-rah; get
involved with the words of Torah).

Over the centuries, certain Jewish teachers and their teachings have
attracted great numbers of admirers. A handful of Torah commentators have
risen above all the others and have developed a strong authority by virtue of
the great numbers of people who use their commentaries and the influential
individuals who endorse them. In the following sections, I discuss five
absolute superstars in the world of Torah commentary. (The first three are
great sages from the past, and the last two are contemporary masters.)
Open and frequent disagreement exists among even the greatest of commen-
tators. You don’t have to look hard to find differences of opinion among the
greatest sages in Jewish history. Jewish tradition honors, encourages, and
respects diversity of opinion. Jewish tradition also considers the ability to
contain diverse points of view a virtue.
Rashi: You can’t read the 
Torah without him
Rabbi Shlomo Yitzchaki (1040–1105), known as Rashi (rah-she), was an 11th-
century rabbi who lived in France. His commentaries on the Five Books of
Moses and the Talmud (see Chapter 3) have both been elevated to the high-
est possible status: Throughout the generations, editions of the Five Books of
Moses produced by religious publishers have invariably contained at least
one commentary, and that commentary has generally been that of Rashi.
Many publications over the centuries have been referred to as “Chumash with
Rashi,” meaning the Five Books of Moses with Rashi’s brilliant commentary.
Today, if you go into a Jewish bookstore and ask for a “Chumash with Rashi,”
you’ll be offered several editions of this classic work of Jewish literature.
Rashi’s commentary is actually his selection of comments from rabbinic liter-
ature that reveal some of the most fundamental concepts in the Torah. Rashi
has a way of getting quickly to the point and anticipating common questions
that most typical Torah students have, clarifying just about every possible
question about the meaning of the text. He has a rare and uncanny ability to
make profound points and offer deep insights in simple, direct, and down-to-
earth language. Some say that Rashi provides the most basic and simplest
Torah commentary, whereas others insist that Rashi’s commentary is the
deepest and most profound. Still others recognize it as a wonderful guide
through the Torah.
271
Chapter 16: Studying the Torah with Translations and Commentaries

Abraham Ibn Ezra: A 12th-century
master commentator
Rabbi Abraham ben Meir Ibn Ezra (c. 1089–c. 1164) was a poet, philosopher,
grammarian, and biblical commentator during the Golden Age of Muslim Spain.
Ibn Ezra’s commentary on the Five Books of Moses is based largely on his
vast knowledge of Hebrew grammar and literature. It’s interesting to note that
Ibn Ezra often expressed skepticism of some traditional beliefs and antici-
pated some of the conclusions of modern scholarship. Several volumes of Ibn
Ezra’s commentary have been translated and published in English.
The Ramban: The Kabbalistic commentator
Thirteenth-century Rabbi Moses ben Nakhman Gerondi (1194–c. 1270), usu-
ally referred to as the Ramban (rahm-bahn), is often referred to as a mystic
known for his profound grasp of Kabbalah. His Torah commentary is decid-
edly spiritual and has earned a reputation as one of the most inspiring and
beloved of all Torah commentaries. A multivolume English translation of the
Ramban’s commentary is available in Jewish bookstores and Web sites. A
new edition, called The Torah: The Ramban’s Commentary is a projected mul-
tivolume edition that’s new on the market. Ramban: Commentary on the Torah
is a five-volume translation that is complete, but the translation isn’t as clear
as The Torah: The Ramban’s Commentary.
The Ramban’s Torah commentary deals in great detail with every aspect of the
Torah, from simple explanations about details of the text to mystical insights.
In his commentary, the Ramban often discusses and disagrees with the
commentaries of Rashi (see the earlier section) and Ibn Ezra (see the
preceding section).
272
Part IV: The Importance of the Torah in Judaism 
Name that Torah commentator!
In the world of Torah commentators, many of
the greatest superstars are known by names
created as acronyms. Here are a few examples:
 Raavad: Rabbi Avraham ben David
 Ram: Rabbi Meir ben Samuel
 Rambam: Rabbi Moses ben Maimon
 Ran: Rabbi Nissim ben Reuven
 Riban: Rabbi Judah ben Nathan
 Rif: Rabbi Isaac ben Jacob Alfasi
 Rosh: Rabbi Asher ben Jeheil

The Ramban’s commentary is an early example of a commentary that
includes the teachings of Kabbalah. He includes a number of Kabbalistic
interpretations, generally beginning them with the phrase “according to the
way of truth.” (If you would like to find out more about Kabbalah, be sure to
check out my book Kabbalah For Dummies, published by Wiley.)
Elie Wiesel: An inspirational 
modern commentator
Most people know Elie Wiesel for his Nobel Peace Prize; his best-selling memoir,
Night; or his appearances in the mass media. Many have no idea that this gifted
writer and teacher has had a lifelong passion for Torah study and is the author
of a contemporary Torah commentary that has inspired many.
For many years in New York City, Elie Wiesel has delivered a series of lectures
that, in part, take a close look at the Five Books of Moses. Messengers of God:
Biblical Portraits and Legends (Random House) is a collection of edited
transcripts of Wiesel’s discourses on the Torah. It’s a moving and profound
volume available in most major bookstores. It’s also worthwhile to explore
the many other books by Elie Wiesel. His writing is beautiful, his passion for
his subjects is legendary, and his love for and knowledge of the Torah is evident
in most of his books.
Rabbi Adin Steinsaltz: 
A contemporary genius
Rabbi Adin Steinsaltz of Jerusalem is considered one of the most influential
and brilliant rabbis alive today. He travels the world teaching when he’s not
writing one of his many profound books and commentaries. His Talmud com-
mentary is almost universally considered a work of genius within the Jewish
world, and many are confident that it will live on for centuries if not forever.
Rabbi Steinsaltz’s genius is evident in all his books. He’s able to express deep
and profound ideas through contemporary examples and analogies. He also
can contain many worlds within himself, and he displays this on every page
of his writings: He’s a man of God and a scientist, a master of the Talmud and
a master of Kabbalah, a man of faith and a skeptic, knowledgeable about the
most modern things and steeped in ancient tradition, often very funny and
deadly serious about life. Recently, 70 of the leading traditional rabbis in
Israel identified Rabbi Steinsaltz as the wisest rabbi of our time.
273
Chapter 16: Studying the Torah with Translations and Commentaries

Rabbi Steinsaltz has also written specifically on individual personalities in
the Torah and the issues that their lives and stories provoke. For example,
his remarks on the matriarch Sarah go far beyond the biblical narrative and
look at Sarah in a timeless way as the quintessential partner. His series of
radio lectures about biblical personalities exists in a collection called Biblical
Images. These lucid essays lead the reader to many of the revelations to be
found in the Torah. Another of his books specifically about aspects of the
Five Books of Moses is In the Beginning: Discourses on Hasidic Thought. In this
work, Rabbi Steinsaltz focuses on a number of episodes and issues in the
book of Genesis. If you wanted to explore the work of only one contemporary
Torah authority alive today, Rabbi Adin Steinsaltz would be your best choice.
Using Other Resources
to Study the Torah
A serious student of the Torah needs guidance from commentators who are
familiar with the ways of understanding the Torah and open it up to reveal its
wisdom. (I introduce you to several major commentators earlier in this chap-
ter.) A helpful way to begin studying the Torah is to focus on a small portion
of it at one time.
The Five Books of Moses is divided into 54 sections that correspond to the
weeks of the year (for some weeks, there are two Torah portions). Each week,
the corresponding Torah portion is read publicly in synagogues throughout
the world (see Chapter 13 for more about the Torah synagogue service). This
division of the Torah into 54 portions allows you to easily review the entire
Five Books of Moses within the cycle of one year. The individual who attends
a synagogue on Shabbat or follows the weekly divisions accumulates years of
Torah study as time passes. For example, I began to pay attention to the
Torah portion of the week approximately 30 years ago, so in a real sense I’ve
been through the entire Five Books of Moses at least 30 times.
Focusing on the Torah portion of the week is such a common practice among
Jews that I receive e-mails from individuals who are simply collecting their
thoughts on the Torah portion and offering their own synthesis and insights
to friends and colleagues studying the same portion.
I give you some guidance on studying the Torah in small doses with the help
of the resources in the following sections.

Checking out Jewish newspapers
There are dozens of Jewish newspapers available throughout the United States
and the world. For American readers, a visit to the American Jewish Press
Association Web site at ajpa.org reveals information on all the Jewish
newspapers in the country, most of which are published weekly and include
at least one column by a rabbi or teacher deriving lessons from the Torah por-
tion of the week. All these Jewish newspapers are available by subscription
through the mail.
Listening to the local rabbi’s sermon
Though not always the case, it’s often true that rabbis deliver sermons based
on the weekly Torah portion in their synagogues on Friday night and more
often on Saturday morning. Such a sermon is generally known as a d’var Torah
(d’vahr toe-rah; words of Torah) and consists simply of taking a word, verse, or
theme from the Torah text and looking at it closely. In the d’var Torah, the
rabbi usually tries to apply the wisdom of the verse to contemporary life.
275
Chapter 16: Studying the Torah with Translations and Commentaries

During the Shabbat morning prayer service, the Torah portion is read publicly
in the synagogue sanctuary and the rabbi offers his remarks immediately
afterward. Some rabbis even make a practice of coming down from the pulpit
into the congregation and continuing the discussion by asking for questions
and comments on the Torah portion from members of the congregation.

Part V
The Part of Tens

In this part . . .
E
very For Dummies book has a Part of Tens, and
there’s perhaps no better known “list of ten” than 
the Ten Commandments. To start out this part, I review
the Ten Commandments for you, showing you that there
are two slightly different versions in the Torah and that
different Christian denominations actually count the Ten
Commandments differently than Judaism does. In addition
to the Ten Commandments, many verses in the Torah
have become part of common knowledge; in this part, 
I quote from and explore ten different verses that are
often known by nonexperts but that are also commonly
misunderstood.

Chapter 17
The Ten Commandments
According to the Torah
In This Chapter
 Comparing the Torah’s two different versions of the Ten Commandments
 Gaining some insight into the true meaning of the Ten Commandments
A
lthough the Ten Commandments are probably the most well-known 
part of the Torah, you may not know an interesting fact about them: 
Two versions of the list are in the Torah itself — one in the book of Exodus
(see Chapter 5) and one in the book of Deuteronomy (see Chapter 8) — and
differences exist between the two lists. In principle, there are no redundancies
in the Torah, so when the great sages look at the Torah and see two different 
versions, they assume that the repetition is for a deliberate reason. In the case
of the Ten Commandments, the sages teach that both versions were heard at
the same time (like two different audio speakers in a stereo system). Each of
the differences has been carefully studied and analyzed in the Oral Torah.
In addition, different Christian denominations count the commandments 
differently from the traditional Jewish count. Here’s how it all shakes out:
 Roman Catholics, Lutherans, and Anglicans combine the first and
second commandments into one commandment, and they divide the
tenth into two commandments.
 Eastern Orthodox Christians combine the first commandment and the
first part of the second commandment into one commandment, leaving
the second part of the second commandment by itself. The rest of the
commandments are the same as those followed by Jews.
 Some Protestant groups don’t recognize the first commandment, and
they divide the second commandment into two (one being “You shall
have no other gods before Me” and the other “You shall not make for
yourself an idol”).

In this chapter, I present the two different versions of each commandment in
the Torah (some are identical while others are different), explain what they
mean, and explode some myths about them. But before I get into the details, 
I want to review some basic facts about the Torah’s Ten Commandments that
will help you to understand their place in Jewish tradition.
 In Hebrew, there’s no term that means “the ten commandments.” Instead,
the Hebrew phrase aseret hadibrot (ah-ser-et hah-dib-rote; the ten utter-
ances) is used to refer to the commandments. The significance of using
“utterances” rather than “commandments” is based on the mystical
teaching that God sustains the world at all times through divine speech
and that this speech, or utterances, consists of ten fundamental forces
that constantly create the world. On one level, these utterances form the
Ten Commandments, and on another level, they form the ten forces that
are the basis of all existence.
 The Ten Commandments are counted as part of the Torah’s 613 com-
mandments. Some sages teach that the Ten Commandments actually
contain all 613, whereas others organize the 613 commandments into 
ten groups corresponding to the Ten Commandments.
 Some sages teach that all the 248 positive commandments (see Appendix
B) are part of the first commandment (“I am the Lord your God”) and
that all the 365 negative commandments (see Appendix C) are part of
the second commandment (“You shall have no other gods before Me”).
 The first four commandments are between God and humans. The last 
six commandments are between people.
 According to Jewish law, the Ten Commandments in the Torah only
apply to Jews. According to the Torah, there are seven commandments
(some of which are the same as the Ten Commandments) that apply to
all people. (Chapter 4 covers these seven universal commandments
called the Noahide Laws.)
“I Am the Lord Your God . . .”
I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, from the
house of slavery.
Exodus 20:2
I am the Lord your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the
house of slavery.
Deuteronomy 5:6
280
Part V: The Part of Tens 

This first commandment doesn’t even sound like a commandment, but it’s
the most important one. The Torah sages understand this commandment 
to mean that it’s essential that you have a relationship with the Creator. As
the great Jewish philosopher Maimonides writes as the very first line of his
14-book masterpiece, the Mishneh Torah, “The foundation of all foundations
and the pillar of all wisdom is to know God.” (Turn to Chapter 2 for more
information about getting to know God.)
“You Shall Not Recognize Other 
Gods before Me . . .”
You shall not recognize other gods before Me. You shall not make for
yourself a carved image, or any likeness of what is in heaven above or on
the earth beneath or in the water under the earth. You shall not prostrate
yourself to them or serve them; for I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God,
visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children, on the third and the fourth
generations for My enemies but showing loving kindness for thousands of
generations, to those who love Me and keep My commandments.
Exodus 20:3–6
You shall have no other gods before Me. You shall not make for yourself an
idol, or any likeness of what is in heaven above or on the earth beneath or
in the water under the earth. You shall not worship them or serve them; for 
I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on
the children, and on the third and the fourth generations of those who hate
Me, but showing loving kindness to thousands, to those who love Me and
keep My commandments.
Deuteronomy 5:7–10
Jewish tradition understands the commandment as urging people not to limit
their conception of God in any way. God is beyond all conceptions and can’t
be represented, even symbolically, by an object. As one of my teachers said,
“If you think you grasp God, one thing is certain: You’re wrong.”
“You Shall Not Take the Name of 
the Lord Your God in Vain . . .”
You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain, for the Lord will
not leave him unpunished who takes His name in vain.
Exodus 20:7 and Deuteronomy 5:11
281
Chapter 17: The Ten Commandments According to the Torah

Jewish tradition views the spoken word with the utmost seriousness. For
example, Jewish law considers embarrassing someone in public with your
words equal to murder (see Chapter 9 for more details). An oath or a promise
is a reality in the world and shouldn’t be taken lightly. Therefore, using God’s
name in an oath or promise that goes unfulfilled is a serious error.
“Remember the Sabbath Day, 
to Keep It Holy . . .”
Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days you shall labor and do
all your work, but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the Lord your God; you
shall not do any work, you or your son or your daughter, your male or your
female servant, your animal or your stranger within your gates. For in six
days the Lord made the heavens and the earth, the sea and all that is in
them, and He rested on the seventh day; therefore the Lord blessed the
Sabbath day and made it holy.
Exodus 20:8–11
Guard the Sabbath day to keep it holy, as the Lord your God commanded 
you. Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is a
Sabbath of the Lord your God; in it you shall not do any work, you or your son
or your daughter or your male servant or your female servant or your ox or
your donkey or any of your cattle or your sojourner who stays with you, so
that your male servant and your female servant may rest as well as you. You
shall remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt, and the Lord your
God brought you out of there by a mighty hand and by an outstretched arm;
therefore the Lord your God commanded you to observe the Sabbath day.
Deuteronomy 5:12–15
The most obvious difference between the two versions of the Ten
Commandments shows up in this commandment. One version tells you 
to remember the Sabbath, and the other tells you to guard it. Some sages 
reconcile the difference by teaching that God spoke both words at the same
time. There’s a Jewish custom of lighting at least two candles to usher in
Shabbat: one for the word “remember” and the other for the word “guard.”
In Jewish life, the two words have very different meanings.
 On the Sabbath, Jews remember the Sabbath by lighting candles and
saying a blessing over a glass of wine on Friday night.
 All the laws that help Jews to preserve the Sabbath as a day of rest (like
not spending money on the Sabbath and not taking a ride in a car) are
ways of guarding the Sabbath.
282
Part V: The Part of Tens 

See Chapter 11 for more about this important day.
“Honor Your Father and 
Your Mother . . .”
Honor your father and your mother, so that your days may be prolonged in
the land which the Lord your God gives you.
Exodus 20:12
Honor your father and your mother, as the Lord your God has commanded
you, that your days may be prolonged and that it may go well with you on
the land which the Lord your God gives you.
Deuteronomy 5:16
Honoring your parents doesn’t mean obeying your parents. Instead, the great
rabbinic sages say that grown children should make sure that their parents
are provided for and treated with respect. As for decisions about your life,
you can disobey your parents and still honor them. How? One example is that
if your parents tell you to do something that’s forbidden by Jewish law, you
must not obey your parents. The two words “honor” and “obey” simply have
different meaning in Jewish life. This is similar to the advice I’ve always given
my children about their relationships with their schoolteachers: Feel free to
disagree with them, but always do it with respect. In the same way, you can
honor your parents, treating them with care and kindness, without having to
obey them.
“You Shall Not Murder”
You shall not murder.
Exodus 20:13 and Deuteronomy 5:17
This commandment is often mistranslated as “You shall not kill.” But there
are many reasons to kill, including killing in self-defense and killing in the 
context of war. According to Jewish law, if someone is about to kill you, you
have an obligation to stop them and perhaps kill them first. “You shall not
murder,” on the other hand, refers to killing as an act of violence.
The potential murderer is called a rodef (row-deaf; pursuer). Jewish law insists
that a pursuer can be stopped by killing him first. According to Jewish law, the
act of killing someone who is about to murder you isn’t considered murder.
283
Chapter 17: The Ten Commandments According to the Torah

“You Shall Not Commit Adultery”
You shall not commit adultery.
Exodus 20:13 and Deuteronomy 5:17
In biblical times, polygamy was permitted, so the classic interpretation of this
commandment defines adultery as a married woman having sexual relations
with a man other than her husband. When the great rabbis outlawed polygamy
among European Jews, the definition of adultery was also broadened to include
a married man who has sexual relations with a woman other than his wife.
“You Shall Not Steal”
You shall not steal.
Exodus 20:13 and Deuteronomy 5:17
In the original context of the Ten Commandments, stealing means stealing
people, commonly known as kidnapping. Of course it’s also forbidden to take
what’s not yours, but the traditional definition was kidnapping. Today, it
includes robbery and even extends to dishonest business practices.
“You Shall Not Bear False Witness
Against Your Neighbor”
You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.
Exodus 20:13 and Deuteronomy 5:17
“Bearing false witness” sounds much fancier than it is. Basically, it means that
you shouldn’t lie, in a court or out of it. The exception is the minor, white lie —
the Jewish sages who interpreted the Ten Commandments understood that
sometimes a white lie is necessary to protect a person’s feelings. For example,
the Oral Torah (see Chapter 3) teaches that if you don’t think a bride is beauti-
ful, you should tell her that she is anyway. Similarly, if you visit a dying person
in the hospital, you shouldn’t say, “You look terrible” even if that’s the case.
284
Part V: The Part of Tens 

“You Shall Not Covet Your 
Neighbor’s House . . .”
You shall not covet your neighbor’s house; you shall not covet your
neighbor’s wife or his male servant or his female servant or his ox or his
donkey or anything that belongs to your neighbor.
Exodus 20:14
You shall not covet your neighbor’s wife, and you shall not desire your
neighbor’s house, his field or his male servant or his female servant, his ox
or his donkey or anything that belongs to your neighbor.
Deuteronomy 5:18
One good ground rule for envy, according to the Torah, is this: If you envy
someone and covet something that he has, imagine that you would have 
to trade places with the person in every aspect of his life. Don’t just stop at
imagining having another person’s money or good looks; imagine that if you
had his money, you would also have his body, parents, occupation, and
problems.

Ten Frequently Misunderstood
Quotes from the Torah
In This Chapter
 Discovering some misunderstandings about the Torah
 Understanding the real meanings of some famous Torah verses
T
here’s no question that the Torah has been misquoted, misunderstood,
and slandered over the centuries. There are many reasons for this:
 Anti-Semites looking for ways to justify their hatred and prejudice take
the easy route of quoting something out of context in order to distort its
meaning.
 People generally don’t know how to approach the Torah, which isn’t just
another book. Rather, Jews view the Torah as God’s instruction book
that contains the most profound ideas and sublime secrets of existence.
Because the Torah is written and constructed in a unique way, only a
serious student who’s willing to learn how the book works can truly
pierce through its layers.
 Many people can’t get past the fact that, in principle, there are many
levels of meaning to every letter, every word, every sentence, and every
story in the Torah. People think that if a text says something, then that’s
what it means, pure and simple. In reality, the Torah may be pure, but it
certainly isn’t simple.
The ten quotes in this chapter are among the most misunderstood in the Five
Books of Moses. By seeing how these verses have been misunderstood, you
can begin to understand just how the Torah needs to be read — with caution
and with the aid of highly regarded commentators whose observations have
stood the test of time. Chapter 15 has more information on analyzing the
Torah; Chapter 16 introduces you to well-known Torah commentators.

“And God Said, Let Us Make Man in 
Our Image, after Our Likeness”
Confusion about this Torah verse from Genesis 1:26 arises from two points:
 God is not physical, so any literal understanding of this verse is simply
incorrect. God isn’t a person and has no physicality.
 The verse says, “Let us” but doesn’t say who the “us” refers to.
Many Torah commentators have explained that the one way in which humans
are made in God’s image is through the human power of free will, the power to
create and destroy. Every other creature, large and small, is part of the stage on
which the one actor with freedom — humans — act. Humans weren’t created
to look like God (Who has no physical appearance); rather, free will is how
they’re made in God’s image.
The Oral Torah (see Chapter 3) addresses why the verse says “Let us make
man. . . .” When Moses wrote the Torah as dictated by God, Moses said to God,
“Why are you giving people an opportunity, with Your use of the plural ‘us,’ to
claim that there is more than one God?” God responded to Moses by saying,
“Keep writing. Whoever wishes to make that mistake will make it. Those who
want to make the effort will come to understand that it is with the ministering
angels that God has consulted.”
The Jewish sages teach that this response by God contained two lessons:
 When considering a major project, it’s wise to consult with others.
 There will always be people who want to distort the text. People who
want to understand the Torah will pursue it and will understand it,
whereas those who want to distort the Torah will always be able to find
a way if that’s what they truly want to do.
Another explanation of this quote is connected with the idea that humans are a
microcosm of the universe. The Oral Torah teaches that each person is a whole
world. When God created humans, He brought together aspects of everything,
so each person contains an aspect of every element in the universe.
“Am I My Brother’s Keeper?”
Many people think that the answer to the question, “Am I my brother’s
keeper?” is “no.” I once heard someone say, “Leave me alone. I don’t want 
to get involved. Am I my brother’s keeper?” If fact, the Torah says that the
opposite is true.
288
Part V: The Part of Tens 

The first murder in human history is recorded in the first book of the Torah,
the book of Genesis. In Genesis 4:9, the Torah records that Adam and Eve had
a number of children, Cain and Abel being the first two. Cain murdered Abel,
and the Torah says that God asked, “Where is your brother Abel?”
Cain responded to the question by asking, “Am I my brother’s keeper?,” which
in Hebrew is, “Ha shomer achi anokhi?” Cain chose a strange word for “I”:
anokhi (ah-no-khee). The great Torah sages explain that the word “anokhi” is
the same word for “I” that God used to refer to Himself at the beginning of the
Ten Commandments. In other words, Cain was really saying, “Isn’t God Abel’s
keeper?”
God asked about Abel’s whereabouts in order to give Cain an opportunity 
to confess, and Cain failed to do so. Jewish tradition is emphatic about the
answer to the question: Am I my brother’s keeper? Am I responsible for other
Jews, all of whom are family members? The answer is simple: Yes!
“Two by Two They Came to Noah 
into the Ark, Male and Female”
It’s a commonly held belief that Noah built an ark and gathered two of each
animal onto it. But the Torah doesn’t say as much. The Torah says that Noah
first gathered two of each animal, one male and one female. But Noah also
gathered seven pairs of “clean” animals — that is, animals that were permissi-
ble to be offered as a sacrifice on the holy altar. As the Torah says, “You shall
take with you of every clean animal by sevens, a male and his female; and of
the animals that are not clean two, a male and his female” (Genesis 7:2). The
unclean animals came two by two into the ark in Genesis 7:9.
“God Is a Man of War”
One of the great myths and distortions regarding the Torah is the idea that 
the God of the Torah is a vengeful God, whereas the God of the New Testament
is a God of love. Quotes like “God is a man of war,” from Exodus 15:3, seem to
reinforce this profoundly incorrect idea.
A fundamental idea within Jewish thought is that there’s no hierarchy of emo-
tions. All emotions, like love, hate, pride, generosity, and so on, are on the same
level and are considered good or bad not by what they are but rather by how
they’re used. Emotions are like medicine in that timing and dosage are all that
keep a medication from being a poison.

Chapter 18: Ten Frequently Misunderstood Quotes from the Torah

According to the tradition of the Torah, sometimes love is exactly what a situ-
ation calls for, but at other times, love is absolutely inappropriate. Similarly,
sometimes hate is wrong, and sometimes hate is just what’s needed.
The idea that everything God does is for the best, even when you can’t see 
it, is a basic point of Jewish theology. God as a “man” of war isn’t a bad thing
because God knows what every situation calls for and provides just what’s
necessary.
“An Eye for Eye, a Tooth for Tooth . . .”
The full verse from Exodus 21:24–25 is
An eye for eye, a tooth for tooth, a hand for hand, a foot for foot, a burn for
burn, a wound for wound, a bruise for a bruise.
This verse from the Torah is possibly the most misquoted and misunderstood
verse in the entire Five Books of Moses, and it’s the best example I know of how
you simply can’t understand the Torah without a commentary. Jewish justice
never takes this verse literally, and no Jewish court in the long history of the
Jewish people ever made a ruling based on a literal grasp of this verse.
According to the Oral Torah, this verse actually means that monetary com-
pensation is required for damages. Of course a person must also confess 
and express regret to God, but the way to be compensated by someone who
injures you is not to injure them. Rather, you take the case to court, and if the
court agrees, the person who did the damage must pay you as compensation.
“You Shall Not Lie with a Man as with 
a Woman: It Is an Abomination”
This verse from the Torah (Leviticus 18:22) is a controversial one and is cited
as proof that homosexuality is forbidden according to Jewish law. Of course,
two men can love one another, touch one another, embrace, kiss, hold hands,
and express verbal affection without being homosexual.
Although many commentators use this verse to condemn homosexuality,
some commentators point out that the verse is a specific reference to anal
intercourse. According to the sages, the bias against homosexuality is based
on the fact that two males can’t participate in the sacred act of creating life.
My Torah teachers have taught me to avoid transgressions but not to hate
those who transgress.

Part V: The Part of Tens 

“You Shall Love Your Neighbor 
as Yourself”
The Talmudic sage Rabbi Akiva went from being an ignorant and illiterate
shepherd to becoming one of the greatest teachers and visionaries of Jewish
history. Rabbi Akiva said that this verse in Leviticus 19:18 was the essence of
the Torah. This quote is often attributed to Jesus of Nazareth, but its appear-
ance in the Torah means that it pre-dates Jesus. Of course, Jesus was a Jew
and was presumably quite familiar with the verse and therefore knew its
importance among the great Torah sages.
The famous Golden Rule, which states “Do unto others as you would have
others do unto you,” is a twist on a well-known statement that predates Jesus.
An early Jewish sage called Hillel (born 70 BCE) said, “What is hateful to you,
do not do to your neighbor. This is the essence of the Torah. The rest is 
commentary.”
The New Testament in general and Jesus in particular quote from the Torah
dozens of times. Over the centuries, many people have gotten the impression
that these verses are exclusively from Christian scriptures and are unaware
of the fact that they’re actually from the Torah.
“For the Lord Thy God Is a Jealous God”
In the Torah, God often is given human attributes, both physical and emo-
tional. For example, the Torah says that God stretched out His arm, that His
eye looked at the world, and that He was jealous. Of course none of these 
references should be taken literally. God has no physical form, nor does God
have an emotional life that’s in any way similar to humans’.
A basic principle of Torah study found in the Oral Torah says, “The Torah
speaks in the language of man.” In other words, no number of words, no elo-
quent vocabulary, and no human effort can possibly grasp God or describe
God. As one of my teachers points out, if you think you grasp God, then one
thing is true: You are wrong.
When the Torah uses “human” words like “jealous” in this verse from
Deuteronomy 6:15, it’s trying to express something in human terms because
there’s simply no better way. As I say many times in this book, the person 
who reads the Torah and just takes it literally is doing it wrong!

Chapter 18: Ten Frequently Misunderstood Quotes from the Torah

“For You Are a People Holy 
to the Lord Your God . . .”
The full verse from Deuteronomy 7:6 is
For you are a people holy to the Lord your God; the Lord your God has
chosen you to be for Him a treasured people above all the peoples that 
are on the face of the earth.
One of the most misunderstood ideas in all Jewish history has to do with the
“chosen people.” This notion has absolutely nothing to do with superiority.
Nothing!
Jewish writings explain the label “chosen people” as follows: God selected
the Children of Israel to take on an extra burden of observing the 613 com-
mandments and relating to the world as a priesthood. Think of the chosen
people like this: You have several children and select one of them to do a lot
more work and to accept more responsibilitiy than the others — not because
that one child is better or a favorite but because of some other reasons that
only you know.
With so many added responsibilities, the possibility for failure is much greater,
and the Jewish people have often largely failed at the assignment. Only when
Jews are permitted and able to accept their assignment and succeed will God’s
plan for the world come to pass. It’s as though the Jewish people are one vital
organ in the body of the peoples of the world; if that one organ is unable to 
perform its function in a healthy way, the rest of the body also suffers.
“You Must Not Make Your 
Brother Pay Interest . . .”
The full verse from Deuteronomy 23:20–21 is
You must not make your brother pay interest, interest on money, interest on
food, interest on anything on which one may claim interest. You may make
a foreigner [Gentile] pay interest but your brother [fellow Jew] you must not
make pay interest.
I have heard it said many times that the Torah forbids lending money and
charging interest. But a careful reading of both verses indicates that not
charging interest only pertains to people within the Jewish family. While this
may seem offensive and prejudicial at first glance, a full understanding of the
Torah as a document for the Jewish people helps to clarify the situation.
292
Part V: The Part of Tens 

As I point out many times in this book, the Jewish people aren’t a religion or 
a race. The Jewish people are a family. As the Torah explains, this family, all
of whom descend from Abraham, began as 70 people who went to Egypt and
ultimately grew into a nation of millions.
Certainly each person relates to family members differently than he or she
does to strangers. For example, I’m much more apt to lend money without
interest to my cousin than to someone I don’t know. Of course, I can choose
whether to lend money without interest to a non–family member, but the
Torah says that when it comes to family members I have no choice. Families
must support one another. The highest form of charity in Jewish tradition is
lending money to help someone to be able to help himself.

Appendix B
The 248 Positive Commandments
in the Torah
T
he Oral Torah teaches that the Five Books of Moses contain 613 command-
ments; that number consists of 248 positive commandments and 365 nega-
tive commandments. In other words, the list in this appendix summarizes the
actions that the Torah wants you to do, and in Appendix C, you can find those
things the Torah wants to make sure you don’t do.
There are several things you need to know about these two lists:
 Various Torah sages throughout history have disagreed as to precisely
what these 613 commandments are. There’s no definitive list. My list
generally follows the list of Rabbi Moses ben Maimon, known as
Maimonides.
 Judaism 101 (www.jewfaq.org), a wonderful Web site maintained by
scholar and law librarian Tracey R. Rich, provides an extremely useful
and educational way of breaking down the commandments into general
topics. I’ve based my list on this terrific way of organizing the Torah’s
commandments.
 I don’t quote the Torah word for word in these appendixes; rather, 
I paraphrase the verses in the interest of space.
 You may notice that the Torah verses in my lists often aren’t in chapter
and verse order. Instead, the order of the commandments in these lists
flows from topic to topic in the way that I think makes the most sense.
Even though the verses sometimes seem to be out of order, the fact is
that the Torah doesn’t present the commandments in any apparent
order (nor are events recorded in the Torah in chronological order).
 If you were to look at the actual verses, you may wonder why they don’t
seem to always say what I’ve indicated. This is because I provide you with
the interpretations of these verses by the great Torah sages throughout
history — not necessarily the literal meaning.
