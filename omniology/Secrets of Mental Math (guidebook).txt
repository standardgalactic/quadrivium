The Secrets of Mental Math
Scope:
M
ost of the mathematics that we learn in school is taught to us on 
paper with the expectation that we will solve problems on paper. 
But there is joy and lifelong value in being able to do mathematics 
in your head. In school, learning how to do math in your head quickly and 
accurately can be empowering. In this course, you will learn to solve many 
problems using multiple strategies that reinforce number sense, which can 
be helpful in all mathematics courses. Success at doing mental calculation 
and estimation can also lead to improvement on several standardized tests. 
We encounter numbers on a daily basis outside of school, including many 
situations in which it is just not practical to pull out a calculator, from buying 
groceries to reading the newspaper to negotiating a car payment. And as we 
get older, research has shown that it is important to ¿ nd activities that keep 
our minds active and sharp. Not only does mental math sharpen the mind, 
but it can also be a lot of fun. 
Our ¿ rst four lectures will focus on the nuts and bolts of mental math: 
addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Often, we will see that 
there is more than one way to solve a problem, and we will motivate many of 
the problems with real-world applications. 
Once we have mastery of the basics of mental math, we will branch out 
in interesting directions. Lecture 5 offers techniques for easily ¿ nding 
approximate answers when we don’t need complete accuracy. Lecture 6 is 
devoted to pencil-and-paper mathematics but done in ways that are seldom 
taught in school; we’ll see that we can simply write down the answer to a 
multiplication, division, or square root problem without any intermediate 
results. This lecture also shows some interesting ways to verify an answer’s 
correctness. In Lecture 7, we go beyond the basics to explore advanced 
multiplication techniques that allow many large multiplication problems to 
be dramatically simpli¿ ed.

Scope
2
In Lecture 8, we explore long division, short division, and Vedic division, 
a fascinating technique that can be used to generate answers faster than 
any method you may have seen before. Lecture 9 will teach you how to 
improve your memory for numbers using a phonetic code. Applying this 
code allows us to perform even larger mental calculations, but it can also be 
used for memorizing dates, phone numbers, and your favorite mathematical 
constants. Speaking of dates, one of my favorite feats of mental calculation 
is being able to determine the day of the week of any date in history. This is 
actually a very useful skill to possess. It’s not every day that someone asks 
you for the square root of a number, but you probably encounter dates every 
day of your life, and it is quite convenient to be able to ¿ gure out days of the 
week. You will learn how to do this in Lecture 10.
In Lecture 11, we venture into the world of advanced multiplication; here, 
we’ll see how to square 3- and 4-digit numbers, ¿ nd approximate cubes of 
2-digit numbers, and multiply 2- and 3-digit numbers together. In our ¿ nal 
lecture, you will learn how to do enormous calculations, such as multiplying 
two 5-digit numbers, and discuss the techniques used by other world-
record lightning calculators. Even if you do not aspire to be a grandmaster 
mathemagician, you will still bene¿ t tremendously by acquiring the skills 
taught in this course. Ŷ

Lecture 1: Math in Your Head! 
Math in Your Head! 
Lecture 1
Just by watching this course, you will learn all the techniques that are 
required to become a fast mental calculator, but if you want to actually 
improve your calculating abilities, then just like with any skill, you 
need to practice.
I
n school, most of the math we learn is done with pencil and paper, yet in 
many situations, it makes more sense to do problems in your head. The 
ability to do rapid mental calculation can help students achieve higher 
scores on standardized tests and can keep the mind sharp as we age. 
One of the ¿ rst mental math tips you can practice is to calculate from left 
to right, rather than right to left. On paper, you might add 2300 + 45 from 
right to left, but in your head, it’s more natural and faster to add from left 
to right.
These lectures assume that you know the multiplication table, but there are 
some tricks to memorizing it that may be of interest to parents and teachers. 
I teach students the multiples of 3, for example, by ¿ rst having them practice 
counting by 3s, then giving them 
the multiplication problems in 
order (3 × 1, 3 × 2 …) so that they 
associate the problems with the 
counting sequence. Finally, I mix 
up the problems so that the students 
can practice them out of sequence.
There’s also a simple trick to 
multiplying by 9s: The multiples of 
9 have the property that their digits add up to 9 (9 × 2 = 18 and 1 + 8 = 9). 
Also, the ¿ rst digit of the answer when multiplying by 9 is 1 less than the 
multiplier (e.g., 9 × 3 = 27 begins with 2). 
The ability to do rapid mental 
calculation can help students 
achieve higher scores on 
standardized tests and can 
keep the mind sharp as we age.

5
In many ways, mental calculation is a process of simpli¿ cation. For example, 
the problem 432 × 3 sounds hard, but it’s the sum of three easy problems: 
3 × 400 = 1200, 3 × 30 = 90, and 3 × 2 = 6; 1200 + 90 + 6 = 1296. Notice 
that when adding the numbers, it’s easier to add from largest to smallest, 
rather than smallest to largest. 
Again, doing mental calculations from left to right is also generally easier 
because that’s the way we read numbers. Consider 54 × 7. On paper, you 
might start by multiplying 7 × 4 to get 28, but when doing the problem 
mentally, it’s better to start with 7 × 50 (350) to get an estimate of the answer. 
To get the exact answer, add the product of 7 × 50 and the product of 7 × 4: 
350 + 28 = 378.
Below are some additional techniques that you can start using right away:
x
The product of 11 and any 2-digit number begins and ends with the 
two digits of the multiplier; the number in the middle is the sum of 
the original two digits. Example: 23 × 11 ĺ 2 + 3 = 5; answer: 253. 
For a multiplier whose digits sum to a number greater than 9, you 
have to carry. Example: 85 × 11 ĺ 8 + 5 = 13; carry the 1 from 13 
to the 8; answer: 935.
x
The product of 11 and any 3-digit number also begins and ends 
with the ¿ rst and last digits of the multiplier, although the ¿ rst 
digit can change from carries. In the middle, insert the result of 
adding the ¿ rst and second digits and the second and third digits. 
Example: 314 × 11 ĺ 3 + 1 = 4 and 1 + 4 = 5; answer: 3454.
x
To square a 2-digit number that ends in 5, multiply the ¿ rst 
digit in the number by the next higher digit, then attach 25 at 
the end. Example: 352 ĺ 3 × 4 = 12; answer: 1225. For 3-digit 
numbers, multiply the ¿ rst two numbers together by the next 
higher number, then attach 25. Example: 3052 ĺ 30 × 31 = 930; 
answer: 93,025.

6
Lecture 1: Math in Your Head! 
x
To multiply two 2-digit numbers that have the same ¿ rst digits 
and last digits that sum to 10, multiply the ¿ rst digit by the next 
higher digit, then attach the product of the last digits in the original 
two numbers. Example: 84 × 86 ĺ 8 × 9 = 72 and 4 × 6 = 24; 
answer: 7224.
x
To multiply a number between 10 and 20 by a 1-digit number, 
multiply the 1-digit number by 10, then multiply it by the second 
digit in the 2-digit number, and add the products. Example: 13 × 6 
ĺ (6 × 10) + (6 × 3) = 60 + 18; answer: 78.
x
To multiply two numbers that are both between 10 and 20, add the 
¿ rst number and the last digit of the second number, multiply the 
result by 10, then add that result to the product of the last digits in 
both numbers of the original problem. Example: 13 × 14 ĺ 13 + 4 
= 17, 17 × 10 = 170, 3 × 4 = 12, 170 + 12 = 182; answer: 182. Ŷ

Mental Addition and Subtraction 
Lecture 2
The bad news is that most 3-digit subtraction problems require some 
sort of borrowing. But the good news is that they can be turned into 
easy addition problems.
W
hen doing mental addition, we work one digit at a time. To add a 
1-digit number, just add the 1s digits (52 + 4 ĺ 2 + 4 = 6, so 52 + 
4 = 56). With 2-digit numbers, ¿ rst add the 10s digits, then the 1s 
digits (62 + 24 ĺ 62 + 20 = 82 and 82 + 4 = 86). 
With 3-digit numbers, addition is easy when one or both numbers are 
multiples of 100 (400 + 567 = 967) or when both numbers are multiples of 
10 (450 + 320 ĺ 450 + 300 = 750 and 750 + 20 = 770). Adding in this way 
is useful if you’re counting calories.
To add 3-digit numbers, ¿ rst add the 100s, then the 10s, then the 1s. For 314 
+ 159, ¿ rst add 314 + 100 = 414. The problem is now simpler, 414 + 59; 
keep the 400 in mind and focus on 14 + 59. Add 14 + 50 = 64, then add 9 to 
get 73. The answer to the original problem is 473.
We could do 766 + 489 by adding the 100s, 10s, and 1s digits, but each 
step would involve a carry. Another way to do the problem is to notice that 
489 = 500 – 11; we can add 766 + 500, then subtract 11 (answer: 1255). 
Addition problems that involve carrying can often be turned into easy 
subtraction problems.
With mental subtraction, we also work one digit at a time from left to right. 
With 74 – 29, ¿ rst subtract 74 – 20 = 54. We know the answer to 54 – 9 will 
be 40-something, and 14 – 9 = 5, so the answer is 45. 
A subtraction problem that would normally involve borrowing can usually 
be turned into an easy addition problem with no carrying. For 121 – 57, 
subtract 60, then add back 3: 121 – 60 = 61 and 61 + 3 = 64.

12
Lecture 2: Mental Addition and Subtraction 
With 3-digit numbers, we again subtract the 100s, the 10s, then the 1s. For 
846 – 225, ¿ rst subtract 200: 846 – 200 = 646. Keep the 600 in mind, then do 
46 – 25 by subtracting 20, then subtracting 5: 46 – 20 = 26 and 26 – 5 = 21. 
The answer is 621.
Three-digit subtraction problems can often be turned into easy addition 
problems. For 835 – 497, treat 497 as 500 – 3. Subtract 835 – 500, then add 
back 3: 835 – 500 = 335 and 335 + 3 = 338.
Understanding complements helps in doing dif¿ cult subtraction. The 
complement of 75 is 25 because 75 + 25 = 100. To ¿ nd the complement 
of a 2-digit number, ¿ nd the 
number that when added to the 
¿ rst digit will yield 9 and the 
number that when added to the 
second digit will yield 10. For 
75, notice that 7 + 2 = 9 and 
5 + 5 = 10. If the number ends in 0, such as 80, then the complement will 
also end in 0. In this case, ¿ nd the number that when added to the ¿ rst digit 
will yield 10 instead of 9; the complement of 80 is 20.
Knowing that, let’s try 835 – 467. We ¿ rst subtract 500 (835 – 500 = 335), 
but then we need to add back something. How far is 467 from 500, or how 
far is 67 from 100? Find the complement of 67 (33) and add it to 335: 
335 + 33 = 368. 
To ¿ nd 3-digit complements, ¿ nd the numbers that will yield 9, 9, 10 when 
added to each of the digits. For example, the complement of 234 is 766. 
Exception: If the original number ends in 0, so will its complement, and the 
0 will be preceded by the 2-digit complement. For example, the complement 
of 670 will end in 0, preceded by the complement of 67, which is 33; the 
complement of 670 is 330. 
Three-digit complements are used frequently in making change. If an 
item costs $6.75 and you pay with a $10 bill, the change you get will be 
the complement of 675, namely, 325, $3.25. The same strategy works with 
change from $100. What’s the change for $23.58? For the complement of 
Understanding complements helps 
in doing dif¿ cult subtraction.

13
2358, the digits must add to 9, 9, 9, and 10. The change would be $76.42. 
When you hear an amount like $23.58, think that the dollars add to 99 and 
the cents add to 100. With $23.58, 23 + 76 = 99 and 58 + 42 = 100. When 
making change from $20, the idea is essentially the same, but the dollars add 
to 19 and the cents add to 100.
As you practice mental addition and subtraction, remember to work one 
digit at a time and look for opportunities to use complements that turn hard 
addition problems into easy subtraction problems and vice versa. Ŷ
complement: The distance between a number and a convenient round 
number, typically, 100 or 1000. For example, the complement of 43 is 57 
since 43 + 57 = 100.

Go Forth and Multiply 
Lecture 3
You’ve now seen everything you need to know about doing 3-digit-
by-1-digit multiplication. … [T]he basic idea is always the same. We 
calculate from left to right, and add numbers as we go.
O
nce you’ve mastered the multiplication table up through 10, you 
can multiply any two 1-digit numbers together. The next step is to 
multiply 2- and 3-digit numbers by 1-digit numbers. As we’ll see, 
these 2-by-1s and 3-by-1s are the essential building blocks to all mental 
multiplication problems. Once you’ve mastered those skills, you will be able 
to multiply any 2-digit numbers. 
We know how to multiply 1-digit numbers by numbers below 20, so let’s 
warm up by doing a few simple 2-by-1 problems. For example, try 53 × 6. 
We start by multiplying 6 × 50 to get 300, then keep that 300 in mind. We 
know the answer will not change to 400 because the next step is to add the 
result of a 1-by-1 problem: 6 × 3. A 1-by-1 problem can’t get any larger than 
9 × 9, which is less than 100. Since 6 × 3 = 18, the answer to our original 
problem, 53 × 6, is 318.
Here’s an area problem: Find the area of a triangle with a height of 14 inches 
and a base of 59 inches. The formula here is 1/2(bh), so we have to calculate 
1/2 × (59 × 14). The commutative law allows us to multiply numbers in 
any order, so we rearrange the problem to (1/2 × 14) × 59. Half of 14 is 7, 
leaving us with the simpli¿ ed problem 7 × 59. We multiply 7 × 50 to get 
350, then 7 × 9 to get 63; we then add 350 + 63 = to get 413 square inches 
in the triangle. Another way to do the same calculation is to treat 59 × 7 as 
(7 × 60) – (7 × 1): 7 × 60 = 420 and 7 × 1 = 7; 420 – 7 = 413. This approach 
turns a hard addition problem into an easy subtraction problem. When you’re 
¿ rst practicing mental math, it’s helpful to do such problems both ways; if 
you get the same answer both times, you can be pretty sure it’s right.

22
Lecture 3: Go Forth and Multiply 
The goal of mental math is to solve the problem without writing anything 
down. At ¿ rst, it’s helpful to be able to see the problem, but as you gain 
skill, allow yourself to see only half of the problem. Enter the problem on 
a calculator, but don’t hit the equals button until you have an answer. This 
allows you to see one number but not the other.
The distributive law tells us that 3 × 87 is the same as (3 × 80) + (3 × 7), 
but here’s a more intuitive way to think about this concept: Imagine we have 
three bags containing 87 marbles each. Obviously, we have 3 × 87 marbles. 
But suppose we know that in each bag, 80 of the marbles are blue and 7 
are crimson. The total number of marbles is still 3 × 87, but we can also 
think of the total as 3 × 80 (the number 
of blue marbles) and 3 × 7 (the number 
of crimson marbles). Drawing a picture 
can also help in understanding the 
distributive law.
We now turn to multiplying 3-digit 
numbers by 1-digit numbers. Again, we 
begin with a few warm-up problems. For 
324 × 7, we start with 7 × 300 to get 2100. Then we do 7 × 20, which is 140. 
We add the ¿ rst two results to get 2240; then we do 7 × 4 to get 28 and add 
that to 2240. The answer is 2268. One of the virtues of working from left to 
right is that this method gives us an idea of the overall answer; working from 
right to left tells us only what the last number in the answer will be. Another 
good reason to work from left to right is that you can often say part of the 
answer while you’re still calculating, which helps to boost your memory. 
Once you’ve mastered 2-by-1 and 3-by-1 multiplication, you can actually 
do most 2-by-2 multiplication problems, using the factoring method. Most 
2-digit numbers can be factored into smaller numbers, and we can often take 
advantage of this. Consider the problem 23 × 16. When you see 16, think 
of it as 8 × 2, which makes the problem 23 × (8 × 2). First, multiply by 8 (8 
× 20 = 160 and 8 × 3 = 24; 160 + 24 = 184), then multiply 184 × 2 to get 
the answer to the original problem, 368. We could also do this problem by 
thinking of 16 as 2 × 8 or as 4 × 4.
Most 2-digit numbers can 
be factored into smaller 
numbers, and we can often 
take advantage of this.

23
For most 2-by-1 and 3-by-1 multiplication problems, we use the addition 
method, but sometimes it may be faster to use subtraction. By practicing 
these skills, you will be able to move on to multiplying most 2-digit 
numbers together. Ŷ
addition method: A method for multiplying numbers by breaking the 
problem into sums of numbers. For example, 4 × 17 = (4 × 10) + (4 × 7) 
= 40 + 28 = 68, or 41 × 17 = (40 × 17) + (1 × 17) = 680 + 17 = 697. 
distributive law: The rule of arithmetic that combines addition with 
multiplication, speci¿ cally a × (b + c) = (a × b) + (a × c).
factoring method: A method for multiplying numbers by factoring one 
of the numbers into smaller parts. For example, 35 × 14 = 35 × 2 × 7 
= 70 × 7 = 490.

Lecture 4: Divide and Conquer 
Divide and Conquer 
Lecture 4
When I was a kid, I remember doing lots of 1-digit division problems 
on a bowling league. If I had a score of 45 after three frames, I would 
divide 45 by 3 to get 15, and would think, “At this rate, I’m on pace to 
get a score of 150.”
W
e begin by reviewing some tricks for determining when one 
number divides evenly into another, then move on to 1-digit 
division. Let’s ¿ rst try 79 ÷ 3. On paper, you might write 3 goes 
into 7 twice, subtract 6, then bring down the 9, and so on. But instead of 
subtracting 6 from 7, think of subtracting 60 from 79. The number of times 3 
goes into 7 is 2, so the number of times it goes into 79 is 20. We keep the 20 
in mind as part of the answer. Now our problem is 19 ÷ 3, which gives us 6 
and a remainder of 1. The answer, then, is 26 with a remainder of 1. 
We can do the problem 1234 ÷ 5 with the process used above or an easier 
method. Keep in mind that if we double both numbers in a division problem, 
the answer will stay the same. Thus, the problem 1234 ÷ 5 is the same as 
2468 ÷ 10, and dividing by 10 is easy. The answer is 246.8. 
With 2-digit division, our rapid 2-by-1 multiplication skills pay off. Let’s 
determine the gas mileage if your car travels 353 miles on 14 gallons of 
gas. The problem is 353 ÷ 14; 14 goes into 35 twice, and 14 × 20 = 280. We 
keep the 20 in mind and subtract 280 from 353, which is 73. We now have a 
simpler division problem: 73 ÷ 14; the number of times 14 goes into 73 is 5 
(14 × 5 = 70). The answer, then, is 25 with a remainder of 3. 
Let’s try 500 ÷ 73. How many times does 73 go into 500? It’s natural to 
guess 7, but 7 × 73 = 511, which is a little too big. We now know that the 
quotient is 6, so we keep that in mind. We then multiply 6 × 73 to get 438, 
and using complements, we know that 500 – 438 = 62. The answer is 6 with 
a remainder of 62. 

31
We can also do this problem another way. We originally found that 73 × 7 
was too big, but we can take advantage of that calculation. We can think 
of the answer as 7 with a remainder of –11. That sounds a bit ridiculous, 
but it’s the same as an answer of 6 with a remainder of 73 – 11 ( = 62), and 
that agrees with our previous answer. This technique is called overshooting. 
With the problem 770 ÷ 79, we know that 
79 × 10 = 790, which is too big by 20. Our 
¿ rst answer is 10 with a remainder of –20, 
but the ¿ nal answer is 9 with a remainder of 
79 – 20, which is 59.
A 4-digit number divided by a 2-digit number 
is about as large a mental division problem 
as most people can handle. Consider the 
problem 2001 ÷ 23. We start with a 2-by-1 
multiplication problem: 23 × 8 = 184; thus, 
23 × 80 = 1840. We know that 80 will be part of the answer; now we subtract 
2001 – 1840. Using complements, we ¿ nd that 1840 is 160 away from 
2000. Finally, we do 161 ÷ 23, and 23 × 7 = 161 exactly, which gives us 
87 as the answer. 
The problem 2012 ÷ 24 is easier. Both numbers here are divisible by 4; 
speci¿ cally, 2012 = 503 × 4, and 24 = 6 × 4. We simplify the problem to 
503 ÷ 6, which reduces the 2-digit problem to a 1-digit division problem. 
The simpli¿ ed problem gives us an answer of 83 5/6; as long as this answer 
and the one for 2012 ÷ 24 are expressed in fractions, they’re the same. 
To convert fractions to decimals, most of us know the decimal expansions 
when the denominator is 2, 3, 4, 5 or 10. The fractions with a denominator 
of 7 are the trickiest, but if you memorize the fraction for 1/7 (0.142857…), 
then you know the expansions for all the other sevenths fractions. The 
trick here is to think of drawing these numbers in a circle; you can then go 
around the circle to ¿ nd the expansions for 2/7, 3/7, and so on. For example, 
2/7 = 0.285714…, and 3/7 = 0.428571….
A 4-digit number 
divided by a 2-digit 
number is about as 
large a mental division 
problem as most 
people can handle.

32
Lecture 4: Divide and Conquer 
When dealing with fractions with larger denominators, we treat the fraction 
as a normal division problem, but we can occasionally take shortcuts, 
especially when the denominator is even. With odd denominators, you may 
not be able to ¿ nd a shortcut unless the denominator is a multiple of 5, in 
which case you can double the numerator and denominator to make the 
problem easier.
Keep practicing the division techniques we’ve learned in this lecture, and 
you’ll be dividing and conquering numbers mentally in no time. Ŷ

The Art of Guesstimation 
Lecture 5
Your body is like a walking yardstick, and it’s worth knowing things 
like the width of your hand from pinkie to thumb, or the size of your 
footsteps, or parts of your hand that measure to almost exactly one or 
two inches or one or two centimeters.
M
ental estimation techniques give us quick answers to everyday 
questions when we don’t need to know the answer to the last 
penny or decimal point. We estimate the answers to addition and 
subtraction problems by rounding, which can be useful when estimating 
the grocery bill. As each item is rung up, round it up or down to the 
nearest 50 cents. 
To estimate answers to multiplication or division problems, it’s important to 
¿ rst determine the order of magnitude of the answer. The general rules are 
as follows:
x
For a multiplication problem, if the ¿ rst number has x digits and 
the second number has y digits, then their product will have x + y
digits or, perhaps, x + y – 1 digits. Example: A 5-digit number times 
a 3-digit number creates a 7- or 8-digit number.
x
To ¿ nd out if the answer to a × b will have the larger or smaller 
number of digits, multiply the ¿ rst digit of each number. If that 
product is 10 or more, then the answer will be the larger number. 
If that product is between 5 and 9, then the answer could go 
either way. If the product is 4 or less, then the answer will be the 
smaller number. 
x
For a division problem, the length of the answer is the difference of 
the lengths of the numbers being divided or 1 more. (Example: With 
an 8-digit number divided by a 3-digit number, the answer will have 
8 – 3 = 5 or 6 digits before the decimal point.)

36
Lecture 5: The Art of Guesstimation 
x
To ¿ nd out how many digits come before the decimal point in the 
answer to a ÷ b, if the ¿ rst digit of a is the same as the ¿ rst digit of 
b, then compare the second digits of each number. If the ¿ rst digit 
of a is larger than the ¿ rst digit of b, then the answer will be the 
longer choice. If the ¿ rst digit of a is less than the ¿ rst digit of b, 
then the answer will be the shorter choice.
In estimating sales tax, if the tax is a whole number, such as 4%, then 
estimating it is just a straight multiplication problem. For instance, if you’re 
purchasing a car for $23,456, then to estimate 4% tax, simply multiply 
23,000 × 0.04 (= $920; exact answer: $938). If the 
tax is not a whole number, such as 4.5%, you can 
calculate it using 4%, but then divide that amount 
by 8 to get the additional 0.5%. 
Suppose a bank offers an interest rate of 3% per 
year on its savings accounts. You can ¿ nd out how 
long it will take to double your money using the 
“Rule of 70”; this calculation is 70 divided by the 
interest rate. 
Suppose you borrow $200,000 to buy a house, and 
the bank charges an interest rate of 6% per year, 
compounded monthly. What that means is that the 
bank is charging you 6/12%, or 1/2%, interest for every month of your loan. 
If you have 30 years to repay your loan, how much will you need to pay each 
month? To estimate the answer, follow these steps:
x
Find the total number of payments to be made: 30 × 12 = 360.
x
Determine the monthly payment without interest: $200,000 ÷ 360. 
Simplify the problem by dividing everything by 10 (= 20,000 ÷ 36), 
then by dividing everything by 4 (= 5000 ÷ 9, or 1000 × 5/9). The 
fraction 5/9 is about 0.555, which means the monthly payment 
without interest would be about 1000 × 0.555, or $555.
To estimate 
answers to 
multiplication or 
division problems, 
it’s important to 
¿ rst determine the 
order of magnitude 
of the answer.

Determine the amount of interest owed in the ¿ rst month: 
$200,000 × 0.5% = $1000.
A quick estimate of your monthly payment, then, would be $1000 to cover 
the interest plus $555 to go toward the principal, or $1555. This estimate will 
always be on the high side, because after each payment, you’ll owe the bank 
slightly less than the original amount. 
Square roots arise in many physical and statistical calculations, and we 
can estimate square roots using the divide-and-average method. To ¿ nd the 
square root of a number, such as 40, start by taking any reasonable guess. 
We’ll choose 62 = 36. Next, divide 40 by 6, which is 6 with a remainder of 
4, or 6 2/3. In other words, 6 × 6 2/3 = 40. The square root must lie between 
6 and 6 2/3. If we average 6 and 6 2/3, we get 6 1/3, or about 6.33; the exact 
answer begins 6.32! Ŷ
square root: A number that, when multiplied by itself, produces a given 
number. For example, the square root of 9 is 3 and the square root of 2 
begins 1.414…. Incidentally, the square root is de¿ ned to be greater than or 
equal to zero, so the square root of 9 is not –3, even though –3 multiplied by 
itself is also 9.

Even if you haven’t been balancing your checkbook, you might now 
want to start. It’s a great way to become more comfortable with 
numbers, and you’ll understand exactly what’s happening with 
your money!
I
n this lecture, we’ll learn some techniques to speed up calculations done 
on paper, along with some interesting ways to check our answers. When 
doing problems on paper, it’s usually best to perform the calculations 
from right to left, as we were taught in school. It’s also helpful to say the 
running total as you go. To check your addition, add the numbers again, from 
bottom to top.
When doing subtraction on paper, we can make use of complements. 
Imagine balancing your checkbook; you start with a balance of $1235.79, 
from which you need to subtract $271.82. First, subtract the cents: 79 – 82. 
If the problem were 82 – 79, the answer would be 3 cents, but since it’s 
79 – 82, we take the complement of 3 cents, which is 97 cents. Next, we 
need to subtract 272, which we do by subtracting 300 (1235 – 300 = 935), 
then adding back its complement (28): 935 + 28 = 963. The new balance, 
then, is $963.97. We can check our work by turning the original subtraction 
problem into an addition problem.
Cross-multiplication is a fun way to multiply numbers of any length. This 
method is really just the distributive law at work. For example, the problem 
23 × 58 is (20 + 3) × (50 + 8), which has four separate components: 20 × 
50, 20 × 8, 3 × 50, and 3 × 8. The 3 × 8 we do at the beginning. The 20 × 
50 we do at the end, and the 20 × 8 and 3 × 50 we do in criss-cross steps. 
If we extend this logic, we can do 3-by-3 multiplication or even higher. 
This method was ¿ rst described in the book Liber Abaci, written in 1202 by 
Leonardo of Pisa, also known as Fibonacci. 
The digit-sum check can be used to check the answer to a multiplication 
problem. Let’s try the problem 314 × 159 = 49,926. We ¿ rst sum the digits 

42
Lecture 6: Mental Math and Paper 
of the answer: 4 + 9 + 9 + 2 + 6 = 30. We reduce 30 to a 2-digit number by 
adding its digits: 3 + 0 = 3. Thus, the answer reduces to the number 3. Now, 
we reduce the original numbers: 314 ĺ 3 + 1 + 4 = 8 and 159 ĺ 1 + 5 + 9 
= 15, which reduces to 1 + 5 = 6. Multiply the reduced numbers, 8 × 6 = 48, 
then reduce that number: 4 + 8 = 12, which reduces to 1 + 2 = 3. The reduced 
numbers for both the answer and the 
problem match. If all the calculations are 
correct, then these numbers must match. 
Note that a match does not mean that 
your answer is correct, but if the numbers 
don’t match, then you’ve de¿ nitely made 
a calculation error. 
This method is also known as casting out 
nines, because when you reduce a number 
by summing its digits, the number you 
end up with is its remainder when divided 
by 9. For example, if we add the digits of 
67, we get 13, and the digits of 13 add up 
to 4. If we take 67 ÷ 9, we get 7 with a remainder of 4. Casting out nines also 
works for addition and subtraction problems, even those with decimals, and 
it may be useful for eliminating answers on standardized tests that do not 
allow calculators. 
The number 9, because of its simple multiplication table, its divisibility test, 
and the casting-out-nines process, seems almost magical. In fact, there’s even 
a magical way to divide numbers by 9, using a process called Vedic division. 
This process is similar to the technique we learned for multiplying by 11 in 
Lecture 1, because dividing by 9 is the same as multiplying by 0.111111. 
The close-together method can be used to multiply any two numbers that 
are near each other. Consider the problem 107 × 111. First, we note how far 
each number is from 100: 7 and 11. We then add either 107 + 11 or 111 + 
7, both of which sum to 118. Next, we multiply 7 × 11, which is 77. Write 
the numbers down, and that’s the answer: 11,877. The algebraic formula for 
this technique is (z + a)(z + b) = (z + a + b)z + ab, where typically, z is an

subtraction problems,

easy number with zeros in it (such as z = 100 or z = 10) and a and b are 
the distances from the easy number. This technique also works for numbers 
below 100, but here, we use negative numbers for the distances from 100. 
Once you know how to do the close-together method on paper, it’s not 
dif¿ cult to do it mentally; we’ll try that in the next lecture. Ŷ
casting out nines (also known as the method of digit sums): A method of 
verifying an addition, subtraction, or multiplication problem by reducing 
each number in the problem to a 1-digit number obtained by adding the 
digits. For example, 67 sums to 13, which sums to 4, and 83 sums to 11, 
which sums to 2. When verifying that 67 + 83 = 150, we see that 150 sums 
to 6, which is consistent with 4 + 2 = 6. When verifying 67 × 83 = 5561, we 
see that 5561 sums to 17 which sums to 8, which is consistent with 4 × 2 = 8.
close-together method: A method for multiplying two numbers that are 
close together. When the close-together method is applied to 23 × 26, we 
calculate (20 × 29) + (3 × 6) = 580 + 18 = 598. 
criss-cross method: A quick method for multiplying numbers on paper. The 
answer is written from right to left, and nothing else is written down.

Intermediate Multiplication 
Lecture 7
The reason I like the factoring method is that it’s easier on your memory, 
much easier than the addition or the subtraction method, because once 
you compute a number, … you immediately put it to use.
I
n this lecture, we’ll extend our knowledge of 2-by-1 and 3-by-1 
multiplication to learn ¿ ve methods for 2-by-2 multiplication. First is the 
addition method, which can be applied to any multiplication problem, 
although it’s best to use it when at least one of the numbers being multiplied 
ends in a small digit. With this method, we round that number down to 
the nearest easy number. For 41 × 17, we treat 41 as 40 + 1 and calculate 
(40 × 17) + (1 × 17) = 680 + 17 = 697.
A problem like 53 × 89 could be done by the addition method, but it’s 
probably easier to use the subtraction method. With this method, we 
treat 89 as 90 – 1 and calculate (53 × 90) – (53 × 1) = 4770 – 453 = 717. 
The subtraction method is especially handy when one of the numbers ends in 
a large digit, such as 7, 8, or 9. Here, we round up to the nearest easy number. 
For 97 × 22, we treat 97 as 100 – 3, then calculate (100 × 22) – (3 × 22) 
= 2200 – 66 = 2134.
A third strategy for 2-by-2 multiplication is the factoring method. Again, for 
the problem 97 × 22, instead of rounding 97 up or rounding 22 down, we 
factor 22 as 11 × 2. We now have 97 × 11 × 2, and we can use the 11s trick 
from Lecture 1. The result for 97 × 11 is 1067; we multiply that by 2 to 
get 2134.
When using the factoring method, you often have several choices for how to 
factor, and you may wonder in what order you should multiply the factors. If 
you’re quick with 2-by-1 multiplications, you can practice the “math of least 
resistance”—look at the problem both ways and take the easier path. The 
factoring method can also be used with decimals, such as when converting 
temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit. 

47
Another strategy for 2-digit multiplication is squaring. For a problem like 
132, we can apply the close-together method. We replace one of the 13s with 
10; then, since we’ve gone down 3, we need to go back up by adding 3 to 
the other 13 to get 16. The ¿ rst part of the calculation is now 10 × 16. To 
that result, we add the square of the number that went up and down (3): 
10 × 16 = 160 and 160 + 32 = 169. 
Numbers that end in 5 are especially 
easy to square using this method, as are 
numbers near 100. 
Finally, our ¿ fth mental multiplication 
strategy is the close-together method, 
which we saw in the last lecture. For a 
problem like 26 × 23, we ¿ rst ¿ nd a round 
number that is close to both numbers in 
the problem; we’ll use 20. Next, we note 
how far away each of the numbers is from 20: 26 is 6 away, and 23 is 3 
away. Now, we multiply 20 × 29. We get the number 29 in several ways: It’s 
either 26 + 3 or 23 + 6; it comes from adding the original numbers together 
(26 + 23 = 49), then splitting that sum into 20 + 29. After we multiply 
29 × 20 (= 580), we add the product of the distances (6 × 3 = 18): 
580 + 18 = 598.
After you’ve practiced these sorts of problems, you’ll look for other 
opportunities to use the method. For example, for a problem like 17 × 76, 
you can make those numbers close together by doubling the ¿ rst number and 
cutting the second number in half, which would leave you with the close-
together problem 34 × 38. 
The best method to use for mentally multiplying 2-digit numbers depends 
on the numbers you’re given. If both numbers are the same, use the squaring 
method. If they’re close to each other, use the close-together method. If one 
of the numbers can be factored into small numbers, use the factoring method. 
If one of the numbers is near 100 or it ends in 7, 8, or 9, try the subtraction 
method. If one of the numbers ends in a small digit, such as 1, 2, 3, or 4, or 
when all else fails, use the addition method. Ŷ
If you’re quick with 2-by-1 
multiplications, you can 
practice the “math of 
least resistance”—look 
at the problem both ways 
and take the easier path.

48
Lecture 7: Intermediate Multiplication 
math of least resistance: Choosing the easiest mental calculating strategy 
among several possibilities. For example, to do the problem 43 × 28, it is 
easier to do 43 × 7 × 4 = 301 × 4 = 1204 than to do 43 × 4 × 7 = 172 × 7. 
squaring: Multiplying a number by itself. For example, the square of 5 is 25.
subtraction method: A method for multiplying numbers by turning the 
original problem into a subtraction problem. For example, 9 × 79 = (9 × 80) 
– (9 × 1) = 720 – 9 = 711, or 19 × 37 = (20 × 37) – (1 × 37) = 740 – 37 = 703.

Lecture 8: The Speed of Vedic Division 
The Speed of Vedic Division 
Lecture 8
There is more to Vedic mathematics than division, although we’ve seen 
much of it in this course already. 
I
n this lecture, we explore strategies for doing division problems on paper 
that come to us from Vedic mathematics. With this approach, as we 
generate an answer, the digits of the answer play a role in generating 
more digits of the answer.
We ¿ rst look at the processes of long and short division. Short division works 
well for 1-digit division and when dividing by a number between 10 and 
20, but for numbers of 21 or greater, Vedic division is usually better. Vedic 
division is sort of like the subtraction method for multiplication applied 
to division.
Let’s start with the problem 13,571 ÷ 39. The Vedic approach makes use 
of the fact that it’s much easier to divide by 40 than 39. Dividing by 40 is 
essentially as easy as dividing by 4. If we divide 13,571 by 4, we get the 
4-digit answer 3392.75. (We consider this a 4-digit answer because it has 4 
digits before the decimal point.) If we’re dividing 13,571 by 40, we simply 
shift the decimal point to get a 3-digit answer: 339.275. 
With Vedic division, we start off as follows: 4 goes into 13, 3 times with a 
remainder of 1. The 3 goes above the line and the 1 goes next to the 5 below 
the line. Now, here’s the twist: Instead of dividing 4 into 15, we divide 4 
into 15 + 3; the 3 comes from the quotient digit above the line. We now have 
15 + 3 = 18, and 4 goes into 18, 4 times with a remainder of 2. The 4 goes 
above the line, and the 2 goes next to the 7 below the line. Again, instead 
of dividing 4 into 27, we divide 4 into 27 + 4 (the quotient digit above the 
line), which is 31. We continue this process to get an answer to the original 
problem of 347 with a remainder of 38.

53
To see why this method works, let’s look at the problem 246,810 ÷ 79. 
Essentially, when we divide by 79, we’re dividing by 80 – 1, but if the 
process subtracts off three multiples of 80, it needs to add back three to 
compensate, just as we saw in the subtraction method for multiplication. The 
idea behind the Vedic method is that it’s easier to divide by 80 than 79. For 
this problem, 80 goes into 246, 3 times, so we subtract 240, but we were 
supposed to subtract 3 × 79, not 3 × 80, so we 
have to add back 3 before taking the next step. 
Once we do this, we’re at the same place we 
would be using long division.
Sometimes, the division step results in a divisor 
that’s greater than 10. If that happens, we carry 
the 10s digit into the previous column and keep 
going. For 1475 ÷ 29, we go up 1 to 30, so 3 is our 
divisor; 3 goes into 14, 4 times with a remainder 
of 2. The 4 goes above the line and the 2 goes next to the 7. Next, we do 3 
into 27 + 4, which is 31; 3 goes into 31, 10 times with a remainder of 1. We 
write the 10 above the line, as before, making sure that the 1 goes in the 
previous column. When we reach the remainder step, we have to make sure 
to add 15 + 10, rather than 15 + 0. The result here is 50 with a remainder 
of 25.
If the divisor ends in 8, 7, 6, or 5, the procedure is almost the same. For 
the problem 123,456 ÷ 78, we go up 2 to get to 80 and use 8 as our divisor. 
Then, as we go through the procedure, we double the previous quotient at 
each step. If the original divisor ends in 7, we would add 3 to reach a round 
number, so at each step, we add 3 times the previous quotient. If the divisor 
ends in 6, we add 4 times the previous quotient, and if it ends in 5, we add 5 
times the previous quotient. If the divisor ends in 1, 2, 3, or 4, we go down 
to reach a round number and subtract the previous quotient multiplied by 
that digit. In other words, the multiplier for these divisors would be 1, 2, 
3, or 4. This subtraction step sometimes yields negative numbers; if this 
happens, we reduce the previous quotient by 1 and increase the remainder by 
the 1-digit divisor. 
Vedic division is 
sort of like the 
subtraction method 
for multiplication 
applied to division.

Lecture 9: Memorizing Numbers 
Memorizing Numbers 
Lecture 9
I can tell you from experience that if you use a list a lot, like, say, 
the presidents or a particular credit card number, then eventually, 
the phonetic code fades away and the numbers are converted to 
long-term memory, or you remember the numbers using other 
contextual information.
I
n this lecture, we’ll learn a fun and amazingly effective way to memorize 
numbers. This skill will help you perform large calculations and help 
you memorize important numbers, such as credit card numbers. For 
most of this lecture, we’ll take advantage of a phonetic code known as the 
Major system, which has been in the English language for nearly 200 years.
Here is the Major system: 1 = t or d sound; 2 = n sound; 3 = m sound; 4 = r
sound; 5 = L sound; 6 = ch, sh, or j sound; 7 = k or g sound; 8 = f or v sound; 
9 = p or b sound; and 0 = s or z sound. 
After you’ve studied and memorized this phonetic code, you’ll have an 
invaluable tool for turning numbers into words. We do this by inserting 
vowel sounds anywhere we’d like among the consonants. For example, 
suppose you need to remember the number 491. Using the phonetic code, 
you can turn this number into RABBIT, REPEAT, ORBIT, or another word 
by simply inserting vowels among the consonants in the code: 4 = r, 9 = p or 
b, and 1 = t or d. (Notice that even though RABBIT is spelled with two Bs, 
the b sound is pronounced only once. The number for RABBIT is 491, not 
4991.) There are no digits for the consonants h, w, or y, so those can also be 
used whenever you’d like. Even though a number might have several words 
that represent it, each word can be turned into only one number. RABBIT, 
for example, represents only the number 491. Of course, we can also use the 
code in reverse to identify which number is represented by a particular word; 
for instance, PARTY would be 941. 
The phonetic code is also useful for memorizing dates. For example, to 
remember that Andrew Jackson was elected president of the United States 

59
in 1828, we could turn 1828 into TFNF. You might picture Jackson as a 
TOUGH guy with a KNIFE. Or to remember that the Gettysburg Address 
was written in 1863 (TFJM), you might think that Lincoln wrote it to get out 
of a TOUGH JAM. On the Internet, you can ¿ nd numerous sites that have 
converted entire dictionaries into phonetic code.
If you have a long number, such as a 16-digit credit card number, then it 
pays to look inside the number for particularly long words because the fewer 
words you use, the easier the resulting phrase is to remember. For the ¿ rst 24 
digits of pi, 3.14159265358979323846264, we 
can construct this sentence: “My turtle Poncho 
will, my love, pick up my new mover Ginger.” 
The phonetic code can also be used with the 
peg system to memorize any numbered list of 
objects. The peg system converts each number 
on the list into a tangible, easily visualized 
word called the peg word. My peg words for 
the numbers 1 though 10 are: tea, knee, moo, 
ear, oil, shoe, key, foe, pie, and dice. Notice 
that each of these words uses the sound for its corresponding number in the 
phonetic code. To remember that George Washington was the ¿ rst president, 
I might picture myself drinking tea with him. Other associations might be a 
little bit strange, but that makes them even easier to remember.
If your list has more than 10 objects, then you need more peg words, and 
using the phonetic code, every 2-digit number can be turned into at least one 
word: 11 = tot, 12 = tin, 13 = tomb, and so on. My peg word for 40 is rose, 
and the phrase “red rose” reminds me that the 40th president was Ronald 
Reagan. I’ve also applied the peg system to learn where various elements 
appear on the periodic table.
You can use the phonetic code to provide more security to your computer 
password by adding extra digits. For instance, you might have one password 
that you like to use, such as BUNNY RABBIT, but you want to make slight 
alterations for each of your accounts. To adapt the password for your Visa 
account, you might attach the digits 80,741 (= VISA CARD). 
You can use the 
phonetic code to 
provide more security 
to your computer 
password by adding 
extra digits.

Lecture 9: Memorizing Numbers 
The phonetic code is especially handy for numbers that you need to 
memorize for tests or for newly acquired phone numbers, addresses, parking 
spots, hotel rooms, and other numbers that you need to know for just a short 
while. I ¿ nd the phonetic code to be useful for remembering partial answers 
when doing large mental calculations. We’ll see more calculation examples 
that use mnemonics near the end of the course. Ŷ
Major system: A phonetic code that assigns consonant sounds to digits. For 
example 1 gets the t or d sound, 2 gets the n sound, and so on. By inserting 
vowel sounds, numbers can be turned into words, which make them easier 
to remember. It is named after Major Beniowski, a leading memory expert 
in London, although the code was developed by Gregor von Feinagle and 
perfected by Aimé Paris.
peg system: A way to remember lists of objects, especially when the items 
of the list are given a number, such as the list of presidents, elements, or 
constitutional amendments. Each number is turned into a word using a 
phonetic code, and that word is linked to the object to be remembered.

Calendar Calculating 
Lecture 10
Sometimes people ask me the days of the week of ancient history, like 
what day of the week was January 1 in the year 0? The answer is “none 
of the above,” since prior to the 3rd century, most places did not have 
seven days of the week. Instead, the situation was like what the Beatles 
once described as “Eight Days a Week.”
I
n this lecture, we’ll learn how to ¿ gure out the day of the week of any 
date in history. Once you’ve mastered this skill, you’ll be surprised how 
often you use it. Starting with the year 2000, every year gets a code 
number. The code for 2000 is 0. The codes for Monday through Saturday 
are 1 through 6; the code for Sunday is 7 or 0. There are also codes for every 
month of the year: 6 (Jan.), 2 (Feb.), 2 (March), 5 (April), 0 (May), 3 (June), 
5 (July), 1 (Aug.), 4 (Sept.), 6 (Oct.), 2 (Nov.), 4 (Dec.). In a leap year, 
January is 5 and February is 1.
It’s helpful to develop a set of mnemonic devices to establish a link in your 
mind between each month and its code. For example, January might be 
associated with the word WINTER, which has the same number of letters as 
its code; February is the second month, and its code is 2; and so on.
To determine the day of the week for any year, we use this formula: month 
code + date + year code. For the date January 1, 2000, we go through these 
steps: The year 2000 was a leap year, so the month code for January is 5; 
add 1 for the date and 0 for the year. Those numbers sum to 6, which means 
that January 1, 2000, was a Saturday. If the sum of the codes and date is 7 or 
greater, we subtract the largest possible multiple of 7 to reduce it.
For the year 2001, the year code changes from 0 to 1; for 2002, it’s 2; for 
2003, it’s 3; for 2004, because that’s a leap year, the code is 5; and for 2005, 
the code is 6. The year 2006 would have a code of 7, but because we subtract 
7s in the process of ¿ guring out dates, we can subtract 7 here and simplify 
this code to 0. 

64
Lecture 10: Calendar Calculating 
The formula for determining the code for any year from 2000 to 2099 is: 
years + leaps – multiples of 7. Let’s try the year 2025. We ¿ rst plug the last 
two digits in for years. To ¿ gure out the leaps, recall that 2000 has a year 
code of 0. After that, the calendar will shift once for each year and once 
more for each leap year. By 2025, the calendar will have shifted 25 times 
for each year, plus once more for each leap year, and there are six leap years 
from 2001 to 2025 (years ÷ 4, ignoring any 
remainder). Thus, we add 25 + 6 = 31, then 
subtract the largest possible multiple of 7: 
31 – 28 = 3, which is the year code for 2025. 
Determining the year code is the hardest 
part of the calculation, so it helps to do that 
¿ rst. There is also a shortcut that comes in 
handy when the year ends in a high number. 
Between 1901 and 2099, the calendar repeats every 28 years. Thus, if you 
have a year such as 1998, you can subtract any multiple of 28 to make that 
number smaller, and the calendar will be exactly the same.
The general rule for leap years is that they occur every 4 years, with the 
exception that years divisible by 100 are not leap years. An exception to this 
exception is that if the year is divisible by 400, then it is still a leap year. 
The year 1900 has a code of 1, 1800 is 3, 1700 is 5, and 1600 is 0. To 
determine the code for a year in the 1900s, the formula is years + leaps + 
1  multiples of 7; for the 1800s, years + leaps + 3  multiples of 7; for the 
1700s, years + leaps + 5  multiples of 7; and for the 1600s, years + leaps 
 multiples of 7.
The calculations we’ve done all use the Gregorian calendar, which was 
established by Pope Gregory XIII in 1582 but wasn’t universally adopted 
until the 1920s. Before the Gregorian calendar, European countries used the 
Julian calendar, established by Julius Caesar in 46 B.C. Under the Julian 
calendar, leap years happened every four years with no exceptions, but this 
created problems because the Earth’s orbit around the Sun is not exactly 
365.25 days. For this reason, we can’t give the days of the week for dates in 
ancient history. Ŷ
Determining the year 
code is the hardest part 
of the calculation, so it 
helps to do that ¿ rst.

65
Gregorian calendar: Established by Pope Gregory XIII in 1582, it replaced 
the Julian calendar to more accurately reÀ ect the length of the Earth’s 
average orbit around the Sun; it did so by allowing three fewer leap years 
for every 400 years. Under the Julian calendar, every 4 years was a leap year, 
even when the year was divisible by 100. 
leap year: A year with 366 days. According to our Gregorian calendar, a 
year is usually a leap year if it is divisible by 4. However, if the year is 
divisible by 100 and not by 400, then it is not a leap year. For example, 1700, 
1800, and 1900 are not leap years, but 2000 is a leap year. In the 21st century, 
2004, 2008, …, 2096 are leap years, but 2100 is not a leap year.

Advanced Multiplication 
Lecture 11
As I promised, these problems are de¿ nitely a challenge! As you saw, 
doing enormous problems … requires all of the previous squaring and 
memory skills that we’ve learned. Once you can do a 4-digit square, 
even if it takes you a few minutes, the 3-digit squares suddenly don’t 
seem so bad!
I
n this lecture, we’ll look at mental math techniques for enormous 
problems, such as squaring 3- and 4-digit numbers and ¿ nding 
approximate cubes of 2-digit numbers. If you’ve been practicing the 
mental multiplication and squaring methods we’ve covered so far, you 
should be ready for this lecture.
To square 3-digit numbers quickly, you must be comfortable squaring 2-digit 
numbers. Let’s start with 1082. As we’ve seen before, we go down 8 to 100, 
up 8 to 116, then multiply 100 × 116 = 11,600; we then add 82 (= 64) to get 
11,664. A problem like 1262 becomes tricky if you don’t know the 2-digit 
squares well, because you’ll forget the ¿ rst result (152 × 100 = 15,200) while 
you try to work out 262. In this case, it might be helpful to say the 15,000, 
then raise 2 ¿ ngers (to represent 200) while you square 26.
Here’s a geometry question: The Great Pyramid of Egypt has a square base, 
with side lengths of about 230 meters, or 755 feet. What is the area of the 
base? To ¿ nd the answer in meters, we go down 30 to 200, up 30 to 260, 
then multiply 200 × 260 = 52,000; we then add 302 (= 900) to get 52,900 
square meters.
To calculate the square footage (7552), we could go up 45 to 800, then down 
45 to 710, or we could use the push-together, pull-apart method: 755 + 755 
= 1510, which can be pulled apart into 800 and 710. We now multiply 800 × 
710 = 568,000, then add 452 (= 2025) to get 570,025 square feet.

70
Lecture 11: Advanced Multiplication 
One way to get better at 3-digit squares is to try 4-digit squares. In most 
cases, you’ll need to use mnemonics for these problems. Let’s try 23452. We 
go down 345 to 2000, up 345 to 2690. We then multiply 2000 × 2690, which 
is (2000 × 2600) + (2000 × 90) = 5,380,000. The answer will begin with 
5,000,000, but the 380,000 is going to change.
How can we be sure that the 5,000,000 won’t change? When we square a 
4-digit number, the largest 3-digit number we will ever have to square in the 
middle is 500, because we always go up or down to the nearest thousand. 
The result of 5002 is 250,000, which means that if we’re holding onto a 
number that is less than 750,000 
(here, 380,000), then we can be sure 
there won’t be a carry. 
How can we hold onto 380,000 while 
we square 345? Using the phonetic 
code we learned in Lecture 9, we 
send 380 to the MOVIES. Now we 
square 345: down 45 to 300, up 45 
to 390; 300 × 390 = 117,000; add 452 
(= 2025); and the result is 119,025. We hold onto the 025 by turning it into 
a SNAIL. We add 119,000 + MOVIES (380,000) = 499,000, which we can 
say. Then say SNAIL (025) for the rest of our answer. We’ve now said the 
answer: 5,499,025.
Notice that once you can square a 4-digit number, you can raise a 2-digit 
number to the 4th power just by squaring it twice. There’s also a quick way to 
approximate 2-digit cubes. Let’s try 433. We go down 3 to 40, down 3 to 40 
again, then up 6 to 49. Our estimate of 433 is now 40 × 40 × 49. When we do 
the multiplication, we get an estimate of 78,400; the exact answer is 79,507.
Finally, we turn to 3-digit-by-2-digit multiplication. The easiest 3-by-2 
problems have numbers that end in 0, because the 0s can be ignored until 
the end. Also easy are problems in which the 2-digit number can be factored 
into small numbers, which occurs about half the time. To ¿ nd out how many 
hours are in a typical year, for example, we calculate 365 × 24, but 24 is 
6 × 4, so we multiply 365 × 6, then multiply that result by 4. 
One way to get better at 
3-digit squares is to try 4-digit 
squares. In most cases, you’ll 
need to use mnemonics for 
these problems.

71
The next easiest situation is when the 3-digit number can be factored into a 
2-digit number × a 1-digit number. For instance, with 47 × 126, 47 is prime, 
but 126 is 63 × 2; we can multiply 47 × 63, then double that result. For the 
most dif¿ cult problems, we can break the 3-digit number into two parts and 
apply the distributive law. For a problem like 47 × 283, we multiply 47 × 
280 and add 47 × 3.
In our last lecture, we’ll see what you can achieve if you become seriously 
dedicated to calculation, and we’ll consider broader bene¿ ts from what 
we’ve learned that are available to everyone. Ŷ

BONUS MATERIAL: We can also compute the exact value of a cube with 
only a little more effort. For example, to cube 42, we use z = 40 and d = 2. 
The approximate cube is 40 × 40 × 46 = 73,600. To get the exact cube, we 
can use the following algebra: (z + d) 3 = z(z(z + 3d) + 3d 2) + d 3. First, we 
do z(z + 3d) + 3d 2 = 40 × 46 + 12 = 1852. Then, we multiply this number by 
z again: 1852 × 40 = 74,080. Finally, we add d 3 = 23 = 8 to get 74,088. 
Notice that when cubing a 2-digit number, in our ¿ rst addition step, the value 
of 3d 2 can be one of only ¿ ve numbers: 3, 12, 27, 48, or 75. Speci¿ cally, 
if the number ends in 1 (so d = 1) or ends in 9 (so d = –1), then 3d 2 = 3. 
Similarly, if the last digit is 2 or 8, we add 12; if it’s 3 or 7, we add 27; if it’s 
4 or 6, we add 48; if it’s 5, we add 75. Then, in the last step, we will always 
add or subtract one of ¿ ve numbers, based on d 3. Here’s the pattern:
If last digit is…
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
Adjust by…
 +1 +8 +27 +64 +125 –64 –27 –8 –1

75
For example, what is the cube of 96? Here, z = 100 and d = –4. The 
approximate cube would be 100 × 100 × 88 = 880,000. For the exact cube, 
we ¿ rst do 100 × 88 + 48 = 8848. Then we multiply by 100 and subtract 64: 
8848 × 100 – 64 = 884,800 – 64 = 884,736. 
Using these examples as a guide, compute the exact values of the 
following cubes.

Lecture 12
You’ll notice that cube rooting of 2-digit cubes doesn’t really require 
much in the way of calculation. It’s more like observation—looking at 
the number and taking advantage of a beautiful pattern.
W
e started this course using little more than the multiplication 
table, and we’ve since learned how to add, subtract, multiply, and 
divide enormous numbers. In this lecture, we’ll review some of 
the larger lessons we’ve learned. 
One of these lessons is that it pays to look at the numbers in a problem to 
see if they can somehow help to make the job of ¿ nding a solution easier. 
Can one of the numbers be broken into small factors; are the numbers close 
together; or can one of the numbers be rounded to give a good approximation 
of the answer? 
We’ve also learned that dif¿ cult addition problems can often be made into 
easy subtraction problems and vice versa. In fact, if you want to become a 
“mental mathlete,” it’s useful to try to do problems in more than one way. 
We can approach a problem like 21 × 29, for example, using the addition, 
subtraction, factoring, or close-together methods.
We know that if we multiply a 5-digit number by a 3-digit number, the 
answer will have 8 (5 + 3) digits or maybe 7. If we pick the ¿ rst digit of 
each number at random, then we would assume, just from knowing the 
multiplication table, that there’s a good chance the product of those digits 
will be greater than 10, which would give us an 8-digit answer. According 
to Benford’s law, however, it’s far more likely that the original 5-digit and 
3-digit numbers will start with a small number, such as 1, 2, or 3, which 
means that there’s about a 50-50 chance of getting an answer with 8 digits or 
an answer with 7 digits. For most collections of numbers in the real world, 
such as street addresses or numbers on a tax return, there are considerably 
more numbers that start with 1 than start with 9.

77
Also in this course, we’ve learned how to apply the phonetic code to 
numbers that we have to remember and to use a set of codes to determine the 
day of the week for any date in the year. If anything, this course should have 
taught you to look at numbers differently, even when they don’t involve a 
math problem. 
As we’ve said, it usually pays to try to ¿ nd features of problems that you can 
exploit. As an example, let’s look at how to ¿ nd the cube root of a number 
when the answer is a 2-digit number. Let’s try 54,872; to ¿ nd its cube 
root, all we need to know are the cubes of the numbers from 1 through 10. 
Notice that the last digits of these cubes 
are all different, and the last digit either 
matches the original number or is the 
10s complement of the original number. 
To ¿ nd the cube root of 54,872, we look 
at how the cube begins and ends. The 
number 54 falls between 33 and 43. Thus, 
we know that 54,000 falls between 303 
(= 27,000) and 403 (= 64,000); its cube 
root must be in the 30s. The last digit of the cube is 2, and there’s only one 
number from 1 to 10 whose cube ends in 2, namely, 83 (= 512); thus, the cube 
root of 54,872 is 38. Note that this method works only with perfect cubes.
Finally, we’ve learned that mental calculation is a process of constant 
simpli¿ cation. Even very large problems can be broken down into simple 
steps. The problem 47,8932, for example, can be broken down into 
47,0002 + 8932 + 47,000 × 893 × 2. As we go through this problem, we make 
use of the criss-cross method, squaring smaller numbers, complements, and 
phonetic code—essentially, this is the math of least resistance.
To get into the Guinness Book of World Records for mental calculation, 
it used to be that contestants had to quickly determine the 13th root of a 
100-digit number. To break the record now, contestants have to ¿ nd the 13th 
root of a 200-digit number. Every two years, mathletes can also enter the 
Mental Calculation World Cup, which tests computation skills similar to 
what we’ve discussed in this course. Most of you watching this course are

Lecture 12: Masters of Mental Math 
probably not aiming for these world championships, but the material we’ve 
covered should be useful to you throughout your life.
All mathematics begins with arithmetic, but it certainly doesn’t end there. I 
encourage you to explore the joy that more advanced mathematics can bring 
in light of the experiences you’ve had with mental math. Some people lose 
con¿ dence in their math skills at an early age, but I hope this course has 
given you the belief that you can do it. It’s never too late to start looking at 
numbers in a new way. Ŷ
Benford’s law: The phenomenon that most of the numbers we encounter 
begin with smaller digits rather than larger digits. Speci¿ cally, for many 
real-world problems (from home addresses, to tax returns, to distances 
to galaxies), the ¿ rst digit is N with probability log(N+1) – log(N), where 
log(N) is the base 10 logarithm of N satisfying 10log(N) = N. 
cube root: A number that, when cubed, produces a given number. For 
example, the cube root of 8 is 2 since 2 × 2 × 2 = 8.

The next few problems will allow us to ¿ nd the cube root when the original 
number is the cube of a 3-digit number. We’ll ¿ rst build up some ideas to 
¿ nd the cube root of 17,173,512, which is the cube of a 3-digit number.
22. Why must the ¿ rst digit of the answer be 2?
23. Why must the last digit of the answer be 8?
24. How can we quickly tell that 17,173,512 is a multiple of 9?
25. It follows that the 3-digit number must be a multiple of 3 (because 
if the 3-digit number was not a multiple of 3, then its cube could not 
be a multiple of 9). What middle digits would result in the number 
2_8 being a multiple of 3? There are three possibilities.

81
26. Use estimation to choose which of the three possibilities is 
most reasonable.
Using the steps above, we can do cube roots of any 3-digit cubes. The ¿ rst 
digit can be determined by looking at the millions digits (the numbers before 
the ¿ rst comma); the last digit can be determined by looking at the last digit 
of the cube; the middle digit can be determined through digit sums and 
estimation. There will always be three or four possibilities for the middle 
digit; they can be determined using the following observations, which you 
should verify. 
27. Verify that if the digit sum of a number is 3, 6, or 9, then its cube 
will have digit sum 9.
28. Verify that if the digit sum of a number is 1, 4, or 7, then its cube 
will have digit sum 1.
29. Verify that if the digit sum of a number is 2, 5, or 8, then its cube 
will have digit sum 8.

88. 454 × 500: 454 × 5 = 2000 (say it) + 250 + 20 = 2000 + 270 = 2270, 
so 454 × 500 = 227,000
89. 664 × 700: 664 × 7 = 4200 + 420 + 28 = 4620 + 28 = 4648, 
so 664 × 700 = 464,800

93. 57 × 24 = 57 × 6 × 4 = (300 + 24) × 4 = 324 × 4 = 1200 (say it) + (24 × 4)
24 × 4 = 80 + 16 = 96, so 57 × 24 = 1296
94. 89 × 72 = 89 × 9 × 8 = (720 + 81) × 8 = 801 × 8 = 6408
In poker, there are 2,598,960 ways to be dealt 5 cards (from 52 different 
cards, where order is not important). Calculate the following multiplication 
problems that arise through counting poker hands.
95. The number of hands that are straights (40 of which are straight 
À ushes) is 10 × 45 = 4 × 4 × 4 × 4 × 4 × 10 = 16 × 43 × 10 
= 64 × 42 × 10 = 256 × 4 × 10 = 1024 × 10 = 10,240
96. The number of hands that are À ushes is (4 × 13 × 12 × 11 × 10 × 9)/120 
= 13 × 11 × 4 × 9 = 143 (close together) × 4 × 9 = (400 + 160 + 12) × 9 
= 572 × 9 = (4500 + 630 + 18) = 5130 + 18 = 5148
97. The number of hands that are four-of-a-kind is 13 × 48 = 13 × 8 × 6 
= (80 + 24) × 6 = 104 × 6 = 624
98. The number of hands that are full houses is 13 × 12 × 4 × 6 
= 156 (close together) × 4 × 6 = (400 + 200 + 24) × 6 = 624 × 6 
= 3600 + 120 + 24 = 3720 + 24 = 3744

Determine which numbers between 2 and 12 divide into each of the 
numbers below.
1. 4410 is divisible by 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, and 10.
Why? Last digit gives us 2, 5, and 10; digit sum = 9 gives us 3 
and 9; divisible by 2 and 3 gives us divisibility by 6. Passes 7 test: 
4410 ĺ 441 ĺ 44 – 2 = 42 It fails tests for 4 (and, therefore, 8 and 
12) and 11. 

104
Solutions
2. 7062 is divisible by 2, 3, 6, and 11.
Why? Last digit gives us 2; digit sum = 15 gives us 3; 2 and 3 imply 
6; alternating sum of digits 7 – 0 + 6 – 2 = 11 gives us 11. Fails 
other tests. 
3. 2744 is divisible by 2, 4, 7, and 8.
Why? 744 is divisible by 8; passes 7 test: 2744 ĺ 274 – 8 = 266 ĺ 
26 – 12 = 14. Fails other tests.
4. 33,957 is divisible by 3, 7, 9, and 11. 
Why? Digit sum = 27 gives us 3 and 9; passes 7 test: 33,957 ĺ 
3395 – 14 = 3381 ĺ 338 – 2 = 336 ĺ 33 – 12 = 21. Passes 11 test: 
3 – 3 + 9 – 5 + 7 = 11. Fails other tests. 
Use the create-a-zero, kill-a-zero method to test the following.
5. Is 4913 divisible by 17? 
Yes, because 4913 ĺ 4913 + 17 = 4930 ĺ 493 ĺ 493 + 17 
= 510 ĺ 51 is a multiple of 17.
6. Is 3141 divisible by 59? 
No, because 3141 + 59 = 3200 ĺ 320 ĺ 32 is not a multiple of 59.
7. Is 355,113 divisible by 7? 
No, because 355,113 + 7 = 355,120 ĺ 35,512 ĺ 35,512 + 28 
= 355,140 ĺ 35,514 ĺ 35,514 – 14 = 35,500 ĺ 3550 ĺ 355 ĺ 355 + 35 
= 390 ĺ 39 is not a multiple of 7. Also, it fails the special rule for 
7s: 355,113 – 6 = 355,107 ĺ 35,510 – 14 = 35,496 ĺ 3549 – 12 
= 3537 ĺ 353 – 14 = 339 ĺ 33 – 18 = 15 is not a multiple of 7. 

105
8. Algebraically, the divisibility rule for 7s says that 10a + b is a 
multiple of 7 if and only if the number a – 2b is a multiple of 7. 
Explain why this works. 
Suppose 10a + b is a multiple of 7, then it remains a multiple of 7 
after we multiply it by –2, so –20a – 2b will still be a multiple of 
7. And since 21a is always a multiple of 7 (because it’s 7 × 3a), we 
can add this to get –20a – 2b + 21a, which is a – 2b. So a – 2b is 
still a multiple of 7. 
Conversely, if a – 2b is a multiple of 7, then it remains so after we 
multiply it by 10, so 10a – 20b is still a multiple of 7. Adding 21b 
(a multiple of 7) to this tells us that 10a + b is also a multiple of 7.

What are the possible numbers of digits in the answers to the following?
8. 5 digits times 3 digits is 7 or 8 digits.
9. 5 digits divided by 3 digits is 2 or 3 digits.
10. 8 digits times 4 digits is 11 or 12 digits.
11. 8 digits divided by 4 digits is 4 or 5 digits.
For the following problems, determine the possible number of digits in the 
answers. (Some answers may allow two possibilities.) A number written like 
3abc represents a 4-digit number with leading digit of 3.
12. 3abc × 7def has 8 digits.
13. 8abc × 1def can have 7 or 8 digits.
14. 2abc × 2def has 7 digits.
15. 9abc ÷ 5de has 2 digits.
16. 1abcdef ÷ 3ghij has 2 digits. 
17. 27abcdefg ÷ 26hijk has 4 digits.
18. If a year has about 32 million seconds, then 1 trillion seconds is 
about how many years? 
The number 1 trillion has 13 digits, starting with 1, and 32 million 
has 8 digits, starting with 3, so 1 trillion divided by 32 million has 5 
digits; thus, the answer is approximately 30,000.
19. The government wants to buy a new weapons system costing $11 
billion. The U.S. has about 100,000 public schools. If each school 
decides to hold a bake sale to raise money for the new weapons 
system, then about how much money does each school need to raise? 

110
Solutions
The number 11 billion has 11 digits, starting with 11, and 100,000 
has 6 digits, starting with 10, so the answer has 11 – 6 + 1 = 6 digits, 
starting with 1; thus, the answer is about $110,000 per school. 
20. If an article is sent to two independent reviewers, and one reviewer 
¿ nds 40 typos, the other ¿ nds 5 typos, and there were 2 typos in 
common, then estimate the total number of typos in the document.
By Pólya’s estimate, the total number of typos in the document is 
approximately 40 × 5 ÷ 2 = 100. 
21. Estimate 6% sales tax on a new car costing $31,500. Adjust your 
answer for 6.25% sales tax. 
315 × 6 = 1890, so the sales tax is about $1900. For an additional 
0.25%, increase this amount by $1900 ÷ 24 (since 6/24 = 0.25%), 
which is about $80; thus, the sales tax with the higher rate is 
about $1980.
22. To calculate 8.5% tax, you can take 8% tax, then add the tax you 
just computed divided by what number? 
Since 8/16 = 0.5, you divide by 16.
For 8.75% tax, you can take 9% tax, then subtract that tax divided 
by what number? 
To reduce the number by 0.25%, we divide the tax by 36, since 
9/36 = 0.25. 
23. If money earns interest compounded at a rate of 2% per year, then 
about how many years would it take for that money to double? 
By the Rule of 70, since 70/2 = 35, it will take about 35 years 
to double.

111
24. Suppose you borrow $20,000 to buy a new car, the bank charges an 
annual interest rate of 3%, and you have 5 years to pay off the loan. 
Determine an underestimate and overestimate for your monthly 
payment, then determine the exact monthly payment. 
The number of monthly payments is 5 × 12 = 60. If no interest were 
charged, the monthly payment would be 20,000/60 § $333. But 
since the monthly interest is 3%/12 = 0.25%, then you would owe 
$20,000(.25%) = $50 in interest for the ¿ rst month. The regular 
monthly payment would be, at most, $333 + $50 = $383.
To get the exact monthly payment, we use the interest formula: 
P × i(1 + i)m/((1 + i)m – 1).
Here, P = 20,000, i = 0.0025, m = 60, and our calculator or search 
engine tells us (1.0025)60 § 1.1616; the monthly payment is about 
$20,000(.0025)(1.1616)/(0.1616) § $359.40/month, which is 
consistent with our lower bound of $333 and our upper bound 
of $383.
25. Repeat the previous problem, but this time, the bank charges 6% 
annual interest and gives you 10 years to pay off the loan. 
The number of monthly payments is 10 × 12 = 120, so the lower 
estimate is 20,000/120 § $167/month. But since the monthly 
interest is 6%/12 = 0.5%, then you would owe $20,000(.5%) 
= $100 in interest for the ¿ rst month. Thus, the regular monthly 
payment would be, at most, $167 + $100 = $267. Plugging 
P = 20,000, i = 0.005, and m = 120 into the formula gives us 
$100(1.005)120/((1.005)120 – 1) § $181.94/(0.8194) § $222/month.
26. Use the divide-and-average method to estimate the square root 
of 27.
If we start with an estimate of 5, 27 ÷ 5 = 5.4, and their average 
is 5.2. (Exact answer begins 5.196…)

112
Solutions
27. Use the divide-and-average method to estimate the square root 
of 153.
If we start with an estimate of 12, 153 ÷ 12 = 12 9/12 = 12.75, and 
their average is 12.375. (Exact answer begins 12.369…)
28. Speaking of 153, that’s the ¿ rst 3-digit number equal to the sum 
of the cubes of its digits (153 = 13 + 53 + 33). The next number 
with that property is 370. Can you ¿ nd the third number with 
that property? 
Since 370 = 33 + 73 + 03, it follows that 371 = 33 + 73 + 13.

11. What is the remainder (not the quotient) when you divide 
12,345,678 by 9?
Summing the digits, 12,345,678 ĺ 36 ĺ 9, so the number is a 
multiple of 9, so dividing 12,345,678 by 9 yields a remainder of 0.
12. After doing the multiplication problem 1234 × 567,890, you get an 
answer that looks like 700,7#6,260, but the ¿ fth digit is smudged, 
and you can’t read it. Use casting out nines to determine the value 
of the smudged number. 
Using digit sums, 1234 ĺ 1 and 567,890 ĺ 8, so their product 
must reduce to 1 × 8 = 8. 
Summing the other digits, 7 + 0 + 0 + 7 + 6 + 2 + 6 + 0 = 28 ĺ 1, so 
the smudged digit must be 7 in order to reach a total of 8.

Here are the year codes for the years 2000 to 2040. The pattern repeats every 
28 years (through 2099). For year codes in the 20th century, simply add 1 to 
the corresponding year code in the 21st century.

Solutions
1. Write down the month codes for each month in a leap year. How 
does the code change when it is not a leap year?
If it is not a leap year, the month codes are (from January to 
December) 622 503 514 624.
In a leap year, the code for January changes to 5 and February 
changes to 1. 
2. Explain why each year must always have at least one Friday the 13th 
and can never have more than three Friday the 13ths. 
This comes from the fact that in every year (whether or not it’s a 
leap year), all seven month codes, 0 through 6, are used at least 
once, and no code is used more than three times. For example, if 
it is not a leap year and the year had three Friday the 13ths, they 
must have occurred in February, March, and November (all three 
months have the same month code of 2). In a leap year, this can 
only happen for the months of January, April, and July (with the 
same month code of 5). 
Determine the days of the week for the following dates. Feel free to use the 
year codes from the chart.
3. August 3, 2000 = month code + date + year code – multiple of 7 
 
= 1 + 3 + 0 = 4 = Thursday
4. November 29, 2000 = 2 + 29 + 0 – 28 = 3 = Wednesday
5. February 29, 2000 = 1 + 29 + 0 – 28 = 2 = Tuesday
6. December 21, 2012 = 4 + 21 + 1 – 21 = 5 = Friday
7. September 13, 2013 = 4 + 13 + 2 – 14 = 5 = Friday
8. January 6, 2018 = 6 + 6 + 1 = 13 – 7 = 6 = Saturday

133
Calculate the year codes for the following years using the formula: year + 
leaps – multiple of 7.
9. 2020: Since leaps = 20 ÷ 4 = 5, the year code is 20 + 5 – 21 = 4. 
10. 2033: Since leaps = 33 ÷ 4 = 8 (with remainder 1, which we ignore), 
the year code is 33 + 8 – 35 = 6.
11. 2047: year code = 47 + 11 – 56 = 2
12. 2074: year code = 74 + 18 – 91 = 1 (or 74 + 18 – 70 – 21 = 1)
13. 2099: year code = 99 + 24 – 119 = 4 (or 99 + 24 – 70 – 49 = 4)
Determine the days of the week for the following dates.
14. May 2, 2002: year code = 2; 
month + date + year code – multiple of 7 = 0 + 2 + 2 = 4 = Thursday
15. February 3, 2058: year code = 58 + 14 – 70 = 2; 
day = 2 + 3 + 2 – 7 = 0 = Sunday
16. August 8, 2088: year code = 88 + 22 – 105 = 5; 
day = 1 + 8 + 5 – 14 = 0 = Sunday
17. June 31, 2016: Ha! This date doesn’t exist! But the calculation 
would produce an answer of 3 + 31 + 6 – 35 = 5 = Friday.
18. December 31, 2099: year code = 4 (above); 
day = 4 + 31 + 4 – 35 = 4 = Thursday
19. Determine the date of Mother’s Day (second Sunday in May) 
for 2016.
The year 2016 has year code 6, and May has month code 0. 6 + 0 = 6. 
To reach Sunday, we must get a total of 7 or 14 or 21. … The ¿ rst 
Sunday is May 1 (since 6 + 1 = 7), so the second Sunday is May 8.

134
Solutions
20. Determine the date of Thanksgiving (fourth Thursday in November) 
for 2020. 
The year 2020 has year code 4, and November has month code 2: 
4 + 2 = 6. To reach Thursday, we must get a day code of 4 or 11 
or 18. … Since 6 + 5 = 11, the ¿ rst Thursday in November will be 
November 5. Thus, the fourth Thursday in November is November 
5 + 21 = November 26.
For years in the 1900s, we use the formula: year + leaps + 1 – multiple of 7. 
Determine the year codes for the following years.
21. 1902: year code = 2 + 0 + 1 – 0 = 3
22. 1919: year code = 19 + 4 + 1 – 21 = 3
23. 1936: year code = 36 + 9 + 1 – 42 = 4
24. 1948: year code = 48 + 12 + 1 – 56 = 5
25. 1984: year code = 84 + 21 + 1 – 105 = 1
26. 1999: year code = 99 + 24 + 1 – 119 = 5 (This makes sense because 
the following year, 2000, is a leap year, which has year code 
5 + 2 – 7 = 0.)
27. Explain why the calendar repeats itself every 28 years when the 
years are between 1901 and 2099. 
Between 1901 and 2099, a leap year occurs every 4 years, even 
when it includes the year 2000. Thus any 28 consecutive between 
1901 and 2099 will contain exactly 7 leap years. Hence, in a 28-
year period, the calendar will shift 28 for each year plus 7 more 
times for each leap year for a total shifting of 35 days. Because 35 
is a multiple of 7, the days of the week stay the same. 

135
28. Use the 28-year rule to simplify the calculation of the year codes 
for 1984 and 1999. 
For 1984, we subtract 28 × 3 = 84 from 1984. Thus, 1984 has the 
same year code as 1900, which has year code 1.
For 1999, we subtract 84 to get 1915, which has year code 
15 + 3 + 1 – 14 = 5.
Determine the days of the week for the following dates.
29. November 11, 1911: year code = 11 + 2 + 1 – 14 = 0; 
day = 2 + 11 + 0 – 7 = 6 = Saturday
30. March 22, 1930: year code = 30 + 7 + 1 – 35 = 3; 
day = 2 + 22 + 3 – 21 = 6 = Saturday
31. January 16, 1964: year code = 64 + 16 +1 – 77 = 4; 
day = 5 (leap year) + 16 + 4 – 21 = 4 = Thursday 
32. August 4, 1984: year code = 1 (above); 
day = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6 = Saturday 
33. December 31, 1999: year code = 5 (above); 
day = 4 + 31 + 5 – 35 = 5 = Friday
For years in the 1800s, the formula for the year code is years + leaps + 3 – 
multiple of 7. For years in the 1700s, the formula for the year code is years + 
leaps + 5 – multiple of 7. And for years in the 1600s, the formula for the year 
code is years + leaps – multiple of 7. Use this knowledge to determine the 
days of the week for the following dates from the Gregorian calendar. 
34. February 12, 1809 (Birthday of Abe Lincoln and Charles Darwin): 
year code = 9 + 2 + 3 – 14 = 0; day = 2 + 12 + 0 – 14 = 0 = Sunday.

136
Solutions
35. March 14, 1879 (Birthday of Albert Einstein): 
year code = 79 + 19 + 3 – 98 = 3; day = 2 + 14 + 3 – 14 = 5 = Friday. 
36. July 4, 1776 (Signing of the Declaration of Independence): 
year code = 76 + 19 + 5 – 98 = 2; day = 5 + 4 + 2 – 7 = 4 = Thursday.
37. April 15, 1707 (Birthday of Leonhard Euler): 
year code = 7 + 1 + 5 – 7 = 6; day = 5 + 15 + 6  21 = 5 = Friday. 
38. April 23, 1616 (Death of Miguel Cervantes): 
year code = 16 + 4 – 14 = 6; day = 5 + 23 + 6 – 28 = 6 = Saturday. 
39. Explain why the calendar repeats itself every 400 years in the 
Gregorian calendar. (Hint: how many leap years will occur in a 
400-year period?)
In a 400-year period, the number of leap years is 100 – 3 = 97. 
(Recall that in the next 400 years, 2100, 2200, and 2300 are not 
leap years, but 2400 is a leap year.) Hence, the calendar will shift 
400 times (once for each year) plus 97 more times (for each leap 
year), for a total of 497 shifts. Because 497 is a multiple of 7 
(= 7 × 71), the day of the week will be the same. 
40. Determine the day of the week of January 1, 2100. 
This day will be the same as January 1, 1700 (not a leap year), 
which has year code 5; hence, the day of the week will be 6 + 1 + 
5 – 7 = 5 = Friday; this is consistent with our earlier calculation that 
December 31, 2099 is a Thursday.
41. William Shakespeare and Miguel Cervantes both died on April 23, 
1616, yet their deaths were 10 days apart. How can that be?

137
Cervantes was from Spain, which adopted the Gregorian calendar. 
England, Shakespeare’s home, was still on the Julian calendar, 
which was 10 days “behind” the Gregorian calendar. When 
Shakespeare died on the Julian date of April 23, 1616, the Gregorian 
date was May 3, 1616.

(SNAIL) = 3,404,025
(Note: 2 × 169 = 200 + 120 + 18 = 320 + 18 = 338, so 2 × 1690 
= 3,380. Note also that the number 1690 can be found by doubling 
1845, giving 3690, which splits into 2000 and 1690.)

(Note: 3 × 2196 = 3 × 2000 + 3 × 196 = 6000 + (300 + 270 + 18) 
= 6000 + (570 + 18) = 6588. Note also that 2598 × 2 = 5196

(Note: 5 × 4528 = 5 × 4500 + 5 × 28 = 22,500 + 140 = 22,640. Note 
also that 4764 × 2 = 9528 = 5000 + 4528.)

BONUS MATERIAL: We can also compute the exact value of a cube with 
only a little more effort. For example, to cube 42, we use z = 40 and d = 2. 
The approximate cube is 40 × 40 × 46 = 73,600. To get the exact cube, we 
can use the following algebra: (z + d) 3 = z(z(z + 3d) + 3d 2) + d 3. First, we do 
z(z + 3d) + 3d 2 = 40 × 46 + 12 = 1852. Then, we multiply this number by z 
again: 1852 × 40 = 74,080. Finally, we add d 3 = 23 = 8 to get 74,088. 
Notice that when cubing a 2-digit number, in our ¿ rst addition step, the value 
of 3d 2 can be one of only ¿ ve numbers: 3, 12, 27, 48, or 75. Speci¿ cally, 
if the number ends in 1 (so d = 1) or ends in 9 (so d = –1), then 3d 2 = 3. 
Similarly, if the last digit is 2 or 8, we add 12; if it’s 3 or 7, we add 27; if it’s 
4 or 6, we add 48; if it’s 5, we add 75. Then, in the last step, we will always 
add or subtract one of ¿ ve numbers, based on d 3. Here’s the pattern:
If last digit is…
1
2
3

5

9
Adjust by…
 +1 +8 +27 +64 +125 –64 –27 –8 –1

Solutions
For example, what is the cube of 96? Here, z = 100 and d = –4. The 
approximate cube would be 100 × 100 × 88 = 880,000. For the exact cube, 
we ¿ rst do 100 × 88 + 48 = 8848. Then we multiply by 100 and subtract 64: 
8848 × 100 – 64 = 884,800 – 64 = 884,736. 
Using these examples as a guide, compute the exact values of the 
following cubes.
52. 133 = (10 × 19 + 27) × 10 + 33 = 2170 + 27 = 2197

55. 593 = (60 × 57 + 3) × 60 + (–1)3 = 3423 × 60 – 1 = 205,379
(Note: 3423 × 6 = 3400 × 6 + 23 × 6 = 20,400 + 138 = 20,538)
56. 723 = (70 × 76 + 12) × 70 + 23 = 5332 × 70 + 8 = 373,248

1. If an item costs $36.78, how much change would you get from $100?
Because the dollars sum to 99 and the cents sum to 100, the change 
is $63.22.

143
2. Do the mental subtraction problem: 1618 – 789.
1618 – 789 = 1618 – (800 – 11) – 818 + 11 = 829
Do the following multiplication problems.
3. 13 × 18 = (13 + 8) × 10 + (3 × 8) = 210 + 24 = 234
4. 65 × 65 = 60 × 70 + 52 = 4200 + 25 = 4225
5. 997 × 996 = (1000 × 993) + (3) × (4) = 993,012
6. Is the number 72,534 a multiple of 11? 
Yes, because 7  2 + 5 – 3 + 4 = 11.
7. What is the remainder when you divide 72,534 by a multiple of 9?
Because 7 + 2 + 5 + 3 + 4 = 21, which sums to 3, the remainder is 3.
8. Determine 23/7 to 6 decimal places.
23/7 = 3 2/7 = 3.285714 (repeated)
9. If you multiply a 5-digit number beginning with 5 by a 6-digit 
number beginning with 6, then how many digits will be 
in the answer? 
Just from the number of digits in the problem, you know the answer 
must be either 11 digits or 10 digits. Then, because the product of 
the initial digits in this particular problem (5 × 6 = 30), is more than 
10, the answer is de¿ nitely the longer of the two choices, in this 
case 11 digits.

144
Solutions
10. Estimate the square root of 70.
70 ÷ 8 = 8 3/4 = 8.75. Averaging 8 and 8.75 gives us an estimate 
of 8.37.
(Exact answer begins 8.366… .)
Do the following problems on paper and just write down the answer.
11. 509 × 325 = 165,425 (by criss-cross method).
12. 21,401 ÷ 9: Using the Vedic method, we get 2 3 7 7 R 8.
13. 34,567 ÷ 89: Using the Vedic method, with divisor 9 and multiplier 
1, we get:

14. Use the phonetic code to memorize the following chemical 
elements: Aluminum is the 13th element, copper is the 29th element, 
and lead is the 82nd element. 
Aluminum = 13 = DIME or TOMB. An aluminum can ¿ lled with 
DIMEs or maybe a TOMBstone that was “Aluminated”? 
Copper = 29 = KNOB or NAP. A doorKNOB made of copper or a 
COP taking a NAP. 
Lead = 82 = VAN or FUN. A VAN ¿ lled with lead pipes or maybe 
being “lead” to a FUN event. 
15. What day of the week was March 17, 2000? Day = 2 + 17 + 0 – 14 
= 5 = Friday.
16. Compute 2122 = 200 × 224 + 122 = 44,800 + 144 = 44,944

145
17. Why must the cube root of a 4-, 5-, or 6-digit number be a 
2-digit number? 
The largest 1-digit cube is 93 = 729, which has 3 digits, and a 3-digit 
cube must be at least 1003 = 1,000,000, which has 7 digits.
Find the cube roots of the following numbers. 
18. 12,167 has cube root 23.
19. 357,911 has cube root 71.
20. 175,616 has cube root 56.
21. 205,379 has cube root 59.
The next few problems will allow us to ¿ nd the cube root when the original 
number is the cube of a 3-digit number. We’ll ¿ rst build up some ideas to 
¿ nd the cube root of 17,173,512, which is the cube of a 3-digit number.
22. Why must the ¿ rst digit of the answer be 2? 
2003 = 8,000,000 and 3003 = 27,000,000, so the answer must be in 
the 200s.
23. Why must the last digit of the answer be 8?
Because 8 is the only digit that, when cubed, ends in 2.
24. How can we quickly tell that 17,173,512 is a multiple of 9?
By adding its digits, which sum to 27, a multiple of 9.
25. It follows that the 3-digit number must be a multiple of 3 (because 
if the 3-digit number was not a multiple of 3, then its cube could not 
be a multiple of 9). What middle digits would result in the number 
2_8 being a multiple of 3? There are three possibilities. 

146
Solutions
For 2_8 to be a multiple of 3, its digits must sum to a multiple of 3. 
This works only when the middle number is 2, 5, or 8 because the 
digit sums of 228, 258, and 288 are 12, 15, and 18, respectively.
26. Use estimation to choose which of the three possibilities is 
most reasonable. 
Since 17,000,000 is nearly halfway between 8,000,000 and 
27,000,000, the middle choice, 258, seems most reasonable. Indeed, 
if we approximate the cube of 26 as 30 × 30 × 22 = 19,800, we get 
2603, which is about 20 million, consistent with our answer.
Using the steps above, we can do cube roots of any 3-digit cubes. The ¿ rst 
digit can be determined by looking at the millions digits (the numbers before 
the ¿ rst comma); the last digit can be determined by looking at the last digit 
of the cube; the middle digit can be determined through digit sums and 
estimation. There will always be three or four possibilities for the middle 
digit; they can be determined using the following observations, which you 
should verify. 
27. Verify that if the digit sum of a number is 3, 6, or 9, then its cube 
will have digit sum 9.
If the digit sum is 3, 6, or 9, then the number is a multiple of 3, 
which when cubed will be a multiple of 9; thus, its digits will sum 
to 9.
28. Verify that if the digit sum of a number is 1, 4, or 7, then its cube 
will have digit sum 1.
A number with digit sum 1, when cubed, will have a digit sum 
that can be reduced to 13 = 1. Likewise, 43 = 64 reduces to 1 and 
73 = 343 reduces to 1.

147
29. Verify that if the digit sum of a number is 2, 5, or 8, then its cube 
will have digit sum 8. 
Similarly, a number with digit sum 2, 5, or 8, when cubed, will have 
the same digit sum as 23 = 8, 53 = 125, and 83 = 512, respectively, all 
of which have digit sum 8.
Using these ideas, determine the 3-digit number that produces the 
cubes below.
30. Find the cube root of 212,776,173.
Since 53 < 212 < 63, the ¿ rst digit is 5, and since 73 ends in 3, the 
last digit is 7. Thus, the answer looks like 5_7. The digit sum of 
212,776,173 is 36, which is a multiple of 9, so the number 5_7 must 
be a multiple of 3. Hence, the middle digit must be 0, 3, 6, or 9 
(because the digit sums of 507, 537, 567, and 597 are all multiples 
of 3). Given that 212,000,000 is so close to 6003 (= 216,000,000), 
we pick the largest choice: 597.
31. Find the cube root of 374,805,361. 
Since 73 < 374 < 83, the ¿ rst digit is 7, and since only 13 ends in 
1, the last digit is 1. Thus, the answer looks like 7_1. The digit 
sum of 74,805,361 is 37, which has digit sum 1; by our previous 
observation, 7_1 must have a digit sum that reduces to 1, 4, or 7. 
Hence, the middle digit must be 2, 5, or 8 (because 721, 751, and 
781 have digit sums 10, 13, and 16, which reduce to 1, 4, and 7, 
respectively). Given that 374 is much closer to 343 than it is to 512, 
we choose the smallest possibility, 721. To be on the safe side, we 
estimate 723 as 70 × 70 × 76 = 372,400, which means that 7203 is 
about 372,000,000; thus, the answer 721 must be correct.

148
Solutions
32. Find the cube root of 4,410,944. 
Here, 13 < 4 < 23, so the ¿ rst digit is 1, and (by examining the last 
digit) the last digit must be 4. Hence, the answer looks like 1_4. 
The digit sum of 4,410,944 is 26, which reduces to 8, so 1_4 must 
reduce to 2, 5, or 8. Thus, the middle digit must be 0, 3, 6, or 9. 
Given that 4 is comfortably between 13 and 23, it must be 134 or 
164. Since 163 = 16 × 16 × 16 = 256 × 8 × 2 = 2048 × 2 = 4096, we 
choose the answer 164.
Compute the following 5-digit squares in your head! (Note that the necessary 
2-by-3 and 3-digit square calculations were given in the solutions to 
Lecture 11.)
33. 11,2352
11 × 235 × 2 = 2585 × 2 = 5,170. So 11,000 × 235 × 2 = 5,170,000.
We can hold the 5 on our ¿ ngers and turn 170 into DUCKS. 11,0002 
= 121,000,000, which when added to 5 million gives us 126 million, 
which we can say. Next, we have 2352 = 55,225, which when added 
to 170,000, gives us the rest of the answer: 225,225. Final answer 
= 126,225,225.
34. 56,7532
56,000 × 753 × 2 = 56 × 753 × 2 × 1000 = 42,168 × 2 × 1000 
= 84,336,000 = FIRE, MY MATCH. 
56,0002 = 3,136,000,000, so we can say “3 billion.” After adding 
136 to 84 (FIRE), we can say “220 million.” Then, 7532 = 567,009, 
which when added to 336,000 (MY MATCH) gives the rest of the 
answer, 903,009. Final answer = 3,220,903,009.

149
35. 82,6822
82,000 × 682 × 2 = 82 × 682 × 2 × 1000 = 55,924 × 2 × 1000 
= 111,848 = DOTTED, VERIFY.
82,0002 = 6,724,000,000, so we can say “6 billion,” then add 
724 to 111 (DOTTED) to get 835 million, but because we see a 
carry coming (from 848,000 + 6822), we say “836 million.” Next, 
6822 = 465,124 (turning 124 into TENOR, if helpful). Now, 
465,000 + 848,000 (VERIFY) = 1,313,000, but we have already 
taken care of the leading 1, so we can say “313 thousand,” followed 
by (TENOR) 124. Final answer = 6,836,313,124.

Glossary
addition method: A method for multiplying numbers by breaking the 
problem into sums of numbers. For example, 4 × 17 = (4 × 10) + (4 × 7) = 40 
+ 28 = 68, or 41 × 17 = (40 × 17) + (1 × 17) = 680 + 17 = 697.
associative law: A law of multiplication that for any numbers a, b, c, (a × b) 
× c = a × (b × c). For example, 23 × 16 = 23 × (8 × 2) = (23 × 8) × 2. There is 
also an associative law of addition: (a + b) + c = a + (b + c).
Benford’s law: The phenomenon that most of the numbers we encounter 
begin with smaller digits rather than larger digits. Speci¿ cally, for many 
real-world problems (from home addresses, to tax returns, to distances 
to galaxies), the ¿ rst digit is N with probability log(N+1) – log(N), where 
log(N) is the base 10 logarithm of N satisfying 10log(N) = N.
casting out nines (also known as the method of digit sums): A method of 
verifying an addition, subtraction, or multiplication problem by reducing 
each number in the problem to a 1-digit number obtained by adding the 
digits. For example, 67 sums to 13, which sums to 4, and 83 sums to 11, 
which sums to 2. When verifying that 67 + 83 = 150, we see that 150 sums 
to 6, which is consistent with 4 + 2 = 6. When verifying 67 × 83 = 5561, we 
see that 5561 sums to 17 which sums to 8, which is consistent with 4 × 2 = 8. 
close-together method: A method for multiplying two numbers that are 
close together. When the close-together method is applied to 23 × 26, we 
calculate (20 × 29) + (3 × 6) = 580 + 18 = 598. 
complement: The distance between a number and a convenient round 
number, typically, 100 or 1000. For example, the complement of 43 is 57 
since 43 + 57 = 100.
create-a-zero, kill-a-zero method: A method for testing whether a number 
is divisible by another number by adding or subtracting a multiple of the 
second number so that the original number ends in zero. 

153
criss-cross method: A quick method for multiplying numbers on paper. The 
answer is written from right to left, and nothing else is written down. 
cube root: A number that, when cubed, produces a given number. For 
example, the cube root of 8 is 2 since 2 × 2 × 2 = 8.
cubing: Raising a number to the third power. For example, the cube of 4, 
denoted 43, is equal to 64. 
distributive law: The rule of arithmetic that combines addition with 
multiplication, speci¿ cally a × (b + c) = (a × b) + (a × c).
factoring method: A method for multiplying numbers by factoring one of 
the numbers into smaller parts. For example, 35 × 14 = 35 × 2 × 7 = 70 × 7 
= 490. 
Gregorian calendar: Established by Pope Gregory XIII in 1582, it replaced 
the Julian calendar to more accurately reÀ ect the length of the Earth’s 
average orbit around the Sun; it did so by allowing three fewer leap years 
for every 400 years. Under the Julian calendar, every 4 years was a leap year, 
even when the year was divisible by 100. 
leap year: A year with 366 days. According to our Gregorian calendar, a 
year is usually a leap year if it is divisible by 4. However, if the year is 
divisible by 100 and not by 400, then it is not a leap year. For example, 1700, 
1800, and 1900 are not leap years, but 2000 is a leap year. In the 21st century, 
2004, 2008, …, 2096 are leap years, but 2100 is not a leap year. 
left to right: The “right” way to do mental math.
Major system: A phonetic code that assigns consonant sounds to digits. For 
example 1 gets the t or d sound, 2 gets the n sound, and so on. By inserting 
vowel sounds, numbers can be turned into words, which make them easier 
to remember. It is named after Major Beniowski, a leading memory expert 
in London, although the code was developed by Gregor von Feinagle and 
perfected by Aimé Paris. 

154
Glossary
math of least resistance: Choosing the easiest mental calculating strategy 
among several possibilities. For example, to do the problem 43 × 28, it is 
easier to do 43 × 7 × 4 = 301 × 4 = 1204 than to do 43 × 4 × 7 = 172 × 7. 
peg system: A way to remember lists of objects, especially when the items 
of the list are given a number, such as the list of presidents, elements, or 
constitutional amendments. Each number is turned into a word using a 
phonetic code, and that word is linked to the object to be remembered.
right to left: The “wrong” way to do mental math.
square root: A number that, when multiplied by itself, produces a given 
number. For example, the square root of 9 is 3 and the square root of 2 
begins 1.414…. Incidentally, the square root is de¿ ned to be greater than or 
equal to zero, so the square root of 9 is not –3, even though –3 multiplied by 
itself is also 9. 
squaring: Multiplying a number by itself. For example, the square of 5 is 25.
subtraction method: A method for multiplying numbers by turning the 
original problem into a subtraction problem. For example, 9 × 79 = (9 × 80) 
– (9 × 1) = 720 – 9 = 711, or 19 × 37 = (20 × 37) – (1 × 37) = 740 – 37 = 703. 
Vedic mathematics: A collection of arithmetic and algebraic shortcut 
techniques, especially suitable for pencil and paper calculations, that were 
popularized by BhƗratƯ Krishna TirthajƯ in the 20th century.

Tekriwal, Gaurav. 5 DVD Set on Vedic Maths. www.vedicmathsindia.org/
dvd.htm, 2009. Provides video instruction on Vedic mathematics, taught by 
the president of the Vedic Maths Forum in India. The instructor goes through 
10 hours worth of problems, standing in front of a whiteboard. Among the 
topics included are the close-together method, the criss-cross method, Vedic 
division, and solutions of various algebraic equations. 
TirthajƯ, BhƗratƯ Krishna. Vedic Mathematics. Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass 
Publishers Private Ltd., 1992 (1965). The book from which all other books 
on Vedic mathematics are derived. A good deal of material is presented 
on mental arithmetic (mostly for pencil-and-paper purposes) and algebra, 
including much that is not covered in this course. The book is somewhat 
challenging to read because of the quality of exposition and some 
of its notation.
Weinstein, Lawrence, and John Adam. Guesstimation: Solving the World’s 
Problems on the Back of a Cocktail Napkin. Princeton, NJ: Princeton 
University Press, 2008. Written by two physicists using nothing more than 
basic arithmetic, this book provides interesting strategies for coming up with 
reasonable estimates (within a factor of 10) of problems that initially sound 
impossible to comprehend. Filled with plenty of interesting examples, such

as how many golf balls would be needed to circle the equator or how many 
acres of farmland would be required to fuel your car with ethanol.
Williams, Kenneth, and Mark Gaskell. The Cosmic Calculator: A Vedic 
Mathematics Course for Schools, Book 3. New Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass 
Publishers, 2002. This book describes, using notation different from mine, 
the Vedic method for division problems and an interesting method for doing 
square roots, along with topics from algebra, geometry, and probability that 
do not pertain to mental calculation. Two other books with the same name 
are also available that cover similar topics.

Lorayne, Harry. How to Perform Feats of Mathematical Wizardry. New 
York: Harry Lorayne, 2006. This book is written for magicians who wish to 
amaze their audiences with amazing feats of mind and other mathematically 
based tricks. 
Sticker, Henry. How to Calculate Quickly. New York: Dover Publications, 
1955. A collection of 383 groups of problems (literally, more than 9000 
problems) designed to give you practice at doing mental arithmetic. It’s 
mostly problems without a lot of exposition. If you are looking for an 
inexpensive Dover book, the book by Kelly is superior. 
Stoddard, Edward. Speed Mathematics Simpli¿ ed. New York: Dover 
Publications, 1994 (1965). This book takes a radically different approach 
from all the other books and is motivated by the system for using a manual 
abacus. For example, to add 8 to a number, subtract 2, then add 10. This idea 
eliminates the need for nearly half of the addition table and shows new ways 
to represent addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division problems, 
all done from left to right. It’s an interesting approach that some might 
appreciate, but the methods taught in the Stoddard book are very different 
from the ones taught in this course.
