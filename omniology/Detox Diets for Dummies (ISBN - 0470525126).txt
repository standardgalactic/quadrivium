About the Authors
Gerald Don Wootan, DO, M.Ed.: Dr. Wootan is an osteopathic 
physician board certified in family practice and geriatrics. He 
holds bachelors’ degrees in biology, psychology, and medicine, 
a master’s degree in counseling psychology, and a doctorate in 
osteopathic medicine with board certification in family practice 
and geriatrics. He is the medical director of Jenks Health Team in 
Jenks, Oklahoma, a medical practice that specializes in integra-
tive medicine with a strong emphasis on natural detoxification 
and nutritional supplementation. He is also the Medical Director 
of Narconon Arrowhead, an inpatient drug treatment facility that 
utilizes natural therapies. Dr. Wootan is trained in and utilizes the 
Defeat Autism Now! protocol for treating children on the autism 
spectrum and is an active member of the American College for the 
Advancement of Medicine.
M. Brittain Phillips: Brittain didn’t used to think much about 
toxins, but after working with Dr. Wootan on this project he’s not 
putting anything in his shopping cart without checking the label 
for high fructose corn syrup. (It’s everywhere!) He studied biology 
and English at DePauw University, and he’s happy to report that 
with this project he finally found a way to combine the disciplines. 
He works and writes in Charleston, South Carolina.


Dedication
Jerry: This book is dedicated to my mother and father, Corrine 
and Ralph Wootan, and my uncle, Howard Mauldin, MD. My mother 
showed me true unconditional love and instilled in me a feeling of 
introspective self-worth that has lasted me my entire life. My father 
showed me that dreams can be attained and that discipline is the 
way to get there. From my earliest memories, my Uncle Howard 
was my inspiration and role model as a physician and as a person.
Brittain: For Mimi. Moderation in all things, indeed. 
Authors’ Acknowledgments
Jerry thanks his office staff, and specifically Nancy Smith, who did 
so much to support him and allow him the time to do this work. He 
also thanks Mike Mahoney, Vice President of Xymogen Exclusive 
Professional Formulas; his daughter Heather Walters, ND; and 
his brother, George Wootan, MD, for their support and input on 
technical aspects of detoxing; and his sister Darla Nesom for being 
there. He gives a special note of thanks for the staff at Wiley for 
their assistance during their entire writing process. This book 
would not have been possible without the guidance and assistance 
of Brittain Phillips.
Brittain thanks Dr. Wootan for his professionalism and patience 
throughout this project. He thanks Cindy, who was right about 
this stuff all along; mom and dad, who set the perfect example; and 
Sarah, who never ceases to amaze.

Introduction
F
ew things in the world are as pristine as a newborn baby, right? For 
thousands of years, a brand new bundle of joy represented all that was 
pure. But just in the last century or so, the world has changed quite a lot, 
and so have our babies. A recent study showed that an average newborn 
has detectable levels of more than 200 toxic or cancer-causing chemicals 
on the day of birth. That’s a shocking but very real indication that you are 
constantly exposed to an enormous amount of chemicals that are toxic to 
humans. (Is it any wonder that 1 in every 6 children has a neuropsychological 
disorder? Or that autism, which is associated with exposure to toxins, now 
affects 1 in every 91 children?)
Quite a lot of damage is done to the environment in the name of progress, 
and at the top of the list is the spread of toxins into the air, water, and soil. 
Many people have long had faith that the commercial interests driving the 
progress would be strict with their pollution policies and work to ensure that 
toxic substances aren’t released into the environment. Beyond that, govern-
ment entities at all levels have assured us that they are monitoring these 
developments and keeping us safe from toxic influences. Unfortunately, the 
facts prove otherwise.
The development of industry has expanded much more rapidly than the 
resources available to monitor it. As a result, today more than 80,000 man-
made chemicals are released into the environment each year, and fewer than 
3,000 of them have been tested to determine their toxic effects on humans. 
Some of the most toxic materials have been banned, but often those bans 
don’t cross borders. That means, for example, that a pesticide may be 
banned in the United States but used extensively in a neighboring country 
that ships crops directly to U.S. food providers. Air pollutants travel even 
easier, and they end up settling on water sources and open land if they don’t 
invade our lungs.
The fact is that the world is more toxic now than it has been since the 
dawn of mankind, and it’s not likely to get considerably less toxic anytime 
soon. That’s the bad news. The good news is that your body is a marvelous 
machine that does a really good job of taking care of itself. It’s able to flush 
out quite a bit of the toxic material that ends up inside you.
But even the strongest body can’t win the fight alone. You have to work hard 
to limit the amount of toxins entering your system, and you have to take a 
proactive approach to detoxifying the harmful substances already in your 
body. If you suffer from chronic illness or autoimmune disease, you simply 

2
Detox Diets For Dummies 
must look at toxic triggers for these illnesses. The process starts with your 
diet, but several other useful options for detoxification exist. In this book, I 
include plenty of information on a range of these considerations — from diet 
to saunas to supplements and more.
About This Book
My goal in this book is to show you how you can cut down on your intake of 
toxins and detoxify your life so that you can enjoy the best possible health 
for as long as you’re on the top side of the grass.
Your diet is the most important factor when it comes to determining how 
toxic you are. (You are what you eat, after all.) I spend quite a bit of time pro-
viding you with details on how you can shape your diet and eating habits so 
that you’re getting the maximum detox effect. But I don’t stop with diet, and 
you shouldn’t either. Given the toxic threats all around us, you’ll be wise to 
consider any and all options for flushing toxins out of your body and out of 
your life. The truth is that everyone is exposed to toxins on a daily basis, and 
you need to do everything you can to reduce the damage those toxins are 
doing on your body and mind.
Embracing the ideas and practices behind detoxification isn’t always easy 
because traditional medicine doesn’t usually focus on the presence and influ-
ence of toxins. Many doctors and most pharmaceutical companies are luke-
warm at best to the idea that toxins are causing a lot of the ailments that are 
becoming more and more prevalent every year.
That means you need to be your own advocate and take the time to familiar-
ize yourself with all the various threats and how they can affect you. You 
need to invest time, but by doing so you’re investing in your future health — 
your most important asset. You have to take charge of your own health and 
assume responsibility for the outcome. Doctors can offer some good infor-
mation, but in the end the decisions are yours. I challenge you to look at the 
facts about toxicity and use common sense to determine what remedies you 
need to incorporate into your life and the lives of your loved ones.
Conventions Used in This Book 
Following are a few conventions I use to help guide you through the book:
 
✓ I use a number of medical and health-related terms in this book that you 
may not be familiar with. In those cases I italicize the jargony term and 
follow it up immediately with a definition.

3
 Introduction
 
✓ I also present a lot of acronyms throughout the book. To prevent you 
from drowning in alphabet soup, I spell out the full words the first time 
an acronym is used in a chapter.
 
✓ In Part III, I include several recipes in each chapter. If you’re a vegetar-
ian, look for the tomato next to the recipe name that indicates the recipe 
does not contain meat or fish. (Be aware that the recipe may contain 
eggs or cheese, however.)
 
✓ All Web addresses appear in monofont so they’re easy to pick out.
Keep in mind that when this book was printed, some Web addresses may 
have needed to break across two lines of text. Wherever that’s the case, rest 
assured that we haven’t put in any extra characters (such as hyphens) to 
indicate the break. So, when using one of these Web addresses, just type in 
exactly what you see in this book. Pretend as if the line break doesn’t exist. 
What You’re Not to Read
In the interest of full disclosure, I want to let you know that you have to read 
every word in this book. As soon as you’re done I’ll give you a call, and you’ll 
have to take an essay test on the topics I cover. Hope you have a flexible 
phone plan.
Seriously: Each part and chapter in the book contain their own information, 
and where you may want to jump around from chapter to chapter I’ve inserted 
cross references to facilitate your page flipping. Feel free to skip around.
If you have absolutely no regard for my feelings and you’re not interested in 
reading every single word in the book, you may consider skipping the side-
bars, which contain interesting but not essential information. Sidebars are 
contained in the gray shaded boxes.
Foolish Assumptions
I’ve written this book with a few assumptions about you in mind. Here are 
those assumptions, in no particular order:
 
✓ I assume you’re on board with the fact that our planet is currently 
chock-full of toxins and that those toxins can affect your well-being.
 
✓ I assume you know diet is important to your health.

4
Detox Diets For Dummies 
 
✓ I assume you’re at least willing to consider that traditional medicine doesn’t 
currently have all the answers for the various diseases and conditions 
plaguing people in increasing numbers, and that medical professionals 
could very well be underestimating the influence that toxins have on our 
bodies and our collective health.
How This Book Is Organized
I’ve divided this book into five parts. Each part covers a different aspect of 
detoxification, and the information I offer on the impact that diet has on your 
detoxification is pretty strong throughout. The great news is that you can 
jump around all you want; you don’t have to read Part I in order to understand 
Part III, for example.
Part I: Getting to the Bottom 
of Natural Detoxification
If you’re new to detoxification, it won’t hurt to check out Chapter 1. That 
chapter is an overview of toxicity and detoxification ideas. Read it if you want 
to find out what detoxification means and what it can do for you.
The rest of the chapters in Part I clue you in on the many different kinds of 
toxins that surround you, how they end up in your body, and (perhaps most 
importantly) how your body manages to flush quite a lot of them out. You’ll 
be surprised at some of the places where toxins are hiding and what they can 
do to your health. This information is a little scary, but it’s also necessary 
because you have to know where the toxins are coming from if you’re going 
to try to avoid them.
Part II: Working toward a Detoxified 
Life: Getting Started
Part II gives you the details on how you can get started on a detoxification 
regimen. It opens with Chapter 5, which fills you in on a few basics (most of 
them diet-related) for detoxing. The part then proceeds with a couple chap-
ters that tell you how to dodge toxin-filled foods and — even better — what 
you should be buying at the grocery store to fill up your pantry and fridge 
with nontoxic options. You may be amazed at the range and amount of toxins 
that you can find in very common food items.

5
 Introduction
I wrap up Part II with a quiz that you can take to figure out just how toxic you 
are. The quiz takes up all of Chapter 8.
Part III: Enhancing Wellness 
through Detoxification
Part III really gets down to the nitty gritty of how toxins affect various aspects 
of your health and how you can detoxify — especially with your diet — to 
keep those areas of your health in top-notch shape. I tell you how to maintain 
a healthy weight, boost your immune system, increase your energy level, quit 
smoking, and much more!
Throughout this part you find an excellent feature of this book: wholesome, 
healthy, detox recipes that you can make yourself to help ensure your diet is 
contributing to your health in a toxin-free way.
Part IV: Maintaining Healthy 
Detoxification Habits
Part IV may be small, but it’s mighty. In Chapter 17, I explain many of the 
important aspects of your diet that you need to keep on the front burner if 
you’re going to be successful with any detox effort. From vitamins to essen-
tial fatty acids and everything in between, Chapter 17 hammers home the 
importance of nutrients and how they fit into an effective detox diet (not to 
mention a generally healthy lifestyle).
Chapter 18 is another one of my favorites. In it you can read all about the 
various options for detoxification that await you outside the grocery store 
and kitchen. Check out this chapter to find out how you can really stretch 
your detox efforts.
Part V: The Part of Tens
If you’re familiar with books For Dummies, you may flip straight to this part, 
which is full of interesting (and fun) lists. If you’re new to the For Dummies 
series, check out “The Part of Tens” for quick-hitting information that can 
pique your interest and help you determine where you may want to go next 
as you dig into the book.

Icons Used in This Book
Throughout the book, you’ll notice three icons in the margins that help you 
navigate the text:
 
When you see this icon, you can be sure that you’re getting an important piece 
of how-to advice about detox dieting or general detoxification.
 
This icon lets you know that you should slow down for a moment and really 
let the information soak in. It’s important stuff!
 
I use this icon to fill you in on potentially toxic pitfalls.
Where to Go from Here
There’s no wrong way to use this book. If you’re just getting started on your 
quest to understand how toxins affect your health, you may want to get cracking 
with Part I (even Chapter 1, if you’re interested in covering all your bases). 
But maybe you already have a good feel for the toxins that are out there, and 
you really just want to know how you can use detoxification and detox dieting 
to improve a specific part of your health. If that’s the case, I recommend 
jumping into Part III.
If you want to begin embracing the practices and techniques of detoxification 
right away, Part II is where you want to be.
Or maybe you want to start with some light fare and ease your way into the 
subject. If so, check out “The Part of Tens” (Part V).
No matter how you want to start or continue your path toward leading a 
healthy, detoxified life, you’re bound to end up with better health as a result. 
And that’s a destination we should all add to our itineraries.

Part I
Getting to the 
Bottom of Natural 
Detoxification

In this part . . .
I
 kick things off with a good hard look at the toxins that 
have become a very real (and very harmful) part of our 
world. There are tens of thousands of toxins in dozens of 
categories, and they exist in the air, in water, and on land. 
You really can’t escape them, but it’s important that you 
understand where they’re lurking so you can at least do 
your best to avoid them whenever possible.
In this part, you can also read about the efforts that your 
magnificent body makes to cleanse itself of toxic sub-
stances. If you’re not already convinced of the wonders of 
the human body, prepare to be amazed!

Chapter 1
Understanding Detoxification 
and Detox Dieting
In This Chapter
▶ Realizing why detoxification is essential
▶ Recognizing toxins
▶ Removing toxins from your body
▶ Taking toxins off your plate
Your amazing body is the most complicated machine on earth. But keeping
that complex machine operating at an extremely high level can be sur-
prisingly simple. You can enjoy maximum health for decades if you follow 
just a few rules, the most important of which are:
 
✓ Keep your body fueled with the right kinds of food.
 
✓ Avoid anything that can cause your body harm.
These rules may be simple, but I didn’t say they were easy.
The world around us is filled with toxins. In fact, our planet is more toxic now 
than it has ever been in human history. To be honest, it can be a real chal-
lenge to get healthful, toxin-free food and to dodge all the toxins that exist 
in our environment, just waiting to creep and seep into your body to do you 
harm. That’s the bad news: So many toxins exist at such high levels that you 
simply cannot escape their reach.
The good news is that you can fight back against the situation. You can 
make adjustments to your lifestyle — starting with your diet but reaching far 
beyond — to limit the amount of toxins you’re exposed to. And you can make 
a concerted effort to detoxify the harmful substances that already exist in 
your body.
Throughout this book I discuss ways that you can give your body the health-
ful, wholesome fuel it needs, while at the same time avoiding toxic materials 
and working to remove the toxins that have already built up in your body’s 

10
Part I: Getting to the Bottom of Natural Detoxification 
systems. If you can stick to the plans that I lay out for you in the pages that 
follow, you’ll enjoy a level of health that many people may hardly believe is 
possible.
Figuring Out Why Everyone Should Detox
Anyone living in the developed world, and particularly in the United States, 
is exposed to chemicals and other toxic substances on a daily basis. These 
toxins are more varied and exist in much higher quantities than ever before. 
It’s scary to think about, but we really don’t know what the long-term health 
effects of all these toxins could be for the human race as a whole. What we 
can see are the health effects of the toxicity that people suffer from now, and 
the picture certainly isn’t pretty. Small doses of toxins usually don’t have an 
immediate effect, but the long-term accumulation can eventually cause entire 
organ systems to fail with no obvious cause. Thousands of people currently 
face chronic diseases that weren’t even on the books a century ago, and the 
average child born today comes into the world with more than 200 different 
toxins already present in her body.
I’d like to believe that people across the globe will stop adding more and 
more toxins into our surroundings, but we all know that’s wishful thinking. 
Things are likely going to get quite a bit more toxic before they start getting 
cleaned up, so it’s best to start planning now for a toxin-filled future.
I don’t want you to panic about the toxins that surround you, but you should 
at least realize what you’re up against. You must also realize that you can 
take steps to avoid toxins and detoxify your body to counter the toxic trend. 
And always remember that you’re not alone — we’re all fighting against the 
health threats posed by toxins, and the important work of detoxification 
should be embraced by everyone (or at least everyone interested in living a 
long, healthy, enjoyable life!).
Defining detoxification
So what is detoxification, anyway? It’s any process that removes a substance 
that is injurious to your body or that changes a toxic substance so it’s no 
longer injurious. Dozens of different detoxification methods exist, and I cover 
the most useful and important ones — including diet, which is the most criti-
cal of all — throughout this book. Broadly speaking, though, you can split 
detoxification up into two categories: internal and external.
Internal
Our bodies have an extraordinarily complex array of systems that change, break 
down, attack and destroy, or eliminate threats to our internal environment 

11
 Chapter 1: Understanding Detoxification and Detox Dieting
and health. For thousands of years these systems have helped humans to 
enjoy relatively good basic health, but for most of those years the exposure 
to toxins was very low and rarely caused a problem. That’s not so today.
The primary internal systems for detoxification are the stomach, intestines, 
liver, immune system, kidneys, and lungs. Each one works in a different way 
to keep us as clean as possible, and you can enhance the detox power of 
each system by taking the steps I describe in this book’s chapters.
External
When it comes to external detoxification, your skin is second to none. Your 
skin serves as an important barrier that keeps many toxins from entering your 
body. Your sweat glands, which are extremely important sites for detoxification, 
are also housed in your skin.
Seeing what detoxification can do for you
When you think about toxins, you can consider them poisons. You don’t want 
poisons floating around in your body, do you? Toxins can affect virtually 
every system and part of your body, causing a massive decrease in efficiency 
and function. Toxins also cause disease. Removing toxins — and avoiding 
them in the first place — can have some truly startling positive effects on 
your health, which I detail throughout Part III of this book. Here are just a few 
examples:
 
✓ Increasing energy: Many toxins directly affect the production of energy 
in your body, and when your toxic levels are high you have far less 
energy than you would enjoy if your systems were toxin free (or close 
to it). The more toxins you can remove and keep out, the more energy 
you’ll have.
 
✓ Boosting immune function: Your immune system plays a major part in 
detoxification. The more it has to work toward getting rid of toxins, the 
less work it can do on its normal tasks (such as preventing infections 
and killing cancer cells). Getting rid of toxins makes life easier for your 
immune system, which allows it to do its job effectively.
 
✓ Managing stress: We usually think of stress as an emotional response to an 
unwanted situation. That’s definitely one cause of stress, but toxins can put 
even more stress on your body, which reacts the same to emotional stress 
and toxic stress. Stress harms your body in many different ways, including 
(but not limited to) organ damage and brain problems. Managing toxic and 
emotional stress can be a major contributor to good health.

12
Part I: Getting to the Bottom of Natural Detoxification 
 
✓ Decreasing fat: Everyone needs a little stored energy, and fat is one of the 
ways you fulfill that need. Unfortunately, many of us are storing enough 
energy (in the form of fat) for several people. That’s a medical problem — 
a very serious one. In addition to the strain obesity puts on your cardio-
vascular system, there’s a toxic element of obesity that many people don’t 
understand. Fat-soluble toxins are stored in your fat cells, and these cells 
release toxins into your bloodstream on a regular basis. You have to get 
the toxins out of the fat cells before you can reduce the fat. Then, with 
less fat, the toxins have fewer places to hide.
Taking a Look at Toxins
If you start looking around for toxins, you don’t have to go very far. Start by 
looking under your kitchen sink. See those disinfectants and cleaners? They’re 
almost certainly loaded with chemical toxins. Open your pantry. Do you have 
any processed foods in there? Be honest. If so, check the ingredients lists. If 
you see any words that you can’t pronounce, those are probably toxins. Head 
into the bathroom next. Chances are your hair spray, deodorant, and other 
personal hygiene products contain toxic substances. Don’t even go into your 
garage — you could spend all day in there discovering toxins.
If you don’t feel like walking around the house, just take a deep breath. The 
fumes from your carpet or from a freshly painted wall in the next room will 
add to the toxic list. And toxic influences from outside your house, down the 
street, or across town — influences generated by places like factories and 
power plants — are contained in the air you’re breathing, too.
To be fair, in many of these cases the amount of toxins you’re exposed to at 
one time is usually small. But toxins are very stubborn; they accumulate in 
your body and can add up pretty fast. It’s kind of like putting a bucket under 
a slow leak in a faucet. Even though the leak is very slow, before long the 
bucket is running over.
Knowing what qualifies as a toxin
A toxin is any substance that your body can’t use in a purposeful way or that 
requires energy to be removed. Even substances that your body has to have 
to survive can be toxic if you get too much of them. It’s truly a miracle that we 
can expose our bodies to the vast numbers of toxins in our environment and we 
don’t just drop over and die. But even though your body is resilient, if you push 
it too hard, something is bound to break. If you have a good grasp of what’s out 
there in terms of toxins, you can more easily identify and avoid them.

13
 Chapter 1: Understanding Detoxification and Detox Dieting
Natural chemicals
People often think of toxins as manmade chemicals, but Mother Nature pro-
vides plenty of toxins, too. If you’ve ever brushed up against some poison 
ivy or been bitten by a spider, you know what I mean. The key to limiting the 
amount of damage that natural toxins do to your body is avoidance.
Living toxins
In addition to the natural chemicals that act as toxins, plenty of living things 
can have toxic effects on your health. Bacteria, for example, are all around 
us. Some types of bacteria are helpful, like the kinds that live in your intes-
tines and help to digest your food, but many other types are extremely toxic 
and harmful. Yeasts, parasites, and viruses are other common living toxins.
Manmade chemicals
In the past 100 years, man has been really busy creating new things that are 
supposed to make our lives easier and better. Unfortunately, many of these 
things contain toxic chemicals and/or are made using some sort of toxic 
process. The chemical creations include pesticides, petrochemicals, and 
food additives, to name just a few.
 
In the United States today, more than 80,000 chemicals are being released into 
our environment, and less than 3,000 have been tested for toxic effects on 
humans. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) allows any chemical 
to be released unless scientific proof exists that it causes cancer or is toxic in 
some other way. We have the cart ahead of the horse when it comes to man-
made chemical toxins.
Finding toxins everywhere
By now you’re probably getting the picture that we’re really surrounded by 
toxins and things that can make us toxic. But how do these toxins end up in 
our bodies, where they can do us harm? Here are the common routes:
 
✓ Ingesting toxins orally: It may seem crazy to stick toxins into your mouth, 
but we do so every day. Food is the biggest source of toxins for most 
people.
 
 Processed foods today contain more than 3,000 chemicals that aren’t nat-
ural. These chemicals enhance flavor and can preserve food for months, 
if not years. Many food preservatives can have really harmful effects on 
the body. Some ding up your immune system, and others cause danger-
ous (even deadly) allergic reactions. Throughout this book I tell you about 
the toxins that can lurk in your food if you’re not making smart, detox diet 
decisions about what goes in your pantry and on your plate.

14
Part I: Getting to the Bottom of Natural Detoxification 
 
 And even if toxins aren’t in your food and water, you may have toxins on 
your food. At the top of this list are pesticides and chemical fertilizers 
that are meant to help grow food but end up in our bodies, assaulting 
our organs and tissues.
 
✓ Inhaling toxins: When it comes to airborne toxins, remember this: Anything 
you smell is getting into your body. If something has a nasty chemical 
smell, parts of that chemical are entering your body through your mucous 
membranes and lungs. Even scarier is the fact that many chemicals have no 
smell, so you don’t know that you’re breathing them in.
 
 As I note in the previous section, about 80,000 chemicals are released 
into your environment, many of them in gaseous form. Obviously, the 
potential for inhaling toxic substances is extremely high. That gentle 
summer breeze may contain heavy metals, bacteria, mold, viruses, and 
countless chemicals.
 
✓ Taking toxins in through your skin: Your skin does a very good job at 
keeping out toxins, but it isn’t perfect. Your skin is capable of absorbing 
chemicals that come in contact with it, and toxins are no exception.
Getting Rid of Toxins
What’s the best way to get rid of toxins? Avoid them in the first place. An 
ounce of toxin prevention is worth far more than a pound of detoxification 
cure. But you can do only so much when it comes to dodging toxins. You could 
live in a bubble in the most pristine part of the world, and you’d still end up 
toxic. Lucky for you, you have a whole host of systems and natural mecha-
nisms that will help you eliminate the toxic substances that course through 
your veins (and your arteries, and your tissues, and your organs . . . ).
Watching your body fight toxins
Your body gets rid of toxins in a couple of key ways that I introduce in this 
section. The first is the elimination of toxins; you have systems in place that 
simply flush the bad stuff out. The second is chemical detoxification, which 
occurs when various parts of your body — the liver is a top example — break 
down toxins into simpler, less harmful materials that are usually shuttled out 
of the body in your waste products.

15
 Chapter 1: Understanding Detoxification and Detox Dieting
Toxin elimination
 
When you talk about the natural elimination of toxins from your body, your 
kidneys deserve center stage. Sure, some organs have a higher profile — 
your brain and heart come to mind — but when it comes to sorting out toxins 
and putting them on the first fast train out (usually into the toilet), nothing 
beats the kidneys. They’re especially adept at clearing out water-soluble toxins.
Many fat-soluble toxins that can’t be whisked away by your kidneys or 
broken down by your liver (more on that organ in a moment) get seques-
tered in your fat cells, where they become a constant source of toxicity. How 
do you get rid of those toxins? You sweat the small stuff. And the big stuff. 
And everything in between. Sweating is a remarkable detoxification tech-
nique; several different kinds of toxins can be removed from your body only 
through sweating. (I come back to that topic later in the chapter.)
Chemical detoxification
Chemical detoxification takes place when one of your body’s parts breaks 
down the chemical structure of a toxin so it’s no longer harmful. The pro-
cess starts in your nose and mouth, where immune cells begin busting up 
toxic substances. The tonsils do a lot of work on toxins before they continue 
toward your stomach, where some of the most potent acid in the natural 
world goes to work on a breadth of toxins.
That brings me to the liver. Your liver is a fantastic chemical processing 
plant, and it can break down toxins that range from ammonia to alcohol. You 
don’t have to read very many pages in this book before coming to a spot 
where I sing the praises of the liver.
Taking an active role in detoxification
Your body can take care of quite a bit of detoxification on its own, but 
today’s elevated toxin levels demand that you give your body a hand. If you 
want to enjoy long-term good health, you must work hard to enhance and 
augment your body’s detox efforts by taking these steps:
 
✓ Choose your food wisely: You can drastically cut down on your toxicity
by making good food choices. If you can eliminate processed foods 
from your diet, dodge most genetically modified foods, and embrace all 
things organic, you’ll be doing your health an enormous favor. This is 
important stuff, and I devote many pages of this book (including all of

✓ Fill in the gaps with supplements: The quality of our food has dropped 
dramatically in the last few decades. As if that weren’t enough, your body 
needs even more essential nutrients than ever before if you expect it to 
fight off the ever-increasing amount of toxic threats that surround us 
all. Because of these factors, the vast majority of people — particularly 
people living in the United States — need to take supplements to ensure 
the best possible intake of vitamins, minerals, essential fatty acids, and 
other key nutrients. I discuss supplements throughout this book, par-
ticularly in Chapter 17.
 
✓ Cleanse through chelation: Heavy metals are some of the most common 
toxins, and they’re everywhere. Lead may have been banned from paint 
and gasoline several years ago, but the lead that used to be added to 
those products is still around. Mercury is extremely prevalent as well 
and can be found in everything from dental fillings to fish to fluorescent 
light bulbs.
 
 If you think you may be suffering from dangerously high levels of heavy 
metals, chelation could be a good choice for you. Chelation is a medi-
cal treatment that uses a medication to trap and remove heavy metals 
from your body’s tissues. Several variations on chelation exist, which I 
describe in Chapter 18.
 
✓ Use a sauna: Sweating is an outstanding way to use your body’s natural 
systems to flush out toxins, particularly the fat-soluble ones that con-
tribute to obesity and continually poison us. You should be sweating 
every chance you get! Exercise is a great way to work up a sweat, but 
if you really want to sweat it out, nothing beats a sauna. I explain your 
sauna options and how to use them in Chapter 18.
Dieting the Detoxification Way
If you’re not enjoying optimal health, or if you’re struggling with obesity, you 
need to take a good, hard look at the many benefits of a detox diet. Changing 
what you eat (and how you eat it) so that you’re focusing on wholesome, 
healthy foods and cutting out toxic ingredients is the first and most impor-
tant step toward ensuring good health and maintaining a healthy weight. 
The principles for detox dieting are relatively simple, but the changes they 
require can be pretty tough. (They’re not as tough, however, as living an 
unhealthy and obese life.)
Losing those extra, harmful pounds
Not many people make the connection between toxins and obesity, but clear, 
proven relationships exist that you need to understand if you want to stay 
at a healthy weight. Getting on (and sticking with) a detox diet will go a long 

17
 Chapter 1: Understanding Detoxification and Detox Dieting
way toward minimizing your toxicity. And if you can make detox dieting a 
part of your life for life, you’ll lose the extra, harmful pounds that weigh you 
down and damage your health.
Body fat is toxic!
You don’t run into many people who are fond of fat, and for good reason. In 
addition to being unattractive in the eyes of many people, fat is also a store-
house for toxins in your body. Fat-soluble toxins are tucked away in fat cells 
to prevent them from harming your organs and other vital tissues, and when 
the toxins are more concentrated, the fat cells get bigger in an effort to keep 
them diluted. If you can avoid toxins and detoxify the toxins you’re already 
carrying around with you, shedding fat becomes much easier.
Body fat stresses your body’s systems
For every pound of fat your body makes, it has to make about 4 miles of 
blood vessels. Carrying 25 extra pounds of fat means your heart has to pump 
blood through another 100 miles of vessels. As you can imagine, that’s not 
good news for the most important muscle in your body, and it’s just the 
beginning. Fat wreaks havoc on your joints, contributes to diabetes, and 
causes too many other conditions to list here. Lose the toxins, lose the 
unhealthy foods from your diet, and you’ll lose the fat. And then your health 
will flourish. See Chapter 9 for all the details on making detox dieting part of 
your daily life.
Tackling unhealthy habits
Choosing the right toxin-free foods and ensuring that your eating habits are 
as healthy as possible will do more than just help you to eliminate excess fat. 
Giving your body the healthy fuel that it needs can also be a critical factor in 
helping to kick unhealthy habits like drinking and smoking. What’s more, if you 
really embrace detox dieting, you can greatly enhance the recovery and healing 
process that takes place after you’ve put down the bottle and snuffed out your 
last cigarette. Pair those dietary choices with some more detoxification efforts — 
saunas, for instance — and you can go from an unhealthy smoker or drinker to 
a healthy, detoxified person in a fraction of the time.
If you’re a smoker (or former smoker), be sure the check out Chapter 14. For 
information about using detox methods to fight alcohol abuse, see Chapter 15.

Chapter 2
Tackling the Different Types of 
Toxins and Their Effects on You
In This Chapter
▶ Discovering the toxic effects of heavy metals
▶ Studying bacteria, viruses, yeasts, and parasites
▶ Turning a critical eye on medications
▶ Getting a feel for how toxins can affect you
W
hat’s the first step for waging a war against toxins and their harmful 
effects on your body? Know thy enemy. You can’t make a concerted 
effort to cleanse your body of toxins or avoid contact with them in the first 
place if you don’t understand what they are, where they come from, and what 
they can do to your body. That’s what this chapter is all about.
The current presence of toxins is overwhelming. Toxic sources are ubiq-
uitous in our everyday lives, and the effects on your body’s complex sys-
tems can be devastating. Some of the sources will surprise you; I bet you’re 
familiar with the dangers of lead paint, but how about the presence of 
arsenic in the treated lumber you used to build your deck, or the antimony 
in your baby’s bedding? I devote a good portion of this chapter to identify-
ing common toxins that we’re exposed to every day, so you can understand 
what’s out there and how it could be entering your body.
Humans have some built-in mechanisms that help to rid our bodies of foreign 
materials that occur commonly in nature. But because dangerous manmade 
chemicals have become more abundant only in the last 100 years or so, we’re 
not equipped to deal with their threats to our health. These toxins put a 
serious strain on our natural detoxification mechanisms and can eventually 
exhaust and overwhelm them. Toxins can damage many of our other sys-
tems, as well.

20
Part I: Getting to the Bottom of Natural Detoxification 
Exploring the Various Types of Toxins
The range of toxic materials that surrounds you every day of your life is 
dizzying. For the purposes of this book, a toxin is any substance that has 
harmful effects on human biochemistry or tissue. Keep in mind that some 
chemicals that are usually helpful to us actually become toxic if we get too 
much of them; vitamin D is an example.
Because the term toxin can be used to describe so many different substances, 
it can sometimes be difficult to focus on the specific toxins that you should 
be aware of while working toward detoxifying your body. In this section, I fill 
you in on many of the most dangerous toxic materials that you’re likely to 
face on a regular basis — toxins that are very common and also very harmful.
When most people start thinking about toxins, their minds jump immediately 
to nasty chemicals. They think about smokestacks spewing poisonous gases 
into the atmosphere and rusty pipes pouring sludge into a nearby stream. But 
that isn’t the whole picture. Don’t get me wrong: Plenty of industrial byproducts 
and other manmade toxins pose a threat to the wellbeing of millions. But when 
you’re considering the range of toxins, you should also keep in mind things like 
bacteria and viruses, or even medical materials like chemotherapy drugs.
I cover most of the major types of toxins in this section, so read on to dis-
cover the toxins that can creep in silently around you and jeopardize your 
good health. I also offer some brief insight on what each of these toxins can 
do to your body, and if you find yourself wanting to know more about toxic 
effects you can skip ahead to the next section of this chapter.
As you read, you’ll probably want to know what you can do to limit your 
exposure to toxins. Feel free to flip ahead to Chapter 3, which features infor-
mation on how to dodge toxins. And if you’re eager to know whether or not 
you have dangerously high levels of these toxins in your body, check out the 
details on getting tested for toxins (by a doctor) in Chapter 5.
Feeling the weight of heavy metals
Heavy metal doesn’t just refer to music with blaring electric guitars and thun-
derous drum solos. The heavy metals I describe over the course of the next 
few pages can be found virtually anywhere, and they have an extremely toxic 
effect on the human body.
Heavy metals feature a chemical structure that causes them to harm the 
human body’s normal (and complex) chemical processes. These metals 
occur naturally in the earth, but they’re usually present in very low levels 
and rarely cause problems for people in those forms. The real trouble begins 

21
 Chapter 2: Tackling the Different Types of Toxins and Their Effects on You
when heavy metals are used commercially and end up in concentrated 
amounts in the goods that we purchase, bring into our homes, and incorpo-
rate in our everyday lives.
Read on to get a feel for the most widespread and dangerous heavy metals.
Mercury
With the exception of plutonium (which is radioactive), mercury is the most 
toxic substance on earth for humans. Just one one-thousandth of a gram is 
toxic, and hundreds of tons of mercury are released into our environment 
every year in the United States alone. Mercury is a known toxin for nerves 
and contributes to a wide range of ailments from autism to Alzheimer’s to 
decreased fertility. Estimates from clinical evaluations show that one in eight 
women have dangerously high mercury levels. Mercury is transferred from 
mother to fetus during pregnancy, which may help explain why one in six 
children today has neuropsychological problems. Not only is mercury highly 
toxic, but it’s also very tough to eliminate from the body. Natural removal is 
so slow that after one exposure it takes 15 to 30 years for half the mercury to 
be eliminated.
You can be exposed to mercury through several different sources, and the 
following are among the most common:
 
✓ Dental fillings: The “silver” or amalgam fillings that dentists use to fill 
cavities are 50 percent mercury. That mercury gradually seeps out of 
the fillings and into your body. The American Dental Association insists 
that the mercury is bound to other metals and doesn’t typically enter 
the body, but multiple studies have shown otherwise. In fact, many 
European countries have banned the use of amalgam fillings in children 
and women of childbearing age. If that doesn’t turn you off to the use 
of these types of fillings, consider that when dentists receive the mate-
rial used to make the fillings it comes in packaging made for hazardous 
materials, and when the fillings are removed dentists must dispose of 
the remnants using toxic waste procedures! In my opinion, you should 
completely avoid amalgam fillings, and if you already have them you 
should consider having them removed. If that’s the case, be sure to find 
a biomedical dentist who knows how to take out the fillings safely, using 
a rubber dam and a high speed vacuum.
 
✓ Coal: The coal that’s mined and burned to generate electricity contains 
mercury. Coal-burning power plants release thousands of pounds of 
mercury into the atmosphere each year. Many of the world’s quickly 
developing countries, including China, are building coal-burning plants 
at an incredible rate, so the amount of mercury released into our air is 
getting higher all the time. The technology to remove the mercury from 
power plant byproducts exists, but it’s an added expense that would cut 
into power company profits.

22
Part I: Getting to the Bottom of Natural Detoxification 
 
✓ High fructose corn syrup (HFCS): High fructose corn syrup is one of the 
most common sugar substitutes used today, and one of the first steps 
in making HFCS involves soaking corn in a solution that contains mercury. 
That mercury can end up in the foods you eat that contain HFCS. A 
recent study by the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy showed 
that when HFCS was the first or second ingredient listed, half the 
processed food samples they tested contained mercury.
 
✓ Fish: Mercury from a huge range of sources eventually ends up in bodies 
of water across the globe, and as a result it also ends up in fish. The 
problem has swelled dramatically in the past decade, leading the U.S. 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA) to release multiple warnings about the dangers of eating 
fish and shellfish, especially for children and pregnant women. The FDA 
issued a public warning in 2001 with an update in 2004 that stated that if 
a pregnant woman eats a single 3-ounce portion of swordfish, shark, tile 
fish, king mackerel, or tuna, she will ingest enough mercury to damage 
the brain of her fetus.
 
 Educate yourself about the mercury-related risks associated with eating 
fish and shellfish by visiting www.epa.gov/waterscience/fish/
publicinfo.html.
 
✓ Fluorescent lightbulbs: Many homes and businesses have been switching 
to fluorescent lightbulbs to help cut down on energy use, but that news 
isn’t all good. Fluorescent bulbs contain mercury, and if a bulb breaks 
you should treat the situation with extreme caution.
 
 You can and should read the EPA’s suggestions for cleaning up a broken 
fluorescent lightbulb at this Web site: www.epa.gov/hg/spills/.
Mercury can also be found in flu vaccines; flip ahead a few pages in this 
chapter to read all about those potential threats.
Lead
The toxicity of lead has been recognized for many years, but the widespread 
use of the metal throughout history means that we’ll be forced to deal with 
lead and its health consequences for the foreseeable future. Federal legisla-
tion was enacted in the 1970s to remove lead from paint and fuel, and many 
people assume that lead levels have dwindled as a result. That’s simply not 
the case because lead doesn’t go away — it’s a very persistent material.
Lead poisoning causes many health problems, including damage to neuro-
logical systems. The developing brains and nervous systems of children can 
be severely harmed if their lead levels are too high.

23
 Chapter 2: Tackling the Different Types of Toxins and Their Effects on You
 
Most children today are tested for lead poisoning, but the vast majority of 
those tests are based on blood samples. Blood tests reveal elevated lead 
levels in the blood. Here’s the problem: Lead is absorbed by brain and other 
tissues, and blood tests aren’t as good at registering high lead levels in the 
brain. Plus, blood tests reveal only very recent exposure. Luckily, other tests 
can more accurately detect overall lead levels; to read all about them, flip 
ahead to Chapter 5.
What are the major sources of lead toxicity today? Lead can be found in all 
sorts of places, including the following:
 
✓ Lead paint: Most of the paint used on homes prior to 1960 contained 
dangerously high levels of lead, and lead was still present in paints used 
on homes up to the late 1970s. Some estimates indicate that 10 million 
pounds of lead are still on painted surfaces in the United States. As 
many as 6 million homes, which house about 2 million children, have 
surfaces covered in paint that includes lead.
 
 When you think of lead paint, you may think only about painted interior 
and exterior walls of old houses. Unfortunately, that’s just the tip of the 
iceberg. Lead paint can be used on all kinds of surfaces, and believe it 
or not lead is still used in some paints today. Although it seems unthink-
able, some toy manufacturers still use lead paint on toys, even though 
it’s illegal. To get a feel for the scope of this problem, run a search for 
“toy hazard recalls” on the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission’s 
Web site (www.cpsc.gov).
 
✓ Water supplies: Some older homes have plumbing that includes lead 
or lead soldering. That lead can leach into your drinking water, and the 
problem is more common than you may think. Some researchers indi-
cate that as many as 16 percent of household water supplies have dan-
gerous concentrations of lead.
 
✓ Other sources: Millions of tons of lead are produced every year for 
industrial and commercial uses, and the toxin ends up in many items. 
For example, the glazing used on some types of pottery contains lead, 
and the supplies used in creating stained glass can be lead-rich, as well. 
And you know that antique lead crystal decanter that your grandmother 
passed down to you? It’s called lead crystal for a reason. Many candles 
also have lead core wicks.

tion page at www.epa.gov/lead.

Aluminum
Aluminum is a toxic metal that serves absolutely no useful purpose in the 
human body. It’s also the most abundant metal in the earth’s crust. We all 
have some aluminum in our systems, but because it’s a toxin and can have 
some nasty effects on the body, you need to know where aluminum is com-
monly found. The following is a list of a few everyday items that are made of 
or can contain aluminum:
 
✓ Aluminum foil
 
✓ Antacids
 
✓ Antiperspirants
 
✓ Baking powder
 
✓ Bleached flour
 
✓ Cookware
 
✓ Municipal water supplies
 
✓ Toothpaste
The toxic effects of aluminum are well understood and are being studied 
more all the time. Aluminum has toxic effects on the brain. It would be next 
to impossible for you to completely curtail your intake of aluminum, but it 
certainly wouldn’t hurt you to limit your use of products that contain high 
amounts of the metal.
Some of the ailments that have been linked to higher-than-usual levels of 
aluminum include neurologic conditions similar to Alzheimer’s, colic, rickets, 
intestinal problems, extreme nervousness, anemia, headaches, memory loss, 
speech problems, and aching muscles.
Arsenic
Arsenic is an element that occurs naturally in soil, and the concentrations of 
arsenic existing in the environment vary from location to location. As with some 
of the other toxins described in this section, small amounts of naturally occur-
ring arsenic are somewhat normal and don’t represent a serious health risk.
However, increased exposure to arsenic can have devastating effects on your 
body. Arsenic can cause intestinal problems, anemia, skin lesions, liver or 
kidney damage, and even death. The EPA has stated that arsenic can cause 
several types of cancer in humans. And a study published in the Journal of 
the American Medical Association (a prestigious, widely respected medical 
journal) found an association between increased arsenic levels and type 2 
diabetes in adults.

25
 Chapter 2: Tackling the Different Types of Toxins and Their Effects on You
Clearly it’s in your best interest to limit your exposure to arsenic whenever 
you can, but how can you do that? The first step is to be mindful of where 
arsenic is present in your surroundings.
Arsenic compounds are used as wood preservatives, so many “pressure-
treated” varieties of wood contain arsenic. These types of wood aren’t used 
for residential purposes as much now as they were in the past, but you can 
still easily find lumber that has been treated with arsenic compounds. Decks 
and outdoor children’s play sets are a couple of prime sources.
Arsenic is also used in paints, dyes, metals, drugs, soaps, and semiconduc-
tors. It’s added to some fertilizers and animal feeding operations, which can 
increase the amount of arsenic in food.
Antimony
Antimony is a heavy metal that is used as a fire retardant in many fabrics. 
It’s also a potent toxin that can get into your bloodstream and then into your 
body’s tissues within two hours of exposure. Antimony accumulates in 
organs and even bone, and it can disrupt the way that your organs function, 
Arsenic and poultry farming
In recent years, the use of arsenic in poultry 
farming has become an increasing concern. 
The debate centers on an arsenic-based sub-
stance called roxarsone, which is added to 
chicken feed to help cut down on parasites 
that live in chicken intestines. Several potential 
health issues can arise from that practice, the 
first of which being (of course) the presence of 
arsenic in chicken meat. A few years ago, the 
Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy (IATP) 
tested 155 samples from uncooked supermarket 
chicken products and found detectable arsenic 
in more than half of the samples. The IATP also 
tested 90 fast food chicken products and found 
that all 90 contained detectable arsenic. The 
IATP cautions that its testing is by no means 
definitive, but the findings are troubling at best.
As a result of some of the public outcry over the 
use of roxarsone, several poultry producers have 
stopped using it. If you’re concerned about 
the issue, do some online research to find out 
which producers no longer use roxarsone. And 
you can always buy USDA certified 100 percent 
organic chicken; organic standards prohibit the 
use of arsenic-based substances.
Even more troubling could be what happens 
when the arsenic from roxarsone doesn’t get 
absorbed by chickens. In that case the arsenic 
passes out of the chicken in its feces, which is 
often used as an agricultural fertilizer. When 
the fertilizer is applied to fields, the arsenic can 
be washed away and find its way into ground-
water, which is a common source of drinking 
water for many communities.

26
Part I: Getting to the Bottom of Natural Detoxification 
causing anorexia, fatigue, muscle pain, low blood pressure, fragile red blood 
cells, mental changes, and heart pain.
Where can antimony be found? You can find it in a variety of fire-retardant 
textiles: clothes, bedding, and carpet to name a few. It’s also present in solders, 
small arms ammunition, lead batteries, paints, enamels, glass, and pottery 
glazes.
The EPA doesn’t closely monitor environmental levels of antimony, so data 
on its prevalence is tough to come by.
Tin
Tin is another common heavy metal, and it often combines with other materi-
als to form compounds. Some of these compounds are easily absorbed into 
the human body when tin is ingested (in food or water), and — fortunately — 
some of the other tin compounds are less likely to enter your system.
People inadvertently ingest tin in a number of different ways. You can take in 
tin if you eat or drink something that comes in a tin can that has a damaged 
liner, for example. Tin is also present in solder, in toothpastes that contain 
stannous fluoride (check for it in the ingredients list on your toothpaste 
package), and in other health and beauty products like soap and perfume.
You can also find tin compounds in things like rodent poison, fungicides, 
wood preservatives, herbicides, and sprays used to control mites and ticks.
Tin toxicity is very hard on the body, causing symptoms like brain swelling, 
headaches, visual defects, low blood sugar, and decreased immune function.
 
In addition to the metals I describe in this section, several others are less 
commonly encountered but can still cause serious problems. These metals 
include barium, bismuth, cadmium, platinum, thallium, tungsten, and uranium. 
If you’re getting tested for toxicity — read more about that in Chapter 5 — you 
may want to include tests for these metals just in case.
Living toxins: Getting toxic from the inside
As I mention at the start of this section, a toxin is any substance that has a 
harmful effect on human biochemistry or tissue. A common misconception is 
that only chemicals are toxins. There’s much more to the story than that.
 
Toxins can be living things, and it’s important that you consider — and act to 
prevent — the toxic effects of bacteria, viruses, yeast, and parasites.

27
 Chapter 2: Tackling the Different Types of Toxins and Their Effects on You
Certain types of these four categories of living things can be a constant chal-
lenge to your body and can negatively affect your health just as much as 
some of the dangerous heavy metals.
Most of these living toxins enter your body through your mouth, nose, lungs, 
and stomach. Your immune system puts up a good fight, but it can be over-
whelmed — especially if it has been weakened by other toxins along the 
way — and may not be able to tackle the challenges that some bacteria, 
viruses, yeast, and parasites present.
Bacteria
Bacteria are microscopic, single-celled organisms that live on our skin and 
inside our intestines. If they’re located anywhere else it’s called an infection, 
and the results are toxic. We’re covered inside and out with good bacteria that 
live with us, cleaning up our skin and intestinal tract. But if you get the wrong 
kind of bacteria in your intestines, the toxic effects can include the following:
 
✓ Abdominal cramping
 
✓ Body infection
 
✓ Constipation
 
✓ Diarrhea
 
✓ Foul-smelling stools
 
✓ Spastic colon
You can also experience neurological symptoms like fatigue, changes in 
mood, agitation, and decreased attention.
Viruses
Viruses are very basic living things that can reproduce and interact with 
your body’s cells. The types of viruses range from the virus that causes the 
common cold to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Viruses usually 
reproduce very rapidly, but your immune system (if it’s healthy) can kill 
most of them off.
The best way to defend your body against viruses and the toxic problems 
they cause is to maintain a robust immune system. Check out Chapter 10 for 
lots of useful information on how you can detoxify your body to help your 
immune system flourish.
Yeast
Yeasts are single-celled fungi, and they’re ever-present in our environment. 
There are plenty of good yeasts (as anyone enjoying a cold beer or a slice of 

28
Part I: Getting to the Bottom of Natural Detoxification 
bread can tell you), but some yeasts can act as toxins when present in your 
body in unusually high numbers. The yeast cells themselves aren’t necessar-
ily toxic, but some of the substances produced by yeasts can cause a range of 
ailments. The more yeast cells living in your body, the more toxic substances 
are generated. Those toxins can cause the following ailments, among others:
 
✓ Gastrointestinal problems: Constipation, diarrhea, indigestion, cramping, 
excessive gas, heartburn, spastic colon, irritable bowel syndrome, colitis, 
and chronic gum inflammation
 
✓ Neurological problems: Fatigue, depression, psychosis, mood swings, 
insomnia, drunken feeling, hyperactivity, agitation, and decreased atten-
tion span
 
✓ Respiratory problems: Asthma, allergies, recurrent infections (sinusitis, 
tonsillitis, bronchitis), colds, and sore throat
 
If your diet includes a lot of sugar, you’re probably nourishing the yeast cells 
you’re hosting and making it easier for them to live and reproduce. That’s not 
a good thing, and it’s one of many reasons to rein in the amount of sugar you 
eat on a daily basis.
Yeast-related problems commonly crop up after people take antibiotics. The 
powerful antibiotics used now are great at wiping out the bacteria that cause 
sickness, but there’s a downside: The harmless and good types of bacteria 
(the types that live in your intestines and aid digestion) get wiped out, too, 
and in their absence yeasts can grow and reproduce at rapid rates. That’s a 
big part of the reason that women often suffer vaginal yeast infections after 
taking rounds of antibiotics.
Parasites
Parasites are tiny creatures that live on or inside our bodies — freeloaders that 
feast on the nutrients we bring in and contribute absolutely nothing to our 
health or well-being. They range from worms (tapeworms and hookworms, not 
the worms that you used as fishing bait when you were little) to the critters 
that cause malaria. Many parasites set up shop in the intestines because that’s 
one of the best places to find a wide variety of available nutrients.
For centuries it was common for people to get a bowel cleanse or some other 
form of parasite removal once a year. (Perhaps you remember hearing your 
grandparents or great-grandparents talk about getting “wormed” — that’s the 
same thing.) Parasite cleanses, or techniques that help to rid the body of para-
site invaders, are far less common now than they used to be, and in most cases 
that’s not necessarily a good thing. For details on how you can use some of 
these methods to keep parasites out of your system, flip to Chapter 10.

 Chapter 2: Tackling the Different Types of Toxins and Their Effects on You
Swallowing the bitter pill: 
Toxins in medicines
Many of the toxins I explain in this chapter come from sources that aren’t 
surprising. It’s not really hard to believe that a massive coal-burning power 
plant, for instance, may be spewing some toxic materials out into the envi-
ronment. But some toxins come from sources that most people think of as 
benign or even beneficial. One of the most surprising areas where toxins are 
becoming increasingly common is traditional medicine. Some of the treat-
ments and drugs used to cure illnesses can actually cause quite a few others. 
The culprits range from vaccines to radiation, and I discuss several of them 
over the course of the next few pages.
Vaccines
Vaccines have been in the news a lot lately, and they likely will continue to 
be for quite some time. I want to start this explanation by stating that I don’t 
tell my patients to refrain from getting vaccines. Vaccinations can be a good 
thing, and it would be hard to refute the fact that some vaccines have helped 
to save many lives in the last 60 years. When my patients ask me about vac-
cines, I tell them that the best thing they can do is to get informed about the 
vaccinations they’re considering and make a decision that takes into consid-
eration all the related risks and benefits.
That said, here are a few of the vaccines that have been under fire recently:
 
✓ Influenza vaccines: Commonly called flu shots, a number of vaccinations 
for the influenza virus are on the market today. Some of these vaccines 
include a chemical called thimerosal, which contains mercury. (Flip back 
a few pages in this chapter to read all about mercury.) Thimerosal is 
used as a preservative in these influenza vaccines, and it’s about half 
mercury, by weight.
 
 The toxicity of the mercury in thimerisol is currently being debated, but 
no matter which side of the debate you fall on, here’s some good news: 
Some influenza vaccines do not contain thimerisol, so you have options 
if you want to get a flu shot but don’t want to also get a dose of mercury. 
The bad news is that mercury-free shots can be difficult to locate, and 
some doctors don’t know which type they have. In some states, the 
mercury-free versions are reserved for Medicaid patients.
 
 The FDA has a lot of thimerosal information on its Web site, including 
a list that shows you some of the vaccines that do not contain the sub-
stance. Check out www.fda.gov/cber/vaccine/thimerosal.htm.

30
Part I: Getting to the Bottom of Natural Detoxification 
 
✓ Diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (DTP) vaccines: Many forms of the 
DTP vaccine, which is commonly given to infants, contain both aluminum 
and formaldehyde. Some people argue that the amounts of these toxins 
in the vaccine are minimal and don’t cause any problems; others contend 
that the substances are dangerous no matter how small the amount.
 
✓ Polio vaccines: Many of the polio vaccines made today are processed 
through the cells of Green Monkey kidneys. In previous decades, 
monkey viruses have contaminated polio vaccine doses, and those 
doses were given to the general public before the virus was discovered. 
Many researchers claim that the problem is behind us, but some scien-
tists believe we still need to be concerned.
 
✓ Hepatitis B vaccines: Most of the controversy surrounding vaccines for 
hepatitis B centers on the use of the vaccine in children. U.S. government 
data has shown that children under the age of 14 are as much as three 
times more likely to suffer adverse effects from the hepatitis B vaccine as 
they are to catch the disease in the absence of a vaccination.
Some of the questions that have been raised about the safety of vaccines can 
make some people roll their eyes, but the fact is that many of the questions 
are justified and require quite a bit more research. To get a feel for how seri-
ous some of these questions may be, consider the following quote, which 
is taken from a statement that Dr. Jane Orient, the executive director of the 
Association of American Physicians and Surgeons at the time, presented to a 
Congressional subcommittee in 1999:
Public policy regarding vaccines is fundamentally flawed. It is permeated 
by conflicts of interest. It is based on poor scientific methodology (including 
studies that are too small, too short, and too limited in populations rep-
resented), which is, moreover, insulated from independent criticism. The 
evidence is far too poor to warrant overriding the independent judgments 
of patients, parents, and attending physicians, even if this were ethically or 
legally acceptable.
 
If you’re thinking about getting vaccines for you or your family, make sure you 
have a candid conversation with a doctor who will listen to your concerns 
about the risks associated with the vaccinations you’re considering.
Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy (also called chemo) is a treatment for cancer that uses a com-
bination of drugs to kill or slow the growth of cancerous cells. It can be a very 
useful way to fight some cancers, but the drugs used are effectively toxins. 
The side effects of chemo can be extremely uncomfortable or painful and can 
include hair loss, abdominal pain, weakening of the bones, and even cancer.

31
 Chapter 2: Tackling the Different Types of Toxins and Their Effects on You
Even at its best, chemo is very hard on the body, but it can be made less of 
a burden if a patient’s diet and nutrition are healthy before and during the 
treatment. Patients who have taken care to eat a healthy diet — the kind of 
diet I trumpet throughout this book, particularly in Chapter 7 — generally 
experience less severe chemotherapy side effects than those who have poor 
eating habits.
 
If you’re facing a fight against cancer and you have to decide whether or not to 
proceed with chemotherapy, make sure you have an extensive conversation 
with your doctor about the effectiveness of chemo treatment on the specific 
type of cancer in question. Some types of cancer can be treated extremely 
effectively with chemo, but other types don’t respond nearly as well. For 
example, if a certain kind of cancer has a five-year survival rate with chemo 
treatment and a four-year survival rate without chemo, you may want to con-
sider other ways to treat the cancer. On the other hand, chemotherapy can 
provide a 90 percent cure rate for some types of cancer.
Radiation
Like chemotherapy, the use of radiation in modern medicine is focused on 
treating cancer patients. And as with chemo, radiation can be a very neces-
sary evil if you have a cancer fight on your hands.
Radiation treatment involves pointing an ionizing radiation beam at a mass of 
cancer cells in order to kill the targeted tissue (usually a cancerous tumor). 
The beam is moved around a focal point in the tumor so that the surrounding 
tissue receives only a small amount of radiation while the target area is hit 
hard with the radiation.
Radiation therapy has made terrific strides in recent years, but the process 
still has a toxic effect on the healthy tissues that surround the cancerous 
cells. As you’d guess, the healthier the tissue, the less likely it will be dam-
aged by the radiation. And what’s the best way to build healthy tissues in 
your body? That’s right — stay away from toxins and eat a healthy diet that 
focuses on the right (toxin-free) foods.
 
If you’re going to have radiation therapy, do some research on hyperbaric 
oxygen therapy, which can reduce the damage to your body from radiation.
Exploring the Effects of Toxins
In the previous sections of this chapter, I offer some basic information on 
how various toxins can harm your body and its many complex systems. It’s 
always good to be familiar with the havoc that a particular toxin can wreak 

32
Part I: Getting to the Bottom of Natural Detoxification 
on you, but I think it’s also very useful for you to understand some of the 
more general problems that toxins can cause. The toxic problem in our world 
is a big one, and you can get a feel for the scope of the issue if you take a step 
back and view it through a wide-angle lens. That’s the point of this section: to 
clue you in on the broad range of awful effects that toxins can have.
Some toxins affect the body by modifying its natural chemical balance, caus-
ing certain systems to break down. Others are less sneaky and can flat-out 
kill some body tissues. Still other toxins actually alter our genetic material, 
causing devastating problems like birth defects. I explore all these possible 
effects in this section.
Cellular damage
The most basic type of harm that toxins can cause you is cellular damage. 
(No, I’m not talking about what happens when you accidentally drop your 
cell phone on the sidewalk. This is much more serious stuff.) We are all made 
of cells, and toxins have a very nasty habit of changing the proteins and 
other materials in our cells, to the point where a cell’s basic functions can be 
altered or stopped completely.
Some people hear about the basics of cellular damage and think, What’s the 
big deal? Cells are so small, and I’ve got trillions of ’em! If a little bit of mercury 
kills off a few cells, I’ll be fine.
The problem is that when toxins have a negative effect at the cellular level, the 
scope of the harm done can snowball very quickly. If many cells are damaged, 
it doesn’t take long for an entire section of tissue to fail. If that failure is bad 
enough, it can jeopardize the health of one of your organs. And when an organ 
is in trouble, it won’t be long until your whole body is in serious danger.
Nerve damage
Nerve tissue — the stuff that makes up your brain, spinal cord, and all your 
nerves — is very delicate, and it’s subject to damage from incredibly small 
amounts of toxins. The toxins in some insecticides, for example, can cause 
brain damage in a matter of hours from just a single exposure. Or take some 
of the heavy metal toxins I describe earlier in this chapter. If you have an 
acute exposure to one of those substances, or even many small exposures 
over a long period of time, you can easily end up with damage to your ner-
vous system that extends from your brain to your spinal cord to the nerves 
that spread out throughout the rest of your body.

33
 Chapter 2: Tackling the Different Types of Toxins and Their Effects on You
Some research even argues that conditions affecting the nervous system — 
Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and multiple sclerosis are just three examples — 
can be partially caused or accelerated by heavy metals and other chemicals 
that cause toxic nerve damage. As with many medical debates, there are sup-
porters with considerable evidence on both sides of that conversation, and 
additional studies that will help to shed light on the issue are being published 
all the time. But there is no question that heavy metals cause nerve damage.
Intestinal complications
You may not think very highly of your intestinal tract, especially if you’ve had 
any encounters with a spicy habanero enchilada lately, but your intestines 
really are marvelous, complicated things. The processes that take place in 
your intestines are absolutely vital to your health, and keeping that part of 
your body in tip-top shape can go a long way toward boosting your overall 
health. Unfortunately, many of the toxins to which we’re exposed every day 
can have an incredibly negative effect on your intestines.
Any unhealthy, unnatural thing (read: toxin) that you eat or drink that isn’t 
broken down in your mouth or stomach can cause irritation or inflammation 
of the intestines. When your intestines get inflamed, the result may be diar-
rhea, which is one way that your body tries to rid itself of toxic materials. If 
the inflammation persists, the intestines will slow down their function, and 
constipation is the result.
 
Many people try to override the diarrhea part of the process by taking medi-
cines, but that’s not always the best route. After all, your body could simply 
be trying to clear out a substance that doesn’t belong. Before you reach for 
the antidiarrheal medicine to help solve a minor case of diarrhea, consider the 
option of drinking plenty of water and enduring the problem to give your body 
the chance to rid itself of a potentially harmful substance.
Chronic inflammation of the intestines due to toxins can also cause a condi-
tion called leaky gut syndrome. Leaky gut syndrome isn’t often recognized by 
doctors of traditional medicine, but a growing amount of evidence supports 
the theory behind the condition. With leaky gut syndrome, your intestines 
aren’t able to maintain a proper barrier between the contents of your intes-
tine and your bloodstream. Materials that should remain in your intestines 
pass through into your bloodstream, and food allergies and other ailments 
may result.

Fat cell accumulation
One of the body’s mechanisms for dealing with toxins (read all about those 
mechanisms in Chapter 4) is to store the toxins in fat cells. That works out 
only if the toxin in question is fat-soluble, meaning that its chemical makeup 
allows it to be stored in fat. When your body sticks a toxin in a fat cell, the 
fat cell tries to get bigger in order to decrease the concentration of the newly 
introduced toxic substance. And what happens when your fat cells increase 
in size? Fat is accumulated, and you gain weight. This process is part of the 
reason that people suffer from obesity, which of course is a problem of epi-
demic proportions in the United States, costing us billions of dollars every 
year.

Chapter 3
Discovering Where Toxins Come 
From (And How to Avoid Them!)
In This Chapter
▶ Keeping toxins out of your food
▶ Making sure your water is toxin-free
▶ Breathing clean, toxin-free air
T
he toxins that surround us today are many and varied, but the ways in 
which those toxins enter our bodies are limited to three main routes: our 
food, our drinking water, and the air we breathe. If you want to live a truly 
detoxified life, all you have to do is make certain that every morsel of food 
you eat, every drop of water you drink, and every breath of air you take are 
toxin free! As you may imagine, that’s very difficult to achieve, but if you do 
you’ll be rewarded with a healthier life.
In this chapter, I offer insight on how toxins assault you through food, water, 
and air. I let you know how toxins end up in these three places, explain a little 
about what they can do to your body in certain situations, and provide useful 
tips on how you can avoid eating, drinking, and breathing toxins.
Hungering to Understand Toxins in Food
The food you choose to eat is one of the most important factors — some 
people would argue the most important — in determining your overall health. 
It’s such an old cliché, but you really are what you eat. If you want to be toxin 
free, you have to eat toxin free (or at least as toxin free as possible).
In this section, I tackle a couple key questions:
 
✓ How does food end up loaded with toxins?
 
✓ What basic steps can you take to avoid toxins in food?

36
Part I: Getting to the Bottom of Natural Detoxification 
You may be shocked by the many toxic hurdles that your food has to clear 
before it ends up on your dinner table, but after reading about all the poten-
tially toxic influences you probably won’t be surprised to find out that quite a 
lot of your food contains some sort of dangerous material. And you’re sure to 
wonder — if you don’t already — how you can begin to take steps to limit the 
amount of toxin-filled food that ends up on your plate. That’s why I finish this 
section with some very basic recommendations for how you can start that 
process. (I dive into much more detail on that topic in several of the chapters 
you can find in Part II.)
Digging up details about toxins in soil
Soil is the starting point for a huge number of food products that we eat 
today. The plants that make up a substantial part of our diets — from basic 
grains to exotic fruits — get their start in the soil. And plenty of the other 
materials we consume, such as meats, either eat plants that were grown in 
soil, are in constant contact with soil, or both. Good ol’ dirt really is the start-
ing point for a lot of the calories we take in every day.
The troubling part about the importance of soil in helping to grow and sup-
port the things we eat is the fact that soil can be extremely toxic. Many 
thousands of tons of toxic materials are released directly onto the earth each 
year, and many thousands more make their way to the soil after first being 
pumped into the air or into bodies of water.
 
When it comes to toxins in the soil, one of the top offenders is a group of 
substances that are supposedly added to the soil to improve the food we eat: 
fertilizers. Fertilizers can contain all sorts of toxic materials, and the ways in 
which these materials end up in common fertilizers may cause you to cringe.
One example is the practice of mixing industrial wastes into fertilizers. Yes, 
you read that right: Industrial waste is sometimes “recycled” and used as 
a component in fertilizer. The general idea behind this process is that some 
industrial byproducts, including zinc and nitrogen, are key ingredients in cer-
tain types of fertilizer. So instead of trying to dispose of the byproducts, why 
not just use them to create the fertilizers that make our soil more productive? 
Well, for starters, the byproducts don’t contain only zinc and nitrogen. They 
can also contain toxins like the heavy metals that I explain in Chapter 2.
You may wonder how this practice is allowed to continue. Put simply, some 
people argue that the amounts of toxins in the industrial waste that eventu-
ally ends up in the soil aren’t necessarily any higher than the levels that are 
normally found in the soil. (Remember that many toxins, particularly heavy 
metals, do exist in nature in small amounts.) But the truth is that we don’t 

37
 Chapter 3: Discovering Where Toxins Come From (And How to Avoid Them!)
fully understand what this practice is doing to our soil and to our food, and 
there’s no question that the fertilizers are much more toxic than what naturally 
occurs in soil.
 
You may also be wondering why farmers would knowingly add toxins to the 
soil through the use of fertilizers. The truth is that many fertilizers don’t list 
the toxic materials they contain because fertilizer producers aren’t required 
to list all the ingredients used to make their products — only the active ingre-
dients that make plants grow faster or bigger.
Another fertilizer-related source of toxins in our soil are biosolids: the waste 
materials removed from our water at water treatment plants. Biosolids are 
commonly sold or given away for use as fertilizer. The idea is that the biosol-
ids are a somewhat more natural alternative to chemical fertilizers, which is 
all well and good. The problem is that biosolids have their own toxic compo-
nents, like hormones, detergents, pesticides, carcinogens, antibiotics, and 
other pharmaceuticals. Basically, anything that ends up in our water supply 
can end up in biosolids, and that includes plenty of toxins. When you get 
right down to it, biosolids aren’t really a more natural alternative to chemical 
fertilizers.
Investigating insecticides and pesticides
The use of pesticides on fruit and vegetable crops can often result in increased 
amounts of dangerous toxins in your food. (Pesticides are chemicals used to 
kill insects, fungi, and even rodents.) The goal of most pesticides is to wipe 
out pests but not harm other living things. Unfortunately, the majority of 
pesticides contain toxins that endanger the health or even the lives of many 
animals — humans included.
 
Children are especially vulnerable to the toxins in pesticides, even when 
amounts are extremely small. If you’re buying or serving food for kids, try 
to cut down on the amount of pesticides that end up on their fruits and veg-
etables. Check out Chapter 7 for details.
Pesticides contain so many different toxic ingredients that poisoning can affect 
any body system. The most common effects are on the nerves: Acute poison-
ing can cause tremors, shakes, and severe psychiatric and behavioral changes, 
not to mention brain tumors. And you don’t have to be exposed to a large 
amount of these types of toxins to get sick from them. Very small doses over 
a long period of time can result in severe damage to your health. The National 
Academy of Sciences estimates that in the next 70 years, pesticide residue on 
food will cause 1 million additional cases of cancer in the United States.

38
Part I: Getting to the Bottom of Natural Detoxification 
More than 3,000 active toxic ingredients are used in pesticides, and U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) records show more than 100,000 
registered pesticide products in the United States. That massive number 
includes pesticides that are used on the largest farms down to the pesticides 
you buy for your lawn or garden.
If you want to buy pesticides to use on your garden at home, make sure you 
know which pesticides are the most dangerous. How? Pay close attention to 
pesticide labels. Pesticide products each have one of three labels, as follows:
 
✓ Caution: Mildly toxic. Anything more than an ounce is a lethal dose for a 
human. (Even smaller amounts will kill a child.)
 
✓ Warning: Medium toxicity for a pesticide. A teaspoon to a tablespoon is 
enough to kill an adult.
 
✓ Danger: Highly toxic. A very small amount is enough to kill an adult. 
(Look for the skull and crossbones symbol to identify a pesticide in the 
“Danger” category.)
 
I strongly suggest cutting out the use of pesticides at home. You can find 
natural, nontoxic products that will rid your house and yard of pests; a quick 
online search will yield several options. But if you choose to use chemical 
pesticides, please try to stick to products in the “Caution” category.
Of course, most of the food you eat doesn’t come from your garden, so what 
can you do to ensure that you’re limiting the amount of pesticide toxins that 
ends up on your food? You can take several steps, from washing fruits and 
vegetables thoroughly to making wise decisions when you’re buying your 
food. I include suggestions at the end of this chapter, and you can find more 
detail in Chapter 7.
Picking out problems with processed food
When I talk about processed food, I mean food products created using prac-
tices that range from genetic modification to food additives. To me, process-
ing includes anything that’s done to food outside of natural conditions. And 
at this point, all kinds of strange and dangerous things are done to our food 
long before we take a bite.
Genetic modification
The processing of food starts very early, even before the food is grown or 
raised. Genetic modification, which involves tinkering with a plant or animal’s 
genes to make it easier to grow as a food source, is done on about 70 percent 
of the food in the average grocery store. Genetically modified foods aren’t 
usually created to provide better nutrition but rather to increase production 
(so we can grow more tomatoes or raise more beef, for example).

39
 Chapter 3: Discovering Where Toxins Come From (And How to Avoid Them!)
I know it doesn’t sound like such a bad thing to grow more food, but we don’t 
fully understand the long-term effects that genetically modified foods can 
have on our bodies. For example, some vegetables are genetically modified 
to cause them to produce a toxin that acts as a pesticide so insects and other 
critters aren’t as likely to feast on the crops. There’s currently a debate on 
what effect that toxin can have on humans when the vegetables eventually 
end up on our plates. At the very least, I think we can all agree that what’s 
going on is not a natural process, and there’s real potential for negative 
effects on our health that we don’t yet fully understand. For a much more 
detailed discussion of this subject, see Chapter 6.
Food additives
In total, food companies add 2,800 substances to their products in an effort 
to save a buck, boost sales, and ensure that their food will last on the store 
shelves for a very long time. If I covered all 2,800 of these substances here, 
your shelf life probably wouldn’t be enough to get through them all. So 
instead I provide a snapshot of some of the toxins that are intentionally 
added to processed foods:
 
✓ Aspartame: One of the most toxic substances we are exposed to 
nearly every day, aspartame is a blend of toxic chemicals that’s used 
as a sugar substitute in processed foods. You can find it in everything 
from diet soft drinks to chewing gum. It took the U.S Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) 16 years to approve aspartame, and now millions 
of pounds of it are added to our food each year.
 
 Aspartame can act as an excitotoxin — a chemical that causes nerve 
cells to fire rapidly. Some studies have shown that excitotoxins cause 
nerve cells to fire so unusually fast that they do themselves irreparable 
harm.
 
 This substance can cause dizziness, visual impairment, disorientation, 
muscle aches, numbness, and more. At 86 degrees Fahrenheit, aspar-
tame breaks down into wood alcohol, formaldehyde, and then formic 
acid — all toxic. Some women also report that aspartame worsens the 
symptoms of premenstrual syndrome (PMS).
 
 Aspartame is often used as a sugar substitute in so-called “diet foods,” 
even though no conclusive evidence links aspartame (or any other sugar 
substitute, for that matter) to weight loss.
 
✓ BHT: You don’t need to know the long chemical name that is abbreviated
as BHT, but you do need to know that it’s a common additive in many 
processed foods. In many ways the jury is still out on BHT, but the 
International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), which is an arm 
of the World Health Organization, considers BHT to be a possible 
carcinogen. To me, even a possible carcinogen is worth avoiding.

40
Part I: Getting to the Bottom of Natural Detoxification 
 
✓ High fructose corn syrup: This is a big one. High fructose corn syrup 
has become the primary sweetener in all kinds of foods, from soft 
drinks to cereals. You’d have a hard time walking more than a foot 
down any grocery store aisle before running into a food that includes it. 
Unfortunately, high fructose corn syrup contains mercury, which is one 
of the worst toxins for humans and one that I write about quite a bit in 
this book. This chemical form of fructose has also been linked to tooth 
decay, migraines, diabetes, obesity, and cancer. My advice is to start 
cutting down on the amount of high fructose corn syrup you’re eating 
and drinking now, and keep cutting down until you’re consuming very 
little or none of it.
 
✓ Monosodium glutamate (MSG): A huge range of processed foods include 
MSG — an additive that enhances food taste. MSG is an excitotoxin that 
can cause symptoms like nausea, cramps, dizziness, rash, heart palpita-
tions, numbness, and even mood swings and confusion.
 
✓ Olestra: Olestra is essentially a fake fat. It’s used in place of fat in pro-
cessed foods to make the nutritional information look a little better 
for people who are trying to lose a few pounds (although no evidence 
proves it can help with dieting). How does it work? Simple: Olestra mol-
ecules are too big for our digestive systems to absorb, so this substance 
just moves on down the line instead of ending up in our bodies like 
normal fats. But here’s the problem: You must have some real fats in 
your diet for you to absorb key vitamins like A, D, E, and K, not to men-
tion carotenoids (nutrients that protect us from cancer).
 
✓ Sodium benzoate: This substance is a food preservative and a common 
additive in soft drinks. Also known as benzoic acid, it is thought to form 
benzene in soft drinks, especially when it can combine with vitamin C. 
Benzene is a very nasty toxin and a known carcinogen.
 
✓ Splenda: Splenda is another artificial sweetener that can cause toxic 
effects. It’s made by adding chlorine to a natural sugar. The result is 
a material in the same chemical family as DDT and chlordane — two 
extremely toxic substances. Studies conducted on animals have shown 
Splenda to cause swelling and damage to the liver in moderate doses, as 
well as tumors in some animals.
 
When food additives are evaluated to figure out how toxic they can be for the 
human body, they’re tested one at a time. This is a real problem because just 
like most other toxic situations, the combination of two or more food additives 
can multiply the toxic effects of all the additives. In other words, the food 
additive combo can be more toxic than the sum of its parts! For example, if 
certain blue food colorings (which you can read about next) are added to MSG, 
the toxic effect is seven times as potent as it would be if the additives were 
kept separate. And remember than many processed foods contain several 
additives, so it’s not uncommon to find a toxic mix in a single product.

41
 Chapter 3: Discovering Where Toxins Come From (And How to Avoid Them!)
Food coloring
Artificial food coloring may make processed foods look bright and (for some 
strange reason) appetizing, but the toxins that make up these additives don’t 
belong in your body. Most artificial food colors are derived from coal tar 
and petroleum. It doesn’t take a nutritionist to tell you that coal tar doesn’t 
belong in the human diet. You’d expect to see food coloring as an ingredient 
in things like junk food and soft drinks, but it also pops up in some less obvi-
ous places, like salmon and fresh cherries. Here’s a quick rundown of a few 
common food colors:
 
✓ Blue 1&2: Used in baked goods, candy, and beverages. Both dyes have 
been linked to cancer in tests using mice.
 
✓ Green 3: Used in sauces, jellies, and more. This one has been linked to 
bladder cancer.
 
✓ Orange B: Approved for use in only hot dog and sausage casings. This 
dye has been associated with urinary obstruction.
 
✓ Red 3: Sprayed on fresh cherries and used in fruit cocktails, baked 
goods, and candy. Studies have shown it causes thyroid tumors in rats.
 
✓ Red 40: Used in snack foods. This dye has been linked to hyperactivity 
disorders.
 
✓ Yellow 5: Used in soft drinks, potato chips, jams, jellies, and more. This 
dye is strongly associated with hyperactivity and tantrums in children.
 
✓ Yellow 6: One of the most commonly used dyes in sausage, gelatin, 
baked goods, candy, and beverages. It has been linked to tumors of the 
adrenal glands and kidney.
Many of these color chemicals also contain heavy metals. (Flip back a chap-
ter to read all about heavy metals and their effects on your body.)
Paying attention to packaging
If you read any of the last few pages, you can plainly see that our food is 
exposed to many different kinds of toxins through soil contamination, pesti-
cide use, and food processing. As if that weren’t enough, the packaging that 
surrounds our food can introduce toxic chemicals as well.
Hundreds of harmful chemicals are either included in or used to make food 
packaging materials, and I don’t have the space here to discuss them all. 
But it’s important that you consider packaging as a source of toxins, so in 
the next couple of pages I provide a quick look at a few of the most common 
toxins found in food packaging.

42
Part I: Getting to the Bottom of Natural Detoxification 
BPA
Some common varieties of plastic — including several that are used to make 
food containers — contain a chemical called Bisphenol-A (BPA). BPA is a 
synthetic sex hormone that has been linked to cancer, miscarriage, obesity, 
reproductive problems, heart disease, early puberty, and hyperactivity.
 
BPA is very harmful and particularly troublesome because it’s found in so 
many different types of containers, from the linings of food and drink cans to 
baby bottles. You can find BPA in plastic food containers, sippy cups (special-
ized drinking cups for infants and toddlers), and even the IV tubes used in hos-
pitals. (Okay, that last one is not technically food related, but it’s still a pretty 
scary place to find a dangerous toxin.)
How widespread is BPA? The EPA states that 20 percent of the U.S. diet 
comes from foods that are packaged in plastics that contain BPA. And the 
BPA present in all that packaging material is clearly finding its way into our 
bodies: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently 
reported that 93 percent of Americans it tested have BPA in their systems.
To help cut down on your exposure to BPA, do the following:
 
✓ Use glass containers for food storage whenever possible.
 
✓ Limit your use of plastics stamped with a #7 on the bottom for any food-
related purposes. (Not all #7 plastics contain BPA, but this is still a good 
general rule.)
 
✓ Don’t microwave or heat your food in any plastic containers; heating 
plastics that contain BPA makes the chemical leach out into food at a 
much faster rate.
As with many toxic chemicals, the debate about the harm that BPA can do to 
us continues to rage on. My advice? Stay away from BPA whenever you can.
Phthalates
Phthalates are another dangerous class of chemicals found in food packag-
ing. You rarely see the word “phthalate” listed anywhere, but the individual 
chemicals included in the group are easier to spot: DINP, DEHP, BBP, DBP, 
DUNP, DIDP, DNOP, and DIBP are some common examples. You can find 
these chemicals in many kinds of plastic materials, including plastic food 
containers and plastic food wrap.
 
What do phthalates do to the human body? The chemicals are suspected of 
causing cancer, reproductive problems, liver disease, and kidney disease, 
among other problems. To get an idea of how nasty phthalates are, take a look 

43
 Chapter 3: Discovering Where Toxins Come From (And How to Avoid Them!)
at the following wording, which appears on the label for pure DINP (the kind 
you’d use in a lab if you were a chemist):
May cause cancer; harmful by inhalation, in contact with skin, and if swal-
lowed; possible risk of irreversible effects; avoid exposure; and wear suit-
able protective clothing, gloves and eye/face protection.
All the effects of phthalates like DINP aren’t fully understood yet, but do you 
really want a substance that requires such a scary warning label coming in 
contact with the food you eat and the food you feed your family? I doubt 
it. To limit your exposure, avoid products that include one or several of 
the phthalate acronyms in their ingredients. Also, avoid the use of plastics 
stamped with a #7, and heat up your food in glass or porcelain containers 
instead of plastics.
PFOA and PFCs
Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorochemicals (PFCs) are in a class 
of chemicals used to make nonstick cookware and utensils, and they’re also 
found in grease-resistant coatings for food packaging. If you don’t limit the 
discussion to food-related materials, you can also throw in stain-resistant 
carpeting and fabrics and waterproof clothes as sources for the chemicals. 
Both PFOA and PFCs are toxic. It looks like the EPA will eventually classify 
PFOA as a carcinogen, and 19 EPA studies show PFCs to be a substantial risk 
for human health.
Dodging toxin-heavy foods
Nothing would make me happier than to tell you that you can completely 
avoid toxins in your food. Unfortunately, I don’t think it’s possible to cut 
out every single toxin from your diet. The best you can do is work hard to 
limit the amount of toxic exposure you and your family get from the food 
you eat. If you do that, you’ll be light-years ahead of the majority of people. 
Understanding the problem and working to correct it are both enormous 
steps in the right direction.
In this section, I don’t cover every detail of how you can fill up your grocery 
cart (and your dinner plate) with toxin-free foods, but I do provide basic tips 
on how to start the process. You can find some useful information on how 
to avoid specific types of food-related toxins in the first several pages of this 
chapter, and you can read much more on the topic in Chapters 6 and 7.

Reading food labels
It’s easy to jot down a list of food items you need at the grocery store and 
then just cruise up and down the aisles until your cart is full and the foods on 
your list are all crossed off. The way that foods are produced, marketed, and 
put in front of you on the shelves has been streamlined to the point that you 
can fill your pantry quickly, easily, and cheaply without giving much thought 
to the process. The downside is that the path that toxins take to your food — 
and your body — has been streamlined too, and if you want to work toward 
limiting your exposure to toxins you have to insert some thought back into 
the process. One key way to do so is to read food labels carefully and com-
pletely when you’re making choices about what foods to buy and eat.
Here are three steps for reading food labels to help you spot and avoid toxins:
 
1. Don’t buy a food if it contains ingredients that you don’t know or can’t 
pronounce. I know that sounds incredibly simplistic, but it’s a good 
general rule. For example, if you see a label that features ingredients like 
“100 percent organic pepper,” “100 percent organic carrots,” or “salt,” you 
can feel pretty good about the lack of toxic materials that are added to the 
food as ingredients. However, if you see things like acesulfame-K — one of 
hundreds of common toxic ingredients — you want to pass on buying or 
eating that food product. (I discuss this rule in more detail in Chapter 5.)
 
2. Pay attention to the order in which ingredients are listed. Ingredients 
are listed according to the amount of each ingredient in the food. The 
ingredients that make up most of the food are listed first, and the ingre-
dients that are present in smaller amounts are listed last. If you really 
believe that you have to buy a food product that contains a potentially 
harmful ingredient, try to buy a variety or brand that lists that ingredi-
ent at or near the bottom of the ingredients list.
 
3. Watch out for different variations of the same toxin. Food companies 
commonly list questionable ingredients under different (yet suitable, 
according to regulations) names or words. For example, forms of MSG 
can be listed as “calcium caseinate,” “textured protein,” or “glutamic 
acid,” to name a few variations. You can’t be expected to memorize every 
variation of every toxin, so use this rule in combination with rule #1 in this 
list. If you think an ingredient may be a different name or variation of a 
toxin and you can’t pronounce it, don’t buy it.
 
Some similar (and potentially harmful) ingredients can be listed with very dif-
ferent names and in multiple places within an ingredients list. Take sucrose, 
dextrose, and maltose, for example. They’re common substitutes for sugar, 
and some processed foods contain two or even all three of them. A food label 
may list the three near the bottom of the ingredients list because technically 

45
 Chapter 3: Discovering Where Toxins Come From (And How to Avoid Them!)
they’re different substances, but if you add up all the amounts of each con-
tained in the food, it would be more like the first or second ingredient on the 
list. This technique is called stacking, and it’s a common method for making an 
ingredients list look a little better than it really is.
Knowing the most common toxins in food
If you wanted to remember all the toxins that can be found in or on food 
products today, you’d probably have to quit your job and work on memoriz-
ing toxins full time. Realistically, you can’t know everything about toxins in 
food, but you can do yourself (and your family) quite a bit of good if you just 
avoid the most common food toxins. Keep your eye out for these top toxin-
containing ingredients:
 
✓ Artificial colors
 
✓ Aspartame
 
✓ High fructose corn syrup
Thirsting for Toxin-free Water
What’s more important to life than water? Every living thing that we’ve ever 
discovered has required liquid water to survive, and humans are certainly 
no exception. The human body can go a few days without water, but if you’re 
like me, you’d rather not go more than a few hours without a tall glass of it.
Our need for fresh water and the fact that most materials will dissolve in water 
make it particularly troublesome as a vehicle for spreading toxins. You need to 
be aware of the many toxic threats that your drinking water can pose, and you 
also need to consider the steps you can take to ensure that your water is as 
toxin-free as possible. I provide information on both fronts here.
Figuring out how toxins end 
up in drinking water
Many of the toxins pumped into our air and onto our soil end up in our water 
supply. Rain and the movement of water on and in the ground have a way of 
picking up substances — toxins included — and moving them all together 
toward a nearby body of water. These bodies of water include the various 
reservoirs that make up our drinking water supplies. So it shouldn’t shock 

46
Part I: Getting to the Bottom of Natural Detoxification 
you to find out that the water that comes out of the tap in your kitchen sink 
isn’t sparkling clean and toxin free.
Drinking water can contain all kinds of toxins. Read on to find out about a few 
of the most common.
Pharmaceuticals
 
The prescription and over-the-counter drugs we take don’t all get absorbed 
into our systems when we pop a pill or drink a spoonful of syrupy medicine. 
A good portion of those pharmaceuticals passes virtually unchanged through 
our bodies and gets flushed (quite literally) down the toilet. More than 100 
different kinds of drugs have been detected in water supplies all over the 
world, so we’re not talking about an isolated problem here.
You may assume that the water treatment processes used to clean up our 
water take care of these wandering pharmaceuticals, but that isn’t the case. 
The most common water treatment techniques don’t remove or change phar-
maceutical compounds. So if you think about your municipal water supply, the 
antibiotics your postal worker has been taking for his sinus infection, the pain-
killers your coworker took after her recent surgery, and the antidepressants 
your neighbor has been taking could be ending up (in small quantities) in your 
water supply. And then there are the veterinary medicines used on pets and 
farm animals. (The hormones used in raising beef cattle have been found in 
many water supplies and have been causing quite a stir in the media lately.)
The amounts of pharmaceuticals present in our water are small, but the whole 
idea behind most of these medicines is for a relatively small dose to have 
an effect on your entire body, so even tiny amounts can cause changes to 
your body’s systems. Even more troubling is the threat of drug allergies: If a 
person has an extremely strong drug allergy, he could potentially suffer an 
allergic reaction just by drinking water from his community’s water supply.
Commercial waste
Trillions of tons of toxic waste are released into our environment every year 
through commercial and industrial processes, and toxic materials have a ten-
dency to collect in water.
 
Chemicals are usually assumed to be harmless unless proven otherwise, so 
most of the 80,000 chemicals used in or in the making of the products that sur-
round us haven’t been through a government-sanctioned safety review. Most 
of these chemicals aren’t even monitored until someone notices patterns of 
illness, disease, or death resulting from exposure. Unfortunately, sometimes it 
takes years of exposure to a toxin before the effects show up and cause a real 
health problem, and by then it can be too late.

47
 Chapter 3: Discovering Where Toxins Come From (And How to Avoid Them!)
Processing
The processing of wastewater is designed to turn water that has been used 
into water that can be used again — to purify and clean it so it’s safe for 
drinking, bathing, and so on. However, many water processing operations 
don’t do a great job of removing chemical toxins, and known toxins are often 
added to the water supply.
The focus of most water processing efforts is to remove large solids from 
and disinfect the bacteria in the wastewater. Steps are also taken to remove 
a number of dangerous chemical toxins, but thousands of other toxins aren’t 
taken into account.
What’s even more disconcerting is the common practice of treating water 
supplies with toxic chemicals like chlorine for the purpose of killing bacteria. 
Chlorine has an unquestionably toxic effect on the human body, causing irri-
tation and damage to the respiratory system among other things. The EPA 
contends that the levels of chlorine in drinking water that result from the 
chemical’s use as a bacteria killer aren’t high enough to harm the people who 
drink and bathe in it, but many people disagree. If you’re not crazy about 
having a sip of chlorine with your drinking water, read on to find out how you 
can seek out a solution.
The watershed effect
A watershed is an area of land where all the 
water under it or on it goes to the same place. 
There are 2,110 watersheds in the United 
States, some of which cover thousands of 
square miles. Toxins can have a devastating 
effect on a watershed because small amounts 
of a toxin spread over a large area can be car-
ried by moving water within a watershed and 
concentrated where the water eventually col-
lects. You may not live close to a manufacturing 
plant that releases toxic chemicals, but if that 
plant is within your watershed there’s a good 
chance that it — and any other toxic source in 
your watershed — is contributing to the con-
tamination of your area’s water supply. (Many 
areas use reservoirs or lakes as their primary 
water supply.) The same is true of the toxic 
fertilizers and pesticides used on farmlands. 
You may not live right next door to a field that 
is sprayed with these materials, but if that field 
is located in your watershed, your water supply 
could be at risk.
The millions of Americans who depend on pri-
vate wells for their water aren’t immune to the 
problem. Toxins can be transported by ground-
water, and as a result toxic chemicals can be 
dumped on the ground and turn up in well water 
many miles away.

Avoiding toxin-tainted water
Water, water everywhere — but what is safe to drink? The barrage of toxic 
threats to our water supplies makes that a tough question to answer.
Local and municipal water supplies are regulated by the EPA, but the overall 
quality of water from place to place within the United States can vary greatly. 
Bottled water is regulated by the FDA, but the quality of bottled water can 
vary as well. In the next few pages, I clue you in on how you can flatten out 
some of that variation and help to ensure the quality of the water you’re 
drinking by figuring out your local water report, getting your water tested, fil-
tering your tap water, and buying bottled water that meets your standards.
Analyzing your local water report
Municipal water departments are required to make a public notice of water 
quality on an annual basis but don’t have to test it every year. Your local 
water department can provide you with that information upon request, and 
the folks managing the water supplies in many areas send out the reports 
each year as a matter of course. In larger communities the information is also 
available online, so do a little online research to find out if the details of your 
water quality may already be at your fingertips.
It’s great that water departments are required to make public the analysis of 
the water supply, but reading one of those documents can be quite a task. 
You usually find a lot of information on just a few pages, and the details can 
be both technical and confusing. Taking a good look at the report is certainly 
worth your time, though, and you can make the process easier by keeping a 
couple things in mind:
 
✓ Take note of all the toxins I talk about in this book that are not included 
in the report. That means your water department is not testing for them.
 
✓ Pay special attention to footnotes or asterisks. As in reports from any 
other government or industry group, these notes can allow important 
information to be stashed away in the fine print.
 
 I once received a report from our local water department that had a 
footnote symbol in the section on the arsenic levels in our water. The 
footnote said that the arsenic data was based on a water sample from 
three years ago. It didn’t explain why the arsenic data was from test-
ing that took place three years earlier. (You would think that the water 
department could secure a sample of its own water for a new test.) I 
tried to get an answer that would clear up the situation, but the water 
department never provided any solid reasoning for the footnote. I can 
only conclude that the arsenic data was from the last year the water 
actually passed the EPA guidelines, which didn’t give me a whole lot of 
confidence in the quality of the water coming out of my tap.

49
 Chapter 3: Discovering Where Toxins Come From (And How to Avoid Them!)
Getting your water tested
Everyone should consider getting their water tested for these six different 
categories of dangerous materials: microorganisms, disinfectants, disinfec-
tion byproducts, inorganic chemicals, organic chemicals, and radionuclides. 
(It’s not critical that you understand all the details about these categories. 
Just know that any comprehensive water test should include all six.) A water 
test is particularly important for families that rely on well water, but even if 
you’re connected to a municipal or local water supply, don’t rule out the idea 
of getting some tests run on the water that comes out of your taps.
 
The National Institutes of Health (NIH) recommend that well water be tested 
at least once each year for dangerous chemicals and bacteria. It also recom-
mends that testing be done even more frequently if an infant is drinking the 
water or if there’s a chance that the well’s structure was recently damaged in 
any way. If you’re on a well, you also want to know if any oil, gas, or mining 
operations have ever been present in the area; if the land has ever seen heavy 
pesticide use; and if a junkyard or landfill is (or has been) nearby. If any of 
these activities have taken place on or near the land, make sure you opt for 
extremely thorough testing.
If you’re on a municipal water supply, you may think it strange to have your 
water tested. But even if your city water supply is pristine, a lot can happen 
to the water between the city’s pipes and your tap. Your house’s plumbing, 
or even some of the city’s pipes, could contain lead or other metals that can 
leach into your water, and water tests can detect those toxins.
In addition to these general testing recommendations, specific conditions 
merit water tests, including the following:
 
✓ If anyone in your home has recurrent gastrointestinal problems, have 
your water tested for toxic bacteria.
 
✓ If you notice strange stains in sinks, toilets, or clothing that you’ve 
washed at home, test for copper, manganese, and iron.
 
✓ If your water has a foul smell or taste, test for hydrogen sulfide, acidity, 
copper, lead, iron, zinc, and sodium.
 
✓ If you’re getting an usually large amount of soap scum residue in your 
tubs, sinks, and toilets, have your water checked for hardness (heavy 
salt content).
 
✓ If you’re thinking about moving into a new house, have the water tested 
before you make the commitment to move in.
 
✓ If you live in a rural area, you may want to get your tap water tested. 
Some rural areas don’t have the funding to carry out the more expen-
sive types of water treatment. Also, there’s a greater likelihood that the 
water has been contaminated by runoff from agricultural fertilizers and 
pesticides.
 
✓ If you are planning to get pregnant, make sure your water is pure.

50
Part I: Getting to the Bottom of Natural Detoxification 
When you make the choice to have your water tested, the first step is to 
contact your local and state health departments. Some departments will test 
your water free of charge, although in most cases those tests are pretty lim-
ited. After you’ve exhausted those possibilities, you can turn to private water 
testing companies. You can find a listing in your phone book or online.
 
When selecting a private water testing company, make sure you use only those 
companies that are licensed in your state to conduct water testing. Also, make 
sure that the company you choose is willing to speak with you in depth about 
the results of the water tests. Much of the information that comes out of the 
testing process is technical, so you’ll need someone to talk you through it.
For more information on water purity and testing, check out the EPA’s Web 
page for ground water and drinking water: www.epa.gov/ogwdw.
Removing toxins from your tap water
If you’re concerned about toxins in your tap water, look into setting up a 
system for filtering or purifying your water. Dozens of options for water filter-
ing and purification are available, and you can find many of them online or at 
your local hardware or home improvement store. A perfect system doesn’t 
exist, but with a little research you can select one that fills your specific 
needs. Most of the units fit under your sink or on your countertop, although 
some are meant to be installed where the incoming water pipe enters your 
house. Here’s a rundown of the most common options:
 
✓ Carbon water filters are easy to install and inexpensive. They absorb 
many toxins and microorganisms while letting most minerals pass through. 
Carbon filters don’t change the acidity of the water (a good thing), but 
they’re subject to developing mold if left unused for long periods of time 
(a bad thing). I think carbon filters are a good, basic option for water 
filtration.
 
✓ Water distillers definitely produce water that is free of impurities, but 
the distillation process also removes minerals from water. Your body 
needs many of the minerals found in tap water, so if you go the water 
distiller route you need to make sure you’re getting plenty of minerals 
elsewhere in your diet. Water distillers also tend to produce more acidic 
water, which isn’t the healthiest.
 
✓ Ceramic filters are adept at filtering out microscopic particles and 
microorganisms. The filters can be renewed by brushing them under 
running water. One downside: Ceramic filters tend to noticeably 
decrease the flow of water.
 
✓ Reverse osmosis (RO) filters are readily available in a variety of sizes 
and are relatively inexpensive. Your local home improvement store prob-
ably has several options. A system with a 1-gallon reserve costs about 
$150. Most RO filters are easy to install. (I speak from experience — 

51
 Chapter 3: Discovering Where Toxins Come From (And How to Avoid Them!)
I recently installed one.) They remove almost all toxins, but you must 
remember that the good minerals are also removed.
 
✓ Ultraviolet (UV) radiation systems use a special lamp to kill all living 
organisms and leave the minerals untouched, but the lamp loses its 
effectiveness over time and you can’t tell whether it’s still working with-
out testing the water. Another big downside: UV systems don’t remove 
heavy metals and other chemical toxins from your water.
Buying clean water
If you want to skip tap water altogether for drinking purposes, you can turn 
to bottled water as your primary source. If that’s your choice, you’re cer-
tainly not alone: Americans drink more than 7.5 million gallons of bottled 
water each year.
 
Bottled water can seem pristine and pure, but don’t let those pictures of 
peaceful springs and snow-capped peaks on the labels fool you. In many cases, 
bottled water is just as likely to contain toxins as tap water, so you need to do 
your research to make sure the bottled water you’re buying is as toxin-free 
as possible. Forty percent of bottled water is straight tap water with no addi-
tional treatment. Do your research to guarantee that the water company does 
proper treatment.
The bottled water industry is regulated by the FDA under its food safety pro-
gram, but the FDA doesn’t do any active testing. You can find bottled water 
quality reports on the Web sites of many of the largest bottled water compa-
nies, and most of the other companies will provide you with information on 
their water’s quality if you request it.
In addition to water that comes in bottles that you simply buy off the shelf, 
many grocery stores now have in-house reverse osmosis (RO) water systems 
that you can use to fill large (usually 5-gallon) reusable containers. RO water 
is probably the most consistently clean water you can buy, but it contains 
few if any natural minerals. It’s worth noting that the large containers used in 
this process are almost always made of the type of plastic that doesn’t leach 
toxins into your water.
A Breath of Not-So-Fresh Air: Inhalable 
Toxins (And How to Avoid Them)
Thus far in human history, we’ve had a tough time figuring out a good way to 
live without breathing. Good, clean air is critical for people to live healthy, 
happy lives. If you’re hoping for a way around that fact, all I can tell you is 
don’t hold your breath.

52
Part I: Getting to the Bottom of Natural Detoxification 
The good news is that we’re not in any danger of running out of air. There’s 
plenty of it to go around, so we’re definitely in good shape on the quantity 
front. The problem with our air is the quality. In our centuries-long quest to 
make human civilization bigger and badder all across the globe, we’ve done 
quite a lot of damage to the quality of our air. Despite the efforts of many 
people to cut down on air pollution, we’re still spewing untold amounts of 
toxins into the atmosphere every year.
Toxins in our air can cause just as many health issues as toxins in our water 
and in our food. If you’re committed to detoxifying your body, you need to 
figure out what’s floating in the air around you and what you can do to keep 
airborne toxins out of your system.
Understanding airborne commercial 
and industrial toxins
You can’t blame commercial and industrial processes for all the rampant air 
pollution that has taken place in the last couple centuries, but our plants and 
factories are responsible for more than their fair share. Many of the toxins 
I describe in Chapter 2 are released into the air (usually as byproducts) in 
some form by industrial operations just as often as they’re dumped into our 
water and on our soil. Several other toxins seem to be particularly problem-
atic when it comes to air quality.
In the next couple pages, I describe in some detail the most common and 
dangerous toxins that are released into our air every single day. I hope that 
through reading this section, you can better understand what we’re up against 
as we work toward cleaner air for ourselves, our families, and everyone else 
sharing this planet.
 
If you want to see specific information about the air quality in your area, visit the 
EPA’s air quality information page at www.epa.gov/air/data/geosel.html. 
You can plug in your zip code or select your state from a map of the United 
States to see a report on the quality of the air you’re breathing right now.
Carbon monoxide
We release huge amounts of carbon monoxide into the atmosphere every 
year, and most of it can be traced back to automobile engines. When you 
inhale carbon monoxide, it attaches to your red blood cells where oxygen is 
supposed to attach — a huge problem. It can cause brain damage and death, 
among other horrible things. To help protect yourself and your family from 

53
 Chapter 3: Discovering Where Toxins Come From (And How to Avoid Them!)
this common toxin, make sure your home’s heating system is running properly 
and avoid situations in which you’re inhaling large amounts of automobile 
exhaust.
Ozone
When you hear the word ozone, you may think of the ozone layer and the 
hole that we put in it over the course of a few decades in the twentieth cen-
tury. Ozone is a gas composed of three oxygen atoms stuck together. Yes, 
this gas makes up the ozone layer, which blocks many of the harmful effects 
of the sun. But when ozone is present lower in the atmosphere — at or near 
ground level, for example — it’s a potent toxin that contributes heavily to 
the formation of smog. Ozone has a very harmful effect on the lungs and 
lung tissue. It causes coughing, shortness of breath, and chest pain, and it’s 
particularly rough on people who suffer from asthma. Like carbon monoxide, 
ozone is released in automobile exhaust, and when it gets together with other 
airborne pollutants to form smog, your best bet is to steer clear.
 
Many large cities now make ozone alert announcements when levels of ozone 
in the area’s air become dangerously high. If you live in a metropolitan area, 
look for ozone alerts in your local news sources. When an alert is announced, 
do your best to stay in a controlled-air environment. You don’t have to hole 
up in your house until the alert is lifted. But if you have an outdoor activity 
planned and you see an ozone alert, consider switching your outdoor plans to 
a different day. Chances are your picnic or bike ride will be a lot more enjoy-
able if you’re not breathing in elevated toxin levels all day.
Lead
I cover lead in detail in Chapter 2, but I include it here also because it’s a 
common airborne toxin. I know it may seem odd to think of lead (which is a 
very heavy material) floating around in the air, but lead dust is released into 
the atmosphere all the time by waste incinerators, smelters, and makers of 
batteries that contain lead. If you live near any of those types of operations, 
be sure to get tested for lead. And if you have children, make doubly sure 
they are tested regularly as well. (Check out Chapter 5 for more information 
on seeing a doctor about your toxicity levels.)
Nitrogen dioxide
Nitrogen dioxide is another airborne toxin present in automobile exhaust. It 
has toxic effects on the lungs and can be especially harmful for people who 
have asthma or lung disease. If you spend time near major roadways, your 
exposure is likely 30 to 100 percent higher than if you live and work away 
from heavily trafficked roads. Unfortunately, about 16 percent of homes in the 

54
Part I: Getting to the Bottom of Natural Detoxification 
United States are located within 300 feet of a major roadway, so millions of 
Americans are exposed to high amounts of nitrogen dioxide. If possible, keep 
that in mind when it comes time to move to a new area or into a new home.
Sulfur dioxide
Sulfur dioxide is one of many sulfur chemicals that easily dissolves in water 
and forms acid. These chemicals are released by all sorts of industrial pro-
cesses, and they can have extremely detrimental effects on your lungs and 
other organs. They also help to create acid rain, which is damaging to many 
different aspects of our environment and health.
Acrolein
Acrolein is a prevalent but not very well-known toxin that has many uses in 
industry; it may be most commonly used as a multipurpose pesticide. (You 
can read all about the dangers of pesticides a little earlier in this chapter.) 
The harmful effects of this toxin include serious complications for your 
mucus membranes and respiratory tract.
Manganese
Manganese is an essential element for good health — you’ll likely find it listed 
in the ingredients for your multivitamin — but excess levels can be very toxic. 
Manganese poisoning can cause symptoms similar to those of Parkinson’s 
disease, including tremors, difficulty walking, and facial muscle spasms. The 
most common source of toxic problems with manganese is welding. If you’re 
involved in welding or have a welder in your family, be sure to include manga-
nese when you get tested for toxicity.
Mercury
I write about the horrible toxic effects of mercury throughout this book. (Flip 
back one chapter for lots of basic information.) When it comes to airborne 
toxins, mercury comes into the picture in what can seem like a very peculiar 
setting: the dentist’s office. Airborne mercury is created every time a dentist 
makes, applies, drills, or removes an amalgam (often called silver) filling. 
These fillings are half mercury, which means dentists and their staff are usu-
ally exposed to quite a bit more mercury than the rest of the population. In 
all my years of practicing medicine, I have never tested a dentist for mercury 
who didn’t have toxic levels in his or her body.
 
If you think you may have been exposed to airborne mercury because of amal-
gam fillings, you should get tested for mercury toxicity. This is especially true 
if you work in a dentist’s office where amalgam fillings are created, handled, 
and removed on a regular basis.

55
 Chapter 3: Discovering Where Toxins Come From (And How to Avoid Them!)
Having dental fillings removed
If you need or want to have amalgam fillings 
removed, you and your dentist should follow 
these protocols to limit your exposure to the 
mercury they contain.
The patient’s protocol
As the patient, you should take the following 
supplements starting before your fillings are 
removed:
 ✓ Cilantro: Helps with mercury removal
 ✓ Vitamin C: Improves immunity and 
detoxification
 ✓ Alpha-lipoic acid: Aids liver health
 ✓ Garlic: Boosts immunity and has sulfur
 ✓ Kidney formula (with juniper and uva ursi): 
Strengthens kidney health
 ✓ Liver formula (with milk thistle and olive 
leaf): Boosts liver health
 ✓ Vitamin D: Aids kidney function and bones
 ✓ Turmeric: Helps immunity
 ✓ Vitamin B complex: Aids liver function
You should also take detox baths once a week 
while the fillings are being removed. This aids 
the removal of mercury and other heavy metals 
from the skin. In the bath water, add
 ✓ 2 cups Epsom Salt (which contains magne-
sium sulfate)
 ✓ 1 cup baking soda
 ✓ 2 to 3 teaspoons of powdered vitamin C
 ✓ 2 to 3 teaspoons of yellow mustard powder
These substances will help pull heavy metals 
from the skin. Yellow mustard contains sulfur, 
for example, which bonds to mercury and pulls 
it out of the skin.
Soak in the tub for 15 to 20 minutes, and then 
scrub your skin with soap. The bath water will 
begin to turn dark gray and cloudy. The discol-
oration will leave a ring around the tub, which 
lab tests have found to contain aluminum, lead, 
and mercury.
For additional assurance, you can have an IV 
with vitamin C before the filling removal and a 
chelation treatment with DMPS after removal 
(see Chapter 18 for details).
The dentist’s protocol
The dentist should use a certified mercury removal 
protocol, which includes these measures:
 ✓ Clean air filtration in the room where fillings 
are being removed
 ✓ A rubber dam to prevent mercury pieces 
from being swallowed or inhaled
 ✓ Water coolant to keep the filling from heat-
ing up (because heat releases toxic mer-
cury vapors)
 ✓ High-speed suction or vacuum for removing 
toxic vapors and debris
 ✓ Filtration masks for all employees in the 
room while the procedure is performed
If your dentist won’t follow this protocol, search 
for a dentist who will. Online, look for biological 
or holistic dentists at these Web sites:
 ✓ The International Academy of Oral 
Medicine & Toxicology: www.iaomt.
org
 ✓ The International Academy of Biological 
Dentistry and Medicine: www.iabdm.

Formaldehyde
Many people think of formaldehyde as embalming fluid, and they’re some-
times shocked to find out that the toxic chemical is used widely in the 
production of things like leather goods, plywood, particle board, paper, 
foam insulation, and even pharmaceuticals and vaccines. It’s a gas at room 
temperature, and exposure can cause eye and throat irritation, nausea, head-
ache, and fatigue. High levels of exposure can cause swelling of the lungs, 
which can result in death. Formaldehyde has a distinctive odor that you may 
remember from the frog dissection portion of your high school biology class. 
If you work in a setting where formaldehyde is used, insist on being given a 
respirator — it can save your life.
Benzene
Like formaldehyde, benzene is used across a wide range of industries and 
applications. It is generated by burning coal, gasoline, and oil, and it’s used 
in the making of products like inks, rubber, plastics, and pharmaceuticals, to 
name just a few. Benzene causes eye, skin, and respiratory irritation, along 
with headache and dizziness. Short-term elevated levels can cause uncon-
sciousness and death, and if you’re exposed to benzene over a long period 
of time it’ll wreak havoc on your body. It has reproductive effects, damages 
your blood, and is (according to the EPA) a likely carcinogen. If your job puts 
you in contact with benzene, make sure you have a good respirator and use 
it whenever exposure is probable. If you’re worried about benzene levels 
in your body, check out Chapter 18 for information on how you can utilize 
saunas to help rid your body of benzene (and other toxins, as well).
Getting a feel for the inhalable 
toxins in your home
If you think that most airborne toxins come from factory smokestacks and 
hang in the air only in the smog that envelops some cities and industrial 
areas, think again. Your home could be a hotbed of airborne toxins.
Many household products, particularly cleaning products, are loaded with 
toxic chemicals. Take a quick look at the ingredients of some of the products 
you have in your home, and compare that list with the toxins described in 
Chapter 2 and elsewhere in this book. Not only are these products toxic if 
you have skin contact or (heaven forbid) accidentally ingest them, but the 
fumes they put off are also toxic.
A recent study looked at the toxins present in 120 homes on Cape Cod, which 
probably isn’t an area that springs to mind when you think about toxic envi-
ronments. The study focused on the air and dust present in those homes, and 

57
 Chapter 3: Discovering Where Toxins Come From (And How to Avoid Them!)
the findings were hair-raising. Every single house had more than 20 toxic com-
pounds known to cause cancer, neurological problems, and birth defects. 
There were even traces of some substances that had been widely banned 
years before (like DDT), and plentiful amounts of toxins like phthalates 
(which I describe in detail earlier in this chapter).
What are the sources of the inhalable toxins that are present in the homes of 
many Americans? Following are a few examples:
 
✓ Paint fumes
 
✓ Dry cleaning
 
✓ Air/carpet fresheners
 
✓ Detergents and fabric softeners
 
✓ Household insecticides
 
✓ Lawn and garden chemicals
Do yourself (and your family) a favor and work toward limiting your exposure 
to these toxic materials.
 
Chlorine is a very common inhalable toxin in many homes. Use bleach cleaners
and detergents containing chlorine sparingly (if at all), and remember that if 
you can smell chlorine, that means you’re being exposed to more than you 
really should be.
Cleaning the air around you
The threats presented by inhalable toxins are serious and tough to avoid. So 
how can you clean up your air and limit the amount of toxic materials that 
you’re breathing every day? The following are a few excellent first steps:
 
✓ When you’re outside, be mindful of the quality of the air around you. 
Pay attention to air quality measurements on your local weather report, 
and spend your time outdoors on days when the air is relatively clean. 
Avoid being outdoors near manufacturing plants, refineries, and major 
roadways.
 
✓ When you’re moving to a new home, keep air quality in mind. You 
probably won’t end up buying or renting a new home based on the air 
quality in the area — there are usually many other pressing matters to 
consider. But if you can factor in the home’s proximity to sources of 
airborne toxins, your lungs (and the rest of your body) will thank you.

58
Part I: Getting to the Bottom of Natural Detoxification 
 
✓ Cut down on the inhalable toxins you keep in your home in the form 
of household products. The first things to go should be insecticides, 
pesticides, and anything that says “danger,” “poison,” or even “caution.” 
This includes cleaning supplies, so please don’t insist on trying to hang 
on to toxic cleaners.
 
There are many excellent alternatives to toxin-filled household cleaning supplies. 
A knowledgeable staff member at your local health food store can probably 
suggest all sorts of choices or even tell you about ways that you can make 
your own safe cleaning supplies. If you can’t find suitable replacements for 
your old products, use them sparingly and always in well-ventilated areas.
Here are some tips to get your household moving in the right direction:
 
✓ Use natural cleaning products. For example, vodka or other grain alco-
hol makes a great cleaning spray.
 
✓ Pay special attention to your carpet. Carpet accumulates and holds 
dust and toxins. If you must have carpeting, clean it often and use a 
vacuum with a filter that does not spray the dust back into the air.
 
✓ Change your filters frequently. Air conditioning filters and ducts can 
be a source of toxic accumulation and exposure. Change your filters 
according to the recommendations set out by the manufacturer, and use 
quality filters. You can also have your ducts inspected and cleaned pro-
fessionally, especially if you live in an older house.
 
✓ Use a quality HEPA air filter. HEPA stands for high efficiency particulate 
air, and HEPA filters do a great job of removing airborne toxins from indoor 
environments. Hundreds of HEPA filters are on the market, so do some 
online research and even consult with your doctor before choosing the 
one that is right for you and your family.

Body Detoxifies Itself
In This Chapter
▶ Discovering how your mouth and stomach contribute to detoxification
▶ Investigating the incredible detox abilities of your intestines
▶ Seeing the important role your skin plays in detoxification
▶ Looking at the toxin-fighting functions of your liver and kidneys
T
he wonders of the human body never cease to amaze me. When you 
really think about what your body is capable of doing, I bet you’re 
amazed too. One of the most impressive things your body does is deal with 
the influx of toxins.
From your mouth to your skin to your kidneys — and many places and parts 
in between — your body is set up to help you avoid and cleanse yourself of 
toxins. I think it’s critical to grasp all the ways in which your body deals with 
toxins so that you can play an active role in helping it out and augmenting 
its detoxification processes. That’s what I focus on throughout this chapter. 
Take a spin through the next several pages to find out what’s going on inside 
your body to help maintain your health against an environment that contin-
ues to get more toxic with each passing year.
Your Mouth: Chewin’ It Up
All digestion starts in the mouth. Food and liquids enter your body through 
your mouth, and some extremely important things occur there. Successful 
and healthy digestion requires that the mouth is doing its job, and your 
body’s ability to detoxify itself can be greatly aided if you make an effort to 
allow your mouth to do its important work.

60
Part I: Getting to the Bottom of Natural Detoxification 
Remember when your mom told you to slow down and chew your food? That 
was excellent advice. When your teeth tear and grind your food into smaller 
bits, your food is better prepared to go through the various steps in diges-
tion. Chewing your food well allows your stomach and intestines to break 
down the food and extract its nutrients with a higher degree of effectiveness. 
The result is a healthier you all across the board, and it’s a heck of a lot 
easier for your body to fight off toxic threats if it’s healthy. But that’s not the 
only detoxification value that chewing your food offers.
 
When you chew thoroughly instead of swallowing larger bits of food, you make 
it easier for the acid in your stomach to break down the food. Stomach acid is
a terrific toxin fighter, and you want to see that your body is taking full 
advantage of its powers, so be sure to chew your food thoroughly before 
swallowing it.
In addition to chewing, the mouth adds an ingredient that’s critical for 
digestion: saliva. This super fluid does all sorts of great things:
 
✓ Binds and lubricates: The mucus in saliva makes the food you eat very 
slippery, and it binds the food together in a soupy mixture that slides 
down your esophagus without damaging the lining of that important 
tube, which runs from your mouth to your stomach.
 
✓ Allows you to taste dry food: Without saliva, it would be virtually 
impossible to taste dry food. If you were eating something with toxins that 
can be tasted — food spoiled by harmful, toxic bacteria, for example — 
you probably wouldn’t even know it.
 
✓ Decreases acidity: When you eat highly acidic food, there’s always a 
chance that the acid could damage your mouth (including your teeth) and 
esophagus. Saliva contains sodium bicarbonate, which is a chemical that 
reduces acidity. Sure, your stomach is highly acidic, and after your food 
gets there it gets fully soaked in acid. But your stomach lining is equipped 
to handle acids in a way that your mouth and esophagus just can’t.
 
✓ Starts the digestion of starches: Saliva releases a chemical that begins 
to break down starches into basic sugars. That’s a good thing because 
your body can’t do much at all with starches, while it absolutely has to 
have sugars (for energy) to survive.
 
✓ Kills bacteria: This is a big one. Saliva contains a substance called lyso-
zyme that can kill off bacteria in your food and even the bacteria that 
try to grow in your mouth and on your teeth. If you read Chapter 2, you 
know that some types of bacteria can be just as toxic as the worst chem-
ical toxins, so it’s of the utmost importance that you’re not bringing high 
levels of bacteria into your body when you put food in your mouth. (A 
side note: Bacteria cause bad breath. Healthy amounts of saliva kill more 
bacteria, thereby helping you to avoid bad breath.)
 
✓ Improves oral hygiene: Saliva constantly flushes away food debris, 
which is a major cause of poor oral hygiene.

61
 Chapter 4: Understanding How Your Body Detoxifies Itself
 
This advice really surprises some people, but you shouldn’t drink fluids with 
your meals. Doing so simply isn’t good for digestion. If you need to wash down 
your food with liquids, you’re not chewing your food enough, and you’re not 
allowing the food to be penetrated by and covered in saliva. You’re also dilut-
ing the acid in your stomach, which is an important component in the process 
of killing toxic bacteria before it enters your intestines. Many pharmaceutical 
drugs reduce saliva and can cause a really dry mouth; if you have this prob-
lem, talk to your doctor. My advice is to wait a couple hours after a meal 
before drinking fluids. After that, you can drink all the water you want.
Your Stomach: Breakin’ It Down
If your body had a trash can, it would be your stomach. When your sinuses 
use mucus to trap particles of dust, viruses, mold, and bacteria, where does 
that mucus end up? In your stomach. When your mouth takes in food and liq-
uids that could contain dangerous, toxic bacteria, where does that material 
end up? In your stomach. When the tubes leading down to your lungs trap 
foreign materials in the air you breathe before they get down to your sensi-
tive lung tissue, where do they send those materials? That’s right — up your 
windpipe, into your esophagus, and then down into your stomach.
Your stomach is rough, tough, and ready to take on just about anything you 
put into it. Can you blame it for growling every once in a while?
Death to the microbes!
The key to the stomach’s wonderful ability to handle almost everything your 
body throws at it is stomach acid. This isn’t some weak acid like the kind in 
your orange juice. If your stomach acid were sitting on your kitchen table 
instead of in your stomach, you’d soon be in the market for a new kitchen 
table. It’s even strong enough to eat away metal, so you can imagine the 
number it does on many toxic materials that end up in your stomach when 
you inadvertently eat, drink, or breathe them in. Your stomach acid breaks 
down many types of dangerous toxins, and the health of your stomach is an 
important factor in keeping your body as toxin-free as possible.
Stomach acid can kill almost anything that’s living when it reaches the stom-
ach. As you can imagine, this ability has major benefits for your immune 
system. It’s a whole lot easier for your body to simply kill off things like harm-
ful bacteria, mold, and parasites in your stomach than to deal with the effects 
of those critters compromising your immune system.

62
Part I: Getting to the Bottom of Natural Detoxification 
Interfering with your stomach’s work
When stomach acid is potent and present in healthy amounts, it can be very 
difficult for potentially harmful living things to pass through the stomach and 
enter your intestines. However, many people today take medication — both 
prescription and over the counter — for stomach pain or indigestion, thereby 
lowering the amount and strength of acid in the stomach. These medicines 
can help to relieve stomach pain, but they also make it a lot easier for living 
threats to survive in your body and eventually give your immune system fits.
 
If you’re experiencing frequent stomach pain or indigestion, make sure you 
and your doctor consider several possible causes before you start taking 
medication that weakens the acid in your stomach. The pain can be caused by 
a number of different things, and you don’t want to compromise the important 
acid in your stomach if you don’t need to.
When one of my patients experiences a burning feeling in her stomach or 
symptoms of acid reflux, I always test the levels of acid in her stomach. I 
don’t expect to find extremely high levels of acid; in fact, in most cases (and 
especially with older patients) the problem is a lack of stomach acid. Hard to 
believe? Here’s how it works.
When it’s working correctly, your stomach won’t let food enter your intes-
tines until the food is at least partially digested. If you don’t have enough acid 
in your stomach, the food isn’t digested well enough and your stomach hangs 
onto it instead of sending it on down the line. Soon your stomach begins 
to contract on the stalled food in an effort to try to mix it with the small 
amounts of acid present. If it’s five hours after you’ve eaten a meal and you’re 
lying down with a stomach full of food, and your stomach begins contracting, 
you’re bound to have pain or acid reflux.
This sequence of events is most common in older patients. A higher percentage 
of older people are taking potent acid-reducing medication than ever before. If 
that were the right solution, the cause would have to be that older people are 
producing higher amounts of more powerful stomach acid as they age. That 
would mean that the cells in the stomach are working better in their effort to 
produce more acid. But let’s be honest: Hardly anything works better as we 
get older — stomach cells included. In these situations it could very well be 
that acid-reducing medicines are a counterproductive treatment. If you think 
you may be making your stomach problems worse by taking medicines that 
cut down on your stomach acid, be sure to bring up the question with your 
doctor before taking any action. The bottom line is that most acid reflux is 
cause by low acid — not high acid.

63
 Chapter 4: Understanding How Your Body Detoxifies Itself
 
The good news if you’re acid deficient is that the problem is relatively easy to 
correct. You can take an old medicine called sucralfate that doesn’t lower acid 
levels but does help to cover any raw spots in your stomach lining that could 
be causing you pain. (The most common brand name for sucralfate is 
Carafate.) You can use this drug in combination with betaine HCL, which helps 
acidify your stomach to the right levels when you’re eating a meal. That com-
bination will correct stomach pain problems in many people. But again, please 
don’t take these steps until consulting your doctor.
Breaking down good and bad proteins
In addition to killing off harmful organisms, the acid in your stomach works 
to break proteins down into amino acids, which your body has to have in 
order to survive and thrive. (You can read a bit about amino acids and their 
important nutritional value in Chapter 5.)
Without the stomach’s processing of protein into amino acids, you wouldn’t 
be able to digest and absorb those materials into your bloodstream, and 
you’d have a hard time staying healthy for very long. Keeping up healthy 
levels of acid in your stomach is key here. If you use acid-reducing medica-
tions unnecessarily, you could be putting your nutrition at risk.
Your Intestines: Thirty 
Feet of Detox Action
It’s hard for some people to believe, but your large and small intestines are 
a combined 30 feet in length. That’s the length of a football field’s end zone! 
And the sheer size of your intestines pales in comparison to what they do 
when it comes to sorting out toxins and absorbing the right nutrients into 
your body. They really are fantastic body parts, and much of the detoxifica-
tion effort put forth by your body takes places all along that 30-foot length.
Your intestines have thousands of little folds called villi. They add a huge 
amount of surface area to the intestines — so much, in fact, that they make 
the total area of your intestines that’s available for absorption roughly the 
same size as a tennis court! Villi are responsible for absorbing different mate-
rials out of the partially digested food that passes by them. Whatever they 
absorb is passed into your bloodstream and therefore made available for 
your body to use. They’re not supposed to absorb toxins, of course — anything 

64
Part I: Getting to the Bottom of Natural Detoxification 
your body doesn’t need should pass by and out with your stool — but some 
toxins have a chemical structure that allows them to get past the villi and 
into your bloodstream.
As a rule, your intestines do a masterful job of absorbing the nutrients you 
need and shunning the toxins that can harm you. But if you don’t get enough 
of the former and you’re bringing in far too much of the latter, you can cause 
some major problems for your intestines. I shouldn’t have to tell you how 
important it is to maintain the health of a 30-foot organ that is responsible for 
the absorption of almost all your body’s nutrients.
Bringing up the barrier
When you think about it, the wall of your intestines is really the only thing 
between your body’s tissues and your stool. It’s an amazing and very protec-
tive barrier, and it’s almost magical in its ability to let the good stuff pass into 
your body while keeping the bad stuff moving through with your waste.
In addition to providing a wonderfully dynamic physical barrier, the intestines 
also include a lot of important elements of your body’s biological barrier against 
disease: your immune system. It’s a little-known fact that about 80 percent of 
your body’s immune system is located in your intestines. The GALT (gut-
associated lymphoid tissue), located mostly toward the end of your small intes-
tine, is the final barrier that separates the inside of your body from your stool, 
which at that point usually contains harmful things like toxins, bacteria, yeast, 
mold, and parasites.
 
Taking in too many toxins through your diet can compromise the health of your 
intestines, including the GALT. That situation makes it difficult to maintain the 
integrity of both the physical barrier and the immune barrier, and disease is 
often the result. If you want to keep your intestinal barriers working like they 
should, do what you can to eliminate toxins from your diet.
Considering normal flora
Your intestines perform some critical functions, but they also act as a board-
ing house for most of the beneficial bacteria living in your body. The normal, 
healthy bacterial flora in your intestines play an important role in digestion, 
breaking down several different kinds of food that your body isn’t able to 
break down on its own.
The normal flora in your intestines also provide you with another service. 
When present in healthy amounts, the beneficial bacteria take up space and 
nutrient resources that could otherwise be used by harmful, toxic organisms 

65
 Chapter 4: Understanding How Your Body Detoxifies Itself
like bacteria, yeast, and parasites. I provide some details on normal bacterial 
flora in Chapter 5, so flip ahead if you’d like to read more.
Eliminating the mess
The chemical processes and reactions that take place in your intestines when 
nutrients are absorbed and toxins are shut out are as complex and elegant 
as anything you’d find in even the most technologically advanced chemical 
company. On top of that, your intestines also have a very complicated way 
of moving your partially digested food and stool through at a proper rate, 
so that all the processes can take place in the right amount of time. This 
function helps to keep toxins moving through and eventually out of your 
body. If your intestines move things too fast, diarrhea (which can have a 
disastrous effect on your nutrition and hydration levels) is often the result. If 
your intestines move things too slowly, constipation can occur. When your 
stool spends more time in your intestines than it should, you’re just giving 
the toxins in your stool more time to hang around and get inadvertently 
absorbed into your system.
There are many intestinal diseases that conventional physicians typically 
treat with medication that helps to control the symptoms but doesn’t do 
anything to address the cause of the problem. Many of these ailments, like 
Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, and irritable bowel syndrome, can be 
greatly exacerbated by the presence of too many toxins in your diet, and 
detoxification diets often go a long way toward providing relief.
Your Skin: Touchable and Functional
Your skin is the largest organ you have. In terms of avoiding toxins, the role 
your skin plays is indispensable. Your skin is the first line of defense against 
any toxins that you don’t eat, drink, or breathe.
The skin has three layers:
 
✓ The epidermis: This is the outer layer that you can see. It gets a lot of 
wear and tear, and it regenerates very rapidly if you’re healthy.
 
✓ The dermis: Your dermis is the next layer down from your epidermis, 
and it contains all sorts of useful things like blood vessels, hair follicles, 
oil glands, and sweat glands. (I clue you in on the importance of sweat-
ing a little later in this section.)
 
✓ Subcutaneous fat: This layer gives you some insulation and padding, 
but fat cells are often locations for toxin storage.

66
Part I: Getting to the Bottom of Natural Detoxification 
Now that you have a basic understanding of the structure of your skin, let 
me explain what it does for your body in terms of aiding in detoxification and 
helping you to avoid taking in toxins in the first place.
Putting up a barrier
Like the intestines, which I describe in the previous section, the skin creates 
a barrier between your body’s tissues on one side and potentially toxic influ-
ences and conditions on the other. But the skin isn’t as receptive to allowing 
some substances to cross the barrier into your body. Skin works to keep most 
of what’s outside on the outside. If you take care of your skin and don’t expose 
it to an overwhelming amount of toxic threats, it does an excellent job.
 
Some toxic chemicals are very rapidly absorbed, and you should never allow 
those materials to touch your skin. If you’re handling any potentially toxic 
substances, make sure you wear the proper safety clothing, gloves, and eye 
protection.
As a mechanical barrier, your skin makes your body waterproof. Because 
many toxins are water soluble, this means that your skin keeps out some of 
the toxins that may be dissolved in the water that you bathe in or swim in. 
One of the other terrific aspects of skin is that it takes care of itself. If you 
injure your skin and compromise its barrier, making it more likely to allow 
various toxins to cross over into your body, your skin will heal itself. It has to 
be tough but flexible, and it includes oil glands that help it to flex and bend as 
you move. If it needs to get tougher, then over time calluses develop to keep 
the barrier intact in places where you really put it to the test.
 
Skin is a versatile barrier that keeps many toxins from gaining access to the 
inside of your body. But like many other body parts, it can only do so much. 
If you don’t make an effort to keep your skin healthy and free from excessive 
toxic threats, it can be compromised, and increased toxicity is the result. 
Making an effort can be as simple as avoiding swimming in water that could 
have elevated toxin levels or wearing gloves when handling potentially toxic 
materials. It’s also important to give your skin all the nutrients that it needs, 
especially vitamin C, sulfur, and omega-3 fatty acids (fish oil).
Giving a nod to natural bacteria
If you read about your intestines earlier in this chapter, you know how useful 
it can be to have natural, beneficial bacteria around. The same holds true for 
your skin. Having enough good bacteria present can prevent bad bacteria 
from growing and building up.

67
 Chapter 4: Understanding How Your Body Detoxifies Itself
Hundreds of types of bacteria are present on your skin, and several of them 
are considered good bacteria. One of the most prominent is Staphylococcus 
epidermatis, which plays a key role in keeping toxic, harmful bacteria in 
check on your skin.
 
You can help the good bacteria on your skin to keep its upper hand on the bad 
bacteria simply by washing your body. Don’t go overboard, though, because 
excessive washing with harsh soaps can wipe out the good bacteria and also 
break down the skin’s natural oils, which can serve as an additional layer of 
protection against bad bacteria.
Sweating (out) the small stuff
I can’t say enough about the importance of sweating in detoxification. It truly 
is one of the most effective ways our body can get rid of toxins.
 
As a natural detoxification process, sweating is one of the best ways to rid your 
body of toxins that can be present for many years. Under normal conditions, 
we sweat about a quart of liquid a day, and it’s estimated that sweating can 
remove about a third of the toxins that your kidneys can. Not bad!
I know it’s a little creepy to think that some toxins can hang around your 
body for several years, but that is indeed the case. When toxins end up in 
your bloodstream or in your tissues, your body tries to protect your organs 
by stuffing fat-soluble toxins into fat cells to isolate them. If your body 
doesn’t know how to process or get rid of a toxin, it just stores it away in a 
place where it’s not as likely to damage your organs as it would be if the toxin 
were floating around in your bloodstream. After a toxin is stashed away in 
a fat cell, it can remain there for many years. This process can result in the 
buildup of fat and weight gain, because fat cells have a natural mechanism 
that makes them grow in an effort to try to dilute the toxins within them. 
Bigger fat cells mean more fat and an increased likelihood that you’ll gain 
weight. You can read much more about this topic in Chapter 9.
Sweating aggressively — that is, more than what you typically sweat on an 
average day — mobilizes the toxins from your subcutaneous fat cells to your 
sweat glands, where they can be moved outside your body as you sweat. 
When that happens, the concentration of toxins in your fat cells is much 
lower. The cells aren’t as likely to try to grow to dilute the toxins, so you may 
be able to lose weight and clear out excess fat.
 
Less than a hundred years ago, most people were sweating aggressively every 
day, and in the summer they were in somewhat of a sauna for a good part of 
the day. The advent of air conditioning changed all that (at least in many parts 
of the developed world), and we sweat quite a bit less as a result. That’s nice 

68
Part I: Getting to the Bottom of Natural Detoxification 
for keeping shirts clean, but it undercuts your body’s efforts to detoxify itself 
through sweating. To make sure that you’re getting the full detoxification ben-
efit of sweating, exercise regularly and consider using a sauna to enhance the 
frequency and intensity of your sweating. (You can read more about saunas in 
Chapter 18.)
Your Liver: A Detoxification Powerhouse
Your liver is a very complicated organ, and it performs many essential func-
tions. (Some researchers estimate that the liver performs as many as 500 
different functions for your body!) Much of what the liver does is compli-
cated, and you don’t really need to understand all the ins and outs to grasp 
its importance and its role in detoxification. Here, I’d like to give you a basic 
understanding of some of its crucial processes:
 
✓ Toxin processing: All the materials absorbed by or inadvertently leaked 
into the intestines go into a special vein that leads directly to your liver. 
The liver processes the blood by removing and breaking down many of 
the toxins. I dive a little deeper into the details of this process later in 
this section. Your liver processes about two quarts of blood per minute.
 
✓ Bacteria destruction: Your liver is loaded with immune cells, which kill 
many of the bacteria that manage to work their way through the intesti-
nal wall.
 
✓ Cholesterol creation: Cholesterol is made in the liver. You may not think 
of cholesterol as a good thing, but cholesterol is very important for your 
body; cholesterol is the basic molecule used to generate several of your 
most critical hormones.
 
✓ Blood protein production: Ninety percent of your blood proteins are 
made in the liver. That’s extremely important for you, and also for all 
those vampires out there.
 
✓ Blood clotting: The clotting of blood doesn’t actually take place in the 
liver if everything is working as it should, but several of the materials 
your body uses for blood clotting are made in the liver.
 
✓ Antioxidant production: An antioxidant called glutathione is one of the 
most important for your body’s healthy function, and it’s made and 
stored in your liver.
 
✓ Blood sugar control: Your liver helps control your blood sugar by con-
verting glucose to glycogen (a form of glucose that your body can store) 
and vice versa.
 
✓ Vitamin storage: Vitamins A, D, and B12 are stored in the liver. So is iron.
 
✓ Bile production: Bile breaks down fats in your intestines, and it removes 
toxic waste from your liver. Your liver makes bile (as if it weren’t doing 
enough already!).

69
 Chapter 4: Understanding How Your Body Detoxifies Itself
So the liver really is a jack of all trades. You can thank your liver for break-
ing down many, many toxins in your body (although you might avoid doing 
that in public — people tend to think it’s strange when you talk to your liver 
outside of the privacy of your own home). There are two main ways that your 
liver breaks down toxins, and I present the broad strokes of both next.
Phase I detoxification
Two major types of detoxification occur in the liver: Phase I detoxification and 
Phase II detoxification. Phase I either breaks down a toxin (rendering it pretty 
much harmless) or changes it somehow to prepare it for Phase II. (More on 
Phase II in a moment.)
During Phase I detoxification, your liver first tries to use enzymes to break off 
pieces of a toxic chemical’s structure. This process often works and results 
in a substance that is far less toxic and more water soluble, so it’s less dan-
gerous to your health and easier to move out of the body with one of your 
waste products. If that doesn’t do the trick, the next step is the addition of 
antioxidants. Sometimes that process works where the first step failed. If step 
two doesn’t work, it’s time for Phase II detoxification.
Before moving on to Phase II, I want to take a moment to tell you about several 
substances that can help to enhance Phase I detoxification:
 
✓ Nutrients: These include niacin, vitamin B1, vitamin C, and glutathione.
 
✓ Herbs: Caraway and dill seeds are two of the best.
 
✓ Foods: Cabbage, broccoli, oranges, grapefruit, tangerines, and Brussels 
sprouts are especially helpful.
For the sake of full disclosure, I’ll also admit that some drugs — narcotics, 
alcohol, nicotine, steroids, and phenobarbital — also increase the activity of 
Phase I detoxification. But as you can imagine, that’s only because the liver 
has to step up its game to deal with the influx of toxic materials that corre-
spond with drug use.
A number of things also slow down Phase I detoxification:
 
✓ Some herbs: Curcumin and capsaicin are examples.
 
✓ Certain foods: Clove oil, hot peppers, and grapefruit juice are among the 
top offenders.
 
✓ Drugs: Antihistamines, medicines that block acid secretion in the 
stomach, and certain antianxiety medications are culprits.

70
Part I: Getting to the Bottom of Natural Detoxification 
 
✓ Aging: Getting up in years slows down your liver’s Phase I detoxification. 
This is another good reason to try to limit your use of prescription drugs: 
They often have to be broken down by your liver, which puts a strain on 
it as you get older.
 
✓ Diet: As you’d expect, your diet can have a major impact on your liver’s 
health and ability to detox your body. Eating too many processed foods 
chock full of additives (and coated in pesticides) puts stress on your liver.
Studies have shown that the Phase I detoxification your liver is able to carry 
out is based heavily on genetic factors. Because of their genes, some people 
are fortunate to have livers that can process many more toxins than others. 
In some cases a person can conduct Phase I detoxification at more than five 
times the capacity of a similar person (in terms of age, sex, and so on) with 
different genetic makeup. This difference is one of the main reasons that cer-
tain people’s bodies are able to detoxify themselves in a much more efficient 
way than others.
Phase II detoxification
Phase II detoxification is often a continuation of Phase I, but it can happen on 
its own as well. Phase II detoxification works when the liver attaches toxins 
together or attaches other substances to toxins to make the harmful materials 
less harmful and more water soluble (easier to flush out with urine and bile).
 
Phase II detoxification is a very nutrient-intensive process, so consider including 
the following foods and supplements in your diet if you want to bolster your 
liver’s efforts:
 
✓ Food: Spinach, black beans, animal protein, legumes, pumpkin seeds, 
lentils, asparagus, broccoli, cabbage, and other leafy greens.
 
✓ Supplements: Fish oils, milk thistle, and alpha-lipoic acid. (Ask for 
details at your health food or supplement store.)
If you work on including these types of foods and supplements in your diet, 
you’ll make it a lot easier for your liver to carry out effective Phase II detoxi-
fication, and your health will get a nice boost. It’s more important now than 
ever because the amount of toxins you’re faced with on a daily basis contin-
ues to go up, so your liver’s ability to cope is extremely important.
 
Make sure you’re getting plenty of fiber in your diet. In addition to all the other 
useful things fiber can do for you, it helps your intestines clear out the toxins 
that your liver has processed. Without ample amounts of fiber, some of those 
toxins can be reabsorbed, and your liver’s hard work will have been for naught.

 Chapter 4: Understanding How Your Body Detoxifies Itself
The liver cleanse
No section on the liver would be complete without mentioning the liver 
cleanse. It’s a process that involves taking a mixture of food ingredients that 
are purported to help clear out excess toxins from your liver. The mixture 
usually includes olive oil, Epsom salt, and grapefruit, among other ingredi-
ents. Some people report very dramatic results like passing multiple gall-
stones, and others claim to see a marked improvement in general health after 
the liver cleanse is complete. Many proponents recommend doing a liver 
cleanse twice a year to combat the elevated levels of toxins that we’re faced 
with today. I think liver cleanses are a good idea for most people, although 
you need to be aware of a couple potential side effects:
 
✓ Doing a liver cleanse will activate your colon, so if you choose to do one 
be ready to make multiple trips to the toilet.
 
✓ If you’re like many people and you pass a gallstone during a cleanse, 
there’s an outside chance that it could get stuck on its way out. 
(However, I can report that hundreds of my patients have done liver 
cleanses, and this problem has never occurred.)
If you begin to feel abdominal pain while doing a cleanse, make sure you stop 
the cleanse immediately and get in touch with your doctor.
Your Kidneys: Major Detox Players
Most people give their kidneys a whole lot of abuse and not much credit. All 
of the water-soluble materials that end up in your blood eventually find their 
way to the kidneys, where they’re removed and sent out with your urine. The 
truth is your kidneys are very sophisticated organs that never stop filter-
ing your blood to remove toxins, keep salts and protein levels in check, and 
adjust your blood pressure. When it comes to detoxification, your kidneys 
are a major player.
If you want to keep your kidneys running at tip-top shape, try to limit your 
exposure to toxins (a no-brainer, I know) and make sure you drink lots of 
clean water without chlorine or fluoride in it. Your kidneys don’t stand a 
chance if you’re not drinking plenty of water, because in this case the solu-
tion to pollution is dilution!

72
Part I: Getting to the Bottom of Natural Detoxification 
 
To keep your kidneys — and the rest of your body, for that matter — healthy, 
try to drink enough water to keep your urine clear. Clear urine is a sign of a 
hydrated body. The only times your urine should have a darker yellow color is 
first thing in the morning and after you’ve taken vitamins, which can alter your 
urine’s tint.

In this part . . .
C
hances are good that you’re reading this book at 
least partly due to the fact that you want to improve 
your diet. (Most people do, right?) If that’s the case, 
you’ve come to the right place. Two of the most important 
features of this part are the breakdown of the various 
types of foods that contain toxins (so you can cut them 
out of your life) and my explanation of what you need to 
eat in order to make yourself as toxin-free as possible. 
Your food choices and eating habits will do as much to 
influence your overall health as anything else, so you 
need to make sure you’re doing the right (toxin-free) 
things.
I also use this part to clue you in on a few other detoxifica-
tion basics so you can begin to employ a rounded 
approach toward ridding your body of toxins. Finally, I 
include a quiz at the end of this part to help you figure out 
the toxicity of your body’s systems. Don’t worry — I won’t 
be grading it! 

Chapter 5
Taking the Detoxification 
Initiative: The Basics of Detoxing 
Your Body
In This Chapter
▶ Recognizing how crucial your diet is
▶ Using exercise to help reach your detox goals
▶ Exploring your options for supplements
▶ Making sure your intestinal flora has the right balance
▶ Picking a good, open-minded doctor
Your body is well equipped to maintain health and to detoxify an enor-
mous number of chemicals and toxins. It really is a marvelous natural 
machine. But your body does have its limits, and the world around you now 
is pushing those limits and in many cases exceeding them.
If you want to keep your health moving in the right direction despite the ever-
present threat of toxins, you have to make an effort to augment your body’s 
natural detoxification mechanisms. That’s what this chapter is all about. I 
take you through the basics of several types of active detoxification methods, 
from diet (which is perhaps the most important battle in your war against 
toxins) to exercise, supplements, and maintenance of your bowel flora. I even 
offer some advice on how you can find the right kind of doctor to support 
and enhance your detoxification.
You won’t find lots of specifics in this chapter — the details are in other chapters 
of this book. But if you’re looking for an overview of what you should do if 
you’re serious about detoxification, you’ve come to the right place.

76
Part II: Working toward a Detoxified Life: Getting Started 
Detoxing through Diet
Imagine a toolbox that contains all the detoxification techniques and methods 
you have at your disposal. The toolbox has a place for saunas, one for chelation 
(the process of using a chemical that can attach to and then remove a toxic 
substance), and on down the list. (I cover these and other detox options in 
Chapter 18 and in other spots throughout the book.) In this toolbox, you’d 
need a whole separate compartment for diet. Maybe even a whole drawer. 
You know what? You may even need another toolbox just to fit all the impor-
tant dietary components of a healthy, detoxified lifestyle. The right kind of 
diet is critical for effective detoxification.
Because diet is so critical, I certainly don’t skimp on the detox diet details 
in this book. But before you can grasp the finer points of adjusting your diet 
to accomplish detox goals, you need to feel comfortable with the basics, 
and that’s what this section is about. (If you’d rather dive right into the nitty 
gritty details about detox dieting, I recommend Chapters 6, 7, and 9.)
In order for your body to function and maintain health over the course of 
your life, you must ensure that you continually provide it with a number of 
nutrients. You don’t need these nutrients in any spectacular amounts, and 
you can even go without some of them for a period of time. I see this all the 
time in my practice. To be honest, after hearing about the diets of some 
people I’m surprised they’re still alive. (Nowhere is this more evident than in 
children with autism. I’ve treated some children who have eaten only chicken 
nuggets, cheese pizza, and sugary cereal for years.)
 
Denying your body the essential nutrients it must have to operate is a way of 
inflicting malnutrition on yourself. Think about that: If you’re not giving your 
body the right amounts of the right nutrients, you’re basically creating a prob-
lem for yourself that we spend billions of dollars to fight in developing coun-
tries every year. There’s really no excuse for it!
Over the next few pages, I tell you all about the most important nutrients 
for your body. I let you know a little about the roles these nutrients play in 
your system, and I provide a good look at some of the food sources you can 
include in your diet to make sure you’re getting what you need in the right 
amounts. Filling up your diet with key nutrients is just as important as rid-
ding it of toxins. (If you’re craving more information on how to keep toxins 
out of your food, flip back to Chapter 3 or ahead to Chapter 7.)
Eating the essentials
Your body needs certain substances that it can’t make on its own. You have 
to get these substances in the food you eat (or sometimes in the water you 

77
 Chapter 5: Taking the Detoxification Initiative: The Basics of Detoxing Your Body
drink) if you want to enjoy long-term health. Here’s a basic look at these 
substances:
 
✓ Essential amino acids: Amino acids are the building blocks that make 
protein. There are ten amino acids that we must have, and we can’t 
make them on our own. You can’t store amino acids in your body, so 
you have to get them in your diet every day.
 
✓ Essential fatty acids: These include omega-3 fatty acids and omega-6 
fatty acids.
 
✓ Minerals: Your body needs 16 minerals to operate at an optimal level. 
You can get all the minerals you need from vegetables and water, but 
only if you eat 100 percent organic. (Check out Chapter 7 for my thor-
ough explanation of organic foods.)
 
✓ Vitamins: We can’t make them, and we can’t live without them. There 
are 14 essential vitamins, and each one is unique. As with minerals, you 
can’t get all the vitamins you need from vegetables unless the vegetables 
you eat are all 100 percent organic.
To read about all of these substances and find out how you can make sure 
you’re getting them in your diet, flip ahead to Chapter 17.
Eating colors for antioxidants
The next time you’re in the produce section of a grocery store, take a second 
to stand back and look at all the colors. Fruits and vegetables seem to be 
painted from a lush, comprehensive palette that ranges from deep, rich 
greens to eye-popping bright yellows.
 
You can use the colors of fruits and vegetables to help guide your dietary 
levels of antioxidants, which is another extremely important component for 
your diet.
Antioxidants are substances that help to cut down on oxidation — a process 
that occurs normally in the body but can run rampant and damage your 
body’s cells (especially in the presence of toxins). Antioxidants help keep oxi-
dation under control, and an overwhelming amount of research shows that 
including plenty of antioxidants in your diet will make you healthier across 
the board.
Join me for the following look at the rainbow of fruit and vegetable options 
and the antioxidants that you can find in each color.

78
Part II: Working toward a Detoxified Life: Getting Started 
Red
Plenty of red fruits and vegetables are available, and many can provide you 
with wonderfully healthy antioxidants. Take red kidney beans, for example. 
They’re loaded with antioxidants! Red kidney beans have antioxidant levels 
that are as high as or higher than many berries that are commonly regarded 
as antioxidant powerhouses. Of course, that doesn’t mean that you should 
skip red berries and other red fruits; raspberries, cherries, red apples, and 
strawberries are excellent sources of antioxidants, too.
Red tomatoes have a specific kind of antioxidant that is particularly impor-
tant for men. You can find abundant amounts of lycopene in tomatoes, and 
lycopene has been shown to contribute to the health of the prostate gland. 
That doesn’t mean that women should discount the health benefits of eating 
tomatoes, of course — just that men should keep it in mind when deciding 
whether or not to put a slice of tomato on their sandwiches or add another 
spoonful of sauce to their pasta.
Here’s one other specific antioxidant that you can find in red fruits: resvera-
trol. Resveratrol has been shown to decrease the growth of cancer cells, help 
nerve cells stay healthy in diabetics, and also decrease heart disease by help-
ing to maintain blood vessels. You can find resveratrol in red grape skins and 
also in red wine.
Blue and purple
Fresh vegetables and fruits that are blue or purple may not be as common as 
those in shades of green or red, but a few blue and purple foods can provide 
you with some terrific antioxidant benefits.
Start with plums and their dried counterparts, prunes. Both make great 
snacks, and they’re packed with antioxidants. You can also go for blackber-
ries; they’re a little tough to find out of season, but when they’re available try 
to mix them into your diet for an antioxidant boost.
The king of the antioxidant-rich blue foods is the blueberry. You often hear 
blueberries referred to as one of the “superfoods,” and that’s not just clever 
marketing. Blueberries are chock-full of beneficial antioxidants, and they also 
contain many of the vitamins you need to stay healthy. Load up on blueber-
ries when you can, and keep in mind that the darker the blueberry, the more 
healthy materials you can find inside.
On the vegetable side of things, try eggplant for a blue or purple food that 
can provide you with an antioxidant kick.
Orange
Orange (and yellow) members of the fruit and vegetable groups are famous 
for containing beta-carotene, an antioxidant that is thought to help protect 

79
 Chapter 5: Taking the Detoxification Initiative: The Basics of Detoxing Your Body
against eye disease and some forms of cancer. If you’re looking to give your 
beta-carotene levels a boost, try orange foods like carrots, pumpkin, and 
winter squash. Orange and yellow fruits that contain ample antioxidants 
include nectarines, oranges, lemons, peaches, and grapefruit.
Green
Green vegetables make up a big part of the produce section, and they should 
also make up a substantial part of your diet. From peas to turnip greens to 
Brussels sprouts and even sea vegetables like kelp, green vegetables help you 
give your body all sorts of healthy substances, antioxidants included.
I want to give special treatment to broccoli, which packs an extremely healthy 
punch. Broccoli contains lots of sulforaphane, an antioxidant that has been 
receiving a lot of attention from researchers lately because it helps the body 
get rid of toxins, supports the immune system, and can even slow down tumors.
Eating raw
The preparation of your food — from processing to cooking — has an impact 
on its nutrition. Processing foods with chemicals has the most negative impact 
because those methods often add toxins and rarely (if ever) conserve impor-
tant nutrients. Applying heat to food is less damaging, but it can still break 
down some of the really beneficial substances. For these reasons, it’s useful 
to get plenty of raw foods in your diet, particularly plant foods like veg-
etables, fruits, and nuts. It’s really hard to beat fresh produce for nutritional 
value; there’s no better way to get essential nutrients than to load up on all 
the tasty things that don’t get fooled with much (if at all) on their route from 
the tree (or bush or vine or root) to your plate.
Some people go so far as to eat only raw foods, but that’s a practice that can 
be difficult for most of us to sustain. Chances are you currently cook your 
food and plan to continue doing so. With that in mind, I provide some simple 
analyses of a few cooking methods:
 
✓ Frying: Nothing good happens when you fry food (except the taste!). 
As you’d probably guess, pan frying is better than deep frying, which is 
really one of the worst things you can do to your food. Skip deep frying 
whenever possible.
 
✓ Pressure cooking: Antioxidant levels in most foods are reduced more 
through pressure cooking than through any other cooking method. If 
you’re eating specific foods for antioxidant value, be sure you’re not 
pressure cooking them or you’re shooting yourself in the foot.
 
✓ Boiling: Boiling food can be fine for short amounts of time, but boiling 
for extended periods can really decrease the nutrient value of many foods.

80
Part II: Working toward a Detoxified Life: Getting Started 
 
✓ Baking: Generally speaking, baking is a good way to cook food without 
compromising the nutritional value too much. It’s a problem only if you’re 
baking foods to the point where they’re mushy; if that happens, you know 
you’ve lost at least some of the nutrients.
 
✓ Steaming: I’m a big proponent of steaming, particularly for vegetables. 
It’s easy, quick, delicious, and helps to maintain most of the nutritive 
value of vegetables.
 
Some fans of raw food diets insist that all vegetables and fruits are better raw 
than any other way, but that isn’t completely true. The nutrients in some foods 
are actually enhanced through cooking. One example is the lycopene (an anti-
oxidant) found in tomatoes. A recent study showed that one type of lycopene 
in tomatoes actually increases 35 percent when the tomatoes are cooked for 30 
minutes at 190 degrees Fahrenheit. Another study showed that the antioxidant 
beta-carotene increases when carrots are cooked. Other examples include 
spinach, mushrooms, asparagus, cabbage, peppers, and many other vegeta-
bles, which also provide more antioxidants when cooked.
There’s always a trade-off, of course, and in this case it’s vitamin C. Most 
types of cooking break down vitamin C, so while you’re cooking some of 
these vegetables to increase their antioxidant levels, chances are you’re 
decreasing the amount of vitamin C you’ll get from them. However, it’s pretty 
easy to get vitamin C in your diet by eating fresh fruits, so in this case you’re 
probably just fine doing a little cooking to up the antioxidant ante.
Avoiding ingredients you can’t pronounce
If you want a nearly foolproof way to make sure you’re getting what you need 
and avoiding what can harm you in food, stick to this simple rule: If you can’t 
pronounce an ingredient in the food, don’t eat it. I know that sounds remark-
ably simplistic, but for the most part it really does work. Foods that contain 
bizarre ingredients with huge names and pronunciations that only a chemist 
could love don’t have any place on our plates.
This rule is a no-brainer when it comes to fresh foods like fruits and vegetables.
Produce doesn’t have ingredient lists, but if it did you wouldn’t have any 
problem pronouncing all the words. Lettuce. Carrots. Apples. Spinach. Easy 
enough, right? But go a few aisles over in your grocery store and take a look at 
the ingredient lists on the food that comes in boxes, pouches, and cans. You’ll 
see ingredients like butylated hydroxyanisole, potassium metabisulfite, and 
erythorbic acid. Huh? Can you pronounce those ingredients? Do you have any 
idea what they are? If you answer no to both questions, it’s safe to say that 
those chemicals don’t belong in your body. The fact is that you don’t need 
them to survive. So why would you eat them, when it’s just as easy to fill up 
your shopping cart with foods that contain things like rice, cabbage, broccoli, 
and cherries? Stick with the basics.

81
 Chapter 5: Taking the Detoxification Initiative: The Basics of Detoxing Your Body
Spicing up your life
One of the biggest knocks on eating a healthy diet is a lack of flavor. Some 
people think about eating healthy and immediately assume that if they fill 
their diets with nutrient-rich foods, they’ll look down at their dinner plates 
and see nothing more than a few kale leaves and chunks of celery.
 
In fact, the opposite is true. Healthy, nourishing diets — including detox 
diets — can and should include a wide variety of flavorful components, 
particularly spices and herbs. You can get a world of flavor and an excellent 
array of nutrients just by adding spices and herbs to your diet.
Spices are made from flowers, berries, bark, seeds, and roots, and herbs are 
usually plant leaves. Both are readily available, and both can be an integral 
part of a detoxification-focused diet.
Pound for pound, spices have more antioxidants than fruits or vegetables. 
The antioxidants you can find in spices are varied, and their contributions to 
your health can be substantial. To give you an idea of how impactful spices 
can be, a recent study showed that adding lemon balm and marjoram to a diet 
could increase antioxidant levels by 150 percent and 200 percent respectively.
You probably include some herbs and spices in your diet, but there’s always 
room for more. There’s no better way to improve the quality of your recipes 
and your health all at the same time! To help encourage you in that direction, 
I offer the following list of spices and herbs and some of their health benefits:
 
✓ Cayenne pepper: Contains capsaicin (a potent antioxidant), beta-carotene, 
and vitamins A and C.
 
✓ Cilantro: Contains potent antioxidants and can be useful in the removal 
of mercury from the body. Coriander is the seed of cilantro.
 
✓ Cinnamon: Acts as an antimicrobial, decreasing the growth of fungi and 
yeast. It also helps to prevent blood clots, and a recent study has shown 
it to help decrease blood sugar in diabetics.
 
✓ Cloves: Helps to reduce nausea, vomiting, indigestion, and stomach ulcers.
 
✓ Coriander: Offers strong antioxidant effects and contains vitamins A and C.
 
✓ Garlic: Includes potent antioxidants, decreases blood pressure and 
cholesterol, and has historically been used to prevent the common cold.
 
✓ Ginger: Provides antioxidants and can help decrease nausea, vomiting, 
and morning sickness. A truly dynamic spice, ginger is twice as effective 
as many common motion sickness drugs and can lessen the side effects 
of chemotherapy.

82
Part II: Working toward a Detoxified Life: Getting Started 
 
✓ Oregano: Provides four times the antioxidant activity of blueberries, 
which are a powerful source of antioxidants.
 
✓ Parsley: Contains strong antioxidants (including beta-carotene), folic 
acid, and vitamins A and C.
 
✓ Red chili powder: Includes capsaicin and has been used to help reduce 
inflammation, clear mucus, boost immunity, and decrease cholesterol.
 
✓ Saffron: Loaded with antioxidants and has been used to treat dysentery 
and improve eye health.
 
✓ Sage: Contains antioxidants and can generate anti-inflammatory effects.
This list is really just the beginning. Most herbs and spices offer some sort of 
health benefit, and hundreds of different varieties are available. You can use 
them to boost your health, detoxify, and spice up your meals all at the same 
time. Your imagination is your only limitation!
Embracing Exercise
For most of human history, exercise consumed a big part of our daily lives. 
We were physically active for much of the day just doing the work of staying 
alive. Only in the last 100 years or so have most people stopped doing daily 
vigorous exercise. And exercise isn’t the only thing we’ve stopped doing 
since the advent of twentieth-century technology. Until the 1950s and the 
development of air conditioning, most of the world’s population was used to 
spending all summer in a natural sauna, day and night.
 
Our bodies are built for physical activity; we simply can’t be healthy without 
exercise and sweating. Virtually every part of our body is dependent upon 
exercise to work at maximum efficiency, and any effort you make to detoxify 
your body is greatly enhanced if you make regular exercise part of your plan.
If you’re not exercising regularly, you need to start now. If you can get 30 
minutes of exercise each day, you’ll do wonders for your body. And don’t 
think that you need to be jogging steep mountain trails or pumping iron in 
an expensive gym to get a workout. For many people there’s no better exer-
cise than walking at a fast pace. Even if you’re not currently exercising, you 
should be able to walk briskly for a half hour, but it’s always a good idea to 
check with your doctor before starting an exercise regimen. Don’t be afraid 
to start out slowly and increase your speed gradually until you’re walking 
about 2 miles in 30 minutes. The important thing is to exercise regularly — 
daily is by far the best — so that it becomes a ritual instead of a chore.
 
If you want to sleep better at night, exercise in the early morning. Multiple 
studies have shown that early morning exercise helps keep our day–night 
cycle stable. Exercising in the morning gives you far more energy during the 
day and better sleep at night. Exercising in the evening tends to wake up your 

83
 Chapter 5: Taking the Detoxification Initiative: The Basics of Detoxing Your Body
body when it’s trying to prepare itself for sleep. If you think that your schedule, 
climate, or some other factor prevents you from exercising in the morning, 
take another look. You may just have to get up 30 minutes earlier, which is 
something that most of us can do in the interest of promoting long-term health.
If you dread the idea of getting started on even a simple exercise plan, try 
getting someone else involved to make things more enjoyable. Why not get 
your spouse or a good friend to walk with you? It’s a great way to spend time 
together, and you may be surprised what some sidewalk and a pair of com-
fortable shoes can do for a relationship or friendship.
Maximizing detox with your muscles
An obvious benefit of exercise is strengthening skeletal muscles, and going 
through a regular workout will inevitably improve your muscle strength and 
endurance. When you use your muscles regularly, they become more toned 
and utilize energy more efficiently. This means you can get more work done 
with less energy expended. Exercise also extends the length of time that a 
muscle can work without getting tired.
In addition, the following are other, less obvious benefits to working out that 
can help you use your muscles to maximize your detoxification efforts.
Revving your lymph system
One of the most important functions of exercise relates to stimulating your 
lymph system, which is a key body system for detoxification. You may not have 
ever heard about the lymph system. I bet you’ve heard about the circulatory 
system, right? That one involves your heart, arteries, and veins, and it cir-
culates blood throughout your body in a closed system (meaning the blood 
stays in your blood vessels). The lymph system is another body system for 
moving around liquid substances. It’s twice as large as the circulatory system 
and consists of tubes called lymph vessels. The lymph vessels are connected 
like limbs on a tree, and the small ends are open.
After your body’s tissues use the nutrients that are delivered by the blood in 
your circulatory system, the waste products — including many toxins that 
your body has to get rid of — are released and travel into the lymph system. 
Waste products move through larger and larger lymph vessels until they’re 
eventually dumped back into the circulatory system, which carries them to 
the liver and kidneys to be processed and later expelled from your body.
Your heart works as the pump for your circulatory system, but what’s the 
pump for the lymph system? There isn’t just one. The lymph system depends 
on contracting muscles and the movement of your lungs to move wastes 
through your system and eventually out of your body. The stronger and 
more active your muscles and lungs, the more activity your lymph system 

84
Part II: Working toward a Detoxified Life: Getting Started 
will enjoy and the more waste products you’ll clear out of your body. Taking 
time for regular exercise helps keep your lymph system in tip-top shape, and 
it goes a long way in helping you clear your body of toxins.
Muscling out blood sugar problems
Too much sugar in your body can have a variety of toxic effects. I know it can 
be a little hard to think of sugar as a toxin, but if you have doubts just ask 
someone who suffers from diabetes.
The control of blood sugar is another vital benefit of exercise. When you 
exercise, your muscles have an increased demand for energy, and they’re 
more than happy to take sugar directly out of your bloodstream to get the 
energy they need to keep moving. That process is a huge help in keeping 
your blood sugar under control, and it also helps to prevent diabetes. The 
problems caused by diabetes affect millions of people each year, and the 
cost to treat all those conditions is in the billions of dollars. Think about all 
the suffering we could prevent and the resources we could save if we all just 
made it a point to take a brisk walk for 30 minutes every day!
Working your heart, lungs, and brain
Exercising is an awfully important part of total body health, and some of 
the most crucial advantages of regular exercise affect your heart, lungs, and 
brain. (I think we can agree that these are three pretty useful body parts.)
Making your heart happy
The heart is a muscle, but it’s one that performs feats of stamina and longev-
ity that put most of your other muscles to shame. Like all muscles, it functions 
much better if it’s exercised regularly — preferably on a daily basis. You can 
exercise your heart muscle simply by engaging in a physical activity that 
makes it beat more actively than when you’re not doing anything physically 
active. The amount and intensity of that physical activity depends on your 
age. You can use your age to figure out your maximum heart rate (MHR), 
which you can therefore use to figure out how hard you need to work your 
heart muscle. Subtract your age from 220, and the result is your MHR in 
number of beats per minute.
You don’t want to exercise to the point where you’re raising your heart rate 
to your MHR and leaving it there, because doing so would be dangerous. You 
really want to shoot for various percentages of your MHR, ranging from 50 to 
60 percent (when you’re just getting started on an exercise regimen) up to 80 
percent of your MHR (when you’ve been exercising regularly for a few weeks 
and you’re trying to build endurance). If you can’t maintain 80 percent, try 
maintaining 60 percent and adding in a few short bursts that take your heart 

85
 Chapter 5: Taking the Detoxification Initiative: The Basics of Detoxing Your Body
rate up to 80 percent. (Keep in mind that these are just general figures, and 
your ideal heart rate may be quite different if you have medical problems.)
 
Don’t wait until you have heart trouble to begin an exercise program. Use 
exercise as a preventative measure, and you’ll keep your heart healthier 
and happier than you ever could with prescription drugs and surgeries — 
common treatments for patients with established heart conditions.
Letting your lungs breathe easier
Getting a regular dose of exercise keeps your heart pumping along happily, 
but it also helps you to build stronger lungs. During a session of physical 
activity, your lungs have to work harder to keep enough oxygen in your 
blood to fill the needs of all your moving muscles. That increases your lung 
capacity and contributes to making your breathing easier and more effective. 
It also has a positive effect on the muscles that you use to expand and con-
tract your lungs, which in turn increases endurance.
Boosting your brain function
And let’s not forget about how exercise can benefit your mind. Here’s what 
working out regularly can do for your brain:
 
✓ Grow new nerve cells.
 
✓ Improve mood and even help reverse depression.
 
✓ Release natural chemicals (called endorphins) that create a sense of 
euphoria and reduce pain.
 
✓ Improve cognitive function (especially in older people).
 
✓ Possibly prevent and treat Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases. (Some 
studies suggest this benefit, but at this point the evidence is inconclusive.)
Supporting Your Health 
with Supplements
Most of our diets are downright deplorable. Our food choices are often lousy, 
and even when people make good choices, the actual food items are of a poor 
quality. In the days before commercial food processing, a person’s usual intake 
of food was rich in vitamins, minerals, and essential fatty acids. The result 
was generally good health. But all the various methods for processing — from 
homogenization to radiation — have reduced a lot of our foods to nutrient-
depleted masses of empty calories and harmful fats.

86
Part II: Working toward a Detoxified Life: Getting Started 
 
I truly believe that you can’t be healthy in the Western world today without 
using supplements to increase your intake of vitamins, minerals, and essential 
fatty acids. Even if you eat only organic foods, you’re not likely to get the extra 
amounts of antioxidants that are necessary to fight off all the environmental 
toxins that assault us on a daily basis.
Not everyone in the medical community shares my love and support of sup-
plements. You’ll hear some doctors say that taking supplements just makes 
expensive urine because your body doesn’t absorb enough of the key ingredi-
ents to have an effect. I simply don’t agree.
The recommended daily allowance (RDA) for most vitamins is established by 
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and in most cases the recom-
mendations are absurdly low. The FDA tends to set RDAs at a level that helps 
you avoid certain diseases but doesn’t help you to improve your health much 
beyond that. For example, the FDA says that you need 90 milligrams of 
vitamin C per day, but that measly amount won’t do much for you beyond 
fighting off scurvy. Vitamin C can have wonderful effects on your health, but 
not in such paltry amounts. (I list my recommended dosages for all the neces-
sary vitamins in Chapter 17, if you’re interested. You can also flip to Chapter 22 to 
read about ten supplements that I recommend everyone take on a daily basis.)
In this section, I use a two-pronged approach to provide you with basic sup-
plement information: I let you know some general rules for selecting supple-
ments, and I clue you in on the ways in which you can avoid a few common 
supplement mistakes.
Selecting supplements smartly
If you’ve decided that you’re going to begin taking supplements regularly, it’s 
time to go to the store to pick out a supplement product. That sounds easy 
enough, but in most stores you find an intimidating wall of choices. It can be 
difficult to choose the right bottle of supplements among all those options. 
How can you know which supplements are good quality? What do you need 
to look for before buying? How can you tell, when you’re standing there in a 
store aisle, how a supplement is going to perform when it’s in your system? 
Let me help you sort through some of those questions.
 
The most expensive supplement you buy is the one that doesn’t contain any 
active ingredients. If all you’re buying is a glorified sugar pill, you can save a 
lot of money by just buying a bag of sugar! Be prepared to consider and analyze 
several options before making a supplement purchase.
Many supplement companies will tell you that their supplements are more 
effective because they’re administered as dissolvable tablets that you place 
under your tongue, as patches that you put on your skin, or even as rectal 

87
 Chapter 5: Taking the Detoxification Initiative: The Basics of Detoxing Your Body
suppositories. The truth is that a good oral supplement (with some legitimate 
studies that back its effectiveness) is the best option.
Looking for supplement certification
Vitamins and other supplements aren’t required to have any testing done before 
they’re sent out into the marketplace. No government entity sets industry-wide 
requirements that supplement makers have to meet. If a product does not 
contain as much of the substance as its label says, nothing prevents the 
manufacturer from selling it anyway. To be honest, in terms of initial obstacles, 
not much stops someone from bottling sugar pills and selling them as vitamin 
C. The whole operation can be backed up with a marketing plan, Web site, and 
multilevel sales scheme.
That said, some supplement manufacturers do conduct their own in-house 
tests to make sure their products are legit. The extent and frequency of the 
testing varies from company to company.
 
Make it a practice to check any potential supplement for confirmation that it 
was made in a GMP approved plant. The Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) 
regulations are specified by the FDA, and they cover the quality of the actual 
manufacturing processes by which supplements are made. To achieve the 
designation, a supplement maker pays a third-party testing firm to come into 
the plant where it makes supplements. That firm conducts a series of tests 
to make sure that the plant is operating in a clean, safe, and accurate way. If 
the testing firm’s results are within the guidelines set by the FDA, the supple-
ment maker’s plant becomes GMP approved. A supplement made in a GMP 
approved plant may not be perfect, but at least you know the product was 
made in a good environment.
Before I recommend any supplement, I confirm it was made in a GMP-certified 
facility. But I also go a step further. I make certain that the supplement com-
pany sends a portion of every lot of its product to an outside independent 
lab for assay (molecular analysis). The supplement company must allow me 
to contact the lab directly to confirm the test results on any particular lot of 
product. This testing will include making sure that the supplement dissolves 
in the stomach or intestines. Exceedingly few companies do these tests.
At the very least, take the following two steps before buying a supplement:
 
✓ Look for a seal from USP (United States Pharmacopeia) on the label. 
This designation indicates that the company has made some effort to be 
credible, but its testing is only random.
 
✓ Read the label carefully to make sure that the manufacturer, packer, and 
distributor have addresses in the United States. Some supplements are 
made in other countries — where manufacturing processes are even 
more of a crapshoot than they are in the United States. The supplements 
are then repackaged in the United States, and those products can be 

88
Part II: Working toward a Detoxified Life: Getting Started 
dangerous. Even if the supplement brand is familiar, take the time to 
confirm the addresses of its operations. Some of the best known and 
advertised names are the worst in quality.
Checking out supplement ingredient lists
Another key to supplement selection is making sure the ingredients that are 
combined in one product have a valid reason for being put into the same 
product. Some companies do their own research to validate the effectiveness 
of a particular combination of ingredients. An enormous amount of data is 
available on the effectiveness of vitamins, herbs, supplements, and minerals. 
If you’re going to spend your money on a product, make sure you know the 
scientific rationale for the combination of ingredients you’re getting.
 
When you find a company that does third-party testing before shipping and 
allows access to the outside lab directly, you can be assured that its products 
are well formulated and high quality. This type of quality company will also be 
more than glad to give you the research material to support its use of product 
combinations. Keep in mind that some of the best products are sold only 
through physician’s offices.
Avoiding potential supplement snags
Supplements are big business. Annual supplement sales are $23 billion, and 
about 40,000 supplement products are on the market. In an industry so large, 
it’s tough to avoid the occasional subpar or even harmful product. And, as I 
mention in the previous section, the supplement industry is loosely regulated 
at best. So you can imagine how many questionable products are floating 
around.
The biggest problem with supplements is that many of them don’t actually 
contain what the label claims. Depending on the estimate you choose to 
believe, as many as 70 percent of the supplements on the market either don’t 
have ingredients that match their labels or contain contaminants of some 
kind. The results can be disastrous: Recently, more than 200 people were 
sickened when a selenium supplement had 200 times the amount of selenium 
indicated on the label, for example.
Cases of spiked supplements have also occurred. Not long ago the FDA had 
to get involved in a situation in which a questionable supplement manufac-
turer had been adding a drug similar to the powerful male erectile dysfunc-
tion medicine to its supposedly all-natural dietary supplement.

89
 Chapter 5: Taking the Detoxification Initiative: The Basics of Detoxing Your Body
With all the potential pitfalls, how do you separate the wheat from the chaff? 
You need to do some legwork. Here are some pointers:
 
✓ If a product claims to guarantee results and help to alleviate all 
sorts of ailments from headaches to hemorrhoids, save your money. 
Reputable sources that produce high quality supplements know better 
than to advertise that way.
 
✓ Look for supplements that are derived from food sources whenever 
possible. Synthetic production often eliminates the natural mix of sub-
stances present in the natural food source, making them less beneficial 
and sometimes of no benefit at all.
 
✓ Request analyses from the companies that make the supplements 
you’re considering. The best manufacturers have a litany of evidence to 
support their claims and verify the integrity of their products, and some 
of them will provide that information upon request. Don’t hesitate to 
call or e-mail a supplement maker to ask for detailed information about 
its products. (You can usually find all the contact information on a com-
pany’s Web site.) Above all, do not accept lab analyses that companies 
perform in their own labs.
While these suggestions apply to any supplements, you should also be aware 
of problems specific to certain types of supplements, which I cover next.
Minerals
 
The big problem with some mineral supplements is that they’re not easily 
absorbed. To confirm that the minerals you’re buying will actually end up 
in your body and not in your toilet, look for chelated minerals. Chelating is a 
somewhat complicated chemical process, and I won’t bog you down with the 
details. The take-home point is that chelated minerals are much more likely 
to be absorbed by your body than minerals that haven’t been put through the 
process. The process is patented, and you can spot it easily by looking for the 
company name Albion on the supplement’s label.
You should also be aware of one other mineral-specific concern. In addition 
to the active mineral ingredient, some mineral supplements include other 
substances, including — believe it or not — toxins. What’s even harder to 
fathom is that mineral products that contain these types of materials often 
list them as ingredients on their labels. Many mineral products are simply 
ground-up clay. So keep your eyes out for minerals that list lead, silver, anti-
mony, or tin as ingredients! (Yes, I’m serious.)

Probiotics
Probiotics are supplements containing live bacteria that are taken to boost 
the amount of beneficial bacteria living in your body (the good bacteria living 
in your intestines). Here are two common problems with probiotics:
 
✓ Live bacteria levels: Some probiotics don’t have as much live bacteria 
in them as the label states. A study of 50 products taken from health 
food store shelves showed that the most any product contained was 5 
percent of the live bacteria the label stated.
 
✓ Stray bacteria: The same study found that 8 out of 50 probiotic supple-
ments tested contained harmful bacteria in addition to the good bacteria 
advertised on the label.
To dodge these problems, do what you’d do for any supplement: Request 
some third-party analysis from the supplement company.
Herbs
Because herb supplements are derived from plants, sometimes they contain 
nasty things like mold, bacteria, heavy metals, and pesticides. This disturbing 
trend will probably continue as some herb supplement manufacturers aim to 
cut costs and look overseas for raw materials. Reliable supplement makers 
test all incoming herbs and reject contaminated shipments, and the purity 
that results is obvious in the reports that they will send you upon request.
Vitamins
Vitamins are perhaps the most commonly used supplements, and I wish I 
could report that their widespread use means you won’t find problems with 
the many different vitamins on the market. But that’s simply not the case. 
Like the other supplements I discuss in this chapter, vitamins can sometimes 
fail to meet label claims. All too often a vitamin maker cuts the amount of 
vitamin material that’s included in each pill without changing the label; 
recent independent lab analysis confirms that this has been and is currently 
a significant problem.
I apologize if I’m starting to sound like a broken record, but if you want to 
make sure your vitamins contain what their labels swear they contain, be sure 
to contact the manufacturer for some documentation to support those claims.
Omega-3 fatty acids
Here’s one more supplement problem to be aware of before I wrap up this 
discussion: Supplements that contain omega-3 fatty acids usually come in 
fish oil products like liquids or softgel capsules, and because these things 
are fish-based they’re prone to mercury contamination. I can’t imagine that 
you would want to take a dose of mercury — a deadly toxin — with your fish 

91
 Chapter 5: Taking the Detoxification Initiative: The Basics of Detoxing Your Body
oil supplement, so be sure to buy fish oil products that have been distilled. 
Distillation does an excellent job of removing all the mercury.
 
If you’re considering taking a fish oil supplement to up the amount of omega-3 
fatty acids in your system, be sure to contact the supplement company first 
to ask it for analysis that confirms its fish oil doesn’t contain anisidine, DDT, 
dieldrin, or PCBs. These are all toxins, and all have been found in fish oil supple-
ments in recent years.
Changing Intestinal Flora: 
Gut Check Time
How often do you think about your bowels? Chances are you really consider 
what your bowels are doing only when something is wrong with them — when 
you have constipation, diarrhea, or some kind of pain. That’s not enough! 
You need to put some thought into what’s going on in your intestines, because 
the condition of those parts of your body — and what’s living inside them — 
can have a tremendous impact on your total health, from ensuring good 
nutrition to avoiding disease.
Less than a century ago, most people in the developed world did a much better 
job of keeping up with their bowels than we do today. Getting a colon cleanse 
used to be an annual ritual for much of the population, but the practice fell 
out of favor by the mid-twentieth century. The timing couldn’t have been 
worse, as the advent of processed food was on the horizon and world travel 
was starting to become a possibility for more people. (Both trends have 
caused major problems for millions of intestines.) Colon cleanses went the 
way of the dodo just when we really needed to keep up with them.
In this section, I first explore what lives inside your gut — both the good and 
the bad. Then I explain how to get tests done that reveal what’s going on 
inside your intestines. Finally, I walk you through the process of cleaning out 
the bad elements and boosting the good.
Checking out what’s living inside you
The bacteria living in your intestines outnumber the cells in your body. Billions 
of organisms are living in your intestines, many of which play a key role in 
boosting your health, from nutrition to your immune system. Some of them 
can also play a role in damaging your health in nasty and painful ways. You 
should definitely understand the various things that live in your gut, so read 
on to explore the details. I can’t fill you in on all the varieties, so I’ve lumped 
them into two very broad groups: the good and the bad.

92
Part II: Working toward a Detoxified Life: Getting Started 
The good
The good types of organisms that live in your intestines are beneficial bac-
teria that break down your food so the nutrients are more easily absorbed. 
Good bacteria also make vitamins for you, including B12 and K. As if that 
weren’t enough, they stimulate your immune system (in a good way) and 
help protect you from disease. When good bacteria are present in the right 
amounts in your intestines, it’s very difficult for harmful bacteria and yeast 
(which can damage your body) to survive. The most common types of good 
bacteria in the human intestine are Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus.
 
To help boost the amounts of good bacteria that you have living in your gut, 
you can eat plain yogurt with active bacterial cultures. You can also take bac-
teria in supplement form (called probiotics — read more earlier in this chap-
ter), but you really have to do your homework on the supplement quality to 
make sure you’re getting good value for your money.
 
Good bacteria are very sensitive to the antibiotics administered when people 
get sick. Approximately 80 percent of good bacteria are killed when you take 
a single round of antibiotics! After the good bacteria are gone, it’s easier for 
harmful bacteria and yeast to multiply. That’s why diarrhea and vaginal yeast 
infections are common after someone takes a round of antibiotics — yet 
another reason to use antibiotics only when absolutely necessary.
The bad
The organisms that you can regard as bad when they’re in your intestines 
include harmful bacteria, yeast, and parasites. Bad bacteria commonly create 
byproduct gases, and they can cause inflammation and excessive, foul bowel 
gas. They also cause stress on your immune system, and they can give you 
chronic intestinal problems.
Antibiotics kill the good bacteria in your intestines and allow the bad bacte-
ria to multiply rapidly. After the bad bacteria multiply, they can easily cause 
trouble in your intestines. The symptoms of these ailments can persist for 
years after just a single round of antibiotics. The effects aren’t always localized, 
either — some types of bad bacteria release toxins that can be absorbed in 
your bloodstream and damage distant organs, including the brain.
You also usually have a small amount of yeast in your intestines. Just like the 
harmful bacteria, the yeast is kept in check when the good bacteria are pres-
ent in the right amounts. Good bacteria also help to thwart parasites, many 
of which love the intestines and can wreak all sorts of havoc on your body. 
For more details on the problems that yeast and parasites can cause, flip 
back to Chapter 2.
 
With its extremely high acid levels, your stomach also helps to control the 
amount of harmful bacteria, yeast, and parasites that end up in your bowels. If 
you overuse acid reducers, the stomach loses its acidity, making it easier for 
these damaging organisms to pass through to the intestines.

93
 Chapter 5: Taking the Detoxification Initiative: The Basics of Detoxing Your Body
Considering useful tests
You can have two types of tests done to help determine what types of crit-
ters are living in your intestines: stool tests and urine tests. Both tests need 
to be administered by professionals, so if you’re interested you need to con-
sult your doctor to get the process started. Both tests can be pretty expen-
sive, so be prepared.
Stool tests involve providing a stool sample, which is sent to a lab that examines 
parts of the sample under a microscope and also runs some chemical tests 
to find out what is present in your stool. The test is relatively easy, although 
you may have to stop taking some medications a couple weeks beforehand. 
(Your doctor will fill you in on those details.)
The process for urine tests is similar: You simply provide a urine sample, which 
is sent off to a lab for analysis. It’s not possible to actually see what’s in your 
intestines by looking at your urine, of course. But labs can run chemical tests on 
the sample that reveal the presence of byproducts of certain types of bacteria, 
yeasts, and parasites that commonly set up shop in your intestines and release 
chemicals that enter your bloodstream and eventually end up in your urine.
Cleansing your bowels
I’m a big proponent of colon cleanses, and I suggest that doing a cleanse once 
a year is an excellent practice to help you rid your body of abnormal flora 
and put you on the path to better health.
If you’re starting a detox diet or any other detox program, you need to see 
to it that your intestines are healthy and have the right amounts of the right 
bacteria living inside them. Doing so involves removing the bad bacteria, 
yeast, and parasites; eating food and supplements that help your intestines 
to heal; and replacing the good bacteria. You usually need to take some 
prescription medications, but they’re very easy on the body. It often takes a 
month to get the intestines back in optimal condition.
 
To do your bowel cleanse, first find some good intestinal detox supplements. 
A supplement maker you rely on for quality products should have some in 
its product line. (See my discussion on choosing supplements earlier in this 
chapter.) Look for a product that includes wormwood, black walnut hulls, 
garlic, and pumpkin seeds. I also recommend adding in some clove supple-
ments and a Vermox prescription because both are good for killing off para-
site eggs. You should usually take such a supplement for a month in order to 
kill off the majority of the organisms that live in your bowels.
At the same time, you need to take a product that kills yeast cells. That supple-
ment usually contains barberry, grapefruit seed extract, lavender, and other 

94
Part II: Working toward a Detoxified Life: Getting Started 
herbs. I usually add a prescription drug — either Diflucan or Nystatin — to aug-
ment the yeast-killing process. It generally takes about three weeks to rid your 
intestines of harmful yeast cells.
After you’ve taken a round of supplements and perhaps prescription medica-
tions to kill off the harmful bacteria, yeast, and parasites in your intestines, it’s 
time to start building up your intestinal health and adding back in the good bac-
teria. Do that by eating a diet that’s rich in the foods I describe in Chapter 7, and 
be sure to include lots of bacteria-containing yogurt and probiotic supplements.
 
If you and your doctor conclude that you’re suffering from irritable bowel syn-
drome (IBS), you should strongly consider doing a colon cleanse. In my prac-
tice, I’ve found that a significant number of patients with IBS have complete 
relief of symptoms after doing the complete bowel detoxification that I 
describe here.
Getting a Professional Check-up
For many of the ailments caused by toxins, you need a doctor or other health-
care professional to help you diagnose and in some cases treat the problem. If 
you want to make a concerted effort to detoxify your body and treat that effort 
as a top health priority, you need a doctor who understands and is sensitive to 
more than just the standard practices and beliefs of traditional medicine.
Deciding on a doctor is an intensely personal and important choice, so if 
you’re looking for a doctor or considering whether to stick with the one you 
currently use, be sure you’re as honest with yourself as possible. If you want 
to consider solutions that fall outside the range of traditional medicine, you 
need to feel confident that your doctor will hear you out and be willing to 
work with you. Few things in life are more important than your health, and 
it’s critical that you find someone who will work toward bettering your health 
without dismissing your input or forcing an agenda on you.
Finding an open-minded doctor
If you want to pursue natural healing, supplementation, or any other form of 
integrative or alternative self care, you may very well end up butting heads 
with your doctor. Many doctors aren’t as receptive to these ideas as they 
should be, but you can rest assured that it’s not totally their fault. Physicians 
today are overwhelmed by the influence of pharmaceutical companies. Every 
medical journal I receive is paid for by drug companies. Every speaker at 
every traditional medical seminar at the local, state, and national level is paid 

95
 Chapter 5: Taking the Detoxification Initiative: The Basics of Detoxing Your Body
for by drug companies. Every representative who comes in my office is paid for 
by a drug company. It isn’t in a drug company’s best interest for physicians to 
recommend solutions for their patients that don’t involve prescription drugs, 
and they bombard doctors with information and propaganda accordingly. That 
situation can make it extremely hard for you to find a doctor who is open to 
alternative options.
But there’s good news, as well, in the form of an ever-growing group of physi-
cians who consider a wide range of disease treatments and health enhancements 
that go beyond taking a prescription medication.
 
Two good resources exist for finding open-minded physicians who are keen 
on considering nontraditional solutions to medical problems: the American 
College for Advancement in Medicine (www.acam.org) and the International 
College of Integrative Medicine (www.icimed.com). I strongly recommend 
visiting their Web sites for a wide range of information on integrative medicine 
and for physician lists that will help you find an integrative doctor in your area.
 
Integrative medicine is a concept of medicine using natural treatments when 
possible but using medication and traditional therapies when necessary. This 
approach is also called complementary medicine. Alternative practitioners 
(discussed in the next section) are usually not licensed to use traditional med-
ical therapies and therefore use only alternative therapies.
Seeking out an alternative practitioner
Alternative practitioners are healthcare professionals who specialize in medi-
cine that doesn’t necessarily fall within the range of what is currently regarded 
as “conventional.” They can be of great help in detoxing and seeking out good 
health. These types of professionals include chiropractors, naturopaths, and 
acupuncturists, and they also include some medical doctors (MDs) and doc-
tors of osteopathic medicine (DOs).
 
MDs and DOs have the benefit of access to traditional medical treatments 
and prescriptions, which may be required at times. (Keep in mind that not all 
traditional medicine is bad!) For the best medical care, find an MD or DO who 
combines traditional medicine with an integrative approach. A doctor who 
uses natural therapies when possible but also calls upon traditional medicine 
when necessary is an excellent option.
MDs and DOs have equal medical privileges and very similar training. DOs 
receive training in manual medicine that MDs don’t receive. Manual medicine 
involves working directly with muscles to improve function or reduce pain. 

96
Part II: Working toward a Detoxified Life: Getting Started 
Another difference is that about 80 percent of DOs are primary care doctors 
and 20 percent are specialists. MDs typically have the opposite split.
A naturopath is a professional who uses natural and physical tools to treat 
various conditions. Naturopaths are alternative practitioners, and they’re a 
varied group that includes acupuncturists and chiropractors as well as a host 
of practitioners who don’t have standardized training. Some alternative prac-
titioners may have limited formal training but are still very talented in their 
particular field. Be careful, though, because some of these folks can practice 
bogus medicine (see the next section for details).
 
Your selection process for your alternative practitioner should be rigorous. Be 
sure to check credentials, years of experience, and word of mouth references, 
and also set up an initial interview to make sure you’re comfortable with your 
choice before beginning any medical evaluation or treatment.
Keeping an eye out for bogus medicine
It’s sad but true that a number of people claim to be practitioners of alter-
native medicine who don’t offer much useful treatment or analysis at all. 
Put simply, there’s some bogus medicine out there, and you need to keep 
that fact in mind to avoid getting burned and putting your health (and your 
money) at risk.
Here are a few key questions to ask yourself when considering an alternative 
practitioner:
 
✓ Do any state laws govern this profession?
 
✓ Are standardized training and tests required to gain credentials?
 
✓ Do any local, state, or national organizations exist for this practitioner’s 
type of medicine? If so, is the practitioner in good stead with the 
organizations?
 
✓ Does the practitioner have reliable word of mouth support?
 
✓ Has the practitioner moved around frequently? If so, does he or she 
have a good reason for those moves?

Chapter 6
Recognizing Toxin-filled and 
Otherwise Unhealthy Foods
In This Chapter
▶ Getting a feel for genetically modified foods
▶ Growing food without toxic influences
▶ Avoiding unhealthy processed food
T
he foods that are available on most grocery store shelves are often 
loaded with toxins, or they’re made using toxic processes, or both. It’s 
tough to eliminate the toxin-containing food from your pantry and refrigera-
tor, but if you’re going to get serious about detoxification and detox dieting, 
you have to take that step.
To begin cutting out toxin-filled foods, you first need to be able to recognize 
them. That’s the aim of this chapter: to show you how to spot toxic foods. 
I start with a look at genetically modified foods, give you a few tips for how 
you can grow some of your own toxin-free foods, and call your attention to 
several types of processed foods that you may not realize pose a toxic threat.
Being Wary of Genetically 
Modified (GM) Foods
I touch on the prevalence and potential threat of genetically modified foods 
in Chapter 3, but there’s much more to the story. I provide you with a lot 
more detail in this section. Foods that have been genetically modified — often 
called GM foods — include plants and animals with genes that scientists have 
played with, usually with the goal of increasing food production.

98
Part II: Working toward a Detoxified Life: Getting Started 
 
I want to make it clear that we’re not talking about selective breeding here. 
That process involves identifying positive traits in a couple of plants or animals 
of the same species and breeding them so that their offspring are likely to have 
those positive traits. The key phrase there is of the same species. In genetic 
modification, genes from lots of different species — from fish to insects to bac-
teria — are spliced together using biochemical processes in a lab.
In many cases the results sound appealing at first blush. Who wouldn’t want 
a tomato that stays ripe longer or corn that is less likely to get damaged by 
pillaging insects? The problem is that most foods created using genetic modi-
fication haven’t been around for very long, and it’s extremely difficult for 
even the savviest scientists to say what GM plants and animals will do to our 
environment — and, perhaps more importantly, to our bodies and health — 
in the long run. We may be creating and consuming foods that could damage 
ecosystems and harm our bodies in ways that haven’t been identified yet. 
Symptoms of these problems could take quite a while to surface, and when 
they do they may not initially be attributed to GM foods.
To better understand the impact of GM foods, consider what some people 
within the scientific community have said about the general process of 
genetic modification of food:
 
✓ In a recent public statement, the American Academy of Environmental 
Medicine (AAEM) called for “a moratorium on GM foods, long term inde-
pendent studies, and labeling.” The AAEM went on to say that “several 
animal studies indicate serious health risks associated with GM food, 
including infertility, immune problems, accelerated aging, insulin regula-
tion, and changes in the major organs and the gastrointestinal system.” 
The AAEM’s conclusion? That “there is more than a casual association 
between GM foods and adverse health effects. There is causation.”
 
✓ Pushpa A. Bhargava, a world-renowned biologist and former director of 
the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (one of the Indian govern-
ment’s top science departments), reviewed 600 scientific studies on GM 
foods and came to the conclusion that GM organisms are a major con-
tributor to the sharply deteriorating health of Americans.
 
✓ The British Medical Association, which represents more than 100,000 
physicians, has called for an outright banning of all GM foods and a 
requirement for labeling in countries where GM foods still exist.
Clearly, there’s cause for concern when it comes to GM foods. With the rest 
of this section my aim is to finish bringing you up to speed on GM food basics 
and to let you know how you can identify (and avoid, if you choose) GM food 
products.

 Chapter 6: Recognizing Toxin-filled and Otherwise Unhealthy Foods
Understanding GM food basics
I don’t want to overload you with too many details on how GM plants and 
animals are created in a lab. However, to help you figure out exactly what I’m 
talking about here, an example would be useful.
There’s a bacterium that lives in soil called Bacillus thuringiensis, and it 
produces a toxin that kills many of the insects that destroy food crops (corn, 
for example). You might say that the bacterium contains a kind of natural 
pesticide. At a certain point, some people familiar with genetic modification 
realized that they might be able to take the gene from that bacterium that 
helps to produce the natural pesticide and insert that gene into plants that 
are grown for food. The result would be a crop that produces the insect toxin 
on its own and is much more resistant to attacks from hungry insects. That’s 
just what happened; the corn you eat today was modified in this way.
You may wonder, What’s the problem? Corn that doesn’t get eaten up by insects 
in the field sounds like a good thing.
 
The problem is this: The toxin that is now being produced by the corn ends 
up in our bodies, and it’s difficult to say what effects that toxin could have on 
us in the long run. What’s even more troubling is that the genes that cause the 
corn to produce the toxin can be transferred to the good bacteria that live in 
your intestines, and those bacteria will continue to make the toxin for years.
And the potential problems don’t stop there. In many instances, GM foods 
have been shown to cause health problems, including the following:
 
✓ Genetic material from GM foods has been found in the brains of animals 
that have been fed those foods.
 
✓ Foreign proteins that end up in some GM foods can cause allergic reactions. 
For example, the United Kingdom saw a 50 percent jump in soy allergies 
after it started allowing GM soy products to be sold to consumers.
 
✓ A few years ago, a GM form of a supplement was released for public use 
without being tested. Before it was taken off the market, the product was 
linked to 37 deaths and 1,500 other reports of adverse affects.
I hope you’ll think hard about the impact that GM foods can have on you and 
your family, and consider trying to limit the amount of GM foods that end up 
in your diet.

Part II: Working toward a Detoxified Life: Getting Started 
Trying to identify GM foods
GM foods don’t necessarily look different from other foods, so it’s not always 
easy to tell which foods are GM and which aren’t when you’re shopping for 
food in the United States. That’s the exception, though — not the rule. In 
many countries (including all countries in the European Union), all GM food 
must be labeled to let consumers know that the food contains GM organisms.
 
When you’re trying to figure out which foods in your grocery store contain 
GM ingredients, it’s useful to know which plants and animals are most com-
monly modified. At the top of the list are corn and soybeans — two of the 
biggest sources of our calories in the United States. Recent estimates indicate 
that roughly 75 percent of the soybean crops and about one-third of the corn 
crops in the United States have been genetically modified. That’s an enormous 
amount of food! Both vegetables are used to make many different types of 
ingredients that show up in processed foods (ingredients like soybean oil and 
high fructose corn syrup, which you find on a huge variety of labels in the 
processed food aisles of your grocery store). Some researchers say that when 
you add up all the genetically modified foods and ingredients that are based 
on GM foods, about 75 percent of the food for sale in a run-of-the-mill grocery 
store in the United States is genetically modified.
The GM food blitz doesn’t stop at corn and soybeans. Several other crops 
are often tinkered with at the genetic level, including cotton and cotton seed 
oil (check your candy bars for that one), papaya, tomatoes, potatoes, canola, 
sugar cane, sugar beets, rice, alfalfa, squash, cantaloupe, and flax. That’s not 
an all-inclusive list by any means, because it’s very difficult to obtain informa-
tion on which crops are actually genetically modified. The regulations and 
review processes of genetic modification are sparse and lax at best.
And the problem isn’t limited to plants. The big genetic modification companies 
are now genetically modifying animals, too. To date, pigs, goats, fish, and cows 
have been genetically modified, and in the short term it doesn’t look like that 
trend is going to slow down. As is the case with GM plants, very few regulations 
or rules exist to limit the use of GM animals for food in the United States, so it 
can be extremely tough to tell what has been modified and what hasn’t.
So what is a health-conscious consumer to do when he’s faced with a grocery 
store full of foods that very well may have been tinkered with?
 
At this point in the United States, no requirements exist for labeling GM foods. 
The only surefire way to make sure you’re not buying or eating GM food prod-
ucts is to stick to foods that are labeled “100 percent organic.” That’s actually 
a good practice to follow whenever possible, and I cover all the ins and outs of 
eating organic in Chapter 7.
Many people are very concerned about genetic modification and the impact 
it will have on this and future generations. Right now, no studies exist to tell 

101
 Chapter 6: Recognizing Toxin-filled and Otherwise Unhealthy Foods
us what kinds of changes are likely to happen to us and our environment as 
a result of the GM revolution. But I encourage you to seek out new informa-
tion about GM foods so you can find out quickly when certain products are 
revealed to be dangerous, either for your health or for our environment.
Growing Food in a Toxic World
Even if the seeds used to grow many of our foods aren’t genetically modi-
fied, it’s still tough for them to sprout, grow, produce fruit, get harvested, 
and end up in our grocery stores without being poisoned with fertilizers and 
insecticides. These chemicals are very widely used, and it’s getting difficult 
to escape their influence on our food. The days of the small-time farmer and 
his attention to detail are almost gone. Today, large commercial farms with 
genetically modified seeds, fertilizers, and insecticides are the norm.
Because of these toxic influences, many Americans are trying to grow their 
own fruits and vegetables so they can be certain that the foods they’re eating 
don’t come with a built-in side of poison. I’m a doctor, not a master gardener, 
so I won’t try to tell you how you can turn your backyard (or even a few pots 
on your patio) into an organic vegetable or herb garden. But as an expert on 
toxins, what I can offer is an overview of the ways you can cut out the toxic 
fertilizers and insecticides that many people turn to when they endeavor to 
grow some of their own food.
 
If you’d like to read more about how to grow fruits, vegetables, and herbs in a 
truly organic way, check out Organic Gardening For Dummies by Ann Whitman, 
Suzanne DeJohn, and the National Gardening Association (Wiley). It contains 
loads of basic but extremely helpful information on how to set up and succeed 
with a toxin-free garden.
Focusing on fertilizer
Picking out a safe fertilizer can be a daunting task because much of what’s 
available now contains at least a few toxic ingredients. Making matters much 
worse are the labeling conventions for fertilizers. For instance, a product 
marketed and sold as a fertilizer is required to list only the plant nutrient 
ingredients that are included in the formula. The other ingredients — which 
can and often do include toxins — don’t have to be listed.
 
Fertilizer is usually sold as a mix, and the bags are prominently labeled with 
three numbers. A common example is “10-10-10.” This means that the fertil-
izer contains 10 percent nitrogen, 10 percent phosphorus, and 10 percent 
potassium. Here’s the obvious (yet unaddressed) question: What makes up 
the other 70 percent of the product? The truth is that the 70 percent can be 

102
Part II: Working toward a Detoxified Life: Getting Started 
anything from municipal sewage sludge to toxic waste. Some unethical fertil-
izer manufacturers even go so far as to label their products with the word 
“organic” when many of the non-nutrient ingredients are based on byproducts 
from water treatment facilities.
If you want to dodge all the possible toxic fertilizer pitfalls, do the following:
 
✓ Look for fertilizer that is labeled “100 percent organic.” That “100 percent” 
part is important because sometimes “organic” can be used by itself in 
inappropriate and misleading ways.
 
✓ Try fertilizers that come from animals. These can include blood or bone 
meal and manure.
 
✓ Look into mineral fertilizer options like Epsom salt and limestone.
Investigating insecticides
Generally speaking, insecticides are as loaded up with harmful toxins as any 
products on the market. Most of the bottles of insecticides in your hardware or 
home improvement store have enough toxic material to kill you pretty easily. 
(If you want to discover more about the threats posed by insecticides and see 
a breakdown of the three different levels of toxicity that are used to categorize 
these substances, flip back to Chapter 3.) Why does it make sense to spray 
these materials onto the plants that will produce food you plan to eat?
The good news is that lots of formulas for safe organic pesticides exist, and 
many good products are available at health food stores and on the Internet. 
Here are a few examples.
 
✓ Concentrated garlic rids plants of a multitude of damaging insects.
 
✓ Soap mixed with pyrethrum, an extract from the pyrethrum flower, thwarts 
a wide range of aphids, whiteflies, mites, and a number of other pests.
 
✓ A liquid or wax made from hot peppers wards off quite a few insect spe-
cies. You can even use hot sauce!
 
✓ You can make an effective fungicide at home by mixing baking soda with 
a little vegetable oil.
 
I strongly advise against using chemical, commercial pesticides. But if you do 
choose to use them, please do so sparingly. Make sure you’re working in well-
ventilated areas, and be sure to at least wash your hands (or, better yet, take a 
shower) when you’re finished. Be sure to also keep these materials in a safe 
place (away from children). And make certain that the containers are 
extremely well marked and identified as poison.

103
 Chapter 6: Recognizing Toxin-filled and Otherwise Unhealthy Foods
Working around Processed Foods
In Chapter 3, I provide quite a lot of information about processed food. Just 
about everything I cover there supports this statement: Don’t eat processed 
foods if you can help it. We were meant to eat fresh, healthful, simple foods — 
not brightly colored, shrinkwrapped mystery foods that are loaded up with 
high fructose corn syrup and other toxin-laden ingredients.
It usually isn’t too difficult to identify processed foods in your grocery store, 
and if you’re honest with yourself you probably know when you’re putting 
a potentially harmful processed food in your shopping cart. But if you need 
help, here’s a very simple and virtually universal rule for avoiding the pro-
cessed food aisles at the store:
 
When you’re grocery shopping, select most of what goes in your cart from the 
store’s perimeter aisles. The outer aisles are almost always where you find 
produce, fresh meat, and a lot of the other foods that haven’t been ruined by 
common food processing techniques.
You should be able to dodge most processed foods with just a little effort. 
However, some food processing methods can be harder to detect but still 
surprisingly dangerous to your health. I cover the top two here.
Keeping your hands off homogenized food
Many dairy products, including almost all the milk that you find in the aver-
age grocery store, have been homogenized. Homogenization is a process 
that involves forcing a liquid through a very fine filter at really remarkable 
pressures — sometimes as much as 4,000 pounds per square inch. (That’s 
more than a lot of pressure washers, which are used to clean caked-in and 
baked-on dirt from sidewalks, among other things.)
Milk is homogenized to keep the cream that it contains from separating when 
you leave it sitting in your refrigerator. (It’s done more for aesthetic reasons 
than anything else.) The problem is that the homogenization process alters 
the milk, making it less healthy for humans.
Multiple studies show an increase in cardiovascular disease among people 
who drink larger amounts of homogenized milk. Further examinations into 
these connections have been historically poorly funded, so we’re not exactly 
sure why homogenized milk may contribute to cardiovascular ailments. One
theory involves a substance called xanthine oxidase (XO), which is present
 in milk. XO in milk that hasn’t been homogenized isn’t absorbed in our 

104
Part II: Working toward a Detoxified Life: Getting Started 
intestines, but XO is absorbed when the milk has undergone homogenization. 
Elevated levels of XO in your blood have been implicated as a cause of 
damage to the blood vessels that can result in plaque development in the 
arteries, which can lead to blocked arteries and heart attacks.
 
If you’re wary of homogenized milk — and I think you should be — ask at your 
local health food store for milk that hasn’t been put through the homogeniza-
tion process. You can also find it through local dairies and farms, and some 
of them will even allow you to come and tour their facilities. That can be a 
good way to see what is done to the milk you may be consuming to make sure 
you’re seeing the udder truth when it comes to the safety of your milk.
Passing on pasteurization
The pasteurization process has been around for about 150 years, and it 
involves raising the temperature of a food or liquid to a very high level in 
the interest of killing off bacteria, parasites, and other dangerous organisms. 
That’s not necessarily a bad thing, of course, but a problem arises because 
heating food up to such extremely high temperatures can destroy many of 
the beneficial substances that may be present, like vitamins, nutrients, and 
enzymes. Pasteurization destroys plenty of dangerous critters, but it also 
limits the good stuff that your body needs to get out of the foods you eat.
These days, pasteurization is most commonly associated with milk. Almost 
all milk is pasteurized even though the process isn’t nearly as necessary now 
that milk farms and dairies are much cleaner and more sanitary than they used 
to be. Pasteurization ruins a lot of the good vitamins that milk can provide.
While milk is the most familiar pasteurized food, many others exist, including 
almonds, apple cider, beer, canned food, cheese, crabs, cream, eggs, fruit 
juice, honey, maple syrup, soy sauce, sports drinks, vinegar, water, and wine.
 
You’ll often see “Pasteurized” notes on the labels of food products that have 
been put through the pasteurization process. If you’re concerned that your 
food may have lower nutritional quality because it has been superheated, 
keep your eye out for that notation.

Deciding on the Best Foods for a 
Toxin-free Dinner Table
In This Chapter
▶ Figuring out the basic supplies you need for a detox diet
▶ Understanding your organic food options
▶ Including the right protein sources
▶ Getting the right kinds of carbohydrates
▶ Making the right decisions about fats
▶ Considering a few food options beyond the grocery store
O
ne of the greatest things about detoxifying your body and getting started 
on a detox diet — beside the fact that it can have a fantastic impact 
on your overall health — is that you don’t need to buy all sorts of expensive 
equipment, take a class, or read 15 books before getting started. (I do recom-
mend reading this book, of course, but I hope that’s not too difficult of a task!)
Detox diets can be simple and relatively easy if you understand the basics, 
and that’s what I give you in this chapter. If you’re in the right frame of mind 
and you’re willing to make the best choices about your food — both where 
you buy it and how you prepare it — you’ll soon be on your way to cutting 
toxins out of your diet and building a stronger, healthier body.
Gathering What You Need 
for a Detox Diet
Toxin-free, healthy food is the most important part of a detox diet, but it’s 
not the only part. In order to stay on a detoxified path, you need to have 
some specific equipment and a few cooking staples that are chosen with 
detoxification in mind. I’m not talking about loads of expensive gear and a 

106
Part II: Working toward a Detoxified Life: Getting Started 
pantry full of bizarre ingredients that you have to get flown in from some far-
away country. Most of what you need will be available locally, and you may 
already have several of the necessary items at home.
 
Make sure you don’t skip the critical preparation steps I explain in this sec-
tion. Neglecting them and moving straight on to focusing on the food you’ll 
incorporate in your detox diet can start you off on the wrong foot.
Buying the correct equipment
You can buy the most organic, toxin-free food in the world, but if you’re cooking 
it with the wrong equipment you’re shooting yourself in the foot. You need pots, 
pans, and other essential cooking gear that don’t add toxins to your meals.
 
To be certain you aren’t adding toxins to your food while you’re cooking it, 
invest in some good stainless steel pots, pans, and other cookware. Non-stick 
cookware, which is coated in a chemical that’s supposed to prevent food from 
sticking to the pot’s or pan’s surfaces, can leach toxins into your food over time.
You also need to consider the potential toxicity of the materials that you use 
to store and serve your food. If most of your dishes, plates, cups, and food 
storage containers are made of plastics, you could be inadvertently adding 
harmful toxins to your food over time. (My discussion of toxins like BPA and 
phthalates in food packaging from Chapter 3 is relevant here, so flip back and 
take a look if you want to know more.)
 
So what can you use to serve and store food if plastic is potentially harmful? 
Look for options made of glass, ceramic, or stainless steel. (Keep in mind that 
if you choose ceramic containers you need to confirm that they’re lead-free 
before buying and using.)
A juicy detoxification option
If you’re looking for a practical addition to your 
kitchen that will give you some flexibility in the 
way you prepare your detox diet foods, look no 
further than a juicer. The idea of drinking your 
fruits and vegetables has become more and 
more popular in recent years, which is really no 
surprise. Juice recipes that incorporate fruits 
from apples to apricots and vegetables from 
carrots to kale can be quick, easy ways to give 
your diet a healthy boost, and many of them are 
downright delicious.
Several effective, affordable juicers on the 
market are perfect for use at home. They range 
from under $100 for a basic model to well over 
$1,000 for a juicer with every last bell and whis-
tle, so do your research and let your budget be 
your guide.

107
 Chapter 7: Deciding on the Best Foods for a Toxin-free Dinner Table
Keeping the right supplies on hand
Every kitchen needs a few staple ingredients that serve as the basis of a wide 
range of recipes and meals. If you want to work toward making your kitchen 
an effective home base for a detoxification diet, you need to sort through the 
staples you have now, get rid of the potentially toxic ones, and bring in new 
ingredients that don’t pose a toxic threat. Here are a few of the basics:
 
✓ Flour: You need an all-purpose whole wheat or white flour. Shoot for 
100 percent organic. (Check out my discussion of the various levels of 
organic food in the next section of this chapter.)
 
✓ Corn meal: Make sure you get a 100 percent organic option.
 
 For dry ingredients like flour and corn meal, be sure to use glass con-
tainers for storage. You’ll likely have these ingredients on hand for a 
while, and you don’t want them to pick up toxins from plastic containers 
over time in your pantry.
 
✓ Butter: I can’t say that I recommend eating lots of butter on a daily 
basis, but it is better than a lot of the options. I definitely suggest using 
real butter rather than butter substitutes like margarine. Just make sure 
the butter is 100 percent organic.
 
✓ Cooking oil: I discuss your cooking oil options in detail a little later in 
this chapter, but generally speaking I recommend using coconut oil or 
olive oil for cooking whenever possible. Again, buy 100 percent organic 
if possible.
 
✓ Spices and herbs: If you’re at all concerned that a detox diet has to be a 
bland diet, banish that thought immediately. Some of the most flavorful 
ingredients in the world — spices and herbs — are an integral part of 
any healthy diet, especially one that shuns toxins and emphasizes good 
things like antioxidants. Stock up on spices and herbs, and flip back to 
Chapter 5 for a lengthy discussion about which ones you can choose for 
specific effects.
Going Organic
Organic foods are plants or animals that are grown or raised without toxins. 
That means they’re not sprayed with toxic pesticides, injected with antibiot-
ics or hormones, processed with toxic additives or processes, or packaged in 
toxic containers. Organic foods have become increasingly popular in recent 
years; sales of organic foods have increased by 20 percent in each of the last 
seven years. Overall, that trend is a very good thing because it means the 

108
Part II: Working toward a Detoxified Life: Getting Started 
public has begun to recognize the importance of cutting out toxic materials 
like pesticides and harsh chemical fertilizers from our food, as well as the 
need to limit our intake of genetically modified food.
I encourage you to eat organic foods whenever possible, although I need to 
explain several caveats before you start loading up your shopping cart.
First, several different categories of organic foods are available, so you need 
to be a real label hawk when examining organic options. Here’s the breakdown:
 
✓ Specific Ingredients are Organically Produced: This designation is 
nothing special because it can be used on a label for any product that 
has only one organic ingredient.
 
✓ Made with Organic Ingredients: Foods in this category have to contain 
only 70 percent organic ingredients. Needless to say, a lot of nasty stuff 
can exist in the remaining 30 percent. Don’t make the mistake of thinking 
foods with the Made with Organic Ingredients label are toxin-free.
 
✓ USDA Organic: This categorization can be confusing. In order to qualify 
for a USDA Organic label, a food must be made of 95 percent organically 
produced ingredients. The obvious question: What’s up with the other 
5 percent? Therein lies the problem. The non-organic 5 percent can 
contain all sorts of materials that don’t fit very well at all in a detox diet, 
including food colorings and animal intestines. Buying USDA Organic 
foods is generally a little better than buying foods that aren’t organic in 
any way, but it’s nothing to shout about.
 
✓ 100% Organic: This is the best of the best. The 100% Organic label is 
reserved for products that are wholly and completely organic. This 
means that you don’t have to worry about artificial fertilizers, pesticides, 
genetic modification, antibiotics, or sewer sludge fertilizer.
 
If you want to buy truly organic food, make sure you look for “100% Organic” 
on the label.
Making an effort to buy organic foods also usually means that you’ll be spending 
more money. Growing and raising organic food is typically more expensive 
than growing and raising mass-produced, conventional food. But if your budget 
allows you to go organic, rest assured that it’s money well spent. Eating 100 
percent organic foods will benefit your body in ways that no medication ever 
could. If you can’t afford to eat organic all the time, try to do so when you can.
 
When it comes to produce, the scale of healthiness goes like this (from healthi-
est to least healthy): fresh organic (100 percent), fresh, frozen organic, frozen, 
and at the very bottom processed or canned.

109
 Chapter 7: Deciding on the Best Foods for a Toxin-free Dinner Table
Planning Out Your Protein Source
In order to thrive your body needs amino acids, which are the building 
blocks of protein. Your body can make 12 amino acids on its own, but 8 other 
amino acids can’t be made by humans so you need to get them through the 
food you eat. These eight are called essential amino acids, and to get them 
you need to be certain that you’re including sources of protein in your diet, 
including your diet that focuses on detoxification. Many forms of protein are 
available to you, but not all of them are appealing to everyone.
Animal sources of protein such as meat, poultry, eggs, fish, milk, and cheese 
can provide all the amino acids that you require. If you’re vegetarian, you 
have to try just a little bit harder to make sure you’re giving your body what 
it needs to succeed, but with planning and attention to detail you should be 
fine. Allow me to tell you about the protein sources that fit in detoxification 
diets for meat eaters, vegans, and everyone in between.
Fleshing it out
If you eat meat, you should have no problem at all getting the essential amino 
acids your body needs. A diet that includes meat, poultry, milk, cheese, fish, 
and eggs is flush with amino acids. The problem is that these protein sources 
can also contain all kinds of toxins. So if you’re a meat eater, be sure to keep 
in mind the following toxic threats as you decide what meats to include in 
your meals.
 
As with produce, try to choose meats and dairy products that are labeled 
“100% Organic” if you want the highest quality foods with the lowest amount 
of toxins.
On the hoof
Beef is a powerhouse source for amino acids. You can get all the essential 
amino acids you need by eating beef. But much of the beef you find at the deli 
and in the cooler at your local grocery store contains a range of toxins — par-
ticularly antibiotics and hormones — and you need to be sure you’re shop-
ping smart in order to dodge those threats.
 
Most of the commercially available beef at the grocery store was raised in a 
feed lot environment, which is basically a mega farm for cows that keeps them 
cramped in very tight quarters and feeds them endlessly on grains, which 
aren’t part of a cow’s natural diet. These harsh conditions can result in larger 
cows that provide more beef, but because that environment is so unnatural 

110
Part II: Working toward a Detoxified Life: Getting Started 
and hard on the cows, they have to be given antibiotics and hormones to keep 
them alive and growing. The antibiotics and hormones given to cows have a 
toxic effect on the human body. Two of the most commonly used hormones 
are estradiol and zeranol. Estradiol is also a human female hormone, and it 
can have feminizing effects on both men and women. Zeranol is similar to the 
female hormone progesterone and can produce similar effects in humans, in 
addition to being suspected of increasing your risk for cancer. Many other 
substances are also given to feed lot cattle, and most of them wreak havoc on 
the human body.
 
If you eat beef, the best way to avoid these toxins is to eat only grass-fed beef. 
Cattle raised on grass — their natural diet — don’t have to be given hormones 
and antibiotics because they’re naturally healthy, and the conditions in which 
these cows are raised allows them to grow up healthy and full of nutrients 
that you can obtain when you eat them. Grass-fed beef contains higher levels 
of essential fatty acids, vitamins, and minerals, and lower levels of saturated 
(harmful) fat.
The rules are slightly different for pork. No hormones have been approved 
for use in pork production, so if you’re picking out pork you don’t need to 
worry about the presence of hormones in the meat. You do need to consider 
the use of antibiotics on your pork, though, so look for labels on pork products 
that say “no antibiotics added” when you’re shopping.
 
But here are the larger worries about pork: Fried pork puts off toxic chemicals. 
Bacon, for example, puts off 15 times as much toxin as beef. Also, worm cysts 
can be found in pork so you must cook the meat thoroughly. Bottom line: It’s 
best to leave pork on the grocery shelf.
Birds of a feather
You can get plenty of the amino acids you need from bird sources of pro-
tein like chicken, turkey, and duck. Turkey, for example, is a good source of 
protein that includes seven of the essential amino acids. One of those amino 
acids is tryptophan, a building block for serotonin, which is important for the 
onset of sleep. Many researchers indicate that the high levels of tryptophan 
in turkey are the reason so many people get drowsy after eating Thanksgiving 
dinner each year!
Chicken and duck are even stronger when it comes to essential amino acids; 
they have all eight and can be good sources of protein for your body. Other 
types of fowl like pheasant, quail, and dove are suspected to have similar levels 
of amino acids, but there’s not yet enough data for complete confirmation.

111
 Chapter 7: Deciding on the Best Foods for a Toxin-free Dinner Table
 
When you’re picking out bird sources of protein like chicken or turkey, make 
sure you select 100 percent organic products and preferably those labeled 
“free range” or “cage free.”
Out of the sea
Shellfish are a good source of protein but don’t provide all the essential 
amino acids. Different types of shellfish provide different amino acids, and 
I wouldn’t recommend trying to cobble them together to get the essential 
amino acids you need. (It’s much more efficient to get your amino acids from 
other meat or vegetable sources.)
Fish also don’t have all the essential amino acids, but they do contain some 
and they can be a very healthy addition to your diet for other reasons.
 
Both fish and shellfish contain omega-3 fatty acids, which are wonderful for 
your health. However, as I mention several times in this book, mercury toxic-
ity is a problem when it comes to eating fish, especially swordfish, shark, king 
mackerel, tile fish, and tuna. Be sure to read up and choose wisely.
Sticking with vegetarian varieties
Eating a vegetarian diet can be completely healthy, but it takes more effort 
and planning to eat no animal products and still bring key nutritional require-
ments into your body, particularly when it comes to essential amino acids. I 
do not recommend a vegetarian diet for most people because it’s so difficult 
to do right. I have seen many patients who have tried to be vegetarians and 
ended up in very poor health. Most food plants simply don’t contain all the 
essential amino acids. However, if you’re willing to mix and match, you can 
definitely get the job done (and you can cut down on your toxin intake while 
you’re at it).
Vegetarians fall into one of four broad categories:
 
✓ Vegans eat only plant-based foods. They don’t eat dairy foods, poultry, 
eggs, or meat from any animal or fish.
 
✓ Lacto-vegetarians consume some dairy products as well as plant-based 
foods.
 
✓ Lacto-ovo vegetarians eat plant-based foods, dairy products, and eggs.
 
✓ Flexitarians eat mostly plants, dairy products, and eggs but occasionally 
have small amounts of fish or poultry.

If you’re a vegetarian or if you’re considering making the jump to a vegetarian 
diet, you need to make sure you’re getting plenty of essential amino acids. 
Here, I tell you how to go about doing just that while still keeping an eye out 
for potential toxic influences.
Accumulating amino acids
To get all your essential amino acids from plant-based foods, you need to 
broaden your diet horizons and be open to the idea of mixing and matching.
 
If you’re trying to cobble together the right plant-based foods in a vegetarian 
diet to make sure you’re bringing in all your essential amino acids, start by 
including plenty of legumes in your meals. Legumes provide a range of amino 
acids, and they’re readily available. What’s more, you can very likely find 
legumes with that gold standard “100% Organic” label, so you can get your 
amino acids and stiff-arm the toxins that could otherwise be left over from the 
use of pesticides and fertilizers on your legumes. Here are a few examples of 
amino acid–heavy legumes and how you may incorporate them in your diet:
 
✓ Adzuki beans: Also known as red oriental beans. Try them in rice dishes.
 
✓ Anasazi beans: Make good refried beans, or you can use them in soups.
 
✓ Black beans: Go great with rice, soups, stews, and any Mexican dishes 
you prepare.
 
✓ Black-eyed peas: Good in salads, casseroles, and fritters, or served with 
ham and rice.
 
✓ Chickpeas: Also known as garbanzo beans. They’re the key ingredient in 
hummus.
 
✓ Edamame: Green soybeans that work wonderfully as side dishes 
(particularly with Oriental cuisine).
 
✓ Fava beans: A nice side dish (and of course they go great with a nice 
Chianti).
 
✓ Lentils: Another extremely versatile legume. Use them in soups, salads, 
and stews.
 
✓ Lima beans: Also known as butter beans. They’re a great addition to 
healthy casseroles, soups, and salads.
 
✓ Red kidney beans: One of the most dynamic legumes out there. What 
would chili or mixed bean salad be without red kidney beans?
 
✓ Soy nuts: Also called soybean seeds. They work well as a stand-alone 
snack or as a topper for salads.
 
In addition to providing essential amino acids, legumes also give you important 
nutritional musts like folic acid, potassium, iron, and magnesium. You can also 
count on them for a healthy dose of natural fiber!

Luckily, the vegetarian options for including protein in your diet don’t end at 
legumes. There are also some notable and wonderful exceptions to the pro-
tein limitations of most grains. These make a terrific option for vegetarians 
and also represent a healthy protein source for non-vegetarians:
 
✓ Buckwheat: Despite its name, this grain-like crop isn’t related to wheat 
and doesn’t have anything to do with the Little Rascals. It also doesn’t 
contain any gluten, which can be very helpful for people with gluten 
allergies. Buckwheat is great because it contains all the essential amino 
acids — even the ones that contain sulfur, which most plant sources of 
protein don’t have.
 
✓ Quinoa: Pronounced KEEN-wah, this unique plant isn’t a cereal, and it 
isn’t a grass. However, it is gluten-free and contains all the essential amino 
acids and omega-3 fatty acids required for humans. A true nutritional pow-
erhouse, quinoa is also loaded with other vitamins and nutrients.
 
✓ Hemp seed: Two basic types of hemp plants exist. One is the kind that 
produces the plant materials used to smoke marijuana. The other is an 
excellent food source, and it provides the healthful hemp seed. Hemp 
seed contains all the essential amino acids, as well as all the essential 
fatty acids and omega-3s. You can do all sorts of tasty things with the 
seeds, including grinding them into a meal (for use in baking), eating 
them whole, steeping them in a tea, and pressing them to create hemp 
seed oil. Just like buckwheat and quinoa, hemp seed is gluten-free and 
packed full of minerals and nutrients.
 
Hemp seed is as close to a perfect food as I have found. It contains a huge 
range of healthful components, and I think everyone should include it in their 
diet. (Look for a 100 percent organic variety, of course.)
Nailing down other nutrients
If you’re a vegetarian, you have to make sure you’re getting the right levels of 
amino acids in your diet, but you have to also keep an eye on several other 
types of nutrients. Here’s a quick rundown of what you need and where you 
can get it:
 
✓ Calcium: You can get loads of calcium from dark green vegetables like 
broccoli, kale, collard and turnip greens, and spinach.
 
✓ Vitamin B-12: This vitamin is tough to find outside animal-based food, 
but you can definitely get some from eating yeast and seaweed. (You can 
always get additional B-12 from supplements, of course.)
 
✓ Iron: Introduce more iron in your diet by eating more dried beans and 
peas, lentils, and dark leafy vegetables. If you eat these foods in com-
bination with foods that are high in vitamin C, you can increase your 
absorption rates.

114
Part II: Working toward a Detoxified Life: Getting Started 
 
✓ Zinc: Compared to some other important nutrients, zinc is relatively 
easy to find. You can get zinc in whole grains, soy products, nuts, and 
wheat germ.
 
✓ Omega-3 fatty acids: If you’re a vegan, your only real dietary options for 
omega-3 fatty acids are micro algae and brown kelp (ask at your health 
food store for details), as well as walnuts. Non-vegans can find omega-3s 
in fish and fortified eggs.
Corraling Carbohydrates
Carbohydrates are substances that your body converts into glucose, which is 
the sugar that your cells use as fuel. Excess glucose that can’t be used as fuel 
right away is stored as fat. Any successful detox diet will allow you to get just 
the right amount of carbohydrates and make sure that the carbohydrates you 
eat are the good kind.
Two different kinds of carbs exist — one unhealthy and one healthy:
 
✓ Simple carbohydrates include things like fructose (fruit sugar), sucrose 
(table sugar), and lactose (milk sugar). Simple carbohydrates are easily 
and rapidly absorbed into your bloodstream, and they don’t offer much 
in the way of vitamins, minerals, or fiber. You can consume a lot of 
simple carbohydrates before your brain tells you to stop eating, and 
simple carbohydrates usually make food taste good. (Who doesn’t like 
sugar?) Therefore, it’s probably very easy for you to consume more than 
your body needs for energy in the short term. When that happens, the 
extra is stored as fat.
 
✓ Complex carbohydrates are the good kind. They’re broken down slowly, 
and your body absorbs them at a slower rate than simple carbohy-
drates. That may not seem like a big deal, but it means that when you’re 
eating a meal heavy on complex carbohydrates, your brain has time to 
respond and send you the message that you’re full and it’s time to quit 
eating before you’ve consumed excessive amounts. Even better, com-
plex carbohydrates have vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and fiber that 
your body really needs. You can find complex carbohydrates in foods 
like vegetables, whole grains, peas, and beans.
 
As a general rule, try to maintain complex carbohydrates as the primary car-
bohydrate source in your diet. Too many simple carbohydrates can cause a 
lot of health problems.
Not only are complex carbohydrates better for you from a strictly dietary 
perspective, but they’re also healthier when it comes to detoxification. The 
fiber in complex carbohydrates can absorb toxins that are present in broken-

115
 Chapter 7: Deciding on the Best Foods for a Toxin-free Dinner Table
down food in your intestine and remove those toxins with your stool. (Two 
kinds of fiber exist: soluble and insoluble. Insoluble fiber increases the bulk of 
your stool and helps it to move through your intestines. You find it in foods 
like bran, nuts, and many vegetables. Soluble fiber retains water and helps 
to control your levels of bad cholesterol and sugar. Good sources include 
apples, beans, peas, and oats.)
And here’s yet another reason to focus on complex rather than simple carbo-
hydrates: The carbohydrates that you find in almost all unhealthy processed 
foods are simple. Remember that processed foods offer very little in the way 
of nutritional value and very often contain toxins.
The battle between simple and complex carbs has become a popular way to 
evaluate carbohydrates in your diet, but there’s another and often better way 
to slice it: the glycemic index and the glucose load. Check out Chapter 9 for 
more about this method for evaluating your diet.
Getting Some Good Fats
People are generally concerned about fats for two reasons:
 
✓ Fat has twice the amount of calories as carbohydrates and protein.
 
✓ Animal fat contains cholesterol.
For years the topic of dietary fat has consumed the minds of healthcare pro-
viders and the general public. The big issue about fat is cholesterol and its 
role in causing cardiovascular disease. If you ask most people (even physi-
cians) what causes heart disease, most of them would say cholesterol. But 
more and more evidence suggests that’s not the case at all, and I want you to 
be aware of that trend.
First, let’s look at a few facts about cholesterol:
 
✓ Cholesterol is essential for many of your body’s normal functions. For 
example, your body uses it to make many different kinds of hormones.
 
✓ Most of the cholesterol in your body is made by your body. It doesn’t 
make a whole lot of sense that your body would manufacture something 
that will kill you.
 
✓ Fifty percent of heart attack victims have healthy cholesterol levels at 
the time of their heart attacks.
 
✓ In 1900, heart disease wasn’t a top-ten cause of death, and back then 
people cooked with lard — lots of it.

116
Part II: Working toward a Detoxified Life: Getting Started 
Do these facts begin to make you think that cholesterol may not play such a 
big role in heart disease? They should. And there’s more.
In his book Hidden Truth About Cholesterol-Lowering Drugs (Health Myths 
Exposed Publishing), Shane Ellison offers further insight into the cholesterol 
issue. He reports studies that refute the idea that lower cholesterol is better. 
Here’s a little taste of what he discovered:
 
✓ Low cholesterol is associated with heart arrhythmias.
 
✓ The American Geriatric Society reported that people over 65 years old 
with elevated cholesterol levels had decreased mortality. People with 
cholesterol levels as high as 417 had a better survival rate than people 
under 189.
 
✓ The Journal of Cardiac Failure published an analysis of 1,134 patients 
with heart disease that showed lower survival rates among those with 
low cholesterol than among those with high cholesterol.
These stats should raise your eyebrows. You can read much more about the 
relationship between fat, cholesterol, and heart disease in Chapter 13, but I 
wanted to give you some context before jumping into my explanation on fats 
and how you should treat them in your diet.
You can put all fats in one of two broad categories: animal fats and vegetable 
fats. I cover each here.
Animal fats
Animal fats are usually saturated (unhealthy) fats and considered by some 
people to contribute to the clogging of the arteries. Animal fats can be found 
in meat and dairy products, including butter.
Unless you’re eating 100 percent organic animal fat, you should try to limit 
the amounts of animal fat that you include in your diet — not because of 
the cholesterol, but because the fat is a storehouse of toxins that the animal 
received. Simply put, non-organic animal fats have a lot of toxicity and do 
very little to contribute to your overall health, and you should dodge them 
whenever possible.
 
In addition, strike these items off your shopping list immediately: anything 
that contains trans fat, hydrogenated fat, or partially hydrogenated fat. These 
substances are awful for you and have no place in a healthy diet!
Although fish oil is technically an animal fat, it’s really in a class of its own 
and is a healthy oil to consume if it is free of toxins.

117
 Chapter 7: Deciding on the Best Foods for a Toxin-free Dinner Table
Vegetable fats
Vegetable fats are easier to think of as vegetable oils. They include oils like 
almond, canola, corn, flaxseed, grapeseed, hempseed, olive, peanut, saf-
flower, soybean, sunflower, walnut, and motor oil. (Okay, that last one isn’t 
true. Just wanted to make sure you’re paying attention.)
Vegetable oils are usually considered to be healthier than animal fats, but 
that isn’t always the case. Cottonseed oil, for instance, is usually very satu-
rated and quite unhealthy. On the flip side, some vegetable oils have been 
unfairly given a bum rap. Take coconut oil, for example. Some studies have 
shown coconut oil to be harmful, but those studies were conducted with 
hydrogenated coconut oil, which is different from more natural versions of 
the oil. Natural coconut oil isn’t nearly as bad for you as you may have heard, 
especially when you get 100 percent organic virgin coconut oil. In fact, I think 
coconut is one of the best oils you can use when cooking. It’s also worth 
noting that coconut oil contains a substance called lauric acid, which has 
been shown to have antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal properties. (Some 
indications exist that it works as an immune system booster, too!)
You can also feel good about using flaxseed oil, olive oil, and hempseed oil 
for cooking or for putting directly on your food.
Venturing beyond Your Grocery Store
Earlier in this chapter I clue you in on how to sort through the various 
organic food options you find at your local grocery store, and in Chapter 6 I 
give you advice on how to avoid nasty processed foods when you’re in the 
grocery store. But what if you want to set your sights beyond the grocery in 
your quest to find healthy, non-toxic food options?
If that’s the case, let me first commend you on making the decision to step 
beyond the easy and obvious sources for food that so many people limit 
themselves to. You don’t have to buy all your food from one store, and in 
many cases it can pay off to shop around both in terms of the variety of 
healthy food on offer and also in terms of price. In this section, I cover three 
options to consider for food shopping: health food stores, farmers’ markets, 
and Web or catalog suppliers.

118
Part II: Working toward a Detoxified Life: Getting Started 
Going to a health food store
More and more health food stores have been popping up lately, and I think 
that’s a wonderful thing. Not every health food store offers a huge variety of 
healthy, organic, and toxin-free foods, but you’re still likely to find options 
that don’t often pop up on conventional grocery store shelves.
Picking low-toxin food at a health food store is easier than at the grocery 
store because you won’t be bombarded with unhealthy and processed alter-
natives. However, you still need to pay attention to the labels and make sure 
you’re getting the right level of organic. (Remember that 100 percent organic 
is the best.)
 
If you plan to do a lot of shopping in a health food store, take the time to get to 
know some members of the store staff. It’s always useful to make friends with 
the person who’s most informed about where the food is sourced. He or she 
can help you figure out which food options are the most healthful and which 
ones fit in best with your particular diet. As a rule, you should also be able to 
find someone who is borderline militant about the purity of the organic foods 
in the store, and that’s a good person to know, too.
Some health food stores have co-op arrangements that allow you to pay a set 
amount of money and get a certain amount of organic food each week. These 
arrangements can be very cost efficient and much easier than handpicking 
the food at a conventional grocery store. The co-op practice is also a good 
one because it limits the amount of food that the stores have to throw away 
due to spoilage. However, you lose some flexibility because you essentially 
get whatever the store gives you during a given week. If you’re interested in a 
co-op arrangement, be sure to ask someone at your local health food store.
Capitalizing on farmers’ markets
Farmers’ markets and roadside stands are great places to buy food, but 
you really must get to know the growers to make sure they’re dedicated to 
organic farming practices. Otherwise, you run the risk of buying food that has 
been grown using conventional methods involving pesticides, chemical fertil-
izers, and more. If you develop a relationship with a grower at a local stand 
or farmers’ market, you should be able to find out pretty quickly whether or 
not he is indeed committed to growing his crops in a non-toxic way. You can 
always ask about the farm’s organic certification status, too.

119
 Chapter 7: Deciding on the Best Foods for a Toxin-free Dinner Table
Turning to the Web and catalogs
It’s becoming more common for people to turn to the Internet and to catalogs 
for their food needs, and that’s both a good thing and a bad thing. It’s good 
because those options — particularly the Internet — can put a huge amount 
of possibilities at your fingertips. You can find a tremendous range of foods 
available online, and because many of the companies have very low overhead 
you can sometimes find great prices.
 
The problem with ordering food over the Internet or through a catalog is that 
you can be faced with a more difficult challenge when it comes time to con-
firm the quality of the food. If you’re considering ordering food products from 
one of these sources, be sure to study up on the organic labeling standards I 
describe earlier in this chapter and do your homework before ordering. (Ask 
for referrals, read reviews, and get all the details on how long the site or cata-
log has been in business before you lay down that credit card information.)

How Toxic Are You? The 
Detoxification Quiz
In This Chapter
▶ Focusing on your yeast levels
▶ Gauging your gastrointestinal health
▶ Thinking about your allergies
▶ Recognizing effects of chemicals and heavy metals
▶ Testing the health of your liver
N
o matter how hard you try, you’re bound to end up with toxins in your 
body. That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t strive to keep toxins out and 
detoxify your body after they’re already in, but in truth you can never com-
pletely win the battle against toxins. Toxins are inescapable, especially now 
that the presence of heavy metal, chemical, and biologic toxins in the envi-
ronment is greater than ever before.
This chapter is short but important. In the next few pages, I offer a series of 
quizzes that you can take to figure out just how toxic your body has become. 
Take the time to evaluate any symptoms of these toxin-related ailments, and 
you can get a good feel for how much toxins are causing problems for your 
body’s many systems.
 
The quizzes in this chapter aren’t meant to diagnose an ailment or disease. 
Rather, they can alert you if you have frequent symptoms that are an indicator 
of toxicity. If you have significant symptoms, you should consult a physician — 
preferably an open-minded one who is willing to consider toxicity as a real 
threat to your health (see Chapter 5).
Here’s how this chapter works: For each of the quizzes, score the frequency 
with which you experience each symptom. Then total your score and com-
pare that number to the severity rating scale that corresponds with that quiz.
Note that if your score is low, that doesn’t necessarily mean you’re in the 
clear if some of your symptoms are severe. Also note that some symptoms 
are involved in several different types of toxicity.

122
Part II: Working toward a Detoxified Life: Getting Started

many different kinds of symptoms and ailments. It’s a general problem that 
is best solved with a wide-ranging detoxification effort. Check out Chapter 3 
for some information on where those toxins may be coming from, and go to

 Chapter 8: How Toxic Are You? The Detoxification Quiz
 
This quiz includes symptoms of toxicity that are caused by mercury, lead, 
arsenic, and aluminum. The symptoms from different metals often overlap, 
and multiple metal toxicities can be as much as 100 times more toxic than the 
individual toxins.
If you register moderate or severe toxicity according to this quiz, ask your-
self these questions to continue the process:
 
✓ Have you received multiple influenza vaccinations?
 
✓ Do you have amalgam dental fillings?
 
✓ Do you often use antacids that contain aluminum?
 
✓ Did you receive childhood vaccines before 2001?
 
✓ Do you eat fish frequently?
If you answer yes to these questions and you also have a high level of toxicity 
according to the quiz, you could very well be suffering the effects of having 
too many heavy metals in your body. Check out Chapter 18 for some useful 
detox guidance so you can start detoxing immediately, and be sure to read 
Chapter 3 so you understand how you’re being exposed to harmful materials. 
You should also consider going to the doctor to get tested for mercury, lead, 
arsenic, or aluminum.

How did you do? If your score puts you in the moderate or severe toxicity 
range, please think about the questions that follow.
 
✓ Do you have a history of chemical exposure?
 
✓ Do you consume excess amounts of fat and protein?
 
✓ Do you consume a lot of alcohol or use drugs?
 
✓ Have you contracted hepatitis at any point in the past?
Answering yes to one or more of these questions can mean that you have an 
increased risk for liver toxicity. Your liver is a completely essential organ, 
and you want to make sure it’s healthy. If you think your liver may be suffer-
ing, flip back to Chapter 4 to get some details on liver detoxification and think 
hard about scheduling an appointment with your physician to discuss the 
problem.

Enhancing 
Wellness through 
Detoxification

In this part . . .
You can think of this part as a menu of choices. Want 
to improve your immune system? Go to Chapter 10. 
Want to beat your allergies so you’re not suffering from 
them all the time? Have a look at Chapter 12. Or maybe 
you want to be able to stop smoking and put down the

Chapters 14 and 15, respectively. That’s just the begin-

In This Chapter
▶ Rethinking what it means to go on a diet
▶ Identifying destructive eating behaviors
▶ Focusing on the right eating habits
▶ Putting some thought and planning into your eating
A
s you’ve no doubt seen, read, and heard on 
the news, obesity is more of a problem now 
than it ever has been before. The unhealthy, toxin-
filled foods that people consume on a massive 
scale have caused many to become overweight, 
and the trend doesn’t seem to be letting up any-
time soon.
If you’re interested in losing weight or staying at a healthy weight, the best 
way to do so is to choose and eat healthy, toxin-free foods. Doing so isn’t 
always easy, but it’s certainly something that you can accomplish, and I’m 
happy to provide you with the basics in this chapter.
I start out by asking you to rethink what it means to go on a diet, and then I 
set out a number of ways that you can change the way you think about food 
and the way you eat. A successful detox diet really starts with a particular 
mindset. If you can begin to think about food and eating in a certain way, 
you’ve already won half the battle.

Changing the Way You 
Think about Dieting
What does it mean to go on a diet? For most people, dieting means commit-
ting to eating in some unusual and bizarre way for as short a period of time 
as possible to achieve significant weight loss. People who go on diets want 
to shed pounds until they reach some magical weight. (For most, that means 
getting down to what they weighed several years ago, when they could eat 
whatever they wanted without gaining any weight.)
 
This concept of dieting is pretty strange when you really think about it, and 
dieting very rarely works. Most diets fail spectacularly even though we spend 
outrageous sums of money on them. The amount spent on diets in the United 
States each year — upward of $50 billion — is higher than the entire gross 
domestic product of Costa Rica! Combine that staggering figure with the fact 
that we’re still one of the fattest countries in the history of the world, and you 
can clearly see that we’re going about dieting in the wrong way.
Identifying the problem with diet pills
Diet pills are a popular choice for people who struggle with their weight. 
Most people think that if they use diet pills for a period of time, they can 
simply get used to eating less and watch in amazement as the weight drops 
(and stays) off. Nothing could be further from the truth.
 
Diet pills reduce your appetite so you can eat all you want and lose weight — 
you just want less. But when you stop the diet pills, you continue the same 
behavior. You still eat all you want, but because you’re not taking the pills 
anymore, your body wants a lot more. The end result: You gain weight.
Research has shown that almost all people who use diet pills to lose weight 
end up weighing more than they did before they started the pills. In the end 
they would’ve been better off not buying the pills at all.
Realizing why limiting your 
consumption doesn’t work
Many other diets focus on reducing the amount or types of food you can 
eat to the point that you’re miserable all the time. Maybe you’re allowed to 
have only a mug of hot water for breakfast and lunch (followed by “a sensible 
dinner”!), or maybe you can eat all the beef and cheese you want but not 
much else.

133
 Chapter 9: Reaching Your Ideal Weight (And StayingThere!) with Detox Dieting 
On many such diets, people will lose 5 pounds in the first week and think 
that means they’ll reach their goal of losing 20 pounds in just a month. The 
problem? That first 5 pounds is mostly water weight. After the second week 
of dieting, the pounds stop coming off and the feeling of failure starts set-
ting in. Then the dieter gives up, saying that hormones must be causing the 
weight gain and she can’t do anything about it. So she goes on an eating 
binge to reward herself for making such a valiant effort and ends up gaining 
10 pounds.
Does this pattern sound familiar?
Seeking the big picture
As a country, the United States has a weight problem. But the true problem is 
not the weight itself; it’s the way we think about eating.
 
If you want to lose weight, you have to look at the process not as an isolated 
diet but rather as a change in the way you eat for the rest of your life. If you 
look at dieting in any other way, you’re dooming yourself to fail. That’s the 
bad news. The good news is that if you approach dieting in the right frame of 
mind, you can make the kind of long-term changes that will help you to lose 
weight, detoxify your body, and enjoy better all-around health. The rest of this 
chapter shows you how.
Doing Away with Dysfunctional 
Eating Behaviors
The first step you can take toward establishing a healthy, sustainable diet 
for you and your family is to cut out key dysfunctional eating behaviors that 
you’ve developed over the years. Please don’t feel bad if you’ve fallen into one 
of the traps I describe in this section; our culture makes it very easy to start 
down the wrong path and very challenging to keep your guard up all the time.
Here are the biggest behavioral pitfalls:
 
✓ Eating whatever is quickest and easiest to procure: When you’re really 
hungry, what could be easier than driving through a fast food restau-
rant? You pay just a few bucks for a big bag full of greasy, toxin-filled 
food and maybe another buck or two to get a 64-ounce cup of an equally 
unhealthy soft drink. No planning or preparation is required. You get 
hungry, and you hammer back some grub — that’s the end of it.

134
Part III: Enhancing Wellness through Detoxification 
 
✓ Failing to plan your at-home meals: Even when you’re at home, the fast-
est and easiest meals are often the first choice. That’s especially true 
when everyone in the house is eating at different times. Why take the 
time to chop up some vegetables or run some produce through a juicer 
when you can microwave a frozen dinner, pop open a couple cans of 
processed side dishes, and sit down to eat?
 
✓ Racing through meals: After you’ve spent mere minutes microwav-
ing your dinner, you may sit down in front of the TV to eat. Then, after 
you’ve gulped down your food (very likely in mere minutes as well), 
you’re right back to the TV, videogames, or the Internet. I know some 
families who have a little game to see who can finish their food the fast-
est! That’s a very bad habit to encourage (as I explain later in this chapter).
 
 Sometimes family members save arguments or stressful conversations 
for dinner time. Not a good idea! You should be relaxed when you eat so 
your body is ready to turn its attention toward effective digestion. 
If you’re intent on detoxifying your body and losing weight, you have to make 
a long-term commitment to putting a stop to harmful eating behaviors you’ve 
developed over the years. It’s not easy, and if you have a family you may 
face resistance on the home front. But you simply won’t succeed if you try to 
approach the process with anything other than the long view.
Going Back to the Basics
To better understand how you should be approaching food, think about what 
life was like generations ago, when many people were farmers and focused 
almost exclusively on growing food for their families. Everyone in the family 
worked extremely hard (especially compared to today’s standards), and 
people were outside for much of the year. They cared for crops grown organi-
cally without chemical fertilizers or harsh pesticides. The food they grew, 
and the food they caught or killed in the form of wild game, was relatively 
hard to procure and was overwhelmingly toxin-free. Families ate together, 
taking time to slowly enjoy the food that they had worked so hard to pro-
duce. Then they relaxed for the rest of the evening before getting up early to 
do it all over again.
Obviously, people back then faced their share of problems and hardships. 
But as far as food quality and toxicity, they had it pretty good. People didn’t 
suffer from the effects of widespread toxins in their air, water, and food. 
Health problems like Alzheimer’s, multiple sclerosis, autism, and ADHD 
weren’t an issue, and the population wasn’t enslaved by heart disease, 
cancer, arthritis, and hypertension.
I know that you’re not going to go back to living the way people lived back 
then. I can’t ask you to quit your job and start working out in the fields with 
hand tools and a mule-driven plow to grow your own food, which you could 

135
 Chapter 9: Reaching Your Ideal Weight (And StayingThere!) with Detox Dieting 
enjoy eating over the course of a couple of hours with your family in front of 
the fireplace. However, when it comes to food and eating, you can certainly 
incorporate certain aspects of that lifestyle into your routine. The effects on 
your health (and weight) can be tremendous. 
Chewing the right way
Chewing is extremely important to your health. You can do your body a lot of 
good just by chewing the right way. Chewing is the first step in the digestive 
process, and if it’s not done correctly, your digestion can really suffer.
One of the most important aspects of the chewing process is the act of physi-
cally breaking down your food into smaller pieces. If the food pieces are too 
big when they get to your stomach, the next part of the digestive process 
doesn’t work properly. The result is that you won’t absorb the nutrients in 
your food nearly as well.
 
To make sure you get the most out of the nutrients in your food, take the time 
to chew your food into smaller and smaller pieces until it’s essentially a liquid 
before swallowing.
The interaction that your saliva has with your food is also very important. 
Your goal should be to make sure that saliva touches every last surface of 
your food. If you can accomplish that, you can be confident that you’re start-
ing your digestion off right because your saliva contains digestive enzymes. 
You can also feel good about reducing your risks for irritating or damaging 
your esophagus. If you don’t take the time to mix plenty of saliva in with your 
food when you chew, you can harm the surface tissue of your esophagus 
when you swallow.
 
When you’re eating, take your time and chew slowly. Taking plenty of time to 
chew is a great way to ensure that you’re breaking your food down into small 
enough bits and also saturating it with adequate amounts of saliva.
Slowing down your eating
So many aspects of our modern culture lead to eating much too fast. Fast-
paced lives include fast-paced meals, and that trend is flat-out unhealthy. The 
slower you can eat your food, the better. Why? Here are two key reasons:
 
✓ The physical reason: Your stomach has a limited amount of acid and 
enzymes available to break down your food. If you eat extremely quickly 
and throw a lot of food at your stomach at once, your stomach has a 
hard time soaking all the food with the right amount of acid. That means 
your stomach isn’t able to do its job, and lousy nutrient absorption is 
often the result.

136
Part III: Enhancing Wellness through Detoxification 
 
✓ The mental reason: The mental aspect of eating is often overlooked. 
Your stomach and intestines respond to your emotional state. If you’re 
anxious, nervous, hurried, or physically active when you eat, there’s 
a discernable decrease in blood flow to your stomach and intestines. 
Digesting your food properly is a blood-intensive process, so eating at 
a frenzied pace when you’re not relaxed can put your digestion at risk. 
Also, you eat a lot more if you are multitasking while you eat rather than 
paying attention to your food.
Resisting the urge to wash it down
The standard American diet includes a drink with every meal. How many 
meals have you had recently that weren’t accompanied by a glass, can, or 
bottle of something to drink? Some people have a hard time believing this, 
but having a drink with your meal can actually cause a problem when it 
comes to healthy nutrition.
When you’re eating and you take a drink, the food and saliva combination 
in your mouth is immediately diluted, and the digestive enzymes in your 
saliva are compromised. Then, when you swallow the mix of food, drink, and 
saliva, the slippery texture of your saliva is cut by the drink, and swallowing 
becomes more likely to irritate your esophagus.
Drinking with meals can also create problems for your stomach. Your stom-
ach is about the same size as both of your hands cupped together. When you 
drink a big beverage while eating, you can really fill up your stomach and 
drastically dilute your stomach acid, which throws a wrench in digestion. 
If your stomach can’t thoroughly soak the food you put in it with powerful 
acid, it can’t properly prepare the food to enter the intestines, where much 
of digestion — particularly nutrient absorption — takes place. And the effect 
trickles down: Drinks can also dilute enzymes from other sources, like the 
pancreas.
 
Drinking lots of water is a good thing for dieting and for detoxification, but 
don’t drink anything with your meals. Wait at least one hour after eating 
before having a big glass of water, and your digestion will improve as a result.
Less is more, more often
Most people have experienced the ravages of indigestion from eating a 
really big meal. It’s an uncomfortable, unnatural feeling, and it contributes to 
weight gain and general damage to your health.
A large meal — especially one that you eat quickly — challenges your stom-
ach’s ability to produce the acid and pepsin (an important digestive enzyme) 

137
 Chapter 9: Reaching Your Ideal Weight (And StayingThere!) with Detox Dieting 
necessary to break down your food. A lack of acid is a problem, and the 
problem is further compounded by the fact that it triggers your pancreas to 
produce less of its important digestive enzymes. That leaves you with some 
pretty poorly digested food that starts heading into the intestines where it 
can wreak all sorts of havoc and cause you plenty of discomfort.
Like many of the problems I describe earlier in this chapter, big meals also 
decrease your chances of properly absorbing the nutrients in your food. 
Finally, eating a huge amount of food at one time can cause your blood sugar 
to rise and fall dramatically, which makes your energy levels go haywire and 
can even contribute to diabetes over time.
How can you avoid these complications? It’s pretty easy, really. The best 
way to get the most out of your digestive system is to eat small meals on a 
more frequent basis. This eating pattern allows all the digestive processes to 
do their work without being overwhelmed, and it helps to ensure that your 
blood sugar stays at steady, pleasant levels (no big peaks and troughs in your 
energy levels). Smaller and more frequent meals also allow for more absorp-
tion of nutrients.
 
The best eating pattern for a detoxification diet is to eat smaller meals more 
often throughout the day. One good plan is to eat three small meals a day — 
breakfast, lunch, and dinner work fine — and also eat a small snack between 
each meal.
Taking a break
How often have you heard the term “eat and run”? You’ve probably heard it 
a lot, and if you’re like a lot of Americans, you’ve probably done it far more 
than you should. To get the most out of your food, you need to take a break 
after eating a meal. It doesn’t have to be a long break, so please don’t think I’m 
suggesting that you need to lie down on the couch for 60 minutes after a mid-
afternoon snack. But it does help the digestive process if you can avoid any 
vigorous activity for a short period of time — 30 minutes is a good rule — right 
after you eat.
Why is this break important? A natural process occurs right after you eat that 
involves an increased level of blood flow to your stomach and intestines and 
a decreased blood flow to your muscles. Healthy digestion depends on an 
ample supply of available blood for your digestive organs and other tissues. 
If you engage in physical activity soon after eating, you allow your muscles 
to place a demand for your blood at the expense of your stomach and intes-
tines. The shift of blood flow that occurs directly after you eat allows all the 
digestive processes to function at a high level, and it also allows for better 
absorption of nutrients. Don’t jeopardize those benefits by shifting into high 
gear right after you have a meal.

138

Taking time for a BM
Let’s face it: What goes in has to come out. Nobody likes to talk about having 
a bowel movement, but I would be remiss if I didn’t touch on the importance 
of normal, healthy BMs as a part of any successful detox diet.
The gastrointestinal tract produces quite a lot of trash, and the trash has 
to be emptied on a regular basis. If your stool sits too long in your colon, 
too much water is removed from it and it becomes dry and hard to pass. 
That’s very uncomfortable and even harmful when the situation is extreme. 
It can also contribute to toxicity because when higher-than-normal amounts 
of water are absorbed from your stool into your intestines, the chances 
increase that toxins will be absorbed at the same time.
From the time we are born, a natural reflex called the gastro-colic reflex is 
present. This reflex stimulates you to have a bowel movement shortly after 
a meal. For many people, it can be a subtle reflex that is relatively easy to 
override. That’s unfortunate. Many people resist the natural urge to have a 
BM after a meal, waiting instead until they can take care of it at a more conve-
nient time and in a more convenient location.
 
If at all possible, don’t fight your body’s natural reflex to have a bowel move-
ment after a meal. A healthy BM schedule is vital for good health and detoxifi-
cation, and you need to make sure you’re making your body’s needs #1 when 
it comes to #2.
Practicing Essential (And Realistic) 
Eating Habits
I can go on and on about the specific steps you should take to detoxify your 
body and improve your health, but none of it amounts to much if you can’t 
make those practices part of your everyday life, and fast.
When it comes to detox dieting, you need to do as much as you can to put 
your diet in proper perspective and make eating properly a major priority in 
your life. The food you choose to eat has a big impact on your health, as does 
the food you choose not to eat. Some of the steps are easy, and some can be 
quite difficult if you’ve been stuck in an unhealthy food rut for a long period 
of time. But you have to commit to making the changes or you’ll never see 
any success with your detox diet. Proper non-toxic eating habits will provide 
you with good health, whereas most prescriptions treat only the symptoms 
of disease.

139
 Chapter 9: Reaching Your Ideal Weight (And StayingThere!) with Detox Dieting 
 
The practices I describe next are not suggestions; they’re rules. Thinking of 
them as rules is the only way you’ll make the kinds of long-term adjustments 
to your eating habits that will allow you to rid your body of toxins and reach 
your ideal weight through detox dieting.
Dodging food served through a window
Fast food is designed to be prepared rapidly (hence the name) and to appeal 
to the taste buds of the majority of the population. It’s cheap to prepare and 
sell. Providing good nutrition and avoiding toxins have never been part of the 
formula when it comes to fast food.
If I started writing now and promised that I wouldn’t stop until I had covered 
all the various unhealthy qualities of fast food, I’d still be writing when the 
last Styrofoam cup from the last fast food restaurant finally biodegraded. Fast 
food is truly awful for you. Here are just a few tidbits for you to consider.
 
✓ A recent study found that 100 percent of chicken from fast food restau-
rants contains at least some amount of arsenic, which is an extremely 
harmful toxin.
 
✓ The vast majority of beef used in fast food is raised on massive commer-
cial feed lots where the cows are pumped full of hormones, antibiotics, 
and steroids.
 
✓ Cooking — if you can call it that — in fast food restaurants is done 
almost exclusively with trans fats, which are the most unhealthy, toxin-
laden fats you can consume.
The worst part of the fast food picture is that fast food restaurant chains 
spend billions of dollars each year on marketing tricks, which are designed to 
make you feel better about eating their food. One chain offers a large packet 
of salad dressing that has only 70 calories per serving. The problem is that in 
very small print at the bottom of the package it says the package contains 5 
servings. That’s 350 calories in one packet alone, which is as many calories 
as the standard cheeseburger.
It’s not impossible to make food choices at fast food restaurants that aren’t 
completely horrible for your body — salads come to mind. But you always 
need to remember that the ingredients you find even in those somewhat 
healthy alternatives were chosen because they were the cheapest (not 
because they were the healthiest, and certainly not because they contained 
the fewest toxins).
 
Don’t eat fast food. The convenience and the price simply aren’t worth the 
damaging effects that fast food has on your health.

140

Avoiding white foods
If you’re looking for a simple rule that can go quite a long way toward making 
your detox diet a success, this is the one for you. It seems like such a simple 
thing, but by avoiding white foods you automatically miss out on the things 
that are loaded with calories, short on nutrients, and often jam-packed with 
toxins. Avoiding white foods is a fantastic rule to live by for diabetics and 
anyone who wants to be healthy and maintain a decent weight. Avoid any-
thing white and anything that started out white.
 
A few exceptions to the “Don’t eat white foods” rule exist, the most notable 
being cauliflower. Feel free to make that vegetable a part of your diet, and of 
course try to use a 100 percent organic option if you can!
Getting out the gluten
Gluten is a substance found in barley, rye, wheat, and oats. It’s used as a 
major protein source in many cultures and is common in the United States. 
Gluten is present in all wheat products and is used as an additive to make 
food thicker or stick foods together. You find it in breads, wheat pastas, 
pastries, cookies, cakes, and literally anything made from flour (which is typi-
cally white). If you’re reading your food labels like you should be, you’ll see 
that gluten pops up in an incredible array of food products.
 
Dodging gluten in wheat and grains is hard enough, but food manufacturers 
make avoiding gluten even trickier because they add it to a dizzying variety 
of foods. You can find it in soups, casseroles, pastes, cereals, and even beef 
jerky. Forms of gluten can be included in ingredients lists with many names, 
including starch, binders, and natural flavorings.
The steps necessary to cut gluten out of your diet are too complex for me to 
cover here. If you’d like to eliminate gluten from your diet, try reading Living 
Gluten-Free For Dummies by Danna Korn (Wiley).
Increasing numbers of people have a gluten allergy, and many others suffer 
from an ailment called celiac disease. That’s an autoimmune disorder where 
the presence of gluten in the diet causes multiple, extremely unpleasant 
effects. Some estimates indicate that as many as one out of every eight 
people has some form of celiac disease. The small intestines of people who 
suffer from celiac disease are damaged when the diet includes gluten, and 
over time the damage can cause the intestine to leak substances that aren’t 
intended to get into the bloodstream, like harmful bacteria and toxins. It’s 
not a pretty picture, but it’s one that many people live with.
Common symptoms of celiac disease include diarrhea, vomiting, and abdomi-
nal pain. It can also contribute to growth retardation and psychosocial 
problems in children. If you think you may be suffering from celiac disease, 
consult your doctor. Keep in mind, though, that if your doctor is firmly 
rooted in conventional medicine, she may be prone to look for every other 

141
 Chapter 9: Reaching Your Ideal Weight (And StayingThere!) with Detox Dieting 
possible cause for your symptoms before considering celiac disease or a 
similar form of gluten sensitivity. Common misdiagnoses include irritable 
bowel syndrome, Crohn’s disease, regional enteritis, gastroenteritis, nervous 
stomach, and stomach flu.
Your doctor can order blood tests to determine whether you have celiac dis-
ease, but the best way to confirm the problem is to go on a gluten-free diet 
because it’s possible that gluten is giving you fits but not at the level that 
would be confirmed with a blood test. A gluten-free diet isn’t an easy thing to 
do, but if your body is sensitive to gluten, the rewards are enormous.
Here’s one other note on gluten for you to consider: After it’s in the body, 
gluten can be transformed into a compound called glutomorphine. That com-
pound is commonly identified in autistic children, and some experts think 
that it causes additional complications within the autism spectrum. If some-
one you know is affected by autism, you may want to consider trying to limit 
his gluten intake to see if doing so has a positive effect on his symptoms.
Removing milk and milk products
Milk is processed in some very strange and unnatural ways these days, and 
the result can be a product that has questionable health benefits and could, 
in fact, contribute to some ailments. Quite a lot of the milk available today 
also contains hormones and antibiotics because those substances are fre-
quently given to dairy cows.
About 20 percent of the U.S. population is lactose intolerant, meaning that 
milk and products made from milk cause quite a few problems. For these 
people, caseins could be the culprit.
Caseins are proteins found in milk. Casein is structurally very similar to 
gluten, and it may cause some of the same effects. We don’t yet fully under-
stand how caseins could wreak havoc on the intestines and other parts of the 
body, and we also don’t know how many people may be casein intolerant. 
But some experts believe that for some people, casein causes long-term dis-
ruption to the digestive system and can also have negative effects on mental 
and immune function.
Some interesting case studies suggest a connection between casein and 
the symptoms of autism in children. Avoidance diets — in which children 
don’t eat or drink anything containing casein — have resulted in remarkable 
improvements in the behavior of some children with autism. As with gluten, 
if you are close to a child with autism, you may consider putting him on a 
diet that cuts out casein to see if there’s a positive effect.
 
If you’re suffering from a digestive system problem and your doctor isn’t 
having much luck diagnosing or treating it successfully, consider cutting milk 
and milk products out of your diet for three months. An avoidance diet of that 
length will tell you whether milk is creating problems for your intestines. And 

142
Part III: Enhancing Wellness through Detoxification 
don’t worry about missing out on calcium: You can get all the calcium you 
need from vegetables, and you can get your vitamin D with supplements.
Keep in mind that most conventional physicians don’t consider casein to be 
a real problem, so you may have to decide for yourself whether consuming 
milk or milk products is damaging to your health.
 
If you choose to eliminate milk from your diet, be on the lookout for milk prod-
ucts hidden in other foods. Milk or milk proteins are added to a wide variety 
of foods, particularly processed foods. Check labels for sodium caseinate, cal-
cium caseinate, and milk protein; all three are milk-based materials.
Giving sweeteners the slip
Sweeteners are one of the biggest problem areas when it comes to detoxi-
fication and detox dieting. Sweeteners are present in a mind-boggling array 
of foods, and they can add up quickly to cause a bigger waistline and higher 
levels of toxins in your body.
 
As you begin your detox diet and general detoxification efforts, do your best 
to cut out foods and beverages that contain sweeteners. Sweeteners contrib-
ute to obesity (either directly or indirectly) and are often loaded with toxins. 
The one exception is stevia, a plant-based sweetener that doesn’t contribute 
to weight gain, diabetes, or any other ailments that are common among people 
who consume excessive amounts of sweeteners.
The many faces of sugar
Sugar comes in many, many forms on ingredient lists, and you need to be 
sure you’re checking for all of them when you’re scanning ingredients to 
select healthy, toxin-free foods. Here are a few common forms of sugar you 
need to watch out for:
 
✓ Dextrin
 
✓ Fructose
 
✓ Galactose
 
✓ Glucose
 
✓ Lactose
 
✓ Maltose
 
✓ Sucrose
In addition to dodging the different kinds of sugar, you also need to make sure 
you cut out the artificial sweeteners. Here are the most common examples:

143
 Chapter 9: Reaching Your Ideal Weight (And StayingThere!) with Detox Dieting 
 
✓ Acesulfame
 
✓ Aspartame
 
✓ Neotame
 
✓ Saccharin
 
✓ Sucralose
High fructose corn syrup
 
High fructose corn syrup deserves its own section because it’s used in all 
kinds of processed foods and food products. It’s everywhere, and it’s horrible 
for you! Not only is the substance itself really bad for your health, but it also 
often contains mercury. Do whatever you can to cut high fructose corn syrup 
out of your diet immediately!
Planning ahead
Unhealthy, toxic food has crept into the diets of most people because it’s 
incredibly easy and often cheap to obtain. You can get nutritionally lousy, 
high-toxin food in a huge number of places these days.
If you want to eat healthy, lose weight, and cut out toxins, you have to 
commit to thinking about and planning your meals. Planning ahead is the key 
to success for detoxing and for weight loss. Here are a few useful tips that 
will help you adjust to the idea of putting some thought into the food you eat:
 
✓ Remember that you’re changing the way you eat for the rest of your life. 
Even if it feels like a pain to read labels, shop for healthy ingredients, 
and make a concerted effort to dodge toxins, doing so will get easier 
over time as it becomes the norm.
 
✓ Go through your pantry and refrigerator and get rid of the unhealthy, 
toxic foods that I describe in Chapter 6. If a food is in your house, you’ll 
probably eat it, so either trash it or donate it.
 
✓ If you’re going to be away from home at a meal time, either pack a 
healthy meal or snack or figure out a healthy place to eat beforehand. 
Decisions made on the fly with limited choices rarely turn out well.
 
✓ Build a few more minutes into your meal schedule. Taking the time to 
eat your food slowly and giving your digestive system a few minutes to 
work its magic before you’re off to the races again can pay dividends for 
any detoxification diet. Also consider taking digestive enzymes at meal-
times; they can never hurt. And remember that having a bowel move-
ment after a meal is a normal reflex, so don’t fight it.
 
✓ Make sure you have a good source of clean water available at all times, 
but don’t drink it during meal time!

Recipes for Detox Dieting Success
One important thing to bear in mind when starting out on a detox diet is that 
the food you eat doesn’t have to be bland or boring. You can cook up some 
really fantastic dishes and stay safely within the tenets of detox dieting. Don’t 
believe me? Check out the recipes in the next few pages.
 
Curried Chicken with 
 
Amaranth Pilaf
Curry powder is an excellent spice combination to add to your diet. It is flavorful and 
warm. One of the main ingredients of this delicious chicken recipe is turmeric, a root 
with powerful anti-inflammatory properties. It helps improve liver and cardiovascular 
function. And whole grains like amaranth contain lots of soluble fiber, which helps you 
feel full more quickly so you eat less.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: 30 minutes
Yield: 6 servings
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 organic yellow onion, chopped
3 cloves organic garlic, chopped
2 teaspoons curry powder
1 cup organic amaranth, rinsed
2/3 cup chopped organic dates
2 cups filtered water
1 cup freshly squeezed orange juice
1 1/2 pounds organic, free-range, skinless chicken 
breasts, cut into strips
1 tablespoon curry powder
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1/8 teaspoon white pepper
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/2 cup fresh orange juice
2 tablespoons local organic honey

T Chopped Veggie Salad
Raw vegetables are important to a detox diet, especially when focusing on weight loss. 
They’re rich in fiber, vitamins, and minerals, and they contain enzymes that help your 
liver focus on converting stored fat into energy. That helps the pounds come off!
One of the nicest things about salads is that it’s so easy to change them, adding foods 
you love or deleting foods you don’t like. Just about anything goes — as long as it’s 100 
percent organic. Other vegetables that would be good in this salad include shredded 
raw parsnips, sliced fresh mushrooms, and chopped tomatoes, fennel, or celery.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 0 minutes
Yield: 4–6 servings
2/3 cup plain low fat yogurt
2 tablespoons flaxseed oil
3 tablespoons Dijon mustard
2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice
1/4 cup chopped organic flat-leaf parsley
1/8 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
2 cups chopped organic red cabbage
2 cups cauliflower florets, chopped
1 pound organic asparagus, chopped
2 small beets, peeled and shredded
3 organic carrots, peeled and shredded
2 avocados, peeled and chopped
1/2 cup sliced toasted almonds
 1 In large bowl, combine yogurt, flaxseed oil, mustard, lemon juice, parsley, and pepper; 
mix well. Add cabbage, cauliflower, asparagus, beets, and carrots and stir to coat. 
Refrigerate until ready to serve.
 2 Just before serving, add avocados and toss gently. Sprinkle with almonds and serve.
 
 You can also serve this salad on a bed of mixed organic greens or cooked brown rice 
mixed with chopped nuts and a mustard vinaigrette.

T Root Vegetable Lentil Soup
Root vegetables are hearty and filling, and they contain lots of antioxidants and fiber. 
Cooking these vegetables makes their nutrients more available, and it concentrates 
their flavor. Lentils are an excellent diet food: nutty, creamy, and a wonderful source of 
protein. This soup is warming and satisfying on a cold day.
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Cooking time: 70 minutes
Yield: 6 servings
2 tablespoons organic olive oil
2 organic onions, peeled and chopped
5 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
2 tablespoons grated organic ginger root
2 organic sweet potatoes, peeled and chopped
1 parsnip, peeled and chopped
4 organic carrots, chopped
1 teaspoon turmeric
2 sprigs fresh organic rosemary
5 cups filtered water
1 1/2 cups organic apple juice
1 cup organic Puy lentils
2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
1/2 cup chopped organic flat-leaf parsley
1 cup plain yogurt, drained in cheesecloth
1/2 cup toasted pumpkin seeds
 1 In a large pot, place olive oil; add onions, garlic, and ginger root. Cook over medium 
high heat, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are tender, about 6–7 minutes. Add 
sweet potatoes and parsnip; cook and stir until vegetables start to soften.
 2 Add carrots, turmeric, rosemary, water, apple juice, and lentils; bring to a simmer. 
Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer 40–50 minutes until vegetables and lentils are 
tender.

T Quinoa Fruit Breakfast Cereal
Quinoa (pronounced keen-wah) is a super-crop, containing all the amino acids neces-
sary for the human body to stay healthy. It’s an ancient grain, eaten by pre-Columbian 
peoples.
Make sure that you rinse quinoa well before using because it’s coated with a substance 
called saponin, which is a bitter chemical that prevents birds from eating the seeds.
The berries add a fresh finish to this hearty breakfast, providing you with antioxidants, 
vitamin C, flavonoids, and phytochemicals. And raspberries have anthocyanins, a com-
pound that stabilizes blood sugar to keep hunger pangs away.
Preparation time: 25 minutes
Cooking time: 25 minutes
Yield: 4–6 servings
1 1/3 cups quinoa, well rinsed
1 cup filtered water
1 cup freshly squeezed orange juice
1 cup organic apple juice
1/4 teaspoon stevia
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1/2 cup toasted slivered almonds
1 cup chopped organic strawberries
1 cup organic blueberries
1 cup organic raspberries
1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice
2 tablespoons organic honey
1 tablespoon organic fresh thyme leaves
 1 Spread the rinsed quinoa on a paper towel and let dry 10–15 minutes. (Note: It will still 
be somewhat wet after 15 minutes, which is fine.)
 2 Place quinoa in a skillet over medium heat and toast it, stirring frequently, until it 
begins to pop. Remove from heat; place quinoa in heavy saucepan.
 3 Add filtered water, orange juice, apple juice, stevia, and cinnamon and bring to a 
simmer. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer 20–25 minutes until quinoa is tender.
 4 Stir in almonds, remove from heat, cover, and let stand 5 minutes. Meanwhile, combine 
berries with lemon juice, honey, and thyme in small bowl. Serve the quinoa and top 
with the berry mixture.

Crunchy Curried Salmon Wraps
One of the secrets of eating well with fewer calories is to add interest and flavor to your 
food. Curry powder adds no calories but is full of flavor and nutrients. Nuts are an 
important part of any diet; they provide good fats and lots of protein. And using whole 
grain organic tortillas as wraps satisfies your need for carbohydrates in a healthy way.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: 8 minutes
Yield: 8 servings
1 pound wild Alaskan salmon fillets
1/2 cup freshly squeezed orange juice
1 tablespoon grated fresh organic ginger root
1 cup sliced organic celery
1/2 cup diced organic dried apricots
1/2 cup diced organic prunes
1/4 cup diced unsalted cashews
2/3 cup organic low fat yogurt
1–2 tablespoons curry powder
1/8 teaspoon white pepper
1 1/2 cups organic arugula
1 1/2 cups organic broccoli sprouts or 
mung bean sprouts
8 organic 10-inch whole-grain tortillas
 1 Place salmon fillets in large skillet; pour juice over; sprinkle with ginger root. Bring to a 
simmer over medium heat. Reduce heat to low, cover, and poach salmon for 7–8 min-
utes until done. Remove salmon from pan; reserve 2 tablespoons poaching liquid.
 2 Flake salmon and place in medium bowl. Add celery, apricots, prunes, and cashews.
 3 In small bowl, combine yogurt, curry powder, poaching liquid, and pepper; mix. Add to 
salmon mixture and stir gently.
 4 Divide arugula and sprouts among the tortillas; add salmon mixture. Roll up and cut 
each roll in half. Serve immediately.

T Nutty Hummus Dip
Hummus is a puree of chickpeas (also called garbanzo beans), garlic, sesame, and 
lemon. It’s high in folate, manganese, fiber, and protein and very low in fat, making it the 
perfect diet snack. Hummus is also delicious as a sandwich spread or topping for grilled 
salmon or chicken. Serve it with lots of fresh vegetables for dipping, and if you can find 
whole grain organic pita bread, cut it into triangles and toast it for another great dipper. 
For this recipe keep in mind that you can substitute a 15-ounce can of organic chick-
peas for the cooked chickpeas, but the result will be higher in sodium.
Preparation time: 25 minutes (plus overnight soaking time)
Cooking time: 2 hours
Yield: 6–8 servings
1 cup dried organic chickpeas or garbanzo beans
6 cups filtered water
1 head organic garlic
2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil
2 tablespoons flaxseed oil
1/4 cup organic tahini (sesame paste), like Artisana
1/2 cup toasted slivered almonds
3 tablespoons toasted sesame seeds
5 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/8 teaspoon red pepper flakes
 1 Pick over the chickpeas and rinse well. Cover with filtered water and soak overnight.
 2 In the morning, drain and rinse the chickpeas. Place in heavy saucepan, cover with 6 
cups filtered water, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover pan, and simmer 70–120 
minutes until they are tender. (Check after 1 hour to see if they are soft.) Drain well, 
reserving 1/3 cup cooking liquid.
 3 Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Cut garlic head in half crosswise and place, cut side up, 
on small baking sheet. Drizzle each half with a teaspoon of sesame oil. Bake for 35–45 
minutes until garlic is very soft. Let cool 15 minutes, then remove cloves from skin; set 
aside.
 4 In food processor, combine roasted garlic, cooked and drained chickpeas, and remain-
ing ingredients. Process until desired consistency, adding reserved cooking liquid as 
desired. Hummus can be very smooth or it can be chunky. You may need to add more 
water, lemon juice, or flaxseed oil until the hummus is creamy. Serve with vegetable 
dippers.

T Apple-Pear Smoothie
Apples and pears are available year-round, so they’re perfect for this easy breakfast 
smoothie. Each packs a lot of soluble and insoluble fiber. Pectin in apples can lead to a 
reduction in the body’s need for insulin. Apples are also rich in quercetin, a flavonoid 
that fights inflammation and oxidation in the body.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: 0 min
Yield: 4 servings
2 organic apples, unpeeled, chopped
2 organic pears, unpeeled, chopped
1 frozen organic banana, peeled
1 cup freshly squeezed orange juice
1/2 cup nonfat organic yogurt
2 tablespoons organic honey
1/2 teaspoon stevia
3 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice
1 teaspoon cinnamon
2 tablespoons ground flaxseed
1 cup ice made from filtered water
 1 Combine all ingredients in a heavy-duty blender or food processor. Process or blend 
until mixture is smooth. Immediately pour into chilled glasses and serve.

T Butternut Squash and Rice Stew
Any root vegetable or squash that’s brightly colored, like pumpkin, sweet potatoes, car-
rots, or butternut squash, is packed with carotenoids and beta-carotenes, as well as 
fiber. These nutrients help protect your body from disease. The slow cooker is a 
healthy cooking method. When cooked at low temperatures, foods do not develop 
advanced glycation end products, or AGEs. These compounds are formed when sugars, 
protein, and fat are combined at high heat. They irritate cells in your body and may 
increase your risk for heart disease and diabetes.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 9 hours 45 minutes
Yield: 6 servings
2 organic onions, peeled and chopped
4 cloves organic garlic, peeled and minced
2 pounds butternut squash, peeled, seeded, and 
cubed
2 organic carrots, sliced
1 organic Granny Smith apple, peeled, cored, and 
cubed
3 cups filtered water
2 cups organic pear juice
1 cup freshly squeezed orange juice
2 tablespoons organic mustard
1 teaspoon dried basil leaves
3 sprigs fresh rosemary
3/4 cup long grain organic brown rice
2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice
1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/8 teaspoon black pepper
 1 In 5-quart slow cooker, place onions, garlic, squash, and carrots. Place apple on top. 
Add water and pear juice.
 2 In small bowl, combine orange juice with mustard and basil; whisk until smooth and stir 
into slow cooker.
 3 Add rosemary, and then cover and cook on low for 8–9 hours until vegetables are 
tender.
 4 Add rice, lemon juice, and peppers; remove rosemary stems. Cover and cook on high 
55–65 minutes until rice is tender.

Boosting Your 
Immune System
In This Chapter
▶ Staying away from toxins that wear on your immune system
▶ Detoxifying to boost your immunity
▶ Getting nutrients you need to thwart sickness
▶ Supplementing to help support your immune system
▶ Trying out a few immune-enhancing (and delicious) recipes
Your immune system is truly a wonder. It’s a vast, complex system 
with all kinds of unique, specialized parts that work together to keep 
your body from being overrun with foreign invaders like bacteria, viruses, 
parasites, toxins, and cancer. When it’s healthy, your immune system can 
do some mind-boggling things. When it’s not healthy, however, it can break 
down easily and allow you to fall victim to the harmful things that are around 
us all the time.
With that in mind, you should be very happy to know that you have quite a 
lot of control over the health of your immune system. Most people don’t give 
their immunity much thought until they get sick, but we all should be mindful 
of our immune systems and do whatever is possible to keep things running at 
a high level. The best way to avoid illness is to stay healthy.
In this chapter, I fill you in on many of the toxic threats that bombard your 
immune system and can make it difficult for your body to effectively prevent 
and fight disease. I also lead you through the ways that you can avoid these 
toxins and detoxify your body if some of the nasty substances have already 
found their way inside you. A top-notch immune system isn’t possible with-
out good nutrition, so I clue you in on the foods and supplements you can 
select to keep your immune function at its best. Finally, I wrap up the chap-
ter with some tasty, easy recipes for dishes you can make to provide your 
immune system with the healthy fuel it needs to perform its critical job.

Avoiding Toxins that Challenge 
Your Immune System
Like so many other things in life, your immune system will eventually break 
down if it’s overworked for a long period of time. If your body is exposed 
to harmful, foreign influences like organisms or chemicals in amounts that 
exceed what your immune system can handle, disease will be the result.
As I mention many times throughout this book, the environment around you 
has reached an unprecedented level of toxicity in the last few decades. The 
vast amounts of toxic threats that come at you from all sides are more than 
enough to overwhelm your immune system. Some people would disagree, of 
course, but in my opinion the toxic threat has become the most significant 
health hazard of our time.
In this section, I give you a concise but rounded view of the various types of 
toxins that can give your immune system fits. Just like the toxins I describe in 
other chapters, these will do the least amount of damage to your body’s sys-
tems if you’re aware of them and able to avoid them in your daily life.
Biologic toxins
On an average day, you’re exposed to millions of microscopic organisms that 
can potentially do your body harm. Many of these tiny creatures could have 
a seriously negative effect on your health if they ended up in your body in 
large quantities, so you should consider yourself lucky to have some lines 
of defense set up that stop most of the onslaught before it gets into your 
bloodstream or internal tissues. These defenses include your skin, which 
repels quite a lot of microorganisms, and also your stomach acid, which kills 
off many of the living things that enter your body when you eat, drink, or 
breathe.
Some microscopic cells are able to penetrate those first lines of defense, 
however, and that’s when your immune system saves the day. If you can keep 
your immune system healthy and make sure it isn’t completely overwhelmed 
by the critters I describe in the next couple pages, it will prevent those organ-
isms from congregating and multiplying in your body. If your immune system 
persists, you continue to live a healthy life. If it breaks down and the organ-
isms get a foothold in your body, they will soon begin to invade your tissues, 
reproduce in large quantities, and produce chemical toxins that keep over-
loading your immune system to cause infection and disease.

155
 Chapter 10: Boosting Your Immune System
 
We all know that in order to avoid coming into contact with dangerous micro-
organisms, we should stay away from sick people and avoid eating or drinking 
foods and liquids that have clearly gone rancid. But you can also take many 
other steps to prevent yeast, bacteria, and parasites from invading your body.
Yucky yeast
Yeast cells are on and in your body all the time, and you can’t do much about 
that. They’re simply too tiny, numerous, and common in your environment 
for you to keep every last cell away from you. And that’s okay. A few yeast 
cells here and there both inside and outside your body are just fine. If you 
can keep them in check, they won’t give you any problems.
The real trouble starts when yeast cells are able to increase their numbers to 
the point that as a group they’re big enough to negatively affect you. Yeast 
and the byproducts that yeast cells create can cause all manner of nasty 
effects in your body; check out Chapter 2 for details.
How can you avoid giving yeast cells room to run in your body? You want to 
dodge several scenarios:
 
✓ Too much sugar in your diet: Yeast cells thrive on sugars and simple 
carbohydrates, so keep those to a minimum in order to keep yeasts 
under control.
 
✓ Excessive use of antibiotics: Just one round of antibiotics is enough to 
kill 80 percent of the good bacteria in your intestines, which creates all 
kinds of room for yeast cells to flourish. Make sure you use antibiotics 
only when necessary.
 
✓ Anything that slows down or speeds up your bowels: If the food your 
intestines are trying to digest moves through too slowly or too quickly, 
the normal bacteria in there can be disrupted, and yeast cells are given 
the chance to multiply rapidly. Staying regular with a healthy detox diet 
helps you avoid the problem.
 
✓ Use of certain medications: Any medication or over-the-counter product 
that can cause harm to the lining of your stomach or your intestines can 
do enough damage to give yeast a foothold in your body. Chemotherapy, 
radiation, and long-term use of steroids can have the same effect. Even 
common anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen or aspirin can cause 
enough disruption to allow yeast overgrowth.
 
If you want to discourage the overgrowth of harmful yeast cells in your body, 
you can take Saccharomyces probiotics. Saccharomyces is actually a type of 
yeast, but it’s a good yeast that behaves itself in your body, and it can help to 
keep the harmful yeasts under control. You can find Saccharomyces in cap-
sule form at your health food store, likely for less than $20 per bottle. Try to 
take Saccharomyces anytime you have an infection that requires you to take 
antibiotics.

156
Part III: Enhancing Wellness through Detoxification 
Bad bacteria
Like yeasts, bacteria are on and in us all the time, including the kinds of bac-
teria that can cause infections. The trick is that they’re present in extremely 
small numbers, and they don’t start being harmful unless they’re given the 
chance to multiply. You want to keep several things in mind to make sure 
the bacteria around you don’t get enough momentum to grow in number and 
challenge your immune system on a dangerous level. Here goes:
 
✓ Wash your hands and bathe regularly. I know this is some pretty basic 
advice, but I can’t stress enough the importance of washing your hands — 
especially before you eat anything — and bathing on a regular basis. If 
you do these two things, you’ll greatly reduce the bacterial threat with-
out much effort at all.
 
✓ Wash your food. Of course, it doesn’t do you much good to wash your 
hands if bacteria are on your food. Fruits and vegetables should be 
washed thoroughly as soon as you get them home. Most people wait to 
wash until they’re going to eat their produce, but it’s better to wash it as 
soon as you get home from the store. Don’t let fruits and vegetables sit 
unwashed in the fridge or on the counter because that situation encour-
ages bacterial growth and also allows any toxins on the produce to con-
tinue to penetrate into the interior of the food.
 
✓ Cook meat thoroughly. If you eat meat, be sure it’s cooked all the 
way through. And don’t allow meat to sit at room temperature for any 
extended period of time.
 
✓ Maintain a healthy level of stomach acid. You need the right amount 
and strength of stomach acid to kill off the bacteria that could otherwise 
enter your body through your digestive system. To assure that your 
stomach acid is at the right levels, don’t take acid reducers unless you 
have documented high acid levels.
 
 If you have problems with acid reflux or ulcers, you need to see a doctor 
and be tested for H. pylori, a bacterium that causes many of these types 
of ailments. You also need to have your stomach acid level tested with 
the Heidelberg gastric analysis. Go to www.phcapsule.com/drref.
htm to find a physician who has this equipment and can do the testing.
 
✓ Avoid contaminated water. If your main source of water is a well, 
make sure you have it tested for the presence of dangerous bacteria. 
(Flip back to Chapter 3 for more information on how to get your water 
tested.) If you travel internationally, be sure to drink water that you 
know has been treated to kill bacteria and other microorganisms. 
(Bottled water may be your only option in these situations.)
 
 When you travel to another country, don’t assume that you can drink 
from a water source just because you see the locals drinking from it. 
People adapt to the bacteria where they live, and what is commonplace 
and not detrimental to the health of one person in one area could cause 
disease in another person.

 Chapter 10: Boosting Your Immune System
Pushy parasites
Parasites are nasty little critters that use you as a home, help themselves 
to your resources, and don’t offer anything helpful in return. Most of them 
aren’t so bad that they will kill you — after all, they’d sort of be shooting 
themselves in the foot because they’d be ruining their home. However, they 
can make you very sick, and they can push your immune system to its limits. 
Humans have always been exposed to parasites, and we still are today. 
People just don’t want to talk or think about it, and parasites are often one of 
the last things a doctor considers unless you really push the issue.
With international travel and immigration, people are exposed to a wider 
variety of parasites than ever before. If you travel abroad, be sure that the 
water you drink and ice you eat has been purified. Don’t eat raw vegetables 
or fruit unless you’re sure that they have been peeled, washed with purified 
water, or thoroughly cooked.
 
Natural bodies of water are often loaded with parasites, and you don’t have 
to drink the water to catch them; swimming in the water can be enough to 
catch the bug. Having pets that spend time both inside and outside the house 
can also increase your exposure to parasites; you can contract several para-
sites just as easily as your cat or dog would. Getting tested for parasites is 
extremely uncommon, but most people wouldn’t dream of not getting their 
pets wormed every year. What’s wrong with this picture?
Because testing for parasites is uncommon, patients often figure out they’re 
harboring some sort of critter only after the symptoms have set in for a 
while. Parasites cause many different types of illnesses, and if you catch one, 
you can count on it being a constant drain on your immune system. I recom-
mend that you do a parasite cleanse every year. See the upcoming section 
“Destroying parasites” for details.
Environmental elements
The range and amount of environmental toxins that people are faced with 
today have exceeded the capability of many people’s bodies to carry 
out detoxification without any help. The result? Widespread disease. 
Environmental toxins like heavy metals and chemicals can be disastrous for 
your immune system, and you need to prioritize limiting your exposure to 
these substances and acting quickly to detoxify your body if you need to.
Heavy metals
Avoiding heavy metals is a long-term, difficult challenge, but it’s one that you 
should take on with enthusiasm if you’re committed to good health. Check 
out Chapter 2 for all the details on heavy metals, from the kinds that are 
increasingly prevalent (like mercury and lead) to the many problems they 
can cause in your system. Everyone needs to avoid heavy metals whenever 

158
Part III: Enhancing Wellness through Detoxification 
possible, but it’s absolutely imperative that children, pregnant women, and 
women who plan on getting pregnant do whatever they can to avoid and 
remove heavy metals.
Which metals are the hardest on your immune system? Here’s a helpful list 
of the most harmful heavy metals, along with the places you can encounter 
them if you’re not careful:
 
✓ Aluminum: A common metal found in some vaccines, antacids, cook-
ware, and antiperspirant.
 
✓ Antimony: Found in fire-retardant textiles like bedding.
 
✓ Arsenic: Present in some foods (chicken is a top offender), wood preser-
vatives, fuel oils, fertilizers, and weed killer.
 
✓ Barium: Often present in some ceramics, plastics, textiles, and fuel.
 
✓ Beryllium: Found in neon signs, bicycle wheels, and fishing rods.
 
✓ Bisthmuth: Present in many medicines used to treat stomach aches.
 
✓ Bromine: Often used as a disinfectant for swimming pools and hot tubs.
 
✓ Cadmium: Present in cigarettes, batteries, and refined foods.
 
✓ Lead: Found in old paint, tin cans, pewter, dust, ceramics, and insecti-
cides.
 
✓ Manganese: Sources include welding equipment and supplies.
 
✓ Mercury: Sources include amalgam fillings, fish and other types of sea-
food, flu vaccines, and high fructose corn syrup.
 
✓ Nickel: Present in tobacco, auto exhaust, fertilizer, and baking powder.
 
✓ Thallium: Found in metal alloys, rodenticides, and fireworks.
For a thorough discussion on how you can avoid these heavy metals, flip 
back to Chapter 3.
Chemicals
Avoiding toxic chemicals is no easy task, but if you make a concerted effort, 
your immune system will be much better off. Chemical toxins harm and kill 
many of our bodies’ cells, and the dynamic cells that make up your immune 
system are especially fragile and prone to being killed or rendered useless by 
chemical toxins. Here are a few tips for cutting toxic chemicals out of your life:
 
✓ Don’t use toxic cleaning products in your home. Plenty of non-toxic 
options are available online and at your local health food store, and they 
will get your house just as clean as their harsh chemical counterparts. 
Vodka in a spray bottle is a good option (one spray for the countertop 
and one for the tonsils!).

 Chapter 10: Boosting Your Immune System
 
✓ Avoid using products with fragrances. These include room sprays, 
dryer sheets, carpet deodorizing powders, and even some candles.
 
 Many candles have wicks that contain lead. If you use candles in your 
home, be sure to choose lead-free options when buying.
 
✓ Reduce your exposure to fumes. If you’re working with substances that 
produce fumes, make sure you’re doing so for only short periods of time 
and in a well-ventilated space. This includes paint!
 
✓ Wash all your fruits and vegetables thoroughly. Your best bet is to do 
so as soon as you bring them home from the store.
 
✓ Purify your air. Invest in a good HEPA air purifier to cut down on the 
airborne toxins that you inhale while indoors.
Removing Toxins for Better 
Immune Response
The previous section is all about how to identify and avoid the toxins that 
can damage your immune system. Unfortunately, no matter how vigilant you 
are about dodging toxins, you’ll likely still end up with them in your system 
just because those materials are now so abundant. That’s why this sec-
tion focuses on the detoxification of immune-damaging materials from your 
system.
Different methods of detoxification work best for different toxins, so you 
may have to take a multi-pronged attack. But the good news is that almost all 
toxins can be removed, so even if your toxicity is pretty high you can start 
now to correct the situation. (If you need help figuring out how toxic you are, 
check out the quiz in Chapter 8.)
 
You may have a hard time getting motivated to change your routine and diet 
or to take supplements to treat a problem that isn’t always blatantly obvious. 
Finding motivation is even more difficult because traditional medicine doesn’t 
focus much on toxicity. (In many cases doctors don’t even test for toxicity 
when trying to diagnose an illness.) The challenge for you is to recognize the 
toxins that are in your body now and to take an active role in your detoxifica-
tion. No one else is going to do it for you.
Saying goodbye to living toxins
Earlier in this chapter I explain how you can avoid letting yeast, bacteria, 
and parasites enter your body and put a strain on your immune system. But 
chances are you already have some of these living toxins in your body, and 
you need to get rid of them if you want your immune function to be tip-top.

Part III: Enhancing Wellness through Detoxification 
Killing yeasts
Yeasts are very aggressive in the body when they have a steady stream of 
simple carbohydrates and sugar to feast on, so the first thing you should do 
to limit yeast growth is to cut out as many of those materials from your diet 
as possible. Taking out most of the sugar from your diet will starve the yeast 
cells, which can go a long way toward slashing their numbers down to man-
ageable levels. You can also take a variety of natural products that kill yeast, 
including grapefruit seed, black walnut hull extract, slippery elm bark, gold-
enseal root extract, and bearberry leaf. I also recommend trying the antifun-
gal drugs Nystatin or Diflucan and using them for about three weeks. (You’ll 
need a doctor’s prescription.) That usually does the trick.
Eliminating bacteria
High levels of harmful bacteria in your colon can produce a lot of toxins, and 
these toxins can strain your immune system in some pretty heinous ways 
and have direct effects on other organs like the brain. To remedy that kind 
of problem, try a colon cleanse followed by a concerted effort to repopulate 
your gut with good bacteria. (Have a look at Chapter 5 for details on how to 
carry out that process.) If that method fails, sometimes it may be necessary 
to use antibiotics. If that’s the case, ask your doctor to prescribe oral antibi-
otics that don’t get absorbed into your bloodstream but instead do all their 
killing right in the intestines.
Destroying parasites
Parasites can be extremely pesky, but natural solutions can take care of the 
problem. Ask at your health food store for natural products that contain 
black walnut husks, wormwood, Pau D’Arco, garlic, pumpkin seed, ginger 
root, clove, and gentian root. Keep in mind that if natural alternatives don’t 
do the trick, you can always fall back on a few old and very safe prescription 
drugs like Vermox and Biltricide for killing parasites.
Giving chemicals and heavy 
metals the heave-ho
Toxic chemicals and heavy metals are bound to damage your immune 
system, so you should take action to remove these substances from your 
body. A range of helpful detox methods is available, and they are treatments 
available to everyone — nothing too exotic or expensive.
 
Everyone should be interested in removing from their bodies toxins that com-
promise immune health. But at the very top of the list are children and women 
who are trying to get pregnant.

161
 Chapter 10: Boosting Your Immune System
 
If you are in good health and you’re just getting started on a detoxification reg-
imen to rid your body of the toxins that affect the immune system, consider 
doing a two-day water fast, meaning that you eat nothing and drink only water 
for two full days. Doing so is easier than you think, and it’s useful for cleaning 
out your body and giving your natural detoxification mechanisms a little bit of 
a rest before you shift them into high gear for your detox push. Just make sure 
you have a reliably clean, toxin-free water source before you get started.
Getting help from herbs and foods
You can eat a variety of herbs and foods to help your body fight and get rid 
of the toxins that are harmful to your immune system. Many of these options 
are excellent for general health, too, so you certainly won’t be giving anything 
up in terms of nutrition if you work to include a range of them in your diet.
 
One of the most important dietary considerations for detoxifying your body 
against toxic threats to your immune system is your daily intake of fiber. If 
you get plenty of fiber in your diet, your body has an easier time eliminating 
the toxins in your digestive system that have been broken down or removed 
from your blood by your liver. Do your best to incorporate fiber into your diet 
whenever possible.
Here are some of the best herbs and foods for detoxification of the heavy 
metals and chemicals that can harm your immune system:
 
✓ Sulfur-containing foods: These include eggs, garlic, and onions.
 
✓ Fresh vegetables juices: Beet, carrot, and celery juices are three of the 
top varieties.
 
✓ Cruciferous vegetables: Focus on broccoli, Brussels sprouts, kale, and 
cabbage.
 
✓ Dandelion greens: These should be available at your grocery store, and 
you can probably even find a 100 percent organic variety. If not, try a 
health food store.
 
✓ Green tea: I mention this one in several other chapters as well. It’s a 
detoxification powerhouse!
 
✓ Other types of tea: You can see benefits from tea made from cinnamon 
bark, licorice root, ginger root, and burdock root.
 
✓ Rosemary: This excellent herb helps increase your body’s natural detox-
ification enzymes.
 
✓ Cilantro: It actually works to pull heavy metals from your tissues. Eat it 
fresh or buy a tincture from your health food store and follow the direc-
tions on the label.

162
Part III: Enhancing Wellness through Detoxification 
 
✓ Chlorella: Like cilantro, this green algae acts to flush heavy metals from 
your body. Find it at your local health food store or online.
 
✓ Fruits: Some of the best options include grapes, berries, and citrus 
fruits.
 
If you’re trying to eat certain herbs and foods to detoxify your body, you’d 
really be wasting your time if you were choosing options that contain toxins. 
To make sure that doesn’t happen, get 100 percent organic foods and supple-
ments whenever possible.
Seeking out suitable supplements
You can also use several different kinds of supplements to help you rid your 
body of chemical and heavy metal toxins. First, make sure that you’re taking 
a high potency, high quality multivitamin to cover all the basic vitamins and 
minerals. (Check out Chapter 5 for a general discussion of how to pick out 
your supplements.) After you have that important step taken care of, you can 
focus on selecting some other supplements to help you clear out the toxins 
that can bombard your immune system. Here are some of the top examples, 
along with the dosages you need to achieve the desired effect: 
 
✓ Alpha-lipoic acid: 100–600 mg per day
 
✓ Amino acids: 1,000 mg of both glycine and taurine per day
 
✓ Carnitine: 1–3 grams per day
 
✓ Mixed carotenoids: 15,000–25,000 units per day
 
✓ Molybdenum: 50–200 micrograms per day
 
✓ N-acetylcysteine: 500–1,000 mg per day
 
✓ Omega-3 essential fatty acids: 1–4 grams per day
 
✓ Resveratrol: 30 mg per day
 
✓ Selenium: 200 micrograms per day
 
✓ Silymarin: 50–200 mg per day
 
✓ Vitamin C: 2–4 grams per day
 
✓ Zinc: 30–50 mg per day
I know this may seem like a long list, but remember that you’re trying to 
change the way your body functions on a very basic level to enhance toxin 
removal. Doing so takes a lot of effort, but the result — a robust immune 
system — is worth it!

163
 Chapter 10: Boosting Your Immune System
Catching toxins with chelation
If you have a heavy load of heavy metals in your system and they’re damag-
ing your immune system, you may need to step up your detoxification efforts 
beyond food, herbs, and supplements. The next step is chelation, and it can 
really save the day.
Chelation involves taking a medication that’s designed to attract and attach 
to heavy metals and then remove them through your urine. Chelating agents 
have been used for over 60 years and are extremely safe and efficient in 
removing heavy metals. I won’t get into the chelation details here, but you 
can flip to Chapter 18 for a full rundown if you’re interested.
Sweating out the heavy metals
Sweating is one of the most important ways to detox the body, and you can 
actually accomplish a useful amount of heavy metal detoxification by simply 
sweating through everyday activity and exercise. Sweating removes one-third 
as many toxins as your kidneys, and many of the toxins that sweating elimi-
nates aren’t removed effectively by any other means of detoxification. If you 
sweat out some of the heavy metals that plague your immune system, you 
can improve the health of your entire body. I encourage you to embrace that 
kind of sweating and make it part of your normal routine.
If you want to really increase the amount of heavy metals you eliminate from 
your system through sweating, you can always take advantage of saunas. 
You can use several types of saunas year-round to bolster your heavy metal 
detoxification. The most common types are wet, dry, and infrared. I cover all 
the details in Chapter 18, so if you’re interested, grab a towel and a tall glass 
of clean water and get ready to sweat it out!
Using Nutrition to Bolster Immunity
Your immune system is a complex machine, and if you want to keep it 
healthy you need to get a range of important nutritional elements. But you 
can also go the extra mile and tweak your diet in a few key ways to ensure 
that your immunity is at its very best. That’s what I encourage you to do in 
this section: Go beyond the basic requirements and shoot for the type of diet 
that can really make your immune system shine.
Picking foods to help thwart disease
I put a lot of emphasis on the importance of the food you choose to eat, and 
I’m certainly not changing my tune when it comes to keeping your immune 
system healthy. Eating the right foods can give you a leg up on robust immu-
nity, and avoiding a few lousy foods can go just as far.

164
Part III: Enhancing Wellness through Detoxification 
What you need to eat
First off, see to it that you’re getting the following minerals and amino acids, 
which are very important in maintaining a high performance immune system:
 
✓ Iron: Low iron levels cause increased retention of the harmful heavy 
metal toxins aluminum, lead, and cadmium. You can get iron in beef, 
turkey, sardines, oysters, clams, shrimp, beans, lentils, and pumpkin 
seeds.
 
✓ L-cysteine: This amino acid is a key player in boosting your body’s abil-
ity to detoxify itself. Make sure you get plenty of it in your diet! You’ll 
find it in chicken, turkey, eggs, yogurt, garlic, onions, red peppers, broc-
coli, and Brussels sprouts.
 
✓ Selenium: If you don’t get enough selenium, your body is more likely 
to retain mercury, which is one of the worst toxins known to man. 
Selenium is found in garlic, grains, shellfish, salmon, sunflower seeds, 
walnuts, ginseng, onions, and chives.
 
✓ Zinc: Don’t skimp on the zinc or you’ll make it harder for your body’s 
natural detoxification efforts to clear out a range of heavy metals. Look 
for zinc in beef, lamb, turkey, chicken, and shellfish.
 
Also keep in mind that virtually any deficiency of vitamins or essential fatty 
acids has a negative impact on your immune system. Make sure you’re getting 
what you need on those fronts — you can read more in Chapters 5 and 17 — 
and you’ll give your body the firm foundation it needs to maintain health and 
fight disease.
Be sure to eat plenty of antioxidant-rich foods. Strive to include foods that 
are loaded with alpha-lipoic acid, beta-carotene, omega-3 fatty acids, resvera-
trol, sulforaphane, vitamin C, and vitamin E. These are essential substances 
for a bombastic immune system, and you can get them from the following 
food sources:
 
✓ Alpha-lipoic acid: This antioxidant supports the liver’s detoxification 
function. Find it in nuts, seeds, broccoli, leafy green vegetables, grains, 
hempseed oil, flaxseed oil, and virgin unhydrogenated coconut oil.
 
✓ Beta-carotene: Eat fruits and vegetables that are orange in color, such as 
sweet potatoes, carrots, mangoes, apricots, and spinach. (Okay, I know 
that last one isn’t orange, but it can’t all be color-coded, can it?)
 
✓ Omega-3 fatty acids: Fish and grass-fed beef are good sources.
 
✓ Resveratrol: This substance is one of many reasons to eat your broccoli.
 
✓ Sulforaphane: This is one of the best antioxidants ever found. You get 
sulforaphane from broccoli and broccoli sprouts, but 90 percent is 
destroyed if you cook it.

165
 Chapter 10: Boosting Your Immune System
 
✓ Vitamin C: Citrus fruits, green and red peppers, Brussels sprouts, and 
broccoli are great sources.
 
✓ Vitamin E: Find it in safflower, corn, and canola oils, as well as wheat 
germ and sunflower seeds.
Healthy immunity also depends on a good, steady source of protein in your 
diet. Two of the most beneficial amino acids for giving your immune system a 
boost and fighting disease are glutamine and arginine. Find them in eggs, lean 
beef, chicken, and turkey.
What you need to avoid eating
Trans fats are inflammatory, and saturated fats are loaded with toxins. They 
decrease the effectiveness of your immune system. You should be making 
every effort to cut them out of your diet anyway, but you can feel extra good 
about waving goodbye to them when you realize that in addition to increas-
ing your cardiovascular health and decreasing your toxin intake, you’re also 
helping your body to fight disease. All that, and you only have to give up a 
couple of nasty types of fat? Not a bad deal at all.
Figuring out what to eat 
if you’re already sick
You could eat the best foods and maintain the healthiest lifestyle and still get 
sick. There’s no escaping the fact that we live in a world full of viruses, bac-
teria, and toxins that can make us ill, and eventually your immune system is 
going to get overwhelmed and you’ll get sick. When that happens, you should 
maintain your healthy lifestyle and continue to eat the wholesome, natural 
foods that I describe throughout this chapter (and elsewhere in the book). 
But you can also do a few other things to help your immune system fight off 
the intruders that are causing your ailment:
 
✓ Ramp up the antioxidants: Antioxidants are great at helping your 
immune system fight illness, and if you eat them when you’re sick you 
should get well faster. (If you take them all the time, you may not get 
sick at all.) Flip to Chapter 5 for lots of information on how to select 
foods that are packed with antioxidants.
 
✓ Load up on vitamin C: When you’re sick, you should take vitamin C up 
to bowel tolerance. That’s the level at which the vitamin C causes loose 
stool, and of course you don’t want to do that to yourself, especially 
when you’re sick. Bowel tolerance for adults is about 8,000 to 10,000 mg 
per day. (The amounts are lower for children, of course.) To get that 
much vitamin C in your diet when you’re sick, try to eat as many vitamin 
C–rich foods as you can (I list a few in this chapter) and take supple-
ments to make up the difference.

166
Part III: Enhancing Wellness through Detoxification 
 
✓ Get lots of vitamin E and selenium: These substances can also be 
extremely beneficial when you’re sick, especially for viral and upper 
respiratory infections.
 
✓ Drink water — and lots of it: When you’re sick, it’s hugely important that 
you drink lots and lots of water. In Chapter 5 I explain your lymph system, 
which is almost like a second circulatory system that helps to flush toxins, 
bacteria, and viruses from your body. If you’re extremely well hydrated, 
your lymph system has what it needs to flush out those harmful materials 
faster and more efficiently than if you’re not drinking enough water.
 
 Your immune and lymph systems desperately need lots of water to work 
properly and make you well, so make sure you’re giving those important 
systems what they require. Drink up! (And make sure the water is puri-
fied and toxin-free, of course.)
Choosing Supplements that 
Boost Your Immunity
Boosting the immune system’s function with vitamin and herbal supplements 
is a practice that has been going on for thousands of years. If you choose 
your supplements wisely, you can really enhance your body’s ability to keep 
itself healthy and running smoothly, which in turn makes it much more adept 
at fighting off illnesses. In today’s toxic world, I believe that everyone should 
supplement to maintain a robust immune system. With just a little extra 
effort, you can defeat disease before it gets started. You know what they say 
about an ounce of prevention.
How to deal with diarrhea
When some people get diarrhea, they immedi-
ately reach for some over-the-counter or pre-
scription drug that is designed to patch up the 
problem and allow them to have solid stools 
again. That’s not the healthiest move. When you 
get diarrhea, it’s a crystal clear sign that your 
body is trying to get rid of something. Your colon 
is essentially stealing water from the rest of your 
body to liquefy the contents of your bowels and 
move them out as quickly as possible. When you 
get diarrhea, don’t reach for a bottle of medicine 
right away. Let your colon do its job!
The best treatment for most types of diarrhea is 
to drink lots and lots of water and let the diar-
rhea run its course. If you work hard to stay 
hydrated, your colon will eventually clear out 
the harmful substances that are making you 
sick. After the toxic contents are out of your 
body, the diarrhea should stop. One caveat: If 
your diarrhea lasts for several days, the prob-
lem could be something that your colon isn’t 
able to handle on its own, so you may need to 
consult your doctor.

167
 Chapter 10: Boosting Your Immune System
One quick note: Don’t confuse this information on immune system–boosting 
supplements with the information I provide earlier in the chapter on supple-
ments that you can take to help your body detoxify itself when you’ve taken 
in toxins that threaten your immune system. The suggestions overlap some-
what, but there are key differences, as well.
Vitamins and minerals
If you’re on a good daily multivitamin regimen, you’re more than likely giving 
your immune system much of what it needs to flourish.
 
Be wary of a multivitamin that purports to provide you with all the vita-
mins and minerals you need in one capsule or tablet a day; if it really had 
everything you need in one dose, the pill would be as big as a golf ball. Most 
comprehensive multivitamins require several capsules a day. Four is a very 
common number and a good one for you to start with. Ask the experts at your 
local health food or vitamin store for a recommendation.
In addition to your multivitamin, you can take the following to boost your 
immune system’s function. The abbreviation IU stands for international units: 
a measurement of biological activity that is established for each substance so 
that different products can be compared.
 
✓ Beta-carotene or vitamin A: 25,000 IU per day
 
✓ Magnesium: 600–1,200 mg per day
 
✓ Vitamin C: 2,000–4,000 mg per day
 
✓ Vitamin D3: 2,000–5,000 IU per day
 
✓ Vitamin E: 400–800 IU per day
 
✓ Zinc: 20–40 mg per day
Herbs and other supplements
Quality herbal supplements can greatly enhance your immune function. 
The quality and potency of the supplement is very important, so be sure to 
read the section in Chapter 5 that discusses how you can select high-quality 
supplements.
One immune-boosting supplement that has recently shown quite a bit of 
promise is sulforaphane, which is an extract of broccoli seeds. It enhances 
your immune system and has even shown some interesting results in fighting 
and preventing cancer.

168
Part III: Enhancing Wellness through Detoxification 
You should also consider taking a supplement that contains concentrated 
antioxidants, which are extracted from multiple vegetables. These supple-
ments are sold under different names but are usually called greens. You’ll 
probably find them in powder form; check the shelves of your favorite health 
food shop or vitamin store.
 
When you’re buying the supplements called greens, pay special attention to 
the ORAC number. You don’t need to know the technical details of what that 
number means or how it’s calculated, but just make sure the product you 
choose has an ORAC of at least 20,000 per scoop. That’s the same as the anti-
oxidant capacity of 15 servings of vegetables!
Here are a few other supplements you can take to gear up your immune 
system:
 
✓ Arginine: 3,000 mg per day
 
✓ Garlic: 600–1,000 mg per day
 
✓ Glutamate: 3,000 mg per day
 
✓ Selenium: 200 micrograms per day

Gingered Roasted Salmon 
 
with Berry Salsa
Berries are some of the best foods you can eat. They’re very high in antioxidants, espe-
cially anthocyanins and flavonoids, and vitamin C, which helps support the immune 
system. In a recent study, blueberries were at the top of the list for best foods to eat for 
detoxification. Paired with smooth and nutty roasted salmon, this is a dish you’ll want 
to eat again and again.
Wheat germ is very high in vitamin E, which helps the body defend against oxidation. 
Vitamin E may also reduce the risk of some kinds of cancers. Wheat germ is crunchy, 
nutty, and delicious. Store wheat germ in the refrigerator because the oils are delicate 
and perishable.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: 25 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
1 cup organic blueberries
1/2 cup dried organic cranberries
1 cup organic blackberries
2 tablespoons organic honey
1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger root
1/2 teaspoon anise seeds
1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar
1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
1 pound wild Alaska salmon fillets
2 tablespoons organic honey
White pepper, to taste
1/4 cup grated fresh ginger root
3 cloves organic garlic, peeled and minced
1/3 cup organic wheat germ
 1 In medium bowl, combine blueberries, cranberries, and blackberries. In small bowl, 
combine 2 tablespoons honey, 1 tablespoon ginger root, anise seeds, vinegar, and red 
pepper flakes. Combine this mixture with the berries; mix well and set aside.
 2 Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Place salmon fillets on baking sheet, brush with 2 table-
spoons honey and sprinkle with some white pepper. Combine 1/4 cup ginger root and 
minced garlic with wheat germ and pat on top of the salmon.
 3 Roast salmon for 18–24 minutes until just barely done in center. Salmon should flake 
easily when tested with a fork. Serve with the berry salsa on the side.

T Mixed Green Salad with 
 
Green Tea Dressing
When you buy leafy greens, look for the darkest you can find. Darker greens (and vege-
tables, too) have more vitamins A, C, and K. These nutritious foods may help prevent 
some kinds of cancers, and they’re a boon for your immune system. Green tea is full of 
antioxidants, too, including catechin, a compound that increases liver function.
You may find that this delicious recipe becomes part of your regular rotation.
Preparation time: 35 minutes
Cooking time: 0 minutes
Yield: 6 servings
1/4 cup green tea leaves
1/4 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice

Berry Currant Chicken Salad
Chicken salad is a true comfort food. The combination of tender chicken with sweet and 
tart fruits is so good you won’t believe it’s good for you, too!
Black currants are very rich in vitamin C. It may be difficult to find them in regular gro-
cery stores; look for them in organic and health food stores or order online. If you can’t 
find them, the juice made from the black currant is a good substitute.
Borage seed oil is concentrated in GLA (gamma-linolenic acid), which your body con-
verts into prostaglandins, increasing your immune strength. The oil can also ensure you 
have the right amounts of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids in your body.
Preparation time: 30 minutes
Cooking time: 20 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 cup organic black currant juice
1/4 teaspoon stevia
1 teaspoon organic borage seed oil
2 tablespoons flaxseed oil
3 tablespoons organic vegetable oil
1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar
1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper
4 organic boneless, skinless chicken breasts
1 cup filtered water
1 cup organic black currants or red currants, 
rinsed
1/2 cup organic dried cranberries
1 cup organic raspberries
3 cups mixed organic dark leafy greens
 1 In small bowl, combine juice, stevia, borage seed oil, flaxseed oil, vegetable oil, vinegar, 
and cayenne pepper; mix well and refrigerate.
 2 Place chicken in skillet; pour water over. Bring to a simmer over medium heat. Reduce 
heat to low, cover, and poach chicken 12–17 minutes until just done. Place chicken in 
bowl; pour half of the poaching liquid over and let cool 20 minutes.
 3 Remove chicken from liquid and cut into large chunks. Mix with currant dressing and 
place in serving bowl. Add currants, cranberries, and raspberries and toss gently. Serve 
on the dark leafy greens.

O
ne of the most common health complaints is 
a lack of energy. So many people are tired, and they just don’t feel like 
they have the get-up-and-go that’s necessary to keep up with their busy lives. 
If you’re suffering from a lack of energy, take heart in the fact that you’re not 
alone, and rest assured that you can take steps to improve your energy level 
and put that much needed pep in your step.
Many complicated biologic states can cause a lack of energy, but a few issues 
are really common and can be fixed with conventional medicine, natural 
therapies that involve detoxification, or a combination of both. Two of the 
top issues are thyroid problems and blood sugar problems, both of which I 
cover in this chapter.
Amazingly enough, the bacteria that you carry around in your gastrointes-
tinal tract can also contribute to a lack of energy. You have more bacterial 
cells in your gut than in all other parts of your body combined. When the 
delicate balance of that bacteria is disturbed, several of your organ systems 
can be affected, and profound fatigue is a common result. The good news is 
that you can take steps to make sure that the balance of the bacteria in your 
intestines is right where it needs to be, and you may be surprised how much 
of a positive effect that change can have on your energy level. The bad news 
is that you’ll have to put some thought into what’s living in your belly, which 
can rank pretty high on the gross-out scale.
So if you’ve been feeling low on energy, hang in there and summon the zeal 
to flip through the pages of this chapter. You’ll be doing back flips in no time! 
(Okay, maybe you’ll just be energized and ready to get up and go each day — 
you’ll have to find another book for the back flip instructions.)

Part III: Enhancing Wellness through Detoxification 
Taking a Look at Your Thyroid
Your energy level is determined by your metabolism, which is controlled 
by hormones that your thyroid gland produces. If your thyroid is acting up, 
chances are you’re seeing some pretty dramatic effects in your energy level.
If you’re incredibly tired or wired all the time, you could very well have a 
thyroid problem and you should make an appointment to see your doctor. (If 
you’re in need of a doctor or in the market for a new one, flip back to Chapter 
5 for some tips on how to find and work with good doctors who are well 
versed in natural treatments like detoxification.) If you’ve already been diag-
nosed with a thyroid ailment and you’re weighing your options for treatment 
(or already receiving conventional treatment), you may want to consider aug-
menting your progress with detoxification.
In this section, I dig into the details of the toxins that can affect your thyroid 
gland and what you can do to rid your body of those toxins (and keep them 
out). I also offer a quick look at some of the things that your thyroid gland 
has to have in order to function correctly, and I let you know where to find 
those things in foods that fit in with a detoxification diet.
 
While I focus on the dangers of mercury and aspartame in this section, you 
should know that fluoride also affects your thyroid in a negative way. Fluoride 
can attach to thyroid hormone molecules and prevent them from working in 
your tissues, but the hormones will still be counted in the standard blood test 
for thyroid function. In other words, the thyroid test will show that you have 
plenty of thyroid hormone, but the hormone doesn’t work.
 
If your thyroid’s function is just a little out of whack, you can probably make 
quite a bit of progress toward remedying the problem with natural means 
(diet and supplements are a couple examples). But if your thyroid is seriously 
misbehaving, you need medical treatment. You need to consult with your 
doctor to determine whether your thyroid problem is a minor or major one.
Mastering mercury
When it comes to thyroid-damaging toxins, nothing is more harmful than 
mercury. Mercury basically makes it impossible for your thyroid gland to 
successfully produce good hormones, and without hormones from your thy-
roid, your metabolism is terribly slow and your energy level goes crashing 
through the floor.

175
 Chapter 11: Increasing Your Energy Level
In addition to being extremely damaging to your thyroid, mercury is also a 
particularly problematic toxin because it’s extremely powerful — the second 
most toxic substance on the planet, after plutonium — and it’s found all 
over the place in our environment. (I fill you in on the details shortly when I 
explain how you can work toward limiting your mercury exposure.) To give 
you an idea of how toxic mercury is, consider that the amount of mercury in 
an old glass thermometer is enough to poison a 26-acre lake.
 
If you want to enjoy healthy energy levels, you need a fully functioning thy-
roid. And if you want your thyroid to perform at its best, you need to rid your 
body of mercury.
Getting rid of the mercury in your body
You can choose among several good ways to get rid of the mercury in your 
body. At the top of the list is a process called chelation. Chelation is a detoxi-
fication method that involves introducing a substance into your body and 
allowing that substance to attach itself to toxins, which are then carried out 
of your body in urine or feces. Chelation is a precise procedure that must be 
performed by a doctor. (I cover plenty of chelation details in Chapter 18.) For 
eliminating mercury, the best chelating agent is DMPS, which is administered 
using an IV.
Considering an alternative thyroid test
Sometimes people suffering from low energy 
levels get a blood test — the standard test 
used to screen for thyroid problems — and the 
results indicate that their thyroid is normal. If 
that happens to you but your symptoms persist 
and you’re still not convinced that your thyroid 
is working like it should, you may want to check 
your thyroid’s function using the basal body 
temperature method. It’s a relatively easy pro-
cess that you can begin at home on your own.
 1. Get a basal thermometer. A basal thermom-
eter is a specialty thermometer used to 
measure human body temperature. You can 
buy one at your local drug store or through 
many online retailers.
 2. Measure your body temperature in your 
armpit as soon as you wake up — before 
you get out of bed — every day for ten days. 
Record the temperature measurement for 
each day.
 3. Average the temperatures. If your tem-
perature is where it should be, you’ll get an 
average of 97.2 to 98.2 degrees Fahrenheit.
 4. If your average temperature is below the 
range specified in step 3, consult a physi-
cian. You’ll need to make sure you find a 
physician who is willing to treat you for a 
thyroid problem based on symptoms and 
basal body temperature. A good source for 
these types of physicians is the American 
College for Advancement in Medicine 
(ACAM). You’ll also find that ACAM mem-
bers are more likely to treat you with natu-
ral methods and products.
You can find a listing of physician members 
of the American College for Advancement in 
Medicine at the organization’s Web site (www.
acamnet.org). You may also want to check 
out the Web site of the International College of 
Integrative Medicine (www.icimed.com).

176
Part III: Enhancing Wellness through Detoxification 
 
In addition to DMPS, DMSA is also used as a chelating agent for mercury. 
DMSA is administered orally, but there’s some debate among experts on 
whether or not DMSA can carry mercury into the brain.
If you’re not too keen on chelation, don’t dismay: You can use other methods 
to help eliminate mercury from your system on your own, at home. You can 
get started with a tincture of cilantro (also known as Chinese parsley), which 
is a solution made from the normal kitchen herb that you often find in salsa 
and pesto. You can buy tincture of cilantro at most vitamin stores. Tincture 
of cilantro mobilizes mercury, moving it to your liver where it’s deposited in 
your bile and then moved to the intestines.
That’s the first step, but if you stop there, your intestines will simply reab-
sorb the mercury and you’ll be back at square one. To prevent that from hap-
pening, you need a binding agent that will bond to the mercury and hold it in 
the intestines until it eventually works its way down your digestive system 
and out of the body in your feces. For mercury detoxification, the best bind-
ing agent is a green algae called chlorella that you can buy in powder form.
Here are the details for using tincture of cilantro and chlorella to help clear 
the mercury out of your body:
 
1. Take two drops of tincture of cilantro two times a day, and gradually 
increase the dosage over a period of days until you reach the point 
where you’re taking ten drops, three times each day. You can do this 
easily by making a simple tea with ten drops of the tincture mixed up in 
a cup of hot water. Take this dosage for a week, take a two-week break, 
and then do it for another week.
 
2. While you’re taking the tincture of cilantro, make sure you’re also 
using your chlorella. Start with one gram of powder four times a day 
and increase that amount to three grams, four times a day.
 
3. Continue taking the tincture of cilantro and chlorella on the alternat-
ing schedule (on for one week, off for two weeks) for six months.
 
If you get an upset stomach during the process of detoxifying with tincture of 
cilantro and chlorella, your first reaction may be to take less chlorella. Don’t 
do that! Instead, increase your dose of chlorella to three grams five times a 
day or more. Your upset stomach is a sign that you’re removing a lot of mer-
cury from your system, and you need more chlorella to keep that process 
moving in the right direction.
Steering clear of mercury exposure
After you’ve made an effort to get rid of the mercury in your body, what can 
you do to keep it out? Unfortunately, it’s not an easy task.

177
 Chapter 11: Increasing Your Energy Level
Despite the fact that mercury is one of the most toxic substances known to 
man, it’s surprisingly ubiquitous in the world today. If you’re striving to limit 
your mercury exposure — and you should be — you need to be aware of the 
following sources of mercury:
 
✓ Fish: If you include fish in your diet, chances are you’re also including 
mercury. Fish and the waters they inhabit are extremely susceptible to 
mercury contamination, and when fish are caught and eventually end 
up on your dinner table, the mercury is transferred to you. Because fish 
are native to and farm-raised in a variety of environments, the mercury 
levels in fish can vary widely. If you want to add fish to your dinner table 
but you’re not interested in also adding a dangerous toxin like mercury, 
try using Alaskan salmon, which generally contains less mercury than 
many other types of fish. You can also buy fish that has been analyzed 
and certified safe by independent lab testing.
 
 If you’re pregnant, be extremely cautious about eating fish. The mer-
cury risk is high: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently 
issued a warning for pregnant women that even one 3-ounce portion of 
swordfish, shark, king mackerel, or tilefish during the entire pregnancy 
can contain enough mercury to cause fetal brain damage.
 
✓ Flu vaccines: Vaccines for influenza have become increasingly popular 
in the past decade, but most doses of flu vaccine still contain mercury. 
A mercury-containing chemical called thiomersal (commonly called thi-
merosal) is used in vaccines as a preservative.
 
 Mercury-free flu vaccines are available in limited amounts each year, so 
if you’re planning to get vaccinated, ask your doctor about obtaining a 
vaccine that doesn’t contain mercury.
 
✓ Dental fillings: The amalgam fillings (commonly referred to incorrectly 
as silver fillings) used by dentists can contain up to 50 percent mercury. 
Many people in the dentistry community suggest that amalgam fillings are 
harmless, but in my opinion that’s hard to believe when you consider that 
the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requires that when dentists 
remove amalgam fillings they treat the material as toxic waste.
 
 If you need a filling, ask your dentist about alternatives to amalgam that 
don’t contain mercury. Several options are available, and the choice is 
yours!
 
✓ Coal: Coal contains mercury, but chances are you don’t often come in 
contact with coal. The problem arises when trillions of tons of coal are 
burned in coal-burning power plants across the globe each year, and the 
mercury that was contained in the coal is released into our atmosphere. 
The further you live from a coal-burning power plant the better, but if 
you’re like most people and you can’t let proximity to a power plant be 
the deciding factor when choosing where you live, consider using some 
of the air detoxification techniques I describe in Chapter 3.

178
Part III: Enhancing Wellness through Detoxification 
 
✓ Compact fluorescent light bulbs: In an effort to conserve energy, many 
people are now installing efficient compact fluorescent light bulbs in 
their homes and businesses. The bulbs are extremely energy efficient, 
but unfortunately they contain mercury. When you dispose of compact 
fluorescent bulbs, place them in a plastic bag with a tight seal and take 
them to a nearby household hazardous waste collection site.
 
 If a compact fluorescent bulb breaks, take special care to limit your mer-
cury exposure. The EPA suggests that you immediately open all nearby 
windows and carefully sweep up the pieces without touching them with 
your hands. Then use a paper towel to remove all of the broken glass — 
do not use a vacuum — and place everything in a sealed plastic bag for 
disposal at a household hazardous waste collection site. You can read 
more at www.epa.gov.
Assessing the risks of aspartame
The sugar substitute aspartame is used in a wide range of processed food 
products, from diet sodas to chewing gum, and unfortunately there have 
been numerous implications that aspartame can have some harmful effects 
on the human body.
It’s important to note here that aspartame was approved by the U.S. Food 
and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in food products. But anecdotal evi-
dence and some clinical studies have suggested that for at least a portion of 
the population, aspartame could be responsible for negative health effects. 
Some of the anecdotal evidence points to the fact that aspartame can cause 
or contribute to thyroid problems, so if you’re suffering from a thyroid ail-
ment you should consider taking action to reduce the amount of aspartame 
you’re introducing into your body. At the worst, you’re looking at a “can’t 
hurt, might help” scenario.
Detoxifying for aspartame
At this point, no detoxification methods focus specifically on removing aspar-
tame from your body. But you can see some related benefits by adding lots of 
high antioxidant foods to your diet. The following are just a few of the many 
kinds of foods that are loaded with antioxidants:
 
✓ Artichokes
 
✓ Blackberries
 
✓ Cranberries
 
✓ Pecans
 
✓ Russet potatoes
 
✓ Walnuts

179
 Chapter 11: Increasing Your Energy Level
Avoiding aspartame
You can dodge this substance by paying attention to what you’re eating. It’s 
simple: Just read the ingredient lists on food labels!
If you’re keen on sugar substitutes, I recommend trying stevia, which is a 
natural sweetener partly derived from a shrub that’s native to South America. 
It has been used as a sweetener in Japan for more than 30 years. You can find 
stevia at almost all heath food stores, and it comes in many forms.
Giving your thyroid what 
it needs to succeed
Your thyroid needs a few minerals in order do its important work. The list 
below shows you the minerals that are critical to healthy thyroid function 
and includes suggestions on the types of foods you can eat to make sure 
you’re getting enough of the important minerals.
 
✓ Iodine: Get iodine from sources like seafood (fish and shellfish) and sea 
vegetables (such as kelp, dulse, bladderwrack, and alaria).
 
 Many people get their iodine from iodized salt or from tap water. Be 
wary of both sources. Iodized salt usually has sugar added (dextrose) 
and can contain the toxin aluminum. And tap water has many toxic 
drawbacks, as you can read about in Chapter 3.
 
✓ Copper: Your thyroid needs copper, and you can make sure you’re get-
ting enough copper in your diet by eating plenty of eggs, legumes, nuts, 
and raisins. And no, you can’t just toss in a handful of pennies with your 
garden salad.
 
✓ Zinc: Zinc is important for maintain healthy thyroid function. You can 
boost the amount of zinc in your diet by eating more oysters, dried 
beans, spinach, seeds, and nuts.
 
✓ Selenium: This mineral is particularly helpful in taming overactive thy-
roid glands. You can get more selenium by eating raw Brussels sprouts, 
cabbage, broccoli, and cauliflower.
Grasping Glucose Control
Maintaining healthy glucose (also known as blood sugar) levels in your body 
is a great way to ensure that you’ll have the kind of energy that makes you 
feel like jumping out of bed in the morning, ready to take on the day. The 
amount of sugar that you bring into your body is almost entirely dependent 
upon your diet. If you make smart choices about the sugar you consume, 
you’ll take an important step toward feeling good and staying healthy.

180
Part III: Enhancing Wellness through Detoxification 
The problem, of course, is that sugar is delicious! And in a world full of sugar-
filled, processed foods, it can be all too easy to let sugar creep into your diet 
in unhealthy and dangerous amounts. To help keep your hand out of the 
cookie jar, remember that in high enough amounts, sugar actually has a toxic 
effect on your body. In this section, I explain how sugar can act as a toxin, 
and I clue you in on how you can take steps to make sure your blood sugar 
stays at a level that makes you feel energetic but doesn’t take you down a 
path that leads to diabetes and other sugar-related ailments.
Recognizing sugar as a toxin
When you look at a piece of candy, a soft drink, or a jelly donut, do you imme-
diately think toxin? I know you may find it hard to believe, but the sugar that 
makes up a huge part of those types of sweet treats can have a toxic effect 
on your body’s systems. A spoonful of sugar may help the medicine go down, 
but keep in mind that the reason you may need medicine in the first place is 
because you’ve had way too much sugar over the years.
High levels of blood sugar in your body have an inflammatory effect on your 
blood vessels. When you have high blood sugar, your body produces addi-
tional insulin (a hormone that helps your body move sugar into the tissue 
where it can be converted into energy). But if you have too much insulin in 
your system, the result is also inflamed blood vessels. In that respect, sugar 
and insulin can act just like many other toxins because the inflammation 
of your blood vessels is the start of a long, nasty process that includes the 
buildup of plaque, a decrease in blood flow, and damage to your organs. And 
I haven’t even mentioned the many dangers of diabetes, which affects more 
than 20 million Americans. (If you’d like more information on diabetes, check 
out Diabetes For Dummies, 3rd Edition, by Dr. Alan Rubin [Wiley].)
But you do have to keep your blood sugar levels high enough to provide 
the fuel you need to keep your body working properly and leave you feeling 
energized. The brain does not keep any stored sugar reserves and operates 
directly off of the blood sugar, so maintaining constant blood sugar levels is 
extremely important. How can you tell when you’ve got the right amount of 
sugar in your system, and when you need to cut back on your sugar intake or 
risk damaging your health? For a few simple ways to keep tabs on your blood 
sugar; keep reading.
Keeping an eye on your sugar
A blood sugar level of 70–100 mg/dl (milligrams per deciliter of blood) 
is considered normal and healthy. If you keep an eye on the amount of 
sugar in your diet, you should have no problem staying within that range. 
Unfortunately, it’s virtually impossible to accurately gauge your blood 
sugar levels based on how you feel. Luckily, though, you can use some very 

181
 Chapter 11: Increasing Your Energy Level
common tests to measure your blood sugar, including tests you can do your-
self and tests that a doctor should administer.
Doing it yourself
If you’d like to monitor your blood sugar levels at home on your own, you 
can do so very easily with a blood glucose meter. You can buy a meter at 
your local drug store or from a wide variety of online retailers. Although each 
meter includes slightly different instructions for use, the basic steps are usu-
ally the same.
 
These instructions give you a general idea of what to expect if you choose to 
use a do-it-yourself blood glucose meter. But please be sure to read all the 
instructions for your meter because differences exist between devices that 
you’ll need to take into account to ensure safety and an accurate reading.
 
1. Turn on your meter.
 
2. Wash your hands with soap and warm water, and be sure to thor-
oughly clean the finger you plan to prick with the lancet (needle).
 
3. Insert a test strip in the meter and prick your finger with the lancet.
 
4. Put a drop of blood on the test strip and wait for the meter to display 
your results.
If your blood sugar level falls in that ideal 70–100 mg/dl range, you can rest 
assured that you’re doing a nice job of eating the right amount of sugar, and 
your energy levels should be good. If your blood sugar is in that range and 
you’re still pooped all the time, be sure to read about the other possible 
causes for a lack of energy that I detail in this chapter.
 
If you’re overweight, sedentary, or have a family history of diabetes, you 
should buy a blood glucose meter and check your levels periodically. If you 
don’t eat anything for eight hours and your blood sugar is over 126 mg/dl, or if 
your blood sugar is over 200 mg/dl when you test two hours after a meal, you 
could have diabetes and you should make an appointment with your doctor 
immediately.
Getting tested by your doctor
In addition to the blood glucose meters that make it easy to keep an eye on 
your blood sugar levels by yourself, you can also visit your doctor for an 
even more accurate, comprehensive test. Scheduling a yearly hemoglobin 
A1c (HgbA1c) test is a good idea. This test shows you what your average 
blood sugar level has been for the previous three months. Your doctor 
should be happy to discuss the results with you, but keep in mind that 
you want your measurement to be less than 6.1. If you make that cut, you 
shouldn’t be experiencing a lack of energy because of blood sugar concerns. 
However, keep in mind that a good test result doesn’t guarantee you’re not at 
risk for diabetes in the future.

182
Part III: Enhancing Wellness through Detoxification 
 
If you visit your doctor for a blood glucose test, ask her to give you both a fast-
ing and a two-hour postprandial blood sugar and insulin test. (The former is a 
test that is administered after you haven’t eaten for eight hours, and the latter 
is administered exactly two hours after you eat a meal.) This combination of 
tests will give you a nice, full indication of your blood glucose and insulin 
levels and whether you have diabetes. Believe it or not, the fasting and two-
hour postprandial insulin tests can detect sugar problems up to ten years 
before you become diabetic!
Solving your sugar problem
If your blood sugar levels are causing a health problem, you can use a variety 
of effective ways to get the problem under control. Luckily, these types of 
fixes will have a positive effect on your health in general, and they’re quite 
easy to do.
Eating smaller portions more frequently
If you eat a small number of large meals (three or fewer) each day, you’re 
probably forcing your body to accommodate sudden, sizable increases in 
sugar and carbohydrates. That situation creates a very unstable pattern for 
blood sugar levels, and the result can be big increases of energy followed by 
crashes. That’s a blood sugar roller coaster that you don’t want to be on if 
you’re interested in keeping up a healthy, pleasant energy level throughout 
the day.
Fixing the problem is pretty simple: Eat more meals per day, and make sure 
they’re smaller than the meals you were eating before. If you eat, say, five 
small meals a day instead of three big ones, you end up consuming about the 
same amount of food but your body has a much more constant supply of fuel, 
and the exhausting variations won’t be nearly as much of an issue.
Avoiding unhealthy amounts of sugar
There’s no better way to head sugar-related problems off at the pass than 
by curbing the amount of sugar and simple carbohydrates you include in 
your diet. Why do I include simple carbohydrates here? Consider this: Bread 
turns to sugar as soon as it hits the stomach; in terms of blood sugar levels, 
a slice of bread is no different than a spoonful of sugar. (Note that whole 
wheat bread, while healthier for you than white bread, is no different in 
terms of raising your blood sugar.) Limiting your sugar and simple carbohy-
drate intake can help give you healthy, steady energy throughout the day, 
and doing so also helps you avoid a lot of the common health problems that 
many Americans face. (Obesity and diabetes are prime examples.)

183
 Chapter 11: Increasing Your Energy Level
Dodging sugar can be harder than you think. Sugar is added to the majority 
of processed foods, and sugar can be listed lots of different ways in ingredi-
ents lists. If you see any of the following words listed as an ingredient, you’re 
really just seeing another term for sugar:
 
✓ Dextrose
 
✓ Fructose
 
✓ Glucose
 
✓ High fructose corn syrup
 
✓ Sucrose
 
High fructose corn syrup can be particularly nasty, so do your best to avoid 
eating it. A recent U.S. Department of Agriculture study showed that 80 per-
cent of high fructose corn syrup samples revealed the presence of mercury, 
which is one of the worst toxins out there.
You never know where a form of sugar is going to pop up. If you want a real 
shock, have a look at the ingredients on a container of iodized salt. You’re 
almost guaranteed to see dextrose — a form of sugar — listed as one of the 
ingredients!
Seeking out the right foods
This may come as a surprise, but a diabetic diet is a good diet for anyone. 
Sugar is kept to a minimum in diabetic diets, and the basic food types that 
form the diet’s foundation are vegetables (especially those with color), a vari-
ety of protein, and regular (but small) amounts of fruit. If you’re faced with an 
overabundance of blood sugar, make sure those types of foods are the focus 
of your diet.
Several nutrients, minerals, spices, and herbs have also been shown to help 
regulate blood sugar levels. The following are just a few of many examples:
 
✓ American ginseng: This herb has shown promise for people interested 
in a very natural way to control blood sugar. You can buy American gin-
seng at vitamin or health food stores.
 
✓ Chromium: People who don’t get enough chromium in their diets have 
been known to suffer from elevated glucose levels, and when their chro-
mium levels are increased their blood sugar returns to normal. Make 
sure you’re getting plenty of chromium by eating eggs, organic beef, 
cheese, and wine.
 
✓ Cinnamon: Recent studies have shown that 1 to 8 grams per day of 
cinnamon have helped to reduce blood sugar in diabetics. You can 
add cinnamon to many different kinds of foods, but don’t even think 
about using cinnamon rolls as a source of cinnamon in your diet! To get 
enough, you need to supplement.

184
Part III: Enhancing Wellness through Detoxification 
 
✓ Vitamin E: To up your vitamin E intake, eat more nuts, vegetable oils, 
and leafy vegetables. You’ll help to control your blood sugar and, at the 
same time, boost your antioxidant levels. It’s a win-win!
Getting plenty of exercise
I can’t say enough good things about the tremendous health benefits you can 
enjoy if you exercise regularly. Exercising is critical for a healthy life, and it 
can even help lower your blood sugar levels. During exercise, muscles take 
sugar directly out of the bloodstream without insulin, which can go a long 
way toward limiting your glucose levels.
You don’t have to do a triathlon or carry a log up the side of a mountain to 
help reduce your blood sugar levels with exercise. You can make quite a bit of 
positive progress by simply walking for 30 minutes at a fast pace every day.
Considering the Effects of 
Abnormal Bowel Flora
Your intestines are about 26 feet long and contain more than a trillion bacte-
rial cells, called bowel flora. You have more bacterial cells inside you than 
you have human cells in your body. Most of these bacteria are probiotics 
(good bacteria), which help you break down food so you can absorb the 
nutrients. This bowel flora plays a major role in keeping you healthy, and if 
it gets disrupted by an increase in abnormal bowel flora (bacteria and other 
organisms in your gut that don’t really belong there), the result can be all 
sorts of health problems, including severe fatigue.
Over the next few pages, I fill you in on abnormal bowel flora: the different 
types, the tests that can discover them, and how you can get rid of and avoid 
them. Your goal should be to eradicate the vast majority of abnormal bowel 
flora in your intestine because doing so will go a long way toward boosting 
your energy level.
Peeking at what’s hiding in your gut
Even when you consider the jungles, deep forests, and coral reefs spread 
across the globe, very few places contain as wide a variety of living things as 
your intestines. The three major types of problem-causing abnormal bowel 
flora are yeast, parasites, and bad bacteria, and I give you the rundown on 
all three in this section. I also provide you with some ways to get rid of these 
critters.

185
 Chapter 11: Increasing Your Energy Level
As with many ailments, prevention is the best cure for abnormal bowel flora, 
so if you’d rather just find out how to avoid the problem, feel free to skip 
ahead to the “Avoiding abnormal bowel flora” section later in this chapter.
Yeast
Yeasts are microscopic organisms that are almost always present in your 
intestines. A certain type called Candida is extremely common, and if you 
have only small amounts of it among all the good bacteria in your intestines, 
it doesn’t cause any trouble. But if you accidentally clear out a lot of your 
good bacteria, Candida suddenly has less competition and begins to multi-
ply and grow. When that happens, Candida can hurt you in a lot of different 
ways, because it releases toxins that affect most of your body’s systems. The 
following are just a few of the problems that can occur:
 
✓ Brain fog
 
✓ Constipation
 
✓ Irritable bowel syndrome
 
✓ Mouth and gum soreness
 
✓ Severe fatigue
 
✓ Urinary pain or itching
 
You can keep Candida and other yeasts in their place by using antibiotics only 
when really necessary and using probiotics when you do. Antibiotics don’t 
just kill the bacteria that make you sick; they also kill the good bacteria in 
your intestines. After the good bacteria are gone, the yeasts suddenly have a 
lot more freedom, so they begin multiplying almost immediately.
If you’ve recently finished a round of antibiotics and you’re suffering from 
some of the symptoms of a yeast problem, you can take steps to get the 
yeasts back under control. Cut your sugar and carbohydrate levels down to 
a minimum, and help support your good bacteria by eating yogurt or taking 
supplements that contain probiotics. One of the best supplements to take 
when taking antibiotics is Saccharomyces boulardii. If these steps don’t help 
and you’re still suffering from symptoms after a week, see a physician.
Sometimes the symptoms of a yeast problem can be severe and prolonged, 
and if that’s the case it’s time to schedule an appointment with your doctor. 
He can give you the tests I explain in the “Getting tested for abnormal bowel 
flora” section later in this chapter, and he can also prescribe medications 
that will help clear out the excess yeast.
Parasites
Parasites are organisms that can live in your body, feeding on the materials 
that your body uses to make energy. They rob you of your body’s nutrients 
and cause all sorts of problems — including fatigue — but parasites usually 

186
Part III: Enhancing Wellness through Detoxification 
don’t kill you. They come in all shapes and varieties, including worms. (These 
worms are closer to the types that dogs and cats often suffer from than the 
worms that live in your garden and make good fishing bait.) Two of the most 
common types of human parasite worms are
 
✓ Roundworms: Also known as Ascaris worms, this parasite thrives in your 
intestine and is transmitted through fecal-oral contact (when people 
don’t wash their hands thoroughly after coming in contact with human 
or animal feces, for example).
 
✓ Tapeworms: Several kinds of these nasty worms exist, and they’re 
transmitted through undercooked beef, pork, and fish. They can grow to 
dozens of feet in length within your intestines.
But worms are only part of the picture. There are hundreds of different types 
of parasites and almost as many ways to contract them. Don’t be surprised if 
you end up with a parasite at some point in your life. (Don’t be embarrassed, 
either, because most people get at least one parasite and plenty of people 
suffer from several.) Parasites can be treated with prescription medica-
tions, which are generally very effective but can also be harsh and hard on 
the body. If you’d rather pursue a more natural solution, you can try adding 
wormwood, black walnut hulls, garlic, grapefruit seed extract, and pumpkin 
seeds to your diet. Talk to someone at your local health food store for more 
information on how to buy and use these materials.
Bad bacteria
As I mention at the start of this section, quite a lot of good, beneficial bacte-
ria live in your intestine, and you need them to survive. Good bacteria help 
you to break down your food and make your digestive system more dynamic 
and versatile. But bad, abnormal types of intestinal bacteria exist, too, and if 
they end up in your intestine and multiply rapidly, you can easily suffer from 
energy levels that go crashing through the floor.
There are too many different types of abnormal bacteria to cover here, and 
several of these varieties are probably living in your intestine even as you 
read this. As with the yeasts I explain earlier in this chapter, the bad bacteria 
don’t cause problems unless the good bacteria in your intestines are killed 
off. In that situation, the bad bacteria are suddenly left with less competi-
tion and can multiply. This situation can happen when you take antibiotics 
(because 80 percent of your good bacteria can be wiped out with a single 
round of antibiotics), and it can also be made worse when you consume con-
taminated food that contains relatively large amounts of bad bacteria.
 
Excessive amounts of bad bacteria in your intestine often cause gas that has 
a particularly foul smell. If you’re suffering from extremely foul-smelling gas, 
please consider that you may have an overabundance of bad bacteria, and 
take some of the steps I describe in this section to correct the problem. You 
(and anyone you spend time with) will be happy you did.

187
 Chapter 11: Increasing Your Energy Level
The best way to rid yourself of bad bacteria is to overwhelm it with good bac-
teria. You can actually ingest good bacteria that will multiply and thrive when 
they reach your intestines. A couple examples of good bacteria are lactoba-
cillus acidophilus and lactobacillus bifidus. You can add them to your diet by 
drinking acidophilus milk or by taking supplements that contain the bacteria, 
both of which are available at any health food store.
Getting tested for abnormal bowel flora
If you’re experiencing the symptoms of a yeast, parasite, or bad bacteria 
problem, your doctor can test your urine and feces to help you figure out if 
you have a problem with abnormal bowel flora. Any general physician could 
do this type of testing, but most aren’t familiar with the tests. Your best bet is 
to find a doctor who practices natural medicine. Go online and visit the Web 
sites for the American College for Advancement in Medicine (www.acamnet.
org) or the International College of Integrative Medicine (www.icimed.com) 
to find a list of doctors who can help.
Stool sample tests
Stool samples can be analyzed for parasites, yeast, and abnormal bacteria. The 
process is simple: You provide a sample, and a lab examines the sample to 
determine if you have healthy or unusually high levels of abnormal bowel flora.
Urine tests
Abnormal bacteria and yeasts in your intestines produce chemicals that are 
absorbed into your bloodstream and eventually make their way out of your 
body through your urine. Lab tests can analyze your urine to detect these 
chemicals. If the chemicals are present in high enough quantities, you have a 
solid indication that you could be suffering from an overabundance of abnor-
mal bowel flora. Unfortunately, these types of urine tests (and the stool tests 
I describe in the previous paragraph) aren’t usually covered by health insur-
ance plans.
Avoiding abnormal bowel flora
Hands down, the best way to deal with an abnormal bowel flora problem is 
to never get a problem in the first place. If you can prevent yeasts, parasites, 
and bad bacteria from getting out of control, you’ve taken an important step 
to fight off fatigue. Keep in mind that you must have a very acidic stomach 
to keep normal bowel flora. (See Chapter 4 for a complete discussion of the 
importance of stomach acid.)

188
Part III: Enhancing Wellness through Detoxification 
Washing and cooking your food
Your food is by no means sterile, and although your stomach acid kills a lot 
of potentially problematic bowel flora, you need to make sure you’re wash-
ing and cooking your food. All fruits and vegetables should be washed thor-
oughly. All meats should be cooked through, and be sure to wash any utensil 
used on uncooked meat before using it on other foods.
Finding foods that can help
You can make some simple food choices that will help to limit growth of 
abnormal bowel flora and promote the health of probiotics. Include plenty of 
vegetables in your diet, and focus on greens, tomatoes, celery, broccoli, cau-
liflower, asparagus, and beans.
 
To get the maximum health benefit from your vegetables, eat fresh, 100 per-
cent organic products whenever you can. If you’re not able to eat fresh veg-
etables, the next best option is frozen, followed by canned (a distant third).
Any meat you consume should be well cooked, or you risk introducing a 
whole host of parasites into your system. If you can, buy free-range meat and 
check to see that it was produced without antibiotics or growth hormones.
Seeking the right supplements
Supplements can be a good way for you to boost the amount of probiotics 
in your intestine, which can thwart unhealthy increases in abnormal bowel 
flora. These supplements are taken orally, and you can find them at health 
food stores or at reputable online retailers. You can try one or a combination 
of the following:
 
✓ Acidophilus
 
✓ Bifidus
 
✓ Saccharomyces
All three have technical-sounding names, but they’re common supplements 
and pretty easy to find.

In This Chapter
▶ Getting a feel for allergy basics
▶ Exploring a few supplements that can help your allergies
▶ Making food choices that help with your allergy problems
▶ Cooking up some allergy-fighting recipes
A
llergies are an extremely common health 
problem. About 55 percent of all Americans have a reaction to at least 
one allergen, and about $18 billion per year is spent on diagnosing, treating, 
and preventing allergies. What’s worse is that hundreds of deaths occur each 
year because of extreme allergies to certain foods, stinging insects, and medi-
cines like penicillin. Maybe the most worrying statistic of all is that allergies 
are becoming more common: The presence of allergies in the U.S. population 
has increased by 300 percent since 1960.
Allergies are a result of the immune system reacting in an unusual way to 
some substance — an allergen — that has entered the body. The unpleasant 
and in some cases dangerous symptoms that come along with allergies all 
start with your immune system, so keeping that critical part of your body 
healthy is terrifically important when it comes to reining in allergy problems. 
(I talk all about the immune system in Chapter 10, and all the rules I explain 
there certainly apply here.)
Toxins wreak havoc on every part of your body, and your immune system 
is no exception. An increased amount of toxins in your body can throw a 
wrench in your immune function, which can make you more prone to the 
ravages of allergies. If you have allergies, you need to focus on cutting out 
toxins and taking steps to improve your immune system now. You also want 
to embrace a few allergy-fighting techniques. I cover all these bases in this 
chapter.
 
To figure out just how much of an allergy problem you may have, take a few 
minutes to go through the allergy quiz included in Chapter 8.

Covering Allergy Basics
Allergies are caused when your immune system has a response to an aller-
gen. I won’t go into all the nitty gritty details of an allergic reaction because 
it involves more technical information than you really want to know. Here’s 
the short version: You end up with a reaction when your immune system 
identifies and responds to an allergen in a way that, through a series of 
steps, gives you elevated levels of certain chemicals — histamine is the 
main one — in your bloodstream, and these chemicals cause allergy symp-
toms. The symptoms are wide ranging and can affect many areas of your 
body, including the following:
 
✓ Eyes: Itching, burning, redness, watering, allergic shiners (a dark or blue 
hue under the eyes), blurred or double vision
 
✓ Mouth: Sores, constant bad taste, trouble swallowing
 
✓ Sinuses: Itching or runny/stuffy nose, recurrent infections, pain, sneez-
ing, decreased smell
 
✓ Ears: Recurrent infections, sensitivity to sound, ringing, pain, clogged 
feeling, itching
 
✓ Lungs: Shortness of breath, tight chest, cough, excessive phlegm — and 
even complete swelling of the throat that stops breathing
 
✓ Cardiovascular system: Heart pain, palpitations or irregular beat, high 
or low blood pressure, inflammation of arteries or veins
 
✓ Stomach and intestines: Bloating, gas, heartburn, nausea, constipation 
or diarrhea, ulcers, irritable bowel, spasms, Crohn’s disease, ulcerative 
colitis
 
✓ Muscles: Inflammation, tremors, weakness, stiffness, pain
 
✓ Joints: Stiffness, swelling, pain, arthritis
 
✓ Skin: Rash, itching, swelling, redness, perspiration, eczema
The vast number of symptoms caused by allergic reactions is matched only 
by the hundreds of different kinds of allergens that are commonly found in 
the world around you. I don’t have room to list all the allergens out there, but 
here are some of the most common offenders:
 
✓ Pollen: Many different kinds are released by a variety of plants, from 
weeds to trees.
 
✓ Mold: Lots of different types of molds cause allergic reactions.
 
✓ Drugs: Some drugs can cause an allergic response in humans; antibiotics 
like penicillin are among the most common drug allergens.

195
 Chapter 12: Fighting Allergies
 
✓ Animal dander: Dander is made up of scales of old animal skin, which 
slough off and are inhaled through breathing. Many people assume that 
pet hair or fur causes allergies to animals like cats or dogs, but dander is 
the real culprit.
 
✓ Latex rubber: Sources include gloves, balloons, and condoms.
 
✓ Foods: Allergic reactions to certain foods are a concern for millions of 
people. Common food allergens include shellfish, peanuts, dairy prod-
ucts, eggs, and gluten.
 
If you think you’re having an allergic reaction to a food, don’t immediately 
focus on a food that you’ve just eaten or one that you’ve had for the first 
time. Reactions because of food allergens can be delayed, so think about what 
you’ve eaten over the course of the last two or three days. And you can’t be 
allergic to something the first time you’re exposed to it; your immune system 
has to be exposed at least one previous time before it goes haywire and 
causes an allergy. Instead, focus on foods that you have had a limited number 
of times in the past and eaten again recently.
Many people assume that allergies are inherited, but that’s only partly true. 
Research has shown that the tendency to develop allergies is influenced by 
heredity, but being allergic to a specific allergen isn’t inherited. So if one or 
both of your parents had allergies, you’re more likely to have them. But if 
Itching to control the poison ivy allergy
One of the most common allergies of all is an 
allergy to poison ivy. The resin on the poison ivy 
plant causes an itchy, burning rash on the skin 
of most people, and a prevalent misconception 
only makes the problem worse. Let me clear 
things up: Poison ivy does not spread. If you’re 
exposed to it and you get an allergic reaction, 
the resulting rash can’t spread to other parts of 
your body (or to other people). After you shower 
with hot soapy water, all the poison ivy resin is 
gone from your body.
So how does poison ivy get from one place to 
another? The problem is usually large amounts 
of poison ivy resin that remain on clothes, 
shoes, and other items after the exposure has 
taken place. If you get the resin on your shoes, 
the next morning you can put your shoes on and 
get the resin on your hands, which you can then 
rub on your neck, arms, or even your eyes. That 
action spreads the resin all over, and the rash 
spreads with it. The resin off the plant can stay 
active for three weeks.
It’s easy to beat this common allergic reaction. 
If you find that you’ve gotten into some poison 
ivy, take off your clothes and wash them with 
lots of detergent and hot water. Then take a 
long, hot, soapy shower and don’t miss any 
spots when you’re washing. After the shower, 
put on fresh gloves and wash everything that 
may have come in contact with the resin, 
including shoes, belts, hats, watches, glasses, 
tools, and even pets.

your mom or dad is allergic to ragweed, that doesn’t mean you will be aller-
gic to ragweed — just that the chances are greater you’ll develop an allergy 
to something.
 
If you have a new baby or you’re expecting one, you can limit the baby’s 
chances of developing allergies by breastfeeding. Infants often develop food 
allergies because they’re exposed to food too early in life. Infants don’t start 
making digestive enzymes to break down food other than breast milk until 
they’re about 1 year old, and introducing those foods can contribute to the 
development of allergies.
Maintaining a healthy digestive tract can help you to avoid allergies. When 
your intestines are irritated or inflamed by toxins, they can malfunction and 
leak allergens into your bloodstream. Read up about how to keep your intes-
tines healthy and toxin-free in Chapters 4 and 5.
Nothing to Sneeze At: Supplements 
for Beating Allergies
Years ago, the wholesome, natural foods that people ate were high-quality 
and nutrient-rich enough to provide the substances necessary to keep their 
immune systems healthy and less likely to get out of whack, so allergy prob-
lems were less common. In the last 100 years or so, however, the quality of 
our food has gone way down and the amount of toxins in the environment 
has shot through the roof. One of the results is a dramatic increase in the 
number of people who suffer from allergies.
If you have problems with allergies and you want to solve them the natural 
way, adjust your diet accordingly — that’s the focus of the next section — 
and consider taking some supplements to expedite the process. In this sec-
tion, I present two different categories of supplements that can help tame 
your allergies: supplements that give your immune system the kind of kick 
in the pants it needs to perform efficiently and not create allergy issues, and 
supplements that help you to keep existing allergy problems under control.
Energizing immunity
Because your immune system’s response is the root of your allergies, it 
pays to take supplements that keep your immune system from getting out 
of whack. A range of products is on the market, but I’m a fan of the following 
options, which are widely available both at health food stores and online. 
(For some basic information on how to pick out safe, high-quality supple-
ments, be sure to visit Chapter 5.)

197
 Chapter 12: Fighting Allergies
 
✓ American skullcap: 1–2 grams per day
 
✓ Astragalus: 250–500 mg per day
 
✓ Devils claw: 600–1,200 mg per day
 
✓ Evening primrose: 2–8 grams daily
 
✓ Folic acid: 800 micrograms per day
 
✓ Gamma-linolenic acid: 2,800 mg per day in several divided doses
 
✓ Licorice: 250–500 mg three times per day
 
✓ Omega-3 fatty acids: 1–4 grams per day
 
✓ Quercetin: 50–200 mg three times a day
 
✓ Spirulina: 2,000–3,000 mg per day
 
In Chapter 10, I sing the praises of concentrated antioxidant supplement pow-
ders, which are commonly called greens. They’re terrific for your immune 
system and can therefore help you to get your allergy problems under control. 
Make sure you look for products that have an ORAC of at least 20,000 per 
scoop in powder form.
Helping to keep allergies under control
In addition to the supplements listed in the previous section, which will keep 
your immune system humming along as it should, you can also try taking 
some supplements that have been shown to help nip allergy problems in the 
bud. I list some of the most promising options here. These supplements are 
good for sinus-type problems but also help with any allergic reaction:
 
✓ Butterbur: Recent studies have shown that tablets made from this herb 
can treat allergy symptoms as well as some of the common prescription 
allergy drugs that have become increasingly popular in recent years.
 
✓ Goldenseal: Natural compounds in the root of the goldenseal plant can 
help with your allergies. Look for capsules containing goldenseal, and 
take the supplement according to the dosage recommendations on the 
product label.
 
✓ Stinging nettle: As you can tell by its name, the stinging nettle plant 
isn’t something you want to encounter when you’re walking through 
the woods or on a creek bank. But when its leaves and roots are freeze-
dried and packaged in capsule form, the plant can help you fight sea-
sonal allergies. You should be able to find several varieties at your 
favorite health food store or at a shop that specializes in vitamins or 
supplements.

Controlling Allergies with 
Smart Food Decisions
The food choices you make can have a tremendous impact on your allergies. 
Of course, when it comes to food allergies, the choices you make about what 
you eat can be a matter of life or death (in extreme cases). But even with 
more common allergies, like pet or seasonal allergies, you can make a lot of 
headway just by picking out the right food options.
As always, the general rules for food apply: Avoid toxins by cutting out pro-
cessed foods, skip on foods that contain additives, and eat organic whenever 
possible (remembering that 100 percent organic is the best). Just taking 
these steps can do you a world of good because you’ll eliminate the toxic 
load from your diet and greatly reduce the stress you put on your immune 
system. Here are a few examples of healthful foods that will help you keep 
your body in tip-top shape and less likely to fall prey to uncomfortable and 
dangerous allergies:
 
✓ Fish and fish oil: Be sure to keep in mind — and avoid — the types of 
fish that commonly contain mercury. (See Chapter 2 for details.)
 
✓ Fruits: Apples, blueberries, and papaya are a great place to start.
 
✓ Green vegetables: Try broccoli, spinach, Brussels sprouts, and asparagus.
 
✓ Orange or yellow vegetables: Carrots, squash, peppers, and pumpkin 
are just a few examples.
Choosing locally grown or produced foods is another way to lessen your 
allergy troubles. One of the top choices is local honey, made by bees that live 
in your area. This may sound a little farfetched, but local honey can help you 
with your allergies. All honey contains very small amounts of pollen, which 
bees constantly bring back to their hives after visiting hundreds and thou-
sands of plants to collect the nectar that provides their food source. Local 
honey contains trace amounts of the types of pollen that are most common 
in your area — the pollens that cause your seasonal allergies to flare up twice 
a year (or more for some people). When you eat the honey, you expose your 
body to just a little bit of the pollen — not too much. Over time, your immune 
system figures out how to deal with these allergens in a healthy, normal way, 
instead of going haywire and causing dreadful allergy symptoms like sneez-
ing, wheezing, and itchy eyes.
 
Even if you haven’t had problems with food allergies in the past, it always 
helps to be alert when you’re eating top offenders like milk, wheat (gluten), 
eggs, peanuts, shellfish, soy, and tree nuts. If you experience troubling allergy 
symptoms after consuming these types of foods, consult your doctor. You can 
also read up with Food Allergies For Dummies by Robert A. Wood, MD and Joe 
Kraynak (Wiley).

Recipes for Getting Your 
Allergies under Control
Fighting allergies with food can be effective and also extremely enjoyable. 
The recipes in this section will please your palate and also help to keep your 
allergy troubles at bay.
 
T Sweet Apple Dip
Everyone loves apples, and they’re easy to use in recipes. They provide a good amount 
of soluble and insoluble fiber, as well as pectin, which helps lower LDL cholesterol. 
Apples also contain quercetin, an antioxidant that fights free radicals that lead to dis-
ease and aging. Children with asthma who eat apples and drink apple juice have less 
wheezing.
Serve this dip with more apples and other fruits and vegetables, like carrots, pear 
slices, and kiwifruit.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Chilling time: 2–3 hours
Yield: 4–6 servings
2 large organic apples, grated
2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice
1 tablespoon honey
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon turmeric
1/4 teaspoon stevia
1 cup organic or homemade applesauce
 1 Toss grated apples with lemon juice, then mix with all other ingredients in a medium 
bowl. Serve immediately with other fruits and vegetables, or cover and chill for 2–3 
hours.

Vegetable Salad
If you have food allergies, you need to avoid certain foods. Never eat the specific food 
you are allergic to, of course, but also make sure to avoid caffeine, sugar, and alcohol. 
The most allergenic foods include eggs, soy, wheat, tree nuts, peanuts, milk, and shell-
fish. Luckily, there are many foods you can eat!
Vegetables and fruits, along with salmon, local honey, and tea, are all excellent sources 
of nutrients, especially omega-3 fatty acids. You’ll start feeling better when eating to 
detox your body.

T Stir-Fried Vegetables 
 
on Quinoa
Stir-frying is a very quick and healthy way of cooking. Before you start to stir-fry, make 
sure all the ingredients are prepped and ready to use. There’s no time to stop and pre-
pare an ingredient while things are hopping in the wok!
In this recipe you can substitute long grain brown organic rice for the quinoa if you’d 
like, but do try the quinoa. It’s nutty and mild and contains all the amino acids your 
body needs.
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Cooking time: 35 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
1 cup quinoa, rinsed
2 cups filtered water
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 organic yellow onion, peeled and chopped
3 cloves organic garlic, peeled and minced
2 tablespoons grated fresh ginger root
2 cups organic Brussels sprouts, quartered
1 head organic broccoli, cut into florets
2 organic carrots, sliced
1 cup organic green beans, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
1/2 cup filtered water
2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
2 tablespoons honey
1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 cup organic broccoli or mung bean sprouts
 1 In saucepan, combine quinoa and 2 cups filtered water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat, 
cover pan, and simmer 15–18 minutes until quinoa is tender; set aside.
 2 Meanwhile, prepare all the vegetables. In large skillet or wok, heat olive oil over 
medium-high heat. Add onion and garlic; stir-fry 2 minutes. Add ginger root, Brussels 
sprouts, broccoli, carrots, and beans; stir-fry 5–6 minutes until crisp-tender.
 3 Combine 1/2 cup water, vinegar, honey, and cayenne pepper in small bowl; stir well and 
add to skillet with sprouts. Stir-fry 3–4 minutes until liquid thickens slightly. Serve over 
quinoa.

T Honeyed Pineapple Rice Pudding
Rice pudding is a creamy, rich, and comforting dessert that almost anyone with aller-
gies can eat. You can omit the pineapple if you are allergic to it, or you can simply sub-
stitute another fruit. Rice milk is easily found in most grocery stores. Be sure to look for 
a 100 percent organic variety.
Eating locally produced honey may actually help relieve allergy symptoms. Honey is an 
immune system booster and may work like a vaccination, helping your body become 
accustomed to the allergens in the air and environment. Be sure you aren’t allergic to 
honey before you eat it or use it in a health regimen.
Don’t give honey to infants, as it can contain a certain kind of bacteria that is harmless 
to adults but can make infants extremely ill.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 1 hour 40 minutes
Yield: 6 servings
1 cup long grain organic brown rice
2 cups filtered water
2 cups cubed fresh organic pineapple
1 1/2 cups organic pineapple juice
3 cups organic rice milk
1/3 cup local organic honey
1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger root
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon stevia
1 teaspoon vanilla
 1 In medium saucepan, combine rice with filtered water. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, 
cover, and simmer 45–60 minutes until rice is tender.
 2 Combine cooked rice, pineapple, juice, rice milk, honey, ginger root, and cinnamon in a 
large saucepan. Cook over medium heat 30–40 minutes, stirring frequently, until very 
thick. Stir in stevia and vanilla, remove from heat, and serve warm or cold.

C
ardiovascular disease is the number one cause of death in the United 
States. The numbers are staggering: Recent years have seen deaths 
from cardiovascular causes nearing the 1 million mark, and more than 16 mil-
lion people alive today have had a heart attack or significant angina (heart 
pain). Almost 6 million of those have had heart failure.
All this suffering and death due to ailments of the heart and the rest of the 
circulatory system are even scarier when you consider that just over 100 
years ago, heart disease wasn’t even in the top ten causes of death. What is 
causing such a high rate of cardiovascular disease today that wasn’t present 
in 1900? A lot of things have changed since then, of course, but one of the 
major changes in terms of health and our environment is an unprecedented 
influx of toxins in our food, air, and water.
In this chapter, I present some information that could very well conflict with 
what you’ve heard in the past about circulatory problems and cardiovascu-
lar disease. I urge you to keep an open mind and consider that conventional 
medicine may be going about this extremely important fight in the wrong 
way; we may be focusing too much on potential causes of these diseases that 
aren’t as significant as we once thought. Keep reading to find out more and to 
discover what you can do to avoid this ubiquitous killer.

Focusing on Blood Vessel Inflammation
The major contributing factor in lousy circulation and cardiovascular disease 
is the development of plaque in the arteries. I’m not talking about the kind 
of plaque that can form on your teeth (and certainly not about the kind you 
receive onstage at an awards ceremony). The plaque that forms in your arter-
ies is made up of cholesterol and calcium. Over time, it can grow and eventu-
ally get big enough to close off a blood vessel to the point where the tissue 
downstream doesn’t get enough blood to function. Or, the plaque can break 
apart and cause a plug in an artery with a clot.
When people hear about arterial plaque, most of them immediately assume 
that cholesterol is the problem — after all, we’ve been conditioned by news 
reports and millions of drug company marketing dollars to think of choles-
terol as the primary cause of cardiovascular disease and circulatory system 
problems. (I cover the cholesterol question in detail a little later in this chap-
ter.) But here’s a key question: Is the arterial plaque the root of the problem, 
or is it the result of another, underlying problem?
For some reason, the most popular line of reasoning in the medical field is 
that we shouldn’t be looking at why plaque develops; instead, we should 
focus on how to get rid of the plaque or the basic materials your body uses to 
make the plaque (calcium and cholesterol). But that approach doesn’t really 
solve the problem. We need to understand the reasons the body is trying to 
form plaque in the first place.
A growing body of evidence indicates that the initial cause for a plaque to 
develop is blood vessel inflammation. This inflammation can be caused by a 
lot of different things, and one of them is — you guessed it — toxins. Toxic 
materials, including heavy metals, chemicals, and biologic toxins (like bac-
teria and yeast), can all cause inflammation. In fact, all the toxins I cover in 
Chapters 2 and 3 can cause inflammation to some degree, which can lead to 
the buildup of plaque in the arteries and a slow-down in blood flow.
 
To make sure you’re getting screened properly for cardiovascular disease 
and potential problems with circulation, ask your doctor to do a c-reactive 
protein (CRP) test when you schedule your next checkup. A highly sensitive 
cardiac CRP test measures inflammation in your blood vessels and is the best 
way to detect potential problems with your circulatory system. The test is 
common, and just about any medical lab can perform one. Multiple studies 
have shown CRP to be more predictive of who is going to have a heart attack 
than cholesterol.

 Chapter 13: Improving Circulation
Pinpointing Toxins That 
Hinder Circulation
In this section, I give you the rundown of how specific toxins can affect your 
blood vessels and your heart.
Feeling the strain from heavy metals
Heavy metals earn their name because their weight is at least five times the 
weight of water. A handful of heavy metals are required for normal health; 
zinc and copper are two examples. But most heavy metals are toxic in any 
amount. The most toxic heavy metals include mercury, lead, antimony, arse-
nic, cadmium, excessive iron, aluminum, and nickel, and they all wreak havoc 
on your cardiovascular system. Here are some of their effects:
 
✓ Aluminum and iron in high levels can cause damage to blood vessel 
linings.
 
✓ Arsenic causes major blood vessel inflammation.
 
✓ Cadmium causes high blood pressure and can enlarge the heart and 
inflame the blood vessels.
 
✓ Lead is also known to cause high blood pressure, which is a leading 
cause of cardiovascular damage.
 
✓ Nickel produces inflammation of the blood vessels and has been identi-
fied as being a cause of heart attacks.
 
The heavy metals in this list are very hard on your circulatory system, but 
they pale in comparison to mercury. For humans, mercury is the most toxic 
non-radioactive substance on the planet. I cover mercury’s effects in several 
places throughout this book, but for the purposes of this chapter it’s impor-
tant that you know mercury is extremely toxic to the blood vessels and to the 
heart muscle itself.
One recent study looked at patients with a dangerous condition called 
enlarged heart and found that they had mercury levels in their heart muscles 
that were 22,000 times higher than patients with normal hearts.
Mercury can be extremely damaging to your heart. Studies of patients with 
elevated mercury levels have revealed increased heart attacks, abnormal 
electrocardiograms, rapid heartbeat, premature heartbeats, and inflamma-
tion of the heart muscle. Despite all this evidence, most cardiologists don’t 
pay much attention to mercury.

206
Part III: Enhancing Wellness through Detoxification 
 
If you or someone in your family is suffering from heart disease, be sure to talk 
with your cardiologist about getting tested for mercury toxicity. Just be sure 
that you get a proactive urine test instead of a blood test, because mercury 
stays in the blood for only a few days before it goes into your tissue.
In addition to its direct effects on the circulatory system, mercury can also 
cause loads of indirect negative effects. For instance, mercury can greatly 
damage the thyroid, and an out-of-whack thyroid is a huge strain on the 
heart. (Read all about the ways in which mercury can harm your thyroid in 
Chapter 11.) Mercury can also bond with insulin and contribute to diabetes, 
which is a major stressor on the heart and blood vessels. As if that weren’t 
enough, mercury fouls up the function of your pituitary gland, which plays a 
critical role in regulating your blood pressure.
Here are a few other common diseases and conditions that mercury contrib-
utes to. All these ailments have either direct or indirect consequences for 
your heart and the rest of your circulatory system:
 
✓ Alzheimer’s disease
 
✓ Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Lou Gehrig’s disease)
 
✓ Autism
 
✓ Candida overgrowth syndrome
 
✓ Chronic fatigue syndrome
 
✓ Colitis of any type
 
✓ Crohn’s disease
 
✓ Fibromyalgia
 
✓ Gastritis
 
✓ Graves’ disease
 
✓ Multiple sclerosis
 
✓ Myasthenia gravis
 
✓ Obsessive compulsive disorder
 
✓ Panic disorder
 
✓ Parkinson’s disease
 
✓ Rheumatoid arthritis
 
✓ Sjogren’s disease
 
✓ Systemic lupus erythematosus
Mercury is a tremendous risk to your health, and you need to take an active 
role in limiting your exposure to it. Flip back to Chapter 2 to get the skinny on 
where mercury comes from, and read through Chapter 3 to begin your under-
standing of how you can avoid eating, drinking, and breathing it in.

 Chapter 13: Improving Circulation
Looking at reactive oxygen species
Many of the toxins that I cover throughout this book fall in the category 
of reactive oxygen species (ROS): a large group of chemicals that contain 
oxygen and can cause damaging effects to your body’s cells and tissues. 
ROS can have a particularly nasty effect on the lining of your blood vessels. 
Inflammation occurs as a result, and when that happens your body starts 
building plaque in an effort to cope with the inflammation. Before you know 
it, you have cardiovascular disease. Clearly it’s in your best interest to limit 
the amount of ROS in your system and to limit the negative impact of the ROS 
already present inside you.
You won’t ever be able to cut out all the ROS because certain types are made 
by your body through its natural chemical processes. Even before the levels 
of toxins in our environment shot through the roof in the last century or so, 
people had some ROS in their bodies. That wasn’t much of an issue, however, 
because humans are able to deal with a certain level of ROS with antioxi-
dants, assuming that proper diet and nutrition are in place.
But we live in an era of extremely high toxicity, and the ROS levels that most 
people are exposed to are much too high for their bodies to handle. ROS can 
come from fertilizers, pesticides, food additives, food packaging, household 
cleaning products, and aerosols, just to name a few sources. Your body can 
get overwhelmed, and the problem can snowball if you’re not eating the right 
kind of diet and getting loads of antioxidants to help your body fight the good 
fight. The results are often devastating, and some of your body’s systems and 
tissues are more vulnerable than others. Your circulatory system is very sen-
sitive to ROS.
 
An increasing amount of evidence points to the fact that the inflammation that 
leads to the buildup of plaque in the blood vessels, which causes cardiovascu-
lar disease, begins with toxic threats like those posed by reactive oxygen spe-
cies. You need to start cutting down on the amount of toxins you’re exposed 
to immediately (see Chapter 3) and do what you can to clear out the toxins 
that are already in your body (Chapter 5 offers plenty of good starting points).
Understanding the Many Levels of Toxic 
Damage to Your Circulatory System
In addition to directly damaging the major components of your circulatory 
system — your blood vessels and your heart — toxins can also contribute to 
problems in other areas of your body that cause indirect harm to your car-
diovascular health. Three such problems are stress on your adrenal glands, 
changes to the way your body handles glucose, and dangerous fluctuations in 

208
Part III: Enhancing Wellness through Detoxification 
your blood pressure. In this section, you get a feel for how toxins can cause 
indirect (but significant) damage to your body’s delicate circulatory system.
Stressing the adrenal glands
You have a couple of adrenals glands — one on top of each kidney. Most 
people don’t think much about their adrenal glands, but they do a lot of very 
important things for you. Your adrenal glands produce some hormones that 
you simply can’t live without, and all these hormones have an effect on your 
circulatory system.
The adrenal glands are easily damaged by toxins, and damaged adrenal 
glands can have a negative impact on your cardiovascular health right away. 
Here are a few ways that can happen:
 
✓ Stress put on the adrenal glands by toxins can cause the glands to pro-
duce excess amounts of a hormone called cortisol. Higher-than-normal 
levels of cortisol can spike your blood sugar, which in turn causes 
inflammation in your blood vessels.
 
✓ Toxic damage to your adrenal glands can also result in unhealthy fluc-
tuations in the amount of aldosterone (another hormone) your adrenals 
produce. The complications are serious and include a change in your 
blood volume (not good), elevated blood pressure (also not good), and 
damage to your circulatory system tissues (downright bad).
 
✓ Long-term stress on your adrenal glands from elevated toxicity can 
cause adrenal failure, which is nothing short of disastrous for your cir-
culatory system.
Gauging glucose
The direct correlation between cardiovascular disease and diabetes is no 
secret. Most people understand that diabetics with higher blood sugar are 
more likely to suffer from diseases that affect the circulatory system, and 
they’re more likely to die from these conditions. Recently, some studies have 
shown that even among non-diabetics, the frequency of cardiovascular prob-
lems is much higher among those who have consistently higher blood sugar. 
Clearly blood sugar (glucose) has an effect on the circulatory system, and 
when blood sugar is high that effect isn’t good at all.
The ways in which elevated blood sugar levels challenge the circulatory 
system are many, and they’re pretty complicated, so I won’t get into the 
gory details here. The bottom line is that high blood sugar causes damage to 
blood vessels. High blood sugar also leads to high insulin levels, and it turns 
out that insulin also harms blood vessels.

209
 Chapter 13: Improving Circulation
 
A very clear connection exists between high blood sugar and cardiovascular 
problems, so if you’re facing any kind of heart disease be sure you go into 
your fight knowing that you need to keep your blood sugar in check.
When you eat a large meal, especially one that’s full of simple carbohydrates, 
your blood sugar spikes, and your insulin levels follow suit. Both things 
harm your blood vessels. This is another reason that it’s best for you to eat 
small meals more frequently instead of eating a lower number of big meals. 
Obviously, it’s also crucial to keep your sugar intake to a minimum. Even if 
you’re not diabetic, don’t push the envelope; you want to keep your blood 
sugar at safe, healthy levels.
 
Rapid rises in blood sugar are very hard on your circulatory system. To help 
keep this problem to a minimum, cut down on your intake of simple carbo-
hydrates (which include sugars, high fructose corn syrup, potatoes, and 
anything made of flour.) A good rule is to avoid eating anything white, except 
cauliflower. You should also be sure to eat a breakfast that contains some sort 
of protein source. Doing so gets your blood sugar levels started off right in the 
morning so you don’t have harmful blood sugar peaks and valleys throughout 
the day.
If you’re worried about circulatory problems and heart disease, it’s a good 
idea to go ahead and get your blood sugar and insulin tested. If your blood 
sugar or insulin levels are concerning, you could soon see an effect on your 
cardiovascular health, particularly if diabetes runs in your family.
Battling high blood pressure
When you visit any doctor’s office or get a health checkup of any kind, what’s 
one of the first things the nurse checks? Your blood pressure. That fact alone 
should tell you the importance of your blood pressure on your health.
High blood pressure (also called hypertension) is a problem that has grown 
quite a lot in recent years. Some estimates indicate that 30 percent of 
Americans suffer from high blood pressure, which is a pretty scary statistic 
considering how dangerous the condition can be for your health.
High blood pressure harms your circulatory system in two ways:
 
✓ It creates tension or stress in your blood vessels, which results in 
inflammation and damage to these important structures and leads to the 
formation of plaque.
 
✓ It makes your heart work harder than it should, which causes unneces-
sary cardiac strain that can lead to thicker and stiffer heart walls that 
don’t function normally. Remember that your heart beats about 40 mil-
lion times each year, so you really can’t afford for it to be operating at 
anything less than its best.

210
Part III: Enhancing Wellness through Detoxification 
Many factors contribute to high blood pressure, but one of the biggest is 
the formation of plaque in blood vessels, which is the result of inflammation 
caused by high levels of toxins in the body. All the toxins that end up in your 
body from food, air, and water can cause harmful changes to your blood ves-
sels and dangerous, elevated blood pressure. It’s just another reason why 
you need to put detoxification at the top of your health priority list.
Putting Cholesterol in Its Place
Very few natural substances are as vilified as cholesterol. You can’t turn 
on a television or read a magazine today without seeing some sort of story 
about the dangers of cholesterol or an advertisement for a product — from 
prescription drugs to breakfast cereals — that will help to reduce your cho-
lesterol.
The impact that cholesterol management has made in today’s medicine is 
indeed remarkable. Statin drugs, which are used to lower cholesterol, produce 
sales of $27 billion dollars annually. That’s a huge number!
Making sure your blood pressure 
problem is really a problem
Hypertension, or high blood pressure, is a con-
dition in which your blood pressure is elevated 
at an unhealthy level all the time. Even if you 
have normal, healthy blood pressure, you’re 
bound to see increases in your blood pres-
sure when your body is subjected to different 
conditions. For example, if you take the blood 
pressure of a person while she’s lifting a heavy 
box, her blood pressure is probably going to be 
very high because she’s engaged in strenuous 
physical activity. By the same token, if you take 
someone’s blood pressure when he’s taking an 
important test at school or at his job, his blood 
pressure will inevitably be higher, and in many 
cases higher than what’s considered a healthy 
level. There’s also a very common condition 
often referred to as “white coat hypertension” 
that involves a temporary spike in blood pres-
sure that results from people being nervous 
when they’re in a doctor’s office. That means 
their blood pressure could be at much higher 
than normal levels right when they’re getting 
their blood pressure taken!
Because of these types of blood pressure vari-
ations, you should have your blood pressure 
tested multiple times in a few different set-
tings before coming to the conclusion that you 
indeed have a constantly elevated blood pres-
sure problem. You may consider investing in a 
blood pressure cuff, which is available at your 
local drug store or online, so you can take your 
blood pressure at home on a more frequent 
basis. You don’t want to start taking blood pres-
sure medication, which is very serious stuff, 
if your blood pressure really isn’t a problem. 
Some researchers estimate that nearly half the 
people taking hypertension medication don’t 
really have sustained high blood pressure!

211
 Chapter 13: Improving Circulation
But here’s the problem with making cholesterol the boogeyman and spend-
ing billions of dollars a year on drugs to fight it: Cholesterol may not cause 
nearly as many health problems as the world thinks. Read on to find out what 
I mean.
Natural, normal, and necessary
 
Cholesterol is a natural product of your body. Your body manufactures cho-
lesterol, and lots of it. In fact, cholesterol is the basic molecule that your 
body uses to make many of its most important hormones, including those 
that control blood sugar, mineral balance, blood pressure, and inflammation. 
Cholesterol is also the basic building block for sex hormones like estrogen and 
testosterone.
From a very simplistic point of view, it’s difficult to imagine that your body 
would make a substance that would kill you. It seems even more of a stretch 
to think that a certain cholesterol level can be fine but a level just 1 or 2 per-
cent higher is dangerous and requires medication.
As I mention at the start of this chapter, at the turn of the 20th century car-
diovascular disease wasn’t even in the top ten causes of death, and people 
didn’t think a thing about their cholesterol levels. That’s mind-boggling 
when you consider that in those days people commonly cooked with lard, 
bacon grease, and butter, and they ate many foods high in cholesterol. The 
genes of those people were almost exactly the same as the genes of people 
who walk the earth now. Why was cholesterol not more of a problem back 
then? Put simply, the people who lived just a few generations ago were 
more physically active, and they weren’t exposed to nearly as many danger-
ous and deadly toxins as we are. They didn’t eat, drink, and breathe toxic 
materials every day.
These observations support the idea that inflammation, not cholesterol, is 
the major culprit in causing cardiovascular disease and circulatory problems.
Looking at the facts about cholesterol
Understanding just how natural and important cholesterol is should make 
you think twice about the idea that cholesterol is behind the majority of 
cases of cardiovascular disease. Here’s another tidbit that should raise your 
eyebrows: Fifty percent of people who have heart attacks don’t have high 
cholesterol. Isn’t that incredible? Doesn’t that statistic alone make it difficult 
to say that cholesterol is the cause of heart disease?

212
Part III: Enhancing Wellness through Detoxification 
Questioning the connections between cholesterol 
and cardiovascular disease
You can read study after study that makes the connection between high cho-
lesterol and circulatory problems look weaker and weaker. Here are a few to 
consider:
 
✓ The European Heart Journal published a study of 11,500 patients over 
three years that showed that patients with low cholesterol had a death 
rate more than twice as high as patients with high cholesterol.
 
✓ The Journal of Cardiac Failure (really uplifting reading material, I know) 
published an analysis of more than a thousand patients with heart dis-
ease and found low cholesterol to be associated with higher death rates. 
Interestingly, higher cholesterol increased the chance of survival.
 
✓ A study reported in the Archives of Gerontology and Geriatrics looked at 
mortality and age, sex, body mass index, and total cholesterol. When 
it came to cholesterol, higher death rates were connected only with 
people who had extremely low cholesterol.
That’s just the tip of the iceberg. You may be thinking, with all the evi-
dence that flies in the face of those who say that cholesterol is the biggest 
cause of cardiovascular disease, who is continuing to insist that’s the case? 
Well, consider this. A few years back a meeting of the National Cholesterol 
Education Program (NCEP) took place, and during that meeting the decision 
was made to lower the acceptable levels of cholesterol. As a result, 20 mil-
lion Americans who didn’t have high cholesterol levels before the meeting 
suddenly had them after the meeting. That’s pretty shocking, but it’s even 
more of a worry when you find out who sat on the committee that made the 
decision. Of the nine members on the committee, eight had financial connec-
tions to the manufacturers of statin drugs (drugs that are purported to lower 
cholesterol), and at the time they didn’t disclose those relationships. Sort of 
seems like a case of the fox guarding the hen house, does it not?
Realizing that statin drugs aren’t the answer
Conventional medicine’s biggest weapons in the fight against cholesterol are 
statin drugs. These are the drugs that can reduce cholesterol levels in your 
body. You may have seen commercials that say statin drugs will reduce car-
diovascular events (things like heart attacks) by about 33 percent. Sounds 
promising, right? Not so fast. Consider what the number means.
Let’s say that a drug company monitors 100 people who aren’t taking statin 
drugs, and three of those people have a heart attack. The company also 
monitors another 100 people who are taking statin drugs, and only two of 
them have a heart attack. Two versus three is a 33 percent decrease in heart 
attacks in the group taking statin drugs. Most people would look at that same 
data and say there there’s really a reduction of only 1 in 100, but of course 
the folks selling the statin drugs are interested in finessing the data in a 
slightly different way.

213
 Chapter 13: Improving Circulation
Here are a couple other reasons that you may want to think hard before turn-
ing to statin drugs as your primary means of fighting heart disease:
 
✓ Statin drugs slow down enzymes that the body uses to make cholesterol. 
However, some of these enzymes help to make other enzymes that are 
used in every cell in your body in the generation of energy. This is why 
people who take statins often have leg cramps and aches; their muscles 
basically run out of energy and start contracting in weird ways.
 
 You have an enzyme in your body called coenzyme Q10, which plays a 
key role in generating energy for your cells. Statin drugs can inhibit the 
production of coenzyme Q10, so if you’re taking statins be sure you’re 
also supplementing with coenzyme Q10.
 
✓ Several studies have demonstrated that statin drugs don’t reduce the 
size of the plaque in the arteries.
 
I’m a firm believer that inflammation caused by toxins is the major cause of 
plaque formation in blood vessels and, therefore, a top cause of heart disease. 
And I’m not the only person to hold this belief. If you want to keep your heart 
and your circulatory system in good shape, don’t immediately get fixated on 
cholesterol and start reaching for the statin drugs. Start by eating a healthy, 
detoxified diet; consider the methods of detoxification that I describe through-
out this book; and get plenty of exercise.
Supplementing to Help Circulation
Several natural supplements are showing quite a lot of promise in fighting 
circulatory system ailments. In addition, any supplement that helps to reduce 
toxicity is a huge step in the right direction. Here are some of the supple-
ments that have shown the most promise thus far:
 
✓ Alpha-lipoic acid (ALA): A powerful antioxidant that reduces blood 
pressure.
 
✓ Chlorella: Known to reduce blood pressure and help to reduce the 
levels of heavy metals in the body.
 
✓ Coenzyme Q10: Reverses energy starvation in the heart muscle, which 
can help prevent abnormal heart rhythms.
 
✓ Folic acid: Reduces blood pressure in women and peripheral vascular 
disease in men.
 
✓ Garlic: Good in your pasta and also as a supplement. It has a long his-
tory of reducing blood pressure and cholesterol.
 
✓ Ginseng: A dynamic supplement with a powerful antioxidant effect. It 
reduces hypertension, improves cardiovascular function, and improves 
glucose control.

214

✓ L-arginine: Improves the functioning of the cells that line the arteries 
and also improves exercise tolerance in patients with congestive heart 
failure.
 
✓ Lycopene: An antioxidant that was shown in the American Journal of 
Clinical Nutrition to cut cardiovascular disease by one half. Not bad!
 
✓ Magnesium: Lowers blood pressure and subsequent stress on the arter-
ies and heart muscle.
 
✓ Omega-3 fatty acids: Reduce your risk for heart disease. (These claims 
are supported by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.)
 
✓ Resveratrol: An antioxidant found in red wine and grape skins. You 
can also find it as a supplement in tablet or capsule form. A study in 
Cardiovascular Drug Reviews showed that resveratrol improves vascular 
cell function and helps to prevent the growth of plaque.
 
✓ Vitamin C: A potent antioxidant.
 
These supplements can be helpful, but you should always work hard to 
include as many antioxidant-rich foods in your diet a possible. Antioxidants 
are critical for neutralizing the reactive oxygen species (ROS) that I describe 
earlier in this chapter. Eat your organic fruits and veggies!
Recognizing the Importance of Exercise
Is there anyone who doesn’t agree that exercise is one of the most important 
things you can do to help keep your body healthy? Exercise has long been 
recognized and celebrated as a key component in a healthy, happy lifestyle. 
But in my view exercise still isn’t emphasized enough when it comes to its 
benefits and potential for preventing and treating disease, especially cardio-
vascular disease. I could fill up a chapter with the benefits of exercise for 
your circulatory system, but here are just a few highlights:
 
✓ Exercise causes temporary increases in blood pressure. I know that 
I’ve said several times in this chapter that high blood pressure is one 
of the worst things for your circulatory system, but the very short-term 
increases in blood pressure that result from exercise are actually good 
for you because they keep your blood vessels pliable and strengthen 
your heart muscle.
 
✓ Exercise reduces blood sugar levels, which in turn helps to reduce the 
toxic effects of sugar and insulin on your blood vessels and the rest of 
your circulatory system.
 
✓ Muscles that are being exercised are the only things that can take 
glucose out of your blood vessels and use it without the presence of 
insulin. Your brain is affected by blood glucose levels, so exercising is 
almost as good for the mind as it is for the body!

215
 Chapter 13: Improving Circulation
Making sure you exercise regularly
Many health and medical organizations suggest exercising three to five times 
per week. That’s fine, but I suggest that you should get some kind of exercise 
every day. If you exercise every day, you of course enjoy additional health 
benefits, but there’s another important factor to consider: Making exercise a 
normal part of your day is the only way that you can really make a habit out 
of it, which is a critical step. When exercise isn’t part of your daily routine, 
you’re much more likely to dread it and end up putting it off. Before you 
know it, you’re putting it off so much that you’re not even exercising three to 
five times per week.
If you don’t exercise at all now, exercising every day will probably seem like a 
struggle, but you need to force yourself to do it. For the first couple months, 
you may have to really fight the urge to skip exercising. But for most people, 
three months is the sweet spot; that’s the point by which exercise really 
becomes a habit. By then it gets a lot easier, and after three months most 
people say that they miss exercise and feel a lot worse if they don’t do it.
 
When you’re exercising, in addition to getting lots of good cardiovascular ben-
efits, you’re also working up a sweat. Sweating is one of the best ways to clear 
toxins out of your body, so you’re getting fit and detoxifying at the same time!
Considering a few different 
types of exercise
You should consider doing several different types of exercise, each of which 
has unique benefits:
 
✓ Aerobic exercise increases your heart rate and your body’s need for 
oxygen. Walking and jogging are common types of aerobic exercise. I 
recommend walking because of the injuries incurred from jogging. Can 
you believe that of all the sports activities in the United States (including 
professional sports), jogging causes the most injuries? If you’re already 
a jogger, please just be careful to stretch, wear appropriate shoes, and 
take good care of your joints.
 
 If you don’t currently exercise but you want to begin walking, your 
goal should be to start slow and walk for short periods of time. Over 
the course of a few weeks (or months, if you’re in bad shape now), you 
should be able to reach the point where you’re walking as fast as you 
can for up to 30 minutes a day. Most people can walk 4 miles per hour 
when they’re walking quickly, so you should be able to walk about 2 
miles in a 30-minute walking session.

216
Part III: Enhancing Wellness through Detoxification 
 
 If you have medical problems, you should contact your physician to 
make sure that it’s safe for you to exercise. If you have a problem with 
any weight-bearing parts of your body, you may be able to exercise on a 
bicycle or stationary bike. Some people also like stair climbers. The idea 
is to find what you can do and keep with it. People with arthritic prob-
lems often find that exercise increases their ability to perform activities 
without pain.
 
✓ Resistance training (or weight training) includes a whole variety of 
maneuvers that involve pushing or pulling on something that doesn’t 
easily move. It’s a great way to build strength and muscle tone, which 
increases endurance in performing daily activities. Resistance training 
also has beneficial effects on glucose utilization. The amount of resis-
tance used will be different for each person but should be taxing to 
produce good results. You’ll have a harder time working up a sweat with 
resistance training than with aerobic exercise, but give it a try. You may 
get to the point where you’re pumping iron and pumping excess iron 
(and other heavy metals) out of your body through your sweat!
 
✓ Rebounding, which is a type of exercise that is often overlooked, 
involves the use of a rebounder or mini trampoline. Some people scoff 
at this kind of workout, but they shouldn’t be so quick to dismiss it. 
There’s a unique process in play with rebounding: As you bounce, you 
reach a maximum height before you start down. At that instant, you 
are effectively at zero gravity. When that happens, every blood vessel 
in your body enjoys minimal effects from blood pressure. At the other 
end of a bounce, when you’re at the bottom and start to come up again, 
you experience two to three times the force of gravity, and your blood 
pushes hard against the walls of your blood vessels. This up and down 
pressure on the blood vessels helps to keep them toned and flexible, 
which can have extremely positive effects on their health. Rebounding 
also increases the flow of lymph throughout you body, which is very 
beneficial for you immune system. Of course, if you’re very clumsy and 
bounce off the mini trampoline and break a lamp, your blood pressure 
will likely get a real spike, but that shouldn’t happen too often after you 
get the hang of it!
 
If you want to really see the benefits of exercise, try incorporating all three 
types I mention here: aerobic, resistance, and rebounding. Set a weekly sched-
ule, and do each method on a different day. You’ll get some wonderful circula-
tory system benefits, but you’ll also give virtually every other part of your body 
a boost, as well. Exercise stimulates the gastrointestinal tract to be more regu-
lar, increases endorphins (the feel-good chemicals in the brain), helps to defeat 
depression, and does terrific things for the lungs. If you can work up and main-
tain a good sweat, you’ll also help to flush out toxins from your body, which will 
take stress off your immune system and help to protect you from illness.
I personally believe that daily exercise and sweating will give you at least 
ten extra years of disease-free, healthy life (if you combine these efforts with 
detoxification and a reduction in the amount of toxins you take in, of course).

T Fennel Orange Salad 
 
with Sesame Dressing
Fennel is high in quercetin flavonoids, which are powerful antioxidants. It also contains 
anethole, which reduces inflammation in the body and can be a great way to fight car-
diovascular disease. And both fennel and oranges are very high in vitamin C, which neu-
tralizes free radicals. Fiber, potassium, and folate (a B vitamin), which are also present 
in fennel, help reduce the amount of homocysteine in your blood. Homocysteine levels 
are considered a risk factor for heart attacks.
Perhaps the most amazing thing about fennel is that while it contains a huge variety of 
healthy materials, it also tastes wonderful! It’s crunchy and sweet with a licorice taste — 
the perfect complement to juicy and tart oranges.
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Yield: 6 servings
2 large bulbs organic fennel, trimmed
4 cups organic watercress, rinsed
4 large oranges, peeled, pith removed, and sliced 
1/3-inch thick
3 organic radishes, thinly sliced
2 tablespoons flaxseed oil
2 tablespoons freshly squeezed orange juice
1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice
2 teaspoons apple cider vinegar
1/4 teaspoon stevia
Pinch cayenne pepper
2 tablespoons sesame seeds
 1 Cut the root end off the fennel and cut off the tough green stems, leaving some green 
attached to the bulb. Pull off the outer skin and discard. Cut fennel bulb in half, then 
thinly slice it crosswise. Arrange on watercress on a serving platter with oranges and 
radishes.
 2 In small bowl, combine oil, orange juice, lemon juice, vinegar, stevia, and pepper; mix 
well. Drizzle over salad and top with sesame seeds. Serve immediately.

T Banana-Watermelon 
 
Smoothie
Smoothies are so easy to make, and everyone loves them. They will cool you down on a 
hot day, and nothing makes a better breakfast when you’re a little bit pressed for time.
Watermelon is very high in lycopene, an antioxidant that can help reduce the risk of car-
diovascular disease. Men who had high levels of lycopene in their body fat were 50 per-
cent less likely to suffer a heart attack. You can only obtain lycopene by eating red or 
pink fruits and vegetables, like tomatoes, cherries, watermelon, and pink grapefruit.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Yield: 3–4 servings
3 cups cubed organic watermelon
2 bananas, frozen, peeled, and cut into chunks
2 tablespoons flaxseed oil
3 tablespoons local organic honey
1/3 cup plain organic yogurt
1/4 cup freshly squeezed orange juice
 1 Combine all ingredients in food processor or blender and process or blend until 
smooth. Serve immediately.

T Spicy Black Bean and 
 
Spinach Soup
Black beans and spinach contain lots of magnesium, a nutrient essential to lung and 
heart health. Combined with tomatoes, which are high in lycopene, and flaxseed, which 
contains lots of omega-3 fatty acids, this soup is like a prescription in a bowl (only tast-
ier and much more natural)!
You can make this soup ahead of time; just leave out the spinach, flaxseed oil, lemon 
juice, and seeds. Refrigerate up to three days. Gently reheat the soup, and then bring it 
to a simmer. Add the spinach and let wilt, and then continue with the recipe.
Preparation time: 10 minutes plus overnight soaking time
Cooking time: 2 hours 45 minutes
Yield: 6 servings
2 cups dried organic black beans
6 cups filtered water
2 organic onions, peeled and chopped
6 cloves organic garlic, peeled and minced
2 organic jalapeno peppers, minced
4 ripe red organic tomatoes, chopped
2 large organic carrots, sliced
1 teaspoon turmeric
1 tablespoon fresh organic oregano leaves
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
6 cups organic baby spinach leaves
2 tablespoons flaxseed oil
2–3 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice
1/3 cup roasted organic pumpkin seeds
1/4 cup roasted organic sunflower seeds
 1 Look over black beans, picking out any shriveled beans or extraneous matter. Rinse 
beans well and drain. Place in large bowl; cover with 6 cups water. Cover and let stand 
overnight.
 2 In the morning, drain the beans and place in large pot. Add 1 chopped onion and 3 
cloves garlic; cover with 9 cups filtered water. Bring to a simmer; reduce heat to low, 
cover, and simmer 2 hours until beans are tender.
 3 In skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add remaining onion, remaining garlic, and 
jalapeno peppers; cook 4–5 minutes until tender. Add to black beans along with toma-
toes, carrots, turmeric, oregano, and cayenne pepper. Bring to a simmer; simmer 30–40 
minutes until vegetables are tender.
 4 Stir in spinach leaves; cook and stir until spinach wilts. Remove from heat and stir in 
flaxseed oil and lemon juice. Serve immediately, garnished with pumpkin and sunflower 
seeds.

Baked Ginger Salmon with 
 
Tomato Coulis and Asparagus
You should eat wild salmon twice a week for your health. This robust and flavorful fish 
is bursting with omega-3 fatty acids, which are very important to heart health. And 
adding ingredients high in lycopene and vitamin C, like tomatoes, makes this dish even 
better for you.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: 1 hour
Yield: 4 servings
4 (6–8 ounce) wild Alaskan salmon steaks
1 tablespoon organic olive oil
1/4 cup minced fresh organic ginger root
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice
1/8 teaspoon white pepper
2 red organic tomatoes, chopped
1 yellow organic tomato, chopped
2 cups organic grape tomatoes
1/4 cup finely chopped organic green onions
1/4 cup freshly squeezed orange juice
1 tablespoon flaxseed oil
1 clove garlic, minced
1/2 cup chopped organic flat-leaf parsley
1/2 cup chopped organic basil leaves
1 pound organic asparagus
2 cups filtered water
 1 Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Place salmon on baking dish. In small bowl, combine 
olive oil, ginger root, 2 cloves minced garlic, lemon juice, and pepper; spread over 
salmon. Bake salmon for 25–40 minutes until fish flakes with a fork.
 2 In medium bowl, combine all the tomatoes, onions, orange juice, flaxseed oil, 1 minced 
clove garlic, parsley, and basil. Cover and refrigerate.
 3 Meanwhile, heat water and asparagus until simmering; reduce heat to low and simmer 
5–6 minutes until crisp-tender. Drain.
 4 When salmon flakes when tested with a fork, place on serving platter along with aspara-
gus. Serve the tomato mixture on the side.

W
ant to shorten your lifespan, ruin your health, and pump yourself full 
of thousands of dangerous, harmful toxins? All you have to do is take 
a stroll down to the nearest gas station, pick up a pack of cigarettes, and light 
up. When it comes to introducing toxins into your body and degrading your 
health at a rapid rate, very few things can stack up with smoking.
Smoking is involved in one out of five deaths in the United States each year. 
Direct causes of death associated with smoking include emphysema, bron-
chitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and cancer. These are truly 
agonizing conditions, and they are awful ways to die. Smoking also decreases 
the amount of life you get to live before you’re faced with those sorts of awful 
diseases: On average, smokers die 13 to 14 years earlier than nonsmokers.
As a society, we pay a great price for the damages done to our fellow citizens 
by smoking. Medical expenses and time lost from work because of smoking 
cost us an estimated $193 billion every year. Imagine all the good we could 
do with that kind of money if we could somehow convince everyone to cut 
out the smoking habit.

Part III: Enhancing Wellness through Detoxification 
I know you’ve probably heard plenty of statistics about the dangers of smok-
ing, so I’ll stop there and let you know how I’d like to bring detoxification into 
the smoking conversation. After you’ve quit smoking, your body begins to heal 
itself almost immediately. You can do quite a lot of good for your body and 
make the process much easier if you embrace a few detoxification methods.
I have three goals in this chapter:
 
✓ To give you a very full picture of the amount and range of toxins that 
you put into your body when you smoke. I think it’s important for you 
to realize just how toxic smoking can be, so you can be even more 
motivated to quit if you’re a smoker now and even less likely to pick up 
smoking if you’re not a smoker.
 
✓ To explain two alternative methods for smoking cessation — acupunc-
ture and hypnosis — that dovetail very nicely with a detoxification life-
style.
 
✓ To present detoxification techniques that can be a boon for your body 
as it begins to heal and rebuild after a smoking addiction is defeated.
Before I get started, note that most of the details in this chapter apply to all 
types of smoking (cigarettes, cigars, pipes, and even secondhand smoke), 
and many are relevant for users of smokeless tobacco, too.
Realizing the Monumental 
Toxic Impact of Smoking
About 4,000 chemicals are present in cigarette smoke. As much as I’d like to 
list all of them here to really emphasize the dangers associated with smok-
ing, I’m afraid I just don’t have the space. Instead, I cover a few of the main 
groups of toxins that enter your body when you inhale tobacco smoke, with 
the hope that even a small sampling will convince you that smoking is essen-
tially the opposite of detoxification.
Carcinogens
Tobacco smoke contains more than 50 known carcinogens: chemicals that 
cause cancer. Fifty! The carcinogenic effect of smoke is so great that the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has classified tobacco smoke as a 
group A carcinogen. (That’s the most dangerous group.)

223
 Chapter 14: Help Your Body Heal after a Smoking Addiction
 
What do all these carcinogens do? Well, back in 1964 the U.S. Surgeon General 
reported that smoking was causative in cancer of the lungs and the larynx 
(voice box). That was the beginning. Later, smoking was shown to be caus-
ative for cancers of the bladder, esophagus, mouth, and throat. The latest 
releases connect smoking to some kinds of leukemia, stomach cancer, pancre-
atic cancer, cervical cancer, liver cancer, prostate cancer, and kidney cancer. 
(Smoking hasn’t been shown to be a primary cause in this last group, but it 
has a high association with these conditions. And let’s be honest: Would 
anyone really be surprised if smoking caused these conditions?)
Carbon monoxide
Carbon monoxide is a dangerous gas that can easily cause death if you’re 
exposed to enough of it. This gas is present in automobile exhaust and in 
many types of industrial waste. Carbon monoxide is particularly nasty for 
your health because it attaches to the red blood cells where oxygen is sup-
posed to attach, and it does so about 200 times more effectively than oxygen.
 
In a heavy smoker, the oxygen-carrying capacity of red blood cells can be 
reduced as much as 15 percent by carbon monoxide. This is a significant 
reduction in the ability of your blood to carry oxygen to your tissues. Smoking 
really does suffocate every last corner of your body.
Nicotine
This toxin is the main cause of physical addiction to smoking. Nicotine does 
some strange, harmful things to your body, including the following:
 
✓ Constricting blood vessels
 
✓ Increasing blood pressure
 
✓ Decreasing blood flow
 
✓ Causing cold hands and feet
 
✓ Creating chest pain
 
✓ Stimulating the adrenal glands, which affects cardiovascular function
 
✓ Decreasing bicarbonate release from the pancreas, which slows digestion
 
✓ Making blood platelets more likely to clump, increasing the risk of clots
As you’d probably guess, none of these effects is positive or healthy for your 
body.

224
Part III: Enhancing Wellness through Detoxification 
Other chemical toxins
Here’s a very quick look at just a few of the other chemical toxins lurking in 
cigarette smoke. All of them are toxic, some are thought to be carcinogenic, 
and many are very strong irritants:
 
✓ Acetone: A very strong irritant also found in fingernail polish remover 
and varnish remover.
 
✓ Acrolein: An extremely toxic chemical to the lungs.
 
✓ Ammonia: A strong irritant similar to the ammonia in cleaning fluids.
 
✓ Creosote: Used to treat railroad ties. It’s a toxic component of the tar in 
cigarette smoke.
 
✓ Hydrogen cyanide: A deadly toxic poison commonly used as a rat killer.
 
✓ Toluene: Very toxic and used to make paint and varnish remover.
 
✓ Vinyl chloride: Used to make vinyl. It causes dizziness, headaches, and 
fatigue, and long-term exposure can lead to cancer and liver damage.
This list really could go on for pages and pages. But isn’t the presence of just 
one of these materials in cigarette smoke enough to keep you from picking up 
a pack?
Heavy metals
The presence of heavy metal toxins in our environment is on the rise, and 
you certainly don’t need to add to the problem by smoking. Tobacco smoke 
is lousy with heavy metals, and the secondhand smoke that comes off the 
end of a lit cigarette (often called sidestream smoke) is particularly bad. For 
example, there’s six times as much cadmium — a dangerous heavy metal 
toxin — in sidestream smoke as in the smoke inhaled by a smoker.
Here are just a few examples of the heavy metals you can find in tobacco 
smoke:
 
✓ Arsenic: An extremely toxic, deadly poison.
 
✓ Cadmium: Often found in large amounts in cigarette smoke; shown to 
cause a variety of cancers.
 
✓ Lead: Highly toxic and present in almost all forms of tobacco smoke.
 
✓ Lead 210: A unique type of radioactive lead.

225
 Chapter 14: Help Your Body Heal after a Smoking Addiction
You need to be spending your time and efforts limiting your exposure to 
heavy metals and working to detoxify your body, not deliberately adding 
them to your lungs through smoking.
Choosing a Smoking Cessation Method
Ask anyone who has ever tried to stop smoking: A smoking addiction is one 
of the most difficult bad habits to quit. Statistics show that 70 percent of 
smokers want to quit, and 40 percent try to stop smoking every year. Eight 
out of ten smokers start the habit before they’re 18 years old, and 20 percent 
of high school students smoke. Starting at such an early age makes the actual 
habit of smoking very ingrained and even more difficult to kick.
The nicotine in tobacco smoke is extremely addictive on a physical level. It 
has a very significant effect on your brain, stimulating pleasure centers and 
increasing natural “feel good” chemicals like norepinephrine, dopamine, 
and serotonin. Nicotine also causes a release of adrenaline from the adrenal 
glands.
The physical aspects of smoking addiction are bad, but the mental and 
behavioral aspects can be just as troublesome. Many smokers associate 
having a cigarette with a time for relaxation and pleasure. They smoke during 
the good times in their day — maybe when they get off of work or after they 
eat a good meal. Or they make cigarettes part of several daily rituals like 
getting in the car, talking on the phone, and taking a coffee break. For these 
types of smokers, quitting is extra difficult because they associate smoking 
with so many different facets of their lives.
If you’re a smoker and you want to quit, you have lots of options, including 
the following:
 
✓ Quitting cold turkey: This method involves simply dropping the habit 
all at once, with no real planning or weaning of any kind. Research 
shows that quitting cold turkey is only about 5 percent effective.
 
✓ Using nicotine patches or gum: Many of these options started out as 
prescription only, but most are now available over the counter. The 
patches have shown a success rate of over 20 percent, but the gum is 
quite a bit less effective.
 
✓ Taking prescription drugs: A handful of prescription drugs for smoking 
cessation are on the market. Typically, I’m not a fan of turning to a pill to 
solve health problems. But in this case you have to weigh the potential 
benefits of quitting smoking against any ill effects from the prescription. 
Do some research and talk to your doctor if you’re interested.

226
Part III: Enhancing Wellness through Detoxification 
These are some of the most common methods for kicking the smoking habit, 
but they’re certainly not your only choices. I devote the rest of this section to 
two smoking cessation techniques that often fly under the radar but happen 
to fit in very nicely with a detoxification lifestyle: hypnosis and acupuncture. 
Both are toxin-free, holistic methods for snuffing out the smoking habit. If 
you’re a smoker and you’re looking to quit, I recommend taking them into 
consideration.
Getting help from hypnosis
In 1958, the American Medical Association recognized hypnosis as an appro-
priate therapy for the treatment of smoking addiction. Since that time, a 
whole host of hypnosis methods has been developed to help people stop 
smoking. Many of the practitioners suggest that hypnosis can work for smok-
ing cession because it enhances relaxation, motivation, and self control, 
which are all key factors for anyone who’s trying to stop smoking. Some prac-
titioners use a posthypnotic suggestion to avoid cigarettes. Another method 
is to use hypnosis to replace the physical motion of reaching for a cigarette 
with another innocuous motion, such as squeezing your earlobe. I know that 
method may sound a little odd, but let’s face it: Squeezing your earlobe is 
quite a bit better for your health than inhaling about 50 known carcinogens 
several times a day.
The data collected on successful smoking cessation through hypnosis 
varies quite a bit, but most of the numbers point to a success rate of about 
20 percent. Some individual practitioners claim much higher success rates, 
though — some as high as 90 percent.
If you’re a smoker and you’d like to really look into using hypnosis to curb 
the habit, the first step is finding the right practitioner. The key is network-
ing. Start by asking your physician if she knows of a good option. Then ask 
your friends and family; you may be surprised who has received hypno-
therapy before. There may also be a local or state society of hypnotherapy 
practitioners in your area, so do some online searching to find out. If such 
a society or organization exists in your area, contact the office and ask for 
a recommendation. And always evaluate several possibilities before making 
your choice.
Adding acupuncture to your toolbox
If you’re the kind of person who likes health and medical practices that have 
been around for a while, acupuncture just may be for you. The practice, 
which involves stimulating specific points on the body with long, thin, metal 

227
 Chapter 14: Help Your Body Heal after a Smoking Addiction
needles, has been around for about 5,000 years and has become a more and 
more popular method for smoking cessation in recent years.
The research on the benefits of acupuncture for quitting smoking is scat-
tered and generally weak, so it’s tough to wrap any hard numbers around the 
potential for acupuncture in smoking cessation. I do think the practice has 
merit, though, and like so many of the other methods for kicking the smoking 
habit, it’s worth considering even if the success rates are fairly low, given the 
horrendous health effects that smoking causes.
If you want to look into visiting an acupuncturist for help with your smoking 
addiction, be sure you do lots of research before selecting a practitioner. The 
difference in the skills of individual practitioners is huge. Some have been 
trained by masters of this art for years and are very skilled. Unfortunately, 
others hang out a shingle after only a week-long course.
 
To be certain your acupuncturist is talented, practiced, and safe, flip back to 
Chapter 5 and read my suggestions for how to select an alternative practitio-
ner. Focus on vetting credentials, speaking with current and past clients, and 
confirming affiliations with any trade organizations and other groups.
Sweating Out Cigarette Toxins
If you haven’t quit smoking yet, detoxing is crucial. Many of the toxins in ciga-
rette smoke are fat-soluble, and one of the best ways to detoxify for fat-solu-
ble toxins is sweating. (Read all about the detoxification benefits of sweating 
in Chapter 18.) If you’ve been a smoker for any extended period of time, you 
almost certainly have quite a large collection of toxins built up in your body’s 
fat cells. Those toxins are like a ticking bomb: It’s only a matter of time until 
they start fouling up your body’s important systems, if they haven’t already.
When you’ve finally snuffed out your last cigarette, you should immediately 
begin thinking about the ways you can increase the amount of sweating you 
do for detoxification purposes. That’s a surefire way to help your body get 
rid of the residual fat-soluble toxins that are still hanging around from your 
days as a smoker.
 
Sweating is a powerful means of detoxification. It has one-third the detoxifica-
tion potential of your kidneys, which are world-class detoxification power-
houses. Check out Chapter 18 for a rundown of how you can use sweating to 
ramp up the amount of toxins that you flush from your body.

Supplementing to Heal Your Body
Before or after you’ve stopped smoking, your body has to deal with the 
effects of all the toxins that you inhaled over the months or years you were a 
smoker. You can play an active role in that process by taking some of the fol-
lowing supplements:
 
✓ Glutathione is one of our body’s most important antioxidants, and it 
can help undo some of the damage that smoking did to your body after 
you’ve put down the pack. You can find glutathione as a supplement 
to be taken orally, and you can also boost its effect by pairing it with a 
melatonin supplement.
 
✓ Vitamin C is another extremely important antioxidant, and your body 
has to use a lot of it to thwart the damaging effects of smoking. It’s not 
uncommon for smokers to have very low levels of vitamin C in their 
bodies. If you’re trying to quit smoking or if you’ve already been suc-
cessful in doing so, be sure you’re supplementing with lots and lots of 
vitamin C. You need at least 2,000 mg for good health, but don’t hesitate 
to ramp up your dose to 4,000 mg per day if you’ve recently stopped 
smoking. It’ll do quite a lot to help your body heal.
 
✓ Vitamin A, like vitamin C, is decreased by smoking, so vitamin A supple-
ments are very useful for people who are trying to quit or those who 
have just kicked the habit.
 
✓ Green tea, grape seed extract, and tryptophan are all great for former 
smokers. All three supplements fortify the immune system and replace 
the important materials in your body that tobacco toxins deplete.
 
✓ Alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) deserves a special note. It supports liver func-
tion in an amazing way. Smoking puts an incredible toxic strain on the 
liver, so be sure to take an ALA supplement to help get your liver back in 
healthy working order.
Counting Calories after You Quit
 
Weight gain is a common side effect of smoking cessation, and that shouldn’t 
surprise anyone. While you’re smoking, your body has to expend about 375 
calories each day in an effort to repair the toxic damage that smoking causes. 
If you stop smoking and you don’t also make healthy changes to your diet and 
exercise routine, you run a real risk for weight gain. In addition to the calories 
that are no longer needed to repair the harm that smoking causes, recent 
quitters also often replace the oral habit of smoking with eating. And that new 
habit sure isn’t slowed down by the fact that food tastes a heck of a lot better 
after you quit smoking.

229
 Chapter 14: Help Your Body Heal after a Smoking Addiction
Putting on a few pounds instead of lighting up multiple times a day is defi-
nitely the lesser of two evils, but no one really wants weight gain to be the 
reward for finally winning the war against smoking. But here’s the good news: 
You can quit smoking and avoid weight gain by making some relatively minor 
adjustments to your eating and exercising. Focus hard on sticking to the 
detox diet plans I describe in Chapters 7 and 9, and be sure to get at least 
30 minutes of vigorous exercise each day. That should be enough to keep 
you from adding on a few pounds after you’ve waved goodbye to a smoking 
addiction.
Recipes for Helping You Kick 
the Smoking Habit
When you’re trying to stop smoking, or if you recently stopped, eating 
healthy food is a key way to help your body repair the damage done by smok-
ing. An antioxidant-rich diet will give your body the fuel it needs to fight off 
smoking-related toxins.
Smoking cessation makes food taste better, so many former smokers find 
themselves eating quite a bit more than they did when the tar and other 
nasty materials from smoking were dulling their taste buds. If you quit smok-
ing and find that foods taste a lot better than they did before, be sure you’re 
focusing your meals on healthy food options; that way, if you’re tempted to 
take a few extra bites, at least they’ll be bites of the good stuff. Here are a few 
recipe suggestions for people who are trying to quit smoking or those who 
have recently won the battle.

Chapter 15
Drowning Alcohol Abuse
In This Chapter
▶ Recognizing alcohol as a toxin and understanding its 
dangers
▶ Using detox methods to help your body beat alcohol’s 
effects
A
lcohol is the most common toxic chemical 
ingested today. About two-thirds of adults in 
the United States drink alcohol, and its effects on 
our bodies are wide ranging and can be very serious. Drinking alcohol is so 
common that you can easily forget it’s an extremely potent toxin.
My goal in this chapter is to give you a full sense of what this toxin can do 
to your body. It’s not a pretty picture, as you may guess. I then clue you in 
on some detoxification methods that can both reduce the harmful effects of 
alcohol and also help you to avoid drinking too much booze.
One quick note before I dive in. You may have read or heard that certain 
amounts of alcohol can be good for you, and for the most part that seems 
to be true. Medical research has shown that 2 to 3 ounces of alcohol per 
day can offer beneficial effects for your cardiovascular system. Also, several 
types of antioxidants, including flavonoids and resveratrol, are present in 
certain kinds of alcohol like red wine and dark beer. That’s all well and good, 
and if you consume alcohol on that very limited level, it may boost your 
health in some ways. But the line between just enough and too much alco-
hol appears to be very thin; studies have also shown that more than 2 to 3 
ounces of alcohol per day have a negative impact on your body.
 
Throughout this chapter, I use a very general gauge of quantity when it 
comes to alcohol. Because alcohol content differs from drink to drink, the line 
between safe, healthy drinking and unhealthy drinking can be a moving target. 
Very broadly speaking, you’re in the safe zone if you have two drinks per day, 
and a drink can be loosely defined as a can or bottle of beer, a glass of wine, or 
a 1.5-ounce serving of 80 proof liquor.

Understanding the Toxic 
Effects of Alcohol
Make no mistake: Alcohol is a toxin. When you drink an alcoholic beverage, 
the alcohol is absorbed from your intestines into your bloodstream and 
taken to your liver. Your liver recognizes it as a toxin and does its best to 
break down the alcohol in an effort to detoxify it. (About 95 percent of the 
alcohol you drink is broken down by your liver, and only about 5 percent is 
removed via your kidneys, sweat, and breathing.)
 
Your liver is an amazing organ and typically gives alcohol detoxification the ol’ 
college try, but it isn’t able to detoxify all the alcohol. If your liver is healthy, 
it breaks down alcohol at the rate of 2 to 3 ounces per hour. As a result, some 
alcohol ends up spreading through your body, where it gets widely distrib-
uted and produces its toxic effects.
Short-term effects of overconsumption
As you know if you’ve consumed multiple alcoholic drinks in a short span 
of time, the level of toxicity is related directly to the amount of alcohol you 
ingest. The toxic effects of alcohol begin in the brain, and they include the 
following:
 
✓ Aggressiveness
 
✓ Alteration in sexual inhibition
 
✓ Anesthesia
 
✓ Drowsiness
 
✓ Euphoria
 
✓ Impaired judgment
 
✓ Mood changes
 
✓ Release of inhibitions
 
✓ Sedation
Alcohol’s effects on the brain are compounded by the changes it causes in the 
rest of your body’s tissues, from your muscles to your eyes and everything in 
between. Here are a few of the other common effects of alcohol toxicity:
 
✓ Altered depth perception
 
✓ Decreased muscle function
 
✓ Decreased vision at night

237
 Chapter 15: Drowning Alcohol Abuse
 
✓ Decreased visual focus
 
✓ Impaired motor skills
If you’ve ever consumed too much alcohol, you’ve likely experienced one or 
several of these toxic effects. But alcohol toxicity doesn’t stop there — not 
by a long shot. The potent toxic impact of alcohol can continue to cause 
much more serious effects on your body, including death. Alcohol can effec-
tively paralyze your diaphragm — the muscle that is responsible for expand-
ing and contracting your lungs — causing you to stop breathing and die from 
a lack of oxygen. Your heart can also be damaged, and booze can cause fatal 
irregularities in your heart’s rhythm.
Long-term effects of overconsumption
The types of toxic effects I list in the previous section can result from a single 
episode involving a large amount of alcohol consumption. But what happens 
when you consume a lot of alcohol over a long period of time? (I’m talking 
about years here.) The resultant health problems are even more varied, and 
they include some very troubling mental conditions.
Long-term exposure to alcohol causes changes in personality that surface as 
anger, rage, anxiety, depression, fatigue, and lack of self-esteem, as well as 
self-loathing, intense guilt, and remorse.
 
Depression is one of the most dangerous mental effects of abusing alcohol 
over a long period of time. Alcohol abuse can lead to depression, and many 
people who suffer alcohol-related depression turn to booze as a way to get 
temporary relief from their depression. That quickly turns into a cycle that 
can ruin a person’s life, and it’s very hard break.
The physical impact of long-term exposure to alcohol is centered primarily on 
the nerves, brain, and liver, and I give each one of these areas attention here. 
I also give you a glimpse into the serious problems that booze can cause for 
your sleep patterns. These problems are little known but extremely serious, 
especially given that most people don’t get enough healthy sleep as it is.
Nasty for your nerves
The medical community has been debating for years the damage that alco-
hol does to your peripheral nerves, which are all the nerves that aren’t part 
of your brain or spinal cord. One camp insists that alcohol damages these 
nerves directly, while the other says that the vitamin and mineral deficien-
cies that result from drinking alcohol are to blame. Which group is right? 
Well, for the purposes of detoxification, it doesn’t really matter. The point 
is that everyone agrees alcohol has a nasty toxic impact on your peripheral 
nerves, and the damage is severe and often long lasting. Here’s a short list of 
the symptoms that you can experience as a result of that damage:

238
Part III: Enhancing Wellness through Detoxification 
 
✓ Heat intolerance
 
✓ Impotence in men
 
✓ Muscle weakness due to nerve dysfunction
 
✓ Numbness in the feet, which spreads up the legs
 
✓ Numbness in the fingers, which spreads up the hands
 
✓ Pain in the arms and legs
 
✓ “Pins and needles” sensations in the feet and legs
 
✓ “Pins and needles” sensations in the hands and arms
 
✓ Problems with urination, including incontinence, difficulty starting uri-
nation, and incomplete emptying of the bladder
Sounds pretty awful, doesn’t it? Well, the problems don’t stop there. As if the 
damage to the peripheral nerves isn’t enough, alcohol also causes debilitat-
ing effects on the autonomic nerves, which are the nerves that control your 
body’s automatic functions. Long-term alcohol abuse can really foul up the 
functioning of those nerves, and the results are painful (both for the drinker 
and for his family and friends to watch). Here’s a quick rundown of what can 
happen:
 
✓ Constipation
 
✓ Decrease in stomach activity
 
✓ Diarrhea
 
✓ Difficulty swallowing
 
✓ Loss of control of heart rate
 
✓ Radical drop in blood pressure when standing up
 
✓ Speech problems
 
✓ Vomiting
Your nerves are extremely complex tissues, and you can do them a huge 
amount of harm by drinking too much toxic alcohol. Is that extra glass of 
wine or mixed drink really worth it? If for some reason you aren’t convinced, 
take a look at what alcohol abuse can do to your brain.
Bad for your brain
Long-term alcohol use damages your brain in all kinds of ways. At the top of 
the list is the killing off of brain cells. The fact that alcohol can destroy your 
brain’s cells should give you a pretty good indication of how bad it is for 
what many people consider to be the most awe-inspiring and complex struc-
ture in the natural world.

239
 Chapter 15: Drowning Alcohol Abuse
In addition to the direct damage that alcohol does to your brain, it also cre-
ates vitamin and mineral deficiencies that rob your brain of the materials it 
needs to take care of even basic functions.
Finally, the damage that alcohol does to your liver (I tackle that topic in the 
next section) means that it isn’t able to detoxify your body efficiently, and 
many other toxins that would’ve been broken down in the liver are therefore 
allowed to roam free in your bloodstream. It doesn’t take long for these other 
toxins to reach your brain and begin affecting it in a very dangerous way.
This triple threat of alcohol’s harmful effects on your brain — direct effects, 
vitamin and mineral deficiencies, and increased general toxicity — often ends 
in catastrophic damage to brain function. Let me fill you in on just a few of 
the possibilities:
 
✓ Abnormal emotional function.
 
✓ Dramatic decrease in problem-solving abilities.
 
✓ Loss of function of intelligent behavior.
 
✓ Loss of long-term and short-term memory; amnesia.
 
✓ Loss of the ability to use senses such as sight and smell.
 
✓ Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, which is triggered by a severe lack of vita-
min B1 (also called thiamine). Symptoms include confusion, hallucina-
tions, coma, and death if left untreated.
That’s just a sampling; the list really could go on for pages.
Lousy for your liver
The burden of detoxifying alcohol in your body falls almost exclusively 
on your liver, so it’s no surprise that alcoholic liver disease affects a large 
number of heavy drinkers. Three kinds of liver damage result from alcohol 
toxicity:
 
✓ Alcoholic hepatitis: This inflammation of the liver tissue is caused by 
alcohol and acetaldehyde, a very toxic substance that the liver produces 
when it’s trying to break down alcohol. Symptoms include jaundice, 
fever, abdominal tenderness and pain, nausea, vomiting, and loss of 
appetite. This condition can be caused by a single drinking binge and 
can last for years. Thirty-five percent of heavy drinkers develop alco-
holic hepatitis.
 
✓ Alcoholic cirrhosis: When alcohol cause normal liver tissue to be 
replaced by scar tissue, alcoholic cirrhosis is the result. Liver function is 
severely hindered by cirrhosis, and the condition is irreversible. Twenty 
percent of heavy drinkers develop cirrhosis, and it kills tens of thou-
sands of people every year in the United States alone.

240
Part III: Enhancing Wellness through Detoxification 
 
✓ Fatty liver: When alcohol causes fatty liver, the liver’s normal cells are 
replaced with fat cells. The liver becomes enlarged, but its function is 
greatly reduced.
In addition to these three specific debilitating conditions, alcohol ruins your 
liver in several other general ways, which create indirect problems with 
many other parts of your body. When your liver detoxifies alcohol, it creates 
byproducts that are damaging not only to the liver but also to your body’s 
other tissues. These chemicals are responsible for large scale inflammation. 
If you check out Chapter 13, which is all about the toxins that harm your cir-
culatory system and how you can limit their effects, you’ll realize that most 
heart disease is caused by inflammation. The harmful chemicals can be coun-
tered by antioxidants, but when you add in the taxing effects of all the other 
toxins we take in on a daily basis, it’s really hard to get enough antioxidants 
to win the war.
Your liver is also an important storage facility. It stores glycogen (a storable 
form of glucose), as well as vitamins B12, A, and D. And your liver’s crucial 
functions don’t stop there: Your liver converts fats and glucose to energy, 
produces cholesterol your body uses to create hormones, and synthesizes 
critical amino acids. If your liver has to spend all its time detoxifying alcohol, 
it has limited resources for performing these other vital functions, and your 
health can completely fall apart as a result.
 
When taken with alcohol, certain drugs (both prescription and over-the-
counter) can cause extreme and irreversible damage to your liver, and even 
death. At the top of the list are drugs containing acetaminophen, pain killers, 
anti-anxiety medications, and drugs prescribed to reduce cholesterol.
Stealing healthy sleep
The effect of alcohol on your sleeping patterns merits special attention 
because the problem is serious and often misunderstood.
Alcohol causes sleepiness. However, when you go to sleep with alcohol in 
your system, you don’t get normal, healthy sleep. Alcohol prevents your 
body from going into a particular state of sleep when your muscles are 
completely relaxed and 95 percent of dreaming occurs. You don’t need to 
consume much alcohol for this problem to happen; only about 6 ounces will 
harm your sleep patterns in a serious way.
After your liver manages to detoxify all the alcohol in your system — remem-
ber, that’s about 2 to 3 ounces per hour — then your brain rebounds and 
tries to make up for the lost sleep stages. But it isn’t able to do so, and your 
sleep isn’t as restful and rejuvenating as it is when no alcohol is in your 
system. When you wake up the next day, you’ll likely feel tired and unrested. 
Larger amounts of alcohol cause a proportionately larger effect, and your 
physical and mental functions can be severely decreased.

241
 Chapter 15: Drowning Alcohol Abuse
 
Some people use alcohol as a way to help them fall asleep, but that’s a very 
unhealthy and unsafe practice. Alcohol hurts your sleep patterns and pre-
vents you from getting healthy, normal sleep, so drinking it before bedtime is 
a surefire way to wake up feeling tired and worn down the next day.
If you continue to go to sleep with alcohol in your system over a long period 
of time, your body eventually develops a tolerance for alcohol that is the 
definition of addiction. You won’t be able to go to sleep without alcohol, and 
every time you drink to fall asleep you’re adding to your body’s toxicity. It’s 
an extremely harmful, unhealthy cycle of addiction.
Using Detoxification Techniques 
against Alcohol
Like many other health issues, alcohol toxicity can be decreased and its 
effects reduced if you use some basic detoxification techniques. Changing 
your drinking behavior to mesh with your overall detoxification goals will 
help you cut out unhealthy alcohol use. And supplementing with a range of 
vitamins, minerals, and herbs can help you undo some of the damage done 
by booze. I cover both topics in this section.
Adjusting your drinking behavior
If you realize and understand that alcohol is a toxin, and you’re convinced 
that detoxification should be a top priority in your life (and I hope you are!), 
you should be prepared to make some changes to your drinking behavior. 
You want to make choices about alcohol that jibe with your other detoxifica-
tion efforts. Here are a few tips that fall in line with that way of thinking:
 
✓ Limit your alcohol intake to 2 to 3 ounces per day.
 
✓ Eat something when you’re drinking.
 
✓ Don’t drink and take any sort of drug at the same time.
 
✓ Eat a diet that contains foods with high vitamin B content.
 
✓ Don’t drink by yourself.
 
✓ Seek help from a doctor or other professional if you consistently drink 
more than 4 ounces per day.

242
Part III: Enhancing Wellness through Detoxification 
Supplementing to help your 
body beat alcohol’s effects
Alcohol use can easily cause deficiencies of several important vitamins and 
minerals in your body. If you want to thwart the damaging effects of alcohol, 
the first step is taking supplements that help to make sure your body isn’t 
being robbed of what it needs to perform. Look for supplements that include 
the following key vitamins and minerals:
 
✓ Magnesium
 
✓ Potassium
 
✓ Vitamin A
 
✓ Vitamin B complex (includes B1, B3, B5, B6, B7, B9, and B12)
 
To help your body recoup the vitamin B that it can lose as a result of alcohol 
use, be sure to eat plenty of vitamin B–rich foods like bananas, lentils, beans, 
turkey, peppers, and potatoes.
You can also seek out supplements that will help your liver to cope with the 
damages associated with alcohol toxicity. Here are the ones I recommend:
 
✓ Alpha-lipoic acid (ALA): This compound is very potent in supporting 
basic liver function and has been successful in treating liver toxicity 
that was considered lethal otherwise. Capsules and tablets are the most 
common supplement forms of ALA.
 
✓ Catechin: A powerful antioxidant compound, catechin can help limit 
the damage done to your liver by alcohol and other toxins. It also fights 
intestinal toxins and improves the health of your body’s cell mem-
branes. One of the most common supplement forms is green tea extract, 
so if you’re interested look for that supplement in tablet form.
 
✓ Milk thistle: Derived from a plant that is common to many areas of the 
world, this herbal supplement offers a potent antioxidant power and 
inhibits an enzyme in the liver that leads to inflammation. You can take 
it as a capsule or in liquid form.
 
✓ N-Acetylcysteine: In addition to combating liver toxicity caused by alco-
hol and other toxins, this compound provides antioxidant effects and 
boosts your immune system, to boot.
 
✓ Resveratrol: Studies have shown this antioxidant to be very beneficial in 
reducing liver damage. You can find it in tablet or capsule form.
 
✓ Vitamin C: This jack-of-all-trades supplement is a requirement for 
anyone looking to heal any part of the body (including the liver). Don’t 
think twice about taking as much as 4,000 mg per day.
 
✓ Vitamin D: This old standby is necessary for any detoxification effort.

243
 Chapter 15: Drowning Alcohol Abuse
I’ve been working with patients on alcohol addiction for decades, and I’ve 
seen the terrific effects of these kinds of supplements on many occasions. 
Some of my patients have had extreme liver toxicity caused by alcohol, and 
supplements like milk thistle and ALA have helped their livers heal to the 
point where they were seeing normal liver function within one week of start-
ing supplementation.
Recipes for Helping You Detox from Alcohol
If you’re worried that alcohol toxicity is harming your body, you should start 
detoxifying for alcohol immediately. Your efforts should include changes in 
your diet that focus on including antioxidant-rich foods and foods that con-
tain plenty of B vitamins.
Here are several tasty recipes that you can make to help steer your diet 
toward helping you reduce the ravages of alcohol toxicity.
 
T Fruity Peppermint Granita
Fresh herbs like peppermint, chamomile, and lavender may help alcoholics recover and 
ease withdrawal symptoms. Just the aroma of peppermint helps soothe an upset stom-
ach. Peppermint is combined with fruit juices and frozen to make a refreshing and 
healthy granita you can eat as a snack or dessert.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Chilling time: 5 hours
Yield: 4 servings
1/2 cup chopped fresh organic peppermint leaves
1/2 cup filtered water
2 cups freshly squeezed orange juice
1/2 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice
2 tablespoons local organic honey
1/4 teaspoon powdered stevia, to taste
 1 Combine all ingredients in a blender; blend until finely minced. Strain mixture through a 
fine sieve, pressing on mint leaves to extract as much flavor as possible.
 2 Pour mixture into 9”x13” pan; the liquid should be about 1/4- to 1/3-inch thick. Freeze 
for 5 hours, scraping the mixture every hour with tines of a fork to make crystals.
 3 When ready to serve, scrape the frozen mixture to fluff up; spoon into glasses, and 
serve immediately.

T Spicy Eggs with 
 
Broccoli Sprout Salad
For recovering alcoholics, L-glutamine is an important nutrient because it has been 
shown to decrease cravings for alcohol and also make the withdrawal process more 
bearable. It’s found in foods like eggs, wheat germ, dairy products, and oats. But for it 
to work most effectively, it should be combined with foods rich in niacin. These include 
celery (especially deep green celery), mushrooms, asparagus, and broccoli.
This dish, commonly known as “Eggs in Purgatory,” is delicious for a breakfast or a late 
supper. The fresh and crisp salad is a nice contrast to the warm and rich eggs.
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Cooking time: 35 minutes
Yield: 6 servings
2 (1/8-inch thick) slices American ginseng root
1/4 cup water
3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
2 tablespoons freshly squeezed orange juice
1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves
2 cups fresh organic broccoli sprouts
2 cups organic cherry tomatoes, cut in half
1 cup sliced organic celery
1 cup sliced organic mushrooms
2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
1 organic yellow onion, peeled and chopped
3 cloves organic garlic, peeled and minced
1 organic jalapeno pepper, minced
4 red organic tomatoes, chopped
1 cup organic or freshly squeezed tomato juice
2 tablespoons freshly squeezed orange juice
1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper
6 eggs
 1 In small saucepan, combine ginseng and water; simmer 5 minutes, then cool. Strain 
liquid into medium bowl; add olive oil, orange juice, and thyme leaves; whisk to com-
bine. Add sprouts, cherry tomatoes, celery, and mushrooms; toss gently and set aside.
 2 Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. In large skillet, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil over medium 
heat. Add onion, garlic, and jalapeno pepper; sauté 5 – 6 minutes until crisp-tender. Add 
tomatoes, tomato juice, orange juice, and pepper; simmer 5 minutes.
 3 Carefully crack eggs onto the simmering sauce, keeping them separated from one 
another. Bake 15–20 minutes until eggs are just set. Serve egg mixture with sprout salad.

 Chapter 15: Drowning Alcohol Abuse
 
Beef and Cabbage Lentil Salad
Uncooked cabbage is another good source of L-glutamine. Cabbage is also rich in gluco-
sinolates, which help improve immune function so your body can recover and regain 
health. Raw vegetables, of course, are central to any detox diet. This combination is 
fresh and delicious, with lots of crunch and beautiful color.
Lentils are loaded with plenty of folic acid and fiber that are essential for an alcohol 
detox. Zinc, which helps protect the liver against alcohol, and iron, a nutrient alcoholics 
may be deficient in, are found in beef. It’s important to look for 100 percent organic, 
grass-fed beef when you’re on a detox diet.
This delicious salad will satisfy anyone’s appetite. It can be eaten hot or cold; in fact, 
leftovers are delicious served the next day.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: 45 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
1 pound organic, grass-fed beef ribeye steaks
2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice
1 1/2 cups organic French Puy lentils
3 cups filtered water
2 cups chopped organic red cabbage
1 organic green bell pepper, chopped
1 organic yellow bell pepper, chopped
2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice
1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar
1 tablespoon local honey
1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil
2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
1 tablespoon minced fresh oregano
1/4 teaspoon pepper
2 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
 1 Place steaks in shallow pan; sprinkle with 2 tablespoons lemon juice and rub into both 
sides. Refrigerate while preparing lentils and the salad.
 2 Sort lentils and rinse. Drain and combine them with water in medium saucepan. Bring to 
a boil, lower heat, cover, and simmer until lentils are tender, 23–28 minutes. Drain if 
necessary and set aside.
 3 In serving bowl, combine cabbage, bell peppers, and lentils. In small bowl, combine 2 
tablespoons lemon juice, vinegar, honey, olive oil, mustard, oregano, pepper, and pars-
ley. Mix well and pour over cabbage mixture; toss gently to coat. Set aside.
 4 Remove the meat from the fridge and let it come to room temperature. Place beef on broiler 
pan; broil, turning once, 8–12 minutes until desired doneness. Remove from heat, cover, 
and let stand 5 minutes. Slice beef thinly and arrange over salad; serve immediately.

T Green Tea Chamomile Smoothie
Green tea and chamomile will help you calm down and regain your composure. Tea is 
also a wonderful healing food that brings balance to your body. It relieves muscle spasms, 
boosts the immune system, and fights infection. Along with vitamin C–rich foods like man-
goes and oranges, this smoothie is the perfect pick-me-up any time of the day.
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Cooking time: 5 minutes

techniques
▶ Making some dishes that feature stress-busting ingredients
M
ost of the chapters in this book focus on various aspects of your 
physical health, but I couldn’t write a book about improving your 
total health with detoxification without a mention of mental health. When 
you get right down to it, mental health is just as important as physical health. 
You could be as physically fit and healthy as possible, but if your mind isn’t 
sound, you likely won’t lead a meaningful, fulfilling, enjoyable life.
Mental health and physical health are also incredibly interrelated. You can’t 
separate the mind from the body, after all. Decreased mental wellness has 
a profound effect on physical wellness, and lack of physical health creates 
mental unrest. Scores of studies show a very high correlation between mental 
health problems and cardiovascular disease, arthritis, Parkinson’s disease, 
substance abuse, and many other chronic diseases.
The hectic world that we live in today puts a huge amount of stress on our 
minds, and the influx of toxins — which harm your brain’s delicate chemical 
balance — certainly don’t make things any easier. If you’re not careful, the 
combination of a stressful life and elevated toxicity can wear on your mind 
and end up causing a mental health problem. Depression (or non-traumatic 
stress syndrome, as I call it) is one of the most common conditions caused by 
increased stress on a number of levels, and it’s one that (thankfully) you can 
avoid or defeat by embracing several methods of detoxification.

Digging into Depression
Depression is one of the most common challenges to a healthy state of mind. 
The problem isn’t a small one. Estimates indicate that 80 percent of people 
who go to a physician are depressed and 80 percent of people with depression 
aren’t treated. (Keep in mind that chronic illness is a major stressor that can 
cause depression, and chronic illness is a top reason for physician visits.)
At any given time, almost 19 million people in the United States are living 
with depression, and the absenteeism cost of that problem alone is about $51 
billion per year.
Depression is a very emotionally charged word. Historically, the word con-
jures images of weakness and an inability to get a grip on life. Many people 
think that those living with depression should be able to just straighten up 
and get over it. In fact, studies have shown that 54 percent of people still 
think that depression is a personal weakness. That’s an extremely discourag-
ing statistic, especially because we now know that people who are depressed 
experience biochemical changes in the brain that can’t be changed with all 
the willpower in the world. We must get familiar with the real causes and 
symptoms of depression because we can’t do much about it if we don’t fully 
understand the problem. That’s what this section is all about.
Understanding the causes of depression
In my experience, the central cause of all depression is stress. I’ve never 
encountered anyone in or outside my practice with depression who didn’t 
have abnormally high stress. Stress is the common thread of depression, 
to the point where I think we should drop the term depression and call this 
complex of symptoms non-traumatic stress syndrome (NTSS). This term better 
represents what is actually happening, and it’s generally more acceptable to 
patients as an explanation of their problems. I use the two terms interchange-
ably, and I think we’d all be better off if more people did the same.
When I use the word “stress,” I’m talking about social and mental stress — 
demanding jobs, big changes to your personal live, and so on — but I’m also 
talking about physical stress. Not surprisingly, elevated levels of toxins in 
your body can put a huge amount of physical stress on you, which can help 
push you toward depression.
 
Here’s another important aspect of depression: It isn’t caused by depress-
ing situations. That statement may sound odd to some people, but it’s true. 
Consider this: If depression was caused by depressing situations, every 
person living on the street would be massively depressed. But that’s not the 
case; some street people are actually happy. And some people who have great 
jobs and steady paychecks and nice houses are among the most depressed.

249
 Chapter 16: Enhancing Mental Health with Detoxification
All the stressors you face on a daily basis have a negative effect on how your 
body and mind function. The combined impact can be huge, even without the 
presence of a major stressful factor. A little bit of stress and toxicity here and 
there all add up to cause dysfunction and disease. Let me fill you in on some 
of the details of both mental and physical stress, so you can identify them 
easily and deal with them if you need to.
Changing brain chemistry
The chemistry of the brain is fabulously complex, and the balance of chemi-
cals that play a role in brain function is a delicate one. You’ve probably heard 
of the importance of certain chemicals in the brain called neurotransmitters, 
and for good reason: Most studies indicate that a depletion of neurotrans-
mitters is one of the top contributing factors in people suffering from NTSS. 
They’re not the only important chemicals in your brain, but they’re near the 
top of the list.
What causes a depletion of neurotransmitters? A couple things. The first is 
stress. Stress causes an increased firing of nerves in the brain, which can’t 
take place without neurotransmitters. Too much stress means too much 
nerve firing, which uses up your brain’s supply of neurotransmitters. That’s a 
pretty simplistic description of a very complicated set of processes, but you 
get the idea.
The other side of the neurotransmitter problem is a dietary deficiency of 
essential nutrients that your body uses to make neurotransmitters. If you 
don’t get enough of the right kinds of nutrients, your body isn’t able to gener-
ate neurotransmitters, and your brain is left wanting.
 
Environmental toxins — from heavy metals to chemical toxins — can have a 
major negative effect on your neurotransmitters. Increased exposure to toxins 
can cause a range of mental health conditions, including (but definitely not 
limited to) NTSS. Heavy metals are among the worst, with lead and mercury 
leading the way.
Stress on stress on stress
Mental stress is the kind of stress that you suffer from as a result of events 
that cause change in your life. Stressors vary from person to person, and 
they can include almost anything. Here’s a list of some of the most common 
stressors:
 
✓ Death of a spouse
 
✓ Marital separation or divorce
 
✓ Marriage
 
✓ Sexual dysfunction
 
✓ Loss of a job

250
Part III: Enhancing Wellness through Detoxification 
 
✓ Change in working conditions, including increased responsibility
 
✓ Monotony
 
✓ Change in financial status
 
✓ Personal injury or illness (especially chronic illness)
 
✓ Pain
 
✓ Change in the health of a family member
 
✓ Hormonal changes such as puberty, premenstrual syndrome, meno-
pause, or pregnancy
 
✓ New babies or departing children (empty nest syndrome)
 
✓ Vacation
 
✓ Retirement
 
✓ Fear of aging
 
✓ Moving or buying a new house
 
✓ Excessive time demands of daily schedule
 
✓ Difficulty with sleep
 
✓ Alcohol or drug abuse
 
✓ Imagined changes in life or fear of possible negative changes in life
 
✓ Very hot or cold climates
 
✓ Chronic allergies
This isn’t a complete list, but it does include some of the more common 
causes of stress. And stress certainly isn’t the same for everyone. One person 
may thrive on having a packed daily schedule, while that same schedule 
could completely overwhelm another person.
Did anything about that list surprise you? How about the fact that some of 
those things are traditionally thought of as happy life events? Did you expect, 
for example, to see “vacation” on the list?
 
Stressful events or changes don’t have to be sad or depressing. Many things 
that are usually thought of as positive — like marriage or new babies, for 
example — can create a huge amount of stress. Sometimes happy events are 
even more stressful for certain people than sad events.

251
 Chapter 16: Enhancing Mental Health with Detoxification
Seeing the symptoms
The symptoms of depression are wide ranging, and they can sometimes be 
difficult to identify. The problem is further complicated by the fact that all 
psychiatric diagnoses are manmade. The same isn’t true in other areas of 
medicine. Take orthopedics: A broken leg is a broken leg. That sort of diag-
nosis isn’t subject to personal opinion, and it isn’t likely to change over time. 
But psychiatric diagnoses just aren’t as clear cut because the symptoms 
and conditions can be a moving target. For a mental health condition to be 
identified, a group of psychiatrists sit down and decide on the symptoms 
that make up that illness. The symptoms and their order of importance may 
change over time and can be subject to social pressures. These types of diag-
noses aren’t an exact science by any means.
Depression diagnoses are a classic example. Psychiatrists have developed a 
group of symptoms that they lump together and call depression. How does it 
work? It’s actually pretty simple. You must have five or more of the following 
symptoms during the same two-week period, and those symptoms must be 
accompanied by a depressed mood or a loss of interest in pleasure:
 
✓ A depressed mood for most of the day, nearly every day.
 
✓ Markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all or almost all activities 
most of the day, nearly every day.
 
✓ Significant (more than 5 percent) weight gain or loss without dieting, or 
change in appetite nearly every day.
The stress of positive life changes
It’s difficult to think of positive life changes as 
being a cause for depression, but the situation 
is very real. Not long ago, a 23-year-old woman 
came to my practice as depressed as anyone 
I have ever seen. She had just gotten married, 
and the event was grand at all stages. There 
were lots of wedding showers; a big, flashy 
ceremony; and an incredible honeymoon on 
a Caribbean island. After her marriage, she 
moved to a new town where her husband lived. 
They got a new house and started very lucra-
tive, challenging jobs. I could barely hear all the 
details of her story because she just couldn’t 
stop sobbing. She was afraid that she was 
going crazy because she couldn’t function and 
she wanted only to stay in her bedroom and cry.
All the recent events in her life were positive 
and happy, but they all involved big changes 
in her daily life, which created stress. Stories 
like hers are very common, but they’re often 
ignored and the resulting conditions untreated 
because many people can’ t understand how 
it’s possible to be depressed with so many good 
things happening in life.

252
Part III: Enhancing Wellness through Detoxification 
 
✓ Insomnia or hypersomnia (constant sleepiness) nearly every day.
 
✓ A feeling of restlessness nearly every day.
 
✓ Fatigue or loss or energy nearly every day.
 
✓ Feelings or worthlessness or guilt nearly every day.
 
✓ Diminished ability to think or concentrate.
 
✓ Recurrent thoughts of death.
To me, the logic of that kind of diagnosis is a little flawed. For example, what 
happens if you have only four of the symptoms (not the required five), but 
your symptoms are severe? I’m also not convinced that these symptoms 
cover all the bases of depression or NTSS. I have a few other things I look for 
when I’m figuring out if a person may be suffering from the condition. Here 
are the other questions I ask:
 
✓ Do you feel depressed, sad, and melancholy?
 
✓ Have you lost interest in hobbies?
 
✓ Are there things that used to be fun that are not fun now, like keeping 
the house clean or doing routine maintenance on the car?
 
✓ When you get home do you see several things that need to be done but 
you can’t decide what to do? Do you just sit down or have to force your-
self to get up and do those things?
 
✓ Is your overall motivation to do things decreased?
 
✓ Does it take you a long time to go to sleep?
 
✓ While you are waiting to fall asleep does your mind go on fast forward 
hopping from topic to topic?
 
✓ Do you wake up frequently during the night?
 
✓ Do you wake up early?
 
✓ Could you sleep much longer if you had a chance?
 
✓ Do you have trouble with focus? If you are doing something boring does 
your mind wander?
 
✓ Are you having trouble with your memory?
 
✓ Is your sex drive decreased?
 
✓ Have you developed new pains?
 
✓ Do little things seem to hurt worse than they used to?
 
✓ Do you have trouble making decisions about small things?
 
✓ When was the last time you felt so full of joy you thought you would 
jump out of your skin?

253
 Chapter 16: Enhancing Mental Health with Detoxification
 
✓ Are you easily frustrated?
 
✓ Do you get angry over things that didn’t bother you before?
 
✓ Do you lose your temper or hold it in more than you used to?
 
✓ Do you feel overwhelmed?
 
✓ Do you ever feel that if you could just run away everything would be 
better?
 
✓ Do you ever think of suicide?
As you can see, NTSS can include many different changes in behavior. In my 
view, when a patient answers yes to several of these questions, it can be a 
definite cause for concern. When your neurotransmitter levels are depleted, 
you soon start to exhibit some of the behaviors in these two symptom lists, 
which can further elevate your stress levels, creating an escalation in your 
NTSS that can turn dangerous very quickly.
 
If you or someone close to you begins experiencing some of the symptoms I 
list in this section, get professional help right away.
Analyzing Autism Spectrum Disorders
While depression or NTSS has become extremely common, another set of 
complex biochemical changes in the brain has reached epidemic status: 
autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Autism now affects 1 in every 91 children 
born in the United States, and that statistic doesn’t include children with 
ADD or ADHD. In my opinion, ASD is a continuum that runs from ADD on one 
end to profound autism at the other.
Fingering the cause
The cause of autism spectrum disorders? Toxins, and a variety of biochemi-
cal alterations that affect the brain as a result of increased toxicity.
It has taken many years for even the basic causes of autism to be identified. 
Over the decades, the disorders have been attributed to everything from 
inattentive mothers to psychiatric disorders. But the root of the problem is 
a biochemical disorder that involves the kind of toxicity I discuss in many 
areas of this book. As with any controversial disease or condition, plenty of 
naysayers refute this line of thinking, but the evidence is growing and enforc-
ing it more and more every day.

254
Part III: Enhancing Wellness through Detoxification 
Figuring out the best treatments
Effective treatment for ASD requires a range of efforts, the scope of which is 
too broad to cover in this chapter. The best treatments involve clearing up 
the gut to get rid of yeast, parasites, abnormal bacteria, and viruses; detoxify-
ing heavy metals; making dietary changes that focus on wholesome, organic, 
healthful food; supplementing with the essential vitamins, minerals, amino 
acids, antioxidants, and essential fatty acids; and eliminating wheat and milk 
products.
We don’t have all the answers, but data collected by the Autism Research 
Institute has shown these changes to be effective in improving the behaviors 
and life of children on the spectrum. Seventy-four percent of parents of ASD 
children report that their children are improved after having heavy metals 
removed; 72 percent are improved after receiving methyl-B12 injections; and 
65 percent show improvement after being on a gluten-free, casein-free diet.
 
If you or someone you know suffers from an autism spectrum disorder, be 
sure to talk to your doctor about the importance of detoxifying and avoid-
ing toxic influences. For more information, visit the Web sites of the Autism 
Research Institute and Defeat Autism Now! (www.autism.com) or Generation 
Rescue (www.generationrescue.org).
Busting Stress and Anxiety 
through Detoxification
The stress put on our bodies and minds as a result of changes in our lives 
and the presence of toxins can lead to behavioral changes, including depres-
sion or non-traumatic stress syndrome (NTSS). That’s the bad news, and you 
can read all about it in this chapter’s earlier sections. The good news is that 
you can harness the power of a few detoxification techniques to curtail stress 
and head off these types of mental conditions at the pass.
The toxins that you bring into your body through environmental exposure 
and food decrease its ability to conduct the normal chemical reactions that 
need to take place millions of times each day throughout your many systems 
to keep you healthy. Your brain — with its delicate balance of neurotransmit-
ters and other vital biochemistry — is no exception, so it’s easy to see how 
increased toxicity can throw off your brain’s regular functioning.
If you want to stop this trend before it begins to have devastating effects on 
your brain health and mental state, or if you want to slow or reverse a condi-
tion that you’re already suffering from, start by employing some of the basic 

255
 Chapter 16: Enhancing Mental Health with Detoxification
detoxification measures that I describe in detail in Part II of this book. For 
example:
 
✓ Undertake basic bowel detoxification against yeast, abnormal bacteria, 
and parasites.
 
✓ Conduct a heavy metal evaluation and detoxification if necessary.
 
✓ Make smart dietary choices (which I discuss in the next section).
 
✓ Supplement to ensure the proper intake of key nutrients.
 
✓ Make sure you sweat heavily on a daily basis through exercise.
That’s a quick rundown, but I also want to make sure you get a full sense of 
how you can focus on a few detoxification standards to improve your mental 
health. So please keep reading!
Beefing up your brain
Elevated levels of stress and toxins can give your brain and its delicate 
chemical balance a real beating. But you don’t have to simply roll with the 
punches; you can do a number of things to help knock out those damaging 
effects.
Antidepressant drugs do have a place in the treatment of depression, par-
ticularly when the symptoms are life-threatening or when a patient refuses 
to use more natural measures. However, it’s unfortunate when the latter hap-
pens, because natural measures are effective in most cases. I am often able to 
effectively treat NTSS in my patients when I put them on a regimen of supple-
ments that provide them with the building block chemicals their bodies use 
to make neurotransmitters. In many cases this kind of treatment works even 
when antidepressant prescription drugs have failed.
Here are some of the supplements that have really worked for my patients. 
(It’s also worth noting that solid scientific studies support the idea that these 
substances are helpful in treating depression.)
 
✓ Folic acid: This vitamin is required for the development of nerve tissue 
in the developing brains of babies in the womb, and it’s also necessary 
for the production of a naturally occurring and very important com-
pound in your brain called S-Adenosyl methionine. (You may want to 
call that one by its nickname, Sam-E, and you can read more about it in 
this list.)
 
✓ Inositol: This compound, found in most of your body’s cells, is involved 
in cell signaling, which is transmitting information between cells. (That’s 
right, your cells talk to each other!) Studies have shown that inositol is 
as effective as antidepressants in treating depression.

256
Part III: Enhancing Wellness through Detoxification 
 
✓ Omega-3 fatty acids: I talk about these crucial substances quite a lot 
throughout this book. Omega-3s have been shown to produce antide-
pressant effects in multiple studies, and you can get them in fish oil or 
through supplementing.
 
✓ Phosphatidylcholine: In addition to being a real mouthful to pronounce, 
this one is part of the chemical mix that results in acetylcholine, which 
is a major neurotransmitter in the brain.
 
✓ S-Adenosyl methionine: Also called Sam-E, this chemical is a precursor 
of serotonin and dopamine, which are two of the most important neu-
rotransmitters.
I’ve found these substances to be really useful in treating NTSS in my 
patients. Another added benefit is that they have no side effects, and they’re 
not known to cause any toxicity.
 
The substances I list in this section are terrific at helping to boost the brain 
and fight off NTSS, but don’t try to use them on your own to treat that condi-
tion. Be sure to consult a physician who’s familiar with these kinds of treat-
ments before starting any kind of regimen.
Managing stress with what’s on your plate
You can’t do much good cutting out the stress that threatens your mental 
state if you aren’t committed to good health, and you’re going to have a very 
hard time achieving good health if your diet isn’t good. If you haven’t already 
done so, take a few minutes to look through Chapters 6 and 7 so you can 
understand what you need to include in your diet to give yourself the best 
possible foundation for health. It all starts with your diet.
In addition to the general food choices and eating behaviors I describe in 
Chapters 6 and 7, you really want to focus on a few diet specifics in order to 
reduce the stress you’re putting on your body and mind. In particular,
 
✓ Don’t eat anything white. That includes sugar, sugar substitutes, and 
flour, for starters. Cauliflower is an exception.
 
✓ Avoid processed foods. Processed foods are lousy with toxins, and they 
don’t provide you with any of the nutrients your body really needs. Be 
sure to read food labels and don’t eat anything with ingredients you 
can’t pronounce.
 
✓ Cut out the trans fats. This step is critical in any healthy, detoxified diet.
 
✓ Load up on B vitamins. Get B vitamins with lean beef (100 percent 
organic, of course), lentils, bananas, avocado, clams, oysters — even 
octopus!

Using natural supplements 
to stave off stress
Natural supplements — particularly those that are herb-based — have been 
used for thousands of years to help boost mental health and relieve stress. 
Most of these are available at your local vitamin or health food store, and 
several have been verified by a variety of scientific data over the years. 
Here’s the cream of the crop:
 
✓ Chamomile: I recommend chamomile tea as a delicious way to reduce 
anxiety and aid sleep.
 
✓ Kava kava: Used for centuries as a calming supplement, the root of the 
kava kava plant — available at health food stores in capsules and liq-
uids — can also be very effective in reducing anxiety and decreasing the 
effects of depression.
 
✓ Lemon balm: Part of the mint family, this herb has shown some effec-
tiveness in treating anxiety when taken as a tea or in capsule form.
 
✓ Passionflower: Made from a common plant found in the southeast 
region of the United States, this supplement can be found in capsule or 
liquid form.
 
✓ Rhodiola: Europeans have embraced this herbal supplement for many 
years, and it’s starting to see an increase in popularity in the United 
States. Use it to help relieve depression symptoms and to bust stress 
and anxiety.
 
✓ Skullcap: This herbal supplement has a funny name, but its capacity for 
decreasing stress is serious business.
 
✓ St. John’s wort: You may have read reports that St. John’s wort’s poten-
tial for treating depression isn’t quite as impressive as everyone once 
thought, but I’m still a firm believer that it can be a very powerful means 
for helping those with mild to moderate depression. Most negative stud-
ies on St John’s wort focused on patients with major depression.
 
✓ Valerian root: Many people know this supplement as a useful remedy 
for insomnia, but it’s also good for relieving stress. It comes in liquid or 
tablet form.
Considering a few other ways 
to deal with stress
Today, you can find a stressor just about everywhere you look. Most of us 
live in a hectic, frenzied environment where big changes happen all the time, 
and it can be difficult to keep up and prevent stress from really wearing us

down. You need to tackle the wide variety of stressors with an equally varied 
arsenal of stress-busting methods. Many of these methods are completely 
toxin free, so I support them enthusiastically. I’ll start with some quick ones 
and then get into a little more detail on exercise and sauna:
 
✓ Personal time: This sounds so simple, but when was the last time you 
turned off your phone, pushed back from the computer, and asked the 
kids to play quietly by themselves for an hour or so? You need to find 
time in your daily life to relax and clear your mind. Try a bubble bath or 
some deep breathing, or maybe just find a comfortable corner of your 
home and dive into a good book for an hour or so. (Just make sure the 
book isn’t a spy thriller or a horror novel — remember that we’re trying 
to eliminate stress here, not create it!)
 
✓ Sex: Sex is one of our most basic methods for stress and anxiety relief. 
Do whatever you need to do to maintain a healthy sex life.
 
✓ Yoga: You can read study after study that supports the use of yoga for 
stress relief. It’s also great for your physical health, so roll out the mat 
and get started!
 
✓ Meditation: This practice has also been used for stress relief and 
enhanced mental clarity for thousands of years. It doesn’t require any 
fancy equipment or expensive memberships — just a little time and 
some quiet.
 
✓ Journaling: So many people don’t take the time to reflect on their 
days. You need to savor your accomplishments and work thoughtfully 
through your problems, and writing in a journal is a great way to do so. 
Few other methods are as effective for getting feelings and concerns off 
your chest.
Exercise
I’ll tout the benefits of exercise as long as I have breath in my lungs, but 
special consideration needs to be given here to the mental health benefits 
of regular exercise. Getting 30 minutes of exercise each and every day is a 
terrific way to enhance your health in a way that isn’t possible through any 
other means, and it’s also a proven way that you can boost your mind. Here 
are just a few of the ways that exercise can help your mental state:
 
✓ Endorphin release: These “feel good” neurotransmitters are released 
when you exercise, and they’re great at elevating your mood.
 
✓ Decreased anxiety: This wonderful effect is due to a combination of 
physical and mental factors.
 
✓ Increased stamina: More stamina means more energy, which allows you 
to accomplish more without fatigue.

259
 Chapter 16: Enhancing Mental Health with Detoxification
 
✓ Sense of accomplishment: Whether you’re walking briskly for a few 
blocks or running a marathon, you’re doing something good for your 
body and mind. That feeling of accomplishment can really boost your 
sense of self worth.
 
✓ Improved pain threshold: Constant pain can have a devastating effect 
on your mental health, and exercise helps your body deal with pain 
much more effectively.
 
✓ Decreased impotence: Especially in men, exercise can help thwart impo-
tence, which helps you unlock more of the stress-busting benefits of a 
healthy sex life.
 
✓ Increased fun: Going out for a jog with your spouse or playing a few 
good-spirited sets of tennis with a buddy can be a lot of fun, and it’s 
tough to argue that having fun puts you in a better, healthier state of 
mind.
 
Exercise every day! Just 30 minutes of daily physical activity will have a fantas-
tic effect on your health — both physical and mental. Check out Chapter 13 to 
figure out which kinds of exercise will work best for you.
Sauna
Many of the toxic chemicals that put stress on your body and harm your 
brain function are packed away in fat cells. You can flush out these toxins 
by spending time in a sauna, because the intense sweating works to shuttle 
the toxic chemicals out through your skin. Doing so will help to decrease 
your toxic load, and it’s also extremely relaxing. What’s better for eliminating 
anxiety and stress than sitting in a nice hot sauna with a fluffy towel and a big 
bottle of water? Sauna is truly a great way to reduce the physical and mental 
causes of stress. I explain all your options for sauna in Chapter 18.
Recipes for Improving 
Your Mental Health
Diet is an important aspect of mental health. The chemical processes that 
take place in your brain are complex and wondrous, and they require a lot of 
key nutrients. The recipes here are chock-full of healthy ingredients that will 
help to give your brain the good stuff it needs. They’re also fun to make, and 
whipping up something tasty in the kitchen can be a pleasant, stress-busting 
experience!

T Mixed Nut Snack
Snacks are an integral part of any healthy diet. When you snack, make it as delicious 
and healthy as possible. Nuts, which are high in good dietary fats and protein, are help-
ful to your brain’s dopamine and serotonin levels. Dopamine is made from the amino 
acid tyrosine, and serotonin is made from the amino acid tryptophan. Almonds, pecans, 
walnuts, sunflower seeds, and pumpkin seeds all have lots of tryptophan. And cashews 
and pistachios are high in tyrosine.
You can use any of your favorite nuts in this recipe. Just be sure to buy 100 percent 
organic, unsalted varieties. Enjoy this delicious snack in moderation, with the knowl-
edge that you’re healing your brain and body as you eat.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: 25 minutes
Yield: 12 servings (1/2 cup each)
1 1/2 cups organic unsalted slivered almonds
1 1/2 cups organic broken pecans
1 cup organic unsalted cashew halves
1 cup shelled organic unsalted pistachios
2 tablespoons organic almond oil
1 tablespoon curry powder
1 teaspoon ground turmeric
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/2 cup unsalted shelled sunflower seeds
1/2 cup unsalted pumpkin seeds
 1 Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Combine all the nuts on a rimmed baking sheet.
 2 In small bowl, stir together oil, curry powder, turmeric, cinnamon, and cayenne pepper. 
Drizzle over nut mixture and toss to coat. Bake 15 minutes, then add sunflower and 
pumpkin seeds; stir gently.
 3 Bake 10 minutes longer, stirring twice during baking time, until nuts are fragrant and 
crisp. Cool completely and store in airtight containers at room temperature.

f you want to kick-start a detoxification effort or con-
tinue one that’s already in motion, you need to do two 
things. This part includes details on both.
First, you have to make sure you’re getting the important 
substances your body needs to stay healthy. That’s what 
Chapter 17 is all about. Second, you have to be willing to 
try a range of things that can detoxify your body. Chapter 
18 shows you how, from chelation to acupuncture and all 
points in between.

Body Chemistry
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding the importance of vitamins
▶ Making a case for minerals
▶ Getting a feel for essential fatty acids
▶ Taking a quick look at essential amino acids
▶ Advocating antioxidants
C
hemical reactions are the basis for all your body’s myriad functions 
and processes. Everything the human body does — from passing gas 
to thinking up a complex theory of quantum physics — is based on chemi-
cal reactions. Science doesn’t even know how many chemical reactions are 
occurring constantly in your body. To give you an idea of how big a picture 
I’m talking about here, consider that vitamin C is involved in at least 1,700 
reactions that take place in the body. That’s just one vitamin! The knowledge 
that we have of basic body chemistry is in its infancy, at best.
Here’s what we do know: Your body absolutely has to have a number of sub-
stances in order to conduct all the necessary chemical reactions to keep you 
healthy and functioning normally. These substances — vitamins, minerals, 
essential fatty acids, and essential amino acids — are the focus of this chap-
ter, along with another class of substances called antioxidants that can do 
wonders to improve your overall health.
With toxic influences assaulting your body all the time, it’s critically impor-
tant that you get enough of these vital substances so your body can function 
properly and carry out its natural detoxification processes successfully.
 
Whenever you experience increased stress on your body, such as with illness, 
chronic disease, or pregnancy, you must pay special attention to make sure 
you get all the essential nutrients.

266
Part IV: Maintaining Healthy Detoxification Habits 
Valuing Vitamins
In total, your body has to have 13 vitamins. Four of those vitamins (A, D, E, 
and K) are fat-soluble, which means they can be stored in your body. It’s pos-
sible (although unlikely) to get too much of the fat-soluble vitamins, to the 
point where they become toxic. The other vitamins (B vitamins and C) are 
water-soluble, meaning that any excess amounts are removed easily through 
the urine.
 
Although the fat-soluble vitamins can be toxic if you consume vast amounts of 
them, it’s virtually impossible to reach that level of toxicity through diet and 
difficult even with supplements.
 
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) sets recommended daily allow-
ances (RDAs) for vitamins, but RDAs are only the amounts you must get each 
day to avoid diseases associated with vitamin deficiencies. You should get 
much higher levels of the essential vitamins if you want to enjoy maximum 
health.
Vitamin A
Your body gets vitamin A from substances called carotenoids, which are com-
monly found in foods like carrots, squash, spinach, kale, and sweet potatoes. 
You can also get vitamin A from dairy foods, eggs, liver, and fish liver oil. 
Researchers estimate that as many as one-third of all Americans don’t get 
enough vitamin A, and deficiencies can cause some rough stuff. Not getting 
enough vitamin A can lead to night blindness, skin dryness, decreased mucus 
membrane secretions, and increased susceptibility to bacterial infections. 
The FDA recommends that you get 900 micrograms of vitamin A per day, but 
I suggest getting 7,500 micrograms.
The B vitamins
The B vitamins are a whole group of vitamins that have similar chemical 
structures but play different roles in your body’s many chemical reactions. 
You may hear these vitamins referred to as B-complex vitamins. Call them 
whatever you want — just make sure you’re giving your body plenty of them 
for optimum health!
Vitamin B1
Sometimes called thiamine, vitamin B1 is required for carbohydrate metabo-
lism and for the production of substances in your body that regulate your 
nerves. Foods that are richest in B1 include organ meats (liver, heart, and 
kidney), lean meats, eggs, leafy green vegetables, berries, nuts, and legumes. 

267
 Chapter 17: Supporting Healthy Body Chemistry
If you don’t get enough vitamin B1, you can suffer from beriberi, which is 
characterized by muscular weakness, swelling of the heart, and leg cramps. 
Severe cases can result in heart failure and death. The RDA for vitamin B1 is 
1.2 milligrams per day, but I recommend getting about 20 milligrams daily.
Vitamin B2
Ever heard of riboflavin? That’s another name for vitamin B2. Like vitamin 
B1, B2 is necessary for the metabolism of carbohydrates, but it also helps 
your body to metabolize fats and proteins used in the respiratory tract. You 
can get vitamin B2 in your diet by eating liver, dairy products, meat, dark 
green vegetables, and mushrooms. If your body runs low on B2, you can end 
up with skin lesions and sensitivity to light, among other problems. The FDA 
says you should get 1.3 milligrams per day, but I think you should get 20 mil-
ligrams.
Vitamin B3
Vitamin B3 goes by a few other names that you may have heard of: niacin, 
nicotinic acid, and niacinamide. Your body needs it to produce energy, and 
it’s also handy for decreasing cholesterol. Your body can make B3 from the 
amino acid tryptophan, but you can also get it in the food you eat. If you want 
to up the amount of vitamin B3 you’re getting, try to eat more dried beans, 
peas, nuts, liver, poultry, and meats. Vitamin B3 deficiencies cause pellagra, 
which is a condition marked by a variety of skin-related symptoms as well as 
mental confusion, depression, swollen tongue, and diarrhea. I think adults 
should get 65 milligrams per day, but the FDA’s RDA for vitamin B3 is a paltry 
16 milligrams each day.
Vitamin B5
Also known as pantothenic acid, vitamin B5 helps you convert food to energy, 
and it’s important for the creation of adrenal gland steroids, antibodies, bile, 
red blood cells, and neurotransmitters. You can find B5 in a really wide vari-
ety of foods, from fish to sweet potatoes. A lack of vitamin B5 can result in 
numbness, as well as reduced amounts of the important substances that vita-
min B5 helps your body to make. The RDA is 5 milligrams per day; I think you 
should get more like 200 milligrams each and every day.
Vitamin B6
Vitamin B6 wears many hats when it comes to your health. You need it to 
absorb and use amino acids, and it’s also critical for the formation of red 
blood cells. How can you tell if you’re not getting enough vitamin B6? Some 
of the symptoms include cracks at the corners of the mouth (ouch!), smooth 
tongue, convulsions, dizziness, nausea, anemia, and kidney stones. Some 
delicious food sources of vitamin B6 include avocados, spinach, green beans, 
bananas, and whole grains. The daily dose recommended by the FDA is 1.5 
milligrams per day, but I advise you to set your sights on about 20 milligrams.

268
Part IV: Maintaining Healthy Detoxification Habits 
Vitamin B7
A couple aliases for vitamin B7 are biotin and vitamin H. Generally speaking, 
vitamin B7 helps convert food to energy, and it’s required for making pro-
teins and fatty acids. On a more tangible level, you need it for healthy hair, 
skin, fingernails, and toenails. If you’re looking for a good dietary source, turn 
to broccoli, sweet potatoes, cheese, kidney beans, sunflower seeds, nuts, and 
salmon.
 
Long-term use of antibiotics can cause vitamin B7 deficiency. If you’ve 
recently taken a round of antibiotics, focus on getting plenty of B7 through 
your diet and supplements.
The RDA for vitamin B7 is 30 micrograms; I suggest getting about 1,000 micro-
grams instead.
Vitamin B9
This vitamin is very important. Vitamin B9 (also known as folic acid) is 
unusual because it is stored in the liver. You absolutely have to have it for 
the formation of many proteins, including hemoglobin, which is the substance 
that shuttles oxygen around your body in your blood. You can get vitamin B9 
in organ meats (liver, kidney, heart), leafy green vegetables, legumes, nuts, 
and whole grains. In adults, deficiencies can cause anemia.
 
Vitamin B9 (folic acid) is essential for developing fetuses, particularly for the 
development of brain tissue. If you’re pregnant or you know someone who’s 
pregnant, make sure there’s plenty of vitamin B9 to go around!
If you ask the FDA, you should get 400 micrograms of vitamin B9 per day. But 
if you ask me, upwards of 800 micrograms is a better daily dose.
Vitamin B12
Vitamin B12 is a must-have for the formation of red blood cells and proteins, 
and also for the functioning of the nervous system. You definitely don’t want 
to run short on this vitamin, so be sure to get it in your diet (liver, fish, meat, 
eggs, and milk are a few good sources) or through the use of supplements. 
Not getting enough vitamin B12 can result in anemia, nerve problems, and 
intestinal conditions. The FDA and I differ greatly in the amount of vitamin 
B12 you should get on a daily basis. They say 2.4 micrograms; I say 500 
micrograms.
Vitamin C
It’s difficult to overstate the importance of vitamin C (also called ascorbic 
acid) for your health. As I mention earlier in this chapter, at least 1,700 
chemical reactions in your body require vitamin C, and it’s probably involved 

269
 Chapter 17: Supporting Healthy Body Chemistry
in many more reactions that haven’t yet been identified. Vitamin C is also an 
essential ingredient in the formation of collagen, which is the material that 
holds all your body’s tissues together. Vitamin C is critical for healing; your 
body simply can’t heal itself without plenty of vitamin C.
A vitamin C deficiency can cause a condition called scurvy, which leads to 
hemorrhages, loosening of teeth, and problems with long bone development 
in children. Interestingly, all mammals make vitamin C except humans and 
gorillas. Dogs, for instance, make about 35,000 milligrams per day. Because 
humans aren’t able to make vitamin C, you have to make sure you get plenty 
in your diet and through supplements. The FDA recommends 90 milligrams 
per day, but that’s laughable. I get as much vitamin C in my diet as I can, and 
I also take 2,000 milligrams per day in supplements. If I’m not feeling well, I up 
that number to 6,000 milligrams per day.
 
If you’re in need of a good natural laxative, try taking 8,000–10,000 milligrams 
of vitamin C in a day.
You don’t have to walk very far down the produce aisle to find good sources 
of vitamin C. Some of the best are citrus fruits, strawberries, cantaloupe, 
pineapple, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, tomatoes, spinach, kale, green pep-
pers, cabbage, and turnips.
Vitamin D
Vitamin D plays several important roles in your body. It’s essential for 
healthy bones, and it also helps to keep your immune system at its best. You 
can get vitamin D through food sources, but it’s almost impossible to get as 
much as you need through diet. If you drank ten tall glasses of vitamin D–
fortified milk every day, you would have only minimal vitamin D levels.
So how do you get vitamin D? It’s simple: Get some sun. It may sound hard to 
believe, but your skin actually produces vitamin D when it is exposed to the 
ultraviolet rays in sunlight. There are some catches, though. Glass blocks the 
rays in sunlight that make vitamin D, so you can’t get sunlight through a glass 
window and expect your skin to produce vitamin D. People with darker skin 
produce less vitamin D than people with paler skin given the same amount of 
sunlight, so if you have a dark skin tone you may need to get a bit more sun-
light for the desired effect.
 
Thirty minutes of sunlight a day will provide enough vitamin D for some 
people, but getting that amount can be hard to accomplish year round, par-
ticularly for people living in the high latitudes. If you can’t get that amount, 
be sure to supplement accordingly. Also keep in mind that sunscreen pretty 
much eliminates the vitamin D production process in your skin tissue. It’s 
good to get some sun; just don’t allow yourself to burn.

270
Part IV: Maintaining Healthy Detoxification Habits 
Vitamin D deficiencies are serious business. A lack of vitamin D can cause a 
variety of health conditions, from osteoporosis to rickets to an increased risk 
of diabetes and infections. Deficiencies are easily treated, but treatment for 
severe deficiencies can take several months.
 
Most medical labs can test for vitamin D levels, so if you think you may not be 
getting enough, I’d recommend going in for a test.
The RDA for vitamin D is 5–10 international units per day. I think you should 
be getting 2,000–5,000 international units for top-notch health.
Vitamin E
When some of your body’s cells — particularly muscle and red blood cells — 
are developing, vitamin E is an important part of the action. This vitamin is 
also a potent antioxidant, and you’d be hard pressed to get too many antioxi-
dants. (More on those substances later in this chapter.) Leafy green vegeta-
bles are a great place to find vitamin E, and you can also get it from vegetable 
oils, wheat germ, and liver.
 
If you supplement this vitamin, keep in mind that four natural forms of chemi-
cal compounds called tocopherols are used to make vitamin E supplements. 
Find a product that has all four types, and make sure the supplement is all 
natural (rather than synthetic).
Vitamin E is one of the fat-soluble vitamins, so your body does store excess 
amounts instead of flushing them out with your urine, but it’s pretty tough to 
get so much vitamin E that it has a toxic effect. The RDA is 15 milligrams, and 
I suggest getting between 200 and 400 milligrams each day. (A big difference, I 
know, but it’s an important vitamin!)
 
Even though the RDA is relatively low, a recent study showed that 90 percent 
of Americans get less than 15 milligrams per day. That’s a disturbing statistic, 
especially given the important role that vitamin E plays in good health. 
Vitamin K
The last essential vitamin I cover in this chapter is vitamin K. This one is 
necessary for blood clotting, which means that deficiencies can cause bleed-
ing problems. Good dietary sources of vitamin K include alfalfa, fish liver oils 
(cod liver oil is a classic example), leafy green vegetables, egg yolks, soybean 
oil, and liver. As with all the other vitamins, I think the FDA’s recommended 
daily allowance is pitifully low. They suggest getting 120 micrograms, but I 
think you should have about 1,000 micrograms every day.

271
 Chapter 17: Supporting Healthy Body Chemistry
Because of its role in the blood clotting process, vitamin K is used medically 
to reverse excessive doses of warfarin, a drug that’s administered to make 
blood less likely to clot. Some physicians will tell patients taking warfarin 
that they shouldn’t eat any leafy green vegetables because of the effect that 
the vitamin K can have on their warfarin regimen. (It’s hard to believe that a 
doctor would suggest that her patients not eat leafy green vegetables, but it 
really happens.) I think a better route is to stick to a regular, healthy, detox 
diet with lots of leafy green vegetables and then adjust the warfarin doses 
to the amount of vitamin K that you’re getting from your diet. That’s defi-
nitely not something you want to try to accomplish on your own, though, so 
if you’re taking warfarin make sure you have a good talk with your doctor 
about the situation before making any changes.
Making Room for Minerals
Like vitamins, minerals have a variety of functions in the body. Probably 
most significant is the role that minerals play in the formation of enzymes 
that make possible a lot of different (and crucial) chemical reactions. You 
can’t enjoy normal body function without the presence of several essential 
minerals in adequate amounts, and in this section I give you an idea of what 
you need and how much of it you should try to get every day.
If you’ve read any of the previous sections on vitamins, you already know 
that many of the FDA’s recommended daily allowances are, in my opinion, 
way too low. The same goes for some minerals, although the FDA and I do 
agree for a few of them.
It’s pretty tough to take in minerals to the point where they’re toxic unless 
you have kidney problems. If your kidneys are functioning normally, you’d 
have to really make a concerted effort to get toxic amounts of minerals 
through your diet, and doing so would even be hard to accomplish with sup-
plements. It’s much more likely that you’re not getting enough minerals; min-
eral deficiency has become more and more common due to the depletion of 
the soil used to grow vegetables (an important source of minerals) and also 
the heavy processing of food, which has a nasty way of ruining minerals.
Calcium
As far as minerals go, calcium has always seemed to maintain a pretty high 
profile. You can ask schoolchildren why they need calcium, and many of 
them will be able to tell you that you’ve got to have it for strong bones and 
teeth. That’s exactly right, but calcium also does quite a few other things for 
you. It helps control your blood pressure, for example, and ensures normal 
nerve function.

272
Part IV: Maintaining Healthy Detoxification Habits 
It probably comes as no surprise that milk and dairy products are among 
the most common dietary sources of calcium, but many people are shocked 
to find out that you can get just as much (or more, in some cases) calcium 
from leafy green vegetables like kale, as well as broccoli, almonds, cashews, 
sesame seeds, whole grains, and seafood.
If you don’t get enough calcium, your risk for osteoporosis and other bone 
conditions goes way up, as does the chance that you’ll suffer from problems 
with your nerves.
How much calcium do you need to get every day? The FDA recommends 
1,000 milligrams, but I say double it. You can get quite a lot of calcium from 
vegetables, especially if they’re 100 percent organic. But most people can’t 
get enough calcium in their diets, so supplementing is important.
 
When choosing a calcium supplement, try to get calcium hydroxylapatite. This 
form is far superior to calcium citrate, and especially to calcium carbonate, 
which blocks other minerals from being absorbed and is often contaminated 
with lead.
 
You can’t absorb calcium without vitamin D, so if you try to boost your intake 
of calcium without ensuring that you’re getting enough vitamin D, you’re really 
just spinning your wheels. I recommend getting at least 2,000 to 5,000 interna-
tional units of vitamin D each day.
Iron
We should all aspire to be iron men or iron women. Iron does some really 
critical things in your body, including metabolizing other nutrients and help-
ing to regulate your immune system. But iron’s most well known contribution 
to your health is its presence in hemoglobin, which is the amazing protein in 
your red blood cells that carries oxygen throughout your body.
Given that you can’t survive without iron, you may be shocked to learn 
that almost 60 percent of Americans are iron deficient. Low levels of iron 
can result in anemia. Iron deficiencies are common among vegetarians and 
also among pregnant or menstruating women. To make sure you’re getting 
enough iron, focus on eating meats, leafy green vegetables, apricots, nuts, 
seeds, kelp, and cherries.
 
Iron absorption is increased when you’re getting plenty of vitamin C, so if 
you’re worried about an iron deficiency, make sure your diet and supplement 
regimen includes lots of vitamin C. (That’s a good rule anyway because vita-
min C is such an important nutrient.)
Iron is one of the few nutrients for which the FDA’s daily recommended 
allowance is on par with what I think people should be getting. The RDA is 

273
 Chapter 17: Supporting Healthy Body Chemistry
8 milligrams per day, and if you’re getting that much you should be in good 
shape, especially if you’re also getting all the other essential nutrients in suf-
ficient amounts.
 
Iron is also more likely to cause toxicity if you’re getting too much of it, and 
it’s possible that extremely high levels of iron can help to cause cardiovascu-
lar disease, so do your best to stick to that 8 milligrams per day level.
Zinc
This one may bring up the rear on any alphabetical list of important minerals, 
but zinc deserves some attention. Zinc is involved in wound healing, and it 
supports normal immune function. You also need it for proper food diges-
tion. If you don’t get enough zinc, your immune system will suffer, and you 
can also end up with chronic fatigue symptoms. Boost your zinc intake by 
eating seafood, vegetables, pumpkin seeds, mushrooms, and brightly colored 
fruits.
The FDA and I are on the same page when it comes to the amount of zinc you 
should get each day; shoot for about 11 milligrams and you should be fine. 
That’s more than most Americans can say; as many as two-thirds are zinc 
deficient. Losing your sense of taste is one sign of zinc deficiency; if you have 
that problem, try some zinc.
Sodium
Sodium is very important in controlling fluid levels in the body. It’s also 
involved in blood pressure control, heart function, and the basic functions 
of your nerves and muscles. Sodium is added to a lot of the foods we eat, so 
getting enough of it isn’t usually a problem. Good natural sources of sodium 
are kelp, coconuts, carrots, and dried fruits. If your kidneys are working 
well, sodium toxicity shouldn’t be an issue, and the FDA and I agree that you 
should aim to get about 1,500 milligrams of sodium per day.
Potassium
If you want healthy blood pressure, normal heart function, and sharp senses 
(and who doesn’t?), you need to make sure you’re getting enough potas-
sium. Some of the best food sources are apricots, tomato puree, raisins, and 
figs; each of these has two to three times as much potassium as bananas. 
Potassium can also be found in green leafy vegetables, citrus fruits, avoca-
dos, legumes, and sunflower seeds.

274
Part IV: Maintaining Healthy Detoxification Habits 
 
Potassium deficiencies are common when people take diuretics or consume 
too much alcohol, caffeine, or sugar. The RDA for potassium is 4,700 milli-
grams per day, and I agree that should do the trick.
Magnesium
Magnesium is an extremely important mineral, and I think it’s often over-
looked in medicine today. What does it do for you? Well, it’s critical for 
normal nerve and muscle function, immune function, temperature regulation, 
and digestion, for starters. If you don’t get enough magnesium through diet 
or supplementing, you’ll probably suffer from muscle cramps and an irregu-
lar heartbeat, which in some cases can be fatal. And low magnesium levels 
can help to cause low potassium levels. A whopping 70 percent of Americans 
don’t get enough magnesium.
As important as magnesium is, many labs don’t test for it because it’s rarely 
found to be low in the blood. The problem is that magnesium can be danger-
ously low in the body’s tissues, and a blood test won’t reveal that fact.
A wholesome, healthy diet will include many of the major sources of mag-
nesium, including nuts, green veggies, seafood, beans, organic whole grains, 
and fruit. The RDA is 420 milligrams per day, but 1,000 milligrams is a health-
ier dose in my opinion.
Phosphorus
When it comes to normal sensory function and a healthy brain, phosphorus 
is key. This versatile mineral also works with calcium to maintain strong 
bones and teeth. Get phosphorous in organic whole grains, molasses, kelp, 
seeds, lentils, and dairy products. The FDA and I agree that 700 milligrams is 
a healthy amount, and low phosphorus levels aren’t very common at all.
Manganese
Manganese doesn’t get a lot of attention, but that doesn’t mean it’s not an 
important mineral. You need it for maximum immune function, and it also 
works as an antioxidant. Foods like eggs, green tea, kelp, blueberries, and 
avocados contain quite a bit of manganese. The RDA for manganese is a 
paltry 2.3 milligrams per day, but I strive to get about 500 milligrams per day 
instead.

275
 Chapter 17: Supporting Healthy Body Chemistry
 
It’s very difficult to take on toxic levels of manganese through diet and supple-
menting, but a small portion of the population ends up with manganese toxic-
ity in another way: through welding. Many of the materials used in welding 
contain very high amounts of manganese, and as a result welders are exposed 
to a huge amount of it. If you weld, or if you know a welder, it’s a good idea to 
get tested for manganese toxicity. Left unchecked, very high amounts of man-
ganese in the body can have negative effects on the brain.
Copper
Another dynamic mineral, copper plays a part in making hemoglobin, sup-
ports immune function, helps in the production of neurotransmitters, and is 
required for the development of connective tissue and nerve linings. You can 
get copper in beef, but if you’re not a meat eater, seek out copper sources 
like seafood, nuts, seeds, lentils, and mushrooms. A daily intake of 900 micro-
grams is recommended by the FDA, but you’ll be healthier if you double that 
amount.
Iodine
Iodine is essential for thyroid function, and your thyroid helps to control 
your energy levels. (Flip back to Chapter 11 for a lot of useful information on 
how toxicity can affect your energy.) If you don’t have enough iodine, your 
thyroid can’t operate, and you can end up with out-of-whack energy levels, 
weight gain, dry skin, constipation, profound fatigue, and much more. You 
can get iodine in fresh vegetables and in seafood, as well as in kelp and dulse 
(a sea vegetable). The RDA is 150 micrograms per day, but you’ll be better off 
if you bring in about 1,100 micrograms instead.
Selenium
Without selenium, your immune system couldn’t work properly. Your cell 
membranes would go haywire. It’s also been shown to have antioxidant 
effects, and it can help protect against certain kinds of cancer. About 60 per-
cent of Americans don’t get enough selenium, and you can avoid joining their 
ranks by eating whole grains, onions, garlic, broccoli, sesame seeds, and 
Brazil nuts. I think you should get 100 micrograms every day, which is about 
double what the FDA recommends.

276
Part IV: Maintaining Healthy Detoxification Habits 
Chromium
Chromium is necessary for your body to manage insulin successfully, and if 
you’re not getting enough chromium you could very well be putting yourself 
at a greater risk for diabetes. Organic vegetables are an excellent source, but 
you should probably look to supplement for chromium as well, because in 
my opinion you should take in about 500 micrograms per day. (The RDA is 
only 30 micrograms.)
Molybdenum
You’re better off not trying to pronounce this one — just make sure you’re 
getting enough of it in your diet. Molybdenum is needed for an enzyme that 
controls uric acid, which is a waste product that can affect your kidney 
health. The best food sources are navy beans, lentils, black-eyed peas, kidney 
beans, and some tree nuts. I concur with the FDA’s recommendation that you 
need to get 45 micrograms of molybdenum each day.
Embracing Essential Fatty Acids
Your body uses many different types of fatty acids in its huge range of chemi-
cal reactions, and you’re able to manufacture the vast majority of those fatty 
acids. But a couple of essential fatty acids cannot be made by your body, so 
you have to get them through your diet and through supplementing. Those 
two essential fatty acids are omega-3 and omega-6, and they’re absolutely 
necessary for good health.
Omega-3 fatty acids
Seven different kinds of omega-3 fatty acids exist, but the ones to keep an eye 
on are alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosa-
hexaenoic acid (DHA). ALA can be broken down into the other two, but that’s 
not an incredibly efficient process so you’re better off making sure that you 
get plenty of all three types. The best food sources for EPA and DHA are in 
the seafood category: fish, oysters, and crab. You can get ALA from a wider 
range of foods, including the following:
 
✓ Canola oil
 
✓ Flaxseeds or flaxseed oil
 
✓ Soybean oil
 
✓ Tofu
 
✓ Walnuts

277
 Chapter 17: Supporting Healthy Body Chemistry
Omega-3s are commonly called fish oils, and fish is an excellent source, but 
you can also get the oils from beef. The only catch is that the beef has to 
be completely grass fed. Cattle raised on feed lots and fed grains and other 
unnatural things don’t contain omega-3s.
The majority of Americans don’t get enough omega-3 fatty acids. Some 
estimates state that up to 85 percent of the population has an omega-3 defi-
ciency, and that’s a big time problem when you consider all the conditions 
that are related to low omega-3 levels, including the following:
 
✓ Increased memory loss
 
✓ Increased risk of Alzheimer’s
 
✓ Depression, bipolar disease, and schizophrenia
 
✓ Insufficient amount of neurotransmitters
 
✓ Increased blood pressure
 
✓ Increased risk of heart disease, including atherosclerosis, angina, heart 
attack, and stroke
 
✓ Arthritis
 
✓ Ulcerative colitis
To avoid health problems associated with a lack of omega-3 fatty acids, you 
should aim to get about 2–3 grams per day through diet and supplementing. 
If you’re already suffering from some of those problems, up the dose to 4–5 
grams every day. Omega-3 supplements usually contain fish oils, and as with 
all fish products there’s a chance for mercury contamination, so make sure 
your fish oil supplements have been independently tested for mercury.
 
It’s extremely important that pregnant women and babies get enough omega-3 
fatty acids, which are critical for growth and development.
Omega-6 fatty acids
Omega-6 fatty acids are important for intercellular signaling, which is to say 
that your cells need omega-6s to create the chemicals they use to communi-
cate. (Sounds bizarre, I know, but it’s true.)
While people are very commonly omega-3 deficient, it’s actually pretty rare 
that someone doesn’t get enough omega-6s. That’s because omega-6s are 
present in beef, corn oil, and soy oil, which are abundant in the diets of most 
Americans. When a person’s omega-6 levels are too high compared to omega-
3s, inflammation can result.

278
Part IV: Maintaining Healthy Detoxification Habits 
Assisting with Amino Acids
Amino acids are the building blocks for protein, and proteins are required 
for life. There are eight essential amino acids; your body can’t produce them 
on its own, which means you have to get them through your diet. Twelve 
other amino acids are called conditionally essential because if you don’t get 
enough of the essential amino acids, you have to get some of the other 12 in 
your diet.
I won’t devote too much space here to a discussion of the essential amino 
acids, because people rarely end up with essential amino acid deficiencies. 
That’s because you get plenty of amino acids if you eat meat, eggs, poultry, 
or fish. Most people eat at least one of those things, and many people eat all 
of them, so for them amino acids aren’t terribly hard to come by.
 
Vegetarians and vegans sometimes find it harder to secure all the essential 
amino acids, and in those cases I recommend bringing plenty of quinoa, buck-
wheat, hempseed, and amaranth into the diet. All are good sources of essen-
tial amino acids, and they’re very easy to include in your diet because they’re 
versatile, delicious foods. (If you’ve never had them, I definitely encourage you 
to branch out and give them a try, even if you eat meat.)
I go into some additional detail about amino acids in Chapter 7, so please flip 
back there if you’d like to read more.
Adding in Antioxidants
Antioxidants are beneficial chemicals that help to neutralize toxins in your 
body. Considering that the toxic load most people are exposed to continues 
to rise with each passing year, antioxidants are becoming more and more 
important for overall health. Some antioxidants have specific actions on dif-
ferent parts of the body, and some have a more general effect, but all of them 
are helpful.
 
People can produce antioxidants in their bodies, and the level at which 
they’re able to do so is a genetic factor. You can’t do much about your genes, 
but you can make sure you’re getting plenty of antioxidants through diet and 
supplementing.
Here are some of the antioxidants that you should try to include in your diet 
and supplement regimen, and the doses that I think are the most beneficial:

279
 Chapter 17: Supporting Healthy Body Chemistry
 
✓ Glutathione: This is the most important antioxidant our body produces. 
It can be supplemented at 3,000 milligrams per day.
 
✓ Alpha-lipoic acid: ALA is extremely effective for detoxing the liver. Take 
800–1,600 milligrams per day.
 
✓ Silymarin: Often called milk thistle, this one increases glutathione and 
can really boost your liver health. Take 100 milligrams per day.
 
✓ N-acetylcysteine: It offers liver protection and helps boost pancreas 
function in diabetes. Take about 600 milligrams per day.
 
✓ Selenium: I discuss this mineral earlier in the chapter. It improves thy-
roid function, increases glutathione, decreases the effects of mercury, 
and is shown to decrease cancer in rats. Try to get about 100 micro-
grams each day.
 
✓ Melatonin: This one stabilizes sleep and reconstitutes glutathione. Aim 
to get 3–12 milligrams per day.
 
✓ Sulforaphane: Also called broccoli seed extract, this potent multipurpose 
antioxidant increases glutathione and has anticancer properties. Use 500 
milligrams daily.
 
✓ Resveratrol: This exciting new antioxidant has anticancer properties 
and offers improvement in blood sugar control for diabetics. Thirty mil-
ligrams per day will do the job.
 
✓ Coenzyme Q10: This is a required enzyme for the production of energy 
inside every cell in your body. It also has antioxidant properties. You 
can supplement with 100–200 milligrams per day.
 
✓ Vitamin A: This vitamin has strong antioxidant properties. Take 7,500 
micrograms per day.
 
✓ Vitamin C: Another vitamin that offers excellent antioxidant effects, 
Vitamin C also suppresses cancer growth in high doses. Take 2,000 mil-
ligrams per day, and up that number to between 4,000 and 8,000 milli-
grams if you’re sick.
 
✓ Lycopene: It decreases the risk for prostate cancer in men.
 
✓ Beta-carotene: This precursor to vitamin A packs a healthy antioxidant 
punch. Shoot for about 25,000 micrograms per day.
 
✓ Vitamin D: I talk about vitamin D in my section on vitamins earlier in 
this chapter, but it’s also worth noting that it works wonders as an 
antioxidant. Take 2,000 to 5,000 international units each day. Have your 
doctor check your level.

Trying a Few Other Kinds of 
Detoxification
In This Chapter
▶ Seeing the detoxification benefits of saunas
▶ Calling on the detox strengths of chelation
▶ Assessing the usefulness of acupuncture
▶ Harnessing the power of meditation
T
he human body is a wonderful machine. It is designed to heal itself and 
correct almost anything that goes wrong, so long as it has all the nutri-
ents it needs and is not poisoned. Unfortunately, in the last 50 years or so we 
have been getting poisoned by the environment and many foods. Fortunately, 
we do have available some really good options to boost the body’s ability to 
get rid of toxins.
Because toxins and nutritional deficiencies are major factors in acute and 
chronic disease today, we need to look at ways to increase our detoxification 
efforts. That’s what this chapter is all about.
Sweating It Out in a Sauna
If you’re really interested in detoxifying your body, you can’t ignore the use-
fulness and practicality of saunas. Using a sauna is a wonderful way to rid 
your body of toxins.
Saunas certainly aren’t a new invention. They’ve been around for thousands 
of years, and their use developed independently in many different societies 
throughout human history. The Romans had their baths (called thermae), the 
Japanese their hot springs (called onsen), and the Aztecs their sweat lodges 
(called temescalli). All were based on the same idea: Humans spend time in 
a hot environment and sweat heavily to produce curative and restorative 
effects on health.

282
Part IV: Maintaining Healthy Detoxification Habits 
Why are saunas so effective at removing toxins? The concept is simple: 
Saunas make your body sweat at a very high level, and sweating helps to 
flush toxins from your body. Most of the toxins you’re exposed to are fat-
soluble, which means your body is able to tuck them away in your fat cells in 
an effort to get the toxins away from your organs and other vital parts. But 
fat-soluble toxins are released during times of stress or illness, and they then 
travel through your bloodstream, causing harm to organs and important tis-
sues. After that, some of them end up right back in your fat cells, where they 
can persist for years. After the toxins reach your fats cells, the only way to 
detoxify them is to sweat.
 
Your sweat glands are capable of removing one-third as much toxic material 
as your kidneys, and many of the toxins that are removed through sweating 
aren’t removed by the kidneys or broken down by the liver. These two facts 
alone give you a terrific idea of the importance of detoxification through 
sweating.
Before the advent of air conditioning, humans in most parts of the world 
were subjected to a kind of sauna every year for several months during 
summer. That helped to keep the toxins — which were much lower at that 
point anyway — to a minimum.
Without the natural detoxification caused by sweating in the continuous 
summer heat, humans must find another way to sweat enough to flush out 
the accumulated toxins. Saunas are the answer.
Understanding the many benefits of sauna
Saunas have been around for thousands of years for a reason: They’re great 
for your health. Your body benefits several ways from spending time in a 
sauna regularly, and I give you a feel for these advantages in the next couple 
of pages.
Flushing out toxins
Saunas are great for flushing out the toxins that build up in your body’s fat 
cells. Your kidneys are detoxification powerhouses, and the intense sweating 
you can enjoy while spending time in a sauna can clear out about one-third of 
the toxic material that your kidneys remove from your bloodstream. That is 
no small contribution to a detoxification effort.
 
Multiple studies have shown that saunas are effective in removing solvents, 
organic chemicals, PCBs, pharmaceuticals, and heavy metal toxins from the 
human body.

283
 Chapter 18: Trying a Few Other Kinds of Detoxification
Consider a very dramatic example of the detoxification power of saunas 
related to the 2001 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center in New York. 
As you may imagine, the people at Ground Zero were exposed to massive 
amounts of toxins. Firemen and other rescue workers were exposed to toxins 
ranging from solvents to heavy metals, and the exposure lasted as long as the 
cleanup effort. Mercury was one of the biggest problems; there was enough 
mercury in the fluorescent light bulbs in buildings that were destroyed to 
poison every person in Manhattan.
To help these heroic individuals fight off the dangerous health effects of 
the toxins they’d been exposed to while helping to save lives and clean up 
Ground Zero, an intense sauna program was implemented. The program was 
based on one designed by L. Ron Hubbard. (You can read about Hubbard’s 
sauna program in the nearby sidebar.) A total of 822 people who were 
exposed to toxins as a result of the events of September 11, 2001 were treated 
with frequent, long sauna sessions over a period of weeks. The results have 
been truly remarkable; an overwhelming majority of the program participants 
have reported major improvements in the toxin-related ailments they were 
suffering from as a result of their exposure to toxins at Ground Zero.
Enjoying the other benefits of sauna
The health benefits of using a sauna don’t stop at detoxification, although 
they do fit in with the core values of a detoxified lifestyle. For instance, the 
high temperatures of a sauna can give your immune system a boost. The 
number of white blood cells that fight infections increases as much as 58 per-
cent with the levels of increased temperature you get in a sauna. And that’s 
L. Ron Hubbard’s sauna protocol
In the 1970s, L. Ron Hubbard developed a 
sauna protocol to help drug addicts heal from 
their addictions. His theory was that even after 
addicts stopped taking drugs, drug residue was 
sequestered in fat cells. Like any other toxin, 
the drug residue would be released occasion-
ally during times of stress. Those releases 
would trigger the flashbacks and cravings that 
plague addicts who are trying to keep moving 
away from their addictions.
Hubbard’s protocol uses a dry sauna for three 
to five hours per day, for an average of 34 days. 
It involves exercising before sauna and even 
during the sauna. Integral to the program are 
the use of vitamin B3 (an essential vitamin, also 
known as niacin) in increasing dosages, cold-
pressed oils with omega-3 and omega-6 essen-
tial fatty acids, phosphatidylcholine, and a few 
other vitamins and supplements. Not only are 
recreational drug residues removed during the 
program, but fat-soluble residues of numerous 
environmental toxins, heavy metals, and even 
pharmaceutical drugs are flushed out as well.

284
Part IV: Maintaining Healthy Detoxification Habits 
just the beginning. Your T cells (another important part of your immune 
system) and antibodies can increase by as much as 2,000 percent. Also, a lot 
of microbes just can’t take the heat; many of them die off at temperatures of 
104 degrees Fahrenheit. Sauna treatments are often used to help people suf-
fering from the common cold, and the success levels are high.
Increased temperatures also help your body to secrete endorphins, which are 
the “feel good” chemicals in your brain. Endorphins also make great painkill-
ers, so it’s very common for people suffering from chronic and acute pain to 
get quite a bit of relief from sitting in a sauna.
Studies have shown sauna to be effective in reducing the symptoms of a 
range of conditions, from arthritis to chronic fatigue syndrome to fibromy-
algia. Research has also supported the use of sauna to help with glaucoma, 
anorexia, chronic obstructive lung disease, diabetes, obesity, hypertension, 
and atherosclerosis. If all that weren’t enough, saunas can even help people 
quit smoking and kick drug addictions. Pretty incredible, huh?
If you spend time in a sauna, your cardiovascular system will also thank you. 
Here are just a few of the benefits you can get from regular sauna sessions:
 
✓ Stronger heart muscle contractions
 
✓ Improved function of the cells that line your arteries, which are 
extremely important in helping to keep cardiovascular disease at bay
 
✓ Reduced incidence of abnormal heart beats
 
✓ Lower blood pressure resulting from a healthy enlarging of the blood 
vessels
 
✓ Increased blood plasma and number of red blood cells, which helps with 
oxygen distribution and increases exercise tolerance
 
✓ Increased fat metabolism, which leads to weight loss
In addition to that last bullet point, a second mechanism for weight loss 
is also related to saunas. When you sweat heavily in a sauna and flush the 
toxins out of your fat cells, that process allows the fat cells to reduce in 
size, which can be a big help with weight loss. I’m a firm believer that toxins 
imbedded in fat cells are a major contributor to the obesity epidemic in the 
United States.
Getting a feel for the three 
different kinds of sauna
If you read any of the last few pages, you’re probably pretty excited about 
using saunas to improve your health. I’m happy to report that you have three 
excellent sauna options to choose from: wet saunas, dry saunas, and far-
infrared saunas.

285
 Chapter 18: Trying a Few Other Kinds of Detoxification
No matter which type of sauna you choose to enjoy, here are a few sauna 
basics to keep in mind:
 
✓ Wear as little clothing as possible when in a sauna. Enjoying a sauna in 
the buff is a great idea, but if you’re in a public place, you need to find 
out if that’s appropriate before going au naturel.
 
✓ When you first start using a sauna, limit your sessions to 20 minutes or 
less. Gradually work your way up to sessions of 30 to 40 minutes. Do two 
sessions each day for maximum detox.
 
✓ Drink lots of water while in the sauna. About 10 to 20 ounces every 30 
minutes is a good general rule.
 
✓ Make sure you’re relaxed while in the sauna to maximize the experience. 
Saunas are a great place to meditate — just be sure you don’t fall asleep!
 
✓ Shower immediately after you’re done, taking care to brush the skin 
thoroughly to remove the toxins you just flushed out with your sweat.
 
✓ If you can, try to rest for 15 minutes after your sauna session.
 
✓ Saunas are a great way to start or end your day, so don’t be afraid to go 
for a sauna session first thing in the morning or in the evening.
I’m convinced that saunas should be a part of all our lives. Our exposure to 
toxins makes saunas a necessity if we’re going to keep our bodies healthy.
 
Saunas can be hazardous to your health if you have certain conditions, espe-
cially heart disease or high blood pressure, so be sure to talk to your doctor 
before beginning any sauna program. I go into more detail on who shouldn’t 
sauna a little later in this section.
Wet saunas
A wet sauna is exactly what it sounds like: a space with elevated tempera-
tures and also elevated amounts of water vapor in the air. If a dry sauna is 
like the weather in Phoenix, a wet sauna is like the weather in sultry New 
Orleans.
The steam in a wet sauna is usually generated by pouring water on volcanic 
rocks that are heated by electric or gas heaters. Some saunas use wood fires 
to generate heat, but they’re not common. Temperatures in a high humidity 
wet sauna generally range from 150 to 190 degrees Fahrenheit.
One of the problems with wet saunas is that it’s harder to evaluate the 
amount of sweating you accomplish because the water vapor condenses on 
your skin and creates excess moisture. Wet saunas can also be difficult to 
keep clean because mold is likely to grow in the warm, moist environment. 
Finally, some people find that the extremely high levels of water vapor can 
bother their nose and sinuses.

286
Part IV: Maintaining Healthy Detoxification Habits 
Dry saunas
Dry saunas are extremely common because they’re easier to construct and 
maintain, and you don’t have to deal with the mess that the water in a wet 
sauna creates. Mold is much less of a problem, as well, and many people cite 
that as one of the main reasons they prefer dry saunas. Temperatures in a 
dry sauna can reach up to 200 degrees Fahrenheit! That’s plenty to generate 
a very healthy sweat and help to move toxins from your fat cells out through 
your skin.
Far-infrared saunas
Far-infrared saunas may sound a little space age, and truthfully they’ve only 
started catching on in popularity in recent years. At its core, the technology 
is pretty simple: Far-infrared saunas have a specialized heater that produces 
energy in the infrared spectrum. Feel free to dig up your high school phys-
ics books to read up on the details of the infrared spectrum if you’d like, but 
for this discussion you just need to know that infrared energy heats up your 
body without heating up the air around you. It can sound a little discomfort-
ing to some people, but the practice really is safe. If you read about it, you’ll 
find that some people absolutely swear by it. Many users contend that far-
infrared saunas penetrate the body better than wet or dry saunas, producing 
a more thorough and heavier sweating effect.
Here are a few advantages of far-infrared saunas:
 
✓ There aren’t any hot surfaces, so there’s nothing that can burn your 
skin.
 
✓ Lower heat ranges (100–130 degrees Fahrenheit) are easier on patients 
with cardiovascular problems.
 
✓ Far-infrared saunas are more energy efficient.
 
✓ The warm-up time is only about 5 to 10 minutes, compared to 30 min-
utes or more with a wet or dry sauna.
 
✓ Far-infrared saunas are portable, easy to assemble, and less expensive.
 
✓ Some reports indicate that you sweat two to three times more than you 
do in wet or dry saunas.
 
✓ Recent studies have shown that sweat from traditional saunas is 97 
percent water, but sweat generated using far-infrared saunas is about 
85 percent water and about 15 percent other materials, such as heavy 
metals, sulfuric acid, sodium, ammonia, uric acid, and fat-soluble toxins.

287
 Chapter 18: Trying a Few Other Kinds of Detoxification
Knowing who shouldn’t sauna
Saunas are safe for most people, but you shouldn’t use one if you have any of 
the following health conditions:
 
✓ Adrenal suppression (meaning that your body doesn’t respond to heat)
 
✓ Anemia
 
✓ Hemophilia
 
✓ Hyperthyroidism
 
✓ Recent myocardial infarction (heart attack)
 
✓ Unstable angina pectoris (chest pain or discomfort)
Also, you should avoid using a sauna or at least use extreme caution if any of 
the following is true:
 
✓ You’re pregnant.
 
✓ You have acute joint injuries.
 
✓ You have enclosed infections.
 
✓ You have artificial joints.
 
✓ You have silicone implants.
 
✓ You’re menstruating.
 
✓ You’re taking medication that can be removed through sweat.
Capitalizing on Chelation
Chelation is another detoxification process that can be very useful as you 
work to rid your body of the harmful toxins that can have long-term damag-
ing effects on your health. Generally speaking, chelation is a term used to 
describe the chemical attraction of one substance to another substance. 
The word chele means “claw-like,” and you can think of chelation as one sub-
stance acting as a claw that grips another substance in your body. The basic 
idea is that you introduce a substance — called a chelating agent — to your 
body, where it binds to toxic material and is flushed out with your urine.

288
Part IV: Maintaining Healthy Detoxification Habits 
When it comes to detoxification, the most basic and well-known form of che-
lation is the use of the drug ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid — you’re better 
off referring to it as EDTA — to remove lead from the body’s systems. EDTA 
was developed by the Germans before World War II to remove lead from 
clothing dyes. It was later found that EDTA could be given to people with 
lead poisoning, and the chemical would remove the lead from their bodies. 
After the war, EDTA was brought to the United States and patented by a 
pharmaceutical company for its usefulness in treating lead poisoning. Further 
research showed that EDTA removed not only lead but also chromium, iron, 
mercury, copper, zinc, cadmium, cobalt, aluminum, manganese, magnesium, 
and calcium.
Since then, the effectiveness of chelation using EDTA has come under fire. 
Many traditional physicians are skeptical about the usefulness of EDTA, even 
though it has been identified as a potent antioxidant that has been shown to 
produce beneficial effects in many studies. Millions of people have received 
chelation therapy to remove heavy metals from their bodies, and the results 
have been overwhelmingly positive.
 
The effectiveness of EDTA in removing heavy metal toxins has been disputed 
over the years, but no matter what you hear, keep in mind that it is an FDA-
approved drug that has been used safely for more than 60 years.
Several different types of chelation are commonly used today: natural, oral, 
rectal, transdermal, and intravenous. Each method has its advantages and 
potential problems, and I fill you in on the range of options over the next few 
pages.
Natural
Natural chelation involves the use of a substance that occurs naturally to 
draw toxic materials out of the body. The natural substances are many and 
varied, but one prime example is glutathione. Glutathione is a natural antioxi-
dant that has been shown to work well in the removal of heavy metals. Most 
people take it orally, in capsule form. Glutathione is thought to remove mul-
tiple toxins from your body, and you can increase its effectiveness by taking 
melatonin supplements at the same time.
Another common substance used in natural chelation is chlorella. Chlorella 
is a single-celled, freshwater algae that has been shown to attach to heavy 
metals in the intestines. From there, the mix of chlorella and heavy metal 
toxins is removed from the body with the feces. I would certainly place chlo-
rella in the “might help, and can’t hurt” category, and I would recommend 
taking it on a regular basis if you’re interested in natural chelation.

289
 Chapter 18: Trying a Few Other Kinds of Detoxification
If you want an extremely natural form of chelation, try incorporating more 
cilantro into your diet. Cilantro is an herb in the parsley family that has been 
shown to help remove heavy metals from the intestines. Many people find it 
delicious even without considering its detoxification properties!
Oral
Oral chelation involves the use of chemical chelating agents that can be 
taken orally to help reduce the amount of toxins that are floating around in 
your body. Two of the most common chemical chelating agents taken orally 
are dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) and sodium 2,3-dimercaptopropane-1-
sulfonate (DMPS). Taking something orally is extremely easy because you 
can eat it or drink it with few issues, but DMSA and DMPS have been called 
into question recently because many people believe they aren’t absorbed 
very well by the body when taken orally. Also, if you have existing stomach 
or bowel problems, the absorption rate is even weaker.
Rectal
If you’re looking around for chelation options, you’ll probably run across 
rectal suppositories that include EDTA. (You can find such products easily 
on the Internet.) All I can say is buyer beware! EDTA and DMSA can be given 
rectally, but the absorption rate is very poor and the results are extremely 
hard to evaluate. If you go this route, don’t expect much!
Transdermal
Like rectal suppositories used for chelation, transdermal chelation doesn’t 
produce the best of results. Absorbing a chelating agent through the skin 
doesn’t really work all that well. I don’t recommend the transdermal method 
of chelation. If this method appeals to you and you decide to pursue it, just 
don’t plan on the best possible results, especially when it comes to reducing 
heavy metal toxicity.
Intravenous
When it comes to chelation, intravenous administration of chelating agents 
is the gold standard. IV chelation offers exact dosages that aren’t affected by 
varying rates of absorption, and it really removes all the variables that are 
present with oral, rectal, and transdermal options.

290
Part IV: Maintaining Healthy Detoxification Habits 
 
As you can imagine, the intravenous chelation method must be done by a 
qualified professional, so if you’re very serious about removing toxins — par-
ticularly heavy metal toxins — from your body using chelation, ask your 
doctor about your options for chelation with intravenous chelating agents, 
but don’t expect a traditional physician to have any knowledge or respect for 
chelation.
DMPS
When administered via IV, DMPS is a slam dunk for removing mercury from 
the human body. It has a long, illustrious history of success and safety. It 
hasn’t been approved by the FDA but is approved to be imported and used 
legally, and pharmacies that offer compounding can prepare it for IV use.
EDTA
If you want to harness the power of chelation to remove any toxin other than 
mercury, EDTA administered through IV is one of the best ways to go. It has 
a 60-year history as a safe and effective means for removing a wide range of 
toxins, particularly the heavy metal toxins that are so prevalent in our envi-
ronment today.
Advocating Acupuncture
Acupuncture is an ancient method of improving health and healing, and it fits 
in extremely well with a general effort to make your body perform at a higher 
level without the introduction of potentially harmful toxins. The origins of 
acupuncture are in Asia, where acupuncture is a part of traditional Chinese 
medicine. Variations also come from Tibet, Vietnam, and Korea. At this point, 
more than 3 million adults and 150,000 children in the United States receive 
acupuncture treatments each year.
In broad terms, acupuncture involves the use of extremely small, sharp nee-
dles that are inserted into the skin at specific points that have been shown to 
produce a range of effects on the body. In total, more than 2,000 acupuncture 
points on the body can be stimulated individually or, more commonly, in 
groups.
The needles aren’t the extent of acupuncture treatment, however. Several 
variations exist, including the use of mild electric currents in the needles. 
Some practitioners choose to apply pressure to certain points instead of 
actually inserting needles. Some others embrace a variation of acupuncture 
called auriculotherapy, which is based on the concept that acupuncture 
points on the ears can be stimulated to produce effects across the entire 
body.

291
 Chapter 18: Trying a Few Other Kinds of Detoxification
A trained, talented acupuncturist will assess your health history, as well as 
any symptoms of current conditions, to figure out which abnormalities in 
your health are causing you the most harm. He then stimulates the acupunc-
ture points on your body that will help to relieve you of your conditions.
Here are just a few conditions that are commonly treated using acupuncture:
 
✓ Allergic rhinitis (allergies to dust, dander, or pollen)
 
✓ Chemotherapy side effects
 
✓ Depression
 
✓ Dysentery
 
✓ Headache
 
✓ Hypertension
 
✓ Nausea and vomiting (including morning sickness)
 
✓ Primary dysmenorrheal (painful periods)
 
✓ Rheumatoid arthritis
 
✓ Sciatica
 
✓ Sprains
 
✓ Stroke
The most accepted use of acupuncture in the United States is for the treat-
ment of pain. Acupuncture is used to treat fibromyalgia, carpel tunnel 
syndrome, lower back pain, menstrual cramps, myofacial pain, neck pain, 
osteoarthritis, tennis elbow, and postoperative dental pain.
Acupuncture is safe and, when practiced correctly, has no harmful side 
effects. The big challenge is to find someone who is skilled in the art. You 
should check the credentials of anyone you’re thinking of seeing for an acu-
puncture treatment. Training varies from weekend courses to thousands of 
hours of training. I once checked the credentials of an alternative practitioner 
who was the president of two national organizations, which seemed very 
impressive at first. The problem was that he was the only member of both 
organizations.
Mixing in Meditation
Meditation dovetails extremely well with other detoxification measures. It 
has taken many forms across the centuries, and many different cultures and 
religions use it. I don’t have the space here to explain all the various types of 
mediation, but you should try to embrace some general principles related to 
the practice as you endeavor to lead a detoxified life.

292
Part IV: Maintaining Healthy Detoxification Habits 
In general, meditation practices are mental disciplines in which a person 
attempts to reach beyond reflective thought to grasp a deeper state of con-
sciousness, relaxation, and awareness. If practiced effectively, meditation 
results in a marked reduction in stress that can improve your health on every 
possible level.
Many religions utilize meditation as an integral part of the belief system, but 
meditation doesn’t have to be related to any religion. Every person needs to 
seek out the form of meditation that suits him or her best, but you need to 
keep an open mind and realize that you stand to gain quite a lot just through 
clearing your mind and focusing your thoughts for a few minutes each day.

hen you’re grocery shopping, do you feel like you have a very good 
sense of what kinds of foods you should put into your cart and, even-
tually, into your body? If not, that’s one of the first skills you should develop 
as you work on the many ways that you can detoxify your body and strive for 
maximum health.
In Chapter 6, I fill you in on what you shouldn’t be eating. In Chapter 7, I focus 
on all the kinds of foods that should fill your shopping cart, your pantry, and 
your stomach. If you’re interested in some detailed information on detox diet 
food choices, those are the chapters for you. However, if you want to get 
some quick, basic information on the foods that you should definitely leave 
on the grocery store shelf, you’ve come to the right place. Read on to find out 
which foods you should eat very, very sparingly or — if you’re really serious 
about detoxification and building good health — not at all!
Milk
Cow’s milk can seem like a harmless food, and millions of dollars are spent 
each year to make you think that it’s healthy. But the truth is that most of the 
milk you find in grocery store refrigerators can be harmful to your health. 
Most milk is heavily processed: It’s spun, heated, separated, and reconsti-
tuted, for starters. The majority of the healthy proteins that can be found in 
milk are destroyed during all the processing steps. How different is the milk 
at the grocery store from natural cow’s milk? One research project gave gro-
cery-store-bought milk to newborn calves, and all of them died before they 
reached 2 months of age.

296
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Here’s some more food for thought: A 12-year Harvard study of 80,000 nurses 
showed that the nurses who drank the most commercially produced milk 
also had the most bone fractures. That certainly doesn’t jibe with the mes-
sage that comes from milk proponents, who insist that we need to drink milk 
to get the calcium and vitamin D we need. That’s simply not the case. You 
can get all the calcium and vitamin D necessary for strong bones (and more) 
from vegetables, sunshine (for the vitamin D), and supplements.
Some people can’t imagine life without cow’s milk. If you’re among them, 
please find a good, clean source of whole, raw milk. Chances are you can get 
a tip if you ask around at your local health food store.
 
If you want to drink milk but you’re not dead set on drinking cow’s milk, try 
substitutes like rice milk, almond milk, and soy milk. (However, if you go with 
the soy milk option, remember that almost all soy products have been created 
using genetically modified soybeans.)
 
Many brands of commercially produced milk contain antibiotics and hor-
mones. If you want to drink cow’s milk, make completely sure that the brand 
you buy states clearly on the label that the milk doesn’t contain these toxic 
substances.
Margarine
It always breaks my heart when I hear about someone who has decided to 
give up butter in favor of margarine in order to lose weight and stay healthy. 
Given the amount of fat present in butter, a lot of people avoid it. But please 
don’t start eating margarine as a substitute. It’s unhealthy and in many cases 
can contain trace amounts of toxins.
About halfway through the 20th century, people began eating margarine as a 
butter substitute for health reasons. We’re now at the point where Americans 
eat twice as much margarine as they do butter. The problem is that mar-
garine isn’t healthy. More often than not it contains hydrogenated oils and 
trans fats, and you don’t want either of those things in your system.
What’s more, margarine is made using processes that involve toxins, and I 
have a hard time believing that margarine makers are able to remove all the 
toxins from the finished product. Two of the toxins commonly used to make 
margarine are hexane — a nasty petrochemical solvent — and nickel, which 
is a very harmful heavy metal toxin.
 
Before you reach for the margarine, consider using very small amounts of 
100 percent organic butter instead. The butter may not be as good for you 
as many of the other foods out there, but it’s always better for you than 
margarine.

297
 Chapter 19: Ten Foods to Leave at the Store
Corn Oil
If you look in most people’s pantries, you’re likely to find a bottle of corn oil. 
If the same goes for you, do yourself a favor and get rid of that bottle!
Corn oil is an extremely common cooking and baking ingredient, but it’s flat-
out not good for you. In addition to being loaded with plenty of bad fats, most 
corn oil is hydrogenated and made using genetically modified corn. I won’t 
get into the nitty gritty details of genetically modified food products here, but 
please flip back to Chapter 6 if you want the scoop.
 
If you’re looking for healthy oil alternatives to corn oil, consider using 100 per-
cent organic coconut oil and hempseed oil. Find them at a nearby health food 
store or online.
Artificial Sweeteners
In my opinion, very few products are as detrimental to detoxification and a 
detox diet lifestyle as artificial sweeteners. If you could get a dime for every 
food product in the average grocery store that contains an artificial sweet-
ener, you could easily be reading this book on a big, beautiful boat some-
place sunny (with a nice glass of 100 percent organic carrot juice by your 
side!).
I cover the details of artificial sweeteners in Chapter 9, so flip back there if 
you want to read up. For the purposes of this list, I’ll just say that you should 
do everything you can to cut artificial sweeteners and any products that con-
tain artificial sweeteners out of your diet. You’re much more likely to live a 
healthy, detoxified life if you can make that important step.
 
You should avoid artificial sweeteners at all costs and do your best to limit 
your intake of sugar. But what’s left to use for sweetening foods and drinks? 
Try using stevia, which is an extremely low calorie, natural sweetener that 
comes from a plant and has been used in other cultures without negative 
health impacts for decades.
Artificially Colored Foods
When it comes to foods that have been colored, I like to imagine what it 
would be like to go back in time a few centuries and offer some of these 
food items to the people of that era. Can you imagine trying to get an early 
American settler, for example, to drink a fluorescent blue liquid and eat a 
neon pink snack cake?

298
Part V: The Part of Tens 
 
The chemicals used to make most food colorings are a murderer’s row of 
harmful toxins, and you don’t want them in your body. Many food coloring 
products are made of coal tar — the same stuff used on our streets. Don’t eat 
foods that have been colored! To make sure you’re making wise choices, 
always check ingredients lists. When in doubt, do a simple logic check: Is the 
bright green gummy snack in front of you really that color because of natural 
factors? Probably not. Skip it.
Olestra
In the 1980s, scientists cooked up a new substance that was touted as a ter-
rific replacement for fat. The idea was simple: The olestra molecule had some 
of the characteristics of fat, but it was too big to be absorbed by the human 
digestive system so it didn’t end up in your body and didn’t cause weight 
gain and all the other problems commonly attributed to fat.
Sound too good to be true? It is. At its very best, olestra is simply a fake, 
unnatural fat. At its worst, it makes absolutely no contribution to weight loss 
and can cause a disgusting anal discharge condition. Not good.
What’s more, olestra doesn’t do any of the positive things that good fats can 
do for your body, like helping you to absorb important vitamins (vitamins A, 
D, E, and K). Leave olestra and any products that contain olestra on your gro-
cery store shelves.
Tuna
Tuna is a delicious, easy-to-find fish, and you can get it in all kinds of 
forms — from a gourmet tuna steak at a fancy restaurant to a big vat of tuna 
salad at a corner grocery store and deli. Unfortunately, more often than not, 
tuna contains the deadly toxin mercury. Because of that disturbing trend, I 
have to suggest you avoid eating tuna whenever possible.
If you’re used to eating tuna and you want to continue making fish part of your 
diet, try using wild Alaskan salmon instead. That variety of fish traditionally 
scores very low when it comes to mercury levels, and it also happens to taste 
great and works in a huge range of delicious recipes. (For a good example, 
check out the recipe for Crunchy Curried Salmon Wraps in Chapter 9!)

299
 Chapter 19: Ten Foods to Leave at the Store
Soy
When I tell my patients that they should consider avoiding eating soy or 
buying soy food products, they sometimes look at me in disbelief. Most 
people think of soy as harmless or even healthy, and in a perfect world that 
might be true.
The problem is that an overwhelming amount of the soy and soy products 
available in the United States come from genetically modified soybeans. And 
if you know anything about soy, you know how impossible it is to get away 
from the stuff. It’s everywhere!
What if you want to keep soy and foods that contain soy in your diet? Make 
sure that the soy you eat is 100 percent organic and that it doesn’t come from 
a genetically modified soyce . . . er, source.
Processed Meats
It doesn’t take a natural foods specialist to realize that processed meats are 
a bad idea. Just looking at some potted meats can make you wonder how it 
ever makes sense for someone to eat those materials. But lots of people do 
eat potted meat, along with other processed meats like lunchmeat and hot 
dogs.
 
Just to set the record straight, here’s what’s wrong with processed meat: It 
offers little or no nutritional value and can be full of toxins. All the various 
chemical and mechanical techniques used to make processed meat rob it of 
whatever nutrients it had to begin with, and just about every processed meat 
product on the market contains a toxin called sodium nitrite. It’s a chemical 
used as a preservative, and after it’s in your body it can go through a chemi-
cal reaction or two to create nitrosamines, which are compounds that many 
people believe cause cancer (particularly liver cancer).
Animal Fats
What’s an animal fat? You guessed it: any fat that comes from an animal. 
Animal fats are not bad if they come from clean animals. And fats (oils, really) 
that come from fish are quite good for you. But most animal fats available 
in your grocery store are rotten for your body’s systems; they often contain 
toxins because substances like antibiotics, hormones, and steroids are used 
on many commercially raised animals.

300
Part V: The Part of Tens 
To get the good types of fats into your diet, focus on vegetable fats (more 
commonly referred to as vegetable oils). The best varieties to use are coconut 
oil, flaxseed oil, olive oil, and hempseed oil. (Make sure you pick out 100 per-
cent organic oils if possible.)

Ten Ways to Tell That Your 
Detox Diet Is Working

▶ Smelling, feeling, and looking better
▶ Watching food allergies, blood pressure, and digestion improve
▶ Experiencing better moods and higher quality of life
S
ay you’ve made the decision to start on a detoxification diet. You get 
the necessary equipment; clean the processed and toxin-filled food from 
your fridge and pantry; replace it with wholesome, natural, organic food; and 
work hard to improve your eating habits. These steps aren’t easy to take, so 
if you complete them successfully, congratulations are in order!
But enough with the congratulations — how do you know when this diet is 
really working? How do you know when the healthy choices you’re making 
start to have a positive effect on your body?
That’s the topic I tackle in this chapter. Read on to get the scoop on ten won-
derful ways that you can tell your efforts to implement and stick to a detox 
diet are paying off and helping to create a healthier you.
You Lose Some Weight
When your body contains high levels of toxins, it relies on a natural process 
that isolates the toxic materials and tucks them away where they can’t do 
any harm to your important organs and tissues. That process involves toxins 
being absorbed and stored for long periods of time in fat cells. Many people 
don’t know it, but fat cells can be storehouses for toxins, particularly heavy 

302
Part V: The Part of Tens 
metals and chemical toxins. After toxins end up in fat cells, another natural 
process takes place. That process causes fat cells to grow and expand in an 
effort to dilute the toxins. Put these two processes together, and toxins can 
not only result in an abundance of fat cells but also a growth in the size of 
those fat cells.
 
So what happens to those fat cells when you embark on a detoxification diet? 
When you drastically cut down on the amount of toxins you take in with your 
food and water, and when you also make a concerted effort to eat the kinds of 
foods that boost your body’s efforts to rid itself of toxins, the result is an over-
all decrease in the amount of toxic materials present in your body. And when 
the toxin levels go down, your body no longer needs the multitude of growing 
fat cells necessary to sequester all those toxins, so your body begins to do 
away with them. This nifty sequence of events is one of the main reasons why 
detox dieting is such a great way to help you reach your ideal weight. (It also 
doesn’t hurt that detox diets focus on healthful, low-fat foods, which can only 
give you another step down the path of healthy weight management.)
You Don’t Get Sick as Often
With all the foreign substances that can end up in your body, it’s safe to say 
that your immune system, which your body relies on to fight infection and 
disease, has plenty to deal with. Even in the purest, cleanest environments, 
harmful materials end up in your bloodstream and in your body’s organs and 
tissues. When that happens, your immune system comes to the rescue. It’s an 
extremely complex and effective natural machine, and you want to keep it in 
the best possible condition so it can thwart the dangerous advances made by 
bacteria, parasites, viruses, and toxins.
The immune system is complex and kind of fragile. Its many unique parts 
must work together in order for you to enjoy maximum immunity, and these 
parts can be thrown out of whack or even destroyed if they’re exposed to 
certain materials, including toxins. In relatively low amounts, toxins can be a 
disruption to your immune system, and when toxic levels are high the effects 
can be devastating. Your body can quickly lose the ability to defend itself 
against foreign invaders.
You may not notice a huge effect on your immune system when you first start 
a detox diet, but after a while you may be pleasantly surprised by how resil-
ient you are against infections. You may dodge the bullet when the rest of 
the people in your office catch a nasty cold, for example. The reason is that a 
decreased toxic load takes away a major threat to your immune system, and 
all those wonderful, efficient parts of your body are able to work together to 
keep you healthy and feeling great.

303
 Chapter 20: Ten Ways to Tell That Your Detox Diet Is Working
Your Gas Doesn’t Smell as Bad
Okay, this one may catch you off guard. But it’s true! Sticking to a detox diet 
will go a long way toward preventing the creation of foul-smelling gas in your 
intestines. Allow me to explain.
When your intestines are at their healthiest, you have a balance of bacteria 
that features a normal amount of good, beneficial bacteria and only trace 
levels of bad bacteria. At their worst, the good bacteria don’t have any effect 
on you at all, and at their best they can help you digest certain foods that you 
wouldn’t be able to digest on your own. Bad bacteria, however, can do all 
sorts of nasty things to your body, including causing disease, robbing you of 
key nutrients, and even contributing to really bad-smelling gas.
How can you make sure your intestines contain the right amounts of good 
bacteria and very little amounts of bad bacteria? Go on a detox diet. Making 
wise food choices will help to create an environment in your intestines that 
helps good bacteria to succeed and makes it hard for harmful bacteria to get 
a foothold. And that will work wonders if you’re one of the many people who 
suffer from offensive, foul-smelling gas.
You Have More Energy
Want to put some pep in your step? Go on a detox diet. A noticeable (and 
extremely pleasant) increase in energy levels is one of the first things that my 
patients mention when they’ve been on a detoxification diet for a few weeks. 
Why does that happen? There are several reasons, but an important one is 
the ability of your thyroid gland to work as it’s supposed to. Your thyroid 
gland is responsible for regulating your metabolism, which is the root of your 
energy levels. The thyroid can be a fickle gland, and it’s prone to acting up 
when you have too many toxins — particularly mercury — in your blood-
stream and elsewhere in your body.
When your thyroid goes on the fritz, it can do lots of bizarre and unpleas-
ant things to your body, including wreaking havoc on the amount of energy 
you have. (Read all about that subject in Chapter 11.) If you want to enjoy 
healthy, comfortable amounts of energy — not too much, not too little — 
work toward detoxifying your body and put a detox diet at the very top of 
your priority list.

304
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Your Skin Looks and Feels Better
Sweating is one of the most effective and important methods for detoxifica-
tion. When your body is overrun with toxins and you sweat them out con-
stantly, your skin can really improve. Sweat is good for your skin and can 
make you look and feel very healthy. Sweating also increases the natural oils 
on the skin that keep the skin soft and moist.
Slashing the amount of toxins in your body using a detox diet helps to limit 
the toxins that you sweat out onto your skin. When you combine that effort 
with a careful skincare regimen and a commitment to drinking plenty of puri-
fied water, you’re bound to end up with softer, healthier skin.
 
You can also use a sauna to help sweat out the toxins that are already in your 
body — see Chapter 18 for details. Just be sure that you take a good, long 
shower after you’re done so toxins go down the drain and don’t stay on your 
skin.
Your Food Allergies Improve
If you’re one of the millions of people who suffer from food allergies, you 
know how annoying, frustrating, and even dangerous they can be. Some food 
allergies are relatively easy to deal with — it’s pretty easy to avoid eating 
oysters if you’re allergic to shellfish, for example. But others are a real pain. 
If you’re allergic to gluten (a common substance in many grains), you know 
exactly what I’m talking about.
If certain foods give you fits and you want to improve the situation, get 
started on a detox diet right away. Dodging toxins and eating foods that help 
to flush them from your body will help to prevent a condition called leaky gut 
syndrome that can contribute to the occurrence and severity of food allergies. 
Leaky gut syndrome occurs when toxins irritate and inflame your intestines, 
and as a result the intestines accidentally allow dangerous materials to pass 
through your intestinal wall into your bloodstream. Many people believe that 
leaky gut syndrome can play a big part in causing food allergies. If you can 
cut way down on your toxicity, you’ll keep your intestines healthy and make 
leaky gut syndrome much less of an issue.

 Chapter 20: Ten Ways to Tell That Your Detox Diet Is Working
Your Blood Pressure Decreases
One out of every four Americans suffers from hypertension, commonly known 
as high blood pressure. This condition contributes to stroke, heart attack, 
and kidney failure, among other problems, and the unhealthy diets and abun-
dance of toxins that are so prevalent in our world today are only making mat-
ters worse.
If you or someone you’re close to suffers from hypertension, I strongly sug-
gest a detoxification diet. It’s a little known fact that several toxins can have a 
harmful effect on your blood pressure. Lead is the worst of the bunch, and it 
also happens to be one of the most common toxins. Cut out those toxins and 
take an active approach to flushing them out of your body, and you’re almost 
certain to lower your blood pressure and help keep it down at a healthy, 
comfortable level.
Your Bowel Movements 
Are More Regular
People sometimes cringe when it comes time to talk about bowel movements, 
but the truth is that they’re an important part of your health and you need to 
pay attention to them. Regular, comfortable bowel movements are a sign that 
your digestive system is working as it should, and that should be a goal for 
everyone.
Toxins have a negative impact on your bowel movements. They can cause 
lots of intestinal problems from constipation to diarrhea and everything in 
between. The results can be malnutrition, dehydration, and increased toxic-
ity, just to name a few.
A detox diet greatly reduces the amount of toxins that enter your body, 
which helps improve the quality and regularity of your bowel movements. 
Also, a detox diet provides you with plenty of fiber and other food sub-
stances that contribute to healthy bowels and bowel function.

306
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Your Mental State Improves
Quite a bit of evidence suggests that detoxification and the avoidance of 
toxins can help your brain and the rest of your nervous system operate on a 
higher, healthier level. Of course, some folks also like to refute that idea.
You could spend half a lifetime sorting through the studies and research 
results trying to figure out the exact, quantitative effect of toxins on your 
neurological system and your mental health. Before you go off and do that, 
consider this: Nearly every patient I’ve ever helped to start and follow 
through with a detoxification diet has reported that his or her mental state 
has improved by leaps and bounds. Detox diets make people feel calmer and 
more at ease, and they also help people think more clearly and avoid the 
“brain fog” that makes it hard to excel at work and enjoy personal time.
You Live a Long, Healthy Life
Okay, okay, so this one takes a little bit more time for you to see the results. 
But if you make the commitment to maintain a detox diet for life — and don’t 
be mistaken, that’s the kind of timeline we’re talking about here — you’ll be 
less likely to suffer from the diseases that now afflict so many people as they 
age. These diseases include Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, multiple sclerosis, and 
many different forms of cancer. Going on a detox diet and following a detox 
protocol is probably the best chance you have to avoid facing these illnesses. 
And a detox lifestyle will positively affect every other aspect of your health in 
the meantime.

Ten Supplements to Take Daily
In This Chapter
▶ Getting sufficient vitamins
▶ Making sure minerals are on your list
▶ Adding other supplements to your regimen
T
he best way to get the important substances you need (vitamins, min-
erals, essential fatty acids, antioxidants — the list goes on and on) is 
through a balanced, wholesome, nutritional diet (one that is 100 percent 
organic whenever possible). But the fact is that many people have a very 
hard time eating enough of the right kinds of foods to get the substances they 
need in the correct quantities. That’s why I recommend that you strongly 
consider using supplements to increase the amounts of critical materials 
your body must have to perform at its very best.
This chapter gives you ten suggestions for supplements that you can take 
every day to improve your health. I know it may seem overwhelming to 
think about taking ten (or more) different supplements each day, but keep in 
mind that doing so can be a real benefit to both your body and mind. Plus, it 
may help you to live longer and healthier. That said, if you know that you’re 
getting a good amount of some of these substances in your diet and you’re 
interested in keeping the amount of supplements you’re taking relatively low, 
you can adjust your supplement regimen accordingly. For example, if you eat 
plenty of oily, cold-water fish, you may not need to supplement with omega-3 
fatty acids. Think about your diet, and supplement in an appropriate way to 
make certain you’re giving your body what it needs.
 
Here’s one very important note to keep in mind when you’re thinking about 
supplements: The daily recommended allowances for vitamins, minerals, and 
other substances that you see on food labels don’t mean a whole lot. These 
guidelines show you the minimum amounts necessary for your body to keep 
on keepin’ on, but they don’t tell you what amounts you need for your body to 
go above and beyond that base level.
One more thing: If you want advice on how to select supplements, flip back to 
Chapter 5.

Part V: The Part of Tens 
Multivitamin
A good, comprehensive multivitamin should be the foundation for your 
supplement regimen. Your body absolutely must have 14 vitamins in order 
to function properly, and chances are you don’t get all 14 in the amounts 
you need from your diet. It is possible to get all your vitamins from food, but 
you have to eat a diet that is much healthier than most people even aspire 
to. (You have to eat loads and loads of produce — mostly vegetables — and 
choose only 100 percent organic varieties.) For more information about all 
the vitamins you need, flip back to Chapter 17.
Some people take a once-a-day multivitamin. While that’s definitely better 
than taking nothing at all, the pill probably doesn’t include high enough 
doses of each of the vitamins you need. How do I know? If a once-a-day vita-
min contained adequately high doses of all 14 essential vitamins, it would 
have to be at least as big as a golf ball. Most of the multivitamins that offer 
comprehensive vitamin coverage require you to take several pills a day. Four 
capsules or pills a day is a pretty standard number.
A range of good brands and reasonably priced options is available. You want 
to find a company that does third-party analysis (see Chapter 5). Most of the 
better products are not sold over the counter and must be purchased through 
an integrative physician or a pharmacy that is involved in natural wellness.
 
Make sure the multivitamin you choose includes a good calcium source, and 
make sure that it comes as calcium hydroxyl apatite and not calcium carbon-
ate. You don’t necessarily have to understand the differences between the 
two; just make sure your multivitamin includes the former and not the latter.
Multimineral
In total, you need to supply your body with 16 different minerals if you want 
it to perform at an optimal level. I won’t list them here — check out Chapter 
17 for a rundown — but rest assured that getting anything less than all 16 
means a compromise for your health.
Multimineral supplements are easy to find, and in many cases you can find 
multivitamin/multimineral combination supplements. These options can be 
tricky, and you need to make sure that if you choose to go that route you buy 
an option that includes all 14 vitamins and all 16 minerals. (That’s quite a lot!)
When you’re picking out a multimineral supplement, go with one that con-
tains chelated minerals. I’ll spare you all the boring details of the process that 
creates chelated minerals. But keep in mind that unless you’re getting che-
lated minerals, you’re probably paying for minerals that end up in your toilet 
instead of in your body’s important systems.

309
 Chapter 21: Ten Supplements to Take Daily
 
Don’t take a multimineral supplement that comes from a clay source. These 
products are not chelated, and they contain silver, tin, and nickel. In some 
cases they even list lead as an ingredient!
Omega-3 Fatty Acids
You’ve probably heard or read about omega-3 fatty acids in the news 
recently. The importance of this essential fatty acid has been getting a lot of 
press, and for good reason. It’s one of those substances that your body has 
to have to survive and thrive, and despite all the wonderfully complex chemi-
cal processes your body can do, it can’t manufacture omega-3 fatty acids.
The best dietary source of omega-3s is organic beef. Fish is the next best 
source. You should eat fish as part of a healthy diet, but unless you’re eating 
wild Alaskan salmon or one of the other few types of fish that don’t com-
monly contain high levels of mercury, chances are you’re getting a very 
unhealthy dose of toxins along with your omega-3 fatty acids.
To steer clear of mercury but still get your omega-3s, supplement with liquid 
fish oil or a capsule or softgel. Take one gram twice a day to get what you 
need.
Resveratrol
Resveratrol is a powerful antioxidant, and I recommend that everyone get a 
dose of it each day. Resveratrol has developed a much higher profile since 
a Harvard Medical School study a few years ago showed a pretty dramatic 
increase in the health and lifespan of mice when they were given resvera-
trol in addition to their diets. If you read up on this antioxidant, you’ll prob-
ably see that it is present in red wine, and that’s the truth. (It’s also present 
in grape skins.) But if you wanted to get a significant dose of resveratrol 
from red wine alone, you’d have to glug a few hundred bottles of the stuff 
per day, and that would kill you long before you got to enjoy any benefits of 
resveratrol.
The good news is that you can buy resveratrol supplements at many health 
food stores and at any good vitamin retailer, either in person or online. You’ll 
see it listed either as resveratrol or red wine extract. I recommend getting 30 
milligrams per day, which should be rather easy given the breadth of supple-
ment options on the market.

310
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Vitamin C
If you take a good multivitamin, you’re probably getting a good amount of 
vitamin C each day. But don’t think for a second that you’re getting all that 
your body needs to really be able to operate on a high level.
I recommend taking a 1,000-milligram vitamin C supplement twice each day. 
I know that sounds like a lot, but if you’ve read much of this book, you know 
that I believe very firmly that vitamin C is a huge boon for your good health. 
Even though it’s present in lots of fruits and vegetables, it can still be diffi-
cult to get enough of the stuff in your diet. Hundreds (perhaps thousands) of 
vitamin C supplement options are available, so do some research and talk to 
your integrative doctor to find out which ones are right for you.
 
When you’re fighting an illness, take 8,000 milligrams of vitamin C each day 
instead of the usual 2,000 milligrams.
Vitamin B Complex
The term vitamin B complex refers to all the B vitamins: B1, B2, B3, B5, 
B6, B7, B9, and B12. Several of the B vitamins have other commonly used 
names — riboflavin and niacin are two good examples — and you can read all 
about those names, as well as my dosage recommendations, in Chapter 17.
The range of important functions that the vitamin B complex plays in your 
body is staggering, and I wouldn’t even attempt to cover all the details here. 
Just know that if you want to be healthy and live a long, comfortable life, 
you’d better plan on getting plenty of B vitamins.
I think it’s a good idea to take a vitamin B complex supplement in addition to 
your multivitamin every day. You can find such a supplement that will give 
you what you need in only one dose per day. Check out Chapter 17 to get 
my recommendations on how much of each of the B complex vitamins to get 
every day.
Magnesium
Several solid studies done over the course of the last few years have shown 
very strong connections between high levels of magnesium intake and the 
avoidance of cardiovascular illness. People who get plenty of magnesium — 
in their diets and through supplementing — commonly have a lower heart 
disease risk.

311
 Chapter 21: Ten Supplements to Take Daily
In addition, magnesium is involved in about 300 different biochemical reac-
tions that take place in your body, so you can see why it’s a good idea to 
make sure you’re getting enough of it. To be certain, take a supplement that 
gives you 600 milligrams per day.
Sulforaphane
Not everyone has heard of sulforaphane, and that’s too bad. It’s been making 
headlines on a pretty regular basis lately, and I hope that continues, because 
I think everyone should be taking it as a supplement regularly.
Recent studies have indicated that sulforaphane helps to thwart some kinds 
of cancer and can slow tumor development. Other studies show that sulfora-
phane reduces the amount of H. pylori bacteria in the stomach, and that bac-
terium causes stomach lining inflammation and ulcers. If those aren’t good 
reasons to take sulforaphane each day, I don’t know what are.
You can get sulforaphane in supplement form in two ways: broccoli seed 
extract or straight sulforaphane. If you go with the latter, shoot for 500 mil-
ligrams per day. If the former is your preferred sulforaphane supplement, try 
to get 30 milligrams every day.
Vitamin E
Like vitamin C and the vitamin B complex, vitamin E is something that will 
almost certainly be included in your multivitamin regimen but probably not 
in high enough amounts. You can see continuing health benefits of supple-
menting with vitamin E up to 800 milligrams per day, so don’t be afraid to get 
that much.
What are some of the health benefits of taking additional vitamin E? First, 
vitamin E has powerful antioxidant effects, and if you check out Chapter 5 
you’ll know how important antioxidants are to your total health. But vitamin 
E does all sorts of other good things for your body as well, from boosting 
your immune system to keeping your blood vessels in tip-top shape.
Do yourself a huge favor, and don’t scrimp on the vitamin E.

312
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Alpha-lipoic Acid (ALA)
You’ll often see alpha-lipoic acid referred to as ALA. It’s a top-notch antioxi-
dant that helps your body fight disease and keeps your various cells function-
ing at a high level.
I always suggest to my patients that they take an ALA supplement, and I rec-
ommend finding a capsule form that provides about 800 milligrams per day. 
That number has been shown to offer many health benefits without being 
overwhelming or wasteful in the body. You can find ALA supplements at any 
good health food store and at your local vitamin retailer.

Ten Common Detoxification 
Pitfalls
In This Chapter
▶ Continuing to eat harmful foods
▶ Failing to change your eating habits
▶ Depriving your body of exercise and sweat
▶ Ignoring your body’s supplement and water needs
You know what they say about the best-laid plans, don’t you? 
Unfortunately, that old chestnut extends to the best-laid detoxification 
plans. Even if you’re completely sold on the idea that you need to correct 
your current dietary blunders with a healthy detox diet and take additional 
steps to detoxify your body, you have plenty of chances to slip up on the 
road to your new, improved, detoxified life.
I’ve been helping patients with their detoxification efforts for decades, and by 
now I know where many of them go wrong. From these many, many years of 
hindsight, I offer the material in this chapter, which clues you in on ten of the 
most common ways that your detox endeavors can go astray. These pitfalls 
pertain to both detox dieting and general detoxification.
I want you to succeed in your quest to rid your body of toxins and keep them 
out, so I don’t pull any punches here. My hope is that if you can see potential 
pitfalls coming, you’ll be more likely to sail smoothly past them on your way 
to a longer, healthier, detoxified life.
Keeping Unhealthy Food in the House
When you start out on any detoxification endeavor, particularly a detox diet, 
one of the very first steps you should take is to clear out all the toxin-laden, 
processed, and generally unhealthy food from your kitchen. You can read all 
about the kinds of food you should avoid in Chapters 3 and 6 of this book. 

314
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Don’t hang on to any of it — clear out the cabinets, the pantry, the fridge, and 
the freezer. (And don’t forget your secret stash of cookies or snack cakes!) 
If you have unhealthy food in your home, it will continually tempt you. 
Eventually, you’ll probably end up caving to that temptation, so it’s always 
best to clear out the bad foods from the get-go.
When the unhealthy and toxic foods are out of your home, restock your 
kitchen with wholesome, healthy foods like the ones I describe in Chapter 7. 
The change may seem like a bit of a shock at first, but before long you won’t 
miss all the nasty and unhealthy foods you used to eat because you’ll feel so 
good from eating nutritious, toxin-free foods.
Not Reading Labels
Want to avoid eating and drinking toxins? If so, you have to abide by this 
extremely important (yet wonderfully simple) rule: Always read labels. You 
can’t really know what’s in the food you eat and the beverages you drink 
unless you read the labels, particularly the ingredients lists. If you take the 
time to examine a label, you’ll know right away if a food or drink contains 
toxic or otherwise questionable ingredients, and you’ll know to steer clear of 
it and opt for a toxin-free alternative.
If you’ve tried to really examine and analyze food labels in the past but 
you’ve been caught up in all the jargon and confusing information, check out 
Chapter 3. In that chapter, I give you the full rundown on how you can be 
smart about labels in order to keep toxin-filled foods away from you and your 
family. For now, let me quickly clue you in on the three things you should 
always do when you’re evaluating a label:
 
✓ Don’t buy a food that has ingredients you’ve never heard of or can’t pro-
nounce.
 
✓ Pay special attention to the order in which ingredients are listed on the 
label. They’re supposed to be listed in decreasing order of amounts 
included.
 
✓ Keep an eye out for different variations of the same toxin.
 
What’s not included on a label can be just as important as what is clearly 
listed. For example, if you’re shopping for organic food and you don’t see 
“100% organic” on the label, you know there’s always a chance that the food 
contains or was produced using some sort of toxic materials.

315
 Chapter 22: Ten Common Detoxification Pitfalls
Eating Out
If I told you that every restaurant or eatery out there served food that con-
tained toxins, I’d be lying. A handful of restaurants pride themselves on pro-
viding natural, organic, wholesome food, and if you’re lucky enough to live 
in an area where one of these establishments is located, I fully support you 
going there to eat.
That said, the vast majority of restaurants don’t have much of a commit-
ment to serving up toxin-free food. If you make a plan to eat out, you’re likely 
making a plan to have a side of toxins with your meal. The people running 
these restaurants aren’t bad; they usually are just not focused on what foods 
and additives are toxic.
 
You can have nearly total control of the quality and toxicity of the food you 
eat in only one place, and that’s at home. Prepare your own food whenever 
you can. If you find yourself in a situation where you know you won’t be able 
to make your food and eat at home, either pack some food from your kitchen 
or do plenty of research ahead of time to discover nearby restaurants that can 
accommodate your desire to eat healthy and toxin-free.
Eating Too Fast and Not Chewing Enough
So many people act like they’re in a competitive eating match when they have 
a meal. Don’t be one of them! If you shovel down your food and don’t take 
the time to chew it properly, you’re putting your digestive system at a huge 
disadvantage. Leisurely eating, with lots and lots of chewing, is an extremely 
important first step in any healthy digestive process (see Chapter 9).
When you eat slowly and chew your food thoroughly, you break everything 
down into a nice food slurpy, which is just perfect for your stomach. Doing so 
allows your stomach to carry out its critical functions and prepare your food 
for the intestines, which is really where the digestive magic happens.
 
If you swallow your food before you’ve chewed it into a semi-liquid and 
soaked it thoroughly with your saliva, you get the delicate digestive dance 
off on the wrong foot. The results can range from poor nutrient absorption to 
increased toxicity.

316
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Washing Food Down with Drinks
This one always surprises my patients, so don’t feel like you’re alone if my 
advice catches you off guard. Ready? Don’t drink liquids when you eat a 
meal. Sound crazy? It’s actually the healthiest way to eat. Let me explain why.
When you drink beverages while eating a meal, you dilute two important 
digestive liquids: your saliva and your stomach acid. Watering down your 
saliva compromises its ability to start breaking down your food, and it makes 
the food you swallow less slick and more likely to irritate your esophagus. 
Diluting your stomach acid is even worse. Your stomach acid is a marvel of 
nature; it’s so powerful that it can destroy many toxins — especially biologic 
toxins like bacteria, viruses, and parasites. When you drink a lot of liquids 
with your food, your stomach acid is diluted, which makes it a lot more dif-
ficult for the acid to penetrate your food and get to all the toxins that may be 
lurking in it. You need your stomach acid to be robust in terms of quantity 
and acidity, and having a beverage with your meal is a real hindrance to both.
 
Want to make sure your saliva and stomach acid are able to work at the high-
est possible level? Don’t drink liquids when you’re eating. Wait at least one 
hour after a meal, and then feel free to have a big, refreshing glass of clean, 
purified water.
Not Doing an Annual Bowel Cleanse
In Chapter 4 I write extensively about all the amazing things your bowels do 
to absorb what your body needs and keep out the toxins and other materials 
that can be a serious drag on your body’s many complex systems. The last 
time I checked, bowels weren’t included on any list of the world’s natural 
wonders, but I think it’s time we reevaluate that omission.
Your bowels are wonderfully effective, but in the toxic environment in which 
we live today, you need to do everything you can to keep your bowels in 
healthy working order. That includes getting a bowel cleanse once each year. 
The bowel cleanse process helps to ensure that your bowels aren’t being 
negatively affected by a range of toxins. It also helps to make sure that your 
bowels are able to operate as they should, which in turn helps many aspects 
of your health from your weight to your immune function.
A bowel cleanse is really a relatively simple process, and it’s one that people 
used to go through all the time just a few decades ago. To get a rounded view 
of the available bowel cleansing techniques, check out Chapter 5.

Not Exercising 30 Minutes per Day
Our bodies are built for activity, and it’s always a shame to me when people 
don’t realize and embrace that fact. No matter your age or physical condi-
tion, regular exercise is a key way that you can keep your body functioning as 
it’s supposed to. If you don’t exercise, you’re simply asking for trouble.
I’m not talking about running a marathon or bench-pressing 300 pounds here. 
For most adults, just 30 minutes per day of vigorous exercise — enough to 
get you up near your target heart rate — can make a tremendously positive 
impact on your overall health. Yet many people don’t do it, and as a result 
we’re more overweight and prone to diseases than ever before.
Besides the well-known and well-documented reasons to exercise, here are 
two other important benefits that you stand to enjoy if you can commit to 
engaging in physical activity for just a half hour every day:
 
✓ Better sleep: Study after study has proven that exercising during the 
day — particularly in the morning — helps to regulate your sleep cycle 
and make your body ready to shut down for sleep when bedtime rolls 
around. With so many people living extremely busy lives these days, 
who can afford not to get quality sleep?
 
✓ Detoxification through sweating: A good 30-minute exercise session 
will get you sweating, and sweating is one of the most effective ways 
to detoxify your body. You can excrete all manner of toxins with your 
sweat, from chemicals to heavy metals. Just be sure you take a good 
shower when you’re done exercising so those toxins don’t sit around on 
and irritate your skin.
Not Sweating Enough
Working up a good sweat is a fantastic way to get toxins out of your system. 
Your sweat glands are great at removing toxic materials from your body, and 
you should take advantage of their talents.
Not long ago — back before air conditioning and before people started set-
tling into sedentary lifestyles — just about everyone on earth spent a good 
portion of the year sweating quite a bit every day. Unless you live in a very 
cold area, you can imagine what it would be like in the heat of summer if air 
conditioning weren’t widely available. In those days, people were detoxifying 
their bodies all the time. But fast forward to the present day, when people 
don’t sweat nearly as much and the toxic load in our environment has been 
greatly increased. We need to sweat more than ever before.

318
Part V: The Part of Tens 
You should strive to sweat often in the interest of aiding your body’s natural 
detoxification processes. Here are three ways you can do just that:
 
✓ Exercise regularly. I cover this topic in the previous section.
 
✓ Spend time in a sauna. This is a great way to work up a sweat, and I 
recommend it for anyone who is in good physical condition. Three types 
of sauna are available: wet, dry, and infrared. For details, have a look at 
Chapter 18.
 
 Consult your doctor before beginning to use a sauna. People who suffer 
from blood pressure problems, cardiovascular disease, or epilepsy 
should not use saunas. Pregnant women should also avoid saunas.
 
✓ Drink plenty of water. Your body can sweat effectively only if you’re 
very well hydrated. To make sure you’re getting the most out of your 
sweat, drink plenty of purified water. (Have a look at Chapter 3 for infor-
mation on how to ensure your water is clean and toxin free.)
Not Supplementing
Unless you eat a completely healthy, 100 percent organic diet that is made 
up of huge amounts of fresh vegetables, you’re more than likely not getting 
all the critical nutrients and other materials your body needs to perform at 
its very best. I encourage you to strive for the best diet you can achieve, but 
if your diet isn’t perfect, you can always add to the vitamins, minerals, essen-
tial fatty acids, essential amino acids, and other key substances you need 
through supplementing.
I talk a lot about supplementing in this book, and I really do recommend it 
for just about everyone. Some people question the effectiveness of supple-
ments, but I’ve always found them to be an extremely useful way to augment 
a healthy diet for both me and my patients.
Some people choose not to supplement because they think doing so will be 
too much of a hassle, or they think it’ll be expensive, or they don’t really 
know which supplement choices to make when they’re faced with an intimi-
dating (and enormous) wall of options at their health food or vitamin store. 
But supplementing can be easy, cost-effective, and confusion free if you know 
how to go about it, and I’m happy to help you figure out the ins and outs. 
Start with my explanation on how to pick out supplements in Chapter 5, and 
then consider my list of recommended supplements in Chapter 21.

 Chapter 22: Ten Common Detoxification Pitfalls
Drinking Inadequate Amounts of Water
As far as we know, there’s one substance that all life requires: liquid water. 
Your body needs it, in the truest sense of the word “need.” Therefore, you 
should drink plenty of water every day — not just when it’s hot out, or when 
you’re exercising, or when you’ve recently eaten a lot of salty food. (You 
shouldn’t be doing that last one anyway, of course.) Drink water steadily 
throughout the day, and you’ll not only keep your body healthy on a general 
level, but you’ll assist your body in its quest to rid itself of toxins.
When you’re well hydrated, your lymph system — a sort of secondary circu-
latory system that excels at flushing toxins out of your cells and tissues — is 
at its best. Your digestive system is also on top of its game when there’s 
plenty of water to go around, and you don’t have to read too many pages of 
this book to realize how important your digestive system is in getting the 
right materials in your body and keeping the wrong materials (toxins) out.
A good general rule is to drink enough water to keep your urine clear. At 
the same time, beware of toxin-emitting plastic water bottles. Flip back to 
Chapter 3 for ways to make sure the water you drink is pure and toxin-free.
