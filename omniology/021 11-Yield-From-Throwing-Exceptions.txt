Throwing Exceptions
We can throw exceptions into a generator using the throw() method
à works with delegation as well
def delegator():
yield from subgen()
def subgen():
…
yield
…
d = delegator()
d.throw(Exc)
Subgenerator can then handle exception (or not)
Delegator does not intercept the exception
à just forwards it to subgenerator
