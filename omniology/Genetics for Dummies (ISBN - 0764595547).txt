About the Author
Tara Rodden Robinson, R.N., B.S.N., Ph.D., is a native of Monroe, Louisiana,
where she graduated from Ouachita Parish High School. She earned her
degree in nursing at the University of Southern Mississippi and worked as a
registered nurse for nearly six years (mostly in surgery), before running away
from home to study birds in the Costa Rican rainforest. From the rainforests,
Tara traveled to the cornfields of the Midwest to earn her Ph.D. in Biology at
the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. Her dissertation work was con-
ducted in the Republic of Panama where she examined the social lives of
Song Wrens. She got her post-doctoral training in genetics with Dr. Colin
Hughes (University of Miami) and through a Postdoctoral Fellowship at
Auburn University. Dr. Robinson received a teaching award for her genetics
course at Auburn and was twice included in Who’s Who Among America’s
Teachers (2002 and 2005).
Now, as assistant research professor in the Department of Fisheries and
Wildlife at Oregon State University, Tara studies the genetics of birds and fish
at Hatfield Marine Science Center in Newport, Oregon. Professor Robinson’s
research includes conducting paternity analysis to uncover the mysteries of
birds’ social lives, examining population genetics of endangered salmon, and
using DNA to find out which species of salmon sea-going birds like to eat.
Professor Robinson conducts research on birds in locations all over the map
including Oregon, Michigan, and the Republic of Panama. Her field research
includes comparisons of the evolution of tropical and temperate birds, exam-
ining the effects of urbanization on swallows and bluebirds, describing the
mating habits of Northern Mockingbirds, and documenting the effects of
forest fragmentation on tropical bird populations. Recently, she and her hus-
band, ornithologist W. Douglas Robinson, traveled to the island of Yap to
survey birds and bats after a devastating typhoon wrecked the forests of that
tiny, unique Micronesian state.
When not traveling, Professor Robinson enjoys playing Celtic and Scottish
tunes on her fiddle and hiking the Coast Range of Oregon with her husband
and their dog, Natchez.


Dedication
To my parents, Bill and Sammie Rodden.
And Douglas: You are my Vitamin D.
Author’s Acknowledgments
I extend thanks to my wonderful editors at Wiley: Stacy Kennedy, Elizabeth
Rea, and especially Mike Baker. Many other people at Wiley worked hard to
make this book a reality; special thanks go to Melisa Duffy, Lindsay
MacGregor, Abbie Enneking, Grace Davis, and David Hobson.
I appreciate the help of Doug P. Lyle, M.D., Walter D. Smith, Benoit Leclair,
Maddy Delone and Jen Dolan of the Innocence Project, and Jorge Berreno at
Applied Biosystems, Inc. I thank Paul Farber (Oregon State University), Iris
Sandler (University of Washington), Robert J. Robbins (Fred Hutchinson
Cancer Research Center), and Garland E. Allen (Washington University) for
answering my queries about genetics history. Electronic Scholarly Publishing
provided access to historically important genetics papers on the Web.
Many people provided support during the preparation of the manuscript: Jill
Lee loosened my muscles, John and all the good people at Sunnyside Up sup-
plied caffeine, and Bill Rodden read chapters. I acknowledge the support of
the faculty, staff, and students of the Department of Fisheries and Wildlife,
Oregon State University. Julia Whittington, DVM, of University of Illinois
Urbana-Champaign School of Veterinary Medicine answered my questions
about the reproductive physiology of cats and dogs. Oris Acevedo; the
Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute; and the scientists of Barro Colorado
Island, particularly Rachel Page and Egbert Leigh, provided congenial com-
pany and office space in Panama. My colleagues Michael Banks, Martin
Wikelski, Bob Ricklefs, and Phil Rossignol provided constant encouragement.
I also want to thank my postdoctoral mentor, Colin Hughes (now of Florida
Atlantic University). I send a hearty “War Eagle!” to my friends, former stu-
dents, and colleagues from Auburn University, especially Mike & Marie
Wooten, Sharon Roberts, and Shreekumar Pulai.
My deepest gratitude goes to my husband, Douglas, who patiently endured
all the throes of writing and bouts of insomnia while unfailingly providing
love, support, and “Vitamin D.” I’m grateful to all our students at OSU, espe-
cially Suzanne Austin-Bythell. Our friends, Elsie and Elzy Eltzroth, Linda
Audrain, and Craig Skinner cheered me on, and Shari Ame provided musical
distraction. Finally, I thank my mom and dad for love, support, prayers, and
gumbo.

Introduction
G
enetics affects every aspect of life on earth. As a science, it’s one of the
fastest growing fields because it has untold potential — for good and for
ill. Although complicated and diverse, all genetics comes down to basic prin-
ciples of heredity and how DNA is put together. So it turns out that genetics,
in many ways, is surprisingly accessible. Genetics is a bit like taking a peek
behind a movie’s special effects to find a deceptively simple and elegant
system running the whole show.
I may sound like a geek, but genetics is my favorite subject. If you’d told me
I’d end up feeling this way when I took my first genetics course, I would have
laughed. At first, I hated genetics (and I barely passed!). But as I learned more,
I was hooked. Now, my career follows the genetics of birds in hopes of helping
to conserve the natural beauty that makes our world such a wonderful place
to be. In the pages to come, I hope that I communicate my genuine enthusi-
asm for this fascinating subject so that you, too, can appreciate the marvels
of this complex science.
About This Book
Genetics For Dummies is an overview of the entire field of genetics. My goal is
to explain each topic in such a way that anyone, even someone without any
genetics background at all, can follow the subject and understand how it
works. In an effort to make the book as current as possible, I’ve included
many examples from the frontiers of research. I’ve also made sure that the
book has detailed coverage of some of the hottest topics that you hear about
in the news: cloning, gene therapy, and forensics. Most genetics texts don’t
cover these subjects in depth, if at all. I’ve also addressed the practical side
of genetics: how it affects your health and the world around you. In short,
this book is designed to be a solid introduction to genetics basics as well as
to provide some details on the subject.
Genetics is a fast-paced field; new discoveries are published every week. You
can use this book to help you get through your genetics course, or you can
use it simply for self-guided study. Genetics For Dummies gives you enough
information to get a handle on the latest press coverage, understand the
genetics jargon that crime writers like to toss around, and translate informa-
tion imparted to you by medical professionals. I’ve filled the book with stories
of key discoveries and “wow” developments. I’ve tried to keep things light and
inject some humor when possible, but, at the same time, I’ve made an effort
to be sensitive to whatever your circumstances may be.

This book is a great guide if you know nothing at all about genetics. If you
already have some background, then you’re set to dive into the details of the
subject and expand your horizons.
Conventions Used in This Book
I’m a real live, working scientist. It would be very easy for me to use scientific
language that you’d need a translator to understand. But what fun would that
be? Throughout this book, I’ve avoided jargon as much as possible, but at the
same time, I use and carefully define terms that geneticists actually use. After
all, it may be important for you to understand some of these multisyllabic
jawbreakers in the course of your studies or your, or a loved one’s, medical
treatment.
To help you navigate through this book, I also use the following typographi-
cal conventions:
 Italic is used for emphasis and to highlight new words or terms that are
defined in the text.
 Boldface is used to indicate keywords in bulleted lists or the action
parts of numbered steps.
 Monofont is used for Web addresses.
 Sidebars are shaded gray boxes that contain text that’s interesting to
know but not necessarily critical to your understanding of the chapter
or section topic.
What You’re Not to Read
Anytime you see a Technical Stuff icon (see “Icons Used in This Book” later in
this Introduction), you can cruise past the information it’s attached to without
missing a key explanation. For the serious reader, the technical bits add some
depth and detail to the book. You also have permission to skip the shaded gray
boxes known as sidebars — if you really want to. Doing so doesn’t affect your
understanding of the subject at hand. But you should know that I’ve stuck a lot
of really cool stuff in these boxes — things like extracting DNA from an ancient
human buried in a glacier and tracing Thomas Jefferson’s family tree — so
I’m guessing they’ll grab your attention more often than not.

Genetics For Dummies 

Foolish Assumptions
I’m honored to be your guide into the complex world of genetics. Given this
responsibility, I thought about you a lot while writing this book. Here’s how
I’ve imagined you, my reader:
 You’re a student in a basic genetics or biology class.
 You’re simply curious to understand more about the science you hear
reported in the news.
 You’re an expectant or new parent or a family member who’s deeply con-
cerned about a precious child and struggling to come to terms with what
doctors have told you.
 You’re dealing with cancer or some hereditary disease, wondering what
it means for you and your family.
If any of these descriptions strikes a chord, you’ve come to the right place.
How This Book Is Organized
I designed this book to cover background material in the first two parts and
then all the applications in the rest of the book. I think you’ll find it quite
accessible.
Part I: Genetics Basics
This section explains how trait inheritance works. The first chapter gives you
a handle on how genetic information gets divvied up during cell division; these
events provide the foundation for just about everything else that has to do
with genetics. From there, I explain simple inheritance of one trait and then
move on to more complex forms of inheritance. This part ends with an expla-
nation of how sex works — that is, how genetics determines maleness or
femaleness and how your sex affects how your genes work. (There’s another
For Dummies book, written by one Dr. Ruth, that you can check out if you’re
wondering how sex really works.)

Introduction

Part II: DNA: The Genetic Material
This part covers what’s sometimes called molecular genetics. But don’t let
that term scare you off. It’s the nitty-gritty details, but I break it all down so
that you can follow right along. I track the progress of how your genes work
from start to finish here: how your DNA is put together, how it gets copied,
and how the building plans for your body are encoded in the double helix.
Part III: Genetics and Your Health
Part III is intended to help you see how genetics affects your health and 
well-being. To help you understand how scientists uncover the secrets
stored in your DNA, I cover how DNA is sequenced. In the process, I relate
the fascinating story behind the Human Genome Project. I cover the subjects
of genetic counseling, inherited diseases, genetics and cancer, and chromo-
some disorders, such as Down syndrome. I also include a chapter on gene
therapy, a practice that may hold the key to cures or treatments for many
of the disorders described in this part of the book.
Part IV: Genetics and Your World
This part of the book explains the broader impacts of genetics and covers
some hot topics that are often in the news. I explain how technologies work
and highlight both the possibilities and the perils of each. I delve into popula-
tion genetics (of both humans, both past and present, and endangered animal
species), DNA and forensics, genetically modified plants and animals, cloning,
and the issue of ethics, which is raised on a daily basis as scientists push the
boundaries of the possible with cutting-edge technology.
Part V: The Part of Tens
In Part V, you get my lists of ten milestone events and important people who
have shaped genetics history, ten of the next big things in the field, and more
than ten Web sites (I couldn’t leave any out!) that can provide you with more
details on the interesting issues you find elsewhere in the book.

Icons Used in This Book
All For Dummies books use icons to help readers keep track of what’s what.
Here’s a rundown of the icons used in this book and what they all mean.
I use this icon to flag information that’s critical to your understanding or par-
ticularly important to keep in mind.
This icon alerts you to points in the text where I provide added insight on how
to better get a handle on a concept. I draw on my teaching experience for these
tips and alert you to other sources of information you can check out.
These details are useful but not necessary to know. If you’re not a student,
these sections may be especially skippable for you.
This icon points out stories about the people behind the science and
accounts of how discoveries came about.
This fine piece of art alerts you to recent applications of genetics in the field
or in the lab.
Where to Go from Here
With Genetics For Dummies, you can start anywhere, on any chapter, and get
a handle on what you’re interested in right away. I made liberal use of cross-
references all over the book to help you get background details that you may
have skipped earlier. The table of contents and index can point you to specific
topics in a hurry, or you can just start at the beginning and work your way
straight through. If you read the book from front to back, you’ll get a short
course in genetics in the style and order it’s often taught in colleges and 
universities — Mendel first and DNA second.

Genetics For Dummies 

Part I
Genetics Basics

In this part . . .
G
enetics, first and foremost, is concerned with how
traits are inherited. The processes of cell division
are at the root of how chromosomes get doled out to off-
spring. When genes are passed on, some are assertive and
dominant while others are shy and recessive. The study of
how different traits are inherited and expressed is called
Mendelian genetics.
Genetics also determines your sex (as in maleness or
femaleness), and your sex influences how certain traits
are expressed. In this part, I explain what genetics is and
what it’s used for, how cells divide, and the basics of how
traits are passed from parents to offspring.

W
elcome to the complex and fascinating world of genetics. Genetics is
all about physical traits and the code carefully hidden away in DNA
that supplies the building plans for any organism. This chapter explains what
the field of genetics is, and what geneticists do. You get an introduction to
the big picture and a glimpse at some of the details found in other chapters
of this book.
What Is Genetics?
Genetics is the field of science that examines how traits are passed from one
generation to the next. Simply put, genetics affects everything about every
living thing on earth. An organism’s genes, snippets of DNA that are the fun-
damental units of heredity, control how it looks, behaves, and reproduces.
Because all biology depends on genes, it’s critical to understand genetics as
a foundation for all the other sciences, including agriculture and medicine.
From a historical point of view, genetics is a young science. The principles
that govern inheritance of traits by one generation from another were
described (and promptly lost) less than 150 years ago. Around the turn of
the 20th century, the laws of inheritance were rediscovered, an event that
transformed biology forever. But even then, the importance of the star of the
genetics show, DNA, wasn’t really understood until the 1950s. Now, technol-
ogy is helping geneticists push the envelope of knowledge every day.

Genetics is generally divided into four major subdivisions:
 Classical genetics: Describes how traits (physical characteristics) are
passed along from one generation to another.
 Molecular genetics: The study of the chemical and physical structures
of DNA, its cousin RNA, and proteins.
 Population genetics: Takes Mendelian genetics (that is, the genetics of
individual families) and ramps it up to look at the genetic makeup of
larger groups.
 Quantitative genetics: A highly mathematical field that examines the
statistical relationships between genes and the traits they encode.
In the academic world, many genetics courses begin with classical genetics and
proceed through molecular genetics, with a nod to populations or quantitative
genetics. This book follows the same path because each division of knowledge
builds on the one before it. That said, it’s perfectly okay and easy to jump
around between disciplines (in my own career, I started in molecular genet-
ics, then went classical, and finally ended up in populations).
Classical genetics: Transmitting traits
from generation to generation
Classical genetics is old school — the original form of genetics and, in many
ways, still the best. At its heart, classical genetics is the genetics of individuals
and their families. It focuses mostly on studying physical traits as a stand-in
for the genes that control appearance, or phenotype.
Gregor Mendel, a humble monk and part-time scientist, founded the entire
discipline of genetics, although he didn’t know it. Mendel was a gardener with
an unstoppable curiosity to go with his green thumb. His observations may
have been simple, but his conclusions were jaw-droppingly elegant. This man
had no access to technology, no computers, and no pocket calculator, yet he
determined, with keen accuracy, exactly how inheritance works.
Classical genetics is sometimes referred to as:
 Mendelian genetics: You start a new scientific discipline, you get it
named after you. Seems fair.
 Transmission genetics: This term refers to the fact that classical genetics
describes how traits are passed on, or transmitted, by parent organisms
to their offspring.
10
Part I: Genetics Basics 

No matter what you call it, classical genetics includes the study of cells and chro-
mosomes (which I delve into in Chapter 2). Cell division is the machine that runs
inheritance. But you don’t have to understand combustion engines to drive a
car, right? Likewise, you can dive straight into simple inheritance (see Chapter 3)
and work up to more complicated forms of inheritance (in Chapter 4) without
knowing anything whatsoever about cell division. (Mendel didn’t know anything
about chromosomes and cells when he figured this whole thing out, by the way.)
The genetics of sex and reproduction are also part of classical genetics. Sex, as
in maleness and femaleness, is determined by various combinations of genes
and chromosomes (strands of DNA). But the subject of sex gets even more
complicated (and interesting): The environment plays a role in determining
the sex of some organisms (like crocodiles and turtles), and other organisms
can even change sex with a change of address. If I’ve piqued your interest,
you can find out all the slightly kinky details in Chapter 5.
Classical genetics provides the framework for many subdisciplines. Genetic
counseling (covered in Chapter 12) depends heavily on understanding pat-
terns of inheritance to interpret people’s medical histories from a genetics
perspective. The study of chromosome disorders such as Down syndrome
(see Chapter 15) relies on cell biology and an understanding of what happens
during cell division. Forensics (see Chapter 18) also uses Mendelian genetics
to determine paternity and work out who’s who with DNA fingerprinting.
Molecular genetics: The chemistry of genes
Classical genetics concentrates on studying outward appearances, but
the study of actual genes falls under the heady title of molecular genetics.
The area of operations for molecular genetics includes all the machinery that
runs cells and manufactures the structures called for by the plans found in
genes. The focus of molecular genetics includes the physical and chemical
structures of the double helix, DNA, which I break down in all its glory in
Chapter 6. The messages hidden in your DNA (your genes) constitute the
building instructions for your appearance and everything else about you —
from how your muscles function and how your eyes blink to your blood type,
your susceptibility to particular diseases, and everything in between.
Your genes are expressed through a complex system of interactions that
begins with copying DNA’s messages into a somewhat temporary form called
RNA (see Chapter 8). RNA carries the DNA message through the process of
translation (covered in Chapter 9), which, in essence, is like taking a blue-
print to a factory to guide the manufacturing process. Where your genes are
concerned, the factory makes the proteins (from the RNA blueprint) that get
folded in complex ways to make you.
11
Chapter 1: What Genetics Is and Why You Need to Know Some

The study of gene expression (how genes get turned on and off; flip to
Chapter 10) and how the genetic code works at the levels of DNA and RNA
is considered part of molecular genetics. Research on the causes of cancer
and the hunt for a cure (which I address in Chapter 14) focus on the mol-
ecular side of things because mutations occur at the chemical level of DNA
(see Chapter 13 for coverage of mutations). Gene therapy (see Chapter 16),
genetic engineering (see Chapter 19), and cloning (see Chapter 20) are all
subdisciplines of molecular genetics.
Population genetics: Genetics of groups
Much to the chagrin of many undergrads, genetics is surprisingly mathematical.
One area in which calculations are used to describe what goes on genetically
is population genetics.
If you take Mendelian genetics and examine the inheritance patterns of
many different individuals who have something like geographic location in
common, then you’ve got population genetics. Population genetics is the
study of the genetic diversity of a subset of a particular species (for details,
jump to Chapter 17). In essence, it’s a search for patterns that help describe
the genetic signature of a particular group, such as the consequences of
travel, isolation (from other populations), mating choices, geography, and
behavior.
Population genetics helps scientists understand how the collective genetic
diversity of a population influences the health of individuals within the popula-
tion. For example, cheetahs are lanky cats; they’re the speed demons of Africa.
Population genetics has revealed that all cheetahs are very, very genetically
similar; in fact, they’re so similar that a skin graft from any animal won’t be
rejected by any other animal. Because the genetic diversity of cheetahs is so
low, conservation biologists fear that a disease could sweep through the popu-
lation and kill off all the individuals of the species. It’s possible that no animals
would be resistant to the disease, and therefore none would survive, leading
to the extinction of this amazing predator.
Describing the genetics of populations from a mathematical standpoint is
critical to forensics (see Chapter 18). To pinpoint the uniqueness of one
DNA fingerprint, geneticists have to sample the genetic fingerprints of many
individuals and decide how common or rare a particular pattern may be.
Medicine also uses population genetics to determine how common particular
mutations are and in an attempt to develop new medicines to treat disease.
(For details on mutations, flip to Chapter 13; see Chapter 21 for information
on genetics and the development of new medicines.)

Part I: Genetics Basics 

Quantitative genetics: Measuring 
the strength of heredity
Quantitative genetics examines traits that vary in really subtle ways and
relates those traits to the underlying genetics of organisms. Characteristics
like retrieving ability in dogs, egg size or number in birds, and running speed
in humans are all controlled by a combination of whole suites of genes and
environmental effects. Mathematical in nature, quantitative genetics takes a
rather complex statistical approach to estimate how much variation in a par-
ticular trait is due to the environment and how much is actually genetic.
One application of quantitative genetics is determining how heritable a par-
ticular trait is. This measure allows scientists to make predictions about
how offspring will turn out based on characteristics of the parent organisms.
Therefore, quantitative genetics is used heavily in agriculture for plant and
animal breeding. Heritability gives some indication of how much a character-
istic (like crop yield) can change when selective breeding is applied. Most
recently, quantitative genetics has been applied to a process called QTL
analysis, which estimates how many genes control a particular trait (QTL
stands for quantitative trait loci; loci in this context refers to some number of
genes). The estimate obtained by QTL analysis is combined with sequencing
(see Chapter 11) to map the location of various genes. (Chapter 16 describes
the methods used to find genes on chromosomes.) Unfortunately, quantita-
tive genetics is beyond the scope of this book. 
Living the Life a Geneticist
The daily life of a geneticist can include working in the lab, teaching in the
classroom, and interacting with patients and their families. In this section,
you discover what a typical genetics lab is like and get a rundown of a variety
of career paths in the genetics field.
Exploring a genetics lab
A genetics lab is a busy, noisy place. It’s full of equipment and supplies and
researchers toiling away at their workstations (called lab benches, even though
the bench is really just a raised, flat surface that’s conducive to working while
standing up). Depending on whose lab you’re in, everyone may look very 
official in white lab coats. Then again, some labs are very casual — jeans
and T-shirts may be perfectly acceptable. Regardless of the attire, just about
13
Chapter 1: What Genetics Is and Why You Need to Know Some

every lab I’ve ever worked in had a stereo blaring away, the choice of music
often determined by fierce (but usually good-natured) competition among lab
mates. Besides stereos, every lab contains some or all of the following:
 Various sizes of disposable gloves to protect workers from chemical expo-
sure as well as to protect DNA and other materials from contamination.
 Pipettes for measuring even the tiniest droplets of liquids with extreme
accuracy.
 Glassware for precise measurement and storage of liquids.
 Electronic balances for making super-precise measurements of weights.
 Vials and tubes for chemical reactions.
 Chemicals and ultrapure water.
 Freezers and refrigerators for storing samples. Every lab has a regular
refrigerator (set at 40 degrees Fahrenheit), a freezer (at –4 degrees), and
an ultracold (at –112 degrees).
Freezers used in genetics labs aren’t frost-free because the temperature
inside a frost-free freezer cycles up and down to melt any ice that forms.
Repeated freezing and thawing causes DNA to break into tiny pieces,
which destroys it.
 Centrifuges for separating substances from each other. Given that differ-
ent substances have different densities, centrifuges spin at extremely high
speeds to force materials to separate so they can be handled individually.
You’re probably already familiar with the principle of how substances
with differing densities separate — just look at how oil and water behave
when mixed.
 Incubators for growing bacteria under controlled conditions. This equip-
ment maintains exact temperatures and, often, certain amounts of carbon
dioxide or oxygen to satisfy the requirements of various bacteria for
growth. Many incubators contain shakers that slosh liquids around to
mix oxygen into the solution.
 Autoclaves for sterilizing glassware and other equipment that can with-
stand exposure to the extreme heat and pressure that kills bacteria and
viruses.
 Complex pieces of equipment such as thermocyclers (used for PCR; see
Chapter 18) and DNA sequencers (see Chapter 11).
 Lab notebooks for recording every step of every reaction or experiment
in nauseating detail. This obsessive record keeping is necessary because
every experiment must be fully replicated (run over and over) to make
sure the results are valid. The lab notebook is also a legal document that
can be used in court cases, so precision and completeness are musts.
 Desktop computers packed with software for analyzing results and con-
necting via the Internet to vast databases packed with genetic information
(flip to Chapter 24 for the addresses of some useful sites).
14
Part I: Genetics Basics 

Researchers in the lab use the various pieces of equipment and supplies
listed above to conduct experiments and run chemical reactions. Some of
the common activities occurring in the genetics lab include:
 Separating DNA from the rest of the cell’s contents (see Chapter 6)
 Measuring the purity of a DNA sample and determining how much DNA
(by weight) is present
 Mixing chemicals that are used in reactions and experiments designed
to analyze DNA samples
 Growing special strains of bacteria and viruses to aid in examining short
stretches of DNA (see Chapter 16)
 Using DNA sequencing (covered in Chapter 11) to learn the order of
bases that compose a DNA strand (which I explain in Chapter 6)
 Setting up polymerase chain reactions, or PCR (see Chapter 18), a 
powerful process that allows scientists to analyze even very tiny
amounts of DNA
 Analyzing the results of DNA sequencing by comparing sequences from
many different organisms (this information is found in a massive, pub-
licly available database; see Chapter 24)
 Comparing DNA fingerprints from several individuals to identify perpe-
trators or assign paternity (see Chapter 18)
 Weekly or daily lab meetings when everyone in the lab comes together
to discuss results or plan new experiments
Sorting through careers in genetics
Whole teams of people contribute to the study of genetics. The following are
just a few job descriptions for you to mull over if you’re considering a career
in genetics.
Lab tech
Lab technicians handle most of the day-to-day happenings in the lab. The tech
mixes chemicals for everyone else in the lab to use in experiments. Techs usu-
ally handle preparing the right sorts of materials to grow bacteria (which are
used as vectors for DNA; see Chapter 16), setting up the bacterial cultures,
and monitoring their growth. Also, techs are usually responsible for keeping
all the necessary supplies straight and washing the glassware — not a glam-
orous job but a necessary one because labs use tons of glass beakers and
flasks that have to been cleaned.
When it comes to actual experiments, lab technicians are responsible for 
separating the DNA from the rest of the tissue around it. They sometimes
use prepackaged kits for this task, but some sorts of tissue (like that from
15
Chapter 1: What Genetics Is and Why You Need to Know Some

plants and insects) require complex procedures with many chemicals and
complicated steps. After the DNA’s separated from the cells, the tech tests it
for purity (to make sure no contaminants, like proteins, are present). Using a
rather complicated machine with a strong laser, the tech can also measure
exactly how much DNA is present. When a sufficiently pure sample of DNA is
obtained, techs may analyze the DNA in greater detail (with PCR or sequenc-
ing reactions).
The educational background needed to be a lab tech varies with the amount
of responsibility demanded by a particular position. Most techs have a mini-
mum of a bachelor’s degree in biology or some related field and need some
background in microbiology to understand and carry out the techniques of
handling bacteria safely and without contaminating cultures. And all techs
must be good record-keepers because every single activity in the lab is docu-
mented in writing in the lab notebook.
Graduate student and post-doc
At most universities, genetics labs are full of graduate students who are work-
ing on either master’s degrees or PhDs. In some labs, these students may be
carrying out their own, independent research. On the other hand, many labs
focus their work on a specific problem, like some specialized approach to
studying cancer, and every student in that sort of lab works on some aspect
of what his or her professor studies. Graduate students do a lot of the same
things that lab techs do (see the preceding section), plus they design experi-
ments, carry out those experiments, analyze the results, and then work to
figure out what the results mean. Then, the graduate student writes a long
document (called a thesis or dissertation) to describe what was done, what it
means, and how it fits in with other people’s research on the subject. While
working in the lab, grad students take classes and are subjected to grueling
exams (trust me on the grueling part).
All graduate students must hold a bachelor’s degree, and, to apply to grad
school, must take a standardized test called the GRE (Graduate Record Exam).
Performance on this examination determines eligibility for admission to
schools and may be used for selection for fellowships and awards. (If you’re
going to be staring down this test in the near future, you may want to get
a leg up by checking out The GRE Test For Dummies, by Suzee Vlk [Wiley].)
In general, it takes two or three years to earn a master’s degree. A doctorate
(denoted by PhD) usually requires anywhere from four to seven years of edu-
cation beyond the bachelor’s level.
After graduating with a PhD, a geneticist-in-training may need to get more
experience before hitting the job market. Positions that provide such experi-
ence are collectively referred to as post-docs. A post-doc (that is, a person
holding a post-doc position) is usually much more independent when it comes
to research than a grad student. The post-doc is often working to learn new
techniques or acquire a specialty before moving on to a position as a profes-
sor or a research scientist.
16
Part I: Genetics Basics 

Research scientist
Research scientists work in private industry to design experiments and direct
the activities of lab techs. All sorts of industries employ research scientists,
including:
 Pharmaceutical companies, to conduct investigations on how drugs affect
gene expression (see Chapter 10) and to develop new treatments such
as gene therapy (see Chapter 16)
 Forensics labs, to analyze DNA found at crime scenes and compare
DNA fingerprints (see Chapter 18)
 Companies that analyze information generated by genome projects
(human and others; see Chapter 11)
 Companies that support the work of other genetics labs by designing
and marketing products used in research, such as kits used to run DNA
fingerprints
A research scientist usually holds a master’s degree or a PhD. With only a bach-
elor’s degree, several years of experience as a lab tech may suffice. Research
scientists have to be able to design experiments and analyze results using
statistics. Good record keeping and strong communication skills (especially
in writing) are musts. Most research scientists also have to be capable of
managing and supervising people. In addition, financial responsibilities may
include keeping up with expenditures, ordering equipment and supplies, and
wrangling salaries of other personnel.
College or university professor
Professors do everything that research scientists do with the added responsi-
bilities of teaching courses, writing proposals to get funds to support research,
and writing papers for publication of research results. Professors supervise the
lab techs, graduate students, and post-docs that work in their labs. Generally,
such supervision means designing research projects and then ensuring the
projects are done correctly in the right amount of time (and under budget!).
The number of courses a professor is required to teach varies according to the
university. Small schools may require a professor to teach as many as three
courses every semester. Upper-tier institutions (think Big Ten or Ivy League)
may require only one course of instruction per year. (To put this in perspec-
tive, genetics courses may have as many as 200 students every semester.
Most courses run 12 weeks with three lectures per week — writing an hour-long
lecture from scratch takes me six to eight hours. Professors also write and
grade exams. For three different courses, multiply the workload by three.)
Genetics professors teach the basics as well as very advanced and specialty
courses like recombinant DNA (covered in Chapter 16) and population genet-
ics (covered in Chapter 17).
17
Chapter 1: What Genetics Is and Why You Need to Know Some

Regardless of the number of courses a professor is required to teach, he or
she is usually expected to write proposals to funding agencies to get enough
money to pay for research expenses. When funding is obtained, professors
team up with lab techs, graduate students, and post-docs to do the work
promised in the proposal. Professors are required to publish their research
results in reputable, peer-reviewed journals. (Peer-review means the work is
judged by two or more experts in the field and deemed valid.)
To qualify for a professorship, universities require a minimum of a PhD and
most require additional post-doctoral experience. Job candidates must have
already published research results to demonstrate the ability to do relevant
research. Most universities also look for evidence that the candidate will be
successful at getting grants — that means the candidate must usually get a
grant before getting a job.
Genetic counselor
Genetic counselors work with medical personnel to interpret the medical his-
tories of patients and their families. The counselor usually works directly with
the patient to assemble all the information into a family tree (see Chapter 12).
Then the counselor looks for patterns to determine which traits may be hered-
itary. Counselors can also tell which diseases are likely to be inherited more
than others. Genetic counselors are trained to conduct careful and thorough
interviews to make sure that no information is missed or left out.
Genetic counselors usually hold a master’s degree. Training includes many
hours working with patients to hone interview and analysis skills (under
the close supervision of experienced professionals, of course). The position
requires excellent record-keeping skills and strict attention to detail. Genetic
counselors also have to be good at interacting with all kinds of people, includ-
ing research scientists and physicians. And the ability to communicate very
well, both in writing and verbally, is a must.
The most essential skill of a genetic counselor is the ability to be non-
judgmental and non-directive. The counselor must be able to analyze a
family history without bias or prejudice and inform the patient of his or
her options without recommending any one course of action over another.
Furthermore, the counselor must keep all information about his or her
patients confidential, sharing information only with authorized personnel
such as the person’s own physician, to protect the patient’s privacy.

T
he study of genetics and the study of how cells work are closely related.
The process of passing genetic material from one generation to the next
depends completely on how cells grow and divide. To reproduce, a simple
organism such as bacteria or yeast simply copies its DNA (through a process
called replication, which I cover in Chapter 6) and splits in two. But organisms
that reproduce sexually go through a complicated dance that includes mixing
and matching strands of DNA (a process called recombination) and then reduc-
ing the amount of DNA in special sex cells to arrive at completely new genetic
combinations for their offspring. These amazing processes are part of what
makes you unique. So, come inside your cell — you need to be familiar with the
processes of mitosis (cell division) and meiosis (the production of sex cells)
to appreciate how genetics works.
Welcome to Your Cell!
There are two basic kinds of organisms:
 Prokaryotes: Organisms whose cells lack a nucleus and therefore have
DNA floating loosely in the liquid center of the cell
 Eukaryotes: Organisms that have a well-defined nucleus to house and
protect the DNA
A nucleus is a compartment filled with DNA surrounded by a membrane
called a nuclear envelope.

The basic biologies of the two kinds of organisms are similar but not identical.
Because all living things fall into these two groups, understanding the differ-
ences and similarities between cell types is important. In this section, I show
you how to distinguish the two kinds of cells from each other, and you get a
quick tour of the insides of cells — both with and without nuclei. Figure 2-1
shows you the structure of each type of cell.
Cells without a nucleus
Organisms composed of cells without nuclei are classified as prokaryotes,
which means “before nucleus.” Prokaryotes are the most common forms of life
on earth. You are, at this very moment, covered in and inhabited by millions
of prokaryotic cells: bacteria. Much of your life and your body’s processes
depend on these arrangements; for example, the digestion going on in your
intestines is partially powered by bacteria that break down the food you eat.
Most of the bacteria in your body are completely harmless to you. Other
species of bacteria, however, can be vicious and deadly, causing rapidly
transmitted diseases such as cholera.
All bacteria, regardless of temperament, are simple, one-celled prokaryotic
organisms. None have cell nuclei, and all are small cells with relatively small
amounts of DNA (see Chapter 11 for more on the amounts of DNA different
organisms possess).

Part I: Genetics Basics 

The exterior of a prokaryotic cell is encapsulated by a cell wall that serves as
the bacteria’s only protection from the outside world. A plasma membrane
(membranes are thin sheets or layers) regulates the exchange of nutrients,
water, and gases that nourish the bacterial cell. DNA, usually in the form of a
single hoop-shaped piece (segments of DNA like this one are called chromo-
somes; see the section “Examining the basics of chromosomes” later in the
chapter), floats around inside the cell. The liquid interior of the cell is called
the cytoplasm. The cytoplasm provides a cushiony, watery home for the DNA
and other cell machinery that carries out the business of living. Prokaryotes
divide, and thus reproduce, by simple mitosis, which is covered in detail in
“Mitosis: We Gotta Split, Baby!”
Cells with a nucleus
Organisms that have cells with nuclei are classified as eukaryotes (meaning
“true nucleus”). Eukaryotes range in complexity from simple one-celled ani-
mals and plants all the way to complex multicellular organisms like you.
Eukaryotic cells are fairly complicated and have numerous parts to keep
track of (see Figure 2-1). Like prokaryotes, eukaryotic cells are held together
by a plasma membrane, and sometimes a cell wall surrounds the membrane
(plants, for example have cell walls). But that’s where the similarities end.
The most important feature of the eukaryotic cell is the nucleus — the 
membrane-surrounded compartment that houses the DNA that’s divided into
one or more chromosomes. The nucleus protects the DNA from damage during
day-to-day living. Eukaryotic chromosomes are usually long, string-like seg-
ments of DNA instead of the hoop-shaped ones found in prokaryotes. Another
hallmark of eukaryotes is the way the DNA is packaged: Eukaryotes usually
have much larger amounts of DNA than prokaryotes, so to fit all that DNA
into the tiny cell nucleus, it must be tightly wound around special proteins.
(For all the details about DNA packaging for eukaryotes, you can flip ahead
to Chapter 6.)
Unlike prokaryotes, eukaryotes have all sorts of cell parts, called organelles,
that help carry out the business of living. The organelles are found floating
around in the watery cytoplasm outside the nucleus. Two of the most impor-
tant organelles are:
 Mitochondria: The powerhouses of the eukaryotic cell, mitochondria
pump out energy by converting glucose to ATP (adenosine triphosphate).
ATP acts like a battery of sorts, storing energy until it’s needed for day-
to-day living. Both animals and plants have mitochondria.
 Chloroplasts: These organelles are unique to plants. They process the
energy of sunlight into sugars that then are used by plant mitochondria
to generate the energy that nourishes the living cells.
21
Chapter 2: Celling Out: Basic Cell Biology

Eukaryotic cells are able to carry out behaviors that prokaryotes can’t. For
example, one-celled eukaryotes often have appendages, such as long tails
(called flagella) or hair-like projections (called cilia) that work like hundreds
of tiny paddles, to help them move around. Also, only eukaryotic cells are
capable of ingesting fluids and particles for nutrition; prokaryotes must
transport materials through their cell walls, a process that severely limits
their culinary options.
In most multicellular eukaryotes, cells come in two basic varieties: body cells
(called somatic cells) or sex cells. The two cell types have very different func-
tions and are produced in very different ways.
Somatic cells
Somatic cells are produced by simple cell division called mitosis (see the sec-
tion “Mitosis: We Gotta Split, Baby!” for details). Somatic cells of multicellular
organisms like you are differentiated into special cell types. Skin cells and
muscle cells are both somatic cells, for instance, but if you were to examine
your skin cells under a microscope and compare them with your muscle
cells, you’d see their structures are very different. The various cells that make
up your body all have the same basic components (membrane, organelles, and
so on), but the arrangements of the elements change from one cell type to the
next so that they can carry out various jobs such as digestion (intestinal cells),
energy storage (fat cells), or oxygen transport to your tissues (blood cells).
Sex cells
Sex cells are specialized cells that are used for reproduction. Only eukaryotic
organisms engage in sexual reproduction, which is covered in detail at the
end of this chapter in the section “Mommy, where did I come from?”. Sexual
reproduction combines genetic material from two organisms and requires spe-
cial preparation in the form of a reduction in the amount of genetic material
allocated to sex cells — a process called meiosis (see “Meiosis: Making Cells
for Sex” in this chapter for an explanation). In humans, the two types of sex
cells are eggs and sperm.
Examining the basics of chromosomes
Chromosomes are threadlike strands that are composed of DNA. To pass genetic
traits from one generation to the next, the chromosomes must be copied (see
Chapter 6), and then the copies must be divvied up. Most prokaryotes have
only one circular chromosome that, when copied, is passed on to the daugh-
ter cells (new cells created by cell division) during mitosis. Eukaryotes have
more complex problems to solve (like divvying up half of the chromosomes
to make sex cells), and their chromosomes behave differently during mitosis
and meiosis. Additionally, there are various terms to describe the anatomy,
shapes, the number of copies, and situations that eukaryotic chromosomes
find themselves in. This section gets into the intricacies of chromosomes in
the eukaryotic cells, because they’re so complex.
22
Part I: Genetics Basics 

Counting out chromosome numbers
Each eukaryotic organism has a very specific number of chromosomes per
cell — ranging from one to many. For example, humans have 46 total chromo-
somes. These chromosomes come in two varieties:
 Sex chromosomes: These chromosomes determine gender. Human cells
contain two sex chromosomes. If you’re female, you have two X chromo-
somes, and if you’re male, you have an X and a Y chromosome. (To find
out more about how sex is determined by the X and Y chromosomes, flip
ahead to Chapter 5.)
 Autosomal chromosomes: Autosomal simply refers to non-sex chromo-
somes. So, sticking with the human example, do the math, and you can
see that humans have 44 autosomal chromosomes.
Ah, but there’s more. In humans, chromosomes come in pairs. That means
you have 22 pairs of uniquely shaped autosomal chromosomes plus 1 pair
of sex chromosomes, for a total of 23 chromosome pairs. Your autosomal
chromosomes are identified by numbers — 1 through 22. So, you have two
chromosome 1s, two 2s, and so on. Figure 2-2 shows you how all human chro-
mosomes are divided into pairs and numbered.

Chapter 2: Celling Out: Basic Cell Biology

When chromosomes are divided into pairs, the individual chromosomes in
each pair are considered homologous, meaning that the paired chromosomes
are identical to one another in shape and size. For example, your two single
chromosome 2s are paired up because they’re identical in shape and size.
These homologous chromosomes are sometimes referred to as homologs
for short.
Chromosome numbers can get a bit confusing. Humans are diploid, meaning we
have two copies of each chromosome. Some organisms (like bees and wasps)
have only one set of chromosomes (cells with one set of chromosomes are
referred to as haploid); others have three, four, or as many as sixteen copies of
each chromosome! The number of chromosome sets held by a particular organ-
ism is called the ploidy. For more on chromosome numbers, see Chapter 15.
The total number of chromosomes doesn’t tell you what the ploidy of an
organism is. For that reason, the number of chromosomes an organism has is
often listed as some multiple of n. Thus, humans are 2n = 46 (indicating that
humans are diploid and the total number of chromosomes is 46). A single set
of chromosomes referred to by the n is the haploid number. Human sex cells
such as eggs or sperm are haploid (see “Mommy, where did I come from?”
later in this chapter).
The homologous pairs of chromosomes in humans are thought to have started
as one set (that is, haploid), with the entire set being duplicated at some point
in some distant ancestor, many millions of years ago.
Examining chromosome anatomy
Chromosomes are often depicted in stick-like forms, which you can see in
Figure 2-3. Chromosomes don’t look like sticks, though. In fact, most of the
time they’re loose and string-like. Chromosomes only take on this distinctive
shape and form when cell division is about to take place (during metaphase
either through meiosis or mitosis). They’re often drawn in this very distinctive
shape and form because the special characteristics of eukaryotic chromosomes
are easier to see. Figure 2-3 points out the important features of eukaryotic
chromosomes.
The part of the chromosome that appears pinched together (located, in the
figure, in the middle of the chromosome) is called the centromere. The place-
ment of the centromere (whether it’s closer to the top, middle, or bottom
of the chromosome) is what gives each chromosome its unique shape (see
Figure 2-4). The ends of the chromosomes are called telomeres. Telomeres are
made of densely packed DNA and serve to protect the DNA message carried
by the chromosome. (Flip ahead to Chapter 11 to find more about telomeres
and how they may affect the process of aging.)
24
Part I: Genetics Basics 

The differences in shapes and sizes of chromosomes are easy to see, but the
most important differences between chromosomes are hidden deep inside
the DNA. Chromosomes carry genes. Genes are sections of DNA that make
up the building plans for physical traits. The genes tell the body how, when,
and where to make all the structures that are necessary for the processes of
living (for more on how genes work, flip ahead to Chapter 10). Each pair of
homologous chromosomes carries the same — but not necessarily identical —
genes. For example, both chromosomes of a particular homologous pair might
contain the gene for hair color, but one can be a “brown hair” version of the
gene — alternative versions of genes are called alleles (see Figure 2-3) — and
the other can be a “blond hair” allele.

Chapter 2: Celling Out: Basic Cell Biology

Any given gene can have one or more alleles. In Figure 2-3, one chromosome
carries the allele A while its homolog carries the allele a (the relative size of
an allele is normally very small; the alleles are large here so you can see them).
The alleles code for the different physical traits (phenotypes) you see in ani-
mals and plants like hair color or flower shape. You can find out more about
how alleles affect phenotype in Chapter 3.
Each point along the chromosome is called a locus (Latin for “place”). The plural
of locus is loci (pronounced low-sigh). Most of the phenotypes that you see
are produced by multiple genes (that is, genes occurring at different loci and
often on different chromosomes) acting together. For instance, human eye
color is determined by at least three different genes that reside on two different
chromosomes. You can find out more about how genes are arranged along
chromosomes in Chapter 15.
Mitosis: We Gotta Split, Baby!
Most cells have simple lifestyles: They grow, divide, and eventually die.
Figure 2-5 illustrates the basic life cycle of a typical somatic (or body) cell.
The cell cycle (the stages a cell goes through from one division to another) is
tightly regulated; some cells divide all the time, and others never divide at all.
Your body uses mitosis to provide new cells when you grow and to replace
cells that wear out or become damaged from injury. Talk about multitasking —
you’re going through mitosis right now, while you read this book! Some cells
divide only part of the time, when new cells are needed to handle certain jobs
like fighting infection. Cancer cells, on the other hand, get carried away and
divide too often. (In Chapter 14, you can find out how the cell cycle is regu-
lated and what happens when it goes awry.)
The cell cycle includes mitosis — the process of reproducing the cell nucleus
by division. The end result of each round of the cell cycle is a simple cell divi-
sion that creates two new cells from one original cell. During mitosis, all DNA
present in the cell is copied (see Chapter 7), and when the original cell divides,
a complete collection of all the chromosomes (in humans, 23 pairs) goes to
each of the two resulting cells. Prokaryotes and some simple eukaryotic
organisms use mitosis to reproduce themselves. (More complex eukaryotic
organisms use meiosis for sexual reproduction, in which each of the two sex
cells sends only one copy of each chromosome into the eggs or sperm. You
can read all about that in the section “Meiosis: Making Cells for Sex,” later in
this chapter.)
26
Part I: Genetics Basics 

There are two important points to remember about mitosis:
 Mitosis produces two identical cells. The new cells are identical to each
other and to the cell that divided to create them.
 Cells created by mitosis have exactly the same number of chromo-
somes as the original cell did. If the original cell had 46 chromosomes,
the new cells each have 46 chromosomes.
Mitosis is only one of the major phases in the cell cycle; the other is interphase.
In the following sections, I guide you through the phases of the cell cycle and
tell you exactly what happens during each one.
Step 1: Time to grow
Interphase is the part of the cell cycle during which the cell grows, copies its
DNA, and prepares to divide. Interphase is usually divided into three stages:
the G1 phase, the S phase, and the G2 phase.
G1 phase
When a cell begins life, such as the moment an egg is fertilized, the first thing
that happens is the original cell starts to grow. This period of growth is called
the G1 phase of interphase. Lots of things happen during G1: DNA supervises
the work of the cell, metabolism (the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide)
occurs, and cells breathe and “eat.”

Chapter 2: Celling Out: Basic Cell Biology

Some cells opt out of the cell cycle, stop growing, and remain in G1 perma-
nently. Your brain cells, for example, have retired from the cell cycle. Red
blood cells and muscle cells don’t divide, either. In fact, human red blood
cells have no nuclei and thus possess no DNA of their own.
If the cell in question plans to divide, though, it can’t stay in G1 forever.
Actively dividing cells go through the whole cell cycle every 24 hours or so.
After a predetermined period of growth that lasts from a few minutes to sev-
eral hours, the cell arrives at the first checkpoint (see Figure 2-5). When the
cell passes the first checkpoint, there’s no turning back — it’s a one-way trip
to splitsville.
Various proteins control when the cell moves from one phase of the cycle to
the next. At the first checkpoint, proteins called cyclins and enzymes called
kinases control the border between G1 and the next phase. Cyclins and kinases
interact to cue up the various stages of the merry-go-round of cell division.
Two particular chemicals, CDK (cyclin dependent kinase) and G1 cyclin,
hook up to escort the cell over the border from G1 to S — the next phase.
S phase
S phase is the point at which the cell’s DNA is replicated. When the cell enters
the S phase, activity around the chromosomes really steps up. All the chro-
mosomes must be copied to make exact replicas that later are passed on to
the newly formed daughter cells produced by cell division. DNA replication is
a very complex process that gets full coverage in Chapter 7.
For now, all you need to know is that all the cell’s chromosomes are copied
during S, and the copies stay together as a unit (joined at the centromere; see
Figure 2-3) when the cell moves from S into G2 — the final step in interphase.
The replicated chromosomes are called sister chromatids (see Figure 2-3).
Sister chromatids are alike in every way. They carry the exact same copies
of the exact same genes. During mitosis (or meiosis), the sister chromatids
are divided up and sent to the daughter cells as part of the cell cycle.
G2 phase
The G2 phase leads up to cell division. It’s the last phase before actual mito-
sis gets underway. G2, also sometimes called Gap 2, gives the cell time to get
bigger before splitting into two smaller cells. Another set of cyclins and CDK
work together to push the cell through the second checkpoint located at the
border between G2 and mitosis. (For details on the first checkpoint, jump
back to the section “G1 phase.”) As the cell grows, the chromosomes, now
copied and hooked together as sister chromatids, stay together inside the
cell nucleus. (The DNA is still “relaxed” at this point and hasn’t yet taken on
the fat, sausage-shaped appearance it assumes during mitosis.) After the cell
crosses the G2/M checkpoint (see Figure 2-5), the business of mitosis formally
gets underway.
28
Part I: Genetics Basics 

Step 2: Divvying up the chromosomes
In the cell cycle, mitosis is the process of dividing up the newly copied chro-
mosomes (that were created in interphase; see the preceding section) to make
certain that the new cells each get a full set. Generally, mitosis is divided into
four phases, which you can see in Figure 2-6 and read about in the following
sections.
The phases of mitosis are a bit artificial because the movement doesn’t stop
at each point; instead, the chromosomes cruise right from one phase to the
next. But dividing the process into phases is useful for understanding how
the chromosomes go from being all mixed together to neatly parting ways
and getting into the proper newly formed cells.
Prophase
During prophase, the chromosomes get very compact and condensed, taking
on the familiar sausage shape. During interphase (see the “Step 1: Time to
grow” section earlier in this chapter), the DNA that makes up the chromo-
somes is tightly wound around special proteins, sort of like string wrapped
around beads. The whole “necklace” is wound tightly on itself to compress

the enormous DNA molecules to sizes small enough to fit inside the cell
nucleus. But even when coiled during interphase, the chromosomes are still
so threadlike and tiny that they’re essentially invisible. That changes during
prophase, when the chromosomes become so densely packed that they’re
easily seen with an ordinary light microscope.
At this time, chromosomes are duplicated to form sister chromatids (see
Figure 2-3). Sister chromatids of each chromosome are exact, twin copies of
each other. Each chromatid is actually a chromosome in its own right, but
thinking of chromosomes as chromatids may help you keep all the players
straight during the process of division.
As the chromosomes/chromatids condense, the cell nucleus starts breaking
up, allowing the chromosomes to move freely across the cell as the process
of cell division progresses.
Metaphase
Metaphase is the point when the chromosomes all line up in the center of the
cell. After the nuclear membrane dissolves and prophase is complete, the
chromosomes go from being a tangled mass to lining up in a more or less
neat row in the center of the cell (see Figure 2-6). Threadlike strands called
spindles grab each chromosome around its waist-like centromere. The spin-
dles are attached to points on either side of the cell called poles.
Sometimes scientists use geographic terms to describe the positions of chro-
mosomes during metaphase: The chromosomes line up at the equator and
are attached to the poles. This trick may help you better visualize the events
of metaphase.
Anaphase
During anaphase, the sister chromatids are pulled apart, and the resulting
halves migrate to opposite poles (see Figure 2-6). At this point, it’s easy to
see that the chromatids are actually chromosomes. Every sister chromatid
gets split apart so that the cell that’s about to be formed ends up with a full
set of all the original cell’s chromosomes.
Telophase
Finally, during telophase, nuclear membranes begin to form around the two
sets of separated chromosomes (see Figure 2-6). The chromosomes begin to
relax and take on their usual interphase form. The cell itself begins to divide
as telophase comes to an end.
30
Part I: Genetics Basics 

Step 3: Splitsville
When mitosis is complete and new nuclei have formed, the cell divides into
two smaller, identical cells. The division of one cell into two is called cytokine-
sis (cyto meaning cell and kinesis meaning movement). Technically, cytokine-
sis happens after metaphase is over and before interphase begins. Each new
cell has a full set of chromosomes, just as the original cell did. All the organelles
and cytoplasm present in the original cell are divided up to provide the new
cell with all the machinery it needs for metabolism and growth. The new cells
are now at interphase (specifically, the G1 stage) and are ready to begin the
cell cycle again.
Meiosis: Making Cells for Sex
Meiosis is a cell division that includes reducing the chromosome number as
preparation for sexual reproduction. Meiosis reduces the amount of DNA by
half so that when fertilization occurs, each offspring gets a full set of chromo-
somes. As a result of meiosis, the cell goes from being diploid to being haploid.
Or to put it another way, the cell goes from being 2n to being n. In humans,
this means that the cells produced by meiosis (either eggs or sperm) have
23 chromosomes each — one copy of each of the homologous chromosomes.
(See the section “Counting out chromosome numbers” earlier in this chapter
for more information.)
Meiosis has many characteristics in common with mitosis. The stages go by
similar names, and the chromosomes move around similarly, but the products
of meiosis are completely different from those of mitosis. Whereas mitosis
ends with two exactly identical cells, meiosis produces four cells each with
exactly half the amount of DNA that the original cell contained. Furthermore,
with meiosis, the homologous chromosomes go through a complex exchange
of parts called recombination. Recombination is one of the most important
aspects of meiosis and leads to genetic variation that allows each individual
produced by sexual reproduction to be truly unique.
Meiosis goes through two rounds of division: meiosis I and the sequel, meio-
sis II. Figure 2-7 shows the progressing stages of both meiosis I and meiosis II.
Unlike lots of movie sequels, the sequel in meiosis is really necessary. In both
rounds of division, the chromosomes go through stages of division that resem-
ble those in mitosis. However, the chromosomes undergo different actions in
meiotic prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase.
31
Chapter 2: Celling Out: Basic Cell Biology

In my experience, students often get stuck on the phases of meiosis and miss
the most important parts of meiosis: recombination and the division of the
chromosomes. To prevent that sort of confusion, I don’t break down meiosis
by phases. Instead, I focus on the activities of the chromosomes themselves.
In meiosis I:
 The homologous pairs of chromosomes line up side by side and exchange
parts. This is called crossing-over or recombination, and it occurs during
prophase I.
 During metaphase I, the homologous chromosomes line up at the equa-
tor of the cell (called the metaphase plate), and homologs go to opposite
poles during the first round of anaphase.
 The cell divides in telophase I, reducing the amount of genetic material
by half, and enters a second round of division — meiosis II.

During meiosis II:
 The individual chromosomes (as sister chromatids) condense
during prophase II and line up at the metaphase plates of both
cells (metaphase II).
 The chromatids separate and go to opposite poles (anaphase II).
 The cells divide, resulting in a total of four daughter cells each possess-
ing one copy of each chromosome.
Meiosis Part I
Cells that undergo meiosis start in a phase similar to the interphase that pre-
cedes mitosis. The cells grow in a G1 phase, undergo DNA replication during S,
and prepare for division during G2. (To review what happens in each of these
phases, flip back to the section “Step 1: Time to grow.”) When meiosis is about
to begin, the chromosomes condense. By the time meiotic interphase is 
complete, the chromosomes have been copied and are hitched up as sister
chromatids, just as they would be in mitosis. Next up are the phases of meio-
sis I, which I profile in the sections that follow.
Find your partner
During prophase I (labeled “I” because it’s in the first round of meiosis), the
homologous chromosomes find each other. These homologous chromosomes
originally came from the mother and father of the individual whose cells are
now undergoing meiosis. Thus, during meiosis, maternal and paternal chromo-
somes, as homologs, line up side by side. In Figure 2-2, you can see an entire
set of 46 human chromosomes. Although the members of the pair seem iden-
tical, they’re not. The homologous chromosomes have different combinations
of alleles at the thousands of loci along each chromosome. (For more on alle-
les, jump to the section “Chromosome anatomy,” earlier in this chapter.)
Recombining makes you unique
When the homologous chromosomes pair up in prophase I, the chromatids of
the two homologs actually zip together, and the chromatids exchange parts
of their arms. Enzymes cut the chromosomes into pieces and seal the newly
combined strands back together in an action called crossing-over. When
crossing-over is complete, the chromatids consist of part of their original
DNA and part of their homolog’s DNA. The loci don’t get mixed up or turned
around — the chromosome sequence stays in its original order. The only thing
that’s different is that the maternal and paternal chromosomes (as homologs)
are now mixed together.
33
Chapter 2: Celling Out: Basic Cell Biology

Figure 2-8 illustrates crossing-over in action. The figure shows one pair of
homologous chromosomes and two loci. At both loci, the chromosomes
have alternative forms of the genes — in other words, the alleles are different:
Homolog one has A and b, and homolog two has a and B. When replication
takes place, the sister chromatids are identical (because they’re exact copies
of each other). After crossing-over, the two sister chromatids have exchanged
arms. Thus, each homolog has a sister chromatid that’s different.
Partners divide
The recombined homologs line up at the metaphase equator of the cell (see
Figure 2-7). The nuclear membrane begins to break down, and in a process
similar to mitotic anaphase, spindle fibers grasp the homologous chromo-
somes by their centromeres and pull them to opposite sides of the cell.
At the end of the first phase of meiosis, the cell undergoes its first round of
division (telophase 1, followed by cytokinesis 1). The newly divided cells each
contain one set of chromosomes, the now partnerless homologs, still in the
form of replicated sister chromatids.
When the homologs line up, maternal and paternal chromosomes pair up, but
it’s a tossup as to which side of the equator each one ends up on. Therefore,
each pair of homologs divides independently of every other homologous pair.
This is the basis of the principle of independent assortment, which I cover in
Chapters 3 and 4.
Following telophase I, the cells enter an in-between round called interkinesis
(which means “between movements”). The chromosomes relax and lose their
fat, ready-for-metaphase appearances. Interkinesis is just a “resting” phase in
preparation for the second round of meiosis.

Meiosis Part II
Meiosis II is the second phase of cell division that produces the final product
of meiosis: cells each containing only one copy of each chromosome. The
chromosomes condense once more to their now-familiar fat, sausage shapes.
Keep in mind that each cell has only a single set of chromosomes, which are
still in the form of sister chromatids.
During metaphase II, the chromosomes line up along the equator of the
cells, and spindle fibers attach at the centromeres. In anaphase II, the sister
chromatids are pulled apart and move to opposite poles of their respective
cell. The nuclear membranes form around the now single chromosomes
(telophase II). Finally, cell division takes place. At the end of the process,
each of the four cells contains one single set of chromosomes.
Mommy, where did I come from?
From gametogenesis, honey. Meiosis in humans (and all animals that repro-
duce sexually) produces cells called gametes. Gametes come in the form of
sperm (produced by males) or eggs (produced by females). When conditions
are right, sperm and egg unite to create a new organism, which takes the form
of a zygote. Figure 2-9 shows the process of gametogenesis (the production of
gametes) in humans.

Chapter 2: Celling Out: Basic Cell Biology

For human males, special cells in the male’s sexual organs (testes) produce
spermatogonia. Spermatogonia are 2n — they contain a full diploid set of 46
chromosomes (see the earlier section “Counting out chromosome numbers”).
After meiosis I, each single spermatogonia has divided into two cells called
secondary spermatocytes. These spermatocytes contain only one copy of each
homolog (as sister chromatids). After one more division (meiosis II), the sper-
matids that become sperm cells have one copy of each chromosome. Thus,
sperm cells are haploid and contain 23 chromosomes. Because males have X
and Y sex chromosomes, half their sperm (men produce literally millions)
contain Xs and half contain Ys.
Human females produce eggs in much the same way that men produce
sperm. Egg cells, which are produced by the ovaries, start as diploid oogonia
(that is, 2n = 46). The big difference between egg and sperm production is
that at the end of meiosis II, only one mature, haploid (23 chromosomes) sex
cell (as an egg) is produced instead of four (see Figure 2-9). The other three
cells produced are called polar bodies; the polar bodies aren’t actual egg cells
and can’t be fertilized to produce offspring.
Why does the female body produce one egg cell and three polar bodies? Egg
cells need large amounts of cytoplasm to nourish the zygote in the period
between fertilization and when the mother starts providing the growing
embryo with nutrients and energy through the placenta. The easiest way to
get enough cytoplasm into the egg when it needs it most is to put less cyto-
plasm into the other three cells produced in meiosis II.

Got hair on the backs of your fingers? All the physical traits of any living thing

genes work or even what genes actually are, you’ve probably already thought
about how physical traits can be inherited. Just think of the first thing practi-
cally everyone says when they see a newborn baby: Who does he or she look
most like, mama or daddy?
The laws of inheritance — how traits are transmitted from one generation to
the next (including dominant-recessive inheritance, segregation of traits into
gametes, and independent assortment of traits) — were discovered only a
century or so ago. In the early 1850s, Gregor Mendel, an Austrian monk who
dug gardening, looked at the physical world around him and, by simply grow-
ing peas in his garden, categorized the patterns of genetic inheritance that
are still recognized today. In this chapter, you discover how Mendel’s peas
plan changed the way scientists view the world. If you skipped Chapter 2,
don’t worry — Mendel didn’t know anything about mitosis or meiosis when
he formulated the laws of inheritance.
Mendel’s discoveries have an enormous impact on your life. If you’re inter-
ested in how genetics affects your health (Part III), reading this chapter and
getting a handle on the laws of inheritance will help you.

Flower Power: Gardening 
with Gregor Mendel
For centuries before Mendel planted his first pea plant, scholars and scientists
argued about how inheritance of physical traits worked. It was obvious that
something was passed from parent to offspring because diseases and personal-
ity traits seemed to run in families. And farmers knew that by breeding plants
and animals with certain physical features that they valued, they could create
varieties that produced desirable products, like tastier apples, more wool, or
fatter cows. But just how inheritance worked and exactly what was passed
from parent to child remained a mystery.
Enter the star of our gardening show, Gregor Mendel. Mendel was, by nature, a
curious person. As he wandered around the gardens of the monastery where
he lived in the mid-19th century, he noticed that his pea plants looked differ-
ent from one another in a number of ways. Some were tall and others short.
Some had green seeds, and others had yellow seeds. Mendel wondered what
caused the differences he observed and decided to conduct a series of simple
experiments. He chose seven characteristics of pea plants for his experiments,
as you can see in Table 3-1:

For ten years, Mendel patiently grew many varieties of peas with various
flower colors, seed shapes, seed numbers, and so on. In a process called
crossing, he mated parent plants to see what their offspring would look like.
When he passed away in 1884, Mendel was unaware of the magnitude of his
contribution to science. A full 34 years passed after publication of his work
(in 1868) before anyone realized what this simple gardener had discovered.
(For the full story on how Mendel’s research was lost and found again, flip to
Chapter 22.)
38
Part I: Genetics Basics 

If you don’t know much about plants, understanding how plants reproduce
may help you appreciate what Mendel did. To mate plants, you need flowers
and the dusty substance they produce called pollen (the plant equivalent of
sperm). Flowers have structures called ovaries (see Figure 3-1); the ovaries are
hidden inside the pistil and are connected to the outside world by the stigma.
Pollen is produced by structures called stamen. Like animals, the ovaries of
plants also produce eggs that, when exposed to pollen (pollination), are fertil-
ized to produce seeds. Under the right conditions, the seeds sprout to become
plants in their own right. The plants growing from seeds are the offspring of
the plant(s) that produced the eggs and the pollen. Fertilization can happen
in one of two ways:
 Out-crossing: Two plants can be crossed. The pollen from one can be
used to fertilize the eggs of another.
 Self-pollination: Some flowers produce both flowers and pollen, in which
case the flower may fertilize its own eggs in a process called selfing or
self-pollination. Not all plants can self-fertilize, but Mendel’s peas could.
Getting the Lowdown 
on Inheritance Lingo
You probably already know that genes are passed from parent to offspring and
that somehow, genes are responsible for the physical traits (phenotype, such
as eye color) you observe in yourself and the people and organisms around
you. (For more on how genes do their jobs, you can flip ahead to Chapter 10.)
The simplest possible definition of a gene is an inherited factor that determines
some trait.

Chapter 3: Mendel’s Peas Plan: Discovering the Laws of Inheritance

Genes come in different forms, called alleles. An individual’s alleles determine
the phenotype observed. The combinations of alleles of all the various genes
that you possess make up your genotype. Genes occupy loci, specific locations
along the strands of your DNA (locus is the singular form). Different traits
(like eye color versus hair color) are determined by genes that occupy dif-
ferent loci, often on different chromosomes (see Chapter 2 for the basics of
chromosomes). Take a look at Figure 3-2 to see how alleles are arranged in
various loci along two pairs of generic chromosomes.
In humans (and many other organisms), alleles of particular genes come in
pairs. If both alleles are identical in form, that locus is said to be homozygous,
and the whole organism can be called a homozygote for that particular locus.
If the two alleles aren’t identical, then the individual is heterozygous, or a het-
erozygote, for that trait. Individuals can be both heterozygous and homozygous
at different loci at the same time, which is how all the phenotypic variation you
see in a single organism is produced. For example, your eye color is controlled
by at least three loci, your hair color is controlled by several loci different from
eye color, and your skin color by yet other loci. You can see how figuring out
how complex sets of traits are inherited would be pretty difficult.
Making Inheritance Simple
When it comes to sorting out inheritance, it’s easiest to start out with how
one trait — sometimes called simple inheritance — is transmitted from one
generation to the next. This is the kind of inheritance that Mendel started
with when first studying his pea plants.

Part I: Genetics Basics 

Mendel’s choice of pea plants and the traits he chose to focus on had posi-
tive effects on his ability to uncover the laws of inheritance.
 The original parent plants Mendel used in his experiments were true
breeding. When true breeders are allowed to self-fertilize, the exact
same physical traits show up, unchanged, generation after generation.
True-breeding tall plants always produce tall plants, true-breeding short
plants always produce short plants, and so on.
 Mendel studied traits that had only two forms, or phenotypes, for each
characteristic (like short or tall). He deliberately chose traits that were
either one type or another, like tall or short, green-seeded or yellow-
seeded. Studying traits that came in only two forms made the inheritance
of traits much easier to sort out. (Chapter 4 covers traits that have more
than two phenotypes.)
 Mendel worked only on traits that showed an autosomal dominant
form of inheritance — that is, the genes were located on autosomal
(or non-sex) chromosomes. (More complicated forms of inheritance are
discussed in Chapters 4 and 5.)
Before his pea plants began producing pollen, Mendel opened the flower buds.
He cut off either the pollen-producing part (the stamen) or the pollen-receiving
part (the stigma) to prevent the plant from self-fertilizing. After the flower
matured, he transferred pollen by hand — okay, not technically his hand; he
used a tiny brush — from one plant (the “father”) to another (the “mother”).
Mendel then planted the seeds (the offspring) that resulted from this “mating”
to see which physical traits were produced by each cross. The following sec-
tions explain the three laws of inheritance that Mendel discovered from his
experiments.
Establishing dominance
For his experiments, Mendel crossed true-breeding plants that produced round
seeds with true breeders that produced wrinkled seeds, crossed short true-
breeders with tall true-breeders, and so on. Crosses of parent organisms that
differ only by one trait, like seed shape or plant height, are called monohybrid
crosses. Mendel patiently moved pollen from plant to plant, harvested and
planted seeds, and observed the results after the offspring plants matured.
His plants produced literally thousands of seeds, so his garden must have
been quite a sight.
To describe Mendel’s experiments and results, I refer to the parental genera-
tion with the letter P. The first offspring from a cross are referred to as F1.
If F1 offspring are mated to each other (or allowed to self-fertilize), the next
generation is called F2 (see Figure 3-3 for the generation breakdown).
41
Chapter 3: Mendel’s Peas Plan: Discovering the Laws of Inheritance

The results of Mendel’s experiments were amazingly consistent. In each and
every case when he mated true breeders of different phenotypes, all the F1
offspring had the same phenotype as one or the other parent plant. For exam-
ple, when Mendel crossed a true-breeding tall parent with a true-breeding
short parent, all the F1 offspring were tall. This result was surprising because
until then, many people thought inheritance was a blending of the characteris-
tics of the two parents — Mendel had expected his first generation offspring
to be medium height.
If Mendel had just scratched his head and stopped there, he wouldn’t have
learned much. But he allowed the F1 offspring to self-fertilize, and something
interesting happened: About 25 percent of the F2 offspring were short, and
the rest, about 75 percent, were tall (see Figure 3-3).
From that F2 generation, when allowed to self fertilize, his short plants were
true breeders — all produced short progeny. His F2 tall plants produced both
tall and short offspring. About one-third of his tall F2s bred true as tall. The
rest produced tall and short offspring in a 3:1 ratio (that is, 3⁄4 tall and 1⁄4 short;
see Figure 3-3).
After thousands of crosses, Mendel came to the very accurate conclusion that
the factors that made seed shape, seed color, pod color, plant height, and so
on were acting sets of two. He reached this understanding because one pheno-
type showed up in the F1 offspring, but both phenotypes were present among

the F2 plants. The result in the F2 generation told him that whatever it was
that controlled a particular trait (such as plant height) had been present but
somehow hidden in the F1 offspring.
Mendel quickly figured out that certain traits seemed to act like rulers, or
dominate, other traits. Dominance means that one factor masks the presence
of another. Round seed shape dominated wrinkled. Tall height dominated
short. Yellow seed color dominated green. Mendel rightly determined the
genetic principle of dominance by strictly observing phenotype in generation
and after generation and cross after cross. When true tall and short plants
were crossed, each F1 offspring got one height-determining factor from each
parent. Because tall is dominant over short, all the F1 plants were tall. Mendel
found that the only time recessive characters (traits that are masked by domi-
nant traits) were expressed was when the two factors were alike, as when
short plants self-fertilized.
Segregating alleles
Segregation is when things get separated from each other. In the genetic sense,
what’s separated are the two factors — the alleles of the gene — that deter-
mine phenotype. Figure 3-4 traces the segregation of the alleles for seed color
through three generations. The shorthand for describing alleles is typically a
capital letter for the dominant trait and the same letter in lowercase for the
recessive trait. In this example, I use Y for the dominant allele that makes
yellow seeds; y stands for the recessive allele that, when homozygous, makes
seeds green.
The letters or symbols you use for various alleles and traits are completely
arbitrary. Just make sure you’re consistent in how you use letters and sym-
bols and don’t get them mixed up.
In the segregation example featured in Figure 3-4, the parents (in the P genera-
tion) are homozygous. Each individual parent plant has a certain genotype — a
combination of alleles — that determine its phenotype. Because pea plants are
diploid (meaning they have two copies of each gene; see Chapter 2), the geno-
type of each plant is described using two letters. For example, a true-breeding
yellow-seeded plant would have the genotype YY, and green-seeded plants
are yy. The gametes (sex cells, as in pollen or eggs) produced by each plant
bear only one allele. (Sex cells are haploid; see Chapter 2 for all the details
on how meiosis produces haploid gametes.) Therefore, the true breeders can
only produce gametes of one type — YY plants can only make Y gametes and
yy plants can only produce y gametes. When a Y pollen and a y egg (or visa
versa, y pollen and Y egg) get together, they make a Yy offspring — this is the
heterozygous F1 generation.
43
Chapter 3: Mendel’s Peas Plan: Discovering the Laws of Inheritance

The bottom line of the principle of segregation is this parsing out of the pairs
of alleles into gametes. Each gamete gets one and only one allele for each
locus; this is the result of homologous chromosomes parting company during
the first round of meiosis (see Chapter 2 for more on how chromosomes split
up during meiosis). When the F1 generation self-fertilizes (to create the F2
generation), each plant produces two kinds of gametes: Half are Y, and the
other half are y. Segregation makes four combinations of zygotes possible:
YY, Yy, yY, or yy. (Yy and yY look redundant but are genetically significant
because they represent different contributions [y or Y] from each parent.)
Phenotypically, Yy, yY, and YY all look alike: yellow seeds. Only yy makes
green seeds. The ratio of genotypes is 1:2:1 (1⁄4 homozygous dominant: 2⁄4 het-
erozygous: 1⁄4 homozygous recessive) and the ratio of phenotypes is 3 to 1
(dominant phenotype to recessive phenotype).

Part I: Genetics Basics 

If allowed to self-fertilize in the F3 generation, yy parents make yy offspring.
YY parents produce only YY offspring. The Yy parents again make YY, Yy,
and yy offspring in the same ratios observed in the F2: 1⁄4 YY, 1⁄2 Yy, and 1⁄4 yy.
Scientists now know that what Mendel saw acting in sets of two were genes.
Single pairs of genes (that is, one locus) control each trait. That means that
plant height was at one locus, seed color at a different locus, seed shape at
third locus, and so on.
Declaring independence
As Mendel learned more about how traits were passed from one generation
to the next, he carried out experiments with plants that differed in two or
more traits. He discovered that the traits behaved independently — that is,
that the inheritance of plant height had no effect on the inheritance of seed
color, for example. The independent inheritance of traits is called the law of
independent assortment and is a consequence of meiosis. When homologous
pairs of chromosomes separate, they do so randomly with respect to each
other. The movement of each individual chromosome is independent with
respect to every other chromosome. It’s just like flipping a coin: As long as
the coin isn’t rigged, one coin flip has no effect on another — each flip is an
independent event. Genetically, what this random separation amounts to is
that alleles on different chromosomes are inherited independently.
Segregation and independent assortment are very closely related principles.
Segregation tells you that alleles at the same locus on pairs of chromosomes
separate and that each offspring has the same chance of inheriting a particular
allele from a parent. Independent assortment means that every offspring also
has the same opportunity to inherit any allele at any other locus (but there
are exceptions to this rule; see Chapter 4).
Finding Unknown Alleles
Mendel crossed parent plants in many different combinations in order to
work out the identity of the hidden factors (which we now know as genes)
that produced the phenotypes he observed. One type of cross was especially
informative. A testcross is when any individual with an unknown genotype is
crossed with a true breeding individual with the recessive phenotype (in other
words, a homozygote).
45
Chapter 3: Mendel’s Peas Plan: Discovering the Laws of Inheritance

Each cross provides different information about the genotypes of the individ-
uals involved. For example, Mendel could take any plant with any phenotype
and testcross it with a true-breeding recessive plant to learn which alleles
the plant of unknown genotype carried. Here’s how the testcross would work:
A plant with the dominant phenotype, violet flowers, could be crossed with a
true-breeding white flowered plant (ww). If the resulting offspring all had violet
flowers, Mendel knew that the unknown genotype was homozygous dominant
(WW). In Figure 3-5 you see the results of another testcross: A heterozygote
(Ww) testcross yielded offspring of half white and half violet phenotypes.
Using Basic Probability to Compute 
the Likelihood of Inheritance
Predicting the results of crosses is easy because the likelihood of getting par-
ticular outcomes is governed by the rules of probability. The following are two
important rules of probability that you should know:
 The multiplication rule is used when the probabilities of events are inde-
pendent of each other — that is, the result of one event doesn’t influence
the result of another. The combined probability of both events occurring
is the product of the events, so you multiply the probabilities.
 The addition rule is used when you want to know the probability of one
event occurring as opposed to another, independent, event. Put another
way, you use this rule when you want to know the probability of one event
or another event happening, but not necessarily both.
For more details about the laws of probability, check out the sidebar “Beating
the odds with genetics.”
Here’s how the addition and multiplication rules are applied for monohybrid
crosses (crosses of parent organisms that differ only by one trait). Suppose
you’ve got two pea plants. Both plants have violet flowers, and both are het-
erozygous (Ww). Each plant will produce two sorts of gametes, W and w, with
equal probability — that is, half of the gametes will be W and half will be w

for each plant. To determine the probability of a certain genotype resulting
from the cross of these two plants, you use the multiplication rule and multi-
ply probabilities. For example, what’s the probability of getting a heterozygote
(Ww) from this cross?
Because both plants are heterozygous (Ww), the probability of getting a W
from plant one is 1⁄2, and the probability of getting a w from plant two is also 1⁄2.
The word and tells you that you need to multiply the two probabilities to
determine the probability of the two events happening together. So, 1⁄2 × 1⁄2 = 1⁄4.
But there’s another way to get a heterozygote from this cross: Plant one could
contribute the w, and plant two could contribute the W. The probability of this
turn of events is exactly equal to the first scenario: 1⁄2 × 1⁄2 = 1⁄4. Thus, there are
two equally probable ways of getting a heterozygote: wW or Ww. The word
or tells you that you must add the two probabilities together to get the total
probability of getting a heterozygote: 1⁄4 + 1⁄4 = 1⁄2. Put another way, there’s a
50 percent probability of getting heterozygote offspring when two heterozy-
gotes are crossed.
47
Chapter 3: Mendel’s Peas Plan: Discovering the Laws of Inheritance
Beating the odds with genetics
When you try to predict the outcome of a certain
event, like a coin flip or the gender of an unborn
child, you’re using probability. For many events,
the probability is either-or, like a baby can be
either male or female, and a coin can land either
heads or tails. Both outcomes are considered
equally likely (as long as the coin isn’t rigged
somehow). For many events, however, deter-
mining the likelihood of a certain outcome is
more complicated. Deciding how to calculate
the odds depends on what you want to know.
Take, for example, predicting the gender of sev-
eral children born to a given couple. The prob-
ability of any baby being a boy is 1⁄2, or 50 percent.
If the first baby is a boy, the probability of the
second child being a boy is still 50 percent
because the events that determine gender are
independent from one child to the next (see
Chapter 2 for a rundown of how meiosis works
to produce gametes for sex cells). That means
the gender of one child has no effect on the
gender of the next child. But if you want to know
the probability of having two boys in a row, you
multiply the probability of each independent
event together: 1⁄2 × 1⁄2 = 1⁄4, or 25 percent. If you
want to know the probability of having two boys
or two girls, you add the probabilities of the
events together: 1⁄4 (the probability of having two
boys) + 1⁄4 (the probability of having two girls) =
1⁄2, or 50 percent.
Genetic counselors use probability to determine
the likelihood that someone has inherited a given
trait and the likelihood that a person will pass on
a trait if he or she has it. For example, a man and
woman are each carriers for a recessive disor-
der, such as cystic fibrosis. The counselor can
predict the likelihood that the couple will have
an affected child. Just as in Mendel’s flower
crosses, each parent can produce two kinds of
gametes, affected or unaffected. The man pro-
duces half affected and half unaffected gametes,
as does the woman. The probability that any
child inherits an affected allele from the mom
and an affected allele from the dad is 1⁄4 (that’s
1⁄2 × 1⁄2). The probability that a child will be affected
and female is 1⁄8 (that’s 1⁄4 × 1⁄2). The probability a
child will be affected or a boy is 3⁄4 (that’s 1⁄4 + 1⁄2).

Solving Simple Genetics Problems
Every genetics problem, from those on an exam to determining what coat color
your dog’s puppies may have, can be solved in the same manner. Here’s a
simple approach to any genetics problem:
1. Determine how many traits you’re dealing with.
2. Count the number of phenotypes.
3. Carefully read the problem to identify the question. Do you need to
calculate genetic or phenotypic ratios? Are you trying to determine
something about the parents or the offspring?
4. Look for words that mean and and or to help determine which proba-
bilities to add and which to multiply.
Deciphering a monohybrid cross
Imagine that you have your own pea patch full of the same sort of peas that
Mendel used in his experiments. After reading this book, you’re filled with
enthusiasm for genetics, so you rush out to count pea pods, having noticed that
some plants have inflated pods and others have constricted pods. You know
that last year you had one plant with inflated pods and that this year’s plants
are the offspring of last year’s one inflated-pod plant (which self-fertilized).
After counting pods, you discover that 37 of your plants have inflated pods,
and 13 have constricted pods. (For the gardening-impaired, inflated pods are
cylindrical, and constricted pods conform to the shape of the seeds inside
the pod.) What was the genotype of your original plant? What is the domi-
nant allele?
You’ve got two distinct phenotypes (constricted and inflated) of one trait, pod
shape. You can choose any symbol or letter you please, but often, geneticists
use a letter like c for constricted and then capitalize that letter for the other
allele.
One way to start solving the problem of constricted versus inflated pod shape
is to determine the ratio of one phenotype to the other. To calculate the ratios,
add the total number of offspring together, 37 + 13 = 50, and divide to deter-
mine the proportion of each phenotype, 37 ÷ 50 = 0.74, or 74 percent have
inflated pods. To verify your result, you can divide 13 by 50 to see that 26 per-
cent of the offspring have constricted pods, and 74 percent plus 26 percent
gives you 100 percent of your plants.
From this information alone, you’ve probably already realized (thanks to simple
probability) that your original plant must have been heterozygous and that
inflated is dominant over constricted. As I explain in the “Segregating alleles”
section earlier in this chapter, a heterozygous plant (Cc) produces two kinds
48
Part I: Genetics Basics 

of gametes (C or c) with equal probability (that is, half the time the gametes
are C and the other half they’re c). The probability of getting a homozygous
dominant (CC) genotype is 1⁄2 × 1⁄2 = 1⁄4 (that’s the probability of getting C twice:
C once and C a second time, like two coin flips in a row landing heads). The
probability of getting a heterozygous dominant (C and c, or c and C) is 1⁄2 × 1⁄2 =
1⁄4 (to get Cc) plus 1⁄2 × 1⁄2 = 1⁄4 (cC). The total probability of a plant with the dom-
inant phenotype (CC or Cc or cC) is 1⁄4 + 1⁄4 + 1⁄4 = 3⁄4. With 50 plants, you’d expect
37.5 of them to show the dominant phenotype — which is exactly what you
observed.
Tackling a dihybrid cross
To become more comfortable with the process of solving simple genetics
problems, you can tackle a problem that involves more than one trait: a 
dihybrid cross.
Here’s the problem scenario. In guinea pigs, black fur is dominant. (If you’re
a guinea pig breeder, please forgive my oversimplification.) In a fit of largess,
your mom gives you two amorous, identical guinea pigs: Lucy and Ricky.
Much to your surprise (well, okay, you read Sex For Dummies, so you’re not
surprised), Lucy and Ricky produce several offspring. The surprising part is
that not all the offspring look alike.
 One is white and has curly fur.
 Three are black and have curly fur.
 Three are white with smooth fur.
 Nine look just like Lucy and Ricky: black and smooth fur.
Besides the meaningful lesson about birth rates, what can you learn about
the genetics of coat color and texture of your guinea pigs?
First, how many traits are you dealing with? I haven’t told you anything about
the gender of your baby guinea pigs, so it’s safe to assume that sex doesn’t
have anything to do with the problem. (I take that back. Sex is the source of
the problem, but see Chapter 5 for more on the genetics of sex.) You’re deal-
ing with two traits: color of fur and texture of fur.
Each trait has two phenotypes: Fur can be black or white, and texture of fur
can be smooth or curly. In working through this problem, you’re told upfront
that black fur is a dominant trait, but you don’t get any information about 
texture.
The simplest method is to examine one trait at a time — in other words, look
at the monohybrid crosses. (Jump back to the section “Deciphering a mono-
hybrid cross” for a refresher.)
49
Chapter 3: Mendel’s Peas Plan: Discovering the Laws of Inheritance

Ricky and Lucy both have black fur. How many of their offspring have black
fur? Twelve of sixteen, and 12 ÷ 16 = 3⁄4, or 75 percent. That means there were
three black guinea pigs to every one white one.
Being identical in phenotype, Lucy and Ricky both have smooth coats. How
many babies had smooth coats? Twelve of sixteen. There’s that comfortingly
familiar ratio again! The ratio of smooth to curly is 3 to 1.
From your knowledge of monohybrid crosses, you’ve probably guessed that
Lucy and Ricky are heterozygous for coat color and, at the same time, are
heterozygous for coat texture. To be sure, you can calculate the probability of
certain genotypes and corresponding phenotypes of offspring for two guinea
pigs that are heterozygous at two loci (see Figure 3-6).
The phenotypic ratio observed in Lucy and Ricky’s offspring (9:3:3:1; see
Figure 3-6) is typical for the F2 generation in a dihybrid cross. The rarest 
phenotype is the one that’s recessive for both traits; in this case, white and
curly are both recessive. The most common phenotype is the one that is
dominant for both traits. The fact that nine of your sixteen baby guinea pigs
are black and smooth tells you that the probability of getting a particular
allele for color and a particular allele for coat texture is the product of two
independent events. Coat color and coat texture are coded by genes that are
inherited independently — as you would expect under the principle of inde-
pendent assortment.

 Making exceptions to simple inheritance
 Exploring how genes interact
N
early 150 years have elapsed since Gregor Mendel cultivated his pea
plants. The observations he made and the conclusions he drew accu-
rately describe how genes are passed from parent to offspring. The basic laws
of inheritance — dominance, segregation, and independent assortment —
have stood the test of time. But inheritance isn’t nearly as simple as Mendel’s
experiments suggest. Dominant alleles don’t always dominate, and genes
aren’t always inherited independently. Some genes mask their appearances,
and some alleles can kill. This chapter explains exactly how Mendel was
right, and wrong, about the laws of inheritance and how they’re enforced.
Dominant Alleles Rule . . . Sometimes
If Mendel had chosen a plant other than the pea plant for his experiments, he
may have come to some very different conclusions. The traits that Mendel
studied show simple dominance — when the dominant allele’s phenotype, or
physical trait (a yellow seed, for example), masks the presence of the reces-
sive allele. The recessive phenotype (a green seed in this example) is only
expressed when both alleles are recessive (which is written as yy in Chapter 3).
(Take a look back at Chapter 3 for the definitions of commonly used genetics
terms such as allele, recessive, and homozygote.) But not all alleles behave
neatly as dominant-recessive. Some alleles show incomplete dominance and
therefore seem to display a blend of phenotypes from the parents. This sec-
tion tells you how dominant alleles rule the roost — but only part of the time.

Wimping out with incomplete dominance
A trip to the grocery store can be a nice genetics lesson. Take eggplant, for
example. Eggplant comes in various shades of (mostly) purple that are cour-
tesy of a pair of alleles at a single locus interacting in different ways to express
the phenotype, purple fruit color. Dark purple and white colors are both the
result of homozygous alleles. Dark purple is homozygous for the dominant
purple allele (PP), and white is homozygous for the recessive allele (pp).
When crossed, dark purple and white eggplants yield light purple offspring —
the intermediate phenotype. This intermediate color is the result of the allele
for purple being incomplete in its dominance of the allele for white (which is
actually the allele for no color).
With incomplete dominance, the alleles are inherited in exactly the same way
they always are: One allele comes from each parent. But the way those alleles
are expressed — that is, the phenotype — is different. The alleles still con-
form to the principles of segregation and independent assortment. (You can
find out about exceptions to the independent assortment rules in the section
“Genes linked together” later in this chapter.)
Here’s how the eggplant cross works: The parent plants are PP (for purple)
and pp (for white). The F1 generation is all heterozygous (Pp) just as you’d
expect from Mendel’s experiments (see Chapter 3). If this were a case of
simple dominance, all the Pp F1 generation would be dark purple. But, in
this case of incomplete dominance, the F1 generation comes out light purple
(sometimes called violet). (Less purple pigment is produced by the heterozy-
gotes, making them lighter in color than homozygous purple plants.)
In the F2 (the result of crossing Pp with Pp), half the offspring have violet
fruits (corresponding with the Pp genotype). One-quarter of the offspring are
dark purple (PP) and one-quarter are white (pp) — these are the homozygous
offspring. Rather than the 3:1 phenotypic ratio (three dark purple eggplants
and one white eggplant) you’d expect to see with simple dominance, with
incomplete dominance, you see a 1:2:1 ratio (one dark purple eggplant, two
light purple eggplants, and one white eggplant) — the exact ratio of the under-
lying genotype (PP, Pp, Pp, pp).
Keeping it fair with codominance
When alleles share equally in the expression of their phenotypes, the inheri-
tance pattern is considered codominant. Both alleles are expressed fully as
phenotypes rather than experiencing some intermediate expression (like
what’s observed in incomplete dominance).
52
Part I: Genetics Basics 

One very good example of codominance is seen in human blood types. If you’ve
ever donated blood (or received a transfusion), you know that your blood
type is extremely important. If you receive the wrong blood type during a
transfusion, you can have a fatal allergic reaction. Blood types are the result
of proteins, called antigens, produced on the surfaces of red blood cells.
Antigens protect you from disease in that they recognize invading cells
(like bacteria) as foreign, bind to the cells, and destroy them.
The antigens you possess determine your blood type. Several alleles code for
blood antigens. Two familiar blood types, A and B, are coded by dominant
alleles. When a person has both A and B alleles, his or her blood produces
both antigens simultaneously and in equal amounts. Therefore, a person who
has an AB genotype also has the AB phenotype.
The situation with ABO blood types gets even more complicated by the pres-
ence of a third allele for type O in some folks. The O allele is recessive, so
ABO blood types show two sorts of inheritance:
 Codominance (for A and B)
 Dominant-recessive (A or B paired with the O allele)
Type O is only expressed in the homozygous state. For more information on
multiple alleles, check out the section “More than two alleles” later in this
chapter.
Dawdling with incomplete penetrance
Some dominant alleles don’t express their influence consistently. When domi-
nant alleles are present but fail to show up as phenotype, the condition is
termed incompletely penetrant. Penetrance is defined as the probability that
an individual having a dominant allele will show the associated phenotype.
Complete penetrance, means every person having the allele shows the phe-
notype. Most dominant alleles have 100 percent penetrance — that is, the
phenotype is expressed in every individual possessing the allele.
One incompletely penetrant trait that shows up in humans is polydactyly,
the condition of having extra fingers and toes beyond the usual ten each.
Polydactyly is inherited as an autosomal (nonsex chromosomal) dominant
trait, and men and women inherit the trait with equal frequency. Unlike most
dominant traits, however, the inheritance of extra fingers and toes appears
to skip generations because the allele doesn’t always express the phenotype.
For example, in one group of people examined for polydactyly, the trait showed
up in 65 percent of people with the allele.
53
Chapter 4: Law Enforcement: Mendel’s Laws Applied to Complex Traits

Geneticists usually talk about penetrance in terms of a percentage. In this
example, polydactyly is 65 percent penetrant.
Breast cancer is another trait that’s incompletely penetrant. One mutation
(see Chapter 14 for more details) that can cause breast cancer is inherited
as an autosomal dominant trait. However, penetrance is roughly 60 percent
in persons carrying the allele, meaning that around 60 percent of persons 
carrying the allele will actually have breast cancer in their lifetimes.
Regardless of penetrance, when a trait is expressed, the degree to which the
allele expresses the phenotype may differ from individual to individual; this
variable strength of a trait is called expressivity. In persons with polydactyly,
the expressivity of the trait is measured by the completeness of the extra
digits — some people have tiny skin tags, and others have fully functional
extra fingers or toes.
Alleles Causing Complications
The variety of forms that genes (as alleles) take accounts for the enormous
diversity of physical traits you see in the world around you. There are many
alleles for eye color and hair color, for example. In addition, several loci 
contribute to most phenotypes. Dealing with multiple loci and many alleles
at each locus complicates patterns of inheritance and makes the patterns
harder to understand. For many disorders, the form of inheritance isn’t well
understood because the patterns are masked by variable expressivity and
incomplete penetrance. Additionally, multiple alleles can interact as incom-
pletely dominant, codominant, or dominant-recessive (see “Dominant Alleles
Rule . . . Sometimes” earlier in this chapter for the whole story). This section
explains how various alleles of a single gene can wreak havoc with inheritance
patterns.
More than two alleles
When it came to his pea plant research, Mendel deliberately chose to study
traits that came in only two flavors. For instance, his peas had only two flower
color possibilities: white and purple. The allele for purple in the common pea
plant is fully dominant, so it shows up as the same shade of purple in het-
erozygous plants as it does in homozygous plants. In addition to being fully
dominant, purple is completely penetrant, so every single plant that inherits
the gene for purple flowers has purple flowers.
If Mendel had been a rabbit breeder instead of a gardener, his would likely be
a different story. He may not have gotten the title “father of genetics” because
the broad spectrum of rabbit coat colors would make most anyone simply
throw up his hands.
54
Part I: Genetics Basics 

To simplify matters, consider one gene for coat color in bunnies. The C gene
has four alleles that control the amount of pigment produced in the hair shaft.
These four alleles give you four rabbit color patterns to work with. The vari-
ous rabbit color alleles are designated by the letter c with superscripts:
 Brown (c+): Brown rabbits are considered wild-type, which generally is
considered the “normal” phenotype. Brown rabbits are brown all over.
 Albino (c): White rabbits are homozygous for this color allele that doesn’t
produce any pigment at all. Therefore, white rabbits are considered albino.
They have all white coats, pink eyes, and pink skin.
 Chinchilla (cch): Chinchilla rabbits are solid gray (specifically, they have
white hair with black tips).
 Himalayan (ch): Himalayan rabbits are white but have dark hair on their
feet, ears, and noses.
Wild-type is a bit of a problematic term in genetics. Generally, wild-type is con-
sidered the “normal” phenotype, and everything else is “mutant.” Mutant is
simply different, an alternative form that’s not necessarily harmful. Wild-type
tends to be the most common phenotype and is usually dominant over other
alleles. You’re bound to see wild-type used in genetics books to describe phe-
notypes such as eye color in fruit flies, for example. Though rare, the mutant
color forms occur in natural populations of animals. In the case of domestic
rabbits, color forms other than brown are the product of breeding programs
specifically to obtain certain coat colors.
Although a particular trait can be determined by a number of different alleles
(as in the four allele possibilities for rabbit coat color), any particular animal
carries only two alleles at a particular locus at one time.
The C gene in rabbits exhibits a dominance hierarchy common among genes
with multiple alleles. Wild-type is completely dominant over the other three alle-
les, so any rabbit having the c+ allele will be brown. Chinchilla is incompletely
dominant over Himalayan and albino. That means heterozygous chinchilla/
Himalayan rabbits are gray with dark ears, noses, and tails. Heterozygous
chinchilla/albinos are lighter than homozygous chinchillas. Albino is only
expressed in animals that are homozygous (cc).
The color alleles in monohybrid crosses for rabbit color follow the same
rules of segregation and independent assortment that applied in the pea
plants that Mendel studied (see Chapter 3). The phenotypes for rabbit color
are just more complex. For example, if you were to cross an albino rabbit (cc)
with a homozygous chinchilla (cchcch), in the F2 generation (ccch mated with
ccch) you’d get the expected 1:2:1 genotypic ratio (1 cc to 2 ccch to 1 cchcch);
the phenotypes would show a corresponding 1:2:1 ratio (one albino, two light
chinchilla, one full chinchilla).
55
Chapter 4: Law Enforcement: Mendel’s Laws Applied to Complex Traits

Coat color in rabbits is actually controlled by a total of five genes. The section
“Genes in hiding” later in this chapter delves into how multiple genes interact
to create fur color.
Lethal alleles
Many alleles express unwanted traits (phenotypes) that indirectly cause suf-
fering and death (such as the excessive production of mucus in the lungs of
cystic fibrosis patients). Rarely, alleles may express the lethal phenotype —
that is, death — immediately and thus are never expressed beyond the zygote.
These alleles produce a 1:2 phenotypic ratio because only heterozygotes and
homozygous nonlethals survive to be counted.
The first lethal allele to be described by scientists was associated with yellow
coat color in mice. Yellow mice are always heterozygous. When yellow mice
are bred to other yellow mice, they produce yellow and non-yellow offspring in
a 2:1 ratio because all homozygous yellow mice die as embryos. Homozygous
yellow has no real phenotype (beyond dead) because these animals never
survive.
Lethal alleles are almost always recessive and thus are expressed only in
homozygotes. One notable exception is the gene that causes Huntington dis-
ease. Huntington disease (also known as Huntington chorea) is inherited as an
autosomal dominant lethal disorder, meaning that persons with Huntington
develop a progressive nerve disorder that causes involuntary muscle move-
ment and loss of mental function. Huntington is expressed in adulthood and
is always fatal. It has no cure; treatment is aimed at alleviating symptoms of
the disease.
Making Life More Complicated
Many phenotypes are determined by the action of more than one gene at a
time. Genes can hide the effects of each other, and sometimes one gene can
control several phenotypes at once. This section looks at how genes make
life more complicated (and more interesting).
When genes interact
If you don’t mind returning to the produce section of your local grocery store
(no more eggplants, I promise), you can observe the interaction of multiple
genes to produce various colors of bell peppers. Two genes (R and C) inter-
act to make these mild, sweet peppers appear red, brown, yellow, or green.
You see four phenotypes as the result of two alleles at each locus.
56
Part I: Genetics Basics 

Figure 4-1 shows the genetic breakdown of bell peppers. In the parental gen-
eration (P), you start with a homozygous dominant pepper (RRCC), which
is red, crossed with a homozygous recessive (rrcc) green pepper. (This is a
dihybrid cross — that is, one involving two genes — like the one described at
the end of Chapter 3.) To easily determine the expected genotypic ratios, you
can consider each locus separately. For the F1 generation, that’s really easy
to do because both loci will be heterozygous (RrCc). Just like homozygous
dominant peppers, fully heterozygous peppers are red. When the F1 peppers
are allowed to self-fertilize, the phenotypes of brown and yellow show up.
Brown pepper color is produced by the genotype R_cc. The blank means that
the R locus must have at least one dominant allele present to produce color,
but the other allele can be either dominant or recessive. Yellow is produced
by the combination rrC_. To make yellow pigment, the C allele must be either
heterozygous dominant or homozygous dominant with a recessive homozy-
gous R allele. The F2 generation shows the familiar 9:3:3:1 dihybrid phenotypic
ratio (just like the guinea pigs do in Chapter 3). The loci assort independently
just as you’d expect them to.
Genes in hiding
As the preceding section explains, in pepper color, the alleles of two genes
interact to produce color. But sometimes genes hide or mask the action of
other genes altogether. This occurrence is called epistasis.

Chapter 4: Law Enforcement: Mendel’s Laws Applied to Complex Traits

A good example of epistasis is the way in which color is determined in
horses. Like that of dogs, cats, rabbits, and humans, horse hair color is deter-
mined by numerous genes. At least seven loci determine color in horses.
To master epistasis in this section, you tackle the actions of only three genes:
W, A, and E (see Table 4-1 for a rundown of the genes and their effects). One
locus (W) determines the presence or absence of color. Two loci (E and A)
interact to determine the distribution of red and black hair — the most
common hair colors in horses.
A horse that carries one dominant allele for W will be albino — no color pig-
ments are produced, and the animal has white skin, white hair, and pink eyes.
(Homozygous dominant for the white allele is lethal; therefore, no living horse
possesses the WW genotype.) All horses that are some color other than white
are homozygous recessive (ww). (If you’re a horse breeder, you know that I’m
really oversimplifying here. Please forgive me.) Therefore, the dominant allele
W shows dominant epistasis because it masks the presence of other alleles
that determine color.
If a horse isn’t white (that is, not albino), then two main genes are likely
determining its hair color: E and A. When the dominant allele E is present, the
horse has black hair (it may not be black all over, but it’s black somewhere).
Black hair’s expressed because the E locus controls the production of two
pigments, red and black. EE and Ee horses produce both black and red pig-
ments. Homozygous recessive (ee) horses are red; in fact, they’re always red
regardless of what’s happening at the A locus. Thus, ee is recessive epistatic,
which means that in the homozygous recessive individual, the locus masks
the action of other loci. In this case, the production of black pigment is com-
pletely blocked.
When a horse has at least one dominant allele at the E locus, the amount of
black produced is controlled by the A locus. The A locus (also called agouti,
which is a dark brown color) controls the production of black pigments. A horse
with the dominant A allele produces black only on certain parts of its body
(often on its mane, tail, and legs — a pattern referred to as bay). Horses that are
aa are simply black. However, the homozygous recessive E locus (ee) masks
the A locus entirely (regardless of genotype), blocking black color completely.

Part I: Genetics Basics 

This example of the genetics of horse hair color proves that the actions of
genes can be very complex. In this one example, you see a lethal allele (W)
along with two other loci that can each mask the other under the right combi-
nation of alleles. This potential explains why it can be so difficult to determine
how certain conditions are inherited. Epistasis can act along with reduced
penetrance to create extremely elusive patterns of inheritance — patterns
that often can only be worked out by examining the DNA itself. (Genetic test-
ing is covered in Chapter 12.)
Genes linked together
Roughly 30 years after Mendel’s work was rediscovered in 1900 (see Chap-
ter 22 for the whole story) and verified by the scientific community, the
British geneticist Ronald A. Fisher realized that Mendel had been exception-
ally lucky — either that or he’d cheated. Of the many, many traits Mendel
could have studied, he published his results on seven traits that conform to
the laws of segregation and independent assortment, have two alleles, and
show dominant-recessive inheritance patterns. Fisher asserted that Mendel
must have published the part of his data he understood and left out the rest.
(After Mendel died, all his papers were burned, so we’ll never know the truth.)
The “rest” would include all the parts that make inheritance messy, like epis-
tasis and linkage.
Because of the way genes are situated along chromosomes, genes that are
very close together spatially (that is, fewer than 50 million base pairs apart;
see Chapter 6 for how DNA is measured in base pairs) are inherited together.
When genes are so close together that they’re inherited together (either all or
part of the time), the genes are said to be linked (see Figure 4-2). The occur-
rence of linked genes means that not all genes are subject to independent
assortment. To determine if genes are linked, geneticists carry out a process
called linkage analysis.

Chapter 4: Law Enforcement: Mendel’s Laws Applied to Complex Traits

The process of linkage analysis is really a determination of how often recombi-
nation (the mixing of information, also called crossing-over, contained on the
two homologous chromosomes; see Chapter 2) occurs between two or more
traits. If traits are close enough together on the chromosome, they end up being
linked more than 50 percent of the time. However, genes on the same chromo-
some can behave as if they were on different chromosomes because, during the
first stage of meiosis (see Chapter 2), crossing-over occurs at many points along
the two homologous chromosomes. If crossing-over splits two loci up more than
50 percent of the time, the genes on the same chromosome appear to assort
independently as if the genes were on different chromosomes altogether.
Generally, linkage analysis is done by examining dihybrid crosses (dihybrid
means two loci; see Chapter 3) between a heterozygote and a homozygote.
If you want to determine the linkage between two traits in fruit flies, for exam-
ple, you choose an individual that’s AaBb and cross it with one that’s aabb.
If the two loci, A and B, are assorting independently, you can expect to see
the results shown in Figure 4-3. The heterozygous parent produces four types
of gametes — AB, aB, Ab, ab — with equal frequency. The homozygous parent
can only make one sort of gamete — ab. Thus, in the F1 offspring, you see a
1:1:1:1 ratio.

But what if you see a completely unexpected ratio, like the one shown in
Table 4-2? What does that mean? These results indicate that the traits are
linked.
As you can see in Figure 4-4, the dihybrid parent makes four sorts of gametes.
Even though the loci are on the same chromosome, the gametes don’t occur
in equal frequency. Most of the gametes show up just as they do on the chro-
mosome, but crossover occurs between the two loci roughly 20 percent of
the time, producing the two rarer sorts of gametes (each is produced about
10 percent of the time). Crossover occurs with roughly the same frequency in
the homozygous parent, too, but because the alleles are the same, the results
of those crossover events are invisible. Therefore, you can safely ignore that
part of the problem.

Chapter 4: Law Enforcement: Mendel’s Laws Applied to Complex Traits

To calculate map distance, or the amount of crossover, between two loci, you
divide the total number of recombinant offspring by the total number of off-
spring observed. The recombinant offspring are the ones that have a genotype
different from the parental genotype. This calculation gives you a proportion:
percent recombination. One map unit distance on a chromosome is equal to
1 percent recombination. Generally, one map unit is considered to be 1 million
base pairs long.
As it turns out, four of the traits Mendel studied were situated together on
chromosomes. Two traits were on chromosome 1, and two were on chromo-
some 4; however, the genes were far enough apart that recombination was
greater than 50 percent. Thus all four traits appeared to assort independently
just as they would have if they’d been on four different chromosomes.
One gene with many phenotypes
Certain genes can control more than one phenotype. Genes that control 
multiple phenotypes are pleiotropic. Pleiotropy is very common; almost
any major single gene disorder listed in Online Mendelian Inheritance in
Man (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=OMIM) shows
pleiotropic effects.
Take, for example, phenylketonuria (PKU). This disease is inherited as a single
gene defect and is autosomal recessive. When persons with the homozygous
recessive phenotype consume substances containing phenylalanine, their
bodies lack the proper biochemical pathway to break down the phenylalanine
into tyrosine. As a result, phenylalanine accumulates in the body, preventing
normal brain development. The primary phenotype of persons with PKU is
mental retardation, but the impaired biochemical pathway affects other phe-
notypic traits as well. Thus, PKU patients also exhibit light hair color, unusual
patterns of walking and sitting, skin problems, and seizures. All the phenotypic
traits associated with PKU are associated with the single gene defect rather
than the actions of more than one gene (see Chapter 12 for more details
about PKU).
Uncovering More Exceptions 
to Mendel’s Laws
As inheritance of genetic disorders is better studied, many exceptions to strict
Mendelian inheritance rules arise. This section addresses three important
exceptions.
62
Part I: Genetics Basics 

Genomic imprinting
When traits are inherited on autosomal chromosomes, they’re generally
expressed equally in males and females. In some cases, the gender of the
parent who contributes the particular allele may affect how the trait is
expressed; this is called genomic imprinting.
Sheep breeders in Oklahoma discovered an amusing example of genomic
imprinting. A ram named Solid Gold had unusually large hindquarters for his
breed. Eventually, Solid Gold sired other sheep, which also had very large . . .
butts. The breed was named Callipyge, which is Greek for “beautiful butt.”
It turns out that six genes affect rump size in sheep. As breeders mated
Callipyge sheep, it quickly became clear that the trait didn’t obey Mendel’s
rules. Eventually, researchers determined that the big rump phenotype resulted
only when the father passed on the trait. Callipyge ewes can’t pass their big
rumps on to their offspring.
The reasons behind genomic imprinting are still unclear. In the case of Callipyge
sheep, scientists think there may be a mutation in a gene that regulates other
genes, but why the expression of the gene is controlled by only paternal chro-
mosomes remains a mystery. (Genomic imprinting is a big issue in cloning as
well; see Chapter 20 for more on that topic.)
Anticipation
Sometimes traits seem to grow stronger and gain more expressivity from one
generation to the next. The strengthening of a trait as it’s inherited is called
anticipation. Schizophrenia is a disorder that’s highly heritable and often shows
a pattern of anticipation. It affects a person’s mood and how she views herself
and the world. Some patients experience vivid hallucinations and delusions
that lead them to possess strongly held beliefs such as paranoia or grandeur.
The age of onset of schizophrenic symptoms and the strength of the symp-
toms tend to increase from one generation to the next.
The reason behind anticipation in schizophrenia and other disorders, such
as Huntington disease, may be that during replication (covered in Chapter 7),
repeated sections of the DNA within the gene are easily duplicated by accident
(see Chapter 13 for more on mutation by duplication). Thus, in successive
generations, the gene actually gets longer. As the gene grows longer, its effects
get stronger as well, leading to anticipation. In disorders affecting the brain,
the mutation leads to malformed proteins (see Chapter 9 for how genes are
translated into protein). The malformed proteins accumulate in the brain
cells, eventually causing cells to die. Because the malformed proteins may
get larger in successive generations, the effects either show up when the
person is young or with a more severe form of the disease.
63
Chapter 4: Law Enforcement: Mendel’s Laws Applied to Complex Traits

Environmental effects
Most traits show little evidence of environmental effect. However, the pheno-
type produced by some genes is completely controlled by the environment the
organism lives in. For example, the gene that gives a Himalayan rabbit its char-
acteristic phenotype of dark feet, ears, and tail is a good example of a trait that
varies in its expression based on the animal’s environment. The pigment 
that produces dark fur in any animal results from the presence of an enzyme
that’s produced throughout the animal’s body. But in this case, the enzyme’s
effect is deactivated at normal body temperature. Thus, the allele that pro-
duces pigment in the rabbit’s fur is expressed only in parts of the body that
are cooler than the rest; thus, Himalayan rabbits are all white when they’re
born (because they’ve been kept warm while inside their mother’s body) but
get dark noses, ears, and feet later in life. (Himalayans also change color sea-
sonally and get lighter during the warmer months.)
Phenylketonuria (see “One gene with many phenotypes” earlier in this chapter)
and other disorders of metabolism also depend on environmental factors, such
as diet, for the expression of the trait.

The Subject of Sex
In This Chapter
 Determining sex in humans and other animals
 Sorting out disorders associated with sex chromosomes
 Appreciating how sex affects other traits
S
ex is a term with many meanings. For geneticists, sex usually refers to
two related concepts: the phenotype of sex (either male or female) and
reproduction. It’s hard to underestimate the importance of sex when it comes
to genetics. Sex influences the inheritance of traits from one generation to the
next and how those traits are expressed. Sexual reproduction allows organisms
to create an amazing amount of genetic diversity via their offspring, which is
handy because genetically diverse populations are more resilient in the face of
disease and disaster. Many different individuals carrying many different alle-
les of the same genes increases the likelihood that some individuals will be
resistant to disease and the effects of disaster and will pass that resistance
on to their offspring. (For more on the importance of genetic diversity, flip to
Chapter 17.)
In this chapter, you discover how chromosomes act to determine sex in
humans and other organisms, how sex influences the expression of various
nonsex (autosomal) traits, and what happens when too many or too few sex
chromosomes are present.
How You Got So Sexy
Presumably since the beginning of time, humans have been aware of the dis-
similarities between the sexes. But it wasn’t until 1905 that Nettie Stevens
stared through a microscope long enough to discover the role of the Y chro-
mosome in the grand scheme of things. Until Stevens came along, the much
larger X chromosome was credited for creating all the celebrated differences
between males and females.

From a genetics standpoint, the phenotypes of sex, male and female, depend
on which type of gamete an individual produces. If an individual produces
sperm (or has the potential to, when mature), it’s considered male. If the indi-
vidual can produce eggs, it’s considered female. Some organisms are both male
and female (that is, they’re capable of producing viable eggs and sperm); this
situation is referred to as monoecy (pronounced mo-knee-see, which means
“one house”). Many plants, fish, and invertebrates (organisms lacking a bony
spine like yours) are monoecious (mo-knee-shus).
Humans are dioecious (di-ee-shus; literally “two houses”), meaning that indi-
viduals have either functional male or female reproductive structures, but not
both. Most of the species you’re familiar with are dioecious: Mammals, many
plants, insects, birds, and reptiles all have separate genders.
Organisms with separate genders get their sex phenotypes in various ways.
 Chromosomal sex determination occurs when the presence or absence
of certain chromosomes control sex phenotype.
 Genetic sex determination occurs when particular genes control sex
phenotype.
 The environment an organism develops in may determine its gender.
This section examines how chromosomes, genetics, and the environment
determine whether an organism is male or female.

Part I: Genetics Basics 
X marks the spot
Hermann Henking discovered the X chromo-
some while studying insects in the early 1890s.
He wasn’t quite sure what the lonely, unpaired
structure did, but it seemed different from the rest
of the chromosomes he was looking at. So rather
than assign it a number (chromosomes are gen-
erally numbered according to size, largest to
smallest), he called it X. In the early 1900s,
Clarence McClung decided, rightly, that Henking’s
X was actually a chromosome, but he wasn’t
quite sure of its role. McClung started calling X the
accessory chromosome.On the other hand, what
we know as the Y chromosome carried the cum-
bersome moniker of “small ideochromosome.”
The prefix ideo- means unknown — in other
words, McClung and other geneticists of the
time had no idea what the little Y guy was for.
Edmund Wilson discovered XX-XY sex determi-
nation in insects in 1905 (independent of Nettie
Stevens, who accomplished the same feat that
year). Wilson seems to have had the honor of
naming the Y chromosome. According to three
genetics historians I consulted on the topic,
Wilson first used the name Y in 1909. There was
nothing romantic about the Y designation; it was
just convenient shorthand. The new name caught
on rapidly, and by 1914 or so, all geneticists
were calling the two sex chromosomes X and Y.

X-rated: Sex determination in humans
In humans and most other mammals, both males and females have the same
overall number of chromosomes (humans have 46) in pairs (making humans
diploid). Sex phenotype is determined by two sex chromosomes: X and Y.
(Figure 5-1 shows the basic size and shape of these chromosomes.) Female
humans have two X chromosomes, and male humans have one X and one Y.
Check out the sidebar “X marks the spot” for how X and Y got their names.
(Chromosomes have their stereotypical sausage shapes only during metaphase
of mitosis or meiosis. Check out Chapter 2 for more details.)
Sexy X
During metaphase, the X chromosome truly has an x-shape, with the 
centromere placed roughly in the middle (see Chapter 2 for more about 
chromosomes and their shapes). Genetically speaking, unlike the relatively
puny Y chromosome, X is quite large. Of the 23 pairs of chromosomes
ordered by size, X occupies the eighth place, weighing in at slightly over
150 million base pairs long. (See Chapter 6 for more about how DNA is mea-
sured in base pairs.)
The X chromosome is home to between 900 and 1,200 genes and is incredibly
important for normal human development. When no X is present, the zygote
can’t commence development. Table 5-1 lists a few of X’s genes that are required
for survival. Surprisingly, only one gene on X has a role in determining female
phenotype; all the other genes that act to make females are found on the
autosomal (nonsex) chromosomes.

In all mammals (including humans), the developing embryo starts in what
developmental biologists refer to as an indifferent stage, meaning the embryo
has the potential to be either male or female. Here’s how sex determination
in mammals works: In roughly the fourth week of development, the embryo
begins to develop a region near the kidneys called the genital ridge. Three
genes (all on autosomes) kick in to convert the genital ridge tissue into tissue
that can become sex organs. The tissue that is present by week seven in the
embryo’s development is called the bipotential gonad because it can become
either testes or ovary tissue depending upon which genes act next.
If the embryo has at least one X and lacks a Y chromosome, two genes work
together to give the embryo the female phenotype. The first gene, called DAX1,
is found on the X chromosome. The second gene, WNT4, is found on chromo-
some 1. Together, these genes stimulate the development of ovary tissue. The
ovary tissue excretes the hormone estrogen, which turns on other genes that
control the development of the remaining female reproductive structures.
Little Y
In comparison to X, the Y chromosome is scrawny, antisocial, and surpris-
ingly expendable. Y contains between 70 and 300 genes along its 50-million
base pair length and is generally considered the smallest and least gene-rich
human chromosome. Most of Y doesn’t seem to code for any genes at all;
slightly over half the Y chromosome is junk DNA. Individuals with only one
X and no Y survive the condition (known as Turner syndrome, see the section
“Disorders of Sex Determination in Humans” later in this chapter), demon-
strating that Y supports no genes required for survival. Almost all the genes
Y has are involved in male sex determination and sexual function.
Unlike the other chromosomes, most of Y doesn’t recombine during meiosis
(see Chapter 2 for details) because Y is so different from X — there are only
small regions at the telomeres (the tips of chromosomes) that allow X and Y to
pair during meiosis. Pairs of human chromosomes are considered homologous,
68
Part I: Genetics Basics 

meaning the members of each pair are identical in structure and shape, and
contain similar (although not identical) genetic information. X and Y are not
homologous — they’re different in size and shape and carry completely dif-
ferent sets of genes. Homologous autosomes can freely swap information
during meiosis (a process referred to as crossing-over), but X and Y don’t
share enough information to allow crossing-over to occur. X and Y do pair up
as if they were homologous so that the right number of chromosomes gets
parsed out during meiosis (see Chapter 2).
Because Y doesn’t recombine with other chromosomes, it’s unusually good
for tracing how men have traveled and settled around the world. The Y chro-
mosome is even helping to rewrite British history. For centuries, people have
believed that Anglo-Saxons conquered Britain and more or less ran everyone
else out. In a 2003 survey of 1,700 British men, however, geneticists found evi-
dence that most descended from the Celts — the original inhabitants of the
British Isles. Y-chromosome studies have also helped revise American history;
take a look at Chapter 18 for more details on how Y settled a long-standing
debate about President Thomas Jefferson.
The most important of Y’s genes is SRY, the Sex-determining Region Y gene,
which was discovered in 1990. The SRY gene is what makes men. SRY codes
for a mere 204 amino acids (flip ahead to Chapter 9 for how the genetic code
works to make proteins from amino acids). Unlike most genes (and most of Y,
for that matter), SRY is junk-free — it contains no introns (sequences that
interrupt the expressed part of genes; see Chapter 8 for a full description).
SRY’s most important function is starting the development of testes. Embryos
that have at least one Y chromosome differentiate into males when the SRY
gene is turned on during week seven of development. SRY acts with at least
one other gene (on chromosome 17) to stimulate the expression of male phe-
notype in the form of testes. The testes themselves secrete testosterone, the
hormone responsible for the expression of most traits belonging to males.
(To find out how gene expression works, flip to Chapter 10.)
Surprising ways to get sex: Sex 
determination in other organisms
In mammals, sex determination is directed by the presence of sex chromo-
somes that turn on the appropriate genes to make male or female phenotypes.
In most other organisms, however, sex determination is highly variable. This
section looks at how various arrangements of chromosomes, genes, and even
temperature affect the determination of sex.
69
Chapter 5: The Subject of Sex

Insects
When geneticists first began studying chromosomes in the early 1900s,
insects were the organisms of choice. Grasshopper, beetle, and especially
fruit fly chromosomes were carefully stained and studied under microscopes
(check out Chapter 15 for how geneticists study chromosomes). Much of
what we now know about chromosomes in general and sex determination in
particular comes from the work of these early geneticists.
In 1901, Clarence McClung determined that female grasshoppers had two X
chromosomes, but males had one (take a look at the sidebar “X marks the
spot” for more about McClung’s role in discovering the sex chromosomes).
This arrangement now known as XX-XO, with the O representing a lack of a
chromosome, occurs in many insects. For these organisms, the number of X
chromosomes in relation to the autosomal chromosomes determines maleness
or femaleness. Two doses of X produce a female. One X produces a male.
In the XX-XO system, females (XX) are homogametic, which means that every
gamete (in this case, eggs) that the individual produces has the same set of
chromosomes composed of one of each autosome and one X. Males (XO) are
heterogametic. Their sperm can come in two different types (which is where the
hetero- part comes from). Half of a male’s gametes have one set of autosomes
and an X; the other half have one set of autosomes and no sex chromosome
at all. This imbalance in the number of chromosomes is what determines sex
for XX-XO organisms.
A similar situation occurs in fruit flies. Male fruit flies are XY, but the Y doesn’t
have any sex-determining genes on it. Instead, sex is determined by the number
of X chromosomes compared to the number of sets of autosomes. The number
of X chromosomes (it’s easier to think of this as the number of doses of X)
an individual has is divided by the number of sets of autosomes (sometimes
referred to as the haploid number, n; see Chapter 2). This equation is the X to
autosome (A) ratio, or X:A ratio. If the X:A ratio is 1⁄2 or less, the individual is
male. For example, an XX fly with two sets of autosomes would yield a ratio
of 1 (2 divided by 2) and would be female. An XY fly with two sets of autosomes
would yield a ratio of 1⁄2 (1 divided by 2) and would be male.
Bees and wasps have no sex chromosomes at all. Instead, sex is determined
by whether the individual is diploid (with paired chromosomes) or haploid
(with a single set of chromosomes). Females develop from fertilized eggs and
are diploid. Males develop from unfertilized eggs and are therefore haploid.
Birds
Like humans, birds have two sex chromosomes: Z and W. Female birds are
ZW, and males are ZZ. Sex determination in birds isn’t well understood; two
genes, one on the Z and the other on the W, both seem to play roles in whether
an individual becomes male or female. The Z-linked gene suggests that like
the XX-XO system in insects (see the preceding section), the number of Z
70
Part I: Genetics Basics 

chromosomes may help determine sex (but with reversed results from XX-
XO). On the other hand, the W-linked gene suggests the existence of a
“female-determining” gene. The recently completed (as of this writing)
chicken genome sequence (see Chapter 11 for the scoop) will provide critical
information for geneticists to learn how sex is determined in birds. (The situ-
ation of sex determination gets even more complex for some bird-like ani-
mals, check out the sidebar “All of the above.”)
Reptiles
Most reptiles (like snakes and lizards) have their sex determined by sex 
chromosomes. However, most turtles and all crocodiles and alligators have
their sex determined by the temperature the eggs experience during incu-
bation. Female turtles and crocodilians dig nests and bury their eggs in the
ground. Females usually choose nest sites in open areas likely to receive a lot
of sunlight. Female turtles don’t bother to guard their eggs; they lay ’em and
forget ’em. Alligators and crocodiles, on the other hand, guard their nests
(quite aggressively, as I can personally attest) but let the warmth of the sun
do the work.
71
Chapter 5: The Subject of Sex
Location, location, location
Some organisms have location-dependent sex
determination, meaning the organism becomes
male or female depending on where it ends up.
Take the slipper limpet, for example. Slipper
limpets (otherwise known by their highly sug-
gestive scientific name of Crepidula fornicata)
have concave, unpaired shells and cling to rocks
in shallow seawater environments. (Basically,
they look like half of an oyster.) All young slip-
per limpets start out as male, but a male can
become female as a result of his (soon to be
her) circumstances. If a young slipper limpet
settles on bare rock, it becomes female. If a male
settles on top of another male, the one on the
bottom becomes a female to accommodate the
new circumstances. If a male is removed from
the top of a pile and placed on bare rock, he
becomes a she and awaits the arrival of a male.
After an individual becomes female, she’s stuck
with the change and is a female from then on.
Bonellia worms have an even stranger system
of sex determination. As larvae, ocean currents
sweep these worms along until they settle on the
ocean floor, where they live and grow into adult
worms. All Bonellia start as females. If a larvae
settles and finds itself near an adult female, it
crawls into her proboscis (essentially a long,
flexible snout) and develops into a tiny male
worm. The male lives its entire life inside the
female, more or less like a parasite. His only job
is to produce sperm to fertilize the female’s eggs.
Some fish also change sex depending on their
locations or their social situations. Blue-headed
wrasse, large reef fish familiar to many scuba
divers, change into females if a male is present.
If no male is around, or if the local male disap-
pears, large females change sex to become
males. The fish’s brain and nervous system con-
trol its ability to switch from one sex to another.
An organ in the brain called the hypothalamus
(you have one, too, by the way) regulates sex
hormones and controls growth of the needed
reproductive tissues.

In turtles, lower temperatures (78–82 degrees Fahrenheit) produce all males.
At temperatures over 86 degrees, all eggs become females. Intermediate tem-
peratures produce both sexes. Male alligators, on the other hand, are produced
only at intermediate temperatures (around 91 degrees). Cooler conditions
(84–88 degrees) produce only females; really warm temperatures (95 degrees)
produce all females also.
An enzyme called aromatase seems to be the key player in organisms with
temperature-dependent sex determination. Aromatase converts testosterone
into estrogen. When estrogen levels are high, the embryo becomes a female.
When estrogen levels are low, the embryo becomes male. Aromatase activity
varies with temperature. In some turtles, for example, aromatase is essen-
tially inactive at 77 degrees, and all eggs in that environment hatch as males.
When temperatures around the eggs get to 86 degrees, aromatase activity
increases dramatically, and all the eggs become females.
The increase in aromatase that makes reptiles female occurs only in the
animal’s brain. How changes in brain chemistry act to determine sex in these
animals still isn’t well understood. Humans also have a type of aromatase
enzyme that does essentially the same job — that is, it converts testosterone
into an estrogen (more specifically, into estradiol). In human males, estradiol
is necessary for normal brain development (females secrete estrogen and don’t
have to convert testosterone).

All of the above
It has a bill like a duck and lays eggs, but it has fur
and produces milk. This creature also produces
venom (like a snake) that’s excreted by males
from spurs on their hind limbs. Did I mention that
this thing can swim and senses electrical fields
in the water to find fish? Is it a mammal? A bird?
It’s a platypus, and not only does it boast a truly
strange combination of bird, reptile, and
mammal characteristics, but it also has one of
the most bizarre systems for determining sex.
Platypuses (or is it platypi?) have a whopping
ten sex chromosomes.
Platypuses are diploid. Males have 21 pairs of
chromosomes plus ten sex chromosomes: five
Xs and five Ys. Females have 21 pairs of chro-
mosomes (identical to those of males) plus ten
Xs. The fun doesn’t stop there. The SRY gene that
normally determines maleness in mammals —
and yes, the platypus is considered a mammal —
is totally absent. Instead, platypuses have a ver-
sion of the bird sex-determining gene that’s
located on one of the five X chromosomes.
The platypus’s ten sex chromosomes aren’t
really homologous (homology would mean the
chromosomes had been duplicated somehow).
Because the sex chromosomes aren’t all that
similar to each other, during meiosis in a male,
the Xs and Ys don’t pair up like sex chromosomes
usually do. Instead, the sex chromosomes of a
male platypus form chains to ensure that the
gametes get the right number of chromosomes
(females’ Xs seem to pair as usual). The details
of how the ten sex chromosomes work to make
male and female platypus phenotypes is still
unknown. Scientists hope that studying platy-
puses will help them better understand the
genetics of both mammals and birds.

Sex-Determination Disorders in Humans
Homologous chromosomes line up and part company during the first phase
of meiosis, which I explain in Chapter 2. The dividing up of chromosome pairs
ensures that each gamete gets only one copy of each chromosome and thus
that zygotes (created from the fusion of gametes; see Chapter 2) have one pair
of each chromosome without odd copies thrown in. But sometimes, mistakes
occur. Xs or Ys can get left out, or extra copies can remain. These chromosomal
delivery errors are caused by nondisjunction, which results when chromosomes
fail to segregate normally during meiosis. (Chapter 15 has more information
about nondisjunction and other chromosome disorders.)
Extra chromosomes can create all sorts of developmental problems. In organ-
isms that have chromosomal sex determination, like humans, male organisms
normally have only one X, giving them one copy of each gene on the X and
allowing some genes on the X chromosome to act like dominant genes when,
in fact, they’re recessive (take a look ahead at “X-linked disorders” for more).
Female organisms have to cope with two copies, or doses, of the X chromo-
some and its attendant genes. If both copies of a female’s X were active, she’d
get twice as much X-linked gene product as a male. (X-linked means any and
all genes found on the X chromosome.) The extra protein produced by two
copies of the gene acting at once derails normal development. The solution
to this problem is a process called dosage compensation, when the amount of
gene product is equalized in both sexes.
Dosage compensation is achieved in one of two ways:
 The organism increases gene expression on the X to get a double dose
for males. This is what happens in fruit flies, for example.
 The female inactivates essentially all the genes on one X to get a “half”
dose of gene expression.
Both methods equalize the amount of gene product produced by each sex.
In humans, dosage compensation is achieved by X inactivation; one entire
X chromosome is permanently and irreversibly turned off in every cell of a
female’s body.
X inactivation in humans is controlled by a single gene, called XIST (for X
Inactive-Specific Transcript), that lies on the X chromosome. When a female
zygote starts to develop, it goes through many rounds of cell division. When
the zygote gets to be a little over 16 cells in size, X inactivation takes place.
The XIST gene gets turned on and goes through the normal process of tran-
scription (covered in Chapter 8). The RNA produced when XIST is transcribed
isn’t translated into protein (see Chapter 9 for how translation works and what
it does). Instead, the XIST transcript binds directly to one of the X chromo-
somes to inactivate its genes (much like RNA interference; see Chapter 10 for
the details).
73
Chapter 5: The Subject of Sex

X inactivation causes the entire inactivated chromosome to change form;
it becomes highly condensed and genetically inert. Highly condensed chro-
mosomes are easy for geneticists to spot because they soak up a lot of dye
(see Chapter 15 for how geneticists study chromosomes using dyes). Murray
Barr was the first person to observe the highly condensed, inactivated X
chromosomes in mammals. Therefore, these inactivated chromosomes are
called Barr bodies.
There are two very important things to remember about X inactivation:
 In humans, X inactivation is random. Only one X remains turned on, but
which X remains on is left completely up to chance.
 If more than two Xs are present, only one remains completely active.
The ultimate result of X inactivation is that the tissues that arise from each
embryonic cell have a “different” X. Because females get one X from their
father and the other from their mother, their Xs are likely to carry different
alleles of the same genes. Therefore, their tissues may express different pheno-
types depending upon which X (mom’s or dad’s) remains active. This random
expression of X chromosomes is best illustrated in cats.
Calico and tortoiseshell cats both have patchy-colored fur (often orange and
black, but other combinations are possible). The genes that control these fur
colors are on the X chromosomes. Male cats are usually all one color because
they always have only one active X chromosome (and are XY). Females (XX),
on the other hand, also have one active X chromosome, but the identity of the
active X (maternal or paternal) varies over the cat’s body. Therefore, calico
females get a patchy distribution of color depending on which X is active
(that is, as long as her parents had different alleles on their Xs). If you have a
calico male cat, he possesses an extra X and has the genotype XXY. XXY cats
have normal phenotypes. Unlike cats, humans with extra sex chromosomes
have a variety of health problems, which are summarized later in this chapter.
Extra Xs
Both males and females can have multiple X chromosomes each with different
genetic and phenotypic consequences. When females have extra X chromo-
somes, the condition is referred to as Poly-X (poly meaning many). Poly-X
females tend to be taller than average and often have a thin build. Most Poly-X
women develop normally and experience normal puberty and normal menstru-
ation and fertility. Rarely, XXX (referred to as Triplo-X) females have mental
retardation; the severity of mental retardation and other health problems
experienced by Poly-X females increases with the number of extra Xs. About
one in every 1,000 girls are XXX.
74
Part I: Genetics Basics 

Males with multiple X chromosomes are affected with Klinefelter syndrome.
Roughly one in every 500 boys are XXY. Most often, males with Klinefelter
are XXY, but as many as four extra X chromosomes have been observed.
Like females, males affected by Klinefelter undergo X inactivation so that
only one X chromosome is active. However, the extra X genes act in the
embryo before X inactivation takes place. These extra doses of X genes are
responsible for the phenotype of Klinefelter. Generally, males with Klinefelter
are taller than average and have impaired fertility (usually they’re sterile).
Men with Klinefelter often have reduced secondary sexual characteristics
(such as less facial hair) and sometimes have some breast enlargement due
to impaired production of testosterone.

Extra Ys
Occasionally, human males have two or more Y chromosomes and one X
chromosome. Most XYY men have a normal male phenotype, but XYY men
are often taller and, as children, grow a bit faster than their XY peers. Studies
conducted during the 1960s and 1970s indicated that XYY men were more
prone to criminal activity than XY men. Since then, findings have documented
learning disabilities (XYY boys may start talking later than XY boys), but it
seems that XYY males are no more likely to commit crimes than XY males.
One X and no Y
In some cases, individuals end up with one X chromosome. Such individuals
have Turner syndrome and are female. Affected persons often never undergo
puberty and don’t acquire secondary sex characteristics of adult women
(namely breast development and menstruation), and they tend to have
short stature. In most other ways, girls and women with Turner syndrome
are completely normal. Occasionally, however, they have kidney or heart
defects. Turner syndrome (also referred to as Monosomy X, meaning only
one X is present) affects about one in 2,500 girls.

Chapter 5: The Subject of Sex

Sex-linked Inheritance
Sex not only controls an organism’s reproductive options; it also has a lot to
do with which genes are expressed and how. Sex-linked genes are ones that
are actually located on the sex chromosomes themselves. Some traits are
truly X- (such as hemophilia) or Y-linked (such as hairy ears). Other traits
are expressed differently in males and females even though the genes that
control the traits are located on nonsex chromosomes. This section explains
how sex influences (and sometimes controls) the phenotypes of various
genetic conditions.
X-linked disorders
Genes found on the X chromosome control X-linked traits. In 1910, Thomas H.
Morgan discovered X-linked inheritance while studying fruit flies. Morgan’s
observations made him doubt the validity of Mendelian inheritance (see
Chapter 3). His skepticism about Mendelian inheritance stemmed from the
fact that he kept getting unexpected phenotypic ratios when he crossed red-
and white-eyed flies. He thought the trait of white eyes was simply recessive,
but when he crossed red-eyed females with white-eyed males (see Figure 5-2),
he got all red-eyed flies — the exact result you’d expect from a monohybrid
cross. The F2 generation showed the expected 3:1 ratio, too.

Part I: Genetics Basics 

But when Morgan crossed white-eyed females with red-eyed males, all the
expected relationships fell apart. The F1 generation had a 1:1 ratio of white- to
red-eyed flies. In the F2, the phenotypic ratio of white-eyed to red-eyed flies
was also 1:1 — not at all what Mendel would have predicted. Morgan was
flustered until he looked at which sex showed which phenotype.
In Morgan’s F1 offspring from his white-eyed mothers and red-eyed fathers,
all the sons were white-eyed. Daughters of white-eyed females were red-eyed.
In the F2, Morgan got equal numbers of white- and red-eyed males and females.
Morgan was well aware of the work on sex chromosomes conducted by
Nettie Stevens and Edmund Wilson in 1905, and he knew that fruit flies have
XX-XY sex chromosomes. Morgan and his students examined the phenotypes
of 13 million fruit flies to confirm that the gene for eye color was located on
the X chromosome. (The next time you see a fruit fly in your kitchen, imagine
looking through a microscope long enough to examine 13 million flies!)
As it turns out, the gene for white eye color in fruit flies is recessive. The only
time it’s expressed in females is when it’s homozygous. Males, on the other
hand, show the trait when they have only one copy of the X-linked gene. For all
X-linked recessive traits, the gene acts like a dominant gene when it’s in the
hemizygous (one copy) state. Any male inheriting the affected X chromosome
shows the trait as if it were present in two copies. (X-linked dominant disorders
also occur; see Chapter 12 for the details.)
In humans, X-linked recessive disorders rarely show up in females. Instead, 
X-linked recessive traits affect sons of women who are carriers. To see the
distribution of X-linked recessive disorders, check out the family tree for the
royal families of Europe in Chapter 12. Queen Victoria was apparently a car-
rier for the X-linked gene that causes hemophilia. None of Queen Victoria’s
ancestors appear to have had hemophilia; geneticists think that the mutation
originated with Queen Victoria herself (see Chapter 13 for more about spon-
taneous mutations like these). Queen Victoria had one son with hemophilia
and two of her daughters were carriers.
Sex-limited traits
Sex-limited traits are inherited in the normal autosomal fashion but are never
expressed in one sex, regardless of whether the gene is heterozygous or
homozygous. Such traits are said to have 100 percent penetrance in one sex
and zero penetrance in the other. (Penetrance is the probability that an indi-
vidual having a dominant allele will show its effects; see Chapter 4 for more.)
Traits such as color differences between male and female birds are sex lim-
ited; both males and females inherit the genes for color, but the genes are
expressed only in one sex (usually the male). In mammals, both males and
females possess the genes necessary for milk production, but only females
express these genes, which are controlled by hormone levels in the female’s
body (see Chapter 10 for more about how gene expression is controlled).
77
Chapter 5: The Subject of Sex

One trait in humans that’s male-limited is precocious puberty. The corre-
sponding gene, located on chromosome 2, causes boys to undergo the
changes associated with teenage years, such as deeper voice and beard and
body hair growth, at very early ages (sometimes as young as 3 years of age).
The allele responsible for precocious puberty acts as an autosomal dominant,
but only in males. Females, regardless of genotype, never exhibit this kind of
precocious puberty.
Sex-influenced traits
Sex-influenced traits are coded by genes on autosomes, but the phenotype
depends on the sex of the individual carrying the affected gene. Sex-influenced
traits come down to the issue of penetrance: The traits are more penetrant in
males than females. Horns, hair, and other traits that make male organisms
look different from females are usually sex-influenced traits.
In humans, male-pattern baldness is a sex-influenced trait. The gene credited
with male hair loss is found on chromosome 15. Baldness is autosomal domi-
nant in men, and women only show the phenotype of hair loss when they’re
homozygous for the gene. The gene for male-pattern baldness has also been
implicated in polycystic ovary disease in women. Women with polycystic ovary
disease experience reduced fertility and other disorders of the reproductive
system. The gene seems to act as an autosomal dominant for ovarian disease
in women much as it does for male-pattern baldness in men, so women with
ovarian disease are usually heterozygous for the condition (and thus, not bald).
Y-linked traits
The Y chromosome carries few genes, and the genes it does carry are all related
to male sex determination. Therefore, most of the Y-linked traits discovered
so far have something to do with male sexual function and fertility. As you
may expect, Y-linked traits are passed strictly from father to son. All Y-linked
traits are expressed because the Y is hemizygous (having one copy) and
therefore has no other chromosome to offset gene expression. The amount of
penetrance and expressivity that Y-linked traits show varies (see Chapter 4
more details about penetrance and expressivity of autosomal dominant traits).
One trait that seems to be Y-linked but isn’t related to sexual function is hairy
ears. Men with hairy ears grow varying amounts of hair on their outer ears or
from the ear canals. The trait appears to be incompletely penetrant, meaning
not all sons of hairy-eared fathers show the trait. Hairy ears also show variable
expressivity from very hairy to only a few stray hairs. Aren’t you glad that
geneticists have focused the powers of science at their disposal on making
such important discoveries? Check the section “Little Y” for a rundown of
other Y-linked genes in humans and other mammals.

DNA: The Genetic
Material

In this part . . .
T
he double helix is almost an icon. All life on earth
depends on these elegant spiral staircases that hold
all the genetic information of each and every individual.
DNA’s massive storage capacity comes from how it’s put
together. The physical and chemical makeup of DNA con-
trols how it’s copied and how its message is passed on.
In this part, I explain how DNA gets copied and how the
messages are read and ultimately expressed as the traits
of the organisms you see every day. The genetic code
relies on DNA’s close cousin, RNA, to carry the important
messages of genes. The ultimate fate of DNA’s messages is
to create proteins, the building blocks of life. The follow-
ing chapters tell you all about how DNA’s blueprint is
assembled from start to finish.

Chapter 6
DNA: The Basis of Life
In This Chapter
 Identifying the chemical components of DNA
 Understanding the structure of the double helix
 Checking out different “sets” of DNA
A
llow me to introduce you to deoxyribonucleic acid, otherwise known as
DNA. If the title of this chapter hasn’t impressed upon you the impor-
tance and magnitude of those three little letters, consider that DNA is also
referred to as “the genetic material” or “the molecule of heredity.” And you
thought your title was impressive!
Every living thing on earth, from the smallest bacteria to the largest whale,
uses DNA to store genetic information and transmit that info from one gener-
ation to the next; a copy of some (or all) of every creature’s DNA is passed on
to its offspring. The developing organism then uses DNA as a blueprint to make
all its body parts. (Some non-living things use DNA to transmit information,
too; see the sidebar “DNA and the undead: The world of viruses” for details.)
To get an idea of how much information DNA stores, think about how complex
your body is. You have hundreds of kinds of tissues that all perform different
functions. It takes a lot of DNA to catalog all that. (See the section “Discovering
DNA,” later in this chapter, to find out how scientists learned that DNA is the
genetic material of all known life forms.)
The structure of DNA provides a simple way for the molecule to copy itself
(see Chapter 7) and protects genetic messages from getting garbled (see
Chapter 15). That structure is at the heart of forensic methods used to solve
crimes, too (see Chapter 18). But before you can start exploring genetic infor-
mation and applications of DNA, you need to have a handle on its chemical
makeup and structure. That’s where this chapter comes in. In this chapter, I
explore the essential makeup of DNA, how it’s put together, and the various
sets of DNA present in living things.

Deconstructing DNA
If you’re like most folks, when you think of DNA, you think of a double helix.
But DNA isn’t just a double helix; it’s a huge molecule — so huge that it’s called
a macromolecule. It can even be seen with the naked eye! (Check out the side-
bar “Molecular madness: Extracting DNA at home” for an experiment you can
do to see actual DNA.) If you were to lay out, end to end, all the DNA from just
one of your cells, the line would be a little over six feet long! You have roughly
100,000,000,000,000 cells in your body (that’s 100 trillion, for those of you
who don’t feel like counting zeros). Put another way, laid out altogether, the
DNA in your body would easily stretch to the sun and back — nearly 100 times!
You’re probably wondering how a huge DNA molecule can fit into a teeny tiny
cell so small that you can’t see it with the naked eye. Here’s how: DNA is tightly
packed in a process called supercoiling. Much like a phone cord that’s been
twisted around and around on itself, supercoiling takes DNA and wraps it
around proteins called nucleosomes. Other proteins, called histones, hold the
coils together. Together, the nuclesomes and histones form a structure simi-
lar to beads on a string. The whole “necklace” twists around itself so tightly
that over six feet of DNA is compressed into only a few thousandths of an inch.
Although the idea of a DNA path to the sun works great for visualizing the
size of the DNA molecule, an organism’s DNA usually doesn’t exist as one
long piece. Rather, strands of DNA are divided into chromosomes, which are
relatively short pieces. (I introduce chromosomes in Chapter 2 and discuss
related disorders in Chapter 15.) In humans and all other eukaryotes (organisms
whose cells have nuclei; see Chapter 2 for more), a full set of chromosomes
is stored in the nucleus of each cell. That means that practically every cell
contains a complete set of instructions to build the entire organism! The instruc-
tions are packaged as genes. A gene determines exactly how a specific trait
will be expressed. Genes and how they work are topics discussed in detail in
Chapter 10.
82
Part II: DNA: The Genetic Material 
DNA and the undead: The world of viruses
Viruses contain DNA, but they aren’t considered
living things. To reproduce, a virus must attach
itself to a living cell. As soon as the virus finds a
host cell, the virus injects its DNA into the cell and
forces that cell to reproduce the virus. A virus
can’t grow without stealing energy from a living
cell, and it can’t move from one organism to
another on its own. Although viruses come in all
sorts of fabulous shapes, they don’t have all the
components that cells do; in general, a virus is just
DNA surrounded by a protein shell. So a virus isn’t
alive, but it’s not quite dead either. Creepy, huh?

Cells with nuclei are found only in eukaryotes; however, not every eukary-
otic cell has a nucleus. For example, humans are eukaryotes, but human red
blood cells don’t have nuclei. For more on cells, flip to Chapter 2.
The tutorial offered at molvis.sdsc.edu/dna/index.htm, a site hosted by
the San Diego Supercomputing Center at the University of California-San Diego,
provides an excellent complement to the information on the structure of DNA
covered in this section, if you’re willing to download a plug-in or two. You can
access incredible, interactive views of precisely how DNA is put together to
form the double helix. A click-and-drag feature allows you to turn the molecule
in any direction in order to better understand the structure of the genetic
material.
Chemical components of DNA
DNA is a remarkably durable molecule; it can be stored in ice or in a fossilized
bone for thousands of years. DNA can even stay in one piece for as long as
100,000 years under the right conditions. This durability is why scientists can
recover DNA from 14,000-year-old mammoths and learn that the mammoth is
most closely related to today’s Asian elephants. (Scientists have recovered
ancient DNA from an amazing variety of organisms — check out the sidebar
“Still around after all these years: Durable DNA” for more.) The root of DNA’s
extreme durability lies in its chemical and structural makeup.
Chemically, DNA is really simple. It’s made of three components: nitrogen-rich
bases, deoxyribose sugars, and phosphates. The three components, which I
explain in the following sections, combine to form a nucleotide (see the section
“Assembling the double helix: The structure of DNA” later in this chapter.)
Thousands of nucleotides come together in pairs to form a single molecule
of DNA.
Covering the bases
Each DNA molecule contains thousands of copies of four specific nitrogen-
rich bases:
 Adenine (A)
 Guanine (G)
 Thymine (T)
 Cytosine (C)
83
Chapter 6: DNA: The Basis of Life

As you can see in Figure 6-1, the bases are comprised of carbon (C), hydrogen
(H), nitrogen (N), and oxygen (O) atoms.

Molecular madness: Extracting DNA at home
Using this simple recipe, you can see DNA right
in the comfort of your own home! You need a
strawberry, salt, water, two clear jars or juice
glasses, a sandwich bag, a measuring cup, a
white coffee filter, clear liquid soap, and rubbing
alcohol. (Other foods such as onions, bananas,
kiwis, and tomatoes also work well if strawber-
ries are unavailable.) When you’ve assembled
these ingredients, follow the steps below.
1. Put slightly less than 3⁄8 cup of water into the
measuring cup. Add 1⁄4 teaspoon of salt and
enough clear liquid soap to make 3⁄8 cup of
liquid altogether. Stir gently until the salt dis-
solves into the solution.
The salt provides sodium ions needed for
the chemical reaction that allows you to see
the DNA in Step 6. The soap causes the cell
walls to burst, freeing the DNA inside.
2. Remove the stem from the strawberry,
place the strawberry into the sandwich bag,
and seal the bag. Mash the strawberry thor-
oughly until completely pulverized (I rolled
a juice glass repeatedly over my strawberry
to pulverize it). Make sure you don’t punc-
ture the bag.
3. Add two teaspoons of the liquid soap-salt
solution to the bag with the strawberry and
reseal the bag. Mix gently by compressing
the bag or rocking the bag back and forth
for at least 45 seconds to one minute.
4. Pour the strawberry mixture through the
coffee filter into a clean jar. Let the mixture
drain into the jar for 10 minutes.
Straining gets rid of most of the cellular
debris (a fancy word for gunk) and leaves
behind the DNA in the clean solution.
5. While the strawberry mixture is draining,
pour 1⁄4 cup of rubbing alcohol into a clean jar
and put the jar in the freezer. After 10 minutes
have elapsed, discard the coffee filter and
pulverized strawberry remnants. Put the jar
with the cold alcohol on a flat surface where
it will be undisturbed and pour the strained
strawberry liquid into the alcohol.
6. Let the jar sit for at least 5 minutes and then
check out the result of your DNA experiment.
The cloudy substance that forms in the alco-
hol layer is the DNA from the strawberry.
The cold alcohol helps strip the water mole-
cules from the outside of the DNA molecule,
causing the molecule to collapse on itself
and “fall out” out of the solution.

The four bases come in two flavors:
 Purines: The two purine bases found in DNA are adenine and guanine.
If you were a chemist, you’d know that the word purine means a compound
composed of two rings (check out adenine’s and guanine’s structures in
Figure 6-1). If you’re like me (not a chemist), you’re likely still familiar
with one common purine: caffeine.
 Pyrimidines: The two pyrimidine bases found in DNA are thymine and
cytosine. The term pyrimidine refers to chemicals that have a single six-
sided ring structure (see thymine’s and cytosine’s structures in Figure 6-1).
Because they’re rings, all four bases are flat molecules. And as flat molecules,
they’re able to stack up in DNA much like a stack of coins. The stacking arrange-
ment accomplishes two things: It makes the molecule both compact and very
strong.
It’s been my experience that students and other folks get confused by spatial
concepts where DNA is concerned. In order to see the chemical structures
more easily, DNA is often drawn as if it were a flattened ladder. But in its true
state, DNA isn’t flat — it’s three-dimensional. Because DNA is arranged in
strands, it’s also linear. One way to think about this structure is to look at a
phone cord (that is, if you can find a phone that isn’t cordless). A phone cord
spirals in three dimensions yet it’s linear (rope-like) in form. That’s sort of the
shape DNA has, too.
The bases carry the information of DNA, but they can’t bond together by
themselves. Two more ingredients are needed: a special kind of sugar and
a phosphate.
Adding a spoonful of sugar and a little phosphate
In order to make a complete nucleotide (thousands of which combine to make
one DNA molecule), the bases must attach to deoxyribose and a phosphate
molecule. Deoxyribose is ribose sugar that has lost one of its oxygen atoms.
Figure 6-2 shows the structure of deoxyribose. When your body breaks down
Adenosine TriPhosphate (ATP), the molecule your body uses to power your
cells, ribose is released with a phosphate molecule still attached to it. Ribose
loses an oxygen atom to become deoxyribose and holds onto its phosphate
molecule, which is needed to transform a lone base into a nucleotide.

Chapter 6: DNA: The Basis of Life

Ribose (pictured in Figure 6-2) is the precursor for deoxyribose and is the
chemical basis for RNA (see Chapter 8). The only difference between ribose
and deoxyribose sugars is the presence or absence of an oxygen atom at
the 2’ site.
Chemical structures are numbered so you can keep track of where atoms,
branches, chains, and rings appear. On ribose sugars, numbers are followed
by an apostrophe (’) to indicate the designation “prime.” The addition of
“prime” prevents confusion with numbered sites on other molecules that
bond with ribose.
86
Part II: DNA: The Genetic Material 
Still around after all these years: Durable DNA
When an organism dies, it starts to decay and its
DNA starts to break down (for DNA, this means
breaking into smaller and smaller pieces). But if
a dead organism dries out or freezes shortly
after death, decay slows down or even stops.
Because of this kind of interference with decay,
DNA has been recovered from animals and
humans that roamed the earth as many as
100,000 years ago. This recovered DNA tells sci-
entists a lot about life and the conditions of the
world long ago. But even this very durable mole-
cule has its limits — about a million years or so.
Oddly, one of the best sources of ancient DNA is
poop. Yep, you heard me: poop. When an organ-
ism defecates, it sheds some intestinal cells
along with its feces. Thus, both the organism
and its diet can be studied from fossilized feces
(coprolites if you want to get technical; okay, I
admit it’s gross!). For example, fossilized feces
have yielded amazing insights about the lives of
ground sloths, elephant-sized mammals that lived
in North America until roughly 8,000 years ago.
Samples from Nevada show that ground sloths
occupied the same cave for over 20,000 years! As
the global climate changed, sloth diets changed,
too, allowing scientists to track changes in the
habitats of these giant herbivores.
Using DNA recovered from fossilized feces, sci-
entists can also study the diets of our human
ancestors. For example, researchers determined
that Native Americans living in southwestern
Texas 2,000 years ago had a diet of bighorn
sheep and pronghorn antelope in addition to
various plants growing in the region.
And to give you an example of DNA durability
that doesn’t have to do with poop (thank good-
ness!), in 1991, hikers in the Italian Alps discov-
ered a human body frozen in a glacier. As the
glacier melted, the retreating ice left behind a
secret concealed for over 5,000 years: an ancient
human. DNA has been recovered from this lonely
hunter, his clothing, and even the food in his
stomach. Apparently, red deer and ibex meat
were part of his last meal. His food was dusted
with pollen from nearby trees, so even the forest
he walked through can be identified! The Ice
Man, renamed Otzi, has yielded amazing insight
about what life was like in northern Italy thou-
sands of years ago.

Deoxy- means that an oxygen atom is missing from the sugar molecule and
defines the D in DNA. As an added touch, some authors write “2-” before the
“deoxy-” to indicate which site lacks the oxygen — the number 2 site, in this
case. The OH group at the 3’ site of both ribose and deoxyribose is a reactive
group. That means the oxygen atom at that site is free to interact chemically
with other molecules.
Assembling the double helix: 
The structure of DNA
Nucleotides are the true building blocks of DNA. In Figure 6-3, you see the three
components of a single nucleotide: one deoxyribose sugar, one phosphate,
and one of the four bases. (Flip back to “Chemical components of DNA” for
the details of these components.) To make a complete DNA molecule, single
nucleotides join to make chains that come together as matched pairs and form
long double strands. This section walks you through the assembly process.
To make the structure of DNA easier to understand, I start with how a single
strand is put together.

Chapter 6: DNA: The Basis of Life

DNA normally exists as a double-stranded molecule. In living things, new DNA
strands are always put together using a preexisting strand as a pattern (see
Chapter 7).
Starting with one: Weaving a single strand
Hundreds of thousands of nucleotides link together to form a strand of DNA.
But they don’t hook up haphazardly. Nucleotides are a bit like coins in that
they have two “sides” — a phosphate side and a sugar side. Nucleotides can
only make a connection by joining phosphates to sugars. The bases wind up
parallel to each other (stacked like coins) and the sugars and phosphates run
perpendicular to the stack of bases. A long strand of nucleotides put together
in this way is called a polynucleotide strand (poly meaning many). In Figure 6-4,
you can see how the nucleotides join together; a single strand would comprise
one-half of the two-sided molecule (the chain of sugars, phosphates, and one
of the pair of bases).
Because of the way the chemical structures are numbered, DNA has numbered
“ends.” The phosphate end is referred to as the 5’ (5-prime) end, and the sugar
end is referred to as the 3’ (3-prime) end. (If you missed the discussion on how
the chemical structure of deoxyribose is numbered, check out the section
“Adding a spoonful of sugar and a little phosphate,” earlier in this chapter.)
The bonds between a phosphate and two sugar molecules in a nucleotide
strand are collectively called a phosphodiester bond. This is a fancy way of
saying that two sugars are linked together by a phosphate in between.

Part II: DNA: The Genetic Material 

After they’re formed, strands of DNA don’t enjoy being single; they’re always
looking for a match. The arrangement in which strands of DNA match up is
very, very important. A number of rules dictate how two lonely strands of
DNA find their perfect matches and eventually form the star of the show, the
molecule you’ve been waiting for — the double helix.
Doubling up: Adding the second strand
A complete DNA molecule has
 Two side-by-side polynucleotide strands twisted together.
 Bases attached in pairs in the center of the molecule.
 Sugars and phosphates on the outside, forming a “backbone.”
If you were to untwist a DNA double helix and lay it flat, it would look a lot
like a ladder (see Figure 6-4). The bases are attached to each other in the
center to make the rungs, and the sugars are joined together by phosphates
to form the sides of the ladder. It sounds pretty straightforward, but this
ladder arrangement has some special characteristics.
If you were to separate the ladder into two polynucleotide strands, you’d see
that the strands are oriented in opposite directions (shown with arrows in
Figure 6-4). The locations of the sugar and the phosphate give nucleotides
heads and tails, two distinct ends. (If you skipped that part, it’s in the earlier
section “Starting with one: Weaving a single strand.”) The heads-tails (or in this
case, 5’-3’) orientation applies here. This head-to-tail arrangement is called
antiparallel, which is a fancy way of saying parallel and running in opposite
directions. Part of the reason the strands must be oriented this way is to
guarantee that the dimensions of the DNA molecule are even along its entire
length. If the strands were put together in a parallel arrangement, the angles
between the atoms would be all wrong, and the strands wouldn’t fit together.
The molecule is guaranteed to be the same size all over because the match-
ing bases complement each other, making whole pieces that are all the same
size. Adenine complements thymine, and guanine complements cytosine. The
bases always match up in this complementary fashion. Therefore, in every
DNA molecule, the amount of one base is equal to the amount of its comple-
mentary base. This condition is known as Chargaff’s rules (see the “Chargaff’s
rules” section later in the chapter for more on the discovery of these rules).
Why can’t the bases match up in other ways? First, purines are larger than
pyrimidines (see “Covering the bases” earlier in the chapter). So matching like
with like would introduce irregularities in the molecule’s shape. Irregularities
are bad because those “bumps in the road” can cause mistakes to be made
when the molecule is copied (see Chapter 15).

Chapter 6: DNA: The Basis of Life

An important result of the bases’ complementary pairing is the way in which
the strands bond to each other. Hydrogen bonds form between the base pairs.
The number of bonds between the base pairs differs; G-C pairs have three
bonds, and A-T pairs have only two. Figure 6-4 illustrates the structure of the
untwisted double helix, specifically the bonds between base pairs. Every DNA
molecule has hundreds of thousands of base pairs, and each base pair has
multiple bonds, so the rungs of the ladder are very strongly bonded together.
When inside a cell, the two strands of DNA gently twist around each other like
a spiral staircase (or a strand of licorice, or the stripes on a candy cane . . .
anybody else have a sweet tooth?). The antiparallel arrangement of the two
strands is what causes the twist. Because the strands run in opposite direc-
tions, they pull the sides of the molecule in opposite directions, causing the
whole thing to twist around itself.
Most naturally occurring DNA spirals clockwise, as you can see in Figure 6-5.
A full twist (or complete turn) occurs every ten base pairs or so, with the
bases safely protected on the inside of the helix. The helical form is one way
that the information that DNA carries is protected from damage that can result
in mutation.

Part II: DNA: The Genetic Material 

The helical form creates two grooves on the outside of the molecule (see
Figure 6-5). The major groove actually lets the bases peep out a little, which is
important when it’s time to read the information DNA contains (see Chapter 9).
Because base pairs in DNA are stacked on top of each other, chemical interac-
tions make the center of the molecule repel water. Molecules that repel water
are called hydrophobic (Greek for “afraid of water”). The outside of the DNA
molecule is just the opposite; it attracts water. The result is that the inside of
the helix remains safe and dry while the outside is encased in a “shell” of water.
There are a few additional details about DNA that you need to know:
 A DNA strand is measured by the number of base pairs it has.
 The sequence of bases in DNA isn’t random. The genetic information
in DNA is carried in the order of the base pairs. In fact, the genes are
encoded in the base sequences. Chapter 9 explains how the sequences
are read and decoded.
 DNA uses a preexisting DNA strand as a pattern or template in the
assembly process. DNA just doesn’t form on its own. The process of
making a new strand of DNA using a preexisting strand is called replica-
tion. Replication is covered in detail in Chapter 7.
Examining Different Sets of DNA
All DNA has the same four bases, obeys the same base pairing rules, and has
the same double helix structure. No matter where it’s found or what function
it’s carrying out, DNA is DNA. That said, different sets of DNA exist within a
single organism. These sets carry out different genetic functions. In this sec-
tion, I explain where the various DNAs are found and describe what they do.
Nuclear DNA
Nuclear DNA is DNA found in cell nuclei, and it’s responsible for the majority
of functions that cells carry out. Nuclear DNA carries codes for phenotype, the
physical traits of an organism (for a review of genetics terms, see Chapter 3).
Nuclear DNA is packaged into chromosomes and passed from parent to off-
spring (see Chapter 2). When scientists talk about sequencing the human
genome, they mean human nuclear DNA. (A genome is a full set of genetic
instructions; see Chapter 11 for more about the human genome.) The nuclear
genome of humans is comprised of the DNA from all 24 chromosomes (22 auto-
somes plus one X and one Y; see Chapter 2 for chromosome lingo).
91
Chapter 6: DNA: The Basis of Life

Mitochondrial DNA
Animals, plants, and fungi all have mitochondria (for a review of cell parts,
turn to Chapter 2). These powerhouses of the cell come with their own DNA,
which is quite different in form (and inheritance) from nuclear DNA (see the
preceding section). Each mitochondrion (the singular word for mitochondria)
has many molecules of mitochondrial DNA — mtDNA, for short.
Whereas human nuclear DNA is linear, mtDNA is circular (hoop-shaped).
Human mtDNA is very short (slightly less than 17,000 base pairs) and has
roughly 37 genes, which account for almost the entire mtDNA molecule.
These genes control cellular metabolism — the processing of energy inside
the cell.
Half of your nuclear DNA came from your mom, and the other half came from
your dad (see Chapter 2 for the scoop on how meiosis divides up chromo-
somes). But all your mtDNA came from your mom. All your mom’s mtDNA
came from her mom, and so on. All mtDNA is passed from mother to child in
the cytoplasm of the egg cell (back to Chapter 2 for cell review!).

Part II: DNA: The Genetic Material 
Meeting Rick and Eve: More on mitochrondria
Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) bears a very strong
resemblance to a bacterial DNA. The striking
similarities between mitochrondria and a cer-
tain bacteria called Rickettsia have led scien-
tists to believe that mitochrondria originated
from Rickettsia. Rickettsia causes typhus, a flu-
like disease transmitted by flea bites (the flea
first bites an infected rat or mouse and then
bites a person). As for the similarities, neither
Rickettsia nor mitochondria can live outside a
cellular home, both have circular DNA, and both
share similar DNA sequences (see Chapter 11
for how DNA sequences are compared
between organisms). Instead of being parasitic
like Rickettsia, however, mitochondria are con-
sidered endosymbiotic, meaning they must be
inside a cell to work (endo-), and they provide
something good to the cell (-symbiotic). In this
case, the something good is energy.
Because mtDNA is passed only from mother to
child (see “Mitochondrial DNA” for an explana-
tion), scientists have compared mtDNA from
people all over the world to investigate the origins
of modern humans. These comparisons have
lead some scientists to believe that all modern
humans have one particular female ancestor in
common, a woman who lived on the African con-
tinent about 150,000 years ago. This hypothetical
woman has been called “Mitochondrial Eve,” but
she wasn’t the only woman of her time. There
were many women, but apparently none of their
descendents survive. A growing body of evi-
dence suggests that all humans are descended
from this rather small population of about
100,000 individuals, meaning that all people on
earth have common ancestry.

Sperm cells have essentially no cytoplasm and thus, virtually no mitochon-
dria. Special chemicals in the egg destroy the few mitochondria that sperm
do possess.
Chloroplast DNA
Plants have three sets of DNA: nuclear in the form of chromosomes, mito-
chondrial, and chloroplast DNA (cpDNA). Chloroplasts are organelles found
only in plants, and they’re where photosynthesis (the conversion of light to
chemical energy) occurs. To complicate matters, plants have mitochondria
(and thus mtDNA) in their chloroplasts. Like mitochondria, chloroplasts
probably originated from bacteria (see the sidebar “Meeting Rick and Eve:
More on mitochondria”).
Chloroplast DNA molecules are circular and fairly large (120,000–160,000 base
pairs) but only have about 120 genes. Most of those genes supply information
used to carry out photosynthesis. Inheritance of cpDNA can be either mater-
nal or paternal, and cpDNA, along with mtDNA, is transmitted to offspring in
the cytoplasm of the seed.
Digging into the History of DNA
Back when Mendel was poking around his pea pods in the early 1860s (see
Chapter 3), neither he nor anybody else knew about DNA. DNA was discov-
ered in 1868, but its importance as the genetic material wasn’t appreciated
until nearly a century later. This section gives you a rundown on how DNA
and its role in inheritance was revealed.
Discovering DNA
In 1868, a Swiss medical student named Johann Friedrich Miescher isolated
DNA for the first time. Miescher was working with white blood cells that he
obtained from the pus drained out of surgical wounds (yes, this man was
dedicated to his work). Eventually Miescher established that the substance
he called nuclein was rich in phosphorus and was acidic. Thus, one of his stu-
dents renamed the substance nucleic acid, a name DNA still carries today.
Like Mendel’s findings on the inheritance of various plant traits, Miescher’s
work wasn’t recognized for its importance until long after his death, and it
took 84 years for DNA to be recognized as the genetic material. Until the early
1950s, everyone was sure that protein had to be the genetic material because,
with only four bases, DNA seemed too simple.
93
Chapter 6: DNA: The Basis of Life

In 1928, Frederick Griffith recognized that bacteria could acquire something —
he wasn’t quite sure what — from each other to transform harmless bacteria
into deadly bacteria (see Chapter 22 for the whole story). A team of scientists
lead by Oswald Avery followed up on Griffith’s experiments and determined
that the “transforming principle” was DNA. Even though Avery’s results were
solid, scientists of the time were very skeptical about the significance of DNA’s
role in inheritance. It took another elegant set of experiments using a virus
that infected bacteria to convince the scientific community that DNA was the
real deal.
Alfred Chase and Martha Hershey worked with a virus called a bacteriophage
(which means “eats bacteria” even though the virus actually ruptures the
bacteria rather than eats it). Bacteriophages grab onto the bacteria’s cell wall
and inject something into the bacteria. At the time of Hershey and Chase’s
experiment, the substance being injected was unidentified. The bacteriophage
reproduces inside the cell and then bursts the cell wall open to free the viral
“offspring.” Offspring carry the same traits as the original attacking bacterio-
phage, so it was certain that whatever got injected must be the genetic material
given that most of the bacteriophage stays stuck on the outside of the cell.
Hershey and Chase attached radioactive chemicals to track different parts of
the bacteriophage; for example, they used sulfur to track protein because
proteins contain sulfur, and DNA was marked with phosphorus (because of
the sugar-phosphate backbone). Hershey and Chase reasoned that offspring
bacteriophages would get marked with one or the other depending on which,
DNA or protein, turned out to be the genetic material. The results showed
that the viruses injected only DNA into the bacterial cell to infect it. All the
protein stayed stuck on the outside of the bacterial cell. Their findings were
published in 1952 (when Hershey was merely 24 years old!).
Obeying Chargaff’s rules
Long before Hershey and Chase published their pivotal findings, Erwin
Chargaff read Oswald Avery’s paper on DNA as the transforming principle
(profiled in Chapter 22) and immediately changed the focus of his entire
research program. Unlike many scientists of his day, Chargaff recognized
that DNA was the genetic material.
Chargaff focused his research on learning as much as he could about the
chemical components of DNA. Using DNA from a wide variety of organisms, he
discovered that all DNA had something in common: When DNA was broken
into its component bases, the amount of guanine fluctuated wildly from one
organism to another, but the amount of guanine always equaled the amount of
cytosine. Likewise, in every organism studied, the amount of adenine equaled
the amount of thymine. Published in 1949, these findings are so consistent that
94
Part II: DNA: The Genetic Material 

they’re called Chargaff’s rules. Unfortunately, Chargaff was unable to realize the
meaning of his own work. He knew that the ratios said something important
about the structure of DNA, but he couldn’t figure out what that something
was. It took a pair of young scientists named Watson and Crick — Chargaff
called them “two pitchmen in search of a helix” — to make the breakthrough.
Hard feelings and the helix: Franklin,
Wilkins, Watson, and Crick
If you don’t know the name Rosalind Franklin, you should. Her data on the
shape of the DNA molecule revealed its structure as a double helix. Watson
and Crick get all the credit for identifying the double helix, but Franklin did
much of the work. While researching the structure of DNA at King’s College,
London, in the early 1950s, Franklin bounced X-rays off the molecule to pro-
duce incredibly sharp, detailed photos of the DNA molecule. Franklin’s photos
show a DNA molecule from the end, not the side, so it’s difficult to envision
the side view of the double helix you normally see. Yet, Franklin knew she
was looking at a helix.
Meanwhile, James Watson, a 23-year-old postdoctoral fellow at Cambridge,
England, was working with a 38-year-old graduate student named Francis Crick.
Together, they were building enormous model of metal sticks and wooden
balls, trying to figure out the structure of the same molecule Franklin had
photographed.
Franklin was supposed to be collaborating with Maurice Wilkins, another scien-
tist in her research group, but she and Wilkins despised each other (because
of a switch in research projects in which Franklin was instructed to take over
Wilkins’s project without his knowledge). As their antagonism grew, so did
Wilkins’s friendship with Watson. What happened next is the stuff of science
infamy. Just a few weeks before Franklin was ready to publish her findings,
Wilkins showed Franklin’s photographs of the DNA molecule to Watson —
without her knowledge or permission! By giving Watson access to Franklin’s
data, Wilkins gave Watson and Crick the scoop on the competition.
Watson and Crick cracked the mystery of DNA structure using Chargaff’s rules
(see the section “Chargaff’s rules” for details) and Franklin’s measurements of
the molecule. They deduced that the structure revealed by Franklin’s photo,
hastily drawn from memory by Watson, had to be a double helix, and Chargaff’s
rules pointed to bases in pairs. The rest of the structure came together like a
big puzzle, and they rushed to publish their discovery in 1953. Franklin’s paper,
complete with the critical photos of the DNA molecule, was published in the
same issue of the journal Nature.
95
Chapter 6: DNA: The Basis of Life

In 1962, Watson, Crick, and Wilkins were honored with the Nobel Prize. Franklin
wasn’t properly credited for her part in their discovery but couldn’t protest
being left out because she had died of ovarian cancer in 1957. It’s quite possible
that Franklin’s cancer was the result of long-term exposure to X-rays during
her scientific career. In a sense, Franklin sacrificed her life for science.

E
verything in genetics relies on replication, the process of copying DNA
accurately, quickly, and efficiently. Replication is part of reproduction
(producing eggs and sperm), development (making all the cells needed by a
growing embryo), and maintaining normal life (replacing skin, blood, and
muscle cells).
Before meiosis can occur (see Chapter 2), the entire genome must be repli-
cated so that a potential parent can make the eggs or sperm necessary for
creating offspring. After fertilization occurs, the growing embryo must have
the right genetic instructions in every cell to make all the tissues needed for
life. As life outside the womb goes on, almost every cell in your body needs a
copy of the entire genome to ensure that the genes that carry out the busi-
ness of living are present and ready for action. For example, because you’re
constantly replacing your skin cells and white blood cells, your DNA is being
replicated right now so that your cells have the genes they need to work
properly.
This chapter explains all the details of the fantastic molecular photocopier
that allows DNA — the stuff of life — to do its job. First, you tackle the basics
of how DNA’s structure provides a pattern for copying itself. Then, you find
out about all the enzymes — those helpful protein workhorses — that do the
labor of opening up the double-stranded DNA and assembling the building
blocks of DNA into a new strand. Finally, you see how the copying process
works, from beginning (origins) to ends (telomeres).

Unzipped: Creating the Pattern
for More DNA
DNA’s the ideal material for carrying genetic information because it
 Stores vast amounts of complex information (genotype) that can be
“translated” into physical characteristics (phenotype).
 Can be copied quickly and accurately.
 Is passed down from one generation to the next (in other words, it’s
heritable).
When Watson and Crick proposed the double helix as the structure of DNA
(see Chapter 6 for coverage of DNA), they ended their 1953 paper with a
pithy sentence about replication. That one little sentence paved the way
for their next major publication, which hypothesized how replication might
work. It’s no accident that Watson and Crick won the Nobel Prize; their genius
was uncanny and amazingly accurate. Without their discovery of the double
helix, Watson and Crick never could’ve figured out replication because the
trick that DNA pulls off during replication depends entirely on how DNA is
put together in the first place.
If you skipped Chapter 6, which focuses on how DNA is put together, you may
want to skim over that material now. The main points about DNA you need to
know in order to understand replication are:
 DNA is double-stranded.
 The nucleotide building blocks of DNA always match up in a complemen-
tary fashion — A (adenosine) with T (thymine) and C (cytosine) with G
(guanine).
 DNA strands run antiparallel to each other.
If you were to unzip a DNA molecule by breaking all the hydrogen bonds
between the bases, you’d have two strands that each provides the pattern to
create the other. During replication, special helper chemicals called enzymes
bring matching (complementary) nucleotide building blocks to pair with
the bases on each strand. The end result is two exact copies built on the
templates provided by the unzipped original strands. Figure 7-1 shows how
the original double-stranded DNA supplies a template to make copies of
itself. This mode of replication is called semiconservative. No, this isn’t
how DNA may vote in the next election! In this case, semiconservative
means that only half the molecule is “conserved,” or left in its original state.
(Conservative, in the genetic sense, means keeping something protected in its
original state.)
98
Part II: DNA: The Genetic Material 

At Columbia University in 1957, J. Herbert Taylor, Philip Woods, and Walter
Hughes used the cell cycle to determine how DNA is copied (see Chapter 2
for a review of mitosis and the cell cycle). They came up with two possible
explanations: conservative or semiconservative replication.
Figure 7-2 shows how conservative replication might work. For both conserva-
tive and semiconservative replication, the original, double-stranded molecule
comes apart and provides the template for building new strands. The result of
semiconservative replication is two complete, double-stranded molecules,
each composed of half “new” and half “old” DNA (which is what you see in
Figure 7-1). Following conservative replication, the completed, double-stranded
copies are composed of all “new” DNA, and the templates come back together
to make one molecule composed of “old” DNA (as you can see in Figure 7-2).
To sort out replication, Taylor and his colleagues exposed the tips of a plant’s
roots to water that contained a radioactive chemical. This chemical was a form
of the nucleotide building block thymine, which is found in DNA. Before cells in

Chapter 7: Copying Your DNA: Replication

the root tips divided, their chromosomes incorporated the radioactive thymine
as part of newly replicated DNA. In the first step of the experiment, Taylor and
his team let the root tips grow for eight hours. That was just long enough for
the DNA of the cells in the growing tips to replicate. The researchers collected
some cells after this first step to see if one or both sister chromatids of each
chromosome were radioactive. Then, for the second step, they put the root
tips in water with no radioactive chemical in it. After the cells started dividing,
Taylor and his team examined the replicated chromosomes while they were in
metaphase (when the replicated chromosomes, called sister chromatids, are
all lined up together in the center of the cell, before they’re pulled apart to
opposite ends of the soon-to-divide cell; see Chapter 2). The radioactivity
allowed Taylor and his team to trace the fate of the template strands after repli-
cation was completed and determine if the strands stayed together with their
copies (semiconservative) or not (conservative). They examined the results of
both steps of the experiment to ensure that their conclusions were accurate.
If replication was semiconservative, Taylor, Woods, and Hughes expected
to find that one sister chromatid of the replicated chromosome would be
radioactive and the other would be radiation-free — and that’s what they
got. Figure 7-3 shows how their results ended up as they did. The shaded
chromosomes represent the ones containing the radioactive thymine. After
one round of replication in the presence of the radioactive thymine (step 1
in Figure 7-3), the entire chromosome appears radioactive.

Part II: DNA: The Genetic Material 

If Taylor and his team could have seen the DNA molecules themselves (as
you do in the figure), they would have known that one strand of each double-
stranded molecule contained radioactive thymine and the other did not (the
radioactive strands are depicted with a thicker line). After one round of repli-
cation without access to the radioactive thymine (step two in Figure 7-3), one
sister chromatid was radioactive, and the other was not. That’s because each
strand from step one provided a template for semiconservative replication:
The radioactive strand provided one template, and the non-radioactive
strand provided the other. After replication was completed, the templates
remained paired with the new strands. This experiment showed conclusively
that DNA replication is truly semiconservative — each replicated molecule of
DNA is half “new” and half “old.”
How DNA Copies Itself
Replication occurs during interphase of each cell cycle, just before prophase
in both mitosis and meiosis. If you skipped over Chapter 2, you may want to
take a quick glance at it to get an idea of when replication occurs with
respect to the life of a cell.
The process of replication follows a very specific order:
1. The helix is opened up to expose single strands of DNA.
2. Nucleotides are strung together to make new partner strands for the two
original strands.
DNA replication was first studied in bacteria, which are prokaryotic (lacking
cell nuclei). All nonbacterial life forms (including humans) are eukaryotes,
which means these organisms are composed of cells with nuclei. There
are a few minor differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic DNA
replication. Basically, bacteria use slightly different versions of the same
enzymes that eukaryotic cells use, and most of those enzymes have similar
names. If you understand prokaryotic replication, which I explain in this
section, you have enough background to understand the details of eukary-
otic replication, too.
Most eukaryotic DNA is linear, whereas most bacterial DNA (and your mito-
chondrial DNA) is circular. The shape of the chromosome (an endless loop
versus a string) doesn’t affect the process of replication at all. However, the
shape means that circular DNAs have special problems to solve when repli-
cating their hoop-shaped chromosomes. Take a look at the section “How
Circular DNAs Replicate” later in this chapter to find out more.
101
Chapter 7: Copying Your DNA: Replication

Meeting the replication crew
For successful replication, several players must be present:
 Template DNA, a double-stranded molecule that provides a pattern
to copy
 Nucleotides, the building blocks necessary to make new DNA
 Enzymes and various proteins that do the unzipping and assembly
work of replication, called DNA synthesis
Template DNA
In addition to the material earlier in this chapter detailing how the template
DNA is replicated semiconservatively (see “Unzipped: Creating the Pattern
for More DNA”), it’s vitally important for you to understand all the meanings
of the term template.
 Every organism’s DNA exists in the form of chromosomes. Therefore, the
chromosomes undergoing replication and the template DNA used during
replication are one in the same.
 Both strands of each double-stranded original molecule are copied, and
therefore, each of the two strands serves as a template (that is, a pat-
tern) for replication.
The bases of the template DNA provide critical information needed for repli-
cation. Each new base of the newly replicated strand must be complementary
(that is, an exact match; see Chapter 6 for more about the complementary
nature of DNA) to the base opposite it on the template strand. Together, tem-
plate and replicated DNA (like you see in Figure 7-1) make two identical
copies of the original, double-stranded molecule.
Nucleotides
DNA is made up of thousands of nucleotides linked together in paired strands.
(If you want more details about the chemical and physical constructions of
DNA, flip back to Chapter 6.) The nucleotide building blocks of DNA that come
together during replication start off in the form of deoxyribonucleoside triphos-
phates, or dNTPs. A dNTP, like the one shown in Figure 7-4, is made up of
 A sugar (deoxyribose).
 One of four bases (adenine, guanine, thymine, or cytosine).
 Three phosphates.
102
Part II: DNA: The Genetic Material 

Figure 7-4 shows a dNTP being incorporated into a double-stranded DNA mole-
cule. The dNTPs used in replication are very similar in chemical structure to
the ones that are found in double-stranded DNA (you can flip back to Figure 6-3
in Chapter 6 to compare a nucleotide to the dNTP shown in Figure 7-4). The
key difference is the number of phosphate groups — each dNTP has three
phosphates, and each nucleotide has one.
Take a look at the blow-up of the dNTP in Figure 7-4. The three phosphate
groups (the “tri-” part of the name) are at the top (usually referred to as the 
5-prime (5’) end of the molecule. At the bottom left of the molecule, also
known as the 3-prime (3’) spot, is a little tail made of an oxygen atom attached
to a hydrogen atom (collectively called an OH group or a reactive group). The
oxygen atom in the OH tail is present to allow a nucleotide in an existing DNA
strand to hook up with a dNTP; multiple connections like this one eventually
produce the long chain of DNA. (For details on the numbered points of a
molecule, such as 5’ or 3’, see Chapter 6.)
When DNA is being replicated, the OH tail on the 3’ end of the last nucleotide
in the chain reacts with the phosphates of a newly arrived dNTP (as seen in
the right-hand part of Figure 7-4). Two of the dNTP’s three phosphates get
chopped off, and the remaining phosphate forms a phosphodiester bond
with the previously incorporated nucleotide (see Chapter 6 for all the details
about phosphodiester bonds). Hydrogen bonds form between the base of the
template strand and the complementary base of the dNTP (see Chapter 6 for
more on the bonds that form between bases). This reaction — losing two
phosphates to form a phosphodiester bond and hydrogen bonding — converts
the dNTP into a nucleotide. (The only real difference between dNTP and the
nucleotide it becomes are the number of phosphates each carries.) Remember,
the template DNA must be single-stranded for these reactions to occur (see
“Splitting the helix” later in this chapter).
Each dNTP incorporated during replication must be complementary to the
base it’s hooked up with on the template strand.
A nucleotide is a deoxyribose sugar, a base, and a phosphate joined together
as a unit. A nucleotide is a nucleotide regardless of whether it’s part of a
whole DNA molecule or not. A dNTP is also a nucleotide, just a special sort:
a nucleotide triphosphate.
Enzymes
Replication can’t occur without the help of a huge suite of enzymes. Enzymes
are chemicals that cause reactions. Generally, enzymes come in two flavors:
those that put things together and those that take things apart. Both types
are used during replication.
103
Chapter 7: Copying Your DNA: Replication

Although you can’t tell which function an enzyme carries (building or destroy-
ing) by its name, you can always identify enzymes because they end in ase. The
ase suffix usually follows a reference to what the enzyme acts on. For example,
the enzyme helicase acts on the helix of DNA to make it single-stranded (helix +
ase = helicase).
So many enzymes are used in replication that it’s hard to keep up with them
all. However, the main players and their roles are:
 Helicase: Opens up the double helix
 Gyrase: Prevents the helix from forming knots
 Primase: Lays down a short piece of RNA (a primer) to get replication
started (see Chapter 8 for more on RNA)
 DNA polymerase: Adds dNTPs to build the new strand of DNA
 Ligase: Seals the gaps between newly replicated pieces of DNA

very special job
There are five forms of DNA polymerase in prokaryotes and at least 13 forms
in eukaryotes. In prokaryotes, DNA polymerase III is the enzyme that per-
forms replication. DNA polymerase I removes RNA primers and replaces
them with DNA. DNA polymerases II, IV, and V all work to repair damaged

DNA and carry out proofreading activities. Eukaryotes use a whole different
set of DNA polymerases. (For more details on eukaryotic DNA replication, see
the section “Replication in Eukaryotes” later in the chapter. You can also
check out Table 7-1 for a list of some DNA polymerases used by eukaryotic
cells and their functions.)
Splitting the helix
DNA replication starts at very specific spots, called origins, along the double-
stranded template molecule. Bacterial chromosomes are so short (only about
4 million base pairs; see Chapter 11) that only one origin for replication is
needed. Copying bigger genomes would take far too long if each chromosome
had only one origin, so to make the process of copying very rapid, human
chromosomes each have thousands of origins. (See the section “Replication
in Eukaryotes” later in this chapter for more details on how human DNA is
replicated.)
Special proteins, called initiators, move along the double-stranded template
DNA until they encounter a group of bases that are in a specific order. These
bases represent the origin for replication; think of them as a road sign with
the message: “Start replication here.” The initiator proteins latch onto the
template at the origin by looping the helix around themselves like looping
a string around your finger. The initiator proteins then make a very small
opening in the double helix.
Helicase (the enzyme that opens up the double helix) finds this opening
and starts breaking the hydrogen bonds between the complementary tem-
plate strands to expose a few hundred bases and split the helix open even
wider. DNA has such a strong tendency to form double-strands that if
another protein didn’t come along to hold the single strands exposed by
helicase apart, they’d snap right back together again. These proteins, called
single-stranded-binding (SSB) proteins, prop the two strands apart so replica-
tion can occur. Figure 7-5 shows the whole process of replication. For now,
focus on the part that shows how helicase breaks the strands apart as it
moves along the double helix and how the strands are kept separated and
untwisted.
If you’ve had any experience with yarn or fishing line, you know that if string
gets twisted together and you try to pull the strands apart, a knot forms. This
same problem occurs when opening up the double helix of DNA. When heli-
case starts pulling the two strands apart, the opening of the helix sends extra
turns along the intact helix. To prevent DNA from ending up a knotty mess, an
enzyme called gyrase comes along to relieve the tension. Exactly how gyrase
does this is unclear, but some researchers think that gyrase actually snips
the DNA apart temporarily to let the twisted parts relax and then seals the
molecule back together again.
105
Chapter 7: Copying Your DNA: Replication

Priming the pump
When helicase opens up the molecule, a Y forms at the opening. This Y is
called a replication fork. You can see a replication fork in Figure 7-5, where
the helicase has split the DNA helix apart. For every opening in the double-
stranded molecule, two forks form on opposite sides of the opening. DNA repli-
cation is very particular in that it can only proceed in one direction: 5-prime to
3-prime (5’ →3’). In Figure 7-5, the top strand runs 3’ →5’ from left to right, and
the bottom strand runs 5’ →3’ (that is, the template strands are antiparallel; see
Chapter 6 for more about the importance of the antiparallel arrangement of
DNA strands). Replication must proceed antiparallel to the template, running 5’
to 3’. Therefore, replication on the top strand runs right to left; on the bottom
strand, replication runs left to right.
After helicase splits the molecule open (as I explain in the preceding section),
two naked strands of template DNA are left. Replication can’t start on the
naked template strands because it hasn’t started yet. (That sounds a bit like
Yogi Berra saying “It ain’t over ’til it’s over,” doesn’t it?) All funny business
aside, nucleotides can only form chains if a nucleotide is already present with
a free reactive tail on which to attach the incoming dNTP. DNA solves the
problem of starting replication by inserting primers, little complementary
starter strands made of RNA (see Figure 7-5).
Primase, the enzyme that manufactures the RNA primers for replication, lays
down primers at each replication fork so that DNA synthesis can proceed
from 5’ →3’ on both strands. The RNA primers made by primase are only
about 10 or 12 nucleotides long. They’re complementary to the single strands
of DNA and end with the same sort of OH tail found on a nucleotide of DNA.
(To find out more about RNA, you can flip ahead to Chapter 8.) DNA uses the
primers’ free OH tails to add nucleotides in the form of dNTPs (see
“Nucleotides” earlier in this chapter); the primers are later snipped out and
replaced with DNA (see “Joining all the pieces” later in this chapter).
Leading and lagging
As soon as the primers are in place, actual replication can get underway. DNA
polymerase is the enzyme that does all the work of replication. At the OH tail
of each primer, DNA polymerase tacks on dNTPs by snipping off two phos-
phates and forming phosphodiester bonds. Meanwhile, helicase opens up the
helix ahead of the growing chain to expose more template strand. From
Figure 7-5, it’s easy to see that replication can just zoom along this way — but
only on one strand (in this case, the top strand in Figure 7-5). The replicated
strands keep growing continuously 5’ →3’ as helicase makes the template
available. At the same time, on the opposite strand, new primers have to be
added to take advantage of the newly available template. The new primers
106
Part II: DNA: The Genetic Material 

are necessary because a naked strand (the bottom one in Figure 7-5) lacking
the necessary free nucleotide for chain building is created by the ongoing
splitting of the helix.

Chapter 7: Copying Your DNA: Replication

Thus, the interaction of opening the helix and synthesizing DNA 5’ →3’ on
one strand while laying down new primers on the other leads to the forma-
tion of leading and lagging strands.
 Leading strands: The strands being formed in one bout of uninterrupted
DNA synthesis (you can see a leading strand in Figure 7-6). Leading
strands follow the lead, so to speak, of helicase.
 Lagging strands: The strands that are begun over and over as new
primers are laid down. Synthesis of the lagging strands stops when they
reach the 5’ end of a primer elsewhere on the strand. Lagging strands
“lag behind” leading strands in the sense of frequent starting and stop-
ping versus continuous replication. (Replication happens so rapidly that
there’s no difference in the amount of time it takes to replicate leading
and lagging strands). The short pieces of DNA formed by lagging DNA
synthesis have a special name: Okazaki fragments, named for the scien-
tist, Reiji Okazaki, who discovered them.
Joining all the pieces
After the template strands are replicated, the newly synthesized strands have
to be modified to be complete and whole:
 The RNA primers must be removed and replaced with DNA.
 The Okazaki fragments formed by lagging DNA synthesis must be joined
together.

Part II: DNA: The Genetic Material 

A special kind of DNA polymerase moves along the newly synthesized strands
seeking out the RNA primers. When DNA polymerase encounters the short bits
of RNA, it snips them out and replaces them with DNA. Figure 7-5 illustrates
this process. The snipping out and replacing of RNA primers proceeds in the
usual 5’ →3’ direction of replication and follows the same procedures as
normal DNA synthesis (adding dNTPs and forming phosphodiester bonds).
After the primers are removed and replaced, one phosphodiester bond is
missing between the Okazaki fragments. Ligase is the enzyme that seals these
little gaps (“ligate” meaning to join things together). Ligase has the special
ability to form phosphodiester bonds without adding a new nucleotide.
Proofreading replication
Despite its complexity, replication is unbelievably fast. In humans, replication
speeds along at about 2,000 bases a minute. Bacterial replication is even
faster at about 1,000 bases per second! Working at that speed, it’s really no
surprise that DNA polymerase makes mistakes — about one in every 100,000
bases is incorrect. Fortunately, DNA polymerase can use the backspace key!
DNA polymerase is constantly checking its work though a process called
proofreading — the same way I proofread my work as I wrote this book. DNA
polymerase looks over its shoulder, so to speak, and keeps track of how well
the newly added bases fit with the template strand. If an incorrect base is
added, DNA polymerase backs up and cuts the incorrect base out. The snip-
ping process is called exonuclease activity, and the correction process requires
DNA polymerase to move 3’ →5’ instead of the usual 5’ →3’ direction. DNA
proofreading eliminates most of the mistakes made by DNA polymerase, and
the result is nearly error-free DNA synthesis. Generally, replication (after proof-
reading) has an astonishingly low error rate of one in 10 million base pairs.
If DNA polymerase misses an incorrect base, special enzymes come along
after replication is complete to carry out another process, called mismatch
repair (much like my editors checked my proofreading). The mismatch repair
enzymes detect the bulges that occur along the helix when non-complementary
bases are paired up, and the enzymes snip the incorrect base out of the
newly synthesized strand. These enzymes replace the incorrect base with the
correct one and, like ligase, seal up the gaps to finish the repair job.
Replication is a complicated process that uses a dizzying array of enzymes.
The key points to remember are:
 Replication always starts at an origin.
 Replication can only occur when template DNA is single-stranded.
 RNA primers must be put down before replication can proceed.
109
Chapter 7: Copying Your DNA: Replication

 Replication always moves 5’ →3’.
 Newly synthesized strands are complementary, exact matches to tem-
plate (“old”) strands.
Replication in Eukaryotes
Although replication in prokaryotes (organisms without cell nuclei) and
eukaryotes (organisms with cell nuclei) is very similar, there are four differ-
ences you need to know about:
 For each of their chromosomes, eukaryotes have many, many origins
for replication. Prokaryotes generally have one origin per circular
chromosome.
 The enzymes used by prokaryotes and eukaryotes for replication are
similar but not identical. Compared to prokaryotes, eukaryotes have
many more DNA polymerases, and these DNA polymerases carry out
other functions besides replication. Take a look at Table 7-1 to see four
of the 13 DNA polymerase enzymes used in eukaryotic replication.
 Linear chromosomes, found in eukaryotes, require special enzymes to
replicate the telomeres, the ends of chromosomes.
 Eukaryotic chromosomes are tightly wound around special proteins in
order to package large amounts of DNA into very small cell nuclei.

Pulling up short: Telomeres
When linear chromosomes replicate, the ends of the chromosomes, called
telomeres, present special challenges. These challenges are handled in differ-
ent ways depending upon what kind of cell division is taking place (that is,
mitosis versus meiosis).
110
Part II: DNA: The Genetic Material 

At the completion of replication for cells in mitosis, a short part of the telom-
ere tips is left single-stranded and unreplicated. A special enzyme comes
along and snips off this unreplicated part of the telomere. Losing this bit of
DNA at the end of the chromosome isn’t as big a deal as it may seem because
telomeres, in addition to being the ends of chromosomes, are long strings of
junk DNA. Junk DNA doesn’t contain genes but may have other important
functions (see Chapter 11 for the details).
For telomeres, being junk DNA is good because when telomeres get snipped
off, the chromosomes aren’t damaged too much and the genes still work just
fine — up to a point. After many rounds of replication, all the junk DNA at
the ends of the chromosomes is snipped off (essentially, the chromosomes
run out of junk DNA), and actual genes themselves are affected. Therefore,
when the chromosomes of a mitotic cell (like a skin cell, for example) get too
short, the cell dies through a process called apoptosis. (Apoptosis is covered
in detail in Chapter 14.) Paradoxically, cell death through apoptosis is a good
thing because it protects you from the ravages of mutations, which can cause
cancer.
If the cell is being divided as part of meiosis, telomere snipping is not okay.
The telomeres must be replicated completely so that perfectly complete, full-
size chromosomes are passed on to offspring. An enzyme called telomerase
takes care of replicating the ends of the chromosomes. Figure 7-7 gives you
an idea of how telomerase replicates telomeres. Primase lays down a primer
at the very tip of the chromosome as part of the normal replication process.
DNA synthesis proceeds from 5’ →3’ as usual, and then, a DNA polymerase
comes along and snips out the RNA primer from 5’ →3’. Without telomerase,
the process stops, leaving a tail of unreplicated, single-stranded DNA flapping
around (this is what happens during mitosis).

Chapter 7: Copying Your DNA: Replication

Telomerase easily detects the unreplicated telomere because telomeres have
long sections of guanines, or Gs. Telomerase contains a section of cytosine-
rich RNA, allowing the enzyme to bind to the unreplicated guanine-rich
telomere. Telomerase then uses its own RNA to extend the unreplicated DNA
template by about 15 nucleotides. Scientists suspect that the single-stranded
template then folds back on itself to provide a free OH tail to replicate the rest
of the telomere in the absence of a primer (see “Priming the pump” earlier in
this chapter).
Finishing the job
Your DNA (and that of all eukaryotes) is tightly wound around special proteins
called nucleosomes (not to be confused with nucleotides) so that the enormous
molecule fits neatly into the cell nucleus. (Take a look at Chapter 6 for the
details on just how big a molecule of DNA really is.) Like replication, packaging
DNA is a very rapid process. It happens so quickly that scientists aren’t exactly
sure how DNA gets unwrapped from the nucleosomes to replicate and then
gets wrapped around the nucleosomes again.
In the packaging stage, DNA is normally twisted tightly around hundreds of
thousands of nucleosomes, much like string wrapped around beads. The
whole “necklace” gets wound very tightly around itself in a process called
supercoiling. Supercoiling is what allows the 3.5 billion base pairs of DNA that
make up your 46 chromosomes to fit inside the microscopic nuclei of your
cells. Altogether, about 150 base pairs of DNA are wrapped around each
nucleosome and secured in place with a little protein called a histone. In
Figure 7-8, you can see the nucleosomes, histones, and supercoiled “necklace.”
DNA is packaged in this manner both before and after replication. Because
only 30 or 40 base pairs of DNA are exposed between nucleosomes, the DNA
must be removed from the nucleosomes in order to replicate. If it isn’t
removed from the nucleosomes, the enzymes used in replication aren’t able
to access the entire molecule.

Part II: DNA: The Genetic Material 

As helicase opens up the DNA molecule during replication, an unidentified
enzyme strips off the nucleosome beads at the same time. As soon as the
DNA is replicated, the DNA (both old and new) is immediately wrapped
around waiting nucleosomes. Studies show that the old nucleosomes (from
before replication) are reused along with newly assembled nucleosomes to
package the freshly replicated DNA molecule.
How Circular DNAs Replicate
Circular DNAs are replicated in three different ways, as shown in Figure 7-9.
Different organisms take different approaches to solve the problem of replicat-
ing hoop-shaped chromosomes. Theta replication is used by most bacteria,
including E. coli. Viruses use rolling circle replication to rapidly manufacture
vast numbers of copies of their genomes. Finally, human mitochondrial DNA
and the chloroplast DNA of plants both use D-loop replication.
Theta
Theta replication refers to the shape the chromosome takes on during the
replication process. After the helix splits apart, a bubble forms, giving the
chromosome a shape reminiscent of the Greek letter theta Θ (; see Figure 7-9).
Bacterial chromosomes have only one origin of replication (see “Splitting
the helix”), so after helicase opens the double helix, replication proceeds
in both directions simultaneously, rapidly copying the entire molecule. As
I describe in the section “Leading and lagging,” leading and lagging strands
form, and ligase seals the gaps in the newly synthesized DNA to complete
the strands. Ultimately, theta replication produces two intact, double-stranded
molecules.

113
Chapter 7: Copying Your DNA: Replication

Rolling circle
Rolling circle replication creates an odd situation. No primer is needed because
the double-stranded template is broken at the origin to provide a free OH tail
to start replication. As replication proceeds, the inner strand is copied con-
tinuously as a leading strand (see Figure 7-9). Meanwhile, the broken strand
is stripped off. As soon as enough of the broken strand is freed, a primer is laid
down so replication can occur as the broken strand is stripped away from its
complement. Thus, rolling circle replication is continuous on one strand and
lagging on the other. As soon as replication is completed for one copy of the
genome, the new copies are used as templates for additional rounds of replica-
tion. Viral genomes are often very small (only a few thousand base pairs), so
rolling circle replication is an extremely rapid process that produces hundreds
of thousands of copies of viral DNA in only a few minutes.
D-loop
Like rolling circle replication, D-loop replication creates a displaced, single
strand (see Figure 7-9). Helicase opens the double-stranded molecule, and
an RNA primer is laid down, displacing one strand. Replication then proceeds
around the circle, pushing the displaced strand off as it goes. The intact, single
strand is released and used as a template to synthesize a complementary
strand.

NA is the stuff of life. Practically every organism on earth relies on DNA
to store genetic information and transmit it from one generation to the
next. The road from genotype (building plans) to phenotype (physical traits)
begins with transcription — making a special kind of copy of DNA. DNA’s so
precious and vital to eukaryotes (organisms made up of cells with nuclei) that
it’s kept packaged in the cell nucleus, like a rare document that’s copied but
never removed from storage. Because it can’t leave the safety of the nucleus,
DNA directs all the cell’s activity by delegating responsibility to another chem-
ical, RNA. RNA carries messages out of the cell nucleus into the cytoplasm
(visit Chapter 2 for more about navigating the cell) to direct the production of
proteins during translation, a process you find out more about in Chapter 9.
You Already Know a Lot about RNA
If you read Chapter 6, in which I cover DNA at length, you already know a lot
about ribonucleic acid, or RNA. From a chemical standpoint, RNA’s very
simple. It’s composed of:
 Ribose sugar (instead of deoxyribose, which is found in DNA)
 Four nucleotide bases (three you know from DNA — adenine, guanine,
and cytosine — plus an unfamiliar one called uracil)
 Phosphate (the same phosphate found in DNA)
RNA has three major characteristics that make it different from DNA:
 RNA is very unstable and decomposes rapidly.
 RNA contains uracil in place of thymine.
 RNA is almost always single-stranded.

Using a slightly different sugar
Both RNA and DNA use a ribose sugar as a main element of their chemical
structures. The ribose sugar used in DNA is deoxyribose (find out more
about this sugar in Chapter 6). RNA, on the other hand, uses unmodified
ribose. Take a careful look at Figure 8-1. You can see that three spots on
ribose are marked with numbers. (On ribose sugars, numbers are followed by
an apostrophe [’] to indicate the designation “prime;” see Chapter 6 for more
information.) Ribose and deoxyribose both have an oxygen (O) atom and a
hydrogen (H) atom (an OH group) at their 3’ sites.
OH groups are also called reactive groups because oxygen atoms are very
aggressive from a chemical standpoint (so aggressive that some chemists say
they “attack” incoming atoms). The 3’ OH tail is required for phosphodiester
bonds to form between nucleotides in both ribose and deoxyribose atoms,
thanks to their aggressive oxygen atoms. (For the scoop on how phosphodi-
ester bonds form during replication, see Chapter 7.)
The difference between the two molecules is the absence (with deoxyribose)
or presence (with ribose) of an oxygen atom at the 2’ spot. One oxygen atom
has a huge hand in the differing purposes and roles of DNA and RNA:
 DNA: DNA is such an important molecule that it must be protected from
decomposition. The absence of one oxygen atom is part of the key to
extending DNA’s longevity. When the 2’ oxygen is missing, as in deoxyri-
bose, the sugar molecule is less likely to get involved in chemical reac-
tions (because oxygen is chemically aggressive); by being aloof, DNA
avoids being broken down.
 RNA: RNA is easily decomposed because its reactive 2’ OH tail intro-
duces RNA into chemical interactions that break the molecule up. Unlike
DNA, RNA is a short-term tool the cell uses to send messages and manu-
facture proteins as part of gene expression (which I cover in Chapter 9).
Messenger RNAs (mRNAs) carry out the actions of genes, turning them
off and on again when needed. Put simply, to turn a gene “on,” mRNAs

have to be made, and to turn a gene “off,” the mRNAs that turned it
“on” have to be removed. So, the 2’ OH tail is a built-in mechanism that
allows RNA to be decomposed, or removed, rapidly and easily when the
message is no longer needed and the gene needs to be turned “off” (see
Chapter 10 for more on turning genes off and on).
Meeting a new base: Uracil
RNA is composed of four nucleotide bases. Three of the four bases may be
quite familiar to you because they’re also part of DNA: adenosine (A), gua-
nine (G), and cytosine (C). The fourth base, uracil (U), is found only in RNA.
(In DNA, the fourth base is thymine. See Chapter 6 for details.) RNA’s bases
are pictured in Figure 8-2.
Uracil may be new to you, but it’s actually the precursor of DNA’s thymine.
When your body produces nucleotides, uracil is hooked up with a ribose and
three phosphates to form a ribonucleoside triphosphate (rNTP). (Check out
Figure 8-5 later in the chapter to see an rNTP.) If DNA is being replicated, or
copied (see Chapter 7 for the details on DNA’s copying process), deoxyri-
bonucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs) of thymine — not uracil — are needed,
meaning that a few things have to happen:
 The 2’ oxygen must be removed from ribose to make deoxyribose.
 A chemical group must be added to uracil’s ring structure (all the bases
are rings; see Chapter 6 for details on how these rings stack up). Folic
acid, otherwise known as vitamin B9, helps add a carbon and three
hydrogen atoms (CH3, referred to as a methyl group) to uracil to convert
it to thymine.
Uracil carries genetic information in the same way thymine does, as part of
sequences of bases. (In fact, the genetic code that’s translated into protein is
written using uracil; see Chapter 9 for more on the genetic code.)

Chapter 8: RNA: Like DNA but Different

The complementary base pairing rules that apply to DNA (see Chapter 6) also
apply to RNA: purines with pyrimidines, that is G with C, and A with U. So why
are there two versions of essentially the same base (uracil and thymine)?
 Thymine protects the DNA molecule better than uracil can because that
little methyl group (CH3) helps make DNA less obvious to chemicals
called nucleases that chew up both DNA and RNA. Nucleases are
enzymes (chemicals that cause reactions to occur) that act on nucleic
acids (see Chapter 6 for why DNA and RNA are called nucleic acids).
Your body uses nucleases to attack unwanted RNA and DNA molecules
(such as viruses and bacteria), but if methyl groups are present, nucle-
ases can’t bond as easily with the nucleic acid to break its chains. (The
methyl group also makes DNA hydrophobic; see Chapter 6 for why DNA
is afraid of water.)
 Uracil is a very friendly base; it easily bonds with the other three bases
to form pairs. Uracil’s amorous nature is great for RNA, which needs to
form all sorts of interesting turns, twists, and knots to do its job (see the
next section, “Stranded!”). DNA’s message is too important to trust to
such an easygoing base as uracil; strict base pairing rules must be fol-
lowed in order to protect DNA’s message from mutation (see Chapter 13
for more on how base pair rules protect DNA’s message from getting gar-
bled). Thymine, as uracil’s less friendly near-twin, only bonds with ade-
nine, making it perfectly suited to protect DNA’s message.
118
Part II: DNA: The Genetic Material 
Interfering RNAs
The process of linking genes with their func-
tions used to be an arduous task. Until recently,
scientists had to use “knockout” organisms to
tease out the functions of genes one at a time.
The process involved isolating a gene and dis-
abling its function by introducing a mutation
(see Chapter 13). The disabled gene was then
engineered into a living organism, such as a
mouse, to study the consequences of losing the
function of the particular gene that was being
studied. (See Chapter 19 for how geneti-
cally modified organisms are created.) As soon
as the defect was spotted, the original function
of the unmodified gene could be determined.
But the discovery of RNA interference is chang-
ing the way genetics does business.
Geneticists can isolate cell mRNA without know-
ing what the mRNA codes for or which gene it
comes from. Scientists then design special RNAs
called RNAi, for RNA interference, that match
the mRNAs. When it’s introduced into the cell,
RNAi destroys matching, naturally produced
mRNAs before they can be translated by the
ribosomes. In a groundbreaking study of gene
function in roundworms, researchers introduced
RNAi by simply feeding it to adult worms. Once
in place, the RNAi halts all translation of the
target mRNAs, thus temporarily “knocking out”
the gene. When genes are turned off in this way,
the disruption reveals to scientists the original
gene function. By comparing the sequence of the
“knocked out” mRNA to DNA, researchers can
very rapidly locate and assign functions to thou-
sands of genes.

Stranded!
RNA is almost always single-stranded, and DNA is always double-stranded.
The double-stranded nature of DNA helps protect its message and provides a
simple way for the molecule to be copied during replication. Like DNA, RNA
loves to hook up with complementary bases. But RNA is a bit narcissistic; it
likes to form bonds with itself (see Figure 8-3), creating what’s called a sec-
ondary structure. The primary structure of RNA is the single-stranded mole-
cule; when the molecule bonds with itself and gets all twisted and folded up,
the result is the secondary structure.
Three major types of RNA carry out the business of expressing DNA’s message.
Although all three RNAs function as a team during translation (covered in
Chapter 9), the individual types carry out very specific functions.
 mRNA: Regulates how genes are expressed
 tRNA: Carries amino acids around during translation (see Chapter 9 for
more on translation)
 rRNA: Puts amino acids together in chains (see Chapter 9 for more on
rRNA’s role during translation)
Transcription: Copying DNA’s Message
into RNA’s Language
A transcript is record of something, not an exact copy. In genetics, transcription
is the process of recording part of the DNA message in a related, but different,
language — the language of RNA. (To review differences between DNA and
RNA, jump back to “You Already Know a Lot about RNA,” earlier in this chap-
ter.) Transcription is necessary because DNA is too valuable to be moved or

tampered with. The DNA molecule is the plan, and any error that’s introduced
into the plan (as a mutation, which I address in Chapter 13) causes lots of
problems. If part or all of the DNA molecule were lost, the cell would die (flip
to Chapter 14 for more on cell death). Transcription keeps DNA safe by letting
a temporary RNA copy take the risk of leaving the cell nucleus and going out
into the cytoplasm.
Messenger RNAs (mRNAs) are the specific type of RNA responsible for carry-
ing DNA’s message from the cell nucleus into the cytoplasm (check out
Chapter 2 for a review of cell parts).
With transcription, the DNA inside the nucleus goes through a process similar
to replication (see Chapter 7) to get the message out as RNA. When DNA is
replicated, the result is another DNA molecule that’s exactly like the original
in every way. But in transcription, many mRNAs are created because, instead
of transcribing the entire DNA molecule, only messages of genes are tran-
scribed into mRNA. Transcription has several steps:
1. Enzymes identify the right part of the DNA molecule to transcribe (see
“Getting ready to transcribe”).
2. The DNA molecule is opened up to make the message accessible (see
“Initiation”).
3. Enzymes build the mRNA strand (see “Elongation”).
4. The DNA molecule snaps shut to release the newly synthesized mRNA
(see “Termination”).
Getting ready to transcribe
In preparing to transcribe DNA into mRNA, three things need to be completed:
 Locate the proper gene sequence within the billions of bases that make
up DNA
 Determine which of the two strands of DNA to transcribe
 Gather up the nucleotides of RNA and the enzymes needed to carry out
transcription
Locating the gene
Your chromosomes are made up of roughly 3 billion base pairs of DNA and
contain somewhere between 25,000 and 30,000 genes (see Chapter 11). But
only about 1 percent of your DNA gets transcribed into mRNA. Genes, the
sequences that do get transcribed, vary in size. The average gene is only
about 3,000 base pairs long, but the human genome also has some gigantic
genes — for example, the gene that’s implicated in a particular form of mus-
cular dystrophy (Duchenne) is a whopping 2.5 million base pairs.
120
Part II: DNA: The Genetic Material 

Before a gene of any size can be transcribed, it must be located. The cue that
says “start transcription here” is written right into the DNA in regions called
promoters. (The promoter also controls how often the process takes place; see
the “Initiation” section later in the chapter.) The sequence that indicates where
to stop transcribing is called a terminator. The whole thing, the gene along with
the promoter and the terminator, is called the transcription unit (see Figure 8-4).
The promoter sequences tell the enzymes of transcription where to start work
and are located within 30 or so base pairs of the genes they control. Each gene
has its own promoter. In eukaryotes, the sequence of the promoter is always
the same, and it’s called the TATA box because the sequence of the bases is
TATAAA. The presence of TATA tells the transcription-starting enzyme that the
gene to transcribe is about 30 base pairs away. Sequences, like TATA, that are
the same in many (if not all) organisms are called consensus sequences, indicat-
ing that the sequences agree or mean the same thing everywhere they appear.
Locating the right strand: Sense and nonsense
By now you’ve (hopefully) picked up on the fact that DNA is double-stranded.
Those double strands aren’t identical, though; they’re complementary, mean-
ing that the sequence of bases matches up, but it doesn’t spell the same
words of the genetic code (see Chapter 9 for genetic code info). The genetic
code of DNA works like this: Bases of genes are read in three base sets, like
words. For example, three adenines in a row (AAA) are transcribed into
mRNA as three uracils (UUU). During translation, UUU tells the ribosome to
use an amino acid called phenylalanine as part of the protein it’s making. If
the complementary DNA, TTT, were transcribed, you’d wind up with an
mRNA saying AAA, which specifies lysine. A protein containing lysine will
function differently than one containing phenylalanine.
Because complements don’t spell the same genetic words, you can get two dif-
ferent messages depending on which strand of DNA is transcribed into mRNA.
Therefore genes can only be read from one of the two strands of the double-
stranded DNA molecule — but which one? The TATA box (the promoter; see

Chapter 8: RNA: Like DNA but Different

“Locating the gene”) not only indicates where a gene is but also tells which
strand holds the gene’s information. TATA boxes indicate that a gene is about
30 bases away going in the 3’ direction (sometimes referred to as down-
stream). Genes along the DNA molecule run in both directions, but any
given gene is transcribed only in the 3’direction. Because only one strand
is transcribed, the two strands are designated in one of two ways:
 Template: This strand provides the pattern for transcription.
 Nontemplate: This strand is the original message that’s actually being
transcribed.
TATA is on the nontemplate strand and indicates that the other (complemen-
tary) strand is to be used as the template for transcription. Take a look at
Figure 8-4 and compare the template to the RNA transcript — they’re comple-
mentary. Now compare the mRNA transcript to the nontemplate strand. The
only difference between the two is that uracil appears in place of thymine.
The RNA is the transcript of the nontemplate strand.
Because the strands have different meanings, the nontemplate makes sense as
a transcript, and the template does not. Some scientists refer to the strands
as “sense and nonsense” strands or sometimes “sense and antisense.” To
complicate matters, not all scientists use the terms sense and nonsense in
the same . . . sense. But if you stick to calling the two strands template and
nontemplate, you can’t go wrong.
Gathering building blocks and enzymes
In addition to template DNA (see the preceding section), the following ingre-
dients are needed for successful transcription:
 Ribonucleotides, the building blocks of RNA
 Enzymes and proteins, to assemble the growing RNA strand in the
process of RNA synthesis
The building blocks of RNA are nearly identical to those used in DNA synthesis,
which I explain in Chapter 7. The differences, of course, are that for RNA,
ribose is used in place of deoxyribose, and uracil replaces thymine. Otherwise,
the rNTPs (ribonucleoside triphosphates; see Figure 8-5) look very much like
the dNTPs you’re hopefully already familiar with.
In a process similar to replication, transcription requires the services of vari-
ous enzymes to:
 Find the promoter (see the “Locating the gene” section earlier)
 Open up the DNA molecule (see the “Initiation” section later)
 Assemble the growing strand of RNA (see the “Elongation” section later)
122
Part II: DNA: The Genetic Material 

Unlike replication, though, transcription has fewer enzymes to keep track of.
(You’re welcome.) The main player is RNA polymerase. Like DNA polymerase
(which you can meet in Chapter 7), RNA polymerase recognizes each base
on the template and adds the appropriate complementary base to the grow-
ing RNA strand, substituting uracil where DNA polymerase would supply
thymine. RNA polymerase hooks up with a large group of enzymes — called
a holoenzyme — to carry out this process. The individual enzymes making
up the holoenzyme vary between prokaryotes and eukaryotes, but their
functions remain the same: to recognize and latch onto the promoter and
to call RNA polymerase over to join the party.
Eukaryotes have three kinds of RNA polymerase, which vary only in which
genes they transcribe.
 RNA polymerase I takes care of long rRNA molecules.
 RNA polymerase II carries out the synthesis of most mRNA and some
tiny, specialized types of RNA molecules that are used in RNA editing
after transcription is over (see “Post-transcription Processing” later in
this chapter).
 RNA polymerase III transcribes tRNA genes and other small RNAs used
in RNA editing.

Chapter 8: RNA: Like DNA but Different

Initiation
Initiation includes finding the gene and opening up the DNA molecule so that
the enzymes can get to work. The process of initiation is pretty simple:
1. The holoenzyme (group of enzymes that hook up with RNA poly-
merase) finds the promoter.
The promoter of each gene controls how often transcription makes an
mRNA transcript to carry out the gene’s action. RNA polymerase can’t
bind to a gene that isn’t scheduled for transcription. In eukaryotes,
enhancers, which are sequences sometimes distantly located from the
transcription unit, also control how often a particular gene is transcribed.
To find out more about how genes are turned on, flip to Chapter 10.
2. RNA polymerase opens up the double-stranded DNA molecule to
expose a very short section of the template strand.
When the promoter “boots up” to initiate transcription, the holoenzyme
complex binds to the promoter site and signals RNA polymerase. RNA
polymerase binds to the template at the start site for transcription. RNA
polymerase can’t “see” past the sugar-phosphate backbone of DNA, so
transcription can’t occur if the molecule isn’t first opened up to expose
single strands. RNA polymerase melts the hydrogen bonds between the
double-stranded DNA molecule and opens up a short stretch of the helix
to expose the template. The opening created by RNA polymerase when
it wedges its way between the two strands of the helix is called the tran-
scription bubble (see Figure 8-6).
3. RNA polymerase strings together rNTPs to form mRNA (or one of the
other types of RNA, such as tRNA or rRNA).
RNA polymerase doesn’t need a primer to begin synthesis of a new mRNA
molecule (unlike DNA replication; see Chapter 7 for details). RNA poly-
merase simply reads the first base of the transcription unit and lays down
the appropriate complementary rNTP. This first rNTP doesn’t lose its
three phosphate molecules because no phophodiester bond is formed
at the 5’ side. Those two extra phosphates remain until the mRNA is
edited later in the transcription process (see “Post-transcription
Processing” later in this chapter).
Elongation
After RNA polymerase puts down the first rNTP, it continues opening the DNA
helix and synthesizing mRNA by adding rNTPs until the entire transcriptional
unit is transcribed. The transcription bubble (the opening between DNA
strands) itself is very small; only about 20 bases of DNA are exposed at a
time. So as RNA polymerase moves down the transcription unit, only the part
of the template that’s actively being transcribed is exposed. The helix snaps
124
Part II: DNA: The Genetic Material 

shut as RNA polymerase steams ahead to push the newly synthesized mRNA
molecule off the template (see Figure 8-6). An enzyme like gyrase (see
Chapter 7) probably works to keep the DNA molecule from getting knotted up
during the opening, transcribing, and closing process (but scientists aren’t
certain at this point).
Like the human genome as a whole (see Chapter 11), the transcriptional units
of genes contain sequences that appear to be “junk.” These parts of the gene
aren’t translated into protein and therefore don’t code for phenotype (physical
traits). As you may expect, geneticists have come up with terms for the “junk”
parts and the “useful” parts:
 Introns: Noncoding sequences that get their name from their intervening
presence. Genes often have many introns that fall between the parts of
the gene that actually code for phenotype.
 Exons: Coding sequences that get their name from their expressed nature.
The entire gene — introns and exons — is transcribed (see Figure 8-6). After
transcription has terminated, part of the editing process is the removal of
introns. The process of snipping out introns and splicing together exons is
covered in the section “Editing the message,” later in this chapter.
Prokaryotes don’t have introns because prokaryotic genes are all coding, or
exon. Only eukaryotes have genes interrupted by intron sequences. Almost all
eukaryotic genes have at least one intron; the maximum number of introns in
any one gene is 200. Scientists don’t fully understand the function of introns,
but they likely have something to do with how different mRNAs are edited.

Chapter 8: RNA: Like DNA but Different

Termination
When RNA polymerase encounters the terminator (as a sequence in the DNA,
not the scary, gun-toting movie character), it transcribes the terminator
sequence and then stops transcription. What happens next varies depending
upon the organism.
 In prokaryotic cells, some terminator sequences have a series of bases
that are complementary and cause the mRNA to fold back on itself. The
folding stops RNA polymerase from moving forward and pulls the mRNA
off the template.
 In eukaryotic cells, a special protein called a termination factor aids RNA
in finding the right stopping place.
In any event, after RNA polymerase stops adding rNTPs, the mRNA gets
detached from the template. The holoenzyme and RNA polymerase let go
of the template, and the double-stranded DNA molecule snaps back into its
natural helix shape.
Post-transcription Processing
Before mRNA can venture out of the cell nucleus and into the cytoplasm for
translation, it needs a few modifications. And I just happen to cover them in
the following sections.
Adding cap and tail
The “naked” mRNA that’s produced by transcription needs to get dressed
before translation:
 A 5’ cap is added.
 A long tail of adenine bases is tacked on.
RNA polymerase starts the process of transcription by using an unmodified
rNTP (see the section “Initiation” earlier in this chapter). But a 5’ cap needs
to be added to the mRNA to allow the ribosome to recognize it during trans-
lation (see Chapter 9 for more on translation). The first part of adding the
cap is the removal of one of the three phosphates from the leading end of
the mRNA strand. A guanine, in the form of a ribonucleotide, is then attached
to the lead base of the mRNA. (Figure 8-7 illustrates the process of cap and
tail attachment to the mRNA.) Several groups composed of a carbon atom
with three hydrogen atoms (CH3, called a methyl group) attach at various
sites — on the guanine and on the first and second nucleotides of the
126
Part II: DNA: The Genetic Material 

mRNA. Like the methyl groups that protect the thymine-bearing DNA
molecule, the methyl groups at the 5’ end of the mRNA protect it from
decomposition as well as allow the ribosome to recognize the mRNA as
ready for translation.
In eukaryotes, a long string of adenines are added onto the 3’ end of the
mRNA to further protect the mRNA from natural nuclease activity long
enough to get translated (see Figure 8-7). This string is called the poly-A tail.
RNA molecules are easily degraded and destroyed because of their tempo-
rary natures. Like memos, RNA molecules are linked to a specific task, and
when the task is over, the memo is discarded. But the message has to last
long enough to be read, sometimes more than once, before it hits the shred-
der (in this case, nucleases do the shredding instead of guilty business
executives). The length of the poly-A tail determines how long the message
lasts and how many times it can be translated by the ribosomes before
nucleases eat the tail and destroy the message.
Editing the message
The final step in preparing mRNA for translation is twofold: removing the
noncoding intron sequences and stringing the exons together without inter-
ruptions between them. Several specialized types of RNA work to find the
start and end points of introns, pull the exons together, and snip out the
extra RNA (that is, the intron).
While it’s still in the nucleus, a complex of proteins and small RNA molecules
called a spliceosome inspect the newly manufactured mRNA. The spliceosome
is like a roaming workshop that recognizes introns and works to remove them

from between exons. The spliceosome recognizes consensus sequences that
mark the beginnings and endings of introns (take a look back at “Locating the
gene” to review consensus sequences). The spliceosome grabs each end of
the intron and pulls the ends toward each other to form a loop. This move-
ment has the effect of bringing the beginning of one exon close to the end of
the preceding one. The spliceosome then snips out the intron and hooks the
exons together in a process called splicing. Splicing creates a phosphodiester
bond between the two exon sequences, which seals them together as one
strand of mRNA.
Some introns have the ability to remove themselves from the mRNA
strand without the help of the spliceosome. The process is similar to the
spliceosome’s — the intron forms a loop, snips itself out, and splices
the exons together.
Introns can be spliced out leaving all the exons in their original order, or
introns and exons can be spliced out to create a new sequence of exons (see
Figure 8-6 for a couple of examples). The splicing of introns and exons is
called alternative splicing and results in the possibility for one gene to be
expressed in different ways. Thanks to alternative splicing, the 30,000 or so
genes in humans are able to produce around 90,000 different proteins.
The secret to the genetic flexibility of alternative splicing is sequences called
Alu elements. Alu elements are fairly short sequences that show up all over
the human genome (see Chapter 11 for how scientists are exploring the
human genome) — there may be as many as 1 million copies of Alu in your
DNA. Alu can be spliced into or out of genes (sometimes more than once) to
create alternative forms of mRNA from the same original gene sequence. This
sequence formerly known as “junk DNA” turns out to act as an exon. The
enormous versatility of RNA editing has lead some scientists to think of RNA
as “the” genetic material instead of DNA.
After the introns are spliced and all the exons are strung together, the
mRNA molecule is complete and ready for action. It migrates out of the cell
nucleus, encounters an army of ribosomes, and goes through the process
of translation — the final step in converting the genetic message from DNA
to protein.

Translating the Genetic Code
In This Chapter

 Molding polypeptides into functional proteins
F
rom the building instructions to implementation, the message carried by
DNA follows a very predictable path. First, DNA provides the template
for transcription of the message into RNA. Then, RNA (in the form of messen-
ger RNA) moves out of the cell nucleus and into the cytoplasm to provide the
building plans for proteins. Every living thing is made of proteins, which are
long chains of amino acids, called polypeptides, that are folded into complex
shapes and hooked together in innovative ways.
All the physical characteristics (that is, the phenotype) of your body are made
up of thousands of different proteins. Of course, your body is also composed
of other things, too, like water, minerals, and fats. But proteins supply the
framework to organize all those other building blocks, and proteins carry out
all the functions that your body needs to undergo, like digestion, respiration,
and elimination.
In this chapter, I explain how RNA provides the blueprint for manufacturing
proteins, the final step in the transformation from genotype (genetic informa-
tion) to phenotype. Before you can dive into the translation process, you
need to know a few things about the genetic code — the information carried
by mRNA — and how the code is read. If you skipped over Chapter 8, you
may want to go back and review its material on RNA before moving on.
Discovering the Good in a Degenerate
When Watson and Crick (along with Rosalind Franklin; see Chapter 6 for the
full scoop) discovered that DNA is made up of two strands composed of four
bases, the big question they faced was: How can only four bases contain
enough information to encode complex phenotypes?

Complex phenotypes (such as your bone structure, eye color, and ability to
digest spicy food) are the result of combinations of proteins. The genetic
code (that is, DNA transcribed as RNA; see Chapter 8) provides the instruc-
tions to make these proteins (via translation; covered in “Meeting the
Translating Team” later in this chapter). Proteins are made up of long chains
of amino acids. A total of twenty amino acids are found in proteins. These
amino acids are strung together in various combinations to create chains
called polypeptides (which is a fancy way of saying “protein”). Polypeptide
chains can vary from 50 to 1,000 amino acids in length. Because there are 20
different amino acids and because chains are often more than 100 amino
acids in length, the variety of combinations is enormous. For example, a
polypeptide that’s only 5 amino acids long has 3,200,000 combinations!
After experiments showed that DNA was truly the genetic material (see
Chapter 6), skeptics continued to point to the simplicity of the four bases
found in RNA and argued that a code of four bases wouldn’t work to encode
complex peptides. Reading the genetic code one base at a time — U, C, A,
and G — would mean that there simply aren’t enough bases to make 20
amino acids. So, it was obvious to scientists that the code must be made up
of multiple bases read together. A two-base code didn’t work because it only
produced 16 combinations — too few to account for 20 amino acids. A three-
base code (referred to as a triplet code) looked like overkill because a codon,
which is a combination of three nucleotides in a row, that chooses from four
bases at each position produces 64 possible combinations. Skeptics argued
that a triplet code contained too much redundancy — after all, there are only
20 amino acids.
As it turns out, the genetic code is degenerate, which is a fancy way of saying
“too much information.” Normally, degenerate means something to the effect
of “bad and getting worse” (it’s usually used to describe some people — I
won’t name names). In the genetic sense, the degeneracy of the triplet code
means that the code’s highly flexible and tolerates some mistakes — which is
a good thing.
Several features of the genetic code are important to keep in mind. The code is
 Triplet, meaning bases are read three at a time in codons.
 Degenerate, meaning 18 of the 20 amino acids are specified by two or
more codons (see the next section, “Considering the combinations”).
 Orderly, meaning each codon is read in only one way and in only one
direction, just as English is read left to right (see “Framed! Reading the
code” later in this chapter).
 Nearly universal, meaning just about every organism on earth inter-
prets the language of the code in exactly the same way (see “Not quite
universal” for exceptions).
130
Part II: DNA: The Genetic Material 

Considering the combinations
Only 61 of the 64 codons are used to specify the 20 amino acids found in pro-
teins. The three codons that don’t code for any amino acid simply spell “stop,”
telling the ribosome to cease the translation process (see “Termination” later
in this chapter). In contrast, the one codon that tells the ribosome that an
mRNA is ripe for translating — the “start” codon — codes for an amino acid,
methionine. (The “start” amino acid comes in a special form; see “Initiation”
later in this chapter.) In Figure 9-1, you can see the entire code with all the
alternative spellings for the 20 amino acids. (See “Meeting the Translating
Team” later in this chapter for more details about amino acids.)
As you can see in Figure 9-1, the number of alternative spellings for the differ-
ent amino acids varies from one (methionine and tryptophan) to as many as
six (leucine and serine).

Chapter 9: Translating the Genetic Code

For many of the amino acids, the alternative spellings differ only by one
base — the third base of the codon. For example, four of the six spellings for
leucine start with the bases CU. This flexibility at the third position of the
codon is called a wobble. The third base of the mRNA can vary, or wobble,
without changing the meaning of the codon and thus the amino acid it codes
for. The wobble is possible because of the way tRNAs (transfer RNAs) and
mRNAs pair up during the process of translation. The first two bases of the
code on the mRNA and the partner tRNA (which is carrying the amino acid
specified by the codon) must be exact matches. However, the third base of
the tRNA can break the base pairing rules, allowing bonds with mRNA bases
other than the usual complements. This rule violation, or wobble, allows for
different spellings to code for the same amino acid. However, some codons,
like one of the three stop codons (spelled UGA), have only one meaning;
wobbles in this stop codon change the meaning from stop to either cysteine
(spelled UGU or UGC) or tryptophan (UGG).
Framed! Reading the code
Besides its combination possibilities, another important feature of the genetic
code is the way in which the codons are read. Each codon is separate, with no
overlapping. And the code doesn’t have any punctuation either — it’s read
straight through without pauses.
The codons of the genetic code run sequentially, as you can see in Figure 9-2.
Each codon is read only once using a reading frame. A reading frame is a
series of sequential, nonoverlapping codons. The position of the reading
frame is defined by the start codon. In the mRNA pictured in Figure 9-2, the
sequence AUG, which spells methionine, is a start codon. After the start
codon, the bases are read three at a time without a break until the stop
codon is reached. (Mutations often disrupt the reading frame by inserting or
removing one base; see Chapter 13 for more details.)

Part II: DNA: The Genetic Material 

Not quite universal
The meaning of the genetic code is nearly universal. That means nearly every
organism on earth uses the same spellings in the triplet code. Mitochondrial
DNA spells a few words differently than nuclear DNA, which may explain or at
least relate back to mitochondria’s unusual origins (see Chapter 6). Plants,
bacteria, and a few microorganisms also use unusual spellings for one or
more amino acids. Otherwise, the way the code is read — influenced by its
degenerate nature, with wobbles, without punctuation, and using a specific
reading frame — is the same. As scientists tackle DNA sequencing for various
creatures (see Chapter 11), more unusual spellings are likely to pop up.
Meeting the Translating Team
Translation is the process of converting information from one language into
another. In this case, the genetic language of nucleic acid is translated into
the language of protein. Translation takes place in the cytoplasm of cells.
After messenger RNAs (mRNAs) are created through transcription and move
into the cytoplasm, the protein production process begins (see Chapter 8 for
the lowdown on mRNA). The players involved in protein production include:
 Ribosome: The big protein-making factory that reads mRNA’s message and
carries out the message’s instructions. Ribosomes are made up of riboso-
mal RNA (rRNA) and are capable of constructing any sort of protein.
 The genetic code: The message carried by mRNA (see “Discovering
the Good in a Degenerate Code” earlier in this chapter for more on the
genetic code).
 Amino acids: Complex chemical compounds containing nitrogen and
carbon; 20 amino acids strung together in thousands of unique combina-
tions are used to construct proteins.
 Transfer RNA (tRNA): Runs a courier service to provide amino-acid
building blocks to the working ribosome; each tRNA summoned by the
ribosome grabs the amino acid specified by the codon.
Taking the Translation Trip
Translation proceeds in a series of predictable steps:
1. A ribosome recognizes an mRNA and latches onto its 5’ cap (see Chapter 8
for an explanation of how and why mRNAs get caps). The ribosome slurps
up the mRNA and carefully scrutinizes it, looking for codons that form the
words of the genetic code beginning with the start codon.
133
Chapter 9: Translating the Genetic Code

2. tRNAs supply the amino acids dictated by each codon when the ribo-
some reads the instructions. The polypeptide chain is assembled by the
ribosome with the help of various enzymes and proteins.
3. The ribosome continues to assemble the polypeptide chain until it
reaches the stop codon. The completed polypeptide chain is released.
After it’s released from the ribosome, the polypeptide chain is modified and
folded to become a mature protein.
Initiation
Preparation for translation consists of two major events:
 The tRNA molecules must be hooked up with the right amino acids in a
process called charging.
 The ribosome, which comes in two pieces, must assemble itself at the
start codon of the mRNA.
Charge! tRNA hooks up with a nice amino acid
Transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules are small, specialized RNAs that are produced
by transcription. However, unlike mRNAs, tRNAs are never translated into pro-
tein; tRNA’s whole function is ferrying amino acids to the ribosomes for assem-
bly into polypeptides. tRNAs are uniquely shaped to carry out their jobs. In
Figure 9-3, you see two depictions of tRNA. The illustration on the left shows
you tRNA’s true form. The illustration on the right is a simplified version that
makes tRNA’s parts easier to identify. The cloverleaf shape is one of the keys to
the way tRNA works. tRNA gets its unusual configuration because many of the
bases in its sequence are complements; the strand folds, and the complemen-
tary bases form bonds, resulting in the loops and arms of a typical tRNA.
The two key elements of tRNA are:
 Anticodon: A three-base sequence on one loop of each tRNA; the anti-
codon is complementary to one of the codons spelled by mRNA.
 Acceptor arm: The single-stranded tail of the tRNA; where the amino
acid corresponding to the codon is attached to the tRNA.
The codon of mRNA specifies the amino acid used during translation. The
anticodon of the tRNA is complementary to the codon of mRNA and specifies
which amino acid each tRNA is built to carry.
Every cell has between 30 and 50 different tRNA molecules. Each amino acid
has its own tRNA, but some amino acids can be carried by more than one
sort of tRNA. These flexible tRNAs are called isoaccepting tRNAs.
134
Part II: DNA: The Genetic Material 

Like a battery, tRNAs must be charged in order to work. tRNAs get charged
with the help of a special group of enzymes called aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases.
Twenty synthetases exist, one for each amino acid specified by the codons of
mRNA. Take a look the illustration on the right in Figure 9-3, the schematic
of tRNA. The aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases recognize sequences of bases in the
anticodon of the tRNA that announce which amino acid that particular tRNA is
built to carry. When the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase encounters the tRNA mole-
cule that matches its amino acid, the synthetase binds the amino acid to the
tRNA at the acceptor arm — this is the charging part. Figure 9-4 shows the con-
nection of amino acid and tRNA. The synthetases proofread to make sure that
each amino acid is on the appropriate tRNA. This proofreading ensures that
errors in tRNA charging are very rare and prevents errors in translation later
on. With the amino acid attached to it, the tRNA is charged and ready to make
the trip to the ribosome.

Chapter 9: Translating the Genetic Code

Putting the ribosome together
Ribosomes come in two parts called subunits (see Figure 9-5), and ribosomal
subunits come in two sizes: large and small. The two subunits float around
(sometimes together and sometimes as separate pieces) in the cytoplasm
until translation begins. Unlike tRNAs, which match specific codons, ribosomes
are completely flexible and can work with any mRNA they encounter. Because
of their versatility, ribosomes are sometimes called the workbench of the cell.
When fully assembled, each ribosome has two sites and one slot:
 A-site (acceptor site): Where tRNA molecules insert their anticodon
arms to match up with the codon of the mRNA molecule
 P-site (peptidyl site): Where amino acids get hooked together using pep-
tide bonds
 Exit slot: Where tRNAs are released from the ribosome after their amino
acids become part of the growing polypeptide chain

Part II: DNA: The Genetic Material 

Before translation can begin, the smaller of the two ribosome subunits recog-
nizes and attaches to the 5’ cap of the mRNA with the help of proteins called
initiation factors. The small subunit then scoots along the mRNA until it hits
the start codon (AUG). The P-site on the small ribosome subunit lines up with
the start codon, and the small subunit is joined by the tRNA carrying methio-
nine (UAC), the amino acid that matches the start codon. The “start” tRNA
totes a special version of methionine called fMet (short for N-formylmethionine).
This complex name refers to the fact that this is the only amino acid that can
begin a polypeptide chain. Only the tRNA for fMet can attach to the ribosome
at the P-site without first going through the A-site. The tRNA uses its anti-
codon, which is complementary to the codon of the mRNA, to hook up to the
mRNA. The large ribosome subunit joins together with the small subunit to
begin the process of hooking together all the amino acids specified by the
mRNA (see Figure 9-5).
Elongation
When the initiation process is complete, translation proceeds in several
steps called elongation, which you can follow in Figure 9-5.
1. The ribosome calls for the tRNA carrying the amino acid specified by
the codon residing in the A-site. The appropriate charged tRNA inserts
its anticodon arm into the A-site.
2. Enzymes bond the two amino acids attached to the acceptor arms of the
tRNAs in the P- and A-sites.
3. As soon as the two amino acids are bonded, the ribosome scoots over
to the next codon of the mRNA. The tRNA that was formerly in the P-site
now enters the exit site, and because it’s no longer charged with an
amino acid, the empty tRNA is released from the ribosome. The A-site
is left empty, and the P-site is occupied by a tRNA holding its own amino
acid plus the amino acid of the preceding tRNA. The process of moving
from one codon to the next is called translocation (not to be confused
with the chromosomal translocations described in Chapter 15, where
pieces of whole chromosomes are inappropriately swapped).
The ribosome continues to scoot along the mRNA in a 5’ to 3’ direction. The
growing polypeptide chain is always attached to the tRNA that’s sitting in
the P-site, and the A-site is opened up over and over again to accept the next
charged tRNA. The process comes to a stop when the ribosome encounters
one of the three codons that specify “stop.” (For more on stop codons, see
“Considering the combinations,” earlier in this chapter.)
137
Chapter 9: Translating the Genetic Code

Termination
No tRNAs match the stop codon, so when the ribosome reads “stop,” no
more tRNAs enter the A-site (see Figure 9-6). At this point, a tRNA sits in the
P-site with the newly constructed polypeptide chain attached to it by the
tRNA’s own amino acid. Special proteins called release factors move in and
bind to the ribosome; one of the release factors recognizes the stop codon
and sparks the reaction that cleaves the polypeptide chain from the last
tRNA. After the polypeptide is released, the ribosome comes apart, releasing
the final tRNA from the P-site. The ribosomal subunits are then free to find
another mRNA to begin the translation process anew. Transfer RNAs are
recharged with fresh amino acids and can be used over and over. Once freed,
polypeptide chains assume their unique shapes and sometimes hook up with
other polypeptides to carry out their jobs as fully functioning proteins (see
the “Proteins Are Precious Polypeptides” section later in the chapter).
Messenger RNAs may be translated more than once and, in fact, may be
translated by more than one ribosome at a time. As soon as the start codon
emerges from the ribosome after the initiation of translation, another ribo-
some may recognize the mRNA’s 5’ cap, latch on, and start translating. Thus,
many polypeptide chains may be manufactured very rapidly.
138
Part II: DNA: The Genetic Material 
Walking the Dogma
In other disciplines (say, physics), laws abound
to describe the goings-on of the world. The law
of gravity, for example, tolerates no violators.
But genetics doesn’t have many laws because
scientists keep acquiring new information. One
exception is the Central Dogma of Genetics.
Dogma isn’t law; rather, it’s more or less univer-
sally accepted opinion about how the world
works. In this case, the Central Dogma of
Genetics (coined by our old friend, Francis
Crick, of DNA-discovery fame; see Chapter 6)
says that the trip from genotype to phenotype is
a one-way street. After RNA’s message is used
to manufacture proteins through a process
called translation, the operation can’t be
reversed. Although we can infer what the RNA
message must have been in order to make the
resulting protein, we can’t convert the proteins
themselves back into RNA.
Another idea that nearly attains the status of law
is the one gene–one polypeptide hypothesis.
Polypeptides, or as they’re more familiarly called
proteins, are the products of gene messages.
Back in the early 1940s, long before DNA was
known to be the genetic material, two scientists,
George Beadle and Edward Tatum, determined
that genes code for proteins. Through a complex
set of experiments, Beadle and Tatum discov-
ered that each protein chain manufactured
during translation is the product of only one
gene’s message. If you read Chapter 8, you may
be scratching your head right about now. Yes,
many different mRNA combinations are possible
from a single gene (thanks to the alternative
splicing thing I cover in Chapter 8). But each
combination acts alone to make one, and only
one, protein. So, even though it’s possible to
make multiple mRNAs from a single DNA mes-
sage, each mRNA gets translated individually.

Proteins Are Precious Polypeptides
Besides water, the most common substance in your cells is protein. Proteins
carry out the business of life. The key to a protein’s function is its shape;
completed proteins can be made of one or more polypeptide chains that are
folded and hooked together. The way proteins fit and fold together depends
on which amino acids are present in the polypeptide chains.

Chapter 9: Translating the Genetic Code

Recognizing radical groups
Every amino acid in a polypeptide chain shares several features, which you
can see in Figure 9-7:
 A positively charged amino group (NH2) attached to a central carbon
atom
 A negatively charged carboxyl group (COOH) attached to the central
carbon atom opposite the amino group
 A unique combination of atoms that form branches and rings, called
radical groups, that differentiate the 20 amino acids specified by the
genetic code

Part II: DNA: The Genetic Material 
Oh, the difference a single amino acid makes
Hemoglobin proteins were one of the first pro-
teins to be studied in detail, and the blood disor-
der sickle cell anemia was one of the first
diseases to be understood from mutation at the
DNA-level to phenotype. Sickle cell anemia was
first described in 1910 when Dr. James Herrick
published his case study of a young patient. The
young man, a dental student, came to Dr. Ernest
Irons, a 27-year-old intern, complaining of severe
fatigue. His enlarged heart seemed completely
overworked, and he was clearly anemic (his
blood didn’t contain enough hemoglobin to bring
oxygen to his tissues). When Dr. Irons examined
the young man’s blood cells under a microscope,
many of the cells looked odd. Instead of the
normal, fat, donut-like shape Dr. Irons expected,
many of the cells were comma-shaped, like a
sickle (a knife used to harvest grain). Dr. Irons
notified his supervisor, Dr. Herrick, who called
the disorder sickle-cell anemia — a name it car-
ries to this day. (When Herrick published his
account of the case, he never mentioned Irons’s
role in the discovery of the disease.)
Sickle-cell anemia affects millions of people of
African descent. In tropical climates where
malaria is common, the presence of one allele
for sickle-cell actually confers some immunity
to this mosquito-transmitted disease. But per-
sons who are homozygous (carrying two identi-
cal copies of an allele; see Chapter 2) for
sickle-cell suffer from debilitating blood clots in
their tiniest blood vessels — namely those in
fingers, toes, and kidneys. The red blood cells
of patients with sickle-cell disease take on the
comma shape when oxygen levels in the blood
are lower than normal, like when children are
running full blast at play. The blood cell takes on
this odd shape because the proteins don’t fold
properly. A single erroneous amino acid (valine)
in each of the two beta-chains is substituted for
the correct amino acid (glutamic acid). This one
tiny change in the hemoglobin protein causes
many people to suffer and die from sickle-cell
disease each year.

Amino acid radical groups come in four different flavors: water-loving
(hydrophilic), water-hating (hydrophobic), negatively charged (bases), and
positively charged (acids). When their amino acids are part of a polypeptide
chain, radical groups of adjacent amino acids alternate sides along the chain
(see Figure 9-7). Because of their differing affinities (those four flavors), the
radical groups either repel or attract neighboring groups. This reaction leads
to folding and gives each protein its shape.

Chapter 9: Translating the Genetic Code

Giving the protein its shape
Proteins are folded into complex and often beautiful shapes, as you can see
in Figure 9-8. (To see more of the amazing forms proteins can get into, check
out some of the Web sites I list in Chapter 24.) These arrangements are partly
the result of spontaneous attractions between radical groups (see the pre-
ceding section for details) and partly the result of certain regions of polypep-
tide chains that naturally form spirals (also called helices, not to be confused
with DNA’s double helix in Chapter 6). The spirals may weave back and forth
to form sheets. These spirals and sheets are referred to as a secondary struc-
ture (the simple, unfolded polypeptide chain is the primary structure).
Proteins are often modified after translation and may get hooked up with var-
ious other chemical groups and metals (such as iron). In a process similar to
the post-transcription modification of mRNA, proteins may also be sliced and
spliced. Some protein modifications result in natural folds, twists, and turns,
but sometimes the protein needs help forming its correct conformation.
That’s what chaperones are for.
Chaperones are molecules that mold the protein into shape, kind of like a plastic
surgeon on one of those TV makeover shows. Chaperones push and pull the
protein chains until the appropriate radical groups are close enough to one
another to form chemical bonds. This sort of folding is called a tertiary structure.
When two or more polypeptide chains are hooked to make a single protein,
they’re said to have a fourth degree, or quaternary structure. For example,
the hemoglobin protein that carries oxygen in your blood is a well-studied
protein with a quaternary structure. Two pairs of polypeptide chains form a
single hemoglobin protein. The chains, two called alpha-globin chains and two
called beta-globin chains, each form helices, which you can see in Figure 9-8,
that wind around and fold back on themselves into tertiary structures.
Associated with the tertiary structures are iron-rich heme groups that have
a strong affinity for oxygen. Take a look at the sidebar “Oh, the difference a
single amino acid makes” for more about the complex folds of hemoglobin.
For more on how good proteins go bad, flip ahead to Chapters 10 and 13.

What a Cute Pair of Genes:
Gene Expression
In This Chapter

E
very cell in your body (with very few exceptions) carries the entire set
of genetic instructions that make, well, everything about you. Your eye
cells contain the genes for growing hair. Your skin cells contain the genes that
code for your eye color. Your nerve cells contain the genes that turn on cell
division — yet your nerve cells don’t divide (under normal conditions; see
Chapter 14 for what happens when things go wrong). Even genes that are
supposed to be active in certain cells aren’t active all the time — instead,
those genes are turned on only when needed and then turned off again, like
turning off the light in a room when you leave.
In a nutshell, this chapter explains why, then, your eyeballs aren’t hairy, and
that explanation boils down to the subject of gene expression. Gene expression
is how genes make their products at the right time and in the right place. All
the available genes aren’t active in all cells all the time, so geneticists say that
gene expression is tissue-specific, meaning only certain genes are active and
working for each tissue type. This chapter examines how your genes work and
what controls them.

Getting Your Genes Under Control
Gene expression occurs throughout an organism’s life, starting at the very
beginning. When an organism develops — first as a zygote (the fertilized egg)
and later as an embryo — genes turn on to regulate the process. At first, all
the cells are exactly alike, but that characteristic quickly changes. (Cells that
have the ability to turn into any kind of tissue are totipotent; see Chapter 20
for more on totipotency.) Cells get instructions from their DNA to turn into
certain kinds of tissues, such as skin, heart, and bone. After the tissue type is
decided, certain genes in each cell become active, and others get perma-
nently turned off. That’s because gene expression is highly tissue-specific,
meaning certain genes are active only in certain tissues or at particular
stages of development.
In part, the tissue-specific nature of gene expression is due to location —
genes in cells respond to cues from the cells around them. Other than loca-
tion, some genes respond to cues from the environment; other genes are set
up to come on and then turn off at a certain stage of development. Take the
genes that code for hemoglobin, for example.
Your genome (your complete set of genetic information) contains a large group
of genes that all code for various components that make up the big protein,
called hemoglobin, that carries oxygen in your blood. Hemoglobin’s a complex
structure composed of two different types of proteins that are folded and
joined together in pairs (see Chapter 9 for how proteins are produced and get
folded to become functional). During your development, nine different hemo-
globin genes interacted at different times to make three kinds of hemoglobin.
Changing conditions make it necessary for you to have three different sorts of
hemoglobin at different stages of your life. When you were an embryo and later,
a fetus, you depended on your mother for oxygen. The oxygen in your mom’s
blood had to cross a membrane to get to you. The process of crossing any
membrane is somewhat inefficient, so to compensate for the inefficiency of
the transfer, your blood had to be extremely good at carrying oxygen to sustain
your growth and development.
When you were still an embryo, your hemoglobin was composed mostly of
epsilon-hemoglobin (Greek letters are used to identify the various types
of hemoglobin). After about three months of development, the epsilon-
hemoglobin gene was turned off in favor of two fetal hemoglobin genes
(alpha and gamma). (Fetal hemoglobin is comprised of two proteins —
two alphas and two gammas — folded and joined together as one functional
piece.) When you were born, the gene producing the gamma-hemoglobin
was shut off, and the beta-hemoglobin gene, which works for the rest of
your life, kicked in.
144
Part II: DNA: The Genetic Material 

The genes controlling the production of all these hemoglobins are on two
chromosomes, 11 and 16 (see Figure 10-1). The genes on both chromo-
somes are turned on in order, starting at one end of the group (the 5’ end;
see Chapter 6 for how DNA’s set up with numbered ends) for embryonic
hemoglobin. Adult hemoglobin is produced by the last set of genes on the
3’ end.
145
Chapter 10: What a Cute Pair of Genes: Gene Expression
Heat and light
Organisms have to respond quickly to changing
conditions in order to survive. When external
conditions turn on genes, it’s called induction.
Responses to heat and light are two types of
induction that are particularly well understood.
When an organism is exposed to high temper-
atures, a suite of genes immediately kicks into
action to produce heat-shock proteins. Heat
has the nasty effect of mangling proteins so
that they’re unable to function properly,
referred to as denaturing. You’re already famil-
iar with this effect — when you fry an egg, the
clear albumin proteins denature and become
opaque. Heat-shock proteins are produced by
roughly 20 different genes and act to prevent
other proteins from becoming denatured. Heat-
shock proteins can also repair protein damage
and refold proteins to bring them back to life.
The genes that make heat-shock proteins are
always on stand-by, ready for action as soon as
heat creates a need for them. Heat-shock
responses are best studied in fruit flies, but
humans have a large number of heat-shock
genes, too. These genes protect you from the
effects of stress and pollutants. You’re exposed
to various sorts of pollutants and toxins all the
time, and without heat-shock genes, you would
age more quickly (because of accelerated cell
death) and could become seriously ill as your
organs lost large numbers of cells.
Plants must be able to respond to changing
light conditions. A plant converts light energy
into sugars (which supply it with energy) with
the help of an enzyme, RBC (RBC stands for the
tongue-twister 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase).
Plants only produce RBC when they’re exposed
to light. Like its name, RBC is a big, complex pro-
tein made up of large and small parts called
subunits (like the parts of ribosomes; see
Chapter 9). The subunits of RBC are made by dif-
ferent genes, which, in many plants, are found
in the chloroplast, that ring of DNA that only
plants possess. Exposure to light kicks off tran-
scription of the RBC genes.
Plants aren’t the only organisms that respond to
light. Various bird species monitor the length of
the days to know when to migrate. Your daily
rhythms of sleeping and waking are controlled,
in part, by light. Even your mood may have a
light connection. Many people suffer from a
condition called seasonal affective disorder, or
SAD — basically, the wintertime blues. SAD
causes people to feel depressed, low on energy,
and generally blah. Light signals your brain to
slow its production of melatonin, the hormone
that helps you sleep, but when the days are
short and dark, your brain gets carried away
and makes too much melatonin, leaving you
groggy and down in the dumps. The symptoms
of SAD seem to be relieved by exposure to sun-
light or commercially available full-spectrum
lights because exposure to light regulates the
melatonin gene — a period of darkness turns it
on, and bright light turns it off.

Transcriptional Control of 
Gene Expression
Most gene control in eukaryotes, like you and me, occurs during transcrip-
tion. The basic transcription process is covered in Chapter 8; this section
covers how and when transcription is carried out to control when genes are
and aren’t expressed.
When a gene is “on,” it’s being transcribed. When the gene is “off,” transcrip-
tion is suspended. The only way that proteins (the stuff phenotype is made
of; see Chapter 9) can be produced during translation is through the work of
messenger RNA (mRNA). Transcription produces the mRNAs used in transla-
tion; therefore, when transcription is happening, translation is in motion, and
gene expression is on. When transcription is stopped, gene expression is shut
down, too. The timing of transcription can be controlled by a number of fac-
tors, which include:
 DNA accessibility
 Regulation from other genes
 Signals sent to genes from other cells by way of hormones

Part II: DNA: The Genetic Material 

DNA must unwind a bit from its tight coils in order to be available for tran-
scription to occur.
Tightly wound: The effect 
of DNA packaging
The default state of your genes is off, not on. Starting in the off position makes
sense when you remember that almost every cell in your body contains a
complete set of all your genes. You just can’t have every gene in every cell
flipped on and running amuck all the time; you want specific genes acting only
in the tissues where their actions are needed. Therefore, keeping genes turned
off is every bit as important as turning them on.
Genes are kept in the off position in two ways:
 Tight packaging: DNA packaging is a highly effective mechanism to
make sure that most genes are off most of the time because it prevents
transcription from occurring by preventing transcription factors from
getting access to the genes. DNA is an enormous molecule, and the only
way it can be scrunched down small enough to fit into your cell’s nuclei
is by being tightly wound round and round itself in supercoils. First, the
DNA is wrapped around special proteins called histones. Then, the DNA
and the histones, which together look a bit like beads on a string, are
wrapped around and around themselves to form the dense DNA known
as chromatin. When DNA’s wrapped up this way, it can’t be transcribed
because transcription factors can’t bind to the DNA to find the template
strand and copy it.
 Repressors: Some proteins act to block transcription and prevent it from
occurring. Repressors prevent transcription by binding to the same DNA
sites that transcription activators would normally use or by interfering
with the activities of the group of enzymes that kick off transcription
(called the holoenzyme complex; see Chapter 8). In either case, DNA is
prevented from unwinding, and the genes are kept turned off.
But genes can’t stay off forever. So certain sections of DNA come pre-packaged
for unwinding, allowing the genes in those areas to be turned on more easily
whenever they’re needed.
To find out which genes are prepackaged for unwrapping, researchers exposed
DNA to an enzyme called DNase I, which actually digests DNA. DNase I isn’t a
part of normal transcription; instead, it provides a signal to geneticists that
a region of packaged DNA is less tightly wound than regions around it.
Geneticists added DNase I to DNA to see which parts of the genome were
sensitive to being degraded by the enzyme’s activity. The sections of DNA left
147
Chapter 10: What a Cute Pair of Genes: Gene Expression

behind in these experiments contained genes that were always turned off in the
tissue type the cell belonged to. The parts that were digested weren’t tightly
wound and thus harbored the genes that could be turned on when needed.
To turn genes on, the DNA must be removed from its packaging. To unwrap
DNA from the nucleosomes, specific proteins must bind to the DNA to unwind
it. There are lots of proteins including transcription factors, collectively known
as chromatin-remodeling complexes, that carry out the job of unwinding DNA
depending on the needs of the organism. Most of these proteins attach to a
region near the gene to be activated and push the nucleosomes aside to free
the DNA up for transcription. As soon as the DNA is available, transcription
factors, which in some types of cells are always lurking around, latch on and
immediately get to work.
As I explain in Chapter 8, transcription gets started when a group of enzymes
called the holoenzyme complex binds to the promoter sequence of the DNA.
Promoter sequences are part of the genes they control and are found a few
bases away. Transcription activator proteins are part of the mix. These proteins
help get all the right components in place at the gene at the right moment.
Transcription activators also have the ability to shove nucleosomes out of
the way to make the DNA template available for transcription.
Genes controlling genes
Genes are often controlled by the actions of other genes. There are four types
of genes that micromanage the activities of others. In this section, I’ve divided
these genes up into two groups based on how they relate to one another.
Micromanaging transcription
Three types of genes act as regulatory agents to turn transcription up
(enhancers), turn it down (silencers), or drown out the effects of enhancing
or silencing elements (insulators).
 Enhancers: This type of gene sequence turns on transcription and speeds
it up, making transcription happen faster and more often. Unlike promoter
sequences, which are always located just a few bases “upstream” from the
genes they control (see Chapter 8 for navigating directions), enhancers
can be upstream, downstream, or even smack in the middle of the tran-
scription unit. Furthermore, enhancers have the unique ability to control
genes that are very distantly located (like thousands of bases away) from
the enhancer’s position. Nonetheless, enhancers are very tissue-specific
in their activities — they only influence genes that are normally activated
in that particular cell type.
148
Part II: DNA: The Genetic Material 

Researchers are still working to get a handle on how enhancers do their
jobs. Like the proteins that turn transcription on, enhancers seem to
have the ability to rearrange nucleosomes and pave the way for tran-
scription to occur. The enhancer teams up with transcription factors
to form a complex called the enhanceosome. The enhanceosome attracts
chromatin-remodeling proteins to the team along with RNA polymerase
to allow the enhancer to supervise transcription directly.
 Silencers: On the flip side of transcription regulation are the silencers.
These are gene sequences that hook up with repressor proteins to slow
or stop transcription. Like enhancers, silencers can be many thousands
of bases away from the genes they control. Silencers work to keep the
DNA tightly packaged and unavailable for transcription.
 Insulators: Sometimes called boundary elements, these sequences
have a slightly different job. Insulators work to protect some genes
from the effects of silencers and enhancers, confining the activity of
those sequences to the right sets of genes. Usually, this protection
means that the insulator must be positioned between the enhancer
(or silencer) and the genes that are off limits to the enhancer’s (or
silencer’s) activities.
Given that enhancers and silencers are often far away from the genes they
control, you may be wondering how they’re able to do their jobs. Most
geneticists think that the DNA must loop around to allow enhancers and
silencers to come in close proximity to the genes they influence. Figure 10-2
illustrates this looping action. The promoter region begins with the TATA box
and extends to the beginning of the gene itself. Enhancers interact with the
promoter region to regulate transcription.
Jumping genes: Transposable elements
Some genes like to travel. They hop around from place to place inserting
themselves into a variety of locations, both causing mutations in genes and
DNA

Chapter 10: What a Cute Pair of Genes: Gene Expression

changing the ways other genes do business. These wanderers are called
transposable elements (TEs), and they’re quite common — 50 percent of your
DNA is made up of transposable elements, also known as jumping genes.
Barbara McClintock discovered TEs in 1948. She called them controlling ele-
ments because they control gene expression of other genes. McClintock was
studying the genetics of corn when she realized that genes with a habit of fre-
quently changing location were controlling kernel color. In her research,
these genes showed up first on one chromosome, but in another individual,
the genes mapped to a completely different chromosome. (You can find out
more about Dr. McClintock in Chapter 22.)
It appears that TEs travel at will, showing up whenever and wherever they
please. How they pull off this trick isn’t completely clear because TEs have
several options when it comes to travel. They take advantage of breaks in
DNA, but not just any break will do — the break must include little overhang-
ing bits of single-stranded DNA (see Figure 10-3). Some TEs replicate them-
selves to hop into the broken spots. Others, which go by the special name
retrotransposons, make use of RNA to do the job.

Part II: DNA: The Genetic Material 

Retrotransposons are transcribed just like all other DNA (an RNA transcript is
produced). But then the RNA transcript is transcribed again by a special
enzyme to make a double-stranded DNA copy of the RNA transcript. Because
the end result is a DNA copy made from an RNA transcript, the process used by
retrotransposons is called reverse transcription. The DNA copy is then inserted
into a break and the newly copied retrotransposon makes itself comfortable.
The most common retrotransposon in humans is the Alu element. You’ve got
around a million or so copies of Alu and its relatives in your DNA. Alu ele-
ments and other, similar sequences called LINE elements (for Long
Interspersed Sequences) control gene expression by inserting copies of
themselves all over the genome. Some copies of Alu are known as signal
recognition particles and control the expression of other genes by stopping
translation as well as intercepting signals sent by other cells.
Hormones turn me on
Hormones are complex chemicals that control gene expression. They’re
secreted by a wide range of tissues in the brain, gonads (organs or glands,
such as ovaries and testes, that produce reproductive cells), and other
glands throughout the body. Hormones circulate in the bloodstream and can
affect tissues far away from the hormones’ production sites. In this way, they
can affect genes in many different tissues simultaneously. Essentially, hor-
mones act like a master switch for gene regulation all over the body. Take a
look at the sidebar “Hormones make your genes go wild” for more about the
effects hormones have on your body.
151
Chapter 10: What a Cute Pair of Genes: Gene Expression
Hormones make your genes go wild
Dioxins are long-lived chemicals that are
released into the environment through inciner-
ation of waste, coal-burning power plants,
paper manufacturing, and metal smelting oper-
ations, to name a few. It turns out that dioxin can
mimic estrogens and turn on genes all by itself.
That’s scary because it means that dioxin can
cause cancer and birth defects.
Dioxin is a chemical with an unfortunate affin-
ity for fat. Animals store dioxin in their fat cells,
so most of the dioxins you’re exposed to come
in the food you eat. Meats and dairy products
are the worst offenders, but fatty fish some-
times contain elevated levels, too. It’s long been
known that dioxins affect estrogens, the hor-
mones that control reproduction in women and,
to some degree, men, too. The good news is that
dioxin levels are on the decline. Dioxin emis-
sions have declined by 90 percent over the last
18 years. Unfortunately, dioxin that’s already
present in the environment breaks down slowly,
so it’s likely to persist for some time to come.

Part II: DNA: The Genetic Material 
A swing and a miss: The genetic effects 
of anabolic steroids
Anabolic steroids (or more correctly, anabolic-
androgenic steroids) are in the news a lot these
days. These steroids are synthetic forms of
testosterone, the hormone that controls male sex
determination (see Chapter 5). The anabolic
aspect of anabolic-androgenic steroids refers to
chemicals that increase muscle mass; the andro-
genic aspect refers to chemicals that control
gonad functions such as sex drive and, in the
case of men, sperm production. High-profile ath-
letes, including some famous baseball players,
may have abused one or more of these drugs in
an effort to improve performance. Reports also
suggest that use of anabolic steroids is common
among young athletes in high school and college.
Hormones like testosterone control gene expres-
sion. Research suggests that testosterone exerts
its anabolic effects by depressing the activity of
a tumor suppressor gene that produces the pro-
tein p27. (Mutations of p27 are implicated in one
form of leukemia, a blood cancer. For more on
tumor suppressor genes and their role in can-
cers, flip to Chapter 14.) When p27 is depressed
in muscle tissue, the tissue’s cells can divide
more rapidly, resulting in the bulky physique
prized by some athletes. Anabolic steroids
apparently also accelerate the effects of the
gene that causes male pattern baldness (see
Chapter 5); thus, men carrying that allele and
taking anabolic steroids become permanently
bald faster and at a younger age than normal.
Defects in tumor-suppressor genes such as p27
are widely associated with cancer. Not only that,
but some cancers depend on hormones to pro-
vide signals that tumor cells respond to (by multi-
plying). At least one study suggests that anabolic
steroids are actually carcinogenic, meaning that
their chemicals cause mutations that lead to
cancer. Because illegally obtained steroids may
also contain additional unwanted and potentially
carcinogenic chemicals, mutagenic chemicals
may be introduced into the body while simulta-
neously depressing the activity of a tumor-
suppressor gene. It doesn’t take a genius to real-
ize that this is dangerous. Cancers associated
with anabolic-androgenic steroid abuse include
liver cancer, testicular cancer, leukemia, and
prostate cancer. Men with family histories of
prostate or breast cancer should be especially
cautious with steroid use because some scien-
tists think that steroid use may increase the like-
lihood of cancer in people already at risk for the
disease.
Anabolic steroid use has many side effects. Men
may experience temporary loss of sperm pro-
duction along with permanent enlargement of
the breast tissue (a condition called gyneco-
mastia). Additionally, these drugs increase sex
drive but decrease the ability to get and maintain
an erection (in other words, the spirit is willing,
but the body is weak). Anabolic steroids also
cause blood pressure to increase to potentially
dangerous levels. Some men taking anabolic
steroids have suffered heart attacks, and many
experience permanent enlargement of the left
side of the heart (the part that handles pumping
blood out to the rest of the body). Violent behav-
ior is also associated with the use of steroids;
men often experience excessive rage and patho-
logically high energy levels (known in medical
circles as mania). “Nutritional supplements”
(such as Andro, the one Mark McGwire report-
edly used) are chemical precursors of testos-
terone. However, these supplements appar-
ently do little to increase muscle mass or
enhance performance in any measurable way.
Instead, they’re associated with significant
reductions in the “good” cholesterol (HDL,
thought to protect the heart and blood vessels),
and preteens taking these supplements are at
risk for permanently stunted growth.

Some hormones are such large molecules that they often can’t cross into
the cells directly. These large hormone molecules rely on receptor proteins
inside the cell to transmit their messages for them in a process called signal
transduction. Other hormones, like steroids, are fat-soluble and small, so they
easily pass directly into the cell to hook up with receptor proteins (check
out the sidebar “A swing and a miss: The genetic effects of anabolic steroids”
for details about the effects of performance-enhancing steroids). Receptor
proteins (and hormones small enough to enter the cell on their own) form a
complex that moves into the cell nucleus to act as a transcription factor to
turn specific genes on.
The genes that react to hormone signals are controlled by DNA sequences
called hormone response elements (HREs). HREs sit close to the genes they
regulate and bind with the hormone-receptor complex. Several HREs can
influence the same gene — in fact, the more HREs present, the faster tran-
scription takes place in that particular gene.
Retroactive Control: Things That
Happen After Transcription
After genes are transcribed into mRNA, their actions can still be controlled
by events that occur later.
Nip and tuck: RNA splicing
As you discover in Chapter 8, genes have sections called exons that actually
code for protein products. Often, in between the exons are introns, interrup-
tions of noncoding DNA that may or may not do anything. When genes are
transcribed, the whole thing, exons and introns, are all copied into mRNA.
The mRNA transcript has to be edited — meaning the introns are removed —
in preparation for translation. When multiple introns are present in the
unedited transcript, various combinations of exons can result from the editing
process. Exons can be edited out, too, yielding new proteins when translation
rolls around. This creative editing process allows genes to be expressed in new
ways; one gene can code for more than one protein. This genetic flexibility is
credited for the massive numbers of proteins you produce relative to the
number of genes you have (see Chapter 8 for more on the potential of gene
editing).
One gene in which genetic flexibility is very apparent is Dscam. Dscam is
named for the human disorder it’s associated with: Down Syndrome Cell
Adhesion Molecule. (Dscam may play a role in causing the mental disabilities
that accompany Down syndrome.) In fruit flies, Dscam is a large gene with
115 exons and at least 100 splicing sites. Altogether, Dscam is capable of
153
Chapter 10: What a Cute Pair of Genes: Gene Expression

coding for a whopping 30,016 different proteins. However, protein production
from Dscam is tightly regulated; some of its products only show up during
early stages of fly development. The human version of Dscam is less showy in
that it makes only a few proteins, but other genes in the human genome are
likely to be as productive at making proteins as Dscam of fruit flies, making
this a “fruitful” avenue of research. Humans have very few genes relative to
the number of proteins we have in our bodies. Genes like Dscam may help
geneticists understand how a few genes can work to produce many proteins.
With scientists wise to the nip and tuck game played by mRNA, the next step
in deciphering this sort of gene regulation is figuring out how the trick is
done and what controls it. Researchers know that a complex of proteins
called a spliceosome carries out much of the work in cutting and pasting
genes together. How the spliceosome’s activities are regulated is another
matter altogether. Knowing how it all works will come in handy though,
because some forms of cancer, most notably pancreatic cancer, are the prod-
uct of alternative splicing run amok.
154
Part II: DNA: The Genetic Material 
Interfering RNAs knock out genes
The best way to understand how a gene works
is to make it stop. That’s why the first gene func-
tion studies were done by inducing mutations
(which I address in Chapter 13) and observing
what went wrong with the organism (sounds a
bit brutal, doesn’t it?). To say the least, using
randomly induced mutations is a blunt-force
approach because there’s no way to target
specific genes. As technology became more
sophisticated and geneticists learned more about
the identity of DNA sequences (see Chapter 11),
new approaches were developed. Geneticists
learned how to introduce mutations directly into
certain genes through a process called site-
directed mutagenesis.
In another method to figure out how genes
work, gene sequences can be snipped out of
their DNA, mutated, and then introduced into
the chromosome of the target organism using a
process similar to cloning (which I cover in
Chapter 20). This process creates a transgenic
organism — that is, an organism that carries a
foreign gene. (Transgenic is a more accurate
way of saying genetically modified; this subject
is covered in detail in Chapter 19.) Knockout
mice are a product of the transgenic approach
to studying genes. The idea is to completely dis-
able (or knock out) a gene and then study the
effects of the loss-of-function (see Chapter 13
for more on loss-of-function mutations).
The world of RNAi (RNA interference; see “Shut
up! mRNA silencing”) is changing the way
geneticists study genes. The breakthrough
moment came when two geneticists, Andrew
Fire and Craig Mello, realized that by introduc-
ing certain double-stranded RNA molecules into
roundworms, they could shut off genes at will.
It turns out that for roundworms, scientists can
put the RNAi into their food and knock out gene
function not only in the worm that eats the con-
coction but in its offspring, too! Since this dis-
covery in 2003, geneticists have used RNAi to
knock out genes in all sorts of organisms,
including chickens and mice. The most promis-
ing applications for RNAi are in gene therapy
(jump to Chapter 16 for that discussion). Work is
also underway to knock out the function of
genes in viruses and cancer cells.

Shut up! mRNA silencing
After transcription produces mRNA, genes may be regulated through mRNA
silencing. mRNA silencing is basically interfering with the mRNA somehow so
that it doesn’t get translated. Exactly how organisms like you and me use
mRNA silencing, called RNAi (for RNA interference), to regulate genes isn’t
fully understood. Geneticists know that most organisms use RNAi to stymie
translation of unwanted mRNAs and that double-stranded RNA provides the
signal for the initiation of RNAi, but the details are still a mystery. The discov-
ery of RNAi has produced a revolution in the way genes are studied; see the
sidebar “Interfering RNAs knock out genes” for more.
RNA silencing isn’t just used to regulate the genes of an organism; sometimes
it’s used to protect an organism from the genes of viruses. When the organism’s
defenses detect a double-stranded virus RNA, an enzyme called Dicer is pro-
duced. Dicer chops the double-stranded RNA into short bits (about 20 or 25
bases long). These short strands of RNA, now called small interfering RNAs
(siRNAs), are then used as weapons against remaining viral RNAs. The siRNAs
turn traitor, first pairing up with RNA-protein complexes produced by the host
and then guiding those complexes to intact viral RNA. The viral RNAs are then
summarily destroyed and degraded.
mRNA expiration dates
After mRNAs are sliced, diced, capped, and tailed (see Chapter 8 for how
mRNA gets dressed up), they’re transported to the cell’s cytoplasm. From
that moment onward, mRNA’s on a path to destruction because enzymes in
the cytoplasm routinely chew up mRNAs as soon as they arrive. Thus,
mRNAs have a relatively short lifespan, the length of which (and therefore
the number of times mRNA can be translated into protein) is controlled by a
number of factors. But the mRNA’s poly-A tail (the long string of adenines
tacked on to the 3’ end) seems to be one of the most important features in
controlling how long mRNA lasts. Key aspects of the poly-A tail include:
 Tail length: The longer the tail, the more rounds of translation an mRNA
can support. If a gene needs to be shut off rapidly, the poly-A tail is usu-
ally pretty short, allowing the RNA-eating enzymes to polish off the
mRNA rapidly. With a short tail, when transcription comes to a halt, all
the mRNA in the cytoplasm is quickly used up without replacement,
thus halting protein production, too.
 Untranslated sequences before the tail: Many mRNAs with very short
lives have sequences right before the poly-A tail that, even though they
aren’t translated, shorten the mRNA’s lifespan.
155
Chapter 10: What a Cute Pair of Genes: Gene Expression

Hormones present in the cell may also affect how quickly mRNAs disappear.
In any event, the variation in mRNA expiration dates is enormous. Some
mRNAs last a few minutes, meaning those genes are tightly regulated;
other mRNAs hang around for months at a time.
Gene Control Lost in Translation
Translation of mRNA into amino acids is a critical step in gene expression.
(Flip back to Chapter 9 for a review of the players and process of translation.)
But sometimes genes are regulated during or even after translation.
Modifying where translation occurs
One way gene regulation is enforced is by hemming mRNAs up in certain
parts of the cytoplasm. That way, proteins produced by translation are found
only in certain parts of the cell, limiting their utility. Embryos use this strat-
egy to direct their own development. Proteins are produced on different
sides of the egg to create the front and back, so to speak, of the embryo.
Modifying when translation occurs
Just because an mRNA gets to the cytoplasm doesn’t mean it automatically
gets translated. Some gene expression is limited by certain conditions that
block translation from occurring. For example, an unfertilized egg contains
lots of mRNAs supplied by the female. Translation actually occurs in the
unfertilized egg, but it’s slow and selective. All that changes when a sperm
comes along and fertilizes the egg: Preexisting mRNAs are slurped up by
waiting ribosomes, which are signaled by the process of fertilization. New
proteins are then rapidly produced from the maternal mRNAs.
Controlling gene expression by controlling translation occurs in one of
two ways:
 The machinery that carries out translation, such as the initiator proteins
that interact with ribosomes, is modified to increase or decrease how
effectively translation occurs.
 mRNA carries a message that controls when and how it gets translated.
All mRNAs carry short sequences on their 5’ ends that aren’t translated, and
these sequences can carry messages about the timing of translation. The
untranslated sequences are recognized with the help of translation initiation
factors that help assemble the ribosome at the start codon of the mRNA.
156
Part II: DNA: The Genetic Material 

Some cells produce mRNAs but delay translation until certain conditions are
met. Some cells respond to levels of chemicals that the cell’s exposed to. For
example, the protein that binds to iron in the blood is created by translation
only when iron is available, even though the mRNAs are being produced all
the time. In other cases, the condition of the organism sends the message
that controls the timing of translation. For example, insulin, the hormone that
regulates blood sugar levels, controls translation, but when insulin’s absent,
the translation factors lock up the needed mRNAs and block translation from
occurring. When insulin arrives on the scene, the translation factors release
the mRNAs, and translation rolls on, unimpeded.
Modifying the protein shape
The proteins produced by translation are the ultimate form of gene expres-
sion. Protein function and thus gene expression can be modified in two ways:
by changing the protein’s shape or by adding components to the protein. The
products of translation, the amino acid chains, can be folded in various ways
to affect their functions (see Chapter 9 for how amino acid chains are folded).
Various components — carbohydrate chains, phosphates, and metals such as
iron — can be added to the chain, also changing its function. Occasionally,
the folding of proteins can go horribly wrong; for an explanation of one of the
scariest products of this type of error, mad cow disease, check out the side-
bar “Proteins gone wrong.”
157
Chapter 10: What a Cute Pair of Genes: Gene Expression
Proteins gone wrong
Cruetzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a frightening
disorder of the brain. Sufferers first experience
memory loss and anxiety and ultimately develop
tremors and lose intellectual function. CJD is the
human form of what’s popularly known as mad
cow disease.The pathogen isn’t a bacteria, virus,
or parasite — it’s an infectious protein called a
prion.One of the scariest aspects of prions is that
they seem to be able to replicate on their own by
hijacking normal proteins and refolding them.
The gene that codes for the prion protein is
found in many different organisms, including
humans. Once mutated (and what the unmu-
tated version does isn’t really clear), the protein
produced by the gene folds into an unusual, flat-
tened sheet. After one prion protein is acquired,
that prion can hijack the normal products of
unmutated prion genes, turning them into mis-
folded monsters, too. Prion proteins gum up the
brain of the affected organism and eventually
have fatal results. As if this outcome weren’t
frightening enough, it seems that prions can
jump from one species to another.
Scientists are fairly certain that some of the
cows originally infected by mad cow disease
contracted it by eating feed contaminated by
sheep meat. The deceased sheep were infected
with a prion that causes yet another icky dis-
ease called scrapie, which destroys the brains
of infected animals. Scientists believe that
when humans consume beef products from
cows affected by mad cow disease, the prions
in the meat can migrate through the human
body and continue doing their dirty work.

magine owning a library of 25,000 books. And I don’t mean just any books;
this collection contains unimaginable knowledge: solutions to diseases
that have plagued humankind for centuries, basic building instructions for
just about every creature on earth, even the explanation of how thoughts
are formed inside your brain. There’s just one problem with this fabulous
library — it’s written in a mysterious language, a code made up of only four
letters that are repeated in arcane patterns. The very secrets of life on earth
have been contained within this library since the dawn of time, but no one
could read the books — until now.
The 25,000 books are the genes that carry the information that make you. The
library storing these books is the human genome. Sequencing genomes (that is,
all the DNA in one set of chromosomes of an organism), both our own and
those of other organisms, means learning the order of the four bases (C, G, A,
and T) that make up DNA. The order of the bases in DNA is incredibly impor-
tant because it’s the key to DNA’s language. Learning the language is the first
step in reading the books of the library. Most of your genes are identical to
those in other species, so sequencing the DNA of other organisms, such as fruit
flies, roundworms, chickens, and even yeast, supplies scientists with a lot of
information about the human genome and how human genes function.
Trying on a Few Genomes
Humans are incredibly complex organisms. At least, we like to think so. But
when it comes to genetics, we’re not at the top of the heap. Many complex
organisms have vastly larger genomes than we do. Genomes are usually mea-
sured in number of base pairs they contain; flip back to Chapter 6 for more

about how DNA is put together in base pairs. Table 11-1 lists the genome sizes
and estimated number of genes for various organisms (for some genomes, like
grasshoppers, the numbers of genes are still unknown). Human genome size
runs a distant fourth behind lowly amoebas, salamanders, and grasshoppers.
It’s humbling, but true — a single-celled amoeba has a gigantic genome of over
675 billion base pairs. If genome size and complexity were related, which they
obviously aren’t, you’d expect the amoeba to have a small genome compared
to other “more complex” organisms. On the flip side, it doesn’t take a lot of
DNA to have a big impact on the world. For example, the HIV virus, which
causes AIDS, is a mere 9,700 bases long and is responsible for the deaths of
roughly 20 million people worldwide. With only nine genes, HIV isn’t very
complex, but it’s still very dangerous.
Even organisms that are very similar have vastly different genome sizes. Fruit
flies have roughly 180 million base pairs of DNA. Compare that to the grasshop-
per genome, which weighs in at a whopping 180 billion base pairs. But fruit flies
and grasshoppers aren’t that different. So if it isn’t organism complexity, what
causes the differences in genome size observed among organisms?

Part of what accounts for the variation in genome size from one organism to
the next is number of chromosomes. Particularly in plants, the number of
chromosome sets (called ploidy; see Chapter 15) explains why some plant
species have very large genome sizes. For example, wheat is hexaploid (six
copies of each chromosome) and has a gigantic genome of 16 billion base
pairs. Rice, on the other hand, is diploid (two copies of each chromosome)
and has a mere 430 million base pairs.
Chromosome number doesn’t tell the whole story, however. The number
of genes found within a genome doesn’t reveal how big the genome will be.
Arguably, mice are somewhat more complex than corn, but they have 29,000
fewer genes! On top of that, the corn genome and mouse genome are roughly
equal in size. Another example is that humans and the mustard weed both
have about 25,000 genes. Yet the mustard weed genome is roughly half the
size of the human genome (see Table 11-1 for more exact numbers). What
the human genome has that the mustard weed genome may lack is lots of
repetition.
DNA sequences fall into two major categories:
 Unique sequences found in genes (genes are covered in Chapter 9)
 Repetitive sequences that make up non-coding DNA
The presence of repetitive sequences of DNA in some organisms seems to
best explain genome size — that is, large genomes have many repeated
sequences that smaller genomes lack. Repetitive sequences vary from 150 to
300 base pairs in length and are repeated thousands and thousands of times.
These big chunks of sequences don’t code for proteins, though. Because all
this repetitive DNA doesn’t seem to do anything, it’s been dubbed junk DNA.
Junk DNA has suffered a bum rap. For years, it was touted as a genetic loser,
just along for the ride, doing nothing except getting passed on from one gener-
ation to the next. But no more. At long last, junk DNA is getting proper respect.
Scientists realized quite some time ago that a lot of junk DNA gets transcribed
into RNA (see Chapter 8 for the transcription process). But after being tran-
scribed, this non-coding “junk” didn’t appear to be translated into protein (see
Chapter 9 for the translation process). New evidence suggests that junk DNA
actually carries out important functions that regulate how organisms are put
together. This explanation is based on the fact that as embryo development
gets more and more involved (comparing roundworms to humans, for exam-
ple), organisms have more and more noncoding, repetitive DNA. It remains to
be seen if organisms with gigantic genomes (like the amoeba) are made up of
vast amounts of noncoding DNA. The jury’s still out, but it’s likely that junk
DNA does much more than simply take up space in the genome.
163
Chapter 11: Sequencing Your DNA

Sequencing Your Way to
the Human Genome
One of the ways scientists figure out what functions various kinds of sequences
carry out is by comparing genomes of different organisms. To make these com-
parisons, the projects described in this section use the methods explained in
the section “Reading the Language of DNA” later in this chapter. The results of
these comparisons tell us a lot about ourselves and the world around us.
The DNA of all organisms holds a vast amount of information. Amazingly, most
cell functions work the same regardless of which animal the cell comes from.
Yeast, elephants, and you all replicate DNA in the same way using almost iden-
tical genes. Because nature uses the same genetic machinery over and over,
learning about the DNA sequences in other organisms tells us a lot about the
human genome (and it’s far easier to experiment with yeast and roundworms
than with humans). Table 11-2 is a timeline of the major milestones of DNA
sequencing projects so far. In this section, you find out about several of these
projects, including the granddaddy of them all, the Human Genome Project.

The yeast genome
Brewer’s Yeast (scientific name Saccharomyces cerevisiae) was the first
eukaryotic genome to be fully sequenced. (Eukaryotes have cells with
nuclei; see Chapter 2.) Yeast has an established track record as one of the
most useful organisms known to humankind. It’s responsible for making
bread rise and for the fermentation that results in beer and wine. Not only
is yeast popular for providing food and drink, it’s a favorite organism for
genetic study. Much of what we know about the eukaryotic cell cycle (see
Chapter 2) came from yeast research. Yeast has provided information about
how genes are inherited together (called linkage; see Chapter 4) and how
genes are turned on and off (see Chapter 10). Because many human genes
have yeast counterparts, yeast is extremely valuable for learning about how
our own genes work.
Yeast has roughly 6,000 genes and 16 chromosomes. Altogether, about 70 per-
cent of the yeast genome consists of actual genes. Yeast genes work in neigh-
borhoods to carry out their functions; genes that are physically close
together on chromosomes are more likely to work together than those that
are far apart. The discovery of gene networks in yeast may help researchers
better understand how complex diseases such as Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and
lupus are caused in humans. Disorders such as these aren’t inherited in
simple Mendelian fashion (see Chapter 3) and are likely to be controlled by
many genes working together.
The sequencing of the yeast genome was quite a feat. Over 600 researchers in
100 laboratories across the world participated in the project. The technology
used at the time was much slower than what’s available to researchers now
(see the sidebar “Making the Human Genome Project possible: Automated
DNA sequencing” for details). Despite the technological disadvantage, the
sequence produced by this phenomenal team of scientists was extremely
accurate — especially when compared to the human genome (see “The
Human Genome Project” section later in this chapter).
165
Chapter 11: Sequencing Your DNA

The elegant roundworm genome
The genome of the lowly roundworm, more properly referred to by its full
name Caenorhabditis elegans, was the first genome of a multicellular organ-
ism to be fully sequenced. Weighing in at roughly 97 million base pairs, the
roundworm boasts nearly 20,000 genes — only 5,000 fewer than the human
genome — on just six chromosomes. Like our own genome, roundworms
have lots of junk DNA; only 25 percent of the roundworm genome is made
up of genes.
Roundworms are a fabulous study species because they reproduce sexually
and have organ systems, such as digestive and nervous systems, similar to
those in much more complex organisms. Additionally, roundworms have a
sense of taste, can detect odors, and react to light and temperature, so they’re
ideal for studying all sorts of processes, including behavior. Full-grown round-
worms have exactly 959 cells and are transparent, so figuring out how their
cells work was relatively easy. Scientists determined the exact function of each
of the 959 roundworm cells! Although these microscopic organisms live in soil,
roundworms have contributed to our understanding of many human diseases.
One of the ways to learn what a gene does is to stop it from functioning and
observe the effect. In 2003, a group of researchers fed roundworms a particular
kind of RNA that causes gene function to be temporarily put on hold (see
Chapter 10 for how this effect on gene function works). By briefly turning genes
off, the scientists were able to determine the functions of roughly 16,000 of the
roundworms’ genes. Another study using the same technique identified how
fat storage and obesity are controlled in roundworms. Given that an amazing
70 percent of proteins produced by humans have roundworm counterparts,
these gene function studies have obvious implications for human medicine.
The chicken genome
Chickens don’t get enough respect. The study of chicken biology has revealed
much about how organisms develop from embryos to adults. For example, the
study of human limb formation was greatly enhanced by the study of how a
chicken’s wings and legs are formed in the egg. Chickens have contributed to
our understanding of diseases such muscular dystrophy and epilepsy, and
chicken eggs are the principle ingredient used to produce vaccinations to fight
human disease epidemics. So when the chicken genome was sequenced in
2004, there should have been a lot of crowing about the underappreciated
chicken.
The chicken genome is really different from mouse and human genomes. It’s
much smaller (about a third as big as the human genome), with fewer chro-
mosomes (39 compared to our 46) and slightly fewer genes (23,000 or so).
Roughly 60 percent of chicken genes have human counterparts. Unlike
166
Part III: Genetics and Your Health 

mammals, some chicken chromosomes are tiny (only about 5 million base
pairs). These micro-chromosomes are unique because they have a very high
content of guanine and cytosine (see Chapter 6 for more about the bases that
make up DNA) and very few repetitive sequences.
Not surprisingly, chickens have lots of genes that code for keratin — the stuff
that makes their feathers (and your hair). The big surprise accompanying the
completed chicken genome was that chickens have lots of genes for sense of
smell. Until recently, scientists thought that most birds have a really poor
sense of smell. Now, they realize that sense of taste is what birds lack. The
chicken genome also revealed that a particular gene previously known only
to exist humans is also present in chickens. This gene, called interleukin 26,
is important in immune responses and may allow researchers to better
understand how to fight disease. One disease they’re particularly interested
in is avian flu, the bugs of which are often deadly to humans but don’t make
birds sick. Ultimately, comparing the chicken and human genomes may allow
scientists to understand how and why diseases like the “bird flu” move so
easily between humans and chickens.
The Human Genome Project
In 2001, the triumphant publication of the human genome sequence was her-
alded as one of the great feats of modern science. The sequence was consid-
ered a draft, and indeed, it was a really rough draft. The 2001 sequence was
woefully incomplete (it represented only about 60 percent of the total human
genome) and was full of errors that limited its utility. The first draft was filled
with gaps (numbering in the thousands) and many of the sequences were
misassembled, making accurate interpretation of the sequences impossible.
In 2004, the project neared completion. As of this writing, the errors have
been corrected for the most part, and the sequence now covers almost the
entire genome.
The Human Genome Project (HGP) is akin to some of the greatest adventures
of all time — it’s not unlike putting a person on the moon. However, unlike
the great technological achievements of space exploration which cost tens of
billions of dollars and require technology that becomes obsolete or wears
out, the HGP carries a mere $3 billion price tag and has unlimited utility.
When first proposed in 1985, the HGP was considered completely impossible.
At that time, sequencing technology was slow, requiring several days to gen-
erate only a few hundred base pairs of data (see the sidebar “Making the
Human Genome Project possible: Automated DNA sequencing” to find out
how this process was sped up). James Watson, one of the discoverers of the
structure of DNA way back in the 1950s (see Chapter 6), was one of the first
to push the project (in 1988) from idea to reality during his tenure as director
of the National Institutes of Health. When the project got off the ground in
1990, a global team of scientists from 20 institutions participated. (The 2001
human genome sequence paper had a staggering 273 authors.)
167
Chapter 11: Sequencing Your DNA

The enormous benefits of the HGP are underappreciated. Most genetic appli-
cations would not exist without the HGP. Here are just a few:
 Diagnosis and treatment of genetic disorders (which I cover in
Chapter 12)
 Development of drugs and gene therapy (see Chapter 16)
 Identification of bacteria and viruses to allow for targeted treatment of dis-
ease. Some antibiotics, for example, target some strains of bacteria better
than others. Genetic identification of bacteria is quick and inexpensive,
allowing physicians to rapidly identify and prescribe the right antibiotic.
 Forensics applications, such as identification of criminals and determi-
nation of identity after mass disasters (flip to Chapter 18)
 Understanding of the causes of cancer (which I cover in Chapter 14)
 Knowledge of which genes control what functions and how those genes
are turned on and off (see Chapter 10)
 Development of bioinformatics, an entirely new field focused on advanc-
ing technological capability to generate genetic data, catalog results,
and compare genomes (flip to Chapter 23 for more)
 Generation of thousands of jobs and economic benefits of over $25 bil-
lion in 2001 alone
Listing and explaining all the HGP’s discoveries would fill this book and then
some. As you can see in Table 11-2, all other genome projects — mouse, fruit
fly, yeast, roundworm, mustard weed, and so on — were started as a result of
the HGP.
As the HGP has progressed, the gene count in the human genome has
steadily declined. Originally, researchers thought that humans had as many
as 100,000 genes. But as new and more accurate information becomes avail-
able over the years, they’ve determined that the human genome has only
about 25,000 genes. Genes are often relatively small base pair–wise (roughly
3,000 base pairs), meaning that less than 2 percent of your DNA actually
codes for some protein. The number of genes on different chromosomes
varies enormously from nearly 3,000 genes on chromosome 1 (the largest) to
231 genes on the Y-chromosome (the smallest).
One of the newest discoveries of the HGP is that the human genome is still
“growing.” Genes get duplicated and then gain new functions, a process that
has produced as many as 1,100 new genes. Likewise, genes lose function and
“die.” Thanks to this death process, 37 genes in the human genome that
were once functional now exist as “pseudogenes,” which have the sequence
structure of normal genes but no longer code for proteins (see Chapter 10 for
more about genes). The Human Genome Project has revealed the surprisingly
dynamic and still changing nature of the human genome.
168
Part III: Genetics and Your Health 

Of the human genes that have been identified, only about half are understood
well enough to know what they do. Comparisons with genomes of other
organisms help identify what genes do because most of the proteins pro-
duced by human genes have counterparts in other organisms. Thus, humans
share many genes in common with even the simplest organisms, such as bac-
teria and worms. Over 99 percent of your DNA is identical to that of any other
human on earth, and as much as 98 percent of your DNA is identical to the
sequences found in the mouse genome. Perhaps the greatest take-home mes-
sage of the HGP is how alike all life on earth really is.
Sequencing: Reading the 
Language of DNA
The chemical nature of DNA (which I cover in Chapter 6) and the replication
process (which you can discover in Chapter 7) are essential to DNA sequenc-
ing. DNA sequencing also makes use of a reaction that’s similar to the poly-
merase chain reaction (PCR) used in forensics; if you want more details about
PCR, check out Chapter 18.
Identifying the players in DNA sequencing
The ingredients for DNA sequencing are:
 DNA: From a single individual of the organism to be sequenced.
 Primers: Several thousand copies of short sequences of DNA that are
complementary to the part of the DNA to be sequenced. (Primers require
knowledge of part of the DNA sequence before starting; see the sidebar
“Making the Human Genome Project possible: Shotgun sequencing” for
how researchers know which primers to use and where they get them.)
 dNTPs: Many As, Gs, Cs and Ts, put together with sugars and phos-
phates as nucleotides, the normal building blocks of DNA.
 ddNTPs: Many As, Gs, Cs, and Ts as nucleotides that each lack an
oxygen atom at the 3’ spot.
 Taq polymerase: The enzyme that puts the DNA molecule together (see
Chapter 18 for more details on Taq).
The use of ddNTPs is the whole key to how sequencing works. Take a care-
ful look at Figure 11-1. On the left is a generic dNTP, the basic building
block of DNA used during replication (if you don’t remember all the details,
169
Chapter 11: Sequencing Your DNA

flip back to Chapter 6 for more on dNTPs). The molecule on the right is ddNTP
(di-deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate). The ddNTP is identical to the dNTP in
every way except that it has no oxygen atom at the 3’ spot. No oxygen means
no reaction because the phosphate group of the next nucleotide can’t form a
phosphodiester bond (see Chapter 6) without that extra oxygen atom to aid
the reaction. The next nucleotide can’t hook up to ddNTP at the end of the
chain, and the replication process stops. So how does stopping the reaction
help the sequencing process? The idea is to create short pieces of DNA that
give the identity of each and every base along the sequence.
Breaking down the sequencing process
Here’s how the process of sequencing works.
1. A mixture of the ingredients listed above is heated, melting the hydrogen
bonds between the complementary bases of the template DNA. In
essence, the DNA is “unzipped” into two template strands (technically,
this unzipping is called denaturing). Step 1 of Figure 11-2 shows the
denaturing process of the template DNA and its bases at this stage. Heat
doesn’t harm the phosphodiester bonds between the bases or damage
the strands, so the template strands stay intact but unpaired throughout
the sequencing process, and their information content isn’t lost.
2. The mixture is cooled just enough to let the primers find their comple-
ments, as you can see in Figure 11-2. Taq polymerase finds the end of
the primer and starts adding dNTPs complementary to the template
strand going in the 3’ direction (see Chapter 7 on replication for how DNA
polymerases work and why the reaction proceeds in the 5’ ( 3’ direction).

As part of being incorporated into the strand, the dNTPs lose two 
phosphates, so technically, they’re no longer dNTPs; instead,
they’re nucleotides (see Chapter 7). But to avoid confusing the differ-
ent nucleotides — those that have reactive groups (dNTPs) and those
that don’t (ddNTPs) — I’ll continue calling them dNTPs and ddNTPs,
even though you now know that’s not quite right.

Chapter 11: Sequencing Your DNA

3. Taq polymerase keeps adding dNTPs until, by random chance, a ddNTP
is added. Taq polymerase can’t add a dNTP (or another ddNTP for that
matter) to the 3’ end of a ddNTP because of the missing oxygen mole-
cule. Therefore, what’s left is a fragment of DNA (that is, the chain that’s
been building) that ends with a ddNTP. Each of the four ddNTPs carries
a different colored dye, so the base — A, G, C, or T — that ends the reac-
tion can be identified later.
4. The mixture is heated and cooled again and again. Thus, the reaction —
melting (resulting in single-stranded templates), primers attaching, Taq
polymerase adding dNTPs until a ddNTP stops the reaction — repeats.
After 30 or 40 cycles, every single base along the entire template strand
is represented by a complementary ddNTP that ends a fragment of DNA.
The end result of a typical sequencing reaction is 1,000 fragments representing
1,000 bases of the template strand. The shortest fragment is made up of a
primer and one ddNTP representing the complement of the first base of the
template. The next shortest fragment is made up of the primer, one nucleotide
(from a dNTP), and a ddNTP — and so on (see Figure 11-2 for how the frag-
ments stack up by size), with the largest fragment being 1,000 bases long.
Finding the message in sequencing results
In order to see the results of the sequencing reaction, the DNA fragments
must be put through a process called electrophoresis. Electrophoresis is the
movement of charged particles (in this case, DNA) under the influence of
electricity. The purpose of electrophoresis is to sort the fragments of DNA by
size, from smallest to largest. The smallest fragment gives the first base in the
sequence, the second smallest fragment gives the second base, and so on
until the largest fragment gives the last base in the sequence. This arrange-
ment of fragments allows the sequence to be read in its proper order.
To carry out electrophoresis, DNA needs a medium to move through. A jelly-
like substance called a gel is used for this purpose; the gel is made of poly-
acrylamide, the same stuff used to make soft contact lenses. When electricity
is involved, opposites attract; so when exposed to two electrical poles, DNA,
which carries a negative charge, is attracted to the positive pole (this is the
electrophoresis part). The gel has pores in it (like the pores in your skin) that
the DNA can wiggle through. As the DNA fragments worm their way through
the gel, they generate friction, which creates resistance (like when you’re
pulling a couch over a carpeted floor). Small DNA fragments create less fric-
tion than large fragments, so the smaller fragments move the fastest.
A computer-driven machine called a sequencer uses a laser to “see” the col-
ored dyes of the ddNTPs at the end of each fragment (see the sidebar
“Making the Human Genome Project possible: Automated DNA sequencing”
for the inner workings of a sequencer). The laser shines into the gel and
“reads” the color of each fragment as it passes by. Fragments pass the laser
172
Part III: Genetics and Your Health 

in size order, from smallest to largest. Each dye color signals a different letter:
As show up green, Ts are red, Cs are blue, and Gs are yellow; the computer
automatically translates the colors into letters and stores all the information
for later analysis. The resulting picture is a series of peaks, like you see in
Figure 11-3. Each peak represents a different base. The sequence indicated by
the peaks is the complement of the template strand (see Chapter 6 for more
on the complementary nature of DNA). When you know the complement of
the template, you know the template sequence itself. This information can
then be mined for the location of genes (see Chapter 9) and compared to the
sequences of other organisms, such as those listed in Table 11-1.

Making the Human Genome Project possible:
Shotgun sequencing
“Shotgun sequencing” may sound like a
Hollywood western, but it’s really not. It’s the
method researchers use to gather massive
amounts of genetic data and put it together in the
correct order. Shotgun sequencing is what
allowed the Human Genome Project to be com-
pleted so quickly. Bacterial DNA was one of the
first DNA to be sequenced, so in shotgun
sequencing, scientists use knowledge of bacte-
rial DNA to modify the bacterial chromosome.
This modification allows them to slip in a chunk
of DNA from another species. DNA from the
organism to be sequenced, such as a human, is
chopped into pieces using special enzymes
(called restriction enzymes; see Chapter 22); then
researchers take the DNA fragments and pop
them into the bacterial chromosomes. Using
primers based on the already sequenced bacte-
rial DNA, researchers can then sequence the
inserted DNA. Powerful software programs com-
pare all the sequences and look for identical
sequences that signal a spot where two chunks
of DNA fit together. These overlapping pieces are
like the different shapes of a jigsaw puzzle, and
the computer matches them together to create
the larger picture. But because some parts of
DNA are repetitive, it’s difficult to piece the repet-
itive parts together. This difficulty is why the HGP
was hard to finish and explains why the first draft
had so many errors.

174
Part III: Genetics and Your Health 
Making the Human Genome Project possible:
Automated DNA sequencing
The human genome has about 3 billion base
pairs, and one round of sequencing identifies
the order of only 1,000 bases. Prior to the Human
Genome Project, sequencing was a very diffi-
cult and time-consuming enterprise. Getting a
1,000-base long sequence required about three
days of work and used radioactive chemicals
instead of dyes. Sequences were read by hand
and had to be run over and over again to fill in
gaps and correct mistakes. Every single
sequence had to be entered into the computer
by hand — imagine typing thousands of As, Gs,
Ts, and Cs! It would have taken centuries to
sequence the human genome using the old
methods. The sheer magnitude of Human
Genome Project required faster and easier
techniques.
Numerous companies, government labs, and
universities searched for solutions to make
sequencing faster, better, and cheaper. The end
result was automated sequencing. The gel nec-
essary for electrophoresis is contained inside a
very thin tube (about the size of a wooden pencil
lead) called a capillary. Each capillary is about
two feet long, and there are usually 96 capillar-
ies per sequencing machine. The fragments
from the sequencing reaction are sucked into
one end of the capillary, and electricity is
applied. The DNA fragments start moving
through the gel in the capillary tube and sort
themselves out, shortest to longest. A laser sits
at the far end of the gel and reads the color of
each fragment as it passes by. Generally, one
automated sequencer machine can produce
1,500 sequences (of 1,000 base pairs each) in
about 24 hours. Many laboratories worked
together using automated sequencers running
24 hours a day to power through the entire
human genome. That’s why it only took around
15 years to complete the HGP!

I
f you’re thinking of starting a family or adding to your brood, you may be
wondering what your little ones will look like. Will they get your eyes or
your dad’s hairline? But, if you know your family’s medical history, you may
also have significant worries about diseases such as cystic fibrosis, Tay-Sachs,
or sickle cell anemia. You may worry about your own health, too, as you con-
template news stories dealing with cancer, heart disease, and diabetes, for
example. All these concerns revolve around genetics and the inheritance of
predisposition for a particular disease or inheritance of the disorder itself.
Genetic counselors are specially and rigorously trained to help people learn
about the genetic aspects of their family medical histories. This chapter
explains the process of genetic counseling, including how counselors gener-
ate family trees and estimate probability of inheritance and how genetic test-
ing is done when genetic disorders are anticipated.
Getting to Know Genetic Counselors
Like it or not, you have a family. You have a mother and a father, grandpar-
ents, perhaps children of your own. You may not think of them, but you also
have hundreds of ancestors — people you’ve never met — whose genes you
carry and may pass down to descendants in the centuries to come.
Genetic counselors help people like you and me examine our families’ genetic
histories and uncover inherited conditions. Genetic counselors usually hold
a master’s degree in genetic counseling. They aren’t trained as geneticists;
instead, they have an extensive background in Mendelian genetics (and can
solve genetics problems in a snap; see Chapters 3 through 5 for some exam-
ples) so that they can spot patterns that signal an inherited disorder. Genetic

counselors work with medical personnel like physicians and nurses to inter-
pret medical histories of patients and their families. (For more on genetic
counselors and other career paths in genetics, see Chapter 1.)
Genetics counselors perform a number of functions, including:
 Constructing and interpreting family trees, sometimes called pedigrees,
to assess the likelihood that various inherited conditions will be (or
have been) passed on to a particular generation.
 Counseling families about options for diagnosis and treatment of genetic
conditions.
Physicians most commonly refer the following types of people or patients to
genetic counselors:
 Women over 35 years of age who are pregnant or are planning a
pregnancy
 People with a family history of a particular disorder, such as cystic
fibrosis, who are planning a family
 Parents of a newborn who shows symptoms of a genetic disorder
 Women who are experiencing complications during a pregnancy
 Couples who have experienced more than one miscarriage or stillbirth
 Couples who are concerned about exposure to substances known to
cause birth defects (such as radiation, viruses, drugs, and chemicals)
 People with a family history of inherited diseases like Parkinson’s disease
or certain cancers such as breast, ovarian, or prostate cancer who may be
considering genetic testing to determine their risk of getting the disease
Many of the scientific reasons for the inheritance of genetic disorders are
covered elsewhere in this book. Mutations within genes are the root cause of
many genetic disorders (including cystic fibrosis, Tay-Sachs, and sickle cell
anemia), and I cover mutation in detail in Chapter 13. Cancer — its causes
and the genetic mechanics behind it — is covered in Chapter 14. Chromosomal
disorders such Down syndrome, trisomy 13, and Fragile X are explained in
Chapter 15. Finally, gene therapy treatments for inherited disorders are
explained in Chapter 16.
Building and Analyzing a Family Tree
The first step in genetic counseling is drawing a family tree. The tree usually
starts with the person for whom the tree is initiated; this person is called the
proband. The proband can be a newly diagnosed child, a woman planning a
176
Part III: Genetics and Your Health 

pregnancy, or an otherwise healthy person who’s curious about risk for
inherited disease. Often, the proband is simply the person who meets with
the genetic counselor and provides the information used to plot out the
family tree. The proband’s position in the family tree is always indicated by
an arrow, and he or she may or may not be affected by an inherited disorder.
A variety of symbols are used on family trees to indicate personal traits and
characteristics. For instance, certain symbols convey gender, gene carriers,
whether the person is deceased, and whether the person’s family history is
unknown. The manner in which symbols are connected show relationships
between people, such as which offspring belong to which parents, whether
someone is adopted, and whether someone is a twin. Check out Figure 12-1
for a detailed key to the symbols typically used in pedigree analysis.
In a typical pedigree, the age or date of birth of each person is noted on the
tree. If deceased, the person’s age at time of death and the cause of death are
listed. Some genetic traits are more common in certain regions of the world,
so it’s useful to include all kinds of other details about family history on the
pedigree, such as what countries people immigrated from. Every member of
the family should be listed along with any medical information known about
that person, including when medical disorders occurred. In the example
included as part of Figure 12-1, the grandfather of the proband died of a heart
attack at age 51. Including this information creates a record of all disorders
with the relation to the family tree so that the counselor is more likely to
detect every inherited disease present in the family. (Medical information
doesn’t appear in Figure 12-1, but it’s normally a part of a tree.)
Medical problems often listed on pedigrees include:
 Cancer
 Alcoholism or drug addiction
 Mental illness or mental retardation
 Heart disease, high blood pressure, or stroke
 Asthma
 Kidney disease
 Birth defects, miscarriages, or stillbirths
Human couples have only a few children relative to other creatures, and we
start producing offspring after a rather long childhood. Geneticists rarely
see neat offspring ratios (such as four siblings with three affected and one
unaffected) in humans that correspond to those observed in animals (take
a look at Chapters 3 and 4 for more on common offspring ratios). Therefore,
genetic counselors must look for very subtle signs to detect particular
patterns of inheritance in humans.
177
Chapter 12: Genetic Counseling

When the genetic counselor knows what kind of disorder or trait is involved,
he or she can determine the likelihood a particular person will possess the
trait or pass it on to his or her children. (Sometimes, the disorder is unidenti-
fied, such as when a person has a family history of “heart trouble” but doesn’t
have a precise diagnosis.) Genetic counselors use the following terms to
describe the individuals in a pedigree:
 Affected: Any person having a given disorder.
 Heterozygote: Any person possessing one copy of the gene coding for a
disorder (an allele; see Chapter 2 for details). An unaffected heterozygote
is called a carrier.
 Homozygote: Any person possessing two copies of the allele for a dis-
order. This person can also be described as homozygous.
The particular way in which most human genetic disorders are passed down
to later generations — the mode of inheritance — is well established. After a
genetic counselor determines which family members are affected or likely to
be carriers, it’s relatively easy for them to determine the probability of
another person being a carrier or inheriting the disorder.
In the following sections, I explore the modes of inheritance for human genetic
disorders, how genetic counselors map these modes, and how you (and your

counselor) can figure out the probability of passing these traits on to offspring.
For additional background on each of these modes of inheritance and the sub-
ject of inheritance in general, see Chapters 3 through 5.
Autosomal dominant traits
A dominant trait or disorder is one that’s expressed (or manifested) in anyone
who inherits the gene for the trait. Autosomal dominant means that the gene
is carried on a chromosome other than a sex chromosome (meaning not on
an X or a Y; see Chapter 3 for more details). In human pedigrees, autosomal
dominant traits have some typical characteristics:
 Both males and females are affected with equal frequency.
 The trait doesn’t skip generations.
 Affected children are born to an affected parent.
 If neither parent is affected, usually no child is affected.
Figure 12-2 shows the pedigree of a family with an autosomal dominant trait. In
the figure, affected persons are shaded, and you can see clearly how only
affected parents have affected children. The trait can be passed to a child from
either the mother or the father. Generally, affected parents have a 50-percent
chance of passing an autosomal dominant trait or disorder on to their children.
Some common autosomal dominant disorders are:
 Achondroplasia, a form of dwarfism
 Polydactyly, extra fingers and toes
 Marfan, a disorder affecting connective tissue (tendons, ligaments, and
cartilage
 Huntington disease, a progressive and fatal disease affecting the brain
and nervous system

Chapter 12: Genetic Counseling

There are two exceptions to the normal pattern of autosomal dominant
inheritance:
 Reduced penetrance: Penetrance is the percentage of individuals having a
particular gene (genotype) that actually displays the physical characteris-
tics dictated by the gene (or express the gene as phenotype, scientifically
speaking; see Chapter 3 for a full rundown of genetics terms). Many auto-
somal dominant traits have complete penetrance, meaning that every
person inheriting the gene shows the trait. But some traits have reduced
penetrance, meaning only a certain percentage of individuals inheriting
the gene show the phenotype. When an autosomal dominant disorder
shows reduced penetrance, the phenotype skips generations. Check out
Chapter 3 for more details on reduced penetrance.
 New mutations: In the case of new mutations that are autosomal domi-
nant, the trait appears for the first time in a particular generation and
appears in every generation thereafter. You can flip ahead to Chapter 13
to learn more details about mutations — how they occur and how they
are passed on.
Autosomal recessive traits
Recessive disorders are expressed only when an individual inherits two identi-
cal copies of the gene causing the disorder. It’s then said that the individual is
homozygous for the gene causing the disorder (see Chapter 3 for more details
on inheritance). Like autosomal dominant disorders, autosomal recessive dis-
orders are coded in genes found on chromosomes other than sex chromo-
somes. In pedigrees, such as the one pictured in Figure 12-3, autosomal
recessive disorders have the following characteristics:
 Males and females are affected equally.
 The disorder or trait skips one or more generations.
 Affected children are born to unaffected parents.
 Children born to parents who share common ancestry (such as ethnic
or religious background) are more likely to be affected than those of par-
ents with different backgrounds.
The probability of inheriting an autosomal recessive disorder varies depend-
ing on which alleles parents carry (see Chapter 3 for all the details on how
the odds of inheritance are calculated):
 When both parents are carriers, every child born to the couple has a
25-percent chance of being affected.
 When one parent is a carrier and the other isn’t, every child has a 50
percent chance of being a carrier. No child will be affected.
180
Part III: Genetics and Your Health 

 When one parent is a carrier and the other is affected, each child has
a 50 percent change of being affected. All unaffected children from the
union will be carriers.
 When one parent is affected and the other is unaffected (and not a
carrier), all children born to the couple will be carriers. No children will
be affected.
Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disorder that causes severe lung
problems in affected persons. As with all autosomal recessive disorders,
if both members of a couple are carriers for cystic fibrosis, they have a
25 percent chance of producing at least one child that has the disease.
That’s because both the man and the woman are heterozygous for the
allele that codes for cystic fibrosis, and each has a 50 percent probability
of contributing the CF allele. The probability of both members of the couple
contributing CF alleles in one fertilization event is calculated by multiplying
the probability of each event happening independently. The probability
the father contributes his CF allele is 50 percent or 0.5; the probability the
mother contributes her CF allele is 50 percent or 0.5. The probability he con-
tributes his allele and she contributes her allele is 0.5 × 0.5 = 0.25 or 25 per-
cent. For more details on how probabilities of inheritance are calculated, flip
back to Chapters 3 and 4.
Some autosomal recessive disorders are more common among people of
certain religious or ethnic groups because people belonging to those groups
tend to marry within the group. After many generations, everyone within the
group shares common ancestry. When cousins or other close relatives marry,
such relationships are referred to as consanguineous (meaning “same blood”).
Generally, people who are more distantly related than fourth cousins aren’t

considered “related,” but in fact, those persons still share alleles from a
common ancestor. When populations are founded by rather small groups of
people, those groups often have higher rates of particular genetic disorders
than the general population; for more details, take a look at the sidebar
“Genetic disorders in small populations.” In these cases, autosomal recessive
disorders may no longer skip generations because so many persons are het-
erozygous and thus carriers of the disorder.
X-linked recessive traits
Males are XY and therefore have only one copy of the X-chromosome; they
don’t have a second X to offset the expression of a mutant allele on the
affected X. Thus, similar to autosomal dominant disorders, X-linked recessive
disorders express the trait fully in males, even though not homozygous.
Females rarely show X-linked recessive disorders because being homozygous
for the disorder is very rare. In pedigrees, X-linked recessive disorders have
the following characteristics:
 Far more males than females are affected.
 The disorder skips one or more generations.
 Affected sons are born to unaffected mothers.
 The trait is never passed from father to son.
182

Genetic disorders in small populations
The Pennsylvania Amish don’t have electricity in
their homes, don’t drive cars, and don’t use e-mail
or cellphones. They live simply in the modern
world as a religious way of life. Because Amish
people marry within their faith, certain genetic
disorders are common. Amish families come by
horse and buggy to the Clinic for Special Children
in Strasburg, Pennsylvania, forgenetic testing. By
partnering with an ultra–high-tech company, the
clinic provides rapid, inexpensive genetic testing.
For example, the Old Order Amish of southeast-
ern Pennsylvania suffer from a devastating form
of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).
Altogether, the Bellville Amish Community has
mourned the loss of over 21 babies (one family
lost six infants to the disorder). Researchers at
the Translational Genomics Research Institute
in Phoenix, Arizona, were able to locate the
mutated gene that causes the SIDS using
microarray technology (see Chapter 23). Sadly,
no treatment yet exists for this type of SIDS, but
gene therapy (which I cover in Chapter 16) may
offer hope for small populations such as the
Amish.

Unaffected parents can have unaffected daughters and one or more affected
sons. Women who are carriers frequently have brothers with the disease, but
if families are small, a carrier may have no affected immediate family mem-
bers. Sons of affected fathers are never affected, but affected fathers’ daugh-
ters are always carriers because daughters must inherit one of their
X-chromosomes from their fathers. In this case, that X-chromosome will
always carry the allele for the disorder. The pedigree in Figure 12-4 is a clas-
sic example of a well-researched family possessing many carriers for the X-
linked disorder hemophilia, a devastating disorder that prevents normal
clotting of the blood. For more on the royal families whose history is pictured
in Figure 12-4, see the sidebar “A royal pain in the genes.”
The probability of inheritance of X-linked disorders depends on gender.
Female carriers have a 50 percent likelihood of passing the gene on to each
child. Males determine the gender of their offspring, making the chance of
any particular child being a boy is 50 percent. Therefore, the likelihood of a
carrier mom having an affected son is 25 percent (chance of having a son =
0.5; chance of a son inheriting the affected X = 0.5; therefore, 0.5 × 0.5 = 0.25
or 25 percent).

X-linked dominant traits
Like autosomal dominant disorders, X-linked dominant traits don’t skip gen-
erations. Every person inheriting the allele expresses the disorder. The family
tree pictured in Figure 12-5 shows many of the hallmarks of X-linked domi-
nant disorders:
 Both males and females are affected.
 The trait doesn’t skip generations.
 Affected mothers have both affected sons and daughters.
 All daughters of affected fathers are affected.
184
Part III: Genetics and Your Health 
A royal pain in the genes
One of the most famous examples of an X-linked
family pedigree is found in the royal families of
Europe and Russia, which you can see in Figure
12-4. Queen Victoria of England had one son
affected with hemophilia. It’s not clear who
Queen Victoria inherited the allele from; she
may have been the victim of spontaneous gene
mutation. In any event, two of her daughters
were carriers, and she had one affected son,
Leopold. Queen Victoria’s granddaughter
Alexandra was also a carrier. Alexandra mar-
ried Nicholas Romanov, who became Czar of
Russia, and together they had five children: four
daughters and one son. The son, Alexis, suf-
fered from hemophilia.
The role Alexis’s disease played in his family’s ulti-
mate fate is debatable. Clearly, however, one of
the men who influenced the downfall of Russia’s
royal family was linked to the family as Alexis’s
“doctor.” Gregory Rasputin was a self-pro-
claimed faith healer; in photographs, he appears
wild-eyed and deeply intense. He’s generally per-
ceived to have been a fraud, but at the time, he
had a reputation for miraculous healings, includ-
ing helping little Alexis recover from a bleeding
crisis. Despite Rasputin’s talent for healing, Alexis
didn’t live to see adulthood. Shortly after the
Russian Revolution broke out, the entire Russian
royal family was murdered. (Rasputin himself had
been murdered some two years earlier.)
In a bizarre final twist to the Romanov tale, a road
repair crew discovered the family’s bodies in
1979. Oddly, two of the family members were
missing. Eleven people were supposedly killed by
firing squad on the night of July 16, 1918: the
Russian royal family (Alexandra, Nicholas, and
their five children) along with three servants and
the family doctor. However, the bodies of Alexis
and his little sister, Anastasia, have never been
found. Using DNA fingerprinting, researchers
confirmed the identities of Alexandra and her
children by matching their mitochondrial DNA
to that of one of Queen Victoria’s living descen-
dants, Prince Philip of England. (To find out
more about the forensic uses of DNA, flip to
Chapter 18.)

X-linked dominant traits show up more often in females than males because
females can inherit an affected X from either parent. Affected females have a
50 percent chance of having an affected child of either sex. Males never pass
their affected X to sons; therefore, sons of affected fathers and unaffected
mothers have no chance of being affected in contrast to daughters, who are
always affected. The probability of an affected man having an affected child is
50 percent (that is, equal to the likelihood of having a daughter).
Y-linked traits
The Y-chromosome is passed strictly from father to son. By definition, Y-
chromosome traits are considered hemizygous, meaning there’s only one
copy of the chromosome, not two (see Chapter 5). Y-chromosome traits are
expressed as if they were dominant because there’s only one copy of the
allele per male with no other allele to offset the effect of the gene. Y-linked
traits are easy to recognize when seen in a pedigree, such as Figure 12-6,
because they have the following characteristics:
 Affected men pass the trait to all their sons.
 No women are ever effected.
 The trait doesn’t skip generations.
Because the Y-chromosome is tiny and has relatively few genes, Y-linked
traits are very rare. Most of the genes involved control male-only traits
such as sperm production and testis formation. If you’re female and your
dad has hairy ears, you can relax — hairy ears is also considered a Y-linked
trait.

Staying Ahead of the Game:
Genetic Testing
With the advent of many new technologies (many of which grew out of the
Human Genome Project, which I explain in Chapter 11), genetic testing is
easier and cheaper than ever. Genetic testing and genetic counseling often go
hand in hand. The genetic counselor works to identify which disorders occur
in the family, and testing then examines the DNA directly to determine if the
disorder-causing gene is present. Your physician may refer you or a family
member for genetic testing for a variety of reasons, particularly if you
 Are a healthy person with a family history of a recessive disorder, and
you’re thinking about having a child.
 Are a pregnant woman over 35 years of age.
 Are an affected person and need to confirm a diagnosis.
 Are a healthy person concerned about certain heritable disorders in
your family such as breast cancer or Huntington chorea.
 Have an infant who’s at risk (because his or her parents are known or
suspected carriers).
General testing
Every person the world over carries one or more alleles that cause genetic dis-
ease. Most of us never know which alleles or how many we carry. If you have a
family member who’s affected with a rare genetic disorder, particularly an auto-
somal dominant disorder with incomplete penetrance or delayed onset, you
may be vitally concerned about which allele(s) you carry. Persons currently

unaffected with certain disorders can seek genetic testing to learn if they’re
carriers. Most tests involve a blood sample, but some are done with a simple
cheek swab to capture a few skin cells.
Prenatal testing
Prenatal diagnosis is commonly used for unborn children of women over 35
years of age because such women are much more likely than younger women
to have children with chromosomal disorders (see Chapter 15). Prenatal test-
ing is designed to allow couples time to make decisions about treatments to be
administered either during pregnancy or after delivery of an affected infant.
Amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling
For definitive diagnosis of a genetic disorder, testing requires tissue of the
affected person. Two common prenatal tests used to obtain fetal tissue for
testing are chorionic villus sampling (CVS) and amniocentesis. Both tests
require ultrasound to accurately guide the instruments used to obtain the
samples (see the following section for more info on ultrasound).
 CVS is usually done late in the first trimester of pregnancy (weeks 8 to
12). A catheter is inserted vaginally and guided to the outer layer of the
placenta, called the chorion. Gentle suction is used to collect a small
sample of chorionic tissue. The placental tissue arises from the fetus, not
the mother, so the cells collected give an accurate picture of the fetus’s
chromosome number and genetic profile. The advantages of CVS are that
it can be done earlier than most other prenatal tests; it’s extremely accu-
rate; and because a relatively large sample is obtained, results are rapidly
produced. CVS is associated with a slightly higher rate of miscarriage,
however, and rarely, infants subjected to CVS have limb deformities.
 Amniocentesis is usually done early in the second trimester of pregnancy
(weeks 12 to 16). Amniocentesis is used to obtain a sample of the amni-
otic fluid that surrounds the growing fetus because amniotic fluid con-
tains fetal cells (skin cells that have sloughed off) that can be examined
for prenatal testing. The fluid is drawn directly from the uterus using a
needle inserted through the abdomen. Because fetal cells in the fluid are
at a very low concentration, the cells must be grown in a lab to provide
enough tissue for testing, making results slow to come (about one to two
weeks). When they’re obtained, however, results are accurate, and com-
plications following the procedure (such as miscarriage) are rare.
Ultrasound
Ultrasound technology allows physicians to visually examine a growing
fetus along with its spinal cord, brain, and all its organs. Ultrasound directs
extremely high frequency sound waves through the abdominal wall of the
187
Chapter 12: Genetic Counseling

mother. The sound waves bounce off the fetus and return to a receiver that
then converts the sound wave “picture” into a visual image. New ultrasound
technologies include powerful computers that put together a three-dimensional
image, giving amazingly crisp pictures of facial features and body parts.
Ultrasound is generally used to diagnose genetic disorders that are associ-
ated with physical features or deformities. However, some chromosomal dis-
orders, such as Down syndrome, may also be provisionally diagnosed using
ultrasound. Ultrasound can be used at any time during pregnancy and is com-
pletely non-invasive, with little or no risk to mother or baby.
Newborn screening
Some genetic disorders are highly treatable using dietary restrictions.
Therefore, all newborns in the United States are tested for two common,
highly treatable genetic disorders: phenylketonuria and galactosemia. Both of
these disorders are autosomal recessive.
 Phenylketonuria causes mental retardation due to the build up of
phenylalanine (an amino acid that’s part of a normal diet) in the brain
of affected persons. A diet low in phenylalanine allows such persons
to live symptom-free lives. (This disorder and the potential to control
it are the reasons certain diet colas contain warning labels regarding
phenylalanine content.) Phenylketonuria occurs once in every 10,000
to 20,000 births.
 Galactosemia is a disorder similar to phenylketonuria that results from
an inability to break down one of the products of lactose (milk sugar).
A lactose-free diet allows affected persons to live symptom-free lives. If
untreated, galactosemia results in brain damage, kidney and liver failure,
and often, death. Galactosemia occurs once in every 45,000 births.
Testing for these two disorders isn’t actually genetic testing; rather, the tests
are designed to look for the presence of abnormal amounts of either pheny-
lalanine or galactose — the phenotypes of the disorders.

espite what you may think, mutation is good thing. Mutation, which
is simply genetic change, is responsible for all phenotypic variation.
Variation in flower colors and plant height, the flavor of different varieties
of apples, the differences among dog breeds, you name it — the natural
process that created all those different phenotypes was mutation. Mutation
occurs all the time, spontaneously and pretty much randomly. But like many
good things, mutation can also be bad. It can disrupt normal gene activity
and cause disease such as cancer (flip to Chapter 14 for details) and birth
defects (see Chapter 15). In this chapter, you discover what causes mutations,
how DNA can repair itself in the face of mutation, and the consequences when
repair attempts fail.
Starting Off with Types of Mutations
Mutations fall into two major categories, and the distinction between the two
is important to keep in mind:
 Somatic mutations: Mutations in body cells that don’t make eggs or
sperm. Mutations that occur in the somatic cells aren’t heritable — that
is, the changes can’t be passed from parent to offspring — but they do
affect the person with the mutation.
 Germ-cell mutations: Mutations in the sex cells (germ cells like eggs and
sperm; see Chapter 2 for the scoop on cell types) that lead to embryo
formation. Unlike somatic mutations, germ-cell mutations often don’t
affect the parent. Instead, they affect the offspring of the person with the
mutation and are heritable from then on.

Some disorders have elements of both somatic and germ-cell (heritable) muta-
tions. Many cancers that run in families arise as a result of somatic mutations
in persons who are already susceptible to the disease because of mutations
inherited from one or both parents. (You can find out more about heritable
cancers in Chapter 14.)
Both somatic and germ-cell mutations usually come about, in a general sense,
because of
 Substitutions of one base for another: Substitutions are sometimes called
point mutations. Usually only one mistaken base is involved, although
sometimes both the base and its complement are changed (for a review
of the chemistry of DNA, turn back to Chapter 6). This type of mutation
breaks down further into two categories:
• Transition mutation: When a purine base is substituted for the
other purine or one pyrimidine is substituted for the other pyrimi-
dine. Transition mutations are the most common form of substitu-
tion errors.
• Transversion mutation: When a purine replaces a pyrimidine (or
vice versa).
 Insertions and deletions of one or more bases: When an extra base is
added to a strand, the error is called an insertion. Dropping a base is
considered a deletion. Insertions and deletions are the most common
forms of mutation.
When the change happens within a gene, both insertions and deletions
lead to a change in the way the genetic code is read during translation
(flip to Chapter 9 for a translation review). Translation involves reading
the genetic code in three-letter batches, so when one or two bases are
added or deleted, the reading frame is shifted. This frameshift mutation
results in a completely different interpretation of what the code says and
produces an entirely different amino acid strand. As you can imagine,
these effects have disastrous consequences because the expected gene
product isn’t produced. If three bases are added or deleted, the reading
frame isn’t affected. The result of a three-base insertion or deletion, called
an in-frame mutation, is that one amino acid is either added (insertion) or
lost (deletion). In-frame mutations can be just as bad as frameshift muta-
tions. The consequences of these sorts of mutations are covered in the
section “Facing the Consequences of Mutation” later in this chapter.
Uncovering Causes of Mutation
Mutations can occur for a whole suite of reasons. In general, though, the
causes of mutations are either random or due to exposure to outside agents
such as chemicals or radiation. In the sections that follow, I delve into each of
these causes.
190

Spontaneous mutations
Spontaneous mutation occurs randomly and without any urging from some
external cause. It’s a natural, normal occurrence. Because the vast majority
of your DNA doesn’t code for anything, most spontaneous mutation goes
unnoticed (check out Chapter 11 for more details about your noncoding
“junk” DNA). But when mutation occurs within a gene, the function of
the gene can be changed or disrupted. Those changes can then result in
unwanted side effects (such as cancer, which I address in Chapter 14).
Scientists are all about counting, sorting, and quantifying, and it’s no different
with mutations. Spontaneous mutations are measured in the following ways:
 Frequency: Mutations are sometimes measured by the frequency of
occurrence. Frequency is the number of times some event occurs within
a group of individuals. When you hear that one in some number of per-
sons has a particular disease-causing allele, the number being expressed
is a frequency. For example, the X-linked disease hemophilia is estimated
by one study to have a frequency of 13 cases for every 100,000 males.
 Rate: Another way of looking at mutations is in the framework of a rate,
like the number of mutations occurring per round of cell division or
mutations per gamete or per generation. Mutation rates appear to vary
a lot from organism to organism. Even within a species, mutation rates
vary depending upon the part of the genome being examined. Some
convincing studies show that mutation rate even varies by sex and that
mutation rates are higher in males than females (check out the sidebar
“Dad’s age matters, too” for more on this topic). Regardless of how it’s
viewed, spontaneous mutation occurs at a steady but very low rate (like
around one per million gametes).
Most spontaneous mutations occur as a result of mistakes made during repli-
cation (all the details of how DNA replicates itself are in Chapter 7). There are
three main sources of error during replication:
 Mismatched bases that are overlooked during proofreading
 Strand slipups that lead to deletions or insertions
 Spontaneous but natural chemical changes that cause bases to be mis-
read during replication, resulting in substitutions or deletions
Mismatches during replication
Usually, mistakes made during replication are caught and fixed by DNA poly-
merase. DNA polymerase has the job of reading the template, adding the
appropriate complementary base to the new strand, and then proofreading
the new base before moving to the next base on the template. DNA polymerase
can snip out erroneous bases and replace them, but occasionally, a wrong
191
Chapter 13: Mutation and Inherited Diseases

base escapes detection. Such an error is possible because non-complementary
bases can form hydrogen bonds through what’s called wobble pairing. As you
can see in Figure 13-1, wobble pairing can occur
 Between thymine and guanine without any modifications to either base
(because these non-complementary bases can sometimes form bonds in
odd spots).
 Between cytosine and adenine only when adenine acquires an addi-
tional hydrogen atom (called protonation).
If DNA repair crews don’t catch the error and fix it (see the section “Evaluating
Options for DNA Repair” in this chapter) and the mismatched base remains in
place, the mistake is perpetuated after the next round of replication, apparent
in Figure 13-2. The mistaken base is read as part of the template strand, and its
complement is added to the newly replicated strand opposite. Thus, the muta-
tion is permanently added to the structure of the DNA in question.

Strand slipups
Both strands of DNA are copied more or less at the same time during replica-
tion. Occasionally, a portion of one strand (either the template or the newly
synthesized strand) can form a loop in a process called strand slippage. In
Figure 13-3, you can see that strand slippage in the new strand results in an
insertion, and slippage in the template strand, results in a deletion.
Strand slippage is associated with repeating bases. When one base is repeated
more than five times in row (AAAAAA, for example) or when any number of
bases are repeated over and over (such as AGTAGTAGT), strand slippage
during replication is far more likely to occur. In some cases, the mistakes pro-
duce lots of variation in noncoding, junk DNA, and the variation’s useful for
determining individual identity; this is the basis for DNA fingerprinting (see
Chapter 18 for that discussion). When repeat sequences occur within genes,
the addition of new repeats leads to a stronger effect of the gene. This strength-
ening effect, called anticipation, occurs in genetic disorders such as Huntington
disease. (You can find out more about anticipation in Chapter 4.)
193
Chapter 13: Mutation and Inherited Diseases
Dad’s age matters, too
The relationship between maternal age and an
increased incidence of birth defects, particu-
larly Down syndrome, is very well known.
Nondisjunction events, or the failure of chro-
mosomes to separate normally during meiosis,
in developing eggs are thought to be a conse-
quence of aging in women. Very few similar
genetic problems appear to arise in men, who,
unlike women, produce new gametes (repro-
ductive cells), in the form of sperm, throughout
their lifetimes. However, older men are suscep-
tible to germ-cell mutations that can cause her-
itable disorders in their children.
The pattern of spontaneous mutation in germ
cells of older men was first noticed by a German
physician during the early part of the 20th century.
Wilhelm Weinberg is best known for his contri-
bution to population genetics, commemorated by
the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium equation (jump
to Chapter 17 for the scoop). Weinberg published
many papers on genetics, including the genetics
of achondroplasia, an autosomal dominant form
of dwarfism that’s typified by shortened limbs and
an enlarged head. Weinberg noticed that children
with achondroplasia were more common among
older fathers with no family history of the disor-
der than younger fathers with no family history.
Weinberg boldly stated that this contrast was due
to mutation. Forty years later, a geneticist con-
firmed the accuracy of Weinberg’s supposition.
The reason that older men are more suscepti-
ble to spontaneous germ-cell mutations is the
same reason they’re less likely to have nondis-
junctions — males produce sperm throughout
their lives. This continued sperm production
means that a 50-year-old man’s germ cells have
replicated over 800 times. As DNA ages, repli-
cation gets less accurate, and repair mecha-
nisms become faulty. Thus, older fathers have
an increased risk (although it’s still only slight)
of fathering children with genetic disorders.
Achondroplasia isn’t the only disorder associ-
ated with spontaneous mutation in aging men;
several other disorders, including Marfan (a
disorder of skeletal and muscle tissue that
causes heart problems) and progeteria (a dis-
ease that causes rapid aging in children) are
also associated with older fathers.

Another problem generated by repeated bases is unequal crossing-over.
During meiosis, homologous chromosomes are supposed to align exactly so
that exchanges of information are equal and don’t disrupt genes (turn to
Chapter 2 for meiosis review). Unequal crossing-over occurs when the
exchange between chromosomes results in uneven amounts of material being
swapped. Repeated sequences cause unequal crossovers because there are
so many similar bases that match. The identical bases can align in multiple,
matching ways that result in mismatches elsewhere along the chromosome.
Unequal crossover events lead to large-scale chromosome changes (like
those described in Chapter 15). Chromosomes in cells affected by cancer are
also vulnerable to crossing-over errors (see Chapter 14 for details).
Spontaneous chemical changes
DNA can undergo spontaneous changes in its chemistry that result in both
deletions and substitutions. DNA naturally loses purine bases at times in a
process called apurination. Most often, a purine’s lost when the bond
between adenine and the sugar, deoxyribose, is broken. (See Chapter 6 for a
reminder of what a nucleotide looks like.) When a purine is lost, replication
treats the spot occupied by the orphaned sugar as if it never contained a
base at all, resulting in a deletion.
Deamination is another chemical change that occurs naturally in DNA. It’s
what happens when an amino group (composed of a nitrogen atom and two
hydrogens, NH2) is lost from a base. Figure 13-4 shows the before and after
stages of deamination. When cytosine loses its amino group, it’s converted to
uracil. Uracil normally isn’t found in DNA at all because it’s a component of
RNA. If uracil appears in a DNA strand, replication replaces the uracil with a
thymine, creating a substitution error. Until it’s snipped out and replaced
during repair (see “Evaluating Options for DNA Repair” later in this chapter),
uracil acts as a template during replication and pairs with adenine.
Ultimately, what was a C-G pair transitions into an A-T pair instead.

Induced mutations
Induced mutations result from exposure to some outside agent such as chemi-
cals or radiation. It probably comes as no surprise to you to find out that
many chemicals can cause DNA to mutate. Carcinogens (chemicals that cause
cancers) aren’t uncommon; the chemicals in cigarette smoke are probably
the biggest offenders. In addition to chemicals that cause mutations, sources
of radiation, from X-rays to sunlight, are also mutagenic. A mutagen is any
factor that causes an increase in mutation rate. Mutagens may or may not
have phenotypic effects — it depends on what part of the DNA is affected.
The following sections cover two major categories of mutagens: chemicals
and radiation. Each causes different damage to DNA.
Chemical mutagens
The ability of chemicals to cause permanent changes in the DNA of organisms
was discovered by Charlotte Auerbach in the 1940s (see the sidebar “The
chemistry of mutation” for the full story). There are many types of mutagenic
chemicals; the following sections address four of the most common.
Base analogs
Base analogs are chemicals that are structurally very similar to the bases
normally found in DNA. Base analogs can get incorporated into DNA during
replication because of their structural similarity to normal bases. One base
analog, 5-Bromouracil, is almost identical to the base thymine. Most often, 
5-bromouracil (also known as 5BU), which is pictured in Figure 13-5, gets
incorporated as a substitute for thymine and as such is paired with adenine.
The problem arises when DNA replicates again with 5-bromouracil as part of
the template strand; 5BU’s mistaken for a cytosine and gets mispaired with
guanine. The series of events looks like this: 5-bromouracil is incorporated
where thymine used to be, so T-A becomes 5BU-A. After one round of replica-
tion, the pair is 5BU-G because 5BU is prone to chemical changes that make
it a mimic of cytosine, the base normally paired with guanine. After a second
of replication, the pair ends up as C-G because 5BU isn’t found in normal DNA.
Thus, an A-T ends up as a C-G pair.

Chapter 13: Mutation and Inherited Diseases

Another class of base analog chemicals that foul up normal base pairing is
deaminators. Deamination is a normal process that causes spontaneous
mutation; however, problems arise because deamination can get speeded
up when cells are exposed to chemicals that selectively knock out amino
groups converting cytosines to uracils.
Alkylating agents
Like base analogs, alkylating agents induce mispairings between bases.
Alkylating agents, such as the chemical weapon mustard gas, add chemical
groups to the existing bases that make up DNA. As a consequence, the
altered bases pair with the wrong complement, thus introducing the muta-
tion. Surprisingly, alkylating agents are often used to fight cancer as part
of chemotherapy; therapeutic versions of alkylating agents may inhibit
cancer growth by interfering with the replication of DNA in rapidly divid-
ing cancer cells.
Unusually reactive forms of oxygen
Some forms of oxygen, called free radicals, are unusually reactive, meaning
they react readily with other chemicals. These oxygens can damage DNA
directly (by causing strand breaks) or can convert bases into new unwanted
chemicals that, like most other chemical mutagens, then cause mispairing
during replication. Free radicals of oxygen occur normally in your body as a
product of metabolism, but most of the time, they don’t cause any problems.
Certain activities, such as cigarette smoking and high exposure to radiation,
pollution, and weed killers, increase the number of free radicals in your
system to dangerous levels.
Intercalating agents
Many different kinds of chemicals wedge themselves between the stacks of
bases that form the double helix itself, disrupting the shape of the double
helix. Chemicals with flat ring structures, such as dyes, are prone to fitting
themselves between bases in a process called intercalation. Figure 13-6 shows

intercalating agents at work. Intercalating agents create bulges in the double
helix that often result in insertions or deletions during replication, which in
turn cause frameshift mutations.
Radiation
Radiation damages DNA in a couple of different ways. First, radiation can
break the strands of the double helix by knocking out bonds between sugars
and phosphates (see Chapter 6 for a review of how the strands are put
together). If only one strand is broken, the damage is easily repaired. But
when two strands are broken, large parts of the chromosome can be lost;
these kinds of losses can affect cancer cells (see Chapter 14) and cause birth
defects (see Chapter 15).
Second, radiation causes mutation through the formation of dimers. Dimers
(di- meaning two, mer meaning thing) are unwanted bonds between two
bases stacked on top of each other (on the same side of the helix rather than
on opposite sides). They’re most often formed when two thymines in a DNA
sequence bind together, which you can see in Figure 13-7.

Chapter 13: Mutation and Inherited Diseases

Thymine dimers can be repaired, but if damage is extensive, the cell dies (see
Chapter 14 for how cells are programmed to die). When dimers aren’t
repaired, the machinery of DNA replication assumes that two thymines are
present and puts in two adenines. Unfortunately, cytosine and thymine can
also form dimers, so the default repair strategy sometimes introduces a
mutation instead.
Facing the Consequences of Mutation
When a gene mutates and that mutation is passed along to the next generation,
the new, mutated version of the gene is considered a new allele. Alleles are
simply alternative forms of genes. For most genes, many alleles exist. The
effects of mutations that create new alleles are compared with the mutation’s
physical (phenotypic) effects. If the mutation has no effect, it’s considered silent.
Most silent mutations result from the redundancy of the genetic code. The code
is redundant in the sense that multiple combinations of bases have identical
meanings (see Chapter 9 for more about the redundancy of genetic code).
198

The chemistry of mutation
If ever anyone had an excuse to give up, it’s
Charlotte Auerbach. Born in Germany in 1899,
Auerbach was part of a lively and highly edu-
cated Jewish family. In spite of her deep inter-
est in biology, she became a teacher, convinced
that higher education would be closed to her
because of her religious heritage. As anti-
Jewish sentiment in Germany grew, Auerbach
lost her teaching job in 1933 when every Jewish
secondary-school teacher in the country was
fired. As a result, she emigrated to Britain
where she earned her PhD in genetics in 1935.
Charlotte Auerbach didn’t enjoy the respect her
degree and abilities deserved. She was treat-
ed as a lab technician and instructed to clean
the cages of experimental animals. All that
changed when she met Herman Muller in 1938.
Like Auerbach, Muller was interested in how
genes worked; his approach to the problem was
to induce mutations using radiation and then
examine the effects produced by the defective
genes. Inspired by Muller, Auerbach began work
on chemical mutagens. She focused her efforts
on mustard gas, a horrifically effective chemical
weapon used extensively during World War I.
Her research involved heating liquid mustard gas
and exposing fruit flies to the fumes. It’s a wonder
her experiments didn’t kill her.
What Charlotte’s experiments did do was show
that mustard gas was an alkylating agent, a
mutagen that causes substitution mutations.
Shortly after the end of World War II and after
persevering through burns caused by hot mus-
tard gas, Auerbach published her findings. At
last, she received the recognition and respect
her work warranted. Charlotte Auerbach went
on to have a long and highly successful career
in genetics. She stopped working only after old
age robbed her of her sight. She died in
Edinburgh, Scotland, in 1994 at the age of 95.

Sometimes, mutations cause a completely different amino acid to be put in
during translation. Mutations that actually alter the code are called missense
mutations. A nonsense mutation occurs when a message to stop translation
(called a stop codon) is introduced into the middle of the sequence (see
Chapter 9 for more on translation). The introduction of the stop codon
usually means the gene stops functioning altogether.
Mutations are often divided into two types:
 Neutral: When the amino acid produced from the mutated gene still cre-
ates a fully functional, normal protein (via translation; see Chapter 9).
 Functional change: When a new protein is created, representing a change
in function of the gene. Changes in function caused by mutations can be
either gains or losses. A gain-of-function mutation creates an entirely new
trait or phenotype. Sometimes, the new trait is harmless, like a new eye
color. In other cases, the gain is decidedly harmful and usually autosomal
dominant (flip to Chapter 12 for more on autosomal dominant traits)
because the gene is producing a new protein that actually does something
(the gain-of-function part). Even though there’s only one copy of the new
allele, its effect is noticeable and thus considered dominant over the origi-
nal, unmutated allele.
If a mutation causes the gene to stop functioning altogether or vastly
alters normal function, it’s considered a loss-of-function mutation. All non-
sense mutations are loss-of-function mutations, but not all loss-of-function
mutations are the result of nonsense mutations. The usefulness of the pro-
tein made from a particular gene can be lost even when no stop codon
has been added prematurely. Insertions and deletions are often loss-of-
function mutations because they cause frameshifts (Chapter 9 explains
how the genetic code is read in frames). Frameshifts cause an entirely
new set of amino acids to be put together from the new set of instruc-
tions. Most of the time, these new proteins are useless and nonfunctional.
Loss-of-function mutations are usually recessive because the normal,
unmutated allele is still producing product, usually enough to compensate
for the mutated allele. Loss-of-function mutations are only detected when
a person is homozygous for the mutation and is making no functional gene
product at all.
Evaluating Options for DNA Repair
Mutations in your DNA can be repaired in four major ways:
 Mismatch repair: Incorrect bases are found, removed, and replaced with
the correct, complementary base. Most of the time, DNA polymerase,
the enzyme that helps make new DNA, immediately detects mismatched
bases put in by mistake during replication. DNA polymerase can back up
and correct the error without missing a beat. But if a mismatched base
199
Chapter 13: Mutation and Inherited Diseases

gets put in some other way (through strand slipups, for example), a set
of enzymes that are constantly scrutinizing the double strand to detect
bulges or constrictions signal a mismatched base pair. The mismatch
repair enzymes can detect any differences between the template and the
newly synthesized strand, so they clip out the wrong base and, using
the template strand as a guide, insert the correct base.
 Direct repair: Bases that are modified in some way (like when oxidation
converts a base to some new form) are converted back to their original
states. Direct repair enzymes look for bases that have been converted
to some new chemical, usually by the addition of some unwanted group of
atoms. Instead of using a cut-and-paste mechanism, the enzymes clip off
the atoms that don’t belong, converting the base back to its original form.
 Base-excision repairs: Base-excisions and nucleotide-excisions (check
out the next bullet) work in much the same way. Base-excisions occur
when an unwanted base (such as uracil; see the section “Spontaneous
chemical changes” earlier in this chapter) is found. Specialized enzymes
recognize the damage, and the base is snipped out and replaced with
the correct one.
 Nucleotide-excision repair: Nucleotide-excision means that the entire
nucleotide (and sometimes several surrounding nucleotides as well)
gets removed all at once. When intercalating agents or dimers distort
the double helix, nucleotide-excision repair mechanisms step in to snip
part of the strand, remove the damage, and synthesize fresh DNA to
replace the damaged section.
As with base excision, specialized enzymes recognize the damaged sec-
tion of the DNA. The damaged section is removed, and newly synthesized
DNA is laid down to replace it. In nucleotide-excision, the double helix is
opened up, much like it is during replication (which I cover in Chapter 7).
The sugar-phosphate backbone of the damaged strand is broken in two
places to allow removal of that entire portion of the strand. DNA poly-
merase synthesizes a new section, and DNA ligase seals the breaks in
the strand to complete the repair process.
Examining Common Inherited Diseases
Even though mutation is a common occurrence, most inherited diseases are
comfortingly rare. Inherited disorders are often recessive and show up only
when an individual is homozygous for the trait. Inherited diseases aren’t
nonexistent, though. The following sections provide details on three rela-
tively common inherited diseases. You can find out more about inheritance
patterns in Chapter 12.
200
Part III: Genetics and Your Health 

Cystic fibrosis
The most common inherited disorder among Caucasians in the United States
is cystic fibrosis (CF); this autosomal recessive disorder occurs in roughly
one in every 3,000 births (autosomal recessive means the gene isn’t on a sex
chromosome and a person must have two copies of the allele to get the dis-
ease; see Chapter 3). The mutations (there can be several) that cause CF
occur in a gene located on chromosome 7. Persons affected with CF produce
thick, sticky mucus in their lungs, intestines, and pancreas.
The gene implicated in CF, called the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance
regulator gene (or CFTR for short), normally controls the passage of salt across
cell membranes. Water naturally moves to areas where salt is more concen-
trated, so the movement of salt from one place to another has an effect on how
much water is present in parts of the body. In persons with CF, the removal
of salt from the body (via sweat) is abnormally high. As a result, the lungs,
pancreas, and digestive system can’t retain enough water to dilute the mucus
normally found in those systems, so the mucus produced by persons affect by
CF is unusually thick. The buildup of thick mucus blocks breathing passages
and makes waste elimination difficult, causing severe breathing and digestive
difficulties and a high susceptibility to respiratory illnesses.
CF is diagnosed in two ways:
 Persons who may be carriers for the mutated allele can be tested geneti-
cally (Chapter 12 covers genetic testing).
 Children possibly affected by the disease are diagnosed by a “sweat test.”
Their sweat is tested for salt content, and abnormally high amounts of
salt indicate that the child has the disease.
CF is a target of gene therapy (see Chapter 16), but it resists a cure. Most
afflicted persons must endure a lifetime of therapy that includes having
someone pound on their chests so that they can remove the mucus from
their lungs by coughing. The prognosis for CF has improved dramatically,
yet most persons affected by the disease don’t live far beyond their 30s.

area, contact the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation at 1-800-344-4823 (www.cff.
org) or the Canadian Cystic Fibrosis Foundation at 1-800-378-2233 (www.
cysticfibrosis.ca).
Sickle cell anemia
Sickle cell anemia is the most common genetic disorder among African
Americans in the United States — roughly one in every 400 births are affected
by this autosomal recessive disorder. The mutation responsible for sickle cell
201
Chapter 13: Mutation and Inherited Diseases

is found in chromosome 11, the gene responsible for making one part of the
protein complex that composes hemoglobin (check out Chapter 9 for how
complex proteins are formed). In the case of sickle cell, one base is mutated
from adenine to thymine (a transversion). The mistake changes one amino
acid added during translation from glutamic acid to valine, producing a pro-
tein that folds improperly and can’t carry oxygen effectively.
The red blood cells of persons affected by sickle cell take on the disease’s char-
acteristic crescent shape when oxygen levels in the body are lower than usual
(often as the result of aerobic exercise). The sickling event has the side effect
of causing blood clots to form in the smaller blood vessels (capillaries)
throughout the body. Clot formation is extremely painful and also causes
damage to tissues that are sensitive to oxygen deprivation. Persons with sickle
cell are vulnerable to kidney failure, yet with good medical care, most affected
persons are expected to live into middle adulthood (40–50 years of age).
For more information on sickle cell anemia, you can contact the American
Sickle Cell Anemia Association at 1-216-229-8600 (www.ascaa.org).
Tay-Sachs
An autosomal recessive disorder, Tay-Sachs is a progressive, fatal disease of
the nervous system and is unusually common among persons of Ashkenazi
(Eastern European) Jewish ancestry. One in every 30 to 40 persons of Jewish
ancestry is a carrier of Tay-Sachs. French Canadians and persons of Cajun
(south Louisiana) descent are also often carriers of the mutated allele.
The mutation that causes Tay-Sachs is found in the gene that codes for the
enzyme hexosaminidase A (HEXA). Normally, your body breaks down a class
of fats called gangliosides. When HEXA is mutated, the normal metabolism of
gangliosides stops, and the fats build up in the brain, causing damage.
Children inheriting two copies of the affected allele are normal at birth, but
as the fats build up in their brains over time, these children become blind,
deaf, mentally impaired and ultimately paralyzed. Most children with Tay-
Sachs don’t survive beyond the age of 4. Unlike some metabolic disorders,
such as phenylketonuria (see Chapter 12), changes in diet don’t prevent the
buildup of the unwanted chemical in the body.

f you’ve had personal experience with cancer, you’re not alone. I’ve lost
family members, co-workers, students, and friends to this insidious dis-
ease — it’s highly likely that you have, too. Second only to heart disease,
cancer causes the deaths of around 500,000 persons a year in the United
States alone, and roughly 1.3 million Americans will be diagnosed with cancer
in 2005. Cancer is a genetic disorder that involves how cells grow and divide.
Your likelihood of getting cancer is influenced by your genes (the genes you
inherited from your parents) and your exposure to certain chemicals and
radiation. Sometimes, cancers occur from random, spontaneous mutations —
events that defy explanation and have no apparent cause. In this chapter, you
find out what cancer is, the genetic basis of cancers, and some details about
the most common types of cancer.
If you skipped over Chapter 2 on cells, you may want to backtrack before
delving into this chapter — cell information will help you understand what
you read here. All cancers arise from mutations; you can discover how and
why mutations occur in Chapter 13. Cancer treatments in the form of gene
therapy are covered in Chapter 16.
Defining Cancer
Cancer is, in essence, cell division running out of control. As I explain in
Chapter 2, the cell cycle is normally a carefully regulated process. Cells grow
and divide on a schedule that’s determined by the type of cell involved. Skin
cells grow and divide continuously because replacing dead skin cells is a
never-ending job. Some cells retire from the cell cycle: The cells in your brain
and nervous system don’t take part in the cell cycle; no growth and no cell
division occur there during adulthood. Cancer cells, on the other hand, don’t
obey the rules and have their own, often frightening, agendas and schedules.

In the following sections, I outline the two basic categories of cancers —
benign and malignant. Benign cancers grow out of control but don’t invade
surrounding tissues. Malignant cancers are invasive and have a disturbing ten-
dency to travel and show up in new sites around the body.
Benign growths
When a cancer is said to be benign, the cells are dividing at an abnormally
high rate but are expected to remain in the same location. Benign cancers
tend to grow rather slowly, and they create trouble because of tumor forma-
tion. In general, a tumor is any mass of abnormal cells. Tumors cause prob-
lems because they take up space and compress nearby organs. For example,
a tumor that grows near a blood vessel can eventually cut off blood flow just
by virtue of its bulk. Benign growths can sometimes also interfere with
normal body function and even affect genes by altering hormone production
(see Chapter 10 for how hormones control genes).
Generally, benign growths are characterized by their lack of invasiveness. A
benign tumor is usually well defined from surrounding tissue, pushes other tis-
sues aside, and can be easily moved about. The cells of benign tumors usually
bear a strong resemblance to the tissues they start from. For example, under a
microscope, a cell from a benign skin cancer looks similar to a normal skin cell.
A different sort of benign cell growth is called a dysplasia, a cell with an abnor-
mal appearance. Dysplasias aren’t cancerous (that is, they don’t divide out of
control) but are worrisome because they have the potential to go through
changes that lead to malignant cancers. When examined under the micro-
scope, dysplasias often have enlarged cell nuclei and a “disorderly” appear-
ance. In other words, they have irregular shapes and sizes relative to other
cells of the same type. Cancer cells sometimes start as one cell type (benign)
but, if left untreated, can give rise to more invasive types as time goes on.
204
Part III: Genetics and Your Health 

Treatment of benign growths (including dysplasias) varies widely depending
upon the size of the tumor, its potential for growth, the location of the growth,
and the probability that cell change may lead to malignancy (invasive forms of
cancer; see the following section). Some benign growths shrink and disappear
on their own, and others require surgical removal. Some organs and tissues
are more likely to have benign growths.
 The prostate gland, a ring-shaped gland that surrounds the urethra at
the base of a man’s bladder, tends to enlarge in older men.
 The lining cells of a woman’s cervix, the opening to the uterus, often dis-
play dysplasia long before cancer develops.
 Benign tumors may form in breast tissue and in the uterus.
The best defense against benign tumors (and any sort of cancer) is early
detection:
 Men should undergo yearly prostate checkups beginning at age 50.
 All women over age 20 should do breast self-exams every month.
 All women should get yearly mammograms starting at age 40.
 A test to assess the cells of a woman’s cervix, called a Pap smear, should
be done every one to three years depending upon a woman’s age and
the results of her previous exams.
Malignancies
Probably one of the most frightening words a doctor can utter is “malignant.”
Malignancy is characterized by cancer cells’ rapid growth, invasion into
neighboring tissues, and the tendency to metastasize. Metastasis occurs
when cancer cells begin to grow in other parts of the body besides the
original tumor site; cancers tend to metastasize to the bones, liver, lungs,
and brain. Like benign growths, malignancies form tumors, but malignant
tumors are poorly defined from the surrounding tissue — in other words,
it’s difficult to tell where the tumor ends and normal tissue begins. (See the
section “Metastasis: Cancer on the go” later in this chapter for more info on
the process.)
Malignant cells tend to look very different from the cells they arise from
(Figure 14-1 shows the differences). The cells of malignant tumors often look
more like tissues from embryos or stem cells than normal “mature” cells.
Malignant cells tend to have large nuclei, and the cells themselves are usually
larger than normal. The more abnormal the cells appear, the more likely it is
that the tumor may be invasive and able to metastasize.
205
Chapter 14: The Genetics of Cancer

Malignancies fall into one of five categories based on the tissue type they
arise from:
 Carcinomas are associated with skin, nervous system, gut, and respira-
tory tract tissue.
 Sarcomas are associated with connective tissue (such as muscle) and
bone.
 Leukemias (related to sarcomas) are cancers of the blood.
 Lymphomas develop in glands that fight infection (lymph nodes and
glands scattered throughout the body).
 Myelomas start in the bone marrow.
Cancer can occur in essentially any cell of the body. The human body has 300
or so different cell types, and doctors have identified 200 forms of cancer.
Treatment of malignancy varies depending upon the location of the tumor, the
degree of invasion, the potential for metastasis, and a host of other factors.
Treatment may include surgical removal of the tumor, surrounding tissues,
and lymph nodes (little knots of immune tissue found in scattered locations
around the body). Chemotherapy (administering of anticancer drugs) and
radiation may also be used to combat the growth of invasive cancers. Some
forms of gene therapy, which I address in Chapter 16, may also prove helpful.
Metastasis: Cancer on the go
Cells in your body stay in their normal places because of physical barriers
to cell growth. One such barrier is called the basal lamina. The basal lamina
(or basement membrane) is a thin sheet of proteins that’s sandwiched

206

between layers of cells. Metastatic cells produce enzymes that destroy the
basal lamina and other barriers between cell types. Essentially, metastatic
cells eat their way out by literally digesting the membranes designed to keep
cells from invading each other’s space. Sometimes, these invasions allow
metastatic cells to enter the bloodstream, which transports the cells to new
sites where they can set up shop to begin a new cycle of growth and invasion.
Another consequence of breaking down the basal lamina is that the action
allows tumors to set up their own blood supply in a process called angiogene-
sis. Angiogenesis is the formation of new blood vessels to supply the tumor
cells with oxygen and nutrients. Tumors may even secrete their own growth
factors to encourage the process of angiogenesis. Oddly, primary tumors
(the first site of tumor growth in the body) seem to restrain angiogenesis in
metastasized tissue. When the primary tumor is removed, this control is
released, and angiogenesis in the metastasized tumors speeds up. Increased
angiogenesis means that the metastasized tumors may start to grow more
rapidly, launching a new round of treatment.
A study of breast cancer in 2003 showed that cells that plant the seeds for
metastasis depart the original tumor sites without the mutations that are
thought to create metastasis in the first place. The wandering cells acquire
mutations later, after they’ve settled in new locations. This discovery means
that the old view (still found in most textbooks) of how metastasis develops —
a step-wise, one mutation at a time process that happens in the primary tumor
cells — is probably wrong.
Recognizing Cancer as a DNA Disease
Normally, the cell cycle is regulated by a host of genes. Thus, at its root,
cancer is a disease of the DNA. DNA becomes damaged by mutation, and
mutations can ultimately take the phenotype (physical trait) of cancer. The
good news is it takes more than one mutation to give a cell the potential to
become cancerous. The transformation from normal cell to cancer cell is
thought to require certain genetic changes. These mutations can happen in
any order — it’s not a 1-2-3 process.
 A mutation occurs that starts cells on an abnormally high rate of cell
division.
 A mutation in one (or more) rapidly dividing cells confers the ability to
invade surrounding tissue.
 Additional mutations accumulate to confer more invasive properties or
the ability to metastasize.
207
Chapter 14: The Genetics of Cancer

Most cancers arise from two or more mutations that occur in the DNA of one
cell. Tumors result from many cell divisions. The original cell containing the
mutations divides, and that cell’s “offspring” divide over and over to form a
tumor (see Figure 14-2).
Exploring the cell cycle and cancer
The cell cycle and division (called mitosis; covered in Chapter 2) is tightly
regulated in normal cells. Cells must pass through checkpoints, or stages of
the cell cycle, in order to proceed to the next stage. If DNA synthesis isn’t
complete or damage to the DNA hasn’t been repaired, the checkpoints pre-
vent the cell from moving into another stage of division. These checkpoints
protect the integrity of the cell and the DNA inside it. Figure 14-3 shows the
cell cycle and the checkpoints that occur throughout.
Chapter 2 explains two checkpoints of the cell cycle. There are actually a
total of four major conditions — basically, quality control points — that must
be met for cells to divide:
 DNA must be undamaged (no mismatches, bulges, or strand breaks like
those described in Chapter 13) for the cell to pass from G1 of interphase
into S (DNA synthesis).
 All the chromosomes must complete replication for the cell to pass out of S.
 DNA must be undamaged to start prophase of mitosis.
 Spindles required to separate chromosomes must form properly for
mitosis to be completed.
If any of these conditions are not met, the cell is “arrested” and not allowed
to continue to the next phase of division. Many genes and the proteins they
produce are responsible for making sure that cells meet all the necessary
conditions for cell division.

Part III: Genetics and Your Health 

When it comes to cancer and how things go wrong with the cell cycle, two
types of genes are especially important:
 Proto-oncogenes, which stimulate the cell to grow and divide, basically
acting to push the cell through the checkpoints.
 Tumor-suppressor genes, which act to stop cell growth and tell cells
when their normal lifespans have ended.
Basically, two things go on in the cell: One set of genes (and their products)
acts like an accelerator to tell cells to grow and divide, and a second set of
genes puts on the brakes, telling cells when to stop growing, when not to
divide, and even when to die.
The mutations that cause cancer either turn proto-oncogenes into oncogenes
(turning the accelerator permanently “on”) or damage tumor-suppressor
genes (removing the brakes).
Genes gone wrong: Oncogenes
You can think of oncogenes as “on” genes because that’s essentially what
these genes do: They keep cell division turned on. Many genes, when mutated,
can become oncogenes. All oncogenes have several things in common:
 Their mutations usually represent a gain of function (see Chapter 13).
 They’re dominant in their actions.
 Their effects cause excessive numbers of cells to be produced.
Oncogenes were the first genes identified to play a role in cancer. In 1910,
Peyton Rous identified a virus that caused cancer in chickens. It took 60
years for scientists to identify the gene carried by the virus, the first known
oncogene. It turns out that many viruses can cause cancer in animals and
humans; for more on how these viruses do their dirty work, see the sidebar
“Exploring the link between viruses and cancer.”

Chapter 14: The Genetics of Cancer

You have at least 70 naturally occurring proto-oncogenes in your DNA.
Normally, these genes carry out regulatory jobs necessary for normal func-
tioning. It’s only when these genes gain mutations and become oncogenes
that they switch from good genes to cancer-causers. Cancer cells tend to
210
Part III: Genetics and Your Health 
Exploring the link between viruses and cancer
It’s becoming more and more clear that viruses
play a significant role in the appearance of
cancer in humans. Second only to the risk factor
of cigarette smoking, viruses are responsible for
at least 15 percent of all malignancies.
Numerous viruses are implicated in the forma-
tion of tumors, and some of these viruses turn
out to have familiar names like herpes, hepatitis,
and Epstein-Barr (the virus responsible for
mononucleosis, a common infection of adoles-
cence that sometimes goes by the affectionate
name of the “kissing disease”). How these
viruses change from causing infection to caus-
ing cancer is the subject of intense research.
One class of viruses implicated in cancer is
retroviruses. One familiar retrovirus that makes
significant assaults on human health is HIV
(Human Immunodeficiency Virus), which causes
AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome).
And if you have a cat, you may be familiar with
feline leukemia, which is also caused by a retro-
virus (humans are immune to this cat virus). Most
retroviruses use RNA as their genetic material.
Viruses aren’t really alive, so to replicate their
genes, they have to hijack a living cell.
Retroviruses use the host cell’s machinery to
synthesize DNA copies of their RNA chromo-
somes. The viral DNA then gets inserted into the
host cell’s chromosome where the virus genes
can be active and wreak havoc with the cell and,
in turn, the entire organism. Retroviruses that
cause cancer copy their oncogenes into the host
cell. The oncogenes team up with additional
mutations to cause cancer.
If you’ve ever had a wart, then you’re already
acquainted with the harmless version of a virus
whose relatives can cause cancer. Human papil-
loma virus (HPV) causes genital warts and is
linked to cervical cancer in women. Infection
with the HPV associated with cervical cancer
usually starts with dysplasia (the formation of
abnormal but noncancerous cells). It usually
takes many years for cervical cancer to develop,
which it does only rarely. Nevertheless, over
10,000 women in the United States alone are
likely to be diagnosed with cervical cancer in
2005. Early screening, in the form of Pap smears,
for cervical cancer has improved detection and
saved the lives of countless women.
Another virus has recently been discovered to be
linked with an aggressive form of breast cancer.
Mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) has long
been known to cause breast cancer in mice.
Recent research shows that humans may also be
vulnerable to MMTV. Certain kinds of breast can-
cers are more common in regions (such as the
Middle East and Northern Africa) where a partic-
ular species of mouse (House Mouse, Mus
domesticus) that carries MMTV is also common.
These cancers tend to be very invasive and
aggressive and are often accompanied by
swelling and infection-like symptoms. Re-
searchers examined breast tissue from affected
women for the presence of genes similar to those
of the virus. They found that North African women
often carried a MMTV-like gene; many women
from this region also showed other signs of
having been infected with the virus. Although the
link between the virus MMTV and human breast
cancer is still not certain, this and other research
suggests that viruses may play significant roles
in many human cancers.

have multiple copies of oncogenes because the genes somehow duplicate
themselves in a process called amplification. This duplication allows those
genes to have much stronger effects than they normally would.
A group of geneticists think they’ve figured out how cancer genes go
about copying themselves. The first step in the process is formation of a
palindrome — a DNA sequence that reads the same way forwards and back-
wards. In this case, the palindrome is created when a sequence gets clipped
out of the DNA, flipped around, duplicated, and then inserted into the DNA
(it’s called an inverted repeat). The DNA of tumor cells has unusual numbers
of palindromes. Palindromes seem to encourage more cut-and-paste duplica-
tions in the DNA around them, leading to amplification of nearby genes, like
oncogenes.
The first oncogene identified in humans resides on chromosome 11. The sci-
entists responsible for its discovery were looking for the gene responsible for
bladder cancer. They took cancerous cells and isolated their DNA; then they
introduced small parts of the cancer cell’s DNA into a bacteria and allowed
the bacteria to infect normal cells growing in test tubes. The scientists were
looking for the part of the DNA present in cancer cells that would transform
the normal cells into cancerous ones. The gene they found, now called HRAS1,
was very similar to a virus oncogene that had been found in rats. The mutation
that makes HRAS1 into an oncogene affects only three bases of the genetic
code (called a codon; see Chapter 9). This tiny change causes HRAS1 to con-
stantly send the signal “divide” to affected cells.
Since the discovery of HRAS1, a whole group of oncogenes has been found;
they’re known collectively as the ras genes. All the ras genes work much the
same way and, when mutated, turn the cell cycle permanently “on.” In spite
of their dominant activities, a single mutated oncogene usually isn’t enough
to cause cancer all by itself. That’s because tumor-suppressor genes (see the
next section) are still acting to put on the brakes and keep cell growth from
getting out of control.
Oncogenes aren’t usually implicated in inherited forms of cancer. Most onco-
genes show up as somatic mutations that can’t be passed on from parent to
child.
The good guys: Tumor-suppressor genes
Tumor-suppressor genes are the cell cycle’s brakes. Normally, these genes
work to slow or stop cell growth and to put a halt to the cell cycle. When
these genes fail, cells can divide out of control, meaning that mutations in
tumor-suppressor genes are loss-of-function mutations (covered in Chapter 13). 
Loss-of-function mutations generally only show up as phenotype when two
bad copies are present — therefore, the loss of tumor-suppression means that
two events have occurred to make the cells homozygous for the mutation.
211
Chapter 14: The Genetics of Cancer

The first gene recognized as a tumor suppressor is associated with cancer of
the eye, called retinoblastoma. Retinoblastoma often runs in families and
shows up in very young children. In 1971, geneticist Alfred Knudson sug-
gested that one mutated allele of the gene was being passed from parent to
child and that a mutation event in the child was required for the cancer to
occur. The gene responsible, called RB, was mapped to chromosome 13 and
is implicated in other forms of cancer such as breast, prostate, and bone
(osteosarcoma). RB turns out to be a very important gene. If both copies are
mutated in embryos, the mutations are lethal, suggesting that normal RB
function is required for survival.
RB regulates the cell cycle by interacting with transcription factors (tran-
scription factors are discussed in greater detail in Chapters 8 and 10). These
particular transcription factors control the expression of genes that push the
cell through the checkpoint at the end of G1, just before DNA synthesis.
When the proteins that RB codes for (called pRB) are attached to the tran-
scription factors, the genes that turn on the cell cycle aren’t allowed to func-
tion. Normally, pRB and the transcription factors go through periods of being
attached and coming apart, turning the cell cycle on and off. If both copies of
RB are mutated, then this important brake system goes missing. As a result,
affected cells move through the cell cycle faster than normal and divide with-
out stopping. RB not only interacts with transcription factors to control the
cell cycle; it’s also thought to play a role in replication, DNA repair, and apop-
tosis (programmed cell death).
One of the most important tumor-suppressor genes identified to date is TP53.
TP53, found on chromosome 17, codes for the cell-cycle regulating protein
p53. Mutations that lead to loss of p53 function are implicated in a wide vari-
ety of cancers. The most important of p53’s roles may be in regulating when
cells die, a process known as apoptosis:
 When DNA has been damaged, the cell cycle is stopped to allow repairs
to be carried out.
 If repair isn’t possible, the cell receives the signal to die (apoptosis).
If you’ve ever had a bad sunburn, then you have first-hand experience with
apoptosis. Apoptosis, also known by the gloomy moniker “programmed cell
suicide,” occurs when the DNA of a cell is too damaged to be repaired. Rather
than allow the damage to go through replication and become cemented into
the DNA as mutation, the cell voluntarily dies. In the case of your severe sun-
burn, the DNA of the exposed skin cells was damaged by the sun’s radiation.
In many cases, the DNA strands were broken, probably in many different
places. Those skin cells killed themselves off, resulting in the unpleasant skin
peeling that you suffered. When your DNA gets damaged from too much sun
exposure or because of any other mutagen (see Chapter 13 for examples), a
protein called p21 stops the cell cycle. Coded by a gene on the X chromosome,
p21 is produced when the cell is stressed. The presence of p21 stops the cell
212
Part III: Genetics and Your Health 

from dividing and allows repair mechanisms to heal the damaged DNA. If the
damage is beyond repair, the cell may skip p21 altogether. Instead, the tumor-
suppressor protein p53 signals the cell to kill itself.
When the cell gets the message that says, “Die!” a gene called BAX swings
into action. BAX sends the cell off to its destruction by signaling the
mitochondria — those energy powerhouses of the cell — which release
a wrecking-crew of proteins that go about breaking up the chromosomes
and killing the cell from the inside. When your cells die due to injury (like
a burn or infection), the process is a messy one: The cells explode, causing
surrounding cells to react in the form of inflammation. Not so in apoptosis.
The cells killed by the actions of apoptosis are neatly packaged so that sur-
rounding tissues don’t react. Cells that specialize in garbage collection and
disposal, called phagocytes (meaning cells that eat), do the rest.
Drugs used to fight cancer often try to take advantage of the apoptosis path-
way to cell death. The drugs turn on the signals for apoptosis to trick the
cancer cells into killing themselves. Radiation therapy, also used to treat
cancer by introducing double-strand breaks (see Chapter 13 for more on this
kind of DNA damage), relies on the cells knowing when to commit suicide.
Unfortunately, some of the mutations that create cancer in the first place,
such as damage to the p53 protein-signaling network, make cancer cells
resistant to apoptosis. In other words, in addition to growing and dividing
without restriction, cancer cells don’t know when to die.
Demystifying chromosome abnormalities
Large-scale chromosome changes — the kinds that are visible when karyo-
typing (chromosome examination; see Chapter 15 for details) is done — are
associated with some cancers. These chromosome changes (like losses of
chromosomes) often occur after cancer develops and occur because the DNA
in cancer cells is really unstable and prone to lots of breakage. Normally, dam-
aged DNA is detected by proteins that keep tabs on the cell cycle. When
breaks are found, either the cell cycle is stopped and repairs are initiated or
the cell dies. Because the root of cancer is the loss of genetic quality control
functions provided by proto-oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes, it’s no
surprise that breaks in the cancer-cell DNA lead to losses and rearrangements
of big chunks of chromosomes as the cell cycle rolls on without interruption.
One of the biggest problems with all this genetic instability in cancer cells is
that a tumor is likely to have several different genotypes amongst its many
cells, which makes treatment difficult. Chemotherapy that’s effective at treat-
ing cells with one sort of mutation may not be useful for another.
Three types of damage — deletions, inversions, and translocations — can
interrupt tumor-suppressor genes, rendering them nonfunctional. Trans-
locations and inversions may change the positions of certain genes so that
213
Chapter 14: The Genetics of Cancer

the gene gets regulated in a new way (see Chapter 10 for more about how
gene expression is regulated by location). Chronic myeloid leukemia, for
example, is caused by a translocation event between chromosomes 9 and 22.
This form of leukemia is a cancer of the blood that affects the bone marrow.
Translocations generally result from double-strand breaks (radiation and cig-
arette smoking are risk factors). In the case of chronic myeloid leukemia, the
translocation event makes chromosome 22 unusually short. (This shortened
version of the chromosome is called the Philadelphia chromosome because
geneticists working in that city discovered it.) The translocation event causes
two genes, one from each chromosome, to become fused together. The new
gene product acts as a powerful oncogene, leading to out-of-control cell divi-
sion and eventually leukemia.
Certain cancers seem prone to losing particular chromosomes altogether,
resulting in monosomies (similar to those described in Chapter 15). For
instance, one copy of chromosome 10 often goes missing in the cells of
glioblastomas, a deadly form of brain cancer. Cancer cells are also prone to
nondisjunction leading to localized trisomies. It appears that mutations in the
p53 gene, which can stop the cell cycle for DNA repair and signal apoptosis,
are linked to these localized changes in chromosome number.
Breaking Down the Types of Cancers
Around 200 different cancers occur in humans. Many are site specific, mean-
ing the tumor is associated with a particular part of the body. Some cancers
seem to appear just about anywhere, in any organ system. This section isn’t
meant to provide an exhaustive list of cancers; instead, it touches on the
genetics of some of the more common cancers. 
For more information on all types of cancers, visit the American Cancer Society
(www.cancer.org) and the National Cancer Institute (www.cancer.gov)
online.
Hereditary cancers
Hereditary cancers are those that tend to run in families. No one ever inherits
cancer; what’s inherited is the predisposition to certain sorts of cancer. What
this means is that certain cancers tend to run in families because one or
more mutations are being passed on from parent to child. Most geneticists
agree that additional mutations are required to trigger the actual disease.
Just because you have a family history of a particular cancer doesn’t mean
you’ll get it. The opposite is also true: Just because you don’t have a family
history doesn’t mean you won’t get cancer.
214

Prostate cancer
The most common cancer in the United States is prostate cancer. The prostate
is a walnut-sized gland found at the base of a man’s urinary bladder. The ure-
thra, the tube that carries urine outside the body, runs through the center of
the prostate gland. The prostate generates seminal fluid, important for the
production of sperm. On average, over 200,000 men are likely to be diagnosed
with prostate cancer each year. The highest rates of prostate cancer occur
among African American men, likely because of lack of screening and delayed
treatment.
Many mutations are associated with family history of prostate cancer, but the
number-one risk factor associated with prostate cancer is age. Older men are
far more likely to develop this disease.
For most men, the first clue of changes in the prostate gland is difficulty in
urination and decreased urine flow. Many older men experience swelling of
the prostate, and those changes are often benign. The best screening tests
for prostate cancer are a blood test, called PSA (for prostate-specific anti-
gen), and a manual examination by a physician. Men should start getting
screened for prostate cancer at age 50. Men with a family history of the dis-
ease (father, brother, or son) should start earlier — the American Cancer
Society suggests that screening begin at age 45.
Numerous genes are implicated in prostate cancer. One gene, PRCA1 on chro-
mosome 1, is designated “the” hereditary prostate cancer gene. But less than
10 percent of all cases of prostate cancers are thought to originate with muta-
tions at PRCA1. Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (see Chapter 24) lists at
least 16 genes associated with prostate cancer, including p53 and RB; it’s
likely that several genes interact to cause the cell cycle of the prostate gland
to spiral out of control. There also seems to be a link between prostate
cancer and the two BRCA genes implicated in breast cancer. Thus, men and
women with family histories of either disease may be susceptible to develop-
ing cancer.
Breast cancer
Breast cancer is the second most common cancer in America (see Table 14-1).
Sadly, over 40,000 people, mostly women, are likely to die of the disease each
year. Different sorts of breast cancer are distinguished by the part of the breast
that develops the tumor. Regardless of the type of breast cancer, though, the
number one risk factor appears to be a family history of the disease. Family
history of breast cancer is usually defined as having one of the following:
 A mother or sister diagnosed with breast or ovarian cancer before age 50
 Two “first-degree” relatives (mother, sister, daughter) with breast cancer
at any age
 A male relative diagnosed with breast cancer
215
Chapter 14: The Genetics of Cancer

Generally, the first symptom of breast cancer is a lump in the breast tissue.
The lump may be painless or sore, hard (like a firm knot) or soft; the edges of
the lump may not be easy to detect, but in some cases they’re very easy to
feel. Other symptoms include swelling, changes in the skin of the breast,
nipple pain or unexpected discharge, and a swelling in the armpit.
Researchers have identified two breast cancer genes: BRCA1 and BRCA2 (for
BReast CAncer genes one and two). These genes account for slightly less than
25 percent of inherited breast cancers, however. Mutations on the gene for
p53, along with numerous other genes, are also associated with hereditary
forms of breast cancer (see “The good guys: Tumor-suppressor genes” for
more on p53). Breast cancers associated with mutations of BRCA1 and/or
BRCA2 seem to be inherited as autosomal dominant disorders (genetic
disorders resulting from one bad copy of a gene; see Chapter 12 for more
on inheritance patterns).
When it comes to breast cancer, penetrance is roughly 50 percent, meaning
50 percent of the people inheriting a mutation in one of the breast cancer
genes will develop cancer. (This penetrance value is based on a lifespan of
85 years, by the way, so people living 85 years have a 50 percent chance
of expressing the phenotype of cancer.)
Other cancers are also associated with mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2,
including ovarian, prostate, and male breast cancer.
Both BRCA genes are tumor-suppressor genes. The roles these genes play in
the cell cycle aren’t especially well defined. BRCA1 has a role in regulating
when cells pass through the critical G1-S checkpoint, but exactly how BRCA1
does its job isn’t clear. As for BRCA2, it apparently has some cell cycle duties
and also plays a role in DNA repair, especially of double-strand breaks.
Early detection of breast cancer is the best defense against the disease. Women
with family histories of breast cancer should be screened by a physician at
least once a year (some doctors recommend screenings every six months).
Genetic tests are available to confirm the presence of mutations that produce
breast cancer, but at present, these tests are very expensive and don’t yield
any information about the true likelihood of getting the disease. After breast
cancer is diagnosed, treatment options vary based on the kind of cancer.
Breast cancer is considered very treatable, and the prognosis for recovery is
very good for most patients.
Colon cancer
One hereditary cancer that’s considered highly treatable (when detected early)
is colon cancer. Your colon is defined by the large intestine, the bulky tube that
carries waste products to your rectum for defecation. Over 100,000 people are
likely to be diagnosed with colon cancer each year. Numerous risk factors are
associated with colon cancer, including:
216
Part III: Genetics and Your Health 

 Family history of the disease (meaning parent, child, or sibling)
 Age; persons over 50 are at greater risk
 High-fat diet
 Obesity
 History of alcohol abuse
 Smoking
Almost all colon cancers start as benign growths called polyps. These polyps
are tiny wart-like protrusions on the wall of the colon. If colon polyps are left
untreated, a ras oncogene often becomes active in the cells of one or more
of the polyps, causing the affected polyps to increase in size (see the “Genes
gone wrong: Oncogenes” section earlier in the chapter for more on how
oncogenes work). When the tumors get big enough, they change status and
are called adenomas. Adenomas are benign cancers but are susceptible to
mutation, often of the tumor-suppressor gene that controls p53. When p53 is
lost through mutation, the adenoma becomes a carcinoma — a malignant and
invasive tumor.
Early detection and treatment is critical to prevent colon polyps from becom-
ing cancerous. If large numbers of polyps develop, the likelihood that at least
one will become malignant is very high. The good news is that the changes in
the colon usually accumulate slowly, over the course of several years. The
American Cancer Society recommends that all persons over 50 years of age
be screened for colon cancer. Two tests are generally done: a test to detect
blood in the feces and a visual inspection, called a colonoscopy, of the inside
of the colon using a flexible scope. The test kit to detect blood in the feces is
available over the counter at most drug stores. Positive results are nothing to
panic over — just see your physician. Colonoscopy is carried out under light
anesthesia and gives your physician the most accurate means of diagnosing
the presence of polyps and grabbing samples of cells for testing.
Preventable cancers
Preventable cancers are cancers associated with particular risk factors that
can be controlled and avoided. No one ever chooses to get cancer, but the
lifestyle choices that people make leave them more likely to develop certain
kinds of cancer in their lifetimes. Three of the most avoidable kinds of cancer
associated with lifestyle choices are lung cancer, mouth cancers, and skin
cancer.
Lung cancer
More people die from lung cancer every year than any other kind of cancer.
Nearly 175,000 Americans are likely to be diagnosed with lung cancer in 2005,
and it’s estimated that over 160,000 people in the United States will die of the
217
Chapter 14: The Genetics of Cancer

disease in that year. Ninety percent of people who get lung cancer do so
because of cigarette smoking. Let me repeat that: 90 percent of lung cancer is
associated with cigarette smoking. This statistic makes lung cancer the most
preventable cancer of all.
The average age for lung cancer diagnosis is age 60. Sadly, after a patient’s
diagnosed with lung cancer, the prognosis is generally poor. Survival estimates
vary depending upon the type of lung cancer, but in general, only 20 percent
of people afflicted survive longer than one year after diagnosis. That’s the bad
news. The good news is that if you stop smoking at any age, your lungs heal,
and your risk of developing cancer goes down.
There are two main types of lung cancer, both of which are associated with
tobacco use.
 Small-cell lung cancers, which comprise roughly 25 percent of all lung
cancers, are the worst type. Named for the small, round cells that com-
prise these tumors, they’re invasive, highly prone to metastasis, and
very hard to treat.
 Non-small cell lung cancers are more amenable to treatment, especially
when diagnosed early.
Both types of lung cancer have similar primary symptoms: weight loss,
hoarseness, a cough that won’t go away, and difficulty breathing. Another
symptom that’s often overlooked is finger clubbing. Finger clubbing is a con-
dition in which the tips of the fingers get wider than normal. It’s a common
sign of lung disease and an indication that small blood vessels aren’t getting
enough oxygen.
Many mutations are associated with lung cancers. Both oncogenes and
tumor-suppressor genes are implicated. Almost all lung cancers involve
mutations of the p53 gene — the tumor-suppressor gene that controls, among
other things, programmed cell death. A ras oncogene, Kras, is frequently
mutated in certain kinds of lung cancers. Finally, large-scale deletions of chro-
mosomes, most often chromosome 3, are associated with virtually all small-
cell lung cancers (see the section “Demystifying chromosome abnormalities”
for more details).
Cancers of the mouth
The use of smokeless tobacco (snuff and chewing tobacco) is associated with
cancers of the mouth. Roughly 7,000 persons each year die of preventable
mouth cancers; men are twice as likely to get mouth cancer as women. Like
lung cancer, the prognosis for persons diagnosed with mouth cancer is poor.
Only slightly more than 50 percent of persons survive beyond five years after
diagnosis.
218
Part III: Genetics and Your Health 

The reason the prognosis for mouth cancer is so poor is that early stages of
the disease show no symptoms. Therefore, most people are unaware of the
problem until the disease is more advanced. Symptoms of mouth cancer
include sores on the gums, tongue, or the roof of the mouth that don’t heal;
lumps in the mouth; thickening of the cheek lining; and persistent mouth
pain. Regular dental care helps increase early detection, improving the
chance of survival.
Mutations associated with mouth cancers are often large-scale chromosome
abnormalities. Cells of the mouth appear especially vulnerable to mutational
losses of parts of chromosomes 3, 9, and 11 — all of which are recognized
fragile sites (similar to the one that causes Fragile X; see Chapter 15).
Oncogenes in the ras family and the p53 gene are also implicated in most
forms of mouth cancer.
Skin cancer
Each year, nearly 60,000 people in the United States are diagnosed with
melanoma, a form of skin cancer. Although the predisposition to skin cancer
is likely to be inherited, the number one risk factor for skin cancer is expo-
sure to ultraviolet light. Ultraviolet light sources include the sun and tanning
booths. People with pale skin, light-colored eyes (blue or green), and fair hair
are most vulnerable to ultraviolet light and thus skin cancer. If you burn
easily and don’t tan readily, you’re at higher risk. The best way to prevent
skin cancer is to stay out of the sun. If you must be exposed to the sun,
always use sunblock with an SPF (Sun Protection Factor) higher than 30.
Sunburn is strongly associated with the development of skin cancer at a later
time because radiation tends to cause double-strand DNA breaks and also
glues adjacent bases in the DNA together, forming spots called dimers (see
Chapter 13 for more details on these sorts of DNA damage). Damage to DNA
is often so great after severe sun exposure that large numbers of skin cells
die. Take a look at the section on tumor-suppressor genes earlier in this
chapter to find out about the process of “programmed cell suicide.” But
some damaged DNA may escape the repair or cell death process, yielding
dangerous mutations. Regular screening, the key to early detection of skin
cancer, is as simple as inspecting your skin using a mirror. Look closely at all
moles and freckles; asymmetrical, blotchy, or large (bigger than a pencil
eraser) growths should be pointed out to your physician.

Chromosome Disorders
In This Chapter
 Studying chromosomes to figure out numbers and sets
 Understanding how things go wrong with chromosomes
T
he study of chromosomes is, in part, the study of cells. Geneticists who
specialize in cytogenetics, the genetics of the cell, often examine chromo-
somes as the cell divides because that’s when the chromosomes are easiest
to see. Cell division is one of the most important activities that cells undergo;
it’s required for normal life, and a special sort of cell division prepares sex
cells for the job of reproduction. Chromosomes are copied and divvied up
during cell division, and getting the right number of chromosomes in each
cell as it divides is critical. Most chromosome disorders (such as Down syn-
drome) occur because of mistakes during meiosis (the cell division that
makes sex cells; see Chapter 2).
This chapter helps you understand how and why chromosome disorders
occur. You find out how geneticists study the chromosome content of cells.
Knowing chromosome numbers allows scientists to decode the mysteries of
inheritance, especially when the number of chromosomes (called ploidy) gets
complicated. Counting chromosomes also allows doctors to determine the
origin of physical abnormalities caused by the presence of too many or too
few chromosomes. If you skipped over Chapter 2, you may want to flip back
to it before reading this chapter to get a handle on the basics of chromosomes
and how cells divide.
Studying Chromosomes
A cytogeneticist counts chromosomes with the aid of microscopes and special
dyes to see the chromosomes during metaphase — the one time during the
cell cycle when the chromosomes take on the fat, easy-to-see, sausage shape.
(Jump back to Chapter 2 to review the cell cycle.) Here’s how the process of
examining chromosomes works.

1. A sample of cells is obtained. Almost any sort of dividing cell works as a
sample, including root cells from plants, blood cells, or skin cells.
2. The cells are cultured — given the proper nutrients and conditions for
growth — to stimulate cell division.
3. Some cells are removed from the culture and treated to stop mitosis
during metaphase.
4. Dyes are added to make the chromosomes easy to see.
5. The cells are inspected under a microscope. The chromosomes are
sorted, examined for obvious abnormalities, and counted.
This process of chromosome examination is called karyotyping. A karyotype
reveals exactly how many chromosomes are present in a cell along with some
details about the structure of the chromosomes. Scientists can only see these
details by staining the chromosomes with special dyes.
The word chromosome is Greek for “colored body” — so-called because the
chromosomes stain with dye so easily. Modern geneticists employ all kinds
of colored dyes depending on the chromosome aspect they’re studying.
Most of the chromosome pictures you see show the chromosomes as having
stripes; these stripes are the result of chromosome staining. Most chromo-
some studies for diagnosis of aneuploidy (missing or having extra chromo-
somes) use a method called G-banding. G-bands (named after the scientist
that developed the method, Gustav Giemsa) allow the geneticist to identify
each individual chromosome and permit the diagnosis of obvious, large-scale
deletions or abnormalities (such as fragile sites; see “Fragile X” later in this
chapter). Check out the chromosome karyotype in Chapter 2; it contains a
full set of human chromosomes stained to show the G-bands.
When examining a karyotype, the geneticist looks at each individual chromo-
some. Every chromosome has a typical size and shape; the location of the
centromere and the length of the chromosome arms (the parts on either side
of the centromere) are what define each chromosome’s physical appearance
(refer back to Chapter 2 to see what some chromosomes look like up close).
The chromosome arms are
 p arm: The shorter of the two arms (from the word petite, French for
“small”)
 q arm: The longer arm (because q follows p alphabetically)
In some disorders, one of the chromosome arms is misplaced or missing.
Therefore, geneticists often refer to the chromosome number along with
the letters p or q to communicate which part of the chromosome is affected.
222

Counting Up Chromosomes
Ploidy sounds like some bizarre, extraterrestrial science fiction creature, but
the word actually refers to the number of chromosomes a particular organism
has. Two sorts of “ploidys” are commonly bandied about in genetics:
 Aneuploid refers to an imbalance in the number of chromosomes.
Situations involving aneuploidy are often given the suffix -somy to com-
municate whether chromosomes are missing (monosomy) or extra
(trisomy).
 Euploid (and the related term, polyploid) refers to the number of sets of
chromosomes an organism has. Thus, diploid tells you that the organism
in question has two sets of chromosomes (often written as 2n, with n
being the haploid number of chromosomes in the set; see Chapter 2
for more on how chromosomes are counted up). When an organism is
euploid, its total number of chromosomes is an exact multiple of its
haploid number (n).
Aneuploidy: Extra or missing chromosomes
Shortly after Thomas Hunt Morgan discovered that certain traits are linked
to the X chromosome (see Chapter 5 for the full story), his student Calvin
Bridges discovered that chromosomes don’t always play by the rules. The
laws of Mendelian inheritance depend on the segregation of chromosomes —
an event that takes place during the first phase of meiosis (see Chapter 2 for
meiosis coverage). But sometimes chromosomes don’t segregate; two or
more copies of the same chromosome are sent to one gamete (sperm or egg),
leaving another gamete without a copy of one chromosome. Through his
study of fruit flies, Bridges discovered the phenomenon of nondisjunction, the
failure of chromosomes to segregate properly. Figure 15-1 shows nondisjunc-
tion at various stages of meiotic division. (For more on how Morgan and
Bridges made their discoveries, check out the sidebar “Flies!”)
While studying eye color in flies (flip back to Chapter 5 for more about this X-
linked trait), Bridges crossed white-eyed female flies with red-eyed males. He
expected to get all white-eyed sons and all red-eyed daughters from this sort
of monohybrid cross. (Chapter 3 explains monohybrid crosses.) But every so
often, he got red-eyed sons and white-eyed daughters. Bridges already knew
that females get two copies of the X chromosome and males get only one and
that eye color was linked with X. He also knew that eye color was a recessive
trait; the only way females could have white eyes was to have two copies of X
that both had the allele for white. So how could the odd combinations of sex
and eye color Bridges saw occur?
223
Chapter 15: Chromosome Disorders

Bridges realized that the X chromosomes of some of his female parent flies
must not be obeying the rules of segregation. During the first round of meio-
sis, the homologous pairs of chromosomes should separate. If that doesn’t
happen, some eggs get two copies of the mother’s X chromosome (see
Figure 15-1). In Bridges’ research, both copies of the mother’s X carried
the allele for white eyes. When a red-eyed male fertilized a two-X egg, two
results were possible, as you can see in Figure 15-2. An XXX zygote resulted
in a red-eyed daughter (which usually died). An XXY zygote turned out to be
a white-eyed female (check out Chapter 5 for how sex is determined in fruit
flies). Fertilized eggs that had no X chromosome resulted in a red-eyed male
(with genotype X). Eggs that didn’t get an X chromosome and receive a Y
from the father were never viable at all.

Flies!
Some of the greatest scientific discoveries have
been made in the humblest of settings. Take
Thomas Hunt Morgan’s laboratory, affection-
ately known as the Fly Room. The Fly Room was
a mere 368 square feet. It was crammed with
eight students, their desks, and hundreds of
glass milk bottles. Every milk bottle was full of
fruit flies, and large bunches of bananas hung
from the ceiling as food for the fruit flies. The
room reeked of rotting bananas, literally buzzed
with escapee flies, and had more than its fair
share of cockroaches. Yet from 1910 to 1930, this
cramped and unappetizing setting was home to
some of the most important scientific discover-
ies of its time, discoveries that still apply to the
understanding of genetics today.
Calvin Bridges and Alfred Sturtevant were both
undergraduates at Columbia University in New
York City in 1909. After hearing a lecture pre-
sented by Morgan, both Bridges and Sturtevant
landed desk space in the Fly Room. (An element
of luck was involved — Morgan’s talk in 1909
was the only opening lecture he gave for begin-
ning zoology students, ever.) Mendel’s work had
only just been rediscovered, so it was an exciting
time for genetics. Fruit flies made perfect study
organisms to test all the latest ideas, so the men
of the Fly Room (collaborator Nettie Stevens was
at the Carnegie Institution) spent hours dis-
cussing the latest publications and their own
research findings. After one such discussion,
Sturtevant rushed home to work up his latest
idea: a map of the genes on the X chromosome.
(He later admitted that he neglected his home-
work to pull off the feat!) Sturtevant’s chromo-
some map — still accurate to this day — was
created when he was just 20 years old and still
an undergraduate. Bridges, at the ripe old age of
24, went on to discover nondisjunction of fly
chromosomes — definitive proof that Morgan’s
theory of chromosomal inheritance was correct.
By the mid-1920s, the Fly Room’s heyday had
passed. In his 1965 work A History of Genetics,
Sturtevant is nostalgic not for the Fly Room itself
but for the flow of ideas it fostered, the “give-
and-take” of collaborative science. In the highly
competitive world of genetics today, ownership
of ideas can be an extremely contentious sub-
ject — friendships are sometimes destroyed
over the authorship of important scientific
papers. The atmosphere of the Fly Room, how-
ever, must have been an obvious exception and
a wonderful place to do research. If science
ever develops a time machine, put me down for
a trip to the Fly Room, say 1910 or so.

Many human chromosomal disorders arise from a sort of nondisjunction sim-
ilar to that of fruit flies. For more information on these human disorders, take
a look at the section “Chromosome Disorders” later in this chapter.

Euploidy: Numbers of chromosomes
Every species has a typical number of chromosomes revealed by its karyotype.
For example, humans have 46 total chromosomes (humans are diploid, 2n,
and n = 23). Your dog, if you have one, is also diploid and has 78 total chromo-
somes, and house cats have 2n = 38. Chromosome number isn’t very consis-
tent, even among very closely related organisms. For example, despite their
similar appearance, two species of Asian deer (called muntjacs) are both
diploid but have very different chromosome numbers: One species has 23
chromosomes, and the other has six.
Many organisms have more than two sets of chromosomes (a single set of
chromosomes referred to by the n is the haploid number) and are therefore
considered polyploid. Polyploidy is rare in animals but not unknown (salmon,
for example, have four sets of chromosomes). Plants, on the other hand, are
frequently polyploid. The reason that polyploidy is rare is sexual reproduc-
tion. Most animals reproduce sexually, meaning each individual produces
eggs or sperm that unite to form zygotes that grow into offspring. An equal
number of chromosomes must be allotted to each gamete for fertilization and
normal life processes to occur. When an individual, such as a plant, is poly-
ploidy (particularly odd numbers like 3n), most of its gametes wind up with
an unusual number of chromosomes. This imbalance in the number of chro-
mosomes results, functionally, in sterility (see the sidebar “Stubborn chromo-
somes” for more details).
Plants sometimes get around the problem of polyploidy (and its correspond-
ing sterility) through a process called apomixis. Part of meiosis, apomixis
results in an egg with a full complement of chromosomes. Eggs produced via
apomixis can form seeds without being fertilized and therefore can produce
new plants from seed. Dandelions, those hardy, persistent weeds known to all
gardeners, reproduce using apomixis. Dandelions have n = 8 chromosomes
which can come in sets of two (2n = 16), three (3n = 24), or four (4n = 32).
Many commercial plants are polyploid because plant breeders discover-
ed that polyploids often are much larger than their wild counterparts. 
Wild-strawberries, for instance, are diploid, tiny, and very tart. The large,
sweet strawberries you buy in the grocery store are actually octaploid,
meaning they have eight sets of chromosomes (that is, they’re 8n). Cotton
is tetraploid (4n), and coffee can have as many as eight sets of chromosomes,
while bananas are often triploid (3n). Many of these polyploids came about
naturally and, after being discovered by plant breeders, were cultivated from
cuttings (and other nonsexual plant propagation methods).
Not all polyploids are sterile. Those that result from crosses of two different
species (called hybridization) are often fertile. The chromosomes of hybrids
may have less trouble sorting themselves out during meiosis, allowing for
normal gamete formation to take place. One famous animal example of a
rarely fertile hybrid is a horse-donkey cross that results in a mule. Take
a look at the “Stubborn chromosomes” sidebar for more information.
226

Chromosome Disorders
Chromosomal abnormalities, in the form of aneuploidy (see “Aneuploidy:
Extra or missing chromosomes”), are very common among humans. Roughly
8 percent of all conceptions are aneuploid, and it’s estimated that up to half
of all miscarriages are due to some form of chromosome disorder. Sex chromo-
some disorders are the most commonly observed type of aneuploidy in humans
(flip to Chapter 5 for more on sex chromosomes) because X-chromosome
inactivation allows individuals with more than two X chromosomes to com-
pensate for the extra “doses” and survive the condition.
Four common categories of aneuploidy crop up in humans:
 Nullisomy: Occurs when a chromosome is missing altogether. Generally,
embryos that are nullisomic don’t survive to be born.
 Monosomy: Occurs when one chromosome lacks its homolog.
227
Chapter 15: Chromosome Disorders
Stubborn chromosomes
Horses are diploid and have 64 chromosomes.
Donkeys, which are also diploid, are closely
related to horses but have only 62 chromosomes.
When a horse mates with a donkey, the result is
a mule. These horse-donkey hybrids are larger
versions of horses and have big ears and a
famously stubborn disposition. Mules are highly
prized for their strength and reliable nature,
though — just ask any mule owner (or a cadet at
the U.S. Military Academy at West Point).
Mules are usually sterile because the ploidies
of horses and mules (or of donkeys and mules)
are a poor match. Genetically, mules have 32
horse chromosomes and 31 donkey chromo-
somes, giving them a total of 63 chromosomes
altogether and the odd chromosome number of
2n = 63 — that’s diploid but not euploid. When
meiosis takes place, the homologous chromo-
somes should pair up and then segregate.
During meiosis in mules, however, chromo-
somes often come together in groups of three,
five, or six. As a result, mule gametes don’t get
a full complement of chromosomes and aren’t
viable to be fertilized. So how can any mule be
a parent?
That’s what the owners of a mule named Krause
must have wondered in 1984 when she unex-
pectedly produced a foal, named Blue Moon
because of the rarity of mule parenthood.
Krause cohabitated with a male donkey, but
genetic analysis revealed that Blue Moon had a
mule genotype: 63 chromosomes that were half
horse and half donkey. Apparently, when
Krause’s cells underwent meiosis, her horse
chromosomes all segregated together. This is
an outrageously improbable outcome — on the
order of one in 4 billion! Even more amazingly,
Krause had a second foal with the same horse-
donkey genotype, meaning she produced a
second egg with all horse chromosomes.
The only other way a mule can be a “parent” is
via cloning, which I cover in Chapter 20. Idaho
Gem, the first mule clone, was born in 2003.

 Trisomy: Occurs when one extra copy of a chromosome is present.
 Tetrasomy: Occurs when four total copies of a chromosome are present.
Tetrasomy is extremely rare.
Most chromosome conditions are referred to by category of aneuploidy fol-
lowed by the number of the affected chromosome. For example, trisomy 13
means that three copies of chromosome 13 are present.
When chromosomes are left out
Monosomy (when one chromosome lacks its homolog) in humans is very rare.
The majority of embryos with monosomies don’t survive to be born. For live-
born infants, the only autosomal monosomy reported in humans is monosomy
21. Signs and symptoms of monosomy 21 are similar to those of Down syn-
drome (covered later in this section). Infants with monosomy 21 often have
numerous birth defects and rarely survive for longer than a few days or
weeks. The other monosomy commonly seen in children is monosomy of the
X chromosome. Children with this condition are always female and usually
lead normal lives. For more on monosomy X (also known as Turner syndrome),
see Chapter 5. Both monosomy 21 and monosomy 13 are the result of non-
disjunction during meiosis (see the section “Aneuploidy: Extra or missing
chromosomes” earlier in this chapter).
Many monosomies are partial losses of chromosomes, meaning that part
(or all) of the missing chromosome is attached to another chromosome.
Movements of parts of chromosomes to other, nonhomologous chromo-
somes are the result of translocations. Translocations are covered in more
detail in the section “Translocations,” later in this chapter.
Finally, monosomies can occur in cells as a result of mistakes that occur during
cell division (mitosis). Many of these monosomies are associated with chemi-
cal exposure and various sorts of cancers. Chapter 14 covers cell monosomies
and cancer in detail.
When too many chromosomes are left in
Trisomies (when one extra copy of a chromosome is present) are the most
common sorts of chromosomal abnormalities observed in humans. The
most common trisomy is Down syndrome, or trisomy 21. Other less common
trisomies include trisomy 18 (Edward syndrome), trisomy 13 (Patau syn-
drome), and trisomy 8. All these trisomies are usually the result of nondis-
junction during meiosis.
228

Down syndrome
Trisomy of chromosome 21, commonly called Down syndrome, affects between
1 in 600 to 1 in 800 infants. People with Down syndrome have some rather
stereotyped physical characteristics, including distinct facial features, altered
body shape, and short stature. Individuals with Down syndrome are usually
mentally retarded and often have heart defects. Nevertheless, they often lead
fulfilling and active lives well into adulthood.
One of the most striking features of Down syndrome (and trisomies, in gen-
eral) is the precipitous increase in the number of Down syndrome babies
born to mothers over 35 years of age (see Figure 15-3). Women between
the ages of 18 and 25 have a very low risk of having a baby with trisomy 21
(roughly 1 in 2,000). The risk increases slightly but steadily for women between
the ages of 25 and 35 (about 1 in 900 for women 30 years old) and then jumps
dramatically. By the time a woman is 40 years old, the probability of having
a child with Down syndrome is one in 100. By the age of 50, the probability
of conceiving a Down syndrome child is 1 in 12. Why does the risk of Down
syndrome increase in the children of older women?
The majority of Down syndrome cases seem to arise from nondisjunction
during meiosis. The reason behind this failure of chromosomes to segregate
normally in older women is unclear. In females, meiosis actually begins in the
fetus (flip back to Chapter 2 for a review of gametogenesis in humans). All
developing eggs go through the first round of prophase, including recombina-
tion. Meiosis in future egg cells then stops in a stage called diplotene, the
stage of crossing-over where homologous chromosomes are hooked together
and are in the process of exchanging parts of their DNA. Meiosis doesn’t start
back up again until a particular developing egg is going through the process

of ovulation. At that point, the egg completes the first round of meiosis and
then halts again. When sperm and egg unite, the nucleus of the egg cell fin-
ishes meiosis just before the nuclei of the sperm and egg fuse to complete
the process of fertilization. (In human males, meiosis begins in puberty, is
ongoing and continues without pauses like those that occur in females.)
Roughly 75 percent of the nondisjunctions responsible for Down syndrome
occur during the first phase of meiosis. Oddly, most of the chromosomes that
fail to segregate seem also to have failed to undergo crossing-over, suggesting
that the events leading up to nondisjunction begin early in life. Scientists
have proposed a number of explanations for the cause of nondisjunction
and its associated lack of crossing-over, but no agreement has been reached
about what actually happens in the cell to prevent the chromosomes from
segregating properly.
Every pregnancy is an independent genetic event. So although age is a factor
in calculating risk of trisomy 21, Down syndrome with previous pregnancies
doesn’t necessarily increase a woman’s risk of having another child affected
by the disorder.
Some environmental factors have been implicated in Down syndrome that
may increase the risk for younger women (less than 30 years of age).
Scientists think that women who smoke while on oral contraceptives (birth
control pills) may have a higher risk of decreased blood flow to their ovaries.
When egg cells are starved for oxygen, they’re less likely to develop normally,
and nondisjunction may be more likely to occur.
Familial Down syndrome
A second form of Down syndrome, Familial Down syndrome, is unrelated to
maternal age. This disorder occurs as a result of the fusion of chromosome
21 to another autosome (often chromosome 14). This fusion is usually the
result of a translocation, what happens when non-homologous chromosomes
exchange parts. In this case, the exchange involves the long arm of chromo-
some 21 and the short arm of chromosome 14. This sort of translocation is
called a Robertsonian translocation. The leftover parts of chromosomes 14
and 21 also fuse together but are usually lost to cell division and aren’t inher-
ited. When a Robertsonian translocation occurs, affected persons can end up
with several sorts of chromosome combinations in their gametes, as shown
in Figure 15-4.
For Familial Down syndrome, a translocation carrier has one normal copy of
chromosome 21, one normal copy of chromosome 14, and one fused transloca-
tion chromosome. Carriers aren’t affected by Down syndrome because their
fused chromosome acts as a second copy of the normal chromosome. When a
carrier’s cells undergo meiosis, some of their gametes have one translocated
chromosome or get the normal complement that includes one copy of each
chromosome. Fertilizations of gametes with a translocated chromosome
230
Part III: Genetics and Your Health 

produce the phenotype of Down syndrome. Roughly 10 percent of the liveborn
children of carriers have trisomy 21. Carriers have a greater chance than
normal of miscarriage due to monosomy (of either 21 or 14) and trisomy 14.
Other trisomies
Trisomy 18, also called Edward syndrome, also results from nondisjunction.
About 1 in 6,000 newborns has trisomy 18, making it the second most
common trisomy observed in humans. The disorder is characterized by
severe birth defects including severe heart defects and brain abnormalities.
Other defects associated with trisomy 18 include a small jaw relative to the
face, clenched fingers, rigid muscles, and foot defects. Most affected infants
with trisomy 18 don’t live past their first birthdays. Like trisomy 21, trisomy
18 is associated with women who become pregnant over 35 years of age.
The third most common trisomy in humans is trisomy 13, or Patau syndrome.
About 1 in 12,000 live births are affected by trisomy 13; many embryos with
this condition miscarry early in pregnancy. Babies born with trisomy 13 have
a very short life expectancy — most die before the age of 6 months. However,
some may survive until 2 or 3 years of age; records show that two children
with Patau syndrome lived well into childhood (one died at age 11 and the
other at age 19). Babies affected by trisomy 13 have extremely severe brain
defects along with many facial structure defects. Absent or very small eyes
and other defects of the eye, cleft lips, cleft palates, heart defects, and poly-
dactyly (extra fingers and toes) are common among these children.
Another type of trisomy, trisomy 8, occurs very rarely (1 in 25,000 to 50,000
births). Children born with trisomy 8 have a normal life expectancy but often
are affected by mental retardation and physical defects such as contracted
fingers and toes.

Chapter 15: Chromosome Disorders

Other things that go wrong 
with chromosomes
In addition to monosomies and trisomies, numerous other chromosomal dis-
orders can occur in humans. Whole sets of chromosomes can be added, or
chromosomes can be broken or rearranged. This section covers some of
these other sorts of chromosome disorders.
Polyploidy
Polyploidy, the occurrence of more than two sets of chromosomes, is ex-
tremely rare in humans. Two reported conditions of polyploidy are triploid
(three full chromosome sets) and tetraploid (four sets). Most polyploid preg-
nancies result in miscarriage or stillbirth. All liveborn infants with triploidy
have severe, untreatable birth defects, and most don’t survive longer than a
few days.
Mosaicism
Mosaicism is a form of aneuploidy that creates patches of cells with variable
numbers of chromosomes. Early in embryo development, a nondisjunction
similar to the one shown in Figure 15-1 can create two cells that are aneu-
ploid (most often one cell is trisomic, with one extra chromosome copy, and
the other monosomic, with a chromosome missing its homolog). A cell can
also lose a chromosome, leading to a monosomy without an accompanying
trisomy. All the cells that descend from the aneuploid cells created during
mitosis are also aneuploid. The magnitude of the effects of mosaicism
depends on when the error occurs: If the error happens very early, then
most of the individual’s cells are affected.
Most mosaicisms are lethal except when the mosaic cell line is confined to the
placenta. Many embryos with placenta mosaics develop normally and suffer no
ill effects. Sex chromosome mosaics are the most common in humans; XO-XXX
and XO-XXY are common mosaic genotypes. Trisomy 21 also appears as a
mosaic with normal diploid cells. In general, individuals with mosaicism are
affected in the same ways as persons who are entirely aneuploid.
Fragile X
Many chromosomes have fragile sites, parts of the chromosome that show
breaks when the cells are exposed to certain drugs or chemicals. Eighty such
fragile sites are common to all humans, but other sites appear due to rare
mutations. One such site, Fragile X on the X chromosome, causes the most
common inherited form of mental retardation.
232
Part III: Genetics and Your Health 

Fragile X results from a mutation in a gene called FMR1 (for Fragile Mental
Retardation gene 1). Like many X-linked mutations, Fragile X is recessive.
Therefore, women are usually mutation carriers, and men are most often
affected by the disorder. Males with Fragile X usually have some form of
mental retardation that can vary in severity from mild behavioral or learning
disabilities all the way to severe intellectual disabilities and autism. Men and
boys with Fragile X often have prominent ears and long faces with large jaws.
Fragile X often shows genetic anticipation — that is, the disorder gets more
severe from one generation to the next. Within FMR1, there is a series of three
bases that are repeated over and over (see Chapter 6 for details about how
DNA is put together). When the DNA’s replicated (or copied; see Chapter 7),
it’s easy for repeats to be added by mistake, making the repeat sequence
longer. In persons with Fragile X, the three bases can be repeated hundreds of
times (instead of the normal 60). As the gene gets longer, the effects of the
mutation become more severe, with subsequent offspring suffering stronger
effects of the disorder. You can find out more about anticipation in Chapter 4.
Rearrangements
Large-scale chromosome changes are called chromosomal rearrangements. Four
kinds of chromosomal rearrangements, shown in Figure 15-5, are possible:
 Duplication: Large parts of the chromosome are copied more than once,
making the chromosome substantially longer.
 Inversion: A section of the chromosome gets turned around, reversing
the sequence of genes.
 Deletion: Large parts of the chromosome are lost.
 Translocation: Parts are exchanged between non-homologous
chromosomes.

Chapter 15: Chromosome Disorders

All chromosomal rearrangements are mutations. Normally, mutations are
very small changes within the DNA (that often have very big impacts).
Mutations that involve only a few bases can’t be detected by staining the
chromosomes and examining the karyotype (see “Studying Chromosomes”
for more on karyotypes). However, large-scale chromosomal changes can be
diagnosed from the karyotype because they involve huge sections of the
DNA. In humans, deletions and duplications are common causes of mental
retardation and physical defects.
Duplications
Duplications (in this case, large unwanted copies of portions of the chromo-
some) most often arise from unequal crossing-over (see “Deletions” later in
this chapter). Most disorders arising from duplications are considered partial
trisomies because large portions of one chromosome are usually present in
triplicate.
Duplication of part of chromosome 15 is implicated in one form of autism.
Autistic persons typically have severe speech impairment, don’t readily inter-
act or respond to other persons, and exhibit ritualized and repetitive behav-
iors. Mental retardation may or may not be present. Persons with autism are
difficult to assess because of their impaired ability to communicate. Other
chromosomal rearrangements, including large-scale deletions and transloca-
tions, have also been identified in cases of autism.
Inversions
If a chromosome break occurs, sometimes DNA repair mechanisms (explained
in Chapter 13) can repair the strands. If two breaks occur, part of the chromo-
some may be reversed before the breaks are repaired. When a large part of
the chromosome is reversed and the order of the genes is changed, the event
is called an inversion. When inversions involve the centromere, they’re called
pericentric; inversions that don’t include the centromere are called paracentric.
Hemophilia type A may be due, in some cases, to an inversion within the X
chromosome. Patients with hemophilia have impaired blood clot formation;
as a result, they bruise easily and bleed freely from even very small cuts. Very
mild injuries can result in extremely severe blood loss. Like most X-linked dis-
orders, hemophilia is more common in males than females. In this case, two
genes coding for the clotting factors are interrupted by the inversion, render-
ing both genes nonfunctional.
Deletions
Deletion, or loss, of a large section of a chromosome usually occurs in one of
two ways.
234
Part III: Genetics and Your Health 

 The chromosome breaks during interphase of the cell cycle (see
Chapter 2 for cell cycle details), and the broken piece is lost when
the cell divides.
 Parts of chromosomes are lost due to unequal crossing-over during
meiosis.
Normally, when chromosomes start meiosis, they evenly align end to end
with no overhanging parts. If chromosomes align incorrectly, crossing-over
can create a deletion in one chromosome and an insertion of extra DNA in the
other, as shown in Figure 15-6. Unequal crossover events are more likely to
occur where many repeats are present in the DNA sequence (see Chapter 11
for more on DNA sequences).
Cri-du-chat syndrome is a deletion disorder caused by the loss of the short
arm of chromosome 5 (varying amounts of chromosome 5 can be lost, up to
60 percent of the arm). Cri-du-chat is French for “cry of the cat” and refers to
the characteristic mewing sound that infants affected by the syndrome make.
Cri-du-chat acts as an autosomal dominant; affected persons are almost
always heterozygous for the mutation. Children with Cri-du-chat have unusu-
ally small heads, round faces, wide-set eyes, and intellectual disabilities. Cri-
du-chat is one of the most common chromosomal rearrangement deletions
and occurs in about 1 in 20,000 births. Most persons with Cri-du-chat don’t
survive into adulthood. Because the majority of these deletions are new
mutations, there’s usually no family history of Cri-du-chat.
Deletion of part of the long arm of chromosome 15 results in Prader-Willi syn-
drome. This particular deletion is almost always in the father’s chromosome,
and the tendency to pass on the deletion appears to be heritable. Women
with pregnancies affected by Prader-Willi usually notice that their babies
start moving in the womb later and move less than unaffected babies. Affected
infants are less active and have decreased muscle tone, which sometimes
causes breathing problems. These infants have trouble feeding and usually

don’t grow at a normal rate. Children with Prader-Willi syndrome are men-
tally retarded, but their intellectual disabilities usually aren’t very severe.
Feeding problems early in life often give way to obesity later on, but
persons with Prader-Willi are almost always of unusually small stature.
Like Cri-du-chat, Prader-Willi is often the result of spontaneous mutation
but can be inherited as an autosomal dominant disorder (see Chapter 12
for more on genetic disorders).
Translocations
Translocations involve the exchange of large portions of chromosomes. They
occur between nonhomologous chromosomes and come in two types:
 Reciprocal translocation: An equal (balanced) exchange in which each
chromosome winds up with part of the other. This is the most common
form of translocation.
 Nonreciprocal translocation: An uneven exchange in which one chro-
mosome gains a section but the other chromosome does not, resulting
in a deletion.
Like inversions, translocations can result from broken chromosomes that get
mismatched before the repair process is complete. When two chromosomes
are broken, they can exchange pieces (reciprocal or balanced translocation),
gain pieces (nonreciprocal translocation), or lose pieces (deletion). When the
breaks interrupt one or more genes, those genes are rendered nonfunctional.
One disorder in humans that sometimes involves a balanced translocation
event is bipolar disorder. Bipolar disorder may result when chromosomes 9
and 11 exchange parts, interrupting a gene on chromosome 11. This gene,
called DIBD 1 (for Disrupted in Bipolar Disorder gene 1) has also been impli-
cated in other psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia.
Chromosomes 11 and 22 are often involved in balanced translocation events
that cause birth defects (such as cleft palate, heart defects, and mental
retardation) and a hereditary form of breast cancer. Chromosome 11 seems
particularly prone to breakage in an area of the chromosome with many
repeated sequences (where two bases, A and T, are repeated many times
sequentially). Most repeated sequences like this one are considered junk
DNA (see Chapter 11 for an explanation of junk DNA). Because both chromo-
some 11 and chromosome 22 contain similar repeat sequences, the repeats
may allow crossover events to occur by mistake, resulting in balanced
translocations.
In many cases, a translocation event occurs spontaneously in one parent,
who then passes the disrupted chromosomes on to his or her offspring,
resulting in partial trisomies and partial deletions. In these cases, the carrier
parents may be unaffected by the disorder.

In This Chapter
 Delivering healthy genes to treat or cure disease
 Finding the genes needed for gene therapy
 Charting progress on the road to gene cures
T
he completion of the Human Genome Project in 2004, along with the
sequencing of nonhuman genomes, has spawned an incredible revolution
in the understanding of genetics. Simultaneously, geneticists have raced to
develop medicines to treat and cure diseases caused by genes gone awry.
Gene therapy, treatment that gets at the direct cause of genetic disorders,
is sometimes touted as the magic bullet, the cure-all for inherited diseases
(see Chapter 13 for a partial list) and cancer (see Chapter 14). Gene therapy
may even provide a way to block the genes of pathogens such as the virus
that causes AIDS, providing reliable treatments for illnesses that currently
have none.
Unfortunately, the shining promise of gene therapy has been hampered by a
host of factors including finding the right way to supply the medicine to
patients without causing new or worse problems than the ones being treated.
In this chapter, you examine the progress and perils of gene therapy.
Curing Genetic Disease
Take a glance back through Part III of this book for proof that your health and
genetics are inextricably linked. Not only do mutations cause disorders that
are passed from generation to generation, but mutations acquired during
your lifetime can have unwanted consequences such as cancer. And your
own genes aren’t the only ones that cause complications — the genes carried
by bacteria, parasites, and viruses lend a hand in spreading disease and
dismay worldwide.
So wouldn’t it be great if you could just turn those pesky bad genes off? Just
think: A mutation causes a loss of function in a tumor suppressor gene, and
you get a shot to turn that gene back on. A virus giving you trouble? Just take

a pill that blocks the function of viral genes. Some geneticists see the imple-
mentation of these genetic solutions to health problems as only a matter of
time. Therefore, the development of gene therapy has focused on two major
courses of action:
 Supplying genes to provide desired functions that have been lost or are
missing
 Blocking genes from producing unwanted products
Finding Vehicles to Get Genes to Work
The first step in successful gene therapy is designing the right delivery sys-
tem to introduce a new gene or shut down an unwanted one. The delivery
system for gene therapy is called a vector. A perfect vector
 Must be innocuous so that the recipient’s immune system doesn’t reject
or fight the vector.
 Must be easy to manufacture in large quantities. Just one treatment may
require over 10 billion copies of the vector because you need one deliv-
ery vehicle for each and every cell in the affected organ.
 Must be targeted for a specific tissue. Gene expression is tissue-specific
(see Chapter 10 for details), so the vector has to be tissue-specific, too.
 Must be capable of integrating its genetic payload into each cell of the
target organ so that new copies of each cell generated later on by mito-
sis contain the gene therapy payload.
Currently, viruses are the favored vector. Most gene therapies aim to put a
new gene into the patient’s genome, so it’s pretty easy to understand why
viruses are appealing candidates for vectorhood — this gene-sharing action
is almost precisely what viruses do naturally.
When a virus latches onto a cell that isn’t somehow protected from the virus,
the virus hijacks all that cell’s activities for the sole purpose of making more
viruses. Viruses reproduce this way because they aren’t really alive and have
no moving parts of their own to accomplish reproduction. Part of the virus’s
attack strategy involves integrating virus DNA into the host genome in order
to execute viral gene expression. The problem is that when a virus is good at
attacking a cell, it causes an infection that the patient’s immune system
fights. So the trick to using a virus as a vector is taming it.
Gentling a virus for use as a vector usually involves deleting most of its genes.
These deletions effectively rob the virus of almost all its own DNA, leaving only
a few bits. These remaining pieces are primarily the parts normally used by the
virus for getting its DNA into the host. Using DNA manipulation techniques like
238
Part III: Genetics and Your Health 

those described in the “Inserting Healthy Genes into the Picture” section of this
chapter, the scientist splices a healthy gene sequence into the virus to replace
the deleted parts of the viral genome. Like the delivery truck drivers that bring
packages to your doorstep, a helper is needed to move the payload from the
virus to the recipient cell. The scientist sets up another virus particle with
some of the deleted genes from the vector. This second virus, called a helper,
makes sure that the vector DNA replicates properly.
Geneticists conducting gene therapy have several viruses to choose from as
possible delivery vehicles (vectors). These viruses fall into one of two classes:
 Those that integrate their DNA directly into the host’s genome
 Those that climb into the cell nucleus to become permanent but sepa-
rate residents (called episomes)
Within these two categories, three types of viruses — oncoretroviruses,
lentiviruses, and adenoviruses — are popular choices for gene therapy.
Viruses that join right in
Two popular viruses for gene therapy integrate their DNA directly into the
host’s genome. Oncoretroviruses and lentiviruses are retroviruses that transfer
their genes into the host genome; when the retrovirus genes are in place,
they’re replicated right along with all the other host DNA. Retroviruses use
RNA instead of DNA to code their genes; these viruses use a process called
reverse transcription (described in Chapter 10) to convert their RNA into
DNA, which is then inserted into a host cell’s genome.
Oncoretroviruses, the first vectors developed for gene therapy, get their name
from oncogenes, which turn the cell cycle permanently on — one of the precur-
sors to development of full-blown cancer. Most of the oncoretrovirus vectors in
use for gene therapy trace their history back to a virus that causes leukemia in
monkeys (it’s called Moloney murine leukemia virus, or MLV). MLV has proven
an effective vector, but it’s not without problems; MLV’s propensity to cause
cancer has been difficult to keep in check. Oncoretroviruses work well as vec-
tors only if they’re used to treat cells that are actively dividing.
Lentiviruses, on the other hand, can be used to treat cells that aren’t divid-
ing. You’re probably already familiar with a famous lentivirus: HIV. Vectors for
gene therapy were developed directly from the HIV virus itself. Although the
gutted virus vectors contain only 5 percent of their original DNA, rendering
them harmless, lentiviruses have the potential to regain the deleted genes if
they come in contact with untamed HIV virus particles (that is, the ones that
infect people with AIDS). Lentiviruses are also a bit dicey because they tend
to put genes right in the middle of host genes, leading to loss-of-function
mutations (this and other mutations are detailed in Chapter 13). Nonetheless,
239
Chapter 16: No Couch Needed: Gene Therapy

HIV lentivirus vectors are used to combat AIDS. The vector virus carries a
genetic message that gets stored in the patient’s immune cells. When HIV
attacks these immune cells, the vector DNA blocks the attacking virus from
replicating itself, effectively protecting the patient from further infection. So
far, this treatment seems to work and substantially reduces the amount of
virus carried by affected persons.
Viruses that are a little standoffish
Adenoviruses are excellent vectors because they pop their genes into cells
regardless of whether cell division is occurring. Adenoviruses have been both
promising and problematic. On the one hand, these viruses are really good at
getting into host cells. On the other hand, adenoviruses tend to excite a strong
immune response — the patient’s body senses the virus as a foreign particle
and fights it. To combat the immune reaction, researchers have worked to
delete the genes that make adenoviruses easy for the host to recognize.
Adenoviruses don’t put their DNA directly into the host genome. Instead,
they exist separately as episomes, so they aren’t as likely to cause mutations
as lentiviruses. The drawback is that the episomes aren’t always replicated
and passed on to daughter cells when the host cell divides. Nonetheless,
adenovirus vectors have been used with notable success — and failure. (See
“Making Slow Progress on the Gene Therapy Front” at the end of the chapter
for the details.)
Inserting Healthy Genes into the Picture
Finding the right delivery system is a necessary step in mastering gene ther-
apy, but to nab genes and put them to work as therapists, geneticists must
also find the right ones. Because finding healthy genes isn’t simple, gene
mapping is still a major obstacle in the road to implementing gene therapy.
Imagine you’re handed a man’s photograph and told to find him in New York
City — no name, no address, no phone number. The task of finding that man
includes figuring out his identity (maybe by finding out who his friends are),
figuring out what he does for a living, narrowing your search to the borough
he lives in, and identifying his street, block, and, finally, his address. This
wild-goose chase is almost exactly like the gargantuan task of finding genes.
Your DNA has roughly 25,000 genes tucked away amongst around 3 billion
base pairs of DNA. (Flip back to Chapter 6 for how DNA is sized up in base
pairs.) Because most genes are pretty small, relatively speaking (often less
than 5,000 base pairs long; see Chapter 8), finding just one gene in the midst of
240
Part III: Genetics and Your Health 

all the genetic clutter may sound like a nearly impossible task. Until recently,
the only tool geneticists had in the search for genes was the observation of
patterns of inheritance (like those shown in Chapter 12) and the subsequent
comparisons of how various groups of traits were inherited. This method,
called linkage analysis, is used to construct gene maps (see Chapter 4).
With the advent of DNA sequencing (see Chapter 11), however, the search
for names and addresses of genes has reached a whole new level (but the
search still isn’t over; see the sidebar “The role of the Human Genome
Project”). Now, geneticists hook up with a giant network of people to nail
down the exact locations of genes:
1. Physicians identify a disorder by observing a phenotype caused by
mutation. Essentially, this is the face of the gene.
2. Genetic counselors work with patients and their families to gather com-
plete medical histories (see Chapter 12). Analysis of family trees may
uncover other traits that associate with the disorder.
3. Cell biologists look at the karyotypes of many affected people and link
traits to obvious chromosomal abnormalities. These large-scale changes
in chromosomes often provide hints about where genes reside. (Chapter
15 examines methods of karyotyping.)
4. Population geneticists analyze the DNA of large groups of people with
and without the disease to narrow down which chromosomes and which
genes are involved with the disease.
5. Biochemists study the chemical processes in the affected organs of
people with the disease to identify the physiology of the disorder. Often,
they’re able to nab the precise protein-gone-wrong.
6. With the protein in hand, geneticists use the genetic code (profiled in
Chapter 9) to work backwards from the building blocks of that protein,
the specific amino acids, to discern what the mRNA instructions were.
Identifying the right protein and backtracking to the mRNA pattern is extremely
helpful, but it still doesn’t divulge the identity of the gene. (Problems include
the fact that mRNAs are often heavily edited before they’re translated into
proteins [see Chapter 9] and the fact that the code is degenerate, meaning
that more than one codon can be used to get a particular amino acid). The
protein provides a general idea of what the gene address is, but it’s not precise
enough. To close in on the right address, the gene hunter has to sort through
the DNA itself.
The entire gene-hunting safari depends on vast computer databases that are
easily accessed by the entire scientific community. These databases allow
investigators to search professional journals to keep up with new discoveries
by other scientists. Researchers are also constantly adding new pieces of the
puzzle, such as newly identified proteins, to storehouses of data. You can take
241
Chapter 16: No Couch Needed: Gene Therapy

a peek into the genetic data warehouse by visiting www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
entrez/query.fcgi?db=OMIM. The NCBI link in the upper left part of the
page leads you to the homepage of the National Center of Biotechnology
Information. From there, you can explore anything from DNA to protein data
compiled by scientists from around the world.
Recombinant DNA technology is the catchall phrase that covers most of the
methods geneticists use to examine DNA in the lab. The word recombinant is
used because DNA from the organism being studied is often popped into a
virus or bacteria (that is, it’s recombined with DNA from a different source)
to allow further study. Recombinant DNA is also used for a vast number of
other applications, including creating genetically engineered organisms (see
Chapter 19) and cloning (see Chapter 20). In the case of gene therapy, recom-
binant DNA is used to
 Locate the gene (or genes) that’s involved in a particular disorder or
disease.
 Cut the desired gene out of the surrounding DNA.
 Pop the gene into a vector (delivery vehicle) for transfer into the cells
where treatment is needed.
242
Part III: Genetics and Your Health 
The role of the Human Genome Project
Can’t geneticists just look up the genes they
need from all the sequencing data collected by
the Human Genome Project, or HGP? Someday
the answer will be yes, but we’re not there yet.
By 2005, 99 percent of the gene-rich part of the
genome (called the euchromatin) is fully
sequenced. That’s the good news. The bad
news for gene hunters is that a whopping 20
percent of the noncoding regions of the genome
still aren’t sequenced.
The noncoding part of the genome that’s mostly
junk DNA (the heterochromatin) has been tough
to work with because it’s made up of repetitive
sequences. All that repetition makes putting the
sequences into their proper order extremely dif-
ficult. Some scientists think it may be another five
years before the Human Genome Project is truly
complete in the sense that the entire sequence
of the whole human genome is known. Even a
complete HGP leaves much left to learn; for
example, researchers still don’t know how many
total genes there are (probably around 25,000 but
possibly more or fewer). And many genes are yet
to be discovered; what they control and where
they’re located are still unknown.
Unfortunately, the maps constructed by the HGP
of the entire humane genome are drawn at the
wrong scale to be useful for pinpointing the
locations of genes. To get an idea of how scale
can be a problem, think about looking at a road
map. A low-resolution highway map can help
you find your way from one city to another, but
it can’t guide you to a very specific street
address in a particular city.
What it comes down to is that geneticists have
only just started to explore the billions of base
pairs that contain the genetic instructions that
make humans tick. That’s why the gene hunt is
likely to go on for a long time to come. (For full
coverage of the HGP, flip to Chapter 11.)

Checking out a DNA library
One of the most popular methods for tracking down a specific gene is creating
a DNA library. That’s just what it sounds like: a library filled with chunks of
DNA instead of books. Geneticists can paw through the library to nail down
the piece of DNA containing the gene of interest. One popular version of
the genetic library method is called a cDNA library — a collection of genetic
instruction manuals that are actually in use in a specific cell (the c stands for
complementary because the whole process actually starts by copying mRNA
messages into complementary DNA format).
The idea behind a cDNA library is to harvest all the mRNAs found in a cell
that’s involved in some genetic disease (you can find out more about RNA in
Chapter 8). Because gene expression is tissue-specific (see Chapter 10), the
mRNAs in any given cell represent only the genes that are at work there. So
instead of plowing through all 25,000 genes of the human genome to find the
one that’s in trouble, geneticists can narrow the target to only the few hun-
dred that are found in a particular cell.
Harvesting and converting mRNA
The first step in creating a cDNA library is harvesting mRNAs, and the fastest
way to nab mRNAs is to grab their tails. When an mRNA is getting dressed for
its trip out of the nucleus and into the cytoplasm for translation, a long string
of adenine ribonucleotides gets hitched on the mRNA’s back. This string,
called a poly-A tail, helps protect the mRNA from decomposing before it fin-
ishes its job. To find the mRNAs being produced by a cell’s genes, geneticists
use chemicals to break open cells, and then they strain out the mRNAs by
exposing their tails to long strings of thymine nucleotides. The As (adenines)
in the tails naturally hook up with the complementary Ts (thymines) because
of the bases’ natural affinities for each other.
Undergoing reverse transcription
After scientists harvest the mRNAs of a cell, they convert the mRNAs’ mes-
sages back to DNA by reversing the process of transcription. Reverse tran-
scription works a lot like DNA replication (see Chapter 7). The primer used
for reverse transcription is a long string of Ts (thymines) complementary to
the mRNA’s poly-A tail. A special enzyme called reverse transcriptase, which
is isolated from a virus, tacks dNTPs onto the primer to create a DNA copy
of the mRNA.
After the DNA copy of the mRNA is made, the order of the bases — the As, Gs,
Cs, and Ts — on the 5’ end of the DNA sequence is determined (flip back to
Chapter 6 for how DNA’s ends are numbered) using DNA sequencing (see Chap-
ter 11). This partial DNA sequence (about 500 bases or so) is referred to as an
expressed sequence tag (EST). It’s expressed because only the exons are pre-
sent in the DNA sequence, and tag comes from the fact that only part of the
entire gene sequence is obtained (and therefore “tagged”).
243
Chapter 16: No Couch Needed: Gene Therapy

Screening the library
With ESTs created (see the preceding section), gene hunters examine every
“book” in the cDNA library to find the particular gene that causes the disease.
This process is called screening the library. The idea here is to spread out all
the ESTs and sort through them to find the precise EST that came from the gene
scientists are looking for. The difficulty of screening the library depends on
what’s already known about the gene. For example, knowing what the protein-
gone-wrong is can provide enough genetic information to give scientists a
head start in their search. Sometimes, geneticists even look at what’s known
about genes with similar functions in other organisms and start there.
Regardless of the clues available to the gene hunter, screening involves
making thousands of identical copies, or clones, of each EST by popping it
into a bacteria or virus. Because ESTs are so tiny (DNA-wise), it’s impossible
to manipulate only one copy at a time. The cloning process separates the
ESTs into neat little identical stacks, each composed of thousands of copies
of only one EST.
One method used to clone ESTs is called bacteriophage cloning. Bacteriophages
(phages, for short) are handy little viruses that make a living by injecting their
DNA directly into bacterial cells.
To infect bacterial cells, the bacteriophages hop onto the outer cell wall and
inject their DNA into the bacterium, where the phage DNA integrates directly
into the bacterium’s own DNA. The viral genes get replicated, transcribed, and
ultimately translated using the machinery of the bacterial cells. Eventually, the
phage genes set off a new phase that breaks up the bacterial DNA and frees the
phage genome. The phage DNA gets replicated many times within the bacterial
cells, and new phage protein shells are also produced. The bacterial cells even-
tually burst open, freeing the newly completed phages to infect other cells.
Here’s how these funky-looking viruses get harnessed to make copies of ESTs:
1. Geneticists take a mixture of ESTs and splice them into the DNA of thou-
sands of bacteriophages.
To splice the ESTs into the phages, the phage DNA (which is circular)
is cut open using a restriction enzyme. Restriction enzymes cut DNA at
sites called palindromes, where the complementary sequence of bases
reads the same way backwards and forwards (like 5’-GATC-3’ whose com-
plement is 3’-CTAG-5’). The restriction enzyme always cuts between the
same two bases, like between the G and the A, on both strands. When
pulled apart, the resulting pair of cuts leave overhanging, single-stranded
ends on one long piece of phage DNA. The ESTs are treated with enzymes
to give them sticky ends, overhanging bits complementary to the ends left
in the phage DNA. When mixed together, the phage DNA and the ESTs
match their sticky ends together, completing the circle of phage DNA
except that each copy of the phage now contains an EST along with its
own DNA.
244
Part III: Genetics and Your Health 

2. The EST-carrying phages are mixed with their favorite victims, bacteria,
and poured into Petri dishes.
3. After the viruses spread out and do their jobs (about 24 hours after the
mixing with bacteria), the result is little pits in an otherwise uniform
layer of bacteria growing in the Petri dish. Each little pit, called a plaque,
represents infection caused by one phage that’s reproduced and, by a
chain reaction of infections, caused many bacterial cells to die and pop
open. Each individual infection site represents many thousands of
copies of one EST.
With thousands of ESTs and their copies, the only task that remains is finding
the EST that’s associated with the gene being hunted. Using the protein-gone-
wrong as a guide, scientists can make a guess at what the EST may look like.
After they decide what kind of DNA sequence may complement the EST, they
order a special kit of DNA, called a probe, custom-made to match the sequence
they want. A probe is complementary to all or part of the EST in question, and
it’s marked with dye so scientists can find it after it bonds with the EST. Each
EST is treated to make it single-stranded, and the ESTs are exposed to the
probe. The probe forms a double-stranded molecule only with the EST that it
matches; the matched set is found with special equipment that allows the dye
to glow brightly.
Scientists can also use an EST to search among chromosomes to nail down
the general location of a gene. The geneticist makes a karyotype — a collection
of all the chromosomes that can be examined under the microscope (see
Chapter 15). The chromosomes are treated to allow the fluorescent-dyed EST
to bind with its complement on the intact chromosomes. The dyed EST sticks
to the nontemplate strand from which its mRNA counterpart came. Scientists
can see the results of this process with the help of a special microscope: The
region where the EST attaches to its complement (the attachment process is
referred to as hybridization) reflects brightly under ultraviolet light. This entire
procedure, called fluorescent in situ hybridization (or FISH, for short) allows
researchers to target a region of a particular chromosome for their gene hunt
but isn’t very specific because of the way DNA is packaged (see Chapter 6). In
essence, FISH narrows the target to a few million base pairs for scrutiny. But
this isn’t the last piece of the puzzle: With only part of the address (provided
by the right EST) and the street name (the chromosome), gene hunters need
to make a high-resolution map to complete their search successfully.
Mapping the gene
Thanks to the progress of the Human Genome Project, scientists have maps
for each of the chromosomes, and each map has many landmarks, called
STSs for sequence tagged sites. Sequence tagged sites are short stretches of
unique combinations of bases scattered around the chromosome. No two
STSs are alike, so they provide unique landmarks wherever they occur. A
complete STS map reveals the total distance from one end of the chromosome
245
Chapter 16: No Couch Needed: Gene Therapy

to the other (in base pairs) along with the landmarks along the way. An STS
map is a bit like knowing the locations of Times Square, the Empire State
Building, and Central Park relative to the entire island of Manhattan. You may
know that a street you’re looking for is between Central Park and the Empire
State Building, but there are hundreds of little blocks to choose from in an
area that size. STSs and other landmarks in the genome are a lot like that —
scientists may know that an EST is between two STSs, but the STSs them-
selves may be 20,000 bases apart!
Using the EST nabbed as a starting point, geneticists sequence the DNA of
the chromosome in both directions in a process called chromosome walking.
Basically, they have to compile enough sequence information to run across at
least two STS landmarks on the map, one in each direction. To continue with
the city analogy, chromosome walking is like laying maps of neighborhoods
together end to end until two major landmarks are connected. Chromosome
walking provides the last two vital pieces in the puzzle: the exact location of
the gene relative to the rest of the chromosome and (finally!) the entire gene
sequence associated with the EST.
With the completion of the Human Genome Project, mapping genes is getting
easier and easier. Scientists can take their own EST sequence information and
check the database to see if their sequence falls out on a preexisting map.
Chromosome walking is still necessary to get the precise location of the gene
relative to everything around it, however.
After a gene is precisely mapped, the gene sequences of many people (both
with and without the disease) are compared to determine exactly what the
mutation is (that is, how the gene differs between affected and unaffected
people). (All this information eventually winds up in the database Mendelian
Inheritance in Man; see Chapter 24 to get a peek.)
After the gene’s located, many thousands of precise replicas of a healthier
version of the gene can be made through a polymerase chain reaction, the
process used for DNA fingerprinting (see Chapter 18). The copies of the
healthy gene are popped into the vector used for gene therapy with the same
methods that were used to make the cDNA library described here.
Making Slow Progress on
the Gene Therapy Front
As the Human Genome Project started fulfilling the dreams of geneticists
worldwide, realizing gene therapy’s promises seemed very much in reach. In
fact, the first trials conducted in 1990 were a resounding success.
246
Part III: Genetics and Your Health 

In those first attempts at gene therapy, two patients suffering from the same
immunodeficiency disorder received infusions of cells carrying genes coding
for their missing enzymes. The disorder being treated was a form of Severe
Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID); this particular brand of SCID results
from the loss of one enzyme: adenosine deaminase (ADA). SCID is so severe
that affected persons must live in completely sterilized environments with no
contact to the outside world because even the slightest infection is likely to
prove deadly. Because only one gene is involved, SCID is a natural candidate
for treatment with gene therapy. Retroviruses armed with a healthy ADA gene
were infused into the two affected children with dramatic results: Both chil-
dren were essentially cured of the disease and now lead normal lives.
The greatest success of gene therapy thus far, however, may ultimately be a
failure as well. At least 15 children (as of October 2004) have been treated for
an X-linked version of SCID. These children also received a retrovirus loaded
with a healthy gene and were apparently cured. However, three of the children
have since been diagnosed with a cancer of the blood, leukemia. The virus that
delivered the gene also plopped its DNA right into a proto-oncogene, switching
it on (flip back to Chapter 14 for more about the actions of oncogenes).
The most famous failure of gene therapy occurred in 1999 when 18-year-old
Jesse Gelsinger volunteered for a study aimed at curing a genetic disorder
called ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency. With this disorder, Jesse
occasionally suffered a huge buildup of ammonia in his body because his liver
lacked enough of the OTC enzyme to keep up with processing all the nitrogen
waste products in his blood. Jesse’s disease was controlled medically — with
drugs and diet — but other affected children often die of the disease. Jesse
volunteered to help test a newly developed gene therapy aimed at curing
the disorder. Researchers used an adenovirus to deliver a normal OTC gene
directly into Jesse’s liver. (See “Viruses that are a little standoffish” for the
scoop on adenoviruses.) The virus escaped into Jesse’s bloodstream and
accumulated in his other organs. His body went into high gear to fight what
seemed like a massive infection, and four days after receiving the treatment
that was meant to cure him, Jesse died. Oddly, another volunteer in the same
experimental trial received the same dose of virus that Jesse did and suffered
no ill effects at all.
Despite these setbacks, experimental trials for gene therapies continue. (Most
are focused on cancers.) Although they’re unruly, viruses still seem to be the
best delivery trucks to cart good genes in to foil bad ones. The biggest prob-
lem that remains is rendering the viruses truly harmless to avoid large-scale
immune responses like the one that killed Jesse Gelsinger. Researchers are
also working to engineer vectors that are more tissue-specific. The promise of
gene therapy may ultimately be realized, but it looks like a long, difficult, and
dangerous road ahead.

t’s impossible to overestimate the influence of genetics on our planet.
Every living thing depends on DNA for its life, and all living things, includ-
ing humans, share DNA sequences. The amazing similarities between your
DNA and the DNA of other living things suggest that all living things trace
their history back to a single source. In a very real sense, all creatures great
and small are related somehow.
The genetic underpinnings of life can be examined in all sorts of ways. One
powerful method for understanding the patterns hidden in your DNA is to com-
pare the DNA of many individuals as a group. This specialty, called population
genetics, is a powerful tool. Geneticists not only study human populations this
way, but they also apply it to animal populations to understand how to protect
endangered species, for example. In this chapter, you find out how scientists
analyze the genetics of many individuals all at once to understand where we
came from and where we’re going.
Genetic Variation Is Everywhere
The next time you find yourself channel surfing on the TV, pause a moment
on one of the channels devoted to science or animals. The diversity of life on
earth is truly amazing. In fact, scientists still haven’t discovered all the species
living on our planet; the vast rainforests of South America, the deep-sea vents
of the ocean, and even volcanoes hold undiscovered species. (Check out the
sidebar “What’s a species? And why does it matter?” to see how scientists
define what’s what.)

The interconnectedness of all living things, from a scientific perspective,
can’t be overstated. The sum total of all the life on earth is referred to as
biodiversity. Biodiversity is self-sustaining and is life itself. Together, the
living things of this planet provide oxygen for you (and everything else) to
breathe, carbon dioxide to keep plants alive and regulate the temperature
and weather, rainwater for you and your food supply, nutrient cycling to
nourish every single creature on earth, and countless other functions.
Biodiversity provides so many essential functions for human life that these
services have been valued at $33 trillion a year (yes, that’s trillion with a “t”).
(In case you’re wondering, researchers manage to put dollar values on func-
tions that the earth performs naturally, like rainfall, oxygen production, nutri-
ent cycles, soil formation, and pollination, to name a few.)
Underlying the world’s biodiversity is genetic variation. When you look
around at the people you know, you see enormous variation in height, hair
and eye color, skin tone, body shape, you name it. That phenotypic (physi-
cal) variation implies that each person differs genetically, too. Likewise, the
individuals in all populations of other sexually reproducing organisms vary in
phenotype and genotype as well. Scientists describe the genetic variation in
populations (defined as groups of interbreeding organisms that exist together
in both time and space) in two ways:
 Allele frequencies: How often do various alleles (alternate versions of a
particular section of DNA) show up in a population?
 Genotype frequencies: What proportion of a population has a certain
genotype?
Allele frequencies and genotype frequencies are both ways of measuring the
contents of the gene pool. The gene pool refers to all the possible alleles of all
the various genes that, collectively, all the individuals of any particular organ-
ism have. Genes get passed around in the form of alleles that are carried from
parent to child as the result of sexual reproduction. (Of course, there are
other ways to pass genes around without sex — viruses leave their genes all
over the place. Take a look at Chapter 14 for one way in which viruses leave
their genetic legacies.)
Allele frequencies
Alleles are various versions of a particular section of DNA (like alleles for eye
color; flip to Chapter 3 for a review of terms used in genetics). Most genes have
many different alleles. Geneticists use DNA sequencing (which I explain in
Chapter 11) to examine genes and determine how many alleles may exist. To
count alleles, they examine the DNA of many different individuals and look for
252
Part IV: Genetics and Your World 

differences among base pairs — the A’s, G’s, T’s, and C’s — that comprise DNA.
For the purposes of population genetics, scientists also look for individual dif-
ferences in junk DNA (DNA that doesn’t code for phenotype; see Chapter 18 for
more about how these junk DNA is used to provide DNA fingerprints).
253
Chapter 17: Tracing Human History and the Future of the Planet
What’s a species? And why does it matter?
Probably since the dawn of time (or at least the
dawn of humankind, anyhow), humans have been
classifying and naming the creatures around
them. The formalized species naming system,
what scientists call taxonomic classification, has
long relied on physical differences and similari-
ties between organisms as a means of sorting
things out. For example, elephants from Asia and
elephants from Africa are obviously both ele-
phants, but they’re so different in their physical
characteristics, among other things, that they’re
considered separate species. Over the past 50
years or so, the way in which species are classi-
fied has changed as scientists have gained more
genetic information about various organisms.
One way of classifying species is the biological
species concept, which bases its classification
on reproductive compatibility. Organisms that
can successfully reproduce together are con-
sidered to be of the same species, and those
that can’t reproduce together are a different
species. This definition leaves a lot to be
desired because many closely related organ-
isms can interbreed yet are clearly different
enough to be separate species.
Another method of classification, one that
works a bit better, says that species are groups
of organisms that maintain unique identities —
genetically, physically, and geographically —
over time and space. A good example of this
definition of species is dogs and wolves. Both
dogs and wolves are in the same pigeonhole, so
to speak — they’re both in the genus, Canis.
(Sharing a genus name tells you that organisms
are quite similar and very closely related.) But
their species names are different. Dogs are
always Canis familiaris, but there are many
species of wolves, all beginning with Canis but
ending with a variety of species names to accu-
rately describe how different they are from
each other (such as gray wolves, Canis lupus,
and red wolves, Canis rufus). Genetically, dogs
and wolves are very distinct, but they aren’t so
different that they can’t interbreed. Dogs and
wolves occasionally mate and produce off-
spring, but left to their own devices, they don’t
interbreed. So, if organisms sort themselves out
naturally, why do species definitions matter?
In part, how humans classify other organisms
influences a species’ survival — laws to protect
biodiversity usually depend on defining biodi-
versity one organism at a time, usually by
species. As human populations grow, we create
a wave of species extinctions that rivals the
events that killed off the dinosaurs. (Extinction
means the permanent and complete loss of a
species.) Scientists can’t finish discovering all
the world’s species fast enough to understand
what’s being lost. That’s bad because a species
that’s essential to our own survival may disap-
pear before its value is recognized and pro-
tected. Knowing what’s what and the role each
organism plays in the world is important to
human well-being. Humans depend on a vast,
interconnected network of organisms other
than ourselves. For example, all plants take in
carbon dioxide and convert it to oxygen. Trees
pull water from the ground and return it to the
atmosphere where it can fall again, as rain
(some species of trees are better at this than
others). Insects and microorganisms, such as
bacteria and fungi, interact with plants and ani-
mals in ways that provide food for other organ-
isms, including humans.

To see an example of the alleles listed for one particular gene in humans, visit
the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man Web site, www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
entrez/query.fcgi?db=OMIM, and type in the keyword “hemoglobin.” The
first entry, beta-hemoglobin (that is, “+141900”), provides an exhaustive list
of “allelic variants,” all the different forms — that is, alleles — of the beta-
hemoglobin gene that have been described.
Some alleles are very common, and others are rare. To identify and describe
patterns of commonness and rarity, population geneticists calculate allele fre-
quencies. What geneticists want to know is what proportion of a population
has a particular allele. This information can be vitally important for human
health. For example, geneticists have discovered that some people carry an
allele that makes them immune to HIV infection, the virus that causes AIDS.
Check out the sidebar “Plagues affect population genetics” for more details.
254
Part IV: Genetics and Your World 
Plagues affect population genetics
Around 900 years ago, a new immigrant arrived
in Europe. This traveler, a highly infectious dis-
ease called the Black Plague, swept through the
human population with deadly efficiency.
Estimates suggest that up to one-third of the pop-
ulation of western Europe died of the disease.
Stories of whole villages succumbing to the dis-
ease continue to this day. It seems that the Black
Plague was likely caused by a virus — a filovirus
similar to the one that causes Ebola, another
deadly infectious disease that lurks in Africa —
and not the bacterium that scientists have
blamed for over a 100 years. Regardless of its
cause, the Black Plague may have left behind an
interesting legacy: immunity to the virus that
causes AIDS.
Among people of European descent are individ-
uals carrying unusual alleles of the gene pro-
ducing CCR-5 — a component of a soldier of
your immune system called a macrophage.
Macrophages eat invading viruses and bacteria
to protect you from infection. Normally, when
exposed to the AIDS virus, the CCR-5–producing
macrophage gets hijacked by the virus and used
against the host to propagate infection. But that’s
not what happens in people carrying a mutated
version of the CCR-5 gene; these hardier ver-
sions of CCR-5 shrug off the virus and devour it.
Thus, people homozygous for the mutation are
immune to AIDS. (Heterozygotes have limited
protection from the disease, and people without
a copy of the unmutated allele have no protec-
tion from the disease.)
A group of scientists examined fossilized human
bones to determine when and where the protec-
tive mutation may have come from. Ancient DNA
found in bones recovered in Denmark indicates
that people living there 4,500 years ago already
had the mutation that makes CCR-5–producing
macrophages resist HIV. When the Black Death
swept through Europe much later, people lack-
ing the mutated CCR5 gene died, making the
allele more common. How common is the pro-
tective allele today? It depends on where your
ancestors lived. People in Sweden have the
highest allele frequency (13 percent of people
examined carried one or two copies). Roughly 11
percent of people from eastern European coun-
tries like Poland, along with British, Irish, and
Australian descendants, had the allele. Of west-
ern Europeans surveyed, Italians had the lowest
allele frequency (5 percent).

An allele’s frequency — how often the allele shows up in a population — is
pretty easy to calculate: Simply divide the number of copies of a particular
allele by the number of copies of all the alleles represented in the population
for that particular gene.
If you know the number of homozygotes (individuals having two identical
copies of a particular allele) and heterozygotes (individuals having two differ-
ent alleles of a gene), you can set the problem up using these two equations:
p + q = 1 or q = 1 – p. In a two-allele system, a lowercase letter p is usually
used to represent one allele frequency, and q is used for the other. Always, 
p + q must equal 1 (or 100 percent). For example, say you want to know the
frequency for the dominant allele (R) for round peas in a population of plants
like the ones Mendel studied (see Chapter 3 for all the details about Mendel’s
experiments). You know that there are 60 RR plants, 50 Rr plants, and 20 rr
plants. To determine the allele frequency for R (referred to as p), you multiply
the number of RR plants by two (because each plant has two R alleles) and
add that value to the number of Rr plants: 60 × 2 = 120 + 50 = 170. Divide the
sum, 170, by two times the total plants in the population (because each plant
as two alleles), or 2 (60 + 50 + 20) = 260. The result is 0.55, meaning that 55
percent of the population of peas have the allele R. To get the frequency of r
(that is, q), simply subtract 0.55 from 1.
The situation gets pretty complicated, mathematically speaking, when sev-
eral alleles are present, but the take-home message of allele frequency is still
the same: All allele frequencies are the proportion of the population carrying
at least one copy of the allele. And all the allele frequencies in a given popula-
tion must add to one (which can be expressed as 100 percent, if you prefer).
Genotype frequencies
Most organisms have two copies of every gene (that is, they’re diploid).
Because the two copies don’t necessarily have to be identical, individuals
can be either heterozygous or homozygous for any given gene. Like alleles,
genotypes can vary in frequency. Genotypic frequencies tell you what propor-
tion of individuals in a population are homozygous and, by extension, what
proportion are heterozygous. Depending on how many alleles are present in a
population, many different genotypes can exist. Regardless, the sum total of
all the genotype frequencies for a particular locus (location on a particular
chromosome; see Chapter 2 for details) must equal 1 (or 100 percent if you
work in percentage instead of proportion).
To calculate a genotypic frequency, you need to know the total number of
individuals who have a particular genotype. For example, suppose you’re
dealing with a population of 100 individuals; 25 individuals are homozygous
255
Chapter 17: Tracing Human History and the Future of the Planet

recessive (zz), and 30 are heterozygous (Zz). The frequency of the three geno-
types (assuming there are only two alleles, Z and z) is shown in the following,
where the total population is represented by N.
Allele frequency and genotype frequency are very closely related concepts
because genotypes are derived from combinations of alleles. It’s easy to see
from Mendelian inheritance (see Chapter 3) and pedigree analysis (see
Chapter 12) that if an allele is very common, homozygosity is going to be
high. It turns out that the relationship between allele frequency and homozy-
gosity is quite predictable. Most of the time, you can use allele frequencies to
estimate genotypic frequencies using a genetic relationship called the Hardy-
Weinberg law of population genetics.
Breaking Down the Hardy-Weinberg
Law of Population Genetics
Godfrey Hardy and Wilheim Weinberg never met, yet their names are forever
linked in the annals of genetics. In 1908, both men, completely independent of
each other, came up with the equation that describes how genotypic frequen-
cies are related to allele frequencies. Their set of simple and elegant equa-
tions accurately describes the genetics of populations for most organisms.
What Hardy and Weinberg realized was that in a two-allele system, all things
being equal, homozygosity and heterozygosity balance out. Figure 17-1 shows
how the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, as this genetic balancing act is known,
looks in a graph.
Relating alleles to genotypes
An equilibrium occurs when something is in a state of balance. Genetically, an
equilibrium means that certain values remain unchanged over the course of
time. The Hardy-Weinberg principle says that allele and genotype frequencies
will remain unchanged, generation after generation, as long as certain condi-
tions are met. In order for a population’s genetics to follow Hardy-Weinberg’s
relationships:

 The organism must reproduce sexually and be diploid. Sex provides
the opportunity to achieve different combinations of alleles, and the
whole affair (pardon the pun) depends on having alleles in pairs (but
many alleles can be used; you’re not limited to two at a time).
 The allele frequencies must be the same in both sexes. If alleles
depend entirely on maleness or femaleness, the relationships don’t fall
into place because not all offspring have an equal chance to inherit the
alleles — alleles on the Y-chromosome (see Chapter 5) violate Hardy-
Weinberg rules.
 The loci must segregate independently. Independent segregation of loci
is the heart of Mendelian genetics, and Hardy-Weinberg is directly
derived from Mendel’s laws.
 Mating must be random with respect to genotype. Matings between
individuals have to be random, meaning that organisms don’t sort them-
selves out based on the genotype being examined.
Hardy-Weinberg makes other assumptions about the populations it
describes, but the relationship is pretty tolerant of violations of those expec-
tations. Not so with the four listed above. When one of the four major
assumptions of Hardy-Weinberg isn’t met, the relationship between allele fre-
quency and genotype frequency usually starts to fall apart.
The Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium relationship is often illustrated graphically
(Figure 17-1 shows you what the relationships between allele and genotype
frequencies look like). The Hardy-Weinberg graph is fairly easy to interpret.
On the left side of the graph (Figure 17-1) is the genotypic frequency (as a
percentage of the total population going from 0 at the bottom to 100 percent
at the top). Across the bottom of the graph is the frequency of the recessive

allele, a (going 0 to 100 percent, left to right). To find the relationship
between genotype frequency and allele frequency according to Hardy-
Weinberg, just follow at straight line up from the bottom and then read the
value off the left side of the graph. For example, if you want to know what
proportion of the population is homozygous aa when the allele frequency of
a is 40 percent, start at the 40 percent mark along the bottom of the graph
and follow a path straight up (shown in Figure 17-1 with a dashed line) until
you get to the line marked aa (which describes the genotype frequency for
aa). Take a horizontal path (indicated by the arrow) to the left and read the
genotypic frequency. In this example, 20 percent of the population is
expected to be aa when 40 percent of the population carries the a allele.
It makes sense that when the allele a is very rare, homozygotes aa are rare,
too. As allele a becomes more common, the frequency of homozygotes slowly
increases. The frequency of the homozygous dominant genotype, AA,
behaves the same way but as a mirror image of aa (the genotype frequency
for aa) because of the relationship of the alleles A to a in terms of their own
frequency: p + q must equal 1. If p is large, q must be small and visa versa.
Check out the humped line in the middle of Figure 17-1. This is the frequency of
heterozygotes, Aa. The highest proportion of the population that can be het-
erozygous is 50 percent. You may guess that’s the case just by playing around
with monohybrid crosses like those described in Chapter 3. No matter what
combination of matings you try (AA with aa, Aa with Aa, Aa with aa, and so
on), the largest proportion of Aa offspring you can ever get is 50 percent. Thus,
when 50 percent of the population is heterozygous, the Hardy-Weinberg equi-
librium predicts that 25 percent of the population will be homozygous for the A
allele, and 25 percent will be homozygous for the a allele. This situation occurs
only when p is equal to q — in other words, p equals q equals 50 percent.
The relationship between allele frequencies and genotype frequencies is
described by the equation p2 + 2pq + q2. Thus, the line marked aa in Figure 17-1
is described by the equation p2. 2pq describes the frequency of heterozygotes
(Aa), and q2 describes the frequency of AA in the population.
Many loci obey the rules of the Hardy-Weinberg law in spite of the fact that the
assumptions required for the relationship aren’t met. One of the major assump-
tions that’s often violated amongst humans is random mating. People tend to
marry each other based on their similarities, such as religious background,
skin color, and ethnic characteristics. For example, people of similar socio-
economic background tend to marry each other more often than chance would
predict. Nevertheless, many human genes are still in Hardy-Weinberg equilib-
rium. That’s because matings may be dependent on some characteristics but
are still independent with respect to the genes. The gene that confers immunity
to HIV (featured in the sidebar “Plagues affect population genetics”) is a good
example of a locus in humans that obeys the Hardy-Weinberg law despite the
fact that its frequency was shaped by a deadly disease.
258
Part IV: Genetics and Your World 

Violating the law
There are several ways that populations can wind up out of Hardy-Weinberg
equilibrium. One of the most common departures from Hardy-Weinberg occurs
as a result of inbreeding. Put simply, inbreeding happens when closely related
individuals mate and produce offspring. Purebred dog owners are often faced
with this problem because certain male dogs sire many puppies, and a genera-
tion or two later, descendents of the same male are mated to each other. (In
fact, selective inbreeding is what created the various dog breeds to begin with.)
Inbreeding tends to foul up Hardy-Weinberg because some alleles start to
show up more and more often than others. In addition, homozygotes get more
common, meaning fewer and few heterozygotes are produced. Ultimately, the
appearance of recessive phenotypes becomes more likely. For example, the
appearance of hereditary problems in some breeds of animals, such as deaf-
ness among Dalmatian dogs, is a result of generations of inbreeding.
259
Chapter 17: Tracing Human History and the Future of the Planet
Genetics and the modern ark
As human populations grow and expand, nat-
ural populations of plants and animals start get-
ting squeezed out of the picture. One of the
greatest challenges of modern biology is figur-
ing out a way to secure the fate of worldwide
biodiversity. Preserving biodiversity often takes
two routes: establishment of protected areas
and captive breeding.
Protected areas such as parks set aside areas of
land or sea to protect all the creatures (animals
and plants) that reside within its borders. Some
of the finest examples of such efforts are found
among America’s national parks. But although
protecting special areas helps preserve biodi-
versity, these islands of biodiversity also allow
populations to become isolated. With isolation,
smaller populations start to inbreed, resulting in
genetic disease and vulnerability to extinction.
Sometimes, it’s necessary for conservation
geneticists to step in and lend a hand to rescue
these isolation populations from genetic peril. For
example, greater prairie chickens were common
in the Midwest at one time. By 1990, their popu-
lations were tiny and isolated. Isolation con-
tributed to inbreeding, causing their eggs to fail
to hatch. In order to help rebuild a healthy popu-
lation, biologists brought in more birds from pop-
ulations elsewhere to increase genetic diversity.
The strategy worked — the prairie chickens’
eggs now hatch with healthy chicks that are
hoped to bring the population back from the brink
of extinction.
Captive breeding efforts by zoos, wildlife parks,
and botanical gardens are also credited with
preserving species. Twenty-five animal species
that are completely extinct in the wild still sur-
vive in zoos thanks to captive breeding pro-
grams. Most programs are designed to provide
not only insurance against extinction but also
breeding stock for eventual reintroduction into
the wild. Unfortunately, zoo populations often
descend from very small founder populations,
causing considerable problems with inbreeding.
Inbreeding leads to fertility problems and the
death of offspring shortly after birth. In the last
20 years, zoos and similar facilities have worked
to combat inbreeding by keeping track of pedi-
grees (like the ones that appear in Chapter 12)
and swapping animals around to minimize
sexual contact between related animals.

The high incidence of particular genetic disorders among certain groups of
people, such as Amish communities (see Chapter 12), is also a result of
inbreeding. Even if people in a group aren’t all that closely related any more,
if a small number of people started the group, everyone in the group is
related somehow. (Relatedness shows up genetically even within large human
populations; take a look at the section “Mapping the Gene Pool” in this chap-
ter to find out how.) 
Loss of heterozygosity is thought to signal a population in peril. Populations
with low levels of heterozygosity are more vulnerable to disease and stress,
and that vulnerability increases the probability of extinction. Much of what’s
known about loss of heterozygosity and resulting problems with health of
individuals — a situation ironically called inbreeding depression — comes
from observations of captive animals, like those in zoos. Many animals in
zoos are descended from captive populations, populations that had very few
founders to begin with. For example, all captive snow leopards are reportedly
descended from a mere seven animals.
Not just captive animals are at risk. As habitats for animals become more and
more altered by human activity, natural populations get chopped up, iso-
lated, and dwindle in size. Conservation geneticists, like yours truly, work to
understand how human activities affect natural populations of birds and ani-
mals. Take a look at the sidebar “Genetics and the modern ark” for more
about how zoos and conservation geneticists work to protect animals from
inbreeding depression and rescue species from extinction.
Mapping the Gene Pool
When the exchange of alleles, or gene flow (see Figure 17-2), between groups is
limited, populations take on unique genetic signatures. In general, unique alle-
les are created through mutations (see Chapter 13). If groups of organisms are
geographically separated and rarely exchange mates (like the population on
the left in Figure 17-2), mutant alleles become common within populations.
What this amounts to is that some alleles are found in only certain groups,
giving each group a unique genetic identity. (After some time, these alleles
usually conform to a Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium within each population; see
the section “Breaking Down the Hardy-Weinberg Law of Population Genetics”
for details.) Geneticists identify genetic signatures of unique alleles by looking
for distinct patterns within genes and certain sections of junk DNA (see
Chapter 18 for how junk DNA conceals genetic information).
Mutant alleles that show up outside the population they’re usually associated
with suggest that one or more individuals have moved or dispersed between
populations. Geneticists use these genetic hints to trace the movements of
animals, plants, and even people around the world. In the sections that
follow, I cover some of the latest efforts to do just that.
260
Part IV: Genetics and Your World 

One big happy family
With the contributions of the Human Genome Project (covered in Chapter 11),
human population geneticists have a treasure trove of information to sift
through. Using new technologies, researchers are learning more than ever
before about what makes various human populations distinct. One such effort
is the HapMap Project. Hap stands for haplotype, which is another way of
saying an inventory of human alleles. The alleles being studied for the HapMap
aren’t necessarily alleles from specific genes; many are alleles within the junk
DNA. The HapMap takes advantage of single base pair changes, called SNPs
(see Chapter 18), in the DNA; SNPs are the results of thousands of substitution
mutations. Most of these tiny changes have no effect on phenotype, but collec-
tively they vary enough from one population to another to allow geneticists to
discern each population’s genetic signature.
After geneticists understand how much diversity exists among haplotypes,
they work to create genetic maps that relate SNP alleles to geographic loca-
tions. Essentially, all humans tend to divide up genetically into the three con-
tinents of Africa, Asia, and Europe. This isn’t too surprising — humans have
been in North and South America for only 10,000 years or so. When the genetic
uniqueness of the Old World’s people was described, geneticists examined
populations in North America and other immigrant populations to see if genet-
ics could predict where people came from. For example, genetic analyses of a
group of immigrants in Los Angeles accurately determined which continent
these people originally lived on. Some geneticists believe that the genetic maps
can be even more specific and may point people to countries, and maybe even
cities, where their ancestors once lived. The ultimate goal of the HapMap
Project is to link haplotypes to populations along with information about the
environment, family histories, and medical conditions to development tailor-
made treatments for diseases.

Because humans love to travel, geneticists have also compared rates of
movements between men and women. Common wisdom suggests that, his-
torically, men tended to move around more than women did (think
Christopher Columbus or Leif Ericson). However, DNA evidence suggests that
the men aren’t as prone to wander as previously believed. Geneticists com-
pared mitochrondrial (passed from mother to child) with Y-chromosome
DNA (passed from father to son). It seems that women have migrated from
one continent to another eight times more frequently than males. The tradi-
tion of women leaving their own families to join their husbands may have
contributed to the pattern, but another possible explanation exists: A pattern
of polygyny, men fathering children by more than one woman. So, back to that
bit about men wandering. . . .

histories — even to track down and meet relatives still living on the African
continent! Individual case studies are featured on the site along with explana-
tions about how the process of linking people with their distant relatives
works.
Uncovering the secret social 
lives of animals
Gene flow can have an enormous impact on threatened and endangered
species. For example, scientists in Scandinavia were studying an isolated
population of gray wolves not long ago. Genetically, the population was very
inbred; all the animals descended from the same pair of wolves. Heterozygosity
was low and, as a consequence, so were birth rates. When the population sud-
denly started to grow, the scientists were shocked. Apparently, a male wolf
migrated over 500 miles to join the pack and father wolf pups. Just one animal
brought enough new genes to rescue the population from extinction.
Mating patterns of animals often provide biologists with surprises. Because
humans like to form monogamous pairs, scientists have compared birds to
humankind by pointing to our apparently similar mating habits. As it turns out,
birds aren’t so monogamous after all. In most species of perching birds (the
group that includes pigeons and sparrows, to name two widespread types),
20 percent of all offspring are fathered by some male other than the one with
whom the female spends all her time. By spreading paternity among several
males, a female bird makes sure that her offspring are genetically diverse. And
genetic diversity is incredibly important to help fend off stress and disease.
262
Part IV: Genetics and Your World 

Genetics reveals that some birds are really frisky. For example, Fairy Wrens,
tiny, brilliant blue songbirds, live in Australia in big groups; one female is
attended by several males who help her raise her young. But none of the
males attending the nest actually father any of the kids — female Fairy Wrens
slip off to mate with males in distant territories. Other birds form family
groups. Florida scrub jays, beautiful aquamarine natives of central Florida,
stay home and help mom and dad raise younger brothers and sisters.
Eventually, older kids inherit their parents’ territory. Another Australian
species, White-winged Choughs, put a whole different twist on gathering a
labor force for raising their kids. Chough families (pronounced chuff) kidnap
their neighbors’ kids and put them to work raising offspring.
It turns out that humans aren’t the only ones who live in close association
with their parents, brothers, or sisters for their entire lives. Some species of
whales live in groups called pods. Every pod represents one family: moms, sis-
ters, brothers, aunts, and cousins, but not dads. Different pods meet up to find
mates — as in the son/brother of one pod may mate with the daughter/sister
of another pod. Males father offspring in different pods but stay with their
own families for their entire lives. Sadly, geneticists learned about whale
family structures and mating habits by taking meat from whales that had been
killed by people. Like so many of the world’s creatures, whales are killed by
hunters. Hopefully, though, the information that scientists gather when whales
are harvested will contribute to their conservation, allowing the planet’s
amazing biodiversity to persist for generations to come.

orensics pops up in every cop drama and murder mystery on television
these days, but what is forensics used for in the real world? Generally,
forensics is thought of as the science used to capture and convict criminals; it
includes everything from determining the source of carpet fibers and hairs to
paternity testing. Technically, forensics is the application of scientific methods
for legal purposes. Thus, forensic genetics is the exploration of DNA evidence —
who is it, who did it, and who’s your daddy.
Just as each person has his or her own unique fingerprint, each and every
human (with the exception of identical twins) is genetically unique. DNA fin-
gerprinting, also known as DNA profiling, is the process of uncovering the pat-
terns within DNA. DNA fingerprinting is at the heart of forensic genetics and
is often used to
 Confirm that a person was present at a particular location
 Determine identity (including gender)
 Assign paternity
In this chapter, you go inside the DNA lab to discover how scientists solve
forensic mysteries by identifying individuals and family relationships using
genetics.
The knowledge that each and every human’s fingerprints are unique is proba-
bly is old as humanity itself. But Edward Henry was the first police officer to
apply the patterns of loops, arches, and whorls from people’s fingertips to
identify individual people and match criminal to crime way back in 1899.

Rooting through Your Junk (DNA,
That Is) to Find Your Identity
It’s obvious just from looking at the people around you that each one of us
is unique. But getting at the genotype (genetic traits) behind the phenotype
(physical traits) is tricky business because almost all your DNA is exactly like
every other human’s DNA. Much of what your DNA does is provide the infor-
mation to run all your body functions. Most of those functions, like making
your heart beat and exchanging oxygen with carbon dioxide in your cells, are
exactly the same from one human to another. If you were to compare your
roughly 3 billion base pairs of DNA (see Chapter 6 for how DNA is put together)
with your next-door neighbor’s DNA, you’d find that 99.999 percent of your
DNA is exactly the same.
So what makes you look so different from the guy next door, or even from your
mom and dad? Your genetic uniqueness is the result of sexual reproduction.
(For more on how sexual reproduction works to make you unique, turn to
Chapter 2.) Until the human genome was sequenced (see Chapter 11), the tiny
differences produced by recombination and meiosis that make you genetically
unique were very hard to isolate. But in 1985, a team of scientists in Britain
figured out how to profile a tiny bit of DNA uniqueness into a DNA fingerprint.
Surprisingly, DNA fingerprinting doesn’t use the information contained in your
genes that make you look unique. Instead, the process takes advantage of part
of the genome that doesn’t seem to do anything at all: junk DNA.
Less than 2 percent of the human genome codes for actual physical traits,
meaning all your body parts and the ways they function (see Chapter 11).
That’s pretty astounding considering that your genome is so huge — So
what’s all that extra DNA doing in there? Scientists are still trying to figure
that part out, but what they do know is that some junk DNA is very useful for
identifying individual people.
Even within junk DNA, one human looks much like another. But there are short
stretches of junk DNA that vary a lot from person to person. Short tandem
repeats (STRs) are sections of DNA arranged in back-to-back repetition (a
simple sequence is repeated several times in a row). A naturally occurring
junk DNA sequence may look something like the example below. (The spaces
in these examples allow you to read the sequences more easily. Real DNA
doesn’t have spaces between the bases.)
TGCT AGTC AAAG TCTT CGGT TCAT
A short STR may look like this:
TCAT TCAT TCAT TCAT TCAT TCAT
266
Part IV: Genetics and Your World 

The number of repeats found in pairs of STRs varies from one person to
another. The variations are referred to as alleles (see Chapter 3 to learn more
about alleles). Using two chromosome pairs from different suspects, Figure
18-1 shows how the same STRs can have different alleles. Chromosome one
has two loci (in reality, this chromosome may have hundreds of loci, but we’re
only looking at two in this example). For the first suspect, the marker at STR
Locus A is the same length on both chromosomes, meaning that Suspect One
is homozygous for Locus A (homozygous means the two alleles at a particular
locus are identical; see Chapter 3). At Locus B, Suspect One has alleles that are
different lengths, meaning he’s heterozygous at that locus (heterozygous means
the two alleles differ). Now look at Suspect Two’s STR DNA profile. It shows
the same two loci, but the patterns are different. At Locus A, Suspect Two is
heterozygous and has one allele that’s different from Suspect One’s. At Locus
B, Suspect Two is homozygous for a completely different allele than the ones
Suspect One carries.
The variation in STR alleles is called polymorphism (poly- meaning “many”
and morph- meaning “shape or type”). Polymorphism arises from mistakes
made during the DNA copying process (called replication; see Chapter 7)
Normally, DNA is copied mistake-free during replication. But when the
enzyme copying the DNA reaches an STR, it often gets confused by all the
repeats and winds up leaving out one repeat — like one of the TCATs in the
example above — or putting an extra one in by mistake. As a result, the
sequences of DNA before and after the STR are exactly the same from one
person to the next, but the number of repeats within the STR varies. In the
case of junk DNA, the mutations in the STRs create lots of variation in how
many repeats appear (mutations in other genes can produce harmful and
severe consequences; see Chapter 13 for details).
The specific STRs used in forensics are referred to as loci or markers. Loci is
the plural form of locus, which is Latin for “place.” (Genes are also referred to
as loci; see Chapter 3.) You have hundreds of STR markers on every one of
your chromosomes. These loci are named using numbers and letters, such as
D5S818 or VWA.

Chapter 18: Forensic Genetics: Solving Mysteries Using DNA

Your STR DNA fingerprint is completely different from everyone else’s on
earth (except your identical twin, if you have one). The probability of anyone
else having identical alleles as you at each and every one of his or her loci is
outrageously small.
Lots of other organisms have STR DNA and, in turn, their own DNA finger-
prints. Dogs, cats, horses, fish, plants, in fact just about all eukaryotes have
lots of STR DNA. (Eukaryotes are organisms whose cells have nuclei.) That
makes STR DNA fingerprinting an extremely powerful tool to answer all kinds
of biological questions. (See Chapter 17 for more about how DNA fingerprint-
ing is used to solve other kinds of biological mysteries.)
Investigating the Scene:
Where’s the DNA?
When a crime occurs, several things have to happen before the forensic
geneticist can get to work to examine the DNA evidence. Evidence falls into
several different categories:
 Trace evidence: Paint, glass, fibers, hair, soil, plant parts, body fluids,
and cosmetics
 Fingerprint evidence: Individually unique patterns left behind when fin-
gers come in contact with surfaces
 Impressions: Most commonly shoe or tire prints
 Firearm and tool marks: Bullet holes, fired bullets, and signs of forced
entry
 Chemical evidence: Drugs or poisons
 Biological evidence: Blood, saliva, semen, and hair
The forensic geneticist and crime scene investigator are interested in the bio-
logical evidence because cells in biological evidence contain DNA.
Collecting biological evidence
Anything that started out as part of a living thing may provide useful DNA
for analysis. In addition to human biological evidence (blood, saliva, semen,
and hair), plant parts like seeds, leaves, and pollen as well as hair and blood
from pets can help link a suspect and victim. (See the sidebar “Pets and
plants play detective for more on how non-human DNA is used to investigate
crimes.)
268
Part IV: Genetics and Your World 

To properly collect evidence for DNA testing, the investigator must be very,
very careful because his or her own DNA can get mixed up with DNA from the
scene. Investigators wear gloves, avoid sneezing and coughing, and cover
their hair (I’m not kidding — dandruff has DNA, too).
To conduct a thorough investigation, the investigator needs to collect every-
thing at the scene (or from the suspect) that may provide evidence. DNA has
been gathered from bones, teeth, hair, urine, feces, chewing gum, cigarette
butts, toothbrushes, and even earwax! Blood is the most powerful evidence
because even the tiniest drop of blood contains about 80,000 white blood
cells, and the nucleus of every white blood cell contains a copy of the
donor’s entire genome and more than enough information to determine iden-
tity using a DNA fingerprint. But even one skin cell has enough DNA to make a
fingerprint (see “Outlining the powerful PCR process”). That means that skin
cells clinging to a cigarette butt or an envelope flap may provide the evidence
needed to place a suspect at the scene.
269
Chapter 18: Forensic Genetics: Solving Mysteries Using DNA
Pets and plants play detective
DNA evidence from almost any source may pro-
vide a link between criminal and crime. For
example, a particularly brutal murder in Seattle
was solved entirely on the basis of DNA provided
by the victim’s dog. After two people and their
dog were shot in their home, two suspects were
arrested in the case, and blood-spattered cloth-
ing was found in their possession. The only blood
on the clothing was of canine origin, and the
dog’s blood turned out to be the only evidence
linking the suspects to the crime scene. Using
markers originally designed for canine paternity
analysis, investigators generated a DNA finger-
print from the dog’s blood and compared it with
DNA tests from the bloodstained clothing. A per-
fect match resulted in a conviction.
If you have a cat or dog, you can testify to the fact
that pet hair clings to everything. This annoying
pet hair problem provided an important piece of
evidence in a murder case in Canada. A woman
was reported missing after her car, stained with
her blood, was found abandoned. Shortly there-
after, a man’s jacket was recovered from a
nearby wooded area; the jacket was spattered
with blood and sported white cat hair. The main
suspect in the case was the victim’s common-law
husband. However, at the time of the murder, the
suspect was living with his parents and their
white cat, Snowball. DNA fingerprinting showed
that the blood on the jacket belonged to the
murder victim, and the cat hair was a perfect
DNA match with Snowball. The result was a con-
viction for the prosecution.
Even plants have a space in the DNA evidence
game. The very first time DNA evidence from
plants was used was in an Arizona court case in
1992. A murder victim was found near a desert
tree called Paloverde. Seeds from that type of
tree were found in the bed of a pickup truck that
belonged to a suspect in the case, but the sus-
pect denied ever having been in the area. The
seeds found in the truck were matched to the
exact tree where the victim was found using
DNA fingerprinting. The seeds couldn’t prove the
suspect’s presence, but they provided a link
between his truck and the tree where the body
was found. The DNA evidence was convincing
enough to obtain a conviction in the case.

In order to draw information and conclusions from the DNA evidence, the
investigator needs to collect samples from the victim or victims, suspects,
and witnesses for comparison. Investigators collect samples from house-
plants, pets, or other living things nearby to compare those DNA fingerprints
to the DNA evidence. After the investigator gets these samples, it’s time to
head to the lab.
Moving to the lab
Biological samples contain lots of substances besides DNA. Therefore, when
the investigator gets the evidence to the lab, the first thing to do is extract
the DNA from the sample. (For a mini-DNA extraction experiment using a
strawberry, see Chapter 6.) There are different methods to extract DNA, but
they generally follow these three basic steps:
1. Break open the cells to free the DNA from the nucleus (this is called cell
lysis).
2. Remove the proteins (which make up most of the biological sample) by
digesting them with an enzyme.
3. Remove the DNA from the solution by adding alcohol.
After the DNA from the sample is isolated, it’s analyzed in a process called
polymerase chain reaction, or PCR.
Outlining the powerful PCR process
The goal of the PCR process is to make thousands of copies of specific parts
of the DNA molecule — in the case of forensic genetics, several target STR
loci that will be used to construct a DNA fingerprint. (Copying the entire DNA
270
Part IV: Genetics and Your World 
Decomposing DNA
DNA, like all biological molecules, can decom-
pose; that process is called degradation. A par-
ticular class of enzymes, called exonucleases,
whose whole function is to eat DNA carries out
degradation of DNA. Exonucleases are practi-
cally everywhere: on your skin, on the surfaces
you touch, and in bacteria. Any time DNA is
exposed to exonuclease attack, its quality
rapidly deteriorates because the DNA molecule
starts to get broken into smaller and smaller
pieces. Degradation is bad news for evidence
because DNA begins to degrade as soon as
cells (like skin or blood) are separated from the
living organism. To prevent DNA evidence from
further degradation after it’s collected, it’s
stored in a sterile (that is, bacteria-free) con-
tainer and kept dry. As long as the sample isn’t
exposed to high temperatures, moisture, or
strong light, DNA evidence can remain usable
for more than 100 years. (Even under all the
“wrong” conditions, DNA can sometimes last
for centuries; see Chapter 6.)

molecule would be useless because the uniqueness of each individual person
is hidden amongst all that DNA.) Many copies of several target sequences are
necessary for two reasons.
 Current technology used in DNA fingerprinting can’t detect the DNA
unless large amounts are present, and to get large amounts of DNA, you
have to make copies.
 Matches must be exact when it comes to DNA fingerprinting and foren-
sic genetics; after all, people’s lives are on the line. To avoid misidentifi-
cations, many STR loci from each sample must be examined.
In the United States, 13 standard markers are used for matching human sam-
ples, plus one additional marker that allows determination of gender (that is,
whether the sample came from a male or a female). These markers are part of
CODIS, the COmbined DNA Index System, which is the U.S database of DNA
fingerprints.
The PCR process takes advantage of the double-stranded structure of DNA (see
Chapter 6) and the natural process of DNA replication (see Chapter 7). (DNA
sequencing works much the same way as PCR; see Chapter 11 for the details.)
Here’s how PCR works, as shown in Figure 18-2:
1. To replicate DNA using PCR, you have to separate the double-stranded
DNA molecule (called the template) into single strands. This process is
called denaturing. When DNA is double-stranded, the bases are pro-
tected by the phosphate sugar backbone of the double helix (see
Chapter 6). DNA’s complementary bases, where all the information is
stored, are locked away, so to speak. To pick the lock, get at the code,
and build a DNA copy, the double helix must be opened up. The hydro-
gen bonds that hold the two DNA strands together are very strong, but
they can be broken by heating the molecule up to a temperature just
short of boiling (212 degrees Fahrenheit). When heated, the two strands
slowly come apart as the hydrogen bonds melt. DNA’s sugar-phosphate
backbone isn’t damaged by heat, so the single strands stay together
with the bases still in their original order.
2. When denaturing is complete, the mix is cooled slightly. Cooling allows
small, complementary pieces of DNA called primers to attach themselves
to the template DNA. The primers match up with their complements on
the template strands in a process called annealing. Primers only attach
to the template strand when the match is perfect; if no exact match is
found, the next step in the PCR process doesn’t occur because primers
are required to start the copying process (see Chapter 7 for more on
why primers are necessary to build strands of DNA from scratch). The
primers used in PCR are marked with dyes that glow when exposed to
the right wavelength of light (think fluorescent paint under a black light).
STRs of similar lengths (even though they may actually be on entirely
271
Chapter 18: Forensic Genetics: Solving Mysteries Using DNA

different chromosomes, as in Figure 18-1) are labeled with different colors
so that when the fingerprint is read, each locus shows up as a different
color (see “Constructing the DNA fingerprint” later in this chapter).
3. After the primers find their matches on the template strands, Taq poly-
merase, begins to do its work. Polymerases act to put things together (see
Chapter 7). In this case, the thing getting put together is a DNA molecule.
Taq polymerase starts adding bases — this stage is called extension —
onto the 3’-ends of the primers by reading the template DNA strand to
determine which base belongs next (see Chapter 6 for details on DNA
strands’ numbered ends). Meanwhile, on the opposite template stand at
the end of the reverse primer, Taq rapidly adds complementary bases
using the template as a guide. (The newly replicated DNA remains
double-stranded throughout this process is going on because the mix-
ture isn’t hot enough to melt the newly formed hydrogen bonds between
the complementary bases.)
One complete round of PCR produces two identical copies of the desired STR.
But two copies aren’t enough to be detected by the lasers used to read the
DNA fingerprints (see “Constructing the DNA fingerprint”). You need hundreds
of thousands of copies of each STR. So the PCR process — denaturing, anneal-
ing, and extending — repeats over and over.
Figure 18-3 shows you how fast this copying reaction adds up — after 5
cycles, you have 32 copies of the STR. Typically, a PCR reaction is repeated
for 30 cycles, so with just one template strand of DNA, you end up with
1,073,741,824 copies of the target STR (the primers and the sequence
between them). Usually evidence samples consist of more than one cell, so
it’s likely that you start with 80,000 or so template strands instead of just one.
With 30 rounds of PCR, this would yield . . . I’ll wait while you do the math . . .
okay, so it’s a lot of DNA, as in trillions of copies of the target STR. That’s the
power of PCR. Even the tiniest drop of blood or a single hair can yield a fin-
gerprint that may free the innocent or convict the guilty.

The invention of PCR revolutionized the study of DNA. Basically, PCR is like a
copier for DNA but with one big difference: A photocopier makes facsimiles;
PCR makes real DNA. Before PCR came along, scientists needed large amounts
of DNA directly from the evidence to make a DNA fingerprint. But DNA evi-
dence is often found and collected in very tiny amounts. Often, the evidence
that links a criminal to a crime scene is the DNA contained in a single hair!
One of the biggest advantages to PCR is that a very tiny amount of DNA —
even one cell’s worth! — can be used to generate many exact copies of the
STRs used to create a DNA fingerprint (see the section “Rooting through Your
Junk (DNA, That Is) to Find Your Identity” earlier in this chapter for a full
explanation of STR). Chapter 22 looks at the discovery of PCR in more detail.
Constructing the DNA fingerprint
For each DNA sample taken as forensic evidence and put through the process
of PCR, several loci are examined. (“Several” often means 13 because of the
CODIS database; see “Outlining the powerful PCR process” earlier.) This
study yields a unique pattern of colors and sizes of STRs — this is the DNA
fingerprint of the individual from whom the sample came.
DNA fingerprints are “read” using a process called electrophoresis. Electrophor-
esis takes advantage of the fact that DNA is negatively charged. As I cover in
Chapter 11, an electrical current is passed through a jelly-like substance (such
as a gel), and the completed PCR is injected into the gel. By electrical attrac-
tion, the DNA moves toward the positive pole (electrophoresis). Small STR frag-
ments move faster than larger ones, so the STRs sort themselves according to

size (see Figure 18-4). Because the fragments are tagged with dye, a computer-
driven machine with a laser is used to “see” the fragments by their colors. The
STR fragments show up as peaks like those shown in Figure 18-4. The results
are stored in the computer for later analysis of the resulting pattern.
The technology used in DNA fingerprinting now allows the entire process,
from extracting the DNA to reading the fingerprint, to be done very rapidly. If
everything goes right, it takes less than 24 hours to generate one complete
DNA fingerprint.
The first cases to use DNA fingerprinting appeared in the courts in 1986.
Generally, legal evidence must adhere to what experts call the Frye standard.
Frye is short for Frye v. United States, a court case decided in 1923. Put
simply, Frye says that scientific evidence can only be used when most scien-
tists agree that the methods and theory used to generate the evidence are
well established. Following its development, DNA fingerprinting rapidly
gained acceptance by the courts, and it’s now considered routine. The tests
used to generate DNA fingerprints have changed over the years, and STRs are
now the gold standard. The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) con-
verted its entire lab to STR testing in 2000, and other labs followed suit.

Catching Criminals (and 
Freeing the Innocent)
After the forensic geneticist generates DNA fingerprints from different sam-
ples, the next step is to compare the results. When it comes to getting the
most information out of the fingerprints, the basic idea is to look for matches
between the:
 Suspect’s DNA and DNA on the victim, the victim’s clothing or posses-
sions, or the location where the victim was known to have been.
 Victim’s DNA and DNA on the suspect’s body, clothing, or other posses-
sions, or a location linked to the suspect.
Matching the evidence to the bad guy
In Figure 18-4, you can see how the DNA fingerprint matching process works.
Exact matches stand out like a sore thumb. But when you find a match
between a suspect and your evidence, how do you know that no one else
shares the same DNA fingerprint as that particular suspect?
With DNA fingerprints, you can’t know for sure that a suspect is the culprit
you’re looking for, but you can calculate the odds of another person having
the same pattern. Because this book isn’t Statistical Genetics For Dummies, I’ll
skip the details of exactly how to calculate these odds. Instead, I’ll just tell
you that, in Figure 18-4, the odds of another person having the same pattern
as Suspect Two is 1 in 45 for locus one, 1 in 70 for locus two, and 1 in 50 for
locus three. To calculate the total odds of a match, you multiply the three
probabilities: 1⁄70 × 1⁄45 × 1⁄50 = 1⁄157,500. Based on your test using just three loci, the
probability of another person having the same DNA pattern as Suspect Two
is 1 in 157,500.
When all 13 CODIS loci are used, the odds of finding two unrelated persons
with the same DNA fingerprints are 1 in 53,000,000,000,000,000,000 (that’s 53
quintillion for those of you scoring at home). To put this figure in perspective,
there are only 6 billion people on the entire planet. To say the least, your life-
time odds of getting hit by lightning (1 in 3,000) are a lot better than this!
Of course, real life is a lot more complicated than the example in Figure 18-4.
Biological evidence samples are often mixed and contain more than one
person’s DNA. Because humans are diploid (having chromosomes in pairs;
see Chapter 2), mixed samples (called admixtures for you CSI fans) are easy to
spot — they have three or more alleles in a single locus. By comparing sam-
ples, forensic geneticists can parse out whose DNA is whose and even deter-
mine how much DNA in a sample was contributed by each person.
275
Chapter 18: Forensic Genetics: Solving Mysteries Using DNA

But what if the evidence and the suspect’s DNA don’t match? The good news
is that an innocent person is off the hook. The bad news is that the guilty
party is still roaming free. At this point, investigators turn back to the CODIS
system because it was designed not only to standardize which loci get used
in DNA fingerprinting but also to provide a library of DNA fingerprints to help
identify criminals and solve crimes. The FBI established the DNA fingerprint
database in 1998 based on the fact that repeat offenders commit most crimes.
When a person is convicted of a crime (laws vary on what convictions
require DNA sampling; see the sidebar “To find a criminal using DNA”), his or
her DNA is sampled — often by using a cotton swab to collect a few skin cells
from the inside of the mouth. As of September 2004, the CODIS database had
provided over 17,000 matches and assisted in over 20,000 investigations. If no
match is found in CODIS, the evidence is added to the database. If the perpe-
trator is ever found, then a match can be made to other crimes he or she may
have committed (see the sidebar “To find a criminal using DNA”).
276
Part IV: Genetics and Your World 
To find a criminal using DNA
The FBI’s CODIS system works because it con-
tains hundreds of thousands of cataloged sam-
ples for comparison. All 50 U.S. states require
DNA samples to be collected from persons con-
victed of sex offenses and murder. Laws vary
from state to state on what other convictions
require DNA sampling, but so far, CODIS has
cataloged over 300,000 offender samples with
at least that many more awaiting analysis. But
what if no sample has been collected from the
guilty party? What happens then?
Some law enforcement agencies have con-
ducted mass collection efforts to obtain DNA
samples for comparison. The most famous of
these collection efforts occurred in Great
Britain in the mid-1980s. After two teenaged
girls were murdered, every male in the entire
neighborhood around the crime scene was
asked to donate a sample for comparison. In all,
nearly 4,000 men complied with the request to
donate their DNA. The actual murderer, a man
named Colin Pitchfork (no, I’m not making this
up!), was captured after he bragged about how
he had gotten someone else to volunteer a
sample for him.
DNA evidence is also sometimes used to extend
the statute of limitations on crimes when no
arrest has been made. The statute of limitations
is the amount of time prosecutors have to bring
charges against a suspect. For example, a dis-
trict attorney in the state of Vermont has six
years to charge someone with burglary. If no
suspect is charged, then the crime “expires,”
and no suspect can ever be convicted for that
particular crime. Crimes involving murder have
no statute of limitations, but most states have a
statute of limitations on other crimes such as
rape. To allow prosecution of such crimes, DNA
evidence can been used to file an arrest warrant
or make an indictment against “John Doe” —
the unknown person possessing the DNA fin-
gerprint of the perpetrator. The arrest warrant
extends the statute of limitations indefinitely until
a suspect is captured.

Taking a second look at guilty verdicts
Not all persons convicted of crimes are guilty. One study estimates that
roughly 7,500 persons are wrongfully convicted each year in the United States
alone. The reasons behind wrongful conviction are varied, but the fact remains
that innocent persons shouldn’t be jailed for crimes they didn’t commit.
In 1992, Barry Scheck and Peter Neufeld founded the Innocence Project in an
effort to exonerate innocent men and women. The project relies on DNA evi-
dence, and services are free of charge to all who qualify.
Walter D. Smith is one of the 153 persons exonerated by DNA evidence with
the aid of the Innocence Project as of December 2004. In 1985, Mr. Smith was
wrongfully accused of raping three women. Despite his claims of innocence,
eyewitness testimony brought about a conviction, and Mr. Smith received a
sentence of 78 to 190 years in prison. During his 11 years of incarceration, Mr.
Smith earned a degree in business and conquered drug addiction. In 1996, the
Innocence Project conducted DNA testing that ultimately proved his innocence
and set him free.
It’s unclear how many criminal cases have been subjected to post-conviction
DNA testing, and the success rates for such cases are unreported. Surprisingly,
many states have opposed post-conviction testing, but laws are being passed
to allow or require such testing when circumstances warrant it.
It’s All Relative: Finding Family
Family relationships are important in forensic genetics when it comes to
paternity for court cases or determining the identities of persons killed in
mass disasters. Individuals who are related to one another have copies of
their DNA in common because each parent passes on half of his or her chro-
mosomes to each offspring (see Chapter 5). Within a family tree, the amount
of genetic relatedness, or kinship, among individuals is very predictable.
Assuming that mom and dad are unrelated to each other, full siblings have
roughly half their DNA in common because they each inherit all their DNA
from the same parents.
Paternity testing
Surprisingly (or maybe not, depending upon how many daytime talk shows
you watch), roughly 15 percent of children are fathered by someone other
than the father listed on the birth certificate. Therefore, tests to determine
277
Chapter 18: Forensic Genetics: Solving Mysteries Using DNA

what male fathered what child are of considerable interest. Paternity testing
is used in divorce and custody cases, determination of rightful inheritance,
and a variety of other legal and social situations.
Paternity testing using STR techniques has become very common and rela-
tively (pardon the pun) inexpensive. The methods are exactly the same as
those used in evidence testing (see “Outlining the powerful PCR process”
earlier). The only difference is the way the matches are interpreted. Because
the STR alleles are on chromosomes (see “Rooting through Your junk (DNA,
That Is) to Find Your Identity” earlier), a mother contributes half the STR
alleles possessed by a child, and the father contributes the other half.
Figure 18-5 shows what these contributions may look like in a DNA finger-
print. Alleles are depicted here as peaks, and arrows indicate the maternal
alleles. Assuming that mother and father are unrelated, half the child’s alleles
came from F2, indicating that F2 is likely the father.

Two values are often reported in paternity tests conducted with DNA finger-
printing:
 Paternity index: A value that indicates the weight of the evidence. The
higher the paternity index value, the more likely it is that the alleged
father is the actual genetic father. The paternity index is a more accurate
estimate than probability of paternity.
 Probability of paternity: The probability that a particular person could
have contributed the same pattern shown by the DNA fingerprint. The
odds calculations for probability of paternity are more complicated than
multiplying simple probabilities (see “Matching the evidence to the bad
guy”) because an individual who’s heterozygous at a particular locus has
an equal probability of contributing either allele. The probability of a par-
ticular male being the father also depends on how often the various alle-
les at a locus show up in the population at large (which is also true for
the estimates of odds shown in “Matching the evidence to the bad guy;”
see Chapter 17 for the lowdown on how population genetics works).
279
Chapter 18: Forensic Genetics: Solving Mysteries Using DNA
Thomas Jefferson’s son
Male children receive their one and only Y-
chromosome from their fathers (see Chapter 5).
Thus, paternity of male children can be resolved
by using DNA markers on the Y-chromosome.
The discovery of this testing option led to the
unusual resolution of a long-term mystery
involving the second president of the United
States, Thomas Jefferson.
In 1802, Jefferson was accused of fathering a
son by one of his slaves, Sally Hemings.
Jefferson’s only acknowledged offspring to sur-
vive into adulthood were daughters, but
Jefferson’s paternal uncle has surviving male
relatives that are descended in an unbroken
male line. Thus, the Y-chromosome DNA from
these Jefferson family members was expected
to be essentially identical to the Y-chromosome
DNA that Jefferson inherited from his paternal
grandfather — DNA he would have contributed
to a son. Five men known to have descended
from Jefferson’s uncle agreed to contribute
DNA samples for comparison with the only
remaining male descendent of Sally Hemings’s
youngest son. In all, 19 samples were examined.
These samples included descendants of other
potential fathers along with unrelated persons
for comparison. A total of 19 markers found only
on the Y-chromosome were used. (None of the
CODIS markers are on the Y-chromosome;
they’d be useless for females if they were.) The
Jefferson and Hemings descendents matched
at all 19 markers. Since the publication of the
genetic analysis, historical records were exam-
ined to provide additional evidence that
Jefferson fathered Sally Hemings’s son, Eston.
For example, Jefferson was the only male of his
family present at the time Eston would have
been conceived. Interestingly, examination of
the historical records seems to indicate that
Jefferson is likely the father of all of Sally
Hemings’s six children; however, this conclu-
sion remains controversial.

The results of paternity tests are often expressed in terms of “proof” of pater-
nity or lack thereof. Unfortunately, this terminology is inaccurate. Genetic
paternity testing doesn’t prove anything. It only indicates a high likelihood
that a given interpretation of the data is correct.
Relatedness testing
Paternity analysis isn’t the only time that DNA fingerprinting is used to deter-
mine family relationships. Historical investigations (like the Jefferson-Hemings
case explained in the sidebar “Thomas Jefferson’s son”) may also use patterns
inherited within the DNA to show how closely related people are and to iden-
tify remains. Mass fatality incidents such as plane crashes and the World
Trade Center disaster of September 11, 2001, rely on DNA technologies to
identify deceased persons. Several methods are used under such circum-
stances, including STR DNA fingerprinting, mitochondrial DNA analysis (see
Chapter 6 for the details on mitochondrial DNA), and Y-chromosome analysis
(similar to the method described in the sidebar “Thomas Jefferson’s son”).
Several conditions complicate DNA identification of victims of mass fatality
incidents. Bodies are often badly mutilated and fragmented, and decomposi-
tion damages what DNA remains in the tissues. Furthermore, reference sam-
ples of the deceased person’s DNA often don’t exist, making it necessary to
make inferences from persons closely related to the deceased.
Reconstructing individual genotypes
Much of what forensic geneticists know about identifying victims of mass fatali-
ties comes from airplane crashes. In 1998, Swissair Flight 111 crashed into the
Atlantic Ocean just off the coast of Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. This disaster
sparked an unusually comprehensive DNA typing effort that now serves as the
model for forensic scientists the world over dealing with similar cases.
In all, 1,200 samples from 229 persons were recovered from Swissair Flight
111. Only one body could be identified by appearance alone, so investigators
obtained 397 reference samples either from personal items belonging to vic-
tims (like toothbrushes) or from family members. Because most reference
samples from the victims themselves were lost in the crash, 93 percent of
identifications depended on samples from parents, children, and siblings of
the deceased. The number of alleles shared by family members is fairly pre-
dictable, allowing investigators to conduct parentage analysis based on the
expected rate of matching alleles. In the Swissair case, 43 family groups
(including six families of both parents and some or all of their children)
were among the victims, so the analyses were complicated by kinship
among the victims.
280
Part IV: Genetics and Your World 

The initial DNA fingerprinting of remains revealed 228 unique genotypes
(including one pair of twins). The 13 CODIS loci were tested using PCR (the
methods were identical to those described in “Catching Criminals (and Freeing
the Innocent)” earlier in this chapter). All the data from DNA fingerprinting was
entered into a computer program specifically designed to compare large num-
bers of DNA fingerprints. The program searched for several kinds of matches:
 A perfect match between a victim and a reference sample from a personal
item
 Matches between victims that would identify family groups (parents and
children, and siblings)
 Matches between samples from living family members
The computer then generated reports for all matches within given samples.
Two investigators independently reviewed every report and only declared
identifications when the probability of a correct identification was greater
than 1 million to 1. Altogether, over 180,000 comparisons were made to deter-
mine the identities of the 229 victims.
Forty-seven persons were identified based on matches with personal items.
The remaining 182 persons were identified by comparing victims’ genotypes
with those of living family members. The power of PCR, combined with many
loci and computer software, led to rapid comparisons and the positive identi-
fication of all the victims.
Bringing closure in times of tragedy
On September 11, 2001, two jetliners crashed into the twin towers of the
World Trade Center (WTC) in New York City. The enormous fires resulting
from the crashes caused both buildings to collapse. Roughly 2,700 persons
died in the disaster. Over 20,000 body parts were recovered from the rubble;
therefore, the task of forensic geneticists was two-fold: determine the identity
of each deceased person and collect the remains of particular individuals for
interment. Unlike Swissair Flight 111, few victims of the WTC tragedy were
related to each other. However, other issues complicated the task of identify-
ing the victims. Many bodies were subjected to extreme heat, and others
were recovered weeks after the disaster, as rubble was removed. Thus, many
victim samples had very little remaining DNA for analysis.
DNA reference samples from missing persons were collected from personal
effects such as toothbrushes, razors, and hairbrushes. Skin cells clinging to
toothbrushes account for almost 80 percent of the reference samples obtained
for comparison. These samples were DNA fingerprinted using PCR with the
standard 13 CODIS loci described in “Catching Criminals (and Freeing the
Innocent)” earlier in this chapter. By July 2002, roughly 300 identifications
281
Chapter 18: Forensic Genetics: Solving Mysteries Using DNA

were made using these direct reference samples. An additional 200 identifica-
tions were made by comparing victim samples to samples from living relatives
using the methods described for the Swissair crash (see “Reconstructing indi-
vidual genotypes”).
By July 2004, a total of 1,500 victims had been positively identified, but subse-
quent progress was slow. The remaining samples were so damaged that the
DNA is in very short pieces, too short to support STR analysis. Two avenues
for additional identifications remained:
 Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which is useful for two reasons:
• It’s multicopy DNA, meaning that each cell has many mitochondria,
and each mitochondrion has its own molecule of mtDNA.
• It’s circular, making it somewhat more resistant to decomposition
because the nucleases that destroy DNA often start at the end of
the molecule (see “Collecting biological evidence” earlier), and a
circle has no end, so to speak.
mtDNA is inherited directly from mother to child; therefore, only maternal
relatives can provide matching DNA. Unlike STR markers, mtDNA is usu-
ally analyzed by comparing the sequences of nucleotides from various
samples (see Chapter 11 to find out how DNA sequences are generated
and analyzed). Because sequence comparison is more complicated than
STR marker comparison, the analyses take longer to perform but provide
very accurate matches.
 Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP analysis) (pronounced snip),
which relies on the fact that DNA tolerates some kinds of mutation
without harming the organism (see Chapter 13 for more about muta-
tion). SNPs occur when one base replaces another in what’s called a
point mutation. Generally, T replaces A and G replaces C or visa versa
(see Chapter 6 for more about the bases that make up DNA). These tiny
changes occur often (some estimates are as high as about one in every
100 bases), and when many SNPs are compared, the changes can create
a unique DNA profile similar to a DNA fingerprint.
The downside to SNP analysis is that the point mutations don’t create
obvious size differences that can be detected by traditional DNA finger-
printing. Therefore, sequencing or gene chips (see Chapter 23 for more
on gene chips) must be used to detect the SNP profile of various individ-
uals. Because SNP analysis can be conducted on very small fragments
of DNA, it allowed investigators to make more identifications than were
possible otherwise. Even so, many persons were not identified, and
identification efforts were halted in February 2005.

Genetic Makeovers:
Fitting New Genes into
Plants and Animals
In This Chapter
 Introducing old genes in new places
 Modifying the genes of plants and animals
O
ne of the most controversial applications of genetics technology (besides
cloning, which I cover in Chapter 20) is the mechanical transfer of genes
from one organism to another. This process is popularly known as genetic modi-
fication (GM). More properly called transgenics, transferring genes simplifies
the production of some medications, creates herbicide-resistant plants, and
has even been used to create glow-in-the-dark pets (I’m not kidding — check
out the sidebar “Transgenic pets: Not all fun and games” for the details). In this
chapter, you discover how scientists move DNA around to endow plants, ani-
mals, bacteria, and insects with new combinations of genes and traits.
Seeing Genetically Modified
Organisms Everywhere
News items about genetically modified this, that, and the other crop up prac-
tically every day, and most of this news seems to revolve around protests,
bans, and lawsuits. Despite all the brouhaha, genetically modified “stuff” is
neither rare nor wholly dangerous. In fact, most processed foods that you eat
are likely to contain one or more transgenic ingredients.
If that revelation worries you, go to your local health food store and peer at the
labels on organic (and some non-organic) foods. (Organic foods are generally
defined as those produced without chemicals such as insecticides, herbicides,
or artificial ingredients.) You’ll see proclamations of “No GMO,” which is meant

to reassure you that no transgenes — genes that have been artificially intro-
duced using recombinant DNA methods (described in Chapter 16) — were
present in the plants or animals used to make the product in question.
In truth, there’s no avoiding genetically modified organisms in your everyday
life. Genetic modification by humans, via artificial selection and, on occasion,
induced mutation, created every single domesticated plant and animal species
on earth. Furthermore, the ability to move genes from one species to another
isn’t new — viruses and bacteria do it all the time. It’s a bit of a mystery as to
why transgenesis is less acceptable than induced mutagenesis and artificial
selection, but no matter what you call it, it’s all genetic modification.
The acronyms GM (genetically modified) and GMO (genetically modified
organism) are used all the time, but not in this chapter. Instead, I refer to
specifically to transgenic organisms because humans have been genetically
modifying organisms in a variety of ways for a long time.
Making modifications down on the farm
Humans started domesticating plants and animals many centuries ago (take a
look at the sidebar “Amazing maize” for how corn made the transition from
grass to gracing your table). Historically, farmers preferentially grew certain
types of plants to increase the frequency of desirable traits, such as sweeter
grapes and more kernels per stalk of wheat. Many, if not all, of the cereal
grains humans depend on, such as wheat, rice, and barley, are the result of
selective hybridization events that created polyploids (multiple chromosome
sets; see Chapter 15). When plants become polyploid, their fruits get substan-
tially larger. Fruits from polyploids are more commercially valuable (and
better tasting, too. Try a wild strawberry if you’re not convinced).
When it comes to animals, humans purposefully inbreed various animals to
increase the prevalence of traits such as high milk production in cows or
retrieving ability (make that obsession) in certain breeds of dogs. (Inbreeding
can also cause substantial problems; see Chapters 13 and 17 for details.)
Relying on radiation and chemicals
In addition to domestication and selective breeding, humans have taken
another path to genetically modify organisms. For over 70 years, new plant
breeds have been created by purposefully induced, albeit random, mutations.
In essence, plants are exposed to radiation (such as X-rays, gamma rays,
and neutrons) and chemicals to produce mutant alleles aimed at producing
284
Part IV: Genetics and Your World 

desired traits (see Chapter 13 for how radiation damages DNA to cause muta-
tion). Plants that commonly receive radiation and chemical treatment include:
 Food crops: Fruits, vegetables, and grains are mutated to produce dis-
ease resistance and size and flavor variations as well as to change the
timing of fruiting. Over 2,000 different types of plants are genetically mod-
ified in this fashion. Believe it or not, you eat these varieties all the time.
Ever had Rio Red grapefruit? If so, you enjoyed a mutated plant variety
that acquired its deep red color from a neutron-induced mutation.
 Ornamentals: Many of the unusual ornamental plants you enjoy are the
result of induced mutation. Roses, tulips, and chrysanthemums are all
zapped to produce new flower colors.

Amazing maize
Plants depend on a variety of helpers to spread
their seeds around: The wind, birds, animals, and
waterways all carry seeds from one place to
another. Most plants get along just fine without
humans. Not so with corn. Corn depends entirely
on humans to spread its seeds; archeological evi-
dence confirms that corn traveled only where
humans took it. What’s striking about this story is
that modern geneticists have pinpointed the
mutations that humans took advantage of to
create one of the world’s most widely used crops.
Primitive corn (called maize) put in its first appear-
ance around 9,000 years ago. The predecessor of
maize is a grass called teosinte. You need a good
imagination to see an ear of corn when you look
at the seed heads of teosinte; there’s only a vague
resemblance, and unlike corn, teosinte is only
barely edible — it has a few rock hard kernels per
stalk. Yet corn and teosinte (going by the scien-
tific name of Zea mays) are the same species.
The five mutations that turned teosinte into
maize popped up naturally and changed several
things about teosinte to make it a more palat-
able food source:
 One gene controls where cobs appear on
the plant stalk: Maize has its cobs along the
entire stem instead of on long branches like
teosinte.
 Three genes control sugar and starch stor-
age in the kernels: Maize is easier to digest
and better tasting than teosinte.
 One gene controls the size and position of
kernels on the cob: Unlike teosinte, maize
has an appearance normally associated
with modern corn.
Humans apparently used teosinte for food
before it acquired its mutational makeover, so
it’s likely that people caught on quickly to the
change that developed. The mutations of
the five genes mentioned above were cement-
ed into the genome by selective harvest and
planting of the new variety. People grew the
mutated plants on purpose, and the only reason
corn is so common now is because humans
made it that way. The first true maize crops
were planted in Mexico 6,250 years ago, and,
as a popular addition to the diets of people
in the area, its cultivation spread rapidly.
Archeological sites in the United States bear
evidence of maize cultivation as early as 3,200
years ago. By the time Europeans arrived, most
native peoples in the New World grew maize to
supplement their diets.

Introducing unintentional modifications
Humans mutate plants on purpose, but we also constantly make unintentional
genetic modifications on natural populations, such as mosquitoes and bacteria:
 Mosquitoes: Overzealous pesticide use has made most mosquito popu-
lations DDT-resistant.
 Bacteria: Many common antibiotics are rapidly being rendered ineffective
because susceptible bacteria are wiped out, leaving only resistant strains.
These changes in bacteria and mosquito populations are due to induced
changes in allele frequencies (see Chapter 17); essentially, humans set up
selective breeding by changing the environment.
Another unintentional modification occurs when transgenes escape from con-
trolled crops to wild plants — which they’re likely to do with great frequency
and efficiency. The wild plants are then genetically modified. These new, unin-
tentional recipients of biotechnology are no less genetically modified than the
crop plants (see the “Escaped transgenes” section later in the chapter).
Putting Old Genes in New Places
If genetic modification is so ubiquitous, what’s the problem with transgenic
organisms? After all, humans have been at this whole genetic modification
thing for centuries, right? Not exactly. Historically, humans have modified
organisms by controlling matings between animals and plants with preexist-
ing genetic compatibility.
Transgenics are often endowed with genes from very different species. (The
bacterial gene that’s been popped into corn to make it resistant to attack by
herbivores — plant-eating insects — is a good example.) Therefore, trans-
genic organisms wind up with genes that never could have moved from one
organism to another without considerable help (or massive luck; see the
“Traveling genes” sidebar for more about natural gene transfer events).
After these “foreign” genes get into an organism, they don’t necessarily stay
put. One of the biggest issues with transgenic plants, for example, is uncon-
trolled gene transfer to other, unintended species. Another controversial
aspect of transgenic organisms has to do with gene expression; many people
worry that transgenes will be expressed in agricultural products in unwanted
or unexpected ways, making foods toxic or carcinogenic.
286
Part IV: Genetics and Your World 

To understand the promises and pitfalls of transgenics, you first need to
know how transgenes are transferred and why. Recombinant DNA technology
is the set of methods used for all transgenic applications. The process used
to find genes, snip them out of their original locations, and pop them into
new locations (like the virus vectors used in gene therapy) is covered in
Chapter 16. The set of techniques used specifically to create transgenic
organisms often goes by the title genetic engineering. Genetic engineering
refers to the directed manipulation of genes to alter phenotype in a particular
way. Thus, genetic engineering is also used in gene therapy to bring in
healthy genes to counteract the effects of mutations.
287
Chapter 19: Genetic Makeovers: Fitting New Genes into Plants and Animals
Traveling genes
In a scenario that mixes equal doses of plagues,
conspiracy theory, and bioterrorism, a recent
British TV drama called Fields of Gold tells a tale
of genetic engineering gone dreadfully wrong.
The plot involves a farmer who somehow genet-
ically engineers an antibiotic-resistant gene into
his wheat crop (I guess he did this in his state-
of-the-art lab out in the barn). The fictional trans-
gene jumps ship and winds up in nasty, infectious
bacteria, setting off a wave of terror, mayhem,
and illness. It doesn’t sound like the feel-good hit
of the year, does it? For Britons, the program
probably seemed more like a documentary given
the hysteria in Western Europe over all things
bioengineered (see the “Weighing points of con-
tention” section in this chapter). Scientists
bashed the show as unrealistic and entirely
impossible, but the creators defended their story
as plausible (yet fictitious), based on a natural
phenomenon called horizontal gene transfer.
Movement of genes from one organism to
another usually occurs through mitosis or meio-
sis, the normal mechanisms of inheritance. With
horizontal gene transfer, genes can move from
one species to another without mating or cell
division. Bacteria and viruses accomplish this
task with ease; they can slip their genes into the
genomes of their hosts to alter the functions of
host genes or supply the hosts with new, some-
times unwanted ones. This movement of genes
isn’t merely scientific fiction or a rare event,
either. The appearance of antibiotic-resistant
genes in various species of bacteria is due to
horizontal gene transfers. Horizontal transfer
also occurs in multicellular organisms (various
species of fruit flies have shared their genes
this way). One group of researchers has even
shown that horizontal gene transfer may occur
as a result of eating DNA. Yes, you read that
correctly. The scientists fed mice a mixture that
included DNA sequences not found anywhere
in the mouse genome. The scientists found the
experimentally introduced DNA circulating in
the bloodstreams of their mice, strongly sug-
gesting that horizontal transfer had actually
occurred. Indeed, your own genome may owe
some of its size and genetic complexity to genes
acquired from bacteria. So, although Fields of
Gold is fictional, the possibility of genes turning
up in unexpected places is real.

Puttering with Transgenic Plants
Plants are really different from animals, but not in the way you may think. Plant
cells are totipotent, meaning that practically any plant cell can eventually give
rise to every sort of plant tissue: roots, leaves, and seeds. When animal cells
differentiate during embryo development, they lose their totipotency forever
(but the DNA in every cell retains the potential to be totipotent; see Chapter
20). For genetic engineers, the totipotency of plant cells reveals vast possibili-
ties for genetic manipulation.
Much of the transgenic revolution in plants has focused on moving genes to
plants from bacteria, other plants, and even animals, to achieve various ends,
including nutritionally enhancing certain foods, such as rice. The strongest
efforts are directed at altering crops to resist either herbicides used against
unwanted competitor plants or the attack of plant-eating insects.
Following the transgenesis 
process in plants
In general, developing transgenic plants for commercial uses involves three
major steps:
1. Find (or alter) the gene that controls desired traits such as herbicide
resistance.
2. Slip the transgene into an appropriate delivery vehicle (a vector).
3. Create fully transgenic plants that pass on the new gene along with their
seeds.
Pinpointing the right gene
The process of finding and mapping genes is pretty similar from one organ-
ism to another (see Chapter 16 for some of the details). After scientists iden-
tify the gene they want to transfer, they must alter the gene so that it works
properly outside the original organism. All genes must have promoter
sequences, the genetic landmarks that identify the start of a gene, to allow
transcription to occur (for the scoop on transcription, flip to Chapter 8).
When it comes to creating a transgenic plant, the promoter sequence in the
original organism may not be very useful in the new plant host; as a result, a
new promoter sequence is needed to make sure the gene gets turned on
when and where it’s wanted.
288
Part IV: Genetics and Your World 

Modifying the gene to reside in its new home
To date, the promoter sequences that genetic engineers use in transgenic
plants are set to be always on. Therefore, the transgene’s products show up
in all the tissues and cell types of the entire plant in which the transgene’s
inserted. The all-purpose promoter often used for transgenes in plants comes
from a pathogen called cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV). CaMV seems to work
well just about everywhere it’s used and is a reliable on-switch for the trans-
genes with which it’s paired. When more precise regulation is needed, genetic
engineers can use promoters that respond to conditions in the environment
(see Chapter 10 for more about how cues in the environment can control
genes).
In addition to the promoter, genetic engineers must also find a good compan-
ion gene — called a marker gene — to accompany the transgene. The marker
gene provides a strong and reliable signal indicating that the whole unit
(marker and transgene) is in place and working. Common markers include
genes that convey resistance to antibiotics. With these kinds of markers,
geneticists grow transgenic plant cells in medium that contains the antibiotic.
Only the plants that have resistance (conveyed by the marker gene) survive,
providing a quick and easy way to tell which cells have the transgene (alive)
and which don’t (dead).
Getting new genes into the plant
Genetic engineers use two main methods to put new genes into plants:
 Use a vector system from a common soil bacterium called
Agrobacterium.
Agrobacterium is a plant pathogen that causes galls, big, ugly, tumor-like
growths, to form on infected plants. In Figure 19-1, you can see what a
gall looks like. Gall formation results from integration of bacterial genes
directly into the infected plant’s chromosomes. The bacteria enters the
plant from a wound such as a break in the plant’s stem that allows bacte-
ria to get past the woody defense cells that protect the plant from
pathogens (just as your skin protects you). The bacterial cells move into
the plant cells (scientists aren’t sure exactly how they pull off this trick),
and once inside, DNA from the bacteria’s plasmids, circular DNAs that
are separate from the bacterial chromosome, integrate into the host
plant’s DNA. The bacterial DNA pops itself in more or less randomly and
then hijacks the plant cell to allow it to replicate.
Like the geneticists using virus vectors for gene therapy (see Chapter 16),
genetic engineers snip out gall-forming genes from the Agrobacterium plas-
mids and replace them with transgenes. Host plant cells are grown in the
lab and infected with the Agrobacterium. Because these cells are totipo-
tent, they can be used to grow an entire plant — roots, leaves, and all —
and every cell contains the transgene. When the plant forms seeds, those
contain the transgene, too, ensuring that the transgene is passed to the
offspring.
289
Chapter 19: Genetic Makeovers: Fitting New Genes into Plants and Animals

 Shoot plants with a gene gun so that microscopic particles of gold or
other metals carry the transgene unit into the plant nucleus by brute
force.
Gene guns are a bit less dependable than Agrobacterium as a method for
getting transgenes into plant cells. However, some plants are resistant to
Agrobacterium, thus making the gene gun a viable alternative. With gene
guns, the idea is to coat microscopic pellets with many copies of a trans-
gene and by brute force (provided by compressed air) shove the pellets
directly into the cell nuclei. By chance, some of the transgenes are
inserted into the plant chromosomes.
Exploring commercial applications
Transgenic plants have made quite a splash in the world of agriculture. So far,
the main applications of this technology have addressed two primary threats
to crops:
 Weeds: The addition of herbicide-resistant genes make crop plants
immune to the effects of weed-killing chemicals, allowing farmers to
spread herbicides over their entire fields without worrying about killing
their crops. Weeds compete with crop plants for water and nutrients,
reducing yields considerably. Soybeans, cotton, and canola (a seed that
produces cooking oil) are only a few of the crop plants that have been
genetically altered to tolerate certain herbicides.
A couple of different chemical companies have gotten into the trans-
genic plant business with the idea of producing crop plants that aren’t
susceptible to herbicides the company makes. The companies then
market their crop plants along with their chemicals.

 Bugs: The addition of transgenes that confer pest-killing properties to
plants effectively reduces crop losses to plant-eating bugs. Geneticists
provide pest-protection traits using the genes from Bacillus thuringiensis
(otherwise known as Bt). Organic gardeners discovered the pesticide
qualities of Bt, a soil bacterium, years ago. Bt produces a protein called
Cry. When an insect eats the soil bacteria, digestion of Cry releases a
toxin that kills the insect shortly after its meal. Transgenic corn and
cotton carry the Bt Cry gene; there’s a potato version, too, but its culti-
vation has been discontinued because fast-food restaurants and potato
chip makers have refused to purchase the transgenic potatoes.
Weighing points of contention
Few genetic issues have excited the almost hysterical response met by trans-
genic crop plants. European efforts over the past ten years to implement
the use of transgenics have been particularly contentious. Opposition to
transgenic plants generally falls into four basic categories, which I cover in
this section.
Food safety issues
Normally, gene expression is highly regulated and tissue-specific, meaning
that proteins produced in a plant’s leaves, for example, don’t necessarily
show up in its fruits. Because of the way transgenes are inserted, however,
their expression isn’t under tight control (because the genes are always “on;”
see “Following the transgenesis process in plants” earlier in this chapter).
Opponents to transgenics worry that proteins produced by transgenes may
prove toxic, making foods produced by those crop plants unsafe to eat.
Researchers usually evaluate the effects of chemicals and drugs by dosing
animals (usually rats and mice) with ever-increasing amounts of the chemical
until they observe effects. Food products are more complicated to test,
though, because test animals get not only the protein produced by the trans-
gene but the food as well, making it hard to parse out the effects of one ingre-
dient over another. Instead of going the megadose route with animal testing,
safety evaluations of transgenic crops rely on a concept called substantial
equivalence.
Substantial equivalence is a detailed comparison of transgenic crop products
with their non-transgenic equivalents. This comparison involves chemical
and nutritional analyses, including tests for toxic substances. If the trans-
genic product has some detectable difference, that trait is targeted for fur-
ther evaluation. Thus, substantial equivalence is based on the assumptions
that any ingredient or component of the nontransgenic product is already
deemed safe and that only new differences found in the transgenic version
are worth investigating. For example, in the case of transgenic potatoes,
unmodified potatoes are thought to be safe, so only Bt is slated for further
291
Chapter 19: Genetic Makeovers: Fitting New Genes into Plants and Animals

tests. In spite of comparison testing, researchers have had difficulty docu-
menting any unwanted side effects from food produced with transgenic
crops. Millions of persons each year consume food produced with these
crops, and no ill effects have been documented thus far.
One research report published in 1999 documented the possibly hazardous
nature of transgenic food. In short, the study reported evidence that rats’
immune systems and organs were damaged by consuming transgenic pota-
toes. Upon its release, the study generated a great deal of controversy, in part
because one of the authors of the study announced his findings before the
paper was accepted for publication in any scientific journal. That may not
sound like a big deal, but it means that experts in the field hadn’t evaluated
the work before it was made public. Evaluation of research results as part of
the publication process is called peer review. Peer review is meant to prevent
erroneous or bogus findings from being reported as fact. In the case of the
transgenic potato uproar, the talkative author was severely castigated by the
scientific community for announcing his results as valid when no evaluations
other than his own had occurred. The work was eventually published, but its
conclusions haven’t been easy to replicate, suggesting that the result may
not be valid.
Escaped transgenes
The escape of transgenes into other hosts is a widely reported fear of transgen-
ics opponents. Canola, a common oil-seed crop, provides one good example
of how quickly transgenes can get around. Herbicide-resistant canola was
marketed in Canada in 1996 or so. By 1998, wild canola plants in fields where
no transgenic crop had ever been grown already had not one but two different
transgenes for herbicide resistance. This finding was quite a surprise because
no commercially available transgenic canola came equipped with both trans-
genes. It’s likely that the accidental transgenic acquired its new genes via
pollination.
In 2002, several companies in the United States failed to take adequate precau-
tions mandated by law to prevent the escape of corn transgenes via pollination
or the accidental germination of untended transgenic seeds. These lapses
resulted in fines — and the release of transgenes into unintended crops.
Actual transgene escape isn’t widely documented yet, but containment of
transgenes is virtually impossible. Introgression, the transfer of transgenes
from one plant to another, has the potential to occur relatively frequently.
Canola, sunflowers, wheat, sugar beets, alfalfa, and sorghum readily share
genes with related plants. Most of these plants are wind-pollinated, meaning
that mature plants easily spread their genes over very broad regions every
time the breeze blows. For example, one transgenic grass used on golf
courses passed its transgene for herbicide resistance on to a wild relative
that was a whopping 12 miles away!
292
Part IV: Genetics and Your World 

Movements of transgenes for pest and herbicide resistance may pale in the
face of the newest wave of transgenic plants: pharmaceuticals. The goal of this
movement is to use plants to produce proteins that were previously difficult
or prohibitively costly to manufacture. Drugs to treat disease, edible vaccines,
and industrial chemicals are just a few of the possibilities. As of this writing,
actual field trials for some of these transgenic plants are already underway.
The consequences for transgene escape from these sorts of crops could be
dire — and frankly, containment failures of other transgenic crops don’t bode
well for future containment prospects. And unlike Bt and herbicide-ready
transgenics, the compounds produced by pharmaceuticals are truly biologi-
cally active in humans, making them truly dangerous to human health.
Developing resistance
The third major point of opposition to transgenics — the development of
resistance to transgene effects — is connected to the widespread movement
of transgenes. The point of developing most of these transgenic crops is to
make controlling weeds or insect pests easier. Additionally, transgenic crops
(particularly transgenic cotton) have the potential to significantly reduce
chemical use, which is a huge environmental plus. However, when weeds or
insects acquire resistance to transgene effects, the chemicals that transgen-
ics are designed to replace are rendered obsolete.
Full-blown resistance development depends on artificial selection supplied by
the herbicide or the plant itself. Resistance develops and spreads when insects
that are susceptible to the pesticide transgene being used are all killed. The
only insects that survive and reproduce are, you guessed it, able to tolerate
the pesticide transgene. Insects produce hundreds of thousands of offspring,
so it doesn’t take long to replace susceptible populations with resistant ones.
To counter the threat of resistance development, users of transgenic crops
advocate nontransgenic refuges — places where nontransgenic crops are
grown to support populations of susceptible bugs. The idea is that inheritance
of the transgene resistance is diluted by the genes of susceptible bugs. So far,
the implementation of refuges has seen limited success; in all likelihood,
refuges may only slow the spread of resistance, not prevent it altogether.
Damaging unintended targets
The argument against transgenic plants is that nontarget organisms may
suffer ill effects. For example, when Bt corn was introduced (see “Exploring
commercial applications”), controversy arose surrounding the corn’s toxicity
to beneficial insects (that is, bugs that eat other bugs) and desirable crea-
tures like butterflies. Indeed, Bt is toxic to some of these insects, but it’s
unclear how much damage these natural populations sustain from Bt plants.
The biggest threat to migratory monarch butterflies is likely habitat destruc-
tion in their overwintering sites in Mexico, not Bt corn.
293
Chapter 19: Genetic Makeovers: Fitting New Genes into Plants and Animals

Assessing outcomes
Transgenic plants appear to help reduce the amount of pesticides used, but
only by a small margin (between 1 and 3 percent). Since the development of
transgenic plants, herbicide use has actually increased, presumably because
the chemicals can be freely broadcast onto herbicide-ready crops. However,
the impact of herbicide-resistant crops on no-till, a farming method that sig-
nificantly reduces erosion and soil loss, is positive; more farmers have turned
to no-till as they’ve adopted transgenic crops. But if weeds acquire the trans-
genes, this improvement will be promptly reversed. In fact, transgenic crops
don’t seem to have increased yields very much. Despite the relatively scant
advantages and extremely strong opposition (especially in Europe), advo-
cates of transgenic crops remain optimistic and hopeful for an agricultural
revolution.
Toying with Transgenic Animals
Mice were the organisms of choice in the development of transgenic methods.
Scientists discovered that genes could be inserted into a mouse’s genome
during the process of fertilization. When a sperm enters an egg, there’s a brief
period before the two sets of DNA (maternal and paternal) fuse to become
one. The two sets of DNA existing during this intermission are called pronuclei.
Geneticists discovered that by injecting many copies of the transgene (with its
promoter and sometimes with a marker gene, too; see “Modifying the gene to
reside in its new home”) directly into the paternal pronucleus (see Figure 19-2),
the transgene was sometimes integrated into the embryo’s chromosomes.
(Eggs can be injected with transgenes after the pronuclei fuse, but uptake of
the transgene is somewhat less efficient.)

Not all of the embryo’s cells contain the transgene, however, because the
uptake of the transgene takes place during cell division; sometimes, several
rounds of division occur before the transgene gets scooped up. The cells
that do have the transgene often have multiple copies (oddly, these end up
together in a head-to-tail arrangement), and the transgenes are inserted into
the mouse’s chromosomes at random. The resulting, partly transgenic mouse
is called a chimera, or a mosaic. Mosaicism is the expression of genes in some
but not all cells of a given individual, making gene expression somewhat
patchy. To get a fully transgenic animal, many chimeras are mated in the
hope that homozygous transgenic offspring will be produced from one or
more matings. After researchers obtain homozygotes, they isolate the trans-
gene line so that no heterozygotes are formed by mating transgenic animals
with nontransgenic animals.
One of the first applications of the highly successful mouse transgenesis
method used growth hormone genes. Rat, human, and bovine growth hor-
mone genes produced much larger mice than normal. The result encouraged
the idea that growth hormone genes engineered into meat animals such as
the following would allow faster production of larger, leaner, animals:
 Pigs and cows: Transgenic pigs haven’t fared very well; in studies, they
grew faster than their nontransgenic counterparts but only when fed
large amounts of protein. And female transgenic pigs turned out to be
sterile. All pigs showed muscle weakness, and many developed arthritis
and ulcers. Cows haven’t done any better. So far, no commercially viable
transgenic cows or pigs engineered for growth have been produced.
 Fish: Unlike pigs and cows, fish do swimmingly with transgenes (see the
sidebar “Transgenic pets: Not all fun and games” for one application of
transgenics in fish). Transgenic salmon grow six times faster than their
nontransgenic cousins and convert their food to body weight much
more efficiently, meaning that less food makes a bigger fish. So far,
Atlantic salmon are targeted for the growth-enhancing gene, but none
are commercially available yet. Transgenic fish would be raised in pens
situated in larger bodies of water, making escape of transgenics into wild
populations a certainty. Plus, natural salmon populations are severely
depleted due to overharvest. Farmed fish tend to be highly aggressive
and are feared to out compete their wild relatives. Thus, farm-raised
salmon pose a threat to natural populations of both their own and other
fish species as well.
Primates have also been targeted for transgenesis as a way to study human
disorders including aging, neurological diseases, and immune disorders. The
first transgenic monkey was born in 2000. This Rhesus monkey was endowed
with a simple marker gene because the purpose of the study was simply to
determine whether transgenesis in monkeys was possible. The marker gene
used was the one that produces green fluorescence in jellyfish. This gene has
been successfully inserted into plants, frogs, and mice, but those recipients
rarely glow green. The monkey recipient is no exception: Her chromosomes
295
Chapter 19: Genetic Makeovers: Fitting New Genes into Plants and Animals

bear the gene, but no functional fluorescent protein is produced — yet. Twin
monkeys produced in the same project died before birth, but both had fluo-
rescent fingernails and hair follicles. Because some transgenic animals dis-
play delayed onset of the gene function, the surviving monkey may yet glow.
Even with this modest success, monkeys’ reproductive cycles aren’t easy to
manipulate, so progress with transgenic primates is slow.

Transgenic pets: Not all fun and games
Ever have one of those groovy posters that
glows under a black light? Well, move that black
light over to the aquarium — there’s a new fish
in town. Originally derived from zebrafish, a tiny,
black-and-white–striped native of India’s
Ganges River, these glowing versions bear a
gene that makes them fluorescent. The little,
red, glow-in-the-dark wonders (one report calls
them “Frankenfish”) are the first commercially
available transgenic pets.
Zebrafish are tried-and-true laboratory veterans—
they even have their own scientific journal!
Developmental 
biologists 
love 
zebrafish
because their transparent eggs make it simple
to observe development. Geneticists use
zebrafish to study the functions of all sorts of
genes, many of which have direct counterparts
in other organisms, including humans. And
genetic engineers have taken advantage of
these easy-to-keep fish, too; scientists in
Singapore saw the potential to use zebrafish as
little pollution indicators. The Singapore geneti-
cists use a gene from jellyfish to make their
zebrafish glow in the dark. The action of the flu-
orescent gene is set up to respond to cues in
the environment (like hormones, toxins, or tem-
perature; see Chapter 10 for how environmen-
tal cues turn on your genes). The transgenic
zebrafish then provide a quick and easy to read
signal: If they glow, a pollutant is present.
Of course, glowing fish are so unique that some
enterprising soul couldn’t let lab scientists have
all the fun. Thus, these made-over zebrafish have
hit pet stores. Many scientists don’t see the
humor in making transgenic fish available to
the public, however. The state of California has
banned their sale outright, and at least one major
pet store chain refuses to sell them. The main
objection so far seems to be an ethical one —
opponents object to genetic engineering used for
“trivial” purposes (see Chapter 21 for details
about ethics and genetics). The U.S. FDA (Food
and Drug Administration), however, has deemed
glowing zebrafish safe (they’re nontoxic, and no,
you won’t glow if you eat one).
A more serious and biologically relevant argu-
ment against glowing exotic fish may be the
threat of invasive species. Invasive species pre-
sent all kinds of nasty problems for the environ-
ment. For example, the reason you don’t enjoy
homegrown chestnuts in the United States any
more is because an introduced plant disease lit-
erally wiped out every single tree. Introduced
insects, plants, and animals represent an enor-
mous and expensive threat to agriculture world-
wide. Regular zebrafish already live in Florida’s
warm waters along with a dizzying number of
other nonnative fish that collectively threaten to
destroy the native fish community entirely.
Glowing fish may be only the beginning, by the
way. Reports suggest that glow-in-the-dark
lawn grasses and grasses in unusual colors are
in the works. And remarkable glowing colors
are only one possibility. One company has
announced plans to make hypoallergenic cats!
(But don’t hold your breath; animals don’t
respond well to the random insertion of genes
into their chromosomes, so the production of
sneeze-free kitties is a distant dream.)

Trifling with Transgenic Insects
A number of uses for transgenic insects appear to be on the horizon. Malaria
and other mosquito-borne diseases are a major health problem worldwide,
but the use of pesticides to combat mosquito populations is problematic
because resistant populations rapidly replace susceptible ones. And, in fact,
the problem is not really the mosquitoes themselves (despite what you may
think when you’re being buzzed and bitten). The problem is the parasites and
viruses the mosquitoes carry and transmit through their bites. In response to
these problems, researchers are developing transgenic mosquitoes unable to
carry parasites or viruses, rendering their bites itchy but otherwise harm-
less. Unfortunately, it’s not clear how or if transgenic mosquitoes could
replace populations of bugs that carry diseases.
Other attempts at biological control of insects have met with limited success.
They usually involve the release of millions of sterile bugs that attract the
mating attentions of fertile ones. The matings result in infertile eggs, reducing
the reproduction of the target insect population. Part of the downside of this
environmentally friendly approach to pest control is that sterility is induced
using radiation, and irradiated insects lack the vigor needed to aggressively
pursue sex. Transgenic infertility may solve the problem. The general process
is the same, but the transgenically infertile insects still have the energy needed
to pursue mates, resulting in a more effective pest control strategy. This is an
especially appealing idea when used to combat invasive species that can
sweep through crops with economically devastating results.
The whole transgenic pesticide-resistance affair may be used to enhance nat-
ural control of pest populations by using insects that make a living eating
other bugs. The idea is to create beneficial insects that bear the transgene
that confers pesticide resistance. The farmers can then put out pesticides to
kill susceptible insects and release beneficial bug predators to do the rest.
Such a strategy may reduce pesticide use dramatically and eliminate the
need for transgenic, insect-resistant crops.
Another transgenic insect project in the works uses silkworms. The silkworms
are equipped with a gene used to make human skin protein. The intention is to
mass-produce the protein for use in human skin grafts needed after burns and
to aid with wound healing.
Fiddling with Transgenic Bacteria
Bacteria are extremely amenable to transgenesis. Unlike other transgenic
organisms, genes can be inserted into bacteria with great precision, making
expression far easier to control. As a result, many products can be produced
using bacteria, which can be grown under highly controlled conditions,
297
Chapter 19: Genetic Makeovers: Fitting New Genes into Plants and Animals

essentially eliminating the danger of transgene escape. (The techniques used
to slip genes into bacteria chromosomes are identical to those used in gene
therapy, which I describe in Chapter 16.)
Many important drugs are produced by recombinant bacteria, such as insulin
for treatment of diabetes, clotting factors for the treatment of hemophilia,
and human growth hormone for the treatment of some forms of dwarfism.
These sorts of medical advances can have important side benefits, as well:
 Transgenic bacteria can produce much greater volumes of proteins than
traditional methods.
 Transgenic bacteria are safer than animal substitutes, such as pig
insulin, which are slightly different from the human version and there-
fore may cause allergic reactions.
 Transgenic bacteria are much less controversial than other organisms
and thus are well received for the production of medications.
Transgenic bacteria are also used for applications down on the farm. Bovine
somatotropin, better known as bovine growth hormone, increases milk pro-
duction in cows. Transgenic bacteria are used to produce large quantities of
the hormone (called rbGH for recombinant bovine growth hormone), which
is injected into dairy cows to boost milk production. Despite outcries to the
contrary, studies show that rbGH isn’t active in humans, meaning that
humans don’t respond to bovine growth hormone even when it’s injected in
their bodies. Furthermore, milk produced by cows injected with rbGH is
chemically indistinguishable from milk produced by cows injected with the
actual hormone. The advantage of rbGH is that it allows fewer cows to pro-
duce more milk — a good thing because dairies represent a significant source
of fecal pollution in rivers and streams, and fewer cows means less pollution.
The downside is that cows treated with rbGH are more vulnerable to infec-
tion, requiring treatment with antibiotics and thus increasing the risk of
developing antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
Recent advances in biotechnology may produce other gains in protecting the
environment. For example, work is underway to take advantage of the pro-
duction of biodegradable plastics using bacteria-produced chemicals called
polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs). PHAs are molecules that are used like fats to
store energy. They’re also very similar to the plastics made from petroleum
that you see all the time. Researchers have taken the gene that makes PHA
and popped it into E. coli to produce enough PHA to manufacture products
with. It’s likely that PHAs will find their way into the marketplace as a viable
alternative to traditional plastics.

I
t sounds like science fiction: Harvest your genetic information, implant
that information into an egg cell, and after nine months, welcome a new
baby into the world. A new baby with a difference — it’s a clone.
Depending upon your point of view, cloning organisms may sound like a
nightmare or a dream come true. Whatever your opinion, cloning is most def-
initely not science fiction; decisions about experimental cloning are being
made right now, every day. This chapter covers cloning: what it is, how it’s
done, and what its impact is from a biological point of view. Cloning (like just
about everything else in science) isn’t as simple as the media makes it sound.
In this chapter, you get to know the problems inherent in clones along with
the arguments for and against cloning (not just of humans — of animals and
plants, too). Get ready for an interesting story. Remember, it ain’t fiction!
Attack of the Clones
A clone is simply an identical copy. The word is used as both a verb, as in “to
clone” (make one) and a noun, as in “a clone” (have one or be one).
Genetically, the word clone can have two meanings. When geneticists talk
about cloning, they’re most often talking about copying some part of the DNA
(usually a gene). Geneticists clone DNA in the lab every day — the technol-
ogy is simple, routine, and unremarkable. Cloning genes is a vital part of
 DNA sequencing (see Chapter 11)
 The study of gene functions (see Chapter 10)

 The creation of recombinant organisms (see Chapter 16)
 The development of gene therapy (see Chapter 16)
The other use of the word cloning means to make a copy of an entire organism
as a reproductive strategy. When referring to a whole creature as opposed to
DNA, a clone is an organism that’s created via asexual reproduction, meaning
offspring are produced without the parent having sex first. Cloning occurs nat-
urally all the time in bacteria, plants, insects, fish, and lizards. For example,
one type of asexual reproduction is parthenogenesis, which occurs when a
female makes eggs that develop into offspring without being fertilized by a
male (for some of you female readers, I’m sure this sounds very appealing). So
if reproduction by cloning is a natural, normal biological process, what’s the
big deal with cloning organisms using technology?
Like No Udder
Cloning animals hit the news big time in 1997 with the birth of Dolly, an unre-
markable looking Finn Dorset lamb. (In case you’re wondering, Finn Dorset
sheep are all white with small ears.) Named after the well-endowed country
singer Dolly Parton, Dolly the sheep was a clone of one of her mother’s udder
cells. (If you didn’t grow up on a farm, udders are the part of the animal that
produces milk — in other words, breasts. And, hence the name of everyone’s
favorite clone.) I use the term “mother” rather loosely when it comes to
Dolly; the cells came from one animal, the egg was derived from a second
animal, and yet a third female was the birth mom.
Dolly’s name was intended as a bit of a joke, but the fact that an animal had
been cloned meant many people weren’t laughing. Images of a future filled with
mass-produced human beings began to fill the minds of many. Clones aren’t
unique individuals and, in Dolly’s case, are produced via technology. Therefore,
human rights advocates and religious leaders often object to cloning on moral
or ethical grounds (see “Arguments against cloning” later in this chapter).
Despite her ordinary appearance, Dolly was unique in that no other mammal
had been reproduced successfully using a somatic (body) cell via cloning
(see the “Discovering why Dolly is really something to bah about” section
later in the chapter). But Dolly wasn’t the first organism to be cloned.
Cloning before Dolly:
Working with sex cells
Experimental cloning started in the 1950s. In 1952, researchers transplanted
the nucleus from a frog embryo into a frog egg. This and subsequent experi-
ments were designed not to clone frogs but to discover the basis of totipotents.
300
Part IV: Genetics and Your World 

Totipotent cells are capable of becoming any sort of cell and are the basis for
all multicellular organisms. Totipotency lies at the heart of developmental
genetics.
For most organisms, after an egg is fertilized, the zygote begins developing
by cell division, which I walk you through in Chapter 2. Division proceeds
through two, four, eight, and sixteen cells. When the zygote reaches the 
16-cell stage, the cells wind up in a hollow ball arrangement called a blasto-
cyst. Figure 20-1 shows the stages of development from two cells to 
blastocyst.
Zygote development in mammals is unique because the cells don’t all divide
at the same time or in the same order. Instead of proceeding neatly from two
to four to eight, the cells often wind up in odd numbers. Mammal zygotes
have a unique stage of development, called compaction, when the cells go
from being separate little balls into being a single, multicellular unit (see
Figure 20-1). Compaction occurs after the third round of cell division. After
compaction, the cells divide again (up to roughly 16), the inner cell mass
forms (this will become the fetus), and fluid accumulates in the center of the
ball of cells to form the blastocyst.
After a few more divisions, the cells rearrange into a three-layered ball called
a gastrula. The innermost layer of the gastrula is endoderm (literally “inner
skin”), the middle is mesoderm (“middle skin”), and the outermost is ecto-
derm (“outer skin”). Each layer is composed of a batch of cells, so from the
gastrula stage onward, what cells turn into depends on which layer they start
out in. In other words, the cells are no longer totipotent; they have specific
functions.

Chapter 20: Cloning: There’ll Never Be Another You

So why is totipotency important? The entire body plan of an organism is
coded in its DNA. Practically every cell gets a copy of the entire body plan (in
the cell nucleus; see Chapter 6 for more on DNA and cells). Yet, despite
having access to the entire genome, eye cells produce only eye cells, not
blood cells or muscle cells. All cells arise from totipotent cells but end up nul-
lipotent — able to produce only cells like themselves. Totipotents hold the
key to gene expression and what turns genes on and off (covered in detail in
Chapter 10). Understanding what controls totipotency also has broad impli-
cations for curing diseases such as cancer (see Chapter 14), treating spinal
cord injuries via totipotent stem cells (see Chapter 23), and curing inherited
disorders (see Chapter 15).
Discovering why Dolly is really
something to bah about
The scientific breakthrough that Dolly the sheep signifies isn’t cloning. The
real breakthrough is that Dolly started off as a nullipotent cell nucleus. For
many years, scientists couldn’t be certain that loss of totipotency didn’t
involve some change at the genetic level. In other words, researchers won-
dered if the DNA itself got altered during the process of going from totipotent
to nullipotent. Dolly convincingly demonstrated that nuclear DNA is nuclear
DNA regardless of what sort of cell it comes from. (See Chapter 6 for more
about nuclear DNA.) Theoretically, any cell nucleus is capable of returning to
totipotency. That may turn out to be very good news.

Aclone in the universe?
When a human clone was reportedly born in
December 2002, the news wasn’t wholly unex-
pected. A company called Clonaid made the
announcement and, purportedly, the clone; the
company claimed that one cloned child had been
born and numerous clone babies were on the
way. The question is: On their way from where?
As it turns out, Clonaid was founded by a group
called the Raelians. While being entertained by
sexy robots on board an alien spacecraft, Rael,
the group’s founder, reportedly learned that all
humans are descended from clones created
25,000 years ago by space aliens. Clonaid’s
claims (all of them, including the sexy robot thing)
are unsubstantiated. Shortly after the initial
announcement of cloning success, Clonaid was
invited to submit samples for genetic testing to
support its claim. Ultimately, Clonaid refused
genetic tests as an infringement on the right to
privacy by the cloned child’s parents. There’s no
word on how many parents the cloned child
might have (with the egg mother, womb mother,
and cell donor, it could be as many as three dif-
ferent people!). So have we a clone in the uni-
verse? I’ll let you decide.

The promise of therapeutic cloning is that someday doctors will be able to
harvest your cells, use your DNA to make totipotent cells, and then use those
cells to cure your life-threatening disease or restore your damaged spinal
cord to full working order. Creating totipotent cells from nullipotent cells to
treat injury or disease is difficult and triggers significant ethical debates (see
“Weighing Both Sides of the Cloning Debate” later in this chapter). Realizing
the potential of therapeutic cloning may be a very long way off. Meanwhile,
reproductive cloning — the process of creating offspring asexually — is
already causing quite a stir. For a taste of some of the excitement, see the
sidebar “Aclone in the universe?”.
Clone It Yourself!
Despite the fact that rats, mice, goats, cows, horses, pigs, and cats have all
been cloned, cloning isn’t easy or routine. Cloning efficiency (the number of
live offspring per cloning attempt) is generally very low. Dolly, for example,
was the only live offspring out of 277 tries. All sorts of other biological prob-
lems also arise from cloning, but to understand them, you first need to under-
stand how clones are created. (I return to the subjects of challenges and
problems in the aptly titled “Confronting Problems with Clones” section later
in the chapter.)
Making twins
One simple way to make a clone is to take advantage of the natural process of
twinning. Identical twins normally arise from a single fertilized egg, called a
zygote (see the “Cloning before Dolly: Working with sex cells” section earlier
in the chapter). The zygote goes through a few rounds of cell division, and
then the cells separate into two groups, each going on to form one offspring.
Artificial twinning is relatively simple and was first done successfully (in
sheep) in 1979. A single fertilized egg was used, meaning that the resulting
offspring was the result of sexual reproduction. Zygotes from normally fertil-
ized (sexually produced) eggs were harvested from ewes (female sheep). The
zygote was allowed to divide up to the 16-cell stage (see the “Cloning before
Dolly: Working with sex cells” section earlier in the chapter). The 16 cells
were then divided into two groups. The separate groups of cells went right on
dividing, and after they were implanted into the reproductive tract of the
ewe, they resulted in twins. The twins were genetically identical to each other
because they were produced from the same fertilized egg.
In cows, about 25 percent of artificial embryo splits result in twin births;
75 percent result in only one calf. Nonetheless, the procedure is successful
enough to increase the number of calves by about 50 percent over conven-
tional fertilizations. By the year 2000, roughly 50,000 calves had been produced
303
Chapter 20: Cloning: There’ll Never Be Another You

using embryo splitting. This sort of cloning is relatively routine in agricultural
settings and has received surprisingly little attention in the debate over clon-
ing. The fact that the clones arise from a fertilized egg may have dampened the
furor somewhat.
Using a somatic cell nucleus
to make a clone
Somatic cells are body cells. Typically, body cells are nullipotent, meaning
they only make more of the same kind of cell by mitosis (see Chapter 2 for all
the details on mitosis). For example, your bone cells only make more bone
cells, your blood cells only make more blood cells, and so on. Most somatic
cells have nuclei that contain all the information needed to make an entire
organism — in the case of cloning, a clone of the cell’s owner (sometimes
referred to a donor).
Harvesting the donor cell
The choice of cell type used for cloning is not trivial. The cells must grow
well in vitro (literally “in glass,” as in a test tube), and those from the female
reproductive tract (mammary, uterine, and ovarian cells) seem to work best.
Sorry, guys, but so far very few clones are male.
Because body cells are often in the process of dividing (mitosis), the donor’s
cell must be treated to stop cell division and leave the cell in the G0 stage of
mitosis. In this state, the chromosomes are “relaxed” and the DNA isn’t
undergoing replication. When the cell is made inactive, the nucleus of the
donor cell along with all the chromosomes inside it are harvested. This har-
vest is usually accomplished by gently drawing the cell nucleus out with a
needle attached to a syringe-like tool called a pipette (see Figure 20-2 to see
what this looks like). The process of removing a cell nucleus is called enucle-
ation, and the resulting cell is enucleated (that is, lacking a nucleus).
Harvesting the egg cell
To complete the process of making a clone using the somatic cell method,
another cell is needed; this time, an egg cell. Egg cells are generally the
largest cells in the body. In fact, a mature mammalian egg cell is visible to
the naked eye; it’s about the size of a very small speck of dust, like what you
might see floating in the air when a shaft of sunlight pierces an otherwise
dark room.
304
Part IV: Genetics and Your World 

To harvest an egg cell, the female animal (here, called the egg mother) is
treated with a hormone to stimulate ovulation. When the egg mother pro-
duces eggs, she first makes an oocyte, or immature egg (see Chapter 2 for a
full rundown of egg production as part of gametogenesis). At the oocyte
stage, the egg has completed the first round of meiosis (meiosis I) but isn’t
ready to be fertilized. The oocyte is harvested, and all the chromosomes are
removed (oocytes don’t really have nuclei to contain chromosomes) using
the same method as was used for the somatic cell, leaving only the cytoplasm
behind (take a peek at Figure 20-2). Also remaining in the oocyte’s cytoplasm
are mitochondria, which each contain a copy of the egg mother’s mitochondr-
ial DNA (see Chapter 6). After the clone is formed, the egg mother’s mitochon-
drial DNA and the donor cell’s nuclear DNA may interact and have unexpected
consequences (see “Confronting Problems with Clones” later in this chapter).
As it turns out, some egg cells are really versatile. Rabbit egg cells have been
used to clone cats, for example. Generally, though, staying within a species
works best — that is, cat egg cells work best with cat somatic cell nuclei. See
the sidebar “Clone, Spot, clone!” for more about cloned kitties.
Putting it all together
With both donor cell and the egg cell in hand, the nucleus from the donor cell
is injected into the enucleated oocyte (see Figure 20-2). The donor nucleus is
fused with the oocyte using a brief electrical shock. This little jump-start
plays the part of fertilization: The oocyte starts dividing and begins develop-
ing into an embryo. After cell division is well established, the dividing cells
are implanted into a female (the birth or gestation mother) for the remainder
of the pregnancy. Dolly the sheep clone was born after 148 days gestation,
which is about five days longer than average for a Finn Dorset sheep.
305
Chapter 20: Cloning: There’ll Never Be Another You
Clone, Spot, clone!
Yes, folks, it’s possible to clone your kitty or
duplicate your doggie. That’s the promise of a
company called Genetic Savings and Clone,
which offers tissue preservation services and
yes, cloning. The first cloned cat, named CC for
Copy Cat, was produced by researchers at
Texas A&M University in 2002. (It’s the ultimate
revenge for all those Aggie jokes, I guess.) The
work, funded by billionaire John Sperling, was
originally meant for canine cloning. Mr. Sperling
wants to clone his own beloved dog, Missy, who
died in 2002. Like most cloning efforts, success
rates are low; only one in 87 attempts produce a
live kitten. But as it turns out, that old phrase
“copy cat” has a deeper meaning — cats are a
lot easier to clone than dogs for a number of
reasons. Dogs’ reproductive biology isn’t very
amenable to the forced ovulation required for
oocyte harvesting. In the meantime, Genetic
Savings and Clone can bank some of your dog’s
cells in supercold freezers until the technologi-
cal problems are solved. Gives a whole new
meaning to the command “stay,” doesn’t it?

Confronting Problems with Clones
At birth, Dolly seemed normal in every way. She grew to adulthood, was
mated to a ram, and gave birth to her own lambs (a total of six over her life-
time). However, Dolly lived only six years; normally, Finn Dorsets live 11 or 12
years. Dolly became ill with a lung disease, and to relieve her suffering, she
was euthanized (painlessly put to death). The first hint that Dolly wasn’t com-
pletely normal was arthritis. She developed painful inflammation in her joints
when she was only 4 years old. Arthritis isn’t unusual in sheep, but it usually
only occurs in very old animals.
As it turns out, a number of abnormalities are common among clones. Clones
suffer from a variety of physical ailments, including heart malformations,
high blood pressure, kidney defects, impaired immunity to diseases, liver dis-
orders, malformed body parts, diabetes, and obesity. The following sections
examine the most common physical problems clones face.
Faster aging
Before somatic cells divide during mitosis, the DNA in each cell must repli-
cate (see Chapter 7 for replication information). Each entire chromosome is
copied except for the ends of the chromosomes, called telomeres, which
aren’t fully replicated. As a result, telomeres shorten as the cell goes through
repeated rounds of mitosis. Shortening of telomeres is associated with aging
because it happens over time (see the sidebar “Your aging DNA” for more).
Telomere shortening may mean problems for clones created through somatic
nucleus transfer because, in essence, such clones start out with “aged” DNA.

Part IV: Genetics and Your World 

Dolly had abnormally short telomeres, giving rise to the worry that perhaps
all clones may suffer from degenerative diseases due to premature aging.
Research with other clones has provided conflicting results. Some clones, like
Dolly, have shortened telomeres. Surprisingly, some clones seem to have
reversed the effects of aging; specifically, their telomeres are repaired and end
up longer than those of the donor. What this reversal suggests is that embry-
onic cells have telomerase, the enzyme that builds new telomeres using an
RNA template during DNA replication (see Chapter 7 for more about telom-
erase and its role in replication). In the end, the possibility of premature aging
in clones is a real one, but not all clones seem to be susceptible to it.
Bigger offspring
Clones tend to be physically large; at birth, they have higher than average
weights and larger than normal body sizes. Many clones, such as cows and
sheep, must be delivered by cesarean section because they’re too large to be
307
Chapter 20: Cloning: There’ll Never Be Another You
Your aging DNA
As you get older, your body changes: You get
wrinkles, parts start to sag, and your hair goes
gray. Eventually, the chromosomes in some of
your cells get so short that they can no longer
function properly, and the cells die. This pro-
gressive cell death is thought to cause the
unwelcome signs of aging you’re familiar with.
In fact, the shortening of telomeres in most ani-
mals is so predictable that it can be used to
determine how old an animal is.
All your cells have the genes to make telom-
erase (see Chapter 7). But telomerase genes are
turned on only in certain kinds of cells: germ
cells (those that make eggs and sperm), bone
marrow cells, skin cells, hair follicle cells, and
the cells that line the intestinal walls (in other
words, cells that divide a lot). Cancer cells also
have telomerase activity, a fact that allows the
unregulated growth of tumors that’s sometimes
fatal (see Chapter 14 for more on genetics and
cancer).
In experiments, mice without a functioning
telomerase gene aged faster than normal mice.
This finding led some researchers to believe that
telomerase may be used (eventually) to reverse
or prevent aging in humans. Recently, however,
research shows that telomere length is only part
of the story. Telomeres interact with proteins that
cover them and act as caps. When those protein
caps are missing, the cell cycle gets disrupted
and may stop altogether, causing premature cell
death. Finally, stress may play a significant role
in how fast telomeres shorten. A study of moth-
ers with chronically ill children showed that
signs of aging were accelerated in the moms of
ill children compared to moms of the same age
with healthy children. The stressed moms had
shortened telomeres and from a cellular point of
view were up to 10 years older than their actual
ages. Although telomerase may someday be part
of treating stress and aging, research indicates
that your best bet may be lowering stress levels
the old-fashioned way: rest and relaxation.

born naturally. In part, the large birth size of clones is due to the fact they
stay in the womb longer than usual. Dolly the cloned sheep, for example, was
born about five days after her birth mother’s “due date.” Offspring not born
shortly after the normal due date (in humans, about two weeks late) are at
great risk for stillbirth and complications, such as difficulty breathing. Clones
tend to have very large placentas (the organ that links fetus to mother for
oxygen and nutrition), which may contribute to their larger size, but the
exact reason for the longer gestation periods is unclear.
The problem with oversize clones is so pervasive that it’s been dubbed large
offspring syndrome, or LOS. Many offspring, including humans, produced
using in vitro fertilization (so-called test tube babies) also suffer from LOS,
suggesting that it’s not necessarily a problem associated with cloning. Instead,
LOS seems to result from manipulation of the embryo. These manipulations
cause changes in the way genes for growth are expressed (see Chapter 10
for more about gene expression). Genomic imprinting occurs when genes are
expressed based on which parent they come from. (For more on genomic
imprinting, jump to the sidebar “It takes two to make a baby.”) In the case of
LOS, what seems to happen is that the genes derived from the most recent
male ancestor tell the fetus to grow faster and bigger than normal. Normally,
genomic imprinting affects less than 1,000 genes (out of 25,000 total genes
found in humans; see Chapter 11). How these “paternal” genes get turned on
is anybody’s guess, but the interaction of sperm with egg during fertilization
is likely part of the answer. The end result of LOS is large offspring that often
suffer from a variety of birth defects and are at risk for certain kinds of
cancer. Estimates of LOS in human children born as a result of in vitro fertil-
ization are about 5 percent. (Normally, LOS occurs in less than 1 percent of
children produced through natural fertilization.)
308
Part IV: Genetics and Your World 
It takes two to make a baby
Needing a mom and a dad to make a baby sounds
like common sense, but the wonders of genetic
engineering suggest otherwise (after all, Dolly
had three mothers and no father). Maternal and
paternal DNA are required for successful repro-
duction — at least by mammals — because of
genomic imprinting. Genomic imprinting was first
discovered in studies with mice. Researchers
created mouse embryos with DNA from either
female or male mice, but not both. Only embryos
with paternal and maternal DNA developed nor-
mally, indicating that both male and female DNA
are required for successful development. In other
studies, mice were engineered to have certain
genes (see Chapter 19 for more on transgenic
animals). The expression of the genes in offspring
of the transgenic mice depended on which par-
ents transmitted the genes. All offspring inherited
the genes, but the genes were expressed only
when the fathers transmitted them. Likewise, cer-
tain genes were expressed only when transmit-
ted by the mothers. Thus, the growth and
development of offspring is regulated by genes
turned on simply because they come from mom
or dad. Those genes then act in concert to regu-
late normal development of the embryo.

Developmental disasters
The percentage of cloning attempts that result in live births is extremely low.
Generally, hundreds of cell transfers are carried out for every one offspring
produced. Most clones perish immediately because they never implant into
the uterus of the gestation mother. Of the embryos that do implant and begin
development, more than half die before birth. In many cases, the placenta is
malformed, preventing the growing fetus from obtaining proper nutrition and
oxygen.
In most cloning attempts, two females are involved. The egg comes from one
female and gets implanted into another female for gestation. Therefore, another
cause of early death may be that the gestation mother rejects the clone as
foreign. In these cases, the gestation mother’s immune system doesn’t recog-
nize the embryo as her own (because it’s not) and secretes antibodies to
destroy it. Antibodies are chemicals produced by the body that interact with
bacteria, viruses, and foreign tissues to fight disease.
Some of the problems suffered by clones may result from the mismatch
between mitochondrial and nuclear DNA. When an oocyte is harvested from
a different female than the somatic cell (see “Using a somatic cell nucleus to
make a clone”), the egg contains roughly 100,000 copies of the egg mother’s
mitochondrial DNA. Unless the donor cell comes from the egg mother’s sister,
the somatic cell nucleus comes from a cell with a different mitochondrial
genome. This mismatch means that the clone isn’t a true clone — its DNA dif-
fers slightly from the donor. Cloned mice with mismatched mitochondrial and
nuclear DNA tend to have decreased growth rates when compared to cloned
mice with matched mitochondrial and nuclear genomes.
The type of donor cell used in cloning also makes a difference in the health of
the resulting clone. When introduced into the oocyte, the donor cell nucleus
gets “reprogrammed” somehow to go from nullipotent to totipotent. Some
cell nuclei seem to be better at resetting to totipotent than others. Almost all
clones whose genomes don’t get reprogrammed perish.
Effects of the environment
Clones are never truly exact copies of the donor organism because genes inter-
act with the environment in unique ways to form phenotype, or physical quali-
ties. If you’ve ever known a set of identical twins, you know twins are very
different from each other. Monozygotic twins have different fingerprints,
develop at different rates, have different preferences, and die at different times.
Being genetically identical doesn’t mean they’re truly, 100 percent identical.
The environment’s role in development is perhaps best illustrated by experi-
ments using plants. Suppose shoots from a single plant are rooted and grown
at different locations on a mountainside. In essence, the plants are clones of
309
Chapter 20: Cloning: There’ll Never Be Another You

the parent plant. If genetic control were perfect, we’d expect identical plants
to perform in identical ways, regardless of environmental conditions.
However, the plants in our experiment grow at very different rates depending
upon their locations. In other words, identical plants perform differently
under different conditions. Likewise, genetically identical mice raised under
exactly the same conditions don’t respond in identical ways to exactly the
same doses of medications.
All organisms respond to their environments in unique and unpredictable
ways. From the very beginning, animals experience unique conditions inside
the womb. Hormonal exposure during pregnancy can have profound effects on
developing organisms. For example, female piglets sandwiched between broth-
ers while in the womb are more aggressive as adults than females that were
situated between sisters. This is because male piglets secrete testosterone —
a hormone that increases aggressive behavior.
Attempts to replicate organisms exactly are doomed to failure. Genetics 
doesn’t control destiny because genes aren’t expressed in predictable ways.
Persons carrying mutations for certain diseases don’t have a 100-percent
probability of developing those diseases (see Chapter 13). Likewise, clones
will not express their genes in precisely the same way as the donor organism.
Add the differences in mitochondrial DNA, in utero conditions (clones usually
develop in a different womb), and time periods to the huge differences
already present, and the only conclusion is that no clone will ever experience
the world in precisely the same way as the donor organism did.
Weighing Both Sides of
the Cloning Debate
The arguments for and against cloning are numerous. In the sections that
follow, I review some of the main points in both the pro and con corners. As
you read, understand that these aren’t my opinions and arguments; I only
summarize what others have argued before me. I try to be balanced and fair
because before you can responsibly take a position on cloning, you need to
know both sides of this controversial topic. And for more information on ethi-
cal considerations in genetics, see Chapter 21.
Arguments for cloning
Like every other scientific discovery, cloning can be used to do a lot of good.
Cloning for medical and therapeutic purposes gives enormous hope that par-
alyzed persons will walk again and that people suffering from previously
incurable conditions such as muscular dystrophy and diabetes will be cured.

Part IV: Genetics and Your World 

Cloning has provided scientists with some important answers about how
genetics works. Prior to these discoveries, the changes that occur from
embryo to adult were believed to cause permanent changes to the organism’s
DNA. Now we know that’s not true. Because all DNA has the potential to
return to totipotence, doctors have the unparalleled opportunity to correct
genetic defects and provide treatment for devastating progressive diseases.
Another plus in the pro-cloning camp is that it may provide genetically
matched organisms that will streamline research into the causes and treat-
ments of diseases such as cancer. Because matched comparisons are scientif-
ically more powerful, fewer animals are needed to conduct experiments. Such
changes are an important advance over current research methods and will
improve conditions for experimental animals.
Advancing knowledge of genetics can provide dramatic benefits not only to
humans, but also to the planet as a whole. Cloning may represent the last
hope for some rare and endangered species. When only a few individuals
remain, cloning may provide additional individuals to allow the population
to survive. Given that the earth is experiencing its largest wave of species
extinctions since ancient times, cloning may be a very significant advance for
conservation biology.
Arguments against cloning
Although cloning represents an enormous opportunity, it’s opportunity
fraught with danger. For the first time in history, humans possess the technol-
ogy to create genetically modified organisms. That capability extends not just
to animals and plants but to humans as well. Furthermore, the genetic diver-
sity that gives the natural world its rich texture is endangered by a unique
threat — that of creating organisms that are genetically identical.
As I discuss in Chapter 17, genetic diversity is extremely important to estab-
lishing and maintaining the health and well-being of populations of organ-
isms. Research shows that genetically diverse populations are more resilient
to environmental stress and better at resisting disease. Thus, creating popu-
lations of genetically similar organisms exposes all organisms to greater
threats of disease. Lack of genetic diversity in populations of other organisms
may ultimately expose humans to threats as well. For example, genetically
identical crops could all fall prey to the same disease and consequently seri-
ously endanger food supplies — this isn’t as far-fetched as it sounds. In fact,
efforts to archive genetically diverse strains of plants are already underway
lest unique genetic characteristics, like disease resistance, are lost.
Furthermore, cloning is fraught with problems for which no good alternatives
exist. For now, all cloning requires oocytes from female organisms. Those
oocytes are obtained by first treating females with large doses of fertility drugs
to stimulate ovulation. Such drugs stress the female’s system enormously and
311
Chapter 20: Cloning: There’ll Never Be Another You

increase the rate of cell turnover in her ovaries. Some studies indicate that the
drugs used for stimulating ovulation expose females to increased risk of ovar-
ian cancer. And the risk doesn’t end there. When eggs are produced, they must
be surgically removed under anesthesia. Regardless of the precautions, the
female organism can and does experience pain. Animals can’t give or withhold
consent, so they’re subjected to these procedures whether they like it or not.
After eggs are harvested and donor cells are fused with them, development of
an embryo begins. The vast majority of cloning attempts, regardless of their
ultimate purpose, result in death of the embryo. Granted, these embryos
have no nerve cells and no consciousness that scientists know of, but never-
theless, living organisms are produced with little or no hope of survival.
If clones are successfully created, their quality of life may be poor. Clones
suffer from a myriad of disorders for which causes are unknown. They may
age prematurely and are likely at risk for disorders that are yet unrecognized
consequences of the methods used in the cloning process. Like the experi-
mental animals used for egg production, cloned animals can’t withhold their
consent and withdraw from study.
The most contentious issue posed by cloning technology is the production of
human clones. As with animals, most cloned human embryos would have no
hope of survival. Women must consent to painful and potentially dangerous
procedures to produce eggs, and some woman must consent to carry the
developing child and risk the emotional trauma of miscarriage or stillbirth.
From an emotional standpoint, children created this way would be geneti-
cally identical to some other person, whether that person is living or dead.
The pressure to be like someone else would undoubtedly be enormous.
Further, because of the genetic similarities to some other individual, parents
may have unrealistic expectations of their cloned offspring. Do individual
humans have a right to genetic uniqueness? It’s a difficult question, but it’s
one we need to answer soon, before human cloning becomes true reality.

and the Ugly
In This Chapter
 Examining the dark side of genetics
 Pushing the envelope of informed consent
 Mapping genetic patterns worldwide
T
he field of genetics grows and changes constantly. If you follow the news,
you’re likely to hear about several new discoveries every week. When it
comes to genetics, the amount of information is bewildering, and the possibil-
ities are endless. If you’ve already read many of the chapters in this book,
you have a taste of the many choices and debates created by the burgeoning
technology surrounding our genes.
With such a fast growing and far-reaching field as genetics, ethical questions
and issues arise around every corner and are interconnected with the applica-
tions and procedures. Throughout this book, I’ve highlighted this interconnect-
edness. I cover animal welfare issues (in the context of cloning) in Chapter 20.
Conservation of the environment and endangered species is a key part of the
discussion of population genetics in Chapter 17. Chapter 19 touches on the
potential dangers — to the environment and to humans — of genetic engineer-
ing. Genetic counseling, including some of the issues surrounding prenatal test-
ing, is the subject of Chapter 12. And Chapter 16 discusses gene therapy as an
experimental and unpredictable form of treatment.
But I couldn’t end the discussion of genetics and your world without some
final comments on the ethical issues genetic advancements raise. In this chap-
ter, you find out how genetics has been misunderstood, misinterpreted, and
misused to cause people harm based on their racial, ethnic, or socioeconomic
status. The rapidly growing field of genetics is contributing to ideas about how
modern humans can mold the future of their offspring, so this chapter dispels
the myth of the designer baby. You discover how information you give out and
receive can be used for and against you. Finally, you gain a better understand-
ing of the next generation of studies based on the Human Genome Project and
the ethical issues that mapping human genetic diversity will bring up.

Going to Extremes with Genetic Racism
One of the biggest hot button issues of all time has to be eugenics. In a nut-
shell, eugenics is the idea that humans should practice selective reproduc-
tion in an effort to “improve” the species. If you read Chapter 19, which
explains how organisms can be genetically engineered, you probably already
have some idea of what eugenics in the modern age might entail (transgenic
made-to-order babies, perhaps?). Historically, the most blatant examples of
eugenics are genocidal activities the world over. (Perhaps the most infamous
example occurred in Nazi Germany during the 1930s and 1940s.)
The story of eugenics begins with the otherwise laudable Francis Galton, who
coined the term in 1883. (Galton is best remembered for his contribution to
law enforcement: He invented the process used to identify persons by their
fingerprints. Check out Chapter 18 for more on the genetic version of finger-
printing.) In direct and vocal opposition to the United States Constitution,
Galton was quite sure that all men were not created equal (I emphasize here
that he was particularly fixated on men; women were of no consequence in his
day). Instead, Galton believed that some men were quite superior to others.
To this end, he attempted to prove that “genius” is inherited. The view that
superior intelligence is heritable is still widely held despite abundant evidence
to the contrary. For example, twin studies conducted as far back as the 1930s
show that genetically identical persons are not intellectually identical.
Galton gave eugenics its name, but his ideas weren’t unique or revolutionary.
During the early 20th century, as understanding of Mendelian genetics
(see Chapter 3) gathered steam, many people viewed eugenics as a highly
admirable field of study. Charles Davenport was one such person. Davenport
holds dubious distinction as the father of the American eugenics movement
(one of his eugenics texts is subtitled, “The science of human improvement by
better breeding”). The basis of Davenport’s idea is that “degenerate” people
shouldn’t reproduce. This notion arose from something called degeneracy
theory (not to be confused with the degeneracy of the genetic code, which is
something else altogether; see Chapter 9). Degeneracy theory posits that
“unfit” humans acquire certain undesirable traits because of “bad environ-
ments” and then pass on these traits genetically. To these eugenicists, unfit
included “shiftlessness,” “feeblemindedness,” and poverty, among other things.
While the British, including Galton, advocated perpetuating good breeding
(along with wealth and privilege), many American eugenicists focused their
attention on preventing cacogenics, which is the erosion of genetic quality.
Therefore, they advocated forcibly sterilizing people judged undesirable or
merely inconvenient. Shockingly, the forcible sterilization laws of this era
have never been overturned, and until the 1970s, it was still common practice
to sterilize mentally ill persons without their consent — an estimated 60,000
314
Part IV: Genetics and Your World 

people in the United States suffered this atrocity. Some societies have taken
this sick idea a step further and murdered the “unfit” in an effort to remove
them and their genes permanently.
Sadly, violent forms of eugenics, such as genocide, rape, and forced steriliza-
tion, are still advocated and practiced all over the world. But not all forms
of eugenics are as easy to recognize as these extreme examples. To some
degree, eugenics lies at the heart of most of the other ethical quandaries
addressed in this chapter. In addition, it only requires a little imagination to
see how gene therapy (Chapter 16), gene transfer (Chapter 19), or DNA fin-
gerprinting (Chapter 18) can be abused to advance the cause of eugenics.
Taking Steps to Create Designer Babies
One of the more contentious issues with a root in eugenics stems from a com-
bination of prenatal diagnosis and the fantasy of the perfect child to create a
truly extreme makeover — designer babies. In theory, a designer baby may
be made-to-order according to a parent’s desire for a particular sex, hair and
eye color, and maybe even athletic ability.
The myth of designer babies
The term designer baby gets tossed around quite a bit these days. In essence,
the term is associated with genetically made-to-order offspring. As of this writ-
ing, neither the technology nor sufficient knowledge of the human genome
exist to make the designer baby a reality.
The fantasy of the designer baby, like cloning (see Chapter 20), rests on the
fallacy of biological determinism (which, by the way, is what eugenics bases
some of its lies on, too; jump back to “Going to Extremes with Genetic
Racism” to find out about eugenics). Biological determinism assumes that
genes are expressed in precise, repeatable ways — in other words, genetics is
identity is genetics. However, this assumption isn’t true. Gene expression is
highly dependent upon environment, among other things (see Chapter 10 for
more details about how gene expression works).
Furthermore, the in vitro fertilization process that plays a role in current-day
applications of the science in question (see the next section) is a very dicey
and difficult process at best — just ask any couple who’s gone through it in an
effort to get pregnant. In vitro procedures are extremely expensive, invasive,
and painful, and women must take large quantities of strong and potentially
dangerous fertility medications to produce a sufficient number of eggs. And in
the end, the vast majority of fertilizations don’t result in pregnancies.
315
Chapter 21: Ethics: The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly

The reality of the science: 
Prenatal diagnosis
So where does the myth of designer babies come from? Using procedures
similar to those leading up to cloning (covered in Chapter 20), preimplantation
genetic diagnosis, or PGD, is performed before a fertilized egg implants in the
womb. Although it’s true that PGD opens the remote possibility of creating
transgenic humans using the same technology used to create transgenic
animals (see Chapter 19 for details), the likelihood of PGD becoming common-
place is extremely remote.
The process of PGD is technologically complicated. First, unfertilized eggs
are harvested from a female donor. In vitro fertilization (the process to pro-
duce the so-called test-tube baby) is performed, and then the fertilized eggs
are screened for mutations and other genetic disorders. In a few rare cases,
desperate parents have created embryos this way specifically to look for
genetic compatibility with preexisting offspring — the plan being to conceive
a sibling who can provide stem cells or bone marrow to save the life of a
living sibling suffering from an otherwise untreatable disease. Saving the
lives of living children undoubtedly is a laudable goal; the problem arises
with what’s done with the fertilized eggs that don’t meet the desired criteria
(if, for example, they don’t have the desired tissue match). Even if inserted
into the mother’s uterus, the vast majority of these fertilized eggs would
never implant and thus not survive. Although lack of implantation is also
true when conception occurs naturally, it’s still a very tough call to decide
the fate of extra embryos. Options include donation to other couples, dona-
tion for research purposes, or destruction.
PGD and other forms of prenatal diagnoses allow parents the choice to pre-
vent, alleviate, or reduce suffering (their own or someone else’s). But like
deciding the fate of extra embryos, this is very deep water. Without getting
too philosophical, suffering is a highly personal experience; that is, what con-
stitutes suffering to one person may look relatively okay to someone else. One
example of relative suffering that comes up a lot is hereditary deafness. If a
deaf couple chooses prenatal diagnosis, what’s the most desirable outcome?
On one hand, a deaf child shares the worldview of his or her parents. On the
other hand, a hearing child fits into the world of non-deaf people more easily.
By now, you see how complex the issues surrounding prenatal diagnosis are. It
seems clear that right answers, if there are any, will be very hard to come by.
Toying with Informed Consent
Informed consent is a sticky ethical and legal issue. Basically, the idea is that
a person can only truly make a decision about having a procedure when he
or she is fully apprised of all the facts, risks, and rewards. Informed consent
316
Part IV: Genetics and Your World 

can only be given by the person receiving the procedure or by that person’s
legal guardian. Generally, guardianship is established in cases where the
recipient of the procedure is too young to make decisions for him or herself
or is mentally incapacitated in some way; presumably, guardians have the
best interests of their wards at heart.
Three major issues exist in the debate over informed consent:
 Genetic testing can be carried out on embryos, the deceased, and sam-
ples obtained from anyone during the simplest of medical procedures.
 Experimental genetic treatments (that is, gene therapies; see Chapter 16)
have, by their very nature, unpredictable outcomes, making risk difficult
to quantify to prospective participants.
 After tissue samples are obtained and genetic profiling is done, informa-
tion storage and privacy assurance are problematic.
Placing restrictions on genetic testing
Genetic testing in the forms of DNA fingerprinting, SNP analysis (see Chap-
ter 18), and sequencing (see Chapter 11) are now routine, fast, and relatively
cheap. Massive amounts of information — from an individual’s sex to his or
her racial and ethnic makeup — can be gleaned from even a very tiny sample
of tissue. The presence of mutations for inherited disorders can also be
detected. Given that your DNA has so much personal information stored in
it, shouldn’t you have complete control over whether or not you’re tested?
The answer to this question is becoming more and more contentious as the
definitions of, and limits to, informed consent are explored. The rights of
persons both living and dead are at stake.
Consider the case of Abraham Lincoln. Lincoln was, as you probably already
know, president of the United States from 1861 until his assassination in 1865.
When he died, an autopsy was performed, and his hair, bone samples, and
even blood samples were carefully preserved. (In the past, doctors embed-
ded such samples in paraffin wax, which serves as a remarkably safe storage
vault. Wax-stored lung tissue from flu victims of the 1918 epidemic still con-
tains viable DNA, for example.) Lincoln was notably very tall and thin, a body
type shared by persons with Marfan syndrome. Marfan is a hereditary disor-
der that affects the skeletal and cardiovascular systems; affected persons are
generally very tall and often suffer significant and sometimes fatal heart
abnormalities. Given Lincoln’s stature, arthritis, and deep depressions, many
experts wonder if he had Marfan. Given that his tissue samples are available,
testing would be an easy way to clear things up once and for all. Except that
Lincoln’s dead and has no direct descendents who can give consent. Is the
academic need-to-know sufficient? What are the rights of the deceased?
317
Chapter 21: Ethics: The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly

The descendents of Thomas Jefferson consented to genetic testing in 1998 to
settle a long-standing controversy about Jefferson’s relationship with one of
his slaves, Sally Hemings (see Chapter 18 for the full story). In the Jefferson
case, though, the matter was more than just academic curiosity because the
right to burial in the family cemetery at Monticello was at stake.
The issue of informed consent, or lack thereof, is complicated by the ability
to store tissue for long periods of time. In some cases, informed consent was
given by patients or their guardians for certain tests but didn’t include tests
that hadn’t yet been developed. Some institutions routinely practice long-
term tissue storage, making informed consent a frequent point of contention.
For example, a children’s hospital in Britain was recently taken to task over
storage of organs that were obtained during autopsies but weren’t returned
for internment with the rest of the body. Parents of the affected deceased had
given consent for the autopsies but not the retention of tissues.
Biologists also use stored tissue to create cell-lines. Cell-lines are living tissues
that are growing in culture tubes for research purposes. The original cell
donors are often dead, usually of the disease under study. Cell-lines aren’t
that hard to make and maintain (if you know what you’re doing), but the
creation of cell-lines raises the question of whether the original donor has
ownership rights to cells descended from his or her tissue. Cell-lines some-
times result in patents for lucrative treatments; should donors or their heirs
get a royalty? (A court decision in California said “No.”)
Practicing safe genetic treatment
If you’ve ever had to sign a consent for treatment form, you know it can be a
sobering experience. Almost all such forms include some phrase that com-
municates the possibility of death. With a gulp, most of us sign off and hope
for the best. For routine procedures and treatments, our faith is usually
repaid with survival. Experimental treatments are harder to gauge, though,
and fully informing someone about possible outcomes is very difficult.
The 1999 case of Jesse Gelsinger (covered in Chapter 16) brought the prob-
lem of informed consent and experimental treatment into a glaring, harsh
light. Jesse died after receiving an experimental treatment for a hereditary
disorder that, by itself, wasn’t likely to kill him. His treatment took place to
provide clinical trials of the particular therapy on relatively healthy patients
and work out any difficulties before initiating treatments on patients for
whom the disease would, without a doubt, be fatal (in this case, infants
homozygous for the disorder). What researchers knew about all the possible
outcomes and what the Gelsinger family was told before treatment began is
debatable.
318
Part IV: Genetics and Your World 

Almost every article on gene therapy published since the Gelsinger case makes
mention of it. In fact, most researchers in the field divide the development
of gene therapies into two categories: before and after Gelsinger. Sadly,
Gelsinger’s death probably contributed very little to the broader understand-
ing of gene therapy. Instead, the impacts of the Gelsinger case are that clinical
trails are now harder to initiate, criteria for patient inclusion and exclusion are
heightened, and disclosure and reporting requirements are far more stringent.
These changes are basically a double-edged sword: New regulations protect
patients’ rights and simultaneously decrease the likelihood that treatments will
be developed to help those who desperately need them. Like so many ethical
issues, a safe and effective solution may prove elusive.
Doling out information access
Another issue in the informed consent debate relates to privacy. When
genetic tests are conducted, the data recorded often includes detailed med-
ical histories and other personal information, all of which aids researchers or
physicians in the interpretation of the genetic data obtained. So far, so good.
But what happens to all that information? Who sees it? Where’s it stored?
And for how long?
Privacy is a big deal, particularly in American culture. Laws exist to protect
one’s private medical information, financial status, and juvenile criminal
records (if any). Individuals are protected from unwarranted searches and
surveillance, and they have the right to exclude unwanted persons from their
private property. Genetic information is likely to fall under existing medical
privacy laws, but there’s one twist: Genetic information contains an element
of the future, not just the past.
When you carry a mutation for susceptibility to breast cancer, you have a
greater likelihood of developing breast cancer than someone who doesn’t
have the allele (see Chapter 14). A breast cancer allele doesn’t guarantee
you’ll develop the cancer, though; it just increases the probability. If you were
to be tested for the breast cancer allele and found to have it, that information
would become part of your medical record. Besides your doctor and appro-
priate medical personnel, who might learn about your condition? Your insur-
ance company, that’s who. So far, situations such as this haven’t presented a
big problem because few people have had genetic tests. Genetic tests are
expensive and aren’t part of routine healthcare, but as technology advances
and gets cheaper (like microarrays; see Chapter 23), genetic testing is likely
to become more common. And that shift may be both a blessing and a curse.
As a patient, knowing that you have a genetic mutation is a really good thing
because the condition may be treatable or early detection screening may
help you prevent more serious developments. For example, cancers that are
319
Chapter 21: Ethics: The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly

caught early have far better prognoses than those diagnosed in later stages.
However, knowing about a genetic mutation may give insurance companies
and other healthcare providers the chance to issue or cancel policies, thus
unfairly limiting your access to healthcare or employment. Sadly, at least one
employer has been caught attempting to test workers for genetic predisposi-
tions to certain injuries (in this case, carpal tunnel syndrome, a repetitive
stress injury to the hands and arms) without the employees’ knowledge —
clearly, a violation of informed consent.
Genetic privacy issues also feed into the controversies surrounding the
Human Genome Project and efforts to characterize human population genet-
ics. Critics fear that if certain mutations or health problems are genetically
linked to groups of people, discrimination and bias will result. Lawmakers
take these fears seriously, but as yet, no federal laws exist to specifically pro-
tect your genetic privacy.
Genetic Property Rights
According to U.S. law, a patent gives the patent owner exclusive rights to man-
ufacture and sell his or her invention for a certain length of time (usually 20
years). That may not sound like a big deal, but what makes patents scary is
that companies are patenting genes — DNA sequences that hold the instruc-
tions for life. And it’s not just any genes, either. They’re patenting your genes.
Patents are granted to inventors, but the people (or companies) holding gene
patents didn’t invent the genes that naturally occur in living organisms.
According to most legal experts, genes are “unpatentable products of nature.”
Yet so far, American and European patenting authorities have viewed genes in
the same legal light as manmade chemicals. Generally, patent-holding compa-
nies sequence the genes and convert them to another form called cDNA (c
means complementary; see Chapter 16 for coverage of translation). Then a
patent is sought on the cDNA rather than the gene itself. Another approach
to the patenting process is that the company discovers a gene (or a disease-
associated version of it) and then invents products such as diagnostic tests
that have something to do with the gene.
Just how a company can own and exercise exclusive rights over your genes is
a little hard to understand. An example of how gene patenting works comes
from the invention of the process of PCR (see Chapter 22 for the whole tale).
The process uses an enzyme that’s produced by a very special sort of bacte-
ria. The gene that codes for that enzyme (called Taq polymerase, pronounced
tack) is easily moved into other bacteria, such as E. coli, using recombinant
DNA techniques (explained in Chapter 16). This means that E. coli can pro-
duce the enzyme that can then be used to run PCR. But if any other geneticist
uses that gene to make Taq polymerase, a royalty must be paid to the com-
pany that patented it. Not surprisingly, this company is now the biggest man-
ufacturer of Taq in the world, raking in profits in the billions of dollars.
320
Part IV: Genetics and Your World 

Here are examples of how ugly the gene-patenting game can get:
 In 2001, an American company got a European patent for BRCA1, the
breast cancer gene (see Chapter 14 for a full description of this mutation).
This gene causes cancer, and presumably no one would want to purchase
a case of breast cancer. So why patent it? Because the company holding
the patent can charge large sums to test people to determine whether or
not they carry the mutation.
 A large drug company holds a patent on a gene test that can determine
whether the company’s product will work for certain persons. The com-
pany refuses to actually develop the test or let anyone else have a crack
at it because doing so may reduce sales of the medication in question.
 Companies patent disease-causing bacteria and viral genes for the same
reasons — to block diagnosis and treatment — until a hefty licensing fee
has been paid.
Such use of genetic patents impedes both research to combat disease as well
as access to healthcare. Because of these kinds of manipulations, gene
patents are beginning to meet with strong and vocal opposition.
Gene-patenting policies may endanger your health in other ways as well.
 When commercial outfits get genetic information, they treat it as their
personal property. Gene sequences and experiment results therefore
aren’t always reported in the appropriate scientific literature (and
thus, aren’t subjected to review and verification by experts in the field).
In order to market their products, these companies must go through
the regulatory process mandated by the government to ensure con-
sumer safety, but that regulatory review process has suffered noticeable
shortcomings of late — particularly when products are allowed to pass
muster while some conflict of interest is at work (think stock options,
as was the case in shake-ups at the U.S. National Institutes of Heath
in 2005).
 Sadly, universities have gotten in on the act. In one instance, the search
for the gene responsible for autism was held up because several univer-
sities refused to share information with, of all people, the parents of
autistic children. Each university wanted to be the first to (you guessed
it) patent the autism gene. As a result, an independent foundation was
established to create a public repository for genetic information about
autism because such actions are a direct assault on the openness of the
scientific research itself.
The laws governing gene patents may change (and, perhaps, the sooner the
better), but the current state of things makes me wonder if you or I will get
hauled to court for patent infringement when it’s discovered that one of our
genes makes some potentially profitable enzyme.

Ten Defining Events in Genetics
In This Chapter

M
any milestones define the history of genetics. This chapter focuses on
nine that aren’t covered in other chapters of the book, plus one that is
(the Human Genome Project is so important that it gets covered in Chapter 11
and here, too). The events listed here appear roughly in order of historical
occurrence.
The Publication of Darwin’s
Origin of Species
Earthquakes have aftershocks, little mini-earthquakes that rattle around after
the main quake. Events in history sometimes cause aftershocks, too. The
publication of one man’s life’s work is one such event. From the moment it hit
the shelves in 1856, Charles Darwin’s Origin of Species was deeply controver-
sial (and still is).
Darwin arrived at his conclusions after years of studying plants and animals all
over the world. The concept of evolution is elegantly simple: Individual organ-
isms vary in their ability to survive and reproduce. For example, a sudden cold
snap occurs, and most individuals of a certain bird species die because they
can’t tolerate the rapid drop in temperature. But individuals of the same
species that can tolerate the unexpected freeze survive and reproduce. As
long as the ability to deal with rapid temperature drops is heritable, the trait is
passed to future generations, and more and more individuals inherit the trait.
When groups of individuals are isolated from each other, they wind up being
subjected to different sorts of events (such as weather patterns). After many,
many years, stepwise changes in the sorts of traits that are inherited based
on events like a sudden freeze accumulate to the point that populations with
common ancestors become separate species. Darwin concluded that all life on
earth is related by inheritance in this fashion and thus has a common origin.

What Darwin lacked was a convincing explanation for how advantageous
traits are inherited. Yet, the explanation was literally at his fingertips. Mendel
figured out the laws of inheritance at about the same time that Darwin was
working on his book (see Chapter 3). Apparently, Darwin failed to read
Mendel’s paper — he scrawled notes on the papers immediately preceding
and following Mendel’s paper but left Mendel’s unmarked. There’s no evidence
from Darwin’s copious notes that he was even aware of Mendel’s work.
Even without knowledge of how inheritance works, Darwin accurately sum-
marized three principles that are confirmed by genetics:
 Variation is random and unpredictable. This principle is confirmed by
studies of mutation (see Chapter 13).
 Variation is heritable (can be passed on from one generation to the
next). Mendel’s own research — and thousands of studies over the past
century — confirms heritability. With DNA fingerprinting, heritable
genetic variation can be traced directly from parent to offspring (see
Chapter 18 for how paternity tests use heritable genetic markers to
determine which male fathered which child).
 Variation changes in frequency over the course of time. Hardy’s and
Weinberg’s principle formalized this concept in the form of population
genetics in the early 1900s (see Chapter 17). Since the 1970s, genetic
studies using DNA sequencing (along with other methods) have con-
firmed that genetic variation within populations changes due to mutation,
accidents, and geographic isolation, to name only a few causes.
Regardless of how you view it, the publication of Darwin’s Origin of Species is
pivotal in the history of genetics — and vice versa. Variation is the heart and
soul of both disciplines. If no genetic variation existed, all life on earth would
be precisely identical; variation gives the world its rich texture and complex-
ity. And it’s what makes you wonderfully unique.
The Rediscovery of Mendel’s Work
In 1866, Gregor Mendel wrote a summary of the results of his gardening
experiments with peas (detailed in Chapter 3). His work was published in
the scientific journal, Versuche Pflanzen Hybriden, where it gathered dust
for nearly 40 years. Although Mendel wasn’t big on self-promotion, he sent
copies of his paper to two well-known scientists of his time. One copy
remains missing; the other was found in what amounts to an unopened
envelope — the pages were never cut. (Old printing practices resulted in
pages being folded together; the only way to read the paper was to cut the
pages apart.) Thus, despite the fact that his findings were published and
326
Part V: The Part of Tens 

distributed (though limitedly), no one grasped the magnitude of Mendel’s
discovery (not even Darwin read it!). Mendel’s work went unnoticed until
three botanists, Hugo de Vries, Erich von Tschermak, and Carl Correns, all re-
invented Mendel’s wheel, so to speak.
These three men conducted experiments that were very similar to Mendel’s.
Their conclusions were identical — all three “discovered” the laws of hered-
ity. Hugo de Vries found Mendel’s work referenced in a paper published in
1881. (De Vries coined the term mutation, by the way.) The author of the 1881
paper, a man by the unfortunate name of Focke, summarized Mendel’s find-
ings but didn’t have a clue as to what they meant. De Vries correctly inter-
preted Mendel’s work and cited it in his own paper, which was published in
1900. Shortly thereafter, Tschermak and Correns also discovered Mendel’s
publication through De Vries’s published works and indicated that their own
independent findings confirmed Mendel’s conclusions as well.
William Bateson is perhaps the great hero of this story. He was already
incredibly influential by the time he read De Vries’s paper citing Mendel, and
unlike many around him, he recognized that Mendel’s laws of inheritance
were revolutionary and absolutely correct. Bateson became an ardent voice
spreading the word. He coined the terms genetics, allele (shortened from the
original allelomorph), homozygote, and heterozygote. Bateson was also
responsible for the discovery of linkage (see Chapter 4), which was experi-
mentally confirmed later by Morgan and Bridges.
The Transforming Principle
Frederick Griffith wasn’t working to discover DNA. The year was 1928, and the
memory of the deadly flu epidemic of 1918 was still fresh in everyone’s minds.
Griffith was studying pneumonia in an effort to prevent future epidemics. He
was particularly interested in why some strains of bacteria caused illness and
other seemingly identical strains did not. To get to the bottom of the issue, he
conducted a series of experiments using two strains of the same species of
bacteria, Streptococcus pneumonia. The two strains looked very different when
grown in a Petri dish because one was smooth and the other lumpy (he called
it “rough”). When Griffith injected smooth bacteria into mice, they died; rough
bacteria, on the other hand, was harmless.
To figure out why one strain of bacteria was deadly and the other harmless,
Griffith conducted a series of experiments. He injected some mice with heat-
killed smooth bacteria (which turned out to be harmless) and others with
heat-killed smooth in combination with living rough bacteria. This combo
proved deadly to the mice. Griffith quickly figured out that something in the
smooth bacteria transformed rough bacteria into a killer. But what? For lack of
anything better, he called the responsible factor the transforming principle
(which now sounds like a good title for a diet book).
327
Chapter 22: Ten Defining Events in Genetics

Oswald Avery, Maclyn McCarty, and Colin MacLeod teamed up in the 1940s
to discover that Griffith’s transforming principle was actually DNA. This trio
made the discovery by a dogged process of elimination. They showed that
fats and proteins didn’t do the trick; only the DNA of smooth bacteria pro-
vided live rough bacteria with the needed ingredient to get nasty. Their
results were published in 1944, and like Mendel’s work nearly a century
before, were largely rejected. It wasn’t until Erwin Chargaff came along
that the transforming principle started to get the appreciation it deserved.
Chargaff was so impressed that he changed his entire research focus to DNA.
Chargaff eventually determined the ratios of bases in DNA that helped lead
to Watson and Crick’s momentous discovery of DNA’s double helix structure
(flip back to Chapter 6 for all the details).
The Discovery of Jumping Genes
By all accounts, Barbara McClintock was both brilliant and a little odd. She
lived and worked alone for most of her life. Her career began in the early 1930s
and took her into a man’s world — very few women worked in the sciences in
her day. McClintock was unorthodox in both her research and her outlook; a
friend once described her as “not fooled or foolable.”
In 1931, McClintock worked with another woman, Harriet Creighton, to
demonstrate that genes are located on chromosomes. This fact sounds so
self-evident now, but back then, it was a revolutionary idea. Creighton and
McClintock showed that corn chromosomes recombined during meiosis (see
Chapter 2 for the scoop on meiosis). By tracking the inheritance of various
traits, they figured out which genes were getting moved during translocation
events (see Chapter 15). Translocations hook up chunks of chromosomes
in places where they don’t belong. Chromosomes with translocations look
very different from normal chromosomes, making it easy to track their
inheritance. By linking physical traits to certain parts of one odd-looking
chromosome, Creighton and McClintock demonstrated that crossover events
between chromosomes moved genes from one chromosome to another.
McClintock’s contribution to genetics goes beyond locating genes on chromo-
somes, though. She also discovered traveling bits of DNA, sometimes known
as jumping genes (see Chapter 10 for more). In 1948, McClintock, working
independently, published her results demonstrating that certain genes of
corn could hop around from one chromosome to another without transloca-
tion. Her announcement triggered little reaction at first. It’s not that people
thought McClintock was wrong, she was just so far ahead of the curve that
her fellow geneticists couldn’t understand her findings. Alfred Sturtevant
(who was responsible for the discovery of gene mapping) once said, “I didn’t
understand one word she said, but if she says it is so, it must be so!” It took
328
Part V: The Part of Tens 

nearly 40 years before the genetics world caught up with Barbara McClintock
and awarded her the Nobel Prize for Medicine in 1983. By then, jumping
genes had been discovered in many organisms (including humans). Feisty to
the end, this grand dame of genetics passed away in 1992 at the age of 90.
The Birth of DNA Sequencing
So many events in the history of genetics lay a foundation for other events
to follow. Federick Sanger’s invention of chain-reaction DNA sequencing
(explained in Chapter 11) is one of those foundational events. In 1980, Sanger
shared his second Nobel Prize (in Chemistry) with Walter Gilbert for their work
on DNA. Sanger had already earned a Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1958 for his
pioneering work on the structure of the protein insulin. (Insulin is produced by
your pancreas and regulates blood sugar; its absence is the cause of diabetes.)
Sanger figured out the entire process used for DNA sequencing. Every single
genetics project that has anything to do with DNA uses Sanger’s method. Chain-
reaction sequencing, as Sanger’s method is called, uses the same mechanics as
replication in your cells (see Chapter 7 for a rundown of replication). Sanger
figured out that he could control the DNA building process by snipping off one
oxygen molecule from the building blocks of DNA. The resulting method allows
identification of every base, in order, along a DNA strand, sparking a revolution
in the understanding of how your genes work. This process is responsible for
the Human Genome Project, DNA fingerprinting (see Chapter 18), genetic engi-
neering (see Chapter 19), and gene therapy (see Chapter 16).
The Invention of PCR
In 1985, while driving along a California highway in the middle of the night,
Kary Mullis had a brainstorm about how to carry out DNA replication in a
tube (see Chapter 7 for the scoop on replication). His idea led to the invention
of polymerase chain reaction (PCR), a pivotal point in the history of genetics.
The entire process of how PCR is used in DNA fingerprinting is detailed in
Chapter 18. In essence, PCR acts like a copier for DNA. Even the tiniest snippet
of DNA can be copied. This concept is important because, so far, technology
isn’t sophisticated enough to examine one DNA molecule at a time. Many
copies of the same molecule are needed before enough is present to be
detected and studied. Without PCR, large amounts of DNA are needed to gener-
ate a DNA fingerprint, but at many crime scenes, only tiny amounts of DNA are
present. PCR is the powerful tool now used in every crime lab in the country to
detect the DNA left behind at crime scenes and to generate DNA fingerprints.
329
Chapter 22: Ten Defining Events in Genetics

Mullis’s bright idea turned into a billion dollar industry. Although he report-
edly was paid a paltry $10,000 for his invention, he received the Nobel Prize
for Chemistry in 1993 (a sort of consolation prize).
The Development of Recombinant 
DNA Technology
In 1970, Hamilton O. Smith discovered restriction enzymes, which act as chem-
ical cleavers to chop DNA into pieces at very specific points. As part of other
research, Smith put bacteria and a bacteria-attacking virus together. The bac-
teria didn’t go down without a fight — instead, it produced an enzyme that
chopped the viral DNA into pieces, effectively destroying the invading virus
altogether. Smith determined that the enzyme, now known as Hind II (named
for the bacteria Haemophilus influenzae Rd), cuts DNA every time it finds
certain bases all in a row and cuts between the same two bases every time.
This fortuitous (and completely accidental!) discovery was just what was
needed to spark a revolution in the study of DNA. Some restriction enzymes
make offset cuts in DNA, leaving single-stranded ends. The single-strand bits
of DNA allow geneticists to “cut-and-paste” pieces of DNA together in novel
ways, forming the entire basis of what is now known as recombinant DNA
technology. Gene therapy (see Chapter 16), the creation of genetically engi-
neered organisms (see Chapter 19), and practically every other advance in
the field of genetics these days all depend on the ability to cut DNA into
pieces without disabling the genes and then put the genes into new places —
a feat made possible thanks to restriction enzymes.
Today, about 3,000 restriction enzymes are being used to help map genes on
chromosomes, determine the function of genes, and manipulate DNA for diag-
nosis and treatment of disease. Smith shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or
Medicine in 1978 with two other geneticists, Dan Nathans and Werner Arber,
for their joint contributions to the discovery of restriction enzymes.
The Invention of DNA Fingerprinting
Sir Alec Jeffreys has put thousands of wrongdoers behind bars. Almost single-
handedly, he’s also set hundreds of innocent people free from prison. Not bad
for a guy who spends most of his time in the genetics lab. Jeffreys invented
DNA fingerprinting in 1985. By examining the patterns made by human DNA
after it was diced up by restriction enzymes, Jeffreys realized that every
person’s DNA produces a slightly different number of various sized fragments
(which number in the thousands).
330
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Jeffreys’s invention has seen a number of refinements since its inception. PCR
and the use of STRs (short tandem repeats; see Chapter 18) have replaced
the use of restriction enzymes. Modern methods of DNA fingerprinting are
highly repeatable and extremely accurate, meaning that a DNA fingerprint
can be stored much like a fingerprint impression from your fingertip can.
More than 100 laboratories in the United States alone now make use of the
methods pioneered by Jeffreys. The information generated by these labs is
housed in a huge database hosted by the FBI, granting any police department
quick access to information that can help match criminals to crimes.
In 1994, Queen Elizabeth II knighted Jeffreys for his contributions to law
enforcement and his accomplishments in genetics.
The Explanation of Developmental
Genetics
As I explain in Chapter 11, every cell in your body has a full set of genetic
instructions to make all of you. The master plan of how an entire organism is
built from genetic instructions remained a mystery until 1980, when Christiane
Nüsslein-Volhard and Eric Wieschaus identified the genes that control the
whole body plan during fly development.
Fruit flies and other insects are constructed of interlocking pieces, or seg-
ments. A group of genes (collectively called segmentation genes) tell the cells
which body segments go where. These genes, along with others, give direc-
tions like top and bottom and front and back as well as the order of body
regions in between. Nüsslein-Volhard and Wieschaus made their discovery
by mutating genes and looking for the effects of the “broken” genes. When
segmentation genes get mutated, the fly ends up lacking whole sections of
important body parts or certain pairs of organs.
A whole different set of genes (called homeotic genes) control the placement
of all the fly’s organs and appendages, such as wings, legs, eyes, and so on.
One such gene is eyeless. Contrary to what would seem logical, eyeless actu-
ally codes for normal eye development. Using the same recombinant DNA
techniques made possible by restriction enzymes (see the section “The
Development of Recombinant DNA Technology” earlier in this chapter),
Nüsslein-Volhard and Wieschaus moved eyeless to different chromosomes
where it could be turned on in cells in which it was normally turned off. The
resulting flies grew eyes in all sorts of strange locations — on their wings,
legs, butts, you name it. This research showed that, working together, seg-
mentation and homeotic genes put all the parts in all the right places. Humans
have versions of these genes, too; your body-plan genes were discovered by
comparing fruit fly genes to human DNA (see Chapter 11 for how the genomes
of organisms affect you).
331
Chapter 22: Ten Defining Events in Genetics

The Work of Francis Collins and
the Human Genome Project
In 1989, Francis Collins and Lap-Chee Tsui identified the single gene responsi-
ble for cystic fibrosis. The very next year, the Human Genome Project (HGP)
officially got underway. A double-doctor (that is, a doc with an MD and PhD),
Collins later replaced James Watson as the head the National Human Genome
Research Institute in the United States and supervised the race to sequence
the entire human genome from start to finish.
Collins is one of the true heroes of modern genetics. He kept the HGP ahead
of schedule and under budget. He continues to champion the right to free
access to all the HGP data, making him a courageous opponent of gene patents
and other practices that restrict access to discovery and healthcare, and he’s
a staunch defender of genetic privacy (see Chapter 21 for more on these sub-
jects). Although the human genome is still bits and pieces away from being
fully and completely sequenced, the project wouldn’t have been a success
without the tireless work of Dr. Collins. Still an active gene hunter, his lab is
now searching out the genes responsible for adult-onset diabetes.

Chapter 23
Ten of the Hottest Issues
in Genetics
In This Chapter
 Following changes in genetics
 Keeping an eye out for the next big things
G
enetics is a field that grows and changes with every passing day. The
hottest journals in the field (Nature and Science) are full of new discov-
eries each and every week. This chapter shines the spotlight on ten of the
hottest topics and next big things in this ever-changing scientific landscape.
Pharmacogenomics
The fourth biggest cause of death in the United States is adverse reactions to
medications. Up to 100,000 people die each year from something that’s meant
to help them. Why? The tool being used to answer that question is pharma-
cogenomics, the analysis of the human genome and heredity to determine
how drugs work in individual people. The idea is that the reason certain
people have adverse reactions and others don’t lies somewhere in their DNA.
If a simple test could be developed to detect these DNA differences, the
wrong drugs would never be prescribed in the first place. (Oddly, this idea
sometimes doesn’t go over well with drug companies; for more on the con-
nection between the two, check out Chapter 21.) The overarching goal of
pharmacogenomics is a new brand of highly personalized medicine that can
be designed to fit the unique genetic makeup of each individual patient.
That’s the good news. The bad news is that nobody knows how many genes
are involved in drug reactions, and most of the genes that are involved haven’t
even been discovered yet. And there are some ticklish privacy issues that
have to be addressed, too (flip back to Chapter 21). So, pharmacogenomics
may get a lot of attention, but tailor-made meds are still a long way off.

Stem Cell Research
Stem cells may hold the key to curing brain and spinal cord injuries. They
may be part of the cure for cancer. These little wonders may be the magic
bullet to solving all sorts of medical problems, but they’re at the center of
controversies so big that their potential remains untested. Stem cells are hot
research topics because they’re totipotent. Totipotence means that stem cells
can turn into any kind of tissue, from brain to muscle to bone, just to name a
few. Not too surprisingly, stem cells are what undifferentiated embryos are
made of; that is, a fertilized egg, shortly after it starts dividing, is composed
entirely of stem cells. At a certain point during development, all the cells get
their assignments (“You, you’re going to be an eye!”), and totipotence is long
gone (except for DNA, which retains surprising flexibility — DNA’s totipo-
tence is what allows cloning to work; see Chapter 20).
You’ve probably guessed (or already knew) that the source of stem cells for
research is embryonic tissue — and therein lies the rub. As of this writing,
researchers haven’t found a way to harvest stem cells without sacrificing the
embryo in the process. Stem cells can be collected from adults (these stem
cells are found in various places, including your blood), but adult stem cells
lack some of the totipotent potential of embryonic cells and are present in
very low numbers. The lack of totipotence and low copy numbers make
using adult stem cells problematic. Nonetheless, adult stem cells may work
better than embryonic ones for therapeutic purposes because they can be
harvested from the patient in question, modified, and returned to the patient,
eliminating the chance of tissue rejection. (For the lowdown on gene therapy,
see Chapter 16.) A potential compromise may come from collecting the cells
from an umbilical cord after a child is born; these cells are better than adult
stem cells. Stem cells in one form or another may find their way into modern
medicine, but for now, moral and ethical opposition to the use of embryonic
cells stymies stem cell research because most of it depends on the use of
embryonic tissues.
Genetics of Aging
Aging is not for the timid. Skin sags, hair turns gray, joints hurt. Sounds like
fun, doesn’t it? The effects may be obvious, but the process of senescence
(the fancy term for aging) is still quite a mystery. Scientists know that the
ends of your chromosomes (known as telomeres) sometimes get shorter as
you get older (see Chapter 7), but they aren’t sure that those changes are
what make old folks old. What is known is that when telomeres get too short,
cells die, and cell death is clearly part of the aging process.
334
Part V: The Part of Tens 

The enzyme that can prevent telomeres from shortening, telomerase (see
Chapter 7 for telomerase’s role in preserving chromosome length during
replication), seems an obvious target for anti-aging research. Cells that have
active telomerase don’t die because of shortened telomeres. For instance,
cancer cells often have active telomerase when normal cells don’t; telomerase
activity contributes to the unwanted longevity that cancer cells enjoy (flip back
to Chapter 14 for the details). If geneticists can get a handle on telomerase —
turning it on where it’s wanted without causing cancer — aging may become
controllable.
In addition, geneticists have learned that old cells perk up when put in the
company of younger cells. This finding indicates that cells have plenty of
capacity to regenerate themselves — they just need a little incentive. Another
recent study suggests that calorie restriction in a person’s diet also helps
defer the effects of aging. Researchers found that when mice were put on a
calorie-restricted diet, a gene kicked in to slow programmed cell death (called
apoptosis, see Chapter 14).
There’s a very high demand for new information on how to prevent aging. If
keeping young turns out to be as simple as spending time with younger
people and eating less, aging may be a lot more fun than it seems.
Proteomics
Genomics, the study of whole genomes, will soon have to make room for the
next big thing: proteomics, the study of all the proteins an organism makes.
Proteins do all the work of your body. They carry out all the functions that
genes encode, so when a gene mutation occurs, the protein is what winds up
being altered (or goes missing altogether). Given the link between genes and
proteins, the study of proteins may end up telling researchers more about
genes than the genes themselves!
Proteins are three-dimensional (see Chapter 9 for an explanation). Not only
do proteins get folded into complex shapes, but also they get hooked up with
other proteins and decorated with other elements such as metals. (Take a
look at Chapter 9 for more about how proteins get modified from plain amino
acid chains to get gussied up to do their jobs.) Currently, scientists can’t just
look at a protein and tell what its function is. When it’s finally possible to
decode them, though, proteins will be a big deal in the fields of medical drugs
and treatments because medications act upon the proteins in your system.
Cataloging all the proteins in your proteome isn’t going to be easy because
every tissue has to be sampled to find them all, but microarray systems (see
“Gene Chips” later in this chapter) to detect proteins are on the way to speed
335
Chapter 23: Ten of the Hottest Issues in Genetics

up the proteome inventory process. Nonetheless, the rewards in discovery of
new drugs and treatments for previously untreatable diseases will make the
effort worthwhile.
Bioinformatics
You live in the information age, with practically everything you need at your
fingertips. But where genetics is concerned, it’s the information overflow age —
thousands and thousands of DNA sequences, gobs of proteins, tons of data. It’s
hard to know where to start or how to sort through the mountains of chatter
to get to the real messages. Never fear! Bioinformatics For Dummies is here!
(I’m not kidding. It’s a real For Dummies title. For specifics, check out www.
dummies.com.)
Bioinformatics is the process of using a computer to sort through massive
biological databases. Anyone with an Internet connection can access these
databases with the click of a mouse (surf to www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov to
reach the National Center for Biotechnology Information). Hop online, and
you can search all the results of the entire Human Genome Project for yourself,
check out the latest gene maps, and look up anything about any disease that
has a genetic basis (see Chapter 24 for info on the Mendelian Inheritance in
Man for genetic diseases in humans).
Not only that, but bioinformatics gives you ready access to powerful analysis
tools — the kind the pros use. Gene hunters use these tools to compare their
human DNA sequences with those found in other animals (see Chapter 11 for
a rundown of critters whose DNA has been sequenced). As one of the next
big things in genetics, bioinformatics provides the tools needed to catalog,
keep track of, and analyze all the data generated by geneticists the world
over. This data is then used for all the applications covered in this book —
from genetic counseling to cloning and beyond.
Nanotechnology
I have to admit that nanotechnology sounds like science fiction to me. It’s the
high-tech development of the super tiny, like tinier than microscopic . . . atomic
tiny. One proposed use for this technology is rapid screening of your genes for
mutations that may cause cancer or for prenatal diagnosis of genetic disorders.
Here’s how it could work: A bar code would be etched on nanoparticles of gold.
The gold particles would then be attached to bits of DNA that hook up with,
say, mRNAs (messenger RNAs; see Chapter 9 for details) that were harvested
from your cells. A lab tech would then pass a bar code reader, albeit a really
336
Part V: The Part of Tens 

fancy one (not like the one at your local grocery store) over the mix, and the
test would be done. Faulty mRNAs transcribed from mutated genes would
register on the bar code reader while unmutated genes would pass unnoticed.
Another nanotechnology idea in the works is an amazing new cancer treat-
ment. In the treatment, cancer-fighting nanoparticles are delivered by injection
and work their ways into cancer cells. After the particles are in the cells, a
magnet is scanned over the tumor site. The nanoparticles inside the cancer
cells heat up in response to the magnet and effectively cook the tumor from
the inside out.
Nanotechnology isn’t without its critics or problems. One recent study found
that nanoparticles caused brain damage in some fish, and some of the materi-
als used for nanoparticles are toxic. However, nanotechnology faces another,
less high-tech challenge: Patent applications are bogged down because the
industry has outpaced the patent office’s ability to evaluate it. Tiny or not,
nanotechnology is worth paying attention to.
Gene Chips
One of the most useful new developments in genetics is the gene chip. Also
known as microarrays, gene chips allow researchers to determine quickly
which genes are at work (that is, being expressed) in a given cell (see
Chapter 10 for a full rundown on how your genes do their jobs). Gene
expression depends on messenger RNA (mRNA), which is produced through
transcription (see Chapter 8). The mRNAs get tidied up and sent out into
the cell cytoplasm to be translated into proteins (see Chapter 9 for how
translation works to make proteins). The various mRNAs present in each
cell tell how many and exactly which of the thousands of genes are at work
at any given moment. In addition, the number of copies of each mRNA con-
veys an index of the strength of gene expression (see Chapter 10 for more
on gene expression). The more copies of a particular mRNA, the stronger
the action of the gene that produced it.
Gene chips are grids composed of bits of DNA that are complementary to the
mRNAs the geneticist expects to find in a cell (the method used to detect the
mRNAs in the first place is explained in Chapter 16). The bits of DNA are glued
to a glass slide. All the mRNAs from a cell are passed over the gene chip, and
the mRNAs bind to their DNA complements on the slide. Geneticists measure
how many copies of a given mRNA attach themselves to any given spot on the
slide to determine not only which genes are active but also the strength of
their activities. Gene chips are relatively inexpensive to make and can each
test hundreds of different mRNAs, making them a valuable tool for gene dis-
covery and mapping. Microarrays are also being used to rapidly screen thou-
sands of genes to pick up on mutations that cause diseases. One way this
screening is done is by comparing mRNAs from normal cells to those from
337
Chapter 23: Ten of the Hottest Issues in Genetics

diseased cells (such as cancer). By comparing the genes that are turned on or
off in the two cell types, geneticists can determine what’s gone wrong and how
the disease might be treated.
Evolution of Antibiotic Resistance
Unfortunately, not all “next big things” are good. Antibiotics are used to fight
diseases caused by bacteria. When penicillin (a common antibiotic) was
developed, it was a wonder drug that saved thousands and thousands of
lives. However, many antibiotics are nearly useless now due to the evolution
of antibiotic resistance. Bacteria don’t have sex, but they still pass their
genes around. They achieve this feat by passing around little circular bits of
DNA called plasmids. Almost any species of bacteria can pass its plasmids on
to any other species. Thus, when bacteria resistant to a particular antibiotic
run into bacteria that aren’t resistant, the exchange of plasmids endows the
formerly susceptible bacteria with antibiotic resistance. Antibacterial soaps
and the misuse of antibiotics make the situation worse by killing off all the
non-resistant bacteria, leaving only the resistant kind behind.
Not only are antibiotic-resistant bacteria showing up in hospitals, they’re pop-
ping up in natural environments as well. Farmers, in an effort to keep their ani-
mals free from disease, pump them full of antibiotics. Thus, antibiotic-resistant
bacteria abound in farm sewage; eventually the run-off ends up in lakes,
streams, and rivers that provide drinking water for humans. Many of those
bacteria cause human diseases, and because they start off as antibiotic-
resistant bacteria, treating illnesses caused by them is difficult. Meanwhile,
scientists work to develop new, more powerful antibiotics in an effort to stay
one step ahead of the bacteria.
Genetics of Infectious Disease
I’m guessing that you’re too young to remember the flu epidemic of 1918 (I
certainly am!). My aunt, who was a schoolteacher in 1918, told me that half
the students at her tiny, rural Louisiana school died along with the school’s
other teacher. All told, 20 million people worldwide died of the flu in that
horrific epidemic. The virus was so deadly that people caught it in the morn-
ing and died the same day! It’s still not known what made that influenza so
very nasty, but one thing is clear: It started as a bird flu.
The phrase “bird flu” may sound familiar to you because a particularly nasty
variety of it lurks in Southeast Asia and surfaces occasionally. Bird flu doesn’t
appear to bother the chickens that carry it. Humans who contract it, on the
other hand, get very ill and may even die of the disease. The difference in
human and chicken susceptibility may come from a protein that the virus
338
Part V: The Part of Tens 

makes on its outside surface. In humans, the viral proteins make the virus
stick to your cells like a burr, giving it access to the inside of your cells and
thus the ability to cause rapid infection. Chicken cells just shrug the virus off.
People catch bird flu by living in very close contact with domestic fowl — a
common practice in many parts of the world. The 1918 flu spread from Europe
to other countries when ill but symptom-free people traveled from between
countries. With modern air travel, someone with the bird flu can show up just
about anywhere, bringing the potentially deadly disease with him.
Scientists are racing to understand the genetics of highly virulent diseases
like bird flu in order to combat their effects. In the case of bird flu, vaccines
for birds are in the works, but significant roadblocks exist; most countries in
Asia have no vaccination programs, and others refuse to import vaccinated
birds. Not only that, but chickens and ducks number in the millions, and vac-
cinating them all (not to mention finding them all) is a daunting prospect.
The World Health Organization released warnings in early 2005 that a world
pandemic of the bird flu (think epidemic but much worse) may be imminent.
Coupled with a shortage of human flu vaccine in the fall of 2004, the risk of
another scary epidemic is very real.
Bioterrorism
After September 11, 2001, terrorism moved to the forefront of many people’s
minds. Hot on the heels of the disaster in New York City was another threat
in the form of anthrax-laced letters. (Anthrax is a disease caused by a soil
bacteria that’s very deadly to humans.) Opening junk mail in the United
States went from merely annoying to potentially threatening. Anthrax and
other infectious organisms are potential weapons that could be used by
terrorists — a form of warfare called bioterror. Suddenly, the researchers
working on anthrax genetics, people who had toiled away in underfunded
obscurity, were national treasures. U.S. government spending on efforts to
counter the bioterror threat shot up and has stayed high. Proponents say
that nearly $5 billion will be spent on the development of new vaccines and
drugs to treat potential biological weapons in 2006. At least some of the
money is earmarked to complete genome sequencing for pathogens like
Ebola. The insights gained from this research will spill over, advocates say,
to other diseases.
Critics counter the push for anti-bioterror research with arguments that over-
funding biodefense means that many important and more immediate problems
go unsolved. Furthermore, the bad guys may not even have the technology
needed to make the sophisticated biological weapons that big money is spent
to counter. Meanwhile, new regulations make research harder to conduct.
Scientists can no longer easily exchange biological samples, meaning that the
experts can’t get the research materials they need to do their work.

Ten Terrific Genetics Web Sites
In This Chapter
 Exploring genetics using the Internet
T
he Internet is an unparalleled source of information about genetics. With
just a few mouse clicks, you can find the latest discoveries and attend the
best courses ever offered on the subject. This chapter provides you with a
sample of the best Web sites available on the subject of genetics. (There’s
just so much information out there that I had to throw in an extra site.)
Cell Division
www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/miracle/divide.html
The basic cell biology of mitosis and meiosis is an essential part of how
genes are inherited as part of chromosomes (flip to Chapter 2 for the full
scoop). This Web site from the PBS (Public Broadcasting Service) series Nova
provides a very cool and very clear comparison of the two processes. You
see mitosis and meiosis occurring side-by-side as animated chromosomes
sort themselves out along the equator of each cell. If you backtrack a bit from
this material to the main site for the Nova program, “Life’s Greatest Miracle”
(www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/miracle), which traces human development
from embryo to birth, you can actually watch the broadcast online and find
information on prenatal tests, sex determination, and stem-cell research.
Mendelian Genetics
www.biology.arizona.edu
The Biology Project Web site provides you with many opportunities to build
your knowledge of genetics. The Mendelian material here provides valuable

assistance with solving basic genetics problems. The site includes excellent
material on cell biology, biochemistry, human biology, and molecular genetics
as well. One of this site’s greatest strengths is that it’s multi-lingual — Spanish,
Italian, and Portuguese translations are offered for several links.
General Genetics Education
gslc.genetics.utah.edu
This site is aimed at kids and covers a wide variety of topics, including
genetic counseling (see Chapter 12), gene therapy (which I cover in Chapter
16), and cloning (see Chapter 20). Although some of the site’s animations are
a bit on the juvenile side, the explanations are clear and accurate.
The Human Genome Project and Beyond
www.doegenomes.org
This Web site, maintained by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), profiles
the Human Genome Project. The recently completed Human Genome Project
allowed geneticists to learn the order of the four bases (C, G, A, and T) that
make up human DNA. The order of bases is important because it’s the key to
the building plans (otherwise known as the genes) written within your DNA.
The DOE human genome Web site provides an in-depth history of the project
and its milestones, goals, and results. (Flip to Chapter 11 for full coverage of
this topic.) The Genomics Primer is especially informative and is packed with
summaries of the project’s results to date.
Genes We Share with Other Organisms
www.hhmi.org/genesweshare
This award-winning Web site hosted by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute
highlights the findings of some of the various sequencing projects I profile in
Chapter 11. On this site, you can explore the genetic secrets of several model
organisms including fruit flies, roundworms, yeast, and mice.

The Latest News
www.genomenewsnetwork.com
The Genome News Network provides smart and extremely well-written cover-
age of all the latest findings in the world of genetics. The search engine at this
address can lead you to specific topics of interest, but this is a site that sup-
ports a lot of surfing. For example, skimming the list of Genomes of the World
allows you to find out about every single organism whose genome has been
sequenced thus far. The GNN news articles are truly outstanding. And be sure
to check out the section Weird Science; the coolest findings in the world of
genetics can be found here. For instance, contrary to the notion that black
cats are bad luck, the mutation that gives cats black fur may also confer immu-
nity to some diseases! This site is sponsored by the J. Craig Venter Institute;
Craig Venter was one of the scientists responsible for the successful comple-
tion of the Human Genome Project. (See Chapter 11 for more on this project.)
Genetic Disorders in Humans
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=OMIM
The Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man site provides a powerful search
engine to help you locate information on every single genetic disorder and
trait documented in humans. For example, if you type “eye color” in the Search
OMIM box, you get an exhaustive list of links to further explanations of every
gene identified with anything to do with the inheritance of eye color. By follow-
ing the Map Locus link on each information page, you can see a schematic of
the exact location of each gene on a chromosome map. For example, brown
eyes and brown hair are mapped to the same gene on human chromosome
number 15. This site is a particularly valuable resource for following up on
any disorder caused by mutation (see Chapter 13).
Careers in Genetics
www.kumc.edu/gec/geneinfo.html
The University of Kansas Medical Center provides this very comprehensive list
of clinical, research, and educational resources for genetic counselors, clinical
geneticists, and medical geneticists. A dizzying array of links is presented
343
Chapter 24: Ten Terrific Genetics Web Sites

including career opportunities in human genetics and a long list of forensic
genetics resources (follow the Education Center link). While touted as a
resource for professionals, this site has something for everyone; it’s an
amazing, exhaustive gateway to genetic resources on the Web.
Pet Genetics
www.workingdogs.com/genetics.htm
www.cat-world.com.au/Genetics.htm
I had a really tough time choosing just one site on dog genetics, but the one
listed here is good because it leads you to so much more information on the
topic. When you get to the Working Dogs page, follow the link to the Canine
Diversity Project for Dr. John Armstrong’s outstanding explanation about the
need for genetic diversity in canine breeding programs. Also useful, the link
to the University of California-Davis Veterinary Genetics Program provides
a gateway to information on a variety of species including cats, and from
the UC-Davis page, if you follow the Companion Animal Research and
Development link, you can find out more about the program’s outstanding
dog genetics research group.
When it comes to cats and genetics, the Aussie link given here provides
access to all things feline, not just the kitties in the land down under. This site
covers every imaginable feature of cats including coat and eye color, behav-
ior, and various sex-linked disorders peculiar to cats. Bottom line: It’s an
excellent resource for anyone curious about cats and their genetics.
The Latest Discoveries
www.nature.com/news/index.html
Each week, the journal Nature publishes the most recent and most important
research findings from laboratories all over the world. A companion site
hosted by Nature Publishing Group, called News @ Nature, covers all things
scientific, not just genetics, in everyday language. Follow the Stories by
Subject link to find all the genetics information in one place. The section In
Focus features in-depth coverage of recent events or findings along with links
to related articles. Most of the content on this Web site is free, but some
information is available by subscription only.
