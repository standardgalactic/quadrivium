Prologue 
The door had just slammed shut, the noise still resonating all across the 
floor. In the seven years that Véronique had been the general manager of 
VheTech, she had never felt such a violent burst of anger. Her serenity, her 
unassailable composure and her incredible ability to take a step back from 
things won her admiration, and her employees saw this as a major reason for 
the company’s success. 
Véronique was furious. “From a success to a fraud”, read the title of the long 
article dedicated to VheTech in a widely circulated magazine. Two weeks 
earlier, she had agreed to speak with a journalist who was very interested in the 
sector, especially the recent, incredible innovations happening at VheTech.  
But this article showed a perplexing bias. It was an outrageous scandal. The 
day after it came out, the content of the article was then picked up by many other 
media outlets. How did things get to this point? There is no way that woman 
could be a journalist. Journalists do not do things like this. Who, then, was 
behind the poisoned pen that wrote this piece? Who ordered this stream of lies? 
A competitor? It was a carefully set trap. It could not have been anything else.  
That afternoon, an emergency meeting was called with her closest staff. 
They urgently needed to react. Her communications director suggested an 
immediate response on social networks. There, the controversy was blowing up 
at a rapid pace.  
The tweets repeating the details of the report multiplied. They were 
becoming a real tidal wave. And every time, or almost every time, they set 
off a discussion. And ultimately, discussion was not a big enough word.

Rather, it was a loaded process where words like “crook” and “impostor” 
were thrown around, along with other insults.  
“We can’t let our reputation go up in smoke; we need to 
respond.”   
“Of course, but how?”  
“Our most aggressive detractors are mainly on Twitter; they 
even started a hashtag.”  
“We’ll create a Twitter account and respond to everything.”  
“We know them.”  
“We don’t care. That’s not really the problem.” 
Two weeks later, the results were in. But they were nothing like what was 
expected.  
The 30 or so tweets published by the firm were the subject of many 
retweets mocking them, and the page was bombarded with derogatory and 
even frankly insulting comments. The top ten puns also went around on a 
few news sites. Véronique was beset by a profound sense of failure. How 
could she get out of this situation? 
“I’ll write to all our clients and I’ll do a press conference. It’s a 
standard response, but at least we will be stepping up to the 
plate with tools that we know by heart.” 
The letter was sent. The writing was superb, crisply argued and with a 
heartfelt conclusion that called for renewed confidence, the same confidence 
that had always allowed for strong and lasting relations between VheTech 
and all of its clients and partners. 
Now, she just needed to focus on the press conference. 
A new and more elaborate argument, preparation for questions and 
answers, live training, etc. This press conference had to show impeccable 
professionalism, in order to put a definitive end to this conflict that was 
beginning to plague the company from within. People spoke very little, got 

Prologue     xiii 
upset for no reason and fled from the informal conversations that were once 
part of the envied atmosphere of the company. 
The company’s results began to fall at the same rate as motivation. They 
made what had already been a bad situation almost unbearable. A real pain 
for her co-workers. Everyone was on edge. They all wondered where and 
when they would be hit by the next attack.  
After a week of intense preparation, Véronique was ready for her press 
conference. The journalists had responded overwhelmingly to the invitation, 
all too happy to snap up a few more juicy details of what was beginning to 
become an “affair”.  
Véronique’s presentation went perfectly. The preparation paid off: her 
speech went off without a hitch. The journalists paid scrupulous attention. 
Then came the time for her to take questions. Véronique could finally 
breathe easy; she had proved she was up to the task and had been able to 
make her arguments calmly but firmly. 
Then came the questions. The questions were pointed and challenging. 
And that was fine. Feeling at ease, Véronique gave the floor to a number of 
different speakers. One last question before leaving? The young man asking 
did not seem at all deviant. But what he asked was not a question; it was a 
trap. No, not a trap, just a question that had not been answered yet. Or rather, 
an answer that was not great. What did it mean for him, this story of values 
and actions? Response was needed – and right away. 
Véronique felt a wave of dizziness come over her. A few seconds passed. 
Véronique was looking for an answer that was both a dignified way out, and 
also worded simply, with appropriate arguments. These few seconds lasted 
an eternity. Véronique was flummoxed, flabbergasted. When she finally 
answered, it was with awkwardness. It was not her, that was not what she 
meant. That was not what she should have said. In one second, she realized 
that all the work that had been done during the press conference had just 
been wiped out. The reporters went out quietly. Véronique remained 
motionless at the desk, rattled. 
She did not have to be a fortune teller to know that her little swerve was 
going to make headlines in all the newspapers. As it turned out, the go-
getting general manager of VheTech did not really know anything about 

xiv     New Technologies and Branding 
VheTech. Or rather, she preferred not to speak about this one particular 
aspect of VheTech, which she preferred to keep hidden away. She had 
effectively gone from a success to a fraud. 
The months that followed were particularly painful for the company. Its 
image had been deeply scarred, and everything the company said or did was 
scrutinized by journalists with unrelenting suspicion. The pressure on 
employees was very strong, and there was a widespread sense of shame that 
had crept into the teams, as if it were difficult to work for such frauds.  
A wave of resignations continued to further slow down the activity. All 
the sectors of the company were affected, and there was no indication that 
the conflict could have any outcome other than the complete destruction of 
everything Véronique had tried to build over the last few years. 
None of the clients bothered to respond to Véronique’s beautiful letter. 
 

 
Introduction 
Are you tasked with the heavy burden of keeping the beautiful and 
delicate machinery of a brand in motion? This book could be very useful to 
you, because today no brand is immune from an attack of “anti”: anti-
successful brand, anti-your profession, anti-the way you do things, anti-your 
beliefs or anti-your way of changing the rules of the game. All of these 
detractors existed in the past, but their voices were only heard if they had the 
means to gain access to the media (journalists or advertising space sellers). 
Today, destroying a brand is almost free; the Internet has become a finely 
tuned machine for people to speak ill of their neighbors to the world at large, 
and without any cost. 
Allow us to provide you with three tips before you begin to dig into this 
book:  
– build yourself a strong brand right off the bat, and if possible, during a 
time of peace;  
– learn about conflict, and practice confronting it before it hits; 
– do not become paranoid. 
Our experience working alongside brands suffering from conflict has 
taught us to detect and be wary of representations, even those we have just 
used. Indeed, the disease these brands suffer from is representation. 
However, it is difficult to do without representations. Conflict is highly 
complex. A metaphor is a very convenient shortcut. But like all shortcuts 
and approximations, it only portrays part of the reality. However, resolving 

xvi     New Technologies and Branding 
only part of the conflict is not really resolving it at all, and instead allows it 
to be amplified in the places where nobody is looking. 
Though metaphors and mental representations of conflict can be 
misleading, they are necessary. So what can we do? Simply learn how to 
spot them so as not to be a victim, and correctly associate them at a later 
time. 
The essential skill for being able to deal with conflict is the ability to 
multiply the points of view on and interpretations of the conflict. This skill is 
crucial in order to avoid falling under the spell of experts (whether genuine 
or self-proclaimed). 
Experts swarm, but all of them (and this goes for all specialists) give only 
one aspect of reality, the one that has to do with their expertise. An expert on 
digital monitoring will tell you that online reputation is the key indicator. An 
expert in bad buzz will emphasize the need to set up real-time alerts. A crisis 
expert will suggest you prepare more and more for managing the crisis. A 
theatrical improvisation expert will explain how to take the stage and 
improvise a solution with your employees. 
All of them are right, but only within their own fields. 
These specialists complement one another, and optimal management of 
the conflict comes through an ability to detect all dimensions and 
interconnect them. 
Conflict is complex, branching out through time and space. In order to 
control conflict, we must know ourselves, know all the stakeholders and 
know the nature of the conflicts and the way in which they behave. The first 
moment of conflict control primarily involves knowledge. But this is only 
the first moment. It must be connected with reflexes. 
This book has been designed and written with the objective of providing 
you with the necessary key factors to know and analyze situations of conflict 
that may involve your brand, and act accordingly. 
Throughout the book, we strive to show you the effectiveness of a 
broader vision of conflict, because the most formidable weapon for 
combating conflict is remaining focused on the crisis and its climax, and it is 
essential to act upstream as well as downstream. 

Introduction     xvii 
These keys can be summed up in a few major skills that structure our 
book: 
– accept conflict, and seize it as an opportunity; 
– master rhetoric and the public’s imagination; 
– know the social springs that fuel conflict, the effects of crowds and 
persecution; 
– know how to react and understand the tools of conflict management. 
From improvisational theater to foundational myths, from the Vietnam 
War to the trade war, we offer an original – and hopefully useful – analysis 
that will definitively change your perception of conflict.

What is a Brand? 
1.1. The brand: a concept built from relationships 
A brand is a construct, invented by a company or an organization, to 
establish a strong and productive relationship with the individuals who will 
allow it to grow. 
We are aware that this definition given here is hardly the first definition 
of a Brand, but it is useful in that it highlights the essential purpose of 
Brands, which is to create and maintain a social contract based on a 
relationship with individuals. 
Another virtue of this definition is that it leads us to a discussion on 
whether it is necessary to create Brands as complicated as they currently are. 
Not so long ago, we were content with the fact that companies design, 
manufacture and sell good products, in the right places, at the right prices 
and that organizations (parties, unions, federations, associations) should 
correctly structure their ideas and implement the actions for which they were 
created. 
Today, we demand that Brands behave as a kind of superhuman entity, 
equipped with a lavish personality, cultivating a look and a style that 
distinguishes them; speaking with a unique voice; setting themselves apart 
with coherent, constant and, if possible, admirable behaviors; pursuing a 
great mission; nourishing a vision of the world; ambitions and convictions 
grounded in clear and superb values; emphasizing their good qualities with  
owning up to their faults and maintaining friends and enemies.

2     New Technologies and Branding 
This change that has taken place over the last 30 years is staggering, to 
say the least. Brands have become focal points of society, and their survival 
depends on the judgment of the people who consume their products, 
regardless of the form this consumption takes. 
There are a number of reasons why this staggering form of tyranny is 
inflicted on them: 
– the level of competition that only continues to grow, and, at the same 
time, the power held by the consumer that brands compulsively seek to place 
at the center of everything (where was this power before?) are the simplest 
reasons, and perhaps the most simplistic; 
– the pandemic of defiance and distrust that has spread to all aspects of 
social life is another, more complex reason, and a more worrying one as 
well. We will make sure to return to this point in our analysis; 
– the abandonment of the major authorities is an argument which, 
although it is frequently challenged as being conservative and perhaps a bit 
reactionary, is nonetheless difficult to question. 
The philosopher Chantal Delsol describes this phenomenon well: we, the 
active members of this society, have been trying for 50 years, and 
particularly during the social upheavals of the late 1960s (such as the 
revolution of 1968 in France), to progressively stifle our main authority 
figures: parents, teachers, bosses, the army, churches, political parties, trade 
unions, etc. In getting rid of them, we have also lost the moral commitments 
that come along with them, that have allowed us to make sense of life. But 
giving meaning to life requires finding something that we value more than 
our own selves as individuals.  
One example from politics can help us to understand: at one time, 
communism was spreading aggressively. People could be for it or against it, 
but they were practically required to at least have an opinion, take sides or 
even fight. As the philosophers observed, this fighting spirit disappeared 
when communism disappeared.  
Individuals, when they are no longer experiencing suppression, find 
themselves like boxers without an opponent in the middle of the ring. And a 
boxer alone is ridiculous: no longer able to put on a show, he is worthless 
and his audience flees in dismay (or “disenchantment”, to use the current 
lexicon). His presence in the ring no longer makes sense to him. 

What is a Brand?     3 
This experience of suppression has left an opening that consumption is 
uniquely suited to fill. But the fact remains that consumption is an activity 
that is personal, individual (or nearly) and it is an act of “I”, not “we”. And 
thus many of our contemporaries are turning toward consumption to give 
meaning to their lives. This is much like considering that “the one thing that 
I value more than myself is me”. This is impossible, terrifying, mortifying; 
this moral dead end would lead to the conclusion that consumers are 
expecting Brands to fill the void left by the major authorities that have now 
been toppled. 
GAP: we can't even dress the way we want! 
On October 4, 2010, the brand Gap presented its new logo, which sparked significant 
pushback on its Facebook page. Consumers rejected this change. The most vehement of 
them resorted to outright ridicule of Gap’s new idea. Some even saw it as an attempt at 
diversion, to conceal the accusations made against their highly objectionable methods for 
producing clothes. Seven days later, Gap announced the return of its original logo, thus 
avoiding a conflict that could have caused significant damage. This example illustrates the 
extent to which consumers are able to build a strong relationship with a Brand, to the point 
where they make it part of their “personal life”. 
 
Volkswagen: not too many apparent wounds 
The brand is one of the leaders in society. It has its own set of values that the community 
of consumers adheres to. On the basis of this, in a scandal such as the events of 
Volkswagen’s “Dieselgate”, we see that the conflict that has emerged goes beyond the mere 
disappointment felt from being deceived. The Brand had patiently built its image as the 
embodiment of reliability, to the point where it could lay claim to being at the very forefront 
of this area. When the news broke of the company’s falsification, it did not simply tarnish 
the image of the company, but it affected its many claims to reliability, honesty and the trust 
that customers could have in its oversight measures. Commercially, Volkswagen is doing 
well, but this will remain in the consciousness of consumers – not the falsification itself, but 
the company’s ability to deceive. This resentment may give way to resignation, which is 
even worse. 
1.2. The brand is anthropomimetic 
Glorified in this way, Brands find themselves with responsibilities that go 
far beyond the organizational functions used to create them. 
In describing these phenomena, we constantly attribute human 
characteristics to these Brands. The Brand is a contact point for consumers. 

4     New Technologies and Branding 
Human beings can only enter into a relationship and maintain this 
relationship with a living being – a being like themselves. The brand is 
anthropomimetic. 
Over a brand’s existence, it takes on human characteristics that will be 
worked on, chosen and specified in the processes of brand construction, to 
the point of establishing strong, admirable personalities that encourage 
consumers to discover, recommend, follow and defend them. 
This anthropomimetisism does not imply anthropomorphism, which 
would instead be the incarnation of the brand in the form of a mascot or a 
human being (in some cases, the founder). The link between an individual 
and a brand is therefore very similar to an interpersonal relationship. As a 
result, this relationship is not balanced. As we have seen, the individual 
demands a great deal of Brands, and our purpose here is to study the 
conflicting consequences of the actual or perceived shortcomings of brands 
with regard to the demands imposed upon them. Why allow individuals to 
exercise this tyranny? Why accept it, let alone work to maintain it? Because 
the link between the individual and the Brand is a connection that is 
essentially commercial in nature. The brand sells, while the individual 
chooses to buy or not to buy. The transaction can apply to anything that can 
be subject to a commercial exchange: a product, a service, a commitment, a 
membership, a boycott, even a vote. 
The brand is a merchant, and thus it takes on the characteristics of one. 
We discuss here three of these characteristics due to their indispensable 
nature for the purpose of optimizing trade and for their major contributions 
to the processes of conflict: exaggeration, fame and fallibility. 
1.3. The brand as merchant 
1.3.1. Exaggeration 
Merchants are required to exaggerate. In order to increase product 
advantage, they therefore need to do a better job of selling them, for an 
increasingly longer period of time. This exaggeration forms part of an 
extended gradient that ranges from paying close attention to the presentation 
of its commercial offering, to outright lies. The choice of the level of 
exaggeration done by merchants is regulated by their own morality, by the 

What is a Brand?     5 
awareness of the acceptability of its potential buyer and by the risk that this 
exaggeration would backslide into abuse. 
Exaggeration reaches its limit when it is rejected by customers, and every 
merchant knows how to walk the line between the effectiveness of 
exaggeration and the risk of doing so excessively. This balancing act allows 
for a delicate regulation of commercial activities. 
This phenomenon had already been analyzed as early as the 18th 
Century. During that time, the kind of economic liberalism that was 
beginning to take hold promoted the idea that the market regulates itself 
better than if state-imposed regulations are imposed on it. It was an 
innovative idea to consider that a natural equilibrium point would be more 
effective than the artificial balance set by laws. In The Wealth of Nations, 
Scottish philosopher Adam Smith (1723–1790) wrote:  
“It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or 
the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to 
their own interest. We address ourselves not to their humanity 
but to their self-love, and never talk to them of our own 
necessities, but of their advantages”. 
Furthermore, exaggeration is a natural part of a process of seduction – a 
complex social phenomenon that takes many forms, whose purpose is to 
arouse the desire of others and the preference that will allow for commerce 
to take place, understood both in the sense of transactions and of 
relationships. 
The phenomenon of seduction continues to mobilize researchers, some of 
whom claim that it is indeed a sexual concept. Men tend to favor action, 
initiative and demonstration, and women tend to prefer appearance, attitude 
and behavior. 
We will not take the risk of judging this overly brief description of 
sexualization here, but we must note that Brands often take advantage of 
both of these tones. This seductive exaggeration is expressed in the 
appearance of the things being sold (the design of the products and their 
environment) as well as in the actions of the seller and in its 
communications, including advertising, marketing campaigns, civic actions, 
etc. 

6     New Technologies and Branding 
The difficulty of this practice of attraction and seduction is that it never 
really achieves total success, and that the temptation of emphasis, for the 
purpose of efficiency, can damage it.  
1.3.2. Celebrity 
Celebrity is a special level of recognition given by an audience for acts 
that are out of the ordinary: remarkable achievements, originality, 
uniqueness or preponderance of social position and performance. 
Celebrity is framed by fame, which is of a lower degree, and glory that is 
heaped upon an exceptional success. These different social positions differ in 
their consistency and durability. Fame is not very sensitive to variations over 
the short term, just as glory that, due to the lingering nature of memory, is 
easily embellished. Neither of these two disappears abruptly, but they can 
fade. 
On the other hand, fame has a fragile, precarious status, difficult to 
maintain over time. Fame is a public exhibition. The general public, 
considered as a whole, is not particularly generous. Far from it, in fact: it is 
quick to be admiring, but equally quick to be jealous or envious; it is 
passionate, and thus versatile; it is curious, in both the healthy and unhealthy 
uses of the term; it is forgetful, leading it to pounce shamelessly and at the 
slightest provocation from one emotion to another, as its whims dictate. 
The merchant – and therefore the Brand – can in some cases be showered 
in glory. More frequently, brands want to be able to count on a certain fame 
that opens the doors of celebrity to them, but that also exposes them. Fame is 
also a legitimate quest for the brand that sees it as a condition for its success. 
Naturally, it invests and invests to climb higher on this ladder of success. 
It is easy, and yet rational, to consider that climbing the ladder remains a 
dangerous action and that the fall is all the more severe once greater heights 
are reached. Celebrity is easily broken down into notoriety and image, and 
understanding the progressions of fame means following the evolution of 
both notoriety and image, which have long been studied by communication 
professionals in the form of a matrix. 

What is a Brand?     7 
1.3.3. A matrix for modeling celebrity?  
The image/notoriety matrix is therefore nothing new. It is remarkably 
easy to understand, and is thus taught very early in some courses that focus 
on companies. Its drama was quickly forgotten in favor of more 
sophisticated modeling which was thus more rewarding for users. 
This is a pity, because its power of evocation and power to project the 
future are eminently useful to anyone who has ever sat at the helm of a 
Brand. This matrix involves a vertical spectrum of notoriety ranging from “I 
don’t know it at all” to “I know it very well” perpendicularly crossing a 
horizontal spectrum of the image that ranges from “I hate it” to “I love it”. 
 
Figure 1.1. Notoriety/image matrix 
Thus, this matrix is a great asset for evaluating and modifying the 
position of an individual within the minds of its audience, the place of a 
brand or a product within the hearts of its consumers or its observers, or an 
idea in the minds of people who interact with it. 
The four quadrants, managed in this way, lead to situations that contrast 
one another, to say the least. The lower left quadrant is certainly the worst.  
“I don’t know it, but I still hate it”. 
Ever hear of the Swedish cannery Höga Kusten (“High Coast”)? Ever 
hear about one of their most famous specialties, surströmming? Even 

8     New Technologies and Branding 
without knowing anything further, the mere mention of “canning” and 
“Swedish” brings to mind a rather positive mental image. 
But once you find out that surströmming is a dish made from rotting 
herring, inedible even by most Swedes, which releases a stench so vile that 
the cans can only be opened outdoors and quickly (because there is a real 
risk these cans might explode), swarming with countless colonies of 
frightening bacteria, you are a lot more likely to place surströmming and its 
unusual manufacturer in the lower left quadrant. 
The next quadrant, directly above this one, is hardly more enviable. In 
many cases it is even more disastrous. 
“I know it, and I hate it”. 
The ones that are here cannot go back down, of course, and they will 
have a hard time sliding over to the right, because this movement, as 
advantageous as it is, would imply the destruction/restructuring of the 
existing image in a similar way to a conversion. 
Together, these two quadrants are often considered to be “the valley of 
despair”. We can understand why. Let us move to a happier area, on the 
lower right. 
“I don’t know it, but I already like it”. It’s a dream come true! 
Brands – and more specifically, product brands – occupy this quadrant, 
where products that are still unknown (whose release date has been 
announced) thus benefit from an idealized image of the brand under which 
they will be created. 
Examples could include – with no bias intended, but merely for 
illustrative purposes – the next Spielberg movie or the new version of the 
iPhone from Apple. This is a paradise for brands, and not yet overcrowded.  
Now let us move upward, to the far corner of the top-right quadrant, 
where all brands dream of being.  

What is a Brand?     9 
“I know it well and I love it”. 
This is, without a doubt, an excellent place to be. The peak, the summit, 
the promised land – to be reached by sustained efforts aimed at optimum 
performance. 
As you may already be able to tell from this description, the summit is 
not often a place that can be maintained over the long term. Consensus holds 
that after reaching the summit, the only thing that can follow is a fall. 
Indeed, being able to stay in this little corner is unlikely; just remaining in 
the quadrant in itself is no small feat. We mentioned previously that the 
notoriety/image matrix is a management tool.  
At a given time t, a Brand may be placed more or less objectively on the 
matrix, and its movement to a better area at a given point is decided by its 
manager(s). The matrix is a tool for visualizing brand kinetics. 
Recently, we have become accustomed to establishing as many 
Notoriety-Image Matrices (NIMs) for a single brand as the brand has 
particular types of audience: customers, non-customers, suppliers, 
employees, partners, shareholders, future hires, detractors, etc. The tool, 
when put to use to identify actions that will optimize/improve the placement 
of the Brand on the diagram, is a veritable gold mine.  
During a conflict, objectively situating a Brand on the NIMs of its 
various audience members is a difficult task. It requires approximations, but 
also makes it possible to design actions that will facilitate turning the tables. 
1.3.4. Fallibility 
This word is practical, since it touches on both the idea of an innocent 
mistake and actively committing an error. Streams of ink have been poured 
out on this topic, in writings on the obvious fragility of man and his great 
capacity for failure, which keeps him so far away from his gods. 
So then, why make this an important feature of the merchant if this 
natural peculiarity is inherent to every human being? 

10     New Technologies and Branding 
Because merchants are inevitably tempted to fail. Curiously, trade is a 
practice that succeeds in constantly brushing up against truly reprehensible 
things. 
It is a bit like in sport, where champions inevitably are faced with the 
temptation to dope, or in gaming where, in a frenzy to win, some people 
consider resorting to cheating. Good merchants are those who do a better job 
at selling. That is, selling more to more buyers, and buying, manufacturing 
or producing more cheaply, or selling at a higher price. 
In each of these cases of maximization of commerce, deviations, excesses 
and abuse can follow close behind excellence. Selling more or selling at a 
higher price can be subjected to advertising pressure that can spin out of 
control, turning into manipulation. Selling to more buyers may include 
selling to buyers who do not need what is being sold to them, or even those 
who should not even be customers in the first place. Buying cheaper is often 
done at the expense of the producer; suppliers who cannot give up a market 
that is unfavorable for them. Producing or transforming at a cheaper rate can 
devolve into the exploitation of the manufacturers or producers. 
Therefore, the merchant and the brand, in their progression and success, 
are subject to numerous reprehensible temptations to which they may yield 
in part or outright, in specific instances or throughout their existence, 
consciously or unconsciously. 
When one is fallible, failure is then not a surprise. It is a given.  
The problem is that brands, as we have said, are a social reference point – 
and that as a model, we imagine them to be perfect, or at least in line with 
the level of morality that we imagine they should have. Their indiscretions, 
whether small or large, are thus magnets for controversy. Though the Brand 
is a single, indivisible entity, those working for the company behind it are 
numerous, and individual. An error or breach committed by the company’s 
workers is always held against the brand above all else. The brand’s image is 
therefore dependent on human failings within the company, and the justice 
system or investigative media must identify the guilty persons so that the 
Brand can extricate itself from the responsibility (or even guilt) that has been 
assigned to it. 
 

What is a Brand?     11 
Rana Plaza: whose fault was it? 
On April 24, 2013, the collapse of the Rana Plaza building in Bangladesh left 1,130 dead 
and nearly 2,000 wounded. The day before, an alert had been given regarding disturbing 
cracks that had appeared on the building. This alert was suppressed, since it would have 
resulted in a prolonged shutdown of the five garment shops, which employed 5,000 people in 
hellish working conditions. The five workshops in Rana Plaza produced clothing for major 
brands: Mango, Benetton, Primark, Camaïeu, Auchan and Carrefour, among others. 
Were these brands guilty? Responsible? Is it impossible to consider that they may not 
have known? But who within these companies knew? Does the fault lie with just one person, 
a few people or is it the fault of the organization that they work for? Is the rule that says you 
have to buy at the lowest price a common sense rule, or a criminal one? 
The drama of Rana Plaza made for an instant scandal, and of course this scandal has set 
off many conflicts that have still not died down. 
Many brands, whether they were involved or not, contributed to aid funds for the victims, 
which washed the Rana Plaza blood stains from their hands. But it did not erase them. 
After the drama of Rana Plaza, British designer Carry Somers, active in ethical fashion, 
founded Fashion Revolution Day. Every April 24th, Internet users are invited to take a photo 
with a garment whose label is clearly visible and to post it on social networks with the 
hashtag #whomademyclothes. 
The movement for solidarity was admirable, of course, but while it originated from 
genuinely humanistic impulses, it also serves a sector that has found in this tragedy a new 
opportunity to instill lasting suspicions that may fan the flames of conflict during a 
subsequent scandal. 
1.3.5. Exaggeration, fame and fallibility: the trio from hell 
Exaggeration does not inspire confidence; fame arouses admiration that 
can turn to envy in the blink of an eye, then jealousy, then hatred; errors are 
not always forgivable, and negligence much less so. 
The merchant and the Brand are spoiled for distinguishing characteristics. 
Yet these entities are rarely the subjects of studies within organizations.  
This only occurs when conflicts arise. That is a shame, because, as  
 

12     New Technologies and Branding 
always, reactions are more complicated, more costly and more random than 
prevention. Brand managers would have every incentive to consider these 
three characteristics of the merchant in greater depth, in order to make them 
the subject of regular debates within the company, seeking to find their 
complete relevance in the work drawn in this way from the social 
responsibility of the company. 
For instance, it would be interesting for executives, previously presented 
with the three characteristics of the merchant – exaggeration, fame and 
fallibility – to work once a year on situating their organization in relation to 
each of these three themes, starting with a few simple questions: 
– where do we place our communication and our messages, on a scale 
from enthusiasm to falsehood? 
– have we changed in one direction or another, and what is the position 
that we should adopt (more or less exaggeration)? 
– who perceives us as annoying or arrogant? 
– is this potentially a risk? A risk we are willing to accept? A risk that we 
are prepared for? 
– do we know who in our organization is taking risks that could lead to a 
conflict?  
– how do we situate ourselves on the scales of notoriety and image when 
we consider each of our internal or external audiences? 
To deal with these topics, it must be established that this is not an act of 
paranoia, and that this exercise will be productive if it is undertaken, if not 
within a relaxed atmosphere, then at least with a bit of a playful spirit. 
1.4. The Brand exposed 
As we have pointed out, the Brand is a public figure, and like any public 
figure, it voluntarily puts itself forward in order to promote its actions and 
initiatives, to defend its ideas, or to test and launch its projects. It exposes 
itself to communities that are extraordinarily mixed in nature, and pays the 
costs of public opinions that are not particularly subtle. Plato was among the 
first to complain about the superficiality and rudeness of public opinion, 
which had been manipulated by the Sophists. 

What is a Brand?     13 
And not much has improved since Plato’s time. Public opinion is less 
nuanced than the individuals who voice it. The judgments, opinions and 
beliefs that rise to the top are those that are the most imposing, the loudest, 
the most intense and the most excessive. The ease with which messages are 
spread digitally has largely enabled the amplification of this phenomenon, 
which combines violence with immediacy. 
Those within the Brand who are involved in the conflict must be aware of 
it in order not to overreact. In the heat of the moment, it is not always easy to 
keep in mind that public opinion is not the opinion of the majority, and that 
the attacks suffered may not have been intended by a large number of people 
involved. Though it is difficult to do so in practice, it is crucial so as not to 
blow events out of proportion.  
1.5. All Brands are controversial 
You read that right. All Brands are controversial. They are all prone to 
generating or provoking conflicts of various scales and levels of destruction 
and permanence.  
Of course, a scandal that leads to the loss of a company hated by 99% of 
the population is not in the same basket as an informal community of 10 
customers outraged by lengthening delivery times. 
Is that reassuring? Unfortunately, conflicts, regardless of their nature, can 
always escalate. Small conflicts only seek to become larger.  
Obviously, when dealing with a Brand beset by attacks, there is a great 
temptation to see potential conflicts everywhere and to consider that, all in 
all, all brands are potentially in conflict. Consequently, our subject is 
propelled to the top, as it is of extreme interest and is an absolute and 
universal emergency for all brands. 
Our observations of many conflicts involving brands allow us to candidly 
assess the nuances of the subject. It is undeniable that any brand may come 
to experience an episode of conflict sooner or later, but it is worth 
distinguishing mere bouts of criticism or an isolated denigration from 
“guerrillas” that plot over the long term to destroy the entity that they are 
attacking. 

14     New Technologies and Branding 
There are two main reasons why conflict is a permanent threat. The first 
is that collective consciousness has progressed with an unprecedented level 
of speed and intensity. Junk food, resource depletion, global warming, health 
scandals, cynicism about the financial sector, indifference to inequalities, 
etc. We could cite many such “problems” that were only known to well-
versed insiders yesterday that have become widespread concerns today. 
The second reason (is it the chicken or the egg?) is the extraordinary 
deployment and democratization of means of communication, and above all 
their capacity to provide a platform for everyone, while at the same time 
uniting people. This issue has been analyzed extensively by many experts, 
and we will not add anything further except to note that digital networks 
have become gigantic and powerful machines for denigration, denouncement 
and sometimes even metaphorical lynching, creating hellish maelstroms of 
collective, fleeting emotions. 
Any brand can find itself in the middle of a conflict. But not all brands 
start from the same position. No one is perfect. If this aphorism is true for 
humans, it is just as true for Brands. What this implies is that imperfection 
comes in many degrees. 
Brands may be heavily at fault, to blame for severe acts of negligence, 
failures, larceny, slip-ups or misjudgments. The way in which the conflict 
plays out will bring to light the severity of the misdeed. 
Common sense (even though this common sense is not as sensible as 
might be said) will certainly recall that brands should not be shocked to see 
conflict. However, a terrible crime does not necessarily have to have been 
committed for a brand to come under attack. 
An irresponsible purchase of raw materials, considered by the managers 
of the Brand to be a minor detail but loudly decried on the Internet which 
receives neither an answer nor excuse, is a situation that some might 
consider as benign, but it has a high potential to generate controversy. 
We will look more closely at the case of Michel et Augustin, which 
illustrates the way in which a very moderate error can be furtively stoked 
into a blazing crisis.  

What is a Brand?     15 
This is far from the villainy that companies like Monsanto or Nestlé are 
involved in on a daily basis, but in many cases all it takes is a single spark to 
start a fire. In any case, detractors may appear and take action. They claim 
for themselves the weight of morality, honesty, virtue and fairness, and put 
themselves forward as the correctors of wrongdoing, which gives them a 
further advantage in addition to the fact that they “strike first”. 
On the other hand, there are cases where a Brand that generates a conflict 
is not necessarily in the wrong. 
If the Brand is perceived as hegemonic, this can give rise to jealousy and 
resentment. We have described this before. 
The case of Mars 
After the discovery of a piece of plastic in a chocolate bar, the Mars group undertook a 
massive recall of all its products, all brands included. This decision seemed somewhat 
disproportionate, given the fact that the danger appeared to be low, and the risk was very 
limited (it would appear that this piece of plastic was an isolated case). In this case, it was 
not a scandal that was revealed, but a simple accident. Consumers know that despite taking 
all possible precautions, accidents are always possible. What they look for is the brand not to 
have committed any acts of negligence, and to take responsibility for the reality of the 
problem. And that was in fact what happened here. So, where did this intensity come from in 
this communications crisis, with a recall on this scale? Was it just a PR overreach? In reality, 
we need to take a step back and analyze the environment where the crisis took place. 
A crisis in itself is not conflict. The discovery of a piece of plastic is a crisis. It is a 
specific instance. But this is only a partial analysis. Indeed, identifying the crisis is only a 
small part of the problem. This is where the analysis grid comes into play in terms of 
conflict: it makes it possible to visualize the broader situation.  
The food industry has become the target of many media attacks, particularly against 
groups offering more pleasing, fatty or sugary foods. Although these different brands have 
not recently had any scandals or been accused of dishonesty, they are nonetheless prone to 
controversy.  
“When faced with this growing suspicion, the food industry has not always adopted the 
right position. It has often withdrawn, or even walled itself off with silence or avoidance, out 
of fear of suffering even more attacks and criticism. By reacting in this way, it has 
unfortunately only lent credence to the image of a cynical and opaque industry among the 
different audiences involved. It has also sometimes generated a gap in the way it is 

16     New Technologies and Branding 
perceived, between the polished advertising materials for its products and the less glamorous 
industrial reality”1.  
Thus, in a context of conflict, the option to act decisively and with great fanfare to 
reassure the consumer takes on a whole other meaning. 
1.6. Leader? Tough luck! 
When a sector of activity is attacked, it is important for its detractors to 
personify it – to give it a name – and it is the market leader who naturally 
inherits this honor. 
In fact, there are few conflicts whose primary objective is to attack a 
Brand itself, for the simple reason that the Brand does not really exist. It is a 
symbol, covered with characteristics and attributes, all of which are fictional. 
The brand is a fictional being – effective, but fictional nonetheless.  
At the root of the conflict – and this list is not exhaustive – is a sector of 
activity that is quite diverse (as is the case with the fast food sector), the way 
in which a company treats its employees (e.g. firings, infernal rates) or an 
industrial accident (e.g. an oil spill). But the strength of the Brand is also its 
weakness.  
To alert public opinion to the horrors of a given sector or to a scandalous 
situation (whether proven or alleged), it is easier to mobilize citizens against 
a Brand. Indeed, if the Brand has a strong presence in a territory, it has 
associated itself very strongly with the ideals it helped to create.  
If a scandal breaks, then a hostile community can take shape. Anger or 
indignation therefore plays the extraordinary role of creating bonds between 
individuals who do not necessarily share a common background and do not 
belong to a pre-existing community. And this new community needs 
symbols, emblems and imagery, in order to be recognized – symbols to 
designate themselves, but also to designate their cause and, of course, to 
define their opponent. However, it is the leader of the sector who will thus 
crystallize the collective unconscious, even if it has not made any difference 
in the conflict that has just erupted. That is why it is all the more important

What is a Brand?     17 
for the leaders of a given sector to anticipate and prepare for the conflicts 
that may arise, since the leader is naturally more exposed than all the other 
players. 
IKEA vs. Cash Investigation 
On January 24, 2017, Cash Investigation presented its report on the wood sectors, 
entitled “Wood raids: promises by furniture giants”2. The report did not specifically target 
IKEA, but rather looked at all subsets of the wood sector. The purpose of the report was to 
attract attention and denounce outlandish certifications and the industries producing wood 
illegally; the wood sector provides materials not only for furniture, but also for much of the 
paper, packaging and decoration industries (including wallpaper, etc.).  
However, in order to organize the events into an easily relatable story that is able to stir 
people’s emotions, they needed to create a character. And so IKEA ended up becoming the 
villain of the story, because it is known worldwide. Commentators have pointed out that 
though the actions presented in the report were quite accurate, their level of occurrence is 
quite low (the area of wood burned is about 10 ha, for instance), and that the charges against 
IKEA are rather broad and concern the entire sector.  
But still, the spectators were drawn into the story. Heightened emotions and indignation 
brought strangers together around a common goal, which allowed them to act as a group. 
The following day, petitions and calls for boycotts multiplied on the Internet.  
A victim of its own notoriety, the furniture giant was targeted and held responsible for 
the ills of an entire industry – ills that are indeed reprehensible under the lens of current 
major societal concerns. 
 
Lactalis 
In 2016, a new crisis shook the news cycle involving the price of milk, which quickly 
became known as the “Lactalis scandal”. This is a classic example in terms of conflict, 
because it brings together many of the points we have identified as dynamics that are unique 
to conflicts.  
This new episode in the milk crisis served as a tipping point, bringing up a long-standing 
conflict once again. Let us recall here that crisis and conflict are not synonymous. They do 
not share the same notion of time. A crisis – an occurrence that has been subjected to 
extensive study – is an initial or recurrent peak of activity within a conflict. 
The news surrounding Lactalis gives us a good example of this, regularly making the 
front page of the papers. But trying to manage the crisis that occurred in October 2016

18     New Technologies and Branding 
would only be treating a symptom that is part of a chronic conflict that already had prior 
occurrences, and where the conditions that led to this crisis had not yet been resolved. 
In a sense, all of the ingredients came together. A tightly controlled communications 
strategy, one that was almost silent, left more room for opponents to express themselves. A 
level of control (very calculated in this case) of silence. Whenever Lactalis made a 
statement, it generated silence for people to listen to it and echo its message. This is all the 
more valuable since it is so rare. This gave Lactalis the opportunity try to reverse the trend 
by framing the issue so that Lactalis was no longer some capitalist monster, but instead had 
been singled out as a “scapegoat”. A bold strategy, but one that did not prove to be entirely 
successful. Indeed, as powerful it was, the metaphor was not entirely appropriate. In reality, 
the problem was the one we have dealt with below: being the leader is not always an 
enviable position. This becomes clear just looking at the name that was given to this issue. A 
milk crisis was turned into the “Lactalis scandal”. This is also the analysis presented by 
Laurent Pinatel in an interview given to L'Express: “It’s very reductive to only consider 
Lactalis, when there is a crisis of overproduction going on”. Reductive perhaps, but it is 
always effective to give a name and a face to an issue, especially when the situation is 
complex. This makes it easier to coordinate efforts. A vague, blurred premise makes it 
impossible to operate effectively.  
Does this mean that this conflict does not concern Lactalis, the victim of its own 
position? This is obviously too simplistic a position, which leaves out an essential point. If 
the leader of the sector is most often targeted in a general crisis, this is because it is expected 
that the leader, due to its status, must set an example. It is no longer an issue of guilt, but of 
being a good role model. By pressuring the largest of the players, the impact is all the more 
significant and will serve as a benchmark to measure the activity of other players in the 
sector.  
1.7. The Brand is not set up for conflict 
As we have noted, no matter what it offers, the Brand acts as a merchant. 
Whether it is offering products, services, ideas, ideals, commitment or anger, 
it is a merchant. The life of a merchant is not compatible with conflict, 
because conflict does very direct damage to the energies that allow for 
relationships and cooperation, and therefore commerce. 
Conflict is a situation that runs contrary to the activity of the Brand, 
which needs peace and enthusiasm as its conditions for growth. Let us not 
forget that we have created a situation in which the end purpose of 
commerce and commercialization is happiness. This point of view can be 
criticized – and is in fact increasingly criticized – but it nonetheless remains 
a rather dominant thought within so-called consumer societies. 

What is a Brand?     19 
Conflict and happiness do not mix. This incompatibility transforms any 
conflict into the Brand being put on trial. Conflict is destabilizing, time 
consuming and costly, and has the fearsome ability to multiply within the 
organisms it parasitically infests: conflicts that enter from outside create 
secondary conflicts inside. 
However, fear of conflict must not diminish the energies at work in the 
Brand. It must not make it lose its positive energy. The easiest way for a 
brand to protect itself from this risk and not to turn any likelihood of a 
conflict (low or high) into a devastating obsession is to calmly prepare 
during periods of peace. 
1.8. The Brand is not always agile (and that is an understatement) 
The Brand is always in the hands of a group of men and women. And we 
can say without false flattery that these teams are (almost) always composed 
of savvy, competent professionals, with rich expertise and experience 
allowing them to manage the Brand and drive changes among all its different 
audiences, especially the most difficult among them. It is impossible for 
anyone to run a brand without skills, values and strengths.  
Simply put, brand managers are not necessarily mythical heroes, but they 
are always remarkable people. They are the ones who bring the Brand to life, 
who make it evolve and who give it meaning and a unique appeal. 
This praise is sincere, but it also belies a much less glamorous reality. 
Together, brand managers do very well in normal situations, the ones they 
signed up for in the first place. But together, there is also a great possibility 
that they will be dysfunctional during conflicts. 
As we have said, conflict is destabilizing. The analysis of situations of 
conflict is seldom clear, consensual or quick; teams that work so well 
together when operations are running smoothly suddenly transform into an 
uncontrollable mob, the previously balanced relationships are eroded by 
suspicions, the decisions to be made are called into question at every 
moment and the actions taken are rarely agreed upon, widely criticized and 
always too late. 
This is all detrimental, because conflict requires a great deal of 
responsiveness, complete coherence and no shortage of audacity and great 

20     New Technologies and Branding 
courage. The brand, which was remarkable during the peaceful periods of its 
history for its positive interactions, can be transformed by conflict into a 
clumsy oaf, acting slowly and with great reluctance. 
The attackers, whom we will discuss later in greater detail, quickly find 
an edge in this quagmire. They can take advantage of it, and they can also be 
destabilized in turn (however, this last point should never become a reason to 
act foolishly). 
Imagine you make a jab at someone you know to be quick and quite 
bright. You obviously expect that person to respond with cleverness and 
poise. But no: he looks at you, stunned, distressed and without uttering a 
word. You would have to be completely malicious to continue an attack 
instead of the joust that he was expecting. But – and this is something we 
will also come back to – if the attacker is a group or a mob, such malice is no 
longer a hindrance, and harassment can become a collective enjoyment. 
What you just read is simply unbelievable. We – the same people who 
have always been loyal defenders and reputable servants of Brands – have 
just treated the Brand as something with the potential to act like a complete 
fool. 
To redeem ourselves, the least we can do is to humbly offer a few tips to 
avoid this pitfall (the first three are rather obvious, but deserve to be brought 
up, as they worth considering as essential): 
– the first is to anticipate conflict during peacetime. We repeat this often, 
but it is nevertheless clear to us that this precaution is rarely implemented, 
considered at best as superfluous and at worst as unnecessarily paranoid 
(once again we find ourselves mentioning this pathology that we absolutely 
want to avoid). 
– the second is to appoint a leader. Often the person with the highest 
position in the hierarchy holds this role. Sometimes the “number 2”, or the 
boss of the Brand, considered to be better placed, intervenes if this is 
impossible. The criteria are simple: the leader must be courageous and 
decisive. 
– the third is to reduce the team that will advise the leader to only a small 
number of people (and we will not insult the reader by explaining the merits 
of this precaution). The many possible alternatives are inevitably 
transformed into impediments, or turn into disastrous manipulation contests. 

What is a Brand?     21 
– the fourth is more difficult than the first three: it consists of “connecting 
the leader to the ground” in an ongoing way. Removing the effects of 
sycophancy (our third imperative) is necessary, but not sufficient. The 
“street card” needs to be played, and the jester. 
The street card consists of going out, mingling with “the people”, 
discussing and challenging opinions and gauging the real lay of the land; in 
short, getting one’s own picture of things. This is a good plan, but it is 
difficult to implement. During a time of turmoil, staying behind the wheel is 
an understandable reflex. 
And what about the jester? Let us explain. 
1.9. The irrational reactions of the Brand 
A Brand can adopt absurd and damaging behaviors under the direction of 
its leader. Although this can occur during more relaxed times, it is more 
common when the Brand comes under attack. The leader has sufficiently 
exceptional abilities to mobilize, inspire, and give courage and stubbornness 
at a sufficiently exceptional level to ensure the success of the Brand. 
Paradoxically, these remarkable abilities are the starting points of a 
pathological deviation that corresponds to a kind of cognitive confusion. The 
oxygen at the summits of power and success becomes scarce with the high 
altitude, and we will not go to the trouble of explaining to the reader the 
effects of oxygen deprivation. Thus, success has the unfortunate ability to 
intoxicate those who achieve it, and ultimately eliminates the boundaries for 
them between the possible and the impossible, strengths and weaknesses, 
opportunities and risks, truth and fiction. 
This troubling cognitive confusion leads to actions and decisions whose 
absurdity or danger is incomprehensible to casual observers. 
Many examples have been widely publicized, such as Kodak or 
BlackBerry, that have largely suffered from sequences of decisions that 
snowballed into absurdity, and that are frankly incompatible with the stature, 
know-how and experience of those who made them. 
In the world of politics, the examples are even more numerous. The case 
of François Fillon is a textbook case of cognitive confusion. Fillon, a 

22     New Technologies and Branding 
candidate in France’s 2017 presidential election, acted like a complete 
novice when he fell prey to a series of scandals, whose risk he could not 
have been unaware of. Whether or not you support Fillon’s policies, it is 
impossible not to be stunned by the amateurism of a man who obviously 
knew that his actions would catch up with him. How can we explain the 
incredible gap between expertise and candor, if not by considering that it 
was a total disconnect with reality? 
Manfred Kets de Vries [KET 95] has described this phenomenon 
perfectly. Exploring the mechanisms of the leadership of organizations 
enriched by an approach based on  clinical psychoanalysis, he demonstrates 
that leaders are driven by emotions and personal affections that have a 
substantial influence on the organizations they direct, and even manage to 
contaminate the people they work with according to the psychoanalytic laws 
of transference. The organization is not only an economical machine, but a 
psychic sponge. 
Kets de Vries describes how truly pathological behaviors of managers are 
transformed into similar pathologies within the company. He reviews 
paranoid, compulsive, theatrical, depressed and schizoid organizations. 
Our point is not to consider that all organizations and Brands are more or 
less guided by influences of the psyche of their leader(s) and are thus sick 
with the leaders’ illnesses. Nevertheless, it is important to take into account 
that in an episode of trouble for an organization, such as the confrontation of 
a conflict, these phenomena, which progress without making too much of a 
stir during more peaceful periods, can suddenly awaken and have a crippling 
impact on the reactions that could reasonably be expected from the 
organization. 
When the organization is faced with a conflict, the risks induced are fear, 
withdrawal, a tendency to wait too long or, on the contrary, violence and 
excessive reactions. However, for the attackers, all these excessive reactions 
are like a gift from above. Is there a way to answer? Kets de Vries offers 
one: the jester. 
Court jesters went beyond the role of entertainer that we know them for. 
Their mission was to bring the king back down to a level of humanity, 
balancing out their isolation, protectedness and disconnect from reality. 

What is a Brand?     23 
Where can leaders of an organization find their own “jester”? 
Presumably, one of their external consultants should be able to fill that role. 
It is still necessary for this jester to be able to count on the continued 
existence of his role over time, particularly in difficult situations. History is 
full of stories of jesters who were removed for being a bit too honest. This is 
true in the more recent history of organizations as well, which is a shame. 
Brands are an explosive mixture. Due to their strong symbolic status, 
their mastery of exaggeration and attraction and their presence in our daily 
lives, brands are very much exposed to conflicts of all kinds. This exposure 
is a goal for brands, but during times of calmer weather. As soon as the 
climate becomes stormy, brands seem to be very clumsy in responding to 
accusations.  
This current era is extremely conducive to conflicts of all kinds, directed 
against brands. In fact, new technologies have dramatically changed the 
techniques of conflict.

Conflict 
2.1. Etymology of conflict 
Etymologically, conflict refers to the idea of confrontation. Cum Fligere 
means to clash against something. Conflict refers to the meeting of opposing 
elements. This definition forms the basis for the idea of a trajectory and a 
force that leads to the production of conflict. 
From the outset, all thought on conflict seems to be concentrated on the 
issue of energy and kinetics. Conflict is more than potential energy, and 
above all, it only emerges in the face of an opposing force. We will come 
back to this point, but conflict is characterized by a dynamic; a progression. 
It is not a state. 
This shock can be violent. But violence is not always related to conflict. 
Violence refers not to force, but to an abuse of force. This is “overkill”, or an 
excessive show of force. The idea of violence refers to the idea of imposing 
its will, its strength (in Latin, vis, which means physical force in action). 
In our approach, we will set aside the issue of violence, which can be 
understood as a malfunction of conflicts, to instead focus on this particularly 
important trait that is characteristic of conflicts: movement. Our core 
premise, backed by our experience with Brands experiencing difficulty, by 
the works of Simmel and by our own research, is based on the idea that 
conflict can be understood as forces being put into action. Thus, we will 
initially focus on the analytically distinguishing components that come into 
play in conflicts, before proposing a kinetic perspective where the various

26     New Technologies and Branding 
 
components of conflict move nearer, confront each other, divide and 
reconstitute themselves.  
2.2. What is a conflict? 
If we follow what is indicated by its etymology, conflict is a moment of 
imbalance between two forces. By defining it as such, we then need to 
distinguish it from violence and hostility. 
“In actual fact, it is the causes of conflict – hatred and envy, 
misery and lust – that are truly the elements of dissociation. 
Once conflict has erupted for one of these reasons, it is in fact a 
movement of protection against the separating dualism”  
[SIM 15, pp. 19–20].  
Conflict is the breakdown of a state of hostility by any one of the parties 
that begins to take action. 
A crisis that starts a conflict is therefore not an accident. It proceeds from 
a decision to break from the status quo, and an intention to make a lasting or 
definitive change to the context that created it. Conflict progresses like many 
diseases by alternating between periods of malignancy or crisis (where the 
signs of hostility are paroxysmal) and periods of calm or remission. 
If the events that gave rise to the conflict do not disappear completely, the 
conflict will not go away. Therefore, a Brand that is drawn into a conflict 
cannot hope to muzzle its critics forever. At most, it can eliminate the causes 
of the conflict, change its practices or soften its positions, appease its 
assailants, etc., but it cannot be certain that the conflict will not re-emerge if 
nothing is changed at the end of a period of crisis. 
Conflicts are primarily based on a question of dynamics. Pointing out a 
simple situation of contrast is not enough when talking about conflict. We 
would then simply remain in a stage of latent hostility. The mere existence 
of a difference is not a conflict. A simple contrast or opposition of values is 
not a conflict. 

Conflict     27 
2.3. When is there a conflict? 
When does a conflict begin? And when does it end? Although an act of 
aggression committed by either one of the two parties formally marks the 
start of a conflict, in reality it appears that the perception of this aggression is 
often not an objective reality, but that each party seems to react to a situation 
deemed by them to be intolerable. 
As a meeting place, both Brands and conflicts are connection points by 
their nature. This notion of connection originates from a need for 
recognition. At a fundamental level, conflicts create new connections: they 
arise from the meeting of two entities that did not have any relationship 
before that time. Furthermore, there can be no conflict without someone 
being the attacker, and someone being attacked. This characterization creates 
a social bond. Entering into conflict means gaining recognition and 
interacting with the entity under attack. 
2.4. Conflict is complex 
Are you there, in the ring, with a well-identified adversary in front of 
you, ready for a fight? Well then, you may have a rude awakening and 
unfortunately, the reality will be more complicated than that – but also more 
stimulating. 
Forget about binary logic. A conflict is not an isolated event. It is already 
playing out in the period of peace that precedes it, and the trigger of the 
conflict is already in place, and will still exist in the form that the resolution 
takes. A conflict cannot be reduced to economic or territorial dimensions. 
The unconscious factors at stake, the underlying factors, the choice of 
words, the political environment, the management of resources, the beliefs of 
the combatants – all this helps to create a conflict. In a sense, it is your 
conflict, so deal with it yourself. And above all, do not let the situation get 
away from you. 
Conflict is not a short and intense confrontation with an identifiable 
beginning and end date. On the contrary, conflicts have their roots in the 
state of hostility that precedes them, and are formed again and prolonged in 
the situation of appeasement that follows them. As a result, conflicts arise 
from peace and end in peace. But this also means that peace is only an 

28     New Technologies and Branding 
 
intermediate state, while future conflicts breed. War and peace, and conflict 
and stability, are intimately intertwined, and it is difficult and perhaps even 
incorrect to try to distinguish them, as they complement and call upon each 
other. Georg Simmel, the famous author of The Philosophy of Money, is 
surely the most insistent on this complexity:  
“The same applies for both war and for peace. In the successive 
or simultaneous events of social life, they are so intertwined 
that the conditions of a battle to come are formed during any 
state of peace, and those of a future peace, within any battle”. 
[SIM 15, p. 132]  
2.5. Experts of a small piece of the whole 
A Brand is a valuable asset, and many specialists rush to its bedside, like 
a gaggle of good fairies, to offer it the best care they can provide. However, 
by definition, each specialist is only a master of one part of the complex 
situation of the conflict. It is absolutely essential for the person responsible 
for managing the conflict to be in the position of an orchestra conductor: to 
call on the right skills at the right time, and to know how to keep a level head 
when faced with the whirlpool of specialists who appear around a Brand in 
conflict. 
Each of the experts will try to pull the cover to himself or herself, and 
make his or her own field of expertise out as the absolute cure for what is 
ailing the Brand. Of course, it is up to you to remain cool when presented 
with even the most reassuring speeches, one after another. 
Conflict is highly complex, and its roots dip into many different 
dimensions (communications, economics, society, anthropology). Experts 
are specialists within a very narrow area. To resolve a conflict, it is 
important to have a view of the situation as a whole.  
The aim of this book is to highlight the complex, protean nature of 
conflict. Understanding the many ramifications and temporal aspects of 
conflict allows us to resist the siren song of experts acting on one aspect 
alone. It is up to you to know how to coordinate their skills, according to the 
nature of the conflict (and thus to precisely define its components), and thus 
the pace of its evolution.

2.6. Conflict can be an asset 
For 40 years, Greenpeace has been leading and winning fights against 
nuclear energy, fighting for the protection of oceans, against toxic products 
and pollution, against deforestation, against GMOs, etc. Greenpeace’s 
communication strategies are known for their high-flying spectacle and their 
effectiveness. In this sense, Greenpeace is an organization specialized in 
conflict. 
For example, an entire section of Greenpeace’s news is called Making 
Waves1. However, while conflict and its coverage in the media are valuable 
elements for defending a cause, Greenpeace is particularly careful to offer 
more than just this one message. In recent years it has expanded its rankings 
and guides for good practices, which are especially geared toward 
recognizing the companies that efficiently focus on sustainable development. 
Recently, the association has proposed a ranking of applications that use 
green energies (for the services that they provide)2.  
2.7. The words of attackers are traps 
In order to rally an audience to a certain point of view, it is not always 
necessary to present a complete and immediately convincing argument. One 
extremely powerful shortcut is to use terms with a negative connotation. 
This practice makes it possible to both save the trouble of making a case, and 
to help weaken the adversary by devaluing it. A well-chosen word is worth 
more than a long speech. 
Approximations, caricatures and frustrations are intended to close 
discussion. Who wants to try to better understand a group of people after we 
call them Nazis, slave-drivers or cockroaches? 
Isn’t it said that a person’s reputation precedes them? But sometimes this 
reputation is entirely created by their critics. So be careful not to let in any 
derogatory vocabulary that could end up being ultimately accepted as 
evident or a common way of injecting words into the conflict – and in 
particular, into an attack.

The audiences witnessing the confrontation will not bother to look any 
further. They will use these derogatory words, and convince themselves 
without any greater thought, and without thinking critically, that they agree 
with what they’ve heard, thus qualifying the group being attacked.  
This practice has been around since the dawn of time, and is still incredibly 
effective. The more the opponent speaks, the more it can spread the negative 
image it has of you. Whether sincere or outrageous, the weight of the words 
and names used remains the same. This trick is effective in three ways. First, it 
works to rally the troops around an identified figure that easily arouses hatred 
(or contempt). In doing so, it gives legitimacy to the fight (attacking a 
weakling or a hero is not a very effective tool for galvanizing a crowd) and by 
reversing the image, the attackers can believe themselves to be on the side of 
the good guys, the earnest, the pure, etc.  
This effectiveness is not just internal to the group. It also works more 
broadly with the general public, who are not involved in the case and are 
following the conflict from afar. With the general public being fairly removed 
from the subject and not necessarily taking the time find concrete evidence, 
their opinion will be more easily influenced if one of the opponents is 
regularly described with a humorous and contemptuous nickname.  
On April 11, 2013,  French magazine Le Point ran the headline “Is grandpa 
up to par?” to introduce an article focusing on the actions of French president 
François Hollande. Our intention is not to address the political merits of the 
issue, but rather the use of derogatory terms and imagery to refer to the 
president who was in office at the time. Grandpa was just one of an entire 
collection of nicknames (Custard, Roly-poly, Mr. Tinkerer, Captain Pedalboat, 
etc.), all showing a rare, contemptuous cruelty to a President of the Republic. 
Setting aside any particular judgment of the politician and his actions, let us 
just point out that these nicknames have undoubtedly played an important role 
in how the president’s actions were judged, particularly for the fringes of the 
people who are content with a light, quick analysis of political life.  
This is the whole point of tethering the opponent with these images. For a 
majority of the general public, the reflexive judgment would be to think that 
where there is smoke, there is fire. In the case of François Hollande, if “some 
people” had attributed such nicknames to him, well then, he must have earned 
it; he must not be a good president. 

Conflict     31 
Moreover, it is difficult to counteract people who use lexical shortcuts of 
this type. To achieve this, we must argue and give justifications, which is far 
more complicated, time consuming and risky than conceding or even relaying. 
The last place of effectiveness is the adversary itself. If at first the label is 
refused, by shrugging one’s shoulders or by getting upset, it becomes much 
more formidable over time. So much so that one may even stop doubting its 
legitimacy. Can we carry on over a long period of time when the image we are 
projecting to society is profoundly negative? The impact is obviously strong for 
an anthropomimetic Brand, but behind it, for the employees in the company, the 
pride of belonging to the company is deeply damaged. This dedication of 
employees to defend their company is one of the drivers that ensures that a 
Brand can stay strong during times of conflict.  
2.8. The words you use are also traps  
Although it seems obvious that the adversary would choose negative terms 
on purpose, and that the terrain of the conflict can include a war of words, it is 
much less easy to grasp how much we ourselves can be locked into using 
words that, in reality, are loaded with representations and posturing. This point 
requires more subtlety, since however quickly we grasp the weight of negative 
connotations, we can still be blinded by the terms that we ourselves use or that 
those close to us adopt. 
Thus, it is common to think of an abnormal spike of tweets as a “tidal 
wave”, or the announcement of bad news as an “earthquake”. However, these 
expressions, common as they may be, are loaded with pitfalls that influence 
the options that we give ourselves for reacting. Earthquakes and tidal waves 
are both forms of natural disasters. This vocabulary is therefore anything but 
neutral, since clearly we all know very well that a natural disaster is not an 
opportunity, and that it cannot be avoided. 
Therefore, if our first reflex is to classify a sudden event as an earthquake, 
we lock ourselves into the logic of a natural disaster: resignation, fatalism. All 
that is left to do is wait until it passes, before tending to one’s wounds. These 
representations only serve to mutilate us, since by locking ourselves into a sort 
of passive fatalism, we deprive ourselves of the possibility of having an impact 
on the course of events.

2.9. (Here) conflict is not... 
2.9.1. Conflict is not latent hostility 
Conflict is not a state, but an action. Having enemies is not the same as 
waging war. 
However, having perfect knowledge of potential opponents is an asset for 
when the day comes to take action. This precaution is admittedly sometimes 
something of a pious wish. The organization we are addressing here surely has 
an interest in knowing its enemies by heart, whether they have already made 
themselves known or are perfectly obvious, and we will provide you with the 
keys to achieve this. On the other hand, as conflict continues to receive 
increasing consideration in our societies, anyone in a Brand’s environment can 
set off a conflict against it and become an attacker. It would be a surprisingly 
paranoid kind of behavior to consider any individual as a potential enemy. 
Si vis pacem, para bellum (“If you want peace, prepare for war”). This old 
Roman adage remains valuable to this day,  in that it sets out the rule of armed 
peace. 
But the edict of Si vis pacem, para bellum has never been effective. We see 
it at the end of the 4th century penned by the scholar Vegetius, whose work De 
re militari (Treatise on the Military Arts) won broad acclaim among Catholics 
and was a cornerstone of the art of war until the beginning of the 19th century 
(at that time, it was even considered the official list of the laws of war). 
Steeped in Saint-Simonian pacifism, the industrialist Barthélemy Prosper 
Enfantin transformed the adage into  Si vis pacem, para pacem, thus laying the 
foundations of pacifism. 
In 1945, French sociologist Gaston Bouthoul founded the discipline of 
conflict studies. This discipline would then be challenged in the 1960s by 
Norwegian political scientist Johan Galtung, who founded irenology, also 
known as peace studies [KOT 12]. 
Conflict studies or peace studies? We leave that choice to those of you who 
will have to face conflicts. 

Conflict     33 
2.9.2. Conflict is not an accident 
Conflict is not an accident. However, an accident can cause or give rise to a 
conflict.  
But what do we mean by accident? An accident is an event that no one 
wants or is able to foresee, one that causes damage and disturbs the normal 
state of affairs. The risk of its occurrence nevertheless exists, but it is 
insufficiently taken into consideration and poorly managed, and these 
shortcomings always result in a hunt for responsibility or even guilt. 
Because of these characteristics, we distinguish conflict from accident, 
because we believe it is more relevant to study Brands in conflict by placing 
them in contexts that do not depend on exogenous phenomena, but rather only 
the Brand’s own activity. 
Taco Bell 
In June 2013, an employee at the fast food chain Taco Bell took a picture of himself 
licking a stack of the famous tacos sold by the Brand. The photo was spread via social 
networks and seen thousands of times. This was a sensitive crisis because on the one hand, 
the danger to consumers was low. Legionellosis contamination, by comparison, is far more 
risky. But on the other hand, anything that has anything to do with bodily fluids, including 
saliva, is extremely emotionally charged. It is very difficult to deal with disgust, especially 
on social networks where emotion is a powerful driver of shares.  
A regular customer of the chain posted the photo on the Taco Bell Facebook page, 
wanting the company to make a statement about its employee’s actions. The Brand made the 
choice not to remove the photo and to provide a response: 
“We have strict food handling procedures and a zero tolerance policy for any 
violations. […] we believe it is a prank and the food was not served to customers, 
we are conducting a full scale investigation and will be taking swift action against 
those involved”. 
What can be learned from this event, chosen from among hundreds of other similar 
ones, is that a Brand, regardless of how strong it may be, is unfortunately not immune to the 
detrimental behavior of any one of its members. 
Indeed, in this case, as in others, there was no particular intention to harm or to go after 
the Brand. It was, for all intents and purposes, a thoughtless act, and the person committing 
it did not consider the consequences (and was likely the first one to regret it). But once the 
damage has been done, action has to be taken. 

34     New Technologies and Branding 
 
2.9.3. Conflict is not a judicial procedure 
Conflict, as we would like to decipher it, does not include a trial – neither 
with regard to the attacker nor the Brand that is attacked. Nevertheless, legal 
proceedings do frequently come into play in conflicts involving Brands. But 
the legal system is a different world, and resorting to it relegates the handling 
of the conflict to a setting where the attacker and the attacked are no longer 
involved in the action, but rather waiting on a judicial resolution. 
However, we can consider how the filing of a legal complaint by a Brand 
that considers itself a victim is a delicate decision which can itself generate a 
conflict. 
Likewise, physical violence is also outside the scope of our study. The 
confining of an employee or the delivery of trick packages are an entirely 
different issue, even if in some cases their origin can be traced back to a 
conflict that has been poorly resolved.  
2.9.4. Conflict is not a game 
Analogies between conflict and games is not uncommon. One of the most 
common references is to the game of chess. Using this analogy, a well-
prepared conflict makes looking three moves ahead possible. One can paralyze 
the opponent, and in the best case, lead it to its final check; checkmate. But as 
popular and entertaining as they are, these analogies must remain just that, 
because they do not fully reflect the complexity of a conflict. 
Indeed, in a game of chess, each player takes turns, fully controls the action 
of the pieces and has the same information as the opponent. 
Now imagine a match where you do not see the whole board, you do not 
know how many players will join the game, your pieces can go alone into 
battle believing they are doing the right thing and the opponent will be able to 
play two or three times before you are able to react. 
That is why a conflict cannot really be thought of as a game. Conflict is an 
adventure, in which we must respect certain rules of self-protection, but are 
well aware that rules between the different players do not exist. 

Conflict     35 
2.9.5. Conflict is not a crisis 
There is no shortage of literature on crisis management, and it is extremely 
profitable for the Brands that are confronted with it. However, we would like 
to stress again the essential difference between managing a crisis and 
controlling a conflict. A conflict can be punctuated by crises, each of which 
calls for a particular methodology. With that said, if a succession of crises 
starts to resemble a chronic illness, we invite you to honestly ask yourself the 
question: what could the root cause be? 
In this sense, it is critical to adopt the right perspective on the events that 
may be doing damage to the Brand. You can choose to mop up the water 
dripping in your living room (managing the crisis) or to treat the problem 
upstream, by shutting off the bathtub faucet on the floor above (controlling the 
conflict). Crisis management and conflict control are complementary, but all 
too often a general perspective on conflict is lacking, leading the Brand to only 
react to episodes of flare-ups. 
Etymology is an important tool for understanding the difference between 
crisis and conflict. The latter refers to the dynamics of movement, when two 
entities are set into motion on a collision course, while a crisis has more to do 
with a specific event. It refers to an occasion, one that must be addressed, 
because it will not happen again.  
The word “crisis” in English derives directly from the Latin word crisis, 
which in turn stems from the Greek word krisis, rooted in an Indo-European 
term meaning to sort, separate and distinguish, and thus make decisions – it 
concerns both those that lead to conflict and those that will appease it. 
Medical practices incorporated this concept of crisis very early, where it is 
necessary to make decisions at critical (a word with the same etymology) 
moments, based on pre-defined criteria (another word with the same 
etymology). The Greeks believed in two different deities to distinguish the 
precise time of decisions: Chronos, the god of the passage of time, of duration, 
of physical time, and his counterpart Kairos, demi-god of the opportune 
moment, endowed with the talent to seize on coincidences between events and 
time. 
Managing a crisis (a paradoxical association, if ever there was one) is the 
art of choosing favorable opportunities and the right moments to act, and we 

36     New Technologies and Branding 
 
will come back to this in the choices that are available to a Brand during a 
conflict. 
The triggering event is revealed to an audience, who reacts. 
In this diagram, the commitment of the audience in question can take 
various forms (boycotts, protests, petitions, media coverage, etc.). Activation 
is an action of reviving the conflict of the same nature as the triggering or 
complementary event. The crisis is characterized by peaks in the intensity of 
public engagement. Triggering events, activations and crises are the 
milestones of a process with much more durability over time.  
 
Figure 2.1. Theoretical mapping of the kinetics of conflict 
2.10. The characteristics of conflict 
Why would we want to engage in a conflict and seek to control it when 
the passage of time, which brings all things to an end, could do the job on its 
own? 
Because conflict is inevitable, unavoidable and necessary. Let us explain. 
Inevitable: unfortunately, the desire to ignore conflict is not a solution 
that can be maintained in the long term. In fact, no matter what your virtues 
and strengths might be, you cannot hide from a conflict, and you cannot 
assume that you will never experience one. We can see at first glance that 
conflict is inevitable. No matter what you do, a conflict will inevitably arise 

Conflict     37 
on the horizon of your activity. Is this a fatality? Like Simmel, it is also 
possible to see this as an opportunity: 
“It is not true that we would always obtain a richer and fuller 
collective life if we were able to eliminate the energies of 
repulsion, which are also, considered, in isolation, destructive”. 
[SIM 15, p. 24]  
The second bit of bad news is that it is unavoidable. That is, you cannot 
bury your head in the sand until it passes by. A conflict does not resolve 
itself. It takes root, it expands, it disturbs activities. Refusing to face a 
conflict means condemning yourself to losing control of it, and to 
surrendering yourself to the critics and the public stigma, whose destructive 
power we know all too well. On May 30, 1791, Maximilien de Robespierre, 
pronouncing his famous speech on the death penalty before the Constituent 
Assembly, exclaimed: “The most terrible punishment for social beings is 
reproach, and bearing witness to the overwhelming loathing of the public”. 
This can be said not only for men, but for Brands as well. 
The third aspect of conflict is that it is necessary. Our position on conflict 
is, in this respect, unique. Rather than considering it a fatality, we propose 
accepting its necessity. This allows for latent tensions to be brought to light 
and extracted, in order to achieve peace. Conflict may sometimes bring 
harmony that must be built through the sources that led to its emergence. 
2.11. What do you think of when someone says conflict? 
When we asked this question to certain Brand leaders, they almost 
unanimously responded: catastrophe, anguish, suffering, stress, waste, 
breakage, fear, loss, worries, destabilization. 
These reactions are normal. A conflict is a confrontation that is 
increasingly able to spread with ease throughout the public square and whose 
outcome is uncertain by nature. At best, it is possible to hope it will be 
forgotten, to hope for appeasement, to wait for a new crisis, etc. 
Nevertheless, though these sentiments are justified, they have the 
disadvantage of being perceptible from the outside and reveal tensions that, 
when outwardly demonstrated, inevitably increase the conflict. 

38     New Technologies and Branding 
 
It should also be noted that here, when we refer to the “outside”, we mean 
what will be perceived beyond the small group of people managing the 
Brand. Employees, if they are impacted by the conflict, will also be 
subjected to the feelings conflicts generate. 
2.12. When someone says conflict, what should you think about? 
The glass being half-full. 
Conflict triggers a series of opportunities and it is important to clarify if 
they have not been anticipated: 
– reaffirm the values, beliefs and visions of the Brand, both internally and 
externally; 
– structure the thoughts of the Brand; 
– revise past practices that have become habitual, or that, if they are open 
to criticism, have never been criticized; 
– open up opportunities to communicate; 
– and above all, build or reconnect strong ties with the Brand’s audience 
that usually go unnoticed. By the Brand’s audiences, we mean both external 
and internal audiences. This point, which is evoked by the adage that “when 
times get tough, you find out who your real friends are”, is certainly the most 
important of them all. 
Conflicts across generations (of which there is absolutely no question in 
this case) are often punctuated by grotesque clichés. “The youth need a good 
war” is one that stands out in particular.  
Far be it from us to share this distressing idea. However, we do assume 
that, in every conflict involving a Brand, there are many opportunities to be 
found. The main one is to reiterate the strength of the Brand and revive its 
dynamic. 
2.13. What Sun Tzu has to say 
Sun Tzu, general of China during a time of warring kingdoms, wrote the 
rule book for managing war. Of course, the conflicts that a Brand will face 

Conflict     39 
have nothing to do with war, especially the kind that took place in the 4th 
century BC. 
However, the advice he was able to provide still remains incredibly 
useful today, and seminars that focus on applying his advice in the business 
world have become quite common. 
Fundamentally pacifist in nature, Sun Tzu’s teachings are a world away 
from the heroism of confrontation. Anxious to preserve the lives of his 
fellow men, the Chinese strategist has implemented a few gems of ingenuity 
to reduce the cost of conflict on human lives as much as possible. Thus, the 
main tools he recommends are cunningness, falsehoods, surprise and 
dissension. 
His essential contribution regarding conflict is undoubtedly the attention 
he gives to the unexpected. For him, the art of war is an art of conjecture. In 
other words, chance is an unavoidable component of any conflict, for better 
and for worse. Although this means that we cannot write down ahead of time 
each of the actions that will be taken in a given conflict, conversely, when 
faced with a conflict in which defeat seems inevitable, this should encourage 
us to remain attentive to every situation. As we will see, a simple detail can 
turn the entire situation around. 
2.14. What Simmel thinks 
A prolific researcher of the late 19th century, Georg Simmel, was a 
master of anthropology as well as sociology and philosophy. Known chiefly 
for his magnum opus on money, he also became interested in the issue of 
conflict, which he considers refreshing – not as a calamity, but as an 
opportunity. 
An optimist at heart, Simmel was the first to see conflict as something 
other than a painful event that must be avoided at all costs. On the contrary, 
he defined conflict as the beginning of a dynamic aiming to regain a balance 
that has been lost. The causes of conflict should be looked for in the previous 
situation, and conflict is the first step toward regaining peace. 
Armed with this conviction, he saw conflict as one of the drivers that 
made it possible to bring about social progress. Indeed, the emergence of 
conflict allows us to define ourselves, while defining the adversary. From 

40     New Technologies and Branding 
 
this double definition, the possibility of mutual recognition arises, with the 
possibility for finding a future partner (optimism is always allowed). 
“As has been said, if not by Carl Schmitt himself, but by his 
disciple Julien Freund, it is always the other who chooses who 
the enemy will be: it is the enemy who makes himself known as 
my enemy”3. 
Conflict actually begins when one of the two conflicting parties takes a 
belligerent action toward its opponent, thus defining itself through its action 
and defining its antagonist with the same gesture. Thus, conflict arises 
through a double baptism. A conflict can only exist between two entities that 
take action. We do not enter into conflict with anything and everything. Both 
parties must be able to act. In this sense, conflict only exists and is only real 
at the meeting point of these two forces that come into contact.

The Players in Conflicts 
3.1. The five agents of conflict 
Conflict is like a play. Or rather, a performance of improvisational 
theater. The text is not written and each actor acts as the play progresses 
while also playing the role of playwright and director. We examined nearly a 
thousand cases of conflict of all kinds, and several hundred specifically 
concerned a brand. Each conflict is different in its intensity, its progress, its 
main characters. However, in the face of this complexity and diversity, a 
common link necessary. There were indeed common structures to latch onto 
and synthesize a conflict. By distilling, collecting and categorizing the mass 
of data collected, this conviction began to structure itself around a consistent 
five-part outline: the Attacker (the first to act)/the Attacked (the Brand)/the 
Allies (of the Brand)/the Arbitrators/the Audience. 
We were tempted to further separate out a sixth actor: the Amplifiers, 
which includes journalists and, more generally, everyone who expresses 
their opinion on the ongoing conflict by telling the story, retelling the twists 
and turns, getting “to the bottom” of the case and telling stories to observers. 
But experience shows that it is not wise to make this into a homogeneous 
group, which it is never is, due to its lack of neutrality. These amplifiers may 
sometimes join the attacker, or sometimes allies, or the arbitrators, and may 
even change sides as the conflict progresses. 
The actors in a conflict also represent a fluid mosaic that cannot be frozen 
in place. On each side, the actors can evolve by changing positions, 
sometimes for, sometimes against, in a perpetually churning movement that 
does not facilitate the work of the party being attacked.

Figure 3.1. Diagram of the five actors in a conflict  
3.2. The “attacked” is the Brand 
As we have said, the brand is not set up to confront a conflict. A conflict 
is always an event that adds on to its normal activity, disrupts the normal 
progression of the organization, consumes time and money and creates a 
debilitating level of stress. 
Suddenly, the Brand finds itself in the spotlight, without wanting to be 
there. That is its first disadvantage. Add to this a lack of preparation, and 
there is little chance of things working in the brand’s favor. And that is 
indeed the goal of this book: to encourage all Brands to be prepared. 
Thus, our intention is to prepare Brands for conflict. 
Endless discussions and countless questions have punctuated this work, 
from the initial idea until the manuscript was sent to the editor. What Brands 
are we working for? Can the advice and key points we provide be useful to 
rogue brands? Are we helping to combat conflicts while also approving their 
existence? 
We have arrived at two points of view that allow us to carry out this work 
without falling victim to a debasement of our good conscience: 
– this book will not provide any miracles that have yet to be discovered 
anywhere else.  It is simply a modest collection of everything that may be 
useful to confront a conflict. It is the product of our collective experience 
with managers of brands under attack, and our research; 

The Players in Conflicts     43 
– the Brands whose less savory deeds are prone to controversy in 
practice, and the Brands that, due to their greed (and this is always the cause 
of the errors of the merchant), run the risk of a justified denunciation – 
Brands like that do not need us or our observations on how to act during a 
conflict. 
Having made these two clarifications, we have a resolute commitment: 
provided that your intentions are good! Indeed, though this book is written 
with humility, it is also something of a double-edged sword. 
By taking a look at the different ways a Brand may be attacked, and 
describing how to control conflict, we hope this will prove useful to the 
Brand under attack: that is the goal of this guide. 
But it might also prove useful to attackers as well. 
We are well aware that experts in war – who we do not pretend to 
compete against – argue that their advice is aimed at ending the war “in the 
best conditions”. And we share that same hope. 
However, we are not going to voluntarily describe many potentially 
effective 
but 
cynically 
Machiavellian 
techniques 
such 
as 
lying, 
manipulation, giving false testimony, etc. 
This is an ethical choice, and a strategic one as well. The idea of a Brand 
is not compatible with shady dealings, and engaging in them only serves to 
open up the brand to new conflicts. 
3.3. The attacker  
Knowing the attacker is a critical factor in controlling a conflict. The 
many different situations that this may generate require the brand to act 
quickly and investigate. Once conflict occurs, whether the time when it will 
come to an end is known, and whether its potential creators have been 
foreseen, it is effective to launch these investigations during a period of 
calm. The results will depend on the nature and magnitude of the reactions. 
A disproportionate response will cause damage on both sides. This is not 
new; there is no reason to try to kill a fly with a cannon. 

44     New Technologies and Branding 
 3.3.1. Deciphering it in 12 points 
To know the attacker, you must try to respond to 12 questions, answering 
each one while distancing yourself from the conflict and keeping a level 
head, and making sure to not leave any out: 
1) Who are they? Are they isolated individuals, connected individuals or 
established groups? 
2) What is their level of cohesion and unity? 
3) What is their expected benefit? (Changing, avenging, preventing, 
correcting, obtaining reparation, gaining recognition, weakening, destroying, 
etc.); 
4) What are the official reasons they present? Behind an attempt to 
prevent the construction of an industrial plant may lie a desire to weaken a 
sector of business or make it disappear; 
5) What is their strategy: to destroy confidence, ridicule, prevent access, 
prevent use? 
6) What are their beliefs, and how deep do these go? 
7) What is their background? What are their past actions? Have they 
already taken part in a conflict of the same kind, or another conflict in the

media, etc.)?

3.3.2. Who are they? Are they isolated individuals, connected 
individuals or aggregate groups? 
This is the first step, which seems so obvious that we sometimes forget to 
start there. Knowing your opponent is crucial. An isolated individual (a kind 
of “white knight”, or an alert launcher, or fanatic about a cause) is a complex 
situation. It may be tempting to ignore this individual, due to the digital 
weakness. 
But 
in 
the 
case 
that 
this 
person 
is 
an 
authority  
(a doctor, a lawyer, etc.) or is adept at media and social networks, this can 
make him or her into a kind of David (the individual) versus Goliath  
(powerful brands). Individuals like these can be totally committed, and 
trying to capitalize on their breathlessness is a tempting mistake.  
Individuals joined together are united by a common mission and values. 
They can be grouped on the basis of what has brought them together  
(a scandal to publicize, the request for reparations for an injury, etc.). This 
community then builds around the opinions of each member to form a 
coherent whole that goes beyond the sum of individual opinions. The 
functioning of these autonomous organizations is a matter of social 
psychology and offers many surprises, in terms of inventiveness, resource 
and adaptation.  
 The last category we have identified is a coalition of groups. Again, this 
combination can obscure both its strengths and its weaknesses. Let us take a 
closer look. A coalition of groups that unite their forces can pack more of a 
punch, as they have more resources pooled together for conflict, are more 
numerous and have access to a wider network. Their weakness is that they 
often lack unity. An individual or a small group is united by a shared history, 
a conviction. Groupings of associations, if they are heterogeneous, having 
different origins with different values and missions, are much more likely to 
create internal friction and paralyze themselves due to ego, strategic choices 
and objectives to be achieved. The WWF, a food producer that commonly 
faces threats from a coalition formed between Green Peace and Sea 
Sheppard, can be concerned about the outcome of the conflict. On the other 
hand, if the coalition includes a union, a rowing club and a wildlife 
association, the cohesion and the definition of common goals is more 
problematic.  

46     New Technologies and Branding 
3.3.3. What is their level of cohesion, unity? 
This question will also give an insight into the intensity of the 
commitment. A group that shares little in common is much more likely to 
fall apart than a community forged through past battles, brought together by 
a well-supported shared conviction, and driven by intense anger.  
Initially, it is not always easy to answer this question, but over the course 
of the exchanges and as the objectives are announced, Brand leaders should 
become more aware of dissenting voices.  
3.3.4. What are the official reasons presented?  
This question involves looking at the issue that is officially presented. In 
the next point, we will consider the fact that there are unofficial reasons that 
motivate people to take action.  
Imagine a conflict centering on a major fashion label launching a new 
bag made from animal fur. The attackers are fighting for the marketing and 
sale of this product to be halted permanently. But it would not be hard to 
imagine that this fight has more to do with ending all sales of animal furs. 
Giving the attackers what they want and removing the fur bag that started the 
conflict in the first place also opens up the possibility of similar future 
conflicts. This is why it is essential to accurately identify the benefits that are 
expected. 
3.3.5. What is their expected benefit? 
To approach a conflict as a whole, it is essential to know who we are 
confronting, but it is just as valuable (perhaps even more so) to know what 
they want. We will come back to the subject of expected benefits in greater 
detail, but it is interesting to list these benefits and to observe their 
disparities: 
modifying, 
avenging, 
preventing, 
correcting, 
obtaining 
reparation, gaining recognition, weakening, destroying. 
It is also useful to consider that there may be several expected benefits. 
The exercise that the Brand must carry out on the attacker’s expected 

The Players in Conflicts     47 
benefit(s) must be very early in the conflict calendar. The knowledge the 
Brand gains will guide the nature, magnitude and sequencing of their 
reactions. 
Now we can point to a difference between the stated reason and the 
expected benefit (see next section). Indeed, there can be a disparity between 
the real objective and the expected benefit. This distinction can be valuable 
in understanding the motivations of the adversary and, as a result, 
anticipating these next actions, especially if you wish to collaborate with 
rather than confront your adversary.  
3.3.6. What is their strategy: destroying confidence, preventing 
activity? 
Once the adversaries’s motives have been determined, as well as the 
benefits they wish to gain from the conflict, it is important to clarify the 
strategy that must be implemented to obtain it. In practice, there are 
thousands of ways to implement a strategy, and infinite combinations to be 
found by mixing the different approaches. Nevertheless, it is possible to 
summarize the major focal points that affect as many types of strategies as 
possible. We have narrowed it down to two major strategies. Let us explain. 
Trust is a major issue for Brands. Brands are designed to inspire 
confidence. Once confidence begins to dwindle, the survival of the Brand is 
at stake. Thus, one of the most common objectives of opponents is to 
directly attack the trust that the Brand benefits from. This strategy works in 
conjunction with several other strategies.  
In this sense, ridiculing a brand often means taking on its most precious 
asset: trust. Today, anyone with a computer can misappropriate an image and 
participate in these extremely powerful social dynamics, without needing 
any special technical skills. Some forums collect ready-made images, shared 
files that offer translations of slogans or responses to be published in 
comments, translated into every language. Today, a digital conflict can go 
global in just few hours, with just a few clicks.  
Using humor can be an easy strategy for a soluble community, which, 
once the crisis has passed, has no legacy or action to take. But humor can be 
devastating, because it puts the people laughing on your side. On the other 
hand, for a brand, dabbling in humor is always a sensitive area. The Brands 

48     New Technologies and Branding 
that make use of humor run the risk of making a bad situation worse, of 
giving the impression they lack finesse and of taking a difficult situation too 
lightly.  
The second strategy that opponents can adopt against a Brand is to go 
after it economically, targeting the company behind the Brand in some way 
or another. This strategy is based on the idea of discomfort, and goes after 
the company with a warlike approach, paralyzing its activity. This may 
include blocking access to raw materials, or demonstrations in front of 
warehouses or stores.  
3.3.7. What are their beliefs, and how deep do they go? 
Beliefs are a more complex aspects of conflict. This is where we can find 
the real driving force that propels the forces that come into play and sets 
them on a collision course. This is because within conflicts there are values 
and convictions that Men gather and bring to the confrontation. This is true 
for war, for religion and also for conflicts involving Brands.  
It is important to identify these convictions. And it is even more 
important to know their influence and strength. The harshness of the conflict 
will not be the same if we are dealing with an attacker who is a true believer, 
who only lives for the recognition of his or her convictions, as oppose to one 
who is merely driven by a fleeting bad mood.  
3.3.8. How intense is their commitment? Are they ready to “go all 
the way” with it? 
The intensity of the conflict will also largely depend on how deep 
commitments run. Is the conflict driven by something trivial, or by a cause 
that deeply affects the individuals initiating the conflict and their audiences? 
Conflicts that involve people’s living conditions do not create the same 
commitments as those dealing with life-threatening actions. 
Though this may be something of a caricature, the commitment of those 
who rose up in the wake of the Volkswagen’s Dieselgate scandal is not of 
the same nature or intensity as the commitment of those who denounced the 
horror of the suppliers of the Mediator scandal. In the first case, “they” are 
putting our lives on the line, in the other, “they” are taking them away from 
us. 

The Players in Conflicts     49 
How can we understand commitment? By trying to answer a few 
questions: what are their backgrounds, their past actions? Have they already 
taken part in a conflict of the same kind, or another conflict in the same 
sector, or another in a different sector? 
Communication is essential within a company. Some conflicts are long-
standing, and the opponents are well-known, but known by a team that is no 
longer there. But it is essential to know whether a similar confrontation has 
already taken place. What their claims were, their means of action. Do they 
deeply believe in their mission? All of these issues, muddled together in an 
initial conflict, are dissipated at the end of a conflict. What were the methods 
for reaching a truce?  
The question therefore arises from the experience of each party. 
Here, we return to the Cash Investigation issue. Its controversy-
generating logic is such that the forces driving the conflict professionals, 
with the capability to “set back” any brand they approach to explain its 
practices or values. 
3.3.9. What is their history with the Brand? Among the critics, are 
there any who have been employees, customers or competitors of 
the Brand? 
In other words, where is the attack coming from? Has it been launched by 
fierce opponents who have formed a direct, head-on opposition towards the 
company and its sector, or by employees or competitors of the brand who 
see an opportunity to set themselves apart? Answering this question is 
difficult, of course, but it also makes it possible to clarify the issue of the real 
challenges. Will they stop as soon as they have won the case, or will they 
realize that they have been going after the wrong objective, or that they have 
found a more exhilarating goal, such as 15 minutes of fame and the 
possibility of capturing the media spotlight for a few minutes?  
 

50     New Technologies and Branding 
3.3.10. What is their level of interconnection or differentiation with 
the Brand?  
In an emerging conflict, the brand’s ability to share with the community 
is decisive. 
Who is on the opposing side? Competitors? Former employees? 
Professionals in the field, or just people passionate about it? A party, an 
association, a group gathered by a facilitator/initiator of the conflicting 
movements? 
Exchanges, jousting, arguments, reflexes, attitudes, behaviors, and even 
the choice of wording, will vary greatly depending on the nature of the 
attacker and his or her past or present link with the Brand. 
That being said, closeness is not a guarantee of a peaceful debate. It is a 
fairly remarkable anthropological constant: the closer the other is, the more 
the difference is exacerbated; where there is a clear gap, there is often the 
possibility of vague tolerance, unless other issues are clearly at play.  
3.3.11. What are their supports, their backers, their alliances? 
Knowing the opponent is not enough. It is essential to know their friends 
and supporters. The old saying “the friends of my friends are my friends” 
can be adapted to conflict as well: “the friends of my enemies are my 
enemies”. Neither their numbers, nor their status, nor the community they 
belong to will be of great help to you. 
Try to find out if your critics have any support. Are they companies, 
associations, famous people, parties or unions? You have to create a clear 
map, even if it is required to be redrawn from time to time. 
Also, for each “friend” of the attacker, try to show the nature of this 
support. Is it logistical, financial, political, ideological or scientific? You 
need to know that as soon as you have answered the next point. 

The Players in Conflicts     51 
3.3.12. What are their strengths and their means (financial, 
intellectual, media, etc.)? 
A single blogger can have the means to publicize his or her case to all the 
major media outlets. A large association of industry professionals may fail to 
be heard by the general public, as they struggle to find a message that 
resonates with non-specialists. 
Some causes may find unexpected support from groups or associations 
that are better equipped in other ways, in terms of communications and an 
ability to disseminate, federate and organize a community around strong 
values. Volkswagen did not think they had to worry about an obscure 
environmental protection group made up of enthusiasts interested in 
evaluating the emissions of particulates from engines. But this is how the 
Dieselgate story began, and we all know how much this case has been 
picked up in the media. Some conflicts are intense enough to hit big brands 
head-on.  
3.4. The expected benefits 
All attackers enter into a conflict with the hope of getting some benefit 
out of it. Conflict for the sake of conflict is a fairly rare case. Simmel tells 
us:  
“Another exceptional case seems to arise when conflict is 
caused exclusively by the desire to fight […]. In this case, it is 
impossible for any other thing to take its place, it is an end unto 
itself, its own content, and as such does not end up adding any 
form” [SIM 15, p. 132] . 
All in all, this is a fairly rare case in the area of brands, and the vast 
majority of conflicts occur due to some expected benefit. Putting it into 
words allows us to do something rather incredible: to understand the 
motivation of the adversary and thus have an opportunity to anticipate that 
adversary’s actions and claims.  
This benefit is the end point toward which all the actions of the attacker 
will be oriented, and thus, by understanding this, that attacker’s drive to 
cause a conflict will cease. All this makes it essential, before engaging in a 

52     New Technologies and Branding 
conflict, to try to understand what kind of benefit the opposing brand is 
looking for. 
It is good to have in mind, at the time of this assessment, that the 
expected benefit is not necessarily in line with the openly presented 
motivation. 
In any conflict, the attacker has at least one desired benefit, that their 
action seeks to enables them to attain. It is rare for conflict to exist without 
some kind of price (e.g. in the kind of tear-downs done by trolls, which we 
will look at later). In fact, conflicts engaged without any monetary benefit 
are often the ones observed in playful demonstrations. Sports competitions 
or tournaments are the most common examples of this type of conflict, 
which are in reality more like antagonistic situations. This imagery of 
sportsmanlike competition is valuable, because it makes it possible to 
understand that a conflict that comes from nowhere can exist, and that the 
driving forces behind it are all in good fun, seeking to distract ourselves. 
Trolling or online bashing has a significant playful side to it (for its 
initiator). 
The detractors of a Brand have a limited number of possible objectives, 
which we list below. 
3.4.1. Weakening (winning is a failure) 
This is a somewhat paradoxical situation in a conflict, where total and 
unconditional victory is not actually a victory. Of course, reality dictates that 
the attacker will often come down on his or her demands for the sake of 
compromise. But there are also some cases – quite rare but nonetheless 
remarkable – where conflict is engaged without victory being sought. 
Conflicts that are closely monitored by an arbitrator are of this nature. 
 One excellent example can be found in the conflict initiated by AMD 
against Intel, on the basis of competition. Intel did all it could to impose its 
dominance, using both technical and commercial maneuvers, but the firm 
was never able to use its advantages to the point of pushing AMD to 
bankruptcy, as this would have placed Intel in a monopoly situation, thus 
opening it up to anti-trust proceedings, which would likely have split the 
company into two entities that would then compete with each other. A total 
victory for Intel would involve obtaining AMD’s revenue stream, but this 
victory would be a mirage, because a powerful arbitrating force was 

The Players in Conflicts     53 
governing the outcome of the conflict. Intel was therefore forced to pull its 
punches (keeping all proportions) and to refrain from considering total 
victory as a feasible option. 
This case is well-known and is based on the legal framework of the 
antitrust law of the United States, but every conflict is structured by the 
context in which it plays out.  
3.4.2. Obtaining the recognition of harm 
This is probably the most common reason to enter into a conflict, whether 
it is toward a brand or an individual, by any means: to obtain recognition of 
an injury, whether perceived or real. The Brand is considered to have 
committed misconduct, and the aim is to obtain recognition of the harm 
caused by this behavior. 
Following the logic of being innocent until proven guilty, many 
companies draw this conflict out as much as possible, and refuse to 
recognize the harm that they might have caused until they are convicted by a 
court. This posture is relatively risky, since if the opponents do not give in, 
the conflict will last for a long time and sometimes it will become further 
entrenched, leading to the intensity of the confrontation being reinforced and 
to the issue possibly receive more media coverage. 
It is observed that it is mainly the companies that provide nothing or very 
little in the way of messaging the members of the general public that are 
most resistant to the constraints of the recognition of harm. Consumer brands 
are also more vulnerable to conflicts that garner media coverage.  
One example among others: Bayer is currently at the heart of a long and 
extreme conflict surrounding the damaging consequences of one of its 
flagship products, Gaucho, on bees. Bayer is especially exposed to the 
general public. The number of online petitions signed is massive. In all, 
several million signatures were collected and these were presented at 
shareholder meetings1. And yet, there is no indication that this conflict is 
changing anything in the company’s actions.  
                            
1 “A worldwide petition signed by 1.4 million people was given to the German agrochemical 
giant during the general shareholders’ meeting”. http://www.lepoint.fr/environne ment/pesticides-

54     New Technologies and Branding 
3.4.3. Obtaining reparations 
One of the expected benefits that can cause brands to enter a conflict is 
for damages to be repaired. Contrary to the reasoning in the previous case, 
when a Brand refuses to recognize its responsibility, in this situation the 
damage has been admitted by the organization, but its compensation or 
actions taken to solve the problem are not deemed satisfactory to the parties 
involved.  
This was the case for Total, which quickly admitted to chartering the oil 
tanker Erika, but whose contribution and commitment to cleaning the 
coastline was deemed wholly insufficient, and whose main operations are 
now seen as a threat. 
3.4.4. Revenge  
No adversary is more feared  than disappointed consumers who unite 
their forces. The desire for vengeance is a powerful force, driven by strong 
emotions, a mixture of fury and of being wronged.  
This is an experience that ISPs (Internet service providers) know only too 
well. Through their direct contacts with millions of users – who, of course, 
are connected to the Internet – each angered customer adds to a pool of users 
ready to seize any opportunity to loudly express their disappointment to the 
world, and quell their lust for revenge. 
This community is disparate, geographically scattered throughout the 
country. The members of this community do not know each other and 
probably do not share much in common. We could almost think of them as a 
community that does not know itself. There are two factors that can bring 
them together: first, the brand’s committment to build this community with a 
sense of belonging. Choosing your subscription from a particular ISP is an 
expression of a daring, “geeky” spirit, etc. On the other hand, this phantom 
community can crystallize around a scandal. An article or an investigation 
denouncing the poor quality of service or billing problems, and immediately, 
every unhappy customer feels involved as well, and finds the opportunity to 
relate their negative experiences to the public.  

The Players in Conflicts     55 
3.4.5. Correcting  
In cases where the damage is confirmed, it is also important to make sure 
to fix what caused it. In the case of the software controlling Volkswagen 
engine gas emissions, the conflict against the brand intended, in addition to 
gaining recognition and later compensation, to fix the breaches that had been 
discovered. Another example of “correction” as a benefit sought from the 
conflict can be found in the L214 campaign, conducted in 2015 against the 
food brand, Michel et Augustin. The association had discovered that the 
brand used eggs from battery hens in the making of its cookies. In this case, 
the conflict was sparked with the purported goal of getting the association to 
correct its behavior (the origin of certain products). 
3.4.6. Prevention  
Some conflicts arise before damage has occurred, such as in the context 
of following a precautionary principle, or because a similar history suggests 
that a risk is possible. The debate around GMOs, and the malignant aura that 
has hung over Monsanto in France, has a lot to do with this category. 
Clearly, for the opponents of GMOs, this is a matter of preventing a health 
risk, faced with the introduction of seeds whose possible consequences on 
the human body and the environment have not yet been measured. 
3.4.7. Destruction 
The last expected benefit on our list is also the most radical one: the 
outright destruction of the adversary. This is a fairly rare case, and in many 
cases it does not concern a particular brand, but instead sector and an activity 
to which the brand is clearly assimilated. 
Thus, depending on evolving moralities, the sector of activity, etc., it is 
not uncommon to see brands abandon practices that generate an increasing 
level of outcry. 
In the case of Michel et Augustin, it is not the brand as a whole that is 
being attacked, but a practice (purchasing eggs from intensive production) 
that the public comes to see as incompatible or even unacceptable with 
respect to the values and promises of the Brand. 

56     New Technologies and Branding 
The same goes for the media fights that are led by PETA (People for the 
Ethical Treatment of Animals). 
In these cases, it is not one particular brand, or the clothing industry, or 
the luxury sector that is being attacked, but the use of fur, whose total ban is 
undoubtedly the victory sought by those who have entered into conflict. 
3.4.8. What the attacker wants to damage 
We have just seen the different benefits that the attacker feels they can 
obtain by engaging in a conflict. This typology is, of course, a theoretical 
framework, and should be applied to situations that are constantly in motion 
and hybrids of conflicts. 
Identifying the objectives and motivations of the attacker leads us to 
approach the processes they will try to put in place to achieve their 
objectives. 
Basically, it involves weakening the adversary, over and over again, until 
it is forced to give in. To do this, areas where the Brand makes contact with 
civil society are all critical points, which are immediately targeted, and 
which are important to be aware of in order to be able to keep an eye on 
them as soon as the earliest signs of conflict appears. 
Schematically, the action of the attacker can be carried out by using three 
sides (on one or more simultaneously, or to change the focal point of the 
attack). 
The first side, which is arguably the easiest to attack as well as the most 
damaging to the brand, is confidence. Simmel, a fine observer of conflicts in 
society, points out with great accuracy that “it seems to me finally that the 
incredible ease with which a climate of hostility can be suggested to others 
leads us to the idea of that hostility is a very fundamental need. In general, it 
is much harder for the average person to instill confidence and sympathy in 
another person he has not known up to that point, as it is for him to instill 
distrust and antipathy” [SIM 15, p. 49]. 
Today, scandals and revelations have multiplied, generating a climate of 
suspicion surrounding the activities of Brands, and making the general 
public more inclined to believe any assertion against one. Thus, the act of 
discrediting the image of a company or fabricating a hoax is intended to 

The Players in Conflicts     57 
destroy the trust in the relationship that has been built between the Brand and 
the consumers. 
The second sensitive side is visibility. If the adversary manages to hide 
their attack in the shadows, avoids speaking out or causes the brand’s 
products or services to be removed from sale displays, then the battle that 
ensues may be cruel. Those who are absent are always wrong, and no longer 
being visible means no longer existing. 
Finally, the third side that we have isolated in the conflicts that affect 
Brands is activity. To cite just one of the less cruel expressions on the 
prevention of activity, we can point to classic cases such as factory 
occupations or embargoes. 
3.5. Allies 
The brand is a social being, a being formed from relationships, a public 
being, and therefore it is no wonder that it has many allies, whether it knows 
about them or not. 
Who are these allies? They are often a very diverse group made up of 
customers, non-customers, employees, providers and the competitors 
themselves. This is a disparate network of people and organizations that, 
when the brand is in conflict, will behave in equally disparate ways. 
Some will distance themselves by staying silent, or even join the camp of 
the attackers. Others will support the cause, and this network can be loosely 
compared to a family. Why think of it as a family, and not a team, a clan or a 
club? Simply because in these different groups you can choose your 
membership, but you cannot choose your membership in a family. 
Some of these supporters will be efficient, others will be a burden – just 
like in all families. Therefore, the ideal course of action is to rally the 
efficient members, while distancing those who are more of a drag. Achieving 
this ambitious dual objective is like arranging a family trip. 
What would you do if you wanted to organize a trip with the family 
members you like best, without offending those you do not want to invite? 
Naturally, you would suggest that you yourself will be the only organizer of 
the trip, and then you would set conditions so that the more bothersome 

58     New Technologies and Branding 
members would not be able to meet or accept the invitation. A bit twisted, 
but very effective. 
Explanations. Your family, like all families, is made up of some people 
you love and others who, to put it more politically correctly, that you love a 
little less. To give an oversimplified example: say you enjoy the company of 
one of your cousins, who is rather athletic, while you are not very fond of 
your old aunt, who is not up for much exercise due to a femur that has not 
healed correctly. In this case, organize a hiking trip. Or, if you do not like 
your athletic cousin and love your clumsy aunt, organize a bridge contest. 
In any case, it is up to you to decide who is actively involved and who is 
kept at a distance. 
Heading into a conflict only requires a decision regarding future actions 
to be made, to announce this decision and to lay down the conditions that 
must be fulfilled. 
During calm periods, build strong ties with your potential allies. Forging 
strong bonds obviously does not mean being friends with everyone. If the 
personality of the Brand is sufficiently instilled, agreements and 
disagreements will be made with mutual respect. Diverging views, interests 
and practices will be seen as differences, not as a casus belli. 
To put it briefly, if you enter into a conflict, you must decide beforehand 
who your active and effective allies are, and mobilize them. You must also 
politely remove your ineffective allies, and watch over them with constant 
attention. Remember that if you have moved them aside, it is because they 
pose a threat. 
3.6. The audience  
Very (very) rarely, if ever, do the conflicts that break out only involve the 
two main players that we have already identified: the adversary and the 
attacker. Indeed, a conflict often becomes a social event, as the people who 
become aware of it are more numerous than those who actually engage in the 
conflict. We refer to the “audience” as the people who are aware of the 
existence of the conflict, but are not involved. 

The Players in Conflicts     59 
The audience does not directly participate in the conflict, but it plays a 
critical role in how the events play out. As soon as an individual in the 
audience actively enters into the conflict, it is important to recategorize that 
person, either as an ally or as an adversary, depending on the camp they have 
joined. 
But even whilst outside of these developments, the audience is a player 
who cannot be neglected, because their opinions and judgments have an 
effect on the ability of the opponents to maneuver, and greatly influences the 
opinion of the arbitrators, which we have isolated as being barometrically 
sensitive – that is, sensitive to the external pressure that is exerted on them. 
Our research has highlighted that in most cases, it is the attacker who 
defines the audience. (Will the conflict be limited to the realm of experts, 
will it be a restricted circle, or will it extend to reach the general public?) 
One of the first reflexes of a brand under attack, when it considers the 
attack wrong or unjustified, is to extend the audience more widely and to 
bring in a much broader audience hoping that this will solve the issue. This 
approach rests on the following driver: the public hates injustice. But, in the 
context of a Brand in conflict, the setup is different and makes this reflex 
much more risky. 
Indeed, the audience is a high-risk player. It often reacts emotionally, 
responding to ambivalent patterns and values, for example, the desire to 
protect the weakest among them. However, in the context of a Brand under 
attack, regardless of the motive for the attack, and even if it appears 
illegitimate at first glance, the public may judge beforehand that the attacked 
organization is stronger than the attacker, and thus, by default, view it as 
suspicious or even guilty. 
We have isolated two typical reactions that the audience may have, 
particularly in this era of digital conflicts: risking a relapse of the conflict 
and paralyzing all actions of the group under attack. 
3.6.1. Immature humor, more than ever 
The Internet is a place that is highly emotional, and frankly regressive. 
Therefore, it is necessary to anticipate the reaction of an audience that is 
only following the conflict from afar, without wanting to or being able to 

60     New Technologies and Branding 
grasp the eminently complex nature of the differences that drive the main 
players. 
It is particularly difficult to explain the nuances when the audience is not 
interested in the merits of the debate and is only interested in a pretext to 
keep itself distracted. But humor is the Internet’s favorite form of distraction. 
No matter how severe the case is, obscene allusions or diversions, including 
the classic example of photos of kittens, can totally drown out your attempts 
to explain things. 
Among the recent examples, during the manhunt in Brussels that took 
place after the attacks on November 13, 2015, in France, some media outlets 
chose not to relay sensitive information, and instead began their coverage 
with images of kittens. 
In a field far away from this grim news, Greenpeace, well-versed in the 
techniques of viral communication, was overwhelmed by a spontaneous 
movement governing one of their campaigns for the defense of whales. 
In order to raise public awareness on the threat of the extinction of 
whales, Greenpeace had proposed to give a name to a whale with a tag.  
This generated widespread public participation. Many different names 
were proposed, and everyone was called to vote. 
And finally, a winner emerged: “Mr. Splashy Pants”. Initially, 
Greenpeace tried to reject that name. In doing so, it underestimated the 
power of its audience, catalyzed in this case by the website Reddit2, which 
threw its full weight behind adopting the name. It is interesting to note that 
the debate here was completely flipped, from raising awareness on the fate 
of whales, to Greenpeace’s attempts to strong-arm its audience into not 
picking a goofy name. And this debate considerably broadened the reach of 
the audience, as thousands of people voted, captivated by the light-hearted 
spirit of the situation and with little (if any) interest in the fate of whales.  
 
                            
2 The founder of Reddit gave an interesting analysis of this event, available online as part of the 
TED talks series. https://www.ted.com/talks/alexis_ohanian_how_to_make_ a_splash_in_social_ 
media. 

The Players in Conflicts     61 
The first mistake was to allow the general public to have the freedom to 
make suggestions. By now there have been countless cases where initiatives 
by Brands have had to cancel these contests or votes due to customers 
coming out in droves to vote for names that stand out for being the weirdest 
or the most vulgar. 
This example, which has been analyzed in depth, is a good illustration of 
how asking for input from the general public can cause the main players to 
lose control of the situation, weighed down by childish fervor.  
3.6.2. Do not touch the nice ones 
Sometimes, social networks can promote regressive behavior. But that's 
not all. They are also awash with strong emotional currents, such as pity, 
rage or indignation. For anyone who has ever experienced the many different 
ways anonymous strangers can relentlessly hound teenagers, sometimes 
leading them to commit acts of irreparable damage. Certain values of society 
are perfectly reflected in the norms of digital interaction. 
In this sense, coming to the defense of a defenseless person can be a 
particularly powerful motivator online. Inequities are powerful fuels for 
collective emotions, and becoming outraged also makes it possible to 
assuage one’s conscience by firmly and loudly laying claim to values that 
sometimes the people claiming them do not practice themselves. That is why 
the firing of a cashier who happens to also be a single mother over an error 
of a few cents, or the abandonment of a kitten in a particular city, can 
mobilize thousands of Internet users over just a few days. 
The firing of a cashier over a sum of 85 cents3, the recovery of a coupon 
thrown out by a customer4 or the borrowing of a loyalty card5 has achieved a 
good deal of feedback on social networks to the point that in many cases, the 
management involved has opted to rehire the offending employee. In this 
case, no silly humor or special causes came into play, except indignation and

62     New Technologies and Branding 
the feeling of injustice based on the imbalance between the error and the 
penalty for that error.  
Although solidarity, empathy and aid are essential values for building 
society, when these values are reduced to their simplest expressions, or only 
exist to justify fits of violence, the result can be much more problematic. 
These collective emotions do not require clarification and reasoning. All 
they require are an approximation of events and a certain bias. And here we 
run into a pitfall, because once a brand is attacked by an individual or a 
small group, as soon as they react, it immediately finds their reaction 
portrayed as David standing before Goliath. 
And when conflict is widely picked up by the media, the company’s 
leeway is immediately reduced, since it will inevitably come off as a ruthless 
inhumane machine, attempting to crush an everyday hero. And this is still 
the case, even if the allegations are misleading, or if this small group is 
actually driven by motivations that are darker than the defense they attribute 
to their cause. 
3.7. The arbitrators 
Worms are bound to appear in an apple that gets thrown out. 
In a conflict that lasts a long time, arbitrators begin to appear, with 
varying levels of influence, expertise and impartiality. 
At this point, we can immediately draw a distinction between arbitrators 
and judges, so that we do not put ourselves in a bad position. The legitimacy 
of an arbitrator differs from that of a judge who is mandated by the people: 
the arbitrator is (normally) called upon by the parties. The arbitrator takes 
action in an area that lies outside the justice system. 
In the best case scenario, this arbitrator is called on by both parties, but 
this involves an agreement between the attacked Brand and the attacker, 
which is not so common. 
It must be said that the arbitrator is an unusual character in more than one 
way. They are supposed to be endowed with many qualities, some of which 
are frankly incompatible with their fragile human nature. 

The Players in Conflicts     63 
Take a deep breath, and here we go with a list: the referee must (must!) 
be independent, impartial, transparent, neutral, objective, calm, endowed 
with a solid and unassailable conscience, competent, constant, authentic, 
experienced, available, diligent, discreet, undisputed, capable of separating 
the parties who consent to relying on the wisdom of their decisions. 
This is admirable, but troubling. Just looking at the first of the qualities 
mentioned – independence – already raises concern. What does this 
“independence” really consist of? What does it guarantee? How is it 
measured? We do not have the answers. Let us avoid these improper trials 
and return to our conflict that plays out over time and attracts arbitrators. 
They belong to several spheres: political, administrative or academic. 
Regardless of their area of connection, the arbitrators have one common 
point that we have already mentioned: they are barometrically sensitive – 
that is, they are subject to external pressures that are capable of influencing, 
in turn, the continuity of their status. Although it is not possible to blame 
them for this minor sensitivity, it is important to take it into account in the 
relationships that must be built with them. 
And in the same way as we have done for the attackers, it is essential to 
keep an updated record on the arbitrators, noting their field of origin, their 
capacity of influence, their legitimacy (to distinguish between self-appointed 
arbitrators an and infallible experts) and their actions as the conflict 
develops.

4.1. The places, times and forms of conflict 
Understanding a conflict is not just a case of defining it or grasping its 
components. Being able to take control of a conflict also requires 
understanding the different ways in which it can create, in a way, conditions 
that can foster such conflict. Behind this somewhat scholarly formula, it is a 
matter of understanding the concrete manifestation of the conflict. Indeed, a 
conflict is not a theoretical construct, but rather really takes place in time and 
space. But depending on the place and the moment the conflict arises, its 
configuration changes.  
The power balance of the adversaries and the strategies they use 
contribute massively to the turns that a conflict will take next. In the 
following, we have gathered the different typologies of places where a 
conflict is likely to break out, and the forms that are most often encountered 
when the conflict concerns a Brand. Of course, this is purely a model to help 
us understand. It is important to keep in mind that a pure model can never be 
found in real life, and that only hybrid ones can encountered in reality.  
4.2. The competition 
Free enterprise promotes competition, thought of as the guarantee of a 
healthy emulation between the different economic players. Thus, two 
merchants offering the same products may be considered to be in conflict to 
the extent that the success of one is detrimental to the other. Conflict can 
thus result from a situation where the players find themselves to be 
New Technologies and Branding, First Edition.

66     New Technologies and Branding 
detrimental to each other through their actions, without there being any 
personal aspects to an attack. Let us explain. In competition, a case of 
conflict occurs. It is one in which both opponents confront each other, but it 
is not a question of specifically defining an adversary as such, or of conflict 
over a difference of values. For the most part, the two merchants share the 
same values (e.g. the freedom to start their own business) and this conflict, a 
product of their competition, does not imply any particular hatred between 
the individuals.  
In order to save their strength, it is observed that the market tends to 
reduce zones of competition, so that the conflict that the players in the 
market have to face tightens to increase in intensity. It is possible for them to 
compete in terms of prices or on the range of products or services but it is 
not, for example, useful for the business to stay open all night, because the 
number of customers potentially gained this way would be the same, but 
distributed at different times. In this case, the structure of the conflict can 
lead the opponents to reach an agreement on their hours of operation, in 
order to engage in conflict with the maximum intensity within the same 
window of time. 
4.3. The public square 
Bringing a conflict to the public square is not without its risks. Although 
conflict cannot be reduced below the number of people already in contact 
with it, it is not always necessary for the conflict to be extended and spread 
to become the topic of a collective discussion. As we have highlighted in the 
chapter devoted to the audience, the public square is, above all, a place 
where passions run high, and it is therefore unpredictable. 
Subject to outpourings of passion, there is no way of knowing who the 
winds of public approval will come to favor, and anyone who seeks to elicit 
the opinion of the public in an interested or instrumental manner by posing 
as a victim may very well lose at his or her own game, or see their potential 
supporters become their fiercest opponents. On the other hand, in a 
democratic period, seeking to manipulate public opinion poses serious 
ethical problems, and leads to questions about the roles and values that a 
company must uphold within society. 

Hostility, from Yesterday to Today     67 
4.4. The court 
Time after time, we hear condemnations of the litigiousness of our 
societies. Few conflicts are able to escape being sent to a court for one 
reason or another. Although we do not aim to address the issue of conflict 
from a judicial standpoint, we can, however, make it clear that a conflict 
often involves one of two parties calling upon an outside arbitrator to resolve 
the conflict. But it must be known that going to court also leads to a more 
intense conflict, because it is more objective. Indeed, the application of the 
law must be impartial, which limits empathy and the possibility of pulling 
one’s punches out of pity. 
This exacerbation of the conflict, brought to its maximum degree of 
intensity, is tied to the objective dimension of the proceedings: 
“A legal conflict is a conflict par excellence, since there is 
nothing that could take its place in the conflict as such, and that 
would serve its purpose. While even in the fiercest struggles, 
there can at least an element of subjectivity, a more or less fatal 
twist or the intervention by a third party; all this is left out here 
due to this attachment to the very thing that strips away 
everything but the fight itself, and leaves absolutely nothing 
else. It’s a ruthless type of conflict, because it is far beyond the 
subjective oppositions of mercy and cruelty” [SIM 15, p. 49]. 
4.5. The borders of conflict: between separation and the contact 
zone 
A conflict necessarily generates borders and distinctions. Here, the border 
is taken as a separation, an essential criterion for considering someone else 
as a friend or foe. Yet conflict is not only a binary organizational structure. 
The generation of a conflict also creates a phenomenon of recognition, of 
“me” and of “the other”. Who is the other and who am I?  
It is important to define oneself and define the members of the 
community. Who is on the side of the group under attack, and who is on the 
side of the attacker. If the lines are blurred, if it is not possible to clearly 
define who is with us and who is against us, the conflict is doomed to fade 
away or morph into a sub-conflict. The question of identity is essential in the 
creation of a conflict.  

68     New Technologies and Branding 
This act, by which one designates oneself and the other, is also a process 
that comes to build relationships between groups or entities that were not 
necessarily already in contact. Conflict is a (painful) form of sociability. And 
this brings us back to the etymology: conflict is also a meeting. 
4.6. The temporality of conflict 
The theoretical work on strategy dates back more than 3,000 years and 
today 
crisis 
specialists 
have 
shown 
complete 
control 
of 
crisis 
communications, its preparation and the protocols to be put into place. But 
nowhere among all these skills is there anything related to the specific nature 
of conflict. 
These types of specialists have a blind spot and it is precisely the central 
purpose of this book to illuminate it: conflict itself, in its own nature. 
Without defining precisely what a conflict is, today we currently find our 
knowledge base scattered between strategy and crisis management. But a 
conflict needs to be treated in its own right. To use a metaphor, you can 
pump out the water when your basement is flooding, but it is more important 
to know why the water level is going up rather than endlessly pumping it 
out. However, a crisis specialist manages the events one after the other, 
without perceiving that, outside of crises, a conflict is already at work. 
Conflict management borrows from crisis management, but it broadens 
the focus to include more than simply following the most memorable 
episodes. 
4.7. What do the conflicts that engage the brand look like?  
The scale of conflict distinguishes dissension, war, guerrilla warfare and 
terrorism. War does not involve Brands. There are wars between brands, and 
even very cruel ones, but these wars are not part of what we would like to 
examine. Even if we had to establish a scale of degrees, above would be a 
notch for deterrance, which would be off limits for us too.  
On the other hand, the conflicts that affect Brands are just one notch 
down on the scale of intensity. They include two forms of attack: guerrilla 
warfare and terrorism. These are “little” wars, the so-called “poor man’s 
war”, or asymmetrical wars. Understanding the differences between these

two types of conflict is important, with one feature identified thus revealing 
the others.

Table 4.1. Guerrilla opposition versus terrorism 
4.8. Guerrilla warfare and terrorism, excellent value for money 
The conflicts that may be experienced by brands are akin to either 
guerrilla warfare or terrorism. This is due to the fact that these are 
asymmetrical forms of confrontation between a weak attacker and a strong 
group under attack. 
Attention. There is a fundamental difference between the types of actions 
in a conflict we identify and the real practices of terrorism that shock us with 
their bloody horror when they appear on the news. Although the way this 
strategy has been formulated is tragic, it is nonetheless true: it works better 
not to give rise to an amalgamation.  
The terrorism we describe here is a depiction of a form of action based on 
an isolated practice, not in a group, aiming at a symbolic goal. There is 
obviously no common measurement between attacks and militant activism. 
Our intention is not to categorize some militant actions or means to be heard, 
but to provide the key elements to think about what is happening.  
The actions of the first group do not require large amounts of resources, 
and the expected effects are not material but psychological in nature. This 

70     New Technologies and Branding 
device for saving resources allows the detractors of a brand to strike using 
tactics whose profit/cost ratio can be considerable. 
Obviously, the use of resources and digital media is the key to the 
excellent payoff of the action. Speech, through its ability to persuade and 
disseminate, is a weapon of formidable effectiveness. 
4.8.1. The fly’s strategy 
At the end of March 2016, the day after the attacks in Brussels, the 
historian Yuval Noah Harari wrote an enlightening article for L'Obs, a 
French news magazine, on the “theatre of terror”. 
The author begins by describing the strategy of the fly: 
“A terrorist is like a fly who wants to destroy a china shop. 
Small and weak, the fly is unable to move even a single cup. So 
it finds an elephant, buzzes into its ear, and hums until the 
elephant becomes enraged, mad with fear and anger, and 
tramples the store. In this way, for example, Al-Qaeda (like the 
fly in this analogy), led the United States (the elephant) to 
destroy the Middle East (the china shop)”. 
Terrorism is a strategy that seeks to upset the established balance with a 
real saving in terms of resources. At the end of a terrorist attack, the military 
and economic capabilities of the attacked group remain intact. There is much 
less material damage than psychological damage, which leads to confusion, 
fear and disproportionate reactions. 
This reflection is particularly enlightening in the conflicts affecting 
Brands. When the Brand is attacked, its officials are very naturally upset, at 
varying levels of intensity. It is precisely in this situation of fear, of shock, 
and in some cases of panic, that one must make crucial decisions, and above 
all, balanced ones. 
In these troubled contexts, one should never forget that an overreaction is 
a gift to the detractors. 

Hostility, from Yesterday to Today     71 
4.9. Scandal 
A scandal is an episode of the outbreak of the conflict. It is easily lumped 
in with the crisis that it triggers or relaunches, and which has given rise to a 
form of cross-cutting communication under the same name, now creating an 
entire discipline.  
In fact, if one observes the time frame of the events, a scandal is a 
sudden, brutal, crisis-triggering event, significant in intensity, but slower to 
be assuaged and able to permanently instil a situation of conflict.  
It seems that scandals have always existed in all societies. And yet, the 
mechanisms of scandal have long been looked down upon by researchers. 
Today, scandals have largely been deconstructed by most of the social 
sciences. 
Even if we do not want to reduce a conflict to a scandal, in approaching it 
by means of summarization, as we are going to do here, we find that it is 
interesting with respect to understanding the most vivid stages of the conflict 
and the motivations of the stakeholders. 
A scandal is therefore a violent moment of life in a society. Violent, but 
normal – and even healthy, if you consider that it can work to benefit 
functions that are essential for the community in which it arises. 
A scandal makes it possible to test the group’s adherence to the standards 
it has chosen for itself. 
It awakens unity and, in doing so, constitutes an imposing force. It 
reveals the divisions, redistributes the reports of domination, calls into 
question the relationships of force, provokes organizational rethinking, 
allows new rules to be enacted and often replaces the role of authorities who 
have been unable to protect against flouted standards. 
Described as such, one would almost be tempted to see it blossom more. 
The person who exposes a scandal denounces the objective of measuring 
how attached a given community is to the values that have been transgressed 
(and thus existed beforehand).  

72     New Technologies and Branding 
The “denouncer” revealing the scandal (the one we will often refer to as 
the attacker), just like the person or group under attack, is not in a 
comfortable situation. Determination about the issue is a source of concern, 
uncertainty and unreality.  
More than just a test [DE 05], a scandal is a trial for everyone, because it 
lays bare all the players. It is a radical process of visibility, as well as an 
action of language. 
For a scandal to break, the person who reveals it has to find an audience. 
This is not self-evident. The audience they seek to mobilize must be in 
agreement, as shown by its indignation, that it is a scandal that it wants to 
“take up”, and thus a dysfunction that requires punishment. If the public 
considers that the standard that has been violated does not matter, or is no 
longer relevant, the scandal will disappear. 
In addition to blowing up or flickering out, a scandal may have a third 
outcome: its transformation into an affair, a progression in which the 
attacker and his or her allies themselves come under attack. 
We are in the process of describing the scandal as we would a board 
game. It is indeed like one, with its rules, tactics, moves and strategies, and it 
has its good and its bad players. What distinguishes it, however, is that this 
game is not stabilized, not predictable and never scripted in advance. 
The strategy for creating scandals requires some trump cards: the ability 
to divulge the issue that generates the scandal, and to show it, the ability to 
mobilize an audience (e.g. public demonstrations) that will cause indignation 
and a desire for reparation, and finally the ability to create, convince and 
persuade the outlets that will amplify the scandal. 
Contemporary societies (that is to say, our own) have the ability to access 
the Internet, a massive mechanism to denounce, to outrage, to amplify and, if 
necessary, to distort and to propagate. 
This phenomenon has two implications for the scandal: the magnitude of 
its reach to increasingly distant audiences, and at the same time the 
diminution of its lifespan, with one scandal following another at a frantic 
pace, buffeting the collective emotions that currently run through human 
societies. 

Hostility, from Yesterday to Today     73 
Finally, a word on the rituals that are part of the rules of the game. The 
attacker and the group under attack only have to behave well. Both, 
regardless of their level of outrage, would lose much of their standing in the 
public eye by behaving badly, by resorting to low blows, to insults, to 
swaggering (an attacker who resorts to these reveals his or her own self-
interest) and false testimony. 
In Imperial Rome under Constantine (330 AD), a rule on false accusations 
was in force: anyone who made wrongful accusations would suffer the 
penalty. Perhaps Imperial Rome was not too different from our own society. 
What can be learned from these findings, in order to help the Brand in a 
conflict? Let us recall that a scandal is always a moment of violence 
committed against the Brand, which is rarely prepared for it. The occurrence 
of a scandal requires crucial initial work to arbitrate the reaction time. 
Reacting immediately can provide the public with information that will lead 
many to decide that the scandal is baseless. 
Not reacting, or reacting late, is more delicate. Either the brand believes 
that it is a flash in the pan that will never amount to anything (and it had 
better be confident of this) or the Brand is stunned and must immediately 
find the means to get out of this state of paralysis in order to speak out. 
We believe that in all cases, silence is detrimental (for more, see our 
remarks on scapegoats). Getting a message out is indispensable, and in these 
pages we will describe the precautions and practices that we think are the 
most relevant. 
The Findus scandal 
On February 7 and 8, 2013, Findus published the results of DNA tests showing that 
certain batches of its products claiming to be pure beef contained 100% horse meat. 
The revelation of this scandal highlighted a serious fraud in the European meat sector, 
whose oversight had been shown to be lax at best. Many companies were involved, some 
were victims, some were the culprits, sometimes both, in an inextricable imbroglio.  
Findus took the action to “launch” the scandal, which its audience found out about 
instantly. The company suffered, but it certainly suffered less than if it had committed 
suicide by leaving itself open to attack by others. The government, by negotiating the 
application of new standards with Europe, resumed its role as market regulator. The 
intermediaries who acted on their own whims lost their domination. The conflict that existed 

74     New Technologies and Branding 
in the case of Findus is still playing out at a low level, but could be rekindled at any time by 
a new scandal involving other meat subsidiaries.  
Suffering from a low level of credibility, or even a real sense of mistrust, the food 
industry knows that, in a few minutes, it can lose the little confidence still retained by its 
consumers, who already feel guilty about consuming ready-made meals instead of cooking 
by themselves. Accused of offering products with a negative impact on health (too much fat, 
sugar, salt), the food industry has a vested interest in being transparent as soon as a scandal 
arises and, above all, making pledges for a serious commitment to not make the same 
mistake again. 
4.10. Alert launchers 
Although warning society of a danger at the risk of one’s own freedom 
(or life) is obviously not something new, the concept of an alerter (similar to 
a “whistleblower”) was conceptualized in its present form in 1980, gradually 
gaining legal protections. 
The definition, which refers to the Anglo-Saxon world, is as follows:  
“It involves the disclosure by members (current or past) of an 
organization of illegal, immoral and illegitimate practices under 
the control of their employers to third parties, who may take 
action”. 
This definition is to be compared, for example, with the legislation 
adopted in 2013 in France, which more broadly defines an alerter as:  
“Any natural or legal person has the right to make public or to 
divulge, in good faith, any information concerning an event, a 
data point or an action, as long as the ignorance of that fact, 
data point or action appears to him to be dangerous to health 
conditions or to the environment”. 
And there is an important distinction to make between an alerter and a 
whistleblower. Although a whistleblower denounces a divergence that has 
already taken place, an alerter may reveal a future danger or an unknown 
risk. Its field of action is therefore broader. 
Yet, despite the protections they benefit from (and which can also be 
challenged, either on a case by case basis, as in the case of Edward Snowden, 

Hostility, from Yesterday to Today     75 
or by less friendly legislation toward them1), the position of the alerter is not 
an easy one. 
Indeed, the alerter’s message calls into question trusted institutions. All 
experts, controls and evaluation bodies are shown as deficient and implicitly 
accused of incompetence. In addition, societies have always made trust a 
pillar of life in society. The place for alerters is therefore also tinged with 
some level of ambivalence, even though the alerter is working for the 
common good. 
Moreover, the mere fact that the alerter is convinced is not enough to be 
convincing, because in highly complex subjects, it is sometimes possible he 
or she might be mistaken. In short, depending on the severity of his or her 
speech, the alerter can find himself or herself isolated, denigrated and see his 
or her freedom threatened. 
The list of scandals revealed by alerters and whistleblowers has continued 
to lengthen since 1980, and today there is a real craze for alerters. This 
growing number of announcements and dangers also creates an excessive 
sensitivity within society to all alerts. 
It is interesting to note that alerters, by virtue of their position, are a 
symptom of a society in which the entities guaranteeing security and trust 
(the State and its institutions) are increasingly disparaged or even challenged 
by rampant levels of defiance. 
This hole is now increasingly occupied by organizations, associations and 
groups that take over the roles of States. 
Under increasing scrutiny, in a climate of increasing defiance, Brands are 
obviously not immune to missteps. One can only recognize the courage of 
the employers with enough moral conviction to expose themselves and 
reveal a conflict of interest or the harmfulness of a product that the company 
would seek to conceal. 
But we also need to be cautious about getting too worked up and 
acquiring too much of a taste for scandal, in a world where some will stop at

nothing to get their 15 minutes of fame. And for that reason, a scandal, 
whether justified or not, is a great way to capture people’s attention. 
As groups intended to set an example, brands must be aware of this – but 
this is not always enough to avoid a scandal, and the conflict can break out 
inside before spreading to the general public. Therefore, it is essential to 
prepare for conflict by building a strong Brand, with a clear, level-headed 
and educational message and tone. To hotly deny a rumor or a pseudo-
scandal can reinforce a negative image. That is why the brand must be built 
as a communicational entity, well-founded on its convictions, not hesitating 
to engage and to make them known. 
4.11. The social dynamics of conflict 
A conflict is a dynamic. It always designates how different elements are 
set into motion and then made to collide. In the previous section, we have 
analytically defined the five actors that make up any conflict. But the mere 
static knowledge of them is only a preliminary step. It becomes much more 
complex to understand how these different elements form, reconfigure and 
evolve in context.  
Within a conflict, a number of rules and social dynamics emerge and 
amplify clashes. Humans are not rational animals, or at least not always. 
Primitive mechanisms can come into play, especially in the case of a large 
community, and emotional tension is particularly strong.  
Modern, scientific, hyper-connected. The qualifiers to designate the 
individual of the 21st Century abound. However, at a glance, we can see that 
our relationship with the facts is complex, and that people prefer to believe 
rumors, and that too convenient a coincidence is inevitably an irrefutable 
clue that a conspiracy must be going on. These social dynamics are inherent 
in all societies. Rumors, exchanges and informal conversations are part of 
life in society. But this exchange of information is done without any control, 
with the ever-present possibility of a spectacular wreck.  
Assemble a large community of different people and you will find several 
gregarious phenomena: imitations, then mimetic violence, crowd effects, 
which can lead to scapegoating, or even forms of violence such as lynching. 
The affections at play in a conflict can prove to be extremely powerful. It is 
better to prepare for it and to know the drivers at work in advance.  

Hostility, from Yesterday to Today     77 
4.12. Skepticism and modernity 
We are modern. And we have been modern since the scientific revolution 
dramatically altered our relationship with the world. We are modern, yes – 
since we became aware that we could make use of reason to understand the 
phenomena that surround us.  
This change of approach has been particularly productive in the sciences, 
and has enabled us to develop our scientific knowledge. Can we trust our 
senses? To answer this question, we prefer to use mathematical modeling. 
With an empirical investigation, we prefer to use the test procedures that 
utilize controlled environments.  
Nature, wrote philosopher Francis Bacon, makes it easier for its secrets to 
become known when it is tormented and tortured by art, than when it is left 
to its own purposes. Because we do not rely solely on what we see, we know 
that the earth is not flat and that it revolves around the sun.  
Here, philosophy and science go hand in hand, each one comforting the 
other and helping to develop the vision of the world that we have today. One 
example is Descartes’ radical doubt, perfectly embodying this mistrust of the 
senses. Even beyond the senses, it is the questioning of what is immediate, 
or “obvious”, which is subject to doubt.  
We are not all great readers of Descartes and do not all have the habit of 
creating counter-intuitive mathematical models (think of the theories of 
general and limited relativity), and yet, science and philosophy have 
permeated all of society. Though we are not able to explain them in detail, 
our vision of the world and our expectations are marked by the technological 
successes that have stemmed from it.  
But this view of the world is not without impact on our relationship with 
any obvious information. If natural phenomena are not summed up in what 
we see, by extension, the information we are given is also subject to caution.  
The influence of advertising has contributed greatly to this defiance in the 
messaging of the Brand, after so many exaggerated promises and scandals 
that have shaken the world, making it difficult today to accept any speeches 
as gold.  

78     New Technologies and Branding 
Doubt is now everywhere, for two reasons. First, due to experience. If we 
have been deceived once (by a brand, a sector, etc.), our trust is a commodity 
that is too precious and fragile to be easily rebuilt. The second is that, thanks 
to our vision of the modern world, our instincts drive us to always look 
behind the obvious. Today, the Cartesian notion of radical doubt is the most 
common thing in the world. And it is not necessary to have the arguments 
and the intellectual power of Descartes to simply formulate a belief that “if it 
can be found, it’s not so simple…”.  
This doubt seems widespread, as if in suspense. Anything that is shown 
to us can be clouded by doubt. Thus, it is a matter of crystallization that, 
through a phenomenon almost like chemical precipitation, this doubt 
becomes a profound challenge, or even breaks open a conflict that afflicts 
the Brand.  
So it is difficult to backtrack because it is simply going against a 
propensity widely disseminated throughout society. To summarize it as 
bluntly as possible: why trust Brands, even though our senses and nature 
itself deceive us? 
This sentiment, which is perfectly rational and in keeping with modern 
life, also fits within the logic of the phenomena of conspiracy theories. If 
events do not make immediate sense, there must be some reason behind 
them. The principles of science, as well as those of conspiracies, are that 
everything happens for a reason. If a rock falls, or if sugar dissolves in water, 
then there is a reason for it. A parallel can quickly be made with the type of 
reasoning that holds that if such an attack or failure has happened, it has 
happened for a reason.  
4.13. Conspiracy theorizing 
A landmark event, like an act of terrorism, focuses millions of eyes on it 
that pry open every crack. In this way, it is fascinating and tragic to see the 
countless troubling coincidences that can emerge. Our sensitivity to 
coincidences is multiplied by the interest generated by the event. This is 
what prompts us to interpret each coincidence, to varying degrees, as a clue, 
providing us with a new lead. 

Hostility, from Yesterday to Today     79 
A stimulating and useful cure can be found on the Website Spurious 
Correlation2, which brings together similarities that could be particularly 
troubling, if their subject matter did not waver between the intricate and the 
absurd.  
Like rumors, conspiracy theories can come out of nowhere, some gaining 
immediate and lasting visibility while others remaining the mere dreams of 
the enlightened. This brings us to the question of the unconscious beliefs of 
contemporary societies, and this is what makes the issue of conspiracies both 
fascinating and also extremely complex to deal with. 
Conspiracy theories gain high visibility since they relate to current events 
that are particularly symbolic and extraordinary. The attacks of 
September 11th are a perfect example of this. 
The fundamental motivator that experts in conspiracy theories have 
isolated is the following: when faced with a reality that does not make sense, 
or a series of incomprehensible events, a secret explanation that claims to 
explain everything will then be invented. But coincidences are far more 
numerous than we might think, and the principle of conspiracies is to 
accumulate facts that would tend to support them and neglect all others. 
Although we approach conspiracy theories from this perspective, it is 
with a kind of two-sided logic: a Brand that is too powerful or too visible 
may very well suffer from rumors of conspiracy. Learning how to deal with 
this type of crisis is essential. 
But conspiracy theories can also emerge not from outside, but from 
within the company itself, with all of its leaders coming to hold the most 
negative facts that they come across, seeking to bring them together within a 
single narrative. The narrative driving this story, intended to win the 
conviction of an uninitiated observer, is: “how do you explain that X and Y 
occurred?” 
4.14. The scapegoat 
The custom of accusing some poor animal of all the ills of society, and 
then abandoning it in the wilderness, is a strange one indeed. But from the 
                            
2 http://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations. 

80     New Technologies and Branding 
dawn of civilization to today, the practice of scapegoating has persisted. 
Why does it still happen? According to the analyses of René Girard, simply 
because this practice is a social response to social problems. 
Every society creates tensions and frustrations and faces difficulties 
(inequality, fear, uncertainty, etc.). When these tensions become too strong, 
they can lead to clashes, and even a complete dissolution of society. 
Thus, a scapegoat is brought in as a protective solution, a valve, aimed at 
releasing this tension. The mechanism is very simple: a person, a group or an 
institution (preferably an innocent one) is designated as being responsible for 
all that is bad, and presented as a victim to the crowd. 
Although politicians are often accused of using scapegoats to hide the 
real problems, or to make people forget about their responsibility, it is 
important to note that a scapegoat cannot be chosen at random. Not everyone 
would make a good scapegoat. There are a number of criteria that need to be 
met so that mob mentality can set in, for there to be a shared and recognized 
form of alledged evidence when accusing a particular group (i.e. that 
immigrants abuse assistance, or that alternative sexualities pervert society). 
The scapegoats are often already victims of a negative reputation that 
makes them feel condemned to silence, or even sometimes believe they 
deserve their fate (in history, trials for witchcraft gave this kind of result, or 
in more recent history, some trials held by the Soviets against “enemies of 
the people”). 
The scapegoat is thus an identified person or group that the community or 
society will then harass, accusing it of misdeeds that it has not committed. It 
is, in a way, the perfect culprit. And it is all the more ideal if the scapegoat 
only protests weakly and that its guilt is already widely recognized on the 
basis that “everyone knows perfectly well that…”. 
René Girard, an anthropologist and philosopher, has devoted much of his 
work to exploring these phenomena. For him, the logic of scapegoating is 
not just one historical trend among many others. He makes it into a unitary 
theory, or even a complete interpretative system – this extension of its scope 
is also what is most reproached, but we will not go further in this debate. 

Hostility, from Yesterday to Today     81 
The scapegoat theory is a powerful explanatory paradigm, which itself is 
backed by a complex underlying theoretical architecture. For René Girard, it 
is mimetic desire that is at the root of violence in society. The idea behind 
this theory is that every desire is an imitation of what is desired by others. 
An object becomes all the more interesting once someone else wants it. To 
put it briefly, desire is not direct, but is always processed through the desires 
of others. 
An example that is often used to illustrate this phenomenon involves a 
group of children playing in a room with enough different toys for everyone. 
But the children prefer to take the toys that are already in someone else’s 
hands. 
Mimetic desire does not simply govern interpersonal relationships, but is 
the driving force behind the violence in society, leading to a rivalry of 
individuals seeking to obtain the same products. And this desire is 
contagious. A mimetic conflict is thus quickly transformed into a broad 
confrontation. 
Once this dynamic of violence is triggered and the mimetic desire has 
spread to society as a whole, the stability and even the survival of society is 
compromised. 
To counteract this enmity that cripples cooperation, an individual is thus 
chosen to be sacrificed. The purpose of this sacrifice is specifically to 
channel this violence, at least temporarily. 
Ritual violence and sacrifice seem to refer to primitive practices or 
describe ancient religious practices. René Girard’s intuition is that our 
civilized societies obey the same pattern: 
“However”, René Girard tells us, “It is not clear whether 
communities can do without the regulatory function of the 
scapegoat: it should be noted that modern societies, in periods 
of strong mimetic crisis, also resort to it, and do so as if they 
had forgotten that it was a barbaric and irrational process”. 
The scapegoat is defined by several criteria:  
“Firstly, the victim must be both sufficiently distant from the 
group in order to be sacrificed without everyone else feeling 

82     New Technologies and Branding 
targeted by this brutality, and at the same time, close enough to 
be able to establish a cathartic link. Secondly, the group must 
not know that the victim is innocent; otherwise, the effects of 
the process may be neutralized. Third, the scapegoat often has 
extreme qualities: wealth or poverty, beauty or ugliness, vice or 
virtue, strength or weakness. Finally, the victim must partly 
consent, so as to transform the delusion of persecution into 
consensual truth”3. 
How important are these remarks for a Brand in conflict? Absolutely 
crucial! A Brand holds a significant level of visibility in society. That is to 
say that, for better or for worse, it plays the role of a symbolic reference 
point, and occupies a place formerly reserved for sacred beliefs. 
Moreover, in a retail company, advertising operates on the very same 
mechanism of mimetic desire. Because I am shown an actor or a singer with 
a certain product, I will in turn also want this product. Modern consumerism 
is based on the media’s desire to transmit and spread this desire. 
In a sense, the Brand is able to wind up the spring of mimetic desire to its 
point of maximum tension. With this configuration, it can appear that if the 
tension eventually becomes unbearable, the return force will take this same 
exact route and ultimately designate a culprit, a scapegoat who will be 
responsible for all ills. 
These mechanisms are extremely complex, and though the mechanics 
seem simple in theory, in practice they are extremely malleable, taking on 
forms and speeches that are always different and in a constant state of flux. 
The interest in keeping this dynamic of mimetic desire and sacrifice in mind 
is that one can try to act on these forces while they are in motion, before they 
settle on an identified victim. 
One of the characteristics of the scapegoat is that, to a certain extent, it 
consents to and accepts a share of the guilt. In this sense, it is essential to 
adopt a deliberate posture and a strong and level-headed message to the 
contrary in the early stages of the conflict.

Hostility, from Yesterday to Today     83 
Conversely, once the conflict has broken out, one of the worst things a 
brand can do is to yield to the mimetic desires that lead to extreme rivalry. 
Are your critics organizing a press conference? You will be tempted to 
organize a bigger one. Did a newspaper publish an article voicing your 
critics’ opinions? You will want to get a well-read newspaper to repeat your 
own. In this game of one-upmanship, the Brand actually has much more to 
lose than to win, because it finds itself in a position of always keeping up, 
always following, arrogant for wanting to enter the competition. 
On the contrary, it is essential to refuse to give ground to the adversary 
and to let your voice be heard on your own ground. Adopt a strategy of 
proving yourself through your commitment and concrete actions. Above all, 
do not remain silent and do not be a consenting victim. Make yourself heard! 
And this requires having previously built up a strong, stabilized, confident 
brand with its own opinions and message. 
4.15. The mystery of herd behaviors 
Lynching is a widely studied phenomenon in social psychology, but these 
studies, as fascinating as they are, leave us with the bitter taste of an 
instinctive brutality, barely contained by the rules of life in civil society, like 
a thin protective layer ready to crack open at any moment. 
The mere fact of being able to join a group, to be mixed in with a crowd, 
can lead anyone to lose some of their self-awareness, and to temporarily 
shed their education, culture, values and beliefs, adopting totally contrary 
attitudes. Researchers refer to the concept of individuation,4 which is 
characterized by a sudden loss of inhibitions and an erasure of the notion of 
responsibility, leaving room for these extreme behaviors. No motivation can 
be suggested. Sadism occurs as a distraction, an exciting and irrepressible 
curiosity. After the fact, the justification – which is inevitably a very poor 
one – is reduced to “everyone else was doing it”. 
Do these “flash mobs” leave room for individual initiatives to reason with 
the group and try to end the lynching? Specialists explain that this is rare, as 
                            
4 In 1952, the concept of “deindividuation” was created by Festinger (the “creator” of the theory 
of cognitive dissonance), Pepitone and Newcomb in their famous article: “Some consequences 
of individuation in a group”, Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology, no. 47, pp. 382–389, 
1952. 

84     New Technologies and Branding 
they observe that the greater the number of participants, the fewer third 
parties are found to intervene [BRO 16]. This phenomenon of general 
passivity, known as the “bystander effect”, was described in detail by the 
media in the case of Kitty Genovese. In 1964, this young American woman 
was murdered by a serial killer on her way home. She was stabbed twice in 
the span of half an hour, while she was outside calling for help. Thirty-eight 
witnesses were identified after the fact, but none of them intervened. Her 
calls for help were not specifically directed at any one individual. This 
“diluted” responsibility might explain the lack of action by the witnesses. 
These same findings apply in the conflicts that a Brand may encounter. It 
is not effective to urge people to be reasonable if this plea is directed to a 
crowd. On the other hand, focusing on one of the main players and calling 
for help specifically from them may be useful. 
4.16. Rumors 
The act of spreading rumors may well be one of the oldest activities in 
the world. An inexhaustible source of discoveries, conversations are bristling 
with all kinds of rumors – never verified, never certain, but so persistent that 
they become credible and can permanently stain someone’s reputation – or, 
for a brand, the relationship of trust that consumers can build with it. 
A particularly notable case of rumors having stuck to a Brand is that of 
Nature et Découvertes: as a result of an informal conversation, this Brand is 
now accused of being a front organization for a cult. Rumors and hearsay 
circulate incessantly, and a Brand cannot spend its time dispelling the most 
outlandish babblings and assertions. Moreover, doing so would probably be 
dangerous, because in what is quite a unique phenomenon, rumors are 
merely strengthened as they are firmly refuted. But once a rumor has 
tarnished a Brand’s reputation and really takes hold, the Brand is forced to 
react. Nature et Découvertes thus now has a disclaimer page on its Website 
exclusively refuting this rumor5, and has approached the bodies that verify 
cult behaviors to obtain an outside opinion from an arbitrator (see our 
description of the arbitrator in the five players).

Hostility, from Yesterday to Today     85 
Rumors, by their nature, do not need to be justified or backed up in any 
way. No evidence is required. It is enough to simply pass on information; the 
first person to have done so is never known. But if a rumor is well calibrated 
and finds its audience, then it is guaranteed an imposing future. In the case 
of Nature et Découvertes, the label was quickly confused with new age 
movements, some of which began to spread cult-like deviance, when this 
niche was still only in the backs of the minds of the consumers. Is this the 
fault of a troublesome but not malicious group that just happened to be 
similar? Maybe. Or perhaps it was a competitor who has succeeded in 
permanently weakening the brand in the minds of consumers.  
Mystery at CERN 
CERN (Centre Européen pour la Recherche Nucléaire [the European Organization for 
Nuclear Research]) is the largest center in the world for the study of particle physics. 
This establishment, considered to be theoretically above any suspicion, is regularly the 
subject of rumors, each one more outlandish and anxiety-provoking than the last. In a 2008 
article [DES 08] entitled “At CERN, rumors threaten researchers”, Olivier Dessibourg 
examined the rumors that were spreading and directly impacting the proper conduct of 
research. 
CERN was accused of hosting strange rituals, leading to human sacrifice at its site. A 
poor quality video shows figures wearing hoods, setting fire to a woman in front of a large 
statue of Shiva. The statue of Shiva is in fact quite real. It was given as a gift by India, in 
homage to the collaboration established with CERN, but the scene filmed at a distance and 
at night is obviously staged – but taken to be real by a number of Internet users. 
CERN chose to react by publishing a statement on its website, that is anachronistic to 
say the least, and that basically says: “no, this video is fiction. CERN hosts a large number 
of visitors during the summer, with users from all over the world, who come to the 
laboratory as part of their work. Some of them occasionally let their sense of humor get a bit 
carried away, and that’s exactly what happened with this video. CERN does not endorse this 
kind of parody”. 
4.17. The crowd 
The crowd is not a mass, nor is it the audience. The crowd is a complex 
entity, and those who analyze it struggle to define its contours, and 
especially to establish its characteristics.  

86     New Technologies and Branding 
A crowd is not a mere accumulation of individuals; rather, it goes beyond 
them and becomes an autonomous entity, taking on its own ideas and 
feelings, which are not the sum of the ideas and feelings of the individuals 
who form it.  
Gabriel Tarde and Gustave le Bon are undoubtedly the two authors who 
have devoted the largest volume of work to trying to define crowds and 
seeking to understand how they work. Gabriel Tarde has remained well-
known for his work on the rules of imitation that govern society, believing it 
to be the foundation of all social connectivity. It is interesting to note that 
imitation is not exact replication. There is an element of creativity that is 
possible with similar behaviors. Gustave Le Bon was particularly interested 
in the rules updated by Tarde and, in particular, his attempt to define crowds 
as uniform behaviors developed by the phenomenon of imitation. Le Bon’s 
book, Psychologie des foules (The Psychology of Crowds), in which he 
proposes different categories of crowds and their characteristics, seeks to 
further expand on the mechanisms that were identified by Tarde.  
The interest that these authors have in crowds is not a coincidence, and 
happened at a particular moment in history. Their main works, published in 
1895 and 1901, respectively, are largely influenced by political events and 
the echo of these events in the literature. The theory and scientific interest 
that they applied to crowds would actually have come from a desire to 
analyze what literature had been able to evoke in a metaphorical way.  
Except literature is not a true reflection of reality, and is quite capable of 
inventing these distinctive entities. Following the analysis of Vincent Rubio, 
the crowd is a fragile concept from a theoretical standpoint, but extremely 
fertile from a symbolic point of view. He does not hesitate to suggest that the 
importance given to crowds tells us more about the myths of our societies 
than about the crowds themselves.  
Indeed, crowds conceal an extremely powerful sense of the imaginary, 
which literature has been able to highlight perfectly. For Balzac, a crowd is a 
thousand-colored snake. This animal metaphor is not used by accident.  
The crowd invokes a blind mass, a return to an animal-like state, and the 
fall of reason. This binary perception of the crowd (animal-like, emotional, 
violent) is given in opposition to the ideals of politics (cultured, reasoned, 
peaceful). Upon closer examination, we see that our notion of the crowd has 

Hostility, from Yesterday to Today     87 
its roots in texts from antiquity. Let us rethink, for example Plato’s texts and 
his distrust of democracy after the death of Socrates. In the end, behind the 
use of the crowd and its perceived traits of irrationality and violence, the 
question arises of the politics of democracy.  
Tarde and Le Bon tried to provide a scientific framework for the issue of 
crowds, seeking to clarify this mystery that leads individuals, in certain 
circumstances, to become other people, and to give rise to a crowd with its 
own set of emotions. Yet their analyses, as interesting they are, are still weak 
from a scientific point of view, as often with insufficient support and 
centering around a tautological assertion: a crowd is what corresponds to a 
certain set of  characteristics, and those characteristics define the crowd.  
Can a Brand be a victim of a crowd? Nothing could be less certain. Yes, 
public opinion is important, and masses of individuals can join a movement, 
sign a petition in large numbers or go to the stores to protest. Is this then a 
crowd, a new entity that should be treated independently of the individuals 
who are part of it?  
The word “crowd” is a metaphor, just like the metaphors of a “media 
earthquake” or “tsunami of tweets”. These metaphors carry a set of ideas, 
images and memories that are shared by a given culture. Its positioning is 
particularly political, as has been observed, not by the specialists on crowds, 
but by historians of ideas. Behind the use of the crowd, what arises is the 
opposite of democracy, culture and the use of reasoned arguments.  
To deem that a conflict is only the expression of a crowd means closing 
the door on open exchange and on rationally formulated and level-headed 
exchange, right from the start.  
4.18. Lynching  
Lynching is the anarchic fury of a group, blown up exponentially, and 
directed against a single person, who is not given a chance to defend himself 
or herself. 
The Internet is the ideal place for lynching. Participation is simple, the 
group grows without difficulty, and the anonymity of it all removes all 
responsibility. 

88     New Technologies and Branding 
This technique sometimes creates irreparable damages for people in the 
younger generations. There are countless articles recounting cases of 
children and teenagers having committed suicide after being harassed by 
their peers, or even by someone who chose a target on the Internet at 
random. In 2010, part of the community on the website 4chan decided to 
make Jessi Slaughter (an 11-year-old American girl who made videos on 
YouTube) into their next target. Showing off her perfect physique, she 
quickly became the target of mockery, then a true lynching. 
For weeks, false alarms, death threats, unsolicited pizza deliveries and 
other “attention” was rained down on her, making the girl’s life a living hell. 
Awkward reactions from the girl and her father doing nothing did little but 
fan the flames.  
What characterizes the victim is having committed an initial error (even 
an insignificant one) and having been unable to provide explanation or 
justification, or to fight with sufficient intensity and authority from the 
earliest moments of lynching. 
The Brand thus appears to be an ideal target of lynching on the Internet, 
especially when it appears to suddenly be a new and successful entity: rich, 
relatively powerful and arrogant. If the lynchers choose to give any 
explanation at all of their maliciousness and violence afterward, it is often to 
hide behind the argument “anyway, they could have expected it!”. 
There are no good or bad behaviors in the face of a digital explosion of 
this kind. What seems to be the most effective is to correct the target of the 
wrath, to apologize (which is an art form in and of itself) and to wait for the 
storm to pass. 
Apologizing will be useful in the future, but rather ineffective in the 
moment, since lynchers quickly forget the reasons for their rage while they 
are still lashing out. 
4.19. Trust, the first victim of conflict 
No society can exist without trust, nor can commerce. And all conflicts 
damage trust. This somewhat banal observation has severe consequences for 
the relationship between the brand and the consumer-citizen. It has long 
been known that trust is an indispensable asset to trade, because it is the 

Hostility, from Yesterday to Today     89 
condition for cooperation. It is a difficult asset to create, and at the same 
time is particularly fragile. 
What is remarkable is that damaged trust is detrimental to both parties. 
For the brand, it is quite obvious: the confidence of its customers and its 
prospects has a direct impact on its activity and determines its durability. For 
the consumer, confidence in a brand is a guarantee of peace of mind, and a 
saving of time and money. 
Trust is mutually enriching. It is fundamental to redefine this complex 
concept in order to identify the process of its destruction and to fully 
understand the ways it can regenerate during a conflict. Trust is a state of 
accepted weakness that leads the individual who grants it to engage in a 
relationship when a risk exists. This risk is that the party being granted trust 
does not fully (or even at all) respect its commitment. This is therefore an 
intermediate state between belief and knowledge, which does not allow for 
any doubt to arise about the commitment of the other. 
Trust can be effectively taken on by its opposites: mistrust and suspicion. 
Mistrust is fear that results from taking risks. When the fear of risk exceeds 
the gain that can be expected from the trust that is granted, mistrust sets in. 
Mistrust is a more or less pronounced state of paranoia, which is 
expressed by a creeping suspicion, encouraged by deceit or manipulation. 
Mistrust leads to behaviors of prudence and reticence. Perception of mistrust 
occurs silently. Whoever feels it does not act, holds back and avoids the 
relationship. 
Distrust is quite different, because it causes rejection. It is a process of 
reflection that will determine attitudes of distancing, of conscious and 
intentional avoidance. You might say that when mistrust finds a basis to 
latch onto, it turns into distrust, which is more active and openly expressed. 
Since the 1950s, interpersonal trust has been the subject of many 
academic studies that have allowed us to decipher what trust is made up of. 
There are three qualities that can be found in people we trust: the ability to 
be able to tangibly fulfill commitments, honesty and goodwill. 

90     New Technologies and Branding 
Our belief in the anthropomimetic nature of brands has committed us to 
experience these three dimensions in the confidence that a consumer attaches 
to the brand.  
By using the criteria of competence, integrity and benevolence as a basis 
for trust, we have been able to find a perfect correlation.  
This approach has even allowed us to produce an index (CIB, an acronym 
from these three criteria), which allows us, through surveying, to measure 
the level of trust in a brand, thus providing experimental evidence for the 
works of [FRI 00, GUR 99, HES 95], who proposed a three-axis model of 
trust.  
In the world of commerce, our area of interest, things get a little more 
complicated. In addition to the status of consumer, there is the status of a 
citizen, because this double-pull is increasingly prevalent in the relationship 
that an individual and a brand can build together. 
Consumers are sensitive to respecting what could be best referred to as 
the basic contract, while citizens are mobilized by ethical and moral issues. 
These two facets of our relationship with brands do not mix, and confidence 
is divided. 
Let us take a famous example. In December 1999, the Erika, an aging oil 
tanker flying the Maltese flag and hauling a load for Total, split apart a few 
dozen miles off the coast of Brittany, resulting in a horrific oil slick covering 
nearly 200 km of coastline. 
Total took a strange approach to the management of the event. Thierry 
Demarest, the CEO of Total, waited 15 days to eventually go to the site and 
ultimately declare: “I am willing to give a day of my salary as 
compensation”. 
In early 2007, the trial for the Erika case began, which ultimately resulted 
in placing the responsibility squarely on the shoulders of Total. The boss 
compensated the victims, but refused to take the blame, arguing that he 
should not take the fall for the ship-owners and the oversight bodies. Total 
appealed, but was ultimately convicted in 2012 and its image was deeply 
scarred, on the reasoning that it is unacceptable for a company of this scale 

Hostility, from Yesterday to Today     91 
to flout the most basic precautions by using floating wrecks to minimize its 
costs. 
Citizens were indignant. Tristan Gascon-Breton, a business historian, 
points out that Total is such a popular company that the resentment felt 
toward it by the French is akin to a “disillusioned love”. 
Despite countless calls for a boycott, Total lost only 0.1% of its market 
share. Consumers did very little to hold Total to account, because the basic 
contract – providing an outstanding fuel at good quality petrol stations – was 
never broken. 
There is no shortage of examples of this schizophrenic reaction that 
affects us all: we can bash the practices of insurers and still appreciate 
having their backing, we are all too happy to denounce the practices of the 
banking sector without hating our own bankers, etc. 
The challenge only becomes really daunting for the brand when the two 
facets of the individual – the citizen and the consumer – both come into play. 
Another important consideration also needs to be understood in order to 
take part in a conflict: we gradually lose our ability to trust. 
This is not good news, but on the other hand, it is a phenomenon that can 
nonetheless be explained. 
The amount of trust that is given to a third party, a brand or an individual 
is the sum of two kinds of trust: “assured trust” (or confidence) and “decided 
trust”, which operate according to the principle that “a rising tide lifts all 
boats”. 
Assured trust is provided to us by laws, regulations, contracts, standards 
and even, supposedly, by labels, certifications and other control procedures 
(as long as they inspire confidence). 
Decided trust is the trust that is granted voluntarily, through a conscious 
and determined intellectual action. 
For example, when you have to cross a bridge, you are not likely to stop 
and consider whether you doubt the abilities of the architect or the honesty 
of the builders. Other people, specialized in the area, have tested it and 
verified it for you. They have given you assured trust. 

92     New Technologies and Branding 
If during a (long) trek, you come across a rope bridge over a deep gorge, 
it would be perfectly normal to doubt whether anyone had even bothered to 
inspect it. Here, assured trust is weak or non-existent, and if you decide to 
cross this rope bridge, it is because you have made a decision purely on the 
basis of decided trust. 
In Western societies, obsessed with zero risk strategies and crippled by 
the principle of precaution, assured trust takes on an increasingly pervasive 
share. With laws, regulations, bans and above all calls for caution, safety 
injunctions accumulate at a dangerous pace. The portion left to decided trust 
reduces every day.  
As we see it, this is a huge danger. Decided trust is like a muscle that is 
atrophying, and the consequences of this disease are painful: conflicts 
multiply, especially those that involve Brands, and so do levels of 
indignation (moreover, audacious and risk-taking actions are increasingly 
seen as senseless and suspicious behavior, but that is not what we are 
covering in this book). 
As we have noted, confidence in the brand withers quickly in a conflict, 
and the disappearance of this vital element must become a major and 
immediate concern. The ideal initial reaction is to try to quantify the drop in 
confidence through a survey. But let us not forget that trust, considered as a 
whole, is not a good indicator. 
The impact of the conflict on each of the axes of trust – competence, 
integrity and benevolence – must be determined. Of course, this is a question 
that cannot be asked directly. Imagine a Brand asking you: “Do you still 
trust our level of competence?” or “Do you consider us to be an honest 
brand?” 
We have frequently applied measures to assess confidence in Brands, and 
have always designed and implemented a series of questions, an analysis of 
which has allowed us to indirectly measure the impact on each of the three 
dimensions of trust. 
The results show the magnitude of the efforts to be made in terms of 
action and in terms of communication. It is dangerous to rely only on 
communication alone, as it can appear to a large number of people as 
manipulation or empty rhetoric. 

Hostility, from Yesterday to Today     93 
The effectiveness of providing proof to back up promises is nothing 
revolutionary, but in the heat of the moment, it is easy to forget this common 
sense reflex. Once trust has been destroyed, its rebuilding must be a constant 
focus, behind all of the brand’s actions and messages, and involving and 
mobilizing all the functions of the organization.  
In French, the word “confiance” (meaning trust and/or confidence) is 
unique and without any nuance. There is no satisfying synonym for this 
complex and multifaceted concept. But in English, there are many more 
options, as there is a distinction between: 
– “trust”: a decided, almost rational action, based on reflection, and 
supported by observation and judgment. Trust is a cognitive process that is 
expressed by “I put my trust in…”; 
– “confidence”: more instilled with affectation and feelings, based on 
representations. Confidence is an emotional process that is expressed with a 
more spontaneous message: “I feel confident about…”; 
– “reliance”: describes an abandonment of the self in a relationship, a 
state of almost intentional dependence. Reliance is a conative process 
corresponding to the expression: “I defer to…”.

The Techniques of Conflict 
5.1. Old methods “botoxed” for the digital age 
We are all aware of the massive shifts that have taken place because of 
new communication technologies. It is particularly interesting to make a list 
of these changes. By doing so, we can see that many of the strategies of 
conflict and social dynamics that existed before this communications boom 
have now been able to adapt and find new life in the Internet age. In 1950, 
talk abounded about the Roswell conspiracy, in the first decade of the 2000s 
it was conspiracy theories surrounding September 11. Did we burn witches 
on the basis of mere rumors? Today, rumors can spread in just a few clicks, 
and burnings at the stake have given way to digital lynchings. Sadly, in 
many social dynamics we see that nothing has truly disappeared, and that 
everything (or almost everything) has simply transformed. In this, we must 
admit, social networks are a reflection of our human nature, our values and 
our often herd-like mentality. We shall now go through some techniques as 
old as time that have flourished in the digital age, finding a new life.  
5.1.1. The trap hoax 
The trap hoax can be distinguished from practical jokes (prank calls, most 
notably) because it is founded on motives that are much darker than the 
simple desire to have a laugh. Indeed, the trap hoax, as its name suggests, 
sets a trap, which implies a rather detailed knowledge of the operation of the 
target of the trap, bypassing its vigilance and its abilities to avoid falling into 
the trap that has been set.

96     New Technologies and Branding 
In many respects, the trap hoax borrows from the logic of terrorism, 
because it attempts to be invisible in its infiltration phase, it needs a trigger 
and finally, its implications are more symbolic than material and it has 
indiscriminate effects that go far beyond the target. 
It can be said that a hoax is not an end in itself, unlike a practical joke. Its 
strength is to be able to bypass the systems of controls, in this sense it must 
blend in an apparent conformity and above all, when presented, it must 
benefit from the confidence that is given fairly naturally to the entities 
responsible for overall control; this is why a hoax can only be one when it is 
publicly announced, thus plunging the “guarantors of truth” into disarray 
(they are caught off-guard) and then leaving the consumers doubtful, given 
the failure of this kind of oversight and thus the possibility of a previous 
weakness that no one would have detected. Therefore, distrust and fear are 
the main consequences of the trap hoax. 
Its impact is all the more powerful, given that it ridicules not just brands 
that may fall victim to them, but also certification entities and companies 
within the same sector.  
To understand the mechanism at work in hoaxes, it is extremely valuable 
to be able to find support in concrete cases. Thus, if it does not directly 
concern a brand, a hoax, as conceived by Pierre Barthélémy1, has the merit 
of giving a detailed presentation of the various stages of construction of a 
hoax and its effects.  
First of all, Pierre Barthélémy stresses the need to make a revelation. The 
hoax falls within the same category as terrorism, because anyone who 
creates one reveals their intention to enter into conflict only after the first 
attack has been made. Likewise, it has very little in terms of workable 
objectives that motivate action. Hoaxes do not cause magazines to close 
down. They dress their symbolic wounds and lose trust. But their editorial 
activity is not directly affected. It is an attention-grabbing event, whether 
alone or in a small group whose real damage is often weak, but whose 
symbolic implications are in fact disproportionate. Moreover, in this case, 
the hoax is a tool to carry forward a cause, a conviction (that a magazine is 
not serious, that a site has no reliable reviewers, etc.).

sur-wikipedia/. 

The Techniques of Conflict     97 
Thus, in a hoax, the person who makes the effort to do the attack is going 
after an organism or an institution without notifying it, and often without 
wanting to continue the conflict once the hoax has been completed. The 
similarities between the mechanics of terrorism and techniques of hoaxes are 
actually quite disturbing. Contrary to a classical antagonism, based on the 
binary distinction of us and them, the hoax begins by operating undercover.  
Indeed, to be successful, the hoax requires its opponent, its function and 
its protection procedures to be well known. An elaborate hoax cannot be 
created on an impulse or a moment of rage or anger. It must appear innocent 
in order to make it past the initial checkpoint and verification procedures. 
The hoax is based on the notion of appearance.  
A good hoax involves disguising it. It must blend in with its 
surroundings, which implies reconciling its more preposterous aspects with 
its more credible ones. This innocuous appearance thus seeks to deceive the 
true nature of the content. It is also a characteristic of any hoax. Indeed, a 
hoax is not revealed by itself. Why? Because it is always based on the 
legitimacy of a trusted third party. Whether this third party is a magazine or 
Wikipedia, these institutions benefit from some credibility in the reader’s 
mind. The procedures of the departments are intended to guarantee quality. 
An inexperienced reader of a given subject can therefore trust what he reads 
from these outlets, since a publisher has been responsible for guaranteeing 
the quality.  
In fact, in reading a hoax article, readers give the source the benefit of the 
doubt, seeking to make sense of it. Just because the article seems dry, 
complex or unintelligible, we should not dismiss that it may have a possible 
interest. This spirit of tolerance is certainly a bit utopian; many readers are 
content to shrug and move on to other things. But this benefit of the doubt 
and the credibility of the publication are precisely the first victims of the 
hoax.  
A hoax needs to be set off. It is kind of like a powder keg that you slide 
into a crack in the wall, but you still have to set the fuse on fire. The same is 
true for a hoax. If you do not say anything, the hoax will go unnoticed. It is 
important to publicly announce that this is a hoax. Benevolence and the 
benefit of the doubt might even want to make sense of, or find an interest in 
the article. It is therefore important for one to discredit one’s own article, 
such as the pirates of the French Astérix comic books.  

98     New Technologies and Branding 
Once this denunciation is done, there is nothing left to do. The 
mechanism has been set in motion. It is nothing more, and nothing less, than 
the strategy of the fly. Once the hoax is revealed, the detonation will 
undermine the entire target institution (brand, magazine, institution, etc.) and 
above all, it will affect its most valuable asset: trust. And when its trust is 
affected, the consequences are incalculable.  
You do not read a magazine to have something to read, you just need to 
have access to quality content. The hoax article proves to everyone that this 
content does not meet a sufficient level of quality. From that point on, its 
trustworthiness is called into question. If this article could slip through, how 
many other poor quality articles could also be put out? How many 
incompetent staffers or impostors (who have been careful to keep their 
identity a secret) have published something there?  
The shock wave reaches far beyond the hoax, attacking the trust placed in 
a third party, in all the content whose quality it was supposed to ensure, and 
by extension, the doubt can also spread to trusted third parties in a nearby 
sector.  
Hoaxes are a relatively accessible weapon, requiring little in the way of 
resources, but with a formidable reach. Often used in ideological conflicts, 
its mechanism is intended to serve as evidence of the supposed 
incompetence of the targeted sector, and it operates on the principle of 
analogy.  
If this article could make it through, how many other failures could have 
occurred…. The problem of the hoax is mainly the immeasurable impact it 
can have on the reputation of the previous and future content and its ability 
to discredit not only one player in particular, but also the whole profession.  
The example we have chosen to give involves a news article, but there 
can be many other kinds of instances in which we are led to place our trust.  
It is one thing to appeal to a spirit of critical thinking. And indeed, trust 
can also be an indicator of laziness or gullibility. But attacking a trusted 
entity is a dangerous game. In our complex societies, we cannot be 
specialists in everything. We are therefore required to delegate time and 
expertise to other entities.  

The Techniques of Conflict     99 
Even with the best efforts in the world, we cannot check the sources of 
the items we read, the cleanliness of the plates we eat off of and the toxicity 
of the shampoo we use.  
To attack entities with a trusted role is therefore highly damaging, and 
must weigh on everyone’s consciousness. 
Of course, the use of hoaxes is not limited to attacks on institutions. 
Brands themselves have enthusiastically seized on this technique, rarely for 
the purposes of denunciations, but to generate a surprise effect as a potent 
asset for their communications strategy. In many cases, this is a mistake, 
because the manipulation it requires is always very poorly received. Along 
these lines, Nana, the brand of feminine hygiene products, had publicized the 
upcoming release of its new innovation: a shredder, allowing users to 
eliminate their products after use. Messages were sent to journalists, who 
then undertook the task of verifying the information. And that was what they 
set out to do. 
In reality, it was a hoax, as many had suspected. But there was a steep 
price to be paid. Certainly there was an impact in the media, but to play with 
the media (the fourth estate) and knowingly deceive them was seen by 
everyone as being in good taste.  
The brand/hoax relationship has several dimensions. And it is obvious 
that it is the company that is being targeted by a hoax. Recently, Vinci, one 
of the first groups of BTP, saw its stock quote collapse (by 7 billion euros) in 
a matter of few minutes following the dissemination of false information. A 
press release went out quickly, announcing the resignation of Vinci’s chief 
financial officer following the severe misdirection in his recently published 
accounts. The contact details of the press representative were false and 
unable to be verified. The address of the Website was false as well. And yet, 
some media and news agencies let this information “slip through”. 
This kind of hoax is damaging on two fronts: to Vinci, first of all, but 
also to journalists and the news agencies whose vigilance – the main quality 
it claims to have – are revealed to have failed.

5.1.2. Denigration 
Similar in its results to rumors, denigration is an intentional action 
(whereas rumors are sometimes formed from talk, images and pure 
imagination that come together without any discernible conscious intention 
at the outset). Denigration is an action that is clearly committed in order to 
undermine the reputation of an adversary. As an example of this, in 2000, 
HEC set out to attack the ESSEC in Cergy as part of an operation today 
known by the evocative name of “Fumes”. This operation sought to create 
nothing less than a climate of defiance by disseminating false testimonies....  
The operation was presented in the contract as the “establishment of a 
media resonance fund and an influence network serving as an echo chamber 
for the attacks and concealing the true origin of the offensive”2. This type of 
operation is often totally invisible, leaving no trace, and all for a very 
reasonable budget.  
The operation could have been a success, but – disappointed by the 
slowness of the operations and the lateness of the results – the contract was 
broken unilaterally. Furious, Eric Denécé, a specialist in economic 
intelligence, then took the decision to talk to the media in 2004. This is one 
of the few cases where this type of operation has been unveiled with 
supporting evidence.  
Today, on the Internet, all it takes is to register with fake accounts and 
engage in conversations on forums or leave scathing testimonies in 
comments sections. This phenomenon is particularly well known to 
application developers on the AppStore who are regularly subjected to this 
type of fraud. If an application works a little too well from the point of view 
of a competitor, that competitor can just flood it with negative opinions. We 
have even seen attempts at racketeering emerge. The principle remains 
similar: pay us a given sum, or we will use robots to greatly lower the 
average score of your application. And on these digital platforms, the first 
impression is the only one that counts. When several million applications are 
competing against each other, the user will not take the time (and the risk) to 
see if any one of them is really as bad as the opinions say.

The Techniques of Conflict     101 
Business schools, applications, restaurants, doctors… now all services are 
rated online and anyone can give their opinion. It is very easy to influence 
these opinions when the verification conditions for reviews are so loose.  
5.1.3. Petitions 
The system of petitions is based on a very simple principle: it requires 
very little effort from a large body of people who merely indicate their 
approval of the subject of the petition by means of a signature. Regardless of 
the degree of commitment or degree of awareness of the real issues at hand, 
a signature is sufficient – and the larger the number, the more influence the 
petition is supposed to have. 
Here again, the Internet has been highly adept at integrating and 
multiplying the weight of these methods which existed well before the web 
and social networks. It is thus possible to gather more than 3 million people 
to support a second vote on Brexit, or 1.4 million signatures to force Bayer 
(unsuccessfully, as of the time of publication) to acknowledge the disastrous 
impact of its Gaucho pesticides on bees. While these particular figures are 
dizzying, even far more modest results can be sufficient to make Brands 
yield, especially in cases of petitions that could make brands worry about 
their sales: VertBaudet was accused of sexist remarks in one of its leaflets 
(“a bag as well-organized as Mom’s and tools and hardware like Dad’s: a 
selection of gifts for your child”) and apologized after facing a petition with 
3,000 signatures.  
More and more sites, with increasing visibility, make it possible to have 
petitions of any kind – from the serious to the truly bizarre – signed by 
massive groups of people3. The main sites capable of collecting large-scale 
petitions, and thus monitoring them closely, are change.org, avaaz.org and 
mesopinions.com.

was not a reptilian; available at  http://www.lemonde.fr/asie-pacifique/video/2014/02/17

5.1.4. Boycott and buycott 
Long regarded as a weapon of last resort for those with no resources, the 
boycott has been able to evolve along with the conflicts it has been 
associated with. Today, it has become a particularly effective weapon in the 
arsenal of contemporary activists. 
Though it would be tedious to list all the reasons drawn upon to rally 
people around a boycott (policy, health risk, disrespect of values, etc.), it can 
be noted that the process has been able to take advantage of new 
communications media. 
A boycott is a voluntary agreement made by a community to inflict 
economic damage on a business. The word “boycott” comes from Ireland, 
where a man named Charles Cunningham Boycott managed to unite the 
Land League, which later would bring him to ruin. 
The objective of this collective refusal is either to exert pressure or to 
retaliate for past actions. The effectiveness of a boycott on a Brand is 
twofold, as it can affect both the economic side as well as the intangible 
aspect that is brand image. Indeed, a boycott with high levels of adherence 
reaches far beyond the circle of those involved in it, extending to those who 
simply hear about it. The crisis can then lead to a longer and more diffuse 
conflict. 
As we have seen, boycotts can take many shapes and have adapted to 
different contexts. Thus, an interesting distinction emerges between boycotts 
and the concept of buycotts. The difference can be summed up as follows: A 
boycott involves not buying a particular product. Buycotts, in a certain way, 
represent the positive reverse side of this. They show our support of a 
product based on values. For example, choosing a fair product is a buycott 
because it is a committed purchase, since it is a matter of promoting a cause. 
The rapid emergence of labels in recent years is an example. They send 
out a positive message and make consumers an offer according to their 
values. 
J.-P. Bozonnet, a political scientist, tried to develop a composite sketch of 
these engaged consumers, those who are designated as “ethical consumers”. 
Their leading trait, which will not come as much of a surprise, is the 
politicized nature of their beliefs. A person who engages in a boycott often 

The Techniques of Conflict     103 
occupies a higher social level. However, this politicized aspect should be 
kept in perspective, because in boycotts or buycotts, it is not a question of 
following the opinions and directions of a party, but of regrouping by 
affinity of convictions. 
To sum up the results found by Bozonnet, the people most likely to 
adhere to a boycott movement are young, with a higher level of education, a 
relatively comfortable financial position and a strong interest in politics. It is 
also quite clear that they have a certain inclination to more left-leaning 
values. 
Carrying out a boycott is a complex process. It is fundamentally based on 
trust placed in a community. Boycotting is essentially like voting or paying 
with cash. If we are the only ones who believe in it, it does not work. A 
boycott implies a collective action, but in a particular form, since it consists 
of a multitude of small actions but does not rest on a crowd or an actual 
gathering. 
Boycotting involves communication to bring individuals together and 
connect them according to their choices and values. In a sense, only causes 
that organize collective action can maintain the community. There is no 
constraint or monitoring in a boycott, as it may exist in a direct or indirect 
way within a group: 
“Their main strength lies in their shared morality, which is 
based on a very strong consensus around injustice and the need 
to act”. [NYS 15] 
Boycotting is an action “in perfect keeping with the times” because it 
takes into account the individualism of consumers and suggests a shift of 
political power, with the possibility for the buyer to add political and value-
based weight to his actions as a consumer. As Ulrich Beck says, we are in 
the era of the political consumer – a sort of counteracting power against the 
classical political entities. 
While boycotting has been able to adapt to the constraints of the 
contemporary world and is often used against brands, this is partly because 
brands have become major reference points of contemporary society. 

104     New Technologies and Branding 
Brands give people meaning, and are valuable intangible assets for the 
companies behind them. Brands allow communities of consumers to form 
around them based on values such as surpassing oneself (Nike) or creativity 
(Apple). 
Brands thrive on a symbolic territory, where values, fulfillment and self-
edification are the cornerstones. Since this is no longer enough, and other 
values such as fair trade, respect for nature and sustainable development are 
beginning to take precedence, we are witnessing a “war of the gods” along 
the lines of what has been set out by Weber. That is, it is an almost total 
confrontation between different value systems, which are not compatible. 
In this sense, it is because Brands are fully exposed on the playing field 
of symbolic values that boycotts in the name of other values work so well: 
they work at the same level in the human mind. 
Any brand may be the subject of calls for boycotts, but levels of 
adherence will vary. In June 2015, Nutella, owned by Ferrero, experienced a 
thinly disguised call for a boycott by Ségolène Royal, then French Minister 
of the Environment (“We must stop eating Nutella because it contains palm 
oil”). This call received unprecedented media coverage, but not in the way 
intended by the person behind it. Indeed, even Greenpeace4 supported the 
brand that was under attack, and the political pressure was so strong that Ms. 
Royal was forced to make a public apology. 
Does this mean that any powerful brand can rely on its consumers to 
defend it? Not at all. Cases like Ferrero’s are rare. The more well known the 
brand, the more exposed it is. 
In one case, the Spanish subsidiary of Coca-Cola was the subject of a call 
for boycott. The case took place in early 2015. The Spanish subsidiary of 
Coca-Cola announced the closure of four of its 11 bottling plants, and with 
it, more than a thousand layoffs. The boycott movement was organized 
around the message: “If Madrid doesn’t produce it, Madrid won’t consume 
it”. Distribution of leaflets and support by leading figures, along with 
significant media coverage, ensured that the existence of this boycott would 
be communicated and well known. This pressure had an economic impact

The Techniques of Conflict     105 
(sales fell by 17%) and a legal one too, as the Audiencia Nacional (one of 
the highest courts in the country) declared the layoffs to be null and void. 
Conflict is also shifting toward having a more political nature. To defend 
a value or to publicize a worthy cause, it may be more productive to put 
pressure on a brand rather than on the more traditional players in politics. In 
a certain way, boycotting affirms the fact that companies themselves can 
change the world, and that traditional political forms are no longer the main 
vectors of this change but, at best, simple halls of records. 
This shift in power from the political sphere to the economic sphere was 
particularly felt in the clash between Apple and the FBI in the case of the 
San Bernadino killer. After the shooting that occurred on December 2, 2015, 
the investigators sought to unlock the attacker’s iPhone. This proved 
impossible, as the encryption on Apple’s products does not have a backdoor. 
The FBI initially requested that Apple provide backdoor access that would 
allow the authorities to access their users’ data. But the company 
categorically refused, so the FBI applied to a magistrate judge.  
This judicial process quickly became a political issue: Could a private 
player present itself as a champion of the protection of personal data against 
the demands of the State?  
Many technological players have supported Apple, especially in the still 
quite relevant context of the revelations of Edward Snowden regarding the 
illegal means of surveillance used by security agencies. In response, 
politicians put pressure on Apple, pleading with it to serve its country and to 
cooperate with national security interests. Donald Trump, then a candidate, 
clearly called for a boycott of the Brand.  
In the last chapter, we will see that the question of political context comes 
into play more acutely today than ever for a Brand in conflict. 
5.2. New digital techniques 
5.2.1. Astroturfing 
“Astroturfing” refers to a simulation of an activity or initiative that 
originates from ordinary citizens, but which is actually a wholly fabricated 
effort by a major player wishing to influence opinions.  

106     New Technologies and Branding 
“Astroturfing is a technique that consists of simulating the 
spontaneity of a movement. The motivations of those who carry 
out this type of practice are mainly political and economic. The 
idea is to justify a position based on what appears to be a 
demonstration of the will of the majority”.5 
This technique brings together all manner of techniques – manual or 
algorithmic –to simulate the activity of a crowd in a social network. 
“We can begin to think of something as astroturfing when 
several people interact together, without revealing their 
collusion in the same thread, in order to deceive anyone who is 
not in on the secret”. 
Astroturfing is sometimes represented as a specific manifestation of the 
digital age, but this is not really the case. This method is characterized as a 
technique of manipulation by the concerted action between people who 
know each other, yet do not disclose their relationship.  
The strategy is very simple. It involves creating the appearance that the 
movement has a large following when it is mostly only the expression of a 
small group that multiplies its actions. 
For the time being, Brands are not significantly affected by astroturfing. 
On the other hand, the technique is used regularly (perhaps too regularly) 
in the field of politics, in particular to try to influence political agendas. 
For example, South Korea heavily influenced public opinion during the 
2012 presidential elections with a large-scale defamation operation of the 
opposition candidate, orchestrated through a large network of false accounts 
on Twitter, operated by the country’s secret service:  
“During the presidential election between the outgoing 
conservative president and her progressive rival, an incredible 
number of tweets – 24 million – were fired off against this 
second candidate, accusing him of being a leader bankrolled by 
their neighbor and historic enemy, North Korea. In the weeks 
that followed, it was revealed that the operation was carried out

by the head of the Secret Service. Six hundred fictitious 
accounts and ten separate groups have been identified as having 
been at the root of one of the greatest digital manipulations in 
history”.6 
One of the few cases of astroturfing affecting a brand concerns Samsung, 
which tried to use this tactic on two separate occasions. The first time, an 
extensive campaign was organized against one of its competitors, HTC, by 
seeking to disseminate the idea that its competitor was experiencing a wave 
of technical problems. The second attempt used astroturfing and was 
nicknamed the Molitor pool affair. Samsung, for the launch of one of their 
smartphones, had organized an evening event at this location, with a DJ set 
and celebrity guests. For the event to go beyond the walls of the pool 
building and be widely relayed on social networks, Samsung had provided 
all the guests with the same photo and the instructions to post this photo with 
a caption – the same for all the stars. And what is more, some of the stars 
who had not been able to attend the event also received and posted the photo 
in question. The strategy was quickly found out because it was very poorly 
calibrated for success on social networks, which are particularly attentive to 
picking out highly polished content sent out by brands.  
The problem with astroturfing is that it targets the general public, but in 
order to reach it – as it is a small group – it uses a convenient shortcut: the 
media. 
The main techniques of astroturfing are in fact aimed at journalists, so 
that they cover what they perceive to be a movement of a popular 
expression.  
Twitter is the main social network used by journalists. It is reactive and 
ensures that the trends in opinion can be detected when they emerge. With 
this in mind, if we want to draw the attention of journalists to a given fight, it 
is crucial for the posts about it to start trending in order to be noticed; that is, 
they have to have enough popularity (calculated according to an algorithm) 
to be posted on the Twitter home page to entice users to join discussion and 
comment on the subject in front of them. And to make this happen, special 
techniques have been designed to simulate a spike in popularity. The

108     New Technologies and Branding 
mechanism is actually quite simple in theory. Open a few Twitter accounts, 
then post the same message several times on each account, with the same 
keywords. Several cases like this were observed, and in 2014, the AEGE7  
(a network of experts in economic intelligence) produced an alarming report 
explaining that instances of astroturfing are still believed to be increasing. 
Indeed, journalists are not yet prepared or trained to detect these attempts at 
manipulation that have just begun to arise on social networks. 
It is the principle of a two-step flow, a sociological strategy, which seeks 
to influence an “opinion leader” or an authority. But in general, journalists 
have insufficient preparation for detecting the phenomenon of astroturfing, 
and therefore can easily be conned. This was the case for France 3, which 
ran a poll on its site that was then hacked, or also the case of the Reims 
bikini. In July 2015, a young woman tanning in a bikini was the victim of an 
attack by another woman. What would have been just another unusual news 
story was instead reported in a newspaper as a religious problem: the outfit 
may have been considered provocative, and the aggression was a form of 
moral policing. Far right Twitter accounts quickly seized on the case, putting 
it in the spotlight of the national media and stirring up passions across the 
country.  
After the trending effect had passed, and given the broad reach that the 
case had attained, several journalists later came back to listen to the people 
involved. In reality, there were no religious motives in the case. The two 
young women acknowledged that the altercation arised from the curves and 
hang-ups of one of the two young women.  
Among the various forms that the astroturfing can take, we can observe 
an artificial snowballing effect on social networks, or even in petitions or 
polls rigged by votes cast by robots8. The idea behind astroturfing is not to 
directly manipulate the result of an investigation or the reputation of a brand, 
but to engage a herd-like movement (also known as a bandwagon effect, 
named for the wagons in parades where orchestras used to be located), which 
will be followed by Internet users, unaware of the fact that they have been 
manipulated.

The Techniques of Conflict     109 
Difficult to detect, these techniques are not yet widespread enough so that 
systematic countermeasures can be applied. And yet, these demonstrations 
increasingly pose a threat to the credibility of popular expressions on the 
Internet and their potential amplification in the media. As a result, a 
competitor or a group of opponents can capture the media’s attention by 
magnifying the number of sympathizers it actually has in society. 
For example, astroturfing campaigns can be done by paying Internet users 
to publicly criticize or protest against a competitor or its products on 
community spaces (social networks, forums, etc.) or to write customer 
opinions. These paid reviews can be published under authentic or false 
identities. It would appear that there are also software solutions or robots for 
launching astroturfing campaigns based on the use of a large number of false 
profiles or false identities9 (see our chapter on persona management). 
While it is obviously difficult to know the exact number of attempts at 
astroturfing (as successful campaigns are able to remain secret), we have 
found that many have still been denounced. Studies suggest that, first and 
foremost, it is the media that is able to identify them and to have its voice 
heard when it denounces this practice. (A single individual is more likely to 
be labeled as a conspirator.) However, organized communities and non-
profit associations are also uniquely invested in the pursuit of attempts to 
manipulate public opinion.

 of astroturfing campaigns

110     New Technologies and Branding 
As Sophie Boulay points out, in the conclusion of her article [BOU 12] 
dedicated to this phenomenon of manipulation, “astroturfing undermines 
authenticity, which is a precondition for any act of communication and any 
democratic process”. 
But we must continue to stress that one of the main victims in conflict is 
confidence, which is probably why this is one of the first targets of the 
attacker.  
5.2.2. Persona management 
A technique that is more polished than astroturfing, “persona 
management” takes aim at the same target, but involves a much higher level 
of sophistication. To produce a herd effect (or bandwagon effect), persona 
management does not rely on Twitter accounts that are opened up overnight, 
but rather on complete digital identities, developed over the long term, with 
a presence on several social networks and which maintain relationships with 
real people. Unlike astroturfing, where the borders are blurred with an 
organized movement to communicate effectively on social networks, in the 
case of persona management, there are clear acts of premeditation and a 
deceptive intent. These false profiles can operate undetected for several 
years; it has now been proven that some companies have patiently been 
constructing portfolios of false identities to be sold to the highest bidder. 
Thus, when an incident arises, these false identities – seemingly unrelated 
to each other – converge on forums and comments sections to spread a 
specially adapted message, giving the impression that a large majority of 
Internet users share the same view on these issues. The herd effect that may 
follow has been shown to bring down governments (this is what was 
attempted in Libya), so what chance does a Brand have? 
5.2.3. Google bombing 
Everyone has heard of the search engine Google. Used every day by 
hundreds of millions of people, the service has become known for the quality 
of its algorithms which, though the specific details of their architecture 
remain confidential, essentially work in the following way: the more a web 
page captures links or clicks, the more it is considered to appropriately 
respond to the query. In this way, Google is able to provide its main service 

The Techniques of Conflict     111 
to its users.  However, this operation also allows the possibility for users to 
wage all-out digital warfare, and to do so quite easily. 
Indeed, all it takes is to spread the association between a series of terms 
and a site, on forums, comments, sites, blogs, etc., in order for Google’s web 
crawlers to infer that there is a strong link between the site and a given series 
of terms. And in one particularly well-known case of Google bombing, the 
term in question was “miserable failure”, and the target was former U.S. 
President Bush. Primarily targeting politicians, the simplicity of this action 
has not gone unnoticed by people who wish to pick a fight with a Brand.  
If the phrase “asshole of the Web” was able to be redirected to the 
campaign site of a candidate in the French presidential elections of 2012, the 
same could be the case for Websites of large companies. TF1 was linked to 
the term “the dumbest site” while AOL was dubbed “more evil than Satan”. 
Google acted quickly, because the company was not too happy to see the 
results of its algorithms being manipulated. Still, given the time it takes to 
set the record straight, the damage has often already been done. As soon as 
the information spreads, the temptation is too strong to try it for oneself, thus 
further enhancing this effect.  
5.2.4. Trolling 
The Internet, an important place for social exchanges, has sadly become 
known for its hateful discussions as well, which can rotate in circles, 
blocking all listening or formation of intelligent arguments, let alone any 
forward progress. This phenomenon of aggression has become known as 
trolling, and those who practice it are referred to as “trolls”. The main 
activity of a troll is to butt into any conversation and to quickly radicalize the 
debate by exaggerating the positions being taken, often resulting in 
excessive, emotional and wholly unproductive reactions [STE 16]. 
A Brand that does not communicate is a Brand that does not exist. But of 
course, communicating also means opening oneself up to attacks. And 
communication is not only one way. If a Brand speaks, it must also accept 
that it will be answered, or may even lose control of the message. It is a bit 
like going to a party where someone brings up a topic of conversation that 
then turns to an ongoing tense exchange between two stances.  

112     New Technologies and Branding 
Digital speech is not immune to this possibility, and the Brand’s message 
can either be transmitted, appreciated, welcomed or, conversely, be hotly 
contested, particularly in the context of a conflict.  
Even though the digital world is virtual and intangible, communication 
on the Internet follows the same principles as traditional communication – 
but the dynamics and demonstrations take on a unique twist.  
In particular, it is important for the brand and its leaders to know who is 
against them and what communities are hostile to them, including those in a 
latent state.  
A well-known aspect of social networks, trolls can sap or even paralyze 
the message of a Brand. Trolling is a phenomenon that emerges 
spontaneously, feeding on the conflict of brands. Any exchange or comment 
posted on the Internet can give rise to derogatory remarks, and a Brand 
embedded in a conflict is a choice target for this kind of practice. It is red 
meat for trolls, quick to descend on it.  
In 2011, researchers [COE 17] examined nearly 6,400 comments on 300 
articles published on the Website of an American newspaper, the Arizona 
Daily Star. This study is extremely valuable, as it helps to highlight the 
dynamics of aggression in electronic exchanges.  
Among the different traits emerging from this phenomenon, it can be 
noted that the most heated exchanges do not come from the most regular 
users, but those writing on a more occasional basis. Regular commenters are 
familiar with the community’s rules of use and have more of an investment. 
A one-time user does not feel committed to the intangible rules that regulate 
discussion. There is an intangible fabric that connects members of a group – 
even a digital one like a forum. Leaders emerge, values are shared and a 
common history connects the group. A troll enters to challenge this very 
consensus, out of habit more often than not, or out of some dislike for 
rational order. A troll can see him or herself as someone testing the 
resistance of the community. Antonio Casilli, the author of Les Liaisons 
Numériques (“Digital Relationships”), breaks trolls into two categories: first, 
the “pure troll”, who uses out-of-context attacks to directly implicate the 
members of the community. And second, the “hybrid troll” who mixes 
his/her attacks with a form of activism or specific claims. 

The Techniques of Conflict     113 
From a sociological point of view, the phenomenon of trolling is very 
interesting, because it helps make it possible to understand the fabric that 
connects a virtual community, such as the users who gather on a forum or a 
Facebook page to share a passion or a common interest.  
Using attacks, the troll raises questions about the things that bring the 
community together. And beyond acts of aggression, the troll also plays an 
important social role: challenging hierarchies, and questioning authorities 
and preconceived ideas. When seniority is the only authority on a forum, 
trolls can make it possible for this authority to be questioned.  
The attitude adopted by users toward trolls is also noteworthy. We can 
observe different reactions: rejection and insult (a mimetic logic), but also a 
more educational stance (“You can’t say this, because...”), which benefits 
the entire community (without having a real influence on the troll). This 
position of exchange and dialogue makes it possible to turn the arrival of the 
troll in a community into a moment that makes new content emerge and 
draws the community more tightly together. The negative perception of the 
troll allows the community to identify themselves positively and to 
strengthen themselves.  
“Far from harming the community, the troll keeps it alive, active, lively. 
Thanks to the troll, the community strengthens itself in turn”.10 
In reality, the aggressive behavior of some marginalized people is not 
seen as a threat to the community, but on the contrary, as an invitation to 
speak to reaffirm or reformulate the reason why it exists, which brings 
together Internet users on this particular page and not another.  
Of course, for attentive readers who remember our remarks about the 
scapegoat mechanism, there is a lot that will seem familiar to you in the 
description of these mechanisms. Indeed, in this cohesion that has been 
found, it is difficult not to see a dynamic similar to the phenomena of 
persecution denounced by René Girard.  
While trolls on the Internet do not seem to have any direct connection 
with Scandinavian mythology (since Scandinavian trolls are not particularly 
endearing, and instead present the traits of a hard-to-control temperament), 
                            
10 https://blogs.mediapart.fr/edition/club-acte-2/article/110211/les-sociabilites-neuves-des-com- 
munautes-dinformation. 

114     New Technologies and Branding 
another Scandinavian character type might provide some interesting insight 
on these disturbances whose effect is sometimes positive on the community: 
the trickster figure. This position, as described by anthropologist B. 
Coleman, allows us to see both positive and negative aspects in these 
individuals, and especially in these practices. Though it produces chaos and 
disorder wherever it goes, the trickster is not fundamentally malicious. In the 
end, is not this multifaceted nature somehow symbolic of communications, 
always likely to run into some misunderstanding?  
5.2.5. Denial of service attacks 
Denial of service (DoS) attacks first appeared in the 1980s. DoS should 
be understood to imply the neutralization of service. 
While some claim that men can only do one thing at a time while women 
can do several, computer servers are able to carry out thousands of 
operations each second. But we all have limits. And as soon as we go 
beyond our limits, we cannot do anything at all. A DoS attack works 
according to this principle. Using a network of computers, it overwhelms the 
server, making the site or database inaccessible. 
While creating this type of attack requires skills that go beyond what 
most Internet users have, groups with mafia ties have the economic 
resources to conduct such an operation in order to perpetrate acts of 
racketeering. Similarly, activist groups such as Anonymous have regularly 
made use of these attacks to make their disapproval known. 
Today, all Brands have a Website to make themselves known, and of 
course, to ensure their market activity. If these sites are abruptly taken 
offline, the consequences can be dramatic. 
The case of OVH 
In October 2016, the operations of the hosting service OVH were considerably slowed 
down by a massive denial of service attack, clearly one of the most severe known to date. 
Experts in conflict studies agree that the conflicts to come in the future will be primarily 
digital. In this sense, this episode, like hundreds of others around the world the same year, is 
an indicator of virtual wars to come, the consequences of which will be quite real if the 
infrastructure of the target country is paralyzed. The economy, transportation, energy 
distribution, hospitals and the military can be neutralized, which can lead to exorbitant costs 
and even loss of life. 

The Techniques of Conflict     115 
These large-scale attacks are not carried out exclusively by governments or mafia 
organizations with significant financial resources. Even small groups can successfully 
infiltrate the Internet of Things. And indeed, the attack suffered by OVH came from a 
connected network of nearly 150,000 infected cameras. 
Though Brands are not greatly affected today, they are potential targets for denial of 
service. Without trying to be prophets of doom, we must acknowledge that we will indeed 
see attacks of this type within the world of organizations and Brands. 
5.3. Databases as a tool for scandal-mongering 
Once a scandal emerges, the informer is obliged to contribute to 
formulating the denunciation, both in terms of an explanation for 
understanding how standards have been violated, as well as providing 
evidence – texts, testimonies, photos, videos, etc. – that support the nature of 
the scandal. 
The most contemporary of these instruments for providing visibility is the 
database. 
Sylvain Parasie [PAR 13] wrote an excellent article on this topic in which 
he argues that databases are “scandal machines”. Initially limited to use by 
institutions, we can now determine that they have become democratized. For 
several years and especially in the United States, databases have become one 
of the pieces of the puzzle of scandal-mongering. 
One of the best known cases is WikiLeaks (from the root word wiki: a 
means of knowledge aggregation by and for a community), created by Julian 
Assange in 2006, which since its creation has published millions of 
documents denouncing cases of corruption, human rights infringements and 
state scandals affecting dozens of countries. 
Databases, these “scandal machines”, are still slow to develop in Europe. 
The Website www.nosdeputes.fr, which reveals the attendance and activity 
of French members of parliament, among other things, may receive little 
media coverage, but it is well known to journalists. 
Some accuse databases of producing only dry information impossible to 
make sense of. By modifying the man/machine ratio in the processes of  
 
 

116     New Technologies and Branding 
producing outrage, databases fulfill another role, and will fully and quickly 
participate in scandal-mongering strategies, and they will do so to the point 
that they will no longer be used merely by whistle blowers, but also by those 
being denounced in order to spread their messages.

Preparing for Conflict 
6.1. Building a strong brand 
What is most commonly understood by preparing for conflict involves 
making arrangements for the purpose of entering a battle that is either likely, 
imminent or has just broken out. It is thus a matter of protecting your 
territory, arming yourself, watching your back, counting and mobilizing your 
allies and estimating the resources needed in order to weather the conflict. 
Simmel observed that the impact of a conflict on an organization is never 
identical, depending on its degree of organization.  
“This here is one of the reasons why very well-organized 
communities can withstand more breakages and friction than 
more mechanical conglomerates, without internal cohesion”. 
[SIM 15, p. 49] 
Preparing for conflict evokes the strategy of a battle, whereas we see it 
instead as the art of war, to be prepared during peacetime rather than in the 
heat of a conflict that has already struck. Time considerations are not the 
same in peacetime as they are in wartime. 
In a period of calm, conflict is only an eventuality, an uncertainty, an 
event that may never occur and that must be approached with calm and 
distance. To prepare for this, it can be as much a matter of education as it is 
of specific training. 
All cultures of the world teach us that physical and mental strength 
acquired over time, as well as moral values and individual qualities are

indispensable assets to confront adversity and to have the best odds of 
overcoming it. 
The same goes for Brands since we consider them as anthropomimetic 
constructions. 
In our professional practice, we are asked to build strong brands and give 
them life. This mission is obviously not limited to preparing a Brand for a 
conflict, but for giving it the strength to grow, to evolve and to last in a 
complex and demanding world. 
Sometimes, conflicts can arise. What we have done over the life of the 
brand during periods of peace proves its usefulness during difficult times. 
Our commitment to build brands naturally leads us to also act on all the 
events over the life of a Brand that would be able to bring it down. And 
conflict is one of them. 
The interest in giving the physical, moral, mental and intellectual 
“weapons” to a growing man – or to a Brand that is making progress and 
gaining ground – is clear and will ensure his future, regardless of how tough 
it may come to be. Common wisdom even tells us this through its tales and 
legends. 
The most edifying narrative is a traditional European tale that we all 
know, first written down during the 18th Century, though its oral retellings 
certainly date back much earlier. 
This tale, in its most famous version, is known as The Three Little Pigs. 
Many variants exist (such as The Wolf and the Three Geese in the Italian 
Tyrol region, and the German tale of The Wolf and the Seven Little Goats, as 
told by the Brothers Grimm). All of these tales describe the virtues of 
making a liberating departure from home to succeed by oneself and the ways 
to overcome the risks of being exposed to the cruelty of society. 
In each of these narratives, several individuals of the same origin 
(siblings) distinguish themselves through their courage, effort and 
intelligence. In the most common version, the lazy one protects himself in a 
house of straw, the next in a house of twigs, and the more mature, intelligent 
and courageous one takes the time to build his house from more solid 
materials (in the version told by the English, bricks; in the German version, 

Preparing for Conflict     119 
iron). The last of the little pigs survives (or saves his brothers, depending on 
the version). 
And this is the moral of the story: only those who build a solid foundation 
can last in the face of difficulties. The lesson is well known in human 
society, even if it is applied in various ways, but it is not yet a reflex in the 
area of organizations. We would bet that it is careful thought rather than 
being put to the test that will overcome this lack of preparation. 
We will now discuss a few of the rules for building a strong brand, in 
particular the stages of this building process, which will be indispensable in 
conflict situations, and then the most useful actions to specifically prepare 
for a conflict. 
Building a Brand is a job for an architect, because a Brand is like a 
building. In popular narratives, and in real life too, the buildings we build are 
either flimsy or strong. Similarly, there are weak Brands and strong Brands. 
A strong brand is a solid building built on solid foundations, a building 
that must be constructed, and then maintained, restored, embellished, 
enlarged and sometimes rebuilt. 
It is the work of an architect who knows how to listen to his backers, who 
knows how to meet them at the key stages of the project before the project 
has been decided in its entirety, who knows how to challenge requests, 
setting aside the dreams that are impossible to achieve, including his own, 
and who knows how to surprise without creating fear, and innovate without 
becoming delusional. 
He builds plans mentally before carrying them out on paper. He makes 
the broad strokes first, and in pencil, because then it is easy to erase and start 
again. Then, in order to relate the choices he makes, he creates models and 
sets up plans that his skill and experience allow him to master. 
If he is convincing, his idea will go into construction. Construction itself 
begins with the bases, the foundations, which will support the visible part of 
the building. This is called the brand platform. 
The final step is to make the Brand come alive, to give it life, to give it 
what it needs to shine. A well thought out, well built and properly inhabited 
brand is a force to be reckoned with, strong in the face of the world’s 

120     New Technologies and Branding 
conflicts. Pencils and erasers are not the only tools for brand architecture. 
There are several models that allow us to structure our thinking in order to 
stabilize the characteristics of a brand and to build its foundations. 
Many authors have created these models, and their changes over time 
have not taken anything away from their original genius. 
6.1.1. Brand ladder 
We still use the ladder created by Jean-Marie Dru in the 1990s, in an 
updated version that nonetheless retains all the ingredients it had at the 
beginning. 
The ladder makes it possible to insert words on six subjects, arranged in 
the shape of ascending rungs of a ladder; the reflex, the attribute, the profit, 
the territory, the value and the role. The brand ladder is a particularly 
effective way of structuring the brand. It provides material for the 
communications made by the Brand by giving it diversity and respecting its 
coherence. 
6.1.2. Identity prism 
In 1992, another big name in the field of communications, Jean-Noël 
Kapferer, created the identity prism, a diagram we frequently present to the 
Brands we advise. 
The identity prism is a hexagon, with six sides that reflect the 
fundamentals of the personality of the brand and their projection onto the 
relationship they connect with consumers. 
6.1.3. The pyramid of qualities 
Before approaching a particularly original tool that we have adapted to 
our universe, let us mention a third particularly powerful model in the 
construction of a strong brand: The pyramid of the brand that allows us to 
choose qualities of the Brand according to three levels of gradation: 

Preparing for Conflict     121 
– the base, labeled as the “competition”, lists the qualities that allow the 
brand to flourish without its sector. If the qualities contained in this model 
disappear, the brand will stall. 
– the intermediate step must be complemented by the qualities that enable 
the Brand to assert itself and to take ownership of its differences. 
– finally, the tip of the pyramid contains the quality of the brand that will 
definitively distinguish it from others. This aspect will give the Brand a 
position as a central figure. 
 
Figure 6.1. Pyramid of qualities of the brand  
The quick description that we made here does not reflect the work that 
they require. It is often necessary to spend months “stabilizing” the contents 
of each square of each of these tools, and above all to ensure that the entire 
set, built in that way, “holds up” (“Does it hold up?” is definitely the most 
frequently asked question for us). It is long, slow work, in which questioning 
and backtracking is frequent. It is also a special time between the Brand 
leaders and people like ourselves, the Brand architects. Tensions are 
frequent, debates are impassioned and the participation that happens when 
we share a difficult adventure is an irreplaceable asset when we have to 
move on to the implementation of selected choices. 
6.2. The narrative scheme 
The famous linguist Algirdas Julien Greimas could not imagine that the 
narrative model, which he created in 1968, would one day be put to use for 
the construction of Brands. 

122     New Technologies and Branding 
We borrowed from him a few years ago and it seems that we are still the 
only ones to use this exceptionally rich tool, and we have now discovered all 
its subtleties and all its pitfalls that can throw off new users. 
In any case, for managers of Brands who make use of it with us, it has 
become an irreplaceable object for building their brand. 
We use this modeling very frequently – and for some of us, even 
systematically – to make sense of the brand by describing the mission it 
needs to pursue. It is a valuable and widely shared tool. It allows all the 
employees of a brand to move in the same direction by contributing to this 
common mission. 
The narrative diagram analyzes any real or imaginary action, including 
tales and novels, by connecting the people between them. 
The narrative diagram, illustrated in Figure 6.2, can be summed up in the 
following way: a triggering event causes a messenger to ask a hero to go on 
a mission to reach a goal for the benefit of a recipient. In his adventure, the 
hero is aided by assistants and hindered by opponents. 
The two sentences you just read are not obvious. Yet each of us is 
familiar with the narrative scheme, or rather, knows how it translates in 
concrete terms, through tales or familiar narratives. 
 
Figure 6.2. The narrative scheme  

Preparing for Conflict     123 
Let us pick one out at random and go through the sequence again. 
The princess is poisoned (triggering event). The king, her father (the 
messenger), asks a courageous knight (the hero) to leave for a faraway land 
(the mission) in order to find and bring back the potion (the goal) that will 
save the princess (the recipient). 
So, now you know you have seen the narrative scheme before. But be 
careful. This model lends itself to frequent use, and like everyone else, you 
may succumb to the temptation to “see if it applies” to the last film or the 
last novel you have read. 
It works. And it also works for brands. Here again, an example is more 
meaningful than theory. 
In 2014, the company Fly, a distributor of contemporary furniture and 
decorative objects, was taken back to court by a group of executives from 
the former team, firmly convinced that the brand could be saved by finding 
its place in the furniture market, an already very saturated and somewhat 
confusing market. 
Yes, but what place? 
When compared to giants like Ikea, But and Conforama, Fly is as small 
as, well, a fly, and only a fragile challenger of Alinéa, Maisons du Monde 
and purely online players, a player that would not pose a competitive risk for 
beautiful brands like Roche Bobois, Cinna and others from Lignes Roset. 
The restoration of the brand immediately became a priority, and the 
diagram became a weapon of choice in this vast operation. The passionate 
and largely nourished debates of the design field show that between the 
mass-produced product offerings from the major distributors and the elite 
lines of the luxury brands, not much room is left. Furthermore, in this 
polarized market, design is a concept used lavishly. The designs of the “big 
players” ignore it, while the designs of the “highbrow players” are 
unaffordable. 
However, good design has virtues that go beyond the originality of the 
“look”. Design is able to do good because it improves life through beauty, 
practicality, simplification of use, a greater access to technology and 
innovation. Design is able to do good because it represents the tangible effort 

124     New Technologies and Branding 
by a designer, who combines an insatiable dissatisfaction with empathy. 
Design is good because, when it is not imposed to the greatest number by the 
social-Democrats of the North, it allows a beautiful expression of its 
personality. 
In short, since design has a positive effect, everyone should have access 
to it. That is not the case, and it is unfair. 
This is the trigger that will push Fly, the “hero” in this narrative, to invent 
a design that is accessible to the greatest number of people. Its mission – to 
democratize quality design – is set in writing. Innovation, creativity and the 
creation of an original and often renewed offering are indispensable drivers, 
but they are not sufficient. The redesign of processes, the return to a 
professionally strong relationship with designers and manufacturers, 
logistics, price policy, the gradual relocation of production in Europe, 
customer relationships, the pedagogy of taste and communication have 
become key areas to build on in this front. 
Assistants and opponents are identified. In some cases, they are even 
selected: Fly’s competitors are thus counted as assistants, in that they 
constitute the anti-model that justifies Fly’s entire mission. It would be best 
that they do not change anything! 
It is no surprise who the end beneficiaries are: consumers, who appreciate 
the taste of a beautiful, functional and welcoming interior; and that good 
design is for sharing. 
This narrative scheme has become a guide. It leads a company to embark 
on a unique adventure, in which a mission of a societal nature is more 
attractive than its mere commercial activity. 
As we have said, it is prudent and useful to feed into the narrative scheme 
during a period of calm, because it has an important function for the 
construction and the life of the Brand. 
Mastering it can be very useful in times of conflict, as it will complement, 
even succinctly, the narrative scheme of the attacker. 
Having both allows them to be compared, and above all makes it possible 
to understand the driving forces of narrative that the detractors will try to 
write. They no longer appear simply as troublemakers, but as actors whose 

Preparing for Conflict     125 
motivations and environment can be understood. Obviously, understanding 
them is an asset for confronting them. 
We have just described four basic tools that make it possible to build a 
strong brand. 
Although they are fundamental, they are not in and of themselves 
sufficient for the Brand to be remarkable to the point of growing in a period 
of calm and to be resilient in times of trouble. 
6.3. Stabilizing opinions 
What is missing is the message. As we said, a Brand is an entity built 
around messages. This is what allows it to communicate and to establish a 
strong and lasting relationship with all its audiences. But what kind of 
message is it? What subjects does it involve? How can it be structured to be 
intelligible and interesting? How can it be coherent while the speakers of the 
brand (those whose duties require them to speak on behalf of the brand) are 
always numerous, and also have their own personality? 
How can we avoid such an awful cacophony? These issues must be taken 
seriously. 
Imagine a merchant close to you, who you recognize to have a talent of 
doing a good job producing or selecting his products, and of properly 
maintaining a beautiful, clean and nicely arranged shop, but whose message 
is fanciful, constantly changing, uneven and confusing. It is this defect that 
you will remember and, clearly, this will keep you away from his/her 
business or significantly reduce your visits. 
We have specifically created an exercise that solves this problem, which 
we call the Opinion Factory. 
Every individual who has a normal social life has the ability to “master” 
50–80 subjects, driven by his culture, education, training, relationships, 
experiences and tastes. On each of these subjects, he will have an opinion, 
convictions, a vision or a point of view. This same individual will also have 
the ability to approach these opinions differently, depending on who he is 
interacting with, whether they are friends, relatives, neighbors, co-workers, 
etc. He will know how to choose the tone, style, density, difficulty and 

126     New Technologies and Branding 
rhythm of his words, according to which one he is talking to. However, 
despite the varied nature of his involvement, this person will not change 
personality.  
This skill is nothing exceptional for an individual, but is an impressive 
challenge to be passed on to a brand. 
As with individuals, we find that the Brand must have an opinion on 50–
80 topics. The greater the number of different audiences the brand has, the 
more this figure can climb. 
These topics concern its history, its profession, and the way in which it 
approaches these elements, its ambitions, and the future it dreams of, its 
values, its visions of the world, its competitors, its teams, its partners, its 
clients, its non-clients and all the elements of society that affect its different 
audiences. 
Once this list has been made, the makers of the brand form a team to 
establish a clear, argumentative opinion on each of these topics, a strong 
point of view that may or may not be pleasing, but has the remarkable 
advantage of giving the Brand a well-established character that is always the 
condition of success. People do not like those who are seen as wobbly, 
hesitant, unthinking or flip-floppers, and that is for the best. 
The exercise is difficult. Often, debates intended to establish a solid and 
worthy point of view can be harsh. The color of consensus is gray, a very 
dull gray. Still, here consensus is mandatory and it must be bright, strong 
and dense. The (relative) suffering endured during Opinion Factory sessions 
is equal to the immense satisfaction of achieving a coherent, harmonious, 
interesting speech, etc., at the end. 
All that remains is to pass on these bases for opinions to all 
representatives of the brand. This is not the simplest step, but it is the most 
rewarding. 
The stabilization of the opinions of a brand is an exercise that, as we 
continue the process of working with various brands, seems to us to be 
increasingly inevitable. Each Brand should have its implementation at heart 
and periodically refresh its production. 

Preparing for Conflict     127 
The utility is systematic. It is increased when a conflict arises, as the 
destabilization of these episodes is mainly and systematically seen in the 
message of the Brand. 
6.4. The art of the reply 
To be complete, we must present a final tool, which may also be effective 
in peacetime and which proves to be absolutely indispensable in times of 
turbulence or conflict. 
We have called it the Reply (and certainly you will agree that we could 
not have found a simpler and more direct name). 
This tool involves identifying the greatest number of sensitive issues that 
members of an organization hear in their daily lives, outside of their official 
functions. This could be in their family, with their friends, in their social 
environment. 
Sensitive questions? 
Let me point out that these are curious questions, but also ones that are 
pernicious, polemical, pointed, destabilizing, insidious and even vicious. 
In all cases, experience shows that a clear, sincere, simple, argumentative, 
humble and level-headed answer can put down the questioning and avoid 
controversy. 
In any case, experience shows that this type of response cannot come out 
naturally if it has not been thought out beforehand. 
Thus, the questions are identified by an internal investigation or by the 
formation of a working group. 
And the answers are patiently built by an ad hoc commission, capable of 
“collecting” information. 
As a meta-demonstration: We will immediately respond to a question that 
you have not yet asked, but that you will not fail to throw in our faces if we 
were to see each other face to face: “Isn’t this just a vulgar production of 
language elements adapted from the political world for the benefit of the 

128     New Technologies and Branding 
world of large organizations? And of course, this comes with all the subtexts 
of manipulation, of political double-speak, of lies”. 
The answer: Have you ever noticed that the language elements of 
political communities do not work? They are instantly denounced by 
journalists who have a talent to spot them from a mile away and decipher 
them for those who have not bothered to do it themselves. So, no, our 
Replies are not language elements. It is out of the question for a Brand to 
take the risk of trying to rearrange reality to its advantage. It is also out of 
the question to propose that teams within an organization use deceptive 
elements of language. They would never accept them. An employee or a 
member enjoys the freedom to think that an insertion must always be put in 
parenthesis. If the brand were to stoop to that level, it would be denounced 
quickly. It would set off a conflict, which, you will remember, is the subject 
of this book. Seriously, the Replies must be clear, sincere, simple, 
argumentative, humble and serene. This is what makes this exercise slow 
and delicate. 
On March 11, 2011, the Pacific coast of Japan was hit by a terrible 
tsunami, leaving more than 18,000 people either dead or missing. Many 
people sought to leave the country immediately, naturally seeking to travel 
by air. 
French nationals seeking to buy airline tickets on the Air France Website 
encountered serious price escalations compared with other companies. 
They complained to the company through social media, but to no avail 
since the community manager was on leave. The wrath of Internet users 
grew exponentially. From this accident, a conflict arose. Air France was 
slow to react and ended up explaining, through a confusing misstatement, 
that natural disasters of this magnitude were not considered in its algorithms, 
thus adding more fuel to the burning rage of its critics. 
The algorithms in question are the ones devised for adapting prices to 
levels of demand. If demand is strong, prices will rise. The beautiful 
mechanics of Yield Management worked perfectly, except for the fact that, 
though price fluctuation does not shock anyone during normal operations, is 
seen as indecent (to put it mildly) during the circumstances of this 
catastrophe. Air France thus appeared to be profiting from a catastrophe to 
earn more money – an act that could easily be seen as monstrous. 

Preparing for Conflict     129 
Except that Air France did nothing wrong. What it can be criticized for is 
that it took no positive actions to provide assistance. No luck? Above all, no 
reactivity. Though hindsight is 20/20, it should be said that it would have 
been effective to carefully consider the anger of the clients and prepare the 
appropriate answers. 
Later, Air France reduced its fares. Its clients, who experienced this 
“indiscretion” during a moment of suffering, were able to understand after 
the fact. Some were able to forgive. But forgetting was out of the question.  
6.4.1. Managing conflict from the start 
Managing a conflict means controlling it. Conflicts arise. “They need to 
be managed”, is what we always hear, but it is not as simple as it sounds. 
Management, a well-metabolized concept in the business world, includes 
many aspects: organization, control, planning, creating projects, setting goals 
and deciding on the means that go with them, adapting them, etc. 
Alas, none of these words are appropriate for actions during a conflict, 
which is never stable or predictable in the way it plays out. This is what 
makes it an event in the brand’s existence unlike any other. 
In fact, the leaders of the Brand in conflict have another responsibility: to 
tame what some might describe as a wild beast, savage and unpredictable by 
its nature. It is a matter of never being overwhelmed by conflict. This can 
only be achieved by preparing in advance, and then during the course of the 
action trying to always do things “in due course”, without sudden gestures or 
overzealousness. 
6.4.2. Knowing the forces in play: the absolute obligation 
Today, knowledge has become a weak point that prevents conflicts from 
being controlled. Since the Second World War, the great powers have lost 
almost all their wars [CHA 16]. Why? Isn’t their technological and financial 
advantage far superior? Because they do not know their opponent. 

130     New Technologies and Branding 
6.4.3. Organize yourself 
A conflict requires a flawless level of organization, arbitration and for 
decisions to be made quickly, even if they are concerted. 
Though this does not mean anything along the lines of re-established 
quasi-military hierarchies, it is essential to appoint a single “conflict leader”. 
Ideally, this should be provided for during a period of calm, but there is still 
time when conflict arises. 
This role is certainly not a gift. The conflict leader will be the most 
exposed person, and will be exposed on two fronts: the conflict and the 
brand. He or she will have to act in the name of the brand, and therefore in 
place of its officials. 
Let us not forget about kairos, the opportune moment for action, the 
window of opportunity or, as is commonly said, the “right” time, which by 
definition implies there cannot be any other time with the same quality and 
the same opportunity. This kairos, for the brand in conflict, is a dilemma, 
given that reflection and consultation are part of good management methods 
but are sometimes incompatible with the pace of the conflict. 
Of course, responsiveness does not mean rushing. This obvious fact is 
easier to point out than to practice. 
The conflict leader’s degree of responsibility is substantial, and requires 
that he has the highest possible level of decision-making in the organization 
during the period of calm. 
These are not his only strengths. He must perfectly understand the subject 
that the critics have called into question, have good interpersonal and 
communication skills, a talent as a speaker and the composure of a diplomat. 
He must therefore be a native of the country where the conflict arises, which 
will ensure the relevance and the cultural correctness of his actions and his 
statements. 
We are talking about a single individual. You might say that having two 
or three might be more convenient, and you would not be entirely wrong. 
But having a group instead of an individual hampers ability to act, and 
groups start at two people. 

Preparing for Conflict     131 
6.4.4. You have a point of view... Say it, loud and clear 
Conflict is a real opportunity to cement the fundamentals of the brand – 
whether because they have been forgotten by those who are supposed to 
know them or simply because they are unknown or unknown to many of the 
brand’s representatives. The organization’s employees, whether they belong 
to any of these categories, should not be forgotten. 
This relaunch has the elements of a manifesto that can be deployed on 
several media outlets and in various forms (written, film, etc.). A manifesto 
is an extremely valuable tool to stabilize and make its point of view known. 
Manifestos – known for being short and punchy – have been the subject of 
particular attention for their writing, and are able to send a real message, 
both internally and externally. It is not a road map, but it is an essential 
element for stabilizing the values and differences that give the brand a clear 
mission, that it is capable of transmitting to its employees, but also to the 
whole of society.  
Its content will be the basis of the conflicting messages of the Brand and 
will clearly define the position of the Brand until more effective allies are 
mobilized, while also calming the passions of those who are not allies. 
6.4.5. Train your teams 
To be a leader, you need a team: a team dedicated to conflict. 
There are not really any rules for the size of this team. Once again, 
overreacting is not effective, and mobilizing an army to fight a small 
skirmish can have damaging consequences both outside and inside. In most 
cases, life goes on in the organization, for better or for worse, and 
involvement in conflict rarely requires many full-time employees. 
However, the digital aspect of conflicts will have consequences that 
affect all your employees. Make sure that they do not discover the conflict 
from the outside. 
Remember that a conflict is an opportunity to take a stance and to 
communicate internally, to recall the fundamentals of the brand and to 
demonstrate calmness. 

132     New Technologies and Branding 
Breaking the news of conflict, without being catastrophic, and also 
without naïvety, and without using deceptive language, helps reassure 
employees, who lose their worried apprehension in favor of considerate 
support. 
Nevertheless, it is fundamental that no one should take on the role of 
ambassador unless they are asked to. Cacophony is a disease that affects 
communities. 
6.4.6. Take charge on social networks 
Designing Websites, contributing to blogs? It is all good. For a long time, 
organizations have learned – with varying levels of success – to take charge 
of the same tools that in years gone by had been used to topple them, 
whether these be, at best, common place of at worst, outdated. 
But social networks are not destined to have that outcome. Regardless of 
their nature, from the most common to the most “professional”, they all 
share a common characteristic that brands have great difficulty in coping 
with: immediacy. 
Based on the principle of conversation, social media cannot tolerate 
anything that has no immediate spread, an indicator of its agility. An appeal 
requires an answer, an idea must have notice, a reproach calls for a reply and 
all of this must be done right away. Conversation is a requirement that 
requires permanent participation, regardless of its quality. When we say that 
the Brand is not set up for conflict and that, in addition, it has great difficulty 
in reacting in the heat of the moment, we are describing de facto a difficulty 
to settle issues calmly on social media. In periods of calm, during the steady 
flow of friendly and enthusiastic messages sent out in the brand's 
communications, the community manager’s blueprint, his or her talent for 
respecting the style and tone of the brand will be more than enough to 
accumulate likes of all kinds. But as soon as a conflict arises, it instantly 
becomes clear that it’s necessary to cross over the challenges to make 
appropriate decisions – a laudable attitude of course, but one that will delay 
participation in the “conversation”. 
Are there rules we can put in place that would allow the Brand to master 
social media? 

Preparing for Conflict     133 
There aren’t any, of course, on what needs to be said. On the other hand, 
two rules allow us to be saved from troubling situations, regardless of the 
consequences that the leaders of the Brand wish to give to the emerging 
conflict. 
The first involves “listening” to social media at all times. This monitoring 
must be entrusted to a number of monitoring professionals. Why not handle 
this task internally? First of all, because (bulky) technical solutions are 
constantly changing, and on the other hand, because the more seismographs 
you install at home, the more phantom “earthquakes” you may start feeling 
all the time. The brand does not need to entertain compulsive and paranoid 
obsessions. 
The second rule is to provide for the shifting of responsibility for 
participation in conflicts on social media, as high as possible in the 
organization and as soon as possible (see section A.3).

Acting in Conflict 
7.1. Five possible reactions to attack 
When a conflict enters its active phase, it ceases to be a state of hostility, 
the attacker is the one who takes the initiative to lead the conflict. In a sense, 
the attacker baptizes the conflict and designates the status of the participants. 
The person designates himself as an attacker, and at the same time 
designates the group under attack. It is important to note that this designation 
is objective, and does not have any bearing on our analysis of value 
judgments on who is right or wrong.  
We find that, in order for a conflict to exist, it must exist in the 
consciousness of the attackers and the groups under attack, and that it is the 
responsibility of the attacker to define the community and the group which is 
carrying out the attack and define who is being attacked (sector, leader type, 
company, etc.). 
While the group under attack, by definition, does not have the privilege 
of deciding the conflict, nor who carries out the action, it does have a series 
of options available to achieve a response. Contrary to what we may think, 
the act of responding after an action has already been taken (acting as a 
follower, we might say) is not necessarily a disadvantage, provided, of 
course, the person responding has complete control over the options 
available to him and the ability to execute them intelligently. This obviously 
requires the ability to have prepared for the conflict.  
We have identified five postures that the Brand under attack may adopt 
(if it has come under attack). These different attitudes are all legitimate in 
New Technologies and Branding, First Edition.

136     New Technologies and Branding 
their own context. It is up to the conflict leader to have specific knowledge 
about conflict in order to choose the most appropriate posture to adopt.  
7.1.1. The silent expectation 
Among all the possible actions, we should not forget that there is always 
another possible action, which is not to act. At least, not right away. While 
passivity is not a solution in itself, we believe that the complexity and the 
specific nature of each conflict means that waiting for the next move cannot 
in itself be excluded from the possible and even appropriate reactions. Of 
course, there are two risks that arise for any brand that chooses not to act. 
The first is to become complacent in the comfort of a situation where it has 
no courage to take action. Skipping out in this way can be eminently 
detrimental, because it invariably gives rise to ambivalent, unassuming 
behavior. The second risk of waiting to act involves acting too late, i.e. when 
backlash has built up, rumors have circulated and the silence of the Brand is 
interpreted as an admission of guilt. 
7.1.2. Indifference 
An attitude similar to waiting in silence, indifference stands out as a 
fundamental point: it involves the refusal to take any kind of action, on the 
grounds that the conflict in question is not worth getting involved with. 
Needless to say, the error of judgment in this matter can be absolutely fatal. 
For example, an arrogant and aloof Brand which believes that the grievances 
of consumers or the indignation of certain associations are not worth its time. 
However, this indifference deserves to be examined. On the lookout for the 
latest buzz, social networks search and seek to amplify rumors. Overreacting 
to information that does not receive much pickup also implies giving it 
legitimacy that it has been unable to obtain. In keeping with the saying that 
where there is smoke there is fire, an anticipated denial often has the 
opposite effect. The Brand also has the right to decide if it is involved in the 
conflict or not, without this being imposed on it by the audience. 
7.1.3. Negotiation  
If the claims expressed in conflict are either deemed acceptable, or the 
two parties ultimately have more to lose than to gain in engaging in conflict, 

Acting in Conflict     137 
finding a common ground is a solution to consider. This means that 
negotiations can offer a way out of conflict. 
Nevertheless, this opportunity is comparatively rare, because it drains the 
desire of the attacker to fight. The attacker has prepared and decided to enter 
into conflict, which requires a certain audacity and a serious commitment. 
Negotiation negates its attacks, stops the story that it has already begun and 
has already begun thinking out the stages, and perhaps even the outcome. 
This can be experienced as a disappointment, and it is necessary for the 
Brand to take this into account in its debates, so that a new episode of 
confrontation will not reappear in the future. 
7.1.4. Commitment  
This is the most typical kind of attitude taken once a conflict occurs. The 
attacked group responds to the attacker. The conflict is accepted, and each 
party tries to push its opposition to accept its conditions. 
7.1.5. Capitulation  
Found to have failed on an unquestionable point, the party under attack 
cannot engage in conflict without suffering even greater damage. 
Capitulation is probably the fastest way to end a conflict, and the most 
definitive, if it is accepted as an eligible end to hostilities by the attacker. 
7.2. Can we refuse to acknowledge that we are wrong? 
For objective observers, denying the facts, the irrefutable evidence for the 
benefit of one’s own certainties or beliefs is completely incoherent. 
However, all of us can list many cases of this deviation that we have 
experienced. We have experienced these situations as witnesses, and – let us 
be honest – in some cases we ourselves have been the stubborn ones. 
Any proof that contradicts a belief we hold upsets the outlook we have of 
the world. It threatens the comfortable ideas that our beliefs were able to 
prop up. It can also jeopardize an organizational structure that was stable and 
beneficial up until then. 

138     New Technologies and Branding 
The discomfort that is felt is such that it is easier to deny evidence than to 
renounce one’s beliefs. Climate deniers are a good example of this, and also 
so controversial that we may be criticized for having chosen them. 
Climate deniers are convinced that global climate change and the 
continuous string of catastrophes or life-threatening events are not 
attributable to human activity. They refute the evidence given by scientists 
who have reached a near consensus, challenging the methods used and the 
results obtained, refusing to recognize the legitimacy of their reactions 
(when they do in fact react) and finally repeat ad nauseam that science exists 
to seek the truth and not to weigh in with moral judgments. 
Their ability to persuade (rather than convince) manages to regularly 
bring in audiences who were initially hostile to their claims. 
The question that arises in the face of resistance to the facts, which can 
unquestionably be described as bad faith, is to know what phenomena allow 
belief to prevail over evidence. 
There are two phenomena that can explain this anomaly: cognitive 
dissonance [FES 56] and the rebound effect [WEG 89]. Cognitive 
dissonance describes reactions people have when one of their beliefs clashes 
with facts. These reactions come in four types: adherence, abandonment, 
justification and negation, with the last two occurring most frequently. 
Léon Festinger, who coined the term cognitive dissonance, cites the case 
of a cult waiting for the arrival of aliens. The aliens’ arrival date came and 
went, and nothing happened. But the members simply doubled down on their 
proselytism.  They did not recognize the facts, and they did not flee either. 
They tried to deny the obvious by shifting their beliefs (setting another day) 
and seeking to win over new converts. 
The rebound effect can be summed up as follows: When an individual is 
ordered to eliminate stereotypes from his speech patterns (such as racist 
remarks), that individual will then believe the stereotype even more fervently 
as soon as the ban has been lifted.  
There are two explanations for this rebound effect: like a dam, this 
prohibition builds up anger behind it, which spills out as soon as the dam 

Acting in Conflict     139 
breaks. The ban leads to a consideration, a reflection and a production of 
ideas on its subject, which is expressed as soon as the ban is lifted. 
7.3. Apologizing costs less than it pays 
For an individual, and for a Brand as well, apologizing can have both 
costs and benefits. 
It is an action that requires an undeniable mental and moral effort, since it 
is an issue of admitting guilt, recognizing a certain degree of weakness, 
failure,  fragility and having to endure a certain feeling of humiliation. 
On the other hand, the act of apologizing can be profitable (which should 
not be taken cynically). Apologies have the astonishing power to repair a 
moral injury and disarm feelings of anger. 
Physiologically, its effects can even be spectacular (decreased blood 
pressure and a stabilized heart rate)1. Emotionally, the effects of apology are 
even more remarkable: besides the sensation of being emotionally cured, the 
recipient (this term is not neutral) of the apology is encouraged to no longer 
consider the person making it as an enemy, a threat, and thus to escape from 
an impasse at the stage of confrontation. It is a liberating feeling, which in 
turn calls for compensation in the form of forgiveness and renewed empathy. 
These mechanisms, as astonishing as they are, require the person who 
makes the apology to satisfy three effective conditions, the three Rs: regret, 
responsibility and reparation2. 
The regret of having caused hurt, disappointment, etc. must be clearly 
declared, which requires the facts of an event to be recalled. Responsibility 
involves assuming the facts and therefore not shirking them by making 
excuses, giving external reasons or pointing to guilty third parties. 
Reparation also involves three orders: the compensation made in relation to 
the facts incriminated, the correction of practices or the promise and the 
commitment to no longer allow the conditions of conflict to recur. 
                            
1 Anger leads to increased blood pressure, acceleration of heart rate and respiration – it is normal 
for an apology, which soothes this anger, to have the opposite physiological effects.

These are difficult for an individual, because they evoke childish 
experiences that can feel degrading for adults. For a Brand, and for the 
organization behind it, apologizing is even more complicated. 
The reflections of Schweitzer, Wood Brooks and Galinsky [GAL 16] in 
this area are enlightening. For a Brand, the issue of potential devaluation that 
is inherent to making an apology is coupled with the legal risk of admitting 
an error, which can then become a risk that involves having to pay monetary 
damages, as well as inconvenience for the Brand (and often for its top 
managers) of having to take the place of subordinate third parties. 
However, these experts tell us, we must apologize, even if we are 
reluctant to do so, and above all without wasting time. Loss of time can be as 
costly as a lack of sincerity. 
Even worse, apologies that are clearly not sincere only serve to fan the 
flames of conflict. 
On the evening of Sunday, April 9, 2017, four members of a partner 
company arrived at the United Airlines counter in Chicago to be flown to 
Louisville. The flight was full and, in keeping with their common practices, 
the company offered to compensate four volunteers to leave the aircraft. 
Since no one responded to this request, four passengers were picked at 
random. Three of them accepted, but the fourth, a doctor who argued that his 
patients were waiting for him at his destination, refused. 
The airport police were called in, and ended up dragging the rebellious 
passenger off the aircraft. Naturally, the other passengers began filming this 
scene and later posted it online, sparking a firestorm on social media. The 
videos show the man howling, bleeding from his head, as he is dragged off 
the airplane like a bag of laundry. 
And the reactions that poured in from all over the world were just as 
violent. “United needs to be shut down! Enough with these rogue tactics! 
Boycotting that company wouldn't be nearly enough! The American 
authorities should just do their jobs. The employees and the managers of the 
company were behind it all”. “The only thing that’s left to do against 
these savages is to boycott them. Since all they care about is their pockets, 
that's where you have to hit them”. 

Acting in Conflict     141 
United Airlines CEO Oscar Munoz and his advisers did not seem to be 
aware of the gravity of the situation. In a letter to his employees, he wrote: “I 
support each and every one of you”. This generated yet another wave of 
anger. 
Videos began circulating on Twitter that featured wrestlers to show how 
ridiculous the company’s practices were. 
Forty-eight hours later, Oscar Munoz finally made a U-turn on the 
incident. “I deeply apologize to the customer forcibly removed… No one 
should ever be mistreated this way”, wrote Munoz in a message. But it was 
too late. 
Forty-eight hours is a short amount of time. But it is extremely long given 
the lightning fast nature of social media. This event would leave lasting 
scars. It was a crisis that brought to light a conflict that had been brewing 
beneath the surface, concerning and implying all airlines. 
This conflict was worsened by multiple crises that could have easily been 
avoided; the last of which also involved United Airlines. The company had 
just taken a beating in the press after it had refused to allow three teenage 
girls onto a flight because their leggings were deemed to be indecent. 
United Airlines has more than 3 billion passengers per year, which means 
that incidents like these are relatively rare. However, the level of anger they 
generate can be devastating. 
Apologies can be a valuable way to avoid a conflict. It is necessary for 
them to be spontaneous, sincere and to have a level of intensity even greater 
than the event that brought them about. 
7.4. Apologies and low points 
On the other hand, one downside to this belief that admitting an error is 
halfway to forgiveness is known by the lovely name of Cockroach theory.3 
The principle is actually inspired by cockroaches (and as you will see, the 
use of the analogy with cockroaches is not accidental here; the image of 
                            
3 http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cockroach-theory.asp. 

142     New Technologies and Branding 
cockroaches in itself connotes negativity). It is commonly assumed that, 
more often than not, when you see one cockroach, there are also plenty of 
others you do not see. Cockroaches do not usually live alone. For every one 
cockroach that can be seen, there must be hundreds of others behind it. 
Thus, in the context of public apology, the cockroach theory would have 
us believe that if an organization has been caught with its hand in the cookie 
jar, it is reasonable to assume that either there are many others who are 
negligent, dishonest or guilty, who have not yet been unmasked; or that the 
organization in question may have many other things it can be criticized 
about. 
The problem is that, instead of seeking to appease through giving 
explanations, a popular movement takes control of it and plays on the all-
too-common belief that “they're all rotten”. 
Public apologies are an essential tool for communicating conflict, but like 
all the tools, it is also necessary to master the user manual and 
contraindications. Apologies always make for emotionally charged moments 
on social networks or in the media. This emotion can boil over in the case 
that the Brand that apologizes is the undisputed leader of its sector, because 
apologies do not clear the names of other players in the market. 
7.5. The Streisand effect 
The Streisand effect is a perverse effect: when someone acts to keep a 
trivial fact hidden from everyone else, it paradoxically causes that fact to be 
perceived worthy of interest, and will lead to heightened curiosity, and for 
that fact to spread much more quickly. And naturally, the phenomenon has 
now become much more prevalent because of the Internet. 
Its name is inspired by an event that took place in 2003. 
Photographer Kenneth Adelman was taking aerial photos of the Malibu 
coast as part of a campaign to study coastal erosion. These shots, taken for 
purposes of a technical nature, were only of interest to the few people 
involved in the project. 
Some of the shots showed the lavish estate of Barbara Streisand, who 
later found out about the existence of these photos and took the photographer 

Acting in Conflict     143 
to court, demanding that the images be withdrawn. When news of this legal 
action became public, it had the effect of unleashing an emotionally charged 
response from the general public. The site that contained the photos received 
nearly 500,000 visits as of the following month. Not only did Barbara 
Streisand’s intentions have the exact opposite effect, but the singer emerged 
from this dispute with her public image warped, coming off as a wealthy 
diva who stupidly or viciously attacked a poor photographer. 
Thus, the Streisand effect is the increase in visibility that results from an 
insignificant fact that someone tries to conceal. The Streisand effect has a 
variant, in which the fact that one wishes to neutralize is already well 
known: this is called the Flanby effect, from the name of the caramel flan 
marketed by Nestlé. If you take flan out of the container holding it, the flan 
remains in the same shape. And if you do the same thing, but while strongly 
tapping on the bottom, the flan then spreads out. In the digital equivalent of 
the Flanby effect, the container represents a Website, and the flan represents 
the content of that Website. This metaphor is used to demonstrate that if 
someone tries to shut down a well-known Website that is seen as 
troublesome, the interest in the contents of that site will inevitably spread 
more rapidly. The most famous case of this is the whistle-blowing Website 
Wikileaks. 
The Wikileaks site has undergone countless attacks over its lifespan. In 
2011, the Website became the target of a financial blockade in which the 
majority of major financial institutions participated (Paypal, Visa, 
Mastercard, etc.) in 2012. Denial of service attacks attempted to neutralize 
the platform known for its revelations on major international issues.  
To survive these attacks, Julian Assange began to expand his Website. 
Rather than locating it on a server, he put out a call to mirror sites, which 
replicate the main site and allow it to be decentralized, limiting the risks of it 
becoming inaccessible.  
7.6. Are you going there? Keep zen and in control 
If a conflict is started, and the decision makers of the Brand consider that 
it is more than just a few rumblings, they have an obligation to take it on. 
This is a very fuzzy rule. What is a simple rumbling? How loud does it 
have to get before we need to be worried? 

144     New Technologies and Branding 
There is no intensity scale of conflicts that would help determine the 
measures to be taken based on the situation. 
Ideally, such a scale would look like the Beaufort scale, a scale well 
known to sailors. This scale has 13 degrees of wind speed, measured over a 
10-min period to ignore brief bursts of wind. The initial degrees are gentler 
breezes, while the latter degrees describe strong gusts of wind and storms, 
with the 13th level corresponding to hurricanes. 
This analogy is relevant for three reasons: 
– the Beaufort scale, created more than two centuries ago, is an empirical 
assessment of the situation. It could have been easily replaced by 
technology, but it is still used, because it appeals to the overall perception of 
a situation. The skill and experience of the sailors allow them to aggregate 
data in a very short time, and these decisions are not made by anemometers, 
but by men. In the same way, managing the Brand in times of conflict 
requires more intuition and sensitivity than it does technical quantifications; 
– it is essential not to react to a simple observation of a gust of wind; 
intense but brief by its very nature. The reaction would be disproportionate, 
as would the consequences of that reaction. Ten minutes is a long time when 
you are threatened by a grave danger. But 10 min is also short, because it is 
important not to waste time. This analogy applies to a Brand in conflict: 
taking the time to make an objective and stabilized measurement of the 
situation is as crucial as not waiting too long to react; 
– the third lesson that this nautical analogy offers us is to meditate on 
how critical it is for sailors to remain calm. Sea captains never remain 
indifferent when they notice the wind rising and the sea becoming more 
threatening, but the best captains stand out due to their calmness, their ability 
to remain zen-like and make decisions without haste and without delay. 
Of course, the Brand is usually a beautifully designed ship designed to 
sail on calm seas. It is not designed for a storm. Nevertheless, the conditions 
have changed and now gusts of wind are possible. Their frequency and 
intensity may even increase. Preparing the boat and training the crew are no 
longer options. 

Acting in Conflict     145 
7.7. Keep a conflict journal 
Conflict is hostility that becomes active. This wavering is always the 
beginning of a complex story, forming the basis of unique sagas that could in 
many cases have been pulled straight from a novel. 
To record every fact, every exchange, every decision or orientation, to 
narrate all stages of conflict, to seize the emotions associated with them, is 
far from being childish. 
Nevertheless, we have seen many who hold this view. When we invite 
them to keep a diary of the conflict, this always elicits the same reactions: 
eye rolls, puckered frowns, and dubious pouts. Would not that just be waste 
of time, in situations where time is more precious than ever? 
Writing down the details of conflict offers at least six different positive 
traits that justify spending some time on it: 
– the first consideration is to inform all participants in the organization in 
real time. It should never be forgotten that a Brand that has become involved 
in conflict will attract all those who seek to discover, understand and retell 
the current conflict, its origins and its developments. Among these are 
journalists, who need as many sources as possible, not only in order to 
counteract contradictory and conflicting sources, but to deal with weak 
material, which will ensure their credibility; 
– events of varying importance within a conflict often clash with one 
another. The most natural tendency is to take into account the elements that 
draw the most attention to themselves, which are not necessarily the most 
important. However, it is essential to go back to the full sequence of events 
that have occurred up to this point. This makes it possible to view the events 
from a distance, and then to allow for the good ideas that have been put 
together overnight and quickly obscured in the heat of the moment, or 
occurrences in the past that have gone unnoticed, but which can change the 
course of conflict; 
– in a conflict, just as in any disturbed situation, it is said that “the devil is 
in the detail”. Recording “everything” is a proven method and used in police 
investigations. The famous books of the best sleuths are not mere gimmicky 
detective novels; 

146     New Technologies and Branding 
– the many different parties on the side of the Brand do not experience 
conflict in the same way. Those who are in the middle of conflict do not 
have the same outlook as those who are following it from the company’s 
headquarters. A new twist in conflict might be seen by those in the middle of 
it as catastrophic, while those further out may consider it as secondary. A 
conflict journal acts as a timer, a commonly shared stabilizing mechanism. 
Comparing viewpoints, and the different ways of experiencing conflict by 
each of the parties results in an outcome closer to one that a dispassionate 
observer might experience; it is more lucid and allows them to act with more 
composure; 
– during the stages of a public confrontation (for example a televised 
debate). Being able to precisely recreate the details of past events is always 
impressive, and makes it possible to score points. However, be careful to 
avoid falling into the trap of approaching it like an overly attentive student, 
whose obsession with finding the best verbiage is particularly 
counterproductive. Argumentation and explanation often do not carry 
sufficient emotional weight; 
– finally, the written narrative of conflict is a vivid memory that will 
inform, nourish and inspire the successors of those who have lived through 
it. A Brand (normally) lives longer than those who work with it. What is 
more, the conflict can also live a long time without calling attention to itself, 
like bacteria that forms cysts and can regain its strength when it passes on to 
a new crisis or a new scandal. 
Though the interest in keeping the conflict diary can be understood in this 
sense, the way to go about it is not obvious and is not unique. 
Confiding in a trustworthy person is often the first idea that comes to 
mind, but it is not necessarily the right one in an organization where there 
are many places of conflict. For instance, the editor of a newspaper is 
obliged to carry out serious reporting work with all persons concerned, 
which is difficult to achieve within the time limits, and allows the risk of 
interpretation or subjectivity. 
Using an intranet is by far preferable if it is possible to restrict access to 
the few essential players and protect the content. It is then necessary to 
quickly train each contributor on the critical necessity of updating it in real 
time. 

Acting in Conflict     147 
Proof is usually taken quickly, and the conflict log becomes an 
indispensable tool whose effectiveness justifies the effort of carefully 
implementing it.  
7.8. Orchestrate engagement techniques 
Engaging in conflict means choosing and measuring the different forms 
of possible responses. There is no specific recipe, because by its nature, a 
conflict is not based on any rules. Nevertheless, it is interesting to review the 
different acceptable approaches that a Brand can take. 
Acceptable? 
We have chosen not to cite actions that could be carried out to 
manipulate, or cause violence or malice. These go against the ethics of our 
approach, and this is quite appropriate, because the Brand – which, by nature 
is an admirable entity (since it seeks to be admired) and a public entity with 
great exposure – would sooner or later be forced to resort to thuggish tactics. 
The exercise is not simple. And even after strictly forbidding the use of 
reprehensible tactics, the reader will understand that we must avoid these 
things we fear. It is up to each of us to measure the inherent risks of the 
actions that we choose to take, to control or appease conflict by always 
keeping in mind that it is always possible for the public to take a turn toward 
retribution. 
7.8.1. Public debate 
The purpose of conflict has two sides. The things that the Brand 
promises, promotes, describes or carries out within the logic of its activity 
will be denounced by its detractors as infamous, abnormal, amoral, immoral, 
dishonest, malicious, etc. Conflict involves having a dual vision of the same 
reality. 
The Brand is justified in defending its point of view and its convictions, 
and the simplest way it can do that is through public debate. Debate – a 
method that is simple, yet rarely decisive – has almost no chance of getting 
its critics to agree that their attack is an act of bad judgment. However, it is a 

148     New Technologies and Branding 
great opportunity to put forward the convictions of everyone involved, and 
also to measure the strength and the level of commitment of both parties. 
The debate must be carefully prepared. It requires training, with 
repetitions in which the argument is as important as giving answers to 
objections. Similarly, it is during the process of this preparation that a 
balance is reached between the rational portion of the message and the more 
emotional part, where the latter of the two – which we will return to – is 
often more effective than the former. 
7.8.2. One-upmanship – the fatal embrace 
One-upmanship is theoretically an effective approach, since it not only 
speaks to the detractors’ claims, but it exceeds their requirements. That is 
why we have given it the pleasant-sounding name of the “fatal embrace”. 
Keep in mind that this refers to the fatal embrace of the conflict, and not the 
attackers. 
It also carries significant risks along similar lines: the overcommunica-
tion of the claims that have been made, the overinterpretation of reality, 
overmediation and an excess of requests made to the Brand’s audiences. 
To illustrate these pros and cons, the approach taken by Apple to environ-
mental commitment is a particularly exemplary textbook case. 
Greenpeace regularly publishes reports and rankings on the origin of the 
energy used by the tech sector. Web giants, champions of the virtual world 
and digitization, are, in reality, companies with a real impact on the 
environment. Until 2012, Apple (among with all the other players) was 
regularly singled out for its lack of interest in the environment. Its immense 
data centers were largely powered by fossil fuels.  
This conflict between economic interests and the defense of nature could 
have continued for a long time. But in 2012, Apple made a 180° turn on 
these issues and decided to put its environmental commitments front and 
center. Far from greenwashing, the platform was deployed on two fronts: a 
change in infrastructure, to reach almost 90% of renewable energy, and a 
very active communication strategy to publicize these changes.  

Acting in Conflict     149 
Rather than standing firm on its positions, Apple took the decision of 
making Greenpeace an ally. By trusting the ranking of the most virtuous 
companies on these issues, Apple communicates its values and its 
commitment, but also benefits greatly from the media expertise and the 
visibility of Greenpeace. In return, the association sees an advantage in 
showing that its audits have not been done in vain, because they have raised 
awareness of a major player on the web, and that real changes have taken 
place.  
7.8.3. Exhaustion 
Detractors can look impressive from the outside, while being lighter 
below the surface. This configuration leads to a response: making requests to 
them, inviting them to exchange, asking them to further develop the 
advanced arguments, participating in contradictory debates, meeting experts 
and interviewing them are all requests that can greatly calm people’s 
emotions without aggression. 
7.8.4. Make jokes, not war 
Let us not forget that in this case we are dealing with techniques or 
methods that the Brand can use to respond to the actions taken by its 
detractors. That is why we consider humor as a reaction and not as a primary 
initiative. A Brand’s humor is a subject as vast as it is unexplored, which we 
will not be able to go into great detail here (which is a pity). 
In the context that interests us, humor is an ambiguity. On the one hand, 
its cathartic power is immense. Humor is recognized as a means of avoiding 
confrontation, appeasing conflicts and lowering tensions. 
On the other hand, it is a formidable weapon that can damage or even 
ruin credibility and legitimacy in a very short time, and in conflicts, the 
attackers use this destructive power. Is it necessary to respond in the same 
manner? Yes, if several conditions are respected. 
The first is that the subject of conflict does not make the humorous reply 
of the brand inappropriate. Bad taste is not an exact science, and anticipating  
the reactions of the public is almost impossible. It is essential to consider 
that in a conflict, the attacker often plays the role of a vigilante, a vulnerable, 

150     New Technologies and Branding 
courageous and sympathetic figure willing to sound the alarm. The brand is 
an entity that is perceived as powerful, and therefore potentially arrogant, 
disdainful and haughty. If the first of these two has a sense of humor, it will 
be more appreciated than if the second one does. 
The second condition is to have an excellent mental and intellectual 
condition to confront the potential jousting that may occur in the first reply. 
Humor requires the same level of preparation as that of a high-level athlete. 
Certainly, replying with humor is a good way to disarm certain tendencies. 
Or, conversely, it can trigger an escalation that has very little chance of 
ending with a “victory” for the Brand. 
The third condition is to be sufficiently organized, involving intense 
preparation, to follow the rhythm of the back-and-forth of humorous 
exchanges. These rapid fire exchanges are a game of skill (and a game of 
power) between individuals, but can become an ordeal for the Brand that, as 
we have explained above, is hardly known for its ability to react quickly. 
In short, addressing certain stages of a conflict with humor is an art that 
leaves little room for amateurism. 
We believe that it should be entrusted to two principal areas within the 
company: 
– the leader who can present himself to the public and take responsibility 
for the humor he brings to his brand; 
– the community manager or the customer service employees are also in a 
good position for this, because their spontaneity, their humility and their 
potential disinterest puts them at the same level of perceived simplicity and 
purity as the detractors. 
A worm in a Sainsbury’s Salad 
In September 2016, Leila Daly discovered a worm in her packaged salad. Her first 
reaction: complain on social media. It would seem logical that all the ingredients were in 
place to create a negative buzz. And stifling the case, denying it, or making threats would 
only amplify it and give it a phenomenal level of pickup. As the news spread through 
social media, it was the Community Manager of the Brand that handled the case. 
 
 
 

Acting in Conflict     151 
Leila humorously wrote:  
“Today, starving, I entered my kitchen to make my lunch. Upon opening this fine lettuce, I 
noticed someone had already began eating it. Who, may you ask? Well it was this little worm”.  
And in response, the community manager of the label said:  
“Hi Leila, what a terrible situation. That poor worm, munching away on some lettuce 
Now he’s playing the starring role in a horror story.  I hope you’ve been able to calm the 
children selling them the clear benefits of the situation. I mean, worms are easy pets to 
keep, I assume? Although, a 12 stone weight gain from a burger, that’s quite the 
achievement. Not at all your standard burger, it sounds amazing. Was it one of ours, as I’d 
like to try it? Judging by your picture, you make a mean salad, perhaps salads could be an 
alternative option to your new career move? Of course, it’s clear we should hang our 
heads, and worms certainly don’t belong in lettuce, but as an alternative to closing down 
and issuing P45s, how about we sort a refund, with maybe a little extra to help feed your 
new friend and treat yourself to something nice on us? Drop us a PM, we can discuss”.

Twitter: https://twitter.com/MetroUK | Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/MetroUK/ 
The answer here was spot on, since the community manager was able to treat the list of 
grievances with seriousness, skill and a perfect dose of humor. 
Over a few exchanges, the amazed web users were able to live out the adventures of 
the Daly family, devastated by this discovery (“As you can imagine, I was horrified. My 
children started crying, my cats headbutting the wall in shock, my husband divorced me, 
it was complete madness”) and the adventures of the worm, affectionately nicknamed 
Jackie Chan and apparently a big fan of the TV series. 
At the end of this exchange, the brand won a special place in the hearts of its customers and 
demonstrated that it assumed its responsibilities and knew how to show a sense of humor. The 
calm, collected attitude throughout the incident obviously played a role. Of course, humor is 
not an approach that can be applied indiscriminately during all sensitive situations. 
But it is a powerful position that makes it possible to defuse a potential conflict that can 
easily arise from a poorly managed crisis. 
 
 
 

152     New Technologies and Branding 
What we need to remember from this emblematic case is that today conflicts primarily 
occur through social media, and that it is therefore essential to train the brand’s 
community manager to spontaneously respond to the conflicts that arise, train them in 
humor, and finally, give them a bit of leeway (which implies being able to place a 
considerable amount of trust in them) so that they can take actions quickly (in this case, 
sending two letters, of which one was directed to the earthworm that was also affected by 
this mishap). 
 
The Big Brother awards or the antiprice trap 
In the arsenal of the detractors, the prize/antiprize is a must. Although it is collective, this 
parody of a false compensation has become commonplace, and individually damages the 
Brands that pay the price for it. Its touch of humor and ability to accuse effectively ensure its 
success. 
The phenomenon of the antiprize, or false accusations, is a setup intended to divert the 
codes of Brands and companies that display their good behavior or their pride by prizes and 
rewards (best customer service of the year, brand of the year, best place to work, etc.).  
Having a debate after being awarded an antiprize is tricky, as it is easy for detractors to 
engage in one-upmanship. Providing information and the avoidance of a new appointment 
are two possible routes to take.  
The Big Brother awards, which take their name from the famous authoritarian from 
Oceania in the equally famous George Orwell novel, 1984, are a ceremony that rewards 
governments and companies that stand out for their ability to threaten their citizens’ privacy. 
The Big Brother awards exist in 10 countries. For instance, in 2013 in France, Conforama, 
Ikea, Castorama and Elior were all tied for the award with a special mention for “employee 
policing”. 
Based on the principle of “name and shame”, the Big Brother awards were created by 
the NGO, Privacy International. In parallel, there is also a less ironic willingness to 
recognize the work of activists and associations who work to defend individual freedoms 
and monitor abuse. One example is the prix Voltaire de la vigilance (Voltaire Prize of 
vigilance).  
7.9. Tell a story that is stronger and more appealing than the 
attacker 
Whether you want it to be or not, the conflict you are engaged in will 
become a story. The story can perhaps even be the cause of this conflict. 
Indeed, conflict, antagonism and the confrontation of good and evil are the 
very building blocks of a story. Nothing progresses in history unless it is 
done through conflict.  

Acting in Conflict     153 
While conflict always creates a story, you need pick up the pen and write 
that story yourself, instead of suffering by allowing your adversary to do it 
for you. Indeed, through the phenomena of abstraction, analogy and the 
ferocious appetite that we all have to hear stories, a confrontational process 
naturally becomes a story.  
To describe the conduct of a conflict means building the framework of a 
story that is able to speak to all of mankind. The big question is: Which side 
are you going to find yourself on in the great divide between the good guys 
and the bad guys? The values of a story are the universal qualities of a 
human experience that can change from positive to negative. It is therefore 
absolutely essential not to let your opponent be the only one to hold the pen. 
If you allow yourself to be represented by your opponent, you have already 
been defeated.  
If you let yourself be cast in the role of the bad guy, even your most 
eloquent denials will not make you the hero of the story. At best you will be 
the not-so-bad bad guy. That is why you have to offer a competition and 
make sure that your story has a stronger following than that of your 
opponent. Brands, like the characters of a story, are not human beings. These 
are metaphors of human nature. We are the ones who establish a connection 
with them, as if they were real. Brands and characters are anthropomimetic. 
7.10. Tweak and revise your actantial model  
The actantial model, referred to above, is a model linking the actors, roles 
and relationships that allow a narrative to be told. This construction is 
particularly efficient for the Brand, because it helps to stabilize key points in 
its existence, its sense of self, its expertise, and the mission of the Brand. It 
also allows us to share with all those who participate that the adventure is a 
treasure trove of coherence, harmony and motivation. 
When the brand is confronted with a conflict, the model reaffirms the 
fundamentals of the brand and mobilizes all those who serve and support it. 
In short, let us say clearly, all Brands should have a narrative model, 
carefully thought out and widely shared. 

154     New Technologies and Branding 
The Brand can therefore rely on this model to write the epic tale that 
justifies its existence, gives it a solid legitimacy and brings it the credibility 
that will ensure its success. That, and nothing less. 
7.11. Imagine the actantial model of the attacker 
If you have built an actantial model for your Brand, you have acquired a 
certain level of agility that should allow you to imagine the said model of the 
attacker. Use it at all times.  
However, the attacker is rarely a brand. It can be embodied by a single 
person or an established group (an association, a collective and a political 
party) or even an informal and opportunistic community. 
The reason that justifies constructing the actantial model of the attacker is 
being able to compare it with the one used by the Brand. There is a 
triggering event, the one that specifically mobilizes the attacker against the 
Brand and that is the reason for the attack. 
The recipient is often to be looked for in society or rather in its 
aspirations: a thirst for justice, ethics, respect, fairness and combativeness 
against the major causes of all kinds (political, ecological, etc.). 
The hero is the attacker, who must be evaluated. This hero has opponents 
and auxiliaries, whether they are real actors who will intervene in conflict or 
essential conditions that can interfere in the nature, magnitude or dynamics 
of conflict. Indifference or ignorance, for example, is often to be expected in 
opponents of the hero. 
The occurrence of other more important conflicts involving the public 
passion can be expected as well. A nation-wide drama can cover up a local 
scandal, or a scandal perceived by the public or the media as secondary, 
when it would have had more than enough chances of making front pages. 
The attacker’s mission and the goal he wants to achieve are essential and 
must be carefully specified. Considering the goal that the attacker wishes to 
achieve, means measuring his progression toward this goal and assessing the 
resentment of the attacker that the reactions of the Brand can arouse. 

Acting in Conflict     155 
An important point to assess over the course of the conflict is the 
potential energy of the attacker, who will tend to increase their initiatives as 
they approaches his goal. 
Finally, the recipient who will reap the benefit from the hero saga must 
also be subjected to a real reflection made with hindsight and detachment, 
which is never clear in the destabilizing context of the conflict. 
This curious narrative scheme, based partly on theory, is a resource to be 
shared with all the players of the brand that will be involved in the 
management of conflict. 
7.12. Adopt your assertiveness, even by forcing yourself a little 
The Brand is heroic, the Brand is a social reference point, the Brand must 
act on its own to become strong and the Brand in conflict only escapes if it 
does not make any faux pas. 
Of course, the Brand is a construction that is akin to humanized 
representation, but it must be admitted that it has a number of qualities that 
mere mortals struggle to achieve. 
Given the level of demand imposed on Brands, there’s little doubt that 
one of these qualities is assertiveness.  
The American Psychologist Andrew Salter is considered the creator of 
training techniques in assertiveness. Although he did not himself name his 
method himself, he described the main principles in his famous book, 
Conditioned Reflex Therapy, which he wrote in 1949. His teachings have 
been reproduced to this day. Assertiveness is a great topic in transactional 
analysis and continues to be an essential part of management and recruitment 
techniques. 
But what does this concept of assertiveness involve? Assertiveness is the 
ability of the individual to assert their positions by respecting others in a 
situation of potential or real hostility. Another way of putting it is not letting 
go, but instead remaining courteous and empathetic. 

156     New Technologies and Branding 
In conflicts, this attitude is valuable, because it leads to calming 
behaviors. This is easy to say, but much more difficult to implement for an 
individual who does not necessarily have the necessary level of composure. 
In the case of the Brand whose personality is in the hands of those who 
manage it, it is interesting to take the time to prop up assertive reactions. To 
understand them, we consider the situations in which they do not come into 
play. 
We will work on an adaptation, shown in Figure 7.1, of a well-known 
scheme that becomes clear from the first investigations you can do on 
assertiveness. 
 
Figure 7.1. Matrix of reactions to hostility  
The upper left quadrant describes haughty, contemptuous behaviors. “I 
am proud of my actions and my points of view, I take ownership of them and 
want to defend them, but I have no consideration for those who want to 
contradict me”. 
Moving diagonally, on the other side we find indecisiveness, a fear that 
leads to silence, and often to carnage. “I do not take ownership of my actions 
and opinions, and I do not defend myself”. 

Acting in Conflict     157 
Opposite to that, in the lower quadrant, is a glut of detractors. “I do not 
defend myself, and I despise those who bring me to anger”. The related 
behaviors are mixtures of aggression and avoidance. Imagine for a moment 
the hateful character of someone who behaves like this. 
As soon as you make an effort to avoid these deleterious reactions, you 
end up in assertiveness, and several recipes appear on this menu. 
One of them is the unfairly named “fogging” that some would be tempted 
to confuse with smoking. In reality, it involves finding a subject, a single 
subject in all those who feed into the context of a conflict, on which it is 
possible to agree with the attacker, or that could even give rise to a positive, 
non-sterile debate. As soon as this first area is highlighted, it is possible to 
weave many different partial debates of the same nature around it. 
Another recipe, more delicate if not outright dangerous, is the “broken 
record”. No need to spell this one out. It involves repeating your defense or 
your point of view, without becoming bored, calmly and with a smile, 
hoping that your opponent will eventually be won over by resignation and 
that the audience following the conflict will soak up your theory until they 
consider it to be the just and legitimate position to hold. 
In all honesty, the risk here is to become annoying, which is never a good 
position in a conflict.  
At the end of this book, we will present a technique that we find 
preferable and which is a free adaptation of Greimas’ semiotic square. 
Regardless of the technique that is used, assertiveness is obviously 
preferable to other behaviors that have been described. 
However, maintaining it over the course of conflict cannot be taken for 
granted, and that is why an initial stage of preparation is necessary in order 
to consider assertiveness as a course which should not be deviated from, and 
which all players of conflict on the side of the Brand must guarantee. 
7.13. Conflict is a theater of improvisation 
Del Close, one of the main theorists of theatrical improvisation, sums up 
his teachings in a few principles that he gathers and puts forward: we must 
accompany and support all the actors, never enter on stage if we have 

158     New Technologies and Branding 
nothing to bring to it, and finally, never underestimate our audience. These 
principles of improvisation are perfectly transferable to the position of a 
Brand that is plunged into a full-scale conflict. 
Indeed, to leave a place for internal dissension, or to want to grab the 
spotlight at all costs, at the expense of working with the team, is to condemn 
ourselves to failure. On the contrary, it is vital to work in close collaboration 
with our teams. In the same way, taking the stage late, and especially having 
nothing to say, is an insult to the audience. 
But in the context of a conflict, alienating public opinion is obviously an 
enormous mistake. To avoid making that mistake, it is essential to at least 
have respect for the action that is taking place, if not for the opponent as 
well, and only to intervene by having something interesting to bring to the 
play that is being acted out. Adding to the noise of the media just for the 
pleasure of occupying space is a risk. Finally, the Brand is a participant in 
society. Its message matters, and not just to sell more goods. The best way to 
maintain the legitimacy of its message is also to respect the audience by 
presenting the situation without trying to hide. 
7.14. Prepare to be spontaneous 
The art of improvisation is not used solely in theatrical exercises, and it is 
an excellent means of communication. To integrate this skill into your 
methods for managing conflict, it is sufficient (albeit with a lot of training, 
which we will return to) to adopt the right posture. This can be summed up 
as follows: accept, listen and act. 
Improvisation is an art of the moment; moving, always changing, which 
creates an incredible richness of situations. It is your duty not to refuse to 
take the stage, and instead to see this occasion as an invitation. The stage is 
not a neutral space, and it is essential to understand that an improviser does 
not have the right to forget the game being played by others and the 
reactions of the public that may benefit his own game. It is good to keep in 
mind at all times that we are not acting just for ourselves, nor really for the 
other actors on stage, but much more – really almost entirely – for the 
public. It is also good to always keep in mind that the audience is made up of 
several different audiences. During conflicts, we have classified them: 
audience, arbitrators, allies and finally a group that we are all eager to place 

Acting in Conflict     159 
into other categories, the amplifiers of conflict (journalists, influential 
internet users and “opinion leaders”). 
Improvising is a physical commitment at every moment, which rests on 
the ability to listen to absolutely everything in order to bounce back fast. It is 
not an innate talent. Paradoxically, it is the product of long periods of work. 
Knowing how to improvise comes from intense preparation. Indeed, when 
the Brand is well equipped to handle it, the words come naturally. 
The Brand’s character, its verbiage, its style, its personality and its values 
are built on the stage in the interactions they create with all the main 
characters in conflict (see the diagram of the 5 As). To achieve this result, it 
is necessary to grasp that improvisational theater is not a tragedy that plays 
out mechanically. The preparation required for improvisation has nothing to 
do with learning a script. In the improvisation exercises, it is not that 
preparation allows you to do away with reflexes; instead, it allows you to be 
spontaneous. 
Improvisation is a requirement, a requirement not to plan, but to take hold 
of the vast number of different situations. It is also the requirement to dive in 
media res into the heart of the melee. Nothing is more tiring for the audience 
than a long tirade of exposition, setting up a situation that the audience 
thinks it knows.  Forget these endless reminders about company values, the 
quality of your products and the desire to offer a unique experience. The 
public is also a consumer, spoon fed from childhood with promises that do 
not engage them and with advertising hyperbole. So, you are virtuous, 
indignant, engaged – do not just say it. Show it. Think about an action 
movie. Would you ever see a 10-min prologue to introduce you to James 
Bond? No way. An explosion, a chase, a tuxedo. Not one word is spoken, 
and yet, you know everything. 
Improvisation implies accepting risk. But a much lower risk than playing 
an obsolete partition with mechanical rigor. Improvisation is a strategy that 
pays off, because it is an open strategy, based on the ability to come up with 
creative solutions, in an environment where a lack of information is a 
constant feature. Knowing how to evolve in a constantly shifting and 
uncertain environment is a rare quality today. 
Mastering moments of silence is a golden rule in improvisational theater. 
There is no use in saying the wrong words, or speaking over everyone else. 

160     New Technologies and Branding 
Entering conflict by accepting the invitation to go on stage is not an 
invitation to ramble on and on. Nothing is more annoying than a long 
monologue of justifications to introduce the Brand, seeking to gain pity from 
the public and constantly coming back to the same cliches.  
Today, consumers have broken away from advertising practices, and 
expect their brands not to give them words, but actions. To agree to act on 
stage also means to embody a story through your posture, your legitimacy, 
your way of acting.  
The art of improvisation is a delicate art. In fact, since the script and the 
dialogue are constantly being written in front of the eyes of the audience, it 
is not possible to fall back on the comfort of having a text in advance that 
you can easily fall back on. Every sentence, every intonation builds a scene, 
a moment. For the audience to remain in suspense, you must capture it, 
rationally and emotionally. But even the smallest distraction can grab its 
attention. 
7.15. Attention to detail  
In this sense, a misleading detail, one that sounds wrong, that breaks with 
the many elements forming the character of the Brand, can make the 
audience turn its back. Improvisation implies constant attention to all 
aspects. The audience is fond of conflicts and the more spectators there are 
and the closer the development gets to reaching a climax, the more attention 
to detail begins to heighten. But only one detail that is out of place can throw 
everything off. Remember the Greek demi-god, Kairos, who is entirely 
devoted to opportunity. This unstable moment where victory, like defeat, 
wavers like a coin that has fallen on its edge.  
Because a conflict is an improvisational theater, you cannot stick to any 
well-oiled machinery. But it also means that you are not mired in an 
inevitable defeat that unfolds like a tragedy. If you are convinced of this, you 
have succumbed to the narrative pattern of your opponent, and you have 
undoubtedly accepted this role of the villain. Go back and put the narrative 
diagram of your opponent into writing, then take the time to tell a more 
convincing story.  
Now it is time to tell that story. To tell it means to bring it to life, to give 
it a richness, to embody it. And the details are what make the stories come 

Acting in Conflict     161 
alive. By using the right detail, you can give a decisive inflection to this 
conflict. Just think of how many presidential campaigns were won with just 
a little phrase. Incredible, isn't it? A campaign is like a marathon, where 
there are teams that work in shifts, around the clock. It is also an escalation 
that is reminiscent of the mimetic conflict theorized by R. Girard. Meetings 
are met with more meetings, posters with more posters, details passed on to 
newscasters with more details passed on to newscasters. All told, it is the 
details that make all the difference.  
 In his memoirs, Valery Giscard d'Estaing recalled an historic political 
episode, writing: I believe that I was elected President of the Republic, 
thanks to a ten-word phrase: “Mr. Mitterrand, you don't have the monopoly 
on our hearts!” [GIS 88]. 
If two opponents seem to be equal in how they manage their 
communication, and the financial means they have to spread their opinions, 
you should then be attentive to the details, they will make all the difference, 
in one way or another.  
Greenpeace and the fruit bombs 
Killer details really can kill. In a group, imagine all the possible outcomes of the actions 
you engage in. One story that Greenpeace will remember for a long time is a wonderful 
illustration of this extensive – but often very useful – precaution. 
On June 26, 2016, Greenpeace sent out fruit juices decorated with a skull-and-
crossbones icon to various editors with the indication not to consume it. This was a strong 
message about a pesticide campaign being used on certain fruits grown on large plots of land 
(in this case, the campaign targeted the brand E. Leclerc). From a logical standpoint, 
everything would seem to indicate this is a perfectly well-oiled media campaign, as 
Greenpeace is known to organize. A strong message, brought forward by an original action, 
while aiming specifically at the media. 
But the events that followed took a completely different turn. There was one detail that 
was not taken into account, and the usually clockwork mechanics of the group ended up 
brutally derailing, standing out from the background. As it happened, the fruit juices were 
sent to the editors on a Friday and arrived after the journalists left for the weekend. 
Painstakingly placed on their desks, the fruit juices waited for their recipients over the 
weekend. A non-pasteurized fruit juice left to sit out waiting has the annoying habit of 
fermenting. On Monday morning, the journalists came to find an unpleasant surprise: the 
bottles had exploded, spreading their rotting contents onto the journalists’ files and computer 
keyboards. Needless to say, the potential for these journalists to react positively to this stunt 
was completely ruined. 

162     New Technologies and Branding 
One little detail (in this case, fermentation) completely reversed the pickup the campaign 
would have wanted, and flipped journalist opinion. The campaign did receive media 
coverage, but it was all focused on this particular operation, not the root issue it sought to 
address. 
The brand that was targeted then knew that it was not going to lose any sleep over this 
issue, after having felt the whiff of a shot passing by them a bit too closely. Nevertheless, 
there was a second detail that nearly put E. Leclerc back in the spotlight, and in a very bad 
situation. 
As it happened, the ecologist organization had coupled its media operation with other 
operations in front of stores with activists. But store employees do not always know how to 
react to extraordinary actions such as hostile mobilizations. Thus, one of the employees cut 
one of the ropes that was used by an activist to hoist himself up, sending him into free fall. 
This attention-grabbing scene had no consequences to the person involved. In the blink of an 
eye, an uncontrolled action could have taken a dramatic turn for E. Leclerc, which would 
have found itself at the heart of a drama that could revive the controversy of pesticides in a 
curious way.  
7.16. Seven tips and tricks to improvise without fear 
1) We do not act in front of an audience, we act for it. It is essential to 
respect the audience. Getting on stage, taking the floor to occupy space in 
the media without having anything relevant to say is at worst insulting, and 
at best tiresome. 
2) Theatrical improvisation is a game, not an act of suffering. Seize on 
opportunities and make your point of view heard. Show the world your 
brand, its tone, its universe, without too much chatting. 
3) The game is an improvisation, but the knowledge and mastery of the 
characters (actors) must not be one. 
4) Moments of silence with moments of punctuation are pleasing for the 
public, and decisive for the actor who is preparing his next move. 
5) The audience applauds the intelligence of rejoinders, and even more so 
their emotional charge. 
6) The goal is never to damage the opponent, but to cause him to damage 
himself. 
7) A game of conflict is paradoxically, and thankfully, incompatible with 
wickedness and petty vanity. 

Acting in Conflict     163 
7.17. The semiotic square: judo instead of boxing 
A frontal attack against a detractor paralyzes dialogue and destroys any 
hope for exchanges that might lower the tension of the conflict. 
In the heat of the moment, this strategy may be the most tempting or 
spontaneous option, but it inevitably leads to a dialogue that falls on deaf 
ears. 
One person says: “It's white”, and the other says: “No, it's black”. The 
first one then retorts: “No, it’s white”, and so on. The sterility of such a 
dialogue has three disastrous consequences: it gives the advantage to the 
initiator of the exchange, which only offers an initial opinion, discrediting 
the childish reply and scaring away the audience, quickly becoming weary of 
such a hollow exchange. 
We have already brought in the narrative scheme to be used according to 
Greimas. Now we are renewing the operation to present the model's famous 
Semiotic square. So that purists will not be offended, we will not explore all 
the great resources of this model, but we shall nevertheless make an honest 
use of it. 
The semiotic square places opposing or complementary proposals at the 
four corners of the square, which can provide a narrative structure and 
facilitate the analysis of visual or textual structures. 
In the example above, the two proposals at the top (“you are right”/“you 
are wrong”) contradict each other. The two proposals at the bottom do as 
well. 
Vertically, the proposals are complementary (which does not mean they 
are similar). The diagonals show a contradictory relationship between two 
diametrically opposed proposals. 

164     New Technologies and Branding 
 
Figure 7.2. The semiotic square  
Why is this semiotic square so useful for building a replica in a conflict? 
This is because it helps to avoid a head-on opposition by making a habit 
out of getting around it. There is always another path, one that is longer, 
more diplomatic, more relaxed and with richer teachings as well. It is also 
more difficult, in that it requires patience, consistency and leniency, in 
situations where these qualities can require prowess. 
What is the best way to follow the long paths of the semiotic square? 
Let us say your detractor is attacking you. The only angle of the semiotic 
square that you would spontaneously want to follow is at the top right: “You 
are wrong”, the first step toward a dialogue falling on deaf ears. 
You obviously do not want to take the opposite angle of “you're right” 
either. However, that is the one that might help you get off the hook. 
Put yourself in the place of your detractor. In the context perceived by 
him, following his own logic, he is right. If you were in his place, maybe you 
would act like him. Find the strength to tell him. It is not that hard, because 
the next step will prevent you from having the impression of turning the 
other cheek:  
“From your point of view, you are right, or rather, you are not 
wrong”.  
 

Acting in Conflict     165 
Being complementary works. Nuance puts you in an area that is closer to 
your home turf: 
“From your point of view, you are not wrong, but if you enrich 
your point of view with things that you have not yet taken into 
account, your observations will change: there are elements of 
your position that make you not right”. 
There is more than just one side to explore: 
“As I have concluded by analyzing your point of view, you 
would stand to gain from my own point of view, which allows 
me to say that you are wrong”. 
The path to get here is longer, but rewarding for both sides. And at the 
end of this path, a constructive discussion can open, along with negotiation, 
perhaps even a resolution of the conflict. 
We feel it is important not to get ourselves too caught up with a specific 
case, because we want to show that the semiotic square applies to all 
situations. Practicing it in theory, or really applying it in real situations, is 
not a solution to all problems. However, it gives those who are forced to 
switch into conflict mode a level of agility and even a different state of mind 
that will diminish tensions. 
7.18. Moving conflict onto new terrain 
By browsing through 3,000 years worth of conflict history, a strong 
conclusion has become clear to us. The biggest victories, particularly the 
asymmetrical ones, occurred when one of two camps radically changed the 
playing field on which the conflict was waged. Generally speaking, it 
appears that the one who moves a conflict to a political level then gains an 
absolutely decisive advantage. Of the many cases we have been able to 
examine, we will pick out just two which seem to perfectly illustrate this 
sliding effect. 
Moving conflict to another area is not an option, but an obligation. The 
history of conflict studies shows us that the “winner” is always the one who 
takes the opponent to different terrain. The most famous example of this rule 

166     New Technologies and Branding 
is the Vietnam War. Henry Kissinger analyzed this American debacle as 
follows: 
“We waged a conventional war. Our opponents waged a 
political war. Our goal was physical exhaustion. Our opponents 
sought to achieve our own psychological exhaustion. In this 
process, we lost sight of one of the fundamental laws of 
guerrilla warfare: the guerillas are winning, so long as they have 
not yet lost. A conventional army is losing as long as it has not 
yet won” [KIS 69]. 
This phenomenon is easily explained: changing the terrain makes it 
possible to place oneself in a new context, a new environment that we know 
better and especially one that the adversary does not yet know and in which 
he has not prepared to act in. 
Each conflict involving a Brand is unique. 
A change in the terrain where it is possible to operate is therefore specific 
to each situation. 
Auchan: Changing one terrain for another 
The Auchan group is planning to create the “mega-shopping complex” Europacity. The 
quotation marks indicate that it is almost impossible to name the project, given how varied, 
gigantic and unheard of it is. Comparing crazy numbers allows us to get an idea of this 
project, which is projected to open its doors in Paris in 2024: spread out over 80 hectares, 
Europacity will include 500 shops over 230,000 m² of shopping galleries, a 150,000 m² 
amusement park, 2,700 hotel rooms, an exhibition area, a conference center, a 7 hectare 
urban farm, a circus, etc. This “attraction center” is estimated to generate nearly 12,000 jobs 
and attract 30 million visitors, including 6 million tourists (two times more than Disneyland 
Paris). The magnitude of the project explains the vast array of critics who have attacked 
Auchan on very wide-ranging subjects: from disastrous environmental impacts, the paving-
over of good farmland (among the best in France!), the false promises of new jobs which 
would only be limited to local populations, the unscrupulous avoidance of EU guidelines, 
the encouragement of overconsumption by a giant distribution conglomerate, the falsity of 
its cultural ambitions, the independent orientation of the project, which did not think to “fit 
in” with its social ecosystem, the preplanned massacre of local businesses and much more 
hand-wringing about many other issues. 
The leaders of the project are on track to break the record for accumulating conflicts. 

Acting in Conflict     167 
Their strategy might be to fight back in every area: ecology, employment, innovation, 
land use, urban planning, economies of proximity, culture, the attractiveness of the territory, 
responsible consumption, ethics and even philosophy. 
However, allowing these all-out battles to multiply is a dangerous tactic, because it is 
exhausting, uncertain and insatiable. Moving conflicts one by one to another terrain and then 
converging all your efforts on the political terrain is a noteworthy course of action. 
Claude Brévan, president of the special committee responsible for organizing debate on 
this project, understood this perfectly. In the comments of his report in September 2016, he 
clearly gives the Auchan developers an opening to emphasize that these conflicts actually 
oppose “two visions of society diametrically opposed to one another”. On the one hand, a 
society that wants to free itself from the consumer rat race and instead prioritize a more 
sober way of life, with commitments to ecological and energy transitions; on the other hand, 
a society with a fixation on urban lifestyles or that aspire to them, but are blocked by 
unemployment, and who will only find sustainable solutions through a more classical model 
of growth and economic development.4  
These imbroglios involving controversial subjects must clearly be addressed in the 
political arena, and the first of the two camps that move into it has a decisive advantage. 
This is one of the most effective lessons from conflict studies, which empirically 
demonstrates that whoever reaches the political arena first will control the conflict until it is 
appeased, if not completely undone. 
Henry Kissinger, in one of his meditations on the military defeat in Vietnam, concluded 
that the Vietnamese had been wise to shift the perception of conflict from a military issue to 
a political issue. While the Americans made it into a military conflict, seeking to physically 
weaken the opposition, their opponents fought symbolically, aiming to cause the fighters 
psychological fatigue. The transition from a conventional war to a guerrilla approach 
prompted Kissinger to state that the problem of war is that until we have won it, we are 
losing it – while for the guerrillas, as long as they are not defeated, they continue to win. 
This ability to move the terrain from one dimension to another is also highly functional 
in civil society. For example, the disinformation campaign organized by those whom it is 
appropriate to name as merchants of doubt, who have taken efforts to oppose scientific 
studies on climate change with a systematic campaign of doubt.

7.19. The merchants of doubt 
The Merchants of Doubt, the astonishing, aptly named book [ORE 12] by 
two historians of science, is an exposé of an activity growing at a dizzying 
speed: controversy on demand. 
The model is quite simple: industrial players or lobbies whose interests 
are threatened by scientific studies that would tend to prove how dangerous 
their activity is, request works or even mere testimonies from scientists (or 
personalities renowned for their expertise) who are willing to contradict their 
peers in exchange for some extra cash. 
This is an issue of sowing doubt and thus taking advantage of the 
scientific method's quirky desire to justify doubt and criticism, and accepts 
embarking on new studies until an indisputable scientific consensus is 
reached. 
In this process, the merchants of doubt work to obstruct any decisions 
that are inconvenient for the interests of their backers. This is the negative 
role that lobbying sometimes plays; it is very influential with legislators and 
capable of delaying decisions or making decisions that are not for the 
common good. Companies are important players in society, and it is of 
course legitimate for them to express opinions on their own sectors and 
highlight the difficulties that they are facing. The publication of white papers 
and work in collaboration with commissions are a very respectable activity. 
However, this becomes a problem when these discussions have to remain 
secret and lead to decisions that are damaging to the general public.  
These cases have multiplied over the past few years, and are most often 
oriented in the direction we have just described. The most famous of these 
concerns the negation of the damage caused by tobacco, or the denunciation 
of a conspiracy between “tree huggers and politicians”, alleged to have 
fabricated the risks of global warming out of whole cloth. 
The inverse of this exists as well. Critics of a Brand can use the authority 
of scientists or experts to ruin the activity of that Brand. 
Claude Allègre, who was Minister of French National Education, 
Research and Technology in the administration of Lionel Jospin from 1997 
to 2000 is an almost cartoonish embodiment of this concept. In 1987, he was 
among the first to sound the alarm about global climate change as a result of 

Acting in Conflict     169 
human activity, and then radically changed his mind 20 years later, 
vehemently refuting the responsibility of humans and even revealing a 
mafia-like system within the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change). His theories, which are now outdated, continue to spread mistrust 
and to maintain doubt, because they are backed by the reputation of an old 
but well-known public figure. 
Doubt is amplified by the outrageous character of those who spread it. 
The more the expert seems undeniable, the more the doubt he instills gains 
strength. For example, Dr. Michel Aubier explained in a recent broadcast on 
France 5 (March 1, 2016) that the correlation between urban pollution and 
lung cancer is debatable. Michel Aubier is the head of the department of 
Pulmonology-Allergology at the Bichat Hospital in Paris, a professor at 
Université Paris-Diderot, a member and former director of the INSERM unit 
1152, “Pathophysiology and epidemiology of Michel Aubier, Respiratory 
Sufficiency”. He is also a medical consultant for the company Total. And 
that says it all. 
The merchants of doubt have a favorite argument: science advances by 
refutation. A thesis that is not approved by the whole community cannot be 
taken as true. That means it is sufficient just to put forward (or to completely 
fabricate) a debate. The second step is to invite themselves into each debate, 
to make it part of each article in the name of giving an impartial hearing to 
different points of view. Of course, the task of scientific activity is to reach 
conclusions that are considered true, as long as they are not challenged (this 
is the principle of fallibility developed by Karl Popper, a philosopher of 
science, intended to raise awareness of progress in science). But in the 
context of the merchants of doubt, this has more to do with artificially 
constructing a debate that would not really be one along the lines of a normal 
scientific debate.  
The merchants of doubt are doubly detrimental: first, they slow down 
scientific work, disturbing it for political reasons and turning the scientific 
ethic against itself, and on the other hand, by playing on the media and the 
general public for a cause that is often blatantly for their own commercial 
gain.  

 
Conclusion 
Conflict is inherent to human activity and remains constant within social 
relationships. It has constantly evolved, and both its causes and its 
manifestations are in constant flux. 
We have taken the initiative to bring together our experiences in conflict 
studies in this book, particularly in connection with our expertise regarding 
Brands, because the mechanisms of conflict are constantly evolving, and for 
many, conflict remains an inevitable aspect of their activity. 
Therefore, it is important for the leaders of Brands to be able to take stock 
of what is playing out in a conflict, to develop reflexes, to have the right 
reading guidelines so that, on whatever day it is that it occurs, they are able 
to take the most appropriate steps and to sense the unique pace of the 
conflict, rather than being paralyzed, or worse, acting inappropriately. 
Conflicts involve suffering. All of the cases we have studied demonstrate 
that. This is especially true when the conflict is not entered into by choice 
but instead is suffered by one of the parties, occurring with a very profound 
sense of injustice. 
We have repeated it on many occasions in our thinking, but it is essential 
to come back to this point in the conclusion: the advice and methods we 
provide in this book do not apply to malicious, negligent or greedy 
companies. There are legitimate conflicts and practices that deserve to be 
roundly criticized and prosecuted in court.

172     New Technologies and Branding 
Our focus is on brands that enter into a climate of conflict, as well as all 
authorities allowing this activity, and do not include any reprehensible 
activities in the way their business is conducted. 
A Brand that is swept into a poorly controlled conflict is in a greatly 
weakened position. But a sick Brand is not simply a damaged intangible 
asset, on a human level, it is also the subject of great pride that has been 
attained, and strongly restrained economic challenges. 
That is why for every person responsible for the brand, being able to 
handle a conflict is an essential skill among many others, because the job (as 
you well know) is as versatile and exhausting as it is rewarding. 
So, what would we like to conclude?  It is not to present a quicker and 
less complete repetition of what we have presented in the previous pages. To 
conclude, we would prefer to go back to an essential point: conflict is 
inevitable and necessary. It is suffering, but it can also be seen (and indeed 
must be seen) as an opportunity. This opportunity is for a Brand to be able to 
make its voice heard and its position understood.  
Far from some phony exercise in “storytelling” or industrial brand 
content, a conflict concerns the Brand and its people. Despite its negative 
force, a conflict is an authentic relationship, one that implies mutual 
recognition of opponents and an exchange. Take this dynamic as an 
invitation to take the stage and occupy it with gusto. This will not be done by 
reciting some canned speech about the glory of the Brand, but as the hero of 
the actantial model, plunging your audience right into the middle of it. Your 
Brand is the center of attention, why give some prepared speech when you 
can act? And real actions now count far more than speeches full of promises 
and pleasant-sounding sentiment. Today’s consumers are multifaceted: 
consumers, citizens and much more. Above all, they are tired of typical 
advertising messages and have become experts in detecting advertising 
messaging.  
Acting and controlling a conflict means having the courage to stand tall 
against biting critiques, and to build a strong, proud, engaging brand that 
knows how to interact and weave new links. If you follow these eight 
principles, you still will not be able to escape conflict, but you will be able to 
control it and to perceive everything that a conflict offers as an opportunity 

Conclusion     173 
to speak with firmness and a sense of calm, and to present your point of 
view.  
The seven rules 
Prepare: Mastering a conflict requires preparation. Since the conflict is a 
permanent exercise of improvisation with an often uncertain end, preparation 
allows you to limit the share of unforeseen events, to gain calmness and to 
act effectively in conflict by quickly isolating the actors and mechanisms at 
work. The danger then becomes the urge to cling to preparation as a safety 
barrier. It is important to prepare, but it is also important to know how to 
seize opportunities with spontaneity.  
Know: This knowledge regards conflict (theories, history, techniques), 
the terrain where the conflict will unfold (society, social networks). 
Knowing also means familiarizing yourself with conflict. It is difficult to 
enter confrontation if you do not know who you are facing, how they 
perceive themselves, what they expect from conflict and whether internally 
you do not know what your strengths are. Be careful not to overestimate 
your means. Many examples in history show that a weaker adversary with an 
ironclad will is capable of taking on the most powerful players.  
Assume: To be confronted with a conflict is not a mark of shame or any 
indication of guilt. That is why it is important to appear calm during conflict 
and to respond in a way that is directed toward the public. Your initial 
reflexes when a conflict arises are often the worst ones. You will be tempted 
to feel guilty, or hide the face of conflict, or want to sweep your conflict with 
this despised opponent under the carpet, because it is too small a problem to 
deal with. That would be a tragic mistake. A conflict that is neglected can 
blow up uncontrollably within a few days, to the point of becoming almost 
impossible to control. As we have seen, conflicts do not simply affect the 
guilty players, but also the leaders, or the ones with the most exposure. That 
is when we must come out of this sense of fatalism and succeed in seeing the 
conflict as an opportunity. That is the main challenge.  
Digitize: Studies show that conflicts are now playing out on social 
networks and the Internet on a mass scale. Though they do not always start 
there, a large-scale conflict will necessarily be waged over the Internet. In 
order not to let a conflict gain in intensity without your knowledge, it is 

174     New Technologies and Branding 
essential to be able to monitor the material being shared on social networks, 
at the risk of missing the sources feeding into the conflict. Before seeing 
stickers with accusations being slapped onto your products, or demonstrators 
in front of the gates of your factories, in many cases, the warning signs are 
widely visible on social networks. Social networks must be taken into 
account, but also taken advantage of. After all, you might as well make your 
case there, where the audience is. And you can bet that the audience is 
already very active on social networks. If you are now launching a strong 
message for your Brand, you will receive much more attention and 
credibility when you speak out on your page. In addition, you will have 
already assembled a community that will also be able to defend you and 
spread the messages of your brand.  
Move: We must not accept the terrain that the adversary places us on. 
Experience shows that the winner of a conflict is whoever manages to move 
the playing field. Therefore, a conflict starting on a specific area regarding 
public health can take on political undertones. Victory belongs to whoever 
controls the new field, because its opposition does not respond effectively to 
the challenges of the new area that has been chosen. Directly inspired by the 
Art of War by Sun Tzu, this is a matter of achieving an advantage by 
changing the symbolic location where the exchange will take place. This 
reframing is particularly effective, because it is highly confusing for the 
opponent. Indeed, the conceptual frameworks that have made it possible to 
define the conflict, its causes, the adversary and the reasons to mobilize, are 
often implicit. They are only rarely formulated explicitly. Therefore, 
proposing an area that is no longer suitable is equal to deconstructing the 
identity and the message of the adversary. It is difficult to do, but its 
effectiveness is not very hard to demonstrate. 
Tell: Stories are the legal tender of the exchanges in human relationships. 
All stories are based on a conflict that must be overcome. The question that 
remains is: who will hold the pen, and who will write the most convincing 
story. Whoever does this is the winner. All stories are based on tension. That 
is why any conflict (the quintessential moment of tension) is perfect material 
to give rise to a story. It remains to be seen what story will be chosen. There 
is a saying that says that the winners get to rewrite history. But maybe it is 
the other way around. The winners are those who have the most appealing 
story, that is, the one that is able to take advantage of the interest and the 
participation of the audience. A story that we have to suffer through is a 
drawback. Always use the narrative diagram to describe the story of your 

Conclusion     175 
opponent, understand the role you play there and finally, propose a more 
appealing story.  
Play: Telling a story is not enough. You have to live it. You have to take 
the stage. A conflict is not a fatality or a tragic accident. It is an invitation to 
get on stage. It means getting ready, but it is not planning. On the contrary, 
you must prepare to be spontaneous. Your tone, your voice, your style, your 
universe, all this is brought forward by taking the stage. The most telling 
imagery comes from the theater, and especially improvisational theater. 
Conflict puts you in the spotlight. Take this opportunity to express yourself. 
Tell your story. Make it live. To do this, you absolutely must live it, give it 
texture, share your emotions, your struggles. Unlike classical theater, it is not 
an issue of bringing a play to life that is already written. You can write the 
ending. But to do that, we must be able to be spontaneous. Be careful, this is 
not a call to take action without constraints or rules. Improvisation, as we 
have seen, requires preparation. You must know your story and the character 
of your brand by heart to be able to improvise without fear. 

 
Epilogue 
Véronique walked toward the council chamber with a spring in her step. 
This was the Monday morning ritual: start by looking over a file of digital 
reputation reports for 10 minutes, followed by a series of subjects, each for 
10 minutes as well. Some were more procedural, concerning the six themes 
of building the Brand; others only came up from time to time, but which 
nobody wanted to miss for a single second: “celebrity and arrogance of the 
Brand”, “answers to difficult questions” and so many others. 
The conflict had lasted 2 years. It had been cruel and devastating. The 
executives felt like they were trapped on a boat adrift at sea, without a keel, 
without a rudder and with a captain suffering from depression, schizophrenia 
or some other condition. The experiences learned from that conflict, that it 
can never be completely destroyed, but that it is possible to take control of it, 
had been a test as well. This was helpful.  
Today, VheTech feels as if it were built of concrete, steel and graphene, 
10 times stronger than before. The Brand is growing on solid foundations. It 
has learned to speak clearly and be sincere, to build strong and lasting 
relationships with all its audiences. Colleagues are no longer lost at sea on a 
lifeboat, floating aimlessly like a jellyfish, but on a finely crafted sailing ship 
with a clear course. Tomorrow, VheTech is poised to overtake the 
competitor who had taken advantage of its aimless movement through the 
black waters of conflict.

Appendix 
Wise Steps 
A.1. Why take these “wise steps”?  
Here, we present the concept of “wise steps”. We are assuming that you 
have just finished reading this entire book. We think it will be useful to bring 
together functional advice that will allow a Brand to prepare and act with 
calm in a conflict. The idea of these pages is to offer wise material, designed 
as necessary steps to be taken, in order, without leaving any out.  
A.2. The five agents of conflict 
Knowing all the actors involved is decisive in approaching a conflict. The 
trap is, after being familiar with a particular specific area, to “think you 
already know it”. It is important to carry out this work during a period of 
calm. In this way, the attacker then becomes merely a potential attacker, that 
is, a group of individuals known for their hostility. 
Take special care with the media, often classified under several of the 
“As”. They can be allies, attackers, arbitrators or – if they do not act – the 
audience, and their position can always change. 
Return to this (written) exercise when conflict breaks out, and change it 
whenever necessary.

Figure A.1. The five agents of conflict 
A.3. Name a conflict leader and a team 
The idea of re-establishing military hierarchies would seem to go against 
the current zeitgeist, but conflict requires flawless organization, arbitrations 
and quick decisions, even if they are concerted. Anyway, we need a leader 
and a team. 
Whether a man or woman, the ideal leader is a native of the country, 
trilingual (French, English and the language of the country) and has the 
ability to quickly and easily relate to people. 
The leader will ensure the initial training of his or her team and the 
preparatory work in a very short time, and will establish strong and lasting 
relationships with the largest number of local players. 
He or she will need to be assisted. This will mean at least one person, 
ideally three. The roles of each will be specifically defined in a period of 
calm. 
A.4. Teach the team the Brand 
The Brand is a representation that can be compared to a character, 
because it is the Brand that comes into contact with consumer-citizens, and 
forges a strong and durable bond with each of them to maintain their trust. 
Building a brand means choosing points of view, convictions, 
worldviews, values, qualities, faults, style, way of life, friends, enemies, etc. 
Learning the Brand means including all these personality traits and bringing 
them to life. In conflicts, this quasi-theatrical game is essential. 

Appendix     181 
A.5. Teaching the team about conflict 
The team, assembled around the leader of conflict, must work in full 
cooperation, even under pressure. 
Having the same level of knowledge of conflict is essential, since this 
will save time in taking action by avoiding internal debates and differences 
of messages in the heat of the moment. 
Sharing control of conflict is what transforms the conflict-suffering into a 
conflict saga. 
The roles assigned to everyone depend on each situation and, above all, 
on each team. Nevertheless, three tasks must always be assigned: 
– to collect (all information about the current conflict); 
– to speak (to respond); 
– to share (continue keeping your conflict journal, and share it with the 
dedicated team, the extended team of the subsidiary and the parent 
company). 
A.6. Choose and mix up the forms of response at each step 
A conflict is a process that evolves over time. 
At each new stage of conflict, it is necessary to question the way in which 
the events take shape and the attitude to be adopted. 
Not one reaction is preferable to another and none is a bad choice by 
nature. The key to success lies in adapting the reaction to the nature of the 
conflict. 
For the conflict leader, several attitudes are possible: 
– indifference: the Brand may decide not to enter conflict. Since they are 
too weak and poorly organized, opponents do not represent any threat, and 
answering them would instead give them the legitimacy they are seeking; 
– waiting: the decision is made to accept conflict, but without haste. 
Rather than blindly moving forward, time is taken to ascertain the validity of 
the alliances that have been forged, to learn about the situation and to assess 

182     New Technologies and Branding 
the intensity of the commitment of the adversary. This also avoids suffering 
the effects of the opponent’s rhythm; 
– negotiation: if the claims expressed in conflict are either deemed 
acceptable, or the two parties ultimately have more to lose than gain in 
engaging in conflict, finding a common ground is a solution to consider; 
– commitment: this is the most typical kind of attitude taken once a 
conflict occurs. The attacked group responds to the attacker. The conflict is 
accepted, and each party tries to push its adversary to accept its conditions;  
– capitulation: having failed on an unquestionable point, the attacker 
cannot engage in conflict without suffering even greater damage. 
Capitulation is probably the fastest way to shut off a conflict.
