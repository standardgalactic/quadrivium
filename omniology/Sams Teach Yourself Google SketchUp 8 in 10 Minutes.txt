Introduction
Welcome to SketchUp! This book is all about Google’s fantastically popu-
lar 3D modeling program, ready for you to create 3D drawings with.
SketchUp is ultrapowerful, and lets you draw models with ease. Need to
draw a new engine? SketchUp can do it. Need to lay out your back yard
plantings? SketchUp can help. Want to plan a new office, positioning
chairs, desks, and workstations as needed? SketchUp is for you.
SketchUp’s forte is 3D modeling—creating drawings of 3D objects. There
are plenty of 2D drawing programs out there but very few of SketchUp’s
caliber and ease of use for 3D.
Want to become a SketchUp-meister? Stay tuned, you’ve come to the
right book.
NOTE: What’s New In Google SketchUp 8
SketchUp 8 offers a variety of new features not found in SketchUp
7. For a list of what’s new in SketchUp, see http://sketchup.
google.com/product/newin8.html
What’s in This Book
You’re going to get a guided tour of SketchUp in this book. SketchUp is
too large a program to cover in complete detail in a book this size, but
you’re going to get a real working knowledge of SketchUp, suitable for
creating just about any drawing you want.
SketchUp offers you a super-powerful set of tools to work with, and this
book is about those tools. We’ll see how to draw basic figures using tools
such as
. The Rectangle tool
. The Circle tool
www.allitebooks.com

2 
Sams Teach Yourself Google SketchUp 8 in 10 Minutes
. The Polygon tool
. The Arc tool
as well as how to draw freehand.
We’ll see how to use tools to convert from 2D to 3D—tools like
. The Push/Pull tool
. The Move tool
. The Rotate tool
After going 3D, we’ll make use of the tools SketchUp offers for viewing
3D objects, such as
. The Orbit tool
. The Pan tool
. The Zoom tool
Having mastered 3D concepts and after we’re used to creating 3D objects,
we’ll see how to measure lengths and angles, as well as construct con-
struction guides with tools such as
. The Tape Measure tool
. The Dimensioning tool
. The Protractor tool
Then we’ll start getting into some tools specific to SketchUp, giving you
more 3D power:
. The Offset tool
. The Follow-Me tool
. The Section Pane tool
And more!
These tools are particular to SketchUp, and only SketchUp offers their
kind of power. The Offset tool lets you draw copies of edges at offsets

Introduction
from the original in case you want to repeat that surface (as when, for
example, you’re drawing an ornate window frame and want to copy a
curved edge to create a whole window frame). The Follow-Me tool is an
amazing one—it lets you specify a path and a shape or action, then pulls
that shape or action around your path, giving you a 3D result (so, for
example, if you bevel one side of a chair seat and want to bevel the other
three sides similarly, you can use the Follow-Me tool). And the Section
Pane tool lets you draw cross-sections through any surface in your model.
And there are yet more tools coming up, such as the Scale tool, which
enlarges or reduces models just by dragging the mouse, the Text
Annotation tool, which lets you add notes to your models, the 3D Text
tool, which lets you draw 3D text, and more.
All of which is to say: there’s a lot coming up on your guided tour.
Conventions Used in This Book
Whenever you need to click a particular button or link in SketchUp, you’ll
find the label or name for that item bolded in the text, such as “click the
Line tool.” In addition to the text and figures in this book, you also
encounter some special boxes labelled Tip, Note, or Caution.
TIP: Tips offer helpful shortcuts or easier ways to do something.
NOTE: Notes are extra bits of information related to the text that
might help you expand your knowledge or understanding.
CAUTION: Cautions are warnings or other important information you
need to know about consequences of using a feature or executing
a task.

What You’ll Need
All you’ll need to use this book is Google SketchUp itself.
SketchUp comes in two versions—free and paid. The paid version is the
“professional” version, but the free version is also immensely powerful.
We’ll be using the free version here. All you have to do is to download and
install it, following the directions at the beginning of Lesson 2.
That’s it. Everything you need for this book comes in SketchUp itself.
There’s nothing else needed. After you’ve installed the free version, you’re
ready to roll.

LESSON 1
Welcome to SketchUp
Welcome to Google SketchUp—the most powerful 3D graphics program
you can get for free (and it even comes in a paid version as well for extra
power).
Getting Started with SketchUp
There’s a huge amount of material to cover when talking about SketchUp,
so we’re going to spend this first lesson getting a short overview of what’s
possible. In the book as a whole, we’re going to get a real working knowl-
edge of SketchUp—enough to get you building and working with complex
models.
Let’s start by taking a look at SketchUp itself, which appears in Figure 1.1.
As you can see in Figure 1.1, Google SketchUp gives you a set of three
axes, giving your drawing a 3D feel from the start. That’s appropriate
because SketchUp is a 3D program; that is its main claim to fame.
It’s simple to create 3D objects in SketchUp, and you can do so in a vari-
ety of ways, as we’re going to see. The most amazing 3D models are pos-
sible in SketchUp. Take a look at Figure 1.2, for example.
You draw models like the one in the figure using tools from the toolbars.
By selecting individual tools such as the Line tool, the Circle tool, the
Polygon tool, and so on, you create the shapes step by step that compose
your desired model.
Let’s start with an overview of SketchUp in this lesson; then we’ll install
and start working with SketchUp in the next lesson.

Drawing Lines
FIGURE 1.3 
Drawing lines.
Drawing Lines
When you first start SketchUp, the Line tool is selected by default. And, as
you might expect, you can draw lines with this tool—see Figure 1.3.
Drawing lines is one of the simplest of figures you can make in
SketchUp—lines are one-dimensional, so they don’t exhibit any of the
helpful behavior SketchUp adds to other figures, such as snapping to axes,
being colored automatically, and more, as we’re about to see.
Drawing Simple Figures
Using tools such as the Rectangle tool, you can draw 2D shapes, like the
rectangle you see in Figure 1.4.
Besides rectangles, you can draw circles, polygons, and arcs using the cor-
responding tools.

8 
LESSON 1: Welcome to SketchUp
FIGURE 1.4 
A horizontal rectangle.
NOTE: Starting Simple
Information about the various tools is spread across all the
lessons in this book; you are encouraged to follow them in order
because they build on one another. However, you’ll find specific cov-
erage in certain lessons. For example, there’s more on drawing
lines, rectangles, and other simple figures in Lesson 3, “Drawing
Shapes: Lines, Rectangles, Polygons, and Circles.”
Notice that the rectangle in Figure 1.4 has an orientation—it’s horizontal.
Keep in mind that Google SketchUp is a 3D program. When you draw a
2D figure, you’re drawing a 2D figure in 3D.
By default, SketchUp makes such a figure horizontal, although you can
rotate it. SketchUp will also snap 2D figures to any underlying surface,
aligning them along that surface, as you can see in Figure 1.5, where
we’ve drawn rectangles that SketchUp has snapped to the sides of a 3D
polygon.

9
Pushing (or Pulling) for 3D
How do we create a 3D object like the one in Figure 1.5? By going 3D, as
we’ll see in the next section.
Pushing (or Pulling) for 3D
Converting objects from 2D to 3D in SketchUp is one of the coolest things
you can do. How does it work? You draw a 2D shape, and then pull (or
push) it into 3D.
For example, take a look at the polygon shape shown previously in Figure
1.5, the one with the rectangles on its sides. SketchUp recognizes the rec-
tangles as shapes, and so lets you pull them into 3D from the surrounding
surface using such tools as the Push/Pull tool.
For example, using the Push/Pull tool, you can push in the inner rectangle
in each face of the object, as you see in Figure 1.6.
All you do is select the Push/Pull tool, press the mouse button on the
shape you want to push or pull into 3D, and, holding the mouse button
FIGURE 1.5 
Rectangles snapped to the sides of a 3D polygon.

10 
LESSON 1: Welcome to SketchUp
FIGURE 1.6 
A 3D object.
You can the elaborate the object by pulling out the larger rectangles into
3D, as you see in Figure 1.7.
A couple more clicks let you add more structure to the object, as you see
in Figure 1.8.
Using the Push/Pull tool, you can also cut out sections of existing objects
to create holes, or windows, in those objects, as you see in Figure 1.9.
Panning and Orbiting
Given that objects exist in 3D in SketchUp, you might think that there are
various tools that let you see objects from various perspectives, and you’d
be right.
down, push or pull the shape. It’ll be pushed into or pulled out of the sur-
rounding surface, as you see in Figure 1.6.

LESSON 1: Welcome to SketchUp
FIGURE 1.9 
A window.
Creating and manipulating 3D models is something you’ll likely spend a
lot of time doing in SketchUp. We’ll get deeper into using the Push/Pull
tool in Lesson 5, “Going 3D.”
For example, you can use the Pan tool to move the drawing left or right, up
or down, or any combination of these, as you see in Figures 1.10 and 1.11.
You can also use the Orbit tool for a more truly 3D experience. This tool
lets you “orbit” around a model, changing perspective to any angle, as you
can see in Figures 1.12 and 1.13.
NOTE: Want More?
Panning and orbiting are given the in-depth treatment in Lesson 2,
“Up and Running with SketchUp.”

FIGURE 1.12 
Orbiting to one position.
FIGURE 1.13 
Orbiting to another position.

15
Rotating and Moving
You can also move and rotate objects themselves rather than just perspective.
Rotating and Moving
Although these tools are fairly self-explanatory, they are incredibly useful,
as you might imagine. Note that while the Orbit tool lets you orbit around
an object, the Rotate tool lets you rotate the object itself.
Take a look at Figure 1.14, showing a piano and a drum set.
Using the Rotate tool, you can rotate objects, as shown in Figure 1.15.
And using the Move tool, you can move objects around your drawing, as
shown in Figure 1.16. Notice that the piano has been rotated from its posi-
tion shown in Figure 1.15.
There is an infinite number of reasons you might want to rotate or move
objects, so for more on these tools check out Lesson 8, “Using the Rotate,
Scale, and Follow-Me Tools,” and Lesson 5, “Going 3D,” respectively.

17
Painting
Painting
Google SketchUp lets you paint the objects you create. You can paint them
with solid colors, and you can select from dozens of textures as well.
For example, say you want to draw three wooden crates. You draw three
cubes as shown in Figure 1.17, but they don’t look much like wooden
crates.
Using the Paint tool and selecting a texture, you can paint them to look
like wooden crates with a few clicks, as you can see in Figure 1.18 (in
black in white in this book, of course).
SketchUp provides the board-by-board texture and aligns the boards to the
various surfaces automatically. All you have to do is click a surface to
paint on. You’ll learn more about painting in Lesson 7, “Painting Your
Objects.”
FIGURE 1.17 
Three cubes.

18 
LESSON 1: Welcome to SketchUp
FIGURE 1.18 
Three crates.
Using the Component Libraries
Google maintains a 3D warehouse of prebuilt models for you to download
and use. There are dozens of such prebuilt models, and using them can
save you plenty of time.
Models with multiple parts are treated as a single unit called components
in SketchUp, and SketchUp offers you a number of component collections
in its 3D warehouse:
. Architecture
. Landscape
. Construction
. People
. Playground
. Transportation

19
Zooming
Inside each collection are multiple subcategories. For example, you can
see the subcategories for the Architecture category in Figure 1.19.
Some subcategories are themselves divided into further subcategories—for
example, the Furniture collection in the Architecture collection is divided
into the collections you can see in Figure 1.20.
You can see actual models from the furniture collection in Figure 1.21.
And you can see a simple glass-topped table from the collection in
Figure 1.22.
As you can see, there are dozens of models waiting for you to use them.
We’ll get more in-depth with these in Lesson 6, “Creating Components
and Groups.”
Zooming
Another powerful tool is the Zoom tool, which lets you zoom in and out.
For example, suppose you have the drawing in Figure 1.23, a small boat,
and you want a closer look.
FIGURE 1.19 
The Architecture subcategories.

22 
LESSON 1: Welcome to SketchUp
You can zoom in with the Zoom tool to see more detail, as you can see in
Figure 1.24.
In fact, zooming is such a common thing to do in SketchUp that the mouse
wheel is reserved for this purpose—wheeling one way zooms in, the other
zooms out.
Creating Guides and Dimension
Indicators
There are all kinds of construction aids in SketchUp as well. For example,
take a look at Figure 1.25, where you can see a cube with some construc-
tion guides added.
Construction guides can be positioned anywhere in a drawing, and you can
use them to align objects. As you can see, they appear as dotted lines in a
FIGURE 1.24 
Zooming in on a small boat.

23
Lots of Cool Stuff Coming Up
FIGURE 1.25 
A cube with construction guides.
You can also add dimensioning indicators to a drawing, as you see in
Figure 1.26.
Those dimensions will change as you resize an object. Lesson 10,
“Dimensioning, Drawing Angles, and Getting Cross Sections of Models”
is where you will find more on this topic.
Lots of Cool Stuff Coming Up
There is a lot of cool stuff coming up, such as the Follow-Me tool, which
lets you specify a path and a shape, as you see in Figure 1.27.
With the Follow-Me tool, you can make SketchUp move the shape along the
path you’ve specified, resulting in a new object, as you see in Figure 1.28.
Suppose you had a model of a playground, as shown in Figure 1.29.
drawing, and if you wanted to add another cube lined up with the current
one, you could use those guides to help.

LESSON 1: Welcome to SketchUp
You can take a cross section of the model anywhere you want to get a
clearer view of various components, as you see in Figure 1.30.
You can even do 3D text, as you see in Figure 1.31.
With all this coming up, let’s dig in immediately to the next lesson and get
you up and running with SketchUp!

LESSON 2
Up and Running with
SketchUp
You’re about to start working with an amazing program—Google
SketchUp.
What SketchUp Is All About
The name of the game with Google SketchUp is 3D drawing. Not just
drawing, because there are tons of programs out there to help you with
that, but 3D drawing. In this lesson, you’ll see how easy and quick it is to
create 3D drawings.
That’s not to say that all of SketchUp is easy. A program this complex has
some sticky points, which we’re going to cover in this book. But Google
has made 3D drawing just about as simple as it could become and still
retain real power.
SketchUp comes in two versions—SketchUp itself, which is free, and
SketchUp Pro, which is not. We’re going to be using SketchUp—the free
version—in this book, but you should also know SketchUp Pro is available
in case SketchUp doesn’t meet your needs.
TIP: SketchUp Pro
SketchUp Pro is 3D modeling software for professionals. Pro is
billed as being everything that traditional CAD software is, only eas-

This lesson gets us started with SketchUp. We’ll see where to get it and
install it. Then we’ll start SketchUp and cover the basic concepts you need
to know before using it.
Then we’ll take it out for a spin.
Let’s jump in immediately by installing SketchUp.
Getting and Installing SketchUp
You can download SketchUp for free from its website. Just follow these
directions:
1. Navigate to the SketchUp site, www.sketchup.com (or http:/
/sketchup.google.com). The SketchUp site appears, as shown in
Figure 2.1.
2. Click the Download Google SketchUp button. This causes the
page you see in Figure 2.2 to appear.
3. Click the Download Google SketchUp button again. This brings
up the license agreement you see in Figure 2.3.
4. Select the option button for your operating system. The choices are
. Windows XP/Vista/7
. Mac OS X (10.5+)
5. Read the terms and click the Agree and Download button.
6. Let your browser download and save the installation file.
Depending on your browser, you might have to click a yellow bar
at top of the browser window and select the Download File
menu item. If your browser asks you where to save the file, select
a convenient directory, or create a new one named SketchUp.

7. Double-click the downloaded file. A dialog box may appear
warning you of the risk of running downloaded files. If so, click
the Run button in the dialog box. The SketchUp installer starts,
as shown in Figure 2.4.
8. Click the Next button. SketchUp displays agreement text for you
to read.
9. If you agree, select the I Agree to the Terms of the License
Agreement check box.
10. Click Next.
11. SketchUp displays a dialog box displaying its preferred default
location on your disk. If you want to change the installation loca-
tion from the default, click the Change button and enter the new
installation directory, then click OK.
12. Click Next.
13. Click Install to begin the installation. Google SketchUp is
installed, and a final dialog box appears.

33

14. Click Finish.
That’s it—you’ve installed Google SketchUp.
Starting SketchUp
Let’s fire up SketchUp and see what we’ve downloaded. After getting it
started in this task, we’ll get used to a few essential tools in the follow-
ing task.
1. Double-click the SketchUp program file to start it, or, in
Windows, select it from the Start menu. The dialog box you see
in Figure 2.5 appears.
2. Click the Choose Template button. The template you select will
determine the drawing background (if any) and the units of the
drawing (feet, meters, and so on). You need to select a template
before SketchUp will start, and the template you choose will
become your default template the next time you open SketchUp.
When you click the Choose Template button, a list of templates
appears, as shown in Figure 2.6.

34

35
Starting SketchUp
NOTE: Changing the Default Template
Selecting a template makes it the default when SketchUp starts
up, so when you start SketchUp from now on and click the Start
Using SketchUp button, you’ll be using the Simple Template select-
ed in step 3. To change that, click the Choose Template button and
select the template you want, then click the Start Using SketchUp
button.
3. Click the top template to select it, as shown in Figure 2.6. We’ll
use other templates in the following lessons, but the Simple tem-
plate gives us a blue sky, green Earth, and a person standing in
the middle for scale—a good template to get started with.
4. Click the Start Using SketchUp button. SketchUp appears, as
shown in Figure 2.7, using the template we’ve selected as back-
ground.
Now you’ve got SketchUp running—congratulations.

36 
LESSON 2: Up and Running with SketchUp
NOTE: Listen to the Instructor
Note the dialog box along the right side, showing information about
the Select tool. This dialog box is called the Instructor, and it’s very
useful to learn about the tools in the toolbox, which appear at the
top of the SketchUp window. The Select tool (an arrow much like
the default mouse pointer) is the default tool in SketchUp, active
when you start SketchUp, which is why the Instructor is explaining
its use in selecting items in SketchUp.
Leave the Instructor open for now because it’s a very useful guide
to the tools in the toolbox. When you close the Instructor later, you
can get it back by clicking the round question mark button at the
bottom of SketchUp.
Understanding the Parts of
SketchUp
As with most applications, you need to become familiar with the basic ele-
ments. Let’s take a look at the various parts of SketchUp, as shown in
Figure 2.8.
FIGURE 2.8 
The parts of SketchUp.

37
Using the Orbit Tool
As you’d expect, SketchUp comes with the normal parts of most applica-
tions you’re familiar with:
. The menu bar—Includes familiar menus such as File, Edit, and
so on. We’ll be making use of the items in SketchUp’s menus
throughout this book.
NOTE: The Getting Started Toolbars
Note that by default, SketchUp shows only its Getting Started tool-
bar, which is the toolbar you see in Figure 2.8. To see the full tool
set, select the View menu, then the Toolbars item, then the Large
Tool Set menu item.
. The toolbar—Includes various drawing tools, as you can see
labeled in Figure 2.8.
. The status bar—Contains buttons to show you who designed the
current item open in SketchUp, information about the current
item, and a Help button (the button with the question mark cap-
tion) that turns the Instructor dialog box on and off.
That’s SketchUp in overview. Now let’s start using some tools.
Using the Orbit Tool
There are three primary tools that you have to get familiar with to start
working with SketchUp: Orbit, Pan, and Zoom. We’ll take a look at the
Orbit tool in this task and the Pan and Zoom tools in the following two
tasks.
The reason that these three tools are the important ones to start out with is
that they give you a handle on working in 2D. New users not familiar with
these tools can grope around in the dark in SketchUp before finally getting
a grip on how to work with 3D.
The Orbit tool lets you examine a 2D figure—called a model in
SketchUp—from all different directions. By rotating the Orbit tool, you
can examine the model you’re creating from all angles.

38 
LESSON 2: Up and Running with SketchUp
Here’s how to use the Orbit tool:
1. Start SketchUp. The Welcome to SketchUp dialog box appears.
For this task, we’ll work with the Simple Template we’ve used in
the previous tasks.
2. Click the Start Using SketchUp button. This opens SketchUp
using the Simple Template from the previous task as the default
template, as shown in Figure 2.9.
3. Click the Orbit tool in the toolbar (as shown in Figure 2.9).
4. Move the Orbit tool around SketchUp’s workspace. As you do,
the angle from which you view the current contents of the win-
dow changes, as you can see in Figure 2.10. The Orbit tool
enables you to view your models in 3D just by moving the tool
around the screen.

39
Using the Pan Tool
TIP: Experiment with the Orbit Tool
It’s a good idea to play with the Orbit tool for a while, getting used
to what it does, and noting the 3D feeling you get by rotating the
current model.
Using the Pan Tool
The Pan tool lets you move from side to side and up and down. The Pan
tool’s icon is a hand, and that’s appropriate, because you “grasp” the dis-
play and move it around.
The angle doesn’t change when you use the Pan tool, unlike when you use
the Orbit tool. Here’s how to put the Pan tool to work:
1. Click the Start Using SketchUp button. This opens SketchUp
with the Simple Template we’ve set as the default in the previous
tasks.
FIGURE 2.10 
Using the Orbit tool.

40 
LESSON 2: Up and Running with SketchUp
2. Click the Pan tool in the toolbar (shown in Figure 2.11).
3. Press the mouse button in SketchUp’s display to “grasp” the
display.
4. Drag the mouse to move the display. When you do, the whole
display moves around without changing angle or perspective, as
you can see in Figure 2.11.
The Pan tool gives you a way of viewing your models by moving them
from side to side and up and down.
Using the Zoom Tool
The Zoom tool lets you zoom in and out of the display—that is, magnify
your view, if you want to. That’s great to see the smaller details of a
model.
The Pan Tool
FIGURE 2.11 
Using the Pan tool.

41
Using the Zoom Tool
Here’s how to put the Zoom tool to work:
1. Click the Start Using SketchUp button. This opens SketchUp
with the Simple Template we’ve set as the default in the previous
tasks.
2. Click the Zoom tool in the toolbar (shown in Figure 2.12).
3. Press the mouse button in SketchUp’s display.
4. Drag the mouse upward to zoom the display in and drag down-
ward to zoom the display out. When you do, the whole display
zooms in and out without changing angle or perspective, as you
can see in Figure 2.12.
The Zoom tool gives you a way of magnifying your models—very handy
at times.

42 
LESSON 2: Up and Running with SketchUp
TIP: Using the Mouse Wheel to Zoom
If your mouse has a wheel on it, you can zoom in and out just by
thumbing the wheel—even if a tool such as the Select tool is
selected and not the Zoom tool.
Selecting a Work Template
Until now, we’ve been using the first template that SketchUp had to
offer—the Simple Template measured in feet and inches, with a human
figure in the middle of it, along with blue sky and green earth.
However, you probably don’t want someone standing there in a field under
a blue sky when drawing your own models. The most common template to
use has no background at all, no sky, no ground—just a set of three axes to
show you the three dimensions.
In this task, we see how to select a good working template that has no fea-
tures other than the three axes. Here’s how to set this up:
1. From the Welcome to SketchUp page, click the Choose
Template button. The template selection dialog box appears.
2. Click the Engineering–Feet template to select it (as shown in
Figure 2.13).
3. Click the Start Using SketchUp button. This opens SketchUp
with the Engineering–Feet template.
4. Select the human figure in the template by clicking it. You can
see the human figure selected in Figure 2.14.
5. Delete the human figure by pressing the Del key. The figure dis-
appears. You now have a clean slate for creating your own mod-
els without any distracting backgrounds.
The Engineering–Feet or Engineering–Meters templates are useful because
they don’t give you a background, so you’re free to design your own. We’ll
use these templates frequently in this book.

LESSON 2: Up and Running with SketchUp
Understanding SketchUp Axes
If you take a look at Figure 2.14, you’ll see three axes corresponding to
the x, y, and z axes you may be familiar with. The x and y axes form the
horizontal plane, and the z axis points vertically out of that plane.
We’ll call the axis in the foreground that’s closest to a horizontal line the x
axis; the other horizontal axis, which goes into the page, the y axis; and
the vertical axis the z axis, as shown in Figure 2.15.
Those are the three names we’ll use for the axes—x, y, and z.
What you can’t see in Figure 2.15 (because this is a black-and-white book)
is that the axes are colored:
. The x axis is red.
. The y axis is green.
. The z axis is blue.
FIGURE 2.15 
The three (x, y, z) axes.

45
Understanding Edges and Surfaces
TIP: Axes Coloring
You’ll sometimes see axes referred to by color in the SketchUp
help files, so it can be helpful to bear the previous list of color
associations in mind.
The reason the axes are colored is that the shapes you draw (see the next
lesson) are usually aligned with one or another axis by SketchUp automat-
ically, and SketchUp will indicate the color axis the shape is being aligned
with. So, for example, as you draw one edge of a rectangle, a ToolTip (a
small yellow window with some text) will appear, reading On Red Axis to
show that your drawing action is being aligned with the x (red) axis. This
is helpful because by default SketchUp automatically snaps what you draw
to be parallel to an axis to let you draw shapes easily without wondering
how they will line up with the axes. This will become more apparent as we
start to draw shapes in coming sections.
Understanding Edges and
Surfaces
Another crucial SketchUp concept is about edges and surfaces. All models
are constructed using edges and surfaces in SketchUp. Edges and surfaces
are just what you think they are, as shown in Figure 2.16.
Surfaces are always bounded by edges, and you need a closed figure creat-
ed out of edges to create a surface. For example, you might use the Line
tool to draw two lines, as shown in Figure 2.17.
When you connect the two lines with a third line to create a closed figure,
SketchUp automatically recognizes that you’ve created a surface and col-
ors it in, as shown in Figure 2.18.
TIP: Erase an Edge and Your Surface Is Gone
If you erase one of the bounding edges of a surface, that surface
disappears—it’s no longer a surface. You can, however, re-create
the surface by redrawing the last edge—a process known as
healing a surface.

46

FIGURE 2.16 
Edges and surfaces.
FIGURE 2.17 
Two lines.

47
Understanding Edges and Surfaces
FIGURE 2.18 
SketchUp colors in closed figures.
Another thing to know is that a surface must lie in the same plane in
SketchUp. That is, you can’t have single surfaces that curl up in any
way—they must be flat. That’s not a problem when drawing curved mod-
els, however—you simply use a lot of flat surfaces.
TIP: When a Closed Figure Does Not Create a Surface
You create surfaces from figures with closed edges, and SketchUp
colors the surface in when it’s done. But what happens if you draw
a surface and SketchUp doesn’t treat it as a surface and doesn’t
color it in as a surface? Often the problem is that the edges you
drew turn out not to be in the same plane. Because SketchUp
snaps the lines you draw to the various axes or other already-drawn
edges, and you’re drawing in 3D, it’s easy to create figures that are
all in one plane by mistake. However, it’s hard to see that they’re
not in the same plane. To check whether a surface is all in the
same plane, use the Orbit tool to orbit around it in 3D.

48 
LESSON 2: Up and Running with SketchUp
When you draw an edge, by default that edge is aligned with the x, y, or z
axis as you draw, and the color of the edge will match the color of the axis
(x=red, y=green, z=blue). If you don’t want to align a line with the axis
SketchUp has chosen, just shift the line as you draw it (by dragging the
mouse while you’re drawing the line) to match the axis you want, and
SketchUp will align the line with that axis.
Drawing Edges
Let’s get started doing some actual drawing in SketchUp by drawing a few
edges using the Line tool. Here’s how it works:
1. Click the Start Using SketchUp button. SketchUp starts with the
Engineering –Feet template we selected as the default in previous
tasks. Click the human figure that appears in the template to
select it, and press the Del key to delete it.
2. Click the Line tool to select it (shown in Figure 2.19).
3. Press the mouse button where you want one end of the line to
start. Pressing the mouse button anchors the line you’re about to
create.
4. Drag the mouse to the other end of the line. You can see a line
being drawn in Figure 2.19.
NOTE: SketchUp Automatically Aligns Your Lines
Note that SketchUp automatically aligns your line with one of the
axes (the one you’re dragging parallel to) so it’s easy to draw exact-
ly parallel to an axis. The line is colored to match the axis it’s
aligned to (x=red, y=green, z=blue). A ToolTip will appear as you’re
dragging the mouse to tell you what axis you’re aligned with (as
appears in Figure 2.19).

49
Drawing Edges
The Line
Tool
FIGURE 2.19 
Use the mouse and the Line tool to draw.
5. Release the mouse button to complete the line. When you release
the mouse button, your new line is drawn and becomes an edge.
Congratulations—you’ve created a new edge.
To make it easy to draw other edges that connect to this edge, SketchUp
labels various points on the edge as you let the Line tool roll over the
edge, as you can see in Figure 2.20.
TIP: Connecting Edges
When you draw an edge that you want to connect to another edge,
you typically let the mouse hover over an end point of the first edge
until the end point circle and the ToolTip labeled Endpoint appears.
Press the mouse button over the end point and then draw the next
edge.

50 
LESSON 2: Up and Running with SketchUp
FIGURE 2.20 
An edge’s midpoint.
In particular, when you hover the Line tool over the ends of an edge (that
is, over the line’s end points), a small circle appears on the end point of the
edge with the ToolTip labeled Endpoint. When you move the Line tool so
that it’s on the edge (and thus any edge you draw will be connected to the
current one), a small red square appears where the mouse cursor is on the
line with the ToolTip labeled On Edge. When you hover the Line tool
above the midpoint of the edge, a small circle appears on the edge at the
location of the mouse pointer with the ToolTip labeled Midpoint (as shown
in Figure 2.20).
Inferring Edges
Many times when you’re drawing edges, you want to draw one edge paral-
lel to another and end so you can connect the two edges with another edge
that goes from end point to end point while the new edge is parallel to an
axis. For example, take a look at the situation in Figure 2.21.

51
Inferring Edges
There are two edges there—now suppose you want to draw a third edge on
your way to making a rectangle. The third edge will be at the bottom of
the figure, parallel to the top edge.
But how far should you draw the bottom edge so that its end point will be
directly under the corresponding end point of the top edge? You can guess
visually where to stop drawing the third edge so that its end point will end
up right under the top edge’s end point, but SketchUp provides you with a
better way.
Because this is such a common operation—ending an edge at the correct
location to match another edge’s end point—SketchUp has a special name
for it: inferring. When you infer an edge, you align it with another edge so
that its end point is ready to be connected to another edge’s end point with
a new edge that is parallel to an axis.
FIGURE 2.21 
The need for inferring an edge.
www.allitebooks.com

52 
LESSON 2: Up and Running with SketchUp
Here’s how inferring works, making it easy to draw figures so that all
edges line up with axes:
1. Click the Start Using SketchUp button. SketchUp starts with the
Engineering–Feet template we selected as the default in previous
tasks. Click the human figure that appears in the template to
select it, and press the Del key to delete it.
2. Click the Line tool to select it.
3. Draw two edges like those in Figure 2.21.
4. Draw a new edge from the end point of the vertical edge until a
dotted line appears connecting the new edge and the top edge, as
shown in Figure 2.22. That dotted line appears automatically as
SketchUp infers you might want to line up the current edge’s end
point with the end point of the top edge.
5. If no dotted line appears, indicate to SketchUp which edge you
want it to infer from by letting the mouse pointer hover over the
FIGURE 2.22 
Inferring an edge.

53
Inferring Edges
top edge for two seconds. This establishes which edge you want
to infer from, in case SketchUp doesn’t guess right. After letting
the mouse hover over the edge you want to infer from for two
seconds, redraw the third edge, and the dotted line connecting the
end points should appear.
6. Release the mouse button to draw the third edge, as shown in
Figure 2.23.
Now you’re in a good position to complete the figure and create a surface
(because all edges are in the same plane). To complete the surface, just
connect the end points of the top and bottom edges—thanks to inferring,
their end points are already lined up.
When you connect the last two end points, SketchUp realizes you’ve creat-
ed a surface and colors it in as a surface, as you can see in Figure 2.24.
In the next lesson, we’ll start drawing shapes in SketchUp.
FIGURE 2.23 
A new edge.

A new surface.

LESSON 3
Drawing Shapes: Lines,
Rectangles, Polygons,
and Circles
In this lesson, you’ll see how to create shapes—rectangles, circles, arcs,
and so on. Those are the basic shapes you create other shapes from in
SketchUp, and learning how to handle each of these is important.
Getting Started
Bear in mind that what you learned about edges and surfaces in the previ-
ous lesson applies here. In particular, it’s important to make sure that you
don’t draw any edge over any other edge.
TIP: Crossing Edges
If it looks like you have to draw figures that cross edges, such as a
line going across a rectangle, don’t. Instead, draw the line up to
the rectangle’s edge, then draw a new line inside the rectangle to
continue. Always remember: don’t cross edges, because it confus-
es SketchUp. We’ll see when you can bend this rule later.
Let’s jump in immediately by drawing some lines (that is, edges).
TIP: Selecting a Template
In this and the following lessons, we’re going to be using the
Engineering template in SketchUp so that we have no background
to get in the way. You’re free to select your own template, of course
(see Lesson 2, “Up and Running with SketchUp”), but the

56 LESSON 3: Drawing Shapes: Lines, Rectangles, Polygons, and Circles
Engineering background gives you a clean, empty canvas without
any distracting background, so it’s recommended when you’re just
starting out in SketchUp.
Drawing Lines
You use the Line tool in SketchUp to draw—edges. Perhaps you thought I
was going to say lines, but in fact, the Line tool really draws edges. You
can connect those edges when you draw them, creating a closed figure,
which, if it all lies in the same plane, SketchUp treats as a figure.
TIP: Drawing Edges
We already have put the Line tool to work drawing a few edges and
closing the figure to complete a surface. Take a look at the previ-
ous lesson if you want to bone up on edges and surfaces.
Here’s how to use the Line tool to draw an individual edge:
1. Click the Start Using SketchUp button on the Welcome page.
2. Click the human figure that appears in the Engineering–Feet tem-
plate by default to select it and press the Del key to delete it.
3. Click the Line tool in the toolbar.
4. Move the mouse to the start point of the new edge you’re about
to draw.
5. Press the mouse button. Doing so anchors the edge you’re draw-
ing at that location.
6. Drag the mouse to the end point of the new edge you’re drawing.
When you do, a line stretches from the first anchor point to the
current location of the mouse.
TIP: Aligning to Axes
When the line you’re drawing is parallel to an axis, the line changes
color to match (red=x axis, green=y axis, blue=z axis). In addition, a

57
Drawing Multiline Shapes
ToolTip will appear at the mouse cursor location. Notice also that
when you draw, the line will align to other edges as well for your
convenience. And if you don’t want them aligned to other edges,
just keep dragging the mouse until the line snaps to a new align-
ment.
7. Release the mouse button. When you do, a line appears from the
first anchor point to the current location of the mouse, as shown
in Figure 3.1.
That’s it—you’ve just drawn an edge.
Drawing Multiline Shapes
You usually don’t draw just a single edge when you’re using SketchUp;
instead, you draw many connected edges.
FIGURE 3.1 
A new edge.

58 LESSON 3: Drawing Shapes: Lines, Rectangles, Polygons, and Circles
It’s not hard to draw a new edge connecting to an existing edge in
SketchUp. When you’re drawing the new edge and approach any existing
edges, you’ll see a red square appear on the existing edge when you’re on
that edge. That means that releasing the mouse will connect your new edge
to the existing one. When you’re near an end point, a circle colored in
green will appear on the existing edge at the end point, and a cyan circle
will appear for the midpoint,
TIP: Watch the ToolTips
There’s no need to try to memorize the various red squares and
cyan or green circles that appear on edges when you’re connecting
other edges to them—ToolTips will also appear, labeled Endpoint,
On Edge, and so on.
So although you can connect one edge to another, it’s a little tedious.
SketchUp recommends instead that you draw multiple edges all at once, if
you can. That way, you can just “connect the dots” to draw a new figure,
and SketchUp will keep drawing new edges as long as you move the
mouse. Because it realizes you’re drawing multiple edges, SketchUp keeps
drawing lines until you tell it to stop by hitting the Esc key.
Here’s how to use the Line tool to draw multiline figures working with the
Engineering–Feet template set in the previous task:
1. Click the Start Using SketchUp button and delete the human
figure that appears by default.
2. Click the Line tool in the toolbar.
3. Move the mouse to the start point of the new edge you’re about
to draw and click the mouse.
4. Move the mouse to the end point of the new edge—which is also
the start point of the new edge—and click it.
5. Repeat step 5 for all the new edges in your drawing. SketchUp
will keep drawing edges between the locations you click in your
drawing.

59
Drawing Measured Lines
6. Press Esc to make SketchUp stop drawing edges. SketchUp will
stop drawing edges, and your multiline figure is complete, as
shown in Figure 3.2.
In this way, SketchUp makes drawing a multi-edge figure easy.
Drawing Measured Lines
You can also tell SketchUp just how long you want your edges to be when
you draw them. Note that we are still working with the Engineering–Feet
template set in the previous task.
Here’s how to draw measured edges:
1. Click the Start Using SketchUp button.
2. Click the Line tool in the toolbar.
3. Move the mouse to the start point of the new edge you’re about
to draw and click the mouse.
FIGURE 3.2 
Drawing a multiline figure.

60 LESSON 3: Drawing Shapes: Lines, Rectangles, Polygons, and Circles
4. Move the mouse toward the end point of the new edge.
5. Enter the length of the new edge. You can enter the following:
. cm to signify centimeters
. m to signify meters
. ' for feet
. " for inches
Thus, for example, 5m means five meters, 5" means five inches,
and so on.
6. Press Enter. SketchUp draws the new edge with the length
you’ve requested.
Being able to set the length of edges is crucial for engineering and archi-
tectural drawings.
Drawing Rectangles
It takes only two clicks to draw a rectangle in SketchUp. Of course, rec-
tangles are surfaces, so when you’re done drawing one, SketchUp will
color it as a surface.
Bear in mind that according to SketchUp rules, no rectangle should ever
cross another rectangle or any other edge, for that matter. However, it’s
fine to draw a rectangle so that an edge lies on top of an edge from another
figure, such as another rectangle.
Here’s how to use the Rectangle tool:
1. Click the Start Using SketchUp button and delete the human
figure that appears within the Engineering–Feet template.
2. Click the Rectangle tool in the toolbar (shown in Figure 3.3).
3. Move the mouse to one corner of the new rectangle you’re about
to draw and click the mouse.
4. Move the mouse to the opposite corner of the rectangle and click
it. SketchUp will draw the rectangle, as shown in Figure 3.3.
As you can see, it’s simple to draw rectangles.

61
Drawing Rectangles
The Rectangle
Tool
FIGURE 3.3 
Drawing a rectangle.
TIP: Dragging Rectangles
You can also press the mouse button at one corner of the rectan-
gle and then drag the mouse to the opposite corner, then release
the mouse to draw the rectangle. It’s easier to click the mouse
once in one corner and then in the opposite corner if you’re creat-
ing measured rectangles. See the next task.
Drawing Measured Rectangles
You can also give SketchUp the dimensions you want your rectangle to be
as you draw it.
Here’s how to create measured rectangles:
1. Click the Start Using SketchUp button and delete the human
figure that appears within the Engineering–Feet template.
2. Click the Rectangle tool in the toolbar.

62 LESSON 3: Drawing Shapes: Lines, Rectangles, Polygons, and Circles
3. Move the mouse to one corner of the new rectangle you’re about
to draw and click the mouse.
4. Move the mouse toward the opposite corner of the new rectangle.
5. Enter the dimensions of the new rectangle, separated by commas.
You can enter these units:
. cm to signify centimeters
. m to signify meters
. ' for feet
. " for inches.
For example, to draw a rectangle of 5 meters by 6 meters, enter 5m, 6m.
6. Press Enter. SketchUp draws the new rectangle with the length
you’ve requested.
Being able to set the dimensions of rectangles is useful for drawing plans,
as in engineering and architectural drawings.
Drawing Circles
The Circle tool does just as you’d expect; it draws circles. That is, it
almost does—in fact, what it does is draw 24-sided polygons by default as
circles. You can set the number of sides to anything you want, however.
TIP: The Polygon Tool Versus the Circle Tool
So circles are really polygons in SketchUp, and they default to 24
sides. Interestingly, SketchUp also has a polygon tool, and it
defaults to six sides. But if you set the tools to the same number
of sides, they draw identical surfaces. So what’s the difference?
The difference comes when you push or pull the circle or polygon
into 3D, as we’ll do soon. No matter how many sides it has, a cir-
cle will give you cylindrical sides when you pull it into 3D, whereas
a polygon will retain the number of sides the face has on the part
that’s cylindrical for a circle being dragged into 3D. So if you draw a
vertical pillar with a top that’s a circle, the sides of the pillar will be
a smooth cylinder. But if the top face of the pillar is a polygon, the

63
Drawing Circles
sides of the pillar will have the same number of sides as the poly-
gon. That’s the only real difference between circles and polygons
(other than the default number of sides for circles is 24, and the
default number of sides for polygons is 6).
Here’s how to use the Circle tool:
1. Click the Start Using SketchUp button and delete the human
figure that appears within the Engineering–Feet template.
2. Click the Circle tool in the toolbar (shown in Figure 3.4).
3. Move the mouse to the location of the center of the circle you
want to draw and click the mouse.
4. Move the mouse to the edge of the circle. SketchUp draws the
circle as you move the mouse.
The Circle Tool
FIGURE 3.4 
Drawing a circle.

64 LESSON 3: Drawing Shapes: Lines, Rectangles, Polygons, and Circles
5. Click the mouse. SketchUp draws the circle permanently (unless
you erase it, of course).
And that’s it for drawing circles. When a circle has been drawn, it’s a sur-
face, and SketchUp colors it in, as you can see in Figure 3.4.
TIP: Dragging Circles
Just as you can with rectangles, you can also press the mouse but-
ton at the center of a circle you want to draw, drag the mouse to
the edge of the circle, and then release the mouse to draw a circle.
It’s easier to click the mouse once in the center and then on the
edge if you’re creating measured circles, however; see the next
task.
Drawing Measured Circles
Just as you can with any other figure, you can give SketchUp a size for the
circle you’re drawing, as you draw it.
Here’s how to create measured circles:
1. Click the Circle tool in the toolbar.
2. Move the mouse to the location of the center of the circle you
want to draw and click the mouse.
3. Move the mouse toward the edge of the new circle.
4. Enter the radius measurement of the new circle. You can enter
these units:
. cm to signify centimeters
. m to signify meters
. ' for feet
. " for inches.
For example, to draw a circle with a radius of 5 meters, enter 5m.
5. Press Enter. SketchUp draws the new circle with the radius
you’ve requested.
When the circle has been drawn, it’s a surface, as mentioned in the 
previous task, and SketchUp colors it in.
When the circle has been drawn, it’s a surface, as mentioned in the 
previous task, and SketchUp colors it in.

65
Drawing Polygons
Drawing Polygons
You can also draw polygons with SketchUp. Presumably because you can
draw polygons with the circle tool (see the task after next), the Polygon
tool doesn’t appear on the Getting Started toolbar that we’ve been using,
so we’ll have to use the “large” toolbar here to access the Polygon tool.
Here’s how to use the Polygon tool:
1. Click the Start Using SketchUp button.
2. Select the View, Toolbars, Large Tool Set menu item. This will
open the large vertical toolbar you see on the left in Figure 3.5.
3. Click the Polygon tool in the large toolbar (shown in Figure 3.5).
4. Move the mouse to the location of the center of the polygon you
want to draw and click the mouse.
5. Move the mouse to the edge of the polygon.
The Polygon Tool
FIGURE 3.5 
The large toolset toolbar containing the Polygon tool.

66 LESSON 3: Drawing Shapes: Lines, Rectangles, Polygons, and Circles
6. Click the mouse. SketchUp draws the polygon.
You can see an example in Figure 3.6.
NOTE: Setting the Number of Polygon Sides
By default, the polygon tool draws six-sided polygons, which might
not be what you want—see the task after next to see how to set
the number of sides of the polygons you draw.
TIP: Banishing the Large Toolset Toolbar
If you want to get rid of the large toolset toolbar when you’re done
with it, just select the View, Toolbars, Large Tool Set menu item
again.
Drawing Measured Polygons
Just as you were able with other figures, you can set the size of poly-
gons—which means setting the length of a radius line connecting the
FIGURE 3.6 
Drawing a polygon.

67
Setting the Number of Sides of Circles or Polygons
center of a polygon to a side so that the connecting line is perpendicular to
the side.
Here’s how to set the size of polygons:
1. Click the Start Using SketchUp button.
2. Select the View, Toolbars, Large Tool Set menu item. This will
open the large toolset’s vertical toolbar.
3. Click the Polygon tool in the large toolbar.
4. Move the mouse to the location of the center of the polygon you
want to draw and click the mouse.
5. Move the mouse toward the edge of the new polygon.
6. Enter the radius measurement of the new polygon. You can enter
these units:
. cm to signify centimeters
. m to signify meters
. ' for feet
. " for inches.
For example, to draw a polygon with a radius of 5 meters, enter 5m.
7. Press Enter. SketchUp draws the new polygon with the radius
you’ve requested.
When the polygon has been drawn, it’s a surface, and SketchUp colors it in.
Setting the Number of Sides of
Circles or Polygons
By default, the Polygon tool draws polygons of six sides, and the circle
tool draws “circles” of 24 sides. But you may need a triangle. So how do
you set the number of sides of a figure as you’re drawing it?
Follow these steps to set the number of sides of a circle or polygon:
1. If necessary, select the View, Toolbars, Large Tool Set menu
item.

68 LESSON 3: Drawing Shapes: Lines, Rectangles, Polygons, and Circles
2. Click the Polygon or Circle tool. The mouse cursor will change
to a pencil with a small six-sided polygon or a circle to indicate
you’re using the Polygon or Circle tool.
3. Move the mouse to the location of the center of the polygon or
circle you want to draw and click the mouse.
4. Move the mouse toward the edge of the polygon or circle.
SketchUp draws the polygon or circle as you move the mouse.
5. Type s followed by a number to set the number of sides; for
example, typing s3 will create triangles.
6. Move the mouse to the edge of the polygon or circle. SketchUp
draws the polygon or circle with the number of sides as you
move the mouse.
7. Click the mouse. SketchUp draws the polygon or circle and col-
ors it in as a new surface. You can see an example in Figure 3.7.
FIGURE 3.7 
Drawing a polygon with three sides.

69
Orienting Shapes
Note that you can use this technique with both the Polygon and Circle
tools. The only difference between these two is when you push or pull the
figure into 3D (as explained earlier in the “Drawing Circles” task).
Orienting Shapes
By default, when you draw a shape over another shape, the new shape
takes the same orientation as the old. So, for example, the circle in Figure
3.8 is drawn by SketchUp to align with the rectangle that’s already there.
However, you can set the orientation yourself, defeating SketchUp’s
default orientations. To do that, draw a figure away from any other figure,
using the orientation you want, such as creating a horizontal circle. While
creating the new figure, press and hold the Shift key. Then draw the figure
you want on the surface you want and the figure will retain the orientation
of the figure you drew while you started to hold down the Shift key.
FIGURE 3.8 
A circle aligned with a rectangle.

70 LESSON 3: Drawing Shapes: Lines, Rectangles, Polygons, and Circles
In this way, you can orient figures as you want them, despite the orienta-
tion of the underlying shape, as shown in Figure 3.9, where we’ve drawn a
horizontal circle over the vertical rectangle (we drew the horizontal circle
at right to show SketchUp the orientation we want, and held the Shift key
down as we drew that first horizontal circle to hold the orientation for the
second horizontal circle, drawn over the vertical rectangle).
Getting Information About
Shapes
You can get information about shapes in SketchUp, such as the shape’s
area and number of sides. Just follow these steps:
1. Click the Start Using SketchUp button. Click the human figure
that appears in the Engineering–Feet template by default to select
it and press the Delete key to delete it.
2. Draw a shape.
FIGURE 3.9 
A new circle with a custom alignment.

71
Getting Information About Shapes
3. Right-click the shape and select the Entity Information menu
item. When you do, you get an information box showing infor-
mation about the shape, as shown in Figure 3.10.
4. To get information about the edge of the shape, click the Select
tool in the toolbar while the Information dialog box is open, then
click the edge of the shape. When you do, the information box
changes, showing information about the shape’s edge, as shown
in Figure 3.11.
TIP: Changing a Shape’s Size or Number of Edges
You can edit the information in a shape’s Information box, changing
the shape itself. For example, you can change the number of edges
a polygon has by entering a new number in the Segments box and
pressing Enter.
FIGURE 3.10 
Getting shape information.

Getting information about the edge of a shape.
Saving Your Work
Now that you’ve been creating shapes, it’s time to see how to save your
work:
1. Select the File menu’s Save As menu item. SketchUp opens a
Save As dialog box. Enter the name of the file you want to save
your work in the Filename box. Note that SketchUp files use the
.skp extension.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to save your file. Use
the standard clickable folders that appear in the dialog box.
3. Click the Save button in the dialog box. Your file is saved and the
dialog box disappears.
When you’re working and want to save your work at some point after hav-
ing created a file following the previous steps, select the File menu’s Save
menu item.

LESSON 4
Drawing Shapes: Arcs,
Freehand, Text, and 3D
Text
In this lesson, we cover how to draw arcs, how to draw freehand, and how
to draw text.
Arcs, Freehand, and Text
There’s a lot to see here—particularly with arcs, because they’re a com-
mon edge element you use to draw curves in models. Drawing freehand is
also cool, but a little hard to control because you draw with the mouse.
Finally, we’ll see how to draw text in both 2D and 3D.
Let’s get started with arcs.
Drawing Arcs
Drawing arcs is a three-step process in SketchUp—you click at one anchor
point, click at another, and then pull the arc (SketchUp will bend it as you
pull) into place.
TIP: An Arc Actually Has 12 Sides
Just as circles are made up, by default, of 24 sides in SketchUp
(see Lesson 2, “Up and Running with SketchUp”), arcs are made
up of 12 segments. If you’re drawing a large arc, those sides,
which are really line segments, might be visible. To fix that, you can
set the number of sides in an arc. We’ll see how in the task
“Setting the Number of Arc Segments,” a bit later.

74 
LESSON 4: Drawing Shapes: Arcs, Freehand, Text, and 3D Text
The Arc Tool
FIGURE 4.1 
The Arc tool and a new arc.
Let’s take a look at how to create arcs now.
1. Click the Start Using SketchUp button and click the human fig-
ure that appears in the Engineering–Feet template to select it;
press the Del key to delete it.
2. Click the Arc tool in the toolbar (shown in Figure 4.1).
3. Move the mouse to the start point of the new arc you’re about to
draw and click the mouse. When you do, you anchor an end point
of the arc you’re drawing at that location.
4. Move the mouse to the end point of the new arc you’re drawing
and click the mouse. When you do, a line appears from the first
anchor point to the current location of the mouse.
5. Slide the mouse along the line between the two end points, and
move the mouse to “pull” the line out into an arc. When you do,
an arc appears from the first anchor point to the current location
of the mouse.

75
Drawing Measured Arcs
TIP: Inferring Arcs to Planes
Note that as you stretch your arc, SketchUp will infer it to different
axes or underlying surfaces (that is, draw it in the plane defined by
two axes or an underlying surface). Keep pulling the arc until it
snaps to the plane you want to draw it in, if that becomes an
issue.
6. Click the mouse. The arc becomes permanent (unless you erase
it, of course). You can see an arc in Figure 4.1.
That’s it—you’ve just drawn an arc.
TIP: Drawing Perfect Half Circles
Want to draw a perfect half circle? Just keep pulling an arc until the
ToolTip at the location of the mouse reads Half Circle; then click
the mouse.
Drawing Measured Arcs
Perhaps you want to create an arc a bit more precisely than you can free-
hand. You can specify the radius of any arc; here’s how:
1. Click the Start Using SketchUp button and click the human fig-
ure that appears in the Engineering–Feet template to select it;
press the Del key to delete it.
2. Click the Arc tool in the toolbar (shown in Figure 4.1).
3. Move the mouse to the start point of the new arc you’re about to
draw and click the mouse. When you do, you anchor an end point
of the arc you’re drawing at that location.
4. Move the mouse to the end point of the new arc you’re drawing
and click the mouse. When you do, a line appears from the first
anchor point to the current location of the mouse.
5. Slide the mouse along the line between the two end points, and
move the mouse to “pull” the line out into an arc. When you do,
an arc appears from the first anchor point to the current location
of the mouse.

76 
LESSON 4: Drawing Shapes: Arcs, Freehand, Text, and 3D Text
6. Enter the size of the radius you want (simply stop using the
mouse and type in the radius; no dialog box or text field
appears). You can use the following:
. cm to signify centimeters
. m to signify meters
. ' for feet
. " for inches.
Thus, for example, 5m means five meters, 5" means five inches,
and so on.
7. Press Enter. SketchUp draws the new arc with the radius you’ve
requested.
And there you have it—an arc with a specific radius.
Drawing Arcs Tangent to Corners
Consider the shape in Figure 4.2. Suppose that you want to round the
acute angle in that figure—how would you do it?
FIGURE 4.2 
A shape with an acute angle.

77
Drawing Arcs Tangent to Corners
You could draw an arc so that it was tangent to the two sides, as shown in
Figure 4.3.
Then you could use the Eraser tool to erase the unneeded acute angle, as
shown in Figure 4.4.
That’s it—you’ve rounded the acute angle. Here’s how it works step by step:
1. Click the Start Using SketchUp button and delete the human
figure that appears in Engineering–Feet.
2. Draw the surface similar to the one shown in Figure 4.2 with the
angle you want to round.
3. Click the Arc tool in the toolbar and move the mouse to the start
point of the new arc you’re about to draw. The start point should
be on an edge adjacent to the angle you want to round.
4. Click the mouse. When you do, you anchor an end point of the
arc you’re drawing at that location.
FIGURE 4.3 
The same shape with a tangent arc added.

78 
LESSON 4: Drawing Shapes: Arcs, Freehand, Text, and 3D Text
FIGURE 4.4 
The shape now with a rounded arc.
5. Move the mouse to the end point of the new arc you’re drawing
and click the mouse. When you do, a line appears from the first
anchor point to the current location of the mouse.
6. Slide the mouse along the line between the two end points, and
move the mouse to “pull” the line out into an arc. When you’ve
pulled the arc such so its sides are exactly tangent to the sides
adjacent to the angle you’re rounding, the arc will turn cyan.
That’s your clue that you’ve selected the correct arc.
7. Click the mouse. The arc becomes permanent (unless you erase
it, of course).
8. Click the Eraser tool in the toolbar. The Eraser tool looks just
like, well, an eraser and is a couple tools to the right of the Arc
tool. The mouse cursor changes to a small eraser to indicate
you’re using the Eraser tool.
9. Click the two line segments inside the shape that formed the
acute angle to erase them. This gives you Figure 4.4.

79
Drawing Multiple Tangent Arcs
Rounding acute corners like this is a useful skill when you’re using
SketchUp.
Drawing Multiple Tangent Arcs
What if you wanted to draw a series of multiple arcs, such as those that
appear in Figure 4.5?
The trick is making each new arc tangent to the previous arc so that the
series of arcs appears smooth—and SketchUp can help. Here’s how:
1. Click the Start Using SketchUp button and delete the human
figure that appears in the Engineering–Feet template by default.
2. Click the Arc tool in the toolbar and move the mouse to the start
point of the new arc you’re about to draw.
3. Move the mouse to the start point of the new arc you’re about to
draw and click the mouse. When you do, you anchor an end point
of the arc you’re drawing at the location.
FIGURE 4.5 
Multiple connected arcs.

80 
LESSON 4: Drawing Shapes: Arcs, Freehand, Text, and 3D Text
4. Move the mouse to the end point of the new arc you’re drawing
and click the mouse. When you do, a line appears from the first
anchor point to the current location of the mouse.
5. Slide the mouse along the line between the two end points, and
move the mouse to “pull” the line out into an arc and click the
mouse. The arc becomes permanent (unless you erase it, of
course).
6. Click the end point of the arc you want to continue and move the
mouse away from the end point. As you do, SketchUp will draw
a new arc in blue tangent to the old arc.
7. Move the mouse to the new arc’s end point and click the mouse.
The new arc becomes permanent.
8. Repeat steps 6 and 7 for additional arcs.
That’s it—now you can draw all kinds of fancy spirals.
Setting the Number of Arc
Segments
By default, arcs have twelve sides, but you can change that to any number
of sides you want. Here’s how:
1. Click the Start Using SketchUp button and click the human fig-
ure that appears in the Engineering–Feet template to select it;
press the Del key to delete it.
2. Click the Arc tool in the toolbar (shown previously in Figure 4.1).
3. Move the mouse to the start point of the new arc you’re about to
draw and click the mouse. When you do, you anchor an end point
of the arc you’re drawing at that location.
4. Move the mouse to the end point of the new arc you’re drawing
and click the mouse. When you do, a line appears from the first
anchor point to the current location of the mouse.

81
Setting the Number of Arc Segments
5. Slide the mouse along the line between the two end points, and
move the mouse to “pull” the line out into an arc. When you do,
an arc appears from the first anchor point to the current location
of the mouse.
6. Type the number of sides you want, followed by “s.” For exam-
ple, 5s will give you a five-sided arc.
7. Press Enter. The arc changes to have the number of sides you’ve
requested.
8. Continue pulling the arc into position.
9. Click the mouse. The arc becomes permanent. Figure 4.6 shows a
five-sided arc.
And now you can draw arcs with as many sides as you want.
FIGURE 4.6 
A five-sided arc.

82 
LESSON 4: Drawing Shapes: Arcs, Freehand, Text, and 3D Text
Drawing Freehand
Drawing freehand couldn’t be easier in one sense—you just drag the
mouse; but it also couldn’t be harder in another—if you want to draw fig-
ures with any accuracy, it’s extraordinarily difficult to do so with the
mouse.
NOTE: You’re Not Actually Drawing Freehand
If you were actually drawing entirely freehand, each location of the
mouse would appear as a dot as you moved over it. But because
there are only a limited number of mouse events per second,
SketchUp draws the mouse locations it gets and then connects the
dots with line segments. So if you draw very rapidly, your figures
might end up looking more like interconnected lines.
Here’s how to use the freehand tool:
1. Click the Start Using SketchUp button and click the human fig-
ure that appears in the Engineering–Feet template to select it;
press the Del key to delete it.
2. Select the View, Toolbars, Large Tool Set menu item. This will
open the large toolset toolbar.
3. Click the Freehand tool in the large toolbar (as shown in
Figure 4.7).
4. Move the mouse to the location you want to start drawing from.
5. Press the mouse button and drag the mouse to draw the figure
you want. SketchUp draws the figure following the mouse.
You can see an example in Figure 4.7.
Note that you can’t “fix” a freehand drawing on the pixel level in
SketchUp—the only practical thing is to start over.

83
Drawing Surfaces Freehand
The Freehand Tool
FIGURE 4.7 
Drawing freehand with the Freehand tool.
Drawing Surfaces Freehand
In addition to freehand figures of the kind you see in Figure 4.7, you can
also draw complete surfaces in SketchUp. After you complete a surface,
SketchUp will color it in automatically.
Essentially, you draw freehand figures as detailed in the previous task with
an additional step: Close the figure you’re drawing. When you close the
figure, SketchUp can treat it as a completed surface and fills it in. You can
see a few surfaces drawn freehand in Figure 4.8.
Note that it’s quite difficult to draw accurate surfaces freehand, and that
you usually draw elaborate surfaces as conglomerations of simpler sur-
faces from the toolbar.

84 
LESSON 4: Drawing Shapes: Arcs, Freehand, Text, and 3D Text
FIGURE 4.8 
Drawing surfaces freehand.
Drawing Text
You can also draw text in SketchUp, and sometimes that’s crucial, as when
you might want to label the parts of an architectural drawing. For example,
take a look at Figure 4.9, which shows a cube, and some text, “Cube.”
How did that text get there? Here’s how:
1. Click the Start Using SketchUp button and click the human fig-
ure that appears in the Engineering–Feet template to select it;
press the Del key to delete it.
2. Select the View, Toolbars, Large Tool Set menu item. This will
open the large toolset toolbar.
3. Click the Text tool in the large toolbar. The Text tool is the one
that displays the letters ABC (as shown in Figure 4.9).

85
Drawing Text
The Text Tool
FIGURE 4.9 
The Text tool and some text in a drawing.
4. Move the mouse to the location you want to place your text and
click the mouse. A box with the prompt Enter Text appears at the
location of the mouse for you to enter text in.
5. Enter your text.
6. Click outside the box to make the box’s outline disappear.
It’s important to realize that this text is free-floating; it’s not part of the
model you’re drawing. Thus, for example, if you use the Pan tool to move
the cube, the text doesn’t follow, as you see in Figure 4.10.
So how do you connect text to a model or surface so that it will move and
orbit with that model or surface? Take a look at the next task.

86 
LESSON 4: Drawing Shapes: Arcs, Freehand, Text, and 3D Text
FIGURE 4.10 
Text stays in place as you move the model.
TIP: The Proper Use for Screen Text
A good use for the free-floating screen text displayed by the steps
in this task is to label an entire drawing. Then the drawing label
doesn’t change, no matter how you change the model view.
Annotating Objects with Text
Sometimes, you might want to annotate objects you’re drawing with text,
as shown in Figure 4.11, where we’ve drawn a cube and labeled it.
In contrast to the previous task, where we just added text to the drawing,
this time we’ve annotated an object in the drawing—the cube. Now when
you pan and orbit, the annotation text follows the object, as you can see in
Figure 4.12.

87
Annotating Objects with Text
FIGURE 4.11 
Annotation text for a model.
FIGURE 4.12 
Annotation text follows a model.

88 
LESSON 4: Drawing Shapes: Arcs, Freehand, Text, and 3D Text
So how do you annotate an object and connect text with an arrow pointing
to an object? Just follow these steps:
1. Click the Start Using SketchUp button and click the human fig-
ure that appears in the Engineering–Feet template to select it;
press the Del key to delete it.
2. Select the View, Toolbars, Large Tool Set menu item. This will
open the large toolset toolbar.
3. Click the Text tool in the large toolbar (as shown previously in
Figure 4.9).
4. Press the mouse button on the surface or edge you want to
annotate.
5. Drag the mouse to the location where you want the text to appear
and release the mouse button. A text box appears at the location
at which you released the mouse button.
By default, the area of a surface will appear as the text in the text
box if you’re annotating a surface, and the length of an edge if
you’re annotating an edge.
6. Enter your text.
7. Click outside the box to make the box’s outline disappear.
Now you’re able to annotate objects in your drawings.
Setting Text Properties
What if you wanted to display your annotation text in a large, italic font,
as shown in Figure 4.13?
Just follow these steps to customize your text:
1. Click the Select tool. The mouse cursor will change to an arrow.
2. Right-click the text whose properties you want to change. A con-
text menu appears.

89
Setting Text Properties
FIGURE 4.13 
Annotating in large italic text.
3. Select the Entity Info menu item. SketchUp displays a dialog
box labeled Entity Info.
4. Click the Change Font button in the Entity Info dialog box. The
Font dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 4.14.
FIGURE 4.14 
Setting text properties.

90 
LESSON 4: Drawing Shapes: Arcs, Freehand, Text, and 3D Text
5. Select the Font, Font Style, and Size you want for the text in the
Font dialog box.
6. Click the OK button to close the Font dialog box.
7. Click the X button at the upper right to close the Entity Info dia-
log box. SketchUp adjusts the text as you’ve requested.
These steps let you change the font of one selection of text. But what if
you have a dozen text items all around the screen?
You can change all the text in your drawing at once if you select Model
Info from the Window menu. The dialog box you see in Figure 4.15
appears.
Select the Text item in the left pane. To set the properties of free-floating
screen text, click the Select All Screen Text button, and then click the
Font button above it to display the Font dialog box, which will let you set
the text properties for all screen text.
FIGURE 4.15

91
Drawing 3D Text
To set the text properties of the text used for annotation, click the Select
All Leader Text button and then click the Font button above it to display
the Font dialog box. You can then set the text properties for all annotation
text.
TIP: Setting Arrows for Text
In the Entity Info box, you can also change the text displayed, as
well as the style of arrow used to connect the text to the surface or
edge.
Drawing 3D Text
SketchUp also lets you draw 3D text with the 3D text tool. For example,
take a look at the 3D text that appears in Figure 4.16.
The 3D Text Tool
FIGURE 4.16 
Using the 3D text tool.

92 
LESSON 4: Drawing Shapes: Arcs, Freehand, Text, and 3D Text
It’s important to note that 3D text is treated as a shape, unlike 2D text. 3D
text becomes part of the model, whereas standard 2D screen text does not.
And even while annotated text becomes part of the model, it’s only there
to tag parts of the model, not become part of it. The text in Figure 4.16 is
part of the model and appears as a structural element in the model.
So, whereas 2D text is used for labeling, 3D text becomes a structural ele-
ment in the model itself.
TIP: Making 2D Text Part of the Model
Want to make 2D text part of the model? Just use 3D text, setting
the text “extrusion” (see step 6) to zero.
Here’s how to draw in 3D:
1. Click the Start Using SketchUp button and click the human fig-
ure that appears in the Engineering–Feet template to select it;
press the Del key to delete it.
2. Select the View, Toolbars, Large Tool Set menu item. This
opens the large toolset toolbar.
3. Click the 3D Text tool in the large toolbar (shown in Figure
4.16). The dialog box, labeled Place 3D Text, appears, as you see
in Figure 4.17.
FIGURE 4.17 
Customizing 3D text.

93
Drawing 3D Text
4. Enter the text you want to make 3D in the large text box.
5. Select the Font, Alignment, Text style (Regular or Bold), and
whether you want the characters to appear filled in.
6. Enter the height of the characters you want (using ' for feet, " for
inches, m for meters, or cm for centimeters) in the Height box
and the 3D depth you want to give to the characters in the
Extruded box.
7. Click the Place button. The dialog box disappears, and the text
appears as a model element that is selected and that moves as the
mouse moves.
8. Move the mouse to move the text and then click the mouse to
place the text in the model. The text will align to any axis or sur-
face, just as any other model element.
That’s it—you can now add 3D text to models using the 3D Text tool.

LESSON 5
Going 3D
In this lesson, we’re going to see what SketchUp is really all about—
going 3D.
Getting Started
SketchUp’s 3D capabilities are what set it apart from the rest of the pack
of drawing tools. You’re going to see how easy it is to create 3D models in
SketchUp. Although you might think that you need to draw every edge to
make a model 3D, that’s not true—SketchUp operates in a very clever way
to give you 3D power.
All you need to do is to draw a 2D surface (and remember, such surfaces
can be aligned to any plane). Then you use one of SketchUp’s 3D tools,
such as the Push/Pull tool, to pull it into 3D. Thus a rectangle becomes a
cube, for example.
The Push/Pull tool, which works on any surface that’s in one plane, is the
primary 3D tool in SketchUp. This tool lets you push or pull surfaces into
3D in a way that’s quite impressive. But other tools in SketchUp have 3D
power as well, such as the Move tool, which we’ll also see here.
You can use the Move tool to move objects around, of course. But when
you first use the Select tool to select an edge, you can use the Move tool to
pull out that edge in such a way that the connected surface follows, while
still being anchored on the opposite edge (think of opening a cabinet
door).
We’ll see both the Push/Pull and Move tools in this lesson, along with
some auxiliary tools, the Select tool and the Eraser tool.

96 
LESSON 5: Going 3D
FIGURE 5.1 
A rectangle.
This is a big lesson for us, because it’s all about 3D, and that’s also what
SketchUp is all about—3D.
Let’s get started immediately with the Push/Pull tool.
Pulling Objects into 3D
You need to start with a basic shape or surface. For this task we’ll keep
things simple and use a rectangle. (Refer to Lesson 3, “Drawing Shapes:
Lines, Rectangles, Polygons, and Circles” for more.)
Use the Rectangle tool to create a rectangle similar to what you see in
Figure 5.1.
Now, what you really want is a cube, so to transform the rectangle, we’ll
use the Push/Pull tool, as shown in Figure 5.2.

97
Pulling Objects into 3D
The Push/Pull Tool
FIGURE 5.2 
The Push/Pull tool and the resulting cube.
When you use the Push/Pull tool (shown in Figure 5.2), you literally pull
the rectangle into a 3D shape. This tool is at the center of what SketchUp
does for you, so it’s an important one to learn.
Here’s how to go 3D with SketchUp and the Push/Pull tool:
1. Click the Start Using SketchUp button and click the human fig-
ure that appears in the Engineering–Feet template to select it;
press the Del key to delete it.
2. Draw a shape.
3. Click the Push/Pull tool in the toolbar (shown in Figure 5.2).
4. Move the mouse cursor to the surface you want to pull or push
into 3D. Note that the surface must be flat.
5. Press the mouse button on the surface and drag the surface in the
direction you want to extend it into 3D.

98 
LESSON 5: Going 3D
TIP: Pushing or Pulling Surfaces
Note that you can only push or pull surfaces perpendicular to 
themselves.
As you drag the mouse, the surface pulls into 3D. The sides of
the new 3D shape are defined by the edges of the 2D shape.
6. Release the mouse button. The object becomes 3D, as you can
see in Figure 5.2. As you can see, pulling shapes into 3D is one
the coolest features in SketchUp.
Pushing Objects into 3D
In the previous task, you saw that you could pull a free-standing rectangle
into 3D. But now take a look at Figure 5.3.
Can you pull the attached circle into a cylinder? Yes, you can. In fact, now
you have two options. Because the circle is attached to an existing 3D 
FIGURE 5.3 
A cube with an attached circle.

99
Pushing Objects into 3D
surface, you have the option of not only pulling the circle out of the cube,
but you can also push the cylinder into the cube.
Here’s how:
1. Click the Start Using SketchUp button and click the human fig-
ure that appears in the Engineering–Feet template to select it;
press the Del key to delete it.
2. Draw the cube as shown in Figure 5.3.
3. Draw a circle on the cube using the Circle tool, as shown in
Figure 5.3.
4. Click the Push/Pull tool in the toolbar.
5. Move the mouse cursor to the circle and press the mouse button
on the circle.
6. Drag the circle out of the cube to pull it into 3D, or push it into
the cube to push it into 3D. You can see the circle pulled into 3D
in Figure 5.4 and pushed into the cube in Figure 5.5.
FIGURE 5.4 
Pulling a circle into a cylinder.

100 
LESSON 5: Going 3D
7. Release the mouse button. The cylinder becomes 3D.
Now you can both pull and push objects into 3D.
Using Measured Push/Pull
What if you wanted to push or pull an object exactly 5 feet when making it
3D? That is, suppose you have a circle on one surface of a cube (refer to
Figure 5.3), and you want to pull the circle out into a cylinder exactly 5
feet—could you do it?
Yes. Like most SketchUp operations, you can interrupt them midway and
enter a measurement. Here’s how it works when you’re pushing or
pulling objects into 3D—in this example, we’ll pull a cylinder out of a
cube by 5 feet:
1. Click the Start Using SketchUp button and click the human fig-
ure that appears in the Engineering–Feet template to select it;
press the Del key to delete it.
FIGURE 5.5 
Pushing a cylinder into a cube.

101
Inferring Push/Pull
2. Draw the cube with a circle on one surface.
3. Click the Push/Pull tool in the toolbar.
4. Move the mouse cursor to the circle and press the mouse button
on the circle.
5. Drag the circle out of the cube to pull it into 3D, or push it into
the cube to push it into 3D.
6. Release the mouse button. The cylinder becomes 3D.
7. Enter the length of the 3D object you want. In this example,
we’ll create a 5-foot cylinder. Enter a length and then the units—
you can use these units:
. cm to signify centimeters
. m to signify meters
. ' for feet
. " for inches
Thus, 5m means five meters, 5" means five inches, and so on. In
this example, we’ll use 5 feet, 5', giving you the cylinder you see
in Figure 5.6.
8. Press Enter. SketchUp changes the new 3D object’s length to
match what you’ve requested.
Note that when you release the mouse button the first time, it feels as
though you’ve finished drawing the cylinder, but SketchUp remembers that
the cylinder is still being drawn, and if you enter a length and press Enter,
it’ll apply that length to the most recent figure, which in this example is
the cylinder.
Inferring Push/Pull
Suppose you wanted to draw two cubes to the same height, similar to what
you can see in Figure 5.7, but are not satisfied with your first effort.
Can SketchUp help make the two cubes the same height?

102 
LESSON 5: Going 3D
FIGURE 5.6 
A measured cylinder.
FIGURE 5.7 
Two cubes.

103
Cutting Openings
Yes, it can—through inferring. Because it’s so common when creating models
to want one object to match another in some dimension (think of the length of
table legs, for example), SketchUp allows you to set an object’s length by
referring to another object that already has the length you want. This process is
called inferring (See Lesson 2, “Up and Running with SketchUp”).
When drawing 3D objects, you can infer the length on one object to anoth-
er object, making the first object’s length match the second object. Here’s
how it works in the example of the two cubes in Figure 5.7:
1. Click the Start Using SketchUp button and click the human fig-
ure that appears in the Engineering–Feet template to select it;
press the Del key to delete it.
2. Draw two rectangles in the x-y plane.
3. Click the Push/Pull tool in the toolbar.
4. Pull the rectangles into cubes of different heights, as shown in
Figure 5.7.
5. With the Push/Pull tool, click the top surface of one of the cubes.
6. Move the mouse to the top surface of the other cube. A dotted
blue line extends from the first surface to the surface you’re
inferring, as shown in Figure 5.8, and the first cube (the one you
clicked first) snaps to the height of the second cube (the one
you’re inferring to), as you can see in the figure.
7. Click the top surface of the second cube. The height of the first
cube becomes frozen to match the height of the second cube.
Inferring provides an easy way to make the length of objects match in
SketchUp.
Cutting Openings
Another cool feature that you will want to take advantage of in SketchUp is
using the Push/Pull tool to “cut” or create the illusion of openings in shapes.
Suppose you’ve just drawn a rectangle that represents a wall. For example,
see the wall in Figure 5.9.

104 
LESSON 5: Going 3D
FIGURE 5.8 
Making the cubes equal height.
FIGURE 5.9 
A 3D wall.

105
Cutting Openings
Now say that you want to cut a window into that wall. How could you do it?
The Push/Pull tool has a special property—you can cut objects right out of
existing 3D objects. Here’s how it works:
1. Click the Start Using SketchUp button and click the human fig-
ure that appears in the Engineering–Feet template to select it;
press the Del key to delete it.
2. Draw the 3D wall, such as the one you see in Figure 5.9.
3. Draw the 2D outline of the window you want to cut into the wall.
You might use a rectangle, as shown in Figure 5.10.
4. Click the Push/Pull tool in the toolbar.
5. Push the window outline through the wall to the other side. The
part you’ve pushed disappears, leaving a cutout, as you can see in
Figure 5.11.
FIGURE 5.10 
A 3D wall with a rectangle.

106 
LESSON 5: Going 3D
So that’s the trick—to create a cutout, push a shape through a 3D object
until the shape disappears. Very cool.
Erasing Edges with the Eraser Tool
You can use the Eraser tool to erase edges, and that can help when you’re
going 3D. For example, take a look at the block in Figure 5.12.
Suppose you wanted to push the rectangle you see on the block through to
create an opening, but SketchUp won’t let you cut out the opening. What’s
wrong? And, how can you fix it?
For this task we will use the Orbit tool (refer to Lesson 2) and the Eraser
tool (introduced in Lesson 4, “Drawing Shapes: Arcs, Freehand, Text, and
3D Text”). Follow these steps to solve the most common problem when
cutting openings:
1. Click the Orbit tool in the toolbar.
2. Orbit around the entire 3D object you’re trying to push an open-
ing through.
FIGURE 5.11 
A 3D wall with a window.

107
Erasing Edges with the Eraser Tool
FIGURE 5.12 
A 3D block with rectangle.
3. Search for obstructing edges—SketchUp won’t push openings
through edges. In the case of the object in Figure 5.12, it turns
out that there’s an edge drawn across the back of the object, as
you can see in Figure 5.13. This edge will stop SketchUp from
pushing an opening through the object.
4. To get rid of unwanted edges, select the Eraser tool in the toolbar.
TIP: The Eraser Tool Is Only to Erase Edges
In SketchUp, you use the Eraser tool only to erase edges. But if
you want to get rid of a surface, it’s easy—just erase all its edges.
5. Click the unwanted edge. When you do, that edge disappears.
6. Push the rectangle through the object to the other side with the
Push/Pull tool. The part you’ve pushed disappears, leaving a
cutout, as you can see in Figure 5.14.
So that’s the way you use the Eraser tool—to erase unwanted edges. And
if you want to get rid of a surface, erase its edges.

108 
LESSON 5: Going 3D

109
Selecting Edges and Surfaces with the Select Tool
Selecting Edges and Surfaces
with the Select Tool
Now that you’ve mastered drawing surfaces and are working with 3D
objects, it’s time to see how to select edges, surfaces, and objects using the
Select tool.
Knowing how to select edges, surfaces, and objects is important for many
actions in SketchUp, because you often have to indicate to SketchUp just
what item you’re working with. For example, when you want to make a
copy of an object, you start by selecting that object. Selecting an object
brings it to SketchUp’s attention by telling it just what item you’re work-
ing with. When you want to use the Move tool to pull out an edge from an
object into 3D, you start by selecting that edge.
When you select an object, SketchUp indicates your selection by drawing
it in a slightly different color than it was before, or by making it appear
dotted. After you’ve selected an item, you can use that item as the target of
your following operations, as we’ll see. For example, if you had three
boxes and wanted to make copies of only one, you’d start by selecting the
box you want to make copies of, and then the appropriate menu choices to
copy the item, as we’re going to see in this lesson.
Selecting surfaces and edges is easy. Just click the Select tool in the
Getting Started toolbar (recall the Select tool has an arrow as its icon, and
is the first tool on the left in the Getting Started toolbar), and click the sur-
face or edge you want to select.
When you select a surface, SketchUp fills the surface with blue dots.
When you select an edge, SketchUp colors it blue.
Selecting an entire object is also easy, because the Select tool lets you
draw selection rectangles automatically. Just press the mouse button out-
side the object and drag the mouse over the object to draw a selection rec-
tangle, as you see in Figure 5.15.
When you release the mouse button, the entire object will be selected (and
you can use menu selections to copy it, move it, and so on), which means
all its surfaces will be dotted in blue, and its edges will be drawn in blue.

110 
LESSON 5: Going 3D
FIGURE 5.15 
Drawing a selection rectangle.
Now we know how to select edges, surfaces, and objects. Let’s start
putting that knowledge to work in the next task.
Copying Objects
You’ll often want to copy elements in SketchUp. For example, we’re going
to construct a table later on in this lesson by creating one table leg and
then making a few copies for the other legs. Copying objects guarantees
you exact duplicates when having an exact duplicate is important—as
when you’re making actual table legs.
Being able to copy objects is an essential skill in SketchUp, so here’s how
you do it. In this case, we’ll make a copy of a simple cube:
1. Click the Start Using SketchUp button and click the human fig-
ure that appears in the Engineering–Feet template to select it;
press the Del key to delete it.
2. Draw a horizontal rectangle.

111
Copying Objects
3. Click the Push/Pull tool in the toolbar.
4. Move the mouse cursor to the rectangle and press the mouse but-
ton on the rectangle.
5. Press the mouse button on the rectangle and drag the rectangle up
to extend it into a 3D cube, as shown in Figure 5.16.
6. Click the Select tool in the toolbar.
7. Select the cube by pressing the mouse button outside it and drag-
ging the selection rectangle that appears over the cube. Now
you’ve selected the object you want to copy.
8. Select the Edit menu’s Copy item.
9. Select the Edit menu’s Paste item. When you do, a copy of the
object appears at the location of the mouse cursor. Moving the
mouse cursor moves the copy of the object.
FIGURE 5.16 
Drawing a cube.

112 
LESSON 5: Going 3D
10. Move the mouse cursor to the location at which you want to
place the copy of the object.
11. Click the mouse. The copy of the object appears at the location
you clicked the mouse and stops moving around with the mouse
cursor. You can see an example in Figure 5.17, where we’ve
copied the cube.
That’s it—now you can copy objects.
Moving Edges and Surfaces with
the Move Tool
You can use the Move tool to pull edges into 3D. Take a look at the cube
in Figure 5.18.
FIGURE 5.17 
Copying a cube.

113
Moving Edges and Surfaces with the Move Tool
That’s fine—but what if you wanted to draw a ramp instead, such as the
one you see in Figure 5.19?
You can easily convert the cube in Figure 5.18 to the ramp in Figure 5.19
using the Move tool, which you can use to grasp edges and pull them into
3D (the Push/Pull tool lets you only push or pull surfaces).
Here’s how it works—in this example, we’ll convert a cube to a ramp.
1. Click the Start Using SketchUp button and click the human fig-
ure that appears in the Engineering–Feet template to select it;
press the Del key to delete it.
2. Draw a horizontal rectangle.
3. Click the Push/Pull tool in the toolbar and move the mouse cur-
sor to the rectangle.
4. Press the mouse button on the rectangle and drag the rectangle up
to extend it into a 3D cube, as shown in Figure 5.18.
FIGURE 5.18 
A cube.

114 
LESSON 5: Going 3D
The Move Tool
FIGURE 5.19 
A ramp created by using the Move tool.
5. Select the Move tool in the toolbar (as shown in Figure 5.19).
6. Press the mouse button on the lower-right edge of the cube.
7. Drag the edge away from the cube to form the ramp. As you
drag, the ramp extends from the cube.
8. Click the mouse at the location you want for the end of the ramp.
When you do, the ramp becomes permanent (unless you erase it),
as shown in Figure 5.19.
That’s how the Move tool works in 3D. Using this tool, you can drag
edges, not surfaces, into 3D, as in the case of making a ramp from a cube.
As its name implies, you can also use the Move tool to move individual
objects around. Simply use the Select tool to select the object, and then
move the object into place with the Move tool.

115
Drawing 3D by Subtracting Elements
Drawing 3D by Subtracting
Elements
You often draw 3D objects by subtracting elements. To show how this
works, we’ll draw a table like the one you see in Figure 5.20.
How was that table created? Here’s how:
1. Click the Start Using SketchUp button and click the human fig-
ure that appears in the Engineering–Feet template to select it;
press the Del key to delete it.
2. Draw a horizontal rectangle.
3. Click the Push/Pull tool in the toolbar and move the mouse cur-
sor to the rectangle.
4. Press the mouse button on the rectangle and drag the rectangle up
to extend it into a 3D cube.
FIGURE 5.20 
A 3D table.

116 
LESSON 5: Going 3D
5. Select the Rectangle tool in the toolbar.
6. Draw a rectangle on the cube as shown in Figure 5.21.
7. Select the Push/Pull tool in the toolbar.
8. Push the rectangle through the cube until you get a cutout in the
shape of the rectangle.
9. Select the Rectangle tool in the toolbar.
10. Draw a rectangle on a cube surface adjacent to the first surface
where you drew a rectangle. Draw the rectangle so that pushing it
through will give you two of the table’s legs.
11. Select the Push/Pull tool in the toolbar.
12. Push the rectangle through until you get a cutout in the shape
of the rectangle. You can see what the result will look like in
Figure 5.22.
FIGURE 5.21 
Adding a rectangle to a cube.

117
Drawing 3D by Subtracting Elements
13. Select the Rectangle tool in the toolbar.
14. Draw a rectangle on the remaining vertical cube surface. Draw
the rectangle so that pushing it through will give you the final
two table legs.
15. Select the Push/Pull tool in the toolbar.
16. Push the rectangle through until you get a cutout in the shape of
the rectangle. That creates the table in Figure 5.20.
And that’s one technique for drawing 3D—by subtracting elements.
TIP: Making the Table Legs Identical
If you want to make sure the table legs are identical in all dimen-
sions, you can use inferring. Select the Move tool, hover over the
surface of a leg, then click another leg’s corresponding surface to
snap to the corresponding measurement.
FIGURE 5.22

LESSON 6
Creating Components
and Groups
In this lesson, we’re going to take the shapes we’ve been drawing in the
previous lessons and start assembling them into groups and components to
let us handle them all together.
Getting Started
For example, suppose that you’ve been drawing a car with all the surfaces
you need for that. But then you find when you want to move or copy and
rotate or even enlarge the model, you have to select all the surfaces indi-
vidually to handle them all together.
Wouldn’t it be easier to have SketchUp understand that it’s supposed to
treat all the surfaces of the car as a collection, handling all actions on all
surfaces in the collection at once?
That’s what groups and components are all about, and you’ll find yourself
using both of these as you progress in SketchUp. When you take shapes
and/or objects and collect them into a group or component, you can then
handle the collection of shapes as one object, copying it all at once, or
moving, rotating it, and so on.
Many of the tools in SketchUp behave differently when you’re working
with a group or component than when you’re just working with a
Engineering–Feet shape, so we’ll also discuss how that works in this lesson.

120 
LESSON 6: Creating Components and Groups
NOTE: What’s the Difference Between Groups and
Components?
It has to do with the fact that when you edit one component, all
copies of the component are edited as well, but that’s not true of
groups.
Let’s get started immediately by seeing how SketchUp handles multiple
objects by default.
Using Sticky Geometry
We’ll start this lesson with a discussion of the rudimentary way that
SketchUp handles collections of objects by default—using a system called
sticky geometry.
NOTE: On the Use of Tools
It’s assumed in these tasks that you have been progressing
through each lesson in order and learning about the individual tools
referenced here. If you need to flip back for review, check out
Lesson 3, “Drawing Shapes: Lines, Rectangles, Polygons, and
Circles,” for more on the Rectangle and Circle tools. And see
Lesson 5, “Going 3D,” for refreshers on the Push/Pull and Move
tools.
When you bring two objects next to each other, they can “adhere” and
become one object. It’s sort of a rudimentary form of creating groups in
SketchUp. Because sticky geometry is part of SketchUp, and because it’s
all about connecting objects into one (the topic of this lesson), we’ll take a
look at sticky geometry here.
To get an idea of how sticky geometry works, follow these steps:
1. Start SketchUp. For this task, we’ll work with the
Engineering–Feet template we’ve used in the previous lessons.

121
Creating a Group
2. Click the Start Using SketchUp button.
3. Select the Rectangle tool.
4. Draw a horizontal rectangle.
5. Select the Push/Pull tool in the toolbar.
6. Pull the rectangle up into a cube.
7. Create a second cube, just as you did with the first cube.
8. Select the Select tool in the toolbar.
9. Draw a selection rectangle around the second cube.
10. Select the Move tool in the toolbar.
11. Move the cube until one surface touches a surface of the first cube.
12. Select the Select tool in the toolbar.
13. Draw a selection rectangle around the second cube.
14. Select the Move tool in the toolbar.
15. Move the second cube. If SketchUp has connected the cubes
automatically through sticky geometry, you’ll find that moving
the second cube also pulls the first, as you see in Figure 6.1.
That’s sticky geometry—it lets you connect objects by just putting them
next to each other.
On the other hand, sticky geometry might not be right for you, because
you might want a more systematic way of creating groups and compo-
nents. For that reason, take a look at the following tasks.
Creating a Group
In this task, we’ll take a look at the process of creating a group. When you
create a group, you associate objects together, and tell SketchUp you want
them all handled together. You can move them together, rotate them
together, enlarge or reduce them together, and so on.

122 
LESSON 6: Creating Components and Groups
These objects are now grouped; if you grab and
move either, both move at the same time
FIGURE 6.1 
Two cubes attached with sticky geometry.
Here we’ll create a group from a cube and a cylinder. Here’s how it works:
1. Click the Start Using SketchUp button and click the human fig-
ure that appears in the Engineering–Feet template to select it;
press the Del key to delete it.
2. Select the Rectangle tool and draw a horizontal rectangle.
3. Select the Push/Pull tool in the toolbar and then pull the rectan-
gle up into a cube.
4. Select the Circle tool and draw a circle next to the cube, as
shown in Figure 6.2.
5. Select the Push/Pull tool in the toolbar, and then pull the circle
into a cylinder, as shown in Figure 6.3.

123
Creating a Group
FIGURE 6.2 
A cube with a circle.
6. Select the Select tool, and then, while holding down the left
mouse button, draw a selection rectangle around both the cube
and the cylinder.
7. Select the Edit menu’s Make Group menu item. This creates a
group of the cube and cylinder and selects that group, displaying
it in a blue box, as shown in Figure 6.4.
NOTE: Groups and Blue Boxes
Groups aren’t normally displayed with a blue box around them—the
blue box appears only to indicate that the group is selected.
To prove this group functions now as a single unit, we’ll move it around
the screen.
1. Select the Move tool in the toolbar.

124 
LESSON 6: Creating Components and Groups

A new group.

125
Creating Components
2. Move the group to a new position, as shown in Figure 6.5.
3. When you move the group, both objects that make up the group
move in unison, treated as a single object.
So now you’ve been able to group objects together and treat them as a
group.
Creating Components
In this task, we’ll create a component from the same two objects we saw
in the previous task—a cube and a cylinder.
Here’s how it works:
1. Click the Start Using SketchUp button and click the human fig-
ure that appears in the Engineering–Feet template to select it;
press the Del key to delete it.
FIGURE 6.5 
Moving the group.

126 
LESSON 6: Creating Components and Groups
2. Select the Rectangle tool and draw a horizontal rectangle.
3. Select the Push/Pull tool in the toolbar, and then pull the rectan-
gle up into a cube.
4. Select the Circle tool and draw a circle next to the cube.
5. Select the Push/Pull tool in the toolbar, and then pull the circle
into a cylinder.
6. Select the Select tool, and then draw a selection rectangle around
both the cube and the cylinder.
7. Select the Edit menu’s Make Component menu item. SketchUp
displays the dialog box you see in Figure 6.6.
8. Enter Cube Cylinder Component in the Name box.
9. Enter A cube with a cylinder in the Description box.
10. Click the Create button. The dialog box disappears and a blue
selection box surrounds your new component, exactly as with the
group in the previous task (refer to Figure 6.4).
To prove this component functions now as a single unit, we’ll move it
around the screen.
FIGURE 6.6 
The Create Component dialog box.

127
Editing Components
1. Select the Move tool in the toolbar.
2. Move the component to a new position, as shown in Figure 6.7.
3. When you move the component, both objects that make up the
component move in unison, treated as a single unit.
Now you’ve created your first component. In the previous topic, you creat-
ed your first group. What’s the difference? See the next task.
Editing Components
You can also edit the various parts of a component in SketchUp.
In this task, we’ll create a component from the same two objects we saw
in the previous task—a cube and a cylinder.
FIGURE 6.7 
Moving the component.

128 
LESSON 6: Creating Components and Groups
Here’s how it works:
1. Right-click the Cube and Cylinder component we created in
the previous task.
2. Select the Edit Component menu item. This will surround the
component with a dotted box, as shown in Figure 6.8.
3. Select the Push/Pull tool in the toolbar.
4. Hover over the top surface of the rectangle for two seconds.
5. Click the top surface of the cylinder to pull the cube up to match
the cylinder in height, as you see in Figure 6.9. This is sizing the
cube by inference.
6. Select the Select tool in the toolbar.
7. Click any blank, nonselected region of the screen to stop editing
the component. The dotted box around the component disappears.
FIGURE 6.8 
A component open for editing.

129
Understanding the Difference Between Groups and Components
FIGURE 6.9 
An edited component.
That’s it—now you know how to edit the individual objects in a component.
Understanding the Difference
Between Groups and Components
Now you’ve seen groups and components. What’s the difference?
The difference is that components are instanced. That’s a SketchUp term
meaning that all copies of a component act as instances of—or are tied
to—the original. Thus, if you make a copy of a component and edit it,
both the copy and the original will be affected, which is not true for
groups.
When you make a copy of a group, the copy is totally independent of the
original. That means that if you edit a group, no copies of the group will
be affected.

130 
LESSON 6: Creating Components and Groups
Let’s take a look at how components work when you edit one of a set of
the same component:
1. Start SketchUp.
2. Click the Start Using SketchUp button. This will open
SketchUp.
3. Select the Select tool in the toolbar.
4. Click the Cube and Cylinder component that we have created
in this lesson. This selects the component, surrounding it with a
blue box.
Now we’ll make a copy of the component.
5. Select the Edit menu’s Copy item.
6. Select the Edit menu’s Paste item.
7. Move the mouse to the location at which you want to place the
copy of the component.
8. Click the mouse to create a copy of the component. Now you
have an original and a copy of the component on the screen.
9. Right-click one of the Cube and Cylinder components.
10. Select the Edit Component menu item. This will surround the
component with a dotted box, as shown in Figure 6.10.
11. Select the Push/Pull tool in the toolbar.
12. Pull the cylinder up to a greater height. As you pull the cylinder
in one component, the cylinder in the other component changes
to match, as shown in Figure 6.11.
13. Select the Select tool in the toolbar.
14. Click any blank, nonselected region of the screen to stop editing
the component. The dotted box around the component disappears.
There you have it—when you edit one object in a component, that same
change is made to the corresponding object in all copies of the component
(which doesn’t happen when you make copies of groups).

LESSON 6: Creating Components and Groups
Exploding a Component
Having created a component, can you de-create it? That is, can you
“explode” the objects in the component so that they no longer make up a
component?
Yes, you can. Just follow these steps to create a component and then
explode it back into its parts:
1. Click the Start Using SketchUp button and click the human fig-
ure that appears in the Engineering–Feet template to select it;
press the Del key to delete it.
2. Select the Rectangle tool and draw a horizontal rectangle.
3. Select the Push/Pull tool in the toolbar, and then pull the rectan-
gle up into a cube.
4. Select the Circle tool and draw a circle next to the cube.
5. Select the Push/Pull tool in the toolbar, and then pull the circle
into a cylinder.
6. Select the Select tool, and then draw a selection rectangle around
both the cube and the cylinder.
7. Select the Edit menu’s Make Component item. SketchUp dis-
plays a dialog box.
8. Enter Two Cubes Component in the Name box.
9. Enter Two cubes in the Description box.
10. Click the Create button. The dialog box disappears.
A blue selection box surrounds your new component—you’ve
created your component.
The next step is to explode it back into two separate cubes.
11. While your component is selected (has a blue box around it),
right-click the component. A context menu appears.
12. Select Explode from the context menu. The blue selection box
around the component disappears, and the two cubes are no
longer one component.

133
Managing Components
To verify that the two cubes are separate, click them individually,
noting that no blue box appears—instead, first one cube then the
other is filled with blue dots, as happens when you select individ-
ual objects.
Now you know how to create and “uncreate” components.
Managing Components
SketchUp includes a utility to manage your components, and we’ll take a
look at it in this task.
Here’s how it works:
1. Start SketchUp. For this task, we’ll work with the
Engineering–Feet template we’ve used in the previous tasks.
2. Click the Start Using SketchUp button.
3. Select the Window menu’s Components item. This will open the
Components dialog box you see in Figure 6.12. (I’ve used the
mouse to enlarge the Components dialog, dragging one corner, to
make what’s going on in the dialog box clearer.)
FIGURE 6.12 
The Component dialog box.

134 
LESSON 6: Creating Components and Groups
4. To see the components you have in the current model, click the
down arrow next to the house button, and select the In Model
item. This will display the page you see in Figure 6.13.
Because the only component in the model currently is the human
figure that SketchUp shows on startup, that’s the only component
(named Susan in SketchUp 8) that appears in the dialog box
when you ask to see all the components in the current model.
5. To insert an instance of a component into your model, click that
component. Doing so makes the component instance appear at
the location of the mouse cursor.
6. To place the component instance in your model, just move the
mouse to the location at which you want the component to
appear, and click it. The component becomes anchored to the
location of the mouse click.
That’s it—that’s one way to manage your components. Take a look at the
next task for another.
FIGURE 6.13 
The current component in the model.

135
Using the Component Sampler
Using the Component Sampler
SketchUp also has a “Sampler” of prebuilt components available for you
to use. Here’s how it works:
1. Start SketchUp. For this task, we’ll work with the
Engineering–Feet template we’ve used in the previous tasks.
2. Click the Start Using SketchUp button.
3. Select the Window menu’s Components item. This will open the
Components dialog box.
By default, you should see the Component Sampler. Click it to
open it, as shown in Figure 6.14. (If you don’t see the Components
Sampler, click the down arrow next to the house icon to select it.)
4. Scroll up and down the Component Sampler to get an idea of
what’s available.
5. To insert an instance of a component into your model, click that
component. Doing so makes the component instance appear at
the location of the mouse cursor.
FIGURE 6.14 
The Component dialog showing the Component Sampler.

136 
LESSON 6: Creating Components and Groups
6. To place the component instance in your model, move the mouse
to the location at which you want the component to appear, and
click it. The component becomes anchored to the location of the
mouse click.
Using the 3D Warehouse
SketchUp also has available a “warehouse” of components that you can
use and download.
Let’s assume you want to draw a couch. Here’s how it works:
1. Click the Start Using SketchUp button.
2. Select the Window menu’s Components item. This opens the
Components dialog box. By default, you should see the
Component Sampler.
3. Click the down arrow next to the house button. This will display
a drop-down menu of component collections.
The choices for the Component collections are
. Architecture
. Landscape
. Construction
. People
. Playground
. Transportation
For this task, we’ll choose the Architecture collections.
4. Select the Architecture menu item. This will display a dialog
box, as you see in Figure 6.15, of component collections avail-
able in Google’s 3D Warehouse.
5. Select the Furniture item. This displays the items in the
Furniture collection of Google’s 3D warehouse, as shown in
Figure 6.16.

137
Using the 3D Warehouse
FIGURE 6.15 
The Architecture component collections.
6. Click the Seating item. This downloads the Seating collection
from the 3D warehouse, as shown in Figure 6.17.
FIGURE 6.16 
The Furniture component collections.

138 
LESSON 6: Creating Components and Groups
7. Click the Couch Rounded item. Doing so makes the component
instance appear at the location of the mouse cursor.
8. To place the component instance in your model, move the mouse
to the location at which you want the component to appear, and
click it. The component becomes anchored to the location of the
mouse click, as shown in Figure 6.18.
There are dozens of components ready for you to download and use from
the 3D warehouse—give it a try.

LESSON 7
Painting Your Objects
So far, we’ve been drawing objects using the SketchUp default shading,
but that’s probably not what you have in mind to color your own objects.
You can also paint your objects.
Painting
For example, take a look at Figure 7.1, where you can see a cube of wood.
Or is it? It certainly doesn’t look like a cube of wood. Now take a look at
Figure 7.2, where we’ve used the Paint tool (the tool with the paint buck-
et icon) and painted the block with a wood texture—if you can see the
FIGURE 7.1 
A cube.

142 
LESSON 7: Painting Your Objects
grain on the various faces, you can see that it looks a lot more like a
block of wood.
That’s what painting looks like in SketchUp. You don’t usually just paint
colors, you paint textures, too. SketchUp comes with a large selection of
textures for you to paint with—everything from wood to brick.
TIP: Texture Aligns with Surfaces
In addition, it’s worth noting that the textures you paint align with
the surface. That means, for example, that when you paint a sur-
face to have a wood texture, the grain of the wood aligns with the
surface.
Let’s get started.
The Paint Tool
FIGURE 7.2 
A block of wood created using the Paint tool.

143
Using the Paint Tool
Using the Paint Tool
In the first task for this lesson, we’ll see how to use the paint bucket at its
simplest, just bringing it up and painting some surfaces.
To get started with the Paint tool, follow these steps:
1. Start SketchUp. The Welcome to SketchUp dialog box appears.
For this task, we’ll work with the Engineering–Feet template
we’ve used in the previous lessons.
2. Click the Start Using SketchUp button.
3. Select the Rectangle tool.
4. Draw a horizontal rectangle.
5. Select the Push/Pull tool in the toolbar.
6. Pull the rectangle up into a cube.
7. Select the Paint tool in the toolbar (refer to Figure 7.2).
Selecting the Paint tool displays the materials browser, as shown
in Figure 7.3.
The materials browser lets you select the material you want to
paint with. By default, the materials browser will have a texture
selected, such as brick.
8. Click all surfaces of the cube. This will paint all surfaces of the
cube with the texture selected in the materials browser.
If you like, you can orbit and paint the back surfaces as well.
You can see the results in Figure 7.4, where the cube has been
painted with brick texture.
That lets us get started with painting. But the default texture that SketchUp
selected is probably not what you had in mind to paint that car or chair
you’ve been drawing.
To see how to set your own textures, take a look at the next task.

144 
LESSON 7: Painting Your Objects

145
Selecting Materials
Selecting Materials
Let’s say you want to draw a tile floor. How would you select that texture
to paint it?
Follow these steps:
1. Click the Start Using SketchUp button.
2. Select the Rectangle tool in the toolbar.
3. Draw a horizontal rectangle.
4. Select the Paint tool in the toolbar.
The materials browser opens. You can select a collection of tex-
tures from the drop-down texture list box (next to the button dis-
playing a house). Then you can choose from the following tex-
ture collections:
. Carpet and textiles
. Colors
. Colors–Named
. Fencing
. Groundcover
. Markers
. Metal
. Roofing
. Sketchy
. Stone
. Tile
. Translucent
. Vegetation
. Water
. Wood
5. Select the Tile texture collection from the textures drop-down list.
6. Select a tile texture of your liking by clicking it.
7. Click the horizontal rectangle. The rectangle is painted in the tex-
ture you’ve requested, as shown in Figure 7.5.

146 
LESSON 7: Painting Your Objects
There you have it—now you’re drawing with textures.
Eliminating Automatic Shading
You might have noticed that SketchUp automatically shades the objects it
draws. So, for example, the top of the cube in Figure 7.1 appears dark
compared to the cube’s sides. However, now that you’re setting your own
textures and painting objects, you may prefer that SketchUp not shade
objects automatically. For example, that tile floor in Figure 7.5 appears
dark because of automatic shading.
To eliminate automatic shading, follow these steps:
1. Click the Start Using SketchUp button. This opens SketchUp.
2. Select the Window menu’s Shadow item. This opens the Shadow
Settings dialog box you see in the upper left of Figure 7.6.
FIGURE 7.5 
A tile floor.

147
Eliminating Automatic Shading
3. Set both the Light and Dark settings to 100.
4. Click the X button at the upper right to close the Shadow
Settings dialog box.
Now the tile floor created in the previous task is not automatically shaded,
as you can see in Figure 7.6.
TIP: Using the Sun for Shading
You can also simulate the sun for your shading needs. Simply
select the Use Sun for Shading check box in the Shadow Settings
dialog box.
FIGURE 7.6 
The Shadow Settings dialog box.

148 
LESSON 7: Painting Your Objects
Drawing in Solid Color
Let’s say you wanted a pink circle. That’s it, just a plain pink circle. No
texture, just plain color. How would you get it?
Here’s how (note that figures are grayscale only):
1. Click the Start Using SketchUp button.
2. Select the Circle tool in the toolbar.
3. Draw a horizontal circle.
4. Select the Paint tool in the toolbar.
The materials browser opens.
5. Select the Colors texture collection from the textures drop-down
list. The materials browser displays many colors, as you can see
in Figure 7.7.
FIGURE 7.7 
Plain colors.

149
Painting Multiple Surfaces at Once
6. Scroll up and down through the colors until you find a shade of
pink you like.
7. Click the horizontal circle. The circles are painted plain pink, as
shown in Figure 7.8.
TIP: Selecting Named Colors
Want to choose your colors by name, such as cyan, magenta, coral,
and so on? Just select Colors–Named in the textures drop-down list
and let the mouse hover over the color rectangles. A ToolTip will
appear showing the name of the color you’re hovering over.
Painting Multiple Surfaces at Once
You can paint multiple surfaces at once, which is great if you’re trying to
select from among different textures and want to try them all, but don’t
want to have to click every surface each time you select a different texture.
FIGURE 7.8 
A pink circle.

150 
LESSON 7: Painting Your Objects
Here’s how it works:
1. Click the Start Using SketchUp button.
2. Select the Circle tool.
3. Draw three horizontal circles.
4. Select the Select tool in the toolbar.
5. Holding down the Ctrl key (Option key on the Mac), click all
three circles to select them.
6. Select the Paint tool in the toolbar.
The materials browser opens.
7. Select the texture collection you want from the textures drop-
down list.
8. Select a texture of your liking by clicking it.
9. Click a horizontal circle. When you do, all three circles are paint-
ed at the same time, as you see in Figure 7.9.
FIGURE 7.9 
Coloring three circles at once.

151
Examining All Materials in Your Model
Now you’re able to paint multiple surfaces at once.
Examining All Materials in Your
Model
Want to take a look at all the textures in your model at once?
You can do that in SketchUp. To see how, let’s draw a cube, add textures
to its various faces, and then take a look at the textures in the drawing all
at once. Here’s how it works:
1. Click the Start Using SketchUp button.
2. Select the Rectangle tool.
3. Draw a horizontal rectangle.
4. Select the Push/Pull tool in the toolbar.
5. Pull the rectangle up into a cube.
6. Select the Paint tool in the toolbar.
Selecting the Paint tool displays the materials browser.
7. Select a texture collection you like. In this example, we’re going
to use the first collection in the Texture drop-down list box, the
Bricks and Cladding collection.
8. Select a texture by clicking it.
9. Click a face of the cube to give it that texture.
10. Repeat steps 8 and 9 for all visible faces of the cube.
11. Click the Home button in the materials browser. This will display
all the textures currently in the drawing, as you can see in Figure
7.10.
TIP: Too Many Textures?
Why are there more textures displayed in the materials browser
than you painted on the cube? The answer is that the template

152 
LESSON 7: Painting Your Objects
FIGURE 7.10 
The textures in our drawing.
we’re using, Engineering–Feet, comes with several built-in plain
color textures to create the human figure that originally appears
when SketchUp starts.
That’s it—now you know how to access all the textures in your drawing.
TIP: More Details for Your Textures
To see the name of the textures in your drawing, hover the mouse
over them in the materials browser and the texture’s name will
appear in a ToolTip. For solid colors, the RGB values (that is, the
red, green, and blue values with a range of 0–255) appear separat-
ed by commas in the ToolTip, such as: 96, 96, 96.
Creating Materials
What if you can’t find the material you’re looking for in the materials
browser? What if your material doesn’t seem to exist yet?

153
Creating Materials
You can create your own. Just follow these steps:
1. Click the Start Using SketchUp button.
2. Select the Paint tool in the toolbar.
Selecting the Paint tool displays the materials browser.
3. Click the Create Material button in the materials browser. The
Create Material button is the second button from the top on the
right of the materials browser. Clicking it opens the Create
Material dialog box, as shown in Figure 7.11.
In this example, we’ll make a new material from a solid color.
4. Enter a name for your new material. In this example, we’ll leave
the name Material1, the default name for the new material.
5. Click a location in the color wheel. The square at the top left in
the Create Material dialog box changes to display that color.
FIGURE 7.11 
The Create Material dialog box.

154 
LESSON 7: Painting Your Objects
6. Click the OK button. The Create Material dialog box closes, and
your new material is added to the In Model collection of textures,
as shown in Figure 7.12.
Now you can use your new material to paint with as you like.
NOTE: Images as Textures
You can also use any saved image for the texture of the material
you want to create. Just click the Use Texture Image check box in
the Create Material dialog box, and browse to find the image file
you want to use as your new texture.
Editing Materials
Want to edit a material you’ve created? Just follow these steps:
1. Click the Start Using SketchUp button.
2. Select the Paint tool in the toolbar.
Selecting the Paint tool displays the materials browser.
3. Click the Home button (the button displaying a house) to display
the materials in your model.
FIGURE 7.12 
A new material.

155
Editing Materials
4. Select a material by clicking it. This opens the materials in your
model, as shown in Figure 7.13.
5. Click a new location in the color wheel, if desired. The square at
the top left in the Create Material dialog box changes to display
that color.
6. Click the Use Texture Image check box to change the image for
the material’s texture.
7. Browse to the image file that holds the image you want to use for
texture and select it; then click Open in the browsing dialog box.
8. Click the Select tab. The edits you made to your material will be
saved automatically.
In this way, you can make any changes to materials.
FIGURE 7.13 
Editing a material.

156 
LESSON 7: Painting Your Objects
Replacing All of a Material in a
Drawing
Take a look at the cubes in Figure 7.14, all surfaces of which are painted
with bricks.
What if you wanted to change the material used to paint the cubes to, say,
wood? Do you have to click each face of each cube individually?
No—you can change all occurrences of a material in a drawing at once
with SketchUp. In this task, we’ll draw the two cubes and then change
their materials from brick to wood. Here’s how it works:
1. Click the Start Using SketchUp button.
2. Select the Rectangle tool and draw a horizontal rectangle.
3. Select the Push/Pull tool in the toolbar and pull the rectangle up
into a cube.
FIGURE 7.14 
Two cubes with painted faces.

157
Sampling Existing Materials
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 to draw the second cube.
5. Select the Paint tool in the toolbar.
Selecting the Paint tool displays the materials browser.
6. Select the Bricks and Cladding texture collection in the materi-
als browser.
7. Select the Concrete Block (that is, large gray brick) texture in the
Bricks and Cladding collection by clicking it.
8. Click all surfaces of the cubes. This will paint all surfaces of the
cube with the concrete blocks.
Now we’ll change the material used in the cubes to wood.
9. Select the Wood texture collection in the materials browser.
10. Select the wood texture you like best by clicking it.
11. Hold down the Shift key.
12. Click one surface of a cube. When you do, all surfaces painted
with the same material change to the wood texture you’ve
selected.
You can see the results in Figure 7.15, where the cubes have been
painted with wood texture.
As you can see, it’s simple to repaint an object.
TIP: Painting Adjacent Surfaces
You can also restrict the repainting to adjacent surfaces if you use
the Ctrl (Option key on the Mac) instead of the Shift key.
Sampling Existing Materials
If you open a drawing that has materials unfamiliar to you, you can sample
those materials and see if SketchUp can figure out what the name of the
textures are.

158 
LESSON 7: Painting Your Objects
FIGURE 7.15 
Wood cubes.
For example, in this task, we’ll draw a cube with bricks on it, then sample
the material used to paint the surface and confirm that it’s brick. Here’s
how it works:
1. Click the Start Using SketchUp button.
2. Select the Rectangle tool and draw a horizontal rectangle.
3. Select the Push/Pull tool in the toolbar and pull the rectangle up
into a cube.
4. Select the Paint tool in the toolbar.
Selecting the Paint tool displays the materials browser.
5. Select the Bricks and Cladding texture collection in the materi-
als browser.
6. Select a brick texture that you like by clicking it.
7. Click all surfaces of the cube. This will paint all surfaces of the
cube with brick.

159
Sampling Existing Materials
Now we’ll sample a cube surface and see if SketchUp can deter-
mine what the material is.
8. Select the Dropper button in the materials browser. The mouse
cursor changes to a dropper image.
9. Click a surface of the cube. SketchUp will determine which
material the dropper has clicked and display that material, as well
as its name, in the square at the upper left in the materials brows-
er, as you can see in Figure 7.16.
It can be very useful to sample materials in this way to determine just what
materials they are.
FIGURE 7.16 
Sampling materials.

160 
LESSON 7: Painting Your Objects
Undoing Changes and Canceling
Operations
Paint a surface and then wish you hadn’t? SketchUp can undo the change.
In fact, nearly every operation you perform in SketchUp can be undone;
from drawing a line to painting a surface, or even deleting an object.
To undo an operation, select the Edit menu’s Undo item. The operation
will be undone and the drawing will be restored to its previous condition.
You can also press Ctrl + Z (Option + Z on the Mac) to do the same thing.
What if you’ve started an operation and want to cancel it? For example,
suppose you started drawing a line and then changed your mind, but the
Line tool is still stretching a line from the point you clicked to the present
mouse location as you move the mouse.
Just press the Esc key. That cancels any operation that you’ve started and
gets you out of it.

LESSON 8
Using the Rotate, Scale,
and Follow-Me Tools
In this lesson, we’re going to gain more SketchUp power by manipulating
objects.
Using Some New Tools
Here, we’ll learn to use the Rotate, Scale, and Follow-Me tools.
. The Rotate tool does just what it sounds like—it rotates objects.
You can use this tool not only to rotate whole objects, but also
parts of objects if you select a part of the object and then fold it
across edges.
. The Scale tool lets you enlarge and reduce objects as you like.
This is a useful tool in case you want to make changes to an
object’s size at any time.
. The Follow-Me tool lets you move 2D shapes along paths you’ve
specified to create 3D shapes. It’s very cool to watch.
Let’s get started with the Rotate tool.
Rotating Objects
The Rotate tool lets you rotate whole objects, or just part of an object.
The Rotate tool first establishes a plane of rotation by orienting itself to
the planes formed by the red, blue, and green axes, or any surface you
hover over. Then you establish an axis of rotation and rotate the object.

162 
LESSON 8: Using the Rotate, Scale, and Follow-Me Tools
First, we’ll need an object to rotate. We’ll use the Components dialog (as
we did in Lesson 6, “Creating Components and Groups”) and bring forth a
workstation desk set and orient it the way we want. For this task (and oth-
ers in this lesson), we’ll work with the familiar Engineering–Feet template.
Here’s how we can rotate a drawing of a workstation:
1. Start SketchUp.
2. Click the Start Using SketchUp button.
3. Select the Window menu’s Components item.
4. Click the down arrow next to the House button and click the
Architecture component collection.
5. In the Architecture collection, click the Furniture collection.
6. In the Furniture collection, click the Desks collection.
7. Click the Work Station Desk Set component.
8. Click inside your drawing to draw the desk set, as shown in
Figure 8.1. Now we’ll rotate the desk set.
9. Select the Rotate tool in the toolbar (shown in Figure 8.1).
Selecting the Rotate tool displays a rotation base, which appears
as a double circle, at the location of the mouse cursor. As you
move the mouse, SketchUp aligns the rotation base with the
underlying surfaces.
10. Click the location under the desk around which you want to
rotate the desk. This anchors the rotation base and sets the loca-
tion around which you will rotate the object. You can think of the
rotation base as an axle hub for the rotation.
NOTE: The Blue Box Indicates What Will Be Rotated
Note that because of the proximity of the rotation base and the
desk, SketchUp surrounds the desk in a blue box to indicate that it
has been selected as the target of your rotation operations.

163
Rotating Objects

FIGURE 8.1 
The Rotate tool and our desk.
11. After setting the rotation hub, you need to set the rotation axis,
the axle around which the rotation will take place. Move the
mouse to the end point of the rotation axis. One end point of the
rotation axis is automatically the rotation base; the other you set
by moving the mouse and then clicking it. The rotation axis is the
axis, or axle, around which the rotation will take place.
12. Click the mouse to lock the rotation axis in place. You can see
the rotation base and rotation axis we’re using in Figure 8.2. Now
you have the rotation base (the rotation axle hub) and the rotation
axis (the rotation axle) in place. When you move the mouse, the
desk rotates to match.
13. Move the mouse to rotate the object. This rotates the selected
object in 3D space to follow the movements of the mouse.

164 
LESSON 8: Using the Rotate, Scale, and Follow-Me Tools
FIGURE 8.2 
A rotation base and rotation axis.
14. Click the mouse to lock the object in its rotated position. You can
see the new position of the desk in our example in Figure 8.3.
That’s how rotation works in SketchUp.
Rotating Parts of Objects
The Rotate tool lets you rotate part of an object as well, which is great
when you want to “fold” part of an object over.
For example, we’ll rotate just part of a cube.
Here’s how it works:
1. Click the Start Using SketchUp button.
2. Select the Rectangle tool and draw a horizontal rectangle.

165
Rotating Parts of Objects
FIGURE 8.3 
A rotated object.
3. Select the Push/Pull tool in the toolbar and pull the rectangle up
into a cube.
4. Select the Line tool in the toolbar.
5. Draw a vertical line on one edge of the cube, as shown in Figure
8.4. Note that when you’re drawing the line, it will turn cyan
until it’s parallel to the vertical edges of the cube. This is a useful
guide if you want to draw a vertical line.
6. Now we’ll rotate part of the cube around the vertical line. Choose
the Select tool in the toolbar.
7. Click the right half of the bisected cube face. This selects that
half of the cube face and fills it with blue dots to indicate that it
has been selected.
8. Select the Rotate tool in the toolbar.

166 
LESSON 8: Using the Rotate, Scale, and Follow-Me Tools
FIGURE 8.4 
A cube with a line.
9. Click the location under the cube around which you want to
rotate the selected part of the cube. That is, click directly under
the bottom end point of the bisecting line.
10. After setting the rotation hub, you need to set the rotation axis,
the axle around which the rotation will take place. Move the
mouse to the end point of the rotation axis. That is, move the
mouse directly above the top end point of the bisecting line.
NOTE: One End Becomes the Rotation Axis
One end point of the rotation axis is automatically the rotation
base; the other you set by moving the mouse and then clicking it.
The rotation axis is the axis, or axle, around which the rotation will
take place.
11. Click the mouse to lock the rotation axis in place. Now you have
the rotation base (the rotation axle hub) and the rotation axis (the

167
Rotating Parts of Objects
rotation axle) in place. When you move the mouse, the desk will
rotate to match.
12. Move the mouse to rotate the object. This rotates the selected
object in 3D space to follow the movements of the mouse.
13. Click the mouse to lock the object in its rotated position. You can
see the new position of the right half of the bisected cube face in
our example in Figure 8.5.
Now you can partially rotate objects in SketchUp.
TIP: You Can Also Use the Move Tool
You can get the same effect as you see in Figure 8.5 with the
Move tool if you drag the right-most edge of the cube forward.
FIGURE 8.5 
A partially rotated object.

168 
LESSON 8: Using the Rotate, Scale, and Follow-Me Tools
Locking the Rotate Tool’s
Orientation
It’s sometimes hard to get the Rotate tool’s rotation base to use the orienta-
tion you want, because it aligns to any underlying surface. And if you have
a complex object, what you consider the current underlying surface is not
what SketchUp might consider the current underlying surface, which can
be frustrating.
One trick you can use is to lock the rotation base’s plane over a surface
you like and then move it to the surface you’re having problems with.
When you lock the rotation base, it preserves its orientation no matter how
what the underlying surface is.
Here’s how it works:
1. Click the Start Using SketchUp button.
2. Select the Rectangle tool and draw a horizontal rectangle.
3. Select the Push/Pull tool in the toolbar and pull the rectangle up
into a cube.
4. Select the Rotate tool in the toolbar.
5. Move the rotation base around the various surfaces and planes in
the drawing to confirm that the rotation base aligns with the
underlying surface. You can see examples in Figures 8.6 and 8.7.
6. Now we’ll lock the rotation base in the horizontal position. Move
the rotation base to an empty part of the drawing. By default, the
rotation base takes a horizontal alignment.
7. Press the Shift key. Pressing the Shift key locks the orientation of
the rotation base.
8. With the Shift key down, move the rotation base around the vari-
ous surfaces and planes in the drawing to confirm that the rota-
tion base stays horizontal. You can see examples in Figures 8.8
and 8.9.

169

171
Scaling 2D Objects
There you have it—now you can keep the rotation base the way you want it.
Scaling 2D Objects
You can use the Scale tool to enlarge or reduce objects in SketchUp.
Here’s how the Scale tool works for 2D objects:
1. Click the Start Using SketchUp button.
2. Select the Rectangle tool and draw a horizontal rectangle.
3. Select the View menu’s Toolbars item. This opens a submenu.
4. Select the submenu’s Large Tool Set item. This opens the large
toolbar.
5. Select the Scale tool in the large toolbar. The Scale tool is the
tool that displays an image of a rectangle being expanded.
6. Click the horizontal rectangle. The rectangle has sizing handles
added to it, as you can see in Figure 8.10.
7. Press the mouse button on a sizing handle. The sizing handle you
choose determines how the rectangle will be stretched when you
move the mouse, just as when you resize a window.
8. Drag the mouse to stretch the rectangle in the direction you’ve
chosen. The rectangle stretches as you pull it.
9. Release the mouse button. When you do, the rectangle is fixed in
place at its new size, as shown in Figure 8.11.
That’s all it takes to resize objects—just use the Scale tool.
TIP: Stretching Objects in Different Directions
Note that if you pull one of the corner sizing handles, the object will
be scaled so that it retains its proportions in both dimensions. But
if you pull on an edge sizing handle, not a corner one, the object
will be pulled in only the corresponding dimension, deforming the
object.

172 
LESSON 8: Using the Rotate, Scale, and Follow-Me Tools
The Scale Tool
FIGURE 8.10 
The Scale tool and sizing handles added to a rectangle.
Scaling 3D Objects
As you’d expect because SketchUp is a 3D program, you can also scale
objects in 3D. To see this in action, we’ll draw a cube and then scale it to
make it bigger.
Here’s how it works:
1. Click the Start Using SketchUp button.
2. Select the Rectangle tool and draw a horizontal rectangle.
3. Select the Push/Pull tool in the toolbar and pull the rectangle up
into a cube.
4. Select the Select tool in the toolbar.
5. Draw a selection rectangle around the cube with the mouse.
6. Release the mouse button. When you do, the cube is selected.

173
Scaling 3D Objects
FIGURE 8.11 
A newly resized rectangle.
7. Select the View menu’s Toolbars item. This opens a submenu.
8. Select the submenu’s Large Tool Set item. This opens the large
toolbar.
9. Select the Scale tool in the large toolbar.
When you select the Scale tool, the cube has sizing handles
added to it, as you can see in Figure 8.12.
10. Press the mouse button on a sizing handle. The sizing handle you
choose determines how the cube will be stretched.
11. Drag the mouse to stretch the cube in the direction you’ve cho-
sen. The cube stretches as you pull it.
12. Release the mouse button. When you do, the cube is fixed in
place at its new size, as shown in Figure 8.13.
Now you can resize objects in 3D.

175
Tapering Objects in 3D
TIP: Clicking a Cube Selects One Face for Scaling
If you don’t select the whole cube before selecting the Scale tool,
but simply click a cube face with the Scale tool, that face (only) is
selected for resizing. See the next task for more details.
Tapering Objects in 3D
Drawing regular 3D items is nice, but what if you want to taper an object
instead? What if you have a cylinder as shown in Figure 8.14?
However, you want to change the shape to be larger at the top, perhaps
similar to what you see in Figure 8.15 instead. What can you do?
You can create the shape you see in Figure 8.15 using the Scale tool.
Here’s how it works:
1. Click the Start Using SketchUp button.
2. Select the Circle tool and draw a horizontal circle.
FIGURE 8.14 
A cylinder.

176 
LESSON 8: Using the Rotate, Scale, and Follow-Me Tools
FIGURE 8.15 
A deformed cylinder.
3. Select the Push/Pull tool in the toolbar and pull the circle up into
a cylinder.
4. From the Large Tool Set select the Scale tool (open the Large
Tool Set from the View menu if necessary).
5. Click the circle at the top of the cylinder. The circle has sizing
handles added to it.
6. Click the mouse button on a sizing handle. The sizing handle you
choose determines how the top circle of the cylinder will be
stretched when you move the mouse.
7. Drag the mouse to stretch the cylinder in the direction you’ve
chosen. The cylinder stretches as you pull it.
8. Release the mouse button. When you do, the cylinder is fixed in
place at its new size, as shown in Figure 8.15.
But what if you wanted to create a regular funnel shape instead? Take a
look at the next task.

177
Scaling from the Center of Objects
Scaling from the Center of
Objects
So far, we’ve tapered an object by pulling one edge. But to taper an object
more regularly, you should taper from the center of the object. Suppose
you started with the cylinder in the previous task but wanted to end up
with the funnel shown in Figure 8.16.
Here’s how to create the funnel:
1. Click the Start Using SketchUp button.
2. Select the Circle tool and draw a horizontal circle.
3. Select the Push/Pull tool in the toolbar and pull the circle up into
a cylinder.
4. From the Large Tool Set select the Scale tool (open the Large
Tool Set from the View menu if necessary).
FIGURE 8.16 
A funnel.

178 
LESSON 8: Using the Rotate, Scale, and Follow-Me Tools
5. Click the circle at the top of the cylinder. The circle has sizing
handles added to it.
6. Press the Ctrl key. Pressing the Ctrl key makes the Scale tool scale
objects from their center, which is what we want in this case.
7. Click and hold the mouse button on a sizing handle.
8. Drag the mouse to stretch the cylinder into the funnel shape.
9. Release the mouse button. When you do, the funnel is fixed in
place at its new size, as shown in Figure 8.16.
That lets you scale objects from their center.
Setting Exact Scale
What if you had an object and you wanted to expand it by exactly a factor
of two? You can set the exact amount you resize an object by with the
Scale tool as follows, where we’re expanding a cube by a factor of two:
1. Click the Start Using SketchUp button.
2. Select the Rectangle tool and draw a horizontal rectangle.
3. Select the Push/Pull tool in the toolbar and pull the rectangle up
into a cube.
4. Select the Select tool in the toolbar.
5. Draw a selection rectangle around the cube with the mouse.
6. Release the mouse button. When you do, the cube is selected.
7. From the Large Tool Set select the Scale tool (open the Large
Tool Set from the View menu if necessary).
8. Press the mouse button on a sizing handle.
9. Drag the mouse to stretch the cube in the direction you want.
10. Release the mouse button.
11. Enter the factor by which you want to scale the cube. In this
example, we’ll scale the cube by a factor of two, so type 2.

179
Using the Follow-Me Tool
12. Press Enter. When you do, the cube is expanded from its original
size by a factor of two.
TIP: Factors Greater Than One Are Not Needed
Note that you can scale to a factor less than one if desired.
Factors of less than one will reduce an object’s size. For example,
a factor of 0.5 will reduce an object to half its original size.
And that’s setting exact scale.
Using the Follow-Me Tool
The Follow-Me tool lets you drag shapes down a path you specify. Take a
look at the object in Figure 8.17.
Can you draw that in SketchUp?
The Follow-Me Tool
FIGURE 8.17 
A curved object drawn using the Follow-Me tool.

180 
LESSON 8: Using the Rotate, Scale, and Follow-Me Tools
You sure can. All you need to do is to draw a circle, set up a curved path,
then move the circle along the curved path with the Follow-Me tool (also
shown in Figure 8.17). The Follow-Me tool lets you move shapes along
paths to make them 3D. Here’s how creating the shape shown in Figure
8.17 works:
1. Click the Start Using SketchUp button.
2. Select the Circle tool and draw a circle like the one shown in
Figure 8.18.
3. Select the Arc tool in the toolbar.
4. Click the mouse in your drawing at one end of the path you want
to pull the circle along.
5. Click the mouse at the other end point of the path you want to
pull the circle along.
FIGURE 8.18 
A circle.

181
Using the Follow-Me Tool
6. Pull the arc into the shape you want the circle to be pulled along
to create your 3D object.
7. Select the Select tool.
8. Click the circle to select it.
9. Select the Move tool.
10. Move the circle to the end of the arc, as shown in Figure 8.19.
11. From the Large Tool Set select the Follow-Me tool (open the
Large Tool Set from the View menu if necessary).
12. Now we’re ready to use the Follow-Me tool. If the circle isn’t
selected, select it with the Select tool and then select the Follow-
Me tool again.
13. Use the mouse to drag the circle along the arc. The Follow-Me
tool senses that you’re following the arc and keeps the circle
moving along it to draw the shape you see in Figure 8.17.
FIGURE 8.19 
A circle with an arc.

182 
LESSON 8: Using the Rotate, Scale, and Follow-Me Tools
TIP: You Don’t Have to Drag the Follow-Me Tool
You don’t have to drag the Follow-Me tool along a path if you don’t
want to. Simply select the edges that form the path you want with
the Select tool so they appear as dotted lines (and form a connect-
ed path). Then select the Follow-Me tool and click the shape you
want to have the Follow-Me tool drag around the path you selected
automatically.
The Follow-Me tool is invaluable if you want to create a shape by moving
another shape along a certain path.

LESSON 9
X-Raying Objects,
Creating Guides and
Offsets
In this lesson, we’re going to extend our SketchUp skill set by x-raying
objects, creating construction guides, and offsetting edges to make copies
of them.
Getting Started
When you x-ray surfaces, you can see what’s behind them. That’s great
when your model gets more involved and objects start obstructing objects
and you don’t want to keep rotating around to see behind them.
You can create construction guides with the Tape Measure tool.
Construction guides are dotted lines that you use for reference when mov-
ing or aligning other objects, and they’re great when you’re laying out the
parts of your model.
We’ll also see how to create offsets in this lesson. An offset is a copy of an
edge that you can resize just by dragging the mouse, and offsets are very
useful when you’re building items like doors and windows to build frames.
We’ll see all this in this lesson—let’s get started by giving some objects
the X-ray treatment.
NOTE: Know Your Tools
It’s assumed in these tasks that you have been progressing
through each lesson in order and learning about the individual tools
used here. In case you need to flip back for review, check out

184 
LESSON 9: X-Raying Objects, Creating Guides and Offsets
Lesson 3, “Drawing Shapes: Lines, Rectangles, Polygons, and
Circles,” for more on the Line, Rectangle, and Circle tools. See
Lesson 5, “Going 3D,” for a refresher on the Push/Pull and Move
tools.
X-Raying Objects
You can “see through” objects in SketchUp, which is very powerful in a
number of situations; for example, when you have two objects that obscure
one another and don’t want to keep rotating the drawing all the time, or
when you have two objects that overlap and want to position them correct-
ly with regard to each other.
Turning on X-ray view is easy. We’ll again use the Engineering–Feet tem-
plate and draw a few cubes; then we’ll X-ray them to show how this
works:
1. Click the Start Using SketchUp button.
2. Select the Rectangle tool and draw a horizontal rectangle.
3. Select the Push/Pull tool in the toolbar and pull the rectangle up
into a cube.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 to draw another cube.
5. Select the Select tool in the toolbar.
6. Draw a selection box around one of the cubes to select it.
7. Select the Move tool in the toolbar.
8. Move the selected cube behind the other cube. You can see what
this looks like in Figure 9.1.
9. From the View menu, select Face Style. A submenu appears.
10. Select the X-ray item in the submenu. This turns on X-ray
viewing and makes all objects “transparent,” as you can see in
Figure 9.2.
Note that you can now see through the obscuring cube to the
cube behind it. Very cool.

185
X-Raying Objects

Using X-ray view.
FIGURE 9.1 
One cube obscures another.

186 
LESSON 9: X-Raying Objects, Creating Guides and Offsets
As you can see, X-ray vision is a great tool to help you manage multiple
objects when they start to obscure each other. To turn it off, select the
View menu’s Face Style item to open the submenu, and select the X-ray
item again to toggle X-ray vision off.
Offsetting Edges with the Offset
Tool
The Offset tool lets you create copies of edges and move them away from
the original edge. That’s good when you have a complex surface and want
to draw a matching surface that’s smaller or larger. To see this in action,
we’ll start in this task with the object you see in Figure 9.3.
Using the Offset tool and the Push/Pull tool, we’ll change this object to the
one you see in Figure 9.4 with just a couple of clicks.
FIGURE 9.3 
A 3D object.

187
Offsetting Edges with the Offset Tool
Here’s how it works:
1. Click the Start Using SketchUp button.
2. Select Toolbars from the View menu. This opens a submenu.
3. Select the submenu’s Large Tool Set item. This opens the large
toolbar.
4. Select the Polygon tool in the Large Tool Set toolbar.
5. Draw a horizontal pentagon. Pentagons are the default polygon
drawn by the Polygon tool.
6. Select the Push/Pull tool in the toolbar.
7. Pull the pentagon up into 3D.
Now we’ll use the Offset tool to draw the offsets we need.
The Offset Tool
FIGURE 9.4 
Decorating an object using the Offset tool.

188 
LESSON 9: X-Raying Objects, Creating Guides and Offsets
8. Select the Offset tool in the Large Tool Set toolbar. The Offset
tool is the tool that displays an image of two concentric circle
sections with a red arrow connecting them (shown in Figure 9.4).
9. Click a surface of the object. Clicking a surface tells the Offset
tool which surface it should draw offsets of.
10. Move the mouse to make an offset appear. The Offset tool draws
an offset following the edges of the current surface, as you can
see in Figure 9.5.
11. Size the offset surface by moving the mouse.
12. Release the mouse button. This locks the offset into place.
13. Repeat steps 8–12 for all visible faces of the object. Use the
Rotation tool if you need to get a clearer view of a face.
14. Select the Push/Pull tool in the toolbar.
FIGURE 9.5 
An offset on a surface.

189
Selecting Edges to Offset
15. Select each offset surface and push it into the object, as shown in
Figure 9.4.
As you can see, offsetting surfaces is useful and easy.
Selecting Edges to Offset
In the previous task, we offset surfaces with the Offset tool. But some-
times, you don’t want to offset a whole surface—you just want to offset
selected edges.
To see what that means, take a look at the door in Figure 9.6.
Now suppose that you’d like to draw a frame around the door. Using the
Offset tool to offset the door’s surface leads to trouble, however, because
FIGURE 9.6 
A door.

190 
LESSON 9: X-Raying Objects, Creating Guides and Offsets
the frame the Offset tool is drawing overlaps the lintel (the board at the
bottom of a door), as you can see in Figure 9.7.
Wouldn’t it be nice if you could just offset the top three edges of the door,
as shown in Figure 9.8?
That way, you could use the Offset tool to draw the door frame without
having the frame overlap the door’s lintel.
You can do this if you use the Offset tool with edges, not surfaces. Here’s
how it works:
1. Click the Start Using SketchUp button.
2. Select the Line tool in the Getting Started toolbar.
3. Draw the door and lintel as shown in Figure 9.6.
4. Select the Select tool in the toolbar.
FIGURE 9.7 
An offset overlapping the lintel.

191
Selecting Edges to Offset
FIGURE 9.8 
An offset using edges.
5. Hold down the Ctrl key (Option key on the Mac) and click the
three upper edges of the door. Holding down the Ctrl (or Option)
key means you can make multiple selections just by clicking
them with the Select tool.
When you’re done, the top three edges of the door should be
selected.
6. From the Large Tool Set select the Offset tool (open the Large
Tool Set from the View menu if necessary).
7. Click inside the door.
8. Move the mouse to make an offset appear. The Offset tool draws
an offset following the edges of the current surface, as you can
see in Figure 9.8.
9. Size the offset surface by moving the mouse.
10. Release the mouse button. This locks the offset into place, as you
can see in Figure 9.9.

192 
LESSON 9: X-Raying Objects, Creating Guides and Offsets
As you can see, offsetting surfaces is easy.
Creating Exact Offsets
Because this is SketchUp, you might assume you can create measured off-
sets of exactly a precise length offset from the surrounding edges—and
you’d be right.
Suppose, for example, that you draw a cube and want a surface drawn on
one face offset from the surrounding edges by exactly one foot. Can you
do it? Yes, you can; just follow these steps:
1. Click the Start Using SketchUp button.
2. Select the Rectangle tool and draw a horizontal rectangle.
3. Select the Push/Pull tool in the toolbar and pull the rectangle up
into a cube.
FIGURE 9.9 
A new door frame.

193
Creating Exact Offsets
4. From the Large Tool Set select the Offset tool (open the Large
Tool Set from the View menu if necessary).
5. Click the surface you want to create the offset on. The surface
becomes selected when you click it.
6. Enter the size of the offset you want. In this example, we’ll cre-
ate a one-foot offset. In general, you enter a length and then the
units—you can use these units:
. cm to signify centimeters
. m to signify meters
. ' for feet
. " for inches
Thus, for example, 1' means one foot, so type '.
7. Press Enter. The offset appears, as you see in Figure 9.10.
That’s the way to measure offsets.
FIGURE 9.10 
A measured offset.

194 
LESSON 9: X-Raying Objects, Creating Guides and Offsets
Repeating Offsets on Other
Surfaces
You can repeat offsets on different surfaces with the click of the mouse.
Here’s how it works; in this example, we’ll repeat offsets on various faces
of a cube:
1. Click the Start Using SketchUp button.
2. Select the Rectangle tool and draw a horizontal rectangle.
3. Select the Push/Pull tool in the toolbar and pull the rectangle up
into a cube.
4. From the Large Tool Set select the Offset tool (open the Large
Tool Set from the View menu if necessary).
5. Draw an offset edge on one surface of the cube. You can see an
example in Figure 9.11.
FIGURE 9.11 
An offset edge.

195
Measuring Distances with the Tape Measure
6. Double-click the mouse on another surface of the cube. Double-
clicking the mouse draws another offset at the same distance you
drew the previous one, as you see in Figure 9.12.
NOTE: Offsets Within Offsets
Note that you can create offsets within offsets using the same dis-
tance as well—for example, see Figure 9.13, where we’ve clicked
inside the first offset rectangle.
Creating offsets that are all the same size is extremely useful when you
have, say, multiple panels you want to create in a drawing.
Measuring Distances with the
Tape Measure
The Tape Measure tool lets you measure distances handily in your model.
When you’re drawing plans to scale, that can be indispensable.
FIGURE 9.12 
A new offset edge.

196 
LESSON 9: X-Raying Objects, Creating Guides and Offsets
FIGURE 9.13 
An offset inside an offset.
In this example, we’ll draw a cube and then measure one face. Here’s how
it works:
1. Click the Start Using SketchUp button.
2. Select the Rectangle tool and draw a horizontal rectangle.
3. Select the Push/Pull tool in the toolbar and pull the rectangle up
into a cube.
4. Select the Tape Measure tool in the Getting Started toolbar
(shown in Figure 9.14).
5. Click the mouse button on one edge of the cube. This anchors the
Tape Measure tool to the location you’ve clicked.
6. Move the mouse to the opposite edge of the cube. You can see
this at work in Figure 9.14.
You can see the width of the cube face in two places in Figure 9.14—in a
ToolTip at the location of the Tape Measure tool (which reads 7.473') and
in the Value Control Box, or VCB, at the lower right in SketchUp.

The Tape Measure Tool
FIGURE 9.14 
Using the Tape Measure tool.
TIP: Measurements Are Always Available
Note that the measurement in the ToolTip disappears after a
moment, but the measurement is always displayed in the Value
Control Box.
That’s the way you can measure distances in SketchUp using the Tape
Measure tool and the Value Control Box.
TIP: Canceling the Tape Measure Tool
After you press the mouse button and begin moving the Tape
Measure tool around your drawing, it’ll keep measuring distances
no matter where you move the mouse. That’s great if you have mul-
tiple distances to measure, but eventually you’ll want to turn off the
Tape Measure tool. To turn it off, select another tool, or press the
Esc key.

LESSON 9: X-Raying Objects, Creating Guides and Offsets
Creating Guides with the Tape
Measure Tool
Guides are dotted lines that you can use to align objects. They’re very
handy when you are creating a drawing with multiple objects that have to
be in a specific relation to the others, such as in perfect rows. All you have
to do is to align the edges of the object with the guides you’ve drawn from
other objects.
We’ll take a look at how this works by aligning three cubes in a row using
guides. Here’s how it works:
1. Click the Start Using SketchUp button.
2. Select the Rectangle tool and draw a horizontal rectangle.
3. Select the Push/Pull tool in the toolbar and pull the rectangle up
into a cube.
4. Select the Select tool in the toolbar.
5. Draw a selection rectangle around the cube.
6. Select Copy from the Edit menu.
7. Select Paste from the Edit menu.
8. Click the mouse at the location where you want a new cube to
appear.
9. Repeat steps 4–8 to create a third cube. Now you have three
cubes, as shown in Figure 9.15.
10. Select the Tape Measure tool in the Getting Started toolbar.
11. Click the top-front edge of one of the cubes. A guide appears
(represented by a dotted line), as shown in Figure 9.16.
12. Select the Select tool in the toolbar.

199

200 
LESSON 9: X-Raying Objects, Creating Guides and Offsets
13. Draw a selection rectangle around a cube that doesn’t have the
guide attached.
14. Select the Move tool in the toolbar.
15. Move the cube into alignment with the guide, as shown in
Figure 9.17.
16. Repeat steps 12–15 to align the third cube, as shown in Figure
9.18.
Now the three cubes are in a row, and you know how to use
guides to align objects in SketchUp.
Drawing Guides at Specific
Offsets
In the previous task, we added a guide to a drawing with three cubes to
align those cubes in a row. But what if you also wanted to space those
cubes apart at an exact distance?
FIGURE 9.17 
Aligning a cube.

201
Drawing Guides at Specific Offsets
FIGURE 9.18 
Aligning three cubes.
We’ll see how to use guides to do that in this task. If you haven’t already
completed the previous task, do so now in preparation for this task.
So how do you draw guides at a specific distance away from an edge?
Here’s how you do it, using the three cubes example developed in the pre-
vious task:
1. Start with the three cubes aligned in a row from the previous task.
2. Select the Tape Measure tool in the Getting Started toolbar.
3. Click the top-right edge of the middle cube. This anchors the
Tape Measure tool.
4. Move the mouse away from the middle cube toward the cube on
the right. This pulls a guide out from and parallel to the top-right
edge of the middle cube.
You can pull the guide to any distance you want. In this task,
we’ll see how to pull it out exactly three feet.
5. Release the mouse button.

202 
LESSON 9: X-Raying Objects, Creating Guides and Offsets
6. Enter the offset you want for the guide. In this example, we’ll
create a three-foot offset for the guide. In general, you enter a
length and then the units. You can use these units:
. cm to signify centimeters
. m to signify meters
. ' for feet
. " for inches
For example, 3' means three feet, so type 3'.
7. Press Enter. The guide snaps to three feet from the middle cube,
as you see in Figure 9.19.
8. Select the Select tool in the toolbar.
9. Draw a selection rectangle around a cube that doesn’t have the
guide attached.
10. Select the Move tool in the toolbar.
FIGURE 9.19 
A new guide.


203
Drawing Guides at Specific Offsets
11. Move the cube into alignment with the new guide, spacing it at
three feet from the middle cube.
12. Select the Tape Measure tool in the Getting Started toolbar.
13. Click the top-left edge of the middle cube. This anchors the Tape
Measure tool.
14. Move the mouse away from the middle cube toward the cube on
the left.
15. Enter the offset you want for the guide. In this example, we’ll
create a three-foot offset for the guide, so type 3'.
16. Press Enter.
17. Repeat steps 8–11 to move the left cube into alignment.
Now your cubes are in a row, and evenly spaced, as you see in
Figure 9.20.
FIGURE 9.20 
Three cubes in a row, evenly spaced.

204 
LESSON 9: X-Raying Objects, Creating Guides and Offsets
Now that you’ve got your three cubes in a row and evenly spaced, you
don’t need the guides any more. How do you get rid of them? See the
next task.
Deleting Guides
In the previous two tasks, you created a number of guides that you used to
align three cubes. Now that the guides have served their purpose, can you
get rid of them?
Yes, you can. Just follow these steps:
1. Start with the three cubes aligned in a row from the previous task.
2. Select the Eraser tool in the Getting Started toolbar.
3. Click and hold down the mouse button and drag the mouse over
the guides in the drawing. When you do, the guides are erased, as
you see in Figure 9.21.
That’s it—the guides are gone, and your cubes are all in a row.
FIGURE 9.21 
Erasing guides.

LESSON 10
Dimensioning, Drawing
Angles, and Getting
Cross Sections of
Models
In this lesson, we’re going to take a look at three important SketchUp
tools—the Dimensioning tool, the Protractor tool, and the Sectioning tool.
The Dimensioning tool lets you display dimensions in your model, as you
can see in Figure 10.1.
FIGURE 10.1 
Displaying dimensions.

206 
LESSON 10: Dimensioning, Drawing Angles,
and Getting Cross Sections of Models
The Dimensioning tool is a great one when you’re creating plans of any
sort, such as architectural plans, and need to indicate distances.
The Protractor tool lets you do for angles what the Tape Measure tool (see
Lesson 9, “X-Raying Objects, Creating Guides and Offsets”) lets you do
for straight edges. You use the Protractor to measure angles or to create
guides at specific angles. That’s useful if you have objects in your drawing
that need to be at a certain angle from other objects, such as the slope of a
roof with respect to the rest of the house.
Finally, we’ll take a look at the Sectioning tool. This tool lets you create
cutaway sections in your models. This way, complex models can be made
clearer by taking sections of the model and making the rest of the model
invisible.
All this is coming up in this lesson.
Dimensioning Distances
The Dimensioning tool lets you add dimension labels to a drawing to indi-
cate distances. That’s particularly useful when you’re drawing plans where
measurements are important, such as architectural plans that will be used
in actual construction.
For the tasks in this lesson we’ll again use the Engineering–Feet template
we’ve used previously.
Here’s how to use the Dimensioning tool to measure a cube:
1. Click the Start Using SketchUp button.
2. Select the Rectangle tool and draw a horizontal rectangle.
3. Select the Push/Pull tool in the toolbar and pull the rectangle up
into a cube.
4. Select Toolbars from the View menu. This opens a submenu.
5. Select the submenu’s Large Tool Set item. This opens the large
toolbar.
6. Select the Dimensioning tool in the toolbar (shown in Figure
10.2).

207
Dimensioning Distances
The Dimensioning Tool
FIGURE 10.2 
Pulling a dimensioning label using the Dimensioning tool.
7. Click an edge of the cube.
8. Pull a dimensioning label away from the edge. You can see what
this looks like in Figure 10.2.
9. Click to fix the dimensioning label in place.
10. Repeat steps 7 and 8 for additional edges of the cube. You can
see the results in Figure 10.3.
Great—now you can add dimension labels to your models.
TIP: Dimensioning Between Any Two Points
You can also add a dimension label between any two points in a
drawing, not just an edge. To do that, select the Dimensioning tool,
click the first point, and then click the second point.

208 
LESSON 10: Dimensioning, Drawing Angles,
and Getting Cross Sections of Models
FIGURE 10.3 
Dimensions added to a cube.
Dimensioning Arcs
The Dimensioning tool also lets you add dimension labels to arcs, not just
straight edges. Follow these steps:
1. Click the Start Using SketchUp button.
2. Select the Arc tool.
3. Draw an arc.
4. From the Large Tool Set select the Dimensioning tool (open the
Large Tool Set from the View menu if necessary).
5. Click the arc. The Dimensioning tool displays the radius of the
arc, prefixed by the letter R.
6. Click the center of the arc to fix the dimension label in place.
You can see what this looks like in Figure 10.4.
That’s it—now you can add dimensioning labels to an arc.

209
Freezing Dimensions
FIGURE 10.4 
Dimensioning an arc.
Freezing Dimensions
When you resize an object that has a dimensioning label attached to it, the
label is updated with the new length by default. However, you can lock the
dimension label’s displayed length so that it won’t change no matter how
much you resize the object. Here’s how:
1. Click the Start Using SketchUp button.
2. Select the Rectangle tool and draw a horizontal rectangle.
3. Select the Push/Pull tool in the toolbar and pull the rectangle up
into a cube.
4. From the Large Tool Set select the Dimensioning tool (open the
Large Tool Set from the View menu if necessary).
5. Click an edge of the cube.
6. Pull a dimensioning guide away from the edge to create a dimen-
sioning label.

210 
LESSON 10: Dimensioning, Drawing Angles,
and Getting Cross Sections of Models
7. Click to fix the dimensioning guide in place. The dimensioning
label displays the length of the edge you’ve attached it to, as
shown in Figure 10.5.
8. Select the Push/Pull tool in the toolbar.
9. Pull the cube up vertically as you see in Figure 10.6. Note that
the length measurement in the dimensioning label changes to
match the new height.
10. Double-click the dimensioning label.
11. Enter a new length for the dimension. In this example, we’ll cre-
ate a six-foot length. In general, you enter a length and then the
units—you can use these units:
. cm to signify centimeters
. m to signify meters
. ' for feet
. " for inches
FIGURE 10.5 
A cube with a dimensioning label.

211
Configuring Dimensioning Labels
FIGURE 10.6 
A resized cube.
Setting your own dimensions can be very useful when you’re creating
architectural or other plans.
Configuring Dimensioning Labels
You’ve seen the default font and style for dimensioning labels in the previ-
ous tasks and you might not like it. Fortunately, you can change it.
For example, 6' means six feet, so you would type 6'.
Now the dimension label reads six feet, as you can see in Figure
10.7, and it won’t change no matter how you resize the object.

212 
LESSON 10: Dimensioning, Drawing Angles,
and Getting Cross Sections of Models
FIGURE 10.7 
A fixed dimension.
For example, in this task, we’ll change the font used for dimensioning
labels from the default Tahoma 12 points to Times New Roman 18 points
(or another font and font size that your system supports):
1. Click the Start Using SketchUp button.
2. Select the Rectangle tool and draw a horizontal rectangle.
3. Select the Push/Pull tool in the toolbar and pull the rectangle up
into a cube.
4. From the Large Tool Set select the Dimensioning tool (open the
Large Tool Set from the View menu if necessary).
5. Click an edge of the cube.
6. Pull a dimensioning label away from the edge.
7. Click to fix the dimensioning label in place.
8. Select Model Info from the Window menu. This opens the
Model Info dialog box.

213
Configuring Dimensioning Labels
FIGURE 10.8 
The Dimensions settings dialog.
9. Click the Dimensions item at the left in the Model Info dialog box.
This opens the Dimensions settings, as you see in Figure 10.8.
10. Click the Select All Dimensions button.
11. Click the Font button. This opens the Font dialog box, as you see
in Figure 10.9.
12. Select the Times New Roman font (or another font supported by
your system).
13. Select 18 point font size.
FIGURE 10.9 
The Font dialog box.

214 
LESSON 10: Dimensioning, Drawing Angles,
and Getting Cross Sections of Models
14. Click OK.
15. Click the Update Selected Dimensions button.
16. Click the X button at the upper right in the Model Info dialog
box to close it. The font in your dimensioning labels changes to
match your new settings.
TIP: Setting Arrow Styles
Note that you can also set the style for arrows used in dimension-
ing labels. Just select the new style you want from the drop-down
list in the Model Info dialog box–closed arrows (that is, filled-in
arrow heads), open arrows, dotted lines, and more.
And that lets you configure dimension labels.
Measuring Angles
The Protractor tool is great for measuring angles. Suppose you had the
object with an angle on one side, as you see in Figure 10.10. Now suppose
that you wanted to measure that angle. How could you do it?
FIGURE 10.10 
An object with an angle in one face.

215
Measuring Angles
You could use the Protractor tool. This tool is to angles what the Tape
Measure tool is to lengths—that is, you can measure angles with it.
To see how this works, follow these steps:
1. Click the Start Using SketchUp button.
2. Select the Rectangle tool and draw a horizontal rectangle.
3. Select the Push/Pull tool in the toolbar and pull the rectangle up
into a cube.
4. Select the Line tool in the toolbar.
5. Draw a vertical line on the right face of the cube.
6. Select the Move tool in the toolbar.
7. Pull the right-most edge of the cube out until your object looks
like Figure 10.11.
8. Select the View menu’s Toolbars item. This opens a submenu.
The Protractor Tool
FIGURE 10.11 
The Protractor tool in use.

216 
LESSON 10: Dimensioning, Drawing Angles,
and Getting Cross Sections of Models
9. Select the submenu’s Large Tool Set item. This opens the large
toolbar.
10. Select the Protractor tool in the toolbar.
11. Click the vertex of the angle you plan to measure. A protractor
appears at the location you’ve clicked, as shown in Figure 10.11.
12. Click one of the edges that make up the angle.
13. Click the other edge that makes up the angle. Two dotted lines
extend from the protractor, measuring the angle, as you see in
Figure 10.12.
You can see the angle the protractor is measuring in the Value
Control Box at the lower right: 128.6 degrees.
That’s great if you need to measure an angle, but what if you want to spec-
ify a certain angle instead, and set up guides to match?
Take a look at the next task.
FIGURE 10.12 
Measuring an angle.

217
Creating Guides at Specific Angles
Creating Guides at Specific
Angles
You can also create guides at given angles. Take a look at the two cubes in
Figure 10.13.
Suppose you need them to be aligned so that the back face of the right
cube is at 145° with respect to the right face of the left cube, as shown in
Figure 10.14. How could you move the cubes to meet this criteria?
You use the Protractor tool to draw construction guides at an angle. Here’s
how it works:
1. Click the Start Using SketchUp button.
FIGURE 10.13 
Two cubes in a drawing.

218 
LESSON 10: Dimensioning, Drawing Angles,
and Getting Cross Sections of Models
FIGURE 10.14 
Two cubes at a specified angle.
2. Select the Rectangle tool and draw a horizontal rectangle.
3. Select the Push/Pull tool in the toolbar and pull the rectangle up
into a cube.
4. Select the Select tool in the toolbar.
5. Draw a selection rectangle around the cube.
6. Select the Edit menu’s Copy item.
7. Select the Edit menu’s Paste item.
8. Click the mouse at the location where you want a new cube to
appear.
9. From the Large Tool Set select the Protractor tool (open the
Large Tool Set from the View menu if necessary).
10. Click the upper-left corner of the left cube. A protractor appears
at the location you’ve clicked, as shown in Figure 10.15.

219
Creating Guides at Specific Angles
11. Click the top left edge of the left cube.
12. Move the mouse in the direction you want your angle guide to
appear.
13. Type in the angle at which you want the guide to appear. In this
example, we’ll use 145 degrees, so type in 145.
14. Press Enter.
An angle guide snaps into position, as you can see in Figure 10.15.
15. Use the Move and Rotate tools to move the right cube into posi-
tion along the guide, as shown in Figure 10.16.
16. Use the Eraser tool to delete the guide. You end up with the
drawing previously shown in Figure 10.14.
Now you’re able to draw construction guides not only along straight edges,
but also along angles.
FIGURE 10.15 
A protractor on a cube.

TIP: Drawing Roof Slopes
If you want to draw a roof slope, measured as two numbers sepa-
rated by a colon, you can enter that instead of an angle in degrees.
For example, you might enter 6:12 and then press the Enter key.
Creating Cutaway Views of Your
Model
SketchUp enables you to get cutaway views of your models. Suppose you
had a model of a motorcycle, as shown in Figure 10.17.
As with any complex model, you might want to display various cross sec-
tions to indicate what makes the model tick. You can do that with the
Section Pane tool.
Just follow these steps:
1. Click the Start Using SketchUp button.

221
Creating Cutaway Views of Your Model
FIGURE 10.17 
A motorcycle.
2. Draw your model.
3. Select the View menu’s Toolbars item. This opens a submenu.
4. Select the submenu’s Large Tool Set item. This opens the large
toolbar.
5. Select the Section Pane tool in the toolbar (shown in Figure
10.18).
6. Move the Section Pane tool over your model. The Section Pane
tool draws a plane that aligns with any underlying surface.
7. Click when you’ve selected the right cutaway section with the
Section Pane tool. You can see an example in Figure 10.18.
Want to preserve the part of the model that was cut and cut the rest
instead? See the next task.

222

FIGURE 10.18 
A cross section using the Section Pane tool.
Reversing the Direction of a
Section Cut
By default, the Section Pane tool cuts away the top of a model. But you
can make it cut away the bottom of a model instead.
Just follow these steps:
1. Click the Start Using SketchUp button.
2. Draw your model.
3. From the Large Tool Set select the Section Pane tool (open the
Large Tool Set from the View menu if necessary).
4. Move the Section Pane tool over your model. The Section Pane
tool draws a plane that aligns with any underlying surface.

223
Reversing the Direction of a Section Cut
5. Click when you’ve selected the right cutaway section with the
Section Pane tool.
6. Right click the section pane. A context menu appears.
7. Select the Reverse item in the context menu. The part of the
model that was cut away reappears, and the part that was visible
disappears, as you can see in the example in Figure 10.19.
Now you’ve got complete control over section panes.
