THE IMMENSE AND THE OUTRAGEOUS
T^EXT to the unresolved ques-
’
tion,
“What
is
science
fic-
tion?”,
the
most
fascinating
ar-
gument
in
the
field
is
that
concerning
sf as literature,
or, as
some people prefer to
call
it,
as
Art. A great many of those who
hold that the best of sf stands up
with
the
best
of any
literature,
seem
to
lose
sight
of
the
fact
that
it
is perforce different from
other
fields.
If
it weren’t there’d
be
no
fen,
no
Cons,
no
Hugo.
My own
objections
to
the
lay-
180
man’s attitude has come down to
this:
good
sf
out
of
the
main
stream, like On the Beach or Fail
Safe, ought
to be acknowledged
as such. Likewise, good literature
within our field ought to be recog-
nized as such.
What brings out these
cogita-
tions just now
is the appearance
of two remarkable books, wildly
different one from the other, and
from most of anything you have
ever read, yet both works of real
stature.
GALAXY
L
Harry Martinson
is one of the
Immortals of the Swedish Acad-
emy.
In
1953
he
published
a
short
volume
of
“songs”
called
Cicada, a version of which formed
the
libretto
for
an
opera
per-
formed at the Edinburgh Festival
in
’59
and
at
Covent
Garden,
London, in 1960. Aniara (Knopf,
133
pp.,
$4.00)
contains the 29
“songs”
of
Cicada
and
a
great
many more, to total
103.
Aniara
is the story of a space-
ship
loaded with
four thousand
immigrants from Earth to Mars.
It
encounters
asteroids,
is
flung
off course and damaged
so that
it
can’t
be
turned. The
whole
book, then,
is an examination
of
bottled-up humanity in an abso-
lutely
inescapable
predicament
which can end only in death. We
see them
in the
sixth, the ninth
and
the
twentieth
years,
in
epi-
sodes
of fad and
fashion,
of
re-
ligion,
of love and
fear.
I
have
read
somewhere
that
Swedish
is
not
a
language
that
lends itself to literary excellence.
Either this is not so, or the trans-
lators
(Hugh
Macdiarmid
and
Elspeth
Harley
Schubert)
are
people
of unusual
literary
skill;
for the language
is simply beau-
tiful.
I
nominate
for
anyone’s
high
shelf of immortal
lines-out-
of-context
(like,
“Forever
shalt
thou
love, and she be
fair,” and
“.
.
. a rose-red
city, half as old
as Time,”) this from Aniara:
She wounds, but as a rose may
wound, not always, as expected,
with its thorn. A rose will always
wound you
with
its
rose
.
.
.
Martinson’s achievement here
is an inexpressible, immeasurable
sadness. It is something that tran-
scends panic and terror and even
despair, which is after all a roiling
and
acidulous
condition.
He
leaves you
in
the
quiet immen-
sities, with
the
feeling that you
have spent time, and have been
permanently tinted, by and with
an
impersonal,
larger-than-God
force which
is inimical exactly to
the extent that you are alive and
have
being.
I
cannot and
will
not
accept
Martinson’s profound disgust with
humanity
:
.
.
. describe the men who there
in
beauty
stitched
the
white
shrouds of their race
until God
and Satan hand in hand from a
defiled and poisoned
land past
plains and
mountains
fled
the
face of man; the King of Ashes.
— preferring to regard this and
other documents,
(like
1984,
or
Jean
Genet’s
The
Balcony)
as
terrifying
and
accurate
projec-
tions of what might be, and there-
fore informative of how to change
course actively and with purpose.
Nevertheless I feel personally en-
riched and enlarged by this book,
one which
I
shall
surely always
keep and read and ponder.

I^NE-TIME sf-ist Philip Wylie,
who went on to hate middle-
aged
ladies
for
a
living,
called
his greatest book, Finnley Wren,
“a novel
in a new manner.”
It’s
a nice concept, and a challenging
one — to write a novel in a new
manner.
I know a guy who has done
it
twice. Kurt Vonnegut,
Jr., whose
Sirens of Titan is a perfect exam-
ple of the piece of fine literature
denied the general public by
its
Buck Rogers syndrome, has done
it again with Cat’s Cradle
(Holt,
231 pp., $3.95). The 231 pages of
this outrageous novel (on the dust
jacket the word “novel” bears an
asterisk
for a footnote; the
foot-
note reads “a harmless untruth”)
contain no less than 127 chapters.
Some have such titles as Commu-
nists, Nazis, Royalists, Parachut-
ists and Draft Dodgers and run
all of nine short paragraphs; yet
the
author
never
deceives
(not
in
this
manner,
anyhow)
and
you’ll
find
the
chapter
does
in-
deed
deal
with
Communists,
Nazis,
etc.,
etc. Throughout
the
book
are
quotations
from
a
skewed gospel called The Books
of Bokonon, which may just pos-
sibly be Vonnegut’s
impertinent
way
of demanding who’s
to say
whose gospels are skewed? “Live
by
the
foma,”
says
Bokonon,
“that make you brave and kind
and
healthy and
happy.” Foma
are harmless untruths.
The
narrative
on
which
the
book’s appalling, hilarious, shock-
ing
and
infuriating
events
and
characters are strung deals with
a
great
scientist, now
dead,
the
search for biographic material by
a free-lance writer, his encounter
with the
scientist’s past employ-
ers,
acquaintances
and
fellow-
townspeople, and his children: an
angry midget, an
ugly daughter
who plays fabulous
clarinet, and
a moral degenerate who has be-
come the weak power behind the
meaningless throne
of a tropical
island
called San
Lorenzo. The
writer
goes
to
San
Lorenzo
spurred
primarily by
a Sunday
supplement
picture
of the ward
of the dictator, the most beautiful
girl in the word. He finds himself
affianced to her; and how would
you feel
if your beloved’s idea of
you-know-what was
to
take
off
your shoes, and you take
off her
shoes, and there you
sit with the
soles
of
your
feet
pressing
to-
gether in ecstasy?
Along
with
these
highest
of
jinks
goes
the
grim
specter
of
Ice-nine, a scientific development
of horrendous proportions, about
which
I
will
say not
one more
word.
I
will and must
say, how-
ever,
that
this
is
an
annoying
book, and you must read
it.
And you better take
it
lightly,
because
if you don’t you’ll go off
weeping and shoot
yourself.
