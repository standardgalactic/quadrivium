INTRODUCTION 
Part I: 
Readings in Book IT 
The story line continues from Book I with Dicaeopolis and Philip's ar-
rival by boat at Epidaurus and their visit to the sacred precinct of Asclepius. 
In the early chapters of Book II the tail readings continue the saga of the Per-
sian Wars. The Classical Greek readings continue with a variety of au-
thors, including Theognis, Tyrtaeus~ Solon, Resiod, and Xenophanes; the 
New Testament readings in Book II are drawn from the Gospel of John. 
When Dicaeopolis and Philip return to Athens, the Peloponnesian War 
breaks out, and some of the chapter and tail readings are adapted from 
Thucydides' account of this war between Sparta and Athens. While in 
Athens, Philip attends school, and the teacher 
him the historian 
Herodotus to read, and the stories in the middle part of Book II are taken from 
some of the most memorable episodes of Herodotus's history, dealing with the 
Athenian Solon's visit to Croesus, King of Lydia, and the latter's ill-fated at-
tempt to conquer the empire of Persia, ruled by Cyrus. This section ends with 
extracts from a beautiful poem by Bacchylides about Apollo's rescue of Croe-
sus. The opening lines of Homer's Iliad and Odyssey are given toward the 
end of this section, and the last two chapters contain extracts from Thucy-
dides on two crucial naval battles in the Peloponnesian War and extracts 
from Aristophanes' Acharnians, in which you will see Dicaeopolis making 
own peace with the Spartans. The Greek Wisdom strand continues in 
Book II with sayings from the early Greek philosopher Heraclitus and ends 
in Chapter 29 with material on Socrates. You may find some links here with 
the sayings of the seven wise men of Archaic Greece included in Book I. A 
rich variety of reading awaits you in Book II. 
Partll: 
Greek Verbs 
The material here will expand on the Preview of New Verb Forms in 
Book I, pages 154-155. It will provide additional information that will help 
you find your way around the charts on the following pages and give you a 
firm structure within which you can situate the new tenses and moods that 
you will study in the second half of this course. 
You are not expected to learn all of the forms in the charts on pages x-xiv 
and xvi-xvii right away. You should begin by locating the forms that were 
formally presented in Book 1. These include all of the forms except those of 
the subjunctive and optative on the first four charts (pages x-xiii). In Chapter 
16 you learned that middle and passive forms are identical in the present and 
imperfect tenses and that they are different in the future and aorist. Thus on 
vii 

viii 
Athenaze: Book II 
the second chart you will find the middle/passive forms of ",firo in the present 
and imperfect tenses, but on the fourth chart you will find only the middle 
voice forms of ",{jill in the future and aorist. The fifth chart (page xiv) shows 
the passive forms of ",firo in the future and aorist, and you will learn these 
forms in Chapter 17. 
The new material on verb forms in Book II is organized as follows: 
1. The aorist and future passive in Chapter 17 
2. A group of verbs that end in -flt in the 1st person singular, present in-
dicative in Chapters 18, 19, and 20 (you have already learned two such 
verbs, Eifll and dfll.) 
3. The subjunctive mood (Chapter 21) 
4. The optative mood (Chapter 25) 
5. The perfect and pluperfect tenses (Chapters 27 and 28) 
You already know from the verb charts that you filled out during your study of 
Greek in Book I where the subjunctive and optative forms fit into the charts, 
and you will find the forms of the subjunctive and optative on the charts on the 
following pages. The forms of the perfect and pluperfect tenses are organized 
on the last two charts (pages xvi-xvii). You should be pleased that you al-
ready know about half of the forms on these seven chartsf 
partm: 
Moods, Verbal NoUllS, and Verbal Adjectives 
Greek verbs have four moods, indicative, imperative, subjunctive, and 
optative, which express the manner in which the action of the verb is con-
ceived by the speaker or writer. In the readings you have seen many verbs in 
the indicative mood, the mood used to express statements and questions about 
reality or fact. You have also seen many verbs in the imperative mood, the 
mood used to express commands. So far you have seen only 2nd person im-
peratives, e.g., "Xanthias, lift the stone!" or "Oxen, drag the plow!" Greek 
also has 3rd person imperative forms, not addressed directly to the person 
who is to do the action but to someone efse, e.g., "Let Xanthias do it!" "Let the 
oxen drag the plow!" You will find examples of these in the reading in Chap-
ter 30, but they are not included on the charts. 
In addition to verbs in the indicative or imperative mood, you have seen 
infinitives, which are verbal nouns and are not limited (-fin- is from the 
Latin word finis that means "end" or "limit") by person or number and that fit 
into a sentence pattern such as "I am not able to work." You have also seen 
many participles, which are verbal adjectives that fit into sentence patterns 
such as the following: "The man working in the field lifted the stone." 
In Book II you will learn two new moods, the SUbjunctive and the optative. 
In main clauses these do not express simple statements or questions about re-
ality or fact but instead fit into sentence patterns such as "What are we to do?" 
or "I wish I had my sight restored!" They are also used in various types of 
subordinate clauses. Subordinate clauses that require these moods will gen-

Introduction 
ix 
erally use the subjunctive if the verb of the main clause is in a primary tense 
(present, future, or perfect) and the optative if the verb of the main clause is in 
a secondary tense (imperfect, aorist, or pluperfect). 
Occasionally you will meet subjunctive and optative forms in the stories 
before they are formally introduced in the grammar. These forms are very 
easy to recognize. Most verbs in the subjunctive have the long vowels ro or 1'\ 
before the ending (find examples in the charts on the following pages). The 
optative has the suffix -1- or -t11-, which combines with other vowels in the 
verb to give forms that are immediately recognizable by the diphthongs 01, en, 
or ql or the long-vowel digraph £1 (again, find examples in the charts on the 
following pages). Help with translation of subjunctive and optative forms in 
the stories before these moods are formally introduced will be given in the 
glosses below the paragraphs of the stories. 
Part IV: 
Principal Parts 
Once you learn the rules for the formation of the various verb forms, you 
will be able to recognize or make up any and all of the forms on the charts 
yourself if you know six basic forms of any given verb. These six forms are 
called the principal parts, and they are as follows: 
present active 
A.{)ro 
perfect active 
A.EA.U1(X 
future active 
A.{)(Jro 
perfect middle/passive 
A.EA.U~(Xt 
The other forms are constructed as follows: 
aorist active 
€A.ucro: 
aorist passive 
fA.u8Ttv 
The imperfect is constructed from the present stem: e-A.u-o-v. 
The present, future, and aorist middle are constructed from the corre.,. 
sponding active stems: A.-G-o-j.tcn, A.-Gcr-o-~o:t, e-A.ucra-Jl11v. 
The future passive is constructed from the aorist passive stem: A.u8,,-cr-0-

The principal parts of many verbs follow simple patterns, so that if you 
know the first principal part (the present active indicative) you can construct 
the remaining principal parts according to rules, many of which you have al-
ready learned. Many verbs, however, follow more complex linguistic pat-
terns, so that their principal parts cannot all be predicted on the basis of easy 
rules. In some verbs the stem appears in different forms in the different 
tenses; for example, in the forms of the verb A..nm given above you can see two 
slightly different stems, /1/0- and Au-. A knowledge of stems is useful, as you 
already know from Book 1. A few common verbs use etymologically unre-
lated stems to supply missing forms. For example, the verb aipEw does not 
have an aorist related to the stem aipe- but instead uses the unrelated stem 
£11,- to supply the missing aorist. The other principal parts of this verb are 
regular (except for £. instead of the expected 11 in the aorist passive): 
aipeOl 
elA.OV 
For convenience grammarians say that the stems of this verb are aipE- and 
£11,-. Note that verbs such as this that begin with a vowel or diphthong have a 
temporal augment instead of reduplication in the perfect tense. Verbs that be-
gin with certain consonants or consonant clusters will have syllabic aug-
ment instead of reduplication, e.g., 0'1tE:6~w, perfect, EO"1tE1YKa. 
In Book I from Chapter 10 on we gave the present, future, and aorist of 
most verbs in vocabulary lists, and we included the aorist participle to show 
the unaugmented aorist stem. In Book II we will give in the chapter vocabu-
lary lists full sets of principal parts for most verbs. We will not give the prin-
cipal parts of regular contract verbs that follow the patterns of the model con-
tract verbs qnAEOl, 'ttl .. UXW, and 81lAow; for the principal parts of these model 
verbs, see the Greek to English Vocabulary at the end of this book. We also do 
not usually give the principal parts of compound verbs, for which the princi-
pal parts of the simple verb have already been given; consult the Greek to En-
glish Vocabulary as necessary . We stop giving aorist participles, but we will 
occasionally include other forms, such as the imperfect, when they deserve 
special attention. 
Mter the reading passages we will give full sets of principal parts of im-
portant verbs, most of which you met in Book I. These sets are arranged ac-
cording to certain linguistic principles to help you see similarities among 
verbs and organize them into helpful groupings in your own mind. Seeing 
the similarities and shared patterns will make it easier for you to learn the 
principal parts.

GRAMMAR 
1. The Passive Voice: -911- 1st Aorist Passive and -911- 1st Future 
Pwmve 
' 
In Chapter 16 you learned that in the present and the imperfect tenses 
the middle and passive voices have identical forms. In the aorist and 
future tenses the passive voice has forms different from those of the mid-
dle. In the reading passage above you met several aorist passive forms, 
easily identified by the presence of the letters 8il, e.g., e8ten uno 'troy 
ValYcrov (1-2), was tied by the sailors. 
To form the aorist passive, most verbs add -eil-1-eE- to the verb stem, 
with the 3rd person singular ending in -ail as in the example above. The 
indicative is augmented. The resulting forms are called -81]- 1st aorist 
passives to distinguish them from a slightly different formation of aorist 
passives called -1]- 2nd aorist passives that add only -1'\- or -E- to the 
verb stem and will be presented in Grammar 2, page 13.

Stems ending in ~, It, y, and K aspirate the last consonant in forming the 
-811- 1st aorist passive and the -911- 1st future passive, e.g.:

Athenaze: Book II 
Heating Sanctuaries: 
Asclepius and Epidaurus 
According to legend, Asclepius was the son of Apollo, god of healing, and 
a mortal girl, Coronis, who was unfaithful to him. Apollo sent his sister 
Artemis to punish her with death, but, as she lay on the pyre and the flames 
flickered around her body, Apollo snatched from her womb the unborn baby, 
his son. He gave him to the wise old centaur Cheiron to bring up and told him 
to teach the child to heal men of their sicknesses. 
And all who came to him suffering from sores caused by nature, or whose 
limbs were wounded by gray bronze or the far-flung stone, or whose 
bodies were wasting from summer's heat or winter's cold, he freed from 
their various pains and cured. Some he treated with soft incantations, 
some with soothing medicines, on the limbs of others he put healing 
ointments, and yet others he made straight with the surgeon's knife. 
(Pindar, Pythian 3.47-53). 
In the end Asclepius attempted to restore the dead to life, and Zeus in anger 
struck him down with a thunderbolt. 
In time the status of the mortal hero rose to reach that of a god, and shrines 
were dedicated to him throughout Greece as the preserver of health and healer 
of sickness, a god who loved mankind, their savior. Of all the sanctuaries of 
Asclepius, the greatest was at Epidaurus. Here, in an undulating valley, sur~ 
rounded by mountains, was a site that had been holy from times 
immemorial, sacred first to a local hero, then to Apollo, and finally to Apollo 
and Asclepius. The cult of Asclepius seems to have arrived there early in the 
fifth century, and by the end of the century the sanctuary was visited by 
pilgrims from all over the Greek world. 
Pilgrims arriving at the port and city of Epidaurus had a walk of five 
miles or eight kilometers to reach the sanctuary, through a deep ravine, cut by 
a stream, where wild olive and plane trees and laurel abounded. They ar-
rived at last at a splendid entrance building resembling a temple, on the 
gates of which they saw this inscription: 
b:yvQV XP1, vuoio 9'\)ro6eo~ evtot; i6v'Cc:x 
E!1IlEVc:xt· ayvda 5' EO''tt CPPOVEtV oena. 
He must be pure who enters the fragrant 
shrine; purity is thinking holy thoughts. 
Most of the buildings of which the remains can be seen today were built in 
the fourth century when the cult of Asclepius was at its height, but there would 
have been humbler versions of the most important buildings there when 
Philip visited the sanctuary. In the center stood the temple of Asclepius him-
self and close to it the &~a'tov 
I a long, narrow building in which patients seek-
ing a cure had to sleep the night; opposite this was the 9 OA.Ot; , a round building 
that was probably the home of the sacred serpents. To the west of the main

sanctuary lay the stadium, to the southeast the Ka'[aywylOv, a large square 
building, where the pilgrims stayed, and beyond this on the hillside the great 
theater, for which Epidaurus is now most famous. Procession, choral dance, 
and sacrifice took place throughout the year, and every four years there was a 
great festival with athletic, dramatic, and musical competitions. 
The procedure for consulting Asclepius was simple: patients first had to 
purify themselves by ritual washing and to make an offering (often a honey-
cake). When night came they were conducted to the a~a1:ov and waited for the 
god to appear while they slept. The walls of the temple were covered with 
tablets set up by grateful patients; the cure we ascribe to Philip is taken from 
one of these. Here is the record of another cure of blindness, set up by a patient 
who had been a sceptic: 
Ambrosia of Athens, blind in one eye. She came as a suppliant to the god, 
but walking around the sanctuary, she scoffed at some of the cures as in-
credible and impossible, that the lame and blind should be made whole, 
merely by seeing a vision in their sleep. But she, in her sleep, saw a vi-
sion. It seemed to her that the god stood over her and announced that he 
would cure her but that, in payment, he would ask her to present to the 
sanctuary a pig made of silver as a reminder of her ignorance. After 
saying this, he cut open her diseased eye and poured in some drug. When 
day dawned, she went out cured. (Stele 1.33-41). 
Many were sceptical of the whole business, like Cicero, who said: "Few 
patients owe their lives to Asclepius rather than Hippocrates." The reputation 
of the sanctuary, however, continued to attract pilgrims for hundreds of 
years, and it is impossible to believe that all the cures recorded by grateful 
patients were mere fictions.

2. The Passive Voice: -11- 2nd Aorist Passive and -11- 2nd Future 
Passive 
Some verbs add -11-1-£- instead of -8n-i-8E- to form their aorist pas-
sives and -11- instead of -811- to form their future passives; we call these 
-11- 2nd aorist passives and -11- 2nd future passives. The endings are the 
same as for the -811- 1st aorist and -811- 1st future passives. Here are 
some examples: 
ypaq>oo, I write 
Aorist: 
E-ypacp-11-v 
~ture: ypaq>-Tt-cr-o-Ilat 
Dta-cp8£tpru, I destroy [cp8ap-] 
Aorist:

cpatVOllat, I appear [cpav-] 
Aorist:

3.. Aorist of Deponent Verbs 
Most deponent verbs have their aorist in the middle voice, e.g., 
yiyvollat, aorist ey£volll1V. These may be called middle deponents. A few 
deponent verbs, however, have aorists that are passive instead of middle 
in form, as does 1tOpeUOIl(U in the list of verbs with their principal parts 
given above, aorist, £1tOP£U811V, I marched, journeyed, and as does q>atVOllat 

14 
Athenaze: Book II 
(Grammar 2 above), aorist E<pa.VllV, I appeared. Here are some other depo-
nent verbs that have their aorist in the passive voice: 
~OUAO)la.l, aorist, e~01)A.Tt911V, I wanted; I wished 
OUVIl)l<ll, aorist, eo'Uv,;911V, I was able 
En tcr't<l)lUt , aorist, ft7tlotit911v, I understood; I knew 
oPI'tSO)l<lt, aorist, roPY10911V, I grew angry 
These may be called passive deponents. 
Note this example from the story above: 
... npoc; 'tllV 'En:ioa.upov 7topeu9i\vat. (27) 
... to go to Epidaurus. 
Some deponent verbs have both aorist middle and aorist passive forms, 
e.g.: 
Ota.AEI'O)l<ll, aorist middle, 8t£le~aJ.l:T(v, I talked to, conversed with, 
aorist passive, OteA£x91lv, I talked to, conversed with 
The verb xutpm, I rejoice, has its aorist in the passive, £XciPl1V, I rejoiced.

Exercise 178 
Translate into Greek: 
1. The Spartans, who were holding a festival at this time, were not will-
ing to go out against (£1t£~t£vat Efd + ace.) the Persians but were 
still delaying (EJ.L£A.lov). 
2. And finally the messengers of the Athenians said: "On the one hand 
you, the Spartans, are betraying (xpoiHBo1:E) your allies, and on the 
other hand the Athenians, wronged (use aOt1C£Ol, I wrong) by you, 
will make a peace treaty with (rcpoc; + ace.) the Persians. 
3. "Then having made a peace treaty and having become allies of the 
Persians (dat.), we will wage war with them against (btl + ace.) the 
Peloponnesus. 
4. "Then indeed you will learn by suffering (having suffered) that you 
ought not betray (n;pooouvcu) your allies." 
5. And finally, fearing these words, the Spartans sent their army to At-
tica.

1. The Verbs 8UimJ.Lt and 'C{811llt 
These verbs have both long- and short-vowel stems: 
S{3ro~.Lt: long-vowel stem 3ro-; short-vowel stem 30-
1:i811llt: long-vowel stem 811-; short-vowel stem 8E-
Si-oro-Ill, amaro, e8ro'lCCl, of8co'lCCl, SeOO).1Clt, i:869Tlv, I give 
t1-8Tl-).1t, 9naro, e9TllCcx, te9T}lCcx, ('tE8£tllat; Ket~H1t usually used in-
stead), £"Ce911v, I put, place 
In the present and imperfect the stems are reduplicated, i.e., the first 
consonant of the stem (with 9 becoming t by dissimilation, for which, see 
below) + t is put before the stem. The personal endings are then added 
straight to the stem with no thematic vowel in between. 
N ate that in the present and aorist active the long-vowel stem is used 
in the singular forms. In the imperfect some of the forms in the singular 
show contractions with the short stem vowel. 
The future active and future middle of 
verbs are formed in the 
usual manner, and full sets of their forms are not included in the charts. 
The aorist and future passive have their usual endings, and full sets 
of their forms are not included in the charts. Note, however, that for the 
aorist passive of 1:tenl-U, what would be expected to be e-9E-911-v becomes e-
'tE-911-v by dissimilation, i.e., change of 9 to 1: to avoid two aspirated con-
sonants in neighboring syllables. 
The forms of 'ti9mn will be presented in the second half of this chapter. 
Greek Wisdom 
Greek Wisdom in Book II includes the presocratic philosopher Heraclitus 
of Ephesus (fl. 500 B.C.), deemed "lofty-minded beyond all other men," and 
Socrates of Athens (Chapter 29). A saying of Heraclitus:

Sparta and Corinth 
In the chaos following the breakdown of Bronze Age civilization in the 
Eastern Mediterranean (ca. 1200 B ,C,), there were widespread migrations. 
New peoples entered Greece and Asia Minor from north of the civilized world 
and either pushed out or merged with the previous population. In Greece the 
newcomers were Greeks who spoke a different dialect, Doric, and this move-
ment is traditionally called the Dorian invasion, although it probably took 
the form of sporadic raids over a long period of time rather than an organized 
invasion. When the dust settled, the whole of the Peloponnesus except the cen-
tral plateau of Arcadia was occupied by Doric speakers. 
Dorians calling themselves Lacedaemonians were settled in the fertile 
valley of the Eurotas by 1,000 B.C. and by about 850 B.C. four or five villages 
united to form the polis of Sparta. As its population increased, Sparta gradu-
ally conquered her neighbors to the north and east, reducing them to depen-
dent status; the conquered were called TCEptotKOt. They had local autonomy but 
were obliged to serve in the Spartan army. About 735 B.C., when other states 
were about to solve their population problem by sending out colonies, Sparta 
crossed the mountain range of Taygetus and in a war lasting twenty years 
conquered Messenia. The inhabitants were reduced to the status of serfs, 
called helots (etA.o.:rte<;), who worked the land for their Spartan masters. 
This conquest determined the future history of Sparta. Up to this time her 
development had been not unlike that of other Greek states, except that she had 
retained a monarchy, or rather a dyarchy, since she had two hereditary 
kings coming from two separate royal families. Within fifty years of the 
conquest of Messenia she had developed into a totalitarian military state 
quite different from any other in Greece. The reason for this was the absolute 
necessity of dominating the helots, who outnumbered the Spartans by seven to 
one and revolted whenever the opportunity occurred. 
Sometime in the seventh century there was a revolution in Sparta caused 
partly by economic factors (the new wealth produced by the conquest of Messe-
nia) and partly by military reorganization (the introduction of the hoplite 
phalanx). Both developments gave more importance to the ordinary Spartan 
and challenged the authority of kings and nobles. The outcome was a revised 
constitution, ascribed to a lawgiver called Lycurgus. The kings were ad-
vised by a council of elders, all aged over sixty, the Gerousia. The ancient 
assembly of all the Spartans, the Apella, was given the final authority, i.e., 
the right to accept or rej ect proposals put by the Gerousia. In addition there 
were five officials called ephors (£cpOpOl, overseers), elected by the whole citi-

zen body, whose function was to guard the rights of the people in its relation 
with the kings. 
The other feature of the Lycurgan reforms was the aywyrt (training); this 
was the system by which every male Spartan was trained to devote his life to 
service in the army. At birth the child was inspected by the heads of his tribe, 
and, if the child was weak or unhealthy, it was exposed on Mount Taygetus 
and left to die. At seven the boy began his education in the state school, where 
the whole training was aimed at discipline, endurance, and patriotism. At 
twenty he joined the army and might marry but continued to live in 
barracks. At thirty he became a man and joined the ranks of the DjlOLOt 
(equals) but continued to dine in the public mess with his fellow soldiers. 
In 660 B.C. Sparta, still trying to extend her territory northward, suffered 
a severe defeat at the hands of her northern neighbor, Argos. Soon after this 
the helots rose in revolt, no doubt supported by Argos. There followed a long 
and bitter war, from which Sparta eventually emerged victorious. By the end 
of the century Argive power had declined. Sparta became the dominant power 
in the Peloponnesus and enrolled all the states except Argos in a loose confed-
eracy called the Peloponnesian League. 
The other Greeks either admired Sparta for her stability (euvoj.liii) or hated 
her for her oppressive and xenophobic regime. Nevertheless, Sparta was rec-
ognized as the most powerful state in Greece. 
The polis of Corinth was formed from a union of seven villages perhaps 
about 800 B.C., and, when she emerges into the light of history, we find her 
ruled by a Dorian clan, the Bacchiadae. Her position on the Isthmus, at the 
very center of Greece with ports on both seas, assured her future as a commer-
cial city. Under the Bacchiadae she founded the earliest colonies in the West 
(except for Ischia) at Corcyra and Syracuse (734 B.C.); she led the way in im-
provements in the design of ships and in the manufacture of pottery. The dis-
tinctive Corinthian ware was exported all over the Greek world and beyond 
in the eighth and seventh centuries. 
About 650 B.C. the Bacchiadae were overthrown and driven out by 
Cypselus. He was the first of many Greek tyrants, a word which did not have 
its present connotations but simply meant one who seized power unconstitu-
tionally. The tyrants often won power as champions of the people against the 
oppression of the nobles and were the product of economic and military devel-
opments similar to those that occasioned the revolution at Sparta. Under 
Cypselus and his son Peri ander, Corinth flourished and became the leading 
maritime and commercial state. His regime became bloody and oppressive, 
as conspiracies drove him to suspect all citizens of wealth and influence. He 
died in 585 B.C., and his successor was assassinated within a few years. 
From then on Corinth was ruled by an oligarchy (which means rule by the 
few: in Corinth's case, the wealthy merchants). ,', . 
Corinth remained one of the most prosperous states of Greece, achieving 
by the fifth century a near monopoly of western trade. When Athens began to 
rival Corinth in the West, Corinth had every reason to fear her ambitions.

GRAMMAR 
1. The Genitive Absolute 
Examine the following sentence: 
96:A.1tovtOC; 'tou T,A.{ou, uno i;) ... &"q. £1c&91lv'to. 
Since the sun was hot, they were sitting under an olive tree. 
The words in boldface consist of a participle and a noun in the genitive 
case. This phrase has no grammatical relationship to the rest of the sen-
tence, i.e., the participle does not modify any element such as the subject, 
the direct object, or the indirect object of the main clause. This use of a 
participle with a noun or pronoun in the genitive case is called a genitive 
absolute. The term absolute comes from a Latin word meaning 
"separated" or "independent," and genitive absolutes are grammatically 
separate from the rest of the sentence in which they occur. Here are other 
examples: 
oi>8evoc; l:sv'coc; 1t,.L1V apY1lp{ou, oinc E~EO''ttV 'hIlLv Ka1a 9&Acx't1av OtKaO£ 
voO''tEtv. 
There being no money for us or Since we have no money, it is not pos~ 
sible for us to return home by sea. 
l) Ju!.pac; YEVO JlevllC;, 6 n:cx'tl1P 'tOY n:cxiocx KCXArEcrti<; E1tEI.L\J1E m<; Sll'tTtcrOV'tCX 
-en 1tp6~cx'tcx. 
When day came or When day had come or At daybreak, the father, 
calling his son, sent him to seek the sheep. 
In this sentence, the phrase 'hIlEpiiC; YEvoIlEVn<; is absolute, i.e., not part of the 
structure of the rest of the sentence, whereas the participle KaAEcrii<; agrees 
with n:CX1TtP, the subject in the main clause, and the participle sn'tTtcrov'tcx 
agrees with rc:alocx, the direct object in the main clause. 
With regard to aspect, present participles describe progressive} ongo-
ing action contemporaneous with the action of the main verb in the sen-
tence (see Book I, Chapter 8, Grammar 1, page 115). Thus, in the sentence 
above, 8aA.7tov1:oC; "tou f)A.{ou, uno eA&'q. eK&91lv'to, a present participle is 
used in the genitive absolute, but it is translated into English as a past 
progressive, Since the sun was hot, indicating ongoing action contempo-
raneous with the imperfect tense of the main verb, EKa9nv'to, they were sit-
ting. Compare the sentence oi>8evoc; l:SVtOc; tULtV apY1lp{ou, OUK E~t(Jnv 
'hIlLv K'cx'ta S&AIY't'tCXV OtKCXOE voO''tctV, and its English translation, Since we 
have no money, it is not possible for us to return home by sea. 
With regard to aspect, the aorist participle in a genitive absolute ex-
presses simple action (see Book I, Chapter 11, Grammar 3d, pages 179-
180). Thus, the genitive absolute with its participle in the aorist in the 
sentence f)Jlepii; YEvoJ1EVl1c;, 6 1tcx'tTtP 10V 1taLocx KCXA,£cra~ E1tEIl'l'EV 
m~ 
Sll'tncrov'tcx 'to. 1tp6~cx'[cx may be translated simply When day came or even 
more simply, At daybreak. However, aorist participles in genitive abso-

lutes may often be translated into English so as to indicate time before the 
action of the main verb, e.g., When day had come, the fatherJ calling his 
sonJ sent him to seek the sheep. 
Genitive absolutes can often best be translated into English with 
clauses beginning with "since," "as," "when," or "although." The choice 
of which introductory word to use will usually be clear from the meaning 
of the sentence as a whole, but sometimes a word such as K:atTC£P, although, 
will provide a helpful clue.

2. The Verb 10"tTH.l1: Formation and Meaning 
This verb has both long-vowel [cHll-] and short-vowel [ata-] stems. 
iO''t11 1.11., 0't,,0'0), sigmatic 1st aorist, eo't11O'tt, athematic 2nd aorist, 
e01:11V, ecr't11lCa, 80'ta911V, I make to stand; I stop; I set (up); athe-
matic 2nd aorist, intransitive, I stood; I stood still; I stopped; perfect, 
intransitive, I stand 
You have already studied the athematic 2nd aorist of this verb (ecr1:1l.v, I 
stood) in Chapter 15, and you have seen many examples of it in the read-
ings. 
Formation of the Active: 
Present: t-a'tl1-llt 
Imperfect: t-O'1:Il-V 
Future: m:ll-Cf-ro 
Sigmatic 1st aorist: e-(r'tll-cra 
Athematic 2nd aorist: e-cr'tl1-v 
The present and imperfect are formed by putting t- (reduplication: 
0'1-, cf. Latin sistO) before the stem and adding the personal endings, e.g., 

40 
Athenaze: Book II 
t~cr'TI\-).u. In the imperfect the i- augments to 
In both the present and the 
imperfect, the long-vowel stem (cr't'l1-) is used in the singular, and in the 
plural, the short (cr'ta-). Compare bt-bm-J.Ll and 'ti-91l-lll. 
The future cr'tll-crm is formed regularly, as is the sigmatic 1st aorist e-
cr't'l1-cra. 
Meaning of the Active: 
Forms in the active voice in the present, imperfect, future, and sig-
matic 1st aorist are transitive and take direct objects. They mean make 
to stand, stop, or set up, e.g.: 
onate; 'tOY K\lVa tcr'tl1crtV.

The boy is stopping his dog. 
The boy was stopping his dog. 
The boy will stop his dog. 
The boy stopped his dog. 
The sailor set up the mast. 
The athematic 2nd aorist, ecr1:llv, means I stood) stood still, stopped, 
and the perfect, EcrTllKa, means I stand. These forms are intransitive and 
do not take direct objects, e.g.: 
6 lCumv £cr1:11. The dog stood still / stopped. 
n YUVT, 1tpOC; -ril KprWn ecrtl1KeV. The woman stands near the spring. 
Formation of the Middle:

Imperfect: l-crta-Jll1v 
Future: cr1:11-cr-o-J.Lat 
Sigmatic 1st aorist: E-cr'tll-crO:-J.L'l1V 
Athematic 2nd aorist: none 
Meaning of the Middle: 
The present, imperfect, future, and sigmatic 1st aorist middle may be 
used transitively, e.g.: 
cpuAaKae; icrtO:J.LE9a. 
We are setting up) i.e., posting, guards. 
cpuAaKct<; 1crtalJ,£9a. 
We were setting up, i.e., posting, guards. 
cpuActKac; crtl1aoJle9a. 
We will set up, i.e., post, guards. 
qruACXKct<; Ecr'tl1cralJ,e9ct. 
We set up, i.e., posted, guards. 
The middle voice implies that the action is performed in the interests 
of the subject, i. e., here, for ourselves / for our protection. 
The present, imperfect, and future middle may also be used intransi-
tively, e.g.: 
icr1:alJ,e9a. 
lcr'talle9a. 
cr't1laolJ,e8a. 
We are standing / standing still I stopping. 
We were standing/standing still I stopping.

N.B.: The sigmatic 1st aorist middle is not used intransitively; the 
athematic 2nd aorist active is used instead, e.g.: 
We stood I stood still I stopped. 
Passive forms are translated exactly as you would expect, e.g., the 
aorist passive BO"'tUSllV means I was set (up).

Athenaze: Book II 
On their return journey overland, Philip and his father visit the famous ruins of 
Mycenae, which were not far off their route. The lion gate to the citadel is shown here. 
Mycenae 
Mycenae stands on a hill skirted by two deep ravines. The site is a nat-u-
ral strong point, dominating the plain of Argos. It was first occupied about 
3,000B.C., and a new settlement was made about 2,000 B.C., which is gener-
ally believed to be the time when Greek speakers arrived in Greece. There is 
clear evidence for a sudden increase in the importance and prosperity of this 
settlement about 1,600 B.C.; two grave circles have been found, one inside the 
later walls and containing six shaft graves, excavated by Schliemann in the 
1870s, the other rather earlier in date, outside the walls, discovered in 1950. 
These graves contained a mass of gold and other precious objects of great 
beauty, including imports from Minoan Crete and Egypt. 
The power and wealth of Mycenae increased rapidly. There was soon a 
uniform culture in mainland Greece, stretching from Thessaly in the north 
to the south of the Peloponnesus, with palaces at Thebes, Athens, Mycenae, 
Tiryns, and Pylos and probably at other sites not yet discovered. Although the 
palaces were the administrative centers of separate kingdoms, it seems 
likely that Mycenae was the leading, if not the dominant, kingdom. From 
1500 B.C. the kings of Mycenae were buried in massive stone tombs outside 
the walls, of which the largest, the so-called Treasury of Atreus, is a magnifi-
cent architectural achievement. 
About 1450 B.C. the Achaeans, as the Greeks of the Mycenaean period were 
called, invaded Crete and destroyed all the Minoan palaces except Knossos, 
which they occupied. Succeeding to Minoan control of the seas, the Achaeans

now traded widely throughout the Eastern Mediterranean and made settle-
ments on the islands and in Asia Minor. The zenith of Mycenaean power 
and prosperity was in the early thirteenth century; in this period were built 
the walls, some of which still stand, and the lion gate. By about 1250 B. C ., 
when the defenses were renewed and improved, there is evidence of 
destruction outside the walls. Trade declined; a period of upheaval and 
deterioration had begun. The Trojan War is thought to have occurred about 
this time. The traditional date for the fall of Troy is 1184 B.C., but the 
American archaeologist Blegen, who made the most complete recent 
excavations and found clear evidence of a prolonged siege, dates the 
destruction of Troy to about 1240 B.C. It looks as though the Trojan expedition 
was the last united effort of the Achaeans. 
Mycenae was subjected to three successive attacks in the following years. 
In the first, the houses outside the walls were destroyed; in the second, the cit-
adel was sacked; in the third, it was finally destroyed and not reoccupied. 
The other mainland palaces were all sacked around 1200 B.C., presumably 
by bands of invading Dorians. 
The entrance to the Treasury of Atreus

Athenaze: Book II 
During the Dark Ages a new settlement was made on the site of Mycenae, 
which developed into a miniature polis; this sent a small contingent to fight 
at Plataea, but in 468 B.C. it was attacked and destroyed by Argos. When 
Philip visited it in our story, the site was abandoned; the massive walls and 
the lion gate still stood, but the rest was overgrown and undisturbed until 
Schliemann arrived in 1876. 
Around Mycenae centered one of the most important cycles of Greek 
myth. The royal house of Mycenae was doomed. Its founder had been Pelops. 
His father Tantalus wanted to find out whether the gods were really omni-
scient. He killed his own child Pelops and served him up to the gods at a 
feast; none of the gods would touch the meat except for Demeter, who was dis-
tracted by grief and ate part of his shoulder. The gods restored him to life and 
replaced his missing shoulder with one of ivory. When he had grown up, he 
wooed Hippodamia, daughter of Oenomaus. In order to win her hand, he had 
to beat her father in a chariot race. He bribed Oenomaus's charioteer to re-
move the linchpin of the axle. In the race, Oenomaus was thrown and killed, 
but as he lay dying he cursed Pelops. 
Pelops carried off the dead king's daughter to Mycenae and founded a dy-
nasty that was unremittingly haunted by the curse. His sons were Atreus and 
Thyestes. Thyestes seduced Atreus' wife, and Atreus banished him. Atreus 
then pretended to be reconciled and invited his brother to a banquet; at this 
feast he served up Thyestes' own children. rrhyestes found a human finger 
in his portion and, realizing what Atreus had done, kicked over the table and 
fled, cursing Atreus and all his family. Thyestes had a son, Aegisthus, by 
his own daughter; together they murdered Atreus. 
Agamemnon succeeded Atreus as king, and when he led the Greeks to 
Troy, he left the kingdom in the care of his wife, Clytemnestra. The Greek 
fleet, however, en route for Troy was held up by unceasing contrary winds. 
The prophet said that these winds would only cease if Agamemnon sacrificed 
his daughter to Artemis. Agamemnon sent for his daughter Iphigenia on the 
pretext that she was to wed Achilles, and with his own hand he cut her throat 
over the altar. 
During Agamemnon's absence, Clytemnestra took Aegisthus as her 
lover and planned vengeance. 
When, after ten years, Agamemnon 
returned, the lovers murdered him, entrapping him in a net while he was in 
the bath. Orestes, the young son of Agamemnon and Clytemnestra, escaped 
into exile, saved by his nurse; the daughters, Chrysothemis and Electra, 
remained in the palace. When Orestes grew to manhood, he consulted 
Apollo's oracle at Delphi and was ordered to avenge his father's murder. He 
returned to Mycenae secretly and with Electra's help murdered both 
Aegisthus and his own mother. He was then pursued by the Furies and took 
refuge at Apollo~s altar. The curse, which had haunted the family through 
four generations, was finally laid to rest when Athena acquitted Orestes of 
bloodguilt on the grounds that he had been ordered by Apollo to perform the 
murders.

War Clouds 
The alliance fDrmed between Sparta and Athens during Xerxes' invasicn 
did nDt last. When the allies rejected the general whcm the Spartans sent to' 
cDmmand the fleet in 478 B.C. and fDrmed the Delian League under Athenian 
leadership, Sparta did nO't demur. HO'wever, she watched the successes Df the 
League and the grO'wth O'f Athenian pcwer with increasing anxiety. In 464 
B.C. there was an earthquake at Sparta, and in the ensuing chaO's the helDts 
revO'lted. The Spartans asked their allies, including Athens, to' send help, 
and the Assembly was persuaded by CimO'n to' send a fO'rce under his CDm-
mand. When this fO'rce failed to' take the helDt strO'nghDld, the Spartans dis-
missed them. 
This rebuff resulted in a vO'lte-face in Athenian pO'licy. As SCDn as CimO'n 
returned (461 B.C.), an cstracism was held, and Cimcn was sent intO' exile fDr 
ten years. Pericles emerged as the dO'minant statesman, a PO'siticn he held 
until his death in 429 B.C. Under his leadership, Athens brO'ke with Sparta,

made an alliance with Argos, and soon became involved in a sporadic war 
with Sparta and her allies, which lasted intermittently for fifteen years. 
On the whole, Athens was successful, and at one time her empire extended 
to include Boeotia and Megara, but she was overextended. In 446 B.C. when 
Euboea and Megara revolted and a Lacedaemonian army advanced to the 
borders of Attica, she was glad to make peace. The Thirty Years' Peace stipu-
lated that each side should respect the other's sphere of influence and not ad-
mit into her alliance an ally of the other. 
There followed a period of peace and retrenchment, during which Peri-
cles eschewed imperialistic adventures, observed the terms of the peace, and 
built up Athenian resources. Sparta and her allies, however, especially 
Corinth, continued to distrust Athens and to fear her ambitions. The Aegean 
and Black Sea were already Athenian preserves; when she began to extend 
her influence in the west, Corinthian fears increased. 
In 433/432 B.C. the Corinthian colony of Corcyra (Corfu) was embroiled in 
a quarrel with her mother city and asked Athens for help. Athens agreed to 
make a defensive alliance, and when Corinth attacked Corcyra an Athenian 
squadron, which had been sent to "observe/' joined in the battle and routed the 
Corinthian fleet. Shortly after this, Potidaea, which was both a colony of 
Corinth and a member of the Athenian Empire, revolted from Athens and 
asked Corinth for help. The Corinthians sent "volunteers," and Athens laid 
siege to the city. 
In late summer 432 B.C., representatives of the Peloponnesian League 
voted that Athens had broken the terms of the peace and that war should be de-
clared. Both sides tried to make the other appear the aggressor. Finally, the 
Spartans sent an ultimatum: "The Lacedaemonians desire peace, and there 
will be peace, if you let the Greeks be independent." Pericles advised the 
Athenians to reject this ultimatum and to call on the Spartans to submit their 
differences to arbitration under the terms of the peace. By now the Pelopon~ 
nesian army was mustered, and in early summer 431 B.C. it invaded Attica. 
Corinth: the site of the ancient city, dominated by the remains of the temple of Apollo

3. Verbs That Take Supplementary Participles: Aav e 
eX v co, "CU'YX uV co, 
,9uvoo, and qHx{VOllcxt 
The verb AavBtlv(O, ATtcrro, EAaBov. AEAnBa, meaning I escape notice, es-
cape the notice of, is used idiomatically with a supplementary participle. 
The participle contains the main idea of the sentence and is usually 
translated with a finite verb, while the form of AavB<iv(O becomes an ad-
verbial phrase. Note these examples from the last paragraph of the read-
ing passage above: 
fAaBov EV 't6:cpp'P 'ttVt lCp'lnvcXIlEVot. 
They hid themselves in a ditch without anyone's noticing (that they 
were doing so). 
I 
, B I 
",\ B 
I 
(, 
nav'tac; av P(OTtOUC; GJ\.<X ov 't<XXE(o<; iellEVOt. 
They quickly hurried, unobserved by everyone. 
Note that in the second example EAaBov takes a direct object, ntlv'Cuc; 
avBpronouc;, lit., they escaped notice of all men. 
Here are two more examples: 
EAaBov etaEAB6vtEC;. 
They entered without being seen. 
EAaB€v Eau'tov 'wu'to 1totTtaac;. 
He did this unawares. 
Some other Greek verbs may also be used with supplementary participles: 
a. 'tuYX<ivro, 'C€u~ollat, E1:UXOV, 'tE'tUXnlC£l, I happen to (of a coincidence) 
I!1:UXOV 1tcxpovtec; 01. 1tpEa~GtC;. 
The ambassadors were present by chance. 
b. cpB6:v(O, cpBftaollUt, eq>9aaa or Eq>9nv, I anticipate; I do something before 
someone else 
eq>96:a£lf,lEv tJlac,; aqnKoJ..LeVOt.

Exercise 20 e 
Translate into Greek: 
1. The Spartans, having heard both the accusations (ta S'Y'ICA.fUla'ta) of 
(their) allies and the words of the Athenians, were debating (use 
POuAEUoJ1at 1tSpt) the matter alone. 
2. Many were saying that the Athenians were acting wrongly (use pre~ 
sent tense of aOl1ceco) and (that) it was necessary (use present tense) 
to wage war immediately. 
3. But Archidamus, being king, advised them not to get into war. 
4. "For," he said, "they have (use dative of the possessor) very much 
money and very many ships. We are not able to defeat them by sea. 
And so we will suffer terribly (use Ka1C& and ltcXGXm) ourselves 
more than we will harm them." 
5. But he was not able to persuade the Spartans, who decided to wage war.

Classical Greek 
Tyrtaeus 
Tyrtaeus of Sparta (fl. 600 B.C.) composed poems to encourage his fellow 
Spartans to fight bravely in the war against the rebelling Messenians (see es-
say in Chapter 18). In this poem (12, of which we give lines 23-24,27-28, and 
31-32) he says that the only virtue that matters is courage in war.

GRAMMAR 
1. The SubjWlctive Mood 
Verbs in the subjunctive mood are used in certain types of main and 
subordinate clauses (see Grammar 3). Subjunctives are usually very 
easy to recognize from the long vowels m or 11, which occur in all forms, 
except when obscured in some forms of the contract verbs. Here are some 
sentences with subjunctives taken from the reading passage above: 
a. 
EUeU~ 01)V tJ1CEUbm.JlEV 1tpo<; 'tljV 1tOAtV. 
Let us hurry immediately to the city. 
b. cr1tEUOOJlEV to{YCOU EVEKa, tva tv 't11 EKKAllcrtg tmv Pl1'tOProv CtlCOUm.JlEV. 
We are hurrying for this reason, so that we may hear the speakers in 
the Assembly, 
C. notEpOv 1tOAEJlOV 1COtl1adtJlE9u 1tpOC; tOUe; ITEA01tOVvl1crtOUe; +\ etpnVllV am-
aOlJlEV; 
Should we make war against the Peloponnesians Dr should we keep 
peace? 
2. Fonns of the SubjWlctive 
There are no imperfect or future subjunctives. 
The subjunctive of dJll, I am, is as follows: ril, n-~, n, ril-JlEV, ~-'tE, c1-
crt(v). These same letters are used to form other active subjunctives, as 
seen in the charts below.

3. Uses of the Subjunctive Mood 
a. The subjunctive (usually 1st person plural) is used in exhortations, as 
in example a in Grammar 1 above (page 75). This is called the horta-
tory subjunctive, and its negative is Ilf\, e.g.: 
av3pe{roc; llaxcOJ,1£9a. Let us fight bravely. 
Ill, euSue; iWIlEV. Let us not go immediately. 
Ill-} tOtOu'to nOl'riawllEv. Let us not do such a thing. 
Note that the difference between the present and aorist subjunctive is 
in aspect, not in time; i.e., the present subjunctive is used when the 
action is viewed as a process, and the aorist is used when the action is 
viewed as an event. This applies to the other uses below as well. 
b. The present or aorist subjunctive (usually 1st person) may be used in 
deliberative questions, as in example c in Grammar 1 above (page 75) 
and in the following: 
'tt 7t01COJ,1EV; 1tc"tepOV IlEVCOJ,1£V 11 olKa3e EnClvlcoJ,1£v; 
WOOt are we to do? Are we to stay or return home? 
Remember that the double question is introduced by 1tc"tepov, whether, 
which is not translated. 
c. The aorist subjunctive (2nd person singular or plural) is used with Ilf\ 
in prohibitions or negative c01nmands, e.g.: 
J,1Tt tou'to nOtftCJll~' Do not do this. 
d. The subjunctive is used in subordinate clauses introduced by tva, 
01tCOC;, or mC; to express purpose, as in example b in Grammar 1 above 
(page 75). A negative purpose clause is introduced by tva. 1l1l, 01tco<; /l11, 
mC; /l1l, or simply 1l1l. The following are further examples: 
avopeiroc; llaxollcSa. tva t1,V rcatpi3a OcOaCOJ.LEv. 
We are fighting bravely so that we may save our fatherland 
to 
save our fatherland). 
O"1tcU30UCHV 01tCO~ Wfl C)\V€ acptKCOV1:CXt. 
They are hurrying so that they may not arrive late 
lest they ar-
rive late = so as not to arrive late). 
Note that several different translations are possible in English. Note 
also, however, that Attic Greek prose does not use a simple infinitive 
to express purpose as we most commonly do in English. 

21. 
H 
E K K A H :t I A (a,) 
e. The subjunctive is used in some types of conditional clauses, e.g.: 
EipYtVll B' ecr'tat, iii.v 'toue; "EAAllvae; a'lhov6/lou~ a'Pi\'t"E. 
There will be peace, if you let the Greeks go free. 
Note the use of eav (= c1. + av).

Athenaze: Book II 
The Athenian Democracy 
The radical democracy of Pericles' time had evolved over many years. 
Solon, in his reforms of 594/593 B.C. (see essay, Book I, Chapter 8, page 118), 
had broken the old aristocratic (eupatrid) monopoly of power by making 
wealth, not birth, the criterion for political privilege. He also gave the As-
sembly a more important role in decision making; it elected the nine magis-
trates (archons) from the top two property classes and was supported by a new 
Council of 400, which prepared business for debate in the Assembly and which 
also formed a counterweight to the old Council of the Areopagus, which before 
Solon's reforms had been the governing body of Athens. The most democratic 
feature of Solon's constitution was the Heliaea; this was the Assembly sitting 
as a court of appeals from the decisions of magistrates. 
Solon's constitution continued to function throughout the following period 
of strife between factions of the nobility and throughout the ensuing tyranny 
of Pisistratus and his son Hippias. When Hippias was driven out in 510 B.C., 
the noble families began to compete for power once more. Herodotus (5.66) 
says, "Two men were preeminent, Cleisthenes the Alcmeonid and Isagoras. 
These were involved in a struggle for power, and Cleisthenes, being worsted, 
took the people into partnership." In 508 Isagoras was driven into exile, and 
Cleisthenes put through a program of reforms, which established a moderate 
democracy. 
First, he probably extended the citizenship, so that every free man, land-
less or not, had the right to vote. Secondly, to prevent the recurrence of dynas-
tic rivalry, he instituted an elaborate system that destroyed the territorial ba-
sis of the nobles' power. He divided Attica into 139 demes (see essay, Book I, 
Chapter 3, pages 28-29), each with its own assembly and demarch; he abol-
ished the four old Athenian tribes (cpuAcd), based on kinship, and replaced 
them with ten new tribes, which were artificial political units, so constituted 
that the political influence of clan and locality was ended. 
This photograph shows the Acropolis from the west with the Areopagus (the hill of Ares, 
god of war) in the foreground; here the ancient Council of the Areopagus met.

The ten new tribes formed the basic administrative and military units of 
the state. Each tribe (<pu!...~) provided fifty members (councilors, !30U!...eU'rai) to 
the Council (f)ou!...f}) of 500, which now replaced Solon's Council of 400; every 
deme elected a fixed number of councilors in proportion to its size. The new 
Council had a key role; it prepared business for the Assembly in its 
probouleutic function and was also responsible as an executive committee of 
the Assembly for seeing that decisions of the people were carried out. In the 
military sphere, each tribe provided one brigade, which was commanded by 
one of the ten generals elected by the Assembly. 
The Assembly of all adult male citizens was sovereign. It elected the 
nine archons, whose functions were largely judicial, and the ten generals; it 
met regularly to debate issues brought before the people by the Council, and it 
continued to function as a court of appeals as the Heliaea. The ancient Coun-
cil of the Areopagus still had important but vague powers, especially in judi-
cial matters and as guardian of the constitution. 
To Cleisthenes, probably, should also be ascribed the institution of os-
tracism. Once a year the Assembly was asked whether it wished to send one 
of the citizens into exile. If the people voted in favor of an ostracism, a meet-
ing was held at which every citizen scratched on a fragment of pottery 
(oO'1:paKov) the name of the politician he would like to see banished. The man 
against whom most ostraca were cast was sent off into honorable exile for ten 
years. 
In 487 B.C. a change was introduced by which the nine archons were se· 
lected by lot (from the top two property classes) instead of by election. It fol-
lowed that the importance of the archons declined while that of the generals, 
who were still elected, increased. In 462 B.C. a statesman named Ephialtes, 
supported by the young Pericles, put through measures that stripped the Are· 
opagus of its powers and transferred them to the Assembly, Council, or popu-
lar courts, which now became courts of first instance instead of courts of ap-
peaL 
Ephialtes was assassinated soon after his reforms, and his place as 
leader of the people was taken by Pericles, who dominated the Assembly until 
his death in 429 B.C., thirty-two years later. The key principles of democracy 
that had long been recognized were the rule of law and the equality of all citi-
zens before the law (iaoVollta). To these Pericles added two further principles, 
which the Greeks considered characteristic of radical democracy, namely, 
selection for office by lot and payment of all officials. Lot had been used for 
selecting the archons since 487 B.C., but now it was extended to the selection of 
councilors. At the same time the archonship was opened to the third property 
class, the ~eU'Yt'to:t, those able to keep only a team of oxen (~et)'Yo<;). Now that 
any citizen, rich or poor, might be selected for office, it became essential that 
officials should be paid. Soon pay was instituted not only for the archons and 
councilors but also for the 10,000 members of the jury panel, who received a 
small wage for each day they sat in one of the courts into which the Heliaea 
was now divided.

The following passage and the passage at the end of this chapter are 
adapted from the historian Thucydides. He used the Ionic spelling -O"O"~ in 
words that in Attic have -'t't-, e.g., npEtcrcrclv for npEt't'tctV; he used the Homeric 
and early Attic spelling ;uv (~uv-) for cruv (ouv-); and he used ec; (ecr-) instead 
of £1.e; (£1.0"-) and aieL instead of aci. We have preserved these spellings in the 
passages from Thucydides. In Chapter 22 when the narrative returns to Di-
caeopolis and his family, we use the Attic forms. Chapter 23, based on Thucy-
dides, again uses his spellings. Chapter 24 on the education of Philip, which 
includes a passage adapted from Plato, uses the Attic forms. In chapters 25 
and 26 the readings are based on Herodotus, and Borne features of his Ionic 
Greek are preserved, e.g.) ee; for de; and np6:(JoO) for np6:t'tO). More features of 
his Ionic Greek are preseved in the readings in chapters 27 and 28.

Classical Greek 
Solon 
Solon, besides being a statesman who saved the Athenian state from revo-
lution by his reforms (see page 80), was a poet, who used his poetry as propa-
ganda to warn and inform his fellow citizens. 
In the following lines 
(fragment 9), he warns them of the danger of tyranny. His warning was 
prescient; thirty years later Pisistratus became tyrant of Athens.

GRAMMAR 
1. Clauses of Fearing 
Examine these sentences from the reading passage above: 
q>ojloUIl(U 1.1.11 St' ol{you Ei~ rcol£J.l0V lCCX'tcxO''tmJ.lEv. 
I am afraid that we will (may) soon get into war. 
ouSd~ KlVOi>voC; fatat 1.1.11 oi ltOlEJ.l.tOt TtIl&C; jlltlX1:OlO'tV. 
There will be no danger that the enemy will (may) harm us, 
Subordinate clauses introduced by Iln state what is feared; such clauses of 
fearing may be introduced by verbs such as cpojloullat or expressions such 
as Ktvouv6c; Battv, and the verb of the clause of fearing is in the subjunctive 
(present or aorist, differing in aspect only). 
When the clause of fearing is negative, the introductory Iln is accom-
panied somewhere in the clause by ou, e.g.: 
E<pO~O{)J..lTlv Iln tV lCCXtpcp 01llC tl«p{lCCOJUxt. 
I was afraid that I would (might) not arrive in time. 
Where English uses the infinitive, so does Greek, e.g.: 
<pojlouJ..l<Xt tOUtO fC01.TlaCXt. 
I am afraid to do this. 
Note that if the introductory verb or clause is in the present tense, we 
translate the subjunctive with will or may, but if the introductory verb or 
clause is in a past tense, we translate the subjunctive with would or might.

Exercise 22 ~ 
Translate into Greek: 
L I fear we will (may) not arrive at the city in time. 
2. There is a danger that the enemy will (may) soon come into the land. 
3. We set out toward the city immediately, being afraid to stay in the 
country. 
4. The farmers were afraid that the enemy would (might) destroy their

5. Are you not more afraid (Don't you fear rather) to sail home than to

2. Indefinite or General Clauses 
In relative, temporal, and conditional clauses, the indicative mood is 
used if the clauses are definite, i.e., specific in reference or in time. If the 
reference or time is indefinite or general, av + the subjunctive (present or 
aorist) is used; av is placed after the relative pronoun or combined with 
some temporal conjunctions and with the conditional conjunction Ei. 
Relative: Definite: 
1tav'tEe; EKELVOUC; 'tLllrocrtV ot BV taAuJ.Livt BJ.LCXXEO'(lV'tO. 
All honor the men who fought at Salamis .. 
Relative: Indefinite or General: 
OO''tlt; <Xv e~Q) 'tmv 'tEtxmV J.Livll, c1no8avet'to:t U1tO 'tIDV 1toA.eJlirov. 
Whoever remains outside the walls will be killed by the enemy. 
(Present subjunctive :;;; ongoing process) 

94 
Athenaze: Book II 
00'1:1.; QV 1:0U1:0 fC0t110n I 'ttj.111C; a~t6c; Ea'ttv. 
Whoever does this is worthy of honor. 
(Aorist subjunctive::: simple action) 
Temporal: Definite: 
EftEl ei'i 'to (i0''t'l.) CtepllCOJiE9a, 1tPOC; 'tftV ayop&.v Ea1tE:6a<Xj.1E:v. 
When we arrived at the city> we hurried to the agora. 
Temporal: Indefinite or General: 
EftEtOaV (= E1tEt8ft + l:iv) Ei; 'Co &01:'1.) imJ.lEv. npoc; 'tTtV ayopf:t.v 
anEuboj.1E:v. 
Whenever we go to the city, we hurry to the agora. 
Temporal: Definite: 
ot L1t<xpna'ta t Ellaxov'to eOlC; lhcaV1:EC; EftEGOV. 
The Spartans were fighting until all fell. 
After a negative main clause, 1tptv is usually used: 
ai yuVatlCEC; olne unUAeOV ftptV aqlllCEto b iepEu;. 
The women did not go away until the priest arrived. 
Temporal: Indefinite or General: 
IldvatE emC; QV EfCCXV BAell b 1tcxti] p. 
Wait until father returns. 
Again, after a negative main clause, nptv is usually used: 
at yuVatKEC; olne anttxat n:piv (Xv aq»{ 'lCl1't(Xt b tepe'll;. 
The women will not go away until the priest arrives. 
Conditional: Definite: 
ei tip ileptlCA.Ei 'lttO''teuEtc;, J.1WPOC; d. 
If you believe Pericles (now), you are foolish. 
Conditional: Indefnite or General: 
eav (= el + av) 'tip ileptlCA.Et 1ttatEumJiEv I j.1&pOt EallEv. 
If we ever believe Pericles, we are (always) foolish. 
The last example above is also called a present general condition. 
Indefinite Relative Clauses: 
Note that oa'tu;, llnC;, 0 1:1, anyone who, whoever; anything that, what-
ever; pI., all that; whoever; whatever, is commonly used with av in indef-
inite relative clauses with the subjunctive, as in the second example in the 
list above. Both halves of the word decline, as follows (but note the alter-
native forms): 

Nom. 
Gen. 
Dat. 
Ace.

The word OcrOl, ocral, Qcra, as many as, often reinforced by nciv'tE<;, na-
OlXt, nciv'tIX, all, is also used with av and the subjunctive to mean all that; 
whoever; whatever, e.g.: 
o 1ta'tTlP 'tq, natot OtOrocrlv 1tclVta 00" UV ai'1:U, 
The father gives the child whatever he asks for. 
[nciv't'IX ocr<x ::: lit., all the things as many as ;;;;; whatever] 
Indefinite Temporal Clauses: 
Note the following words that may introduce indefinite temporal 
clauses. 
They all mean whenever and are used with verbs in the 
subjunctive: 
E1tElOtiv ::: E:n:E10~ + (Xv 
o't<xv = DU, + av 
t! 
I 
f 
I 
" 
O1to't<xV ;;;;; ono'tE + av 
Aspect: 
The difference between the present and aorist subjunctive in indefi-
nite clauses is in aspect, not in time, i.e., the present subjunctive is used 
when the action is viewed as continuous, and the aorist subjunctive is 
used when the action is viewed as a simple event (you will find this con-
trast illustrated in the two examples of indefinite or general relative 
clauses above and in the first two sentences below). 
Future Time: 
Note that relative, temporal, and conditional clauses referring to fu-
ture time are usually treated as indefinite in Greek, although sometimes 
we do not translate with the indefinite ever in English, e.g.: 
00''1:1.<; (Xv e~Q) tIDV tE1XIDV J.lEVl1. Cxn09lXvet'tlXt un:o trov 1tOA.EI-1LOlV. 
Whoever remains outside the walls will be killed by the enemy. 
EXEtgav e1taVEA.91l b 1tcx'tTtP, mxv'ta lla9,,001-1£9a. 
When father returns, we will learn everything.

ai yuVatK'Ee; OUK a1tia(Jt 1tptV (Xv acptxllt(U 0 iepe{)(;. 
The women will not go away until the priest arrives. 
(Remember that repiv instead of Effie; is usually used after a negative 
main clause.) 
E rxv OtXlXOe buxv El8coJlEV, reavtu flu811aO)..lE8a. 
If we return home, we will learn everything. 
The last example above is also called a future more vivid condition, 
and it is in the form that future conditions usually take, with av and the 
subjunctive in the if-clause. Greek may, however, use Bt + the future in-
dicative in conditional clauses referring to future time, but this is less 
common and is usually reserved for threats and warnings, e.g.: 
Bi tOU1:0 7&011)0E1.<;, clno8avEt. 
If you do this, you will die. 
Note that in this kind of condition we translate the future tense in the if-
clause (here, TC0t11(JEte;) as present in English.

Athenian Democracy in Action 
The Assembly ('Ii EKKAllcria) was sovereign. Consisting of all adult male 
citizens, it had forty regular meetings each year, four in each prytany (a pe-
riod of time equal to one-tenth of a year). It met on the Pnyx (1) I1vul;), the slope 
of a hill opposite the Acropolis. All eligible citizens were expected and re-
quired to attend, but in fact an attendance of 6,000 (the legal quorum for an 
ostracism) out of a citizen body of about 50,000 was probably a respectable 
number for a routine meeting. It must be remembered that the majority of the 
people lived in the country and could not possibly have come into the city for 
every meeting. The Assembly decided all issues by direct vote, by a show of 
hands. 
The Council of 500 (11 (1ouA~) formed the steering committee of the Assem-
bly. No matter could come before the Assembly that had not first been dis-
cussed in the Council. It presented motions to the Assembly in the form of 
"preliminary decrees" (npo~oUAEUlla1:a), which were debated in the Assembly 
and passed, rejected, or amended by the people. If passed, the motion became 
a "decree" ('I'~cptGlla), which was recorded, usually on stone, and set up in pub-
lic for all to read. Hundreds of fragments of such decrees survive, some 
fairly complete, which show the democracy in action. All begin EOO~E 1:11 
~oUA11 Kat 1:(9 OTtIlCP and then give the name of the prytany and chairman. 
When the Assembly met, proceedings were opened by prayer and liba-
tion. Then the herald read out the preliminary decree (1:0 npo~ouAeulla) and 
asked whether it should be accepted without debate or debated. If the people 
voted for a debate, the herald then asked "1:tC; ayopeuEtv {1ouAEnu;" and any citi-
zen could come forward to the platform ('to Pfllla) and address the people. The 
Assembly did not tolerate the foolish or ill-informed, and in practice the 

Athenaze: Book II 
speakers were usually drawn from a limited number of politicians (0 l 
pT\1:ope<;). 
The regular meetings of the Assembly had a fairly standard 
agenda. At the first meeting of each prytany (Le., of each one-tenth of a year) 
a vote was taken on whether to continue the magistrates in office or to depose 
any of them. Then the grain supply and security (especiallY the state of the 
navy) were discussed. At the second meeting of the prytany any citizen could 
bring up any topic of public or private interest (provided he had first intro-
duced his proposal to the Council). At the third and fourth meetings current 
problems were dealt with under the headings of sacred affairs, foreign policy, 
and secular affairs. Besides the regular meetings, extraordinary meetings 
could be called by the Council in any emergency. 
The 500 councilors (~OU/"'E'\)'tcxO were selected by lot in the demes from citi-
zens over thirty years old. They served for one year only and might not serve 
more than twice in a lifetime. It follows statistically that most citizens would 
sooner or later have to serve their turn on the Council. Each of the ten tribes 
(cpu/"'a{) provided fifty councilors, and each group of fifty served in rotation for 
one-tenth of the year (Le., for each prytany) as "presidents" (prytaneis, 
1tpU1.:aVE1<;). Every day a "chairman" (6 E1tlCJ1.:O:1:T\<;) was selected by lot from 
those serving as prytaneis for that one-tenth of the year, and for twenty-four 
hours he held the seal of state and the keys to the temples where the public 
moneys and archives were stored. The chairman and one-third of the pry-
taneis were on twenty-four hour duty and slept and ate in the Tholos (06/"'0<;), 
the round building next to the Council House (BOU/"'EU1.:~pWV). The Council had 
a "secretary') (6 'YpaJ.1.J.1.CX1.:Eu<;), who was responsible for recording all business. 
The Council met daily, and the public could attend as observers. Any citizen 
could ask for leave to introduce business, and, possibly, the generals could 
attend ex officio. 
The Council was divided into committees, usually of ten, each responsi-
ble for a different sphere of business. One was in charge of shipbuilding, 
another was responsible for the dockyards, a third for the upkeep of public 
buildings, and so forth. The audit committee checked the accounts of all 
magistrates who handled public moneys. All magistrates on entering office 
were scrutinized by the Council to see that they were fit and proper persons, 
and on resigning office they had to submit to a public examination of their 
record by the Council. The Council was in fact the linchpin that held the 
whole constitution together, and it is worth reflecting on the fact that at any 
given time there may have been 15,000 citizens in the Assembly who had 
served on the Council with all the political and administrative experience 
that this entailed. This gives substance to Pericles' claim that "we are all 
concerned alike with our personal affairs and the affairs of the city, and, de-
spite our various occupations, we are adequately informed on politics." 
It is remarkable that the Athenian democracy worked so well, consider-
ing that all offices, except for military commands and offices entailing tech-
nical expertise, were filled by lot and that all important decisions were taken 
by direct vote in a large and emotional assembly. Its success in the Periclean 
period may be ascribed to the dominance of one outstanding statesman, who 

22. 
HAN A }: TAr I r 
(a)

could control and guide the Assembly by his eloquence and his known in-
tegrity: "it was (in Pericles' time) in theory a democracy but in practice rule 
by the leading man" (Thucydides 2.65). Thucydides, however, overstates his 
case. Pericles could have been dropped at any time (he was in fact deposed for 
a short time in 430 B.C.), and credit must be paid to the average Athenians, 
who had the political acumen to follow a great leader. Thucydides says that 
Pericles' successors as leaders of the people, because they did not have his in-
fluence and powers of persuasion and were motivated by personal ambition 
and the pursuit of private gain, gave the people what they wanted and made a 
series of political blunders that led to the downfall of Athens. Failures in the 
war certainly did result in the growth of an antidemocratic party (Ot OA.tYOt) 
and eventually to revolution and counterrevolution. After the war, however, 
the restored democracy continued to function throughout the fourth century 
without any outstanding leaders and with good success on the whole.

GRAMMAR 
3. Indirect Statements and Questions 
Indirect statements and indirect questions have been used in the sen-
tences of the stories from nearly the beginning of this course. Indirect 
statements may be introduced by Ott or ffi~, that, and have their verbs in the 
indicative. 
You may have noticed that in indirect statements and indirect ques-
tions, Greek, unlike English, retains the tense of the original statement 
or question, even when the main verb is in a past tense. Study the follow-
ing examples: 
Direct Statement: 
"ft E~ft ~it't1'lP 1tPO~ t~V ICpnv'llv epX£'tat." 
((My mother is going to the spring." 
Indirect Statement: 
ft 1texpeEvo~ d1teV o'tt it J.1ll'tllP 1tpo'i 'tTtV KPTtVllV epx£'tcxt. 
The girl said that her mother was going to the spring. 
(The present tense is retained in the indirect statement in Greek 
but is changed to the past in 'English.) 
Indirect questions may be introduced by the same words that intro-
duce direct questions, e.g., '[{C;, who? Usually, however, certain indefinite

In early summer of 430 B.C., when the Peloponnesians invaded Attica for 
the second time, plague struck Athens. The city was crowded with refugees 
from the country, and living conditions were not healthy.

What two reasons does Thucydides give for why he is a reliable source of 
information about the plague? 
Exercise 22 e 
Translate into Greek: 
1. 
The doctors are afraid to approach the sick (use participle). 
2. 
For whoever touches (use a1ttoJlcn + gen.) a sick man (use participle 
of voaem), himself catches (falls into-use aorist participle of 
EJlxtx'tm + et~ + acc.) the plague and dies. 
3. 
The doctors said that they could not help, not knowing the disease. 
4. 
Although we are afraid that we may become sick (fall into the sick-
ness), we must stay in the city until the enemy goes away. 
5. 
If they go away soon, we will hurry to the country to escape the plague.

Solon's reforms replaced the aristocracy (rule of the nobles) by a timoc-
racy, in which political privilege was related to property; he divided the people 
into four property classes, each of which had appropriate political status.

GRAMMAR 
1. Indirect Statements with Infinitives 
Indirect statements may be expressed with the infinitive instead of 
with 01:1 or mC; and the indicative (see Chapter 22, Grammar 3, pages 102-
103). 
a. When the subject of the infinitive is different from that of the leading 
verb it is in the accusative, e.g.: 
. ,.' 
:;' \ 

23.

E LBO A H (ct)

(} nCl1:TtP J.LQl, £<P1l 'tov VECXV{aV 'tip yepov,'tt (J1.)lln'VEo9cxt. 
The father said to rne that the young man would hel]} the old man. 
The tense of the infinitive in the indirect statement in Greek is the 
same as the tense of the verb in the original or direct statement. In the 
example above the direct statement would have been (} vEavia<; 't'9 
yepOV'!l OUAA,TtVE'tCll, The young man will help the old man, with a fu-
ture indicative, which becomes a future infinitive in the indirect 
statement. The nominative subject of the verb in the direct statement, 
i.e., 0 vEaviii<;, becomes the accusative subject of the infinitive in the 
indirect statement, 'tOY VEiiv{o:v '!ip yepov'tl cruAA,fnVEcr6Cll, that the young 
man will help the old man, or, after a leading verb in a past tense, that 
the young man would help the old man. 
b. When the subject of the infinitive is the same as that of the leading 
verb it may be unexpressed in Greek but it must be supplied in En-
glish, e.g.: 
o vEo:v{iiC; )lOt £<P1l 'tip 'YEpovn (JUA.A.Tl'VEo9at. 
The young man said to rne that he would help the old man. 
If the subject of the infinitive is the same as that of the leading verb 
and is expressed or modified by an adjective or participle, it will be in 
the nominative case, e.g.: 
6 vEavitxc; 11m e<Pll au'toc; 'tip 'YEpOV'tt (JulA:t\vEo9cu. 
The young man said to me that he himself would help the old man. 
6 vEtxviac; J.Lot E<Pll Otx:a8E E1taVEA.9tbv 'tip yepovtt oul).:t\VEoea1.. 
The young man said to me that having returned home he would help 
the oldman.. 
c. Indirect statements with the infinitive may be introduced by other 
verbs as well as 'PllJ.Lt, especially verbs of thinking, believing, and hop-
ing, e.g.: 
EVOblt'E 'tou<; 'Axctpveo:c; ou nEp16vecreat 'fa crcpe1:epct btacp6EtpollEVCl. 
He was thinking that the Acharnians would not disregard (the fact) 
that their own property was being destroyed. 
E1tt01:EUEV 1:ou<; 'AXctpveiie; 6p)lftonv 1:ou<; navra<; ee; llaXllv. 
He was believing that the Acharnians would rouse everyone to battle. 
ijA,1tt'e tOUe; 'Axapveiie; OPIlTtcrElV 1:0Ue; navtct<; 
)laXllv. 
He was hoping that the Acharnians would rouse everyone to battle. 
~~ 
d. The negative is usually the same in the indirect statement as it was in 
the direct statement, e.g.: 
Direct: 
't'9 yepovn au ~01l6TtcrOl. 
I will not come to the old man's aid. 

110 
Athenaze: Book II 
Indirect: 
oil1c E'Pl1 1:ip yepov1:t ~0118TtcrBtv. 
He said that he would not come to the old man's aid. 
He denied that he would come to the old man's aid. 
Note that in the indirect statement the negative is placed before e<pl1. 
Verbs of hoping, threatening, and promising and equivalent 
phrases are often followed by the negative Iln in indirect statements, 
e.g.: 
-4-'-"="-':~ 1:0-0<; 'AHllVatOUe; 1:l,v Yl1v Jir, 1tEpto'Vccr8at 'tellvoIlEvTlv. 
He was hoping that the Athenians would not disregard (the fact) that 
their land was being ravaged. 
EA1ttOa EiXE 1:0-0<; 'A8Tlvatoue; 'tl,v )'flv Jilt 1tEpt0'Vccr8at 'tcIlVOIlEvTlV. 
He was holding hope that the Athenians would not disregard (the fact) 
that their land was being ravaged. 
N.B. In indirect statements the present infinitive refers to the same time 
as that of the leading verb, the future infinitive refers to time subsequent 
to that of the leading verb, and the aorist infinitive refers to time prior to 
that of the leading verb. The infinitive of dill and its compounds may, in 
indirect statements, refer to time subsequent to that of the leading verb, 
replacing a future indicative of a direct statement. Observe these tempo-
ral relationships carefully in your translations of the following sen-
tences.

2. Indirect Statements with Participles 
After verbs of knowing, learning, and perceiving indirect statements 
may be expressed with a participle, e.g.: 
O'l'OV'tCH 't;'v 'Y11V 'tEp.VOIl£VnV. 
They will see that their land is being ravaged. 
O\jlOV1:at 'tel ocp£'t£pa Otacp9.npoll£va. 
They will see that their own properly is being destroved. 
In the following examples note that, as with the infinitive construc-
tion, the subject of the indirect statement is not expressed if it is the same 
as that of the leading verb. Note also that in this case the participle is in 
the nominative case. Also, at)1;OC;, alYtl1, auto may be used in the nomina-
tive case to emphasize the subject of the indirect statement. Note the fol-
lowing: 
enl<J1:av'ta1 ei<; p,£,,{tO''tov ICtVOUvov lCtX'tcxCJ'tav'te(;. 
They klWw that they have gotten into the greatest danger. 
oloa au'toc; /lEV 6 pa&~ 'Ytyv cOOICOlV, h:eivouc; of: &~ap1:avov1:ac;. 
I know that I myself am right, and that they are wrong. 
The rules for tenses and negatives are the same for the participle 
construction as for the infinitive construction.

Athenaze: Book II 
The Peloponnesian War: 
First Phase (431-421 B.C.) 
The events that led up to the war are briefly outlined in Chapter 20, pages 
60-61. Pericles was convinced that war was inevitable and, while observing 
the terms of the Thirty Years' Peace to the letter, he was not prepared to make 
any concessions to the Peloponnesians. He believed firmly that Athenian 
naval and financial superiority would bring victory in a war of attrition and 
that the war had better be fought now than later. 
He had a clearly conceived strategy, which he outlined to the people in the 
speech from which you read extracts in Chapter 21~. The Athenian army 
could not risk battle in the field against the Peloponnesians, whose armyout-
numbered theirs by two to one and included the best hoplites in Greece. But the 
Athenians with a fleet of 300 triremes controlled the seas and the empire, so 
that Athens was invulnerable, provided that she was prepared to abandon At-
tica: '~You must make up your minds to abandon your land and houses and 
keep guard over the sea and the city." At the same time, he intended to use the 
navy to make landings on enemy territory in the Peloponnesus and would 
attempt to regain control of Megara and its ports and to win over northwest 
Greece, so that a blockade of the Corinthian Gulf would bring Corinth to her 
knees. 
Whether this Periclean strategy of a war of attrition, undermining the 
determination of the enemy, would have been successful, we cannot tell; for 
Pericles' calculations were upset by unforeseen factors, in particular by the 
plague that swept the city in 430-429 B.C. and by the cost of the war, which 
proved far higher than Pericles had calculated, so that by 422 B.C. the huge fi-
nancial reserves on which he had relied were exhausted. 
The war lasted from 431 to 404 B.C. with an intermission from 421 to 416. 
In this essay we will outline the events of the first half only, the Archidamian 
War, as it is called. In early summer 431 B.C. the Peloponnesian army un-
der the Spartan king Archidamus invaded Attica, staying for about a month, 
while the Athenians withdrew behind the walls of Athens and saw their land 
ravaged. As soon as the Peloponnesian army withdrew, Pericles led the 
Athenian army out and devastated Megara. At the same time a fleet of 100 
triremes together with allied contingents sailed around the Peloponnesus, 
landing at various points and causing havoc. In the autumn this force joined 
up with the AtheRian army for a second attack on Megara. 
The operations of the next few years followed a similar pattern with the 
northwest of Greece seeing more activity. Both sides had allies in this area 
and sent expeditions to help them win control of the approaches to the 
Corinthian Gulf. The outcome was inconclusive except in the Gulf itself, 
where the brilliant victories of the Athenian admiral Phormio over a much 
larger Peloponnesian fleet finally established Athenian naval supremacy 
beyond all doubt (see Chapter 29). 
In 425 B.C. a minor operation nearly brought the war to an end. An Athe-
nian fleet sailing around the Peloponnesus was forced by bad weather to land 

23. 
H 
E L BOA H 
at Pylos, on the west coast of the Peloponnesus. When the fleet continued on 
its way, it left behind a small force that fortified the promontory of Pylos and 
held it against Spartan attacks until reinforcements arrived. In the course of 
this operation, 420 Spartans were cut off on the island of Sphacteria. Eventu-
ally, the surviving 292 Spartans surrendered and were taken to Athens. The 
Spartan authorities in their eagerness to recover the prisoners sent an em-
bassy to Athens to negotiate peace; the generous terms offered were rejected by 
the Assembly on the advice of Cleon, who had succeeded Pericles, who had 
died in 429 B.C., as the most influential speaker in the Assembly. 
The following year the war took a new turn when a Spartan officer named 
Brasidas led a small force overland through northern Greece to Thrace. 
There he fomented revolt among the cities of Chalcidice, which belonged to 
the Athenian Empire, and succeeded in taking Amphipolis, a city of great 
strategic importance on the river Strymon. The historian Thucydides was 
one of the generals commanding in this area. He arrived with a fleet just too 
late to save the city, and for this failure he was brought to trial and exiled. 
The Spartans were still eager for peace, and the Athenians were weary of 
the war. There was now a strong peace party, led by Nicias. In 423 B.C. a 
one-year truce was agreed upon, during which time negotiations for a per-
manent settlement were to go forward. When the truce ended, however, Cleon 
persuaded the Assembly to send him in command of an expedition to recover 
Amphipolis. He scored some initial successes, but then Brasidas attacked 
him outside the walls of Amphipolis. In the ensuing battle both he and Brasi-
das were killed. 
" With their deaths, the chief obstacles to peace were removed, and in 421 
B.C. a treaty was negotiated between Athens and Sparta, which is known as 
the Peace of Nicias. Each side agreed to abandon nearly all the gains they 
had made in the war and to observe the peace for fifty years. The outcome of 
these ten years of costly and bitter struggle was thus a return to the position 
that had existed before the war. It proved to be a stalemate, nor were the 
prospects for long-term peace good. Nothing had been resolved. The basic 
reason for the war, the Peloponnesian fears of Athenian power, was still 
valid, nor, as events showed, was Athenian ambition quenched. Five years 
later the war was to start again, this time with consequences disastrous for 
Athens.

5. The Articular Infinitive 
The infinitive can be used as a verbal noun in any case, simply by 
introducing it with the neuter of the definite article (the negative is Jl:ll), 
e.g.: 
tOUtO ean 'to aa1.1C£iv~ 'to nA£ov '[roY aAA,COV ~ll't£iv EXetv. 
This is wrongdoing, seeking to have more than others. (Plato, Gor-
gias 483e) 
(Here 'to aOtK"EtV is nominative, subject of E.a'[l, and 'to ... ~1),[EtV is an-
other nominative, in apposition to '[outo.) 
o IleptK"All£; ntateuet op8ro£; ytyvrom(Etv nepl 'tou Ilit E7t£~tEVat.

ing and acting. 
The infinitive may have its own subject in the accusative (see sen-
tence no. 5 in Exercise 230 below) and its own complement (such as a di-
rect object), e.g.: 
'tip 'taXEcoc; 8UOlC£tV 'to 9np{ov~ Ot' OA,tyou Ka'[aA;rt\jlOJlE8a.

6.. Relative ITonouns and Their Antecedents: Some Special Cases 
a. Attraction of Relative Pronoun to the Case of Its Antecedent 
Examine the following from pages 114-115, lines 11-14: 
119 
1:0V TIeptlCA£fi EV opyft etxov, Kat e1Ceiv(Ov COV naPTtvecre 1tpo'tepov e/le/lvllv'to 
DuSev ... atnov te evo/ltsOV aU1:ov etvat 1tav"C(Ov 6>V E1tacrxov. 
They were angry with Pericles and remembered nothing of those 
things that he had formerly advised . .. and they thought that he was 
responsible for all that they were suffering. 
In this sentence the relative pronouns, which would normally be ac-
cusative, have been attracted into the case of their antecedents €KetV(oV 
and mxv't(J)v respectively. 
Such attraction to the case of the antecedent often occurs when the 
relative pronoun would normally be in the accusative case and its 
antecedent is in the genitive or dative case. The attraction is op-
tionaL 
b. Antecedent Incorporated into the Relative Clause 
Sometimes the antecedent does not precede the relative pronoun but is 
incorporated into the relative cla,use, e.g.: 
-
" 
o cr'tpa'tllYo~ E1tOPEUE'tO cruv it etxe-Su\,O:y.£t 
uuv SuvaUEt"i\V/n"Etxe). 
The general was marching with the (military) forces that he, had. 
c. Oin'ission of Antecedent 
Where the antecedent is a demonstrative pronoun, it is frequently 
omitted and attraction takes place. For example, instead of 
E1tatvro cre E1tt 'tOUtOt<; a/ot~ A£YEtC;. 
I praise you for these things that you say. 
the antecedent would usually be omitted, as follows: 
E1tatvro cre E<p' otl\i A£yetC;. 
I praise you for what you say. 
Exercise 23 £ 
Read aloud and translate. For each relative pronoun, give the form in 
which it would have been if attraction had not taken place, and give 
(where applicable) the omitted demonstrative pronoun antecedent.

Prepositional Prefixes and Euphony 
Certain changes in spelling take place when prefixes are attached to 
verbs (see Book I, Chapter 5, Grammar 4, pages 58-59), Note what hap-
pens with prefixes that end in v: 
Before ~,1t, <p, and '1', v becomes ~, e. g.) EV- + 1ti1t"Cro > E J..l1tl1t"Cro (cf. 
EV e1t€<Jov, EJ..l1t€crOOV). 
Before y, K:, ~J and X, v becomes y, e.g., <J'UV- + ypacpro > cr'l)yypa<pro and 
EV- + K:CX/"'Eoo > EYK:aAsro. 
Before A or Il, v is fully assimilated, e.g., <J'UV- + /"'£yoo > <J'l)/"'AEYro and 
EV + !lEVro > EJ..lJ..lEVoo. 
o TIEPIKAHl: 
Read the following passages (adapted from Thucydides 2.65) and answer the 
comprehension questions: 
The plague undermined Athenian morale. The people blamed Pericles 
for their sufferings and sent envoys to Sparta to discuss peace terms. Pericles 
made a speech to try to raise their spirits. Thucydides here summarizes the 
achievements of Pericles.

Translate into Greek: 
1. 
When Pericles died, his successors (01. iSo't£pov) were not leading the 
citizens but were being led by them. 
2. 
For each wishing to be first said, "I will give the citizens all that 
(whatever) they want." 
3. 
But they made many mistakes (use 2tOlA& + cXJ1cxp'tavm) and sent 
away the expedition to Sicily (use .q In:£A.ia), hoping that they would 
thus oblige (use xap{~oJ1at + dat.) the people. 
4. 
But when they heard that the generals were being defeated by the en-
emy, they did not send aid (use it pO'I;G£ta).

Solon 
Solon's poems were not confined to political themes. The following lines 
come from a long poem in which he reflects on men's desire to win wealth; 
ill~gotten gains earn punishment from Zeus. He here lists some ways in 
which men try to make a living (fragment 13.43-44,47-50, 53-54):

GRAMMAR 
1. Comparison of Adjectives 
Review: Book I, Chapter 14, Grammar 1: 
Adjectives have three degrees, e.g., "beautiful" (positive), "more 
beautiful" (comparative), and "most beautiful" (superlative) or "brave" 
(positive), "braver" (comparative), and "bravest" (superlative). 
In Greek the comparative and superlative of adjectives are regularly 
formed by adding -1:EPO<;, -tepa, -1:f::pov and -1:(Xto<;, -1:eX1:1h -t(x1:0V to the 
stem of the positive: 
Positive 
Comparative 
av8petoc;, -lX., -OV, brave 
Stem: av8petO-
av8peto-tepoc;, -ti, -ov 
braver 
X<XAe1tOC;, -fl, -ov, difficult 
Stem: X<XAe1tO-
X<xAe1tcO-1:EpOC;. -ti, -ov 
more difficult 
Superlative 
av8peto-1:(J,1:0C;. -11, -ov 
bravest 
X<xAe1tcO-t<xtOC;, -11, -ov 
most difficult 

24. 
E N 
~ I ~ A I; K A A .Q N (a) 
127 
Note that in 1st and 2nd declension adjectives as in the examples 
above, the 0 at the end of the stem of the positive is lengthened to ro if the 
syllable preceding it is regarded as short (e.g., contains a short vowel). 
3rd Declension: 
aA110ftC;, CtA110EC;, true 
Stem: CtA110ecr-
CtA110ecr-1:EpOC;, -ft, -ov 
truer 
uA110Ecr-1:a't:O<;, -11. -ov 
truest 
Note what happens when the stem ends in -ov-: 
aro<pprov, arocppov) of sound mind; prudent; self-controlled 
Stem: affi<ppov-
crrocppov-ecr-1:EpOC;, -a., -ov 
crffi<PPOv-Ecr-1:a1:0C;, -11, -ov 
more prudent 
most prudent 
The endings -ecr-1:Epo<;, -a, -ov and -Ea-1:cx'to~. -11, -ov are constructed by 
analogy with aA1)OEa-1:epO~, -iX, -ov and tXAl1SEcr-tCX1:0c;, -11, -oV. 
Remember that comparatives can mean rather / somewhat X and su-
per1atives~ very X, e.g. 
Ot ~&p~apot OtvBpeto'tepot daLv. 
The barbarians are rather/somewhat brave. 
Ot fi.O&va1:0L av8peto'tatOt eicrtv. 
The Immortals are very brave.

Greek Education 
The Greeks divided education into "music" and "gymnastics.'J Music 
meant everything concerned with the Muses, including literacy, literature, 
and music in our sense. Gymnastics meant physical training. It was com~ 
monly said that "musid
J educated the soul and "gymnastics" trained the 
body. 
Girls did not, as far as we know, attend schools. Their education was at 
home and centered on the domestic arts but must have also included music 
and dancing. Boys went to school from about the age of seven and usually 
had three different teachers. The writing master (6 YPO:Il!.lJ.Y1:t(i1;~~) taught ba-
sic literacy, numbers, and literature, the latter consisting of the traditional 
poets, especially Homer. The music teacher (6 Kt8apt(j''[~~) taught the lyre and 
sometimes also the double pipe, singing, and dancing. 
The trainer (6 
1t(noo'tp{~llC;) taught exercises such as running, jumpingJ throwing the javelin 
and discus, and wrestling. 

130 
Athenaze: Book II 
There were no state schools, though the state did pay for the education of 
some children, in particular the sons of those who had died fighting for the 
city. Other parents had to pay the teachers a small fee. A boy was usually ac-

It is impossible to say confidently how large a proportion of the citizens 
received this education or how widespread literacy was. It seems likely that 
the vast majority received schooling. The Athenian democracy functioned 
on the assumption that all male citizens were literate. Officers of state were 
selected by lot, and an illiterate could hardly have carried out the duties of a 
councilor, let alone act as chairman of the Assembly. Moreover, laws and 
decrees were displayed in public places for all to read, and at an ostracism it 
was assumed that every citizen could at least write on an ostracon the name of 
the politician he wished to see exiled. 
The education we have described was elementary. There was no higher 
education until the sophists arrived on the scene (see below), and, as Protago-
ras says in the passages quoted in this chapter, the moral element in educa-
tion was considered quite as important as the intellectual. In fact, the purpose 
of the educational system was not to train the intellect at all, but to impart ba-
sic skills that would be essential in adult life and, above all, to hand down the 
traditional values of piety, morality, and patriotism, which were enshrined 
in poetry, especially in Homer. Plato says of Homer: "This poet has educated 
Greece." Boys learned extensive passages of the Iliad by heart and in so do-
ing imbibed Homeric values. 
With the development of democracy there arose a demand for a new sort 
of education. Birth was no longer the passport to political power. The aspir-
ing politician needed the ability to persuade others, especially in the law 
courts and the Assembly. It was this ability that had given Pericles, for in-
stance, his pre-eminence. This demand was met by the sophists, who were 
itinerant teachers who began to appear on the scene in the second half of the 
fifth century. They offered to the sons of the rich a form of higher education 
in return for large fees. Different sophists included different topics in their 
courses, but common to all was rhetoric, that is, the art of speaking persua-
sively, especially in public. 
One of the earliest and greatest of the sophists was Protagoras, born in 
Abdera on the coast of Thrace about 485 B.C. He was extremely successful 
and had such a reputation that wherever he went rich and clever young men 
flocked to hear him. In Plato's Protagoras, Socrates takes the young Hip-
pocrates to meet Protagoras. When they arrive at the house where he is stay~ 
ing, they find Protagoras walking around in a portico accompanied by some 
of the richest and noblest young men of Athens, including two sons of Peri-
cles. They see other famous sophists who have come to meet Protagoras, in-
cluding one who is teaching astronomy. They then approach the great man, 
and Socrates explains the purpose of their visit: "Hippocrates here wishes to 
make a mark in the city and thinks he would be most likely to achieve this if 
he became your pupil; and so he would like to know what he will gain if he 

24.

A I A A 1: K A A a N (a)

comes to you." "Young man," replies Protagoras, "this is what you will gain, 
if you come to me; on the very day you join me you will go home a better man, 
and on the next day the same will happen, and every day you will continually 
progress toward the better." Socrates answers that this may well be so, but in 
what particular sphere will he become better? Protagoras replies that anyone 
who comes to him will not learn irrelevant subjects such as arithmetic, as-
tronomy, or geometry, but will learn precisely the subject for which he has 
come, namely good judgment in managing both his personal affairs and the 
affairs of the city, so that he may be most capable in political action and 
speech. Socrates asks: "Do I follow what you are saying? I think you mean 
the art of politics (ft 1toA.l'ttKil 'tEXVl1) and profess to make men good citizens." 
"That," replies Protagoras, "is exactly what I do profess." 
Prot agoras accuses other sophists of teaching "irrelevant subjects/' such 
as mathematics. Those who did teach such subjects would have said that they 
provided an intellectual training that was an essential preparation for fur-
ther studies. The idea of training the intellect had come to stay. 
The next century saw the foundation of institutes of higher education. 
Socrates' pupil Plato founded the Academy in 387 B.C. to train statesmen by 
teaching them philosophy; for only the philosopher knew what was really 
"good," and only one trained in philosophy could know what was good for the 
city. He believed in a rigorous intellectual training, based on the study of 
mathematics. Soon other schools were founded, such as Aristotle's Lyceum, 
which was a center for research in the sciences as well as a school of philoso-
phy, and schools of rhetoric, such as that of Isocrates.

sians), Persian chroniclers, according to Herodotus, said that first some 
Phoenician traders carried off a Greek princess (10) to Egypt; in retaliation 
the Greeks stole a Phoenician princess (Europa); then Greeks, led by Jason, 
carried off Medea from Colchis. 
Finally, the Trojan prince Paris stole

many ships, he prepared to wage war against (m~ + future participle) 
the islanders (use 0 vTlOtcOtll~. tou VTlGU()1;ou). 
3. 
But a certain Greek (man) having arrived at Sardis ('t6:e; l:apb;:e;) and 
having heard what Croesus was having in mind, said, "King, the is-

138 
Athenaze: Book II 
landers are gathering very many cavalry (ht1Cea~), to wage war 
(use chr; + future participle or purpose clause) against you." 
4. 
And Croesus, thinking that the Greek was speaking the truth, said, "I 
hope that the islanders will wage war against me; for they will 
clearly (a(X,mr;) be defeated." 
5. 
But the Greek answered these things, "Don't you think that the is-
landers hope that you will wage war against them (0,(1<;;) by sea, be-
lieving that they will defeat you?" 
6. 
So thus Croesus was persuaded not (,.1:1\) to wage war against the is-
landers but to make (them) friends. 
Classical Greek 
Resiod 
Resiod (fl. 700 B.C.?) was a farmer in Boeotia who composed a long poem 
in which he intermingled practical advice on farming with moral homilies 
and myth. In the following lines (Works and Days 109-110, 112-118, ed., M. 
L. West) he gives an account of the Golden Age, which was followed by the 
Silver, Bronze, and Iron Ages, each worse than its predecessor:

GRAMMAR 
1. The Optative Mood Used to Express Wishes 
The last mood of the Greek verb for you to learn is the optative, so 
called from its use in wishes and named from the Latin word for "to 
wish," opta.re. The suffixes for the optative mood are -1- or -111-, which 
combine with other vowels in the verb to give forms that are immediately 
recognizable by the diphthongs Ot, at, or ro or the long-vowel digraph £t, 
I' 
e' 
e.g., A.UOt~t, A.uO"at~t, 'ttll.4mV and A.U einv. 
One use of the optative in main clauses is to express wishes for the fu-
ture (the negative is 1111), e.g.: 
chqn~A.o{r, ae 0 ee6~, ib '/tat. 
May the god help you, son. 
IlTt ei~ KO'.KU 1I:£001:t£, ib <piA.Ct. 
May you not fall into trouble, friends. I hope you don't . ... 
Both the present optative (ro<peA.otll) and the aorist optative (TtEO"ot1:e) refer to 
the future; they differ in aspect, not time. 
The word eyee or the words ei yap, if only, oh that, are often used to in-
troduce wishes with the optative, e.g.: 
£igelEi yap Ill, oP'Y{~ot'to 'hlltV b (5eO"Tt61:'flc;. 
If only the master would not be angry with us!

2. The Potential Optative 
The optative (present or aorist) with the particle av in main clauses 
expresses a possibility or likelihood, sometimes dependent on a condi-
tion, stated or implied. This is called the potential optative; compare En-
glish statements with "would," ushould," and "may," e.g.: 
I would like to see the doctor (if I may). 
po'OloiJ,111V av tOY 1ti'tpOV iOEiv. 
There is no one way of translating such clauses; the following examples 
illustrate some of the uses of the potential optative (the negative is ou): 
OUK <Xv ~Ol1aohlV aot. I wouldn't come to your aid. 
tame; (lV ;'J,L1V ~0110oLlle;. Perhaps you would come to our aid. 
aUK <Xv ouvaLJ,L£86. crot f)o118E'iv. We couldnJt come to your aid.

(Heraclitus, as quoted by Plato, Cratylus 402a10) 
3. The Optative Mood in Subordinate Clauses 
a. In some subordinate clauses, the optative may be used as an alterna-
tive to the subjunctive. This option is available only if the verb of the 
main clause is in the imperfect, aorist, or pluperfect tense. The SUbH 
ordinate clause is then said to be in secondary sequence. (If the main 

144 
Athenaze: Book II 
verb of the sentence is in the present, future, or perfect tense or in the 
present or aorist imperative, the subordinate clause is said to be in 
primary sequence.) 
In the following examples of sentences with subordinate clauses 
in secondary sequence, the optional optative verb forms are given af-
ter the slash. Note that the translation into English is the same re-
gardless of whether the optative or the subjunctive mood is used in 
Greek; Greek authors seem to have used the subjunctive or optative 
indifferently in secondary sequence, with no difference in meaning. 
Primary Sequence (Purpose Clause): 
o LOA-COV unobUJl£t tva IlTt 'ttva 1:rov VOJ.lCOV eXvaYlCaa8'ft A:ucrat Zlv

b. In secondary sequence, indefinite or general clauses regularly have 
their verbs in the optative without (Xv, e.g.:

4. The Forms of the Optative 
The optative, associated with secondary sequence, uses secondary end-
ings, -1l11V, -0'0, -to, -IlESa. -cr6E, -VtO, in the present middle and passive 
and in the aorist middle; the cr of the 2nd person singular is lost between 
vowels. The optative suffixes -t- or -t11- produce forms that are recogniz-
able from the diphthongs Ot, at, or <p or the long-vowel digraph Et; be sure 
you can recognize person, tense, and voice markers.

Bust of Herodotus 

148 
Athenaze: Book II 
Henxlotus 
Herodotus was born at Halicarnassus, on the southern fringe of Ionia, 
some years before Xerxes' invasion of Greece. As a boy, he must have seen 
the queen of Halicarnassus, Artemisia, lead her fleet to join the invasion 
force. As a young man he joined the unsuccessful uprising against the tyrant 
Lygdamis, Artemisia's grandson, and after its failure went into exile in 
Samos. From there he embarked on his travels, which eventually took him 
around most of the known world. He visited Lydia, including Sardis, and 
Syria, from where he reached the Euphrates and sailed down the river to 
Babylon. From Babylon he went on to the Persian capital, Susa. In the North 
he sailed right around the Black Sea (Pontus Euxinus), stayed some time at 
Olbia at the mouth of the Dnieper (Borysthenes) and traveled up the river into 
the wild interior of Scythia. In the South, he visited Egypt twice, staying for 
several months, and sailed up the Nile as far as Elephantine. In the West he 
knew Sicily and south Italy. Whether he traveled as a merchant or, as Solon, 
simply for sightseeing (gerop{ac; EVElCa), he continually amassed information, 
seeing and listening, gathering oral tradition, and studying records and 
monuments, all of which he was to use in his history. 
During this period he settled in Athens for some time. He became a 
friend of the tragedian Sophocles, who wrote an ode to him when he left Athens 
to join the panhellenic colony of Thurii in south Italy (443 B.C.). Thurii be-
came his home thereafter, though he continued to travel and returned to 
Athens to give recitations of his history in the 430s. He lived through the first 
years of the Peloponnesian War (he refers to events of 431-430 B.C.), and his 
history must have been published before 425 B.C., when Aristophanes paro-
dies its introduction in the Acharnians. 
He has rightly been called the "father of history." He had no predecessor 
except Hecataeus of Miletus (fl. 500 B.C.), who wrote a description of the earth 
in two books, one on Asia, the other on Europe. Herodotus knew this work and 
refers to it twice, when he disagrees with Hecataeus's statements. It is hard 
for us, with books and libraries at hand, to imagine the difficulties that con-
fronted a man who set out to write a history of events that took place a genera-
tion or more earlier. The only written sources he could consult were local 
records, e.g., temple lists and oracles, and in some cases official documents, 
e.g., he must have had access to some Persian records, such as the Persian 
army list. Otherwise he had to rely entirely on what he saw on his travels 
and what he heard from the people he met. He was a man of infinite curiosity 
with an unflagging interest in the beliefs and customs of foreign peoples. 
Free from all racial prejudice, he listened to what strangers had to tell him 
with an open mind, and he could never resist passing on a good story. Not 
that he believed all that he was told. He had a healthy scepticism: "1 am 
obliged to report what people say, but I feel no obligation to believe it always; 
this principle applies to my whole history" (7.152). 
He was a deeply religious man, and his interpretation of history is theo-
logical. He believed firmly that the gods did intervene in human affairs and

that no man could escape his fate. In particular, he believed that human pride 
(u~Ptc,;) resulted in divine vengeance (V Ej..lEcru;). This is clearly seen in the 
story of Croesus and on a larger scale in the whole treatment of the pride, de-
feat, and downfall of Xerxes. Dreams, signs, and oracles play an important 
part in his narrative. These are the means by which man might know his 
fate, which could not be changed but which might be postponed. Myth perme-
ates his work. He moves in a world where mythical explanations of phenom-
ena are commonplace; he is not a thoroughgoing sceptic, nor does he swallow 
the mythical tradition whole. 
Before telling the story of Croesus, he goes back to give an account of the 
kings of Lydia, from whom Croesus was descended, and the whole section 
ends with the words Auoot J,.lEV on U1&O TIepcrncH EOEOOUA(oV'tO, "the Lydians had 
been enslaved by the Persians." One of the major themes of the history is 
freedom and slavery. 
There follows a description of the rise of Persia, including the subjuga-
tion of the Greeks in Asia Minor and the defeat and capture of Babylon, end-
ing with the death of Cyrus. Book 2 opens with the accession of Cyrus's son 
Cambyses, who invaded and conquered Egypt. The remainder of Book 2 is 
then taken up with a description and history of Egypt, the longest of 
Herodotus's digressions from his main theme. Book 3 starts with the con-
quest of Egypt and Cambyses' subsequent madness and death. After a di-
gression on Polycrates of Samos, we have an account of the accession of Dar-
ius and the organization and resources of the Persian Empire. Book 4 is de-
voted to Darius's invasions of Scythia and Cyrene; Book 5, to the reduction of 
Thrace and the Ionian revolt. The Persian menace is seen to be looming 
larger and larger over Greece. Book 6 centers on Darius's expedition to pun-
ish the Athenians for helping the Ionians in their revolt, an expedition that 
culminates in the Marathon campaign. Book 7 opens with the accession of 
Xerxes and his decision to invade Greece. It ends with the Thermopylae 
campaign. Books 8 and 9 continue the story of the invasion and end with the 
battle of Mycale and the revolt of Ionia. 
Within this broad framework, Herodotus continually makes digressions 
wherever a topic that interests him crops up. He is particularly fascinated by 
the strange customs and beliefs of the remoter peoples he met, but he also tells 
us a great deal about the earlier history of Greece, as occasion arises. The 
whole story moves in a leisurely and expansive way, not unlike Homer's Il-
iad in this respect, and like Homer he also continually uses speeches to 
heighten the drama of events and to illuminate the characters of the leading 
actors. Despite the poetic qualities of his work, he is usually found to be cor-
rect on matters of historical fact where we can check them from any other 
source.

WORD BUILDING 
Nouns formed from the stem of another noun or of an adjective are called de-
nominative nouns. 
Give the meanings of the nouns in the following sets: 
1. Suffixes -1:11<; and -EUe; (nominative) denote the person concerned or occu-
pied with anything, e.g.: 
6 nOAl-'t11e; (11 nOAt-e;), 6 vau~'tT\C; (il vau-e;) 
6 inn-EUe; (6 lmt-oe;), 6 l.EP-EUC; (tEp·Oe;, -a, -ov) 
2. Abstract nouns denoting qualities are formed by adding suffixes to adjec-
tives, e.g., 
-ta/-ta (nominative) 
-crUVT\ (nominative) 
-'t'l1<; (nominative) 
q>LAOe;, -T\, -ov 
uA118nC;, -ec; 
BtKatoC;, -a, -ov

11 10'0-1:11C;, 'ttle; tcro't1l'toe; 
11 VEO-'t'l1C;, 1:11<; VEO'tl1'toC; 
3. Patronymics, i.e., nouns meaning "son of . 
," "descended from.. 
" 
are most commonly formed with the suffix -tOl1e; (nominative), e.g., 6 
t AAlCflEWV-t5T\e;. 
4. Various suffixes are added to nouns to express smallness; the resulting 
words are called diminutives. The most common are: 
-toy (nominative) 
'to natB{ov (6 nate;, 'tou nato-oc;) 
-tBtov 
'to OiK-tOtoV ('h obd-a) 
-{mcoe; 
6 natO-tcrlCoC; (6 nate;, 1:0U nato-oc;) 
o vEuv-icrKoe; (0 vEavi-aC;) 
Diminutives can express affection, e.g., n;a1:piotOv, daddy dear, or con-
tempt, e.g., avSpc.Ontov, wretched little man.

6. The Optative Mood in Indirect Statements and Indirect Questions 
In indirect statements and indirect questions the optative may be used 
as an alternative to the indicative in secondary sequence, or the indica-
tive may be preserved. If the optative is used, its tense is the same as the 
tense of the verb in the direct statement or direct question. In the follow-
ing examples, the optional optative is given after the slash (in the exam-
ples from Herodotus we do not use the movable v). 
Direct Statement: 
aflELvov EotL av9pO:)7t(p 'tE9vavett flUAAOV 1\ ~f1v. 
It is better for a man to be dead than to be alive. 
Indirect Statement, Primary Sequence: 
oEh:vucrt 0 9EOs on aflElv6v eon cXv9pom<p tE9vaVctl flUAAOV 1\ ~flv. 
The god shows that it is better for a man to be dead than to be alive. 
Indirect Statement, Secondary Sequence: 
£OEtSE 6 9EOe; o'tt aflEtVOV Eon/ElT} av9pom<p tE9vaVctl flUAAOV 1\ ~flv. 
The god showed that it was better for a man to be dead than to be alive. 
Direct Question: 
'tivet OEU'tEPOV flE:t' £KetVOV OA~t(O'tettOV EioEe;; 
Whom did you see second most happy after him? 
Indirect Question, Primary Sequence: 
6 Kpotooc,; eponq: ttVct OEUtEPOV flEt' h:dvov OA~t(OtcttOV e18e. 
Croesus asks whom he saw second most happy after him.

Athenaze 
Indirect Question, Secondary Sequence: 
o KpotO'o~ UPE'tO ttva odyrepov J1E1:' £1~etvov 6A~tro1:a'tov £tat/{aOt. 
Croesus asked whom he had seen second most happy after him. 
Remember that it is only in secondary sequence that indicatives may 
be changed to optatives. 
The only use of the future optative in Greek is as an alternative to the 
future indicative in indirect statements or indirect questions in sec-
ondary sequence, e.g.: 
o 1t(XLTlP d1tEV o'tt 'to'i<; 1tatatv 1tpO~ to aa'tu fty'llaE'tQtJil'y1laot'to. 
The father said that he would lead his sons to the city. 
Ot n:a'ioE<; UPov'to 1t01:E OtKaOE btavtaatv/e,tavtOtEv. 
The sons asked when they would return home. 
Note that En:aVtOtEV is here regarded as future, substituting for the future 
E1taVto:atv of the direct question. 
Exercise 25 t

GRAMMAR 
1. Conditional Sentences 
Conditional sentences, in both English and Greek, may be organized 
under two broad headings: 
a. Simple conditions, in which nothing is implied as to whether the 
condition was, is, or will be fulfilled 
These may be of two kinds: 
i. Particular conditions 
11 . General conditions, in which the conditional clause is a 
type of indefinite clause (see Chapter 22, Grammar 2, 
pages 93-96). 
b. Contrary to fact and remote conditions, in which it is implied that 
the condition was not fulfilled, is not being fulfilled, or is not 
likely to be fulfilled in the future

u. Simple Conditions: 
Past Particular: 
If Philip said this, he was lying. 
d 0 4>O .. t1(1(o<; 'tolyto Ei1tEV I £V£UliE'tO. 
(a past tense, i.e., imperfect, aorist, or pluperfect, of the indica-
tive in both clauses) 
Past General: 
If Philip (ever) said this, he was (always) lying. 
Ei 6 4>{A,t1t1t0<; 'rolho I..E,,{Ot, £",£-68E1:0. 
(ei + optative, aorist or present; imperfect indicative) 
Present Particular: 
If you believe Philip, you are foolish. 
d 'tep 4>tA-t1t1t€P 1tl.O''t£uel.~, l1ooPO<; E1. 
(present or perfect indicative in both clauses) 
Present General: 
If you (ever) believe Philip, you are (always) foolish. 
Eflv't& 4>tA-trmq> 1ttCJ'C£ul1C;, l1&po<; d. 
aav + subjunctive, aorist or present; present indicative) 
Future Minatory: 
If you do this, you will die. 
d 'tOlJ'tO notTtO'£tc;, «Xnoeavet. 
(d + future indicative; future indicative) 
(Conditions with the future indicative in both clauses usually 
express threats and warnings, hence the term minatory.) 
Future More Vivid (Particular or General): 
Particular: 
If the doctor does this, he will receive his pay. 
General: 
If the doctor (ever) does this) he will (always) receive his pay. 
eav 0 ia'tpo<; 'rOU'tO 1tOl:rial1, 'rov I1tO"SoV 8£~E'tat. 
a/iv + subjunctive, aorist or present; future indicative) 
The imperative may be used in the main clause, e.g.: 
If you see father, tell him what happened. 
sav 'tOY 1ta'tEpa t8nc;, tinE a:\l't!p 'tt f:yEVE'tO. 

164 
Athenaze: Book II 
b. Contrary to Fact and Renwte Conditions: 
Past Contrary to Fact: 
If the doctor had done this, he would have received his pay. 
(It is implied that he did not do this and did not receive his pay.) 
d 61a'tpOC; 1:0UtO £'JtOtl1a£v, E~E~(l'tO (Xv 'tov J.Lto86v. 
(aorist indicative; aorist indicative with av) 
Present Contrary to Fact: 
If our father were living, he would be coming to our aid. 
(It is implied that he is not living and is not coming to X's aid.) 
d e~ll 6 7t<Xtnp, ~JllV liv £~oita£t. 
(imperfect indicative; imperfect indicative with av) 
Future Remote or Future Less Vivid: 
If the doctor should do this, he would not receive his pay. 
(If the doctor were to do this, ... ) 
(If the doctor did this, . . . ) 
(It is implied that the doctor is not likely to do this.) 
d 6 iatpoc; tOUtO 1&OtTtaEt£V, OUK liv 8£~at'to 1:0V J.Lta86v. 
(d + optative, aorist or present; optative, aorist or present, with 
av) 
In contrary to fact and remote or future less vivid conditions, the 
potential particle avalways appears near the beginning of the main 
clause, although not as the first word; it is often next to the verb. Note 
that in these clauses the aorist indicative refers to past time, the im-
perfect indicative to present time, and the optative to future time. 
Note that the difference between aorist and present subjunctives 
and optatives in conditional clauses is in aspect, not time. The aorist 
subjunctive or optative is used when the action of the verb is looked on 
as a simple event, the present, when it is looked on as a process. 
In all conditional sentences, the negative is J.L11 in the conditional 
clause and ou in the main clause.

Shame and Guilt 
When Solon explained to Croesus why he would not call him the happiest 
man he had seen, he said: E1tlcr'ta~c(t nav 1:0 GEiov <pGOVEpov QV Kat 1:apax&8E<;. 
When Solon had left Sardis, £AapEv h: 'tOU GEOU vE~Ecrte; flEyaA'l1 Kpolaov. 
Shortly after Solon's departure, Adrastus arrived ou Ka9apoc; roy 'tae; XEtpac; and 
KaGapatou HieE'to E1tlKUpfiactt. The concepts in these passages from Herodotus 
are quite alien to our modes of thought but are central to the Greek view of 
man's relation to the gods and his place in the universe. 
In the Iliad, there is a division between morality (man's relations with 
his fellow men) and religion (man's relations with the gods), The gods are 
not usually interested in how men behave toward each other but are very in-
terested in how men behave toward themselves, the gods. They demand from 
men a proper honor (1:1fln), just as a king demands honor from his nobles. 
The gods must receive prayer and sacrifice from mortals, accompanied by 
the appropriate rituals. Provided you fulfill these obligations, you may expect 
the gods to be well disposed toward you, although, of course, you cannot con-
strain them by any amount of prayer and sacrifice. The gods are often arbi-
trary in their behavior) and they, like men, are bound by the dictates of fate 
(~oipa), which even they cannot change. Nevertheless, in the Iliad men, 
though recognizing the power of the gods, do not generally go in fear of them, 
and religion shows little of the darker side that is prominent in Herodotus 
and the poets of his time. 
Homeric heroes in their relations with their fellow men are motivated not 
by religious considerations but by what their peers think of them. The main-
spring of their action is honor, which is literally dearer than life. 
Con-
versely, they avoid certain actions through fear of what others may say or 
think of them. They are restrained by ai8roe; (sense of shame, self-respect). 
So the whole plot of the Iliad turns on Achilles> refusal to fight when 
Agamemnon has insulted his honor. Life was a competition in which honor 
was the prize. Achilles' father told him: aU:v apta'tEUEtv Kat imElpoxov Efl~evat 
lfAAroV, "always to be the best and to excel over others" (Iliad 11.784). 
The honor ethic (a shame culture, as the anthropologists call it) persisted 
throughout Greek history, but in the time of Herodotus there was alongside it a 
very different ethic, which was based on a different view of the gods and the 
whole human predicament. According to this view, to court the preeminence 
that Achilles' father recommended to his son was positively dangerous and 
wrong. In Herodotus and the poets of his time, Zeus is the agent of justice 
(8lK'l1). Man is helpless before the power of the gods and the dictates of ~oipa 
(one's allotted portion, fate), and all who offend must suffer. The surest way 
of offending the gods and bringing down VEflECHC; (divine vengeance) on your-
self is to become too prosperous or too great. Such excess leads to pride (u~PtC;), 
a condition in which you may think yourself more than mortal and so incur 
the jealousy (<p96voC;) of the gods: <ptAeEt yap 6 geoc; 1:& unEpexov'ta 1t(xv'ta KOAoUEtv 
"for God is accustomed to cut down everything that excels (overtops others)" 
(Herodotus 7.10).

What of those who have not offended but still suffer? One answer was in-
herited or corporate guilt. If a righteous man suffers, he must be paying for 
the offense of one of his kin (so the family curse is a prominent theme in 
Greek tragedy, e.g., Aeschylus>s Oresteia or Sophocles' Antigone). Such cor-
porate guilt can infect not just one family but whole societies: "Often a whole 
city reaps the reward of an evil man who sins and plots wicked deeds" 
(Resiod, Works and Days 240-241). So man is helpless (aJ.li}xavo~) in a 
frightening and unpredictable world, governed by gods who are jealous and 
troublemaking. 
What could man do to avoid disaster (crul.L<popa)? The only way was to re-
frain from offending the gods and if offense occurred, to seek purification, a 
cleansing of guilt. Purification (K&9apcnc;) was a ritual washing away of pol-
lution, as Christian baptism is a symbolic washing away of sin, and was 
regularly performed on all occasions that brought man into contact with the 
gods, e.g., before sacrifice or feasting (which was a meal shared with the 
gods). Rituals, of which we know little, were prescribed for various occa-
sions, e.g., after childbirth. 
The greatest pollution (j.ltctcrj.la) was blood-guilt. Adrastus arrived at 
Croesus's court ou Kcx9apoc; roy 1:lxC; xt'ipac;. He had involuntarily killed his own 
brother. Whether the act was voluntary or involuntary was beside the point as 
far as his family was concerned. He had to go into exile, since otherwise he 
would have infected the whole family with his j.ltcxcrJ.1cx. He comes to Croesus 
as a suppliant (iKe'tl1C;), and Croesus, a god-fearing man, is bound to accept 
him. Such were the rules of supplication, which had its own ritual. Suppli-
ants were under the protection of Zeus. Croesus, although he does not know 
Adrastus, at once understands the situation and purifies him, using the cus-
tomary rites. We do not know precisely what these rites were, but they in-
volved the sacrifice of a suckling pig, in the blood of which the guilty man 
was cleansed. Pollution could infect a whole people. In the opening scene of 
Sophocles' Oedipus the King, the whole land of Thebes is devastated by 
plague. Oedipus sends Creon to Delphi to ask Apollo what he should do. Apol-
lo's answer is that they must drive out the pollution of the land (J.llct()J.1a xropac;); 
((By what sort of purification (1tOt<p lCa9&pj.l<p)?" asks Oedipus. The answer is 
"By driving out (the guilty man), or by exacting blood for blood.» 
The society that accepted such ideas must have been suffering from a deep 
sense of guilt, all the more terrifying because one could not always know the 
cause of one's pollution, nor, in the last resort, was there any way of escaping 
it. When Croesus had been saved by Apollo, he sent messengers to Delphi to 
ask why Apollo had deceived him. The answer came back: "It is impossible 
even for a god to escape his destined lot. Croesus has paid for the sin of his 
ancestor five generations back, who murdered his master and took the honor 
(i.e., the throne) which was not rightly his" (Herodotus 1.91). Zeus might be 
just, but it was a harsh justice.

GRAMMAR 
2. Adverbial Accusatives and the Accusative of Respect 
The neuter accusative of adjectives is often used adverbially, e.g., the 
comparative adverb is the neuter accusative singular of the comparative 
adjective; thus, 8cxooov ;::;; more quickly. The superlative adverb is the 
neuter accusative plural of the superlative adjective; thus, 'taXl<HU = most 
quickly, very quickly. The words )1E'Ya, 1tOAU, OA.t'Yov, OUOEV, and '[{ are 
commonly used adverbially, e.g.: 
J1E'YCX poq. He I she shouts loudly. 
OilOEV oe <pope'iLaL He I she does not fear you at all. 
t! ,[OU,[O 1I:01eic;; Why are you doing this? 
Another kind of adverbial accusative is the accusative of duration of time 
or extent of space, e.g.: 
" 
Ie' _ 
E)1eW<X.)1ev 7t EV'tE Tl J.1Ep ac;. 
We stayed five days. 
'[0 aO'1:'O 1tOAA,O-UC; G't(Xo{o'U'i u1texet. 
The city is many stades distant. 
A new adverbial use of the accusative case is the accusative of respect, 
e.g.: 
KpotooC; flv A u80e; 1-11v 'YEVOC; •••• 
Croesus was Lydian with respect to his race, i.e., by birth . ... 
CtVnp 'ttC; a<piKE'to ou lCa9apoc; 'ta~ xetpa~. 
A man arrived impure with respect to his hands. 
The accusative of respect is very similar to the dative of respect (see Book 
I, Chapter 6, Grammar 6c, page 88). 

172 
Athenaze: Book II 
3. The Accusative Absolute 
Another adverbial use of the accusative case is the accusative 
absolute, used with participles of impersonal verbs instead of the genitive 
absolute, e.g.: 
oo;av 'Cov 1taioa E<; 'Citv aypCiv 1tEJ,Hllat, 6 Kpot<Jo<; J.uXAt<J'ta E<po~d'to. 
When he had decided to send his son to the hunt7 Croesus was very 
afraid. 
(The word oo;av is the accusative neuter of the aorist participle of oOKd 
= it having seemed best = it having been decided.) 
E;OV E<; 'CTtv aypCiv iEval, 6 "A'tu<; Eu8n<; 6pJ.l<l'taL. 
Being allowed to go to the hunt, Atys sets out at once. 
(The word E;OV is the accusative neuter of the participle of B~E<JTl(V) it 
being possible, it being allowed.) 
otov 'to 811PtoV aipdv, 
'to opo<; E<J1tE'OOOV. 
Since it was necessary to take the beast, they hurried to the mountain. 
(The word OEOV is the accusative neuter of the participle of OEt = it being 
necessary. )

4. The Verbal Adjective in - 't B 0 ~ 
The suffix -teOe;, added usually to the verbal stem of the aorist passive, 
may give a passive adjective, e.g., A.U-tEoC;, -ii, -ov = to be loosed, which ex-
presses obligation or necessity and is often used with the verb dJ.Ll, e.g.: 
A'U'tEOt daiv 01 (36ec;. 
The oxen are to be loosed. 
The oxen must be loosed. 
The person by whom the action must be performed is in the dative, e.g.: 
mrpEA.11'tEa (Jot it nOA.tc; ea'ttv. (Xenophon, Memorabilia 3.6) 
The city must be helped by you. You must help the city. 
The person is often omitted in the Greek, although we prefer to express it 
in English, e.g.: 
aA.A.Clt vf1ec; EK trov ~uJ.LJ.Laxrov JlEtcxn:E~n:'te(n eierlv. 
Other ships must be summoned from the allies ~. 
We must summon other ships from the allies. 
The verb dJ.LL is often omitted, e.g.: 
A.'\)1:£ot Ot j36E<;. 
The oxen must be loosed. 
The neuter verbal adjective of intransitive verbs is used impersonally 
with an active sense, e.g.: 
i't£ov fU.ltv. 
It is necessary for us to go. 
We must go. 
The neuter plural is often used in this way instead of the singular, e.g.: 
EI-LOt PCX5tCJ'tE<X eo't1.v 1tpOC; 'tllv ayopav. 
It is necessary for me to walk to the agora. 
I must walk to the agora. 
The neuter verbal adjective of transitive verbs is also used impersonally 
with an active sense and an object, e.g.: 
UA.Tt8EtaV yE 1tep\ 1tOAA.OU 7COlll1:EOV. (Plato, Republic 389b2) 
It is necessary to consider the truth of great importance. 
We must consider the truth of great importance. 
Exercise 26 a 
The following examples are all taken with minor omissions of words 
from Plato, Republic, Books 2-5, in which Plato is discussing (a) the edu-
cation of the guardians of his ideal state (1-3), (b) the selection of the 
rulers from the guardian class (4), and (c) the education of women (5). 
Translate the sentences and see how far you can reconstruct Plato's views 
on the education of his "guardians":

Exercise 26 e 
Translate into Greek: 
1. A foreigner, Phrygian by race, arriving at Sardis with impure hands, 
asked Croesus to purify him. 
2. When the Mysians asked Croesus for help (use ~oft9£ux; use two 
accusatives), at first Croesus was not willing to send his son. 
3 . But his son said, "Our (use dative of the possessor) battle is not against 
men; and so fear nothing but send me," 

176 
Athenaze: Book II 
4. So Croesus was persuaded by these words, but, having sent for the for-
eigner, he told him to guard his son. 
5. Being allowed to go, Atys, having set out immediately, arrived at the

Hesiod wishes that he had not been born in the Iron Age (Works and

begin again with a new Golden Age; hence Hesiod's wish to have been born 
later.

Herodotus's Ionic Dialect 
Herodotus wrote in a literary version of the Ionic dialect; in the preceding chapters 
we changed most of his Ionic forms to their Attic equivalents, preserving only e~ (eO'-) , 
~O'O'-, and a few others, but from now on in the readings we leave more Ionic forms as 
Herodotus actually wrote them. Note the following: 
1. 
Ionic has 11 where Attic has a. after E, t, and p, e.g., Ionic ftllePl1 = Attic ftllepa; Ionic 
1tpi)StC; = Attic 1tpaS1.~· 
2. 
Contraction does not take place in Herodotus's Ionic with verbs and nouns, the stems 
of which end in -f.-, e.g., Herodotus has qnA£fl), q:nAe.et~, qnAeEl, etc., instead of the At-
tic qnA&, q)tAEt~, <ptAEl, etc. As examples of nouns, note that Herodotus has the uncon-
tracted forms y£Vto~ (= Attic y£vOUC;), y£vaa (= Attic yevll), and nEpcrEo)V 
Attic 
I1epO'&v). The noun voo~ does not contract in Herodotus. 
3. 
Herodotus has EOOV, EOUm.l, iov for the present participle of the verb dilL 
4. 
Dative plurals of the 1st and 2nd declensions end in -nO't and -Ota'l, e.g., lCpl1Vncrt 
and aypotO'l. 
5. 
Occasionally Ionic has Et where Attic has E and ou where Attic has 0, e.g., Ionic 
~EtVOc.; (= Attic ~EVOC;) and Ionic llOUVO~ 
Attic Ilovoc.;). 
6. 
Ionic has some pronouns not common in Attic prose, e.g., oi (dative, enclitic) to 
himlherlit, and lltV (accusative, enclitic) him/her. 
7. 
Herodotus usually does not use the movable v (see 27 a:14, 26, and 29).

GRAMMAR 
1. The Perfect Tense: MiddleIPassive Participles 
The perfect tense has the same forms for middle and passive voices, 
just as do the present and the imperfect. Deponent verbs are, of course, in 
the middle voice; the context will tell whether other verbs are being used 
as middle or passive. 
You have met a number of perfect passive participles in the stories. In 
the Greek sentences quoted below, all perfect passive participles are in 
boldface; they all have one of the following: 
a. Reduplication: repetition of the first consonant of the stem + E, e.g., 
lCAEt-, shut, reduplicates to lCE1(AEt-. 
h. Temporal augment: e.g., E,AlCU-, drag; draw, augments to el,A1('\}-. 
c. Syllabic augment: e.g., O''t'EPE-, deprive; bereave, augments to Ecr'tEPE-. 

184 
Athenaze: Book II 
Note the perfect passive participles in the following sentences: 
'I11lPOV 'ttxc; 1tUAcXC; lCElCAEql£vac;. 
(17~: 7) 
They found the gates having been closed = closed. 
They found that the gates had been closed. 
ot 'EAA11Ve:C; ... vauc; etoov aVE1A.1C\)CSJlEvlit; £0(0 'tou 'tdxoue;. (19 tail: 12-
15) 
The Greeks saw the ships having been drawn up (on the shore) 
beached inside the wall. 
The Greeks saw that the ships had been beached inside the wall. 
Kpoiaoc; ... BV 1tev8n l.u::yaAq> £lC&811'to 'tou 1tatOOC; EO''CepllJiEVOt;. (27a: 1-
2) 
Croesus was sitting in great grief, (having been) bereft of his son. 
Croesus was sitting in great grief, since he had been bereft of his son. 
The actions described by these participles in the perfect tense were 
necessarily completed prior to the action of the main verb. When the 
main verb is in a past tense, the perfect participles can often best be trans-
lated with the word "had" in English, as in the second translations of the 
examples above. 
Here are sentences with a pefect middle participle of the deponent verb 
acpt1(veo/-lat (with temporal augment: itc- augments to llC-, which becomes tr-
in aqiiY/-levcXC:;): 
op&Ot "Cae; vauc; 11011 de; 'tov At/-leva at:ptYJi£vac;. 
They see that the ships have already arrived at the harbor. 
doov "C&C; vauc; 110'11 dC; 'tov At).1Eva acptYJlEvac;. 
They saw that the ships had already arrived at the harbor. 
2. Perfective Aspect 
Perfect participles describe enduring states or conditions resulting 
from completed actions. Let us say that the gates were closed by the gate-
keeper at one moment in time; Greek would use the aorist tense here for 
simple action in past time. When Dicaeopolis and Philip arrived at Epi-
daurus, they found the gates closed (lC£K'A£l/-lEVtxC;, the enduring condition 
produced by the action of the person who shut them); Greek uses the perfect 
tense to describe this enduring result of a completed action. 
Greek thus distinguishes clearly between progressive, aorist, and 
perfective aspects: 
While closing the gates, the gatekeeper slipped and fell. 
(Closing would be translated with a present, progressive participle in 
Greek.)

Having closed I After closing I Closing the gates, the gatekeeper went 
home. 
(Having shut I After shutting I Shutting would be translated with an 
aorist participle in Greek, expressing a simple action, here one that 
took place just prior to the gatekeeper's departure for home.) 
Dicaeopolis and Philip found the gates having been closed I closed. 
(Having been closed I closed would be translated with a perfect passive 
participle in Greek, expressing the enduring result of the action com-
pleted by the gatekeeper.) 
The term perfect comes from a Latin verb meaning ~·to complete." 
The reduplication or augment in the perfect tense indicates that the verb 
expresses the enduring result of an action completed in the past. 
Here is an example that you are familiar with of a perfect active verb: 
oubEv 6p~ 6 q,{j"utTCOe;' 't,\)(pAOe; yap y£yovev. (10~:34) 
Philip sees nothing; for he has become = he is blind.

4. The Perfect Tense: MiddleIPassive Forms 
To form the perfect middle/passive of Afiro~ reduplicate the stem (i.e., 
put the first consonant + E before the stem, which appears here with short 
u), and add the primary middle/passive endings with no thematic vowel 
(0 or E) between the stem and the ending.

The above forms may be either middle or passive in sense, according 
to the context, e.g., AEAUJlIXt may mean either I have ransomed (middle 
sense) or I have been loosed (passive sense). 
Note: 
I. There is no thematic vowel (ole) between the stem and the ending. 
2. The reduplication is retained in all forms. 
3. The accents of the infinitive and participle are always on the next 
to the last syllable. 
4. The perfect middle/passive subjunctive and optative are per-

27. a

iphrastic, that is, they are formed from the perfect middle/passive 
participle plus the subjunctive and optative of the verb E1J..lL 
Note that contract verbs lengthen the stem vowel, e.g.: 
<{nA£-ro > 1tEq>tAT}-!lal 
'tt!lcX-ro > 'tE'tl!lT}-J..lat 
b11AO-ro > bEbllAro-!lat 
(For q>tAE- reduplicating to 1tEq>tA.E-, see 
Grammar 8, page 196.) 
5. The Pluperfect Tense: Indicative Only 
Look at these examples from the stories: 
EV !lEV yap 'tait; ~uV9TtKate; EtPl1'to on XPTt btKiie; !lEV btaq>oprov «XAATtAOte; 
btboVat Kat o£XEcr9at, eXEtV be EKa'tEpouc; & exoJ..lEv. 
(21~:5-7, with plu-
perfect of Etpro, I say; for principal parts, see page 195) 
For in the treaty it had been stated that (we) must give and accept arbi-
tration of our differences, and that each side should keep what we 
hold. 
'Ii yap aiv011 o-ocra ev !lE90piotC; 'tTle; 'A'tnKTle; Kat BOtro"Ct<xc;, e'tE'te1Xt(;n;o. 
(23a:4-5) 
For Denoe, being on the borders of Attica and Boeotia, had been forti-
fied. 
Kat yap 1tpOC; "Cou"COUC; aU"Cql SR£JtO{ll'to cru!lJ..laxtll. (27a:47) 
For an alliance had been made by him with them, too. 
The pluperfect records a state that existed in the past as the result of an 
action completed at some time more remote: £AEAullllV = I was free (at some 
time in the past) as a consequence of having been freed (at some earlier 
time) = I had been freed 
I was free. Only indicative forms appear in the 
pluperfect tense; there are no pluperfect subjunctives, optatives, impera-
tives, infinitives, or participles. 
6. The Pluperfect Tense: MiddleIPassive Fonns 
To form the pluperfect middle/passive indicative of Ai,ro, augment the 
reduplicated stem and add the secondary middle/passive endings with no 
thematic vowels. Again, the same forms serve as middle or passive. 
Indicative 
e-AE-Au-Wllv

The augment here indicates past time. The perfect tense describes an 
action as completed as of the present: I have come; the pluperfect describes 
an action as completed as of some time in the past: I had come. 
Verbs that augment in the perfect do not add an additional augment 
for the pluperfect, thus, {J'tepEm, I deprive; I bereave; perfect mid-
dle/passive, C(J't:EPrt~CXt, pluperfect middle/passive, ccr1:epllllrtv. 
7. The Dative of Agent with Perfect and Pluperfect Passives 
Note that with perfect and pluperfect passive verbs the dative case 
without a preposition is usually used to designate the person or agent by 
whom the action is carried out, instead of the preposition imo with the geni-
tive case, as is usual with passive verbs in other tenses, e.g.: 
iipya IlEyaAcx 1:a JlEV 'toiC; tIE A.A.Tt(H , 1:a oE tOte; {.iapl3apot<; etpycxcr1:at. 
Great deeds have been done. some by the Greeks, others by the barbar-
ians. 
Compare 24 tail:2-3, where the aorist passive and imo + gen. is used.

The Charioteer of Delphi 
Signs, Dreams, and Oracles 
In a world that was dangerous and controlled by gods who were arbitrary, 
the Greeks needed means of ascertaining the will of the gods. There were 
several ways of trying to do this. First, the gods were thought to send signs to 
men, particularly in the behavior of birds and in dreams. Interpretation of 
these signs was open to anyone, but throughout Greek history there were al-
ways prophets who were especially gifted in this sphere. In the second book of 
the Odyssey Telemachus, Odysseus's son, addressed an assembly of the peo-
ple of Ithaca, complaining of the behavior of Penelope's suitors: 
Zeus sent two eagles from the top of the mountain, which flew down close to 
each other on the breath of the wind. And when they reached the middle of 
the meeting place, they wheeled around and flapped their wings. They 
went for the heads of all who were there, and they foreboded death, tearing 
with their talons at their cheeks and necks; then they flew off on the right 
over the houses and city. The people were amazed at the birds when they 
saw them and wondered in their hearts what was destined to happen. The 
old hero Halitherses spoke to them, for he excelled all his generation in 
understanding birds and expounding omens: "Listen to me, men of 
Ithaca, I speak particularly to the suitors. Great trouble is rolling toward 
you, for Odysseus will not be long away .... " (Odyssey 2.146-164)

Such prophets were not always believed; on this occasion the leader of the 
suitors, Eurymachus, replied: 
"Old man, go home and prophesy to your children, in case they get into 
trouble. I can make a much better prophecy on this than you; lots of birds 
fly under the rays of the sun and not all bring omens: Odysseus died far 
away, and you should have died with him." (Odyssey 2.178-184) 
Dreams were also thought to be sent by the gods. In the first book of the 
Iliad, when the Greeks are struck by plague, Achilles called a meeting and 
said: "Let us consult a prophet (J.lavn<;) or a priest (tepeu<;) or an interpreter of 
dreams (for dreams also come from Zeus), who may tell us why Apollo is so 
angry with us" (Iliad 1.62-64). In the story of Adrastus, Croesus was warned 
by a dream, which revealed the truth of the disaster that was going to strike 
his son. 
If either states or individuals were in some serious dilemma and needed 
to know what to do, they had recourse to oracles. There were many oracles in 
Greece, but by far the most prestigious and wealthy at this time was Apollo's 
oracle at Delphi. It was consulted by inquirers from allover the Greek world 
and beyond. Apollo, god of light, music, poetry, healing, and prophecy, was a 
comparative latecomer to the Greek pantheon. He seems to have arrived at 
Delphi early in the eighth century, and his oracle rapidly acquired a high 
reputation. Grateful states and individuals showered gifts upon it, and by the 
sixth century the sanctuary was an elaborate complex. The Sacred Way 
wound up the hill toward the great temple. On either side of the way stood 
treasuries (little temples in which states stored their offerings) and 
dedications of statues and tripods. Above the temple was the theater, and high 
above this again was the stadium. 
Every four years games second in 
importance only to those of Olympia were held in honor of Apollo. The wealth 
and beauty of the sanctuary in its remote and awe-inspiring site on the slopes 
of the foothills of Mount Parnassus must have made a deep impression on all 
visitors. 
There were full-time priests or prophets (npoq>l1'tal) at Delphi. The priest-
ess (ft ITu9iu) was chosen from an ordinary family, a woman past middle age 
and of blameless life. She received no special training, since, when she 
prophesied, she was simply the mouthpiece of Apollo. The procedure for 
consulting the oracle was elaborate. Consultations were held only nine times 
a year. 
There were consequently always many state embassies and 
individuals waiting for their turn. At dawn the Pythia purified herself in the 
water of the Castalian spring. The priest then prepared to sacrifice a goat and 
tested the omens by sprinkling it with water. If the omens were satisfactory, 
the day was declared auspicious, and the Pythia was admitted to the inner 
sanctuary of the temple. There she drank sacred water and may have chewed 
laurel leaves (the laurel was sacred to Apollo) before ascending the sacred 
tripod. 
Inquirers purified themselves in the water of Castalia and offered a 
sacred cake on the altar outside the temple. On entering the temple they 

192 
Athenaze: Book II 
sacrificed a goat on the inner hearth where the eternal fire burned. They 
were then conducted to the inner sanctuary. They were told Uto think holy 
thoughts and speak well-omened words." The priest put the inquirer's 
question to the Pythia and brought back the answer, usually in verse form. 
The Greeks believed that when the Pythia sat on the sacred tripod, after 
completing the rituals, she was possessed by Apollo and "filled with god" 
(ev8eoC;). Descriptions certainly suggest that she fell into some kind of trance, 
in which her voice changed, like modern spiritualist mediums. 
It is probably true to say that the vast majority of Herodotus's contempo-
raries believed firmly in the Delphic oracle and that in a serious crisis they 
would choose to consult it, if they were rich enough to afford the procedure. In-
dividuals went for advice on religious questions, cult and pollution, and on 
practical questions, "Should I marry?" "Should I go 
abroad?,~ 
These 
individuals must have far outnumbered the deputations from the cities, but it 
is of the latter that we hear most in our sources. One of the most famous was 
the deputation sent by the Athenians when Xerxes' invasion was threatening. 
The moment the deputies had taken their seat in the inner sanctuary, before 
their question had been put, the Pythia exclaimed: "Unhappy men, why do you 
sit here? Leave your homes and flee to the ends of the earth .... For fire and 
war strike you down. . .. Be gone from my shrine, and steep your hearts in 
woe." The deputies were aghast, but, on the advice of a prominent Delphian, 
they went for a second consultation as suppliants and said: "Lord, give us a 
better answer about our country, respecting our suppliant branches." The 
second reply was ambiguous: 
"Pallas Athena cannot propitiate Olympian Zeus, though she prays to him 
with many words and all her skill. All else will be taken, . . . but far-see-
ing Zeus grants to Athena that only the wooden wall will be unsacked. Do 
not wait for the host of cavalry and infantry that come from the mainland 
but turn your backs and flee; yet some day you will face them. 0 divine 
Salamis, you will destroy the sons of women, when the grain is scattered 
or gathered in." (Herodotus 7.140-141) 
The answer was brought back to Athens, and a debate followed in which 
its meaning was discussed. Some of the older men said that the wooden wall 
meant the wall with which the Acropolis had once been fortified. Others said 
it meant their ships, and this view prevailed when Themistocles argued that 
the last two lines foretold the death not of Athenians but of their enemies, for 
Salamis is called "divine Salamis." 
If the oracle foretold their own 
destruction, it would have said "unhappy Salamis." This story illustrates the 
difficulty of interpreting some of Apollo's oracles correctly and the 
seriousness with which the oracles were treated. It is impossible for us to 
distinguish which oracles quoted by Herodotus are genuine and which forged 
later to suit past events (the first oracle given the Athenians in the case above 
certainly rings true). In any case the prestige of Delphi survived, and states 
and individuals consulted Apollo throughout Greek history until the oracle 
was closed in A.D. 390 by a Roman emperor in the name of Christianity.

WORD BUILDING 
If you know the meaning of each part of a compound word, you can usually 
deduce the meaning of the word as a whole. Give the meaning of each part of 
the following compound words and then the meaning of the whole: 
Compound words formed by prefixing an adverb or a-privative: 
1. 
euyevft~, -E~ 
3. 
Eut'UX"~, 
5. 
allt:X9ft~, -E~ 
2. 
o'Uayevft~, -e~ 
4. 
atUxft~, 
6. 
&ElIlVl1(nO~, -ov 
Note that compound adjectives have the same form for masculine and femi-
nine. 
Compound words formed by combining the stem of an adjective with another 
word: 
1. 
cpt1av9pro1to~, -ov 
3.

GRAMMAR 
8. Perfect Reduplication and Augment 
Most verbs form their perfect and pluperfect by reduplication or aug-
ment as described in Grammar 1 above, but note the following: 
a. If the verb starts with one of the aspirated stops, cp (labial), 9 (dental), 
or X (velar), the reduplication uses the unaspirated equivalents of 
these consonants, namely, Tt, t, and 1<:, e.g.: 
cpt1Ero > 1tEcp{111llat 
9a1ttro > te9allll<xt 
xpaollat> 1<:EXPl1IlCn 
b. If the verb starts with a vowel or double consonant (~, ~, or W), it does 
not reduplicate but augments, e.g.: 
&yye1/"'ro > llYYE/"'llat 
acpt1<:VEOj.lat [1.1<:-] > acpt'Yllat 
Oi1<:Ero > '91<:l1llctt 
~ll'tero > e~ft'tl1llat 
~EV{~ro > E:~EVtcrllat 
\IIEUOOllat> eWeUcrllctt 
The augment, just as the reduplication, is retained in all forms, e.g.: 
Tt'Y'Ye/"'j.lEVO<;, c9Kllcr9at. £WEUaj.levo<;. 

27. 0 
K POI :E 0 LEn ITO N K Y P 0 N L T PAT EYE T A I 
(~) 197 
c. If the verb starts with two consonants~ in most cases the first is redu-
plicated, e.g.: 
)'p&cpro > yeypa)..q.w. t 
f3AO:1t1:Ol > f3ef3AajlJlat 
In some combinations, there is augment instead of reduplication, 
e.g.: 
()1( -
OK01tEOl [oKe1t-] > eo K e jl Jla t 
yv-
yt'yvc.OO"KOl [YVOl-] > eYVOlOJlat

Croesus was sitting in great grief, bereft of his son. 
d. For Attic reduplication~ see the list of principal parts on page 235. 
9. Perfect and Pluperfect Middle/Passive of Verbs with Stems Ending 
in Consonants 
When the stem of the verb ends in a consonant, sound and spelling 
changes take place. The 3rd person plural of the indicative and all the 
subjunctives and optatives are periphrastic and consist of a perfect 
middle/passive participle and a form of the verb "to be." The extremely 
rare perfect imperative is not given in the charts below. Be sure you are 
able to identify the markers for voice, mood, person, and number of these 
forms when you see them.

Read the following passages (adapted from Herodotus 5.92) and answer the 
comprehension questions: 
The following story from Herodotus is concerned with events a hundred 
years before the time of Croesus. In the seventh century a family called the 
Bacchiadae ruled Corinth. They received an oracle that the child born to 
Labda, wife of Eetion, would overthrow them. They decided to kill the child 
as soon as it was born. The child survived and became tyrant of Corinth 
about 650 B. C .

We are afraid that the slaves have not already loosed the oxen. 
c. Optative:

He asked whether the slaves had already loosed the oxen. 
d. Imperative: 
Very rare; Achilles, addressing the body of Hector, whom he has just 
slain, uses the perfect imperative, 'ts9vaSl, be dead! (Iliad 22.365), 
The forms of the perfect imperative are not given in the chart below.

All these perfect verb forms describe states or conditions existing as a 
result of completed actions. The state or condition described is ongoing or 
permanent: Ot OOuAat 1:0U~ J3ou~ 11011 AEAUKUOIV; this sentence states that the 
slaves have already loosed the oxen and that the oxen are still loose now, 
in present time. 
In indirect questions and indirect statements when the leading verb 
is in a past tense, the perfect tense forms will be translated with "had" in 
English to show completion of the action prior to the time of the leading 
verb (see the third and last examples above). 
2. The - lCa 1st Perfect Active: Forms 
Some verbs have -Ka in the perfect active, and some have only -(X (see 
below, Grammar 7, pages 210-211). We call the former -1(a 1st perfect 
active and the latter -a 2nd perfect active. Both types reduplicate or 
augment the stem, as does the perfect middle/passive (see Chapter 27, 
Grammar 1, pages 183-184, and Grammar 8, pages 196-197). Perfects in 
-Ka then have endings as shown below. Remember that the perfect stem 
of A.f>O) has a short u, and note the accent of the infinitive. The perfect im-
perative is rare and is not shown in the chart below.

3. The Perfect Tense: Stems 
Contract verbs lengthen the stem vowel, e.g.: 
'ttl .. ux-w> 1:E-ctJ,t11-KCt 
q>tAE-ro > 1tE<PtAl1-KCX 
bl1Ao-ro > bEbnAW-KCt 
Consonant stems: 
a. Verbs with stems ending in dentals (b, 9) and ~ drop the final conso-
nant, e.g.: 
bdb-ro > be-bot-Ko. 
1td9-0> > 1tE-1tEl-KCX 
voJ,tH~-ro > VE-VOJ,tt-KCt 
h. Some verbs with stems ending in liquids (A, p) and nasals (J,t. v) drop 
the final consonant of the stem, e.g.: 
Kplv-o> > KE-Kpt-KCX 
Others extend the stem with an E, which is lengthened to 11 in the per-
fect, e.g.: 
• 
I

The perfect tense denotes or records a state that is the result of an ac-
tion completed in the past (see Chapter 27, Grammar 2, page 184) and thus 
describes a present state. Many verbs in the perfect tense can therefore 
best be translated with the present tense in English, e.g.: 
ano~8vft(jKro: perfect [8vl1-] 'tE8v11Ka (no prefix in the perfect tense) = I 
have died and therefore I am dead 
01, '!E8v11KQ-tE<; = the dead 
lcr'tT\J.n: perfect [a"t11~] EatTllCU = I have stood up and therefore I stand 
~u{vro: perfect [~T\-] ~e~T\lCa = I have taken a step, made a stand, and 
therefore I stand; I stand firm; I am set 
5. The Pluperfect Tense: Indicative Only 
01, OOUADt 1:01><; ~ou<; EA.EA.UlCEac:xv 1tptV KU'CcxoUV(n 'tOY +lAtOV. 
The slaves had loosed the oxen before the sun set. 
The pluperfect records a state that existed in the past as the result of an ac-
tion completed at some time more remote. It will normally be translated 
with "had" in English. 
Note the following sentences with verbs in the pluperfect from the 
reading passage at the beginning of this chapter: 
ton: 5e on CX"lh6<; 1:£ avepepTl1cet KCXL Kcn' CXU1:0V aAAOt TIepaErov av-
E~atVov. (11-12) 
And then indeed he himself had climbed up, and others of the Per-
sians were climbing up after him. 
(The action of Hyroeades was completed before the others ascended, 
and hence the pluperfect aVe~E~f}Ket is appropriate, but sometimes, as 
here, the pluperfect is used to describe a past action that occurs so sud-
denly as to be almost simultaneous with another or other past actions. 
Thus, the others climbed up almost at the same moment at which Hy-
roeades had made his ascent.)

And Croesus, seeing him coming against (him), because of his pre-
sent misfortune had gotten into a state of heedlessness = was paying 
no heed, nor was it making any difference to him at all whether he 
died. 

210 
Athenaze: Book II 
(The pluperfect 1tctPTlI..lEA.'~KEt implies that Croesus had gotten into a 
state of heedlessness by the time he was attacked; therefore at that 
moment in time he was not caring whether he died or not.) 
6. The -K'll 1st Pluperfect Active: Forms 
Verbs that reduplicate the stem in the perfect are augmented with E to 
form the pluperfect:

7. The - a 2nd Perfect Active and the - 11 2nd Pluperfect Active 
Some verbs in the perfect and pluperfect active do not have the K that 
appears in all the forms given above; we call these -ct 2nd perfects and -1} 
2nd pluperfects. Here are examples: 
o <I>G\.t1t1tOC; 1:UCPAOC; yeyovEv. 
Philip has become = is blind. 
lAEroc; lath !lOt 'tmpA,i?> yeyovott. (17~:50-51) 
Be propitious to me having become blind. 
Be propitious to me who have become blind. 
Be propitious to me who am blind. 
-ct 2nd perfect active and -11 2nd pluperfect active: 
Present: YPO:<p-ffi 
-ct 2nd perfect active: ye-ypctcp-ct 
-11 2nd pluperfect active: E-YE-ypalP-l1 
Present: EPXO~ctt 
-ct 2nd perfect active: EA~Auf)-a 
-11 2nd pluperfect active: EAllAuf)-ll (rare) 
The endings for the -a 2nd perfect and the -11 2nd pluperfect are the 
same as for the -Ka 1st perfect and the -1(11 1st pluperfect given in Gram-

mar 2 and Grammar 6 above. The periphrastic forms of the subjunctive 
and optative are, with few exceptions, the only ones used. 
Most verbs with stems in labials (~, 1t, <p) and velars (y, 1(', X) form -a 
2nd perfects and -11 2nd pluperfects and usually aspirate the final conso-
nant of the stem if it is not already aspirated, e.g.: 
KPU1t-'t-oo: [KPU<p-] KE-Kpu<p-a 
liy-oo: [&.y-J fix-a 
'ta't'too: ['Lay-] 
-CE--C!XX-a 
OE1KVUIlt: [b£11(-] bE-beLx-a 
Note the change of vowel from e to ° or from e1 to Ot or 0 in verbs with 
-a perfects and -11 pluperfects, e.g.: 
1tEIl1t-OO > 1tE1tO Il<p-a 
rcPE1t-ffi > 'tE'Lpo<p-a 
Ad1t-00 > AEAOt1t-a 
K'tdv-oo > EK'Cov-a 
Note: for <pEP-ffi, the perfect stem evg.K- gives perfect EvltvQX-a (for the

Rationalism and Mysticism 
In the essay on Greek science and medicine (Chapter 11), we saw that the 
Ionian cosmologists attempted to explain the world in terms of natural causa-
tion. This intellectual revolution involved rejection of the old mythical ex-
planations of phenomena and led inevitably to criticism of the traditional re-
ligion, to agnosticism, and to atheism. The criticisln was not all destructive. 
For instance, the poet and philosopher Xenophanes, born ca. 570 B.C., attacked 
the immorality of the gods as they are portrayed in myth: "Homer and Resiod 
attributed to the gods all that is a shame and a rebuke to men, theft, adultery, 
and deceit" (Kirk and Raven, The Presocratic Philosophers, Cambridge,

1964, page 169). He criticizes anthropomorphism: "The Ethiopians say that 
their gods are snub-nosed and black, the Thracians that theirs are blue-eyed 
and red-haired .... There is one god, like mortals neither in body nor in 
thought" (ibid., pages 171 and 173). (See the Classical Greek readings on page 
202.) 
An example of the agnostic is provided by Protagoras, the first and great-
est of the sophists (see essay, Chapter 24), who begins his work On the Gods as 
follows: "Concerning the gods, I am unable to discover whether they exist or 
not, or what they are like in form" (Protagoras, fragment 4). 
The clearest surviving statement of the atheist's position is a fragment 
from a play by Critias (born ca. 460 B . C . ) : 
There was a time when the life of men was disorderly and beast-
like .... Then, as I believe, man laid down laws to chastise, and who-
ever sinned was punished. Then when the laws prevented men from 
open deeds of violence but they continued to commit them in secret, I be-
lieve that a man of shrewd and subtle mind invented for men the fear of 
the gods, so that there might be something to frighten the wicked even if 
they acted, spoke, or thought in secret. From this motive he introduced 
the conception of divinity. (Translated by Guthrie, The Sophists, Cam-
bridge, 1971, pages 82 and 243) 
The sixth century saw the development of religious ideas that were to have 
profound influence on Western thought, including Christian theology. The 
central tenet of this new mysticism was the duality of body and soul. The soul 
was conceived as a spiritual entity that existed before its confinement in the 
body and that survives the body's dissolution. This teaching was attributed to 
a poet-prophet named Orpheus, who was said to have lived in Thrace; his fol-
lowers were called Orphics. Little is known about their beliefs. We are on 
firmer ground with Pythagoras, who seems to have incorporated Orphic be-
liefs into his teaching. Born ca. 550 B.C. in Samos, he settled in southern 
Italy, where he founded a religious community of men and women. He is 
best remembered today as a mathematician, but he also taught a way of life 
that was based on the belief that our present life is but a preparation for a fur-
ther life or lives. The soul is divine and immortal; in successive reincarna-
tions it is imprisoned in the body, and in its lives it must try to rid itself of 
bodily impurity by living as well as possible. Eventually it may be freed 
from the cycle of life and death and return to its divine origins. 
The beliefs we have outlined were those of a limited circle of intellectuals, 
but the ordinary Greeks, who adhered to the traditional religion, could also 
find comfort in mysteries. There were various mystery cults in different 
parts of Greece, of which the most important were the Eleusinian mysteries. 
Starting as an ancient agrarian cult in honor of Demeter, goddess of grain, 
these mysteries by the middle of the seventh century offered initiates a 
blessed afterlife, from which the uninitiated were excluded: "Blessed is the 
man among mortals on earth who has seen these things. But he who has not 
taken part in the rites and has no share in them, he never knows these good 

214 
Athenaze: Book II 
things when he is dead beneath the grim darkness" (Homeric Hymn to 
Demeter, ca. 625 B.C.). 
The mysteries were open to all, men and women, Athenians and foreign-
ers, slave and free. On the first day of the festival, the sacred herald made a 
proclamation, inviting all who wished to be initiated to assemble; they were 
warned that they must be of pure hands and "have a soul conscious of no evil 
and have lived well and justly." After three days of sacrifice and prepara-
tion, the initiates (l!uO'tcn), numbering over 10,000, made their pilgrimage of 
fourteen miles or twenty-two and a half kilometers from Athens to Eleusis, 
led by the officials of the Eleusinian cult. The last day was spent in fasting 
and sacrifice. In the evening the rites were performed in the Hall of the 
Mysteries. The rites were secret, and all who participated took a vow of 
silence, so that we know very little of what happened. At the climax of the 
ceremony, in the darkness of the night, the iepo<pclv'tll<; (revealer of holy 
things) appeared in a brilliant light and revealed the holy objects. We are 
told that these included a sheaf of grain, which may have had symbolical 
significance, offering the hope of resurrection. 
The cult of Eleusis, with its emphasis on moral as well as ritual purity 
and with the hope it offered the initiates of a blessed life hereafter, answered a 
deep spiritual need. The mysteries were celebrated with unbroken continuity 
from the archaic age until the site at Eleusis was finally devastated by Alaric 
the Goth in A.D. 395. "In a civilization where official religion did little to 
support the soul, Eleusis provided some comfort to those who faced the anxi-
eties of this world and the next" (Parke, Festivals of the Athenians, London, 
Thames & Hudson, 1977, page 71).

9. The Verb otoa 
The verb oiBa is an irregular -a 2nd perfect (see above, Grammar 8) 
formed from the stem ib- (originally Flb-, pronounced wid, cf. Latin 
video, "I see"), which appears also in eioov, I saw. The verb otoa means I 
have found out = I know, and is present in meaning. The corresponding 
pluperfect ijOll or nbEtV means I had found out = I was aware, was know-
ing; I knew, and is imperfect in meaning. As seen in the chart below, the

stem dS-; the indicative and imperative are irregular and must be care-

Athenaze: Book II 
AAAOI AOrOl:, nEPI TOY KPOIIOY 
The lyric poet Bacchylides was born on the island of Ceos ca. 524 B. C . 
N one of his poetry was known to us until 1896, when a papyrus was found in 
Egypt containing the remains of fourteen odes in honor of victors in the great 
games and four odes in honor of Dionysus. All Bacchylides' poems belong to 
the genre called "choral lyric," that is to say, poems written for public per~ 
formance, usually on religious occasions, by a chorus that sang the poem to 
the accompaniment of flute and lyre and expressed the drama of the poem 
through dance. Such performances had been a central part of Greek festivals 
since the Bronze Age and took place everywhere in Greece. 
The lines below are part of a poem commissioned to celebrate the victory 
of Hieron, tyrant of Syracuse, in the chariot race at the Olympic Games of 468 
B.C. This was the most prestigious of all victories in the games and would 
have been celebrated on Hieron's return to Syracuse at a religious festival. 
The dialect of choral lyric by tradition had a Doric coloring, most clearly 
seen in the predominance of long u, e.g., apxCJ.Y£T.iiv = apxr\'YET.'Ilv (as an aid in 
reading, Attic equivalents are given for words glossed in the notes with Doric 
spellings). Other features of the genre are swift changes of direction in 
thought or scene, the abbreviated form in which mythical examples are given 
(it is assumed that the story is known to the audience, and the poet concen-
trates on the dramatic moments), and the free use of colorful compound adjec~ 
tives, often coined for the particular context. 
In choral odes the central feature is often a myth, which is more or less 
closely connected with the main subject of the poem. Croesus was an histori-
cal figure, but his story is here told as a myth. In Bacchylides' version Croe-
sus builds the pyre himself and ascends it with his family in order to commit 
suicide and so avoid slavery. Apollo rescues him and takes him and his 
family to live with the Hyperboreans, a legendary people who live in the far 
North. The connection with Hieron is that both were exceptionally generous 
to Delphi and both were rewarded for their generosity.

In this chapter we return to excerpts from Thucydides' account of the Pelo-
ponnesian War. That war has been described as a struggle between an ele-
phant and a whale; the Athenians could not face the Peloponnesian army in 
the field} and the Peloponnesians could not risk a naval battle against the 
Athenian fleet. In this chapter we give Thucydides' accounts of two naval 
victories achieved by the Athenian admiral Phormio against heavy odds in 
the summer of 429 B.C. These victories were decisive; the Peloponnesians 
were forced to acknowledge the naval supremacy of the Athenians not only in 
the Aegean but also here in the Gulf of Corinth (Kpl(jatO~ KOA.1tO<;), and they 
made no attempt to challenge the Athenians by sea throughout the rest of the 
Archidamian War, i.e., until the truce of 421 B.C.

Thucydides 
Thucydides was born about 455 B.C. of a noble Athenian family, probably 
related to that of the aristocratic Cimon. Little is known about his life. He 
suffered from the plague (2.48). He was general in 424 B.C. and was exiled 
for failing to prevent Brasidas from taking the strategic city of Amphipolis 
(4.105-106 and see page 113 above). He returned to Athens in 404 B.C. after 
the end of the war and died there about 400 B.C. In the introduction to his his-
tory (1.1), he says that he began writing it as soon as war broke out, feeling 
certain that it would be the most important war in history up to his time. He 
died before completing it, breaking off abruptly in his account of 411 B.C. 
Unlike Herodotus, Thucydides was writing the history of events through 
which he had lived and at many of which he had himself been present. Even 
so, he is well aware of the difficulty of getting the facts right. In his introduc-
tion (1.22) he discusses this problem: 
With regard to the factual reporting of the events in the war, I did not 
think it right to give the account of the first man I happened to meet, nor to 
give my personal impressions, but I have examined each question with a 
view to the greatest possible accuracy both in events at which I was present 
myself and in those of which I heard from others. But it was a laborious 
business to find the truth, because eyewitnesses at each event did not give 
the same report about it, but their reports differed according to their par-
tiality to either side or their powers of memory. 
It should be remembered that his sources were not only Athenian. His long 
exile gave him the chance of making inquiries on the other side. He says 
(1.22) that the absence of the storytelling element (to Jlu8&8EC;) may make his 
history less attractive to his audience: 

29.

I shall be satisfied if those who want to examine an accurate account of 
events that happened in the past and that are likely to be repeated some 
time in the future in similar form, human nature being what it is, find 
my history usefuL It is composed to be a possession forever (K'tllflO: E~ 
aiei), not a performance to please an immediate public. 
So there are lessons to be learned from his history, especially by states~ 
men. Although Thucydides restricts his history to military and political 
events, it is human nature, as revealed in both individual and social psy~ 
chology, that most interests him. When, for instance, he has given a clinical 
account of the physical symptoms and effects of the plague (2.49-51), he goes 
on to discuss its psychological effects on the Athenian people (2.52-53). 
Such passages of explicit analysis are rare. More often Thucydides uses 
speeches to show motives, underlying causes of events, and principles at 
stake. These speeches are placed at key points throughout most of the history. 
For example, when the Spartans send their final ultimatum, the Athenians 
debate their reply 
Chapter 21). Of this debate, Thucydides quotes one 
speech only, that of Pericles (1.140-44). In his speech, which extends to five 
printed pages, Pericles not only gives reasons for rejecting the Spartan ulti-
matum but also outlines the military and economic resources of each side 
and the strategy on which they should conduct the war, which he considered 
inevitable. The following narrative shows this strategy put into practice. 
The speech enables the reader to understand why the Athenians acted as they 
did. 
Although fewer than thirty years separate the publication of Herodotus's 
history from that of Thucydides, there is a great gulf between them, which is 
not to be explained simply by the personalities of the authors. Herodotus was a 
child of the old order, accepting traditional values and beliefs. Thucydides is 
a product of the sophistic movement. He always searches for rational expla-
nations of events, is sceptical in matters of religion, discounts oracles, and is 
austerely scientific in intent. Despite the austerity of his narrative, which 
appears impartial and impersonal even when he is writing of himself, his 
deep feelings are apparent from the way he tells the story, notably, for in-
stance, in his description of the defeat of the Athenian fleet in the Great Har-
bor of Syracuse, which sealed the fate of the expedition to Sicily and ulti-
mately led to the downfall of Athens.

The philosopher in his study can analyze political situations logically; he 
can propose hypotheses and produce ideal solutions to problems. The 
politician, however, agonizes in the sphere of the practical; he is beset by a 
recurring cycle of crises, for which the therapy is empirical. Whatever 
his ideology, in the event, he is guided not by dogma or theoretical analy-
sis but by pragmatic considerations.

The Downfall of Athens 
The essay in Chapter 23 carried the story of the Peloponnesian War as far 
as the Peace of Nicias, concluded by Sparta and Athens in 421 B.C., when both 
sides were physically and economically exhausted by the ten years' war. 
There was little hope of the peace holding. It was not accepted by Corinth and 
Boeotia, and at Athens a rival to the peace-loving Nidas appeared in the per-
son of Alcibiades, a cousin and ward of Pericles, rich, handsome, unscrupu-
lous, and ambitious. Opposing Nicias, who did all he could to preserve peace-
ful relations with Sparta, Aldbiades initiated a policy of backing Argos, 
Sparta's old rival in the Peloponnesus, and forming a coalition of states that 
were dissatisfied with Spartan leadership. In 419 B.C. a sporadic war broke 
out, in which Athens was halfheartedly involved as the ally of Argos, but in 
418 B.C. Sparta inflicted a crushing defeat on Argos and re-established her 
hegemony in the Peloponnesus, while the Athenians became interested in 
other imperial ventures. 
In the winter of 416/415 B.C. the Athenians made the fateful decision to 
add Sicily to their empire. They were given a pretext for intervention by the 
arrival of ambassadors from a small Sicilian city, which asked for help 
against a neighboring city, which was backed by the greatest city in the West, 
Syracuse. When the matter was debated in the Assembly, Nicias advised 
caution, but Alcibiades argued strongly in favor of the venture. His view 
prevailed. In a burst of enthusiasm, the people voted for an expedition and for 
all the resources that the generals in command (Nicias, Alcibiades, and La-
machus) required. 
The expedition departed in midsummer 415 B.C.: "It was," says Thucy-
dides, "the most costly and splendid force that ever sailed from one Greek 
city." It was dogged by disaster. No sooner had it arrived in Sicily than Al-
cibiades was recalled to stand trial on a charge trumped up by his political 
enemies, but he jumped ship and fled to Sparta, where he advised the authori-
ties to send help to Syracuse, which the Athenians were by now besieging. 
Just as the Athenians were about to complete an encircling wall around Syra-
cuse, a Spartan relief force arrived and saved the city (winter 414 B.C .). Ni-
das decided to lift the siege and retire by sea, but the Syracusans blocked the 
entrance to the Great Harbor, and in the battle that followed the Athenian fleet 
suffered a crushing defeat. Nicias decided to destroy what was left of the fleet 
and retreat over land; his army was split up into two halves. Both were am-
bushed and annihilated: 
This was the greatest action which took place in this war, . . . the most 
brilliant for the victors and the most disastrous for the conquered; for they 
were utterly defeated at all points and after undergoing the extremities of 
suffering were completely annihilated, infantry, ships, and all. Few of 
the many returned home. 
(Thucydides 7.87) 
Despite this terrible loss, the Athenians immediately began to build a new 

242

fleet and fought on for another nine years. This last phase of the war was 
quite different from what had gone on before. It was a war of movement, 
fought all over the Aegean. The Spartans, who bartered away the freedom of 
the Ionian Greeks for Persian gold, built a fleet and roused most of the Athe-
nian Empire to revolt. In 411 B.C. Athens, reduced to desperate straits, under-
went an oligarchic revolution. This was fostered by Alcibiades, who had now 
fled from Sparta to the Persians and undertook to win Persian support for 
Athens if the Athenians would modify their extreme democracy and recall 
him. The people agreed that the franchise should be limited to the 5,000 richest 
citizens and that for the moment there should be a provisional government 
formed by a council of 400. No sooner were the 400 in power than they tried to 
make their position permanent and began to negotiate peace terms with 
Sparta. A counterrevolution followed. The Assembly deposed the 400 and 
instituted the moderate democracy originally proposed, government by the 
5,000. Alcibiades was elected general in his absence and won a brilliant 
victory at Cyzicus, annihilating the Spartan fleet. This was followed by the 
restoration of the radical democracy at Athens and a series of operations in 
which Athens recovered most of her empire in the north Aegean. In 407 B. C . 
Alcibiades returned to Athens and received a hero's welcome. 
A new Spartan commander, Lysander, was soon to change the situation. 
With Persian support, he rebuilt the Spartan fleet and defeated a squadron of 
Alcibiades' fleet. Alcibiades, although he was not present at the battle, fear-
ing the volatility of the demos, fled to a castle, which he had prepared as a 
refuge in the Hellespont. The following year (405 B.C.) the Athenians won 
another major victory at Arginusae, destroying over half the Spartan fleet. 
In 405 B.C., however, Lysander, again in command, made a surprise attack 
on the Athenian fleet when it was beached at Aegospotami and annihilated it. 
This was the end for Athens. When the news reached the Piraeus, "A 
wail of lamentation spread from the Piraeus through the Long Walls to the 
city; and on that night not a man slept" (Xenophon, Hellenica 2.2.3). The 
Spartans now controlled the seas. They did not attack Athens but proceeded to 
starve her into submission. At last, when the people were desperate, they sent 
envoys to Sparta to discuss terms of surrender. The Peloponnesian League 
was summoned to discuss the issue. The majority voted for the utter destruc-
tion of Athens and the enslavement of the whole population, but Sparta re-
sisted these savage terms. Eventually it was settled that Athens should sur-
render her whole empire; the entire fleet except for twelve triremes was to be 
handed over; all exiles were to return, and Athens should become an ally of 
Sparta.

Hera and Athena shake hands. 
Hera was the patron goddess of Samos. After the Athenian defeat at Aegospotami, all the 
subject states of the Athenian Empire except Samos revolted. In gratitude for this loyalty, 
the Athenians passed a decree praising the Samians and making them Athenian citizens. 
In 403 B.C. this marble stele was set up on the Acropolis with the decree inscribed below 
the figures of Hera and Athena.

1. Complex Sentences in Indirect Statement: Primary Sequence 
When complex sentences (Le., sentences containing a main clause 
and a subordinate clause) are stated indirectly after a leading verb in the 
present, future, or perfect tense (primary sequence), no changes in the 
tenses or moods of the verbs in the original sentence are made except to 
substitute an infinitive or participle for the finite verb in the main clause 
of the original sentence, as required by the introductory verb, e.g.: 
a. Direct statement:

If Philip said this, he was lying. 
Indirect Statement with AEyn + Ott or me;

OiOE 1:0V q,tAt1t1tOV 'I'E'UOOJ.l.EVOV, ei 'tou'to Et1tEV. 
He/She knows that Philip was lying, if he said this 
(Note that the imperfect indicative t'l'EUOE'tO of the original statement 
remains unchanged after 01:t and is replaced by a present infinitive 
and a present participle after <J>llcri and OtOE respectively. The present 
infinitive and participle represent progressive, continuous, ongoing 
action and so can substitute here for the imperfect indicative of the 
direct statement.) 
b. The particle av must be retained with the infinitive and participle 
constructions as well as with the indicative construction in indirect 
speech, e.g.:

A.ristophanes and Old Comedy 
In 486 B.C. a prize was first offered for a comedy in the dramatic competi-
tion at the Greater Dionysia, which until then had been for tragedies only. At 
the time of Aristophanes' first play (427 B.C.), three comedies were put on ev-
ery year at the Lenaea, a festival of Dionysus held in January, and three at 
the Greater Dionysia, held in March. 
The theater of Dionysus, in which both tragedies and comedies were per-
formed, consisted of a circular dancing place (6pXrlcr'Tpa) about sixty-six feet or 
twenty meters in diameter (see illustration, page 258). Behind it was the au-
ditorium, rising in concentric rows up the south slope of the Acropolis. In 
front of it was the stage (cr1crjvit), a permanent set representing a building with 
two doors. The stage was raised slightly above the level of the orchestra. In 
both tragedy and comedy the chorus played a leading role. In comedy they 
numbered twenty-four. Whereas the actors spoke their dialogue, the chorus 
sang their lyrics to the accompaniment of the lyre and flute. 
Aristophanes' first play, the Banqueters, was produced in 427 B.C., his 
last extant play, Wealth, in 388 B.C. Eleven of his comedies survive, the ear-
liest being the Acharnians, which won fIrst prize at the Lenaea in 425 B. C . 
When this play was produced, Athens had been at war for more than five 
years. The people had suffered terribly from the plague, and the war seemed 
a stalemate. The farmers suffered the most, abandoning their farms every 
year when the Peloponnesians invaded in late spring, living in the city un-
der appalling conditions during the invasions, and returning home to find 
their crops destroyed and their vines cut down. The heroes of several of 
Aristophanes' plays, including Dicaeopolis in the Acharnians, are war-
weary farmers. 
We last saw the family of Dicaeopolis when Philip was left behind in 
Athens to continue his schooling (Chapter 24), The rest of the family returned 
to the country when the Peloponnesians withdrew from Attica, only to return 
to the city every year when the Peloponnesians invaded in late spring. In 
reading the words of Dicaeopolis in the Acharnians you will hear the voice 
that Aristophanes gave him. He dreams of peace, and after being rebuffed in 
the normal course of political activity in the Assembly, he makes his own 
separate peace with Sparta. At the end of the selections from the play that you 
will read in this chapter, he joyfully assembles his family and celebrates his 
private peace with a sacred procession and a song in honor of Dionysus.

GRAMMAR 
1. Complex Sentences in Indirect Statement: Secondary Sequence 
If the introductory verb is in a past tense (imperfect, aorist, or pluper-
fect), the following rules for secondary sequence apply: 
a. An indicative verb in the main clause of the direct statement may be 
retained or may be changed to the corresponding tense of the optative 
when the indirect statement is introduced by on or roc; in secondary 
sequence (see Chapter 25, Grammar 6, pages 155-156), e.g.: 
Direct Statement: 
ei 0 <I>iA.t1t1toC; tou'Co Et1teV, ElV£uau't'o. 
If Philip said this, he lied. 
Indirect Statement: 
(past particular condition) 
d1tEV ott/roc; ei 0 <I>tA.l1t1tOC; 'CoutO fi1tEV. ElV£uauto/lV£ua(lt't'o. 
He I She said that if Philip said this, he lied. 
Note, however, that an indicative with uv in the main clause of con-
trary to fact conditions is retained after ott or roc;, e.g.: 
Direct Statement: 
ei () <I>iA.t1t1toC; 10U1:0 ei1tEV. ElVeuaIX-ro av. 
(past contrary to fact condition) 
If Philip had said this~ he would have lied. 
Indirect Statement: 
et1tEV on/roc; ei 0 <I>tA.t1t1tOC; 1:0U1:0 ei1tEV I tlVEUaU1:0 av. 
He I She said that if Philip had said this, he would have lied. 
With eC!>l1 and ~OEt this sentence would be as follows: 
eC!>l1 1:0V <I>tA.t7t1tOV 'l'e1laua9at av. Ei touto Et1tl::V. 
He I She said that Philip would have lied, if he had said this. 
iiOEt tOY <I>tA.t1t1tOV lV£\)O'clJ.l.£VOV av, ei 'COU1:0 et1tEv. 
He I She knew that Philip would have lied, if he had said this. 
b. Secondary tenses of the indicative in the subordinate clause of the di-
rect statement remain unchanged in mood and tense when put into 
indirect statements. See the examples above, in which the verbs in the 
subordinate clauses remain unchanged. 
c. Primary tenses of the indicative in the subordinate clause of the direct 
statement may be retained or may be changed to the optative, e.g.: 
Direct Statement: 
ei () c:I>tA.t1t7tOC; 1:0UtO ).,£1£1., 'VEUOE1:CXt. 
If Philip says this, he is lying. 
(present particular condition) 

272 
Athenaze: Book II 
Indirect Statement: 
dn:EV on/roc; ei 0 ~{A.l1t1tOC; 'tOU1:0 A£,,(£1./A£,,(01., 'l'EUOe1:(U. 
He / She said that if Philip was saying this, he was lying. 
(Note that we switch to the past tense in English, where Greek keeps 
the present tense; and note that 'l'eUOE't<Xt could have been changed to 
'l'EUOOt'W according to rule a above.) 
d. All subjunctives (with or without av) in the subordinate clause of the 
direct statement may be retained or may be changed to the correspond-
ing tenses of the optative (cav becomes ti, o1:av becomes 01:E, XptV av be-
comes 1tpiv, etc., i.e., the av drops out when the subjunctive is changed 
to optative). 
Greek writers often chose not to make the optional 
changes to the optative but to retain the original indicatives or sub
M 
junctives for the sake of vividness. 
Direct Statement: 
, 
, 
I 
sav O'tPCX-C£Ull'tcxt Kpo'tcro<; En:t IIepcriic;, ~Ey&A.TlV apx,r\v K<X'taA.Uact. 
If Croesus wages war against the Persians, he will destroy a great 
empire. 
(future more vivid condition) 
Indirect Statement without Changes: 
" OE IIu9h, 1:aOE Ct1tEKplV(l'tO, O·tt eav O''tpcx'te,srrrat Kpoicro;; ext IIepcriic;, 
~EyaA.Tlv apXltv ICcxtflil.ila£1.. 
(27a:32-33) 
And the Pythia answered these things, that if Croesus waged war 
against the Persians, he would destroy a great empire. 
(The eav + subjunctive in the original subordinate clause and the 
future indicative in the original main clause are here retained in the 
indirect statement. See rules a and d above.) 
Indirect Statement with Changes: 
ft oe IIu9iTl 'taoE a1tcKplva:to, Ott ei O''tpcx't£U01.'to Kpoicrot; e1tt IIepcrac;, 
~EyaA.Tlv apXltv ICCX't flA-D 0' 0 1.. 
And the Pythia answered these things, that if Croesus waged war 
against the Persians, he would destroy a great empire. 
(Optatives are here substituted in both clauses, with eav changing to d. 
Again, see rules a and d above.) 
e. All optatives in the direct statement remain unchanged in mood and 
tense after on or mc;. 
Direct Statement: 
Ei 0 ~iA.t1t1to<; 1:ou'to £f1tot, V£u8ot'to lXv. (future less vivid condition) 
If Philip should say this, he would be lying. 
Indirect Statement: 
CI1tEV on/roc; ei 6 ~iA.t1t1toC; 1:0U'to ei1tot J 'V£u8ot'to av. 
He / She said that if Philip should say this, he would be lying. 

30. 
A X A P N H L (8) 
(Both optatives are retained, along with av.) 
With ElPll and nb£t this sentence would be as follows: 
E<Pn 'tOY <P1At1tTtOV 'IIetiSecs9at (iv, d 'tOUtO eixot. 
n8Et 'tOY <P1AUt1tOV 'IIfu86 JLevov ClV, Ei '[OUtO etnol.. 
273 
He I She said I knew that Philip would be lying, if he should say this. 
(The optative of the main clause changes to the same tense of the 
infinitive after E<Pll and to the same tense of the participle after nbCt, 
with av retained. The optative of the original subordinate clause 
remains unchanged.) 
Note that av with an infinitive or participle in indirect statement may 
also represent a direct statement with a potential optative, e.g.: 
Direct Statement: 
po'UAoiJ.LT\V UV 'tOY 1Ci'tpov i8EtV. 
I would like to see the doctor. 
Indirect Statements: 
otojlcn tOY <PLAtnnOv uv PouAE0'9at 'tOY iatpov ibetv. 
I think that Philip would like to see the doctor. 
otba tOY <PtAln1tOV (Xv POUAOJ,1EVOV 'tOY iatpov ibEtV. 
I know that Philip would like to see the doctor.

GREEK TO ENGLISH 
VOCABULARY 
We do not give principal parts of contract verbs except when they are irregular. 
We do not give principal parts of compound verbs except when the uncompounded 
verb is not used in Attic Greek, e.g., o.<pllCVEOf.l(tt. For the principal parts of most com-
pound verbs, see the corresponding simple verb. 
We give the principal parts of all other regular and irregular verbs~ with their stems 
when their stems are different from what is seen in the present indicative form. 
For compound verbs we give in brackets the prefix and the simple verb when elision 
or elision and assimilation take place, e.g. uq)tl(V£olla.t [= o.1tO- + 1.lCV£O)l<u]. 
Note: 5/3 means that the vocabulary item appears in the vocabulary list in the second 
half of Chapter 5, i.e., in 5/3. A notation such as 14 Gr 2 refers to Chapter 14, Grammar 2. 
A notation such as 22 a PP means that the verb appears in the list of Principal Parts after 
the reading in Chapter 22 a. H or S accompanied by a page number means that the word 
or the meaning is needed only for a Greek Wisdom reading on that page (H = Heraclitus; 
S = Socrates).
